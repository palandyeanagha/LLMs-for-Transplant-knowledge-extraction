INTRODUCTION 
Alcohol-related liver injury has a varied spectrum ranging from 
simple steatosis to cirrhosis.1
 Alcoholic liver disease has often 
been grouped into three histological stages: fatty liver disease or 
simple steatosis; alcoholic hepatitis (AH); and cirrhosis. AH is a 
clinical syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury occurring in persons with active and chronic intake of ethanol. The exact incidence of AH is unknown, but approximate prevalence in a 
cohort of 1604 patients with alcoholism who underwent liver biopsy was 20%.2
 The cardinal sign of AH is the recent and rapid 
onset of jaundice.3
 Other common signs and symptoms include 
easy fatigability, fever, ascites, and proximal muscle loss. Some 
patients with severe AH may present with encephalopathy. The 
liver is enlarged and tender on palpation.3
 The ratio of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level to the alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) level is characteristically greater than 2, although this finding is neither specific nor sensitive.4
 The peripheral-blood white 
cell count, neutrophil count, total serum bilirubin level, and international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated.5
AH is the most florid manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease with high mortality, but is potentially reversible.6
 Mild AH 
without encephalopathy, jaundice, or coagulopathy has mortality 
of less than 5%. Severe AH has a poor prognosis without treatRole of liver transplantation in severe alcoholic hepatitis

Severe alcoholic hepatitis has very high short term mortality and corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment 
for decades. Patients with Lille score >0.45 are considered non-responders to steroids and have poor outcome. Recently 
Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) is being increasingly used as rescue treatment for these patients, without waiting 
for 6 months of abstinence. Liver transplant is the only rescue treatment which can potentially provide long term 
benefit for patients who are steroid non-responders. However, with scarcity of organs being a concern, all patients of 
severe alcoholic hepatitis cannot be chosen for transplantation in an arbitrary way. There is a need for development 
of predictive tools and objective protocols to select patients who can justify the use of precious liver grafts. With a 
stringent criteria for selection of patients receiving the graft, liver transplantation in severe alcoholic hepatitis can 
become a viable rescue therapeutic option conferring significant survival advantage of both short- and long-term 
basis. The optimal criteria for selection will also prevent misuse of the liver donor pool as well as to prevent mortality in 
salvageable patients. Further research needs to be done to identify subset of patients which are at low risk of recidivism 
and also cannot be managed with pharmacotherapy alone. We reviewed the current knowledge on role of OLT in 
patient with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis in the present review. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2018;24:43-50)

ment, with a 28-day mortality rate of 30-50%.7 Over the years 
various prognostic models in patients with AH have been developed, such as the DF score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score, ABIC (Age, Bilirubin, International Normalized Ratio, Creatinine) score, Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS), 
Early Change in bilirubin Level (ECBL) and Lille model.8
 In clinical 
practice mDF >32 or MELD >20 are considered severe AH.6,9
TREATMENT MODALITIES
Abstinence
Abstinence is the foremost aspect of management in patients 
with alcoholic liver disease irrespective of stage and severity.10 Patients with mild AH show significant response to abstinence and 
minimal medical support.11 The STOPAH trial highlighted that abstinence at 90 days after enrollment was the only factor associated with survival at 1 year.12 Importantly, any alcohol use at all at 
day 90, including less than 2 drinks/day, was associated with a 2- 
to 3-fold increase in mortality.12 Thus, all patients must be explained that slips i.e temporary return to drinking, often at low 
levels; or relapse which is more sustained resumption of drinking; 
lead to recurrent liver disease and increase risk of death. Pharmacological deaddiction should be advised to all patients.6
Nutrition
Protein energy malnutrition is very common in patients with AH 
with reported Prevalence of 100% in hospitalized patients.13 AH 
is considered a hypercatabolic disease and thus require prompt 
nutritional intervention with a high-calorie enteral or parenteral 
formula.14 Deterioration in nutritional parameters is a significant 
risk factor for survival in patients with severe AH, and this deterioration is potentially reversible with nutritional rehabilitation.15
The enteral route for supplementing nutrition is advantageous as 
it is less expensive, maintains gut mucosal integrity, and subsequently decreases the risk of bacterial translocation and infections.16 In a study of 71 patients, it was found that enteral feeding was not worse than steroids in the short-term treatment of 
severe AH.17 Enteral supplementation when compared with standard dietary intake, showed better nutritional status but without 
survival benefit.18
Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy for severe AH has chiefly revolved around two 
drugs, steroids and pentoxifylline, which have been recommended 
in various treatment guidelines.6,9,10 Since the first major study 
demonstrating mortality benefit with corticosteroid therapy by 
Maddrey, et al, about four decades ago, not much has changed in 
the medical therapy of AH.19 Over the years steroids have remained mainstay of medical therapy for severe AH, even though 
the data supporting the beneficial role is varied. Corticosteroids 
target the overly aggressive immune system provoked by increased generation of neo-antigens like epitopes of protein–aldehyde adducts and cytokines. EASL and AASLD recommend the 
use of prednisolone 40 mg/day for 4 weeks and then tapered over 
2 to 4 weeks or stopped.6,9,10 In a meta-analysis by Mathurin, et 
al, glucocorticoid therapy was found to decrease 28-day mortality 
by 14% which made the authors conclude that steroids should be 
administered in severe AH.20 On the other hand in the largest RCT 
on AH, the STOPAH trial, corticosteroid therapy was associated 
with a trend toward reduction in 28-day mortality with a reduction in mortality of 4%. However, this benefit did not persist at 90 
days or 1 year.12 The probable reason for this divergence was patients were in general younger and had less hepatic encephalopathy as compared with those in the most recent trials included in 
the meta-analysis, this could have mitigated the benefit of glucocorticoid.
Major drawback of steroid therapy is ineligibility of significant 
proportion of patients (due to GI bleed, acute kidney injury and 
active infections) along with the side effects which increase with 
duration of the therapy. Despite being the only drug to have stood 
the test of time, physicians remain reluctant to consider corticosteroid treatment.21 To identify the subset of patients who would 
eventually not respond to the therapy, early change in bilirubin 
levels at 1 week from the start of treatment and the Lille model 
were developed.22 A Lille score (continuous score between 0 and 
1 calculated at 1 week from the start of therapy) of ≤0.45 is considered a good response to corticosteroid therapy whereas a score 
of >0.45 is considered as non-response. In non-responders, steroids should be discontinued to avoid the side-effects.22 Moreover 
the six-month mortality is approximately 15% for patients who 
respond to therapy; it rises to over 75% for non-respondents.22
Thus, the non-responders to steroids remain at extremely high risk 
of short-term mortality.
Pentoxifylline, with its better safety profile, was seen as an attractive alternative to steroids especially in subset of patients in 

45

whom steroids could not be given.23 Pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine, mitigates production of tumor necrosis factor alpha which 
plays a role in the pathogenesis of AH.24 Frequent side effects include vomiting, diarrhoea and headache leading to drug discontinuation.25 The larger studies and a head-to-head randomized trial demonstrated inferiority of pentoxifylline as compared with 
steroids in terms of mortality benefit.26 Furthermore, the STOPAH 
trial with 1,103 patients demonstrated no benefit to pentoxifylline 
over placebo in preventing short-term mortality in severe AH.12
The role of pentoxifylline in severe AH needs to be relooked into. 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reconstitute glutathione reserves to reduce oxidative stress. In a multicenter, RCT 
on 174 patients, use of IV N-acetylcysteine (dose as used in patients with acetaminophen toxicity, but with maintenance dose 
extended to a total of 5 days) in combination with corticosteroids 
was compared with steroids alone and better patient survival at 1 
month was found in combination group (8% vs 24%; P=0.006), 
however there was no survival benefit at 3 or 6 months.27 This trial, although a negative trial as the primary end point was survival 
at 6 months, is an important study and further trials are needed 
to investigate its role in this cohort. 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION AS AN OPTION FOR 
SEVERE AH
Managing steroid non-responders and patients in whom steroids are contraindicated remains a challenge and unsolved medical problem.23 The therapeutic armamentarium at disposal, leaves 
no other option other than orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). 
With death staring at these patients, whether rescue OLT should 
be offered has been a matter of debate.
In the past OLT was not considered as a treatment option for 
severe AH even though almost 23% of transplants are done for 
alcoholic liver disease.28 Data from the European Liver Transplant 
Registry showed that patients who have undergone an OLT for alcohol related liver disease have as higher life expectancy compared to those with viral and cryptogenic etiologies.29,30 In the 
primary work published in 1993 by Bonet, et al in 147 ALD patients, similar survival post liver transplant for AH and decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis was reported.31 The French workers led 
by Mathurin in 2011, conducted a landmark pilot study, performed 
OLT for highly selected AH patients (Table 1).32 In this prospective 
case control study, 26 OLT recipients for AH were compared with 
26 AH patients who had failed steroid therapy, but did not receive 
OLT. They found that of the patients receiving liver transplants, 
77±8% survived for 6 months which was similar to a matched 
group of steroid responders (Lille score <0.45, 85%±4%) and significantly better than that of a matched group of steroid non-responders who did not receive liver transplants (23±8%). After 2 
years, 71±9% of transplant recipients were still alive. Of them 
three recipients returned to drinking at 3 years. Lesser than 2% of 
patients with severe AH received a liver transplant, and 3% of liver grafts were used for transplantation into patients with AH. This 
study had opened the window of opportunity for these patients.
In the years since, several American transplant centers have begun transplanting selected patients with severe AH. In a survey of 
45 transplant centres, 11 had transplanted patients for acute AH

over the last 5 years, constituting 45/3290 (1.37%) of total transplants at these centers.33 Among the 45 patients who were transplanted, 39/42 (93%) were alive at 6 months post-liver transplantation, 37/40 (93%) at 1 year, and 27/31 (87%) at 5 years 
demonstrating excellent patient survival.33
Im, et al studied the feasibility of LT in non-responder subset of 
patients with SAH in United States.34 They evaluated 94 patients 
with severe AH not responding to medical therapy for early OLT. 
Nine (9.6%) candidates with favourable psychosocial profiles underwent early OLT which were 3% of all adult OLT during the 
study period. The early OLT group compared with matched controls had better 6-month survival rate (89% vs. 11%, P<0.001).34
Clearly, liver transplantation for severe AH is associated with a 
dramatic survival benefit in both a study and real-world experience. 
WHY THERE IS STILL A DEBATE OVER LT IN AH?
Problems with liver transplantation for patients with AH are 
manifold. Beginning with, whether a patient with self-inflicted 
disease deserves the available liver graft which is a scarce resource.35 Second, recidivism and relapse are major concerns in 
these patients. Third, the fact that alcoholism is multisystem disease which precludes good result from surgery along with the risk 
of poor compliance in these patients.36 Fourth and the most debatable is the proper selection of patients who should be transplanted: the ones who are likely to die without a liver transplant 
and those who are unlikely to return to drinking.37 About 25% of 
the steroid null-responders will eventually recover with medical 
management and if transplanted at early stage would lead to 
wastage of precious liver grafts.22 The public perceptions of use of 
organs for patients with alcoholism complicate the issue further.38,39
The American Society of Transplantation and AASLD recommended the minimal criteria for listing of patients with ALD should 
include “approval by the center evaluation committee. and favorable assessment by a substance abuse professional and reported 
abstinence of at least six months at time of listing”.40 This was 
known as the “6-month rule”. The authors recognized that the last 
criterion excluded patients with severe AH, and thus they left open 
the possibility of exceptions.40 Six months of abstinence for alcoholic cirrhosis was recommended to allow liver function to recover 
from the acute effect of alcoholism.41 In 1997, following a meeting 
organised for placement on a liver transplant waiting list, this became a general requirement.42,43 However, since then this rule has 
also been used to determine the risk of recidivism after OLT. 
Although labeled as a “rule”, it is an expert opinion and not 
based on randomised control trials. Even in carefully chosen patients with alcoholic liver disease who remain abstinent for 6 
months, high rates of relapse have been demonstrated.43 The data 
on 6 months of abstinence as a predictor of recidivism after OLT 
has been inconsistent. In a systematic review of 22 studies, only 2 
of the 11 studies confirmed 6 months of abstinence to predict recidivism.44 Longer duration with zero alcohol consumption does 
decrease the probability relapse, 5% decrease with each additional month in the adjusted relapse rate.42 However, it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the clinical cut-off that would ensure abstinence after an OLT. Of the three patients who had relapsed, none 
of them did so in the first six months.32
Other obstacles for OLT include listing, evaluating and transplantation in short span of time (weeks) and giving these patients 
priority as they tend to have higher MELD score over patients 
waiting in the queue with decompensated CLD. Advantages of 
the MELD score as the listing criteria for patients with cirrhosis are 
its statistical validation and the use of objective widely available 
laboratory tests. The impact of the MELD allocation policy resulted in a reduction in waiting list registration by 12%, a reduction 
in death on the waiting list by 5%, decreased median waiting 
times from 676 to 416 days, and patients transplanted within 30 
days of listing increased from 23% in the pre-MELD era to 37% in 
the post-MELD era.45,46 However, MELD as a listing criteria for patients with AH is still not validated.
RISK OF RELAPSE AND ITS EFFECTS
One of important determinant of long term survival post liver 
transplant for alcoholic liver disease has been recidivism.47 Foremost issue in this regard is defining relapse. Some experts believe 
any drinking as relapse whereas others consider heavy alcohol 
abuse as it is associated with liver injury.48 Considering relapse as 
any alcohol intake after LT contrasts with the definition of relapse 
in addiction medicine, in which relapse is considered only in the 
presence of recurrence of heavy drinking. Varied rate of relapse 
after LT with range from 10% to 50% is explained by lack of consensus on definition of alcohol relapse.49-51 Another caveat about 
these estimates relates to the difficulty of getting accurate data 
on drinking behaviour.50 There were no differences in the proportion of liver transplant recipients that drank after a transplant due 

47
Ravi Daswani, et al.

to ALD compared with those with non-ALD: 4% vs. 5% at 6 
months and 17% vs. 16% at 12 months.52 Recipients who resume 
heavy drinking have shorter long-term survival than abstinent recipients or patients with minor relapse.53 A French study, conducted between 1990 and 2007, included 712 patients transplanted 
for alcoholic cirrhosis who survived beyond 6 months post liver 
transplantation. They were followed for a median of 9 years. Of 
the total, 18% experienced severe alcoholic relapse at a median 
of 25 months following liver transplantation and among them, 
41/128 (32%) were diagnosed with recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis at 
a median of 5.1 years after liver transplantation.54 A review of 
American transplant data between 1995 and 2007 had similar 
findings where 16% of patients transplanted for alcoholic liver 
disease relapsed to drinking.55 A meta-analysis of 50 studies identified 3 significant risk factors for relapse: poor social support, sobriety for less than 6 months before liver transplantation, and a 
family history of alcoholism.56 Psychological or psychiatric comorbidities are associated with an increased risk of relapse.57 A metaanalysis of risk for relapse to substance abuse after liver or other 
solid organ found that the relapse to any alcohol use after liver 
transplantation was over twice as common as relapse with heavy 
alcohol use (almost 6 vs. less than 3 cases per 100 persons per 
year).56
A correlation between impaired long-term survival and alcohol 
recidivism has been observed, but mostly due to increased incidence of cardiovascular events and malignancy rather than to toxic effects of alcohol on the liver graft.47 In this setting, duration of 
pre-transplant abstinence does not correlate with post-transplant 
survival.58 Smoking has been associated to be an important risk 
factor for development of malignancy.59
Some studies have demonstrated no direct deleterious effects of 
alcohol drinking on post-transplant outcomes, including therapeutic 
compliance, graft function, and graft survival60, while others have 
reported negative impacts of heavy drinking on outcomes.46 These 
conflicting data underline the need for better distinction of the different types of alcohol drinking after transplantation, ranging from 
occasional to moderate or severe, when alcohol habits could correspond to use, abuse, or dependence.48
Consensus regarding risk factors for alcohol recidivism is lacking. Which subset of patients with AH merit liver transplant and 
will have least risk of recidivism is still unanswered. The previously 
proposed sobriety rule has been questioned and challenged. 
Moreover, highly selected patients were transplanted in the published studies which comprised of only 1.4%-2.4% of the liver donor pool.32,34
For selection of recipient with minimal risk of recidivism and optimal use of liver grafts various protocols have been suggested. 
The potential candidates for transplant must be assessed by a 
multidisciplinary team. One of the recently published protocols, 
the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Center for Liver Disease and 
Transplantation Protocol, consisted of set of medical and psychosocial requirements.61 The need for psychosocial support should 
not be underestimated. Patient should have no prior formal substance abuse treatment, no current or past psychiatric diagnoses, 
no comorbid substance abuse, excluding tobacco along with stable housing and family support.
The most important factor is identification of the right patients 
who are best suited for such an aggressive intervention and, in 
fact, a small number of patients fall into this group.62 As in study 
by Mathurin, et al, patients with first episode of AH and those 
demonstrating willingness to abstain from alcohol and adherence 
to medical regimen can be considered for transplantation.32 This 
requires coordinated interactions in the team which can include 
the hepatologist, psychiatrist, surgeon, as well as the broader 
support team including the nurse coordinator, social worker, and 
addiction counsellor.61,62 This criteria although restrictive is based 
on the concept that patients who had previous episodes of liver 
failure intentionally chose to ignore the warning and hence have 
developed the subsequent episode. The other issue here is considerable amount of subjectivity in group decision making as it may 
be influenced by individual authorities.37 Post OLT these patients 
should have intense social and psychological support and monitoring prevention and early detection of relapse.59
Another debatable issue is role of living donor liver transplant 
(LDLT) in these patients as related living donor graft will not overburden the graft pool. The logic of treating a self-inflicted disease 
with help of family members can be easily understood. But, compared to deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT), complications 
like biliary leak (32% vs. 10%), re-exploration (26% vs. 17%) and 
vascular issues (9% vs. 2%) are significantly more frequent after 
LDLT.63 The donor related complications (1.1 % being serious) also 
needs to be considered in such situations.64
SHOULD WE OFFER TRANSPLANTATION TO 
PATIENTS NOT RESPONDING TO STEROIDS? 
Given these excellent outcomes as shown the recent studies,32-34
should we offer transplantation to steroid non-responders with 
severe AH who have not demonstrated a period of abstinence 

48 http://www.e-cmh.org

https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2017.0027
from alcohol? To answer this very pertaining question one has to 
look at a larger picture. The 6-month survival is less than 25% in 
steroid non-responders who do not receive liver transplants.32 This 
dismal prognosis calls for the use of OLT for these sick patients. 
However, liver graft is very scarce resource which needs to be utilized judiciously. An argument against the use is based on perception of disservice to patients awaiting OLT for already established 
indications. Additionally, a moral point of view that disease is selfinflicted has been invoked as a reason not to transplant such patients. Moreover, there is no surety that post-transplant the patient would remain sober. Also, there is constant worry of patients 
relapse and development of liver graft injury. The proponents of 
the transplant in these patients believe that the 6-month rule is 
arbitrary and has been challenged. 
Although alcoholic recidivism occurs, it may not affect compliance to treatment profoundly or to compromise graft function.65
Moreover, the patients with severe AH seldom survive till 6 
months to prove their abstinence as to fulfill the criteria.22 This 
clearly goes against the concept of beneficence, as the patients 
who need and will benefit the most of transplant are more often 
excluded. Furthermore, rescue OLT is the only alternative in such 
patients for survival. With excellent outcomes post-transplant, it is 
even more unreasonable to withhold transplant in these patients 
who have high short-term mortality.32
The argument of self-inflicted disease is not a valid one. An 
emergency OLT is approved for patients with suicidal acetaminophen resulting in fulminant hepatic failure.66 On similar lines OLT 
for patients with prior I.V drug use resulting in viral hepatitis or 
obesity leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease continue to 
form major chunk of all OLTs.67 The denial of treatment on moral 
or judgemental grounds is akin to robbing the patient of a fundamental right to treatment without discrimination (The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, article 25).68 This type of contradictory practice could discredit the entire transplant system. Alcoholism is a disease, and should be treated as one.
CONCLUSIONS
Severe AH is florid manifestation of alcohol related to liver disease with high short-term mortality. Corticosteroids have been 
shown to decrease the short-term mortality. Steroid non-responders are left with continuation of supportive therapy to avoid steroid related side effects. These patients are in particular at very 
high risk of mortality. Liver transplant is the only rescue treatment 
which also provides long term benefit. With scarcity of organs being a concern, candidates cannot be chosen in an arbitrary way. 
There is a need for development of predictive tools and objective 
protocols to select patients who can justify the use of precious liver grafts. Further research needs to be done to identify subset of 
patients which are at low risk of recidivism and also cannot be 
managed with pharmacotherapy alone.
