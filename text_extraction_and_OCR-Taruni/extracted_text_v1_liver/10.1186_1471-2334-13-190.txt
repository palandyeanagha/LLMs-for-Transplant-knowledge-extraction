Abstract
Background: SPRINT-2 demonstrated that boceprevir (BOC), an oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3 (NS3)
protease inhibitor, added to peginterferon alfa-2b (P) and ribavirin (R) significantly increased sustained virologic
response rates over PR alone in previously untreated adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1. We estimated the
long-term impact of triple therapy vs. dual therapy on the clinical burden of HCV and performed a costeffectiveness evaluation.
Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate the incidence of liver complications, discounted costs (2010 US$),
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of three treatment strategies for
treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1. The model simulates the treatment regimens studied in
SPRINT-2 in which PR was administered for 4 weeks followed by: 1) placebo plus PR for 44 weeks (PR48); 2) BOC
plus PR using response guided therapy (BOC/RGT); and 3) BOC plus PR for 44 weeks (BOC/PR48) and makes
projections within and beyond the trial. HCV-related state-transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained
from previously published studies. All costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%.
Results: The model projected approximately 38% and 43% relative reductions in the lifetime incidence of liver
complications in the BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 regimens compared with PR48, respectively. Treatment with BOC/RGT
is associated with an incremental cost of $10,348 and an increase of 0.62 QALYs compared to treatment with PR48.
Treatment with BOC/PR48 is associated with an incremental cost of $35,727 and an increase of 0.65 QALYs
compared to treatment with PR48. The ICERs were $16,792/QALY and $55,162/QALY for the boceprevir-based
treatment groups compared with PR48, respectively. The ICER for BOC/PR48 compared with BOC/RGT was $807,804.
Conclusion: The boceprevir-based regimens used in the SPRINT-2 trial were projected to substantially reduce the
lifetime incidence of liver complications and increase the QALYs in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C
genotype 1. It was also demonstrated that boceprevir-based regimens offer patients the possibility of experiencing
great clinical benefit with a shorter duration of therapy. Both boceprevir-based treatment strategies were projected
to be cost-effective at a reasonable threshold in the US when compared to treatment with PR48.

Background
Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global
public health problem. According to the World Health
Organization statistics, approximately 130–170 million
people are currently infected with chronic HCV worldwide [1]. In the United States (U.S.) and Europe, HCV is
the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the leading
indication for liver transplantation [2-5]. HCV infection
represents a substantial clinical and economic burden in
the U.S. [6,7]. For example, it is estimated that 3.2 million persons are chronically infected [6] and that HCV
infection causes approximately 15,000 deaths annually
[8]. The total 2011 healthcare cost associated with HCV
in the U.S. was estimated at $6.5 ($4.3–$8.4) billion [9].
Generally, it takes several years – possibly decades –
between infection with HCV and development of serious
liver disease. Hence, although the incidence of acute
HCV infection is declining, the prevalence of cirrhosis
and incidence of HCV-related liver disease is expected
to increase over the next 10–20 years [10].
There are 6 major HCV genotypes [11]. Approximately
70% of HCV infected people in the U.S. have genotype 1,
which is the most difficult-to-treat [12]. Prior to 2011, the
standard of care for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection
was 48 weeks of antiviral (AV) treatment with a combination of a pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin [13].
With peginterferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b and ribavirin
treatment, less than 50% of treatment-naïve genotype 1
patients achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR)
[14,15]. Patients with advanced liver disease and of
African-American descent have an even lower likelihood of attaining an SVR with this treatment regimen
(20%–30%) [16].
In 2011, HCV protease inhibitors obtained regulatory
approval and became available to treat patients infected
with HCV genotype 1. The addition of HCV protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, to peginterferon alfa
and ribavirin have led to markedly higher SVR rates
[17-20]. As a result, the American Association for the
Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines were
updated in 2011 to recommend including the protease
inhibitors in the treatment regimens of patients infected
with HCV genotype 1 [21]. The objective of this study
was to assess the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness
of the boceprevir-containing regimens that were studied
in the Serine Protease Inhibitor Therapy 2 (SPRINT-2)
trial in treatment-naïve patients. The secondary objective
was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of boceprevirbased treatment strategies compared to treatment with
dual therapy in pre-specified subsets of the population
and in sensitivity analyses. The projections are based on
a decision analytic model that integrates data from public sources, published literature, and clinical trial databases under a clearly specified set of assumptions.
Methods
SPRINT-2 study design
SPRINT-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00705432) was
a Phase 3, international, randomized, double-blinded
placebo-controlled study comparing the safety and efficacy
of therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin
(PegIntron and Rebetol, respectively; Merck) with two treatment regimens that added boceprevir (Victrelis, Merck)
after a 4-week lead-in treatment period with peginterferon–
ribavirin alone [17]. SPRINT-2 was conducted in accordance
with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study
protocol and study design were approved by each of the
sites institutional review board and regulatory agencies,
and each participant provided written informed consent
before undergoing any study-related procedure. A list
of the institutional review boards that approved the study
protocol and study design is provided in Additional file 1:
Table S1. The full study protocol is available at http://
www.nejm.org/action/showSupplements?doi=10.1056%
2FNEJMoa1010494&viewType=Popup&viewClass=Suppl.
Previously untreated patients (N = 1097) ≥18 years of age
with genotype 1 chronic HCV and plasma HCV-RNA level
≥10,000 IU/mL were eligible. Because of the known marked
difference in SVR rates with peginterferon–ribavirin between black and non-black patients [16], self-identified
blacks and non-blacks were enrolled separately into two
cohorts. Exclusion criteria included liver disease of other
etiology, decompensated cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, HIV
or hepatitis B, pregnant/breast feeding women, or active
malignancy. Liver biopsies were assigned METAVIR fibrosis and steatosis scores by a single pathologist who was unaware of treatment assignment.
Peginterferon alfa-2b was administered subcutaneously
at 1.5 μg/kg once weekly. Ribavirin was administered
using weight-based dosing of 600–1400 mg/day (divided
daily dose). Boceprevir was administered orally at a dose
of 800 mg three times daily (to be taken with food and
with an interval of 7 to 9 hours between doses) in four
capsules of 200 mg each. Placebo was matched to
boceprevir. The study was double-blinded regarding the
administration of boceprevir.
All patients received peginterferon–ribavirin during the
4-week lead-in period. Patients randomized to control received peginterferon–ribavirin treatment for 44 weeks after
the lead-in period, as well as placebo three times daily beginning at week 5 (PR48). The overall SVR rate in the
PR48 arm of SPRINT-2 was 38% (137/366) for both cohorts, 40% (125/311) for the non-black, and 23% (12/52)
for the black cohort [17]. Patients randomized to the
response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) regimen received
peginterferon–ribavirin plus boceprevir for a total of
24 weeks after the lead-in period; if HCV-RNA levels
were undetectable from week 8 through week 24, treatment was considered complete, but if HCV-RNA levels

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/13/190

were detectable at any visit from week 8 up to but not including week 24, peginterferon–ribavirin was continued,
and placebo was administered at week 28 through week
48. The overall SVR rate in the BOC/RGT arm of
SPRINT-2 was 63% for both cohorts (233/368), 67% (211/
316) for the non-black, and 42% (22/52) for the black cohort [17]. Patients randomized to the third regimen received peginterferon–ribavirin plus oral boceprevir for
44 weeks after the lead-in period (BOC/PR48). The overall
SVR rate in the BOC/PR48 arm of SPRINT-2 was 66% for
both cohorts (242/366), 68% (213/311) for the non-black,
and 53% (29/55) for the black cohort [17].
In each arm, patients with detectable HCV-RNA at
week 24 discontinued treatment as a standard futility
rule. Boceprevir was given for 24 weeks in the BOC/
RGT arm and 44 weeks in the BOC/PR48 arm. All patients were followed through week 72.
Model structure
We created an Excel-based (Microsoft Corp., Redmond,
Washington) Markov model to project health-related
outcomes and to estimate the expected costs and quality
adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the three
treatment strategies studied in SPRINT-2. The structure
of the model was based on other published health
economic models of HCV disease [22-27]. The model
consists of two phases: the first phase corresponds to
the treatment strategies and follow-up period and the
second phase corresponds to post-treatment, which includes the natural history of HCV of cured or uncured
patients (Figure 1).
Patients entered the model with chronic HCV and
immediately began AV drug therapy. The treatment
phase of the model includes a weekly cycle length in
which patients can stop therapy early for a variety of
reason (i.e. discontinued due to standard futility rule,
adverse events, or other non-medical reasons). Patients
with undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment
were followed for an additional 24 weeks. Patients with
undetectable HCV-RNA after 24 weeks of follow-up
achieved an SVR. Relapse was defined as the occurrence
of undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment, but
detectable HCV-RNA after the 24 week follow-up period.
In the model, patients who experienced relapse returned
to the chronic HCV health states. Patients who failed to
pass a futility rule or who had detectable HCV-RNA at
the end of treatment were considered treatment failures
and also returned to the chronic HCV health states.
The second phase of the model uses cycles with a
length of one year and describes patient outcome postBeginTx

treatment. After the trial follow-up period (72 weeks),
patients either attained an SVR or returned to the natural health states of HCV. The severity of chronic HCV
infection was defined by the degree of fibrosis using the
METAVIR scoring system: no fibrosis (F0), portal fibrosis without septa (F1), portal fibrosis with few septa (F2),
numerous septa without fibrosis (F3), and cirrhosis (F4).
Patients with mild or moderate chronic HCV at baseline,
described by a METAVIR fibrosis score of F0-F3, who
attained an SVR were considered permanently cured;
cirrhotic patients who attained an SVR were considered
partially cured. Patients who were permanently cured
were considered to be neither at risk for developing further HCV-related liver complications nor for reinfection.
Patients with cirrhosis at baseline continued to be at risk
for developing advanced stages of liver complications associated with cirrhosis even if they achieved SVR; however,
for cirrhotic patients who attained an SVR the probability
of developing advanced stages of liver complications was
less than that of an untreated cirrhotic patient [28].
Patients who failed to achieve an SVR returned to the
natural HCV health states and were at risk for developing serious liver disease and could receive a liver transplant at the same rate as patients who did not receive
treatment. The model simulates the natural history of
chronic HCV and advanced liver-related diseases and its
treatment, consistent with the current understanding of
the biology of chronic HCV-related liver disease and its
treatment (e.g., liver transplant). The progressive disease
model assumed that during one cycle, a person with a
given fibrosis score could progress to the next fibrosis
level of severity or could remain in that current health
state. In the absence of successful treatment, regression
to less severe health states, or spontaneous clearance of
the virus, was not permitted. Patients with compensated
cirrhosis were at risk for developing the sequelae of
cirrhosis - decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Patients who developed DC and/or HCC could receive
a liver transplant. Because of differential mortality, costs
and quality of life between the first year and subsequent
years of these health states, they were divided into two
states: DC, first year and DC, subsequent years; HCC,
first year and HCC, subsequent years; and the Liver
Transplant and Post-Liver Transplant states. The Liver
Transplant health state lasted a total of 1 year. If a
patient was alive at the end of 1 year, then the patient
transitioned to the Post-Liver Transplant state. Patients
who received a liver transplant were assumed to be at
no risk of reactivation and progression to liver disease.
The mortality risk of the general population was
applied to all states in the model. In addition, an excess
mortality rate was applied to patients with DC, HCC, or
who received a liver transplant.
Model inputs
The model required information describing the patient
characteristics for the treatment population as well as
model inputs describing treatment characteristics, clinical inputs, costs and utility values associated with AV
therapy and the HCV health states (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
The patient characteristics of the cohorts and the treatment characteristics were obtained from SPRINT-2.
Baseline values and plausible ranges to be used in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for model
inputs describing the clinical characteristics of HCV and
the utility values applied to each of the health states
were obtained from published studies. All clinical inputs
used in the model are summarized in Table 3.
Patient characteristics
As patient characteristics impact the efficacy of the
treatment regimens and the annual mortality rate, the
analyses were conducted on a cohort of persons with
chronic HCV genotype 1 who were representative of
participants in SPRINT-2. In the model, a series of 20
cohorts progressed through each treatment regimen.
The cohorts represent all possible combinations of gender, race cohort, and baseline METAVIR fibrosis score
(2 × 2 × 5 = 20). The average age of the overall SPRINT-2
study cohort was applied to all patients in the analysis.
The reported distributions of gender, baseline fibrosis
level, and race cohort from SPRINT-2 were assumed for
the treatment population (17, Table 1).
Treatment characteristics
Treatment characteristics were obtained from reported
data in SPRINT-2 (Table 2). We assumed that patients
experienced the same treatment efficacy, discontinuation
rates, treatment-related anemia, and utilized erythropoietin (EPO) to treat anemia as observed in SPRINT-2.

Clinical inputs
Clinical inputs described the rate of HCV progression,
the probability of receiving a liver transplant, and allcause and liver-related mortality rates and were used in
the model to determine the amount of time patients
spend in each HCV health state (Table 3).
Progression of HCV infection
The literature search resulted in a wide range of values
for progression rates [52,53]. We used the progression
rates from Thein et al. [29], a recent meta-analysis of
published progression rates from 111 studies of individuals with chronic HCV infection. They provided stagespecific progression rates by fibrosis level, as described
using the METAVIR scoring system. The meta-analysis
demonstrated that the progression rates are not linear
and are generally higher in the initial stage F0 to F1 than
the transitions between the stages with more fibrosis
(i.e. F1 to F2). The estimates were also adjusted for biases
attributable to study design and selection factors associated with study population and clinical characteristics.
The annual probability of developing advanced stages
of liver complications associated with cirrhosis was derived from published studies. The baseline likelihood of
developing DC from compensated cirrhosis was estimated using a weighted average of the annual incidence
rates reported in five natural history studies of 1,276 cirrhotic patients [30-34]. Similarly, the annual transition
rate from compensated cirrhosis to HCC was estimated
using a weighted average of the annual incidence rates
reported in nine natural history studies of 1,905 cirrhotic
patients [30-38]. The baseline likelihood of developing
HCC from DC was estimated from a study by Planas
et al. [39] that followed 200 patients with DC. The estimates for the transition rates to DC and HCC in cirrhotic patients who achieved SVR were obtained from a
study by Cardoso et al. [28].
Probability of receiving a liver transplant
Previously published U.S. based cost-effectiveness
models estimated the probability of receiving a liver
transplant from DC using Bennett et al. [54], which estimated the prevalence of DC using mortality rates from a
1987 study by Gines et al. [55] and 1994 data from
United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Division of Organ Transplantation [40]. In our model, this
estimate was updated to take into account the increase
in survival rates, prevalence of patients with liver decompensation, and changes in liver-transplant practice
that have occurred since 1994. According to the analysis
of the Scientific Registry of Liver Transplant Recipients
(SRTR) data, from 1999 to 2007, the number of recipients with HCV increased to a peak of 2,481 in 2006 and
remained relatively stable at around 2,400 transplants
annually thereafter [41]. In addition, HCV-related DC
became more common after 1995 with the prevalence in
2010 estimated as 103,117 [42]. We estimated the annual
probability of receiving a liver transplant from DC by
dividing the most recent data for the number of HCVrelated liver-transplants with the prevalence of HCVrelated DC, i.e. 2400/103117 = 2.3%. Although the number
of liver transplants has increased, our estimate is lower
than that assumed in previous studies (3.1%) primarily
because of a substantial increase in the prevalence of DC.
The annual probability of patients with HCC receiving a
liver transplant was estimated as 4.0% using a study by
Lang et al. [43].
Mortality
We used gender and age-specific all-cause mortality
rates from the 2006 U.S. life tables to describe the risk
of mortality associated with all states in the model [44].
In addition, an excess mortality rate associated with decompensation of the liver was estimated from Planas
et al. [39] and probability of death from HCC was
obtained from Fattovich et al. [30]. Liver-transplant related mortality was estimated from the most recent data
available on liver transplants using the study by Wolfe
et al. [45].
Cost inputs
The model was developed from the payer perspective.
We included the cost of AV therapy and management of
HCV disease in patients who did not achieve SVR. All
costs were expressed in terms of 2010 US dollars. AV
therapy costs include drug costs, the cost of managing
treatment-related anemia, and monitoring costs for
patients on therapy. AV drug costs were calculated using
the weekly costs of peginterferon and the generic version
of ribavirin, assuming a daily dose of 1000 mg [46]. The
weekly cost of boceprevir was assumed to be $1100. The
drug costs accounted for the discontinuation of treatment due to the standard futility rule, adverse events, or
other non-medical reasons. As ribavirin is administered
using weight-based dosing, the average weight of
patients was used to determine the cost of ribavirin.
The average costs applied to each natural HCV health
state were derived from published studies. The costs of
treating chronic HCV and compensated cirrhosis were
based on a retrospective, matched cohort claims database study [49]. The reported costs were modified by
subtracting the AV therapy costs reported by patients
with a METAVIR score of F0–F4 and by adjusting the
inpatient hospitalization costs using the national hospital
cost-to-charge ratio. McAdam-Marx et al. [49] only
reported an aggregated cost for the F0–F3 health states.
The disaggregated costs of ''HCV without liver disease"
were estimated by taking into account the relative
Ferrante et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2013, 13:190 Page 7 of 17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/13/190

contribution of mild (F0, F1), moderate (F2), and severe
(F3) to the total HCV-related cost reported in Davis
et al. [50]. Future costs were discounted at 3% per year.
Quality of life inputs
Utility weights for each of the health states and liver disease conditions were applied to the utilities of the general population. The utility weights were estimated from
a previously published study of patients with chronic
HCV [51] and adjusted to the U.S. population norm by
using age- and gender-specific utility weights of the U.S.
general population [48]. There are limited data on the
impact of treatment on health-related quality of life. Side
effects associated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin
are well-documented and include IFN-induced bone
marrow depression, flu‐like symptoms, neuropsychiatric
disorders, autoimmune syndromes, and anemia [56]. In
addition to these side effects, the boceprevir-based regimens were also associated with a higher probability of
anemia and dysguesia [17]. The magnitude of the decrement in quality of life associated with the side effects of
boceprevir has not been empirically quantified. In our
analysis, we assumed that patients who do not experience side effects experienced the same decrement in
quality of life regardless of their treatment strategy
(PR48 vs. BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48). Similarly, we assumed that patients with incident anemia experienced
the same decrement in quality of life regardless of their
treatment strategy. We used previously published estimates to quantify the impact of AV therapy on the quality of life for patients with chronic HCV without
incident anemia [24]. The impact of incident anemia on
the quality of life for patients who are receiving AV
treatment for HCV was estimated from a study of the
impact of anemia on the quality of life of patients with
cancer [47]. Differences in the average quality of life
amongst the regimens for patients on AV therapy are
due to differences in the proportion of patients experienced anemia.
For patients who are cured by treatment, we assumed
that an SVR following treatment eliminates all decrements in health-related quality of life associated with living in the chronic HCV infection state. Future QALYs
were discounted at 3% per year.
Model outcomes
The model was run for each of the specified 20 patient
profiles. An overall weighted average of the results was
generated based on the distribution of the patient characteristics assumed for a given analysis. The model
projected the lifetime incidence of serious liver complications, total costs, and QALYs associated with each
treatment strategy as well as no treatment. In addition,
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of
boceprevir-based regimens compared with treatment
with peginterferon and ribavirin alone as well as for
PR48 compared with no treatment were estimated.
Sensitivity and subset analyses
Extensive sensitivity analyses on inputs were performed
to estimate their impact on the total costs and QALYs
of the boceprevir-based regimens and the dual therapy
regimen. Specifically, we examined the effect of varying
the values of inputs related to SVR rates, progression
rates, cost, and quality of life weights in both one-way
and multivariate sensitivity analyses. In the sensitivity
analyses, the lower and upper bounds of the transition
rates and QALYs were obtained from published studies;
the costs were varied by increasing and decreasing the
base case values by 25%; and the lower and upper
bounds of the SVR rates were obtained from the
bounds of their respective 95% confidence intervals on
the reported values. In the multivariate sensitivity analyses, we applied the lower and upper bounds of all
similar variables (i.e. the lower bounds of all progression rates). In addition, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to examine the impact of
varying these covariates simultaneously. The baseline
values, range of values examined in sensitivity analyses,
distribution of parameters assumed for the PSA, and
references for clinical, economic, and utility parameters
are included in Table 3. The baseline values, range of
values examined in sensitivity analyses, and distribution
of parameters assumed for the PSA for the treatment
efficacy rates are included in Table 2. The results of the
PSA were based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation
runs.
Patients in SPRINT-2 were randomized by race cohort
to each of the three treatment groups and the data was
analyzed separately in the primary efficacy analysis.
Hence, subgroup analyses were generated for each race
cohort (non-black vs. black). Because the recommended
treatment regimen for boceprevir use in the U.S. is not
exactly as was studied in the trials, we conducted a supplemental analysis depicting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved label [57] recommendations by
modifying the treatment strategy phase in the model and
reanalyzing the data from SPRINT-2. The label includes
different treatment strategies for patients without cirrhosis and patients with cirrhosis. The recommended treatment strategy for patients without cirrhosis is similar to
the BOC/RGT arm in SPRINT-2 and the recommended
treatment strategy for patients with cirrhosis is similar
to the BOC/PR48 arm in SPRINT-2. Model modifications include estimating the treatment characteristics for
patients based on their baseline cirrhosis status
(METAVIR score of F0–F3 vs. F4), and accounting for
an additional futility rule at week 12.

Results
No treatment compared with dual therapy
Over the lifetime of this cohort, our model predicted
that treatment with PR48 will result in relative decreases
in the cumulative incidence by 37% in DC, 38% in HCC,
38% in liver transplants, and 38% in liver-related deaths
compared to no treatment. The total discounted lifetime
costs and QALYs associated with no treatment are
$37,230 and 13.67, respectively. The total discounted
lifetime costs and QALYs associated with PR48 treatment are $58,761 and 14.55, respectively. The corresponding ICER comparing PR48 treatment with no
treatment is $24,435/QALY.
Base case analysis
The model projected the lifetime cumulative risk of developing HCV-related liver complications associated
with each of the treatment strategies studied in SPRINT2 over time (Figure 2). Over the lifetime of this cohort,
our model predicted that treatment with BOC/RGT will
result in relative decreases in the cumulative incidence
by 38% in DC, 39% in HCC, 38% in liver transplants,
and 38% in liver-related deaths compared to treatment
with PR48. This implies that treating 21 patients with
BOC/RGT instead of PR48 will avoid 1 case of DC;
treating 17 patients will avoid 1 case of HCC; treating
116 patients will avoid 1 liver transplant; and treating 13
patients will avoid 1 liver-related death. Similarly, our
model predicted treatment with BOC/PR48 will result in
relative decreases in the cumulative incidence by 42% in
DC, 43% in HCC, 42% in liver transplants, and 42% in
liver-related deaths compared to treatment with PR48.
This implies that treating 19 patients with BOC/PR48
instead of PR48 will avoid 1 case of DC; treating 15
patients will avoid 1 case of HCC; treating 104 patients
will avoid 1 liver transplant; and treating 12 patients will
avoid 1 liver-related death. In addition, treatment with
BOC/RGT and treatment with BOC/PR48 are associated
with overall increases in life expectancy of 0.97 and 1.07
years, respectively, when compared with PR48 treatment.
The total discounted lifetime costs and QALYs associated
with each treatment strategy are summarized in Table 4.
The ICERs of both boceprevir-based regimens were calculated in comparison with the PR48 treatment arm. Although
the AV therapy costs of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 are considerably higher ($47,582 and $69,928) than the AV therapy
costs of PR48 ($29,573), the projected costs of managing
HCV and HCV-related liver disease in patients who received boceprevir-based treatment were 37%–42% lower
than that in patients who received PR48. Compared to treatment with PR48, the ICER for treatment with BOC/RGT
was $16,792/QALY and the ICER for treatment with BOC/
PR48 was $55,162/QALY. The ICER for treatment with
BOC/PR48 compared with BOC/RGT was $807,804/QALY.
Sensitivity analyses
The ICERs compared with PR48 from the one-way sensitivity analyses of chronic disease progression rates, rate
of developing advanced liver disease, all health state
costs, and most utility values were within $6 K/QALY
and $11 K/QALY of the BOC/RGT (range: $1,747 to
$42,983/QALY) and BOC/PR48 (range: $21,016 to
$88,789/QALY) base-case ICERs, respectively (See
Additional file 2: Table S2 online). The ICERs that fell
out of these ranges were obtained when the lower
bound of the quality of life of the SVR state for patients
who had a baseline METAVIR score of F1 was assumed
(BOC/RGT: $25,685 and BOC/PR48: $87,264) and
when assumptions concerning treatment efficacies were
varied. When the efficacy of PR48 was assumed to be
45.4%, the upper limit of the 95% confidence bound,
and the efficacies for BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48
remained the base case values, the ICERs of BOC/RGT
and BOC/PR48 increased to $29,369 and $81,237, respectively. Conversely, when the efficacies of the
boceprevir-based regimens were assumed to be the
upper limits of the confidence bounds, and the efficacy
of PR48 was assumed to be the base case value, both
BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 became cost-saving compared to dual therapy.
Compared to treatment with PR48, the ICERs from the
multivariate sensitivity analyses ranged from $2,338 to
$33,511 for BOC/RGT and from $21,016 to $117,395 for
BOC/PR48 (Table 4). The ICERs are most sensitive to assumptions concerning the quality of life of the HCV health
states (range: $10,906–$31,124/QALY for BOC/RGT vs.
PR48; range: $34,927–$108,965/QALY for BOC/PR48 vs.
PR48) and least sensitive to assumptions concerning the
quality of life of patients on treatment for those who
receive BOC/RGT (range: $16,724–$16,819/QALY) and
quality of life of the general population for patients who
receive BOC/PR48 (range: $54,133–$56,228/QALY).
The results of the corresponding probabilistic sensitivity analysis are described in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (Figure 3). Compared to treatment with
PR48, and using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
of $50,000 per QALY as a threshold, treatment with
BOC/RGT was cost-effective in 99.9% of the simulations
and treatment with BOC/PR48 was cost-effective in
51.9% of the simulations. Using an incremental costeffectiveness ratio of $100,000 per QALY as a threshold,
treatment with BOC/RGT was cost-effective in 100% of
the simulations and treatment with BOC/PR48 was costeffective in 99.5% of the simulations.
Subset analyses
In the non-black cohort, treatment with both boceprevirbased regimens were projected to result in a gain of approximately 0.64 QALYs over those obtained with PR48

treatment (Figure 4, Table 5). This corresponds to ICERs of
$15,067/QALY and $56,013/QALY for the BOC/RGT and
BOC/PR48 treatment regimens compared to the PR48
regimen, respectively. In the black cohort, treatment with
BOC/RGT was projected to result in a gain of 0.47 QALYs
and treatment with BOC/PR48 was projected to result in a
gain of 0.68 QALYs over those obtained with PR48 treatment. This corresponds to ICERs of $30,627/QALY and
$50,423/QALY for the BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 treatment regimens, respectively, when compared to treatment
with PR48. The ICER of BOC/PR48 compared with BOC/
RGT in treating black patients is $94,610/QALY.
The analysis comparing the boceprevir label recommendation relative to dual therapy resulted in an average
increase of $18,047 in cost and 0.66 in QALYs and the
corresponding ICER was $27,265/QALY (Table 5).
Discussion
In our model, we assumed that SVR is a cure for mild
and moderate HCV and that patients who achieve an
SVR through AV therapy will not be at risk for developing serious and costly complications associated with
HCV. There are a small number of studies which suggest that patients with moderate HCV may develop
HCC even after achieving an SVR with drug therapy
[37,38]. The limited data suggests that the probability of
this transition is very close to zero. Because of the limited information and since the transition is negligible, we
did not include it in our model. Data also suggests that
cirrhotic patients may have a regression of fibrosis if
they achieve an SVR, which would lower their risk of developing HCV-related liver complications. A recently
published study by van der Meer et al. [58] showed that
the all-cause mortality rates in patients who achieved
SVR and who did not achieve SVR were 8.9% and 27%
at 10 years, respectively. They also reported that 10-year
cumulative incidence rates of HCC and decompensated
cirrhosis in patients who achieved SVR were 5.1% and
2.1%, respectively. In our analysis, we also included a
progression of disease in cirrhotic patients who achieved
SVR, and the incidence rates reported by van der Meer
et al. were included in our sensitivity analysis range.
SPRINT-2 demonstrated that the addition of boceprevir
to peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin after a 4-week
peginterferon―ribavirin lead-in period significantly increased SVR rate over treatment with peginterferon―ribavirin alone in previously untreated adult
patients infected with HCV genotype 1. However, the
boceprevir-based treatment regimens themselves are more
costly than treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin
alone. Given the scarce resources and competing
demands, payers often need to consider the long-term impact that treatment will have on the clinical and economic
burden of disease. Our modeling study assessed the costeffectiveness of the boceprevir-based strategies studied in
SPRINT-2 over the lifetime of patients from the payer
perspective. We also examined the impact of the FDAapproved label-based strategies on the incidence of HCVrelated complications, lifetime costs, QALYS, and assessed
the cost-effectiveness of these regimens.
Our model estimates that treatment with PR48 is associated with considerable reductions on the incidence of
serious liver complications compared to no treatment
and is cost-effective at commonly used thresholds. However, our model projections indicate that treatment with
boceprevir-based regimens offer substantial additional
benefit.
A difference in the incidence rates of serious liver
disease between boceprevir-based regimens and PR48
was projected to occur within 10 years following treatment (Figure 2). Hence, although the AV therapy costs
of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 are considerably greater
than the AV therapy costs of PR48, a savings in the
projected costs of managing HCV-related liver disease is
expected to offset some of the drug costs. The ICERs of
the BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 treatment regimens compared with PR48 were $16,792/QALY and $55,162/QALY,
respectively. Thus both BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 are
considered cost-effective at commonly used thresholds
[59]. In addition, the ICER of BOC/PR48 compared with
BOC/RGT was $807,804/QALY, which implies that BOC/
PR48 is not cost-effective at commonly used thresholds
when compared to treatment with BOC/RGT. The high
ICER obtained from comparing BOC/PR48 to BOC/RGT
is mostly explained by the small difference in SVR rates
between the two treatment strategies (BOC/PR48: 66% vs.
BOC/RGT: 63%) and the difference in AV therapy costs
(BOC/PR48:$69,928 vs. BOC/RGT: $47,582).
Describing the natural history of chronic HCV has been
historically difficult because acute infection is often
asymptomatic, and the duration between infection and development of advanced stages of liver disease is typically
long [60]. Because of the variability of the estimates
reported in literature and potential variability in treatment
efficacy, we conducted sensitivity analyses on the majority
of model inputs – treatment efficacy, transition rates,
health state costs, and the quality of life associated with
the health states. Results on the costs, benefits and costeffectiveness of treatment varied widely across the different
scenarios considered. The majority of one-way sensitivity
analyses did not substantially impact the ICERs compared
to the base case analyses. Only 5 of the 103 scenarios evaluated resulted in an ICER comparing BOC/RGT to PR48
that was more than $5000 different from the base case analysis ($16,792/QALY). Specifically, assumptions regarding
the utility of the SVR-F1 health state, efficacy of PR48 and
BOC/RGT, and the discount rates were most impactful on
the ICER. Similarly, only 18 of the 103 scenarios evaluated
Ferrante et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2013, 13:190 Page 10 of 17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/13/190

resulted in an ICER comparing BOC/PR48 to PR48 that
was more than $5,000 different from the base case analysis
($55,162/QALY). Specifically, assumptions regarding the
transition rates from F4 to DC and F4 to HCC; utility of
the F1-F4, SVR-F1, SVR-F2 health states; efficacy of PR48
and BOC/PR48; and the discount rates were most impactful on the ICER. These results imply that in
comparison to treatment with dual therapy, the ICERs of
BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 are robust if a single model
parameter is changed.
Multivariate sensitivity analyses found that there is more
variability in the cost-effectiveness ratios associated with

BOC/PR48 vs. PR48 treatment than in the costeffectiveness ratios associated with BOC/RGT vs. PR48.
The ICERs were most sensitive to assumptions
concerning the quality of life of the HCV health states and
least sensitive to assumptions concerning the quality of
life of patients on treatment for those who receive BOC/
RGT, and quality of life of the general population for patients who receive BOC/PR48. The most favorable results
for BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 were generated when a discount rate of 0% was applied to both costs and utilities,
whereas the least favorable results were generated when
the lower bounds of the SVR health states were assumed.
The PSA allowed us to evaluate the impact of varying
the values of several parameters simultaneously on the
projected long-term costs and QALYs of each treatment
strategy at a variety of thresholds. Compared with PR48,
BOC/RGT was cost-effective in nearly 100% of the
10,000 simulations when a threshold of $50,000 was
chosen. This suggests that BOC/RGT offers the opportunity for a shorter duration of treatment than dual therapy
that is significantly more efficacious and cost-effective at a
threshold of $50,000 under a variety of assumptions.
Because of the differential treatment efficacy of dual
therapy reported in non-black and black patients, data
for these cohorts were collected and analyzed separately
in the SPRINT-2 efficacy analyses. Although the
reported SVR rates differed between the cohorts, the results of our cost-effectiveness study indicated similar
trends within the results of the two subgroups. For both
subgroup analyses by race cohort, compared to treatment with PR48, the ICER corresponding to the BOC/
RGT treatment strategy was better than the ICER

There was a greater difference in the ICERs between the
boceprevir-based treatment strategies compared to dual
therapy for the non-black subgroup than in the ICERs in
the black subgroup. This is because the efficacies between
the two boceprevir-based regimens are very similar even
though the treatment cost of BOC/PR48 is much greater
than the treatment cost of BOC/RGT. This implies that a
longer duration of treatment may not result in additional
clinical benefits. Conversely, treatment with BOC/PR48
resulted in an incremental gain of 0.21 QALYs compared
to treatment with BOC/RGT in the black population. This
implies that a longer duration of treatment with boceprevir may result in additional clinical benefit for black
patients as is supported by the cost-effectiveness frontier
(Figure 4).
The treatment strategies recommended in the FDAapproved boceprevir label include futility rules consistent
with the guidelines of AASLD [21]. The ICER for the labelbased treatment recommendation was $27,265 which
implies that the label-based treatment recommendation is
cost-effective at a reasonable threshold when compared
with dual therapy. This indicates that the boceprevir-based
treatment strategy offers great clinical benefit for the cost
that is incurred.
Compared to previously published cost-effectiveness
models [22-26], our modeling study made several updates
in the model structure and inputs. First, we incorporated
treatment strategies that include boceprevir – a recently approved protease inhibitor which offers the opportunity for a
shorter duration of therapy and significantly greater chance
of attaining a cure. In addition, we updated the transition
probabilities associated with progression of HCV, development of serious liver disease, the probability of receiving a
liver transplant, and health state costs using data that was
not previously available. Finally, unlike the majority of previous models, we included treatment of patients with cirrhosis
in our model. We assumed that cirrhotic patients achieved
a partial cure from HCV even if they attained SVR with
treatment. This feature of our model –that patients with
cirrhosis who achieve SVR are at risk of developing decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma – was not
incorporated in the majority of previous models.
After we developed our model, Liu et al. published a
cost-effectiveness modeling study that included the costs
and efficacy of recently approved protease inhibitors in
the treatment regimen [27]. Our model differs from this

modeling study in several ways. Specifically, the transition
probabilities and health state costs included in our model
are based on more recent data than those applied in the
Liu model. Unlike Liu et al. which included cost for HCV
with SVR and out-of-pocket expenses as part of the base
case scenario, we only tested the influence of cost for
HCV with SVR in the sensitivity analysis and we did not
consider out-of-pocket expenses. Although the Liu model
includes treatment of patients with cirrhosis, it was assumed that patients with cirrhosis who achieved an SVR
were permanently cured of HCV. We assumed that patients with cirrhosis achieved a partial cure from HCV
even if they attained SVR with treatment, which is consistent with recently published data [28]. Finally, we also evaluated the treatment regimen recommended by the FDA
and AASLD for boceprevir, not just the treatment regimens studied in SPRINT-2.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not
model the possibility of retreatment with antiviral drugs
that are currently available or might become available in
the near future. Assumptions could be made concerning
the timing of re-treatment in patients who received dual
therapy in SPRINT-2 using data collected from a trial in
previously treated patients (RESPOND-2) [18]. However,
the efficacy of re-treatment for patients who did not
achieve an SVR with one of the boceprevir-based regimens is unknown. Second, our model did not take into
consideration the possibility of re-infection nor retransplantation in patients who receive a liver transplant.
These patients are at increased risk for developing future
liver complications and receiving subsequent liver transplants. Since re-transplantation would occur further in
the future, its influence on costs and benefits would be
heavily discounted. This suggests that the inclusion of

re-transplantation would have a favorable but small
impact on the cost-effectiveness of boceprevir and that
the current modeling study provides a conservative estimate of the cost-effectiveness of boceprevir-based regimens. Third, our model cannot be applied to special
populations such as patients co-infected with HIV
because of lack of data on the impact of treatment with
boceprevir-based regimens at this time. Fourth, our
study applies the all-cause mortality rate to patients with
chronic HCV and to patients who attain an SVR. Subsets
of this patient population are considered high-risk and
the mortality rate of the general population may underestimate the mortality rate of the HCV treatment population. Our model also does not take into account that
patients who attain an SVR are at risk for reinfection
with HCV. This assumption may bias the results in favor
of boceprevir-based regimens since the boceprevir-based
regimens reported higher SVR rates. Sixth, our model
does not take into account that patients who do not
achieve an SVR with AV therapy may receive some
benefit, such as a slower disease progression rate. The
impact of relaxing this assumption on the results is not
clear a priori. Seventh, this analysis was done from the
payer perspective. Patients with chronic HCV or the
sequelae of cirrhosis have been shown to experience
increased work and productivity losses, suffer activity
impairment, and incur increased indirect medical costs
compared with people without HCV [61-63]. Inclusion
of such costs would result in lower ICERs for both
boceprevir-regimens compared with dual therapy since
the treatment efficacy of both BOC/RGT and BOC/
PR48 are greater than the efficacy of treatment with
PR48. Finally, all treatment characteristics are based
entirely on clinical trial data. The discontinuation
rates, which impact treatment efficacy, may differ in
clinical practice.
Conclusion
In summary, boceprevir-based regimens were projected
to substantially reduce the burden of liver-related
complications such as decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and livertransplants in treatment-naïve patients infected with
hepatitis C genotype 1. Our model also demonstrated
that boceprevir-based regimens offer patients the possibility of experiencing great clinical benefit with a
shorter duration of therapy that may minimize the
time patients experience an HCV-treatment decrement
to their quality of life. In addition both BOC/RGT and
BOC/PR48 were projected to be cost-effective from
the payer perspective at a reasonable threshold in
comparison with treatment with peginterferon and
ribavirin alone.
