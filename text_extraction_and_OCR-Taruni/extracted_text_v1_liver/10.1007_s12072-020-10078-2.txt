Abstract
Abnormal liver enzymes are seen in 20% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The etiology of elevated liver enzymes is 
thought to be multifactorial including medications and underlying liver disease. The true prevalence and clinical signifcance 
of underlying chronic liver diseases (CLD) in COVID-19 remains poorly defned. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 
we included 74 clinical studies that were identifed after a thorough literature search across three databases. The prevalence 
of CLD patients (73 studies, 24,299 patients) was 3% among all COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of CLD patients was 
similar in COVID-19 positive and negative population (pooled OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.05], p=0.10). The presence of CLD 
was signifcantly associated with more severe COVID-19 infection (pooled OR 1.48 [95% CI 1.17, 1.87], p =0.001) and 
overall mortality (pooled OR 1.78 [95% CI 1.09, 2.93], p=0.02). Additionally, there was a non-signifcant trend noted for 
increased ICU admissions and need for invasive mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients with CLD. To date, the 
clinical importance of chronic liver diseases among COVID-19 infection has remained undefned. In this novel systematic 
review and meta-analysis, the presence of underlying chronic liver disease was signifcantly associated with more severe 
COVID-19 infections and mortality.

Introduction
Abnormal liver enzymes (20%) and elevated bilirubin 
(16.7%) are common in hospitalized patients with COVID19 [1–3]. The etiology of abnormal liver enzymes is thought 
to be multifactorial, and in majority of patients, it is thought 
to be due to medications or underlying liver diseases [3].
It is not known whether patients with chronic liver disease 
(CLD) are more likely to develop COVID-19 as there is a 
paucity of data on the prevalence of CLD among patients

with COVID-19. It has been suggested that chronic liver 
disease is an established risk factor for severe COVID-19 
[4]. Although it is intuitive to believe that patients with cirrhosis, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis, are 
likely to have more severe COVID-19, there is no frm evidence to support this. In one study, only 19 of 5700 (0.4%) 
of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in NY hospitals 
had cirrhosis and only 11 (0.2%) patients had either HCV 
or HBV [5]. Similarly, only 28 of 1591 (2%) ICU admissions in Italy due to COVID-19 had chronic liver diseases. 
[6] The experience from Italy also suggests that COVID-19 
is not disproportionately more common in liver transplant 
recipients, and 3 of 200 liver transplant recipients from one 
center who were tested positive did not develop pulmonary 
disease. [7] In another study from Milan, only 8 of 640 liver 
transplant recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during 
this pandemic, and of these only 5 were hospitalized and 
none required mechanical ventilation. [8] Moreover, there 
are only limited data on the clinical outcomes of patients 
with CLD including ICU admission, mechanical intubation 
rates, or mortality.
The primary aim of this systematic review and metaanalysis is to determine the prevalence of CLD in patients 
with COVID-19 and their clinical outcomes.
Methods
Literature search
Three major databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, 
EMBASE, and medRxiv, were searched for clinical studies 
dated from January 1, 2019 to May 16, 2020. In an efort to 
broadly identify studies detailing CLD and COVID-19, the 
following search criteria were utilized: “(coronavirus OR 
Cov2 OR (Cov AND 2) OR ncov2 OR (ncov AND 2) OR 
(sars AND cov AND 2) OR (sars AND cov2) OR ’Sars Cov 
2′ OR COVID OR (covid AND 19) OR ’COVID 19′) AND 
(chronic AND liver AND disease*) OR cirrhosis OR (hepatitis AND b) OR (hepatitis AND c) OR HBV OR HCV OR 
(alcohol AND liver AND disease) OR (alcoholic AND liver 
AND disease) OR ALD OR (nonalcoholic AND fatty AND 
liver) OR NAFLD OR (nonalcoholic AND steatohepatitis) 
OR (liver AND cancer) OR (hepatocellular AND carcinoma) 
OR HCC.” This meta-analysis was conducted according to 
the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] [9] and meta-analysis of observational studies and epidemiology [MOOSE] [10].
Inclusion criteria
Articles and clinical trials that met the following inclusion 
criteria were eligible for this meta-analysis: (1) studies 
performed in adult, human subjects; (2) studies reporting 
CLD among patients with COVID-19. No preference was 
given upon study design on the initial search strategy, and 
all types of studies including randomized controlled trials, 
non-randomized studies, cohort studies, and case–control 
studies were considered.
Exclusion criteria
Studies with the following characteristics were excluded 
from this meta-analysis: (1) studies performed among nonhuman subjects; (2) studies that were not a clinical trial, such 
as a review paper or letter; (3) studies that were out of scope 
of the study question detailed above; (4) studies that lacked 
proper controls; (5) studies that did not provide raw data in 
order to perform quantitative meta-analysis; (6) studies that 
were duplicates.
Study defnitions
As mentioned above, CLD was defned by patients having 
any of the following diagnoses: cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease 
(ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Severe and critical COVID-19 infection was defned by 
criteria set forth in the WHO situation report and interim 
guidance [11]. Severe cases defned as any one of the following: respiratory distress with RR>30 breaths per minute; mean oxygen saturation [SpO2]<93% on room air; 
or arterial blood oxygen [PaO2]/oxygen concentration 
[FiO2]≤ 300 mmHg. Critical illness was defned by the 
presence of any one of the following: admission to ICU; 
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; shock; 
other multisystem organ failure requiring ICU level of 
care. Non-severe or mild cases of COVID-19 were defned 
as patients who tested positive for COVID-19, but did not 
meet criteria for severe or critical cases and were either 
asymptomatic or the symptoms from their infection were 
self-limiting.
Statistical analysis
This meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 
[RevMan, software version 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, Denmark, 2014]. Odds Ratios [OR] were used as a 
summary measure for dichotomous data. 95% confdence 
intervals [CI] were reported for all measures. Data were 
considered statistically insignifcant if OR includes 1.00 or 
p>0.05. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I
2
statistic. I
2
 values of 0–25%, 25–50%, 50–75%, and>75%

were awarded values of homogeneity, mild heterogeneity, 
moderate heterogeneity, and high heterogeneity, respectively. If signifcant heterogeneity was present [I
2
 ≥ 50%], 
the random efects model was used to pool the efect sizes 
of included studies and subgroup analyses; if no signifcant 
heterogeneity was found [I
2<50%], the fxed efects model 
was utilized. Publication bias was determined by visual 
inspection of funnel plots, which were calculated based 
on logarithmic ORs plotted against their standard errors 
[12]. Asymmetric funnel plots were deemed to represent 
studies with high risk of bias.
Results
Study selection
Overall, 437 clinical studies were identifed for inclusion 
based upon the predefned search criteria. After a thorough 
literature appraisal and implementation of the exclusion criteria, 74 studies were fnally included in this meta-analysis 
(Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 2).
Prevalence of CLD among patients with COVID‑19
Three studies (4221 patients) had compared the prevalence 
of CLD among COVID-19 positive patients and negative 
controls (Fig. 2). The prevalence of CLD patients was similar in COVID-19 positive and negative population with

pooled OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.05; p=0.10; I
2=0%]. In 
73 studies (24,299 patients), the prevalence of CLD among 
patients positive for COVID-19 (regardless of the presence 
of negative controls) was 0.03 [95% CI 0.03, 0.04] (Table 1).
Clinical outcomes of patients with CLD 
and COVID‑19
Signifcantly greater severe and/or critical illness events 
were present among COVID-19 patients with CLD when 
compared to those without CLD (pooled OR 1.48 [95% CI 
1.17, 1.87]; p=0.001; I
2=10%) (Fig. 3). There were no 
signifcant diferences in ICU admissions in COVID-19 
patients with CLD when compared to patients without CLD 
(pooled OR 1.38 [95% CI 0.88, 2.17]; p=0.17; I
2=0%), but 
there was a trend, and not statistically signifcant, towards 
increased rate of invasive mechanical ventilation among 
COVID-19 patients with CLD (pooled OR 2.22 [95% CI 
0.67, 7.42]; p=0.19; I
2=36%) (Fig. 4). The overall mortality was signifcantly higher in COVID-19 patients with CLD 
when compared to COVID-19 patients without CLD (pooled 
OR 1.78 [95% CI 1.09, 2.93]; p=0.02; I
2=0%) (Fig. 3). 
Publication bias
Funnel plots were created for the outcomes of this metaanalysis and reported in Supplemental Figs. 1–3. No asymmetry was noted in the funnel plots to suggest a signifcant 
degree of publication bias.
Discussion
Our meta-analysis showed that there was no increased risk 
of COVID-19 in patients with CLD. However, patients with 
CLD were more likely to have severe or critical COVID-19 
and they were also more likely to have a higher mortality 
when compared to those without CLD.
Recent recommendations made by the AASLD Expert 
Panel afrm an increased healthcare burden among COVID19 positive patients with CLD [13]. Although it is intuitive 
to believe that patients with CLD are likely to have more 
severe COVID-19, the above assumptions were made in the 
absence of robust clinical data and were largely based on 
expert opinion.
Previous two large studies outside China also appear to 
suggest that the prevalence of CLD is not higher in hospitalized patients [5, 6]. Our meta-analysis supports those 
observations. Mild elevation of liver enzymes is common, 
especially in severe COVID-19, and it is thought to be multifactorial, and mostly medication related [1, 3]. Our study 
provides important epidemiological information on the comparative prevalence of CLD in patients with and without 
COVID-19. After meticulously identifying studies among 
the primary literature, no signifcant diference was identifed among the studies comparing the prevalence of CLD 
among patients with or without COVID-19. The overall 
prevalence of CLD was only 3% across all studies characterizing COVID-19 positive patients, and this is similar to 
the reported prevalence of CLD in hospitalized patients in 
New York and ICU patients in Italy [5, 6] Some studies from 
China had reported a higher prevalence mostly because of 
chronic hepatitis B in that population. It is very true that 
retrospective nature of most studies and the general lack 
of predefned diagnoses for CLD among studies may have 
underestimated the true prevalence of CLD in COVID-19.
Our study, however, showed that those with CLD are 
more likely to have more severe or critical COVID-19 illness when compared to those without CLD, and moreover, 
those with CLD are more likely to have a higher mortality. 
An EMR based, propensity matched, study had recently 
reported higher mortality in 250 patients with CLD and 
our fndings corroborate it [14]. Moreover, meta-analyses 
of early data, one based on 11 observational studies [15] 
and another one based on 22 studies [16], had also come 
to similar conclusions. We can only speculate that some of 
these observations could be related to decompensation precipitated by COVID-19 in those with advanced cirrhosis or 
perhaps related other comorbidities in the population with 
liver disease. We need more granular data to make any 
frm conclusions. Our data have also demonstrated a trend 
towards an increased frequency of ICU admissions and 
requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous 
studies had reported higher prevalence of liver injury in

those with severe COVID-19 and this could be major confounder of mortality in patients with CLD [2].
Despite the novel fndings presented, in addition to minimal heterogeneity across studies, this systematic review 
and meta-analyses have some limitations. Most of the 
included studies were retrospective and based on hospitalized patients. These studies also may have under-reported 
CLD among comorbidities since CLD was not the primary 
focus of their studies and moreover, there was no predefned defnition for CLD in these studies. In addition, the 
majority of studies did not stratify CLD patients based on 
the etiology of CLD, and most studies were from China, 
where chronic hepatitis B is more prevalent. In spite of 
the above limitations, this systematic review and metaanalysis provides useful information on the prevalence 
and complication of COVID-19 infection in those with 
CLD, and highlights the importance of prospective casecontrolled studies that include both outpatients and hospitalized patients.
