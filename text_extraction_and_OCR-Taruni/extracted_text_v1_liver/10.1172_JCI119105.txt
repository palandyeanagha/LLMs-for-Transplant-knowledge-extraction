Abstract
FK506 (tacrolimus) is an immunosuppressive drug which
interrupts Ca21-calmodulin–calcineurin signaling pathways
in T lymphocytes, thereby blocking antigen activation of T cell
early activation genes. Regulation of insulin gene expression
in the b cell may also involve Ca21-signaling pathways and
FK506 has been associated with insulin-requiring diabetes
mellitus during clinical use. The purpose of this study was
to characterize the effects of FK506 on human insulin gene
transcription, insulin mRNA levels, and insulin secretion
using as a model the HIT-T15 b cell line. FK506 had no
acute effect on insulin secretion in the HIT cell, but caused a
reversible time- and dose-dependent (1029–1026
 M) decrease
in HIT cell insulin secretion. Decreased insulin secretion in
the presence of FK506 was also accompanied by a dosedependent decrease in HIT cell insulin content, insulin
mRNA levels, and expression of a human insulin promoterchloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene.
FK506 decreased HIT cell expression of the human insulin
promoter-CAT reporter gene by 40% in the presence of both
low (0.4 mM) at high (20 mM) glucose concentrations. Western blot analysis of HIT cell proteins gave evidence for the
presence of calcineurin in the HIT cell. These findings suggest that FK506 may have direct effects to reversibly inhibit
insulin gene transcription, leading to a decline in insulin
mRNA levels, insulin synthesis, and ultimately insulin secretion. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:2786–2793.) Key words:

Introduction
Insulin gene expression and insulin secretion appear to be
coordinately regulated in the b cell: metabolic, neural, or hormonal signals that increase or decrease insulin secretion often
have analogous effects on expression of the insulin gene (1–10).
For example, changes in the level of extracellular glucose, the
most important regulator of insulin secretion, produce concomitant changes in the level of insulin gene expression and ultimately the rate of insulin synthesis (1–6).
The cellular mechanisms that translate changes in extracellular glucose or other signals into changes in the rate of insulin
release have been extensively studied. Relatively little is
known, however, about the cellular mechanisms that regulate
insulin gene expression (1, 11). Potential mediators involved in
regulation of insulin gene transcription include Ca21, cAMP,
and phosphoinositide/protein kinase C signaling pathways (1,
6, 12–14). Ca21-dependent second messenger pathways, in particular, have been proposed to play a key role in insulin gene
regulation (6, 12), although this remains an area of active debate (13, 14).
FK506 (tacrolimus) is an immunosuppressive drug that acts
in part by blocking antigen-stimulated expression of the interleukin-2 gene and other early activation genes in T cells (15–17).
Antigen activation of T cells is a Ca21-mediated process that
involves Ca21/calmodulin activation of a serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin. FK506 and the structurally unrelated
drug cyclosporin A block Ca21-mediated interleukin-2 gene
transcription by preventing Ca21/calmodulin activation of calcineurin (18).
Use of FK506 in human organ transplantation has been associated with a 10–30% incidence of diabetes mellitus and
FK506 and cyclosporin A have recently been reported to decrease insulin mRNA levels in studies using rat islets or insulin-secreting tumor cell lines (19–24). These observations suggest that FK506 may have direct effects to inhibit insulin gene
transcription. We, therefore, studied effects of FK506 on insulin secretion, synthesis, and human insulin gene expression in
the HIT cell, a glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting islet cell
line (25).
Methods
Cell culture. HIT-T15 cells between passages 65 and 80 were routinely grown in 5% CO2
/95% humidified air at 378C, maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium containing 11.1 mM glucose and 10% fetal calf
serum.
Insulin secretion and cellular insulin content. For static insulin secretion experiments, 1 3 106
 HIT cells/well were plated in 12-well
plates and grown for varying periods of time in culture medium supplemented with vehicle only (ethanol) or FK506. Static incubations
were carried out in the absence of FK506 or vehicle for 4 h in 1 ml
Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 119 mM NaCl, 4.74 mM KCl, 2.54
mM CaCl2, 1.19 mM MgSO4, 1.19 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3
with 10 mM Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 in 5% CO2/
95% humidified air, 378C. At the end of the incubation period, buffer
was removed, centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant frozen at
2208C for insulin assay (26). For measurement of cellular insulin content, HIT cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml phosphate buffered saline,
scraped in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline, homogenized by ultrasonic

FK506 and Insulin Gene Expression 2787
disintegration at 48C, and the homogenate assayed for insulin. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry. FK506 was dissolved in
ethanol at a stock concentration of 1 mM and stored in the dark at 48C.
Insulin mRNA analysis. HIT cells, 5 3 106 cells/dish, were cultured in 60-mm dishes for 96 h in 5 ml culture media supplemented
with vehicle only or FK506 at various concentrations. Media was
changed daily. Total HIT cell RNA was isolated by guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol extraction as previously described (7). Insulin mRNA
was quantified by slot-blot analysis using the method of White and
Bancroft (27). Briefly, total HIT cell RNA was denatured in 12 3
SSC, 14.8% formaldehyde at 658C for 5 min. Total RNA, 2.5–10 mg/
slot, was then applied to a nylon hybridization membrane and prehybridized overnight at 428C in 50% formamide, 5 3 SSC, 5 3 Denhardt’s solution, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS and
0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. 32P-labeled cDNA for Syrian hamster preproinsulin was added and hybridized overnight at
428C. The membrane was washed in 2 3 SSC, 0.1% SDS three times
for 10 min at room temperature and in 0.2 3 SSC, 0.1% SDS two
times at 658C for 30 min. The membrane was exposed to X-ray film
overnight at 2708C with intensifying screens. An identical membrane
was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA for human b actin as a control
(27). Insulin and b actin mRNA levels were quantified from autoradiograms by computer-assisted videodensitometry. Results are expressed as a densitometric ratio of insulin mRNA/b actin mRNA.

Southern California School of Medicine (Los Angeles, CA).
Cell transfection experiments. HIT cells, 1.8 3 106 cells/35 mm
well, were plated in 3 ml culture media supplemented with vehicle
only or FK506 and cultured for 96 h with daily media changes. After
the initial 72 h culture, cells were transiently transfected with a human insulin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)1
 reporter gene via liposome-mediated transfection as previously described (9). This reporter gene contains 327 bp of the 59-flanking
region and 30 bp of exon 1 of the human insulin gene inserted directly
upstream of the CAT reporter gene in a promoterless plasmid,
pCAT(An) (9). Cells were transfected with 1 mg/well reporter gene
plasmid in 4 mg/well of Lipofectin reagent (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). After an additional 24 h culture, HIT cell extracts were
prepared and assayed for CAT enzyme activity (9). In some experiments, HIT cells were cultured in media containing low (0.4 mM) glucose for 24 h before transfection. Cells were then transfected with the
insulin-CAT reporter gene and cultured for an additional 24 h in culture media with either 0.4 or 20 mM glucose supplemented with either vehicle or FK506. Cell extracts were then prepared and assayed
as before. As a control for nonspecific effects of FK506 on reporter
gene activity, separate wells of HIT cells were also transfected with
plasmid (10 mg/well) containing the nontissue specific herpes virus
thymidine kinase promoter linked to the CAT gene (TKCAT) (28).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. HIT cells were exposed to
vehicle or 1027
 M FK506 for 24 h and nuclear extracts were prepared
(29). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out to measure binding activity of nuclear extracts with double stranded oligonucleotide probes to the human insulin A3 (-230 to -201), CRE/
CAAT (-194 to -165), A2 (GGI, -142 to -122), GGII (-153 to -124),
and A5/core enhancer (-322 to -296) elements, and the rat insulin II
C1 (-126 to -101) and rat insulin E1 (-104 to -85) binding sites as previously described (30, 31).
Detection of calcineurin subunits in HIT cells. HIT cell extracts
were prepared by suspending HIT cells (z 2 3 106 cells) in 80 ml of
cell lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% NP-40; 0.25% sodium
deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EGTA; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride; 1 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin. After addition of 20 ml of loading buffer (312.5 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% b-mercaptoethanol and 50% glycerol) extracts were boiled for 5 min and proteins separated by SDSPAGE through a 12% acrylamide gel. Approximately 300 mg of protein was applied to each lane. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon
P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by semi-dry transfer
and then subjected to Western analysis.
For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked as previously described (32). Polyclonal bovine brain calcineurin antiserum (Upstate
Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used at 1 mg/ml. Immunoreactivity was detected by applying a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab9)2
 (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and then adding a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Corp., Rockford, IL). After
adding the chemiluminescent substrate, the membranes were exposed to X-OMAT AR X-ray film for various times ranging from 1 to
20 min. Purified bovine brain calcineurin (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO) was included as a control.
Statistical analysis. Differences between vehicle and FK506 treatment were compared using Student’s t test for unpaired data, or, in
the case of dose-response experiments, ANOVA using a one-factor
model followed by Fisher’s protected least squares difference
(PLSD) for comparison between treatments. Data are presented as
means6SE.
Results
Lack of acute effect of FK506 on insulin secretion. To determine
whether FK506 or the ethanol vehicle might have a direct,
acute effect to alter insulin secretion, HIT cells grown in
RPMI-1640 in the absence of any drug were acutely exposed
to increasing concentrations of FK506 in 4-h static incubation
experiments. In the presence of 11.1 mM glucose, HIT cell
insulin secretion increased fivefold over basal (absence of glucose) in 4-h static incubations (7406170 vs 3,8106647 mU insulin/mg protein, P # 0.01). FK506 at increasing concentrations up to 1 mM had no effect on glucose stimulation of
insulin release in these acute experiments (insulin secretion in
the presence of 1 mM FK506: 4,1006680 mU/mg protein).
Effect of more prolonged exposure to FK506 on insulin secretion and cellular insulin content. To determine whether more
prolonged exposure to FK506 might alter HIT cell insulin release, HIT cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of vehicle or FK506 at increasing concentrations from 1029
 to 1026 M.
HIT cell media was changed every 24 h and insulin secretion
into the media over the preceding 24 h was measured. At the
end of the experiment, intracellular insulin content was also
measured. FK506 had no significant effect on media insulin
levels during the initial 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1). However, between 24–48 h there was a significant dose-dependent effect of
FK506 on media insulin levels (P # 0.002, ANOVA, n 5 3).
There was a further decrease in media insulin levels during the
48–72 h exposure period (P # 0.0001, ANOVA). The maximal
decrease in HIT cell insulin release occurred at 1027
 M FK506
and was 5763% of control levels after 72 h exposure. Subsequent experiments in which HIT cells were chronically cultured up to 4 wk in FK506 revealed no further decrease in insulin release (data not shown). Thus the inhibitory effect of
FK506 appeared to be maximal after 72 h exposure.
Intracellular insulin content was also significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner following 72 h exposure
to FK506 (Fig. 2). The decrease in insulin content paralleled
the decrease in insulin release and represented a 35–40% decrease in insulin content relative to control levels. FK506 had

no effect on HIT cell viability as assessed by HIT cell protein
content at the end of 72 h culture (vehicle only: 0.29560.028,
FK506 1029 M: 0.29360.032, FK506 1027 M: 0.26960.037 mg/
well).
Reversibility of FK506 effect on insulin secretion. To determine whether the effects of FK506 on insulin secretion were reversible and not simply a toxic effect of the drug on cell function
or viability, duplicate sets of HIT cells were cultured for 72 h in
media supplemented with either vehicle or FK506 (1 mM). After 72 h, one set of HIT cells was washed to remove any drug
and static incubation experiments were performed in the absence of FK506 or vehicle. For the second set of HIT cells, media was changed and cells were cultured an additional 72 h in
the absence of FK506. Static incubation experiments were
then carried out as before. As shown in Fig. 3, HIT cells cultured for 72 h in FK506 showed a 35–40% decrease in glucoseinduced insulin release during static incubations (Fig. 3 A).
However, this effect was completely reversed after an additional 72-h culture in the absence of drug (Fig. 3 B).
Effect of FK506 on levels of HIT cell insulin mRNA. To determine whether FK506 might impair insulin synthesis via effects on insulin mRNA levels, insulin and b actin mRNA levels
were quantitated by slot-blot analysis of total HIT cell RNA
from cells cultured for 96 h in media supplemented with various concentrations of FK506. Insulin secretion into the culture
media was also measured over the final 24 h of culture. Insulin
secretion and insulin mRNA both significantly decreased in
the presence of increasing concentrations of FK506 (1029
 to
1027 M) (P # 0.001, n 5 6 for both secretion and mRNA level)
(Fig. 4). FK506 at 1027
 M reduced both insulin secretion and
insulin mRNA levels by z 45%.
Effect of FK506 on HIT cell expression of human insulinCAT reporter gene. To determine whether FK506 might lower
HIT cell levels of insulin mRNA by inhibiting transcription of
the insulin gene, we studied the effect of FK506 on HIT cell
expression of a human insulin-CAT reporter gene in transient
transfection experiments. We have previously reported that
HIT cell expression of this insulin promoter-driven construct is
glucose-responsive and correlates with changes in HIT cell
mRNA levels in a variety of experimental conditions (9, 33).
In the current studies, HIT cells were cultured for 72 h in media supplemented with vehicle or FK506. HIT cells were then
transfected with the human insulin-CAT reporter gene using a
liposome technique. After an additional 24 h culture, culture
media was sampled for insulin secretion and CAT activity was
measured in HIT cell extracts. Both insulin secretion into the
culture media and CAT activity in HIT cell extracts decreased
significantly (P # 0.02 and P # 0.01, respectively, n 5 8) and in
a dose-dependent manner in response to increasing concentrations of FK506 (Fig. 5). FK506 at 1027
 M reduced insulin secretin by 40% and insulin-CAT reporter gene expression by 30%.

of vehicle or increasing concentrations of FK506. HIT cell media 
were replaced every 24 h and insulin secretion was measured in the 
media. There was a significant time- and dose-dependent effect of 
FK506 to reduce insulin secretion into HIT cell media first apparent 
during the 24–48 h exposure period (P # 0.002 for FK506 effect, 
ANOVA, n 5 3). The decrease in media insulin levels was even 
greater during the 48–72 h exposure period (P # 0.0001, ANOVA). 
Media insulin levels were significantly less than control at every 
FK506 concentration during the 24–48 h and 48–72 h exposure periods (P # 0.05, Fisher’s PLSD).

had no significant effect on HIT cell expression of the control
reporter gene TKCAT (relative TKCAT expression: 1.060.2
vs 0.860.2, control vs FK506, n 5 3, P 5 0.44).
It is well established that insulin promoter activity requires
the interactions of trans-acting factors to their cis-regulatory
binding sites. Best characterized of these interactions include
the binding of STF-1, the RIPE 3b1 activator, and the ICE activator to the A1 and A3 elements, C1 element, and E1 and E2
elements, respectively. To determine whether FK506 might alter binding of trans-activating factors to their respective insulin
promoter sequences we performed electrophoretic mobility
shift assays using DNA probes corresponding to the human
A3 element (-230/-201), rat insulin II C1 element (-126/-101),
and rat insulin II E1 element (-104/-85). In addition, we examined whether FK506 might alter binding to the human insulin
gene CRE/CAAT element (-194/-165), human A2 element
(GGI, -142/-122), human GGII element (-153/-124), human
A5/core enhancer elements (-322/-296). Nuclear extracts isolated from HIT cells cultured for 24 h in the presence of vehicle or FK506 showed no alterations in binding activities to any
of these elements (data not shown).
Detection of calcineurin in HIT cells. To determine whether
calcineurin is present in the HIT cell, Western blot analysis of
HIT cell proteins was performed using an antibody raised
against bovine brain calcineurin (Fig. 7). In HIT cell extracts,
this antibody detected bands corresponding to both the calcineurin A (61 kD) and calcineurin B (19 kD) subunits which
make up the calcineurin heterodimer (Fig. 7) (34).

sets of HIT cells were cultured for 72 h in 1 mM FK506 or vehicle. (A) 
After 72 h, cells were washed to remove any drug or vehicle and 4-h 
static incubation experiments were carried out with one set of HIT 
cells at 0, 3 and 11.1 mM glucose as described in Methods. (*P , 0.05 
vs control, n 5 3). (B) In the duplicate set of HIT cells, following the 
initial 72 h exposure to FK506 the media was changed and the cells 
were cultured an additional 72 h in media in the absence of drug. After this wash-out period, 4-h static incubation experiments were repeated as before. The inhibitory effect of FK506 on insulin secretion 
was completely reversed in these cells.
Figure 4. Effect of FK506 on HIT cell insulin mRNA levels. HIT 
cells were cultured for 96 h in vehicle or increasing concentrations of 
FK506. Total HIT cell mRNA was extracted and insulin and b actin 
mRNA levels were determined by Northern slot-blot analysis with 
computer-assisted videodensitometry. Data are expressed as ratio of 
insulin/actin mRNA. Insulin secretion into the HIT cell media was 
also determined over the final 24 h of culture. (P # 0.001 for FK506

gene in the presence of high and low glucose levels was also assessed after short-term (24 h) exposure to drug. In these experiments, HIT cells were first cultured in media with low glucose
(0.4 mM) concentration for 24 h before the transfection period. Cells were then transfected in the presence of vehicle or
FK506 (1027
 M) in media with either 0.4 or 20 mM glucose to
determine whether FK506 would block the normal glucoseinduced increase in reporter gene expression. As shown in
Fig. 6, when exposed to 20 mM glucose HIT cell expression of
the human insulin-CAT reporter gene increased threefold relative to the basal condition (0.4 mM glucose). FK506 inhibited
human insulin-CAT reporter gene expression by 40% under
conditions of both high and low glucose concentrations. FK506

Discussion
FK506 is a drug known to inhibit Ca21-mediated stimulation of
gene expression in T cells and is also a drug associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus in clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether FK506 might have
inhibitory effects on insulin gene expression in the b cell which
would then lead to decreased insulin synthesis and secretion.
Using the HIT cell model, we observed a reversible, time- and
dose-dependent effect of FK506 to lower insulin secretion. Decreased insulin secretion was accompanied by a decline in HIT
cell insulin content and insulin mRNA levels when cells were
cultured in the presence of FK506, suggesting that FK506 decreased insulin synthesis through effects at the level of insulin
gene transcription or posttranscriptional processing. In transient transfection experiments, we found that FK506 produced
a rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of HIT cell expression of a
human insulin promoter-CAT reporter gene. FK506 inhibition
of human insulin reporter gene expression was apparent
within 24 h of exposure of HIT cells to the drug and preceded
any measurable effect of FK506 on insulin secretion. These
data suggest that FK506 lowers HIT cell insulin mRNA levels,
at least in part, through inhibitory effects on insulin gene transcription.
The observed effect of FK506 to decrease insulin secretion
does not appear to be due to a direct action of the drug to inhibit insulin release, nor to a toxic effect of the drug on cell
growth or function. Acute administration of the drug in static
incubation experiments in doses up to 1 mM had no effect on
insulin secretion in response to glucose. More prolonged cell
culture in the presence of drug for 48–72 h was required before
the full effects of the drug on insulin secretion became apparent. Prolonged culture of HIT cells in FK506 had no effect on
cell growth or viability as assessed by protein content. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of FK506 on insulin secretion was
fully reversible when HIT cells were cultured in the absence of
drug.
The half-life of insulin mRNA has been estimated to be
z 30 h in both the HIT cell and primary islet cultures (8, 35).
Thus, the time dependence of the FK506 effect on insulin secretion and insulin mRNA levels would be consistent with an
action of the drug at the level of insulin gene expression. The
transient transfection experiments suggest FK506 directly decreases the rate of insulin gene transcription, although it is possible the drug may have additional effects to lower insulin
mRNA such as altering the rate of insulin mRNA metabolism.
Both FK506 and cyclosporin A have been associated with
decreased glucose tolerance following solid organ transplantation (19–22, 36–39). Several recent randomized trials comparing these two drugs suggest hyperglycemia may occur more
frequently in patients treated with FK506 (36–39). In general,
hyperglycemia associated with FK506 appears to be dose related and reversible (20, 36, 39, 40). The majority of studies
that have examined the hyperglycemic effects of FK506 sugFigure 5. Effect of FK506 on HIT cell expression of human insulinCAT reporter gene. HIT cells were cultured for 96 h in vehicle, 1 or 
100 nM FK506. During the final 24 h of culture, HIT cells were transfected with a human insulin-CAT reporter gene as described in Methods. After 24 h, CAT activity (percent conversion [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol) was measured in HIT cell 
extracts. Insulin secretion into the culture media was also measured 
over the final 24 h of the experiment. There was a significant effect of 
FK506 on both human insulin-CAT reporter gene expression (P # 
0.01) and insulin secretion (P # 0.02), ANOVA, n 5 8.
Figure 6. Effect of FK506 on HIT cell expression of human insulinCAT reporter gene during 24-h exposure. HIT cells were cultured in 
low (0.4 mM) glucose media for 24 h, then cultured in 0.4 or 20 mM 
glucose during subsequent 24 h transfection experiments conducted 
in the presence of vehicle or 1027 M FK506. Human insulin-CAT reporter gene expression increased threefold in response to high glucose. FK506 significantly inhibited human insulin-CAT reporter gene 
expression by 40% under both high (20 mM) and low (0.4 mM) glucose conditions (*P # 0.05, vehicle vs FK506, n 5 3).

FK506 and Insulin Gene Expression 2791
gest the drug acts at the level of the islet to decrease insulin secretion, although alterations in peripheral insulin sensitivity
may also play a role (37). FK506 has been shown to decrease
glucose-induced insulin secretion in both intact animals as well
as isolated islet and perfused pancreas preparations (40–43).
Few studies have attempted to define the time course of
the FK506 effect or identify the site of action of the drug
within the b cell. Carroll et al. (44) reported an acute effect of
FK506 at high concentrations (. 100 nM) to inhibit insulin secretion from isolated rat islets. There was little effect of the
drug at lower concentrations during 24-h culture experiments.
Herold et al. examined the effect of cyclosporin A and an
FK506 analog, L-683,590, on glucose-induced insulin secretion
in the bTC3 mouse islet tumor line and in rat islets (23). Similar to our results with FK506, these investigators found no
acute effect of either drug on insulin secretion; rather, significant effects on insulin secretion were seen only after prolonged
(48 h) exposure. As was the case in our studies with FK506,
both drugs also decreased insulin mRNA levels in bTC3 cells.
Recently, Tamura et al. reported a reversible decrease in insulin mRNA levels in islets isolated from rats treated for 14 days
with FK506 (24). Although the dose of FK506 used in these
studies (10 mg/kg per d) has previously been reported to produce histologic changes suggestive of islet toxicity (42), the
findings of Tamura et al. are consistent with the observations
of Herold et al. and our own findings reported here (23, 24).
We are unaware of previous studies that have investigated
the effect of FK506 on insulin gene transcription. Our studies
were prompted by the observation that a major mechanism of
action of both FK506 and cyclosporin A is inhibition of Ca21-
mediated activation of specific T cell genes (15–17). This inhibition of gene expression appears to depend on the ability of
these drugs to bind to endogenous cellular proteins (immunophilins) and to inactivate a Ca21/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. While elucidation of this novel
intracellular Ca21-mediated signaling pathway was primarily
carried out in T cells, it is now known that the immunophilins
are ubiquitous proteins and that calcineurin is present in a variety of tissues, including the pancreatic islet (45) and the HIT
cell (current study). Recent studies in renal tubular cells and
PC12 cells, a neuroendocrine cell line, suggest a role for Ca21-
mediated regulation of gene transcription via the Ca21/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway in these nonimmune cells (46, 47).
Schwaninger et al. reported that potassium-induced membrane
depolarization stimulated Ca21-mediated transcription of the
glucagon gene via a cAMP-responsive element (48). This transcriptional activation involved calcineurin phosphatase activity
and was inhibited by both FK506 and cyclosporin A. Thus, it
appears likely that the Ca21/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway
first identified in the T cell may be an important pathway for
Ca21-mediated regulation of gene transcription in a wide variety of cell types.
In our studies, inhibition of insulin promoter-CAT reporter
gene expression by FK506 correlated with decreased insulin
mRNA levels and ultimately decreased insulin secretion. This
is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating that in the steady-state, insulin biosynthesis and secretion
are predominantly determined by levels of insulin mRNA (1).
Thus in the b cell, insulin synthesis and secretion appear to be
coordinately regulated events. Since insulin secretion is a
Ca21-dependent event, it would certainly be plausible that regulation of insulin gene transcription may involve Ca21-mediated mechanisms. One such mechanism may involve a b cell
Ca21/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway.
Ca21-mediated regulation of gene transcription may involve multiple mechanisms within a given cell via activation of
calmodulin-dependent kinases and phosphatases (47, 49).
Regulation of insulin gene expression may also involve other
cellular pathways such as the adenylate cyclase/cAMP or phosphoinositide/protein kinase C second messenger systems (1,
13, 14). At the molecular level, multiple cis-acting DNA sequences in the insulin promoter and trans-acting nuclear proteins have been implicated in both b cell specific and glucoseinducible regulation of insulin gene expression (1, 2, 11). Thus
it is likely that multiple mechanisms are involved in regulation
of insulin gene expression.
In summary, we have demonstrated in a glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting b cell line that FK506 decreases insulin
secretion in a reversible, time- and dose-dependent manner
which correlates with inhibitory effects of the drug on human
insulin gene expression. These data suggest a possible explanaFigure 7. Detection of calcineurin in HIT cells. Purified bovine brain

of this drug. FK506 and related drugs may also prove to be
valuable tools in further defining the cellular pathways that
transmit the glucose metabolic signal to the b cell nucleus to
regulate insulin gene expression and insulin biosynthesis.
