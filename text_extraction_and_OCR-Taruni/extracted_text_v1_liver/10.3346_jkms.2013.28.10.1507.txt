Hepatoportal Sclerosis in Childhood: Descriptive Analysis of 
12 Patients
Hepatoportal sclerosis (HPS) is defined as sclerosis of portal areas in the absence of 
cirrhosis. There is little information about HPS in children in the literature. The aim of this 
study was to describe the clinical presentation, associated disorders, laboratory 
characteristics and outcome of children who were diagnosed as HPS. This study included 
12 children diagnosed as HPS by the Pathology Department between 2005 and 2011. Data 
were collected from the gastroenterology clinic charts retrospectively, including 
demographics, presentation characteristics, laboratory data and recent status of patients. 
Twelve patients were enrolled (6 girls, 6 boys). The median age of patients was 13.5 yr. 
Median age at the time of biopsy was 11 yr. Four patients had splenomegaly, 3 had 
esophageal varices, one had hepatopulmonary syndrome and had been transplanted. 
Smooth muscle antibody was found positive in 4 patients, without autoimmune hepatitis 
findings in liver biopsy. One patient had celiac disease and another patient had positive 
celiac disease serology but pathology findings. Another patient had Turner’s syndrome. 
Mean follow-up time was 39 months (3.3 yr) after biopsy. Hepatoportal sclerosis does not 
necessarily present with portal hypertension in children.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE 
Pediatrics
INTRODUCTION
Hepatoportal sclerosis (HPS) is a rare disease with unknown 
etiology. Historically, Banti (1) described this disease as morbus Banti in 1910. In 1965, Mikkelsen et al. (2) described 36 patients with splenomegaly and noncirrhotic portal hypertension 
and called this entity hepatoportal sclerosis. HPS is defined as 
sclerosis of portal areas in the absence of cirrhosis with patent 
portal and hepatic veins (2). There are various synonyms used 
to describe HPS like idiopathic portal hypertension, regenerative nodular hyperplasia, benign intrahepatic portal hypertension, non-cirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension with portal fibrosis and incomplete 
septal cirrhosis (3). Mostly, case series were reported from India 
and Japan (4-6). There are also very well documented case series from the West (7). Finally, Schouten et al. (8) have published an extensive review and diagnostic criteria for idiopathic 
noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) in 2011. 
In this study we aimed to describe the presenting symptoms, 
clinical and laboratory findings and interesting associations of 
patients with findings of HPS in their liver biopsies. Some associations we are describing here were not described before in 
patients with HPS. We also wanted to find out, if hepatoportal 
sclerosis as a pathological diagnosis represented a uniform clinical presentation and outcome in pediatric population. All, but 
one, patients in this cohort had their liver biopsies done in our 
tertiary care institution due to various indications. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with HPS 
between 2005 and 2011. Patients, who underwent liver biopsy 
due to various etiologies in our tertiary care centre and consequently reported as having findings consistent with hepatoportal sclerosis or portal venopathy by the Department of Pathology, were included. Seventeen patients’ charts have been reviewed. One patient with Abernethy malformation in CT Angiography and additional 3 patients, who had either partial or complete portal vein thrombosis, were excluded from the study. One 
additional patient has been excluded from the study because of 
the missing data.
Patient demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, imaging studies and outcome were noted from the clinic 
charts. Liver biopsies were done for all but one patient at the 
same institution with Menghini technique. All specimens were 
fixed in Bouin’s solution and embedded in paraffin. Liver biopsy specimens then were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson’s trichrome and immunohistochemical CD34 stain, demonstrating periportal sinusoidal endothelization. Pathology 
specimens were reviewed by single experienced pediatric pa-

thologist. All pathology specimens were examined to rule out 
cirrhosis, congenital hepatic fibrosis and hepatitis of viral, autoimmune and toxic origin.
Ethics statement
Ethics approval for this retrospective chart review analysis was 
exempted of review by institutional review board according to 
the law published in 2011 by the Turkish Ministry of Health. 
Consent from parents was not obtained due to same regulation. 
However, no additional blood tests or any analysis were done to 
collect data for this study.
RESULTS
Twelve patients were enrolled in this study (n = 12, 6 boys, 6 
girls). Patient demographics and laboratory findings are shown 
in Table 1 and 2. Median age at presentation was 10.7 yr (range 
6 months-17.7 yr). Mean follow up time was 39 months (range 
21-96 months). Two patients had weight percentile below the 
3rd percentile (1 boy, 1 girl) at presentation. Five patients had 
incidentally discovered elevated liver enzymes at presentation. 
One patient had been referred from another tertiary care centre 
for liver transplantation after being followed for hepatopulmonary syndrome. Two patients had jaundice and elevated liver 
enzymes and one patient had pruritus at presentation. Another 
patient was referred from the Endocrinology Department when 
she was found to have elevated liver enzymes, where she was 
followed with the diagnosis of Turner syndrome. Nine patients 
had elevated ALT levels at onset. Median ALT for all patients 
was 92 IU/L (range 13-236 IU/L). Six patients had elevated AST 
levels. Median AST level for all patients was 62 IU/L (range 24-
254 IU/L). Only one patient had elevated total bilirubin level 
(2.39 mg/dL). Mean bilirubin level was 0.82 mg/dL (range 0.14-
2.39 mg/dL). Four patients had prolonged International Normalized Ratio with mean INR 1.16 (range 1-1.5). Five patients 
had thrombocytopenia (range 59,000-439,000/μL). Four of five 
patients had splenomegaly. All four patients also had low leukocyte count, which suggested hypersplenism. Mean leukocyte 
count was 7,600/μL (range 2,790-14,600/μL). Hemoglobin levels for age were low in all but 3 patients (median 11.85 g/dL, 
range 6.3-14 g/dL). One patient with significantly low albumin 
had been diagnosed with celiac disease. Three patients had low 
albumin levels (albumin < 3.5 g/dL). Mean albumin level for all 
patients was 3.75 g/dL (range 2.48-4.35 g/dL). Four patients had 
smooth muscle antibody (SMA) positivity. One of them had 
positive SMA in 1:320 titer, whereas the other was positive in 
1:20 titer. Two patients had only qualitatively positive results. 
None of these patients had hypergammaglobulinemia and/or 
findings consistent with autoimmune liver disease in their liver 
biopsy specimens. One patient had positive anti-cardiolipin 
(ACL) IgG and IgM antibodies (40 and 46 phospholipid units 
respectively; < 22.9 units is negative). One patient had incidenTable 1. Demographics of patients

tally diagnosed celiac disease, when an endoscopy was performed to check if he had varices. His anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) 
and IgA and IgG anti-tissue glutaminase (tTG) levels have been 
found positive after the endoscopic biopsy. Another patient 
had positive AGA IgA and IgG positivity without celiac disease 
findings in duodenal endoscopic biopsy. Three patients had 
esophageal varices. Two patients, who had Grade III esophageal varices, underwent several band ligation treatments during their follow-up without any spontaneous variceal bleeding. 
The last patient with gastroesophageal varices had Grade II varices. All patients with gastroesophageal varices were on propranolol treatment. None of the patients had specific tests done 
for schistosomiasis and/or HIV, as they did not have clinical 
findings for either infection. Serology for hepatitis B and C infection including hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus were 
negative in all cases. None of the patients had drug or any substance exposure in their clinical history.
DISCUSSION
HPS is a rare condition in both pediatric and adult population. 
Mostly, pediatric data is extrapolated from adult cohorts (9, 10). 
Some of these cohorts contain small numbers of pediatric patients. On the other hand, there are some isolated pediatric case 
reports as well (11). Recently, Yılmaz et al. (12) have published 
a pediatric case series from Turkey, documenting cholestatic 
features in 12 Turkish children.
Hepatoportal sclerosis or INCPH can have serious and life 
threatening complications. One patient in our cohort had hepatopulmonary syndrome, improved after living donor liver transplantation. Kaymakoglu et al. (13) have reported hepatopulmonary syndrome in 2 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension. In their cohort there were 19 patients diagnosed with idiopathic portal hypertension and the prevalence was found 10.5%, 
which is similar to our results. However it is not mentioned in 
the article, whether these two patients have been transplanted 
or not. Isabel Fiel et al. (14) have reported a case series, consisting of 8 adult patients with HPS requiring liver transplantation. 
None of them was cirrhotic and 2 of them had portal vein thrombosis. Seven patients in this cohort had variceal bleeding as 
presenting symptom. When compared with our data, we had 3 
patients with esophageal varices and none had variceal bleeding. Two patients in our cohort were treated with consecutive 
endoscopic variceal band ligation treatment without complications. All 3 patients with varices were on propranolol treatment. 
Krasinkas et al. (15) have reported 16 cases with noncirrhotic 
portal hypertension who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. All were adult patients and none had hepatopulmonary 
syndrome. However, in this case series, 13 patients had clinical 
cirrhosis. Eleven of 13 patients had radiological evidence of cirrhosis and 4 had biopsy proven cirrhosis. Additional 3 cases who 
underwent liver transplantation have been reported by Geramizadeh et al. (16) in 2008.
Besides serious liver disease and associated complications, 
HPS has been reported in association with other diseases. Girard et al. (17) reported a child with Adams-Oliver syndrome 
and HPS. They have hypothesized that a vascular anomaly and 
thrombosis may be the etiology for this condition based on the 
fact that the patient had portal vein thrombosis and Factor V 
Leiden mutation. One year later, Pouessel et al. (18) have reported an additional child with Adams–Oliver syndrome. In 
our case series, none of the patients had Adams–Oliver syndrome, but we report an 11 yr old girl with Turner syndrome 
(TS). This patient had been referred by the Endocrinology Department in our institution, where she was found to have elevated liver enzymes incidentally, during a routine blood work. 
On physical examination, she did not have hepatosplenomegaly, or clinical findings consistent with portal hypertension, and 
remaining laboratory findings were normal. In the literature, 
liver disease in TS patients is reported to be common. Roulot et 
al. (19) have reported on vascular involvement of the liver in TS. 
They have included 27 TS patients with liver disease from 6 centers. They reported 10 patients with architectural changes in liver biopsy. Six patients had nodular regenerative hyperplasia 
(NRH), 2 had multiple focal nodular hyperplasia and 2 had cirrhosis. Among the patients with architectural changes, 4 had 
portal hypertension. Vascular lesions were shown in 2 patients 
with NRH, which was obliterative portal venopathy. Interestingly, they reported two patients with positive SMA, without 
hypergamaglobulinemia and autoimmune liver disease. In our 
cohort we had 4 patients with positive SMA. One of the problems with SMA autoantibody positivity in our cohort was that, 2 
patients had only qualitative analysis and another had low titer 
positive results. None of the patients had hypergammaglobulinemia and/or autoimmune liver disease positivity in liver biopsy. However, in a study group of 12 children, positive SMA in 
4 patients is probably not coincidental (33%). In a recent study 
from Brazil, seven hundred twenty-five healthy subjects were 
investigated for non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Approximately 10% of their cohort had positive SMA in 1:40 titer (20). 
In another study from Malaysia, 101 serum samples of 69 Malay, 18 Indian and 14 Chinese adults were studied for different 
autoantibodies including anti-nuclear, anti-mitochondrial, anti-smooth muscle and anti-parietal cell antibodies and none of 
101 subjects had positive SMA (21). It is possible, different populations with different ethnic backgrounds have different autoantibody prevalence profiles in healthy populations. Unfortunately there is no published data available regarding the prevalence of SMA positivity in healthy Turkish population, which 
would help us making a comparison with our specific cohort. 
Although, it is not possible to make a conclusion with such small

numbers in our study, there might be an autoimmune process 
in etiology, affecting portal areas, causing ultimately sclerosis. 
In the presence of well described association of CD with HPS, 
the hypothesis of autoimmunity in the etiology of HPS becomes 
stronger, as CD is a known autoimmune condition.
Celiac disease (CD) and hepatoportal sclerosis has been reported previously in 2 adult cases. M’saddek (22) reported a 31 
yr old patient with CD and splenomegaly. This patient did not 
have any abnormal liver function tests. Zamani et al. (23) have 
reported a 54-yr-old man with portal hypertension and CD, where 
his symptoms improved on a gluten-free diet. In pediatric age 
group, there are no published articles mentioning this association to the best of our knowledge. In our case series, one patient 
had been diagnosed incidentally with CD, where we were performing an upper GI endoscopy to check varices. His anti-gliadin antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies found 
dramatically high afterwards. Another patient had positive antigliadin antibodies positive, without any CD findings in small 
bowel mucosa. These two children in our study group may be 
the first reported HPS patients; one with manifest CD, and the 
other with only positive serology, but the disease.
HPS has been described in some patients with HIV infection. 
Schiano et al. (24) have reported HPS in 2007 in 4 HIV (+) adults. 
They postulated that HPS might be due to intrahepatic microthrombosis or an altered hepatic fibrogenesis related to highly 
active antiretroviral therapy or due to HIV itself. Vispo et al. (25) 
have reported 12 HIV infected adult patients with HPS. All patients had been treated with a purine analogue, didanosine, for 
long time. Liver biopsies were available in 11 patients. None of 
the biopsies showed cirrhosis. Pathological diagnosis was HPS 
in 8 patients. They have postulated that, didanosine may have 
contributed to portal vein or its branches obliteration. In our 
cohort, none of the patients was tested for HIV infection. This 
was due to lack of risk factors, clinical and laboratory findings, 
which would raise the suspicion of HIV infection. 
There are a lot of synonyms used for hepatoportal sclerosis. 
Schouten et al. (8) have used the term INCPH in their review in 
2011. We have preferred to use hepatoportal sclerosis and not 
INCPH just because our patients did not fulfill all the criteria 
required to make the diagnosis of INCPH (Table 3). There were 
children in our study group with hepatoportal sclerosis, who 
did not show symptoms of portal hypertension, but had associations described with INCPH and/or hepatoportal sclerosis. It 
was possible that, children did not develop portal hypertension 
findings at early stages and we have diagnosed these patients 
before portal hypertension findings have developed. We can 
speculate that children without portal hypertension might develop portal hypertension at some stage during their follow-up. 
Regarding the diagnostic criteria, some exceptions or modifications may be required for the diagnosis of INCPH especially in 
pediatric age group.
In summary, we wanted to investigate retrospectively, whether pediatric patients, underwent liver biopsy and been diagnosed with hepatoportal sclerosis, had a uniform presentation, including portal hypertension findings. We found out that, there 
was no uniformity among these patients. Patients in our cohort 
did not necessarily have findings of portal hypertension. 
There are some weaknesses in this article. First of all, data had 
been collected retrospectively. There were some patients, where 
we could not collect all the data we aimed. Another weakness 
is, there might be some patients with HPS we are missing. Although they have HPS, these patients may not have been registered in the pathology database under the diagnosis of HPS, 
which may cause eventually issues with the power of the study. 
However, power is a chronic problem of pediatric cohorts in 
rare conditions, where it is extremely difficult to collect enough 
numbers of patients, unless multicentre studies or registries are 
planned ahead. 
In conclusion, for pediatric age group with hepatoportal 
sclerosis findings in liver biopsy, who have not fulfilled the criteria for INCPH yet, it may be necessary to consider HPS as the 
initial diagnosis and once portal hypertension develops, INCPH diagnosis can be made. We need multi-center studies and 
registries to understand the characteristics of HPS in children 
in detail.
