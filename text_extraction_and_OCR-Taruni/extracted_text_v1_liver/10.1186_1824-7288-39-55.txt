Abstract
Background: Achieving a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is currently one of the main aims in long term
survival of liver transplanted children (PLT). Purpose of our study is to compare HRQoL of PLT patients (N = 33,
mean age 12.8 y) vs. sex and age matched patients with compensated and clinically stable chronic liver disease
(CLD) (N = 25, mean age 11.9 y).
Methods: HRQoL was measured from both patient and parental perspectives using the CHQ-CF87 and CHQ-PF50
questionnaires, respectively.
Results: General Health Perception scores of PLT subjects resulted significantly lower than those of CLD both at
self- and parental report (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). No other significant differences in other HRQoL
domains were found between groups.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the two populations are quite similar regarding HRQoL, but both parents and
children of PLT group perceive a worse general health. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.
Keywords: Paediatric liver transplantation, Quality of life, Chronic disease
Background
Liver transplantation (LT) has become the treatment of
choice for several pediatric liver diseases that progress
to end-stage liver failure. Currently patients long-term
survival rates are reported to be between 85% and 90%
[1]. The possibility of prolonging recipient life expectancy has triggered several studies focusing not only on
physical problems but also on psychological and psychosocial outcomes. At the moment, the evaluation of
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) after pediatric
liver transplantation (PLT) is one of the main focuses of
several researches. It is to note that patients who receive
transplantation face a set of combined conditions: a
threatening liver disease, the transplant surgery, and the
post-transplant assistance. As a consequence, children
and families are exposed to a long-standing stressful
process that may influence their Quality of Life (QoL).
As known, HRQoL is a multidimensional construct
comprising several domains. Appropriate assessment of
HRQoL includes both patient and parents perspectives in
five domains: physical health, mental health, social functioning, role functioning and general health perception.
Studies on HRQoL after PLT are essential and have a
large impact on assistance, since they can provide information also about outcomes and factors related to nonadherence [2].
Several studies on HRQoL after PLT have been published. Most of them compared samples of PLT to healthy
children rather than to chronically ill matched controls. It
has been suggested that PLT recipients report a poorer
HRQoL in comparison with healthy population [3-8]. In
particular, physical and psychosocial domains and school
functioning are worse than those of the normative samples.
These results are not surprising because children who received liver transplantation and their families experienced
much more stressful events than healthy peers. Taylor
reviewed literature on HRQoL of children and adolescents
after liver transplantation and reported five studies that included a comparison group of chronically ill population. * Correspondence: antonella.gritti@unisob.na.it 1

On the basis of these studies, authors concluded that:
“HRQL after liver transplantation tended to be equal to or
better than in children and adolescents with other chronic
illness” [5]. However, other studies have explored this issue
[2,7,9-11] with at odd conclusions. For example, Fredericks
[2], by comparing PLT children with a control group of
children affected by cancer or diabetes, demonstrated that
PLT group achieved lower school functioning, total physical and psychosocial scores than chronic group. Limbers
[11] conducted a study on a large cohort of 873 PLT
subjects and compared the sample with a control group
including several chronic diseases (Juvenile Rheumatoid
Arthritis, Diabetes, Cancer, Cardiac disease and Renal
transplant). Final data showed that PLT patients had an
impaired HRQoL similar to chronic diseases ones with
even lower school functioning. Moreover, post-transplant
HRQOL evaluated vs. pre-transplant group of patients in a
waiting list improved dramatically after LT [12].
Finally, Duffy [10] studying HRQoL of young adults
20 years after transplantation showed that their HRQoL
was significantly better than in patients with chronic
liver disease (CLD). To our knowledge, this study is the
only one of those mentioned above, which includes a
comparison group affected by a CLD. In a previous investigation [13], our group explored psychological and
psychopathological consequences of PLT pediatric patients compared with CLD controls. By using CBCL-PRF
(Children Behaviour Check List-Parent Form) we demonstrated an higher risk for psychological problems
reported by parents of PLT group.
On this basis, here we hypothesize that PLT children
could have poorer HRQoL than CLD patients. We assume that comparison between PLT patients and CLD
samples may be useful to understand effects of transplant process on HRQoL.
According with above hypothesis, the aim of the
present research was to assess HRQoL in a sample of
PLT patients compared with a CLD group.
Methods
Candidates to enrollment were patients, aged 5–18 years,
who had undergone liver transplantation for end-stage
liver failure and regularly followed up at the Department
of Pediatrics of the University of Naples ‘Federico II’ a
.
Exclusion criteria were: acute disease needing intensive
care, intellectual disability (IQ score below 70, assessed
by a trained clinical psychologist through Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC, or Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale, WAIS, according to age).
Participants were recruited among PLT patients
followed-up by pediatricians during the period of October
2007 – January 2009.
36 subjects were eligible for the study. 2 of them (with
perinatal asphyxia) were excluded because they did not
meet inclusion criteria (IQ below 70). In one case family
refused to participate. Globally, 91% of total candidates
were included in the study.
As shown in Table 1, the final sample was composed
of 33 PLT subjects (F:14, M:19), aged between 6.2-18 years,
(mean age 12.82 yrs, SD 3.68). Mean age at PLT was
3.5 yrs SD 3.7. According to manual, 3 of 33 subjects
younger than 10 could not answer the questionnaire. PLT
group finally comprised 30 children, while parents group
was composed by 33 subjects.
CLD group was selected among chronic hepatopatic
patients followed up at the same Department on the
basis of age and gender matching with PLT group, and
at least 1 year long clinically stable chronic liver disease
(as supported by medical history, physical examination,
and laboratory tests). It comprised 25 subjects (F:12, M:
13) aged between 6.6-18.0 years (mean age 11.9 years,
SD 3.0) (Table 1). At the time of the study all were in
good clinical compensation, without signs of portal
hypertension. None of them was in LT waiting list. No
patient with viral hepatitis was on drug therapy, whereas
patients with Wilson disease and Autoimmune hepatitis
where taking penicillamine or steroids, respectively.
According to manual, 2 of 25 subjects younger than
10 could not answer the questionnaire. Therefore, CLD
group finally comprised 23 children, while parents group
was composed by 25 subjects.
Procedures
Parents were informed by the pediatric hepatologists
about the aims and methods of the research and were
asked if they would be willing to participate. After
obtaining informed consent, children and parents were
assessed separately by a child psychiatrist in a separate
setting from the pediatric hepatology section. Parents
and subjects of both groups involved in the study - PLT
and CLD - were invited to answer their respective questionnaires. Preferably parents were asked to give agreed
answers on the same questionnaire sheets; in case of
high disagreement, the caregiver spending more time
with the child was preferred. Procedures are in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.
Measures
Subjective Quality of Life was assessed through the Child
Health Questionnaire (CHQ) [14], an internationally accepted general Quality of Life survey. Rigorously developed and validated with numerous publications,
psychometric proprieties of the Italian CHQ version have
been demonstrated, as well [15]. Both a child (CHQ-CF
87) and caregiver version (CHQ-PF 50) are available. The
CHQ-PF 50 are designed for self-completion by parent/
guardian of the child. They have been validated for use
with children at least five years of age or older. The CHQGritti et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics 2013, 39:55 Page 2 of 6
http://www.ijponline.net/content/39/1/55

CF 87 is designed for self-completion by children at least
ten years of age. Both have been tested in normative populations as well as in children with a wide variety of chronic
diseases. Both versions have demonstrated strong internal
consistency and validity across diverse clinical groups.
Areas measured include: General Health Perception (perception of overall health), Physical Functioning (physical
limitations attributable to health-related problems), Rolephysical (limitations in school-work and activities with
friends), Behavior (aggression, delinquency, hyperactivity/
impulsivity, and social withdrawal), Mental Health (anxiety, depression, and positive affect) Role-emotional (limitations in activities with friends and at school caused by
emotional or behavioral problems), Parent Impact Emotional (distress experienced because of child’s condition),
Parent Impact Time (limitations in parent’s personal time
because of child’s status), Family Cohesion (how well family members get along with one another), Bodily Pain (intensity and frequency of general pain and discomfort),
Self-Esteem (satisfaction with school and athletic ability,
looks or appearance, ability to get along, and feelings
about life overall); Family activities (frequency of disruption of usual family activities). Further measures are the
two summary scales Physical Score (PhS) and Psychosocial Scores (PsS). Scores are standardized to 0–100, with
higher scores indicating better well-being.
According to User’s Manual, CHQ response options
vary. For example most scales ask about the past 4 weeks
whereas for the “Global Health” and “Family Cohesion“
items asking about health and family relationship “in
general” no recall period is used.
Statistical analysis
CHQ scoring was performed according to the manual of
CHQ-CF87 and CHQ-PF50.
Fisher’s exact test and two paired t-test were used for
demographic characteristics between groups, respectively for categorical and continuous variables.
Data of PLT sample were compared with those obtained
from gender and age matched children affected by CLD.
As we do not assume a priori that scores of both groups
were normally distributed, a non-parametric analysis
(Mann–Whitney test) was used for the comparison. P
value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Effect sizes for differences in means are designated as
small (0.20), medium (0.50), and large (0.80) in magnitude.
Study of correlation between results at CHQ-CF87 and
age, age at transplant, time elapsed from transplant was
conducted with the Spearman’s rank correlation test.
Results
Refusal or ineligibility rate was negligibly low (3 PLT
patients).
Results of CHQ-CF87 are summarized in Table 2.
Scoring CHQ-CF87 the following results were obtained:
PLT subjects reported significantly lower scores than
CLD in General Health Perception subscale (p < 0,05).
Results in other subscales didn’t reach statistically significant differences.
Similarly, CHQ-PF50 filled by PLT parents (Table 3)
scored significantly lower than those of CLD parents in
General Health Perception (p < 0,01) subscale. Results in
other subscales didn’t reach levels of significance.
Correlations between results on CHQ-CH87 and some
demographic variables (Table 4) showed positive mild or
moderate correlations between age of subjects and Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain and Physical
subscales. Positive mild or moderate correlations were
observed between time elapsed from PLT and Physical
function, Role Emotional, Role Behavioral, Role Physical,

Esteem. Negative mild correlations were observed between age at PLT and Role Emotional and Psychosocial
subscales. Negative mild correlations were observed between time elapsed from PLT and Self Esteem and General Health Perception subscales.
Discussion
Overall results indicated that PLT children had a worse
General Health Perception (GHP) than CLD, with comparable HRQoL in other areas. GHP effect size (Cohen’s d)
resulted between moderate and high values (−0,68; -0,71).
At any rate, results are strengthened by accordance between children and parents reports.
General Health perception is a subjective assessment
of overall health and illness. Parents are asked to best
describe their child’s past, future and current health and
resistance/susceptibility to sickness.
These results are consistent with previous reported ones,
summarized by Taylor [5] and highlighted by Sundaram
[9]. However, Duffy et al. [10] found a better HRQoL when
compared LT and CLD patients, but data came from an
adult population transplanted two decades earlier. Our is
the first study aimed to compare PLT and CLD from both
children and parents perspective.

Data that could, at least partially, explain our findings
are those regarding hospitalization rate per year. PLT patients and their families in fact tend to experience much
more hospitalization time per year, possibly negatively
influencing their own general health perception in respect of CLD patients. Their hospitalizations included a
first year strict program of liver function monitoring
with frequent need for corrections of medical and surgical complications; thereafter repeated admissions for
Day Hospital and/or outpatient visits were scheduled
with variable timing tailored on individual necessity.
Correlations analysis overall indicate that - differently
from self-esteem- quality of life in physical, familiar and
behavioral areas are positively associated with age and
time elapsed from transplantation. Data regarding selfesteem in PLT however should be evaluated cautiously because this subscale did not show statistically significant
differences with general population (data gathered from
User Manual) and because self esteem needs to be
assessed with more specific instruments. Undoubtedly,
these data have to be considered still exploratory because
of the relatively small sample size and the cross sectional
nature of the study. All these issues should be further
explored, eventually also with perspective studies. By the
developmental viewpoint, we suggest that very young patients may lack the cognitive and emotional competences
to promote adjustment to transplantation. On the contrary, subjects who received PLT later in the life could better cope the transplantation process.
Taking together findings from current and our group's
previous study [13], we suggest that PLT patients should
be considered at high risk for psychological problems, and
reduced quality of life as well. As already proposed [13], a
psychological support and monitoring soon after transplantation should be part of standard clinical management
of PLT patients and should be addressed to prevent psychopathological risk and to support quality of life.
This study has several limitations. In addition to the
small size of the sample and the single centre recruitment, the lack of healthy control group could limit our
findings. However, we remind that our aim was not to
compare PLT HRQoL with healthy population (whose
data are provided by already existing literature), but with
a chronic hepatic condition.
Conclusion
Knowledge on psychological and psychopathological effects of PLT has much improved overtime [16,17]. More
recently QoL is acquiring more and more a pivotal role
to optimize patient monitoring, to the point that its assessment should be complementary to clinical and laboratory data. We believe that our study’s specific finding of a
poorer HRQoL General Health Perception subscale in
PLT patients respect to CLD ones could be highly relevant
in order to provide them adequate psychological support,
and should be taken into account during transplantation
decision-making procedures [18]. In this regard a multidimensional program is recommended. Three main areas
should be included: physical health (e.g. drug side effects,
early detection of medical complications), mental health
(e.g. self-esteem, body image, depression, anxiety), social
(e.g. relationships, school).
Endnote a
This study is part of a wider program on liver
transplanted children, lasting since several years, based
on the strict cooperation between the Department of
Pediatrics of the University of Naples ‘Federico II’ and
the Chair of Child Neuropsychiatry of the Second
University of Naples (SUN) and also Suor Orsola
Benincasa University and Chair of Pediatrics University
of Salerno. The Department of Pediatrics of the University of Naples “Federico II” represents the only medical
center of Campania Region involved in the diagnosis
and treatment of severe liver diseases in the pediatric
age, including the follow-up of children who have undergone PLT. More than 100 patients (children, adolescents
and young adults) who have been transplanted in childhood as a result of a wide variety of liver diseases (cholestatic, metabolic, auto-immune, infectious) are or have
been followed at these Departments. Therefore, our
group is interested to identify and to prevent the multiorgan complications and, as mentioned, emotional and
psychological disorders in this context.
