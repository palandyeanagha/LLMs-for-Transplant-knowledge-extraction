Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare inherited disorder that presents as abnormally elevated 
levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and premature heart disease, requiring frequent intervention through 
lipid apheresis for management. The risk of perioperative cardiac events is higher in patients with HoFH because 
of its pathophysiological manifestations in the vascular system. Careful cardiac precautions and anesthetic 
assessments are necessary to ensure patient safety. In the following case report, we discuss the clinical course 
and anesthetic considerations for a 14-year-old girl with HoFH undergoing sedation for dental extractions and 
mandibular molar uprighting in an outpatient oral surgery clinic. Considerations included the use of heparin 
in the patient’s weekly plasma lipid apheresis treatment. In order to reduce the risks of peri- and postoperative 
bleeding and perioperative cardiac events, the operation was scheduled for 4 days after apheresis. This allowed 
for adequate heparin clearance, while also reducing the likelihood of possible cardiac events. A literature review 
revealed no results for the outpatient management of patients with HoFH undergoing sedation for noncardiac 
procedures. Our reported case serves as a clinical example for physicians to be utilized in the future.

INTRODUCTION
 Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is 
an inherited metabolic disorder that clinically manifests 
as markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) levels [1]. Patients with HoFH are at a high 
risk of premature atherosclerotic plaques and cardiovascular disease even in the second or third decade of 
life [2,3]. While heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is common, with an approximate prevalence of 1 
in 500 people, HoFH is rare, with an estimated prevalence 
of 1 in 1,000,000 people [1,4,5]. The affected populations 
are non-specific partly because of the lack of specific 
clinical data estimating demographic distributions of the 
prevalence [1]. 
 Compared to the heterozygous variant, the observed 
phenotype in HoFH is more severe, with significantly 
higher serum LDL-C levels [1,6]. Mutations in the gene 
coding for the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway lead to 
the observed phenotype; however, different portions of 
the LDLR pathway may be affected [6,7]. Other genes 
associated with the elevated LDL-C phenotype include 
the apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB), LDL receptor adaptor

 HoFH is diagnosed based on the results of family 
history, genetic testing, screening for elevated serum free 
LDL-C levels, and collections of cholesterol deposits, 
known as tendon xanthomas [1,3,7]. Patients present 
during childhood for examination of interdigital 
xanthomas, which are specifically characteristic of HoFH 
[7]. Laboratory findings include fasting serum LDL-C 
levels ≥ 500 mg/dl in untreated patients and ≥ 300 mg/dl 
in treated patients [1,7]. Examinations should be repeated 
to confirm the diagnosis and rule out secondary 
pathologies that present with elevated serum cholesterol 
[1]. Genetic testing helps determine defects in the 
implicated gene(s), thus confirming HoFH; however, it 
is not always necessary [7,8]. 
 Anesthesiologists face many challenges in safely 
providing anesthetic care to patients with HoFH. The risk 
of perioperative cardiovascular events is markedly greater 
in patients with HoFH because of the underlying disease 
pathophysiology. Minimizing such risk is essential for the 
safety of patients with HoFH undergoing surgical 
procedures under intravenous sedation. Here, we report 
a case of HoFH in a teenager undergoing oral and 
maxillofacial surgery and describe the anesthetic and 
surgical management. 
CASE REPORT
 A 14-year-old girl was scheduled for extractions of all 
third molars and remaining mandibular primary teeth #K, 
#S, and #T and surgical uprighting of the mandibular 
second molars (Fig. 1). Her medical history was significant for HoFH, anxiety, depression, and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease. She was diagnosed with HoFH at age 13 
following an exploratory cardiac catheterization. Before 
the diagnosis, she had never experienced a cardiac event 
as is common with incidental diagnoses of HoFH. Her 
cardiovascular family history was unknown because of 
adoption at 33 weeks. Following the diagnosis of HoFH, 
an arteriovenous fistula was placed in her right forearm 
to allow for vascular access during lipid apheresis, which 
she underwent weekly.
 Extra- and intraoral findings were normal, with no 
temporomandibular joint clicking, popping, or pain, 
lymphadenopathy, facial asymmetry, or xanthomas. Risks, 
benefits, complications, and alternative treatments were 
discussed. All surgical and anesthetic options were 
reviewed, and the patient elected to undergo total 
intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) because of her anxiety and 
phobia of dental procedures. 
 Anesthetic assessment to determine the patient’s 
candidacy for TIVA was performed because of HoFH. 
Preoperative medical clearance from the patient’s 
cardiologist was obtained with no perioperative cardiac

recommendations. Per the patient’s cardiologist, she 
never exhibited any positive cardiac risk factors or 
symptoms that would warrant cardiac monitoring before 
anesthesia. The appropriate time to perform the procedure 
was determined such that it was in succession to her 
therapeutic lipid apheresis and accounted for heparin 
drips in concert.
 The physician overseeing the patient’s apheresis 
recommended that the procedure be scheduled approximately for 4 days following apheresis treatment. Finally, 
the plan was formulated as follows: 1) The patient would 
receive her regular lipid apheresis treatment; 2) After 4 
days, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test 
would be performed to evaluate her clotting ability; 3) 
If the aPTT was within standard limits, the procedure 
would be scheduled for day 4 after her next lipid 
apheresis treatment (Fig. 2). 
 Four days after apheresis, the patient’s reported aPTT 
value was 39.0 s, which was within a standard range of 
25.9 to 39.5 s. The patient presented for surgery with 
a weight of 40 kg, height of 1.45 m, NPO ≥ 8 h, 
American Society of Anesthesiologists score III, 
Mallampati score III, and body mass index of 17.8 kg/m2
. 
Monitors were placed on the patient, and intravenous 
access was established on the dorsum of the left hand 
to avoid complications associated with functioning of her 
arteriovenous fistula. The patient exhibited vasovagal 
syncope following intravenous access and was placed in 
the Trendelenburg position. Oxygen was delivered at 4 
L/min via a nasal cannula, and a cold compress was 
placed on her forehead. 
 Baseline vitals before syncope were: blood pressure, 
115/66 mmHg; heart rate, 83 beats/min; and oxygen 
saturation, 100%. After syncope, once vital signs returned

to normal, intravenous doses of 1 mg midazolam, 50 µg 
fentanyl, 4 mg ondansetron, 4 mg dexamethasone, and 
1 mg cefazolin were administered. Anesthesia was 
induced with an initial bolus of 40 mg of propofol, while 
sedation was maintained with an additional 220 mg of 
propofol hand-bolused in increments of 10 to 20 mg every 
1 to 2 min and titrated to be effective throughout the 
procedure.
 Local anesthesia was induced by infiltrating surgical 
sites with 8.5 ml of 2% lidocaine with 1 : 100,000 
epinephrine. A bite block and throat pack were placed. 
Extractions of primary teeth and third molars were 
achieved with a #15 blade, followed by periosteal and 
straight elevators. Surgical dressings were placed at all 
surgical sites for hemostasis, and surgical sites were 
closed with a 3-0 gut suture to achieve primary closure. 
Surgical uprighting of both mandibular molars was 
achieved by introducing a small straight elevator to the 
mesial aspect of both teeth, without damaging the 
adjacent teeth or fully luxating the mandibular second 
molars. 
 The total procedure time was 22 min, and sedation 
lasted for 40 min. Vital signs were stable throughout the 
perioperative period (Table 2). Blood loss was minimal, 
and she was closely monitored postoperatively for 
excessive bleeding. The patient was arousable, and vital 
signs stabilized within 20% range of her initial baseline. 
She was awake, alert, and oriented to her surroundings, 
and was able to walk with minimal assistance. The patient 
returned to the clinic 1 week after the procedure and 
reported good wound healing at operative sites with 
minimal pain and swelling. 
DISCUSSION
 Reduction in serum LDL-C in patients with HoFH 
necessitates more aggressive treatment modalities than 
traditional statin therapies and lifestyle changes [2–4]. 
Lipid apheresis is effective; however, it must be 
performed weekly or biweekly to maintain normal serum 
LDL-C levels, or serum values return to pretreatment 
levels between 2–4 weeks following apheresis [3,4]. 
 Different techniques are used in removal of lipoproteins: immunoadsorption, dextran sulphate-cellulose 
adsorption, heparin extracorporeal LDL precipitation

systems, and direct adsorption of lipoprotein using 
hemoperfusion [9]. Our patient utilized the heparin 
extracorporeal LDL precipitation system technique, 
which was important consider when selecting the date of 
procedure given the bleeding risks associated with 
heparin usage.
 Date selection for our patient was important for two 
primary reasons. First, we wanted to minimize the 
patient’s risk for a cardiovascular event by choosing a 
date that immediately followed apheresis treatment to 
ensure optimal cardiovascular function. Second, although 
the ideal date of surgery would have been the day 
following apheresis, she received heparin infusions at 
each weekly treatment, inducing risk for excessive 
bleeding during the peri- and postoperative periods. This 
could hinder the procedure and subsequent healing at the 
incision sites. The physician supervising our patient’s 
apheresis treatment recommended a waiting period of 4 
days in addition to evaluating aPTT in order to confirm 
she has acceptable clotting ability. 
 Cardiac evaluation is necessary before surgery to 
thoroughly assess risk in patients with HoFH. Measures 
include evaluating the cardiac functional status through 
questionnaires, stress testing, performing resting echocardiography, assessing troponin and brain natriuretic 
peptide values, and even performing cardiac catheterization [10]. The type of noncardiac surgery and degree 
of invasiveness also determine how the patient should be 
evaluated from a cardiovascular standpoint before 
procedure [10].
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report 
describing the management of a patient with HoFH 
undergoing an elective, noncardiac surgery under 
intravenous sedation. Rarity of the diseases is as a 
potential roadblock in the anesthetic management of 
patients with HoFH; however, in our report, we have 
provided a framework that clinicians may utilize for 
patients with HoFH requiring treatment in the oral surgery 
practice.
