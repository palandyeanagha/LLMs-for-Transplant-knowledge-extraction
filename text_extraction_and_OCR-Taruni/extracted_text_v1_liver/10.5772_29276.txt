1. Introduction 
The survival of patients who undergo liver transplantation has improved over recent years, 
due to the perfectioning of the surgical technique, the optimization of immunosuppressive 
therapy and the prevention of infection, and is estimated to be 90% at one year and 70% at 
five years (Pagadala et al., 2009). However, at the same time the incidence of metabolic 
complications has increased, and they now constitute one of the main causes of mortality 
unrelated to the graft (Muñoz & ElGenaidi, 2005; Watt et al., 2010). The metabolic syndrome 
(MS), which associates overweight, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension, has a 
greater prevalence in patients who have a liver transplant as compared with the general 
population (Francioso et al., 2008; Sorice et al., 2011). Though the impact of the MS on posttransplant mortality is controversial, its diagnosis or the presence of certain of its 
components increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, renal failure or fatty liver 
disease in the graft, and it has also been related with a greater risk for infections and 
rejection. The MS has special relevance in patients with hepatitis C, as the development of 
the MS in general, and diabetes in particular, can affect the natural history of the hepatitis C 
in the graft (Vedt et al., 2009). The identification of modifiable predisposing factors and early 
treatment of hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, together with the prevention 
of overweight during the peri-transplant period, can all help to reduce the morbidity and 
mortality in this population. 
2. Diagnosis and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in liver transplant 
patients 
Many definitions for the MS can be found in the literature. The criteria defined by the 
National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATPIII) 
adapted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/American Heart Association 
(NHLBI/AHA) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) are detailed in Table 1(Grundy 
et al., 2004; Alberti et al., 2006). 
These criteria all have in common insulin resistance (IR) as the physiological basis of the MS. 
IR is defined as the reduction of sensitivity of tissues to the action of insulin, which implies a 
compensating hyperinsulinaemia that in the end exhausts the capacity of the pancreatic beta 
cells to produce insulin. Secondary to this is produced hyperglycaemia and diabetes. IR is

measured using the HOMA (Homeostatic Model Assessment) index, though its 
measurement is not necessary for the diagnosis of the MS (Matthews et al., 1985).

mg/dl for men 
• Triglycerides >150 mg/dl 
Table 1. Definition of the metabolic syndrome by NHLBI/AHA and IDF 2005 
The prevalence of the MS in the general population is approximately 30% (Ford et al., 2004). 
However, in liver transplant patients it is considerably higher, approximately 40-50% 
(Laryea et al., 2007; Bianchi et al, 2008), though these percentages can vary according to 
geographical area, and are slightly lower, for example, in the Spanish population, both 
transplanted and non-transplanted (Ruiz-Rebollo et al., 2010). 
Independent analysis of each of the components of the MS also shows a greater incidence in 
the transplanted population; 40-85% develop hypertension, 13-61% diabetes, 40-66% 
dyslipidaemia, mainly hypertriglyceridaemia, and up to 40% obesity, which can reach 70% 
three years post-transplant (Laish et al., 2011). 
3. Risk factors for post-transplant metabolic syndrome 
Different studies have evaluated possible risk factors for the development of post-transplant 
metabolic syndrome (PTMS) in an attempt to identify them early and treat them as far as 
possible. 
In general, considering that IR triggers the MS, the situations that predispose to this 
condition are applicable, in addition to the underlying aetiology of the liver disease and the 
use of immunosuppressive drugs. 
Of the causes leading to the liver transplant, HCV infection (Bigam et al., 2000) and 
cryptogenic cirrhosis are significantly associated with PTMS (Ong et al., 2001), versus other

factors such as autoimmune disorders or hepatitis B. Biliary diseases are not related with 
PTMS, perhaps because of the later hepatocyte involvement, which is, after all, responsible 
for glucose metabolism (Laryea et al., 2007). Review of all the publications available 
confirms the two-way relation of the hepatitis C virus, insulin-resistance and the 
development of diabetes (Hanouneh et al., 2008). 
Immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, are associated 
with the appearance of cardiovascular risk factors, though tacrolimus is more diabetogenic 
and cyclosporine predisposes more to hypertension and dyslipidaemia (Marchetti & 
Navalesi, 2000). In fact, most of the metabolic complications appear during the first months 
after the transplant, when the immunosuppressive treatment is greater. Nevertheless, no 
clear relation exists between the MS and a particular immunosuppressive regimen, probably 
because of its multifactorial origin (Bianchi et al., 2008). 
The characteristics of the donor and the recipient also influence the development of PTMS; 
mainly the age of both, the presence of any of the components of the MS prior to the 
transplant, and the existence and degree of graft steatosis are considered risk factors. 
4. Components of PTMS 
4.1 Obesity 
Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25-30 and obesity as a BMI >30, with 
the latter being classified into class I (BMI of 30-35), class II (BMI of 35-40) and class III 
(BMI>40). Obesity can also be differentiated between peripheral or central obesity, with the 
latter having more implication in the metabolism (Watt, 2010). 
Pre-transplant obesity is associated with greater peri-operative morbidity and mortality, 
with a longer hospital stay and reduced patient and graft survival. An analysis by the 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients showed that five-year post-transplant 
mortality was greater in recipients with class II and III obesity (Nair et al., 2002), though 
no consideration was given to the influence of ascites on overweight. Studies that 
corrected obesity for ascites found no significant differences regarding morbidity or 
survival between obese and non-obese recipients, though ascites was found to be 
indicative of a worse postoperative course (Leonard et al., 2008). These studies could, 
however, be influenced by the fact that the obese patients were studied more closely from 
the cardiological aspect, with more exhaustive screening for pre-transplant cardiovascular 
risk. 
Post-transplant obesity is very usual. Patients who are overweight prior to the transplant 
usually remain so, and up to one third develop de novo obesity (WawrzynonowiczSyczewska et al., 2009). The main triggering factor is the return to dietary habits but not to 
physical activity (Painter et al., 2001), which leads to a progressive weight gain, generally 
greater during the first post-transplant months. The immunosuppressive medication has 
traditionally been considered a trigger of overweight, though the association is in fact 
controversial and it has only been shown with the long-term use of steroids (Everhart et al., 
1998). 
Whilst not associated with greater mortality, post-transplant obesity, particularly central 
obesity, causes an imbalance in the production of adipokines, favouring those that produce

peripheral insulin resistance, and thus PTMS (Fox et al., 2007). In addition, obesity is related 
with osteoarthritis, sleep apnoea syndrome, and alterations in the distribution volume of 
drugs. The toxicity of non-lipophylic drugs that are adjusted to weight may be increased, 
and the blood levels of lipophylic drugs reduced (Watt & Charlton, 2010). Obesity can also 
affect the activity of the cytochrome P450 (Kotlyar & Carson, 1999). 
The management of pre-transplant overweight is mainly based on dietary measures and 
lifestyle recommendations. Though there is currently no BMI that is an absolute 
contraindication for liver transplantation, obesity is considered a surgical and post-operative 
risk factor. The recommendations after the transplant are similar to those for the general 
population. Weight should be controlled, and the patient instructed about the prevention 
of obesity, with a suitable diet and physical exercise. Immunosuppression, especially 
corticosteroids, should be minimized as far as possible. 
Bariatric surgery has been considered as a treatment option in patients with morbid obesity 
(Takata et al., 2008). However, performing it before the transplant operation is associated 
with technical difficulties, and after transplantation it may affect the absorption of the 
immunosuppressive medication, with repercussions on graft viability, and may also make 
treatment of any biliary problems more difficult (Butte et al., 2007). 
Concerning pharmacological measures, pancreatic lipase inhibitors like tetrahydrolipstatin 
(orlistat), which can be used in the general population with morbid obesity, present 
important interactions with the immunosuppressive agents, and thus have to be limited in 
the transplant population (Desai et al., 2010). 
4.2 Diabetes 
Candidate patients for a liver transplant may have diabetes or, more likely, glucose 
intolerance due to the IR present in many patients with hepatic cirrhosis. In this context, IR 
can be related with the hyperglucagonaemia found in many cirrhotic patients, as well as 
with the lower insulin degradation by a diseased liver or by the leakage phenomena from a 
portosystemic shunt. After the transplant, the insulin levels and glucose metabolism become 
normal in up to 6% of these patients (Watt & Charlton, 2010). However, from 20% to 60% 
remain diabetic or develop post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The main risk factors 
for the development of PTDM are prior diabetes, obesity, hepatitis C and a family history of 
diabetes (Anastáscio et al., 2010). 
After the transplant, the immunosuppressive drugs are the main trigger for de novo DM. 
Steroids induce IR in a dose-dependent manner, by reducing the pancreatic production of 
insulin and increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis (Schake et al., 2002). Calcineurin inhibitors 
can also reduce insulin production via a direct toxic effect and/or reduction in the 
peripheral use of insulin. Tacrolimus seems to have a greater diabetogenic effect than 
cyclosporine (Haddad et al., 2006). The effect of mTOR inhibitors on the development of IR 
is unclear; on one hand they may favour the response to insulin and thus reduce the risk of 
diabetes, though on the other hand they can also block the proliferation of pancreatic beta 
cells, thereby predisposing to PTDM (Vodenik et al., 2009). 
PTDM is associated with cardiovascular complications, increased and accelerated 
progression of fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C, and a reduction in the response to

antiviral therapy (Veldt et al., 2009). It is also associated with a greater incidence of chronic 
rejection and late hepatic artery thrombosis. The survival of transplant patients who develop 
diabetes is lower than that for those without diabetes. In addition, these patients can present 
the same microvascular complications as in the general population, including retinopathy, 
nephropathy and infections (Desai et al., 2010). 
The aims of treatment in the transplant patient with diabetes are similar to those in the 
general population: fasting blood glucose levels of 80-130 mg/dl, post-prandial levels of 
140-180 mg/dl and glycosylated haemoglobin <6.5-7% (Bilbao et al., 2010).. 
The treatment of PTDM includes dietary measures, limiting the intake of carbohydrates, and 
physical activity. A reduction in steroids or their complete withdrawal, plus dose optimization 
of calcineurin inhibitors or their minimization, adding other immunosuppressive drugs 
(mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors) may suffice, thereby avoiding pharmacological therapy 
(Dumortier et al., 2006; Herrero el at., 2006). 
Hyperglycaemia during the early post-transplant period requires treatment with insulin, 
which can later be reduced or even stopped. The drugs of choice for maintenance therapy 
are oral antidiabetic agents (Marchetti, 2005). The choice of oral antidiabetic agent to be 
used should be based on the advantages and possible side effects of each drug group in 
general or each drug in particular. The sulphonylureas can favour overweight and 
hypoglycaemia and should be avoided in patients with advanced kidney failure; the alpha 
glucosidase inhibitors can produce adverse side effects in the digestive system; the 
thiazolidinediones, which have a greater glucose lowering action, have been shown to 
increase the cardiovascular risk in the general population and are not therefore advised 
(Watt & Charlton, 2010). Metformin may be the most suitable oral antidiabetic agent 
because it lacks hepatic metabolism and is the recommended first line drug of choice, 
though it should be remembered that it can produce lactic acidosis in patients with kidney 
failure (Sharif, 2011). 
4.3 Dyslipidaemia 
Prior to the transplant, most cirrhotic patients do not have dyslipidaemia, due to the lower 
liver production of lipids and the malnutrition experienced by most of them. An exception, 
though, is patients with cholestatic liver disease, but in these cases the pattern of 
dyslipidaemia is not associated with a greater risk of arteriosclerosis (Muñoz & ElGenaidi, 
2005). 
After the transplant, however, dyslipidaemia, both hypertriglyceridaemia and 
hypercholesterolaemia, is very frequent, occurring in up to 70% of transplant patients within 
one year (Bianchi et al., 2008). Some authors consider dyslipidaemia to be the main 
cardiovascular risk factor (Reuben, 2001). 
As with the other components of the PTMS, the aetiology of dyslipidaemia involves many 
factors, though the immunosuppressive agents are the main triggering factor. Steroids are 
associated with hyperlipidaemia as they stimulate the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
and the synthesis of fatty acids, thus raising concentrations of total cholesterol and 
triglycerides (Ballantyne et al., 1992). M-TOR inhibitors increase lipoprotein-lipase activity, 
increasing the hepatic synthesis of triglycerides (Morrisett et al., 2003). Calcineurin

354 Liver Transplantation – Technical Issues and Complications 
inhibitors reduce the excretion of cholesterol to the bile and the peripheral LDL-cholesterol 
receptors, thereby raising circulating levels of cholesterol (Chan et al., 1998). 
Treatment of the hypercholesterolaemia starts with dietary measures, including supplements 
of omega 3 fatty acid. In most cases, though, this is insufficient and it is necessary to initiate 
pharmacological treatment. The recommendations for this are the same as for the general 
population. In patients with no cardiovascular events, the LDL cholesterol should be 
maintained <130 mg/dl, though for secondary prevention this level should be <100 mg/dl. 
Statins are the drugs of choice in both the general and the transplant populations, reducing 
cardiovascular disease as well as having a certain immunosuppressive effect that has been 
related with a lower incidence of rejection (Martin et al., 2008). Most statins use the same 
metabolic pathways as calcineurin inhibitors (P450 cytochrome), which explains the 
pharmacological interactions and the greater risk for myositis and rhabdomyolysis (Desai et 
al., 2010). It is therefore recommended to start with low doses and gradually increase them 
according to needs. In particular, pravastatin is eliminated via the kidneys and fluvastatin 
uses a different cytochrome, so that these two may be the statins of choice (Watt & Charlton, 
2010). Treatment with ion exchange resins, whilst it may help normalize cholesterol levels, 
interrupts the enterohepatic circulation and may, secondarily, alter levels of calcineurin 
inhibitors, particularly cyclosporine. 
Hypertriglyceridaemia is better treated with dietary restriction, with drugs generally being 
reserved for patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, are 
indicated in these cases, but with caution if associated with statins due to the greater 
muscular toxicity. 
Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of the enterohepatic recirculation of lipids, has been show to be welltolerated and effective when used in combination with statin, but interacts with 
immunosuppressive drugs and can produce hepatotoxicity (Almutairi et al., 2009). 
In all cases the use of steroids should be kept to a minimum and calcineurin inhibitors 
optimized. 
4.4 Hypertension 
The incidence of hypertension before transplant is very low. However, after transplantation, 
the hyperdynamic circulation of the cirrhotic patient is reverted, with an increase in blood 
pressure that can reach values considered normal. Once again, the immunosuppressive 
drugs, whether or not in the presence of other risk factors, are related with the onset of 
hypertension, considered as a systolic pressure ≥140 mmHg and a diastolic pressure ≥90 
mmHg; this occurs in around 60-70% of all patients (Watt et al., 2010). The pathophysiology 
of post-transplant hypertension does not reside in alterations of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, as occurs in the non-transplanted population. The fundamental 
mechanism is related to the systemic and renal haemodynamic changes produced by the 
immunosuppressive drug. Calcineurin inhibitors, particularly cyclosporine, produce renal 
vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, with secondary renal hypoperfusion leading to 
reabsorption of sodium and water (Textor et al., 2000). Steroids potentiate this latter 
situation through their mineralocorticoid effect and mTOR inhibitors can produce 
hypertension if associated with calcineurin inhibitors.

The aims of treatment are to maintain blood pressure figures <140/90 mmHg (or lower in 
the presence of other risk factors), and the first step is restriction of dietary salt, coupled 
with control of other risk factors and the undertaking of physical activity. 
As far as drugs are concerned, calcium antagonists are considered the first choice as they 
can reverse renal vasoconstriction. Within this group of drugs, diltiazem, verapamil or 
nicardipine interfere in the hepatic metabolism of calcineurin whilst amlodipine does not, 
and this latter is thus the most used (Watt, 2010). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) produce vasodilation of the efferent 
arteriole, reducing glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration (Desai et al., 2010). They are 
the choice group for patients with proteinuria and renal failure because they slow its 
progress. 
Beta blockers are not first-line drugs, but they can be used in selected cases. Finally, 
diuretics in association with other antihypertensive drugs are beneficial in cases that 
are difficult to control, but should not be used as a single therapy and also require 
strict electrolyte control. The reduction of calcineurin inhibitors favours blood pressure 
control. 
5. Consequences of the metabolic syndrome 
5.1 Major cardiovascular complications 
Major cardiovascular complications or events mainly include ischaemic heart disease, stroke 
or peripheral ischaemia phenomena. Transplant patients who develop PTMS have an 
accumulated incidence of cardiovascular disease around twice that of transplant patients 
without PTMS (12.9% vs. 4.9%, respectively; Figure 1, Laish et al 2011). Cardiovascular 
mortality can reach 40% (Laish et al., 2011; Laryea et al., 2007; Anastáscio et al., 2010). 
5.2 Fatty liver graft disease 
Up to 60% of patients transplanted due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) relapse at 
one year and 100% at five years. In cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis, the presence of different 
degrees of steatosis in the graft is 50% at two years post-transplant. Although no exact study 
has been undertaken on the repercussion of steatosis on graft function, between 2.5% and 
15% of relapses of NASH are estimated to end in cirrhosis. The main independent risk factor 
for fatty liver graft disease is a 10% increase in body mass index (Charlton, 2009; Dureja et 
al., 2011). 
5.3 Influence of HCV recurrence 
A bidirectional relation exists between HCV and IR, with 21% of HCV-positive patients 
being diabetic, and the presence of HCV multiplies the long-term risk of developing 
diabetes by 2-3 times. A recent analysis of cardiovascular risk after liver transplantation 
according to HCV status showed higher incidence of DM among HCV-positive patients 
(Pérez et al., 2011). Inversely, IR or the presence of established diabetes is associated with 
greater viral replication, a higher degree of steatosis and fibrosis and worse response to 
antiviral therapy (Arase et al., 2009). The main reason for this association is that not only 
www.intechopen.com

356 Liver Transplantation – Technical Issues and Complications 
does HCV block the intracellular signals that trigger insulin after binding to the receptor, 
but also IR stimulates hepatic lipogenesis and stellate cells, thus increasing steatosis and 
fibrosis. IR and hyperinsulinaemia induce resistance to interferon, such that patients with a 
HOMA >2 have a lower percentage of sustained viral response (SVR). In parallel, those 
patients who achieve a SVR have a lower risk of developing diabetes because, in the absence 
of viral replication, the IR almost disappears (Romero et al., 2009) 
5.4 Renal failure 
In both the general population and in persons who have a transplant, patients with the MS 
present a greater incidence of renal failure. The reduction in glomerular filtration and the 
presence of microalbuminuria are associated with the number of components of the MS 
present. IR, and secondary hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia, cause an imbalance 
between vasodilatating and vasoconstricting substances, in favour of the latter; they favour 
oxidative stress and endothelial damage; stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis 
and release of growth factors. This all leads to structural damage in the kidney, mainly 
tubular atrophy, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, damage that eventually 
produces a reduction in glomerular filtration, proteinuria and a rise in creatinine. If added 
to this there is renal damage caused by the immunosuppressive drugs, transplant patients 
with PTMS thus have a greater incidence of chronic transplant nephropathy (Morales et al., 
2006). 
6. Prevention and treatment of PTMS 
It is necessary to identify patients with risk factors for PTMS as obesity, pretransplant diabetes, 
older age, and transplantation due to HCV infection or cryptogenic cirrhosis, which in many 
cases is in fact an unrecognized steatohepatitis. Usual check-ups should include a search for 
the early detection of components of PTMS and, if found, they should be treated as per the 
recommendations above. In all cases good dietary advice is recommended as well as the 
promotion of physical activity. Concerning immunosuppression, the use of steroids and 
calcineurin inhibitors should be reduced as much as is possible. This generally means the 
early introduction of other immunosuppressive drugs, mainly mycophenolate and mTOR 
inhibitors, which permits calcineurin inhibitors to be spared. In patients presenting with 
several cardiovascular risk factors or in those who have had a cardiovascular event, 
antiaggregation therapy should be considered. 
7. Conclusions 
The MS and each of its individual components are more prevalent in transplant patients 
than in the general population. The presence of PTMS is associated with a grater incidence 
of cardiovascular diseases and chronic transplant nephropathy. It is related with a worse 
course of HCV recurrence and favours the onset of fatty liver graft disease. 
Immunosuppressive drugs are the main factor related with PTMS. Strict vigilance should 
be exercised at the regular clinic visits for the appearance of any of the components of MS 
and treatment started accordingly. The immunosuppression should be individualised, 
recommending the early introduction of calcineurin inhibitor sparing drugs, with fewer 
metabolic and renal side effects.

This book covers a wide spectrum of topics including, but not limited to, the technical issues in living and
deceased donor liver transplant procedures, cell and experimental liver transplantation, and the complications
of liver transplantation. Some of the very important topics, such as the arterial reconstruction in living donor
liver transplantation, biliary complications, and the post-transplant-lymphoprolifrative disorders (PTLD), have
been covered in more than one chapter.
