Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide and has no effective treatment, yet the
molecular basis of hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we report findings from a whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) study of 88 matched HCC tumor/normal pairs, 81 of which are Hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive,
seeking to identify genetically altered genes and pathways implicated in HBV-associated HCC. We find beta-catenin to
be the most frequently mutated oncogene (15.9%) and TP53 the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor (35.2%).
The Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT pathways, altered in 62.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively, are likely to act as
two major oncogenic drivers in HCC. This study also identifies several prevalent and potentially actionable mutations,
including activating mutations of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), in 9.1% of patients and provides a path toward therapeutic
intervention of the disease.

Liver cancer is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the
third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide ( Jemal et al.
2011). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary
liver malignancy, is refractory to nearly all currently available anticancer therapies. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes the majority of HCC cases worldwide and is the leading etiological agent in
epidemic regions of China, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and subSaharan Africa (Parkin 2006). Genetic alterations in HBV-mediated
HCC have been identified previously, including point mutations in
TP53 and beta-catenin (CTNNB1), amplifications of MYC and
FGF19, and HBV integrations into TERTand KMT2B (also known as
MLL4) (Neuveut et al. 2010; Zender et al. 2010; Sawey et al. 2011).
Recently a number of studies that published on genome or exome
sequencing of HCC have begun to reveal the genetic landscape in
HCC (Li and Mao 2012). However, the number of HCC samples
sequenced is still limited, the list of genetic alterations is far from
complete, and the key drivers of HBV-induced tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of
a large number of matched tumor and normal samples provides
a systematic and comprehensive approach for identifying recurrent somatic genetic alterations, including single nucleotide
variations (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), DNA
copy number variations (CNVs), and structural variations (SVs)
(Bass et al. 2011; Chapman et al. 2011). We applied WGS to survey
a cohort of 88 well-annotated HCC tumors to identify somatically
mutated genes and pathways potentially driving HCC. We report
herein the commonly altered cancer pathways as well as recurrent
and potentially actionable mutations, including novel and acti13These authors contributed equally to this work. 14Corresponding authors

vating mutations in Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) that could lead to an
opportunity to evaluate existing JAK inhibitors for the treatment
of this deadly disease.
Results
Overview of genetic alterations
Eighty-eight primary HCC tumors and matched adjacent nontumor liver tissues were analyzed by whole-genome DNA sequencing to identify somatic mutations and HBV integration sites.
The vast majority (92%, n = 81) of patients in this cohort were HBV
carriers (i.e., HBsAg seropositive) suffering from chronic hepatitis B
or cirrhosis. None of the patients were hepatitis C virus (HCV)
positive (see Supplemental Table 1).
For each DNA sample except for 11 patients where either
normal or tumor DNA is limited, we built two libraries with different insert sizes (170 bp and 800 bp) for sequencing because the
larger insert library provides better physical coverage for capturing
SVs. The average depth of base pair coverage was 36.13 except for
three tumor/normal pairs sequenced at 1003 coverage. The concordance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls between
WGS and genotype data generated from Illumina 550K arrays
exceeded 98.8%.
We developed a method to detect somatic SNVs in WGS data
(see Methods) and estimated its sensitivity to be 82.2% (88/107)
when evaluated against a reference set of 107 somatic SNVs identified from whole-transcriptome sequencing and experimentally
validated using Sequenom mass spectrometric genotyping (see
Methods). To assess the false-positive rate, we randomly selected
497 somatic SNV calls, and 3.4% were invalidated by Sequenom
method in both tumor and normal DNA samples (Supplemental
Table 2). Moreover, our validation results showed that sensitivity
was not much higher in 1003 samples (87.5%, 42/48) than in 303
samples (78%, 46/59) while false-positive rates were similar in the
two groups (2.2% vs. 4.1%). Hence, we selected 303 as sequencing
coverage for the study because it is more cost-effective for surveying the landscape of somatic SNVs in a large cohort than 1003. In
total, 823,835 somatic SNV mutations were detected in 88 tumors,
of which 5015 (0.6%) are predicted to affect protein coding (4482
missense, 334 nonsense, and 199 splice site) (Supplemental Table
3). A total of 3739 genes were mutated including 809 genes with
multiple protein-altering mutations (Supplemental Table 4). The
average somatic mutation rate is 3.69 per Mb with a wide range
across samples (0.07–39). The nonsynonymous to synonymous
somatic SNV ratio of 2.99 and the mean protein-altering mutation
rate of 1.8 per Mb are midrange among different cancer types
(Greenman et al. 2007). The mutation prevalence and patterns
observed are largely consistent with reports from a recent WGS
study of a single, HCV-associated HCC genome (Supplemental Fig.
1; Totoki et al. 2011).
Using a somatic indel calling pipeline based on the SRiC
method (Zhang et al. 2011) (see Methods), we also predicted 35,168
small (#20-bp) deletions and 22,826 small insertions including
302 events affecting protein-coding (256 frame-shifted, 46 in-frame)
in 285 genes (Supplemental Table 5). Eighty-eight of the 90 randomly selected 1- to ;4-bp coding indels were validated (97.8%)
by the Sequenom method in both tumor and normal DNA samples
(Supplemental Table 6). In-frame deletions were found in oncogenes such as CTNNB1 (1.1%), MDM2 (1.1%), and IL6ST (1.1%)
(Rebouissou et al. 2009), and frame-shifting deletions were found in
tumor suppressors including ARID1A (2.3%), AXIN1 (2.3%), PTEN
(1.1%), RB1 (1.1%), and TP53 (1.1%) (Supplemental Table 5).
We also detected 399 genomic HBV integration events affecting 115 coding genes and 4314 somatic structural variation
(SV) events, including 260 gene fusions. Details of HBV integration
and SV events have been described elsewhere (Sung et al. 2012;
J Fernandez-Banet, NP Lee, KT Chan, H Gao, X Liu, WK Sung,
W Tan, RT Poon, PA Rejto, M Mao, et al., in prep.).
Significantly mutated genes
The statistical significance of the observed mutation prevalence
for each gene was assessed in the context of the background
mutation rate and gene sequence length (Youn and Simon 2011)
(see Methods and Supplemental Table 3). The most significantly
mutated genes include three genes that have been previously
established to be mutated in HCC (TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1), two
genes known to be frequently mutated in other cancer types
(JAK1, LRP1B), and six genes not previously reported to be mutated in HCC (EPS15, SLC10A1, CACNA2D4, ADCY2, FAM5C, and
COL11A1) (Table 1). TP53 has the highest prevalence of proteinaltering mutations identified in our HCC cohort (31/88 samples =
35.2%), consistent with earlier HCC studies (Neuveut et al. 2010).

We found TP53 mutated tumors harbor higher levels of chromosome instability, are more likely to be poorly differentiated,
and have poor survival (Supplemental Fig. 2). This is consistent
with the hypothesis that large-scale chromosomal alteration is
left unchecked in cells where TP53-mediated defenses against
DNA damage were deactivated by TP53 mutation (Chow and
Poon 2010). Interestingly, the R249S mutation in TP53, a hotspot
linked to aflatoxin B exposure in China (Aguilar et al. 1994), was
observed in nine cases, suggesting that aflatoxin B exposure could
be a secondary etiological agent in this cohort dominated by
HBV+ cases and the mutation could be as the result of selective
advantage during mutagenesis induced by aflatoxins and HBV
chronic infection (Gouas et al. 2009). CTNNB1 harbors proteinaltering mutations in 15.9% of the tumors. Eleven of the 14
mutations are located in exon 3 and have been previously
reported (Miyoshi et al. 1998). As exon 3 contains the phosphorylation site of GSK3B, a mediator of CTNNB1 degradation,
prevalent mutations in this region may act to preserve CTNNB1
activities. We also detected a small deletion in exon 3 of CTNNB1
that removes the GSK3B phosphorylation sites (S33 and S37). In
addition to CTNNB1, negative regulators of CTNNB1, including
AXIN1 (4.5%), AXIN2 (2.3%), and APC (2.3%), are also mutated,
implicating the canonical Wnt pathway as a major driver of
hepatocarcinogenesis. Two known cancer genes not previously
reported to be mutated in HCC are frequently mutated in our
cohort—BRCA2 (5.7%) and IGF1R (5.7%). Furthermore, there are
multiple protein-altering mutations in cancer genes such as FLT3
(3.4%), KDR (3.4%), PTEN (2.3%), MET (2.3%), ALK (2.3%), ROS1
(2.3%), NOTCH2 (2.3%), and FGFR2 (2.3%). Mutations in PIK3CA
and HRAS were observed but were infrequent (1/88). We did not
observe mutations in KRAS, which has been reported in vinyl
chloride–associated HCC (Weihrauch et al. 2001).
Several of the frequently mutated genes identified in this
study are not well-established cancer genes, but corroborating evidence from recent studies points to potential roles in cancer. The
chromatin remodeling gene ARID2 was found mutated in 14.0% of
HCV-associated HCC and 2.0% of HBV-associated HCC tumors
recently (Li et al. 2011), and in our study, it was found mutated in
three samples (3.4%) where all three mutations are nonsense. We
also observed two mutations in ARID1A, a key component of the
SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex reported to be frequently
mutated in ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers (Wiegand et al.
2010; Jones et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011). KMT2C (also known as
MLL3), a member of the MLL gene family associated with aggressive acute leukemia (ALL) and a subunit of the histone H3K4
methyltransferase complex (Lee et al. 2009), is mutated in 8.0% of
tumors. KMT2B, a paralog of KMT2C, is affected by HBV integration in 10.2% of tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest
that chromatin remodeling may play a significant role in HCC
carcinogenesis, echoing recent findings in medulloblastoma, renal
carcinoma, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer genome sequencing
efforts (Wiegand et al. 2010; Varela et al. 2011).
In addition to well-known and emerging cancer genes, our
study revealed several genes with poorly characterized functional
roles in cancer but sufficient mutational evidence to warrant experimental investigation. One of the most significantly mutated
genes is LRP1B with mutations in 10 tumors (11.4%) and LRP1B
mutations have been previously reported in 9% of lung adenocarcinomas (Ding et al. 2008). EPS15, a phosphorylation substrate
of EGFR and a translocation partner of MLL in acute leukemia, is
significantly mutated with four mutations (4.5%). ADCY2 belongs
to the adenylate cyclase family of enzymes responsible for the
synthesis of cAMP and is mutated in five cases (5.7%). USH2A
mutations in eight tumors (9.1%) including two nonsense mutations were identified in this study, indicating that USH2A might
function as a tumor suppressor. Germline mutations in the USH2A
gene are responsible for the most common subtype of Usher syndrome (USH), a genetic disorder that is a main cause of combined
deaf-blindness (Reiners et al. 2006). Interestingly, three additional
USH-associated genes, GPR98 (8.0%), PCDH15 (6.8%), and MYO7A
(1.1%), are also mutated in this cohort, putatively linking the genetic
causes of Usher syndrome with hepatocarcinogenesis.
JAK1 mutations and functional characterization
JAK1 ( Janus kinase 1) is a member of the Janus kinase family that
mediates the growth factor and cytokine-induced STAT signaling
pathway and plays important roles in immunity, cell growth, and
differentiation. Activating mutations in JAK1 and JAK2 have been
described in patients with various hematologic malignancies, including acute leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)
(Quintas-Cardama et al. 2011). We identified seven distinct protein-altering mutations in JAK1 in eight HCC tumors (9.1%), with
two of the mutations (S703I and S729C) recurring in two tumors.
All mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Six of the
mutations are located in the pseudo-kinase ( JH2) and tyrosine
kinase ( JH1) domains (Fig. 1A). The tandem mutation Q644H/
V645F was recently reported in one HCC tumor (Xie et al. 2009),
and S703I has been independently shown to activate JAK1 in
a mouse model system characterizing IL-9/JAK signaling (Supplemental Fig. 3; Hornakova et al. 2011). We therefore examined
whether the seven JAK1 somatic mutations identified in our study
constitutively activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon expression of
the mutants in HEK293FT and a HCC cell line Hep3B, we observed
increased autophosphorylation of JAK1 (S703I and S729C) and
increased activation of STAT3 (Q644H/V645F, S703I, S729C, and
L910P) compared with wild-type JAK1 (Fig. 1B). No changes in
signaling were observed with the FERM domain mutant N242S or
with the kinase domain mutant G902E. Cytokines such as IL6
activate STAT signaling in HCC cell lines, including Hep3B, and
the presence of such receptor complexes has been shown to mediate mutant JAK1 signaling (Hornakova et al. 2009; Pilati et al.
2011); thus, we sought to examine whether IL6 regulates variant
JAK1 signaling in Hep3B cells. Although JAK1 Q644H/V645F, S703I,
S729C, and L910P constitutively increase JAK/STAT signaling
compared with wild-type, IL6–dependent regulation of the JAK1
mutants is not enhanced beyond wild-type activity (Fig. 1B). We
modeled the interaction between the JH1 and JH2 domains using
a crystal structure of the JH1 domain (3EYG) (Williams et al. 2009)
and a homology model of the JH2 domain oriented to have an
interaction between the first N-terminal a-helices in each domain,
patterned after previous models (Fig. 1C; Flex et al. 2008). Notably,
three of the mutated residues located in the pseudo-kinase domain
that constitutively activate the JAK/STAT pathway (Q644H/V645F,
S703I) are predicted by the model to be at the JH1/JH2 interface.
Mutation of these residues could alleviate the inhibition of JAK1
kinase activity by the pseudo-kinase domain; a negative regulatory
function for the JH2 domain has been established in Janus kinases
(Saharinen and Silvennoinen 2002), and the A634D mutation in
the JAK1 JH2 domain has been reported to up-regulate kinase activity ligand-independently (Flex et al. 2008).
To evaluate the endogenous functional consequences of JAK1
mutations, we performed gene expression profile analysis on the
88 HCC tumors using an independently derived gene signature
Kan et al.

from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with acquired JAK1
mutations that is enriched in genes known to be modulated by
JAK/STAT signaling (Flex et al. 2008). All six HCC tumors harboring JAK1 activating mutations (Q644H/V645F, S703I, S729C, and
L910P) exhibit a strong expression signature as quantified by
principal component analysis (PCA), while the two tumors with
nonactivating mutations (N242S and G902E) do not have the
signature, suggesting a gain-of-function role for these activating
JAK1 mutations in primary HCC tumors (Fig. 1D). To assess oncogenic consequences of the JAK1 activating mutations, we evaluated the ability of each to induce autonomous growth when
expressed in cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Wild-type JAK1 or
selected JAK1 mutants (S703I, S729C, and L910P) were transduced
into Ba/F3 cells, and cell growth was assessed in the absence of the
cytokine IL3. All three mutants conferred IL3–independent
growth; in contrast, cells transduced with wild-type JAK1 remained
dependent on the cytokine for survival, comparable to cells
transduced with vector alone. Among the three activating mutations tested, it appeared that S729C exhibited the most transforming capability (Fig. 1E). JAK2 inhibitors have proven to be
promising therapies for JAK2 mutation driven myeloproliferative
neoplasms (Quintas-Cardama et al. 2011). We evaluated two mutant JAK1 transduced Ba/F3 cell lines for their sensitivity to the
JAK1/2 dual inhibitor ruxolitinib (Quinta´s-Cardama et al. 2010),
and the JAK2 inhibitor BMS-911453 (Purandare et al. 2012).
Ruxolitinib displayed potent growth inhibition on both S703I and
Figure 1. Activating mutations in Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). (A) Seven distinct somatic mutations in JAK1 in the context of protein domains and active sites.
Two mutations (S703I and S729C) are recurrent, found in two samples each. (B) HEK293FT and Hep3B cells were transiently transfected with either empty
vector, Flag-tagged JAK1 WT, or Flag-tagged JAK1 variants for 48 h, serum-starved for 4 h, and in the case of Hep3B, treated with vehicle or 10 ng/mL IL6 for
15 min. Resultant JAK1 and STAT3 activation determined by immunoblotting lysates with anti-pJAK1 ( Y1034/1035) and -pSTAT3 ( Y705), respectively.
Comparable expression of Flag-tagged JAK1 constructs and protein loading was confirmed using anti-M2 Flag and -beta actin. Representative result is
shown in two to six independent experiments. (C ) A model of the interaction between the JAK1 JH1 and JH2 domains was generated using the crystal
structure of the JH1 domain (3EYG) and a homology model of the JH2 domain built using Discovery Studio (accelrys.com). The two residues reported to be
in contact (Lys 924 and Glu 637) that were used to orient the domains are highlighted (gray CPK), as are the seven residues found to be mutated in this study
(green CPK), and the small-molecule CP-690,550 bound in the JH1 ATP site (ball-and-stick). (D) Tumor samples are ranked by JAK1 activation scores based on
independently derived JAK1 gene expression signature (Flex et al. 2008). Colors indicate JAK1 mutation statuses and whether the mutation is activating in

absence of IL3 in triplicate. Cell numbers were counted at indicated time points and data presented as mean 6 SD. (F) JAK1 activating mutant (S703I and
S729C)-transduced cells were treated with either ruxolitinib or BMS-911453 for 3 d. Cell viability was measured and data presented as mean 6 SD.

S729C transduced cells, whereas BMS-911453 only showed a partial inhibitory effect (Fig. 1F), and growth inhibition by ruxolitinib
correlated with its complete inhibition of downstream STAT3
phosphorylation (Supplemental Fig. 4). The differing cellular
activity observed with the two JAK compounds may be due to
ruxolitinib being a 100-fold more potent inhibitor of the JAK1
enzyme (i.e., JAK1 IC50 of 3.3 nM for ruxolitinib vs. 356 nM for
BM-911453). Taken together, these results suggest that the JAK1
mutations identified in this study are potentially oncogenic
drivers in HCC through constitutive activation of downstream
signaling.
Copy number changes
The landscape of copy number variations (CNVs) in HCC genomes
is predominated by large-scale amplifications and deletions of
chromosomal arms or entire chromosomes (amplified: 1q, 5p, 6p,
8q, 17q, 20q, and Xq; deleted: 4p-q, 8p, 13p-q, 16p-q, 17p, 21p-q,
and 22q) (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Table 7; Supplemental Fig. 5). We
performed a GISTIC analysis adapted to WGS data and revealed
1967 genes in 104 amplified regions and 2604 genes in 262 deleted
regions (Supplemental Tables 8, 9). In total, 7.8% of the genome is
amplified with an average gain of 0.65 copies, and 10.5% of the
genome is deleted with an average loss of 0.77 copies. In significantly amplified or deleted regions, the G-scores of amplification
for oncogenes as classified by Cancer Gene Census (Futreal et al.
2004) are threefold higher on average than tumor suppressors
(0.079/0.025), whereas G-scores of deletion for tumor suppressors
are 2.7-fold higher than oncogenes (0.244/0.095) (Supplemental
Fig. 6). Outside of CNV regions, however, there is little difference
overall in G-scores between oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The
selective amplification of oncogenes and deletion of tumor suppressor genes suggest that these broad copy number changes in
HCC genomes likely contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.
Applying a filter based on cis-correlation of DNA copy numbers
and mRNA expression levels (see Methods), we focused on 685 candidate driver genes in amplified regions and 821 genes in deleted regions, including many known and putative oncogenes—MDM4 (1q),
ELK4 (1q), PARP1 (1q), MYC (8q), PTK2 (8q), CCND1 (11q), FGF19
(11q), RPTOR (17q), and IRAK1 (Xq)—and tumor suppressors—
ARID1A (1p), FBXW7 (4q), PTK2B (8p), CDKN2A/B (9p), RB1 (13q),
AXIN1 (16p), TP53 (16q), and MAP2K4 (16q) (Fig. 2B). FGF19 along
with CCND1 in the 11q13.3 amplicon were identified as two driver
genes in HCC by a functional genomics screening (Sawey et al. 2011).
We found that the CCND1/FGF19 region is focally amplified in four
samples (4.5%) with the highest amplitude among all genes, and the
amplification is concordant with a significant increase in gene expression (Fig. 2C). RSPO2, a member of the R-spondin family that
activates beta-catenin signaling through LGR receptors (de Lau et al.
2011), had a similar pattern of overexpression driven by amplification. Conversely, well-known tumor suppressors such as TP53, RB1,
CDKN2A, and CDKN2B reside in the most frequently deleted regions
in HCC genomes. Other genes in regions that are frequently deleted
include FBXW7,ARID1A, and MAP2K4, consistent with their putative
roles as tumor suppressors.
Frequently altered cancer pathways
To further elucidate the functional impact of the complex alterations observed in HCC genomes, we performed an integrative
analysis of somatic mutation, CNV, and HBV integration mapped
to canonical cancer pathways from MSigDB (Liberzon et al. 2011),
and identified frequent alterations across multiple pathways, including Wnt, JAK/STAT, G1/S cell cycle, and apoptosis (Supplemental Table 10; Supplemental Fig. 7). Pathway enrichment analysis (see Methods) further identified significant overlaps (FDR < 0.1)
with cell adhesion, DNA repair, and chromatin modification pathways (Supplemental Table 10).
The Wnt pathway drives proliferation, maintains survival and
promotes stemness in cancer cells (Klaus and Birchmeier 2008), and
plays a well-known role in HCC tumorigenesis (Whittaker et al.
2010; Fatima et al. 2011). Overall, 62.5% of tumors in the cohort
contain genomic alterations composed of SNV and CNV affecting
core components of the Wnt pathway (Fig. 3A). Nonsynonymous
somatic mutations occur in 23.9% of the tumors, including mutations in CTNNB1 (15.9%) and components of the destruction
complex (APC and AXIN1/2) at a frequency of 8.0%. In addition, the
tumor suppressor AXIN1 (Satoh et al. 2000) was deleted in 11.4% of
tumors. Proximal to the destruction complex, amplifications were
detected both in the pathway ligands (WNT9A, 25.0%; RSPO2,
21.6%) and in a pathway receptor (FZD6, 21.6%). It remains to be
determined which genomic lesions translate into aberrant Wnt
pathway activation in these tumors as measured by nuclear betacatenin staining or the presence of a Wnt pathway signature. While
the majority of the tumors in this study harbor genetic lesions of
Wnt pathway components, activation of Wnt signaling can occur in
additional or overlapping tumor cases through down-regulation of
SFRP1 and DACT1 gene expression, known negative regulators of
Wnt and Dvl family proteins, respectively (Kawano and Kypta 2003;
Yau et al. 2005). Hepatocytes are capable of rapid regeneration and
proliferation through activating the stem cell compartment in response to chronic liver damages inflicted by hepatitis, cirrhosis, and
other hallmark conditions of HCC. An earlier study has shown that
28%–50% of HCCs express markers of liver progenitor cells, suggesting a link between HCC and these constantly proliferating stem
cells (Mishra et al. 2009). Frequent mutations in the Wnt pathway
revealed in this study, coupled with the observation that the recently identified R-Spondin receptor LGR5 (de Lau et al. 2011), an
adult stem cell marker and beta-catenin target, is up-regulated in
HCC further strengthens the hypothesis that HCC may have a significant stem cell lineage.
The pathogenesis of HCC is frequently linked to inflammatory responses triggered by chronic viral infection and cell
necrosis. Cytokine-induced JAK/STAT pathway activation can lead
to tumor-promoting inflammation in HCC, where the majority of
cases were shown to harbor activated STAT3 (He and Karin 2011).
Our findings of prevalent and activating JAK1 mutations shed light
on a heretofore underappreciated role for JAK1 in promoting
STAT3 signaling and hepatocarcinogenesis. Further, as much as
45.5% of the HCC tumors harbor genomic alterations in the JAK/
STAT pathway, including frequent amplification and mutation of
the cytokines PRL, IL7, and IL20, and the cytokine receptors IL6ST,
IL6R, and IL21R (Fig. 3B), although it remains to be determined if
these genetic alterations would lead to JAK/STAT pathway activation. It has been demonstrated experimentally that GNAS mutations activate STAT3 to induce inflammatory responses in a rare
subtype of inflammatory liver cancer, suggesting cross-talk of the
cAMP and JAK/STAT pathways (Nault et al. 2011). We noted that
adenylate cyclase type 2 (ADCY2), an important member of the
cAMP synthesis pathway activated by GNAS, is mutated in 5.7% of
this HCC cohort. Furthermore, GNAS and four other members of
the adenylate cyclase family (ADCY3, -8, -9, and -10) are also
mutated in one case each. Taken together, our findings suggest that
the JAK/STAT pathway, potentially acting in concert with the

G-protein/cAMP pathway, may induce inflammatory responses
that promote carcinogenesis in a substantial subset of HCC.
HCC genomes suffer extensive damage in the form of largescale copy number alterations and viral integrations, which if left
unchecked, would be expected to trigger TP53-mediated apoptosis
and cell cycle arrests. Frequent mutations and deletions of TP53
appear to have disabled this important line of cellular defense in an
aggregate of 43.2% of HCC tumors, which are more chromosomal
instable and have poor survival. We found that up to 42.0% of
HCC tumors harbor genomic alteration in the genes operating the
G1/S check point of the cell cycle (Fig. 3C). RB1, a key inhibitor of
cell cycle progression, harbors nonsense mutations in three cases
(3.4%) and genomic deletion in 11 cases (12.5%). CDKN2A and
CDKN2B, which negatively regulate CDK activities, are deleted in
10.2% and 12.5% of the cases, respectively. On the other hand,
promoters of cell cycle progression are activated by DNA amplification (CCND1, 4.5%) and HBV integration (CCNE1, 4.5%),
resulting in markedly higher gene expression. The apoptosis
pathway, an executor of cell death, could be deactivated by DNA
copy number changes in as much as 45.5% of HCC tumors (Fig.
3D). Death receptors such as TNFRSF10A/B are deleted in 22.7% of
cases, and downstream signaling is further disrupted by genomic
deletions of TRADD, CASP3, CASP9, DFFA, and DFFB. In contrast,
XIAP, an inhibitor of caspases and apoptosis is amplified in 8.0% of
tumors. Hence, the functions of TP53-related pathways such as
the G1/S check point and apoptosis also appear to be genetically
altered through selective activation and deactivation of key
regulators.
HCC molecular classification
Three HCC subclasses (S1, S2, and S3) have been identified based
on a meta-analysis of nine gene expression profiling studies
(Hoshida et al. 2009). While gene expression signatures and some
clinical phenotypes for each subclass have been described, the
underlying genetic alterations remain largely unknown. We also
clustered 88 HCC tumors in our study into three subclasses based
on gene expression array data and applying supervised methods
using previously defined gene signatures (Fig. 4A; Hoshida et al.
2009). To delineate the genetic basis of the HCC subclasses, SNV,
CNV, and HBV integration data for significantly altered genes and
pathways were mapped to three subclasses, revealing distinct
genetic profiles for each subclass (Fig. 4B,D; Supplemental Fig. 8,
Supplemental Tables 12, 13). S1 and S2 express high level of genes
involved in cell cycle control and cell proliferation. Most S1 and S2
tumors are poorly or moderately differentiated with a high rate of
recurrence. A subset of S1 and S2 tumors harbors HBV integration
into the KMT2B gene locus. S1 tumors also express a high level of
Figure 3. Frequently altered cancer pathways in HCC. Core pathway analysis identified frequent genomic alterations in multiple cancer pathways,
including (A) Wnt, (B) JAK/STAT, (C ) G1/S cell cycle, and (D) apoptosis pathways. Alterations include somatic mutation, DNA copy number changes
correlated with gene expression, and HBV integration. Alteration frequency was represented as a percentage of all cases harboring a genomic alteration in
one of the pathway genes shown. Gene expression up- or down-regulation in tumor relative to normal samples is shown but not included in the calculation
of alteration frequencies. Alteration types and frequencies were represented by different colors and color gradients, respectively.

genes in immune response and angiogenesis. S2 has the highest
frequency of TP53 mutation and the highest serum AFP level. S3
tumors are well or moderately differentiated with a gene expression profile reflecting normal liver function. In addition, S3 has
relatively high frequency of CTNNB1 and JAK1 mutations and has
HBV integration into the TERT gene locus. Integrative analysis of
gene expression profiles, genetic alterations, and clinical characteristics appears to at least partially explain the observed difference
in progression-free survival of these subclasses (Fig. 4C).
Potentially actionable genetic alterations
Our findings of several mutations and gene amplifications in HCC
have clinical implications (Table 2). Inhibitors of these enzymes or
key components of the pathways are already in clinical development
for non-HCC indications. The prevalence of these genetic alternations in HCC discovered from our study warrants testing some of
these existing inhibitors in HCC preclinical models and patients.
Recurrent JAK1 mutations in HCC have not been reported
previously. Nine percent of HCC tumors in this cohort have JAK1
mutations. The majority of mutations reside in the pseudo-kinase
and kinase domains and are functionally activating, and mutantinduced cell growth can be suppressed by the JAK1/2 dual inhibitor
ruxolitinib. Our data suggest ruxolitinib, recently approved by the
FDA to treat myelofibrosis (Mesa et al. 2012), should be considered
for testing in HCC patients with activating JAK1 mutations.
Preclinical studies have shown that cell lines with elevated cyclin
D1 and decreased CDKN2A (also known as p16) expression are most

sensitive to cyclin D kinase 4/6 inhibitors (Finn et al. 2009).
PD-0332991, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, is being tested in advanced
breast cancer with CCND1 amplification and/or loss of CDKN2A
(p16). We observed 4.5% HCC tumors with CCND1 focal amplification and 10.2% with CDKN2A deletion. Our data suggest this subset
of HCC tumors could be candidates of CDK4/6 inhibitor trials.
Two focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) inhibitors
are in phase 1 clinical trials and have demonstrated modest clinical
benefits in a small unselected population. FAK amplification has
been associated with poor survival in breast and gastric cancers (Park
et al. 2011; Yom et al. 2011). With 26.1% of HCC tumors harboring
FAK amplifications, our data suggest testing FAK inhibitors in the
FAK amplified HCC models.
PARP inhibitors such as olaparib have been showing efficacy in
BRCA-deficient ovarian and breast cancer trials (Audeh et al. 2010;
Tutt et al. 2010). We find the DNA repair pathway extensively altered in HCC with PARP1 amplified in 18.2% of cases and mutations
in BRCA1 (1.1%) and BRCA2 (5.7%). Though these alterations remain to be functionally tested, our findings provide empirical evidence for the inclusion of HCC in the PARP inhibitor trials.
The fibroblast growth factor ligand (FGF19) is amplified in
4.5% of HCC tumors. A neutralizing anti-FGF19 antibody blocks
clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of HCC models harboring
FGF19 amplification (Sawey et al. 2011). As a proof-of-concept
study, we tested the FGFR small-molecule inhibitor PD173074 in
a panel of 14 HCC cell lines for inhibition of cell proliferation.
Indeed those HCC cell lines harboring FGF4/FGF19 amplification
and overexpressing FGFR3/FGFR4 display increased sensitivity to
PD173074 (Supplemental Table 14). Based on our data and the
emerging preclinical data, we propose to test FGFR inhibitors including brivanib, a dual VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor, which is being
evaluated in phase 3 HCC trials, in HCC patients with FGF amplifications and FGFR overexpressions.
Discussion
The results of this study highlight important differences between
HCC and other solid tumors such as lung, breast, prostate, and colon
cancers. While EGFR, PI3K, and MAPK pathway alterations are common in other cancer types, Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT are the
two major oncogenic pathways in HCC. These findings may explain
why some targeted therapies that are effective in other tumor types
have not demonstrated significant improvement on HCC patient
survival. Cataloging major mutations and pathways by cancer genome sequencing can lead to a better understanding of tumor biology
and the discovery and prioritization of drug targets. The time line of
drug development may be shortened when compounds already in
late-stage preclinical or clinical development for other indications are
available for testing in HCC (Chin et al. 2011). Activating JAK1 mutations discovered from this study fit into the class of so-called actionable mutations, as do amplifications of FAK, CCND1, FGF19, and
PARP, and inactivating mutations in BRCA1 and 2. Most importantly,
this study demonstrates that morbicentric genome sequencing is not
only a powerful tool to study disease biology and identify new drug
targets, but also provides opportunities for promptly translating scientific discoveries into improvements in patient care.
Methods
Samples and genomic analyses
Sample collection, gene expression array analysis, SNP array analysis, and whole-genome sequencing have been described in previous publications (Lamb et al. 2011; Sung et al. 2012). Microarray
data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession
numbers GSE28127 (for SNP arrays) and GSE25097 (for expression arrays). Sequence data have been deposited in the European
Nucleotide Archive (ENA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) under accession number ERP001196 and in GigaDB (http://dx.doi.org/
10.5524/100034).
Somatic mutation detection
Sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using
SOAP2 (Li et al. 2009) followed by removal of PCR duplicates, lowquality (Q < 20), and nonuniquely mapped reads. Mutations in tumor were first predicted by SOAPsnv (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/
SOAPsnv.html) using a sensitive score threshold, and a P-value was
calculated using Fisher’s exact test for all putative mutation sites
based on the distribution of read support for different alleles in tumor and matched normal samples (Supplemental Fig. 9). A somatic
mutation is called if the following criteria were met: (1) read depth
$10 in both tumor and normal samples; (2) read support of mutant
allele in tumor tissue not a result of sequencing error (binomial test,
f = 0.1, P > 0.01); (3) quality score not significantly lower than other
alleles (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P > 0.01); (4) mutant allele frequency change between tumor and adjacent normal $20% and
Fisher’s exact test P < 0.01; (5) mutant allele not significantly
enriched in repeatedly aligned reads; and (6) mutant allele not significantly enriched within 10 bp of 59 or 39 ends of reads (Fisher’s
exact test, P > 0.01).
Indels in tumor samples were predicted by the split reads
(SRiC) method (Zhang et al. 2011). Gapped alignment was performed using BWA aligner (Li and Durbin 2009), allowing only one
gap located >5 bp to either read ends for each mapped read. To
identify somatic indels, all reads from normal samples were aligned
to sequence templates representing reference and variation genotypes for each detected tumor indel. Tumor indels with six or more
matched normal reads as well as those matching dbSNP indel records were filtered as germline indels.
Somatic SNV and indel validation
Genotyping assays were performed via iPLEX MassARRAY system
(Sequenom). Both PCR and MassEXTEND primers for each mutation were in silico designed by MassARRAY Assay design 4.0 software. Multiplex PCR were carried out by GeneAmp PCR System
9700 Dual 384-Well Sample Block Module (Applied Biosystems),
followed by dephosphorylation, single base extention reaction,
and desalting. MassARRAY Nanodispenser RS1000 was used to
automatically spot reactions to 384 SpectroCHIP, which was further placed into the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. All genotype
calls by MassARRAY Typer 4.0 were manually confirmed by examining the spectra for each assay and sample.
Significantly mutated genes analysis
We used the method described previously by Youn and Simon
(2011) to compute the significance of observed mutations on each
gene. The statistical model takes both mutation prevalence and
functional impact into consideration. Functional impact was evaluated as mutation score assigned in the following order: missense <
inframe indel < mutation in splice sites < frameshift indel = nonsense. Different types of missense mutations were also assigned
different scores based on BLOSUM80 matrix. This method assumes
that passenger mutations, including silent and nonsilent mutations, were generated from the same background mutation process.
Incorporating different background mutation rates of each sample,

background distribution of mutation score for each gene was computed. The P-value for each gene was calculated from this background distribution and the test statistics from the observed mutation scores across samples. The P-value was adjusted using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method to estimate the false-discovery rate
(FDR). Significantly mutated genes were selected if FDR #10%.
Validation of JAK1 mutations
We designed 19 pairs of primers that uniquely amplify 24 exons of
JAK1 gene using Primer Premier 5.00 (Premier Biosoft) and Oligo
6.71 (Molecular Biology Insights). PCR was performed on Dual 96-
well GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The 50-mL
reaction contains 13 PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, 200 nM
forward and reverse primers, 2.5 units Taq (Takara Bio), and 20 ng
template DNA. Cycling conditions were 1 min at 94°C for initial
denaturation of the DNA and polymerase activation, followed by
35 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95°C, 30 sec annealing at
62°C;67°C, and 30 sec ;90 sec extension at 72°C. The products
were sequenced by 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All
sequences were analyzed by the Sequencing Analysis Software
version 5.2 (Applied Biosystems).
Experimental characterization of JAK1 mutations
Flag-tagged human JAK1 ORFs for wild-type and mutant variants
(N242S, Q644H/V645F, S703I, S729C, G902E, and L910P) were
cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Anti-M2 Flag HRP and -beta
actin (Sigma), anti-pJAK1 (pY1034/1035), -pSTAT3 (pY705), and
-STAT3 (Cell Signaling) were used for Western blotting. All cell
culture reagents were from Hyclone.
All cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified air.
HEK293FT cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate. Hep3B cells were maintained in MEM/EBSS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM nonessential amino
acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate. For Western blotting experiments,
HEK293FT and Hep3B cell cultures were seeded the day before at
800,000 and 400,000 cells/well, respectively, in a six-well dish and
transfected with a total of 1.5 mg plasmid DNA using Fugene 6
(Roche) or FuGENE HD (Promega) at a ratio of 3:1 (Fugene:DNA).
HEK293FT and Hep3B cells were serum starved 48 h posttransfection in 0% serum for 4 h. Cells were lysed on ice in cold RIPA
buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0; Sigma) plus protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail; Pierce). Cell lysates were sonicated in an ice water bath for 5
min and then centrifuged at 16,500g for 20 min at 4°C. A portion of
the supernatant was removed, mixed 1:1 with 63 Laemmli sample
buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE
and transferred to nitrocellulose using the iBlot dry blotting system
(Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk/TBS-T for
1 h at room temperature. Western blotting was performed using the
aforementioned primary antibodies in 3% BSA/TBS-T, secondary
anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG antibody-HRP conjugates in 1% BSA/TBS-T
(GE Healthcare), and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal
West Pico or SuperSignal West Femto Pierce).
Human JAK1 ORFs for wild-type and mutant variants (N242S,
S703I, S729C, G902E, and L910P) were constructed in the bicistronic retrviral vector pMX-IRES-GFP (Cell Biolabs). Retroviral supernatants were used to infect Ba/F3 cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS and 10% WEHI-3B cell condition media. GFPpositive cells were isolated by flow-cytometric sorting and subsequently expanded. Equal GFP expression levels of transduced
cells were confirmed by FACS analysis. For assaying cytokine
independence, transduced Ba/F3 cells were cultured in the absence
of IL3. Cell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion.
For compound treatment, mutant JAK1 transduced Ba/F3
cells were plated on 96-well plates (2000 cells/well) in RPMI 1640
medium containing 2% FBS. They were treated with compounds at
indicated concentrations for 3 d. Cell viability was measured using
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
For Western blot analysis, JAK1 (S703I)-transduced Ba/F3
cells were treated with 1 mM compounds for 2 h in serum-free
media. Approximately 30 mg of lysate were resolved by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel (BioRad Laboratories). Following
transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was subjected to
immunoblot analysis using pSTAT3 (pY705) and STAT3 antibodies
(Cell Signaling), and mouse a-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Licor Biosciences. The
images were analyzed using Odyssey Imager (Licor Biosciences).
JAK1 pseudo-kinase and tyrosine kinase domain interaction
modeling
We modeled the interaction between the pseudo-kinase and tyrosine kinase domains using a crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain (3EYG) (Williams et al. 2009) and a homology model
of the pseudo-kinase domain oriented to have an interaction between the first N-terminal a-helices in each domain, patterned
after previous models (Flex et al. 2008) using Discovery Studio
(accelrys.com).
JAK1 gene signature analysis
The JAK1 mutation gene signature was derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (Flex et al. 2008). The 112 differentially expressed genes were mapped to expression profiles of our
cohort. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we then computed the first principal component value for each sample as the
JAK1 activation score.
CNV analysis
We used SegSeq (Chiang et al. 2009) to infer somatic copy number
variation (CNV) in HCC genomes using WGS reads. The resulting
copy number segments were mapped to individual genes to determine gene-level copy numbers and copy gain/loss statuses using
thresholds of $3 copies for gain and #1.25 for loss. To infer recurrently amplified or deleted genomic regions, we reimplemented
the GISTIC algorithm (Beroukhim et al. 2007) using copy numbers
in 1-kb windows instead of SNP array probes as markers. G-scores
were calculated for genomic and gene-coding regions based on the
frequency and amplitude of amplification and deletion affecting the
gene respectively. A significant CNV region is defined as having
amplification G-score >0.08 or deletion G-score <0.09, corresponding to a P-value threshold of 0.05 from permutation-derived null
distribution (Beroukhim et al. 2007). For each gene, we calculated
the Pearson correlation coefficient between gene-level copy numbers and mRNA gene expression levels previously published (Lamb
et al. 2011). A gene was defined to be ‘‘cis-correlated’’ if its Pearson
correlation coefficient is $0.3 and its gene expression fold-change
in CNV versus non-CNV tumor samples is consistent with the direction of CNV ($1.25 for amplified and #0.8 for deleted genes).
Canonical pathway analysis
Thirty-three canonical cancer pathways were selected from
MSigDB (Liberzon et al. 2011). For each gene and tumor sample,

also called an event, a binary status (1, altered; 0, no change) is
determined for somatic mutation, cis-correlated CNV, and HBV
integration. The integrated alteration status is simply a sum of
three alteration statuses. Pathway alteration prevalence is represented at the sample-level as the proportion of tumors harboring
alteration in any pathway gene. In addition, prevalence is calculated at the event level as the percentage of events altered and gene
level as the percentage of pathway genes harboring one or more
alterations.
Pathway enrichment analysis
Pathway enrichment analyses of genes harboring somatic SNV or
CNV were performed using the KEGG or Gene Ontology canonical
pathways. P-values were calculated based on hypergeometric distribution with FDR correction using the Benjamini and Hochberg
method (Hochberg and Benjamini 1990). GO term enrichment
analysis was performed using only the FAT terms and DAVID
(Dennis et al. 2003).
HCC molecular classification
A previously defined 619-gene signature for three HCC subclasses
and binary weights for each gene were used to define cluster centroid. Each of the 88 HCC samples in the current study was
assigned to the closest centroid based on expression of the 619-
gene signature. A permutation test was used to assess the statistical
significance, and an FDR of 0.05 was used to define high-confidence class assignment. To identify genes overexpressed in each
subclass, t-tests were carried out to compare gene expressions in
each subclass with those in the rest of HCC samples. A P-value
<0.05 and fold change >1.5 were used to define statistical significance. Significantly overexpressed genes in each subclass were
subsequently mapped to gene ontology, and significantly overrepresented gene ontology terms were identified based on hypergeomatric distribution with a false discovery rate <0.1.
