Abstract Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a
central regulator in chronic liver disease contributing to
all stages of disease progression from initial liver injury
through inflammation and fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver-damage-induced levels of active
TGF-β enhance hepatocyte destruction and mediate hepatic
stellate cell and fibroblast activation resulting in a woundhealing response, including myofibroblast generation and
extracellular matrix deposition. Being recognised as a major
profibrogenic cytokine, the targeting of the TGF-β signalling pathway has been explored with respect to the
inhibition of liver disease progression. Whereas interference with TGF-β signalling in various short-term animal
models has provided promising results, liver disease
progression in humans is a process of decades with
different phases in which TGF-β or its targeting might
have both beneficial and adverse outcomes. Based on
recent literature, we summarise the cell-type-directed
double-edged role of TGF-β in various liver disease stages.
We emphasise that, in order to achieve therapeutic effects,
we need to target TGF-β signalling in the right cell type at
the right time.

Introduction
Chronic liver diseases (CLD) and its end-stages, cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are leading causes of
morbidity and mortality worldwide with enormous socioeconomic costs. Patients with liver cirrhosis are at high risk
of deadly hepatic failure and well over 80% of HCC
develop on a cirrhotic background. HCC ranks as the fifth
most common cancer and, with over 600,000 deaths per
annum, it constitutes a major global health problem (Parkin
et al. 2005; Venook et al. 2010). The main aetiologies of
CLDs are chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infections, alcohol abuse and, as a result of
metabolic syndrome reaching epidemic proportions, an
increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH).
Liver transplantation is currently the only available
therapy for terminal liver failure. With donor organs being
limited, preventive measures and the development of new
therapies for CLDs are in high demand. Prevention aims at
eliminating the source of damage. In alcoholic liver disease,
this obviously means avoiding further alcohol consumption.
The addictive behaviour of patients, however, puts a serious
limitation to the efficiency of this prevention strategy. HBV
and HCV infections, representing about one third of CLD
aetiologies, are combatted with virostatic treatments, thus
improving patient conditions to some extent. The infections
can, however, not be fully abrogated, severely reducing the
efficiency of such therapy for this subset of CLDs.
Viral activity, chemical toxicity and metabolic overload
cause damage and death to hepatocytes. This liver injury
triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular reactions
geared towards damage limitation, removal or repair of
damaged cells, defence against further infection, tissue
repair and regeneration. Central to the natural response to
injury is inflammation induced by a large battery of
signalling molecules and executed by a variety of dedicated
cells, repair by activated myofibroblasts, which produce the
fibrous tissue and parenchymal cell proliferation, both of
which are required for filling the holes caused by damage.
Together, these cellular and molecular events release the
enormous natural regenerative potential of the liver.
In CLD, hepatocyte damage, wound healing and tissue
remodelling go awry, resulting in fibrosis and ultimately
cirrhosis, the platform on which HCC and deadly hepatic
failure develop. At the cellular and molecular level, the
multistep process of progressive CLD is reflected in the
complex modulation of intracellular signal transduction
circuits, altered cell-cell communications and, more drastically, an altered differentiation state of most liver resident
cell types. Evidently, the dissection of these pathways is
critical for the development of drugs and therapies. As is
well recognised, the multifunctional cytokine transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β plays a pivotal role in the sequence
of events leading to end-stage CLD, although the complexity of the underlying aberrant responses that, in the various
liver cell types and at the organ level, lead to the drastic
changes seen in CLD and HCC is not understood in detail
(Dooley et al. 2009; Gianelli et al. 2011; Matsuzaki 2009).
To set the stage, we will first discuss the current knowledge
of cellular communication and molecular mechanisms
associated with CLD initiation and progression and
thereafter address the role of TGF-β therein.
Cellular mechanisms mediating CLD initiation
and progression
The hepatic response to injury undergoes various phases
and involves various cell types. The initial event is liver
epithelial cell stress, resulting in necrotic and/or apoptotic
death. Death-mediated signals induce the activation of
Kupffer and stellate cells, which orchestrate an inflammatory
and wound-healing response that might lead to tissue
regeneration and repair in an acute setting or to fibrogenesis,
cirrhosis and cancer when injury occurs chronically. Below,
we discuss the diverse phases that trigger disease progression
and the process of liver regeneration.
Cell damage and death CLDs are characterised by persistent hepatocyte damage and death, induced by either
chemical toxicity, metabolic overload resulting in high
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or viral/microbial
activity causing metabolic deregulation (Rombouts and
Marra 2010). In non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver
disease, the first signs of cell stress are hepatocyte
ballooning and lipid droplet storage. This process is known
as steatosis, which is (highly) reversible and does not
necessarily lead to cell damage. In the case of cholestasismediated injury, bile duct epithelial cells (BDECs) rather
than hepatocytes are the primary target of damage, bile
reflux being the major inducer of this type of injury. Several
modes of cell death have been classified in the damaged
liver, including apoptosis and necrosis. Hepatocyte death
triggers a cascade of reactions initiated actively by specific
messengers and signalling molecules or simply by molecules released because of cell damage. The response is
aimed towards damage limitation, removal or repair of
damaged cells, wound closure, defence against further
infection and tissue repair and regeneration. A highly
interesting recent observation suggests that, upon liver
damage, hedgehog ligand production is upregulated in
246 Cell Tissue Res (2012) 347:245–256

dying liver epithelial cells to re-initiate a signalling pathway
that controls progenitor cell fate and tissue construction
during development, thus inducing progenitor cell expansion and liver regeneration (Omenetti et al. 2011).
Liver regeneration The liver possesses an enormous regenerative capacity. In experimental partial hepatectomy (PHx)
models, full liver mass is restored within 5–6 days after
two-thirds PHx in rats or mice. This is achieved by one to
two rounds of replication of any remaining hepatocytes.
Key events and signalling pathways that control hepatocyte
proliferation have been extensively investigated and have
been summarised (Michalopoulos 2007; Bohm et al. 2010).
However, in some settings, the potency of the toxic
xenobiotic or the amount of damaged cells might cause the
death of a large number of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.
Then, hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) with bi-potential
capacity, residing in the ductules and canals of Hering,
differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes,
depending on the cell compartment that is damaged the most
(Michalopoulos 2011). Rapid hepatic failure occurs if hepatic
regeneration based on mature hepatocytes/cholangiocytes
and HPC proliferation cannot replenish dead liver cells and
liver architecture (Duncan et al. 2009).
Inflammation Hepatitis is a central mechanism of disease
progression and a marker of serious liver disease (Weber et
al. 2011). It encompasses a complex inflammatory response
induced by a battery of signalling molecules and is
executed by a variety of cells. The process is initiated by
mutual activation of stellate and Kupffer cells that together
provide a cytokine milieu triggering massive infiltration of
mononuclear cells, which include macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells. Lymphocytes are
mobilised and stimulated by contact with antigen to
produce lymphokines that further activate macrophages.
Cytokines and chemokines from activated macrophages, in
turn, stimulate lymphocytes, thus setting the stage for a
persistent inflammatory response (Wynn 2004; Heymann et
al. 2009).
Evidence is accumulating for the plasticity of liver
macrophages, including Kupffer cells, depending on the
surrounding cytokine milieu: NF-κB- and AP1-driven proinflammatory (M1) or Stat6 and peroxisome proliferationactivated receptor-directed anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes are generated and correspondingly impact on subsequent cellular processes (Vats et al. 2006).
Fibrosis The activated (myo)fibroblast is the cell type
responsible for wound closure and fibrosis (reflecting
persistent wound-healing activity attributable to chronic
damage) in any CLD. Several potential sources for this
critical mediator exist, including bone-marrow-derived
fibrocytes or circulating mesenchymal cells, which can
migrate through the injured liver and become myofibroblasts (Friedman 2008; Bataller and Brenner 2005).
Resident cells, e.g. tissue fibroblasts located in the portal
tract of the liver or quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC)
located in the Space of Disse, might also be activated to
become myofibroblasts (Friedman 2000). Whether hepatocytes, cholangiocytes or even endothelial cells undergo a
transition into activated fibroblasts under certain circumstances remains controversial (Popov and Schuppan 2010).
The predominance of evidence still supports a central role
for the quiescent HSC becoming activated by cytokine
signalling, turning into myofibroblasts and then producing
the fibrous scar that can be found in CLD.
Cirrhosis is not simply extensive fibrosis but is characterised by architectural disruption, aberrant hepatocyte
regeneration, nodule formation and vascular changes. The
chance of a reversal from a cirrhotic to normal liver
architecture remains controversial and corresponding data
are discussed, for example by Iredale (2007). On the other
hand, no doubt exists that the resolution of liver fibrosis can
occur, e.g. it is initiated by apoptosis and senescence as
orchestrated biological processes to eliminate fibrogenic
cells (Friedman 2010; 2008).
Based on a multitude of data from rat or mouse HSCs
and animal models of liver damage, several conclusive
statements about liver fibrosis can be drawn: (1) oxidative
stress induces hepatocyte damage and HSC and Kupffer
cell activation, resulting in liver fibrosis, (2) TGF-β is
required for liver fibrosis and (3) the blunting of TGF-β
signalling reduces fibrogenesis.
Carcinogenesis In cirrhotic livers, macroregenerative nodules that display foci of hepatocyte dysplasia are considered
to be pre-neoplastic lesions of HCC. Histologically, these
dysplastic lesions are classified as small cell or large cell
lesions or as foci of adenomatous hyperplasia, whereby
small cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are the
predominant preneoplastic lesions (Roskams and Kojiro
2010). Our present lack of a unified comprehensive
understanding of liver carcinogenesis is partially attributable to HCC being initiated in multiple genetic and
environmental contexts and almost certainly emerging as a
consequence of multiple pathways (Whittaker et al. 2010).
This limitation regarding the pathogenesis of HCC has also
prevented the development of effective, targeted, preventive
or therapeutic interventions.
Recent analyses by using genome-wide approaches and
improved animal models have initiated new and promising
attempts at subclassifying the apparently highly heterogeneous HCC into distinct molecular and prognostic subtypes
(Lee and Thorgeirsson 2006). The generally accepted
paradigm of hepatocarcinogenesis is that malignant transCell Tissue Res (2012) 347:245–256 247

formation occurs through the stepwise accumulation of
genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the progressive acquisition of cancer phenotypes. On the other hand,
more recent studies have led to the concept that a minimum
number of molecular alterations leads to the acquisition of
the key cancer phenotype, namely unconstrained cell
proliferation (Hoshida et al. 2010; Dooley et al. 2009).
This “cancer platform” concept proposes that, in a
physiological context, growth-promoting pathways are
coupled with the activation of control mechanisms such as
cellular senescence or apoptosis that limit their growth
effects, producing a natural homeostasis of tissue mass.
Inactivation of the latter during oncogenic events then
results in unconstrained proliferation. Additionally, the
existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) is now being intensely
investigated in liver and HCC, since proliferation of stem
cells is a frequent and permanent process in this organ and
since the accumulation of adverse molecular events, e.g.
mutations, bears a high risk of CSC generation (Mishra et
al. 2009). Such cancer stem cells, depending on their fate at
the time point of carcinogenic conversion, could account
for the development of HCC or cholangiocarcinoma (CCC).
Thus, in CLD upon initial chronic liver damage, various
progression phases can be distinguished in which a
complexity of cellular crosstalk occurs. TGF-β has a
pivotal role in orchestrating and regulating the
corresponding phenotypes of CLD (Fig. 1). Upon liver
damage, TGF-β production is initiated in non-parenchymal
liver cells, e.g. granulocytes, macrophages (especially
Kupffer cells) and HSC (Nakatsukasa et al. 1990), whereas
fully differentiated epithelial cells do not express TGF-β.
Interestingly, hepatocytes appear to absorb and store
significant amounts of latent TGF-β in the cytoplasm and
this might be activated and available upon damage, thus
contributing to the initiation of HSC activation and the
wound-healing process (Roth et al. 1998). Of note,
hepatocytes under culture conditions lose polarity and
activate survival signalling pathways, thus gaining a
fibroblastoid phenotype and the facility of autonomous
TGF-β production (Dooley et al. 2008).
TGF-β signal transduction in liver cells
Hepatic stellate cells HSCs are a primary target for active
TGF-β in CLD. Results of experiments in which TGF-β is
misexpressed in liver by using adenovirus or transgenic
TGF-β mice have revealed an important contribution of
TGF-β to HSC activation and fibrogenesis (Kanzler et al.
1999; Hellerbrand et al. 1999; Ueberham et al. 2003). Upon
its activation and phenotypic transdifferentiation, the TGFβ response in this cell type changes. Whereas plateletderived growth-factor-induced proliferation of quiescent
HSC is antagonised by TGF-β, transdifferentiated myofibroblasts demonstrate a growth stimulatory effect in
response to TGF-β (Dooley et al. 2000). α1 (Nieto et al.
2001) and α2 (Inagaki et al. 1995) type (I) pro-collagen,
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and −2 (Herbst et al.
1997) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (Knittel
et al. 1996) have been identified as direct TGF-β target
genes in this cell type, whereas the transcriptional activation of myofibroblast markers α-smooth muscle actin
(SMA) and connective tissue factor (CTGF) are induced
in a TGF-β-independent manner. Instead, TGF-β signalling
is required for α-SMA organisation and stress-fibre
formation (Dooley et al. 2003; Uemura et al. 2005).
Quiescent HSC respond to TGF-β treatment by Smad
activation and display a functional negative feedback
regulation via the induction of Smad7. In contrast,
myofibroblasts are fully stimulated via autocrine TGF-β
signalling and display a strong intrinsic R-Smad activation
and, importantly, lack Smad7 upregulation (Stopa et al.
2000b; 2000a; Dooley et al. 2000; 2001a, 2001b; Liu et al.
2003). Tahashi and co-workers (2002) have confirmed this
finding with myofibroblasts isolated from chronically
injured rat livers; they conclude that the lack of Smad7
induction as observed in myofibroblasts in CLD could be
one reason for excessive TGF-β effects during the
progression of liver fibrosis.
Several studies have identified Smad3 as being the main
mediator of the fibrogenic response of HSC, especially with
respect to the induction of collagen expression (Schnabl et
al. 2001; Furukawa et al. 2003; Inagaki et al. 2001a; 2001b;
Seyhan et al. 2006). p38/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)/
MAP kinase (MAPK)-mediated Smad3 linker phosphorylation has been reported to be associated with HSC
migration and disease progression (Yoshida et al. 2005;
Furukawa et al. 2003; Matsuzaki et al. 2007). In addition to
affecting the activin receptor-like kinase-5 (ALK5)-Smad3
pathway, TGF-β has been found to mediate its profibrogenic action via the activation of an alternative type I
receptor pathway in HSCs, i.e. the ALK-1-induced Smad1
pathway mediating Id1 expression. Ectopic overexpression
of Id1 enhances HSC activation, whereas its depletion
blunts this TGF-β-induced response (Wiercinska et al.
2006). Furthermore, non-Smad TGF-β signalling via Ras,
Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and MAPK
p42 and p44 signalling has been reported, although the
outcome of these pathways on HSC activation and fibrogenesis has not been extensively studied (Reimann et al.
1997).
Hepatocytes The first investigations of TGF-β effects on
hepatocytes were performed in cultured cells and indicated
that TGF-β counteracted the stimulatory action on DNA
248 Cell Tissue Res (2012) 347:245–256

synthesis by various growth factors such as hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) or
insulin (Hayashi and Carr 1985; Nakamura et al. 1985).
This TGF-β-induced growth arrest in hepatocytes was at
least in part mediated via the interaction of Smad proteins
with Sp1 transcription factors, which induce the expression
of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21
(Moustakas and Kardassis 1998). Consistent with a
cytostatic role for TGF-β in the liver, Fausto et al. (1986)
showed that TGF-β mRNA increases in a late stage of the
regenerating liver after PHx. They further reported that, in
the regenerating as in the normal liver, TGF-β mRNA is
present in non-parenchymal cells but not in hepatocytes
and the authors therefore suggested that TGF-β was a
component of a paracrine regulatory loop controlling
hepatocyte replication (Fausto et al. 1986). Subsequently,
this cytostatic effect could also be shown in cultured
hepatocytes from hepatectomised rat livers (Strain et al.
1987).
In addition to being anti-mitogenic, TGF-β (and activin)
has been found to induce hepatocyte apoptosis (Schwall et
al. 1993; Yasuda et al. 1993; Oberhammer et al. 1991). In

Fig. 1 Pros and cons of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
signalling during the progression of chronic liver diseases. Upon liver
damage caused by many different aetiologies, active TGF-β ligands
show up in the liver and induce downstream signalling in all cell types
investigated. TGF-β is recognised as a major profibrogenic cytokine
and, thus, TGF-β-directed therapies are being investigated for their
capacity to interfere with fibrogenesis and combat disease progression.
Although many of these approaches have shown promising results in
animal disease models for more than a decade, there is currently still
no effective treatment for human disease on the market. This scheme
attempts to explain the difficulties one faces when dealing with
chronic liver diseases in human patients. In animal models, severe
damage from fibrosis and inflammation can be achieved within weeks,
whereas the establishment of end-stage liver disease in humans
usually takes several decades to establish. During that life span, the
liver undergoes many different phases, as shown along the central
time line. Strongly depending on the disease stage, TGF-β and thus its
targeting might have a good (+) or bad (−) outcome in the organ.
TGF-β enhances damage to epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis and
oxidative stress, triggers myofibroblast (MFB) activation and a
wound-healing response, controls or inhibits liver regeneration by
hepatocyte apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, activates regulatory T cells (TReg) and Th17 differentiation to calm down inflammatory responses, causes fibrogenesis and liver scarring in chronic
disease, inhibits the proliferation of premalignant cells, activates
stroma fibroblasts in the neighbourhood of tumour cells, inhibits
tumour-directed inflammatory responses, facilitates tumour angiogenesis and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumour
cells. This multiplicity of outcomes in one organ during the different
stages of one disease clearly reveals the difficulties that we have to
face while directing therapeutic approaches towards TGF-β. One must
select the accurate therapeutic window, target the right cell type and
interfere with the adverse downstream branches of the signalling
pathway. To achieve this, a great deal of basic research is still required
Cell Tissue Res (2012) 347:245–256 249

and programmed cell death induced by Fas, was suggested
to provide the connection between TGF-β receptors and the
apoptotic machinery (Perlman et al. 2001). In another study,
TGF-β-induced apoptosis was shown to be mediated via
Smad-mediated induction of death-associated protein
(DAP) kinase (Jang et al. 2002). Furthermore, TGF-β has
been shown to induce hepatocyte apoptosis via enhanced
expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM (Ramesh et al.
2008).
TGF-β has been found, as for many other epithelial cell
types, to have a biphasic role in HCC. Initially, in the
primary tumour, TGF-β has tumour-suppressive effects. In
agreement with this notion, the reduced availability of
TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) by the ectopic expression
of soluble TβRII in hepatocytes (Kanzler et al. 2001) or by
using heterozygous mice with reduced TβRII expression
(Im et al. 2001) results in enhanced susceptibility to HCC,
confirming the tumour-suppressor function of the TGF-β
signalling pathway. Ectopic expression of mutated Ha-Ras
but not c-myc, has been found to abrogate the cytostatic
effect of TGF-β on hepatocytes (Houck et al. 1989). HCC
cells might become selectively resistant to the cytostatic
effects of TGF-β (Braun et al. 1990) and not lose all
responses to TGF-β, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The latter process in hepatocarcinogenesis was first described by Grotzmann et al. (2002) in
a study of immortalised murine hepatocytes. These hepatocytes display a high degree of differentiation and
undergo cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase following
exposure to TGF-β. They maintain epithelial polarisation,
despite the expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras; however, upon
TGF-β stimulation, they convert into a migratory cell type
with fibroblastoid morphology and proliferation is no
longer inhibited by TGF-β. Without oncogenic Ras, in a
preneoplastic setting, TGF-β might activate the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and induce c-Src phosphorylation leading to Akt activation and cell survival. The
blocking of EGFR signalling then amplifies the apoptotic
response to TGF-β, whereas TGF-β-mediated EMT in
hepatocytes is unaffected (Murillo et al. 2005). This
indicates that the activation of EGFR is required for
impairing cytostatic TGF-β activity but is dispensable for
the EMT process.
Using monolayer and sandwich culture systems, we have
shown that hepatocytes can exist in differentiated and
dedifferentiated states that are reversible and can be
switched by manipulating the responsible key factors of
the signalling network. For example, focal adhesion kinasemediated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
signalling interferes with the cytostatic effects of TGF-β,
thus facilitating fibroblastoid transdifferentiation (EMT).
Abrogating survival signalling resensitises hepatocytes to
TGF-β-induced apoptosis (Godoy et al. 2009; Dooley et al.
2008; Weng et al. 2007). In addition, immortalised, highly
differentiated hepatocytes, when treated with TGF-β,
maintain their epithelial morphology and undergo dramatic
alterations in adhesion, leading to detachment, re-adhesion
and spreading. These alterations in adhesive behaviour are
caused by sequential changes in the expression of α5β1
integrin and its ligand fibronectin (Biname et al. 2008).
CTGF is potently induced by TGF-β and both factors are
thought to play an important role and to cooperate in
fibrogenesis and EMT (Wang et al. 2011; Gressner and
Gressner 2008).
The results described in the preceding paragraph and
from others (Kaimori et al. 2007; Zeisberg et al. 2007)
show that TGF-β, e.g. via the induction of the transcriptional repressor Snail, induces adult mouse hepatocytes to
undergo phenotypic and functional changes typical of EMT.
Whether, however, hepatocyte EMT occurs in vivo during
fibrogenesis is currently under discussion. Zeisberg et al.
(2007) have performed lineage-tracing experiments with
AlbCre-R26RstoplacZ double-transgenic mice and demonstrated that hepatocytes undergoing EMT substantially
contribute to the population of fibroblast-specific protein-1
(FSP1)-positive fibroblasts in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-
induced liver fibrosis. Moreover, Rowe et al. (2011) have
demonstrated that hepatocytes up-regulate the expression of
Snail in vivo during tissue remodelling. Hepatocyte-specific
ablation of Snail demonstrates that this transcription factor
plays a key role in liver fibrosis progression in vivo by
triggering multiple aspects of fibrogenesis, including
growth factor expression, extracellular matrix (ECM)
synthesis and chronic inflammatory responses (Rowe et
al. 2011). In contrast, however, elegant studies from Taura
et al. (2010) have strongly challenged the concept that
hepatocytes in vivo acquire a mesenchymal phenotype
through EMT to produce ECM in liver fibrosis. When
triple-transgenic mice expressing ROSA26 stop βgalactosidase, albumin Cre and collagen α1(I) green
fluorescent protein (GFP) and in which hepatocyte-derived
cells are permanently labelled by β-galactosidase and type I
collagen-expressing cells are labelled by GFP are subjected
to the induction of liver fibrosis by repeated CCl4
injections, no cells with double-positivity for GFP and βgalactosidase can be found, although all β-galactosidasepositive cells exhibit abundant cytoplasm and the typical
morphology of hepatocytes and express none of the
mesenchymal markers including α-SMA, FSP1, desmin
and vimentin. The authors conclude that type I collagenproducing cells do not originate from hepatocytes and that
hepatocytes in vivo neither acquire mesenchymal marker
expression nor exhibit a morphological change that is
distinguishable from normal hepatocytes (Taura et al.
2010). In another similar lineage tracing approach, Wells
and coworkers present even more convincing results that, in
250 Cell Tissue Res (2012) 347:245–256

Alfp-Cre 3 Rosa26-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice,
neither hepatocytes, nor cholangiocytes (or their bipotential
progenitors) display evidence for in vivo colocalisation of
YFP with mesenchymal markers S100A4, vimentin, αSMA or procollagen 1 α2 in three animal models of
chronic liver disease (bile duct ligation, CCl4 and 3,5-
diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (Chu et al. 2011).
Reconciling these apparently contradictory findings will
require further investigations. Nevertheless, if transgenic
mice with upregulated Smad7 expression only in their
hepatocytes are challenged with chronic exposure to CCl4,
they demonstrate significantly diminished liver damage and
fibrosis when compared with controls (Dooley et al. 2008),
indicating that TGF-β signalling in hepatocytes in vivo is
required for fibrogenesis progression, as it is in HSC.
Other cell types of the liver Much less intensely investigated
are the effects of TGF-β on other cell types of the liver, e.g.
BDEC, immune cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells,
although a major influence can be expected in liver
physiology and during CLD. Similar to hepatocytes, TGF-β
might provide cytostatic and tumorigenic effects towards
BDEC, in particular during carcinogenic progression in
cholangiocarcinoma. From many studies in other tissues, an
inhibitory role of inflammation is expected, especially in its
role as a differentiation factor for regulatory T cells (TRegs;
Becker et al. 2006; Korn et al. 2009) and Th17 cells (Tallima
et al. 2009). Finally, the impact of TGF-β as a proangiogenic factor has been well-described (ten Dijke and
Arthur 2007) and will be relevant in the branched sinusoid
network of the liver in the settings of regeneration, cirrhosis
and carcinogenesis.
Targeting TGF-β signalling in animal models for CLD
Various strategies have been pursued to accomplish the
inhibition of TGF-β signalling in fibrosis (Fig. 2), first in
animal studies and then with the objective of being
translated into humans (see next paragraph). These include
(1) sequence-specific anti-sense oligonucleotides that inhibit TGF-β mRNA expression, (2) isoform-selective
neutralising antibodies, soluble TβRII fragments or synthetic peptides that interfere with ligand binding to the
endogenous receptor complex, (3) overexpression of the
natural TGF-β signalling inhibitor Smad7 or cytokines
such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) that induce Smad7 expression,
(4) neutralising antibodies to integrins that interfere with
the activation of latent TGF-β and (5) low-molecularweight inhibitors antagonising the intracellular kinase
activity of TGF-β receptors (Iyer et al. 2005; Pennison
and Pasche 2007; Yingling et al. 2004; Dooley et al. 2003;
Petersen et al. 2008; Weng et al. 2007; Hawinkels and ten
Dijke 2011). Such anti-TGF-β approaches have been
established and successfully used for the treatment of
experimental fibrogenesis. For example, a synthetic peptide
that blocks the interaction of TGF-β with its receptor has
been established to be effective in protection against
CCl4-induced liver fibrosis (Ezquerro et al. 2003).
Further, dominant-negative or soluble TβRIIs have been
applied to suppress fibrosis in mice and rats upon
dimethylnitrosamine-, CCl4- or bile duct ligation-mediated
liver damage (Qi et al. 1999; Ueno et al. 2000; Nakamura et
al. 2000; George et al. 1999; Yata et al. 2002). In part, the
inhibitory effect of soluble TβRII is achieved by interference with oxidative stress, including the generation of ROS
(Cui et al. 2003). Similarly, TGF-β-binding proteins, such
as decorin and antagonistic cytokines, such as bone
morphogenetic protein-7, hepatocyte growth factor,
interleukin-10 or IFN-γ were as efficient as camostat
mesilate, a protease inhibitor that possibly abrogates the
proteolytic activation of TGF-β (Breitkopf et al. 2005).
Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Smad7
in the liver potently blunted bile duct ligation-induced liver
fibrosis and achieved efficient inhibition of intracellular
TGF-β signalling. Bile duct ligation induced profibrogenic
effects in cultured HSCs and in vivo were inhibited (Dooley
et al. 2003). A similar approach with adenovirus-mediated
overexpression of Smad7 successfully interfered with
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice (Nakao et al.
1999).
As mentioned above, experimental evidence exists
showing that Smad3 is the predominant mediator of
fibrogenic TGF-β downstream signalling. Therefore,
strategies to interfere specifically with Smad3 are
promising. In line with this assumption, the targeted
disruption of Smad3 confers resistance to the development of dimethylnitrosamine-induced hepatic fibrosis in
mice (Latella et al. 2009) and against cutaneous injury
induced by ionising radiation (Flanders et al. 2002).
However, small molecule inhibitors announced as specific
for Smad3 (Jinnin et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2006) have not yet
yielded breakthrough results and seem to need further
improvement.
With regard to interference with cancer, recent studies in
G. Giannelli’s lab (Giannelli et al. 2011) have shown that
the inhibition of TGF-β signalling results in multiple
synergistic downstream effects that probably improve the
clinical outcome in HCC. Further, the small molecule
inhibitor LY2109761, which targets TβRI/ALK5 and
TβRII induces a complete abrogation of Smad-dependent
and -independent signalling in human colon carcinoma
cells harbouring activated K-RAS, resulting in reduced
tumour cell invasion and liver metastasis (Zhang et al.
2009).

Therapeutic targeting of TGF-β signalling in CLD
patients
Contrary to the stimulating beneficial outcome of anti-TGFβ treatment in animal disease models (Breitkopf et al.
2006), only limited positive or even adverse results exist for
human disease. For example, metelimumab, a monoclonal
antibody against TGF-β1, has been used to treat systemic
sclerosis. The study was stopped as four patients died
(Denton and Abraham 2004). Other studies involving the
use of lerdelimumab, a monoclonal antibody against TGFβ2, to treat eye scarring (Mead et al. 2003), or GC1008, a
pan-antibody against TGF-β1-3 for lung fibrosis are still
ongoing. Intriguingly, an antisense strategy against TGF-β2
has been successful in the treatment of glioma and is
currently being tested in other malignant tumours such as
pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma and melanoma
(Schlingensiepen et al. 2008).
A major reason that most of these promising results from
animal disease models have not yet robustly been translated
into clinical use is probably the multiplicity of the possible
biological-context-dependent functions of TGF-β. In the
time course of CLD progression, various phases occur, such
as initiation, regeneration, perpetuation, fibrogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Depending on the specific
disease stage, TGF-β may have adverse or beneficial
outcomes as outlined briefly below. Initially, TGF-β

Fig. 2 TGF-β signal transduction pathway and targets for therapeutic
intervention. TGF-β signals via heteromeric transmembrane complexes of type I and type II receptors (TβR) that are endowed with
intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity (ALK activin receptor-like
kinase). Upon type-II-mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor,
the activated type I receptor initiates intracellular signalling by
phosphorylating receptor regulated (R)-Smad2 and Smad3. Activated
R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and these complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they mediate transcriptional
responses. Inhibitory Smad7 antagonises TGF-β/Smad signalling by
competing with R-Smads for receptor interaction and by recruiting E3
ubiquitin ligases to the activated receptor complex and mediating its
degradation. This pathway has been targeted by anti-sense molecules
that inhibit TGF-β mRNA expression, by neutralising antibodies
against TGF-β or TGF-β receptors that interfere with ligand-receptor
interactions, by antibodies that interfere with the activation of latent
TGF-β and by soluble extracellular domains of the type II receptor
that sequester ligand binding to endogenous receptors and small ATP
mimetics of TGF-β receptor kinases. Antagonising pathways, such as
interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and epidermal
growth factor (EGF), can inhibit TGF-β/Smad-induced responses by
stimulating Smad7 expression

the transdifferentiation of HSC to myofibroblasts and thus
mediates a wound-healing response. During regeneration
and hepatocyte proliferation, TGF-β has an important
tissue-mass-limiting cytostatic effect and controls inflammation by generating TRegs. During perpetuation and
fibrogenesis in chronic disease stages, the overwhelming
scar-forming wound-healing reaction is adverse for the
liver. In the pre-malignant stage, the cytostatic effect that
controls epithelial cell proliferation may prevent carcinogenesis. In this context, the negative outcome of TGF-β on
inflammation might inhibit the immune response against
arising tumour cells. In carcinogenesis, when TGF-βcytostatic effects are lost and the signalling branch is
redirected to EMT, TGF-β may favour cancer progression
and metastasis. Furthermore, the pro-angiogenic action of
TGF-β towards endothelial cells may also be important for
tumour progression (Meyer et al. 2010). Thus, an important
consideration for TGF-β-directed treatment of fibroproliferative diseases, such as CLD, is to select the right time
point and cell type for targeted intervention (Fig. 1).
Moreover, an additional challenge is that the selective
inhibition of some but not all TGF-β-induced cellular
responses might be beneficial.
