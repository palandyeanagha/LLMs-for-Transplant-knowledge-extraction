Abstract
The speed of cell migration on 2-dimensional (2D) surfaces is determined by the rate of assembly and disassembly of
clustered integrin receptors known as focal adhesions. Different modes of cell migration that have been described in 3D
environments are distinguished by their dependence on integrin-mediated interactions with the extra-cellular matrix. In
particular, the mesenchymal invasion mode is the most dependent on focal adhesion dynamics. The focal adhesion protein
NEDD9 is a key signalling intermediary in mesenchymal cell migration, however whether NEDD9 plays a role in regulating
focal adhesion dynamics has not previously been reported. As NEDD9 effects on 2D migration speed appear to depend on
the cell type examined, in the present study we have used mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice in which the NEDD9
gene has been depleted (NEDD9 2/2 MEFs). This allows comparison with effects of other focal adhesion proteins that have
previously been demonstrated using MEFs. We show that focal adhesion disassembly rates are increased in the absence of
NEDD9 expression and this is correlated with increased paxillin phosphorylation at focal adhesions. NEDD92/2 MEFs have
increased rates of migration on 2D surfaces, but conversely, migration of these cells is significantly reduced in 3D collagen
gels. Importantly we show that myosin light chain kinase is activated in 3D in the absence of NEDD9 and is conversely
inhibited in 2D cultures. Measurement of adhesion strength reveals that NEDD92/2 MEFs have decreased adhesion to
fibronectin, despite upregulated a5b1 fibronectin receptor expression. We find that b1 integrin activation is significantly
suppressed in the NEDD92/2, suggesting that in the absence of NEDD9 there is decreased integrin receptor activation.
Collectively our data suggest that NEDD9 may promote 3D cell migration by slowing focal adhesion disassembly, promoting
integrin receptor activation and increasing adhesion force to the ECM.

Introduction
Cell adhesion is a prime determinant of the rate of cell
migration speed on 2D surfaces [1]. This is a biphasic effect with
both too much and too little adhesion resulting in decreased
migration speed and persistence. In addition to the contribution
that the concentration of extra-cellular matrix plays in cell speed, a
role for focal adhesion dynamics has also emerged. At the focal
adhesions, clusters of integrin receptors are bound on the external
surface to extra-cellular matrix ligands and are associated with
filaments of polymerized actin in the cytoplasm. The resulting
tensile force generated at the focal adhesions in turn governs
integrin activation and cell motility. Thus, the rate of focal
adhesion assembly and disassembly contributes to 2D cell
migration speed [2–6].
Investigations of cell migration have revealed a number of
different migration strategies that are available to cells [7]. The
mesenchymal mode is characterized by dependence on the
dynamic formation and disassembly of focal adhesions [8]. Recent
studies have revealed that NEDD9 is a major signalling
intermediary in mesenchymal mode migration [9] and although
it has long been know that NEDD9 localizes to focal adhesions
[10,11], the role that NEDD9 plays in regulating focal adhesion
dynamics has not previously been reported. NEDD9/HEF1/CasL is a member of the Cas family of proteins, grouped together
based on a conserved overall protein-protein interaction domain
structure [12]. Other members of the family include p130Cas/
BCAR1, Efs/Sin and HEPL. The Cas proteins are adhesion
docking proteins and through extensive interaction with signalling
partners these proteins play a role in a variety of biological process,
including cell migration. In particular, elevated NEDD9 expression is detected in a range of metastatic cancers and NEDD9 is
considered to be a key pro-metastatic protein [13].

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from genetically
depleted mouse models of the focal adhesion molecules paxillin,
FAK and p130Cas were used to establish that each of these
molecules stimulates focal adhesion disassembly [6,14,15] and
these cells exhibit reduced speed [16–18]. By contrast, vinculin
stabilizes focal adhesions [19,20] and fibroblasts lacking vinculin
expression have more rapid locomotion in 2D migration assays
[21]. We have previously shown that short peptides of NEDD9
dominantly interfere with focal adhesions, causing adhesion
disassembly and cell rounding [11] and more recently NEDD9
depletion has been associated with increased 2D migration in
breast epithelial cells [22] and granulocytes [23]. In contrast, in
other cell backgrounds NEDD9 depletion inhibits cell migration
[24–29]. Thus it appears that NEDD9 may differentially regulate
2D migration speed and focal adhesion dynamics depending on
cell type. Therefore, it is important to establish the role of NEDD9
in focal adhesion dynamics in MEFs, to allow comparison with
reported effects of other focal adhesion proteins, without the
potentially confounding influence of cell-type specific effects.
In contrast to the well-developed models of migration
mechanisms in 2D, the understanding of cell migration in 3D
and the role of focal adhesion molecules in this process is
comparatively less well understood. Indeed, while fibroblasts with
genetically deleted vinculin have increased 2D cell speed,
conversely these cells have decreased speed in 3D collagen gels
[21] and other adhesion proteins similarly give different 2D versus
3D migration outcomes [30]. In 3D environments migrating cells
must overcome a different set of physical constraints than those in
a 2D environment. Notably, not only does vinculin appear to
stabilize focal adhesions, it also regulates cell adhesion force to the
ECM and increases traction forces to the ECM [21]. Together,
these functions of vinculin are likely to regulate the ability of the
cell to negotiate the physical barriers of the 3D environment. The
role of NEDD9 as a key signalling intermediary in mesenchymal
cell invasion that relies on adhesion to the ECM suggests the
possibility that NEDD9 may also regulate adhesion force to the
ECM.
In the present study we employ NEDD92/2 MEFs to show
that NEDD9 stabilizes focal adhesions and increases b1 integrin
receptor activation and adhesion force to the ECM. We show that
NEDD9 depletion from fibroblasts increases 2D migration speed
and conversely, significantly decreases 3D speed and migration
persistence. Together our data reveal an important new role for
NEDD9 in the stabilization of adhesions and adhesion force to the
ECM.
Results
NEDD9 suppresses focal adhesion disassembly
To address whether NEDD9 plays an active role in regulating
focal adhesion turnover we used mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)
expressing endogenous wild-type NEDD9 (WT) and NEDD92/2
MEFs (Figure 1A). Due to the high degree of similarity between
NEDD9 and p130Cas and the known role of p130Cas in
stimulating focal adhesion disassembly in MEFs, we checked for
changes in p130Cas expression the NEDD92/2 MEFs. Importantly, there was no difference in either the expression level or the
phospho-forms of p130Cas (Figure 1A), thus suggesting there is no
compensatory changes in p130Cas in NEDD92/2 MEFs.
Immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells revealed robust focal
adhesion and stress fibre formation in both WT and NEDD9 2/2
MEFs (Figure 1B), indicating that NEDD9 is not essential for the
formation of focal adhesions and stress fibres. We next directly
compared the rates of focal adhesion formation and disassembly in
cells transfected with YFP-tagged paxillin. Rapid focal adhesion
disassembly was observed in regions of protruding membrane
in NEDD9 2/2 MEFs. By contrast in WT MEFs adhesion
disassembly at leading edge appeared slower, with a period of focal
adhesion stability preceding membrane extension. Quantification of
the assembly and disassembly rates revealed that while assembly
rates were essentially equivalent between the two cell lines
(Figure 1C and 1D), disassembly rates were significantly faster in
the NEDD9 2/2 MEFs (Figure 1C and 1E, p,0.001). We
confirmed that there was no difference in the peak YFP-paxillin
fluorescence intensity at focal adhesions in the WT versus NEDD9
2/2 MEFs (Figure S1) thus differences in adhesion disassembly
rates were not due to differences in exogenous YFP-paxillin
expression between the cell lines.
Based on the increased rate of paxillin-positive adhesion
disassembly in the NEDD92/2 MEFs we questioned whether
paxillin phosphorylation was increased in NEDD92/2 MEFs, as
this is associated with increased focal adhesion turnover [4,14].
Fluorescence ratio imaging of fixed WT and 2/2 MEFs coimmunostained with paxillin and phospho-paxillin antibodies
revealed increased paxillin phosphorylation at focal adhesions in
NEDD92/2 MEFs (Figure 2A). Calculation of the ratio of
phoshorylated paxillin at individual adhesions confirmed significantly increased paxillin phosphorylation in the NEDD92/2
MEFs (Figure 2B, p,0.0001). These data are therefore consistent
with the idea that the paxillin focal adhesion disassembly switch is
more active in NEDD92/2 MEFs.
NEDD9 differentially regulates 2D versus 3D cell
migration
Increased rates of focal adhesion disassembly and paxillin
phosphorylation in NEDD92/2 MEFs together suggested that
these cells might migrate more rapidly in 2D cell migration assays.
Indeed, tracking of individual cells and quantification of the Mean
Square Displacement (MSD) revealed that the NEDD92/2
MEFs have significantly faster 2D migration speed (Figure 3A and
3B). To confirm that these effects are directly due to the absence of
NEDD9 we performed a rescue experiment with exogenously
expressed GFP-tagged NEDD9. Importantly, exogenous
GFP.NEDD9 significantly reduced 2D cell migration speed when
compared with GFP control transfected NEDD92/2 MEFs
(Figure 3C and 3D).
We next determined the role of NEDD9 in the 3D migration of
MEFs, comparing NEDD9 WT MEFs, NEDD92/2 MEFs, and
MEFs either exposed to scrambled siRNA controls (control) or
following treatment with siRNA targeting NEDD9 expression
(NEDD9 siRNA). Control western blot analysis confirmed depletion
of NEDD9 protein following NEDD9 siRNA treatment and no
effect on p130Cas (Figure 4A). Analysis of the MSD demonstrated
that both genetic deletion of NEDD9 (2/2) and NEDD9 depletion
with siRNA (NEDD9 siRNA) significantly reduced the migration of
MEFs in 3D collagen gels (Figure 4B). The wild-type MEFs and
control siRNA-treated MEFs migrated through the 3D collagen gels
with greater cell speed (p,0.0001, Figure 4C) and tended to have
increased migration persistence (Figure 4D). Thus, in contrast to the
effects seen in 2D, we find that 3D cultures cells lacking NEDD9
expression have reduced cell migration speed.
Previous reports have demonstrated that Src, FAK, ERK and
MLCK are important regulators of focal adhesion dynamics [15].
Due to the striking difference in motility effects in 2D versus 3D
culture conditions, we therefore employed phospho-antibodies to
analyse the activity of these kinases. This revealed distinct profiles
of kinase activity between cells cultured in 2D and 3D. While ERK
phosphorylation was equivalent between both 2D and 3D culture

conditions, both Src and FAK displayed reduced phosphorylation
in 3D cultures (Figure 5A and B). However, global activation of
these molecules was not affected by the presence of NEDD9 as
there was no difference in Src and FAK phosphorylation between
WT MEF and NEDD92/2 cells in either 2D or 3D cultures. In
contrast, there is a striking differential effect on MLCK activity.
Under 2D culture conditions, MLC-phosphorylation appears to
be significantly reduced in NEDD2/2 MEFs. Conversely MLCphosphorylation is significantly increased in NEDD92/2 MEFs
grown in 3D collagen gels (Figure 5A and B). The observed
increased MLC phosphorylation in the NEDD92/2 MEFs in 3D
collagen gels agrees with earlier reports showing that NEDD9
depletion is accompanied by activation of MLCK [9]. Following
the differential signalling effects in 2D versus 3D, we questioned
whether NEDD9 is also differentially regulated in 2D versus 3D.
NEDD9 is detected as two distinct phospho-forms of 115 kDa and
105 kDa apparent molecular mass [36]. We have previously
shown that 115 kDa NEDD9 is formed in response to integrin
receptor stimulation [11]. Analysis of the NEDD9 phospho-forms
in WT MEFs revealed that 115 kDa NEDD9 is significantly
decreased in 3D cell cultures (Figure 5A and B).
During observation of the time-lapse imaging series, it was
noted that the majority of the NEDD92/2 MEFs had a rounded
appearance in 3D collagen gels and quantification of the
percentage of rounded cells confirmed this (Figure 6A and 6B).
We considered whether the previously described mitotic defects
associated with altered NEDD9 expression levels [31,32] might
account for cell rounding. However this was not the case, as we
observe fewer mitotic events in NEDD92/2 cells in 3D collagen
gels when compared with WT controls (Figure 6C). Based on the
increased rounding and increased levels of MLC phosphorylation,
we questioned whether NEDD9 depletion stimulated a switch to
amoeboid invasion in the MEFs, as has previously been shown in
other cell types [9]. However, the reduced speed of NEDD92/2
MEFs suggests that the observed rounding does not reflect a switch
to an amoeboid mode of migration. The rounded shape of the
NEDD92/2 MEFs, suggested that these cells may have reduced
interaction with the surrounding matrix.
NEDD9 increases adhesion strength and b1 integrin
activation
Following the demonstration that NEDD9 2/2 MEFs have
reduced speed and persistence and are more rounded in 3D

collagen gels, we questioned whether NEDD9 may regulate the
cell adhesion force to the extra-cellular matrix. We first examined
the expression of integrin receptors and found little detectable
expression of the a2 integrin sub-unit of collagen receptors (data
not shown) as has been previously reported for MEFs [21]. By
comparison, the cells were strongly positive for the a5b1
fibronectin receptor and indeed there was a striking increase in
the expression of a5b1 on the NEDD9 2/2 MEFs (Figure 7A).
Correspondingly, immunofluorescence analysis of the distribution
of a5b1 in fixed cells revealed greater organization of a5b1 in focal
adhesions (Figure 7B). Although the 3D cultures are collagenbased, fibronectin is present both in the added serum and can also

be secreted by the MEFs. By immunofluorescence we confirmed
the presence of fibronectin in the 3D gels (Figure 7C). Therefore,
we analysed adhesion force to fibronectin by incubating cells with
fibronectin-coated magnetic beads and exposing them to increasing, lateral pulling force in the range of 0 to 40 nN. The force at
which a bead detached, if at all, was recorded. Importantly,
significantly less force was required to detach the fibronectincoated beads from the NEDD92/2 cells than from the control
cells (Figure 7D). Given that there was reduced adhesion force
despite high levels of a5b1 expression, we questioned whether this
reflects decreased inside-out activation of b1 integrin receptors.
Indeed we observe a striking suppression of activated b1 integrin
receptor (clone 9EG7) on the NEDD92/2 MEFs relative to the
total levels of a5b1 expression (Figure 7E). Thus, despite elevated
a5b1 integrin receptor surface expression, receptor activation was
inhibited. We therefore next determined the sub-cellular distribution of activated b1 integrin. As the antibodies to the a5b1 integrin
and activated b1 integrin are from the same species it was not
possible to co-stain for these two populations. However, in
agreement with the surface expression data (Figure 7E), comparison of the staining patterns for these two antibodies reveals that
while there is greater organization of a5b1 in focal adhesions in
the NEDD92/2 MEFs (Figure 7B), there is no corresponding
increase in the organization of activated b1 integrin (Figure 8A). In
3D collagen gels the WT MEFs display robust stress fibre
formation and activated b1 integrin co-localizes with stress fibres
(Figure 8B). In contrast, the majority of the NEDD92/2MEF
cells were rounded and lacked obvious stress fibres. In those
NEDD92/2 MEFs in which stress fibres were evident, there is no
corresponding organization of activated b1 integrin (Figure 8B).
Thus, together these data suggest that lack of NEDD9 may
decrease 3D cell speed by reducing integrin receptor activation
and adhesion force to the ECM.
Discussion
Previous studies have used MEFs derived from mice in which
focal adhesion molecules have been genetically deleted to
investigate the function of these molecules in focal adhesion
dynamics [15]. In the present study, we have used the same
approach to investigate the role of NEDD9 and show that the lack
of this protein appears to increase focal adhesion turnover in these
cells, accompanied by increased cell migration speed in 2D. Thus,
in contrast to most other molecules that have been investigated to
date, it appears that NEDD9 may suppress focal adhesion
disassembly. Further, despite NEDD9 depletion causing increased
2D migration speed, this conversely decreased 3D migration
speed.
Our data suggesting that NEDD9 suppresses focal adhesion
disassembly is intriguing in light of reports that p130Cas
conversely stimulates adhesion turnover [15]. A key difference
between these two proteins is the presence of a poly-proline
domain in p130Cas C-terminus that is not found in NEDD9. Both
proteins contain a consensus Src SH2 binding site in their Ctermini, but in p130Cas this site together with the poly-proline
domain creates a bipartite binding site for the Src SH2 and SH3
domains respectively [33]. Through the bipartite Src binding
motif, p130Cas is thought to amplify Src kinase activity [34],
which is a major regulator of focal adhesion disassembly [35].
Additionally, the poly-proline domain of p130Cas has been
directly implicated in focal adhesion disassembly [6]. Therefore,
the absence of the poly-proline motif in NEDD9 may be one
explanation for the differences of these two highly similar proteins
on focal adhesion stability in MEFs. In the present study we show
that while there is no change in the total levels of Src or FAK
phosphorylation in the absence of NEDD9, phosphorylation of the
Src/FAK substrate paxillin is increased at focal adhesions,

suggesting small increases in localized Src or FAK activity
specifically at focal adhesion in these cells. However, reports that
Src and FAK activity are reduced in mouse mammary tumours
derived from a NEDD92/2 mouse [26] suggest that NEDD9
regulation of these kinases is complex and may depend on cell-type
and tumorigenic status.
Similar to our results for NEDD92/2 MEFs, NEDD9
depletion from MCF10a breast epithelial cells and granulocytes
also led to increased 2D cell migration [22,23]. The granulocyte
data is particularly interesting, given that lymphocytes isolated
from the same NEDD2/2 mice conversely display decreased 2D
cell migration [23], in keeping with studies in a variety of cancer
cell types showing that NEDD9 depletion inhibits migration in
scratch wound healing assays [24–27] and transwell migration
assays [28,29]. It was suggested that the differential effects of
NEDD9 knock-out on granulocyte versus lymphocyte populations
may be due to differing expression of the two discrete NEDD9
phospho-forms [23]. Related to this, we have recently established
that the NEDD9 phospho-forms have discrete functions in cell
spreading [36,37]. In the present study we demonstrate reduced
levels of 115 kDa NEDD9 in cells grown in 3D collagen gels
therefore reflecting differential control of NEDD9 phosphorylation
in 2D versus 3D conditions. Thus NEDD9 phospho-form
expression may play a role in determining the function of NEDD9
as a regulator of focal adhesion turnover. Alternatively, the
biphasic response between cell adhesion and migration in 2D [38]
means that the consequence of altered focal adhesion turnover
rates for final cell speed will depend on whether cells initially had
optimal adhesion for the fastest rate of migration. As focal
adhesion dynamics are ‘‘tuneable’’ the expression levels of an
adhesion stabilizer such as NEDD9 may therefore give different
speed readouts in a 2D environment.
In contrast to the results seen in 2D migration assays, we find
that NEDD9 depletion significantly reduced migration speeds of
MEFs in 3D collagen gels. The critical role of integrin-mediated
interaction with the ECM in 3D migration is indicated by studies
showing decreased b1 integrin receptor clustering accompanying
the switch to amoeboid migration [39]. In the present study we
show that cells with genetically depleted NEDD9 have reduced
cell adhesion force to fibronectin and the inside-out activation of
b1 integrin receptors. These data extend previous findings that
NEDD9 regulates Rac-mediated induction of mesenchymal
migration and invasion [9], by suggesting that NEDD9 may also
determine interaction with the ECM. Further, our data have
confirmed earlier reports that MLCK activity is increased
following NEDD9 depletion in 3D collagen gels, but in addition,
we now show that MLCK activity is conversely decreased under
2D culture conditions. Notably, the data reported here for
NEDD9 are highly similar to those previously reported for
vinculin. Vinculin has also been suggested to be a negative
regulator of adhesion turnover [19] and vinculin knockout
fibroblasts have increased 2D migration speed, but decreased 3D
migration and invasion [21]. It has previously been suggested that
vinculin activation leads to an open conformation with tight

affinity for talin, thus reducing focal adhesion turnover [20].
Subsequent connections to the actin cytoskeleton allow the
transmission of acto-myosin forces through the adhesion site
which results in integrin activation. There was little evidence of
activated b1 integrin co-localising with stress fibres in the
NEDD92/2 MEFs. Thus a picture is emerging to suggest that
molecules which regulate cell adhesion force to the ECM may
determine the traction force required for cells to negotiate the
surrounding 3D ECM. An important question this raises is
whether NEDD9, similar to the function of vinculin [40], impacts
the formation and contractility of actin stress fibres and/or,
whether NEDD9 mechanically couples contractile forces to the
focal adhesions.
The role that adhesion proteins such as NEDD9 play in the
regulation of cell migration in 3D contexts is still only poorly
understood. Our results suggest that NEDD9 may stabilize focal
adhesions and increase adhesion force to the extra-cellular matrix,
providing new insight into the function of NEDD9 in 3D cell
migration. NEDD9 expression is highly restricted [12] and the
protein half-life is short and tightly regulated [36]. As migrating
cells negotiate different environments in vivo the regulated
expression of molecules such as NEDD9 may facilitate the
necessary adhesive force required to traverse tissue barriers.

Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 15% Foetal
Bovine Serum (FBS) and supplemented with antibiotics (pen/
strep, Invitrogen). Immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFS)
were kindly supplied by Prof Erica Golemis (Fox Chase Cancer
Center, Philadelphia USA). Briefly, wild-type and NEDD9
knockout mouse embryos were generated in the Golemis lab
through cross-breeding of heterozygous and homozygous null
NEDD9 B57/BL6 mice [41]. Embryos were genotyped and wildtype and homozygous knockout MEFs were immortalized with the
large T antigen of the SV40 virus. All experiments involving mice
were preapproved by the Fox Chase Cancer Center Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 06-1, PI Golemis).
Growth of cells in 3D collagen gels, media for live imaging and
invasion assays through 3D collagen gels have been previously
described [42]. The following antibodies were used: anti-NEDD9
(ImmuQuest; clone 2G9 and Cell Signalling Technology; Clone
2G9), anti-FAK (Cell Signalling Technology), anti-phospho-FAK
Tyr397 (Life Technologies), anti-Src (Millipore, clone GD11),
anti- phosphor-Src Tyr418 (Life Technologies), anti-Myosin Light
Chain 2 (Cell Signalling Technology), anti-phospho-Myosin Light
Chain 2 Ser19 (Cell Signalling Technology), anti-p42/44 MAPK
(Cell Signalling Technology), anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK
Thr202/Tyr204 (Cell Signalling Technology), rat anti-mouse b1
integrin mAb to detect activated b1 integrin (BD bioscience; clone
9EG7), rat anti-mouse a5b1 integrin mAb (Millipore; clone
MAB2575), rat IgG isotype control (BD bioscience) and antifibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich); HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and
anti-rabbit (Amersham and Biorad) and anti-rat Alexa-Fluor 647
conjugate (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen).
Protein extraction, siRNA and immunoblotting
Conditions of protein extraction from 2D cultures and
immunoblotting were carried out as previously described [43].
To extract proteins from cells cultured in 3D collagen gels, gels
were first treated with Type I Collagenase (Life Technologies) for
30 min at 37uC and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at RT.
The cell pellet was washed with 16PBS then resuspended in lysis
buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged
for 12 min at 13000 rpm at 4uC and the supernatant retained for
analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology IL, USA) and protein
concentrations equalized prior to loading on gels. Control siRNA
and custom-designed NEDD9 siRNA (targeting the sequence
CCA GGA CAU UCG CAA CAA A) were both purchased from
Dharmacon. 10 nM siRNA was transiently transfected twice at
24 h intervals, using Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
Live cell imaging, migration and rounding analysis
Time-lapse images were captured using an ORCA ERG cooled
CCD camera (Hamamatsu, SDR Clinical Technology NSW,

Australia) and an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped
with an environmental chamber heated to 37uC. Transmitted light
images were captured at indicated time intervals (406 objective).
Cells undergoing division or apoptosis were excluded from
analyses. Nuclear translocation was tracked in time-lapse image
stacks using Metamorph V6.3 software (Molecular Devices).
Random migration analyses were performed on sparsely plated
cultures. To quantify cell migration behaviour, cell speeds and
directional persistence were determined from the Mean Squared
Displacement (MSD) of cells versus time as previously described
[40]. Only elongated cells were tracked in the analysis of
glioblastoma cell line 3D migration, to exclude apoptotic or
mitotic cell populations. Cell morphologies in fixed 3D collagen
gels were scored as either elongated (displaying extending
protrusions and an elongated cell body) or rounded (displaying a
rounded cell body and absence of protrusions). Cells were
counterstained with propidium iodide and apoptotic cells excluded
from morphological analyses.
Immunofluorescence and FACs analysis
Paxillin immunostaining of focal adhesions and focal adhesion
morphometry analysis was performed as previously described [44].
Cells in 3D collagen gels were fixed, quenched, permeabilised and
blocked overnight in 1% fatty-acid free BSA/1% donkey serum/
PBS. Gels were then incubated with primary antibodies in PBS/
1% donkey serum, washed, followed by addition of fluorescently
labelled secondary antibodies and TRITC-Phalloidin and after a
final wash cells were imaged under (Olympus FV1000 Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscope). FACs analysis of surface integrin

expression was achieved following trypsinization to detach cells.
Cells were immediately washed (0.5% BSA/0.1% NaN3/PBS),
incubated with primary antibodies, washed, incubated with
fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and after a final wash
stained cells were analysed using a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson). The isotype control corrected geometric mean
fluorescence of at least 3 separate experiments was compared.
Magnetic tweezers
1 mg of carboxylated superparamagnetic beads (Microparticles,
Berlin) with 560.21 mm diameter were coated with 50 mg/ml
human fibronectin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in 1 ml of
carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) for overnight or longer at 4uC. After
coating, the beads were washed and stored in PBS. 10,000 cells
were plated in 35 mm dishes for 24 hours, and fibronectin-coated
beads were then added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at
37uC and 5% CO2. Prior to measurements, the dishes were gently
washed with fresh medium to remove unbound beads and then
placed on a heated microscope stage. With a magnetic tweezer
device, a force that was linearly increasing from 0 to 40 nN over
10 seconds was then applied to the beads. The speed of the force
ramp was 4 nN/s. Bright-field images of the cell, the bead, and the
needle tip were taken by a CCD camera (ORCA ER Hamamatsu)
at a rate of 40 frames per second at 406 magnification. Bead
positions were tracked in real time using an intensity-weighted
centre-of-mass algorithm. The force value at which a bead
detached from the cell surface was recorded.
Focal adhesion dynamics
YFP-paxillin positive focal adhesions were imaged with an
Olympus IX81 inverted microscope, with a 606 (NA 1.35) oil
objective, using fluorescence filters of BP 460–495/BP510–550
(GFP) and BP 490–500/BP 515–560 (YFP). Images were captured
every 2 minutes for 90 minutes total, 250 ms exposure times.
Focal adhesions at the protruding edge of the membrane were
analysed by measuring the temporal changes in integrated pixel
intensity of an individual focal adhesion. Using MetaMorph
V6.1r0 (Molecular Devices, USA), a box was drawn close to the
focal adhesion to be analysed (in the cell cytoplasm) and the
background corrected by subtracting the average pixel intensity of
the boxed region from the entire image as previously described
[45]. A polygon was drawn around the focal adhesion at time of
maximum intensity and the average pixel intensity of the polygon
recorded for all time points. Intensity values (I) were expressed
relative to the minimum intensity value (Io) for calculating
adhesion assembly rates, or were expressed relative to the maximal
intensity value (Imax) for calculating adhesion disassembly rates.
Assembly and disassembly rate constants (k) were then calculated
from the slope of the lines generated by plotting the data as either
ln(I/Io) or ln(I/Imax), versus time. Fluorescence ratio imaging of
phosphorylated paxillin and semi-quantitative analysis of paxillin
phosphorylation at focal adhesions was performed as previously
described [4], with the addition of a masking step using
Metamorph software, whereby images were first subject to a
high-pass filter (sensitivity 1) to emphasize the peripheral cell
adhesions. The filtered images were then used as a mask for
background subtracted images to high-light the peripheral focal
adhesions. Note that the high level of phospho-paxillin antibody
reactivity in the nucleus means that the nuclear staining is not
filtered out and hence gives a strong signal in the final ratio
images.
Image preparation
Final micrograph images and grey level adjustments were
prepared in Adobe Photoshop.
