A B S T R A C T We have assessed the effectiveness of
transplanted histocompatible fibroblasts as a long-lived
source of lysosomal enzymes for replacement therapy
in three patients with Hunter's syndrome, over periods
ranging from 2.5 to 3.75 yr. The level of Hunter corrective factor excreted by all three patients increased after
transplantation, as did the activity of a-L-idurono-2-
sulfate sulfatase in serum, when measured directly
with a radioactive disulfated disaccharide substrate.
Sulfatase activity was also raised in leukocyte homogenates from the two patients that we were able to
assess. These increases in enzyme activity were accompanied by corresponding increases in catabolism of
heparan and dermatan sulfates, as shown by (a) a decrease in sulfate:uronic ratios of urinary oligosaccharides, (b) an increase in iduronic acid monosaccharide, and (c) a normalization of Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration profiles. Both the increase in enzyme activity and
increased catabolism were maintained during the
period of study and were not affected by either a
gradual decrease or total withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of recessively
inherited disorders of connective tissue metabolism,
each of which has a deficiency in one of the lysosomal
exoglycosidase or sulfatase enzymes necessary for comPreliminary results for patient N.G. have been published

plete catabolism of glycosaminoglycans. In Hunter's
syndrome, for example, there is an almost total absence
of a-L-idurono-2-sulfate sulfatase (idurono-sulfate
sulfatase), which is necessary for removal of sulfate
groups from iduronic acid at the nonreducing terminus
of heparan and dermatan sulfates. These deficiencies
result in an increasing accumulation of incompletely
degraded glycosaminoglycan, particularly in the
visceral organs, connective tissues, and the central
nervous system and in their excretion in large amounts
in urine. Mental and physical deterioration are progressive, often resulting in early death.
Short-term increases in the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans have been produced in a number of patients with different forms of mucopolysaccharidosis
(Hunter's, Hurler's, and the Sanfilippo syndromes)
when given infusions of normal plasma (2-5) or
leukocytes (6) as a means of enzyme replacement.
In contrast, Dekaban et al. (7) and Erickson et al. (8)
found that infusions of plasma or whole blood had little
effect on patients with Hunter's, Hurler's, and
Sanfilippo's syndromes, whereas Moser et al. (9)
showed that infusions of HLA-compatible leukocytes
in Sanfilippo B disease produced only a transient effect.
The changes in urinary glycosaminoglycans noted in
these patients were transient, presumably because
most lysosomal enzymes have relatively short halflives intracellularly (10-12). Studies on enzymes
present in aimniotic fluid (13), leukocyte homogenates
(14), anid serum (15), however, generally indicate a
higher degree of stability. We attempted to increase the
effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy and to extend its duration, first, with a graft of allogeneic skin
in a patient with Hunter's syndrome (16) and more reJ. Clin. Inivest. C) The Americani Society for Clinical Itnvestigationi, Inc., 0021-9738/79/0110138/09 $1.00

cently by the transplantation of histocompatible fibroblasts from a clinically normal sibling, whose fibroblasts had been shown to correct the abnormal sulfate
incorporation in the patient's own cells (1). In this
report we describe the long-term biochemical results of
transplanting allogeneic fibroblasts in three children
with Hunter's syndrome. Samples of urinary glycosaminoglycans and their oligosaccharides taken before
and after transplantation were compared quantitatively
and qualitatively for evidence of increased catabolism
after treatment. At the same time, urinary output of
Hunter "corrective factor," which contains iduronosulfate sulfatase, was monitored (17) and the levels of
idurono-sulfate sulfatase measured directly in serum
and leukocytes of patients and untreated cases of
Hunter's syndrome, with radioactive disulfated disaccharide as substrate (15).
METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Cell culture media were purchased from Flow Laboratories
Ltd., Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland and [35S]sulfate from The
Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
England. Bio-Gel and Cellex-E were supplied by Bio-Rad
Laboratories Ltd., Bromley, Kent, England, Dowex resin and
pig mucosal heparin by Sigma Chemical Co., Kingston, Surrey, England, and 5-aminoacridine hydrochloride by KochLight Ltd., Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, England. All other
chemicals were obtained from British Drug Houses Ltd.,
Poole, Dorset, England and were of analytical reagent grade.
Clinical summaries
In all three patients the clinical diagnosis of Hunter's
syndrome (18) was confirmed by the demonstration that their
cultured fibroblasts could not correct known reference Hunter
fibroblasts' and that they had a severe deficiency of Hunter
corrective factor in their urine. Before grafting, the ability of
the donor fibroblasts to correct abnormal 35SO4 incorporation
in the recipient's cells was confirmed by the method of Cantz
et al. (17). All three patients were HLA identical with the
sibling donor, against whom no mixed leukocyte reaction was
detected. Approval for the transplants was obtained from
Guy's Hospital and Medical School Committee on ethical
practice. Individual details of the three patients were as
follows:
N.G. This boy was 9 yr and 2 mo old at the time ofhis transplant in July 1974. Developmental retardation was detected
at 18 mo. His IQ was estimated to be at an 18-24-mo level at
the time of grafting. The patient and his sister, who was the
donor, were both HLA 2,3;12,W5.
S.T. This boy was 4 yr and 8 mo old at the time of fibroblast grafting in March 1975. Developmental delay was noted
at 1 yr. No firm estimate of his IQ could be made but he was
thought to function at the level of an 18-mo-old child. The
patient and his brother, who was the donor, were both HLA
3,9; 12,5.
1 We are grateful to Dr. H. Kresse of the University of
Munster for confirming these points. His present address is
Medisinisch-Chemisches Institut und Pregl Laboratorium der
Universitat Graz, Austria.
J.A. This boy was 5 yr and 3 mo old at the time of his transplant in December 1975. He was thought to be developing
normally until about the age of2 yr, when he was investigated
for possible deafness and noted to have features suggestive of
mucopolysaccharidosis. His IQ before grafting was estimated
to be between 48 and 68. The patient and his sister, who was
the donor, were both HLA 1,2;8,13.
All three patients studied were on an immunosuppressive
regimen of 25 mg Imuran (Burroughs Wellcome & Co., Greenville, N. C.) and 30 mg prednisolone daily for at least 1 mo
before fibroblast transplant. This program was continued for
12 mo in the first patient (N.G.) at which time he developed
congestive cardiac failure and left lower lobe pneumonia,
after which immunosuppressive therapy was stopped. Urine
samples obtained after this time showed evidence of continued graft function and there was no evidence of clinical
deterioration. The other two patients were given immunosuppressives for periods of 6 and 5 mo only after grafting, to minimize the possibility of complications.
Clinical observations
Patients were assessed before and 6 wk after transplant
and at three monthly intervals thereafter. In addition to
clinical examination, which included photographic recording
ofjoint mobility, the following investigations were made; liver
and spleen scans, radiological skeletal survey, and intellectual
and developmental assessments.
Cell culture
Cultures of fibroblasts from donors and recipients were
established by conventional methods with 0.2 x 0.3-cm
skin biopsies taken from the volar surface of the arm. These
were cultured in triplicate in glutamine-free RPMI 1640
medium (19) (Flow Laboratories Ltd.) supplemented with 4
mM L-glutamine that contained 50 mg of cloxacillin, 20
mg of gentamycin, and 200 ml of fetal calf serum per liter, in
Falcon tissue culture flasks (No. 3024, Falcon Plastics; Division of BioQuest, Oxnard, Calif.) in a humidified incubator
that contained an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. When the
primary cultures were confluent, the cells were removed by
trypsinization with 0.25% (wt/vol) trypsin (Wellcome Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, England) in serum-free Hanks'
balanced salt solution and subcultured at a split ratio of 5:1.
One further subculture at a split ratio of 6: 1 was required to obtain sufficient cells for transplantation. Before transplantation,
cells were again trypsinized for 20 min at 37°C in Hanks'
balanced salt solution and washed three times in proteinfree Hanks' balanced salt solution before resuspending them
in 10 ml of the same solution for injection. Approximately
2 x 108 viable cells were injected as a cell suspension into
four subcutaneous dorsal sites.
Isolation of urinary glycosaminoglycans and
oligosaccharides
Urine collections (24 h) were stored at -20°C with 10 ml of
toluene as a preservative. Glycosaminoglycans were precipitated from 100- to 200-ml aliquots of each urine specimen
with 5-aminoacridine HCI (20) converted to their sodium salts
by shaking with a suspension of Dowex 50 (Na+ form) reprecipitated in 80% (vol/vol) ethanol, removed by centrifugation, and dried (21). Inorganic sulfate and phosphate were re~-
moved from 20-ml aliquots of the remaining supematant solutions by drop-wise addition of 25% (wt/vol) aqueous BaCl2
until precipitation ceased. Samples were clarified by cenFibroblast Transplantation in Hunter's Syndrome 139

trifugation and the process repeated. Excess 5-aminoacridine
and other cations were removed from the low molecular
weight oligosaccharides by passing the supernatant solutions
through a column (18 x 150 mm) of Dowex 50 H+ (Dow
Chemical Co., Midland, Mich.) and eluting with 300 ml of
water. The pH of the eluates was adjusted to 6.5-7.0 with 2 M
NaOH, the samples freeze-dried, redissolved in 10 ml of
water, and stored at -20°C.
Analytical procedures
Columns (13 x 600 mm) of Bio-Gel P-2, 200-400 mesh,
were packed in and eluted with 0.2 M sodium acetate, pH
6.8. Samples that contained 1 mg of uronic acid were applied to the columns, and the uronic acid contents determined
in each 1.0-ml fraction by the carbazole method, with an
automated procedure (22). Sulfate contents were determined
by the modified rhodizonate method after hydrolysis ofpooled
fractions in 6 M formic acid for 24 h at 100°C (23,24). Iduronic
acid was measured by gas-liquid chromatography after
methanolysis in 2 M anhydrous methanolic HCI, neutralization, and conversion into a trimethylsilyl derivative (25).
Hexosamine was determined by the method of Tsiganos and
Muir (26).
Assay of Hunter corrective factor
Hunter corrective factor was concentrated from urine and
its activity determined by previously described methods
(1, 15). Urines were frozen immediately after collection and
assayed, usually within a few days. Urines stored for up to 6
mo showed no change in corrective factor activity, in agreement with the observations by Cantz et al. (27) on Hurler corrective factor. The response to corrective factor of patients'
cells before and after treatment varied little over a period of 2 yr.
Measurement of a-L-idurono-2-sulfate
sulfatase
After this investigation was begun it became possible to
measure idurono-sulfate sulfatase directly (15) and a limited
number of results are therefore presented here. Leukocytes,
collected by centrifugation from heparinized blood after lysis
of erythrocytes with hypotonic shock, were resuspended in
1 ml of0. 15 M NaCl and then subjected to six cycles of freezethawing, and then debris was removed by centrifugation. Sera
and leukocyte homogenates were each dialyzed for 48 h
against 8 liters of 0.15 M NaCl, stored frozen, and not thawed
until assay. The substrate was 3H-labeled O-(a-L-idopyranosyluronic acid 2-sulfate) (1 -- 4)-2,5-anhydro-D-[1-3H]mannitol 6-sulfate, prepared from heparin by deaminative
cleavage, and subsequent reduction with sodium borotritide
(28). Duplicate 30-p.l samples of serum or leukocyte homogenate were incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 30 ul of substrate (4
mM in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 57 mCi/mM sp act).
Incubation mixtures were then diluted with 1.5 ml of water
and added to a column (1.5 ml vol) of epichlorohydrin
triethanolamine cellulose in the formate form. The tubes
were rinsed with an additional 1.0 ml of water, which was
added to the epichlorohydrin triethanolamine column and
the radioactive reaction products separated from residual substrate, which remained bound to the column, by elution with
2 x 5-ml aliquots of 0.16 M sodium formate. Fractions were
collected into scintillation vials that contained 10 ml of Lumagel (Lumac Systems Ac, Basel, Switzerland) and counted in a
liquid scintillation spectrometer (Searle Ltd., High Wycombe,
Buckinghamshire, England). Appropriate blanks of 30-,ul substrate and 30-j,l samples were incubated separately for 4 h,
diluted with water, mixed, and then applied immediately to
the column. Enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles of
substrate hydrolyzed per milligram protein per 24 h.
RESULTS
Changes in amount and composition of excreted
glycosaminoglycans. There was an increase in total
uronic acid output shown by all three patients within
48 h of transplantation. Excretion remained above pretransplantation levels for about 1 wk then fell to preimplantation levels. Output thereafter rose and fell in a
cyclical manner throughout the period of observations,
with elevated values recorded more than 20 mo after
treatment in patient N.G.
Output of precipitated glycosaminoglycans was considerably greater than in normal controls before treatment so that the ratio (based on uronic acid) of oligosaccharides to precipitated glycosaminoglycans in Hunter
urine varied between 3.0:1 and 6.5:1 in contrast to a
normal mean of27:1. After transplantation, mean uronic
acid output increased by 72% in patient N.G. and by
19% in J.A., but in S.T. there was a decrease (Table I).
There was an increase in output of both oligosaccharides and precipitated glycosaminoglycans so that
the overall ratio of oligosaccharides to precipitated
glycosaminoglycans remained relatively constant.
However, in one case (S.T.) the uronic acid content of
later posttransplantation samples decreased to below
pretreatment levels, this decrease being particularly
marked in glycosaminoglycans precipitated with 5-
aminoacridine.
Galactosamine accounted for 60-70% of the total
hexosamine present in precipitated glycosaminoglycans (Table II), these values being slightly higher than
those recorded for pooled samples of normal urine (29).
The galactosamine content of this fraction decreased
after transplantation in patients S.T. and J.A. Glucosamine was the principal amino sugar in the low molecuTABLE I

in urine from age matched normal children. In patients
N.G. and S.T. the glucosamine content of this fraction
fell to a level close to, or below that of normal controls
after treatment.
The oligosaccharides that were eluted from Dowex50 were separated into four fractions of different hydrodynamic size (Fig. 1) by gel chromatography. Although
broadly similar to the elution profiles seen when
oligosaccharides previously eluted from Dowex-1 in

on Bio-Gel P-2 (1) there were, however, several differences. Fraction V was not present in any significant
amount in the oligosaccharides eluted with water from
Dowex-50, nor was fraction II. The four fractions resolved were numbered in order of decreasing hydrodynamic size and do not correspond to those previously
separated-from acid eluates. In normal urine, the largest
component (fraction I) was of smaller size than a
reference tetrasaccharide produced by the action of
testicular hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35) on chondroitin

were eluted at positions equivalent to the mono- and
disulfated-unsaturated disaccharides produced by the
action of chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) and
chondro-4-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.9) on chondroitin
sulfate.
Urine from untreated patients contained a higher proportion of the larger oligosaccharides than normal
urines and much less monosaccharide fraction. After
transplantation the elution profiles gradually changed,
so that the relative proportions of lower molecular
weight oligosaccharides increased and larger molecular weight ones decreased, until about 1 yr after transplantation when elution profiles in the case of all three
patients resembled those of age matched controls.
Pooled samples offraction I (Fig. 1) from each patient
and from normal controls were rechromatographed on
Bio-Gel P-2, recollected, and their sulfate to uronip acid
ratios determined. In normal urine this ratio was 1.02:1,
in contrast to much higher ratios, ranging from 1.6 to
2.14:1, in samples taken from all three patients before
transplantation (Table III). After treatment, the sulfate:
uronic acid ratios decreased to approach normal values
within 4 wk, this lower level being maintained throughout the period of observation.
Before treatment the iduronic acid content of the
monosaccharide (fraction IV) was below that of control
urines. After transplantation the proportion of iduronic
acid in this fraction rose to normal values and there was
a concomitant decrease in the iduronic acid content of
the larger oligosaccharides (fractions I-III) (Table IV).
Changes in corrective factor and iduronate sulfatase
levels. Protein concentrates from urine samples taken

samples were virtually devoid of corrective-factor

After transplantation, fluctuating, but consistently
higher levels of corrective factor activity were observed
in the urines of all three patients. Mean output of corrective factor activity before and after fibroblast transplantation compared with normal age matched controls
is shown in Table V. Mean activities increased from
=1% of control levels to about 10% of control levels
after treatment. Direct measurement of idurono-sulfate
sulfatase activity in sera of all patients taken between
1.5 and 3 yr after transplantation gave a mean activity
almost four times that obtained from untreated control
Hunter patients (Table VI). Leukocyte homogenates
from patients N.G. and J.A. also showed significant increases in activity compared with that of homogenates
from untreated Hunter patients.
Clinical changes. For ethical reasons the three patients selected for this experimental treatment were all
grossly affected by the disease both physically and
mentally. The three patients were observed for periods
ranging from 2 yr and 6 mo to 3 yr and 9 mo as described
in Methods. None of the patients showed consistent
changes in joint mobility or liver and spleen size as revealed by serial scans. However, during this period
there was no evidence of any further mental and physical deterioration. The patient followed for the longest
period of time (N.G.) who was assessed as having a
mental age of 1 yr 10 mo before transplant was reassessed as having a mental age in excess of 2 yr, 3.9
yr later, in contrast to the expected deterioration.

plantation (Fig. 2, Table V). The high level of corrective factor in the urine immediately after transplantation may have been caused by enzyme released from
cells that were damaged during the transplantation procedure.
Direct measurement of idurono-sulfate sulfatase
activity in the sera of all three patients and in leukocyte homogenates of two patients (N.G. and J.A.)
several years after treatment suggested that the transplanted fibroblasts had survived and had continued to
function and release enzyme.
Many of the changes in size and composition of the
urinary glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides that
were seen after transplantation were consistent with
those that would be expected from increased catabolism of these compounds. The relative proportions of
oligosaccharides separated by gel chromatography
began to resemble those of normal urine, and the initial
increase in output of uronic acid was mainly in the form
of oligosaccharides of low molecular weight. The
hexosamine composition of either glycosaminoglycans
or oligosaccharides showed no consistent change, however. Glucosamine was the major constituent of
oligosaccharides, which were presumably derived from
heparan sulfate, whereas galactosamine was the major
constituent of precipitated glycosaminoglycans, which
were presumably derived principally from dermatan
sulfate.
Among the more specific changes noted in all three
patients was a marked fall in the molar ratio of sulfate:
uronic acid of fraction I (Fig. 1), which was consistent
with the removal of sulfate from the terminal nonreducing iduronic acid of partially degraded dermatan and
heparan sulfates by idurono-sulfate sulfatase (32-34).
The action of idurono-sulfate sulfatase would then
enable free iduronic acid to be released. This was indeed found with patient N.G., where the iduronic acid
content of the monosaccharide fraction increased,
while the proportion of iduronic acid in the oligosaccharide fractions decreased.
It is notable that neither the increase in enzyme
activity nor the changes in urinary glycosaminoglyeans
and oligosaccharides were affected by the gradual withdrawal or total cessation of immunosuppressive drugs.
It is known that normal skin fibroblasts can correct
abnormal sulfate metabolism of fibroblasts from patients with mucopolysaccharidosis when they are
grown together (35) and that this is because of the release of lysosomal enzymes and their active uptake by
deficient cells (11, 36, 37). Furthermore, in in vitro
studies with cells from patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (Sanfilippo B disease) it has been shown
that 2-5% of normal intracellular levels of enzyme
would induce 42-70% correction of their abnormal
glycosaminoglycan metabolism (10). A relationship between amount of enzyme uptake and degree of correction has also been demonstrated in cells from patients
with,8-glucuronidase deficiency (38, 39) and Hunter's
syndrome (40), whereas adsorptive endocytosis of a
wide range of lysosomal hydrolases by fibroblasts has
been shown in vitro (37,41,42). It is therefore possible
that a relatively small number of transplanted normal
fibroblasts might release idurono-sulfate sulfatase,
which would be taken up by the patients' cells and
bring about some catabolism of glycosaminoglycans in
vivo. Although there is no direct evidence for this, it is
compatible with the biochemical data. Exchange of
lysosomal enzymes has been shown to occur in vivo
with a-mannosidase and,81-glucuronidase (43, 44). The
possibility that some breakdown of glycosaminoglycans may occur in the urine cannot be entirely excluded, but this does not explain the increased excretion of polymeric glycosaminoglyeans after transplant
in patients N.G. and J.A. Moreover, the concentration of
phosphate in urine (_10 mM) was sufficient to inhibit
idurono-sulfate sulfatase activity by more than 99% in
our assay system.
Preliminary results showed that leukocytes oftwo patients possessed significantly more idurono-sulfate
sulfatase than cells from untreated patients with
Hunter's syndrome. The three patients were all severely mentally and physically affected before treatment. Lack of further deterioration after the transplant
suggests that such treatment of patients before the
disease has progressed this far may arrest or prevent
further progress of the disease, particularly if a larger
number of cells were transplanted. These results do not
necessarily imply that other types of lysosomal storage
diseases would respond to cell transplants, however.
