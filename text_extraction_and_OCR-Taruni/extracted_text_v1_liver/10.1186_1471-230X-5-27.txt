Abstract
Background: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been reported to show considerable geographical
variation in frequency and clinical manifestations. It is considered a rare cause of liver disease in
India. The present study was undertaken to determine the incidence, clinical, biochemical and
histological profile of AIH in this part of the world.
Methods: Patients presenting with acute or chronic liver disease between January 1999 and June
2002 were evaluated prospectively. AIH was diagnosed using the international autoimmune
hepatitis group criteria. Workup included clinical, biochemical, USG, viral markers, UGI endoscopy,
AI markers (ANA, SMA, Anti-LKM, AMA, RF, p-ANCA) using indirect immunofluorescence and
liver biopsy if possible.
Results: Forty-one of 2401 (1.70%) patients were diagnosed to have autoimmune liver disease.
Out of these, 38 had autoimmune hepatitis and the rest 3 had primary biliary cirrhosis. The mean
age of the patients of autoimmune hepatitis was 36.2 (15.9) years, 34 (89.4%) were females, and the
duration of symptoms was 20.3 (20.5) months. Nineteen (50%) of them presented with chronic
hepatitis, 13 (34.2%) as cirrhosis, 5 (13.1%) with acute hepatitis and 1 (2.6%) with cholestatic
hepatitis. The presentations were jaundice in 21 (55.2%), pedal edema and hepatomegaly in 17
(44.7%), splenomegaly in 13 (34.2%), encephalopathy, abdominal pain in 9 (23.6%) and fever in 8
(21%). Twelve had esophageal varices and 3 had bled. Biochemical parameters were ALT 187 (360)
U/L, AST 157 (193) U/L, ALP 246 (254) U/L, globulin 4.1 (1.6) g/dL, albumin 2.8 (0.9) g/dL, bilirubin
5.2 (7.4) mg/dL, prothrombin time 17 (7) sec and ESR 47 (17) sec. The autoimmune markers were
SMA (24), ANA (15), both SMA and ANA (4), AMA (1), rheumatoid factor (2), pANCA (1), and
Anti-LKM in none. Thirty (79%) patients had definite AIH and eight (21%) had probable AI hepatitis.
Associated autoimmune diseases was seen in 15/38 (39.4%), diabetes 4, hypothyroidism 3, vitiligo
2, thrombocytopenia 2, rheumatoid arthritis 2, Sjogren's syndrome 1 and autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome III in 1. Viral markers were positive in two patients, one presenting as acute
hepatitis and HEV-IgM positive and another anti-HCV positive.
Conclusion: In India, autoimmune hepatitis is uncommon and usually presents with chronic
hepatitis or cirrhosis, acute hepatitis being less common. Age at presentation was earlier but clinical
parameters and associated autoimmune diseases were similar to that reported from the west.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is rare. Type II AIH was not observed.

Background
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by chronic hepatocellular inflammation, serum autoantibodies, and
hypergammaglobulinemia, which in most cases respond
to immunosupression [1-3]. Those affected are mainly
young women. The course is generally progressive and
often fluctuating and cirrhosis is often present when the
disease is discovered.
The diagnosis of AIH is established by the revised scoring
system devised by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group and the international association for the study
of liver [4,5]. The overall sensitivity of the score to establish a diagnosis of definite or probable AIH was 89.8%,
however, the specificity for discriminating AIH from overlapping syndrome such as PSC or PBC was low [6].
Histological studies show periportal hepatitis with lymphocytic infiltrates, plasma cells, and piecemeal necrosis.
Lobular hepatitis can be present. Presence of granulomas
and iron deposition argues against AIH [7,8].
Autoimmune hepatitis affects 100,000–200,000 individuals in United States [9]. In India the prevalence is less [10-
13]. Some early reports have questioned the existence of
autoimmune liver disease. The prevalence, nature and
prognosis of autoimmune hepatitis remain unclear.
In this report, we have studied the frequency, clinical, biochemical and immunoserologic profile of autoimmune
liver disease. We also have compared the acute and
chronic presentation of autoimmune liver disease.
Methods
Study population
Consecutive patients with chronic or acute liver disease
seen at a tertiary care center Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate
Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India from January 1999 to June 2002 were evaluated for etiology.
Clinical assessment
In all patients, a detailed history was taken and clinical
examination was carried out. History of onset of illness,
acute or precipitating events, blood transfusion, surgery,
menstrual abnormalities, and presence of extra-hepatic
manifestations of autoimmune diseases were specifically
noted. Family history of autoimmune diseases was also
noted.
Laboratory tests and virological assessment
All patients underwent biochemical evaluation using
standard automated techniques. Liver function tests and
serum proteins and serum globulins were done in all
patients. HBsAg, HBeAg, Anti-HBe were measured by
immunoenzymatic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, Hepanostika, Organon Technika, Boxtel). AntiHCV was done using a commercially available qualitative
ELISA against peptides corresponding to highly antigenic
segments of core, NS3, NS4, NS5 regions of hepatitis C
(UBI HCV EIA 4.0, Beijing United Biomedical Co., Ltd.,
China). Patients who were anti-HCV positive were further
tested for HCV-RNA using a RT-PCR technique. IgM-anti
HEV immunoenzymatic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, Hepanostika, Organon Technika, Boxtel)
were also done in patients presenting with acute hepatitis.
Immunoserologic assessment
Serological tests for autoantibodies antinuclear antibody
(ANA), anti smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver/
kidney microsomal antibodies (anti-LKM-1) were done
using the standard immunofluorescence technique.
Briefly, cryostat sections of rat liver, kidney and stomach
composite block were incubated with test sera (diluted
1:10) at 37°C for 30 min. After washing thrice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min each, the sections
were incubated with fluoroscein isothiocyanate-conjugate
rabbit anti-human polyclonal immunoglobulin (Dako,
Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1:40 in PBS at 37°C for
30 min. The sections were washed thrice with PBS,
mounted and examined under a fluorescent microscope.
Titers of ANA, ASMA, and anti-LKM-1 of 1:80 or more is
taken as positive in adults.
Histological assessment
Percutaneous liver biopsy was done wherever possible. An
experienced histopathologist examined all the liver
biopsy and specifically looked for lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrate, piecemeal or bridging necrosis, rosette formation, bile duct injury, siderosis, copper deposits and granulomas. Fibrosis was graded as periportal, bridging or
complete regenerative nodules (cirrhosis).
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for evaluation of varices
and portal hypertensive gastropathy was done using a videoendoscope in all patients (Pentax gastroscope, EG
2940, Japan). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
was performed in patients with alkaline phosphate was
elevated more than three fold of upper limit of normal
with a clinical suspicion of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Real time ultrasound of upper abdomen was done in all
patients to look for evidence of portal hypertension, collaterals, and ascites and to rule out any obstructive biliary
pathology. Appropriate tests to exclude Wilson's disease
and hemochromatosis were done wherever indicated.
Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was based on the criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group
criteria (Table 1).[5] Diagnosis of Overlap syndrome was
made if the patient had clinical, serological and

histological characteristics of two conditions either at the
same time or during the course of their illness. None of
the patients of AIH had history of significant alcohol consumption, blood transfusion in the preceding 3 years,
homosexual contact or intravenous drug abuse.
Treatment
The indications for treatment were a greater than 2-fold
elevation of aminotransferases in conjunction with interface hepatitis on liver biopsy. However in those in whom
liver biopsy could not be done, elevation in liver enzymes
alone was taken as indication for treatment. Response to
treatment was defined as either or both of the following:
marked improvement of symptoms and return of serum
AST or ALT, bilirubin and immunoglobulin values completely to normal within 1 year and sustained for at least
a further 6 months on maintenance therapy, or a liver
biopsy showing at most minimal activity.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean (S.D.) and range. SPSS 10.0
was used for statistical analysis. Data in the two groups
(acute and chronic presentations) was compared using
Mann-Whitney U test. P-value <0.05 was taken as
significant.
Results
Of 2401 patients of liver disease who presented to the
Gastroenterology department of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, from January
1999 to June 2002, 41 (1.70%) patients fulfilled the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group criteria [1]. Of
these thirty-eight patients (1.5%) were confirmed to have
autoimmune hepatitis and the other 3 had primary biliary
cirrhosis based on liver biopsy findings. Thirty patients
had definite (pretreatment score > 15) and eight had
probable autoimmune hepatitis (pretreatment score 10–
15) prior to treatment. But after initiation and continuation of treatment, 3 more attained scores of 17 and so
were added to the definite autoimmune hepatitis group
from the probable group. Among patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 35 (92.1%) were of type 1, none of type 2
and the rest 3 could not be classified as they lacked the
SMA and ANA. The other etiologies of liver disease were
hepatitis B in 30 %, hepatitis C in 20 %, alcohol in 25 %,
cryptogenic in 15 % and others including autoimmune
liver disease in 10 %.
Mean age of patients was 36.3 (2.6); range 7–68 years.
Seven patients were less than 20 years and only five above
60 years of age. The age distribution at presentation
showed a peak at 30 years (figure 1). There were 34
(89.4%) females; mean age of females [36.1 (16.7) range
7–68 years] was comparable with that of males [36.7
(13.8); range 11–51 years]. Mean duration of symptoms

prior to presentation was 20.3 (3.9); range 0.2–72
months. Fifteen patients had duration of symptoms less
than 6 months whereas 23 patients had chronic symptoms with duration of more than 6 months.
Clinical findings
Nineteen (50%) patients presented with chronic hepatitis,
thirteen (34.2%) with cirrhosis, five (13.1%) with acute
hepatitis and one (2.6%) with cholestatic hepatitis. Jaundice, edema and fatigue were the most common clinical
presentations. Jaundice was usually mild only. Physical
findings showed ascites in more than one-third of
patients. Table 2 shows the clinical parameters.
Laboratory parameters
Mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 187 (360) U/L
and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 157 (193) U/L.
Nine (22%) patients had AST and 11 (26.8%) had ALT
above five times the upper limit of normal. The mean
bilirubin was 5.2 mg/dl and nine patients (23.6%) had
bilirubin above 5 mg/dL. See table 3 for the laboratory
parameters.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
Esophageal varices were present in twelve (31.5%)
patients of whom three had presented with bleed. Portal
hypertensive gastropathy was present in three patients
and gastric varices in two patients.
Histological features
Liver biopsy was possible in only 19 (50%) patients, as 9
patients had coagulopathy, 6 had ascites and 4 had both
ascites and coagulopathy, which contraindicated percutaneous liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis was present in 15
and cirrhosis in 4. Interface hepatitis was present in
72.7%, rosette formation in 18.2% and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in 63.6%. Bile duct injury was observed in
three patients.
Virological markers
In the one patient tested positive for anti-HCV, the serum
also tested positive for HCV-RNA by PCR. One other
patient presented as acute hepatitis and tested positive for
IgM-HEV. Patient improved clinically but continues to be
SMA positive and has elevated transaminases. Acute hepatitis E led to the recognition of the underlying asymptomatic chronic autoimmune hepatitis. One patient had
HIV ELISA positive and had chronic diarrhoea with partial
villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy.
Immunoserologic features
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was positive in 15 patients,
of these 7 had speckled pattern (numerous evenly distributed specks of fluorescence, whereas remaining 8 had
homogenous or diffuse pattern (uniform staining of
nucleus). Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) were
positive in 24 patients and out of these both ANA and
SMA were positive in 4 patients. One of these patients had
in addition AMA positivity and a high alkaline
phophatase. But her liver biopsy did not reveal changes of
PBC but showed features of autoimmune hepatitis (interface hepatitis and rosettes) and so she was classified under
overlap syndrome (AIH-PBC). She had a score of 13, so
falling under probable AIH. In 3 patients, no diagnostic
antibodies were found and they were diagnosed on basis
of other criteria including liver biopsy and response to

immunosuppressive treatment. None of the patients had
anti-liver/kidney microsomal (anti-LKM) antibodies.
Associated autoimmune diseases
Fifteen (39.4%) patients had associated autoimmune disease (Table 5). Diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis
and vitiligo were the most common extra hepatic autoimmune features.
Treatment outcomes
Thirty patients were started on treatment with corticosteroids (prednisolone) to which azathioprine was added in
thirteen. In the remaining 8 patients, treatement with steroids was not started in 6 because of normal aminotransferases, presence of decompensated liver disease and liver
biopsy (if done) not showing interface hepatitis and in
another 2 because of being lost to follow up. Of the thirty
patients started on steroids, 6 patients were lost to follow
up and of the remaining 24, clinical and biochemical
response was noticed in 17 (70.8 %). The patient with
Overlap syndrome was treated with steroids but she did
not achieve normalization of enzymes. Ursodeoxycholic
acid was started in 5 patients in whom steroids either was
not started or not tolerated, but only one patient achieved
response. One patient on azathioprine had severe adverse
effects in the form of pancytopenia and fever, requiring
discontinuation of therapy. One patient had pulmonary
tuberculosis in addition. He was on antitubercular drugs
(isoniazid, rifampicin), on which he developed acute liver
failure with hepatic encephalopathy and died due to
increased intracranial tension. This patient was SMA
positive. There were no other deaths in the study. One
patient with decompensated cirrhosis who did not
improve with immunosuppressant therapy underwent a
liver transplant successfully and was doing well at 6
months follow-up.
Comparison of acute and chronic presentations did not
show any significant difference between clinical, laboratory and immunoserologic parameters (Table 6). Histological parameters and treatment outcome also did not
show any significant difference between these two groups.
Discussion
The overall prevalence of autoimmune liver disease in our
study was 1.70% and of autoimmune hepatitis, 1.50%.
This contrasts with data from Western studies where the
estimated prevalence is 11–20% of all cases of chronic
liver disease [3,17]. This difference with the Western data
has also been seen in other Indian studies, which have
reported a low prevalence of 3.5–6.1% of all cases of
chronic liver disease [10,13]. The low prevalence in our
population may be attributed to possible genetic or geographic variation. Studies looking at genetic predisposing
factors have been largely directed at genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which include those encoding
HLA located in the MHC, immunoglobulins and T-cell
receptor molecules. Geographic variations in these factors
are seen, with type 1 AIH in Caucasians being associated
with HLA-DR3 serotype while in Japan where HLA-DR3 is
rare, the primary association is with HLA-DR4. Similar
differences in these as well as other multiple genes might
account for some of this low frequency of AIH seen in
India and has to be studied.
Majority of the patients were in the third and fourth decades with a mean age of 36.3 (12.6) years and there was a
female preponderance (F: M 4:1) seen. Although it has
long been appreciated that AIH more affects girls and

young and middle-aged women, it has been recognized
that the disease is not uncommon in the elderly. In a series
of patients with type 1 AIH in northern European Caucasians, elderly patients were not uncommon and the mean
age of patients from a study from Japan was 50.8 (12.7)
years [1,14]. In the present study only 5 patients (13.1%)
were above 60 years of age and this observation of onset
at a younger age in Indian patients has been seen in other
Indian studies in which the reported mean ages have been
31.0 (17.1) and 39.8 (13) years with a female predominance [10,13]. The mean duration of symptoms at
diagnosis in our study was 20.3, which was longer than
that reported form other countries as well as from India
[10].
Most of our patients had advanced liver disease at presentation. Cirrhosis was present in 34.2% of patients and
chronic hepatitis in 50% patients. The onset of
autoimmune hepatitis is usually insidious, as described in
western studies with fatigue, fluctuating jaundice and
arthralgia as typical features, but a substantial proportion
of patients have no obvious signs or symptoms of liver
disease or have an acute presentation as seen in 25 % [18].
In our study presentation as acute hepatitis accounted for
only 13.1 % of all presentations. In patients with
advanced disease liver biopsy was not possible in most
cases due to complications like coagulopathy and ascites.
The relative higher prevalence of chronic hepatitis may be
misleading, as the true prevalence of cirrhosis could be
higher and might be picked up only on liver biopsy.
In general, the elevations of aminotransferases are more
striking than those of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
In some cases of AIH, however, a cholestatic picture is
present, marked by high levels of conjugated bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase. In our study, mean bilirubin
concentration was only 5.2 mg% and only 9 patients had
bilirubin above 5 mg %. One patient presented with high
levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase with ANA,
SMA and AMA positvity. Her liver biopsy was typical of
AIH and so she was classified under cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis.
Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis was present in 92.1%
patients and type 2 was not seen. Other Indian reports
also show higher prevalence of type 1 AIH, 88.9% from
Mumbai and 80% from Delhi [13,10]. It has been
described that about 70 to 80 % patients of AIH present
with significant titers of ANA or SMA (or both) and about
3 to 4 % have anti-LKM-1 antibodies, while up to 20 %
have none of these antibodies [4]. In our study as previously described 92.1 % had SMA or ANA (or both) and in
the rest no antibody could be identified. Diagnoses in
these latter group of patients were made on basis of other
criteria such as marked hypergammaglobulinemia, typical
histological findings, immunogenetic background, family
history of autoimmune diseases, appropriate investigations to exclude other possible causes of liver disease and
response to immunosuppressive treatment. There is currently no agreement on what constitutes an autoimmune
overlap syndrome. Two distinct types of overlap
syndrome can be considered [20]. The crossover syndrome in which an individual may fit one diagnosis while

having some features associated with another and the true
overlap in which the patient has clinical, serologic and
histologic characteristics of two conditions either at the
same time or during the course of their illness. Only one
patient in this study had the true overlap syndrome of
AIH-PBC as she had cholestatic hepatitis with positivity of
ANA as well as AMA, and liver biopsy features of AIH. In
the other Indian study by Gupta et al also, a low frequency
of overlap syndrome was seen in two patients [10].
Concurrent immunological diseases are reported in 17 to
48% of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, synovitis
and ulcerative colitis being most common [1-3,16]. We
found it in 39.4%, with diabetes, thyroiditis and vitiligo
being the most common. One patient had autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome. Anti-HCV was positive in only
one patient (2.8%) in whom the HCV-RNA was negative
by PCR. A study from Japan, where hepatitis C has high
prevalence, reported anti-HCV positivity in 12.5% of
patients of autoimmune hepatitis [14]. Approximately 5
% of patients with chronic hepatitis C have ANA or SMA
titers of 100 or higher and so in those patients where antiHCV is positive, HCV-RNA has to be done also to rule out
hepatitis C virus infection as the cause of the autoimmune
phenomena [19].
Steroid monotherapy or combination therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine are the standard initial treatment of AIH. Combination therapy is best suited for
elderly, osteoporotic patients, those with diabetes, hypertension, obesity and psychiatric disorders. Monotherapy
with steroids is preferred in patients with hematological
abnormalities and in young patients with fertility concerns. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a hydrophilic bile acid with
immunomodulatary capability. Small-uncontrolled trials
have shown clinical and biochemical improvement and a
reduction in histological abnormality when given over 2
years [15]. Thirty of our patients received either prednisolone or azathioprine. Disease remission (clinical and
biochemical) was achieved in seventeen patients. On the
basis of limited data it has been shown that overlap syndromes of PBC or PSC and AIH with significant interface
hepatitis may respond, at least in part to corticosteroids
and such patients should receive a trial of immunosuppression [20]. The lone patient of overlap syndrome in the
present study did not respond to a trial of steroids.
Comparison of acute and chronic presentation did not
show any significant difference between clinical, laboratory, immunoserologic parameters, histology and treatment outcome. This indicates that autoimmune hepatitis
of acute onset is in fact a chronic disease with abrupt onset
of symptoms or acute exacerbation. The perceived acuteness or chronicity of the disease is a reflection of detection
bias. Due to a long duration of sub clinical disease, it may
be irrational to distinguish acute and chronic autoimmune hepatitis as both the presentations have similar
clinical, biochemical, immunoserologic and histologic
features.
Conclusion
In summary, our patients presented at an early age, had a
longer duration of symptoms. Female preponderance was
observed. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis was the most
common, whereas type 2 was not observed in our
patients. Clinical presentation was with advanced liver
disease (chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis) and acute hepatitis was less common. Most patients had SMA or ANA positive. Associated autoimmune diseases were common.
Hepatitis C infection was uncommon in our patients.
Comparison of acute and chronic presentations did not
reveal any significant difference, questioning the need for
any such distinction.
