Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection results predominantly in pulmonary involvement (Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19), 
but a direct, SARS-CoV-2-induced liver damage has also 
been described [1, 2]. Thus, it is important to monitor liver 
function and evaluate hepatic safety of drugs administered 
to COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleotide 
analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor, originally developed 
and tested for Ebola virus disease, showed in vitro efcacy 
against SARS-CoV-2 [3], and experience on its efcacy 
and safety for COVID-19 is accumulating [4, 5]. However, 
hepatic safety of RDV in COVID-19 has not been the focus 
of detailed investigation. Here, we describe patterns of liver 
toxicity in 5 COVID-19 patients treated with RDV in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) of Monaldi Hospital, Naples, Italy, 
during March and April 2020. Overall, our Hospital cared 
for 32 critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Treatment was given in a compassionate use program 
(CPU) approved by our Ethics Committee. CPU was limited 
to the frst 5 patients of our center who fulflled all eligibility criteria (invasive mechanical ventilation, no multiorgan 
failure, no vasopressor requirement, ALT levels<5 xULN, 
creatinine clearance>30 mL/min). RDV was administered 
intravenously as a 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg 
daily over 1 h for up to 9 days. According to the early recommendations of the Italian Society for Infectious Diseases, 
Lombardy section, all patients had been previously treated 
with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r, 400/100 mg twice daily 
po). Before and during RDV treatment, 4 of 5 patients also 
received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 200 mg twice daily po). 
While on RDV, no patient received acetaminophen, patient 2 
and 4 received ceftazidime–avibactam plus daptomycin and 
patient 3 meropenem and linezolid. None of the 5 treated 
patients had a previous history of liver disease, visceral obesity, viral hepatitis, or prior hepatotoxic medication or alcohol intake. Liver ultrasound did not show signs of advanced 
liver disease. Patient 1 and 2 had a history of hypertension 
and asthma, respectively, but were not receiving any relevant 
therapy in the ICU.
Figure 1 describes the dynamics of AST/ALT and bilirubin throughout the hospital stay, for each patient (Panels 
1–5). In Panel 6, we report a comparison of median ALT and 
AST levels between RDV-treated patients and 5 COVID-19 
patients who were treated in our Hospital ICU with the same 
schedule of LPV/r and HCQ, but without RDV. As shown 
in Panels 1–5, bilirubin increase occurred in 4 of 5 index 
patients on LPV/r. In contrast, the switch to RDV translated 
into a fast reduction of bilirubin and a signifcant increase in 
AST/ALT by day 3 of therapy in 4 of 5 patients. The single 
patient who did not receive HCQ with RDV (patient 4) did 
not show increase of ALT/AST levels. In no cases, RDV 
was discontinued because of liver injury. In patient 1, RDV 
was withdrawn at day 5 for a torsade de pointes requiring 
cardiac resuscitation, whereas patient 3 died on day 5 of 
RDV therapy. Final outcome was positive in 4/5 patients. 
Our observation supports previous findings obtained 
in healthy volunteers (Gilead Sciences, data on fle) and 
COVID-19 patients treated with RDV [4, 5], suggesting this 
antiviral may cause hepatocellular injury. In our patients, 
this adverse efect neither progressed to severe liver damage 
nor induced liver failure, although none had a prior chronic 
liver disease. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause 
aminotransferase elevation per se, 4 of our 5 patients had 
normal or slightly elevated AST/ALT levels at RDV treatment start, suggesting a direct role of RDV in hepatocellular toxicity. Despite the overall low number of patients

treated, we observed a clear trend of bilirubin elevation with 
LPV/r and ALT/AST elevation with RDV. Our observation 
suggests RDV can be used with close monitoring of liver 
function tests and with caution in subjects with prior liver 
disease.
