The state of artificial intelligence-based FDA-approved
medical devices and algorithms: an online database
Stan Benjamens 1,2, Pranavsingh Dhunnoo3 and Bertalan Meskó 3,4✉
At the beginning of the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) era, the expectations are high, and experts foresee that AI/
ML shows potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of medical conditions. However, the obstacles for
implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies.
Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved
by the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating
whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA
approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA
announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway
clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10
(15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively. We have
launched the first comprehensive and open access database of strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies that have been approved
by the FDA. The database will be constantly updated.

INTRODUCTION
The 2010s has brought a rise in the number of studies and papers
discussing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML) in medicine and healthcare (AI/ML). The number of
life science papers describing AI/ML rose from 596 in 2010 to
12,422 in 2019. While we are at the beginning of the AI/ML era, the
expectations are high and experts foresee that AI/ML shows
potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of
medical conditions1
.
Indeed, AI/ML-based technologies have been shown to support
several medical specialties from radiology2 and oncology3 to
ophthalmology4 and general medical decision-making5
. ML
models have been shown to reduce waiting times6
; improve
medication adherence7
; customize insulin dosages8; or help
interpret magnetic resonance images9
, among others.
Despite its promise, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML
in daily clinical practice are numerous10. These include issues with
transparency surrounding these software programs, the inherent
bias in the data they are fed with and how secure they are. A
crucial element shaping these obstacles is regulating such
technologies. The very use of the term AI requires further
clarification, as multiple subtypes have been proposed, and its
meaning can be vague. For the sake of further investments and
the public image, companies tend to overuse the term AI, when in
fact they have developed algorithms which are not AI/ML-based
per se.
We classify a technology as AI/ML based if official FDA
announcements, communications by the company or other
publicly available information resources used the expressions
‘deep learning,’ ‘machine learning,’ ‘deep neural networks,’
‘artificial intelligence,’ and/or ‘AI’ to describe the technology11.
For simplicity, we use the term “AI/ML-based” to denote these
technologies in this paper.With the increasing expertise and
attention on AI/ML in the medical field, the opportunities and
possible implications of its use are the topics of an ongoing
debate12. A crucial element in this implementation debate is
regulating such technologies.
As studies about AI’s role in medicine show, its use cases and
companies developing such technologies have been skyrocketing,
regulatory bodies, such as the US Food & Drugs Administration
(FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), have tried to
tackle its regulation and implementation. As the FDA has shown
leadership regarding the adoption of AI/ML-based medical
technologies, with a specific framework for AI/ML-based algorithms, we chose it as an example for further analysis13.
Because of the high-risk nature of these medical devices and
the unknown consequences of using AI/ML for medical decisionmaking and data analysis, the FDA has stringent regulatory
requirements for medical device licensing. Developers of AI/MLbased medical devices and algorithms have to go through
rigorous processes that are time and resource consuming. This
can be considered pivotal as a barrier for the introduction of AI/ML
in medicine.
Before medical hardware or software is legally made available in
the US market, the parent company has to submit it to the FDA for
evaluation. For medically oriented AI/ML-based algorithms, the
regulatory body has three levels of clearance, namely, 510(k)14,
premarket approval15 and the de novo pathway16, each of which
needs specific criteria to be fulfilled in order to be granted (Table 1).
For the development and marketing of medical algorithms, the
FDA’s stringent regulatory requirements pose important challenges to the companies developing them. Before, every new
product had to go through the regulatory process. However, as
companies update their algorithms on a much shorter time scale,

namely in days, the FDA has realized that this process might
become impossible to maintain. Therefore, the FDA started to
consider “a total product lifecycle-based regulatory framework for
these technologies that would allow for modifications to be made
from real-world learning and adaptation, while still ensuring that
the safety and effectiveness of the software as a medical device is
maintained”
13.
To date, the FDA has cleared or approved several medical
devices using “locked” algorithms. They define a “locked”
algorithm as an algorithm that provides the same result each
time the same input is applied to it and does not change.
However, many recent medical devices, especially when AI/ML
based, use algorithms that change and can adapt over time; these
are described by the FDA as adaptive algorithms, for which
current regulatory frameworks were not designed17. The power of
these AI/ML-based algorithms lies within the ability to continuously learn, where change to the algorithm might only be realized
after the device or software has been distributed for use and could
learn from real-world experience.
An attempt to solve this issue was proposed in the FDA’s
proposed regulatory framework from 201918, that “elaborates on a
potential approach to premarket review for artificial intelligence
and ML-driven software modifications”
13. It is recognized by the
FDA that these adaptive algorithms require a total product
lifecycle (TPLC) regulatory approach, enabling rapid cycle of
product improvement with effective safeguards.
This TPLC approach is based on the Digital Health Software
Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program19, allowing for the evaluation of
Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) products throughout the
lifecycle.
However, the FDA does not ask companies to categorize their
technology as AI/ML based when in fact it is. And some companies
mention that their technology is AI/ML based in the announcement of the FDA approval or the specific ML method they used,
but others do not. We witnessed this issue while working on this
paper ourselves.
At this moment, the evaluation of the processes for approval
and implementation is hampered by a lack of clarity on the
approval of AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms, as FDA
announcements do not clearly state the use of these methods.
Moreover, the search engine of the FDA’s website does not allow
users to perform specific search queries in FDA announcements
and summaries, thus hampering the accessibility of the database.
It can be expected from regulatory bodies to provide a clear
description of such devices; create and maintain a clear database,
allowing proper search queries, to assess the implementation of
new techniques. The FDA, like other regulatory agencies, has not
done any of these yet.
The purpose of this paper therefore was threefold: (1) to
provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based
medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the
FDA; (2) to create an up-to-date database of FDA approvals in this
field that welcomes submissions and might serve as the database
that the FDA should have; and (3) to raise awareness of the
importance of regulatory bodies clearly stating whether a medical
device is AI/ML based.
In line with this aim, we performed a systematic web-based
search for announcements of FDA approvals of AI/ML-based
medical devices and algorithms and cross-checked all approvals
on FDA.gov resulting in an open access and continuously
expandable database.
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive database of
strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies, in all medical specialties, that have been approved by the FDA. We also suggest a
threshold and definition of what defines a medical technology as
AI/ML based.
RESULTS
Cross-checked and validated medical devices and algorithms
Cross-checking and validation of all announcements resulted in a
database with 64 AI/ML based, FDA-approved medical devices
and algorithms. We decided to include only those 29 devices in
our further analysis that met the criteria of being considered an AI/
ML-based technology in the related official FDA announcements
(Table 2). For the other 35 devices, online sources other than the
FDA marked them as AI/ML-based technologies. A comprehensive
overview is provided in the online open access database.
A short overview of these medical devices and algorithms can
be found in the infographic (Fig. 1) and a detailed overview, with
subsequent directions to the official FDA announcements, is
provided in the online open access database.
Of these medical devices and algorithms, the vast majority (n =
23, 79.3%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while
5 (17.2%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (3.4%)
received PMA clearance.
The first FDA approval was granted in the year 2016, with three
approvals at the end of the year 2017. Most FDA approvals were
granted in the year 2018, with 13 (44.8%) approvals, while 10
(34.4%) and 2 (6.9%) approvals were granted in 2019 and 2020 up
until February, respectively.
The two main medical specialties with AI/ML-based medical
innovations are Radiology and Cardiology, with 21 (72.4%) and 4
(13.8%) FDA approved medical devices and algorithms respectively. The remaining medical devices and algorithms can be
grouped as focusing on internal medicine/endocrinology, neurology, ophthalmology, emergency medicine, and oncology.
The medical field of radiology is the trendsetter regarding FDAapproved medical devices and algorithms, with the introduction
of AI/ML-based solutions for worldwide applied image reading
software. Examples are the three algorithms for Arterys Inc.,
Arterys Cardio DL, Arterys Oncology DL and Arterys MICA, which
Table 1. Descriptions of the types of FDA approvals for AI/ML-based medical technologies.
Level of FDA clearance Description
510(k) clearance A 510(k) clearance for an algorithm is granted when it has been shown to be at least as safe and effective as another similar,
legally marketed algorithm. The submitter seeking this clearance must provide substantial proof of equivalence in their
application. Without an approval of being substantially equivalent to the other algorithm, the one pending approval cannot
be legally marketed.
Premarket approval Premarket approval is issued to algorithms for Class III medical devices. The latter are those that can have a large impact on
human health and as such, their evaluation undergo more thorough scientific and regulatory processes to determine their
safety and effectiveness. In order to approve an application, the FDA determines that the device’s safety and effectiveness is
supported by satisfactory scientific evidence. Upon approval, the applicant can proceed with marketing the product.
de novo pathway Regarding the de novo classification, it is used to classify those novel medical devices for which there are no legally
marketed counterparts, but which offer adequate safety and effectiveness with general controls. The FDA performs a riskbased assessment of the device in question before approval and allowing the device to be marketed.

are connected to the workflow Picture Archiving and Communication Systems from main vendors as Siemens Healthineers AG
(Germany) and GE Healthcare (USA)20. Six out of these 21
algorithms can be applied in the field of oncology, with three
focusing on mammography analyses (ProFound™ AI Software
V2.1, cmTriage and TransparaTM) and three others on CT-based
lesion detection (Arterys Oncology DL, Arterys MICA and QuantX).
This is followed by two algorithms focusing on brain image
analyses, with innovations for stroke and hemorrhage detection
(ContaCT, Accipiolx, and icobrain), and six algorithms to improve
image processing, with noise and radiation dosage reduction
(SubtlePET, Deep Learning Image Reconstruction, Advanced
Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine, SubtleMR, AI-Rad Companion (Pulmonary) and AI-Rad Companion (Cardiovascular)). Another four
algorithms focusing on acute care, with two algorithms for the
assessment of pneumothorax (HealthPNX and Critical Care Suite),
one focusing on wrist fracture diagnosis (OsteoDetect) and the
Aidoc Medical BriefCase system for triage of head, spine, and chest
injuries. The final two algorithms in this specialty can be applied
for cardiovascular assessments, focusing on the assessment of the
heart ejection fraction (EchoMD AEF Software and EchoGo Core).
Cardiology is another category with major advancements,
resulting in four FDA-approved medical devices and algorithms.
Most investment goes to innovations for the detection of cardiac
rhythm abnormalities, with FDA approval for the AI-ECG Platform
and Eko Analysis Software. The other two algorithms overlap with
the field of Radiology, being EchoMD AEF software and
EchoGo Core.
With diabetes affecting a significant part of society, innovations
to manage blood glucose levels were highly warranted. The first
steps were made with the introduction of the Guardian Connect
System by Medtronic and the DreaMed Diabetes system (DreaMed
Diabetes Ltd)21. AI/ML-based interpretation of laboratory results
was also introduced for the field of Internal Medicine, with the
FerriSmart Analysis System (Resonance Health Analysis Service Pty
Ltd) for liver iron concentration assessment.
To increase access to early eye disease detection, one company
introduced an AI/ML-based algorithm for the interpretation of
ophthalmology tests, being Idx (IDx LLC) for detection of diabetic
retinopathy22.
There are also some devices and algorithms related to
neurology, with broad overlap with the field of Radiology. In
addition to these overlapping algorithms, EnsoSleep was introduced for the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
Additional medical devices and algorithms
For these 35 medical devices, the application of AI/ML has not
been confirmed by the official FDA announcements but by other
online sources.
With the introduction of the BodyGuardian Remote Monitoring
System from Preventice Solutions in 2012, the first FDA-approved
AI/ML-based medical device was introduced23. This initiated
further investments in innovations for the detection of cardiac
rhythm abnormalities, resulting in 14 medical devices and
algorithms for this purpose. The other two algorithms in this field
focus on the detection of cardiac murmurs (eMurmer ID, CSD Labs
GmbH). Interest from multinational technology companies is
evident, with two FDA-approved algorithms from Apple Inc, being
the ECG App and Apple Irregular Rhythm Notification Feature.
Application of AI/ML-based algorithms for rapid interpretation
of the most general values in medical care, being the vital signs,
was achieved by Excel Medical Electronics, Spry Health and
Current Health. To further assist medical personnel in general,
Stratoscientific, Inc. introduced the Steth IO device to analyse
heart and lung sounds.
With two AI/ML-based algorithms, BrainScope Company Inc. has
introduced AI/ML for the evaluation of brain injuries. At first, this
company introduced Ahead 100, an electroencephalograph-based
algorithm to evaluate patients after a mild traumatic brain injury.
This algorithm was further developed, resulting in the introduction
of BrainScope TBI, an algorithm which can be used for a broader
scope of traumatic brain injuries—from functional abnormality
(concussions) to structural injury (brain bleeds)24. Further attention

goes to a gamified neurorehabilitation program, MindMotion GO
(MindMaze SA), which is introduced to support rehabilitation for
the elderly25. Using motion capture technology and an AI/MLbased algorithm, this invention promotes functional improvements. Other areas of interest are the assessment of memory loss
in the eldery (Cantab Mobile, Cambridge Cognition Ltd) and
seizure monitoring (Embrace, Empatica Srl.)26,27.
With a high disease burden and a shortage of care providers,
the medical field of psychiatry is in need of AI/ML-based
support28. Research efforts focus on the diagnosis and stratification of psychological disorders, followed by subsequent treatment support strategies. Two of these AI/ML-based algorithms
reached the stage of FDA approval, QbCheck (QbTech AB) and
ReSET-O (Pear Therapeutics Inc.). With QbCheck, healthcare
workers can substantiate their diagnosis or rule out attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enhancing objective
medical decisions in psychiatry29, whereas ReSET-O can be
applied for patients with Opioid Use Disorder, providing cognitive
behavioral therapy as a mobile medical application for prescription use only. As a next step, the ReSET-O algorithm will be used
in a randomized controlled trial, which is scheduled to start this
year (April, 2020)30.
DISCUSSION
In the beginning of the AI/ML era, it is especially important for the
medical and scientific community to have a clear understanding
of what medical technologies are considered AI/ML based and
which ones are regulated to see how those can become elements
of the toolset of medical professionals. Our database shows that it
is possible to define the threshold for categorizing a technology as
AI/ML based and also, that there is a need from regulatory
agencies to create their own databases.
Authors of this study hope that this database can serve as a
basis for the databases regulatory bodies will launch and the
definition of threshold they will publish.
There are limitations to our approach. We aimed at determining
the state of AI/ML-based medical devices and were met with three
initial obstacles. (1) We chose to look only at regulated devices as
companies tend to overhype the importance of their technology
or simply use the terms AI and ML for the sake of more
investments. (2) We chose to look at FDA approvals as the FDA has
shown leadership in regulating AI/ML-based medical technologies
and has published policies about that. And (3) we had to
determine what should be considered as an AI/ML-based medical
technology based on claims made in publicly available information sources.
While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, the primary aim of the project
is to encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to provide a
clear overview of approved AI/ML-based medical devices and
algorithms.
These obstacles also describe the possible limitations of our
approach. First, not all AI/ML-based medical devices have been
approved by the FDA, therefore we had to exclude many
unregulated technologies from the database. Second, there are
numerous AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms in other
countries outside the scope and supervision of the FDA. And third,
as the FDA does not maintain such a database, we had to set the
threshold for assessing what technology should be considered as
AI based. It is possible that the terms and expressions we looked
for could be too narrow for assessing AI/ML-based technologies.
While the scope of solving these issues exceeded our capacity,
we believe that this paper represents the results of a pioneering
work. No other curated database of FDA approvals of AI/ML-based
devices and algorithms that serve medical purposes exists. As
such solutions become increasingly adapted in the healthcare
setting, the importance of such an easily accessible database will
become more apparent.
While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, we encourage the FDA and
other regulatory bodies to take over this database or launch their
own. The EMA already provides guidelines and statements about
AI and would benefit from the addition of such a repository. This
will help those local and international institutions and the public
as the use of AI/ML-based medical technologies in healthcare has
become imminent.
The FDA, which is the very source of these approvals, possesses
the necessary resources required to perform in-depth analysis
regarding the credibility and accuracy of algorithms for medical
purposes. Especially, having access to the background database of
their search engine where the content of FDA approval summaries
is available.
Also, regulatory bodies could establish a clearer definition of
what falls under the terms AI and ML This would also make it
easier for developers, companies, researchers, journalists, and the
general public to determine whether an approved technology is in
fact AI/ML based.
We aimed at providing a method and a model for achieving
that.
On top of the rise in AI/ML-based algorithms, reports show a
comparable increase in the global market size for AI/ML in
healthcare. The value is projected to soon exceed US$28 billion
from its 1 billion value in 201631. Software and devices using the
technology will inevitably contribute to this market share.
However, despite the increasingly available AI/ML-based
medical solutions on the market, there remains the factor of
adopting those very solutions. The challenge to adopting these in
the medical practice can be attributed to hindrances due to
regulatory frameworks and trust issues with new technologies
from both the physicians and patients side32.
There needs to be a paradigm shift when implementing new
technologies, including AI/ML-based ones, in the healthcare
system and key regulators play a crucial role in this as stated in
the previous section.
According to our findings, there were no AI/ML-based devices
approved by the FDA in 2010 and 2011. In the year 2012, we
identified two while in 2019 alone, there were 22, amounting the
number of relevant software programs to 64. In a decade, there
was a major increase in the amount of these technologies.
As new approvals of AI/ML-based medical technologies become
available, it will become even more difficult to keep track of all
relevant announcements. This open access database that we set
up and will continuously maintain could help serve as a reference
for interested parties working on similar software or for research
purposes; and as such will hopefully be a useful tool for the
medical and scientific community.
METHODS
Reasoning for not being able to do searches thoroughly
on fda.gov
The most obvious method for our research would have been to check the
official FDA database on FDA.gov and look for AI/ML-related terms in the
summaries or approvals. The FDA’s official website does feature a search
engine option, making all of its announcements freely accessible. However,
searches cannot be filtered according to their content such as approval
announcements or specific words. Looking for AI/ML-related terms in this
way is not possible on the FDA’s search engine.
The FDA also provides reports of approvals in the 510(k), PMA and de
novo categories on a monthly basis, but these provide basic information
about the device or software approved and its company, with no mention
of its function33.
In the next section, we outline the search strategy we chose to use that
still ensures that all items in the database are cross-checked but could also
mean that the database might not be complete. While not ideal, this issue

also underscores the notion that the FDA’s website could improve its
search function with a filter feature so as to provide more streamlined
results. Moreover, given that the database we built is open to submissions,
we hope to make it as complete and as comprehensive as possible.
Search strategy employed for the database
For our search, we used a search strategy with the following steps: first,
reliable resources, where FDA announcements appear regularly, were
selected; second, these resources were used to identify relevant
announcements; third, all identified announcements were cross-checked
in the search engine of fda.gov.
Announcements from the websites listed were prioritized, scrutinized for
relevant ones and then cross-checked on the FDA’s website for the official
approval: mobihealthnews.com; bmj.com; medscape.com; lancet.com;
sciencedaily.com; radiologybusiness.com; and acrdsi.org. In the announcements, we had to focus on key words that would point to the use of AI/ML
in a medically oriented device or software that has been approved by the
FDA (Fig. 2).
As the FDA does not have a threshold for marking devices as AI/MLbased, our observations showed that the most logical way to determine if
a software program or device can be considered as AI/ML based is if the
official FDA announcement contains any of these expressions: “machine
learning”, “deep learning”, “deep neural networks”, “artificial intelligence”,
and/or “AI.” Taking this into consideration, we used the following search
strategy: (“FDA approval” OR “FDA clearance” OR “Approved by the FDA”)
AND “Machine learning” OR “Deep learning” OR “Deep neural networks”
OR “artificial intelligence” OR “AI”).
Nevertheless, we found that not all announcements use these terms
even if the underlying algorithm can be defined as AI/ML based. For
example, when looking for a specific device like AliveCor Inc.’s Kardia, the
FDA announcement does not mention any of the expressions we looked
for, while the company elsewhere states that their device uses an AI/MLbased algorithm34. We decided to include these devices and algorithms as
well, although we clearly marked in the database that the related FDA
announcements do not contain any of the expressions we looked for.
Instead, we included those not FDA-related announcements with a URL
that did.
We performed search queries for the time period between the 1st of
January 2010 and the 1st of March 2020. As AI/ML-based technologies in
medicine started gaining attention in the mid-2010s, we chose a longer
time period to avoid missing important announcements. Once a relevant
software program or product was identified from one of those websites, its
authenticity was verified on fda.gov and recorded in our database with the
accompanying FDA approval number.
We also extended our searches to other websites to ensure that we did
not miss any announcements, but the majority came from the abovementioned resources. Moreover, every single announcement recorded in
our database was reviewed independently by the other authors of
this paper.
Online database and submission of new announcements
Following our collective input, cross-checking and validations, we created
an online database to aggregate the results under the URL https://
medicalfuturist.com/fda-approved-ai-based-algorithms/. This open access
database will be regularly updated by the authors as the FDA approves
new AI/ML-based devices and software.
The database includes the following details for each approval: name of
the device or algorithm; name of the company; short description; FDA
approval number; type of FDA approval; mention of AI/ML in the
announcement, if no mention of AI/ML in FDA announcement (URL); date
of approval; medical specialty it is related to; secondary medical specialty it
is related to.
Due to the nature of the search strategy we chose to use, it is possible
that we have missed some announcements. Therefore, we added a
submission feature on the database, allowing the community to submit
new ones that have been released after our search concluded or even
those that we might have missed during our initial search. All community
submissions will be cross-checked and verified before being considered to
be added to the database.
The infographic
In order to provide a clear picture about the state of AI/ML based, FDAapproved medical devices and algorithms; demonstrate which medical
specialties those are related to, and how their number has been rising
since 2010, we put all the cross-checked and verified devices in an
infographic.
The infographic contains a device’s name, its short description, its
relation to a primary and a secondary medical specialty and what kind of
FDA approval it received. The same colors are assigned to the same
medical specialty.
