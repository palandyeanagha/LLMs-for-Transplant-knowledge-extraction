Abstract
Background: In December 2019, a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, China. The
pneumonic disease caused by this virus is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health
Organization (WHO).
As case numbers have increased worldwide, gastro-intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
and vomiting have been increased, these symptoms associated with positive laboratory results including abnormal
liver function tests, renal function tests, and D-Dimer levels.
Although there are multiple articles evaluated the imaging findings in HRCT of COVID-19 patients that helped in
understanding the disease course and potential complications in the chest, yet there are—to our knowledge—
limited data about the abdominal imaging findings of the course and potential abdominal complications of COVID19 notably in the intensive care units (ICU).
Results: Forty-one sonographic examinations were done for 30 confirmed COVID-intensive care patients presented
with abdominal symptoms.
Of the 30 patients, 26 were males (86.66%), and 4 were females (13.3%), the average age of the patients was 57.7
years old.
The most common sonographic observation was hepatomegaly (n, 23/41, 56%) and biliary system disease (n, 17/41,
41.4%); the imaging findings were correlated with the clinical and laboratory data. CT examination when indicated
(in our study to assess hematomas for active extravasation and to assess bowel obstruction and its level).
Conclusion: Abdominal sonographic imaging was often performed for inpatients with COVID-19. Hepatobiliary
dysfunction as well as nephropathy was the most common imaging findings.

Background
In December 2019, a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus
infection occurred in Wuhan, China. The novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses [1–3]. The pneumonic disease
caused by this virus is called coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO),
on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a global public
health emergency against the outbreak of COVID-19. The
WHO recognized the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) as a worldwide pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1, 2].
The classical symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough
and fever and the diagnosis is confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
testing for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid. Early radiological

studies focused on chest imaging with classical highresolution CT (HRCT) findings of peripheral patches of
ground-glass densities with or without consolidations
with bilateral basal predominance, organizing pneumonia pattern, crazy paving, mild bronchiectasis, and vascular engorgement may be encountered as well [4, 5].
As case numbers have increased worldwide, gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and vomiting have been increased; these symptoms are associated with positive laboratory results
including abnormal liver function tests, renal function
tests, and D-Dimer levels [6, 7].
Although there are multiple articles evaluated the imaging findings in HRCT of COVID-19 patients that
helped in understanding the disease course and potential
complications in the chest, yet there are—to our knowledge—limited data about the abdominal imaging findings of the course and potential abdominal
complications of COVID-19 [8].
Aim of the work
This retrospective study was conducted aiming to
characterize the sonographic abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19 intensive care patients and to highlight the potential abdominal complications to help in
understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the
abdomen.
Methods
This is a retrospective study analysis of 30 intensive care
patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and presented with abdominal signs and symptoms and/or abnormal visceral laboratory tests.
Each patient was subjected to the following:
I- Thorough history taking including the following:
 Recent travel history especially to known
epidemic disease territories
 Recent contact with confirmed COVID-19
patient
 Suspicious chest symptoms: fever, dry cough,
tremors
 History of underlying medical condition: DM,
HTN
 Abdominal signs and symptoms: nausea,
vomiting, pain, distention, diarrhea, and
constipation
II- Clinical examination: Complete clinical
examination was done for each patient
III- Laboratory investigations
A For confirmation of COVID-19
 Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab with
real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) test
 CBC
B Tailored for the clinical scenario
 Liver function tests: especially serum bilirubin,
alkaline phosphatase level (ALP)
 Renal function tests
 D-dimer test
 Coagulation profile: INR, partial thromboplastin
time, platelet count
IV-Radiological investigations
 Ultrasonography: 41 abdominopelvic
sonographic examinations were done using a
portable GE machine to 30 intensive care
patients, due to high human to human
transmission incidence, portable ultrasound
machine (GE healthcare Voluson E6 BT17
ultrasound machine) was used (to limit transport
of the patients to the radiology department).
 MDCT: 3 CT examinations done for 3 patients,
chest assessment was included in the study, the
initial CT protocol was non-contrast scan and
post-contrast scan in the venous phase, but this
was tailored according to the clinical situation,
scans in the arterial phase and delayed phase in
the clinical context of abdominal pain and decrease hemoglobin level to investigate possible
bleeders and these arterial and delayed scans were
added in two patients with suspected spontaneous
bleeding. Scans in the arterial and venous phases
were added in one patient with suspected bowel
obstruction and suspected ischemic bowel etiology. Reconstructions of the volume at 0.625 mm
to 1.25 slice thickness, examinations were performed on Siemens Somatom Definition Edge 128
slice helical CT scanner.
Picture archiving and communication system viewer
was used (GE PACS).
V- Data analysis and interpretations
To decrease the subjective judgment and to reach objective assessment, the following definitions were
respected: Gall bladder/bowel mural thickening (when
measures more than 3 mm in diameter), gall bladder distention (when the gall bladder measures 4 cm in transverse diameter), acute cholecystitis (positive sonographic
murphy’s sign, thickened edematous wall pericholecystic
collection, pericholecystic hyperemia).
Abdelmohsen et al. Egyptian Journal of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine (2020) 51:198 Page 2 of 7

Hepatomegaly (the liver right lobe measures more
than 16 cm in midclavicular line)
VI-Infection control precautions
 Using portable machine to limit transport of the
patients to the radiology department
 The transported patients to the department for CT
examinations must wear a mask
 Droplet type precautions are used. All the attending
medical staff should wear personal protective
equipment (PPE) including: N95 mask, eye protective
devices (googles/face shield), gowns, and gloves
 The machine is covered during the examination
 Proper cleaning following the examination was done

Results
In this retrospective study, 41 abdominal imaging studies
were done for 30 intensive care confirmed COVID-19
patients presented with abdominal symptoms.
Of the 30 patients, 26 were males (86.6%, and 4 were
females (13.33%), the age range from 91 to 21 years old,
with mean age was 57.7 years old. The patients were distributed in Table 1 according to the age, the largest age
group was (more than 50 to 60 years group ) included 8
patients (26.6%) (Table 1).
The most frequent indication for sonographic examinations was increase liver function tests especially serum
bilirubin (n, 21/41; 51.2%) (Fig. 1), followed by increase
renal function tests (Fig. 2) (n, 6/41;14.6%) (Table 2).
Forty-one sonographic studies were done for 30 intensive care COVID-19 patients, 34 examination were positive for relevant findings (n, 34/41; 82.9%), and 7
sonographic studies were unremarkable (n, 7/41; 17.0%)
(Table 2).
The most frequent sonographic finding was hepatomegaly (23/41, 56.09%), most of the cases showed increase liver function tests with bright echo pattern of the
hepatic parenchyma, biliary system disease was the second most frequent observation (17/41; 41.47%) including
gall bladder distention, biliary mud, wall thickening, and
dilated common bile duct (Fig. 1).
Nephropathy was the 3rd most common (n, 7/41;
17%); the most evident sonographic findings were increase renal parenchymal echogenicity bilaterally as well
as parenchymal thinning (Fig. 2) (Table 3).
Three patients were subjected to CT examinations, the
indications for CT examination included to exclude active
bleeding in two patients and to assess intestinal obstruction in one patient. Two patients subjected to sonographic
studies followed by CT studies for more characterization
and to exclude possible active extravasation (one patient
with left rectus hematoma and another patient with rightsided retroperitoneal hematoma) (Fig. 3), one patient with
abdominal distention with limited sonographic assessment, and CT examination shows small bowel obstruction
mostly of ischemic etiology (Fig. 4).
Discussion
To our knowledge, there is a paucity of literature on sonographic abdominal imaging features of COVID-19 patients, by continuously increasing in number of the
confirmed COVID-19 patients all over the world

(exceeding 9,700,000 patients at the time of writing), there
are increasing frequency of GIT symptoms and ICU admission with the limitation in possible CT examinations
for isolated and mechanically ventilated patients, the most
common indications for sonographic studies in the ICU
were elevated liver function tests (n, 21/41; 51.2%), this
matches with the COVID-19 frequent abdominal imaging
study indications in Bhayana R et al. study [9], this study
was done on both ICU and non-ICU patients with more
frequent indications in their study like abdominal pain [9].
Up to date, the most acceptable pathogenesis of
COVID-19 infection is that SARS-COV2 virus can gain
access to the respiratory alveolar epithelial cells by binding
to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
[10], leading to cytokine-mediated immune response and
inflammation, imaging findings, and disease course are
further affected by severity of the cytokine-mediated inflammation (e.g., cytokine storm syndrome). Circulating
cytokines can impact multiple other organ systems, causing secondary diseases and complications [11].
ACE2 receptors are also found in the brain, arterial,
and venous vascular endothelial cells, kidney, liver (hepatocytes and cholangiocytes), GIT, and gall bladder epithelial cells. This offers a chance for direct viral invasion
of theses organs with variable clinical presentations and
imaging spectrum [11, 12].
In our study, male to female ratio was 6.5:1, while in
Bhayana et al.’s study [9], male to female ratio was 1.4:1, with
similarity in increase male to female ratio in both studies.
Hepatomegaly was the most common findings in
sonographic examinations with bright echo patterns
reflecting diffuse hepatic parenchymal disease (n, 23/41;
56.1%) followed by biliary system disease (n, 17/41;

41.4%). Hepatic dysfunction could be noted in about
50% of COVID-19 patients [13].
Ji et al. [14] demonstrated that COVID19 patients
with high body mass index and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) have a greater risk for both
progressions in liver damage and COVID-19, in similarity to our study, these patients show increase liver
function tests with hepatomegaly. Progression in liver
damage related to NAFLD (and potentially other
chronic liver disorders) will complicate COVID-19
presentation, clinical course, and the role of imaging,
with the potential for hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding [14].
Sonographic findings of biliary disease were noted
in 41.4% in our study sample, biliary system disease
was noted in 54% in Bhayana et al.’s study [9]
spectrum of gall bladder pathology was noted in our
study including luminal mud, stone, mural thickening,
signs of inflammation with edematous wall, mural
hyperemia, and thin rim pericholecystic fluid could be
noted, this spectrum of findings is similar to Bhayan
et al.’s study with their population sample in their
study including ICU and non-ICU patients. SARSCOV2 can bind to the gall bladder epithelial cells
leading to mucosal inflammation and this can explain
the sonographic observations [14].
SARS-CoV-2 has a direct inflammatory effect on
vascular endothelium [15]. Further, systemic coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients with
COVID-19 [16, 17]. Tang et al. [16] found that next
to an increased risk of thrombosis, patients seem to
have an increased risk of bleeding as well, due to imbalances in platelet production and disruption, and
disorders of the coagulation system. Coagulopathy sequel in our study was noted in four examinations
(9.7%) including spontaneous hematomas noted in
two examinations as well as vascular thrombotic sequel noted in two examinations. Major bleeding sequel to COVID-19 was noted in two patients only in
Conti C et al.’s published study [17].
Nephropathy was the 3rd most common sonographic
observation (n, 7/41; 17%) in our study, associated increase in renal function tests was noted. Few studies focused mainly on renal histopathology in COVID-19

patients were published [18, 19]. Further dedicated imaging studies are needed for more clarification.
The authors recommend dealing with COVID-19 as a
systemic disease possibly due to possible direct viral cytopathic effect on the ACE-2 receptors rich organs and/
or harmful systemic immune-mediated response to
SARS-COV 2 infection.
The limitation of this study was that of a single-center
retrospective study, which limits its generalizability.
Pathologic correlation was not available for many patients with imaging abnormalities.
Conclusions
Dedicated sonographic abdominal imaging was often
performed for COVID-19 intensive care patients with
clinicolaboratory abnormal findings with subsequent improvement of the management plan. Hepatobiliary dysfunction, nephropathy as well as coagulopathy sequel in
the abdomen were the most common imaging findings.
COVID-19 should be considered as a systemic disease.
