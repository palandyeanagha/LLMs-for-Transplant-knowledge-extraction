Whole blood impedance aggregometry as a
biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of
severe sepsis
Michael Adamzik†, Klaus Görlinger†, Jürgen Peters and Matthias Hartmann*
Abstract
Introduction: Sepsis leads to an activation of the immune system and hemostatis. However, studies on platelet
aggregation in severe sepsis using impedance aggregometry have not been performed and the diagnostic and
prognostic capabilities are unknown. In the present study we hypothesized that impedance aggregometry findings
might serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis.
Methods: Eighty patients with severe sepsis and 50 postoperative patients were included in the prospective
observational study. Platelet function was determined at the first day of severe sepsis and surgery, respectively,
using impedance aggregometry (Multiplate®). Moreover, platelet count, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, C-reactive
protein and 30-day mortality were determined.
Results: Compared to postoperative patients, platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in patients with severe
sepsis (collagen-test: 70.8 (44.4, 83.2) arbitrary units (A.U.) vs. 26.8 (12.7, 45.8) A.U.; P <0.001; median and quartiles).
Furthermore, marked differences in platelet function were observed in survivors and non-survivors of severe sepsis
(collagen-test: 33.4 (10.9, 48.8) A.U. vs. 12.4 (6.5, 25.0) A.U.; P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that
higher platelet function was associated with a mortality of 10%, while mortality was 40% when platelet function
was low (collagen-test; P = 0.002). The odds ratio was 6.0. In both univariate and multivariate analyses (including
procalcitonin, IL6, C-reactive protein and platelet count) impedance aggregometry using collagen as the activator
proved to be the best and an independent predictor for the diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis in critical
illness.
Conclusions: In severe sepsis, impedance aggregometry allows better prediction of diagnosis and survival than
conventional biomarkers and platelet count.
Introduction
Sepsis is the third most common cause of death in western
countries. Despite the advances in intensive care medicine
the prognosis of the disease has improved only gradually
[1]. Concerning the pathophysiology, sepsis has been
shown to be caused by a generalized and inappropriate
activation of the immune system and hemostasis; both
plasma components and platelets are affected by the
disease [2].
In recent years, evidence has accumulated that platelets and inflammation are tightly coupled. An active
function of platelets in inflammation has recently been
demonstrated: several studies suggest that platelets serve
as circulating sentinels that bind infectious agents and
present them to the reticuloendothelial system [3-5].
Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that Toll-like
receptors 1, 2, 4 and 9 are localized on the surface of
human platelets, and thus an effect of endotoxins on
platelets in sepsis has been hypothesized [6]. Indeed, the
evidence is growing that activation of TLRs is responsible for the LPS-induced thrombocytopenia and TNFalpha production [7]. Experimental findings on platelet
aggregation due to lipopolysaccharide and bacteria, however, are contradictory. In a rat endotoxin model, a
decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation was determined and bacterial products were shown to inhibit

platelet function in human platelets [8-11]. In contrast, a
recent study demonstrates in an ex vivo setting that bacteria isolated from patients with Gram-positive sepsis
can induce platelet aggregation [12]. This notion was
confirmed by Rasmussen et al. who described that clinical isolates from Enterococcus faecalis can aggregate
human platelets [13]. However, in another study, differences in the pro-aggregatory effects were observed
between bacterial strains and individuals [14].
A new device for the measurement of platelet function
using whole blood impedance aggregometry as the principle is available [15]. The Multiplate® device (Verum
Diagnostica, Munich, Germany) allows the simultaneous
measurement of whole blood samples with five activators
and the computerized design makes a point of care measurement possible. The device has been demonstrated to
be a valuable tool in different clinical settings. In cardiology, impedance aggregometry is predictive of stent
thrombosis and early mortality following percutaneous
coronary intervention [16]. In neuroradiology, the device
was used to predict stent thrombosis and adverse events
[17]. Moreover, impedance aggregometry is predictive of
blood loss in cardiac surgery [18]. However, impedance
aggregometry findings in patients with sepsis have not
been investigated.
It was the aim of the present study to investigate the
effects of severe sepsis on platelet function using impedance aggregometry. We hypothesized that impedance
aggregometry might serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis in critical illness.
Materials and methods
Patients
This study was formally and specifically reviewed and
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Essen, the appropriate institutional review board.
Informed written consent was given by postoperative
patients. Informed consent of patients with sepsis was
waived by the ethics committee, but written informed
consent for the use of data was acquired from the surviving patients after recovery from the disease. Eighty
patients admitted to an ICU of the University Hospital
Essen were considered eligible for the prospective observational study, if they fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis as recently defined [19]. As the control group, 50
patients admitted to the ICU after surgery but without
meeting criteria of sepsis were chosen. Within 24 hours,
blood was drawn and procalcitonin, interleukin 6, Creactive protein, platelet count, international normalized
ratio (INR), thrombin time and fibrinogen were determined. Moreover, simplified acute physiology score
(SAPS II) and sequential organ failure assessment score
(SOFA) were calculated over the first 24 h after the
patient met the severe sepsis criteria [20,21]. All patients
were followed-up at 30 days for survival. Details of
patients’ characteristics are given in Table 1.
Impedance aggregometry
For the platelet function tests, heparinized samples were
subjected to the Multiplate® analysis according to the
manufacturer´s recommendations. A total of 300 μl saline
and 300 μl heparinized whole blood were added to the test
cell. After three minutes of incubation at 37°C, samples
were activated with arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or thrombin receptor activating
peptide 6 (TRAP) according to the manufacturer´s recommendations (Verum Diagnostica, Munich, Germany).
Normal values of aggregometry are given in the appropriate tables. Platelet aggregation findings were assessed by
determination of the area under curve in arbitrary units
(A.U.).
Assays for procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and C-reactive
protein concentrations
For the determination of procalcitonin concentration, the
Liaison Brahms PCT assay (Diasorin S.p.A., Sallugia, Italy)
was used. C-reactive protein was measured with the CRP
wide-range assay of the Avidia 1650 chemistry system
(Bayer Healthcare, LLC, Leverkusen, Germany). Interleukin 6 was determined by using an Immulite 2000 systems
analyzer and reagents (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics
Products, Ltd., Duisburg, Germany).
Statistical assessments
Values are given as mean and standard deviation as well as
median and quartiles. For the statistical evaluation of differences between groups, the Mann-Whitney test was
used since normal distribution of several values was
excluded by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Receiver operating
characteristic curves and the correspondent areas under
the curve, the asymptotic significances and the 95%
asymptotic confidence intervals were used for the univariate comparison of impedance aggregometry findings with
conventional biomarkers. Correlation coefficients given in
the results are derived from linear correlation analyses.
Dependence of 30-day survival on impedance aggregometry findings was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier-analysis.
The median of the respective variable was used as the cutoff to discriminate groups with low and high values,
respectively. Furthermore, the odds ratios were determined, as appropriate.
The diagnostic and prognostic value of impedance
aggregometry, conventional biomarkers and platelet
count was also determined by multivariate analyses
using logistic regression. SPSS Version 19 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical procedures.
An a priori alpha error P of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results
Impedance aggregometry as a biomarker for the
diagnosis of severe sepsis in critical illness
Platelet aggregation was determined in 80 patients with
severe sepsis and in 50 postoperative patients, respectively.
The results demonstrate decreased platelet aggregation in
patients with severe sepsis as assessed with the four activators (Figure 1). Moreover, the conventional biomarkers of
inflammation, namely procalcitonin, interleukin 6 and Creactive protein were determined. The results, shown in
Figure 2, demonstrate that procalcitonin is capable of
detecting patients with severe sepsis in critical illness,
while C-reactive protein was elevated in both postoperative patients and patients with severe sepsis. Interleukin 6
was even lower in patients with severe sepsis (when compared with postoperative patients). Data on impedance
aggregometry findings, conventional sepsis markers, ICU
scores and conventional coagulation variables in postoperative patients and patients with severe sepsis are summarized in Table 2.
To further compare impedance aggregometry with
conventional biomarkers, receiver operating characteristic curves were generated from the variables (Figure 3).
The areas under the curve as a measure of assay reliability obtained from these curves as well as the significance
levels and the confidence intervals are shown in Table 3.
The results demonstrate that impedance aggregometry
using collagen as the activator was a better biomarker for
the diagnosis of severe sepsis in critical illness than procalcitonin, interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein. The
results are confirmed by multivariate analyses. Inclusion
of procalcitonin, interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein, as
well as impedance aggregometry findings obtained by
one of the four activators, demonstrated that impedance
aggregometry findings obtained with the activators ADP
(P = 0.009), collagen (P = 0.002) and thrombin receptor
activating peptide (P <0.001), but not arachidonic acid,
were independent predictors of severe sepsis in critical
illness. Comparison of the four activators with procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein in one analysis
demonstrated that impedance aggregometry using collagen as the activator (P = 0.002) was the best predictor
of severe sepsis in critical illness and thus confirm the
results of univariate analyses.
Impedance aggregometry as a biomarker for the
prognosis of severe sepsis in critical illness
Comparison of platelet function in survivors and nonsurvivors of sepsis demonstrated significant lower impedance aggregometry values in non-survivors when ADP,
collagen or TRAP were used as the activators. When
arachidonic acid was used as the activator, no significant

difference was detectable. Furthermore, procalcitoninand IL-6 concentrations were higher in non-survivors.
Details of impedance aggregometry findings, conventional sepsis markers, ICU scores and coagulation variables in survivors and non-survivors of severe sepsis are
summarized in Table 4. The correspondent analyses of
receiver operating characteristic curves for these variables are shown in Table 5.
To investigate the potential of impedance aggregometry as a predictor for the prognosis of severe sepsis,
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed. The results,
shown in Figure 4, demonstrate that mortality differs in
patients exhibiting lower and higher platelet function
than the median, respectively. The best prediction of
outcome was achieved by collagen-test and ADP-test
with an odds-ratio of 6.0. Mortality was 40% in those
patients with reduced platelet function, but only 10% in
those patients exhibiting better aggregation. Impedance
aggregometry using thrombin receptor activating peptide as the activator allowed differentiation between
good and poor prognosis, although with a lower odds
ratio (OR 3.1). Mortality differences were not detectable
when arachidonic acid was used as the activator. Among
the conventional biomarkers of sepsis, an interleukin 6
concentration showed significant differences between
survivors and non-survivors, while procalcitonin and Creactive protein failed.
Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic
regression to evaluate which of the impedance aggregometry activators is an independent predictor of outcome. Procalcitonin, interleukin 6 and C-reactive
protein as well as the results of impedance aggregometry

obtained with one of the four activators were included
in the analysis. The results of these analyses demonstrate that aggregometry findings obtained with ADP,
collagen and TRAP were independent predictors of survival in severe sepsis (ADP: P = 0.049, collagen: P =
0.033; thrombin receptor activating peptide: P = 0.041).
Impedance aggregometry using arachidonic acid as the
activator failed as a predictor.
To determine the best predictor of survival in severe
sepsis, logistic regression analysis was performed. Impedance aggregometry findings obtained with the four activators and the conventional biomarkers were included in
one analysis. The results demonstrate that impedance
aggregometry with collagen as the activator was the best
and an independent predictor of survival in severe sepsis
(P = 0.03). In Figure 5, the estimated survival as a function of the collagen induced platelet aggregation findings
derived from logistic regression analysis is shown.
Comparison of impedance aggregometry findings with
platelet count
Impedance aggregometry findings might be affected by
the platelet count. To exclude that impedance aggregometry simply reflects platelet count, we compared both
variables. Platelet count was 196 (154, 245)/nl in postoperative patients and 107 (57, 187)/nl in patients with
severe sepsis (medians and quartiles, Table 2). Comparison of impedance aggregometry findings with platelet
count demonstrated only low correlations with the four

activators in postoperative patients (r2
: range 0.297 to
0.508) and patients with severe sepsis (r2
: range 0.287 to
0.441). Correlations among the four impedance aggregometry activators were between 0.320 and 0.671 (r2
) in
postoperative patients and between 0.253 and 0.566 (r2
)
in patients with severe sepsis. In order to determine
whether impedance aggregometry or platelet count is
the better predictor of severe sepsis in critical illness,
multivariate analysis was performed. In the logistic
regression analysis, impedance aggregometry using four
activators and platelet count was included. The results
of the analysis demonstrate that platelet aggregometry
findings using collagen and thrombin receptor activating
peptide as the activators are the best and independent
predictors of severe sepsis in critical illness (P = 0.009
and P = 0.002, respectively).
In non-survivors, platelet count was 65 (44, 95)/nl at
the first day of sepsis, while 131 (44, 95)/nl platelets were
determined in the survivors (medians, quartiles, P =
0.001). Multivariate analysis was used to determine
whether platelet function or platelet count is the better
predictor of outcome. Logistic regression analysis, including platelet count and platelet aggregation findings
obtained with the four activators, demonstrated that
platelet aggregation induced by collagen is the best and
an independent predictor for survival in severe sepsis
(P < 0.001).
Conventional coagulation variables and scores as
biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of severe
sepsis
Among the coagulation markers INR, thrombin time
and fibrinogen, only INR showed moderate predictive
value for both diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis
in the present study. Thrombin time and fibrinogen did
not differ significantly (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). The SAPS II
and SOFA score were both excellent markers for the
diagnosis of severe sepsis, but only the SAPS II score
was capable of differentiating between survivors and
non-survivors of severe sepsis (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5).
Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that impedance aggregometry findings are good predictors of the
diagnosis of severe sepsis in critical illness and the outcome of severe sepsis. Notably, impedance aggregometry
findings using collagen as the activator proved to be a
better biomarker for both diagnosis of severe sepsis in

critical illness and survival of severe sepsis than procalcitonin, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein and platelet
count.
Impedance aggregometry using the Multiplate® device
has been demonstrated to be predictive of bleeding in
cardiac surgery as well as thrombosis and early mortality
in percutaneous coronary and neuroradiology stenting,
respectively [16,17]. Unlike the Born aggregometry, the
method relies on measurement of impedance changes
caused by platelet aggregation on electrodes in whole
blood samples [15,22]. Thus, no centrifugation step is
necessary and measurement can be done in the intensive
care setting. Pipetting with an automated pipette is
guided by a computer menu. Within 12 minutes, results
are obtained and hands-on time is about 6 minutes. Dual
measurements in each vial allow automatic quality control. Costs per measurement are actually below 10€. The
measurement of platelet function in whole blood samples
might be advantageous: the presence of the patient´s
plasma, including all mediators and all circulating blood
cells, in a certain pathophysiological setting might affect
the results, while the Born aggregometry is often performed in a standardized citrated medium and, thus, is
more artificial. Moreover, the Born aggregometry
requires a specialized laboratory.
The finding that platelet aggregation is a valuable biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis
is in close agreement with the changes observed in the
hemostatic system in severe sepsis. It has convincingly
been demonstrated that the DIC score is a predictor of
outcome [23]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that
inhibition of clot lysis, as determined by thromboelastometry, is a good marker for severe sepsis in critical illness
[24]. Additionally, we demonstrated that a hypocoagulative status, determined by the same method, is a good
predictor of survival in severe sepsis [25]. Although the
present study was not designed to define mechanisms of
platelet hyporesponsiveness, some suggestions can be
made. Disseminated intravascular coagulation in severe
sepsis is caused by the expression of tissue factor on the
surface of monocytes and the procoagulatory shift of the
endothelium [2]. As a consequence, coagulation occurs
in microcirculation and leads to the deposition of fibrin
and platelets. Accordingly, the concentration of coagulation factors will decrease and the population of well functioning platelets will be sequestered in the capillaries
[26]. Thus, the samples drawn from patients with severe
sepsis might show platelet aggregation of the remaining
hyporesponsive platelets. Moreover, the common activators of platelet aggregation, which are ADP, thrombin
and collagen have all been demonstrated to be altered in
sepsis [27-30]. Homologous and heterologous desensitization of signal transduction pathways might, therefore,
serve as an explanation for altered platelet reactivity in
severe sepsis [31].
For the prediction of diagnosis, as well as outcome of
severe sepsis collagen, ADP and thrombin receptor activating peptide can be used as the activators for impedance aggregometry. In contrast, arachidonic acid was
only a moderate biomarker for the diagnosis of severe
sepsis in critical illness and failed to predict outcome.
The reasons for the discrepancy observed between the
diagnostic and prognostic value of the activators used are
not known. However, recent evidence deriving from neutrophils, showing multiple alterations in signal transduction during sepsis, favors the point of view that changes
in signal transduction might be responsible for the
observed changes in platelet aggregation [32]. Interestingly, the median values of the postoperative patients
were near the lower normal range given by the manufacturer of the Multiplate® device; so it can be hypothesized
that surgery per se might slightly reduce platelet function.
However, the present study was not designed to answer
this question.
In contrast to Born aggregometry, the platelet count of
samples for impedance aggregometry is not adjusted to a
certain value [22]. Instead, whole blood samples are subjected to impedance aggregometry without normalization
of platelet count. Recently, impedance aggregometry has

been demonstrated to be affected by severe thrombocytopenia. However, correlation of platelet count with impedance aggregometry findings was low and it was
suggested that the method reflects over-all aggregability
of platelets [33]. Our results are in agreement with this
study: the correlation between platelet count and impedance aggregometry was low and the striking differences
in the predictive value of the activators suggest that the
method indeed determines the aggregability of a sample
and not simply the platelet count. Moreover, this point of
view is supported by the results of the multivariate
analyses showing that platelet aggregation findings using
collagen as the activator is the best and an independent
predictor of outcome.
Platelets have functions in sepsis which are beyond
hemostasis and are related to immunologic functions.
Platelets have been shown to have phagocytic-like functions and can engulf bacteria, viruses and foreign bodies
and may participate in immune defense [7]. Moreover, it
has been suggested that bacteria can hook on and ride
on platelets to a vessel injury when the platelet surface
is modified by bacterial neuraminidase [3,34]. To

counteract this harmful mechanism, the Ashwell-Morell
receptor has evolved, which eliminates these modified
platelets in the liver [35]. In addition, platelets have
been demonstrated to glom to neutrophils, when activated by blood stream infection via TLRs. As a result,
neutrophils release webs of DNA, so-called neutrophil
extracellular traps [36]. Taken together, the above
mechanisms demonstrate the tight involvement of platelets in the defense of pathogens.
In recent attempts, platelet function inhibition in
experimental sepsis has been demonstrated to exert beneficial effects [37]. Moreover, acetylsalicylic acid treated
patients have recently been shown to have a better prognosis in sepsis in an observational study [38]. The
reduced aggregability of patients with severe sepsis,
especially with poor prognosis, suggests that platelet
inhibition might be performed at a calculated risk. In
this regard, impedance aggregometry might serve not
only as a monitoring tool for the estimation of sepsis
severity, but might guide an eventual antiplatelet and
eventual immune modulatory therapy.
The present study has limitations. Although platelet
function was obtained in 130 patients, the sample size of
80 patients with severe sepsis, 20 of whom died, was limited. Moreover, specifity of the impedance aggregometry
as a biomarker has to be verified with different control
groups. Furthermore, it is important to state that the cutoff value used for Kaplan-Meier analysis and determination of odds ratios in the present study is identical to the
median of the sepsis patients in the same cohort. It is
thus necessary to determine the validity of the cut-off in
further studies. Thus, the present study might present a
first framework for further studies on impedance aggregometry in patients with severe sepsis.
Conclusions
The results of the present study demonstrate that platelet aggregation in whole blood samples, determined on

the first day of admission on the intensive care unit,
might serve as a new and reliable biomarker for the
diagnosis and the outcome of severe sepsis. The early
changes in platelet aggregation at the first day of severe
sepsis suggest an important pathophysiological role of
platelets in severe sepsis.
Key messages
• Platelet aggregation, as determined by impedance
aggregometry at Day 1, is markedly lower in patients
with severe sepsis than in postoperative patients.
• Platelet aggregation in non-survivors of severe sepsis is lower than in survivors.
• Impedance aggregometry is a better biomarker for
the diagnosis and prognosis of severe sepsis than
conventional biomarkers and platelet count.
