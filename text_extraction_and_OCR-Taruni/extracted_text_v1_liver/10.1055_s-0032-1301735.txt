Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a functional form of acute
kidney injury (AKI) that develops in patients with advanced
cirrhosis or fulminant hepatic failure. It is the cause of
deterioration of kidney function in only a fraction of all AKI
cases diagnosed in cirrhotic patients. Yet, because of its
unique pathophysiology and the availability of novel therapeutic interventions, HRS has gained wide attention. The
hallmark of HRS is intense renal vasoconstriction that starts
early in patients with liver disease, even before renal dysfunction is clinically evident. Studies have demonstrated that
patients with baseline Doppler ultrasound changes consistent
with renal vasoconstriction are more likely to develop HRS
during subsequent follow-up.1,2 Etiology of the renal vasoconstriction is much more complex than previously thought.
Traditionally, renal vasoconstriction was blamed solely on
arterial vasodilatation,3 but recent findings demonstrated
that progressive deterioration in cardiac function is partly
responsible for HRS development. HRS is divided into two
types. Type 2 HRS represents the most advanced stage of
hemodynamic dysfunction that develops in cirrhotic patients
and is characterized by progressive decline in kidney function
over weeks and sometimes months. In type 1 HRS there is
sudden deterioration of kidney function that usually follows a
precipitating event. Type 1 HRS can therefore occur in stable
cirrhotic patients or in those with type 2 HRS. Over the last
decade our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in HRS has greatly improved. Pharmacological
and nonpharmacological interventions are being utilized as a
bridge to transplantation and have improved the short-term
survival of HRS patients. Nevertheless, without liver transplantation long-term patient survival remains dismal. This
review summarizes our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria,
and treatment of HRS.
Pathophysiology
HRS compromises the most advanced stage of hemodynamic
dysfunction that starts early in the course of liver disease
even before ascites is clinically detectable. These hemodynamic changes continue to progress as cirrhotic patients
progress from the preascitic stage to diuretic-sensitive then
diuretic-resistant ascites and finally HRS. These hemodynamic changes are characterized by (1) splanchnic vasodilatation,

Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Although not the
primary etiology of AKI in cirrhotic patients, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a unique
form of AKI that develops only in cirrhotic patients. Intense renal vasoconstriction is the
hallmark of HRS. Different mechanisms contribute to renal vasoconstriction, with
splanchnic vasodilatation and reduced effective blood volume playing a central role.
Diagnostic criteria for HRS have been developed and were recently modified, but
diagnosing HRS and differentiating it from other causes of AKI in cirrhotic patients
continues to be a difficult task in some patients. Given its overall dismal prognosis,
strategies to prevent HRS have been developed and proved to be effective in reducing
HRS prevalence among cirrhotic patients. Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment, but more than one treatment modality can be utilized as a bridge to transplantation. This review provides an update on our current understanding of HRS with emphasis
on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved, difficulties in diagnosis,
and different treatment modalities.

(2) reduced effective arterial blood volume, (3) hyperdynamic
circulation with increased cardiac output (CO), (4) reduced
systemic vascular resistance, (5) vasoconstriction of various
extrasplanchnic vascular beds including the renal and cerebral
circulations, (6) increased activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS), the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS), and nonosmotic release of vasopressin. ►Figure 1 schematically summarizes the progression of these hemodynamic
changes from the preascitic stage to type 2 HRS. In type 1 HRS
similar pathophysiological changes occur, albeit at a faster pace
than in type 2 HRS.
Arterial Vasodilatation
The key pathophysiological change responsible for the development of type 2 HRS in cirrhotic patients is arterial vasodilatation. Arterial vasodilatation occurs primarily in the
splanchnic circulation and is mediated by the release of
potent vasodilators, the most important of which is nitric
oxide (NO).4 NO production is increased in the splanchnic
circulation in cirrhotic patients due to shear-stress-induced
upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity as
well as endotoxin-mediated eNOS activation.5,6 Increased
inducible NOS (iNOS) activity has also been documented.7
Other vasodilator substances such as calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP), substance P, carbon monoxide, endocannabinoids, and adrenomedullin might also be involved in the
splanchnic vasodilatation.8–12 Bacterial translocation plays a
central role in splanchnic vasodilatation in decompensated
cirrhosis, and the circulating level of bacterial DNA (a marker
of bacterial translocation) is associated with lower systemic
vascular resistance in cirrhotic patients compared with patients who do not have increased expression of this marker.13
Intense vascular neoformation in the liver and in the splanchnic circulation also develops due to the presence of high levels
of proangiogenic substances such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), which are also involved in the formation of an
extensive network of portosystemic collaterals.14,15 The end
result is a reduction in systemic vascular resistance and a
decrease in effective blood volume despite overall increase in
total plasma and blood volumes. Indeed, studies that included
large numbers of cirrhotic patients who underwent invasive
hemodynamic monitoring confirmed the presence of low
systemic vascular resistance and reduced effective circulating
blood volume in cirrhotic patients.16 There is also evidence of
altered blood volume distribution in cirrhotic patients with
increased blood pooling in the splanchnic region supporting
the role of splanchnic vasodilatation in reducing effective
circulating blood volume.17 Reduced effective blood volume
activates the RAAS, unloads the high-pressure baroreceptors
in the carotid body and aortic arch with subsequent activation
of the SNS, and induces nonosmotic release of vasopressin.
These changes lead to intense renal vasoconstriction and
reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Other vascular
beds show similar changes, and studies have demonstrated
vasoconstriction in the cerebral, femoral, and upper extremities circulations that correlated with reduced renal blood flow
in HRS patients.18–20 With worsening of the liver disease and
progression of cirrhosis, further splanchnic vasodilatation
occurs, creating a vicious cycle that favors further activation
of the RAAS, SNS, and vasopressin release, and subsequent
intensification of renal vasoconstriction.4 Indeed, HRS patients exhibit higher levels of circulating renin, aldosterone,
norepinephrine, and other neurohormonal mediators compared with cirrhotic patients with normal kidney function.
Despite the presence of high circulating levels of vasoconstrictor substances, the abundance of vasodilators in the
splanchnic circulation precipitates a state of hyporesponsiveness in this vascular bed to the vasoconstrictive action of
these mediators.21 ►Table 1 summarizes the changes in the
splanchnic and systemic circulations occurring in HRS
patients.
Renal Prostaglandins
In the kidney, renal vasoconstriction is counterbalanced by
increased intrarenal production of vasodilating prostaglandins. Indeed, patients with liver disease and ascites exhibit
increased renal vasodilating prostaglandins production as
evidenced by increased urinary excretion of these substances
compared with normal controls.22,23 In HRS, both urinary
prostaglandin excretion and renal medullary cyclooxygenase
activity are reduced, a finding that is not present in patients
with other causes of AKI, indicating a role of reduced renal
prostaglandin production in the development of HRS.22 Factors associated with lower renal prostaglandin production in
HRS are unknown, but reduced renal blood flow from intense
renal vasoconstriction may be the cause.23 It is important to
mention that the administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors
to ascitic cirrhotic patients precipitates a syndrome similar to
HRS; therefore, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDS) should be strictly avoided in these patients.24
Role of Sympathetic Nervous System
Both human and animal studies demonstrate increased renal
SNS activity which contributes to the renal vasoconstriction
occurring in HRS. For example, Kostreva et al showed increased renal SNS activity following vena cava ligation in
anesthetized dogs that was abolished only after severing the

hepatic nerves.25 In humans, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion was associated with improvement in renal blood flow and reduction of SNS activity
that subsequently reversed following TIPS occlusion.26,27
Finally, lumbar sympathectomy increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in five patients with HRS, suggesting that
increased renal sympathetic activity is implicated in HRS
development.28 These studies suggest the presence of a
hepatorenal reflex that contributes to renal vasoconstriction
in HRS.
Myocardial Dysfunction
Hyperdynamic circulation with increased CO and heart rate is
a characteristic feature of the hemodynamic changes occurring in cirrhotic patients.29 Both increased SNS activity and
reduced effective blood volume are responsible for this hyperdynamic state, which may not be apparent in the early stages
of cirrhosis or may be evident only in the supine position.30,31
With the progression of liver disease, there is close association between the severity of cirrhosis and the degree of
hyperdynamic circulation. Multiple lines of evidence, however, indicate that a relative decline in CO develops prior to HRS
diagnosis and contributes to renal hypoperfusion and renal
vasoconstriction in HRS patients. For example, low baseline
CO at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
diagnosis correlated with subsequent development of
HRS.32 After the resolution of infection, CO further declined
in those in the HRS group.32 Ruiz-del-Arbol studied the
systemic and hepatic hemodynamics of 66 patients with
cirrhosis and tense ascites who had normal serum creatinine
at baseline, with repeat measurements in 27 patients who
subsequently developed HRS. At baseline, arterial blood
pressure (BP) and CO were significantly lower and RAAS
and SNS activity were significantly higher in the group that
later developed HRS with further reduction in CO at the onset
of renal dysfunction.33 In another study that included 24
patients with cirrhosis and ascites, cardiac index below 1.5 L/
min/m2 was associated with lower GFR and increased risk of
subsequent type 1 HRS development compared with those
with higher cardiac indices.34 Although these studies do not
establish causality, they do suggest that low CO and HRS are
interrelated. It is noteworthy to mention that impaired
cardiac function, which is now termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, is also responsible for the acute heart failure that
manifests following TIPS insertion and the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation.35,36 Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is characterized by
blunted systolic and diastolic contractile responses to stress
in conjunction with evidence of ventricular hypertrophy or
chamber dilatation.37,38 The end result is reduced renal
perfusion and renal vasoconstriction following development
of infections and other stressful conditions that lead to HRS.
A detailed discussion of the etiologies of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is outside the scope of this review, but factors
involved in impaired cardiac function may include (1) myocardial growth and fibrosis due to neurohumoral activation;
(2) diminished myocardial β-adrenergic receptor signal
transduction from chronic SNS activation; and (3) an inhibitory effect of circulating cytokines, including tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and NO, on ventricular function.39–41 In
alcoholic patients, a variable degree of alcoholic cardiomyopathy may also be a contributing factor.
Adrenal Insufficiency
Two studies examined the role of adrenal dysfunction in HRS,
especially in the intensive care setting.42,43 In the first study,
adrenal insufficiency was detected in 80% of patients with
HRS, but only in 34% with a serum creatinine below 1.5 mg/
dL.42 Because normal adrenal function is essential for an
adequate response of the arterial circulation to endogenous
vasoconstrictors, adrenal insufficiency could be an important
contributory mechanism of circulatory dysfunction associated with HRS, especially in patients with severe bacterial
infections. Other features associated with adrenal insufficiency were severe liver failure, arterial hypotension, vasopressor
dependency, and increased hospital mortality.42 The second
study showed that treatment with hydrocortisone in cirrhotic
patients with severe sepsis and adrenal insufficiency is
associated with a rapid improvement in systemic hemodynamics, a reduction of vasopressor requirements, and a lower
hospital mortality.43 The mechanisms of adrenal dysfunction
in cirrhosis with severe sepsis have not been explored, but a
reduction in adrenal blood flow secondary to regional vasoconstriction is a possible mechanism.
Abnormal Renal Autoregulation and Precipitating
Factors
Under normal conditions, effective renal autoregulation
maintains constant renal blood flow despite wide fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. In cirrhotic patients, the
relationship between renal blood flow and perfusion pressure is altered due to the activation of the SNS and other
vasoconstrictor stimuli with rightward deviation of the renal
autoregulatory curve. Thus renal blood flow becomes increasingly dependent on the arterial blood pressure with the
progression of liver disease (►Figs. 2 and 3).44 Therefore,
in patients with advanced cirrhosis, events that lead to the

slightest change in perfusion pressure will translate into
major drops in renal blood flow that might precipitate
intense renal vasoconstriction and HRS. Identifiable precipitating events include intravascular volume depletion
from aggressive diuretic use or following large-volume
paracentesis without albumin infusion, also known as
postparacentesis syndrome. The incidence of postparacentesis syndrome is very low when the volume of ascites
removed is less than 5 L, but it progressively increases to
involve up to 70% of cases when the amount of fluid
removed is above this limit.45,46 Probably the most important precipitating event is bacterial infections, especially
SBP. Twenty to 30% of patients with SBP develop HRS
despite appropriate treatment and resolution of infection.47,48 SBP patients with preexisting hyponatremia or
elevated serum creatinine or those with high plasma or
ascitic fluid cytokine levels at the time of SBP diagnosis are
predisposed to HRS.23,47 The reason why SBP is associated
with high risk of HRS is related to the role of the inflammatory response to SBP in HRS development.23,47 Another
possible explanation is the development of septic cardiomyopathy with secondary deterioration in renal function.33 Urinary tract infections can also precipitate HRS
in 15% of cases but HRS is uncommon following other
infections such as cellulitis and pneumonia.49,50 Twentyfive percent of patients presenting with acute alcoholic
hepatitis eventually develop HRS.51,52 Although AKI following gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs more frequently in cirrhotic patients compared with those
without liver disease (8% vs 1%, p < 0.05), AKI develops
almost exclusively in patients with hypovolemic shock and
responds to fluid resuscitation making prerenal failure a
more plausible diagnosis.53 As previously mentioned,
NSAIDs do precipitate HRS by blocking vasodilating prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys.54
Epidemiology
The prevalence of HRS has declined over the last 2 decades,
probably reflecting better management of cirrhotic patients
and the wide use of prophylactic antibiotics for SBP prevention. For example, Ginès et al51 had previously estimated the
1- and 5-year probability of HRS at 18% and 39%, respectively.
However, a recent study that included 263 cirrhotic patients
followed for 41  3 months from their first episode of ascites
showed much lower risk of HRS development with a prevalence of type 1 and type 2 HRS of 2.6% and 5%, respectively.55
In this study, the cumulative 5-year probability of HRS
development was only 11.4%.55 The prevalence of HRS increases with progression of liver disease. In early stages of

cirrhosis, HRS is unlikely, and other causes of AKI should be
looked for whenever deterioration of kidney function develops. Yet, in patients with advanced liver disease waiting for
liver transplantation the prevalence of HRS is as high as 48%.56
Almost 50% of cirrhotic patients with ascites will develop
AKI during the course of their illness.57 HRS, however, constitutes a small fraction of all AKI cases that develop in
cirrhotic patients. In one study, HRS was responsible for the
deterioration of kidney function in only 7.6% of all 129
cirrhotic patients with ascites and AKI.57 In another multicenter retrospective study that included 423 patients with
cirrhosis and AKI, the most common cause of AKI was either
acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (35%) or prerenal failure (32%),
whereas type 1 and type 2 HRS were the cause of AKI in 20%
and 6.6% of cases, respectively.58
HRS Definition and Diagnostic Criteria
The criteria to diagnose HRS were initially developed in
1996 and were recently updated by the International Ascites Club (IAC) in 2007.59,60 Type 1 HRS is defined as doubling
of the serum creatinine to a level greater than 2.5 mg/dL in
less than 2 weeks’ duration, whereas in type 2 HRS there is a
gradual rise in serum creatinine to greater than 1.5 mg/dL. It
is important to think of the two types of HRS as two different
clinical entities rather than stages of progression of the
same disease. Type 1 HRS is more acute, is more commonly
associated with multiorgan failure, has a very grim prognosis, and overlaps with other causes of AKI. A precipitating
event is identified in 70 to 100% of type 1 HRS patients, and
more than one event can occur in a single patient.61–64 Type
2 HRS can be considered the genuine form of renal failure in
cirrhotic patients. It represents the extreme expression of
cirrhosis-induced circulatory failure and is heralded by
refractory ascites. Renal failure in type 2 HRS is slowly
progressive and parallels the degree of deterioration in liver
function. The median survival for patients with type 2 HRS
is 6 months, whereas the survival for patients with type 1
HRS is only 10% at 90 days from diagnosis.65 ►Table 2
highlights the major differences between type 1 and type
2 HRS.
The new IAC criteria for HRS diagnosis are summarized
in ►Table 3. The main points of difference between the old
and new criteria for HRS are as follows:
1. Creatinine clearance is no longer incorporated in the
diagnosis.
2. Ongoing bacterial infection does not exclude the diagnosis
of HRS, provided septic shock is not present.
3. Albumin is preferred to saline for plasma volume
expansion.
4. Nonessential minor diagnostic criteria including low frac
tional excretion of sodium and oliguria have been omitted.
The IAC criteria, however, have been recently challenged for
multiple reasons. First, these criteria cannot establish HRS
diagnosis in anuric patients, and they cannot identify HRS
superimposed on organic renal disease, which limits their
clinical applicability.66 A recent multicenter study examined
the applicability of these diagnostic criteria in daily clinical
practice. Of the 116 patients diagnosed with HRS only 64%
met all diagnostic criteria as outlined by the IAC, whereas the
remaining 36% with acute deterioration of serum creatinine
to above 1.5 mg/dL could not meet one or more of the
diagnostic criteria due to anuria, hematuria, or proteinuria.67
Some of these urinary abnormalities were attributed to
bladder catheterization or previous nephropathies.67 Second,
in the case of type 2 HRS, these criteria overlap with the
definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is defined as
low GFR < 60 mL/min for more than 3 months’ duration.
Therefore patients with type 2 HRS with a progressive rise
in serum creatinine over 3 months or more can be misclassified as having CKD despite the absence of other CKD features
such as proteinuria or hematuria. Lastly and probably most
importantly, there is discrepancy between the IAC diagnostic
criteria and the current AKI diagnostic classifications. For
example, The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) defines
AKI in the general population as an absolute increase in serum
creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL within a 48-hour period and/or urine
output below 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.68 Cirrhotic patients
who develop AKI and HRS with a rise in serum creatinine by
more than 0.3 mg/dL in less than a 48-hour period whose
creatinine does not exceed 1.5 mg/dL cannot be labeled as
having HRS according to the IAC criteria. This scenario is
common in patients with a low baseline serum creatinine
from low muscle mass, which is common in cirrhotic patients.
This may delay access to timely HRS treatment and may
therefore adversely affect these patients’ prognosis, especially
that two studies have already correlated the AKI staging
system with the in-hospital mortality in cirrhotic patients.69–71 A working party proposal suggested defining
AKI in cirrhotic patients as a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3
mg/dL or more within a 48-hour period or an absolute 50%
rise in serum creatinine.66 Once AKI is diagnosed, all efforts
should be made to differentiate organic AKI from functional
HRS. The same group did not feel that the urine output criteria

are applicable to cirrhotic patients.66 Overall, the current
available criteria for HRS diagnosis still need modification
to align HRS diagnosis with the current AKI staging system
and to clearly separate type 2 HRS from CKD.
HRS Diagnosis
There is no test or investigation that is specific for the diagnosis
of HRS. Therefore the diagnosis is mainly based on the exclusion of other causes of AKI, unresponsiveness to volume
expansion and meeting the diagnostic criteria for HRS outlined
earlier. As mentioned, type 2 HRS can be confused with CKD;
however, the presence of diuretic-resistant ascites and the lack
of other radiological and laboratory features of CKD (eg,
proteinuria or renal cortical thinning) can differentiate between the two conditions. The main differential diagnosis of
type 1 HRSis ATN because both conditions are characterized by
an acute onset and rapid progressive deterioration of kidney
function. ATN may also develop following infectious complications, which are known to precipitate HRS. Traditional
markers to differentiate ATN from HRS such as the presence
of granular urinary casts, low fractional excretion of sodium, or
elevated blood urea nitrogen are insensitive to differentiate
between type 1 HRS and ATN.59,72 In one study that included
44 cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction who underwent
kidney biopsy as part of liver transplant evaluation, low
fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa < 1) was present in 92%
of cases despite biopsy evidence of ATN or glomerulonephritis.73 Multiple urinary biomarkers including interleukin-18
(IL-18), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL),
and others are currently under investigation to differentiate
between type 1 HRS and ATN. Despite these difficulties,
pinpointing the etiology of AKI in cirrhotic patients is important for both prognostic and therapeutic purposes.
Natural History and Prognosis
HRS is a functional renal failure without significant histological changes and therefore is potentially reversible. Indeed
kidney function recovers following liver transplantation or
when kidneys from HRS patients are transplanted in healthy
subjects.74,75 However, prolonged renal vasoconstriction may
precipitate irreversible renal damage, which might explain
why only two thirds of HRS cases recover kidney function
following liver transplantation.76–79 HRS carries a grim prognosis. Ginès and others have previously reported a 2-week
mortality rate as high as 80% in untreated type 1 HRS patients
with only 10% of patients surviving for 3 months.51,60 Prognosis of type 2 HRS patients is slightly better, with a median
survival of 6 months.65 In recent years, however, there is a
trend toward a slight improvement in HRS prognosis. For
example, in a multicenter study by Salerno et al that included
116 HRS patients, some of them did receive vasoconstrictor
therapy, and the 3-month survival was 20% and 40% for type 1
and type 2 HRS, respectively.67 Another study showed a 38%
1-year survival for type 2 HRS patients and a mean survival of
only 7 days for type 1 HRS.55 ►Figures 4A, B outlines the
historical and most recent survival rates for patients with
type 1 and type 2 HRS.
It is noteworthy to mention that HRS carries the worst
survival among all causes of AKI in cirrhotic patients as
demonstrated in a study that included 562 cirrhotic patients
with AKI.44 In this study, 3-month survival for HRS patients
was 15% compared with 31% for patients with infectioninduced AKI, 46% for hypovolemia-induced AKI, and 73% for
AKI associated with evidence of parenchymal renal disease
[eg, proteinuria or hematuria (P < 0.0005)]. Therefore, determining the etiology of AKI in cirrhotic patients does not only
determine the treatment plan but also foretells the prognosis
in these patients.
Treatment
Prevention
Due to its overall poor prognosis, HRS is better prevented than
treated, and preventive measures have been beneficial in
some clinical scenarios. For example, following large-volume
paracentesis ( 5 L), albumin is superior to other plasma
expanders in preventing postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and renal impairment.45,80 In a double-blind,

separate time periods. (A) Survival of an historical cohort of 56 patients
who were diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) prior to 1995.
(B) Survival of a recent cohort of 116 patients who either developed
type 1 (solid line) or type 2 (dotted line) HRS between April 2007 and

controlled study pentoxyfylline use for 28 days in patients
with alcoholic hepatitis was associated with lower risk of HRS
development and lower mortality.52 The mechanism of the
protective effect of pentoxyfylline is believed to be related to
its anti-TNF activity.52 Prophylactic antibiotics prevent bacterial translocation and suppress proinflammatory cytokine
formation implicated in the pathogenesis of HRS.81,82 It is not
therefore surprising that prophylactic antibiotic use in patients at risk of SBP was effective in reducing both SBP and
HRS risks. In one study, daily norfloxacin was associated with
lower 1-year SBP probability (7% compared with 61%, P <
0.001) and lower 1-year HRS probability (28% compared with
41%, p ¼ 0.02).83 Once SBP has developed, treatment with
intravenous albumin (1.5 g/kg of body weight at diagnosis
followed by 1 g/kg 48 hours later) in addition to ceftriaxone
reduced the incidence of HRS to 10%, compared with 33% in
those who received ceftriaxone alone (p ¼ 0.002).48 Hospital
mortality (10% vs 29%) and 3-month mortality rates (22% vs
41%) were also lower in patients receiving albumin and an
antibiotic compared with those who received an antibiotic
alone.48 The mechanisms by which albumin prevents HRS are
incompletely understood but may be related to albumin's
positive effect on circulatory function and its antioxidant
properties.82–84
General Management of HRS Patients
Type 1 HRS patients need to be managed in an intensive care
unit because these patients have multiorgan failure and they
rapidly deteriorate. Type 2 HRS patients can be managed on
an outpatient basis or in a non–intensive care setting. In
either case, diuretic treatment should be stopped and ascites
should be managed with paracentesis. Large-volume paracentesis (more than 5 L) should be followed by 8 g of albumin
infusion for each liter of ascitic fluid removed. There is
enough evidence to recommend early paracentesis to exclude
the adverse effects of increased intraabdominal pressure
(IAP) on renal hemodynamics. For example, Cade et al reported a significant increase in urine flow rate and creatinine
clearance following reduction in IAP from 22 to 10 mm Hg
following paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.85 Umgelter and colleagues studied 12 patients with
established HRS and showed improvement in GFR and urine
output and Doppler ultrasound evidence of reduction in renal
resistive indices following paracentesis.86 In another study,
paracentesis with albumin infusion but not albumin infusion
alone improved creatinine clearance and fractional excretion
of sodium in 19 HRS patients.87 In type 1 HRS patients,
assessing the intravascular volume status using central venous access or, preferably, global end-diastolic volume index
(GEDVI) is essential to guide fluid resuscitation and albumin
infusion.87 In accordance with the IAC criteria and due to its
established beneficial effects in cirrhotic patients, albumin
infusion should be aggressively used prior to labeling patients
as having HRS.59,88,89 Synthetic plasma expanders are less
effective than albumin and are not recommended.89 Precipitating or aggravating factors such as SBP or adrenal insufficiency should be diagnosed and aggressively treated. Many of
these patients are bed bound and decondition rapidly; therefore early ambulation, rehabilitation, and adequate nutrition
should be thought of early and adequately planned for.
Assessment for liver transplantation should start as soon
as possible. In type 1 patients not candidates for liver
transplantation realistic expectations should be set and
aggressive treatment modalities should be avoided. Pharmacological treatment and other interventions can be offered to
selected type 2 HRS patients not suitable for liver transplantation on a case by case basis. In many cases, transplant
candidacy is unclear. In these patients all therapeutic options
should be attempted until suitability for liver transplantation
becomes clearer. The ideal goals of treatment for HRS are to
prolong survival until a liver transplant becomes available
and to optimize conditions for successful liver
transplantation.
Vasoconstrictor Therapy
Intravenous terlipressin and albumin infusion constitute the
treatment of choice for HRS patients in Europe. However,
terlipressin has not yet been approved for the treatment of
HRS in the United States and Canada. Terlipressin is a longacting synthetic vasopressin analogue composed of one molecule of lysine vasopressin and three glycine residues. It
exerts its vasoconstrictive action through binding to the
vasopressin (V1) receptor, which is preferentially expressed
on the vascular smooth muscle cells within the splanchnic
circulation. It is metabolized through exopeptidases to release small amounts of lysine vasopressin over a sustained
period, allowing it to be administered by bolus injection
rather than by continuous infusion.90 Yet continuous infusion
of terlipressin is associated with a higher HRS reversal rate
compared with bolus injections.91 Multiple studies have
demonstrated improvement in clinical parameters (including
arterial blood pressure, urine output, and hyponatremia) and
amelioration in the neurohormonal abnormalities in 50 to
70% of HRS patients following terlipressin and albumin
infusions.58,62,92–95 Even in patients with cirrhosis and ascites
but not HRS, terlipressin infusion has been associated with
improvement in renal function and increased natriuresis.
Renal blood flow also improved following terlipressin infusion in 19 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension as
evidenced by reduction in renal arterial resistive index.96 The
median time to HRS reversal is 7 days with faster recovery in
patients with lower serum creatinine at presentation. Other
factors that predict favorable response to terlipressin include
lower serum bilirubin level (< 171 µmol/L) and more than 5
mm Hg increase in mean arterial blood pressure following
terlipressin initiation.97 Terlipressin has an acceptable side
effects profile, with ischemic events occurring in 5 to 30% of
cases, but most studies have excluded patients at high risk of
ischemic events. Following completion of therapy, HRS recurred in up to 50% of cases.58,62,92–95 Factors associated with
HRS recurrence are unknown, but renal function responds to
the reintroduction of terlipressin.62 The benefits of terlipressin also seem to extend to type 2 HRS, with a slightly better
response rate and longer survival than in type 1.92,94,98 All
studies used terlipressin until serum creatinine decreased to
less than 1.5 mg/dL or for a maximum of 15 days; therefore, it

is unclear if longer duration of therapy will be of any benefit
in increasing the HRS reversal rate.
The beneficial effects of albumin infusion on HRS reversal
are well established.99,100 Because the majority of previously
published studies concerning terlipressin use in HRS included
both terlipressin and albumin infusions, it was unclear if HRS
reversal was related to terlipressin or related to the albumin
infusion. Two recent prospective, randomized studies evaluated the effect of terlipressin and albumin infusions versus
albumin alone in type 1 HRS patients. The first of these
studies was a double-blinded, multicenter study conducted
in the United States and included 112 patients with type 1
HRS randomized in 1:1 fashion to either terlipressin plus
albumin or placebo plus albumin. Reversal of HRS (as defined
by a serum creatinine of  1.5 mg/dL on two separate occasions 48 hours apart) occurred in 34% of cases in the terlipressin arm compared with 13% in the placebo arm (p ¼
0.008).101 The most important predictor of HRS reversal was a
low serum creatinine at initiation of therapy. In fact, none of
the HRS cases with a serum creatinine  5.6 mg/dL responded
to terlipressin.101 Importantly, HRS reversal was associated
with improved 90-day patient survival (p ¼ 0.025), but no
survival benefit was demonstrated 180 days from terlipressin
(p ¼ 0.07).101 The second study was an open-label study
conducted in Spain and included 46 patients with either
type 1 or type 2 HRS randomized to receive either terlipressin
and albumin or albumin alone.98 There was a significant
difference in favor of terlipressin in the likelihood of HRS
reversal (44% in the study group vs 8.7% in the control group,
p ¼ 0.017), but 3-month survival was not different between
those who did or did not receive terlipressin (27% in the
terlipressin arm vs 19% in the albumin arm, p ¼ 0.7).98 Again,
a lower baseline serum creatinine at initiation of therapy
predicted a favorable response to terlipressin, suggesting that
earlier initiation of therapy might confer the best probability
of improvement in kidney function. Other predictors of
favorable response to terlipressin include young age and a
Child-Pugh score of less than 13.58,62
From these two studies, terlipressin appears to have an
independent beneficial effect on HRS reversal. However,
neither study confirmed a survival advantage of terlipressin
use even in patients who responded to therapy with the
exception of improved 90-day (short-term) survival in the
study by Sanyal et al.101 A recent meta-analysis confirmed
that terlipressin and albumin infusions are associated with
improvement in short-term (90-day) survival.102
Midodrine and norepinephrine are two α1-adrenergic
receptor agonists that are readily available and have been
shown to be effective in the treatment of HRS. Continuous
norepinephrine infusion in association with albumin and
furosemide has been shown to be beneficial in reversing
HRS.103 In a study that included 12 type 1 HRS patients,
norepinephrine dose was titrated to achieve 10 mm Hg
increase in mean blood pressure and/or increase in urine
output by > 200 mL every 4 hours. Norepinephrine was
infused either until serum creatinine decreased to less than
1.5 mg/dL or for a maximum of 15 days. The mean norepinephrine dose was 0.8 mg/h for a mean duration of 10 days.
Ten of the 12 patients (83%) achieved HRS reversal; two of
these had previously failed terlipressin therapy. Ischemic
events were observed in two patients (17%).103 Improvement
of kidney function was associated with improvement in
patient survival, and four of the responders did not require
liver transplantation 6 to 18 months after recovery of renal
function.103
Midodrine is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver into
an active metabolite, desglymidodrine, which is later eliminated in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of midodrine and
desglymidodrine in HRS patients have not been studied.
When given as monotherapy, oral midodrine slightly improved systemic hemodynamics but failed to improve renal
function in patients with HRS or with refractory ascites.104–
106 When combined, however, with the glucagon inhibitor
octreotide (glucagon mediates splanchnic vasodilatation) and
in combination with albumin infusion, improvement in renal
function, mean arterial pressure, and plasma renin activity
was observed. Unfortunately, there are no randomized trials
that evaluate the effect of midodrine and octreotide on HRS
reversal, but two nonrandomized studies that included 19
type 1 HRS patients demonstrated reversal of HRS in 70 to
100% of cases treated with this protocol.63,107 Doses of
midodrine and octreotide varied between these two studies,
and in one study the octreotide dose was titrated according to
the central venous pressure measurement.107 In both studies
no significant treatment-related side effects were reported,
and therapy was well tolerated.63 In the largest study to date
that included 162 HRS patients, 75 patients received octreotide, midodrine, and albumin, and outcomes were compared
with a historical cohort of 87 patients who did not receive any
therapy. Octreotide, midodrine, and albumin were associated
with improvement in kidney function, survival, and greater
likelihood for liver transplantation compared with the no
treatment arm.108
Effect of Different Vasoconstrictors on HRS Reversal
and Patients’ Survival
Although there are limited head to head studies comparing
terlipressin to other vasoconstrictor agents, studies so far
have not demonstrated an advantage of any vasoconstrictor
agent over the other on HRS reversal. One study suggested
that terlipressin-treated patients have a higher HRS recovery
rate, longer survival, and greater likelihood of receiving a liver
transplant compared with those treated with an octreotide–
midodrine combination, but this study was nonrandomized,
and the results could have been affected by selection bias.109
A meta-analysis has also confirmed that terlipressin and
norepinephrine were equivalent in terms of efficacy and
side effect profile in reversing HRS.110
Apart from the rate of HRS reversal, a recent meta-analysis
has shown no difference between various vasoconstrictors
and patient survival.111 This meta-analysis included 10 trials
comprising 376 patients with either type 1 or type 2 HRS who
received terlipressin alone or with albumin, octreotide plus
albumin, or norepinephrine plus albumin. Mortality was the
primary outcome measure. Overall, vasoconstrictors used
alone or with albumin reduced short-term mortality

compared with no intervention or albumin alone (74% vs 58%,
RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.96). In subgroup analyses, the
survival benefit was apparent at day 15 of therapy (RR: 0.60,
95% CI: 0.37 to 0.97), but not at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.111
Although this seems to be a dismal survival advantage, these
few days of increased life expectancy might be sufficient for
liver transplantation to become available, especially given
that there are emerging reports of more prolonged vasoconstrictor use as a bridge to liver transplantation.112
Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt
The effect of TIPS insertion on improving urinary sodium
excretion and renal function in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites is well documented.26,113,114 Recently, Stadlbauer
and colleagues demonstrated improvement in renal blood
flow following TIPS insertion, which was attributed to leftward shift of the renal blood flow/renal perfusion pressure
curve.44
Two studies evaluated the effect of TIPS insertion in
patients with type 1 HRS and preserved liver function as
evidenced by a Child-Pugh score < 12.115,116 Reversal of HRS
occurred in almost 50% of cases within 3 months from TIPS
insertion.115,116 These clinical changes paralleled amelioration in renal hemodynamics and reduction of the plasma
levels of different mediators of vasoconstriction. Patients’
survival ranged from 10 to 570 days, with 30 days survival
achieved in five patients (71%).115 An important observation
from these two studies is the slow and delayed recovery of
renal function following TIPS (within 2 to 4 weeks), unlike
vasoconstrictor therapy, in which responders have faster
recovery of renal function (1 to 2 weeks). Hepatic encephalopathy was a common complication but was controlled with
medical therapy. Another drawback of TIPS insertion in type 1
HRS patients is the fact that most of these patients have
advanced liver disease with a serum bilirubin level above 5
mg/dL, a known absolute contraindication for TIPS, limiting
the utility of TIPS in this group of patients.117 Nevertheless,
the results of these studies suggest that TIPS insertion is a
reasonable alternative in patients not candidates for vasoconstrictive therapy.
Two pilot studies also assessed the effect of TIPS insertion
on type 2 HRS reversal.116,118 Almost all patients had reversal
of HRS and 70% of the patients were still alive 1 year post-TIPS.
The results of these studies demonstrate that in a selected
group of HRS patients, TIPS insertion might prolong survival
long enough either to receive a liver transplant or, if they are
not candidates, to stay off dialysis. It is noteworthy to mention
that a recent study has demonstrated that TIPS insertion
improves post–liver transplant outcomes, probably through
improving kidney function.119
Combination Therapy
Vasoconstrictor therapy in conjunction with TIPS was evaluated in two studies. The first study included 14 type 1 HRS
patients who received oral midodrine, octreotide, and albumin, followed by TIPS insertion in stable patients who responded to the vasoconstrictor therapy and were at low risk
of hepatic encephalopathy.63 All five patients who received
combination therapy were alive 6 to 30 months following
TIPS, with only one patient requiring liver transplantation
13 months later. On the other hand, responders to vasoconstrictors who did not receive TIPS either died (three
patients) or required a liver transplantation (two patients).
The second study, which included 11 type 2 HRS cases
managed with sequential terlipressin and TIPS, also showed
further improvement of kidney function following TIPS insertion.94 However, due to the small number of cases and the
limited applicability of TIPS in patients with advanced cirrhosis, it is hard to utilize this combination therapy on a large
number of patients.
►Table 4 summarizes the 30- and 90-day survival of
untreated HRS patients and those who received therapy
with different vasoconstrictor agents, TIPS, or a combination
of vasoconstrictor and TIPS. The important observations are
that (1) compared with no treatment, 30-day survival of HRS
did improve with different treatment modalities, and (2) 90-

day survival of HRS remains dismal, irrespective of the
treatment offered.
Renal Replacement Therapy
The indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation
in HRS patients are no different from those with other noncirrhotic patients with AKI and include volume overload,
intractable metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. In one
study the most common reason for RRT initiation in HRS
patients was volume overload.56 However, given the dismal
prognosis of HRS patients, most nephrologists will offer RRT
only to liver transplant candidates or those undergoing liver
transplant evaluation. The decision to initiate RRT in HRS
patients is further complicated by the presence of hepatic
encephalopathy, hypotension, and coagulopathy, which have
been associated with increased risks of hemorrhage and
hypotension and which directly contributed to mortality in
some cases.120,121 However, delaying RRT in HRS patients is
associated with a mortality rate as high as 90%.122 Predictors
of mortality following RRT initiation have been studied in 82
cirrhotic patients with AKI, 26 of them with HRS. In general,
patients with advanced liver disease as evidenced by the
presence of hepatic encephalopathy, malignancy, or thrombocytopenia had a 2.8- to 8.2-fold increased mortality rate.122
Therefore, in HRS patients waiting for a liver transplant, RRT
is justifiable as a bridge to transplantation but is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality compared with
patients with other forms of AKI. In HRS patients who are
not candidates for liver transplantation, initiation of RRT is
controversial and can be offered only to a selected group of
patients who have the potential of recovering kidney function
after a short duration of dialysis.
There is still controversy regarding the best modality of
RRT in orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) candidates. Continuous RRT (CRRT) is better tolerated than intermittent hemodialysis (HD) in HRS patients as evidenced by better
cardiovascular stability, gradual correction of hyponatremia,
and less fluctuation in intracranial pressure.123–126 However,
prospective studies showed that the dialysis modality utilized
in 30 HRS patients waiting for liver transplantation did not
affect their survival.127 Other studies have also shown no
advantage of CRRT over intermittent HD in HRS patients
waiting for liver transplantation.128 A single-center trial
that included 102 liver transplant candidates with AKI requiring RRT (48% of them with HRS) showed higher mortality
with CRRT compared with HD (78% vs 50%, p ¼ 0.02).56 As
expected, cirrhotic patients with AKI who were maintained
on CRRT were much sicker as evidenced by higher APACHE
(acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score and
lower blood pressure and were more likely to be mechanically
ventilated and on vasopressor support.56 Hence, although the
best modality of RRT in HRS is not well defined, OLT candidates in need of RRT can be managed with either HD or CRRT
before transplantation with similar outcomes. The choice of
best modality is dictated by hemodynamic stability and
severity of illness and should be tailored to individual patients. One clear indication for CRRT is in patients with
fulminant hepatic failure and increased intracranial tension
due to the adverse effect of intermittent HD on intracranial
pressure.125 One drawback of CRRT is the need for continuous
systemic anticoagulation, which might increase the risk of
bleeding; however, cirrhotic patients are often coagulopathic,
and anticoagulation may be safely avoided. Other alternatives
include regional citrate or regional heparin/protamine anticoagulation; both have been used in cirrhotic patients and
provided filter lifespan similar to those obtained using systemic anticoagulation.129 However, caution should be exercised with citrate anticoagulation because hepatic citrate
metabolism is impaired in cirrhotic patients increasing the
risk of citrate toxicity.130
The ultimate dialysis dose and timing for RRT initiation
have not been studied in cirrhotic patients with HRS, but data
can be inferred from other studies of AKI in critically ill
patients, which suggests that early RRT initiation and maintenance of negative fluid balance improve patient survival.131,132 Two recent randomized studies that included a large
number of critically ill patients with AKI (many of them with
concomitant liver cell failure) showed no clear benefit of
higher dialysis dose on hospital mortality or the probability
of renal function recovery.133,134 However, other studies
demonstrated an improvement in gas exchange, lower norepinephrine dose, earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation, shorter intensive care unit stay, and better survival in
septic patients with AKI who received early high-dose isovolemic hemofitration (45 mL/kg/h for 6 hours), followed by
conventional CRRT at 20 mL/kg/h, compared with a similar
group of patients who received conventional-dose CRRT.135
Currently, it remains unclear whether critically ill patients
with HRS will benefit from higher RRT dose. A randomized
study specifically addressing this question is needed.
The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS,
Gambro Americas, Lakewood, CO) is an albumin-based
form of RRT that combines a conventional CRRT circuit to
an albumin-enriched dialysate that is then regenerated by
passage through a charcoal and ion exchange cartridge. The
assumption is that, by removing albumin-bound toxins (eg,
bile acids and nitric oxide) and water-soluble cytokines (TNFα and interleukin-6) (both have been implicated in HRS
pathogenesis), liver function will stabilize and end-organ
damage will improve.136–138 Although studies have demonstrated improved survival with MARS compared with conventional CRRT, the overall survival is still low, with 7-day
survival of 37% and 30-day survival of 25%.136,139 Other
albumin-based dialysis techniques include single-pass albumin dialysis, which can be performed using a standard CRRT
circuit and fractionated plasma separation, adsorption, and
dialysis [Fractional Plasma Separation Adsorption and Dialysis system (Prometheus, Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany)].140 MARS is currently approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of drug
overdose but not for HRS, whereas the Prometheus system is
not FDA approved.
Intraoperative complications, including hemodynamic instability and hyperkalemia, are more prevalent in HRS patients undergoing liver transplantation. Townsend et al141
described their experience with intraoperative CRRT in 41

patients at the time of liver transplantation. Indications for
the procedure were preoperative CRRT in almost 50% of the
cases and hyperkalemia, dysnatremia, and metabolic acidosis
in the rest of the group. Despite the presence of elevated
international normalized ratio (INR) in all the patients, filter
circuit clotting occurred in 40% of the cases. However, heparin
or regional citrate anticoagulation was not used except in
three patients for fear of bleeding diathesis. Nevertheless,
CRRT was administered for almost 50% of the operative time,
and filter clotting did not affect the duration of CRRT. This
study demonstrates that intraoperative CRRT is feasible and
useful in providing negative or even intraoperative fluid
balance, despite the large number of blood transfusions in
this cohort.
Liver and Liver-Kidney Transplantation
Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment of HRS patients.
Renal sodium excretion and serum creatinine and neurohormonal levels normalize within 1 month of liver transplantation in the majority of patients.142 Renal artery resistive
indices, however, take up to 1 year to return back to their
normal values.142,143 However, recovery of renal function
following liver transplantation is not universal. For example,
Marik and colleagues studied renal function recovery following successful liver transplantation in 28 HRS patients. Complete recovery of kidney function occurred in only 58% of cases
within 4 to 110 days of OLT, whereas another 15% partially
recovered function.76 Importantly, kidney function never recovered in 25% of cases.76 In another study from China, 30 of 32
(94%) HRS patients recovered kidney function within a median
of 24 days from liver transplant.78 Reasons for lack of recovery
of kidney function can be only speculated due to the limited
number of studies addressing this question, but shorter HRS
duration, younger recipients’ age, and immediate liver allograft
function as evidenced by lower posttransplantation day 7
bilirubin level are factors that favor renal recovery.76 One
important predictor of post–liver transplant dialysis requirement in HRS cases is prolonged RRT for more than 8 weeks
prior to liver transplant.144 Therefore, although there is no
survival advantage of liver-kidney transplantation compared
with liver transplant alone in patients with HRS, liver-kidney
transplantation is recommended in HRS patients who have
been on RRT for 8 weeks or more.144–146 It is important to
mention that unexpected post–liver transplant events such as
primary allograft nonfunction, reoperation, infection, and
hemorrhage are associated with increased risk of AKI in the
immediate post–liver transplant period and can adversely
affect HRS recovery.147
HRS affects post–liver transplant outcomes. HRS patients
have lower post–liver transplant survival and a higher risk of
postoperative complications compared with those without
HRS.148,149 HRS patients who do not recover kidney function
and remain on RRT post–liver transplant have a dismal
prognosis, with a 1-year mortality rate of around 70%.150
Kidney after liver transplantation does provide a survival
advantage compared with staying on RRT.151 Those who
recover kidney function remain at high risk of developing
chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared
with those with normal kidney function at the time of liver
transplant.148,149,152 The effect of successful pre–liver transplant treatment of HRS on post–liver transplant outcomes has
revealed mixed results. In a study by Restuccia and colleagues,
post–liver transplant outcomes were similar between nine
successfully treated HRS patients and 27 matching controls
who did not have HRS.153 Another study, however, showed no
advantage of pre–liver transplant HRS treatment on post–
liver transplant outcomes.79
Our approach has been to provide OLT in the majority of
HRS patients, with the exception of those who have been on
RRT for 8 weeks or more. In cases where the etiology of renal
failure is unclear, or if there are overlapping features of
chronic kidney disease (proteinuria, hematuria, etc.) and
HRS, we rely on histological information to direct the transplant options.73
Conclusions and Future Directions
In summary, HRS is a drastic complication of liver cirrhosis.
Recent reports suggest a trend toward lower prevalence and
improved outcomes of HRS reflecting better understanding of
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the availability of preventive and therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless,
HRS is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and it does adversely affect post–liver transplant outcomes. Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment for
HRS, but vasoconstrictor agents, TIPS, and/or RRT can be
utilized as a bridge to transplantation. The current HRS
classification needs to be revisited to incorporate HRS under
the general umbrella of AKI and to lower the threshold for
HRS diagnosis.
