Abstract
Background: There is no standard serum biomarker used for diagnosis or early detection of recurrence for renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundant and highly stable in blood serum, and have been
recently described as powerful circulating biomarkers in a wide range of solid cancers. Our aim was to identify
miRNA signature that can distinguish the blood serum of RCC patients and matched healthy controls and validate
identified miRNAs as potential biomarkers for RCC.
Methods: In the screening phase of the study, blood serum of 15 RCC patients and 12 matched healthy controls
were analyzed by use of the TaqMan Low-Density Arrays enabling parallel identification of expression levels of 667
miRNAs through qRT-PCR-based approach. In the validation phase, identified miRNAs were further evaluated on
the independent group of 90 RCC patients and 35 matched healthy controls by use of individual qRT-PCR assays
and statistically evaluated.
Results: We identified 30 miRNAs differentially expressed between serum of RCC patients and healthy controls: 19
miRNAs were up-regulated and 11 miRNAs were down-regulated in RCC patients. MiR-378, miR-451 and miR-150
were further evaluated in the independent group of patients, and two of them were successfully validated: levels
of miR-378 were increased (p = 0.0003, AUC = 0.71), miR-451 levels were decreased (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.77) in
serum of RCC patients. Combination of miR-378 and miR-451 enable identification of RCC serum with the
sensitivity of 81%, specificity 83% and AUC = 0.86.
Conclusions: Circulating miRNAs in serum are promising biomarkers in RCC.

Background
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common neoplasm of adult kidney accounting for about 3% of adult
malignancies and having the highest mortality rate at
over 40% [1,2]. Renal tumors are commonly asymptomatic in early stages and although surgical resection
remains the best therapy for RCC, after the curative
nephrectomy, 20-40% patients will develop recurrence.
Unfortunately, there is no standard serum biomarker
used for diagnosis or early detection of recurrence for
RCC patients. Although several serum proteins that
might be useful to detect the presence of advanced or
recurrent RCC have been reported [3], none indicated
analytical sensitivity efficient enough for translation into
standard of care management for RCC patients.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of naturally
occurring, short non-coding, single stranded RNAs, that
regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level
by binding to the untranslated region (3’UTR) of target
mRNAs and causing translational inhibition and/or
mRNA degradation [4]. Specific expression profiles of
miRNAs have been shown in a variety of cancers,
including RCC [4-6]. MiRNAs are highly stable and
abundant in plasma, serum and other body fluids. Moreover, miRNA signatures in blood are similar in men and
women, as well as individuals of different age [7]. These
circulating miRNAs had shown great potential to serve
as a novel biomarker for non-invasive diagnosis and

prognosis of plenty kinds of diseases, such as cancer,
and even physiological conditions such as prenatal
screening. Following the release from cells, circulating
miRNAs originate from (i) microvesicles (released by
exocytosis), (ii) exosomes (formed via invagination of
the early endosome and released upon fusion of late
endosome with plasma membrane), and (iii) apoptotic
vesicles and/or senescent bodies [7-9].
Expression profiles of circulating miRNAs were extensively studied in (i) colorectal cancer (CRC) where
authors found miR-29a and miR-92 plasma levels to differentiate between CRC patients and controls with sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 70% and also to be
associated with clinical stage [10], (ii) in ovarian cancer
where levels of miR-21, miR-92 and miR-93 were higher
in 3 patients with normal CA-125 levels, a clinical biomarker of ovarian cancer [11], (iii) in breast cancer
where it has been described that changes in the level of
total RNA, miR-10b, miR-34a, and miR-155 correlated
with the presence of overt metastases [12], (iv) in prostate cancer where serum miR-141 levels were found to
distinguish metastatic prostate patients from agematched controls [13]. Such studies have clearly proved
the potential of circulating miRNAs in primary diagnostics as well as in follow-up for the early detection of disease progression. In case of RCC the only study was
performed and circulating miR-1233 identified, but the
analytical characteristics of this biomarker in the validation study were not convincing [14]. In our study we
focused on the circulating miRNAs expression profiles
in the serum samples of RCC patients aiming identification of new biomarkers for RCC.
Materials and methods
Study population
We collected serum samples from the group of patients
diagnosed for RCC and undergoing radical nephrectomy
at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (MMCI; Brno,
Czech Republic) between 2003 and 2008, and matched
cancer-free blood donor volunteers recruited from the
same institute with no previous history of any cancer.
All subjects were of the same ethnicity (Caucasian).
Clinical and pathological characteristics including age,
gender, stage, and grade were recorded and they are
summarized in Table 1. RCC serum samples were collected after signing an informed consent prior to surgery
and stored at MMCI Bank of Biological Material. The
study has been approved by the local Ethical Committee
at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (MMCI; Brno,
Czech Republic).
RNA isolation
Total RNA enriched for small RNAs was isolated using
Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany)
from 200 μL serum according to modified manufacturers’ protocol. For each sample, to the 800 μl of QIAzol solution was added 1.25 μl 0.8 μg/μl MS2 RNA
carrier (Roche, cat. No. 10165948001). The extracted
RNA was eluted in 50 μL of preheated Elution Solution,
and concentration and purity of RNA were determined
spectrofotometrically by measuring its optical density
(A260/280 > 2.0; A260/230 > 1.8) using NanoDrop ND1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The samples were either stored at -80°C
or further processed.
TaqMan low density arrays - screening phase
In the screening phase, we performed TaqMan Low
Density Arrays (TLDA) analysis to identify differentially
expressed miRNAs from the two pooled serum samples
(15 ccRCC patients vs. 12 healthy controls). In brief, 35
ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by
the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and
Megaplex RT set pool A and B version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). To obtain sufficient amount of
cDNA for TLDA analysis, pre-amplification step using
TaqMan PreAmp MasterMix was added. The pre-amplified product was loaded into TaqMan Array Human

MicroRNA A + B Cards Set v2.0 (Applied Biosystems,
CA, USA) enabling simultaneous quantitation of 667
human miRNAs. TaqMan MicroRNA Assays and analysis were performed on the ABI 7900HT Instrument
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). All reactions were performed according to the standard manufacturers’ protocols. Quantitative miRNAs expression data were
acquired and normalized by use of ABI 7900HT SDS
software (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
qRT-PCR - Validation phase
In validation phase of the study, candidate miRNAs
identified by TLDA technology were further characterized. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthetised
from total RNA using miRNA-specific primers according to the TaqMan MicroRNA Assay protocol (Applied
Biosystems). For RT reactions 10 ng of RNA sample, 50
nM of stem-loop RT primer, 1 × RT buffer, 0.25 mM
each of dNTPs, 3.33 U μl
-1 MultiScribe reverse transcriptase and 0.25 U μl
-1 RNase inhibitor (all from TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit, Applied
Biosystems) was used. Reaction mixtures (15 μl) were
incubated for 30 min at 16°C, 30 min at 42°C, 5 min at
85°C and then held at 4°C. qRT-PCR was performed
using the Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument. The 20-
μl PCR reaction mixture included 1.33 μl of RT product,
1 × TaqMan (AmpErase UNG) Universal PCR Master
Mix and 1 μl of primer and probe mix of the TaqMan
MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions
were incubated in a 96-well optical plate at 50°C for 2
min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for
15 s and 60°C for 10 min. All reactions were run in
duplicate and average threshold cycle and SD values
were calculated.
Statistical methods
In both phases, analysis of the qRT-PCR data was performed using the SDS 2.0.1 software (Applied Biosystems) (settings: automatic baseline, threshold 0.2).
According to manufacturer’s recommendations, miR-16
has been chosen as reference for normalization of miRNAs expression levels. The relative expression levels of
target miRNAs were determined by the equation 2-ΔCT,
in which ΔCT were calculated as follows: ΔCT = CT miRof-interest - CT miR-16. Relative miRNA levels were then
calculated with the RQ Manager 1.2. Normalized
expression data from screening phase of the study were
statistically evaluated in environment of statistical language R by use of Bioconductor package and LIMMA
approach combined with hierarchical clustering (HCL)
[15]. Normalized expression data in validation phase
were statistically analyzed with MedCalc software version 11.2.1. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Statistical differences between
expression levels in RCC patients’ and healthy controls’
samples were evaluated by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve
(AUC) for serum microRNA levels were determined
using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Results
Screening phase
In this biomarker discovery phase, a strategy for effective identification of RCC-associated miRNAs in serum
was performed using qRT-PCR-based miRNAs expression profiling arrays. We determined the miRNA expression profile of 667 miRNAs in serum from ccRCC
patients (n = 15) using TaqMan Low Density Arrays
technology, and compared to the expression profile of
healthy individuals (n = 12); the miRNA expression
levels were normalized to miR-16, the mean expression
levels were calculated and data analyzed by use of the
microarray biostatistical approaches. We observed 30
miRNAs differentially expressed between serum of
ccRCC patients and healthy controls: 19 miRNAs were
up-regulated in ccRCC patients and 11 miRNAs were
down-regulated (Figure 1, Table 2). Among them, upregulated miR-378 (FC = 37.6, p < 0.000001), and
down-regulated miR-150 (FC = 0.02, p < 0.000001) and
miR-451 (FC = 0.2, p < 0.000001) were proposed as
putative biomarkers to the validation phase of the study,
as significance of the difference (fold change, p-value),
previous observations and biological plausibility (based
on the PubMed hits when particular miRNA is combined with keyword “cancer”), and miRNAs with favorable expression levels (Ct > 30) were taken into account.
Validation phase
To validate the 3 promising biomarkers identified in the
screening phase, miR-378, miR-451 and miR-150, qRTPCR assays were developed to quantify miRNAs in
serum of RCC patients and healthy controls. The qRTPCR was performed in the independent cohort of 90
RCC patients’ and 35 healthy controls’ serum samples.
As the difference in miR-150 expression level between
RCC and healthy controls serum did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.222), miR-150 was excluded from
further analysis. The expression of miR-378 serum level
was significantly increased in patients with RCC compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0003), and the expression level of miR-451 was significantly decreased in
patients with RCC compared to healthy controls (p <
0.0001), confirming the results of screening phase (Figure 2A-B, Table 3). Receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve analysis revealed that the serum levels of
both miR-378 and miR-451 might serve as useful biomarkers for differentiating serum of patients with RCC
from controls with AUC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.79),

and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.84), respectively (Figure 2CD). At the cut-off value of 0.02 for relative expression of
miR-378 normalized to miR-16 levels, the sensitivity was
70% and the specificity was 60%. At the cut-off value of
2.0 for relative expression of miR-451 normalized to
miR-16 levels, the sensitivity was 81% and the specificity
was 77%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed
that both miR-378 and miR-451 could serve as potential
biomarkers for distinguishing between RCC and healthy
controls, and even that their combination could improve
the stratification power characterized with AUC of 0.86
and the sensitivity of 81% and specificity 83% (Figure 3).
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis using (C) serum miR-451 yielded an AUC of 0.77,
sensitivity of 81%, and specificity of 77% in discriminating RCC and (D) serum miR-378 yielded AUC of 0.71,
sensitivity of 70%, and specificity of 60% in discriminating RCC
Discussion
Many recent studies have described miRNAs expression
profile in RCC and adjacent non-tumoral tissue
confirming the different pattern. Although significant
overlap between miRNAs identified by independent studies exist, regarding the number and type of up-/downregulated miRNAs, data are in part conflicting
[1,2,24,25]. Circulating miRNAs may possibly serve as a
new class of powerful and non-invasive biomarkers for
RCC patients. Regarding this hypothesis, we compared
the miRNAs expression profiles of RCC patients’ and
healthy controls’ serum samples. Based on the qRT-PCR
arrays approach we were able to describe 30 differentially expressed miRNAs, 19 of these miRNAs were upregulated and 11 were down-regulated. Such expression
profile is a bit controversial, as the global miRNA
down-regulation in RCC tissue samples has been repeatedly described [1-4]. The possible relation of miRNA
levels between tissue and corresponding serum is still
not clearly understood - some researchers postulate that
circulating miRNAs may not always be directly associated with the changes occuring in tumor tissues but
may also reflect indirect effects and could be secreted by
non-tumoral cells. Also mechanisms were described how
extracellular miRNAs can potentially interact with

recipient cells via a number of different processes,
including: direct fusion, internalization or receptormediated interactions. There are likely to be other
mechanisms, especially for vesicle-free miRNAs, but all
await further investigation to provide convincing evidence of their involvement in inter-cellular miRNA
exchange [26,27]. However, this proposed potential of
tumor cells to actively uptake miRNAs from circulation
can partly explain the opposite trends of miRNA expression levels in tissue compared to blood serum. Several
dysregulated miRNAs identified in our study have been
described to have altered expression levels in plasma or
serum of various cancers recently: up-regulated mir425* [28,29], let-7a [30] or let-7f [31].
In the validation phase of this study, we tested 3 candidate miRNAs (miR-378, miR-451, miR-150) in the
independent cohort of RCC patients. The up-regulation
of miR-378 and down-regulation of miR-451 expression
levels between serum of RCC patients and healthy
controls reached statistical significance in validation
study. Analytical characteristics of miR-378 (sensitivity
of 70%, specificity of 60%) and miR-451 (sensitivity of
81%, specificity of 77%) proved that both miR-378 and
miR-451 are potent in discriminating RCC from healthy
control serum. Furthermore, combination of serum
miR-378 and miR-451 levels, yielded sensitivity of 81%
and specificity 83%, proved to be even more powerful
discrimination tool. To our knowledge, the only study
concerning circulating miRNAs in renal cell carcinoma
identified circulating miR-1233 as a potential biomarker
for RCC patients, but although they performed the validation phase on a large cohort of RCC patients from
three different study centers, the diagnostic information
was below their expectations (AUC of 0.588, sensitivity
of 77%, specificity of 37.6%) [14].
Although our observations are promising, and miR378/miR-451 analytical characteristics reached values for
clinical utility, large-scale prospective studies aiming

their evaluation in the renal benign neoplasms and early
stages of the RCC are necessary to validate them as biomarkers for early diagnosis, and the analysis of blood
serum collections from each patient to evaluate miRNA
biomarker dynamics are needed to prove their potential
for early detection of relapse in RCC patients.
Conclusions
There is no standard serum biomarker used for diagnosis or early detection of recurrence for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. In our study, we identified 30
miRNAs differentially expressed between serum of RCC
patients and healthy controls. MiR-378, miR-451 and
miR-150 were further evaluated in the independent
group of patients, and two of them were successfully
validated: levels of miR-378 were increased, miR-451
levels were decreased in serum of RCC patients. Combination of miR-378 and miR-451 enable identification of
RCC serum with the sensitivity of 81%, specificity 83%
and AUC = 0.86. We believe, that circulating miRNAs
in serum are promising biomarkers in RCC.
