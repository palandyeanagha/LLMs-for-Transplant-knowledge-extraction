Abstract
Despite several studies demonstrating an independent and inverse association between cognition and mortality, the nature
of this association still remains unclear. To examine the association of cognition and mortality after accounting for
sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors and to explore both test and population characteristics influencing this
relationship. In a population based cohort of 8585 men and women aged 48–92 years, who had cognitive assessments in
2006–2011 and were followed up till 2016 for mortality, we examined the relationship between individual cognitive tests
as well as a global cognition score to compare their ability in predicting mortality and whether these differed by population
characteristics. Risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models including sociodemographic,
lifestyle and health variables, and self-reported comorbidities, as covariates in the models. Poor cognitive performance
(bottom quartile of combined cognition score) was associated with higher risk of mortality, Hazard Ratio = 1.32 (95%
Confidence Interval 1.09, 1.60); individual cognitive tests varied in their mortality associations and also performed
differently in middle-age and older age groups. Poor cognitive performance is independently associated with higher
mortality. This association is observed for global cognition and for specific cognitive abilities. Associations vary depending
on the cognitive test (and domain) as well as population characteristics, namely age and education.

Introduction
Cognitive decline occurs along a continuum [1, 2], spanning what has been described as ‘normal ageing’, to the
other end of the spectrum of cognitive impairment and
dementia. Studies have shown increased risk of mortality
with dementia [3–5] and cognitive impairment [6–8].
However, in an ageing population, understanding the nature of this relationship across the continuum may provide
insight into the different trajectories of decline. Poor cognitive function or mild impairment, has also been shown to
be independently associated with subsequent mortality
[9–12], both when measured globally and by specific
cognitive domain [12–14].
Definitions of poor cognition differ across studies,
classification based on varying local population norms and
cut-offs depending on the assessment tool and population
they are used in [15], make cross-study comparisons difficult. It is important to investigate whether less severe
cognitive dysfunction or poor cognition has a higher

mortality risk, not only because it precedes cognitive
impairment and dementia [1, 16, 17], but also because it is
likely to affect more individuals than those with impaired
cognition and dementia as defined using accepted criteria.
Studies examining association of milder cognitive difficulties with impending death have shown to be inconsistent
[6, 7, 18].
Associations between cognition and mortality have not
only been seen in later life when individuals are by definition at closer proximity to death [19, 20], but also at midlife [21] and with level of performance as measured in
childhood [11, 22]. The literature relates to testing both
globally and by domain, based on theoretical models that
have been put forward for conceptualising cognitive
function [11, 23]. A common factor termed ‘g’ or general
intelligence factor has been postulated as underlying all
cognitive functions accounting for much of the variance
observed in individuals and has been shown to be associated with mortality [6, 11], as have the more specific
cognitive domains [12, 13]. It is still debated as to what is
the best way of assessing cognitive function. [22].
The relationship between cognition and mortality is
complex despite being ubiquitous [24]. Better cognitive
ability is said to be an indicator of a well-functioning body
influenced by genetic as well as early and later life biological and environmental factors. This includes the
integrity of the brain and the efficiency of information
processing, which has been suggested to be more strongly
related to mortality than other cognitive abilities [25, 26].
Even though many cohort studies have shown robust
associations between cognition and mortality, there still
remains ambiguity on understanding this relationship and
as yet no pathway or mechanism has been postulated.
Cross study comparisons are difficult due to differences
in methodologies used. These include: inconsistencies in
accounting for covariates that are associated with both
cognitive function and mortality [10, 13, 27, 28]; using
different cognitive tests; the use of selected groups, such as
older individuals [29–32] or clinical patients [24], both of
which are more likely to have co-existing morbidities. This
has resulted in studies reporting different associations with
mortality [13, 14, 21, 33]. The earlier hypotheses of terminal cognitive effects being greater in middle age and
younger old and diminishing in later life have been refuted
[10] and shown to continue to exist into oldest age, studies
examining these age related differences in community
dwelling older individuals have been limited.
The purpose of this study is to examine the association
between cognitive performance (both global and domain
specific) and mortality in a well characterised and relatively healthy population in mid to later life, to provide
further clarity to this complex relationship. Our main aim is
to investigate how specific cognitive abilities differ in
predicting mortality and compare to a global cognition
score after controlling for a range of known sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors. In addition we examine the influence of the characteristics of the population
tested, namely age and education.
Methods
Study participants and data collection
The European prospective investigation of cancer (EPIC) is
a European wide study of diet and disease of which EPICNorfolk is one collaborating centre. At the inception of the
study (1993–1997), EPIC-Norfolk recruited over 25,000
community-dwelling men and women (40–79 years old)
from GP registers in and around the city of Norwich
(Norfolk, United Kingdom). This involved the completion
of a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a clinical
examination [34]. Subsequent follow-ups have involved
self-report of health and lifestyle postal questionnaires and
further clinical assessments. The data presented here are
from the third health examination (3HC or EPIC-Norfolk
3) which was conducted between 2006 and 2011 with a
preceding pilot phase between 2004 and 2006, in participants aged 48–92 years, without any report of overt cognitive problems. The full assessment was a comprehensive
3-hour examination which included tests assessing different domains of cognitive function. A detailed description of
the cohort both at inception and at 3HC have been published [35, 36]. The study was approved by the Norfolk
Local Research Ethics Committee (05/Q0101/191) and
East Norfolk and Waveney NHS Research Governance
Committee (2005EC07L). Informed consent was obtained
from all individual participants included in the study.
Assessment of cognition
The EPIC-Norfolk cognition battery consisted of seven
tests to assess performance across different cognitive
domains. This battery has been described in detail previously [36]. The battery consists of: a shortened version of
the Extended Mental State Exam (SF-EMSE) [37],
assessing global function; the Hopkins Verbal Learning
Test (HVLT, immediate total recall of three trials),
assessing verbal episodic memory [38]; Cambridoge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates
Learning Test (CANTAB-PAL) [39, 40], using the first
trial memory score (PAL-FTMS) as a measure of nonverbal episodic memory; a letter cancellation task assessing
attention [41], using the accuracy score (PW-Accuracy); an
event and time based task, for prospective memory [42];
the Visual Sensitivity Test (VST), with two separate

outcome variables, VST-simple and VST-Complex
[43, 44] for simple and complex visual processing speed
(measured reaction time, in ms) and a shortened version of
the National Adult Reading Test [45] or Short-NART [46],
using the NART Error Score for measure of reading ability
and crystallised intelligence [47]. This gave a total of eight
different cognitive measures.
Covariates
Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg (using digital
scales, Tanita) and height was measured with a stadiometer
(Chasmores, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm to calculate body
mass index [BMI: weight (in kgs) divided by height (in
m2
)]. Education (the highest level attained) and social class
were obtained from the baseline questionnaire. Education
was categorised into three groups (1) No qualification (not
completing school up to the age of 16), (2) Completion of
school up to the age of 16 or up to the age of 18 and finally
(3) those obtaining an education to graduate level (those
who obtained a degree or equivalent) or above. Social class
was dichotomised, into ‘non manual’ and ‘manual’ class.
Self-report of smoking status (current, former or never
smoker) and alcohol intake (Units/Week) were obtained
from health and lifestyle questionnaire administered at the
time of the clinic appointment. Alcohol units were categorised into 3 groups: 0 Units, 1–14 Units and more than
14 Units. Physical activity was assessed using two questions referring to activity during the past year, also from the
baseline questionnaire. The first question asked about usual
physical activity at work and the second question asked
about the amount of time spent, in hours per week, in
winter and summer in other physical activity. From this
information, a 4 point index was derived using this information to categorise level of activity into (1) inactive
(sedentary job and no recreational activity); (2) moderately
inactive (sedentary job with, 0.5 hour recreational activity
per day, or standing job with no recreational activity); (3)
moderately active (sedentary job with 0.5–1 hour recreational activity per day, or standing job with, 0.5 hour
recreational activity per day, or physical job with no
recreational activity); and (4) active (sedentary job with
0.1 hour recreational activity per day, or standing job with
0.1 hour recreational activity per day, or physical job with
at least some recreational activity, or heavy manual job).
The validation of this index has been described in detail
[48, 49].
Age was categorized into 5-year age bands. History of
heart-attack, stroke, cancer, diabetes and depression were
established using self-report of a range of conditions from
health and life style follow up questionnaire.
Mortality
Participants were followed up from the date of the cognitive examination until the date of their death or end of 31
March 2016, an average of 7.1 years. The cohort is linked
to the NHS Central Register (NHS Digital) for health and
the Office of National Statistics (UK) for death
certification.
Analyses
Measuring performance against the distribution of cognitive scores within a population to define abnormality,
particularly where the data are not normally distributed has
been described [15, 50]. The data for most of the tests in
this study, were not normally distributed and the prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment using accepted
standard diagnostic criteria was very low in the cohort [35].
Preliminary examination across groups of approximate
quartiles (due to the non-parametric distribution) did not
show a linear relationship with mortality for all the cognitive tests (Supplementary Table S1). There seemed to be
a more threshold response, with the lowest (approximate
quartile) group having greater mortality than the other
groups.
For this analysis, due to the distribution and non-linear
response, associations were examined using approximate
percentile cut-offs rather than the continuous cognitive
score. Poor performance was defined as obtaining a score
less than a cut-off point corresponding to approximately
the 25th percentile of the population distribution in each of
the eight cognitive measures individually. Participants
were classified into two groups based on the cut-off scores
for each of the tests. For prospective memory, poor performance was defined as those failing the task.
A composite score (EPIC-COGComp) was also created
from the individual cognitive test, including the global
measure of cognition, the SF-EMSE, which is an extension
on the widely used Mini Mental state Exam (MMSE). The
composite, should in theory, be a stronger measure of the
cognition construct than any individual item, and here
represents ‘g’ or general intelligence underlying all the
cognitive functions assessed. Participants were classified in
two groups for the continuous composite score in the same
way as the scores were for the individual tests described
above. A full description of how the composite score was
created is given in ‘‘Appendix 1’’ (Supplementary Information) Briefly, for each of the individual cognition tests, a
score of ‘0’ or ‘1’ was assigned based on whether the
individual was in the ‘poor performance’ or ‘good performance or reference’ group for each of the eight cognitive
outcome measures individually. The EPIC-COGComp was

calculated as a sum of the score based on the performance
group for all eight cognition test outcomes (range = 0–8).
The approximate bottom quartile (or obtaining a score of 5
or below) for the composite score, was used to define poor
performance for ‘g’.
The risk of death was estimated as a hazard ratio with 95
percent confidence interval (95% CI) for each of the cognitive tests in separate Cox proportional hazard regression
models. The independent association of poor performance
with mortality was assessed by first adjusting for age (per
5 years, treated as a continuous variable) and sex (models
1), then including education and social class (models 2)
and finally extending the models to include other health
variables (smoking, BMI, physical activity) and comorbidities (models 3).
Education, social class, physical activity and smoking
were all treated as categorical variables in the analysis, as
was co-morbidity (as present or not). Low and high BMI
have stronger association with mortality than the intermediate groups (Table S2), however initial exploratory analyses showed little difference in hazard ratio when BMI was
entered as a categorical (as low, normal, overweight and
obese groups) or as a continuous variable (data not shown,
but available at request). Therefore, BMI was entered in the
model as a continuous variable to improve sensitivity of the
analysis. The cognitive score was entered as a dichotomised variable based on the description above (poor
performance or not). Including alcohol did not change the
associations observed and so to reduce degrees of freedom
and to increase stability of the models, we did not include
alcohol in our final analysis.
In addition, we included the interaction terms 1/age
group (B 65 and those [ 65 years x each cognition test as
the dichotomized variable) and 2/education group (Qualifications and No Qualifications 9 each cognition test as the
dichotomized variable) to examine if age or education
group contributed to performance for each test. Due to the
strong influence of age and education on both cognition
and mortality, the data were also stratified into age and
education groups and adjusted hazard ratios calculated in
each group. Stratification not only allows the examination
of possible interaction, but examining the consistency of
association in the different groups, permits the exploration
of further potential confounding.
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated
using the continuous score for each of the individual tests,
to examine the strength of relationship between each of the
tests. The final analysis (model 4) mutually adjusted for all
eight cognitive measures (entered as dichotomised variables as described above). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA), with the level of significance set at 0.05.
Missing data in cognitive tests
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted to
explore the effect of missing data. Hazard ratios were
examined by assigning participants with missing data to
either the poor performance or to the reference category.
Hazard ratios also examined for individuals with data on all
eight cognitive tests and the specified covariates
(n = 5971) and compared to those with complete missing
data of any of the eight cognitive measures as well as those
not attending the health examination.
Results
After a maximum of 11.5 years of follow up (with an
average of 7.1 years), there were 861 deaths in the 8623
participants taking part in EPIC-Norfolk 3. There were 849
deaths observed in the 8585 participants who had a cognitive tests measure (9.9% of the EPIC-Norfolk 3 cohort).
Figure 1 summarises participation level at each phase and
the selection of the analytical sample for this study.
Table 1 shows the means and proportions of the variables included in this analysis by survival status. There
were significant differences between the two groups for
almost all the variables examined. Those who died, were
older, more likely to be men, have no qualifications, be
physically inactive, to be non-drinkers, less likely to have
been never smokers, and a higher proportion reported
prevalent disease. Of the 8585 participants with cognitive
data, 6128 participants had data for all the cognitive tests
with 2457 having some of the test measures and 38 participants having none. These 38 participants were not
included in the main analysis.
Compared to those with incomplete or no data, those
having attempted all the tests were younger, had higher
average scores for all the tests, reported less co-morbidity,
were less likely to be physically inactive, have no qualifications and be non-drinkers (Supplementary Table: S3).
The age and sex adjusted hazard ratios for mortality for
those who attended the health check and those who were
invited but did not attend were examined. Using the group
who had attended 3HC and had data on all 8 tests as reference, the mortality risk were as follows: with data on 1–7
tests, HR = 1.23 (95% CI 1.07, 1.41 P = 0.004); attended
3HC, but with no cog data HR = 1.71 (95% CI 0.96, 3.03
P = 0.07) and for those who were invited but did not attend
3HC, HR = 2.33 (95% CI 2.11, 2.56 P =\0.001).
Table 2 shows the results of the Cox proportional hazards analyses for all the tests separately and for the composite score. For the age and sex adjusted models, there
was an increased risk of mortality in those obtaining a poor

performance score as compared to those who did not for
each of the cognitive tests apart from the Short-NART.
Additional adjustment for education and social class made
little difference to the hazard ratios, as did the additional
adjustment for co-variates (smoking, body mass index,
physical activity) and comorbidities (models 3). Although
the magnitude of the association varied slightly across the
different tests, the PW-Accuracy test showed the strongest
association, and was comparable to the association
observed for the composite score.
In the sensitivity analysis, imputing missing into the
poor performance made little difference to the hazard ratios
(with slightly strengthening associations for some), but
attenuating considerably for most of the tests including the
composite score when ‘missings’ were assigned to the
reference category (Supplementary Table S4). Thus indicating that the ‘missings’ were likely to be in the poor
performance group. Further sensitivity analyses, to compare those with measures on all eight tests, with those with
seven tests or less, showed associations that were similar to
those seen in the whole cohort analysis. Associations were
statistically significant and stronger for participants with
data on all eight tests, and considerably attenuated for those
with data on seven tests or less. In the latter group, associations were observed for PW-Accuracy, VST complex
and prospective memory, although not to significance.
There was very little or no association for the remaining
tests for those with incomplete data (Supplementary
Table S5).
No significant interaction was observed with age group
(B 65 vs. [65 years) and any of the cognitive test (data
not shown) and for education, only significant for HVLT
(P = 0.03) but none of the other tests. On stratification,
there seem to be some age group differences, with significant and stronger associations observed for the composite
score, HVLT, PW-Accuracy and VST-Complex (Table 3)
in the middle-age group. Weaker and mostly significant
associations observed for composite and for all the other
tests, except short-NART in the older age group. Stratifying by education group, associations with mortality were
observed in the ‘no qualifications’ sub group for all tests
apart from HVLT and weak but not significant for NART.
Only weak (or no) association were observed in the ‘with
qualifications’ sub group for all tests with strongest

association observed for HVLT, PW-Accuracy and the
composite score. (Table 4). The confidence intervals
overlapped in both the age and education sub-groups.
The data were also tested for reverse causality, which is
to examine whether the associations observed were as a
result of those with disease pathology (and being closer to
death) also having lower cognition. The analyses (model 3)
were repeated for each of the tests individually and the
composite score by excluding individuals who died within
three years of follow-up after cognitive testing (N = 229).
At population level, the results of the reduced sample did
not show evidence of reverse causality with hazard ratios
barely changing (results available on request).
Exclusions of deaths within three years of the cognitive
test and then stratifying the data by age group showed a
different result from the original stratified analyses. The
hazard ratios in the older-age group showed little change.
However the same was not observed for the middle-age

group with variations in their prediction of mortality across
the different tests. The association for most of the tests
were attenuated (and due to small number, were no longer
significant). The greatest (and significant) increase in
association for the middle-age group was observed for
HVLT HR = 2.19 (95% CI 1.20, 4.00). Association were
also strengthened for prospective memory. The greatest
differences observed across the two age-groups were also
seen in HVLT and prospective memory (and remained,
though to a lesser degree for composite score). The age
group differences observed without exclusion of deaths, no
longer remained for PW-Accuracy and VST-Complex.
Correlations between the different cognitive tests were
weak to modest, with the strongest between the HVLT
(verbal episodic memory) and SF-EMSE (global cognition), r = 0.48 and the weakest between the VST-Complex
and Short-NART r = 0.06 (Table S7). Therefore,
collinearity was not considered to be an issue when
including all cognitive measures in the final model. The
PW-Accuracy test remained the strongest independent
predictor of mortality after mutually adjusting for all the
other cognitive abilities (Table5).
Discussion
This study presents a number of key findings. In this large
prospective cohort study of relatively healthy individuals
in mid to later life, poor cognitive performance was
independently associated with higher mortality over an
average of seven years of follow-up. Greater mortality was
observed in the lowest (approximate quartile) group,
showing the association to be a threshold effect similar to
previous reports [50] rather than a gradient across the range
of ability. Associations were not only observed for global
cognitive function (using the composite score), but also for
the individual tests covering a number of abilities or
domains [36]. These associations remained after adjusting
for sociodemographic, a range of lifestyle and health
variables, including prevalent disease. Associations were
not observed for the Short-NART. This was expected as
accumulated knowledge is known to be more stable than
other cognitive abilities until later life [22, 51].
Our study confirms the robust relationship between
cognition and mortality [10, 12, 13, 20, 21] and that the
ability to predict mortality not only exists for global cognition, but also across several cognitive domains [12, 13].
This is to varying degrees, with some specific abilities to
be more powerful predictors than others. Population
characteristics, particularly age and education also influenced the relationship and the predictive value of each test.
Cognitive impairment, even at mild levels increases the

association of mild impairment and mortality [52], our
study has shown this relationship extends beyond to
include poor performance, even before any evidence of
impairment.
There are three possible explanations for the observed
increased associations with mortality; (1) poor performance, which is on the trajectory of cognitive decline, is an
early indicator of dementia, which reduces survival time;
(2) cognition is not related, but the association is confounded by disease pathology (reverse causality) which is
having a negative impact on cognition and increasing
mortality; (3) poor cognition is having an indirect impact
by those with lower cognition unable to engage in appropriate lifestyle and health behaviours, such as healthy diet,
being physically active and not smoking. Also having
poorer health literacy which may hinder the recognition of
signs and symptoms of disease, seek medical attention and
follow prescribed medication regimes. It is unclear which
of the three possibilities could be in operation, it could be
either or all three.
On initial analyses by age group, we found that associations between cognitive test performance and survival
were stronger in individuals who were in the middle-age
group than those who were over 65 years. However, this
may be an artefact of a recognised methodological issue
[10]. The majority of the survivors in middle-age group are
expected to survive many years beyond the census date,
whereas survivors in the older age group (being chronologically closer to death, be frailer, have more co-morbidities and disabilities) are more likely to die soon after
the census date. Therefore, there are less differences
between the cognitive scores of those who die shortly on
either side of the census date in the older group, and the
differences between deceased and survivors become more
obscure. This incomplete investigation of the effects of
survival duration in studies is a known restriction of the
survival analysis methods [10].
We found little evidence of reverse causality at population level in our cohort when excluding individuals who
died within three years of the health examination.
Excluding these individuals also removed the differences

initially observed by age group, confirming that associations are not restricted to middle age, but continue into
older age [10]. However we did also observe the
strengthening of the hazard ratios for HVLT and prospective memory and mortality in the middle-age group, not
seen in the older age group. This indicates that dysfunction
of memory (both episodic and prospective) is far more
detrimental in terms of survival in middle age than it is in
later life. These findings concur with those from the
Whitehall Study that also showed memory to better predict
risk of mortality in midlife [53].
The other observation to highlight is the variation in the
VST measures across the age groups. This shows that the
two measures may be assessing different abilities. The
measures of VST-Simple may be a reflection of overall
frailty, slowing of simple responses and indicative of
accelerated physical ageing in the older age group, and is
not as sensitive to normal cognitive ageing and in situations
of reasonable motor speed. The reduced differential
between the age groups for PW-Accuracy and VST-Complex, after excluding those who died within 3 years indicate the greater significance of processing speed in
proximity to death than to chronological age. These functions are known to be affected by physiologic functioning
strongly predict mortality [25].
Investigations in mortality by cause are required to
examine these results in more detail. To examine the
question of the of different pathologies, is beyond the scope
of this paper, as this requires information on cause specific
mortalities across the different domains assessed by the
EPIC-Norfolk cognition battery. In the case of all-cause
mortality, individual cognitive domains are generally
comparable to the composite score though there are some
individual variations [27].
With regards to education, being in the poor performance group (in general) had a greater disadvantage in
terms of survival for the ‘no qualifications’ group than it
did for the ‘with qualifications’ group. This was observed
for the composite score and the individual tests (although
not significant for SF-EMSE and NART). The association
was not observed in the HVLT, a test of verbal episodic
memory, that requires semantic knowledge [38]. Even
though social class was adjusted for, it can be speculated,
that education adds some advantage to survival that is
beyond socio-economic status. Our results are line with
previous findings [6], that better cognition does not give the
survival advantage in circumstances of better socio-economic conditions as it does in lower socio-economic conditions. Having said that, the overall influence was seen in
both education groups, providing further support of the
independent relationship cognition and mortality.
In our population with no overt symptoms of cognitive
impairment, we have shown that the relationship between
cognition and mortality exists along the continuum to
include poor cognitive performance and that this association is not restricted to the disease states of cognitive
impairment and dementia. Although memory deficits are
the most common precursors to dementia, prospective
memory, processing speed and executive function have
also been shown to be strong indicators of decline and
mortality [54, 55]. This study adds further evidence to the
importance of these measures as predictors of mortality in
this relatively high functioning population.
Correlations between our cognitive tests were not high,
suggesting that they measure different abilities. However,
cognitive abilities do not work in isolation or independently of each other, with any given test making demands
on a range of abilities. A single test cannot give a pure
measure of a single cognitive ability [53], thus making it
difficult to isolate the true contribution of the single measure being reported. Assessing cognition across domains
provides detail to the size and nature of the relationship
with mortality.
The limitation of this study is that of healthy volunteer
bias and the decline in participation rate over the follow-up
period as one would expect from an ageing cohort, with
frailer individuals and those with lower function less likely
to participate. By cutting out those at the lower end of the
distribution, the cohort is likely to be healthier than those in
the general population, and associations reported may be
underestimated. We also observed a relatively large proportion of deaths in the middle age group occurred within
3 years. This may be a reflection of the health of the

participants attending the health examination. The younger
attendees attending the health examination, may have been
available due to ill health stopping them from working or
other activities, and older participants were the more able
and fitter survivors able to attend the clinic. Both groups
may therefore be slightly different from their counterparts
in the general population. The mortality rate in the under
65 group was very small, and would need further numbers
to see if the associations observed in this age group are
robust.
Having highlighted the limitation of the participants in
EPIC-Norfolk as healthier individuals, the cohort still
includes a wide age range from mid to later life, is representative of both men and women and covers a broad range
of socio-economic and education levels. Conducting this
study in this healthier population has the advantage of less
confounding from co-morbidities, a limitation in other
studies of older or from selected clinical groups. These
cognitive measures were part of a wider, comprehensive
health examination (maximum length 3 hour). Those who
were slower, less able and possibly less healthy individuals
had less chance to complete all tests within the limited
appointment time. This is further strengthened as associations were observed in healthier individuals with data on all
8 measures, but not in those completing fewer tests, also
indicating that conducting this analysis in a less healthy
cohort may not have shown similar associations. We have
used various methods to deal with the issue of confounding, including stratification, multi-variate adjustment and
excluding people who died within three years of the cognitive test and found associations between cognition and
mortality to remain. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out
residual confounding with other known and unknown risk
factors may still be present.
Inconsistencies across studies may also be due to the
heterogeneity in methodologies, in terms of assessment
tools and the sample population. If tests purporting to
measure the same ability are tapping into different cognitive and sensory abilities, they cannot be measuring the
exact same construct. Adding to this complexity is the
variation in the rate of decline across the abilities, each
with different influence on performance and subsequently
on the outcome measured.
One single test did not stand out as being the best predictor for mortality, however, we do not agree that individual cognitive domains are no better predictors than more
general cognitive scores [27]. Using this argument for the
sake of brevity is too simplistic. Our test for general cognition (SF-EMSE), testing a number of domains, did not
perform as well as the composite score which was a
combination of all the tests of the battery, or even some of
the other tests measuring fewer abilities. By combining all
tests and presenting as a single standardised score and not
considering the separate abilities (as some studies have
done), may result in missing on vital information that may
then hinder interpretation.
Our findings support the conclusion that cognitive
function is independently associated with death. However,
we also emphasise the importance of giving due consideration to the characteristics of the sample population and
psychometric properties of the assessment tools when
interpreting results.

Appendix: Creating the cognition composite
score from the EPIC-Norfolk cognition
battery (EPIC-COGComp)
Method
A composite score (EPIC-COGComp), in theory should be
a stronger measure of overall cognition than any individual
item. EPIC-COGComp represents all the abilities covered
in the EPIC-Norfolk cognition battery. Briefly, for each of
the individual cognition test (as listed in Table 6, with the
predominant abilities assessed by each test), two groups
were generated. These were based on the cut-off point
corresponding to approximately the 25th percentile of the
population distribution in each of the eight cognitive

outcome measures individually; the ‘poor performance
group’ and the ‘good performance or reference group’.
Participants were then assigned a score of 0 if they were in
the ‘poor performance’ group and a score of 1 if in the
‘good performance or reference’ group for each of the tests.
The EPIC-COGComp composite score was then calculated
as a sum of the score based on the performance group for
all eight cognition test outcomes. The lowest possible score
was 0 (being in the poor performance group for all 8
cognitive test outcomes) and the highest was 8, (being in
the good performance group for all 8 cognitive test outcomes). The dichotomised variable of the EPIC-COGComp score was included in the analyses in the exact same
way as the individual tests scores, with the approximate
bottom quartile (or obtaining a score of 5 or below)
defining poor performance for global cognition.
Missing data
As the EPIC-COGComp, composite score relies on a score
for all eight cognitive tests, it was only possible to examine
associations with mortality for those with a score on all 8
outcomes, reducing the analysis to only 6128 participants.
To maximise use of the data, two variants of the composite
score were created to include all the available cognitive
measures. The first variant (EPIC-COGComp0) was generated by imputing a score of 0 (assigning individuals to
the ‘poor performance group’) for any test with a missing
value and the second variant (EPIC-COGComp1) was
generated by imputing a score of 1 (assigning individuals
to the ‘good performance or reference group’) for any test
with a missing value. The range for both variants were also
0–8.
Analysis
The risk of death was estimated as a hazard ratio with 95
percent confidence interval (95% CI) for the composite
score by Cox proportional hazard regression. The independent association of poor performance with mortality
was assessed by first adjusting for age and sex (models 1),
including education and social class (models 2) and finally
extending the models to include other health variables
(smoking, body mass index, physical activity) and
comorbidities (models 3).
