Abstract
A recently developed pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 bursting in Wuhan, China, has
quickly spread across the world. We report the clinical characteristics of 82 cases of death from
COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARSCoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital’s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. All patients were local residents
of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted.
Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU,
83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of
the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older
than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died
had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes
(18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the
leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic,
hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients,
respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia
(24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5
(94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), and increased C-reactive
protein (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%) levels. A high level of IL6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. The median time from initial symptoms to
death was 15 days (IQR 11–20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death
was remarkably observed. Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease and even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID19, but the virus itself and cytokine release syndrome-mediated damage to other organs, including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhagic damage, should be taken seriously as well.

Introduction
In December 2019, the first acute respiratory disease case caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, recently officially named Corona Virus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), occurred in Wuhan, China [1, 2].
Person-to-person transmission has been identified through respiratory droplets or close contact [3–5]. By February 14, 2020, more than 60,000 confirmed cases and close to 2,000 cases of
death have been documented in China, with hundreds of imported patients found in other
countries [4–7].
Generally, the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 3 days (range: 0–24 days). Fever,
cough, and fatigue are the most common symptoms [1]. Approximately 20–30% of cases
develop severe illness, and some need further intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU) [8,
9]. Organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, acute
cardiac injury, and acute renal injury, can happen in severe cases with COVID-19 [1, 8, 9]. It
has been reported that critically ill patients are more likely to be older, have underlying diseases, and have symptoms of dyspnea [9]. Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and antiviral therapy are usually applied in clinical management, but
presently, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19, especially for severe cases [1, 8, 9].
ARDS, a rapidly progressive disease, is the main cause of death for patients infected with
previously recognized corona virus infections, such as SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [10, 11]. In this context, it was initially considered
that the lung is the most commonly damaged organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection since human
airway epithelia express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 infection [12, 13]. However, increasing clinical cases have shown cardiac, renal
and even digestive organ damage in patients with COVID-19 [9], which is consistent with the
findings that kidney, colon and other tissues also express ACE2 in addition to airway epithelia
[14, 15]. The above clinical phenomena and basic research suggest a more complicated pathogenesis of COVID-19. Hence, analyzing the clinical characteristics of death cases with
COVID-19 is urgently needed to improve the outcome of infected patients.
Methods
Data collection
We retrospectively collected the epidemiological and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 patients who died from January 11, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in Renmin Hospital
of Wuhan University. The confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result
by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection on
nasopharyngeal swab. This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of
the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China (approval number:
WDRY2020-K038). The Research Ethics Committee waived the requirement of informed consent before the study started because of the urgent need to collect epidemiological and clinical
data. We analyzed all the data anonymously. The data set for this study is available in S1 Table.
The clinical features of the patients, including clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory analyses,
radiological findings, treatment, and outcome, were obtained from the hospital’s electronic
medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Laboratory analyses included complete blood count, liver function, renal function, electrolyte test,
coagulation function, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, myocardial enzymes,

procalcitonin, and status of other viral infections. Radiological analyses comprised X-ray and
computed tomography.
The date of symptom onset, initial diagnosis of COVID-19, and death were recorded accurately. The onset survival time was defined as the period between the onset of different symptoms and signs and the time of death. To increase the accuracy of the collected data, two
researchers independently reviewed the data collection forms. Also, when the patients were
admitted to hospital, the attending doctors directly communicated with them or their family
members to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
Inflammatory markers
Inflammatory markers associated with inflammation-linked disease were calculated using the
specific parameters of blood tests. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated
by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. The systemic immuneinflammation index (SII) was defined as platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count
(/μL). Interleukin (IL)-6 was detected using the Human Cytokine Standard Assays panel (ET
Healthcare, Inc., Shanghai, China) and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were used to determine the patients’ epidemiological and clinical features.
Continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and categorical variables are expressed as percentages in different categories. The chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was adopted for categorical variables. The associations between the different
clinical variables and the time from initial symptoms to death were evaluated using Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient. The statistical analyses in this study were performed using
STATA 15.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). A two-sided p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The epidemiological features and underlying diseases
From January 11, 2020, to February 10, 2020, a total of 1,334 patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recorded at Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, and 6.2%
(82/1334) of these patients died. In the same period, the rates of mortality for all causes and
non-COVID-19 in this hospital were 2.3% (162/7119) and 1.4% (80/5785), respectively. The
mortality rate of COVID-19 was higher than that of non-COVID-19 (p<0.001).
The epidemiological features and underlying diseases are shown in Table 1. All patients
were local residents of Wuhan, and only 2 patients acknowledged contact with patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All the patients denied a history of contact with wildlife or
the Huanan seafood market. A large proportion of the patients were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted (77/82). Severe illness meets any of the following: (a) Increased respiratory
rate (�30 breaths/min), dyspnea, cyanosis of lips; (b) When breathing air, saturation of pulse
oximetry (SPO) �93%; (c) Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ concentration of oxygen
inhalation (FiO2) �300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa); (d) Pulmonary imaging shows multiple
lung lobe lesions or lesion progression within 48 hours >50%; (e) Combined with other clinical conditions requiring hospitalization. Critical illness meets any of the following: (a) Respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; (b) Shock occurs; (c) Combining other
organ failure requires ICU monitoring treatment. Both severe and critical illness refer to

“Hubei province new coronavirus infection pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines
(trial first edition)”. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%), older than 60 years
(80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years (IQR 65.0–80.0). Most of the patients who died
had comorbidities (75.6%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes
(18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Thirty out of the 82 patients who
died (30.5%) had 2 or more underlying diseases.
Causes of death of patients with COVID-19
We analyzed the causes of mortality of the patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection (Table 2). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed
by sepsis/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF) (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic,
hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients,

respectively. A majority of patients (75.6%) had 3 or more damaged organs or systems following infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Initial symptoms, laboratory analyses, radiological findings
As shown in Table 3, fever (78.0%), cough (64.6%), and shortness of breath (63.4%) were the
main common symptoms. Diarrhea was observed in 12.2% of patients. All patients had bilateral involvement on chest radiographs. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia
(74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. All the patients had increased
C-reactive protein levels (100%), and most patients had a high NLR of >5.0 (94.5%) and SII
index of >500 (89.2%) as well as high lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), D-dimer (97.1%), cardiac
troponin I (86.7%), and procalcitonin (81.2%) levels. Insufficient cell immunity with reduced
CD3+ (93.1%), CD8+ (98.3%), and CD6+CD56+ (100%) cell counts and high levels of circulating IL-6 (100%) were observed in the patients.
Furthermore, in the last 24 hours of death, lymphopenia (73.7%), neutrophilia (100%), and
thrombocytopenia (63.2%) were continuously present. Increased C-reactive protein levels,
high NLRs, and increased lactate dehydrogenase and increased D-dimer were found in all
patients. The incidence of neutrophilia increased from 74.3% to 100%, and the incidence of
lymphopenia was reduced from 89.2% to 73.7%. The incidence of high creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen increased from 15.3% to 45.0% and 48.6% to 85.0%, respectively. High levels of
IL-6 (>10 U/L) remained in all detected patients. More than half of the patients had a pH
value of less than 7.35 (52.9%) and a pO2 value of less than 60 mmHg (70.6%) (Table 4).

Treatment and survival time of dead patients with COVID-19
As shown in S2 Table, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU. Patients received
oxygen therapy (100%) and mechanical ventilation (40.2%), including 4 with invasive mechanical ventilation (4.8%). All patients received intravenous antibiotics and antiviral medications,
and systematic corticosteroids were used in 29 patients (35.3%).
The median time from initial symptom onset to death was 15 days (IQR 15–20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase
(p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death was remarkably observed (Fig 1A–1C).
Discussion
The mortality of 6.2% from the current study was lower than that of SARS infection in 2003.
However, the mortality rate from this center is slightly higher than that previously reported
[9]. We speculated that the reason might be that fewer patients in our study were transferred
to the ICU in time when their condition rapidly worsened owing to the shortage of beds and
medical supplies. On the other hand, limited death cases and fewer than 15 patients were

included in their cohorts [8, 9], while many more death cases were included in the present
study.
Our study first focused on the epidemiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19
who died and the mortality rate of COVID-19 was found higher than that of non-COVID-19
(p<0.001). Several factors were responsible for the death of the patients included in this study.
A majority of the patients in our study were older than 60 years, and a borderline significant
association between age and time from initial symptoms to death was significantly observed.
These results are consistent with the finding that critically ill patients are more likely to be
older [16]. Moreover, we found that underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart disease
and diabetes were very common in our death cases, and 30.5% of patients had 2 or more
comorbidities. These features are consistent with a previous report that patients with underlying diseases are more likely to develop severe illness [9]. Cancer patients comprised 7.3% of
our cohort, which had a much higher morbidity than those without cancer, suggesting that
cancer patients are more likely to develop severe disease or die. These results are consistent
with the findings from a nationwide analysis in China [17]. Immune deficiency to virus infection seems to be a common feature in older males with comorbidities.
We further analyzed the cause of death of patients with COVID-19 and found that respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death. It has been reported that the binding receptor
for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is mainly expressed in blood vessels and lung alveolar type II (AT2)
epithelial cells [13]. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack
ACE2-expressing cells [13]. Indeed, pathological findings indicated that lungs infected with
SARS-CoV-2 present with ARDS, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, and
evident desquamation of pneumocytes [18]. Therefore, our finding that respiratory failure is
the leading cause of death is consistent with the underlying pathological mechanism of
COVID-19.
In addition to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, renal failure and even MOF
were also recognized as the cause of death by COVID-19 in our study. Laboratory findings
also revealed cardiac, hepatic, and renal damage in some patients. In addition, we observed a
significant association between aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and time
from initial symptoms to death. These clinical phenomena could be explained by virus attack
and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-mediated tissue damage. First, ACE2 expression is also
found in the kidney, heart, and liver; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the cells of the
above tissues, reproduce and damage these organs [14, 15]. Second, viral infection and subsequent tissue damage either in the lung or other target organs could elicit immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely, CRS, ultimately injuring the tissue and causing
target organ failure. Obviously, increased amounts of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), are associated with severe lung injury in patients
infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [19, 20]. A recent study showed that high levels of
IL-1β, interferon γ-induced protein 10, and MCP-1 occurred in the serum of patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2, which probably led to the activation of the T-helper-1 cell response [1]. In
the present report, high levels of IL-6 of more than 10 U/L and C-reactive protein were
detected in all patients, even in the last 24 hours prior to death.
We also depicted the immune status of COVID-19 patients with severe illness. Most of the
patients in our study presented with neutrophilia and lymphopenia on admission; specifically,
reduced CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were observed in some patients. A high NLR
was also observed on admission and 24 hours before death. These results, consistent with the
previous findings found in patients with severe illness, suggest that the perturbation of the
immune system contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. These observations could
also explain why older males with comorbidities likely succumb to COVID-19.

Our study has some limitations. First, some patients did not receive timely supportive interventions, such as admission to the ICU, because an increasing number of severe patients
occurred in a short period and the overwhelming of our medical system. However, the present
data could partially be a scenario where COVID-19 patients progress in a natural pathophysiological manner rather than outcomes from intervention by treatment. Second, the consecutive
detection of cytokines is lacking, which fails to truly monitor the severity of CRS. Third, organ
damage could originate from a history of medication, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine, which are associated with renal or
liver injury [21, 22]. In our study, all patients received intravenous antibiotics and antiviral
drugs.
Overall, from the point of view of the causes of death, we presented the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Lung injury begins with an insult to the lung epithelium
mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed in the lungs, which leads
most commonly to respiratory failure. Other organs or tissues, more or less, are potentially
damaged through direct attack from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, damage to multiple systems,
including the lungs, might originate with systemic damage due to CRS following SARS-CoV-2
infection. Considering the pandemic potential and moderate threat of COVID-19 for populations with multiple underlying diseases, further studies are needed to focus on the pathology
and pathophysiology of the tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on the
activation process of the immune response and cytokine storm.
