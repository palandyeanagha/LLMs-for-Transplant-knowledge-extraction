Abstract
Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) was primarily considered one disease entity. Hence, one treatment protocol was proposed
in the beginning to all CNS patients. Today, with the help of gene diagnostics, we know that CNS is a heterogeneous group of
disorders and therefore, different treatment protocols are needed. The most important gene defects causing CNS are NPHS1,
NPHS2, WT1, LAMB2, and PLCE1. Before active treatment, all infants with CNS died. It was stated already in the mid-1980s
that intensive medical therapy followed by kidney transplantation (KTx) should be the choice of treatment for infants with severe
CNS. In Finland, early aggressive treatment protocol was adopted from the USA and further developed for treatment of children
with the Finnish type of CNS. The aim of this review is to state reasons for “early aggressive treatment” including daily albumin
infusions, intensified nutrition, and timely bilateral nephrectomy followed by KTx at the age of 1–2 years.

Introduction
Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) manifests within the
first 3 months of age, and is differentiated from infantile nephrotic syndrome, which appears later during the first 1–
2 years of life and mostly has a more favorable prognosis
[ 1 ]. CNS of the Finnish type (CNF; NPHS1,
MIM#256300F) was clinically described by Niilo Hallman
in 1956 [2] and Reijo Norio reported its autosomal recessive
inheritance 10 years later [3]. CNF is defined as heavy proteinuria, severe hypoproteinemia, edema, and secondary manifestations due to heavy proteinuria detected shortly after
birth. Familial and sporadic CNS cases were described in infants without Finnish background already in the 1940s and
1950s, suggesting that primary CNS was not a single entity
[4]. In 1998, Marjo Kestilä and coworkers identified mutations in the NPHS1 gene and named the product of the gene
as nephrin [5]. Around 90% of the Finnish CNF patients have
two truncating NPHS1 mutations (Fin-major/Fin-major 60%,
Fin-major/Fin-minor 20%, Fin-minor/Fin-minor 10%) [5].
Both mutations lead to a total absence of nephrin molecules
in the podocyte slit diaphragm and severe damage of this
structure [6]. Worldwide, more than 200 NPHS1 mutations
with variable clinical severity have been identified [7–13].
Other important genetic defects affecting the glomerular
filtration barrier are found in NPHS2 (podocin), WT1
(Wilms tumor protein 1), LAMB2 (laminin beta 2), and
PLCE1 (phospholipase C epsilon 1) [14–17]. As is the case
with NPHS1, these gene defects cause mostly isolated CNS
and, less often, syndromic disorders. The magnitude of protein
losses and development of kidney failure are, however, variable, and the severity of the disease may vary even between
patients having the same mutation. Clinical features of severe
CNS are failure to thrive, difficulties in controlling hydration
status, and complications, like thrombosis or repeated sepsis.
CNF has been considered a prototype of CNS and its management is still challenging [18–20]. Due to the variable severity of the disease, CNS patients have been treated during
the past 2–3 decades according to variable protocols including
an early bilateral nephrectomy and kidney transplantation
(KTx), unilateral nephrectomy in an attempt to delay dialysis
and transplantation, and conservative treatment until development of kidney failure [21]. Due to the rarity of CNS and its
genetic and clinical variability, there is not enough evidence to

define one treatment strategy for all CNS patients. The aim of
this review is to state reasons when and why to use “early
aggressive treatment,” including intensified nutrition, albumin
infusions, timely bilateral nephrectomy, dialysis, and KTx at
the age of 1–2 years.
Evolution of treatment for severe CNS
The outcome of CNS infants was originally dismal and was
related to heavy urinary protein losses. Niilo Huttunen published
data on 75 Finnish CNF patients followed over the years 1965–
1973 [22]. The children had nutritional support but no one received albumin infusions. Edema and/or abdominal distension
was noticed in children before 2 months of age. Over half of the
children died before 6 months of age, with mean patient survival
of 7.6 months. The oldest child survived 2.2 years. Infection was
the most common cause of death (31%), 19% died due to thrombotic complications, and in 43%, the cause of death remained
unknown (mostly hemodynamic collapse). None of the children
developed uremia before their death.
Based on three CNS children transplanted successfully in
Minnesota in the early 1970s, KTx was proposed as the only
way to provide a permanent cure and good quality of life for
these children [23]. Hoyer et al. proposed further that KTx
should be performed before kidney failure to decrease early
mortality and growth failure [23]. Active treatment, which included high caloric, high protein, and low sodium diet, was
offered in Minnesota to infants since 1971 [4]. The infants also
received diuretics and IV albumin to allow sufficient fluid intake for caloric needs and to minimize edema. Despite active
treatment, 25% of the patients died before they were
transplanted, 85% suffered from bacterial infections, all had
growth retardation, and 93% showed developmental delay or
neurological abnormalities before KTx. Most of the patients
underwent bilateral nephrectomy prior to the transplantation
and they became dramatically less irritable, more active, and
their appetite improved [4]. Mahan et al. concluded that CNS
should no longer be considered lethal and that intensive medical
therapy followed by KTx should be the treatment of choice [4].
Intensified treatment protocol for CNF
children
The active Finnish treatment strategy for CNF infants was
adopted from Minnesota to prevent early death and complications [1]. A three-stage protocol was regarded feasible in treatment of infants with severe CNS: (1) Management of nephrosis
from birth to the age of 6–10 months (weight 7 kg), (2) bilateral
nephrectomy and peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 3–6 months, (3)
KTx with extra peritoneal engraftment when the weight of
10 kg has been reached (usually 1–1.5 years of age).
Due to high frequency of NPHS1-associated CNS in our
country, intensified treatment is started for all 0–3-month-old
infants with severe hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria (after
albumin substitution), and clinical signs of nephrosis. The
therapy is individually adjusted based on the clinical response
and genetic analysis. Especially in infants with a “mild” genotype (missense mutation in one or two of the NPHS1 alleles,
or other mutated genes) and stable clinical status, weaning off
the parenteral therapy should be tried after the first few weeks.
This, however, rarely succeeds in our patient material.
So far, 130 CNF children have been treated with this protocol. Two (1.5%) of the infants died during the nephrotic
stage, seven on dialysis (5.4%), and seven (5.4%) after KTx.
In total, close to 90% of the children have survived and managed quite well with their kidney grafts.
Management of nephrosis
During the first month, the treatment of infants with CNS
strives for controlling edema, preventing and treating complications like infections and thromboses, and providing optimal
nutrition to allow best possible growth and development
(Table 1) [1, 18]. Diet is energy-rich (130 kcal/kg/day) and
protein-rich (3–4 g/kg/day). Albumin infusions (1–4 g/kg/
Table 1 Intensified treatment protocol for children with severe CNS
Nutrition and fluid management
- Limit fluid intake by need to provide adequate nutrition
- Avoid unnecessary IV-fluids and salt supplementation
- Provide diet with high energy intake (100–150 KCAL/kg/day) and high
protein intake (3–4 g/kg/day)
Albumin (20%) infusions
- Indicated in treatment of symptomatic hypovolemia and edema
- Initial dose 1–2 g/kg/day divided in three 2-h infusions
- After few weeks to stable patients: one nightly albumin infusion or two
2–3-h infusions
- Furosemide 0.5–2 mg/kg is given together with albumin; consider 2
doses together with a long albumin infusion
RAAS inhibition trial after neonatal period
- Indicated in patients with missense NPHS1 mutations (one or both
alleles) or mutations in other than NPHS1 gene
- Captopril 0.01–0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Increase the dose gradually
Nephrectomy
- Early nephrectomy (in weight approx. 7 kg) is indicated if difficulties in
the clinical management of the patient (infections, poor growth and
development, thrombotic complications, difficulties in controlling
hydration status, cardiac problems)
- Postpone nephrectomy (till weight > 10 kg) if child grows and develops
well and shows no severe complications caused by nephrosis
- Bilateral nephrectomy is indicated before kidney transplantation if
significant nephrosis persists
- Routine nephrectomies are not necessary to all CNS patients

day) combined with intravenous furosemide (1–3 mg/kg/day)
are initially divided into three 2-h infusions and after a few
weeks given as one nightly infusion or two shorter infusions.
The goal of the albumin/furosemide infusions is to minimize
edema and hemodynamic problems. The dosing is based on
weight and other clinical signs—not on plasma albumin
levels, which remain low. In case of increased edema, which
is common especially during infections, the nightly albumin/
furosemide infusions are divided into 4 daily doses to increase
diuresis.
In practice, parenteral infusions require central vein catheters, which are usually placed at the age of a few weeks. They
carry a risk for thrombotic events, especially since children
with CNF show hypercoagulopathy, caused by urinary loss of
coagulation factors. Intravenous ATIII (50 units/kg) is given
before all invasive procedures and sodium warfarin is used in
all infants with INR target level of 2–2.5 [18]. We have observed clearly fewer thrombotic complications since systematic use of anticoagulation. In the study of the European
Society for Pediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group,
the incidence of thrombosis in 71 CNS patients treated between 2010 and 2015 was 13% [20]. However, no statistical
difference was found between patients on antithrombotic prophylaxis (67% received heparin and 33% warfarin sodium)
and those not on prophylaxis. In our experience, immunoglobulin infusions and antibiotic prophylaxis are not sufficient in
prevention of infections and are therefore not used routinely
[18, 24].
Reduction of protein excretion by ACE inhibitors (and indomethacin) has been achieved in CNS infants with genetic
defects [20, 25]. This “antiproteinuric therapy” is worthwhile
trying especially in cases with milder protein excretion and/or
a missense mutation (amino acid change) in one or both
NPHS1 alleles, or other nephrosis genes. Among our patients,
an infant with Fin-major/R743C genotype responded permanently to ACE inhibitor therapy [26]. On the other hand, patients with truncating mutations have never done that. In CNF
patients, even “mild” missense mutations may lead to defective trafficking of encoded protein and its absence on the
podocyte surface, which resembles the situation with truncating mutations [27].
Dialysis
Dialysis may be needed for the treatment of CNS children
either after the development of kidney failure or after bilateral
nephrectomy.
Continuous PD was introduced to infants already in the
1980s [28, 29]. Infections and poor growth were major problems during the early years [30–32]. Subsequently, the results
improved, and it became evident that the most important risk
factor for mortality in infants is their non-renal comorbidity
[33, 34]. Laakkonen et al. prospectively studied 21 Finnish
infants starting PD at mean age 0.59 years [35]. CNF was the
primary diagnosis in 71% and bilateral nephrectomy was performed in all of them. Catch-up growth was documented in
57%, and 29% had neurological abnormalities since birth
which did not progress during PD [35].
During the past years, the use of hemodialysis (HD) has
increased in infants and toddlers with kidney failure. HD is
feasible also in nephrectomized CNS infants. In particular,
patients who will undergo a living-related donor transplantation and live relatively close to the hospital may be treated for
a few weeks with HD prior to KTx. HD is a valid treatment
also for infants with problems in the PD therapy (infections
and technical problems).
Kidney transplantation
A KTx program for infants was started in Finland after encouraging a report by Mahan et al. [1]. Holmberg et al., in the mid1990s, reported excellent 3-year results for 32 CNF patients
transplanted after bilateral nephrectomy and treated with PD
for at least 3 months [1]. Initially, the results of KTx in children
less than 2–5 years of age were less impressive than in older
recipients, but patient outcome and graft survival improved
clearly over the next decades. Laine et al. in 1994 reported
comparable results for KTx in children under 5 years of age
and older ones [36]. Five years later, Qvist et al. reported excellent 7-year KTx outcome for children under 5 years of age,
of which 84% had CNF as the primary diagnosis [37]. Patient
survival was 100% and graft survival was equal for children
under and over 2 years of age. Two later studies were in accordance with that of Qvist et al., stating that the age does not affect
10-year graft survival [38, 39]. Today, young children have
longer half-life of their kidney graft than older children [38, 39].
In most of the children with severe CNS, it is clear that
quality of life is better and risk for complications lower after
KTx compared with the nephrotic or uremic/dialysis periods.
KTx has been performed on young infants with a weight of <
5 kg and adult-sized grafts have been successfully
transplanted into infants weighing 7–10 kg [40]. In our experience, KTx with extra peritoneal engraftment can be safely
performed for a 10-kg infant.
Thrombotic events used to be a major problem when
transplanting small children. Normalization of the coagulation
factor levels before KTx (during the dialysis stage), proper
placement of the graft (proximal vessel anastomoses), avoidance of compression and circulatory problems by postponing
the closure of fascia for a few days after KTx when necessary,
and abundant fluid therapy peri- and post-operatively are essential in avoiding thrombotic events. Using this protocol, we
have lost one graft (0.7%) due to thrombosis in CNS children,
which is less than that reported in 1–12-year-aged children
(around 2%) [40].
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1985–1990 1987

Another important issue in infant KTx is the risk for
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infections and post-transplantation
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after KTx. A small child
who is seronegative for EBV at the time of KTx has increased
risk for PTLD. In our center, PTLD was diagnosed in four
school-aged children transplanted as infants due to CNS
(4%) as compared with three non-CNS children (2%)
transplanted after 2 years of age (total 252 children) [40].
Long-term outcome
During the nephrotic stage, psychomotor delay caused by muscle weakness is common in children with severe CNS [4].
Typically, the children show dramatic improvement in their
developmental skills within 1 year after KTx [4]. Also, the
cardiac hypertrophy often seen in the nephrotic stage reverses.
Avoidance of neurological complications is crucial in the
management of CNS children. Impairment in intellectual performance and motor skills among KTx children has been mainly associated with neurological comorbidity, hypertensive crises, and seizures during dialysis, as well as lower socioeconomic status, but they have been observed also in absence
of any comorbidities [41, 42]. Haavisto et al. studied 50 Finnish
children 6.9 years after their first KTx performed over the years
1993–2008 at mean age of 3.7 years (44% had NPHS1 as their
primary disease) with respect to cognitive difficulties [43].
Children with KTx scored lower in neuropsychological assessment, both for the verbal and visuospatial domains, compared
with the controls. Better cognitive outcome was associated with
absence of neurological comorbidity, but also with younger
age, shorter disease duration, and better long-term kidney function [43]. Even though CNF children are mostly born with a
lower gestational age and birth weight, and are transplanted
earlier than children with other diagnoses, they scored higher
on all measures than children with other diagnoses. Haavisto
et al. concluded that children with KTx later in their life experience longer disease duration, which places them at risk for
more neurodevelopmental deficits [43].
Infants receiving living or deceased donor grafts have estimated graft survival of at least 80% at 10 years [38]. Thus,
many CNS patients transplanted at the age of 1–2 years need a
new graft as young adults. The likelihood, however, is not
greater compared with those transplanted 2–5 years later
[38]. On the contrary, since children with severe CNS are
prone to complications, later KTx might negatively impact
their later life.
Conclusions
CNS is not one disease with a single-treatment protocol. The
magnitude of urinary protein losses is important in deciding
the treatment strategy. In case of massive proteinuria (100–
150 g/L), severe hypoproteinemia may easily lead to edema,
thrombotic complications, and sometimes hemodynamic
compromise. On the other hand, an infant with proteinuria
of 5–20 g/L and gradually developing uremia can manage
without aggressive parenteral therapy. Whether to use bilateral, unilateral, or no nephrectomy should be based on severity
of CNS and the experience in the treating center. They all
might work, but bilateral nephrectomy terminates the harmful
proteinuria, and active treatment during nephrosis helps children to grow and develop their motor skills. The quality of life
is better after KTx than before it. Treatment results have improved over the last decades; therefore, the decision on timing
nephrectomy should be made individually. Nephrectomy may
be postponed in patients with severe CNS who do not develop
any specific complications during the nephrotic period.
Kidney transplantation results in infants are today excellent,
and according to the latest studies, infants seem to have the
best results, and the outcome of CNS infants does not differ
from infants with other diagnoses. Hence, it seems justified to
perform early KTx in infants with severe CNS.
Key summary points
1. Not enough evidence is available to define optimal treatment strategy for CNS due to its rarity and large genetic
variation in patient population.
2. Early aggressive treatment for patients with severe CNS
includes daily albumin infusions, intensified nutrition,
and timely bilateral nephrectomy followed by early KTx.
3. Psychomotor delay is related to muscle weakness and
KTx improves developmental skills dramatically.
4. Infants have nowadays the best long-term KTx outcome,
and results of NPHS1 patients do not differ from those of
infants with other diagnoses than CNS.
5. Short period of protein deficiency during first year of life,
combined with short dialysis and early KTx, seems to be
less detrimental for neurological development in children
with severe CNS; hence, early KTx should be considered.
6. Studies are needed to compare long-term and
neurocognitive outcome between children with severe
CNS treated aggressively and conservatively.
