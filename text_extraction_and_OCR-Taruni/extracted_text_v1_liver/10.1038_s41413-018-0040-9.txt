In the recent two decades, it has been well elucidated that
receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL; also known
as TNFSF11) binding to its receptor RANK (also known as
TNFRSF11A) drives osteoclast development as the crucial signaling
pathway.1–3 However, accumulating evidence also implies that
osteoblastic RANKL regulates osteoblastogenesis.4–6 The studies
“RANKL signaling in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
negatively regulates osteoblastic bone formation” by Chen et al.
in the current issue of Bone Research, and “Coupling of bone
resorption and formation by RANKL reverse signalling” by Yuki
Ikeuchi et al. in Nature (2018;561:195–200) reveal that RANKLRANK signaling regulates osteoblastogenesis in addition to its role
in osteoclastogenesis.
Chen et al. demonstrate that RANK is expressed in bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and is decreased during
osteogenic differentiation. RANK silencing significantly promotes,
while overexpression suppresses, the osteoblast differentiation of
BMSCs in vitro. Mice with a conditional knock-out of RANK in MSCs
(Prx1-Cre: RANKflox/flox) show a significant increase of osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation. Interestingly, in an ovariectomized mouse model, RANK conditional knock-out mice exhibit
resistance to ovariectomy-induced bone loss relative to the shamoperated mice. This study reveals that RANKL forward signaling in
BMSCs functions as a negative regulator in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (Fig. 1).
RANKL belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family and its
bidirectional signaling has been indicated.6,7 The most recent
study by Yuki Ikeuchi et al. provided evidence for RANKL reverse
signaling in the coupling of bone resorption and formation.8 RANK
in small extracellular vesicles, secreted from the maturing
osteoclasts, binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes osteoblast
differentiation by triggering RANKL reverse signaling, which
activates runt-related transcription factor 2 (Fig. 1). In vivo, the
authors also establish a mouse model (RANKLP29A) to inhibit
RANKL reverse signaling but not forward signaling. Bone
formation is disrupted in RANKLP29A mice compared with wildtype mice after recombinant RANKL is administered. At last, the
authors show that targeting RANKL reverse signaling prevents
decreased bone formation by compensating for the shortage of
coupling signals. The results suggest that RANKL reverse signaling
is involved in the bone formation as a potential pharmacological
target.

Fig. 1 Mechanism of RANKL signaling in osteoblast differentiation. RANKL signaling drives osteoclastogenesis. In BMSCs, RANKL binding to
RANK activates RANKL forward signaling, which inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Maturing osteoclasts secrete vesicular RANK which
activates RANKL reverse signaling in osteoblasts and promotes osteoblast differentiation. During osteoblastogenesis, the RANK expression is
reduced and RANKL forward signaling on osteoblast differentiation is relieved

These two studies convincingly demonstrate the functions of
RANKL-RANK forward and reverse signaling in the regulation of
osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Chen et al. show
that RANKL binds to RANK and inhibits osteoblastogenesis, while
Yuki et al. demonstrate that vesicular RANK from maturing
osteoclasts promotes osteoblastogenesis for the bone formation
through RANKL reverse signaling. Specifically, RANKL forward
signaling activates NF-κB for degradation of β-catenin. In RANKL
reverse signaling, a proline-rich motif in the RANKL cytoplasmic
tail interacts with Src homology 3 domains and activates PI3K.
In summary, these two reports provide evidence that RANKLRANK forward and reverse signaling regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. The forward signaling inhibits
osteogenic differentiation and the reverse signaling promotes
osteoblast differentiation for bone formation (Fig. 1). Not only do
the findings discover the novel regulatory roles of RANKL-RANK
signaling in osteoblastogenesis but also they provide a potential
pharmacological target in an anabolic therapy.
