Validation of the theoretical domains framework
for use in behaviour change and implementation
research
James Cane1, Denise O’Connor2 and Susan Michie3*
Abstract
Background: An integrative theoretical framework, developed for cross-disciplinary implementation and other
behaviour change research, has been applied across a wide range of clinical situations. This study tests the validity
of this framework.
Methods: Validity was investigated by behavioural experts sorting 112 unique theoretical constructs using closed
and open sort tasks. The extent of replication was tested by Discriminant Content Validation and Fuzzy Cluster
Analysis.
Results: There was good support for a refinement of the framework comprising 14 domains of theoretical
constructs (average silhouette value 0.29): ‘Knowledge’, ‘Skills’, ‘Social/Professional Role and Identity’, ‘Beliefs about
Capabilities’, ‘Optimism’, ‘Beliefs about Consequences’, ‘Reinforcement’, ‘Intentions’, ‘Goals’, ‘Memory, Attention and
Decision Processes’, ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Social Influences’, ‘Emotions’, and ‘Behavioural
Regulation’.
Conclusions: The refined Theoretical Domains Framework has a strengthened empirical base and provides a
method for theoretically assessing implementation problems, as well as professional and other health-related
behaviours as a basis for intervention development.
Keywords: Theoretical domains framework, Behaviour, Change, Implementation, Validation, Theory
Background
Behaviour change is key to improving healthcare and
health outcomes. Behaviours may be those of healthcare
workers, such as implementation of evidence-based practice, of patients, such as medication adherence, or of the
general population, such as smoking cessation and increasing physical activity. Despite high-level recommendations to improve implementation of evidence-based
practice [1,2] and a rapidly developing field of implementation science, implementation remains variable, with numerous organisational and individual factors influencing
healthcare workers’ behaviour. These factors include the
availability of evidence, its relevance to practice, the
dissemination of evidence and guidelines, individual
motivation, the ability to keep up with current
changes, clarity of roles and practice, and the culture
of specific healthcare practices [3,4].
Improving implementation of evidence-based practice
by healthcare workers depends on changing multiple
behaviours of multiple types of people (e.g., health professionals, managers, administrators) [5]. Changing behaviour is not easy, but is more effective if interventions
are based on evidence-based principles of behaviour
change [6]. These principles form part of many theories
of behaviour change, but are seldom drawn on in
designing and evaluating implementation interventions.
There is some evidence that behaviour change interventions informed by theory are more effective than those
that are not [7,8]. Designing interventions on the basis
of practitioner or researcher intuition rather than theory
precludes the possibility of understanding the behaviour
change processes that underlie effective interventions

and of applying this knowledge to inform the design of
future interventions. This is also the case where theory is
cited but poorly applied to intervention development [9].
In a review of 235 guideline development and implementation studies, only 22.5% were judged to have
used theories of behaviour change, and 16.6% of studies using a single theory [10]. A further 4.3% used only
selected constructs from theories; across the majority
of studies there was no clear rationale for theory use.
While use of a single theory may be appropriate and
lends itself to theory testing, in many cases the selection has not been justified and the theory is not tested
[9]. If theory selection is not informed by a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the implementation
or other behavioural problem, there is a risk of missing relevant theoretical constructs or including irrelevant ones. A second problem in applying theory to
intervention design stems from basing interventions on
several theories with overlapping theoretical constructs
[11,12]. This makes it difficult to identify the specific
processes underlying successful behaviour change.
To overcome such problems, an integrative framework of theories of behaviour change was developed
by 18 psychological theorists in collaboration with 16
health service researchers and 30 health psychologists
[13]. The aim of the Theoretical Domains Framework
(TDF) was to simplify and integrate a plethora of behaviour change theories and make theory more accessible to, and usable by, other disciplines. The group
identified 33 theories and 128 key theoretical constructs related to behaviour change and synthesised
them into a single framework to assess implementation
and other behavioural problems and inform intervention design. They used a six stage consensus approach:
identifying theories and theoretical constructs relevant to
behaviour change, where a theoretical construct was
defined as ‘a concept specially devised to be part of a theory’ [13]; simplifying these resulting constructs into overarching theoretical domains, where a theoretical domain
was defined as ‘a group of related theoretical constructs’ [13]; evaluating the importance of the theoretical domains; conducting an interdisciplinary evaluation
and synthesis of the domains and constructs; validating
the domain list; and piloting interview questions relevant to the constructs and domains. This resulted in
12 theoretical domains and exemplar questions for
each to use in interviews or focus groups to provide a
comprehensive theoretical assessment of implementation problems.
This framework has been used by research teams
across several healthcare systems to explain implementation problems and inform implementation interventions.
For example, in Australia it has been used to identify the
barriers and enablers to the implementation of evidencebased guidelines for acute low back pain [14,15] and develop theory-informed behaviour change interventions
[16]. In the UK, examples include studies of the barriers
and levers related to hand hygiene [17]; the assessment
of theoretical domains relevant to blood transfusion
practice across different contexts including neonatal and
adult intensive care units [18,19]; and identifying difficulties in implementing guidelines relating to schizophrenia
[20]. In Denmark, it has been used to understand behaviour in the implementation of tobacco use prevention
and counselling guidelines amongst dental providers
[21]. Most of this research has used interviews and focus
groups that are resource intensive; a questionnaire measure is currently being developed by the authors. This will
facilitate research investigating prediction of implementation and other types of behaviour change.
This article is one in a series of articles documenting
the development and use of the TDF to advance the
science of implementation research. To inform future
use of the TDF, we conducted the current study to provide a more thorough test of the validity of the framework than was carried out in the original research. The
overall objective of the study was to examine the
content validity of the TDF. Specifically, we wanted to
confirm the optimal domain structure (number of
domains), domain content (component constructs in
each domain), and domain labels (most appropriate
names that best reflected the content of the validated
domain structure). Card sorting methodology was used
to conduct the validation of the TDF in this study. By
building on the validation process undertaken by Michie
et al. [13] the present study aimed to improve the empirical basis of this framework.
Method
Design
The study used a cross-sectional design.
Participants
Eligible participants possessed a good understanding of
behaviour change theory and were unaware of the original
framework reported in Michie et al. [13]. Potentially eligible participants were identified by systematically searching five online electronic journal databases (Web of
Science, PsychInfo, CINAHL Plus, Ingenta Connect, JStor)
using terms ‘behaviour change’ AND ‘theory’ from 1990 to
2011, by sending email invitations through membership
mailing lists for the European Health Psychology Society,
the American Psychological Association Division of
Health Psychology, the USA’s National Institute of Health’s
Behaviour Change Consortium, the Midlands Health
Psychology Network in the UK, and by searching through
delegate lists from the 2008 to 2010 annual conferences of
the UK Society for Behavioural Medicine and British

Psychological Society’s Division of Health Psychology.
The contact details of all individuals identified as
authors on papers identified through the electronic
database searches were located via publically available
sources (e.g., searches of university and other organisation websites).
Of 101 individuals who asked for full information about
the study, 61 expressed an interest in taking part and were
sent links to one of the online tasks; 37 of these (61%)
completed their assigned task. The majority were from the
UK (16), with the remaining participants being from the
Netherlands (8), USA (2), Ireland (2), Australia (2), Italy
(2), Portugal (1), South Africa (1), Greece (1), Germany
(1), and Switzerland (1). The 27 women and 10 men had a
mean age of 36.54 years (range 22 to 62).
The sample size for the tasks was based on estimates
of between six and 36 participants shown as sufficient
for sort and cluster analysis tasks [22-28]. For contentvalidation tasks, such as those proposed in the closed
sort task, two to 24 participants have been shown to be
sufficient [29-32], with more than five participants reducing the influence of rater outliers [33].
Evaluating the framework
To evaluate the original framework, a three step method
was used:
Step one: Identify the optimal number of domains by
sort task methods.
Step two: Establish domain content by identifying the
most suitable construct allocation to each of the domains.
Step three: Finalise domain labels by identifying the most
appropriate labels for new domains (labels for domains
that replicated the original ones were retained).
Sort task methodology
Two types of sort task were used: an open sort task and
a closed sort task (see Figure 1). In the open sort task,
participants were asked to sort constructs into groups of
their choice and label these groups according to their
content. The optimal grouping of constructs into
domains was identified using Fuzzy Cluster Analysis [34],
whereby sorting patterns across individual participants
could be aggregated into clusters. This cluster technique
has the benefit over the more commonly used k-means
Figure 1 Steps taken to validate the Theoretical Domains Framework.
Cane et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:37 Page 3 of 17

and k-medoid cluster analysis, and other grouping methods, in that it allocates a membership value (in the form
of a probability value) for each possible construct-cluster
pairing rather than simply assigning a construct to a single
cluster, thereby the membership of items to more than
one group could be assessed. The results obtained from
the open sort task and Fuzzy Cluster Analysis were used
to identify the optimal domain structure (step one), the
content of new domains (step two), and the most appropriate domain labels, based on the group names given
by participants (step three). In the closed sort task, participants were asked to sort constructs into the domains
defined in the original framework and rate their confidence in their allocation of each construct to a domain.
The extent to which participants believed each construct belonged to the original 12 domains was assessed
by Discriminant Content Validation (DCV) methods.
DCV methods are able to examine the confidence of
relationship between a single item and a particular
domain [35]. The results from the closed sort task were
used to identify any domains containing constructs with
high confidence ratings and good agreement between
participants (step one), and the constructs allocated to
these domains (step two). Both types of sort task
informed step one because it was considered important
to include domains that developed naturally from the
construct groupings (as informed by the open sort task),
and to include domains to which there was good agreement across participants in the confidence of construct
allocation to these domains (as informed by the closed
sort task). To achieve this, the open sort task results
were used to identify the domains based on the clusters
formed in the open sort task; the closed sort results
were then used to identify any additional domains for
which there was good agreement and confidence in
assigning constructs to these domains.
Materials
There were 112 unique constructs (see Additional file 1),
after 12 duplicates from the original framework were
removed (participants had the opportunity to sort each
construct to multiple domains). Definitions for the
domains and constructs were selected or constructed
from dictionaries, (e.g., American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology [36]), and internet sources
(e.g., www.oed.com). Each definition was evaluated by
the authors of the original framework and definitions
were agreed by consensus. The sort tasks were delivered
via an online computer program with constructs displayed at the top of the computer screen. For the open
sort task, 24 unlabelled boxes were displayed below the
construct item window into which the participants could
sort the constructs. Above each box a space was given so
that labels and descriptions for each group created could
be given. For the closed sort task, 12 labeled boxes were
displayed, each described by a single domain label from
the original framework. In both tasks, individual constructs could be assigned to multiple boxes and for every
allocation a confidence rating was requested using a
drop-down menu (from 1 – ‘not at all confident’ to 10 –
‘extremely confident’). Constructs were presented in random order that was determined by the online program
for each participant. Definitions for each construct (open
and closed sort tasks) and domain (for closed sort task
only) were available when the participant hovered over
the word with their mouse. Participants were asked,
through open-ended questions, to record the length of
time they had been involved in using behaviour change
theories, the context in which they used them (e.g., teaching, research, etc.) and their expertise in behaviour
change theory and in using behaviour change interventions (1 – ‘A great deal’, 2 – ‘quite a lot’, 3 – ’some’, 4 – ‘a
little’, 5 – ’none’).
Procedure
Invitations were emailed to potentially eligible participants giving a brief overview of the study and inquiring
as to their expertise. If they considered themselves to
have expertise in behaviour change theory and reported
not knowing about the original framework, they were
invited to participate and emailed the relevant web link
to the task they were allocated to. Eligible participants
were alternately allocated to an open or closed sort task
based on the order in which they contacted the
researchers. To avoid contamination of results across
tasks, each participant was allocated to, and completed,
only the closed sort task or the open sort task. For both
tasks, an information screen gave a brief background to
the study and asked for consent to take part. Participants
were given detailed instructions on how to complete
their task (see Additional file 2) before completing the
sort task they were assigned to. There was no time limit.
In both tasks, participants were asked to familiarise
themselves with the construct definitions and, in the
closed sort task only, the domain definitions. In the open
sort task, participants were asked to sort the constructs
into groups based on their semantic similarity using as
many groups as they wanted to (up to 24) and were
asked to provide a label for each group created. Participants could also provide a description for each group if
they felt it was necessary. In the closed sort task, participants were asked to assign each construct to one or
more of the 12 labelled domain boxes that they thought
were most appropriate. Across both tasks, participants
were asked to give confidence ratings for each assignment; if an item was not allocated to a domain it automatically received a confidence rating of 0. For both
tasks, participants were made aware that they could

http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/37

allocate each construct to multiple groups. After assigning all constructs, participants were asked to review their
construct allocations and to change any allocations if
they wished to. On completion, participants were given
further information about the project.
Data analysis
Data were collected using MySQL databases. For the
open sort task, data were the construct-group allocations, confidence ratings, and group labels allocated by
the participant. For the closed sort task data were the
construct-group allocations and confidence ratings.
Open sort
To examine the optimal clustering of constructs (step
one: identify domains), the open sort data were first
organised into a dissimilarity matrix for each participant.
Construct pairs, consisting of all possible construct-byconstruct combinations, were assigned 0 if they were
placed in the same group and 1 if they were placed in a
different group. Agreement across these individual
matrices was assessed using Mantel Correlations and
Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance, W [37] using
CADM.global and CADM.post from the ‘ape’ package
[38] in the R statistics program [39]. Mantel Correlations
determine the extent to which an individual participants’
matrix correlates with other participants’ matrices and
were used to identify any potential outlying sort patterns
that should be excluded from subsequent analysis. An
individual’s matrix is considered to be an outlier when it
negatively correlates with the other participants’ matrices [40]. Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance provides
an indication of the overall concordance across all participants’ sort patterns, Kendall’s W ranges from 1 to 0
[37], where 1 equals complete agreement in sorting patterns and 0 equals no agreement across sorting patterns.
To identify the clusters formed through these sorting
patterns, means were calculated for each construct
pairing across individual matrices to form a single,
aggregated dissimilarity matrix. Fuzzy Cluster Analysis
of this matrix, using the FANNY algorithm [34,41] in the
R statistics program, led to a membership value assigned
to each construct-cluster pairing. These membership
values, converted into percentages, serve as an indication of the extent to which a construct belongs to a
particular cluster. Values near 100% indicate a high
probability of association with a cluster and values near
0% indicate a low probability of association. Using these
values, construct membership to multiple domains can
be assessed (e.g., construct x might have 53% membership to cluster y and 47% membership to cluster z).
Constructs were then allocated to the cluster with
which it has the highest membership value (known as a
‘hard’ cluster solution and comparable to outputs of the
k-means and k-medoid cluster methods). The fit of constructs within the clusters was calculated by silhouette
values (s(i)) [42]. Silhouette values are calculated for
each construct and range from +1, indicating strong association with a cluster and distance from neighboring
clusters, through 0, indicating no distinct association
with clusters, to −1, indicating that a construct is probably assigned to the wrong cluster and should be considered as belonging to the neighbouring cluster [42]. The
average silhouette values (ave s(i)) across construct items
within a cluster indicates how well a cluster is defined,
and the overall average of silhouette values across clusters can be used to compare cluster solutions of different
sizes.
The optimal outcome of the cluster analysis is to
achieve the highest average silhouette value with the
fewest clusters. It has been argued that average cluster
silhouette values greater than 0.70 indicate a strong
structure, whilst average silhouette values below 0.50 indicate weak structures and silhouette values <0.25 indicate that there is little evidence for any reliable structure
[34]. Informed by these cutoff values, we considered that
a construct with a silhouette value <0.25 in relation to a
cluster did not belong to that cluster.
In addition to identifying the optimal domain structure, the open sort results were used to identify the extent to which the clusters replicated the construct
allocation in the original framework when domain labels
were not provided (step two: establish domain content).
Congruence was quantified as the percentage of constructs from the original framework domain remaining
in a cluster solution (e.g., if domain m contained constructs x, y, and z and the cluster contained only x and
z, then congruence was 67%). If the structure of the
domains identified in the Fuzzy Cluster Analysis was
considerably different from that of the original framework, confidence ratings would be used for secondary
analysis to infer construct allocation to the new domains
formed.
The group labels given by participants in the open sort
task were organised according to their similarity and the
frequency that they occurred across participants noted.
Those labels that occurred frequently and were related
to the content of the newly-formed domains were used
to inform newly-formed domain labels (step three: finalise domain labels).
Closed sort
To identify pre-existing domains that might also be considered for inclusion in the framework (step one: identify
domains), the strength and agreement of construct allocations to pre-existing domains from the closed sort task
were examined. Confidence ratings for each construct x
domain pairing, excluding those that had no confidence
Cane et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:37 Page 5 of 17
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/37

ratings, were applied to a table. To examine the agreement of these construct x domain ratings and construct
assignment across participants, two-way intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) measures of consistency were
used within each domain [43]. In line with previous research we classified ICC values <0.21 as indicating poor
agreement, values between 0.21 to 0.40 as fair agreement, values between 0.41 to 0.60 as moderate agreement, and values of ≥0.61 as good to excellent
agreement [44]. ICC values were used as an indication of
the agreement in assignments and ratings across participants, but were not used to influence the final domain
content.
To identify the strength of construct assignment to
particular domains, DCV methods were used with onesample t-tests on the participants’ confidence ratings
against the value zero. A construct was considered as
belonging to a domain if its mean confidence rating
across participants was significantly greater than zero
(p < 0.05) following the adoption of Hochberg’s correction [45] (see [29,35] for similar methods). Hochberg’s
correction was used to control for the family-wise
error rate given the number of tests used. Whilst this
approach may not be considered a conventional use of
one-sample t-tests, it provides a suitable criterion for
inclusion and exclusion of constructs to a particular
domain over and above the use of a subjective cut-off
value. To ensure that domains with highly-rated, relevant constructs assigned to them were considered for
inclusion in the framework, domains containing two or
more constructs with ratings significantly greater than
zero were considered. These constructs were also used
to inform construct allocation to pre-existing domains
(step two: establish domain content). The allocation of
constructs to domains in the closed sort task was
compared with construct allocation in the original
framework to identify the extent of congruence between assigned constructs when domain labels were
available. Here congruence was quantified as the percentage of constructs from the original framework domain that were also in that domain within this study.
Ethical approval
The study was approved by University College London’s
Psychology Department Ethics Committee [STF/2007/
003], and each participant gave full informed consent
prior to participating.
Results
Eighteen participants completed the closed sort task and
19 the open sort task. All participants indicated that they
had experience of behaviour change theory through either research, clinical practice, or teaching (or a combination of these). Participants reported working with
behaviour change theory for a mean of 9.74 (SD = 9.14)
years and rated both their expertise in behaviour change
theory and in delivering behaviour change interventions
as 1.97 (SD = 0.64) and 2.46 (SD = 0.90), respectively, as
measured on five-point scales (lower score indicates
more expertise).
Sample size suitability and open sort pattern
concordance
Post-hoc power analysis for the closed sort task revealed
that there was sufficient power (82%) with the final sample size of 18 to detect a mean rating of 1.53 (SD = 2.42,
d = 0.63) as significant within a one-tailed one-sample
t-test with α = 0.05. The mean rating used in the power
analysis was based on the mean of confidence ratings
across all variables included in the closed sort analyses.
For the open sort task, Mantel Correlation analysis
indicated that all participants’ matrices were positively
correlated, with aggregated Mantel correlation values
for each participant ranging from 0.14 to 0.25 (see
Additional file 3). Therefore none of the participants’
sort patterns were considered as outliers, and matrices
from all 19 participants were included in the final analysis. The overall concordance of sorting patterns was
W = 0.22, p = 0.01, reflecting the unconstrained nature
of this task and its high number of variables.
Step one: identify domains
In the open sort task, participants created on average
13.59 (SD = 3.61) groups. To identify the optimal fit for
the cluster patterns based on the groups created by the
participants, silhouette values for solutions of minimum
two and maximum 18 clusters were examined. Analysis
revealed the 13-cluster solution to be the most appropriate fit, achieving the highest overall average silhouette value of 0.29 (Figure 2 shows the relative overall
silhouette values plotted for each cluster solution). The
construct allocation within the ‘hard’ version of the
13-cluster solution, whereby each construct is allocated
to only one domain, is presented in Table 1 next to
the domains they most closely represent (see ‘Open
sort task construct clusters’ and see Additional file 4
for related silhouette values).
Within the 13 cluster solution, three of the original
domains, ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’, ‘Beliefs about Consequences’, and ‘Motivation and Goals’, formed two clusters
each. Four of the 13 clusters showed low average silhouette values (<0.25), one of the clusters arising from the
‘Motivation and Goals’ domain, also ‘Memory, Attention,
and Decision Processes’, ‘Environmental Context and
Resources’, and ‘Behavioural Regulation’. This was due to
the inclusion of a number of constructs that had low (or
negative) silhouette values, indicating that these constructs were not closely grouped with the other
Cane et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:37 Page 6 of 17
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/37

constructs within these clusters. To examine the impact
of these low value constructs, they were removed and the
average silhouette values of the clusters were recalculated. After removal, 10 clusters had average silhouette
values greater than 0.25 (see Additional file 4, column 7)
with the average silhouette value across these 10 domains
equal to 0.47 and the concordance across sorting patterns increasing to W = 0.34 (p = 0.01). Three clusters
remained with silhouettes below 0.25, ‘Environmental
Context and Resources’, ‘Memory, Attention, and Decision Processes’, and ‘Behavioural Regulation’. Whilst
these clusters showed relatively weak cluster formations
in the open sort, the confidence ratings in the closed sort
indicated that when the domain labels were apparent the
confidence ratings of allocated constructs were sufficient
to form domains. Therefore, these three domains were
considered important to retain in the framework. Also,
there was no cluster indicative of the domain of ‘Knowledge’ in the 13 cluster solution, with all constructs from
the original ‘Knowledge’ domain allocated to alternative
clusters; the constructs ‘Knowledge’ and ‘Knowledge of
task environment’ were allocated to the ‘Environmental
Context and Resources’ cluster, ‘Mindsets’ was allocated
to one of the clusters arising from the ‘Beliefs about
Capabilities’ domain, ‘Schemas’ was allocated to the
‘Memory, Attention and Decision Processes’ cluster and
‘Procedural knowledge’ was allocated to the ‘Skills’ cluster. However, within these construct reassignments only
‘Procedural Knowledge’ attained a silhouette value equal
to or greater than 0.25 (all other knowledge-related constructs <0.23). In contrast, within the closed sort task
the confidence ratings of three knowledge-related constructs, ‘Knowledge’, ‘Knowledge of Task Environment’
and ‘Procedural Knowledge’ indicated that knowledge
might form a separate domain if the label ‘Knowledge’
was available (confidence ratings >6.32 across these
three constructs). Therefore, it was considered that the
‘Knowledge’ should be included when it was thought to
be important in the specific context.
Based on the results across both tasks, 14 domains
were specified through this first step. Eight domains were
similar to the original framework domains: ‘Knowledge’,
‘Skills’, ‘Social/Professional Role and Identity’, ‘Memory,
Attention and Decision Processes’, ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Social Influences’, ‘Emotion’, and ‘Behavioural Regulation’. The domains ‘Beliefs about
Capabilities’, ‘Beliefs about Consequences’, and ‘Motivation and Goals’ were retained but were divided into six
new clusters. The domain of ‘Nature of the Behaviours’
was removed because it was not represented in the open
sort by any single cluster solution and only had one construct assigned to it in the closed sort task.

50%) and fair ICCs (0.26 to 0.39). The domains of ‘Behavioural Regulation’, ‘Nature of the Behaviours’, and
‘Beliefs about Consequences’ showed both low congruence between the original constructs and those assigned
to these domains (<27%) and low ICCs (0.07 to 0.25).
This was due in part to the low number of constructs
assigned to these domains. ‘Behavioural Regulation’ only
had two constructs out of the original ten (Self-monitoring, and Action planning) that were rated as belonging
to the domain. ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ only had one
construct (Routine/automatic/habit) included from the
original six constructs. ‘Beliefs about Consequences’ only
had five of the constructs included from the original
framework. Only constructs that achieved significance in
the closed sort after Hochberg correction were allocated
to these pre-existing domains from the original
framework.
For the newly formed clusters arising from ‘Motivation
and Goals’ (two clusters), ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’ (one
cluster), and ‘Beliefs about Consequences’ (one cluster),
construct allocation was informed by the constructs
assigned to these clusters in the open sort task that
achieved individual construct silhouette values greater
than 0.25.
To identify if any constructs should be considered for
multiple allocation to domains the membership values
from the Fuzzy Cluster Analysis were examined. This
revealed that the majority of constructs (74/112) were
strongly associated with only one cluster (i.e., showed
membership values over 80% to one specific cluster, see
Additional file 5). A further 32 constructs showed moderately high associations with one cluster (memberships
values between 28% to 79%), with the remaining proportion of memberships for these constructs spread over
other clusters. Only eight constructs had the greatest
proportion of their membership values split across at
least two clusters, indicating possible multiple domain
memberships, these were ‘Knowledge’, ‘Coping strategies’,
‘Empowerment’, ‘Anticipated regret’, ‘Negotiation’, ‘Moderators of the intention-behaviour gap’, ‘Routine/automatic/habit’, and ‘Past behaviour’. However, none of the
multiple memberships indicated in the open sort results
were replicated in the closed sort task where three different constructs, ‘Professional confidence’, ‘Beliefs’, and
‘Group identity’, were allocated to multiple domains.
Given lack of agreement across the two tasks, only the
multiple allocations shown in the closed sort task or multiple allocations that occurred through the construct selection process (i.e., using the closed sort for predefined
domains and using the open sort for new domains) were
used in the final framework. Using this approach, six
constructs were allocated to more than one domain: (the
domains that constructs are allocated to are shown in
parenthesis) ‘Action planning’ (Goals and Behavioural
Regulation), ‘Beliefs’ (Beliefs about Consequences and
Beliefs about Capabilities), ‘Consequents’ (Beliefs about
Consequences and Reinforcement), ‘Group identity’ (Social/Professional Role and Identity and Social Influences),
‘Identity’ (Social/Professional Role and Identity and Optimism), and ‘Professional confidence’ (Social/Professional
Role and Identity and Beliefs about Capabilities).
Step three: finalise domain labels
Fifteen of the 19 open sort participants provided labels
for the groups they created. The majority of labels were
similar to those in the original framework: (number of
participants giving that label shown in parenthesis):
Knowledge (4), Skills (5), Intentions (7), Goals (6), Emotion (9), Cognitive-related (8), Beliefs (5), Beliefs about
Capabilities (7), Outcomes (6), Environment-related (6),
Organisational (7), Models / Theories (8), Learning /
Reinforcement (7), Self-Regulation (3), Consequences
(3), Social / Group (14), and Planning (2). Examples of
other labels that could not be categorized (i.e., labels
given by only one participant) included ‘Techniques’, ‘Barriers’, ‘Awareness’, ‘Reviewing’, and ‘Persistence’. Given the
similarity between the labels provided in the open sort
task and the labels used in the original framework, those
domains that were retained with only minor modification
were allocated their respective label used in the original
framework. The labels for the newly developed domains
were based on the frequency of labels and the domain
content: these were Intentions, Goals, Reinforcement,
and Optimism. The domain label of ‘Emotion’ was pluralised to ‘Emotions’ to bring in line with the other domain
labels and to ensure that it clearly represented the range
of emotions that were included as component constructs.
Therefore, the final labels chosen to represent the 14
domains were: ‘Knowledge’, ‘Skills’, ‘Social/Professional
Role and Identity’, ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’, ‘Optimism’,
‘Beliefs about Consequences’, ‘Reinforcement’, ‘Intentions’,
‘Goals’, ‘Memory, Attention and Decision Processes’, ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Social Influences’,
‘Emotions’, and ‘Behavioural Regulation’.
The refined framework
The refined framework contains 14 domains and 84
component constructs (the number of component constructs in each domain is defined in brackets): ‘Knowledge’ (3), ‘Skills’ (7), ‘Social/Professional Role and
Identity’ (9), ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’ (8), ‘Optimism’
(4), ‘Beliefs about Consequences’ (5), ‘Reinforcement’ (7),
‘Intentions’ (3), ‘Goals’ (6), ‘Memory, Attention and Decision Processes’ (5), ‘Environmental Context and
Resources’ (6), ‘Social Influences’ (11), ‘Emotions’ (7), and
‘Behavioural Regulation’ (3). The full version of the new
framework is shown in Table 2.

Discussion
This validation study, using open and closed sort tasks,
has shown good support for the basic structure of the
TDF and led to refinements producing 14 domains:
‘Knowledge’, ‘Skills’, ‘Social/Professional Role and Identity’,
‘Beliefs about Capabilities’, ‘Optimism’, ‘Beliefs about Consequences’, ‘Reinforcement’, ‘Intentions’, ‘Goals’, ‘Memory,
Attention and Decision Processes’, ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Social Influences’, ‘Emotions’, and
‘Behavioural Regulation’. There are three key advantages
of this framework. First, there is comprehensive coverage
of possible influences on behavior. Second, there is clarity about each kind of influence, as a result of each domain being specified by component constructs. Third,
the framework makes links between theories of behaviour change and techniques of behaviour change to address implementation problems. The framework can be
applied by gathering either qualitative data (interviews
or focus groups) or quantitative data (e.g., by questionnaires). The findings have strengthened the evidence for
the structure and content of the domains, increasing
confidence in the usefulness of the TDF as an approach
to assessing implementation and other behaviour problems, and laying the foundation for theoretically
informed interventions.
To the authors’ knowledge, Fuzzy Cluster Analysis and
Discriminant Content Validity have not been used in
combination to determine the validity of a framework
structure. By combining these methods, we have investigated the validity of the original framework both when
the original domain labels were, and were not, presented. The results from both the open and closed sort
tasks generally replicated the original framework, which
adds confidence to the validity of the framework’s
structure.
The study findings pointed to some changes in the
framework, which had good face validity. First, there
was a separation and clarification of a number of existing domains. The separation of ‘Motivation and Goals’
into two domains of ‘Intentions’ and ‘Goals’ was indicated by both the closed and open sort task results and
was particularly apparent in the labels provided by the
participants, with labels relating to ‘intentions’ and ‘goals’
amongst the most frequently used. The APA dictionary
of psychology defines a goal as ‘the end state toward
which a human or non-human animal is striving: the
purpose of an activity or endeavour.’ [36] and defines
intention as ‘a conscious decision to perform a behaviour; a resolve to act in a certain way or an impulse for
purposeful action. In experiments, intention is often
equated with goals defined by the task instructions.’ [36].
Therefore ‘Goals’ tends to refer to an end state that can
be seen as a preferred outcome, whereas ‘Intentions’ is
concerned with the resolve to initiate or terminate a
behaviour. The separation of ‘Beliefs about Consequences’ into two domains, one retaining the original
name and one termed ‘Reinforcement’, made psychological sense. The former refers to beliefs whereas the
latter refers to constructs of associative learning. There
was also a separation within the ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’ domain with a separate ‘Optimism’ domain being
formed. This separation makes psychological sense in
that the constructs in the optimism cluster concern general disposition rather than specific capabilities required
to achieve an outcome. The domain ‘Behavioural Regulation’ is clearer in the refined framework where it refers
to self-regulatory processes rather than including a mixture of self-regulation and goal-related constructs, as
was the case in the original TDF.
Second, the ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ domain was
dropped in the new framework, because its original
component constructs were not assigned to the domain
in the closed sort, and there was no cluster representing
the ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ in the open sort. This
strengthens the coherence of the new TDF because the
domain did not sit easily in the original TDF. It was
defined as the ‘Essential characteristics of the behaviour’,
had constructs relating to habit and experiences/past
behaviours, and constituted an outcome, or dependent
variable, rather than an independent variable. Whilst
understanding the nature of behaviours is absolutely key
to analyzing implementation and other behavioural problems, analysing the nature of behaviour is a different
task than analysing influences on behaviour. A complementary theoretical approach to analyzing behaviour as
a basis for intervention design has been recently developed, as part of the ‘Behaviour Change Wheel’ [46]. Previous studies that have adopted the TDF framework
have seldom used the ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ domain
[17]. Furthermore, where the domain has been used, in
relation to changing transfusion practice, it was noted
that when participants were asked questions relating to
the ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ domain they often
repeated answers that were previously given in response
to questions relating to the ‘Behavioural Regulation’ domain [19], therefore making responses in respect to
‘Nature of the Behaviours’ redundant. This along with
empirical evidence shown in the present study shows a
clear indication that the ‘Nature of the Behaviours’ domain should be considered differently to the components of the TDF.
In designing interventions, the TDF fits well with the
Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [46] referred to above.
The BCW characterises the target behavior in terms of
Capability, Opportunity and Motivation (the COM-B system in the Behaviour Change Wheel), with Capability
divided into psychological and physical capability, Opportunity divided into social and physical opportunity and

starting with a behavioural analysis such as this, intervention designers can be selective about the domains they investigate to inform the nature of the intervention.
Research using the TDF has identified lack of knowledge as a potential barrier to a number of professional
health behaviours, including hand hygiene [17], changing
transfusion practice [19], and the adoption of tobacco
use cessation counseling in dental practices [21]. However, for most health-related behaviours that are the
target of theoretically-based behaviour change interventions (e.g., smoking, healthy eating, physical activity),
knowledge is not an important source of variance [47-
52]. This may be why participants did not identify a
separate domain for knowledge, but that it has been
identified as an important influence on some health professional behaviours. We therefore recommend that
knowledge be assessed along with the other TDF
domains.
Of the original 112 unique constructs in the TDF, 34
have been removed. They appear to be a mixture of
rather vague constructs (e.g., Mindsets), very general
constructs (e.g., Review), ambiguous constructs (e.g.,
Commitment), and infrequently used constructs in
behaviour change theory (e.g., Generating alternatives).
Because constructs that are ‘poorly defined’, ‘undifferentiated’, and ‘imprecisely partitioned’ have previously been
found to influence the content validity of assessment
instruments [53], their exclusion from the refined framework seems warranted. The remaining constructs stand
as a more defined, focused set of constructs that are
more relevant to behaviour change theory and more precisely partitioned into domains. Within these remaining
constructs, there are also a number of constructs that
appear in more than one domain. Such allocations indicate the relevance of constructs across different domain
contexts. For example, ‘Action Planning’ appears in both
the ‘Goals’ domain and the ‘Behavioural Regulation’ domain and can be considered as being influential in
achieving a particular goal (e.g. I plan to achieve goal
x through specific actions) and also in regulating behaviour (e.g. in a certain situation I plan to behave in
a particular way).
Two domains showed weak clustering: ‘Environmental
Context and Resources’ and ‘Behavioural Regulation’.
However, these domains, alongside the domain of
‘Knowledge’, were comprised of constructs consistently
assigned to them when the original domain labels were
presented in the closed sort task. This suggests that
people are clear about the constructs within these
domains when the domain labels are present. A second
limitation is that the refined framework is limited to the
constructs identified in the original framework. Whilst
the current range of component constructs is quite extensive, it does not cover all theories of behaviour
change [54], and future research is likely to identify
others that are important to behaviour change. Just as
the current framework is an advance on the 2005
version, so future work is likely to improve it further.
The issue of how to evaluate appropriateness and quality
of theories in given contexts is an under-researched area,
but one that is beginning to be addressed [54].
Conclusions
Through a three-step validation process, the present
research has identified a refined version of the original
TDF. This refined framework contains 14 domains and
84 component constructs. The strength of the framework validation stems from the methods used. Both the
closed and open sort task methods alongside DCV and
Fuzzy Cluster Analysis have provided complementary
methods for examining the structure of the original
framework. DCV methods assessed the confidence of
allocation of constructs to the described domains, and
the Fuzzy Cluster Analysis led to a refinement of the
structure of the framework. The TDF has proved useful
across a number of healthcare systems and this empirically-based refinement lays the basis for stronger explanatory and predictive power, and therefore increased
usefulness in informing interventions to improve implementation and bring about other behaviour change.
