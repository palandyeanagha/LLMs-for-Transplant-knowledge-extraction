Abstract
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused
by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has attracted increasing worldwide attention.
Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by
moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19.
However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19-
related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral
infection per se or other coexisting conditions, such as the use
of potentially hepatotoxic drugs and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndromeinduced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Based on the
current evidence from case reports and case series, this review
article focuses on the demographic and clinical characteristics,
potential mechanisms, and treatment options for COVID-19-
related liver dysfunction. This review also describes the geographical and demographic distribution of COVID-19-related
liver dysfunction, as well as possible underlying mechanisms
linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, in order to facilitate
future drug development, prevention, and control measures
for COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has become a serious threat to global public health.1,2
Although the virus appears to be only partially similar to
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, all of these viral
infections are responsible for severe and potentially lethal
acute respiratory syndromes in humans.3 Unfortunately, to
date, there are no specific/targeted drugs, or vaccines, and
the number of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is growing in
many parts of the world. The world and China map showing
the geographical distribution of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is shown in Figure 1; the cut-off date for this
data extraction was March 5, 2020.4
Surprisingly, in addition to the acute respiratory symptoms, patients with COVID-19 also have varying degrees of
liver damage/dysfunction. For example, Chen et al.5 showed
that more than a third of COVID-19 patients have some liver
function test abnormalities. Most of these infected patients
had mild-to-moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
levels; one patient had severely elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L, AST of 1445 U/L).5 Since COVID-19-
related liver dysfunction is now attracting widespread attention, this review discusses the epidemiological characteristics, the potential mechanisms, and the treatment options
for liver dysfunction induced by COVID-19.
Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19-related
liver dysfunction
To better understand the distribution of COVID-19-related
liver dysfunction in different regions of the world, we
searched the available literature between December 11,
2019 and February 20, 2020. The literature search focused
on initial case reports and case series covering COVID-19
patients, with a clear description of liver function tests and
results. All case reports without any data on patients’ liver
function tests were excluded. Finally, we included 14 eligible
studies, including 5 case reports (Table 1) and 9 case series
(Table 2).5–18 By reviewing these 14 studies, we have

described geographical and demographic characteristics of
COVID-19-related liver dysfunction (as summarized below).
Geographical distribution of COVID-19-related liver
dysfunction
In two Chinese multicenter surveys, one of which was led by
the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,
including 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020 and the other was led by the
First Hospital of Lanzhou University including 7 hospitals, a
considerable number of patients with COVID-19 had some
abnormalities in liver function tests.11,16 In particular, 6.2%
to 22.2% of patients had increased serum AST levels (Fig. 2)
and 21.3% to 28.1% of patients had increased serum ALT
levels, respectively.11,16 Of the six studies performed in
Wuhan, China,5,13–15,17,18 only four included data on the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function test results.
Specifically, in these four studies, the proportion of infected
patients with increased serum AST levels ranged from 24.1%
to 36.6% (Fig. 2).5,13,17,18 In a survey from Zhejiang Province, China, the proportion of patients with increased serum
AST levels was only 16.1%, whereas the proportion of those
with increased serum ALT levels was not specified.12 It seems
likely that the proportion of infected patients with increased
serum AST levels in Wuhan (i.e. the area in which the epidemic of COVID-19 started) is much greater than cases
reported outside Wuhan. It is plausible to speculate that
there may have been a higher viral load of COVID-19 in

exposed patients in Wuhan, where the infection began and
was concentrated in a greater proportion of the population.
Sex distribution of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction
A total of six case series reporting the percentage of abnormal
liver function test results amongst COVID-19 patients suggested that the proportion of infected men with increased
serum AST levels was higher than that observed in infected
women.5,11–13,16,17 In fact, in these case series, the proportions of infected men with increased serum AST levels were,
respectively, 68.7%, 58.2%, 58.1%, 72.4%, 62.8% and
73.2%, whereas the proportions of infected women were,
respectively, 31.3%, 41.8%, 41.9%, 27.6%, 37.2% and
26.8%. It is possible to hypothesize that infected men are
more predisposed to develop COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction than infected women, and we suggest that further
research is required to better understand this sex-related
difference.
Age distribution of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction
Of the five case reports, three were in children and two were
in adults. The age of children ranged from 3 months to 7
years, whereas the age of adult patients ranged from 35 to 56
years. None of these children had abnormal serum liver
enzymes and, therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that
older age is associated with a higher likelihood of liver
damage/dysfunction. However, further studies are needed
to confirm this finding. We look forward to more case reports/
case series on COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction in
different age groups in the future.
Putative mechanisms of COVID-19-related liver
dysfunction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2-mediated
liver dysfunction
Whether SARS-CoV-2 has direct adverse effects on liver
function is currently not known. Some studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly enters alveolar epithelial cells through the human ACE2 receptor.19,20 Therefore,
the lung is considered the main target organ of SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, previous studies have found that bile duct
epithelial cells may also express ACE2 receptor at a concentration 20 times higher than in hepatocytes and these findings
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might also cause bile duct
epithelial cell damage.21,22 However, significant increases in
circulating levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or
gamma-glutamyltransferase (that may reflect bile duct
injury) have been rarely reported in COVID-19 patients.9
Liver histopathologic features from COVID-19 patients also
did not show any significant damage in hepatocytes or bile
duct cells.23 For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that
COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is more likely due to secondary liver damage than the use of hepatotoxic therapies or
the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, or multiple organ

Feng G. et al: COVID-19 and liver dysfunction

Drugs
During the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, many infected
patients have been treated with antipyretic agents. Most of
these medications contain acetaminophen, which is a drug
recognized as being able to cause significant liver damage or
induce liver failure.23 It is known that an acute ingestion of >7.5
to 10 g of acetaminophen in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in
children is likely to cause hepatotoxicity.24 Although the US
Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee has proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen from 4 to 3 g, and the maximum individual dosage from 1
to 0.65 g, (relegating 500-mg tablets to prescription status),
these recommendations have not been implemented worldwide.25 In addition, although there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment for COVID-19, many infected patients have also
been treated with some antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir,
abidol or lopinavir, which may have some hepatotoxic effects.
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome
Although many COVID-19 patients were not too unwell, this
infection in some patients has resulted in sudden deterioration,
ending in multiple organ failure. Most experts believe that the
occurrence of multiple organ failure is mainly related to the
sudden initiation of an inflammatory “storm” in the critically ill
COVID-19 patients.26 The so-called inflammatory “storm”, or
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is strongly related
to activation of both natural and cellular immunity that is triggered by COVID-19 infection.27 In fact, the virus is able to
directly induce multiple proinflammatory signals via toll-like
receptors (TLRs) and activation of killer T lymphocytes.28 The
activated T lymphocytes then attack the infected body cells,
leading to their apoptosis and necrosis, until T lymphocytes
are depleted. Damage-related pattern molecules released by
dead infected cells can further amplify some inflammatory
signals, such as TLRs. At the same time, T-lymphocyte depletion cannot control viral and bacterial infections, thereby activating multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, which lead to
macrophage activation and secondary inflammatory reactions.
Subsequently, when more inflammatory cytokines are released,
more cell damage and necrosis are observed (Fig. 3). Such a
vicious cycle is capable of causing multiple injuries, not only to
the lungs but also to the liver, heart, and kidneys.
Hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction
Hypoxia and shock induced by COVID-19-related complications (such as respiratory distress syndrome, systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, and multiple organ
failure) may also cause hepatic ischemia and hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction. Experimental data showed that hepatic
cell death and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by hypoxia
can be seen both in vivo and in vitro models of hepatic ischemia and hypoxia.29 This suggests that oxygen reduction and
lipid accumulation in hepatocytes during shock and hypoxic
conditions may lead to cell death. The subsequent marked
increase in reactive oxygen species and their peroxidation
products can act as a second messenger, activating redoxsensitive transcription factors, and further amplifying the
release of multiple proinflammatory factors, causing liver
damage.30 All the aforementioned findings suggest that
pneumonia-associated hypoxia is one of the most important
factors causing secondary liver injury in COVID-19 patients.
In summary, the COVID-19-related liver dysfunction may be
considered as the result of secondary liver damage caused
mainly by several factors, such as the use of potentially
hepatotoxic drugs, systemic inflammatory response, respiratory
distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ failure.
In addition, critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe liver
dysfunction are also more likely to have a poorer prognosis.
Treatment options for COVID-19-related liver dysfunction
Presently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection.31 Therefore, the cornerstone of COVID-19 management
is patient isolation and supportive medical care where necessary, including pulmonary ventilation and prevention of the
underlying inflammatory “storm” as well.32
From the findings discussed above, however, we believe
that it is also reasonable to explore novel treatments for
COVID-19 targeting of the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 cellular
receptor is highly expressed in human lung tissues, gastrointestinal tract, liver, vascular endothelial cells, and arterial
smooth muscle cells.33 In addition, skin, nasal cavity, and oral
mucosa basal cells also express the ACE2 receptor.27 All
organs with high expression of the ACE2 receptor may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection.34 Activation of the ACE2/Ang
Fig. 3. Schematic diagram showing the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome induced by SARS-CoV2. After the SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenic T
cells are rapidly activated, producing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. GM-CSF will
further activate CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, producing a larger
amount of IL-6 and other proinflammatory factors, and thereby inducing an inflammatory “storm” that leads to immune damage to other organs, such as the
lungs and the liver. Both IL-6 and GM-CSF are two key proinflammatory factors
that trigger the inflammatory “storm” in patients with COVID-19.

(1-7)/Mas signaling pathway or inhibition of the ACE/Ang II/
AT1R pathway could be potential pathways for the treatment of
COVID-19. For SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, both ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists might be used not
only for treating high blood pressure but also for reducing systemic inflammatory response and improving patient mortality.35
Recently, Chen et al.36 reported that glycyrrhizic acid derivatives might also have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the first-line drugs for anti-inflammatory protection in liver disease, and it has been used in
clinical practice for many years.37 In particular, glycyrrhizic
acid is a triterpene glycoside isolated from the root of the licorice plant. ACE2 is a cellular type I membrane protein that is
mostly expressed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestine.
Full-length ACE2 consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain
and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single
trans-membrane helix and a ;40-residue intracellular
segment.38 Glycyrrhizin has the potential to bind to ACE2
receptor with an estimated DG (kcal/mol) of -9, with the
binding sites of ARG-559, GLN-388, ARG-393, and ASP-30.36
Conclusions
Our review shows the following: (1) In highly epidemic areas of
COVID-19 infection, such as Wuhan, China, the proportion of
infected patients with abnormal liver function test results
(mainly elevated serum AST levels) is greater than that
observed in regions where a smaller proportion of cases of
COVID-19 infection in the population have occurred. (2) The
proportion of infected patients with elevated serum transaminase levels is higher in adults than in children and in men
than in women, respectively. However, we suggest that further
studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations.
In the meantime, we believe that the front-line medical staff
should pay attention to liver function tests in patients infected
with COVID-19. For those patients with a pre-existing history
of liver diseases (especially older patients), special attention
should be paid to monitoring hepatic changes caused by
COVID-19, whilst carefully identifying the cause of the liver
dysfunction.39 We also recommend that front-line medical staff
should assess the use of appropriate hepatoprotective therapies, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease, in
order to attenuate the potentially deleterious impact of
COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction.
