Abstract
Background Bariatric surgery contributes to the improvement in glucose metabolism that may be related to a postoperative
increase in serum bile acids (BAs). Three commonly used types of bariatric procedures, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)
(without creation of a bile loop), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB) (with creation of
shorter 100–150 cm and longer 200–280 cm bile loops, respectively), differ in their effects on glycemic control. The aim of the
study was to compare the effects of various bariatric procedures on serum BA concentration and glucose homeostasis.
Methods Serum BAs in 26 obese patients were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry prior to bariatric
surgery, as well as 4 days and 3 months thereafter.
Results Four days after the surgery, serum concentrations of BAs in LSG and OLGB groups were similar as prior to the
procedure, and a slight decrease in serum BAs was observed in the RYGB group. Serum BA level in the LSG group remained
unchanged also at 3 months after the surgery, whereas a significant 0.5- and 3-fold increase in this parameter was noted in the
RYGB and OLGB groups, respectively. Serum concentration of BAs correlated positively with the length of the bile loop (R =
0.47, p < 0.05).
Conclusion The evident improvement of glycemic control observed 3 months after OLGB might be associated with a postoperative increase in serum BAs, resulting from their better absorption from the longer bile loop. However, the changes in serum
BAs probably had little or no impact on insulin sensitivity improvement at 4 days post-surgery.

Introduction
Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide; it is
frequently associated with various comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, lipid disorders, cholelithiasis, sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic
kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and some malignancies [1–4]. Due to the lack of other effective therapies, bariatric surgeries are performed in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and were shown to induce the remission of diabetes in this group. The most commonly used bariatric procedures include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB),
omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB), and laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy (LSG). All these procedures result not only in a
weight loss but also in the resolution of hyperglycemia, insulin
resistance, and T2DM, all observed within hours or days after
the surgery, well before the reduction of body weight [5, 6].
Although the exact mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of bariatric surgeries on glucose metabolism is still not
fully understood, some evidence points to potential involvement of bile acids (BAs) [7]. BAs are a heterogeneous group
of compounds with different biological functions and physicochemical properties. Primary BAs are synthesized in the
liver; the vast majority of this pool is conjugated with glycine
and taurine and released to the proximal duodenum.
Approximately 5% of the primary BAs undergo transformation to secondary bile acids by intestinal microflora [8].
Ninety-five percent of BAs are reabsorbed from the intestine
and delivered back to the liver. An overview of BA metabolism is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.
While blood concentrations of BAs in healthy persons are
generally low, they increase considerably in patients with
hepatobiliary and intestinal diseases or drug-induced liver injury [9]. Elevated level of bile acids, especially secondary
BAs and their conjugates, is particularly harmful for hepatocytes and colon cells, since the accumulation of these compounds may result in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and liver
failure [10–12], or may stimulate colonic carcinogenesis
[13]. However, an increase in serum BAs may also be beneficial, as it may be associated with the normalization of glucose metabolism after bariatric surgeries [8].
Also, body weight loss and/or calorie restriction have an
impact on glucose and BA homeostasis [14, 15]. During
malabsorptive procedures, such as various types of gastric
bypass surgeries performed commonly nowadays, a small
pouch is created in the stomach, connecting it with the proximal jejunum. As a result, BAs can reach the distal intestine
and be absorbed by ileocytes [7]. In turn, during a restrictive
procedure, such as LSG, a large part of the stomach is
removed along the greater curvature [7]. These modifications
of intestinal passage contribute to changes in the secretion of
gut hormones and peptides and may affect both the absorption
of BAs and the serum concentrations thereof [16]. BAs may
influence glucose homeostasis acting on muscles, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells via nuclear FXR and membrane TGR-5 receptors [17, 18]. However, previous clinical
trials of bariatric procedures produced inconclusive results
with regard to prognosis in patients with T2DM. It is generally
believed that RYGB provides better glycemic control than
LSG. Many previous studies demonstrated that RYGB and
LSG exert a plethora of effects on carbohydrate metabolism,
contributing to a decrease in serum glucose, serum insulin,
HOMA-IR, and HbA1c levels, and to an increase in serum
GLP-1 [8]. The effect of RYGB on BA status is known better
than that of LSG. Some evidence suggests that RYGB may
stimulate an increase in primary, secondary, and conjugated
BAs [19]. In contrast, LSG seems to exert less evident effect
on circulating BAs or has no effect at all [20]. In our recent
study, we observed the most evident improvement of insulin
sensitivity after OLGB [7]. Therefore, we decided to compare
the effects of various bariatric procedures (with a long or short
bile loop, or without the loop) on the composition and concentration of serum BAs and glucose metabolism in morbidly
obese patients. Moreover, we searched for plausible mechanisms explaining the differences in the outcomes of various
bariatric procedures.
Material and Methods
Patients
Twenty six obese female patients aged 41 ± 2.2 years
underwent bariatric surgeries at the Department of General,
Endocrine and Transplant Surgery, Medical University of
Gdansk (Poland). Seven patients (mean BMI 41 ± 1.6 kg/
m2
) were subjected to LSG, another nine (mean BMI 41 ±
1.0 kg/m2
) to RYGB, and ten (mean BMI 44 ± 1.0 kg/m2) to
OLGB. All study subjects were non-smokers, and none of
them presented with a clinical evidence of heart, liver, and
kidney diseases. Ten persons suffered from concomitant
T2DM. Anthropometric and laboratory parameters of the
study participants were determined prior to the surgery, as well
as 4 days and 3 months thereafter. Blood samples for the
analysis were collected after an overnight fast (from all 26
patients at each time point). Routine laboratory parameters
were determined at the Central Clinical Laboratory, Medical
3406 OBES SURG (2018) 28:3405–3414

University of Gdansk. All tests used in this study followed
relevant protocols and guidelines. Selected biochemical and
anthropometric characteristics of the study participants are
presented in Table 1.
Surgical Technique
A 36-Fr calibration tube was used to confirm the volume
restriction of the gastric sleeve or the gastric pouch (ca 40–
45 ml). Since a long narrow reservoir has been constructed for
OLGB to reduce the risk of the bile reflux, the same type of
gastric tube was used in RYGB procedures to create the similar restriction conditions in both subgroups. The continuity of
the digestive tract in LSG was preserved and no exclusion of
the intestine was performed. The alimentary limb in RYGB
operation has been established for 150 cm. The extent of
biliopancreatic exclusion in both types of gastric bypass procedures was related to BMI, age, presence of diabetes, and the
total length of the small intestine. The range in RYGB was
100–150 cm and that in OLGB was 200 to 250 cm, exceptionally 280 cm, where the total intestinal length approached
800 cm. The common limb has never been shorter than
300 cm in both gastric bypass procedures. The measurement
of the intestinal loops was based on the not-strained organ
manipulation and the 10-cm marker fixed to the grasping instrument was used to the equable calibration. All of the procedures were performed laparoscopically. The intra-operative
complications and adverse events have not been experienced
in the investigated cohort of patients. The average operation
time was 62.5 min in the SG group and 75.6 and 90.8 min in
the OLGB and RYGB groups respectively. All of the procedures were completed by the fixed team of the bariatric
surgeons.

Mass Spectrometry
Sample Collection and Storage
Blood samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and kept at room temperature for 30 min to allow clotting.
Then, the material was centrifuged at 3000×g for 15 min at
4 °C. The separated sera were stored in aliquots at − 80 °C
until the analysis.
Preparation of Standard Solutions
Standard stocks of all BAs and deuterated internal standards
(IS, CA-d5) were diluted with methanol to obtain 10 μM solutions and stored in sealed glass vials at − 20 °C. Final solutions of individual BA standards and IS were obtained by
diluting the 10 μM solutions with methanol and miliQ water
mixture (50:50, v/v). Standard calibration curves were prepared for seven concentrations, from 0.1 to 100 μM.
Sample Preparation
The samples were prepared in glass tubes. First, each serum
sample (250 μl) was mixed with 25 μl of IS. Then, 800 μl of
cold acetonitrile was added for protein precipitation, and the
sample was vortexed for 1 min, followed by a 15-min centrifugation at 4000×g at 25 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, dried in a stream of nitrogen, and the
residue was dissolved in 250 μl of methanol and miliQ water
mixture (50:50, v/v). Finally, 70 μl of the dissolved supernatant was transferred to 96-well plates for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Chromatography
Chromatographic separation was performed on a Biocrates®
Bile Acids Kit (U)HPLC column (Biocrates, Innsbruck,
Austria), using a Surveyor™ Plus high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA). The mobile phase consisted of aqueous solution of
10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.015% formic acid (A),
and acetonitrile and methanol mixture (325:150, v/v) with
aqueous solution of 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.015%
formic acid (B). Each 5 μl sample was injected onto the column and subjected to gradient elution (0–1.05 min at 35%
phase B, 9.45 min to 100% phase B, 1.5 min at 100% phase
B, 0.30 min to 35% phase B, 2.5 min at 35% phase B). The
whole chromatographic separation lasted 15 min at a maximum flow rate of 0.33 ml/ml, with maximum temperatures of
a column oven and autosampler up to 50 and 4 °C,
respectively.
Mass Spectrometry
Specific BAs were identified and quantified with the Thermo
Scientific™ TSQ Vantage™ Triple Quadrupole Mass
Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) working in
negative ESI mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode. Capillary voltage, capillary temperature, and source
temperature were set at − 3000 V, 200 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. Transitions, collision energies, and S-Lens parameters
are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
Data Analysis
Peak finding, filtering, alignment, and scaling to internal standard were carried out with Xcalibur QuanBrowser software,
version 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) capable of MRM
data processing.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance of differences in pre- and postoperative
values of the study variables was verified with paired t test.
The significance of differences between the subgroups of patients subjected to three various types of bariatric surgeries
was verified by ANOVA with an appropriate post hoc test.
The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.
Power and direction of relationships between pairs of variables were determined by means of linear regression analysis.
All statistical calculations were carried out with SigmaPlot
software.
Results
Three months after bariatric surgery, significant improvements
were observed in many study parameters, including BMI, serum triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, glucose, HOMA, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and CRP
(Table 1, Fig. 1). OLBG contributed to the most evident improvement of BMI and HOMA and HbA1c levels (Fig. 1). A
significant improvement in serum glucose and HOMA levels
was observed at 4 days post-surgery as well, especially in the
OLGB group, even despite a considerable increase in serum
CRP suggesting the presence of a postoperative inflammation
(Table 1). Irrespective of its type, bariatric surgery contributed
to a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol concentration at
both 4 days and 3 months, but without a concomitant change
in LDL/HDL ratio (Table 1).
Four days after the surgery, serum concentrations of BAs in
the LSG and OLGB groups were similar as prior to the procedure, and a slight albeit significant decrease in serum BAs
was observed in the RYGB group (Fig. 2). While serum BA
level in the LSG group remained also unchanged at 3 months
post-surgery, a significant 0.5- and 3-fold increase in this parameter was noted in the RYGB and OLGB groups, respectively (Fig. 2).
Since the post-surgery increase in serum concentration of
BAs was postulated to be associated with an improvement of
glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, we analyzed relationships between relative changes in total BAs, HbA1c, and
HOMA at 3 months after the bariatric procedure. Our analysis
demonstrated that the postoperative increase in serum BAs
was associated with a significant decrease in both HbA1c
and HOMA values (Fig. 3).
Detailed information about pre- and postoperative profiles of serum BAs in the study patients is presented in
Table 2. Three months after OLGB, a particularly evident

conjugated BAs, especially GCA, GCDCA, and GDCA
(Supplementary Table S2). Also, RYGB contributed to an
evident increase in primary conjugated BAs. In turn, LSG
resulted in a slight increase in secondary conjugated BAs
and a concomitant decrease in primary unconjugated BAs.
Regardless of bariatric procedure type, no significant increase in BA concentrations was observed at 4 days postsurgery. In contrast, the treatment contributed to a significant decrease in primary unconjugated BAs (in the OLGB
and RYGB groups), secondary unconjugated BAs (in the
LSG group), or both primary and secondary conjugated
BAs (in the RYGB group).
No bile loop is created during LSG, and the loop created
during OLGB is longer than that formed during RYGB; this

implies that the length of the bile loop might influence serum
concentrations of BAs in our patients at 3 months after the bariatric procedure. Indeed, total concentration of serum BAs
3 months after RYGB and OLGB correlated positively with
the length of the bile loop (Fig. 4).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our present experiment was the
first study to compare the effects of three various bariatric procedures, LSG, RYGB, and OLGB, on serum concentrations of
BAs in morbidly obese patients. The results of previous
research in this matter were inconclusive. While the majority
of recent studies demonstrated that RYGB contributed to a
significant increase in serum concentration of bile acids, LSG
resulted in either a decrease or increase in serum BAs, or had no
effect at all [8]. In turn, the influence of OLGB on serum BAs
has not been studied thus far. Our hereby presented findings
suggest that OLGB contributed to a more evident increase in
serum BAs at 3 months post-surgery than RYGB. Not surprisingly, LSG exerted the least evident effect on postoperative
serum BA levels. According to some authors, the postsurgery increase in serum BAs was associated with an improvement of glucose metabolism [15, 21–24]. Our findings are consistent with those data, since the levels of serum glucose,

insulin, HOMA, and HBA1c at 3 months after the bariatric
procedure were significantly lower than those prior to the surgery. However, the magnitude of this effect depended on the
type of bariatric procedure, with the most prominent changes
observed after OLGB and the least evident improvement documented in the LSG group. Also, according to other authors,
OLGB contributed to a greater improvement in glucose metabolism than RYGB [25]. Altogether, these findings suggest that
the more evident the postoperative increase in serum BAs, the
greater the improvement in glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity. The results of our study support this hypothesis, as
we found strong inverse correlations between relative postoperative changes in serum BAs, HbA1c, and HOMA levels.
However, the question arises about a plausible underlying
mechanism of these associations. One difference between the
three bariatric procedures analyzed in this study is the length
of bile loop [7]. While the loop created during OLGB is longer
than that formed during RYGB, no bile loop is made during
LSG. Since the most evident increase in serum BAs was observed after OLGB, followed by RYGB and LSG, the magnitude of this effect might have been directly related to the
length of bile loop created during various bariatric procedures.
This hypothesis seems to be supported by a significant positive correlation between bile loop length and serum concentrations of BAs at 3 months after RYGB and OLBG. The
differences in postoperative dynamics of serum BAs probably
resulted from the fact that bile acids released to the intestinal
segment excluded from the alimentary passage did not mix
with food and hence might be reabsorbed at higher concentrations [8]. Primary conjugated BAs were the group of bile acids
that showed the most evident increase at 3 months after
RYGB and OLGB. These BAs are synthesized in the liver
and released directly to the intestinal segment which is partially excluded from the alimentary passage during bariatric procedure, which might contribute to their higher reuptake.
Our findings are partially consistent with the results published recently by Risstad et al. [26]; according to these authors, the increase in total serum BAs in obese patients subjected to biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch
(BPD/DS) was greater than that in individuals after RYGB.
Similar to OLGB, BPD/DS also results in a longer passage of
concentrated bile via the biliopancreatic limb. Unfortunately,
Risstad et al. did not analyze the link between serum concentration of BAs and biliary loop length [26]. The importance of
the latter parameter as a determinant of serum BA level after
bariatric surgery was also demonstrated in an animal study in
which an increase in bile acid concentration and improvement
of glucose metabolism were observed in rats with longer
biliopancreatic limb, but not in those with the shorter limb
[27]. Both our hereby presented findings and the results of
previous studies support the conclusion that the length of concentrated bile passage created during a bariatric surgery influences the serum level of BAs in morbidly obese patients.
In general, bariatric surgery leads to reversion or prevents
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, recent
studies revealed that in some cases, the deterioration of liver
parameters and fibrosis may occur after RYGB and OLGB
[28, 29]. OLGB results in greater worsening of liver parameters than RYGB [28]. Increased amounts of BA in hepatocytes
cause damage of these cells by induction of apoptosis, necrosis, and mitochondrial injury [10]. Moreover, serum BA level
increases with increasing liver fibrosis [30]. However, further
studies are needed to find out if prominent increase of serum
BA concentrations after OLGB may contribute to increased
liver fibrosis.
The fact that bariatric treatment, in particular various
types of gastric bypass procedures, results in a rapid improvement of insulin sensitivity, observed already a few
days after the procedure, raises interest of researchers and
clinical practitioners. However, although this phenomenon
has been reported by many authors [7, 31–35], its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. We hypothesized that the rapid improvement of insulin sensitivity
observed shortly after bariatric surgery may be associated
with BA response. Our hypothesis was driven by the results published by Pournaras et al. [36] who documented
an increase in total serum BAs in 12 obese patients as
early as 3 days after RYGB. However, the effect observed
in their study was not statistically significant and individual results varied considerably. Unlike Pournaras et al.,
we did not observe an increase in serum BAs during early
postoperative period (at 4 days post-surgery), and the serum level of bile acids in the RYGB group was even
slightly, albeit significantly, lower than at the baseline.
Thus, our findings do not support the role of BAs in the
improvement of insulin sensitivity shortly after bariatric
surgery. Perhaps this phenomenon can be explained by
other mechanisms, e.g., reduced food intake and increased
secretion of incretin shortly after the bariatric procedure
[20, 32].
Conclusions
Recent evidence suggests that changes in the concentration of
circulating BAs may contribute to metabolic improvement
observed after bariatric surgeries, but underlying mechanisms
of this phenomenon are poorly understood. The evident improvement of glucose metabolism observed in our patients
after OLGB might be associated with a significant increase
in serum concentrations of bile acids, especially primary conjugated BAs that can be more efficiently absorbed from a
longer bile loop. However, the changes in serum BAs probably had little or no impact on insulin sensitivity improvement
observed 4 days after the surgery.
