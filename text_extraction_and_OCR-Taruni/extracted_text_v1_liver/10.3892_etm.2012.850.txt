Abstract. Severe acute exacerbation in patients with chronic 
hepatitis B is a unique clinical presentation that results in high 
mortality. To compare the efficacy of 4 weeks of entecavir or 
lamivudine therapy in patients with severe acute exacerbation 
caused by chronic hepatitis B, 65 patients were retrospectively 
analyzed. The groups received 0.5 mg entecavir (group A) 
or 100 mg lamivudine (group B) daily. After 4 weeks of 
treatment, virological and biochemical responses and the deterioration rates were determined. The average age and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, albumin, creatinine (Cr), 
and HBV DNA levels were similar in groups A and B prior 
to treatment, but the prothrombin time (PT) was shorter in 
group A. Following treatment, ALT and bilirubin levels were 
improved while there were no significant changes in PT, 
albumin or Cr levels at week 4 in group B. Only ALT was 
markedly upregulated following treatment in group A. There 
were no significant differences between the virological and 
biochemical responses or the deterioration rates of the two 
groups. These results suggested that short-term treatment with 
lamivudine markedly alleviated the increased bilirubin (TB) 
levels in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic 
hepatitis B and that there was no significant difference in the 
deterioration rate between patients treated by the two types of 
medication.
Introduction
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a public health 
concern worldwide and is responsible for 1 million deaths 
annually. The virus significantly increases the risk of hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). Severe acute 
exacerbation is a unique presentation of chronic HBV infection which is characterized by high alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels accompanied by jaundice and hepatic decompensation (2). Deterioration leads to acute-on-chronic liver failure 
and mortality (3).
Lamivudine was the first registered oral antiviral drug 
and has been widely used due to its efficacy during short‑term 
administration (4). Outcomes regarding the use of lamivudine 
therapy for patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic 
hepatitis B have been reported (5-7). However, the therapy 
is limited by the high risk of virological breakthrough and 
drug resistance, which has been observed in up to 76% of 
patients that have been treated for ≥5 years (8). A better drug 
with a lower risk of drug resistance is required. Entecavir is 
a new and potent drug that works against HBV by selective 
inhibition of HBV DNA polymerase. With regard to safety, 
entecavir is similar to lamivudine although it is superior in 
tolerability (9-11). However, few studies have observed the 
outcome of entecavir for patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis. A recent study showed that entecavir 
treatment was associated with increased short-term mortality 
in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B, particularly within 30 days following treatment (12).
The present study retrospectively compared the effect of 
entecavir and lamivudine in the short-term treatment (30 days) 
of patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis.

546 LIU et al: ENTECAVIR AND LAMIVUDINE THERAPY FOR HEPATITIS B
exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B was defined as an elevation of ALT to a level ≥10-fold higher than the upper limit of 
normal (ULN, 40 IU/l) and an elevation of bilirubin to a level 
≥3-fold higher than the ULN (21 µmol/l). All 65 patients had 
been recorded as positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) for >6 months. Patients coinfected with hepatitis A, 
C and E viruses were excluded by serological assays. An 
abdominal ultrasound was performed at admission to exclude 
cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary obstruction. 
There were no patients with hepatic encephalopathy, ascites or 
abnormal renal function tests at baseline. Patients who received 
immunosuppressants or systemic corticosteroids were also 
excluded. Cirrhosis in patients was defined by an ultrasound 
revealing a coarse liver echotexture with nodularity and small 
liver size and the presence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, 
splenomegaly and varices). Prior written and informed consent 
was obtained from each patient and the study was approved by 
the ethics review board of Shandong University.
The eligible subjects were divided into two groups. 
Group A consisted of 31 patients who received 0.5 mg entecavir daily and group B consisted of the remaining 34 patients 
who were administered with 100 mg lamivudine daily. The 
levels of serum ALT, bilirubin, PT, albumin, creatinine (Cr) 
and HBV DNA titer were analyzed at week 4 following 
the treatment. The deterioration rate, defined as the rate of 
disease progression in a patient taken from the date when the 
first dose of lamivudine or entecavir was administered to the 
date of acute-on-chronic liver failure or mortality, was also 
calculated.
Real‑time quantitative PCR. HBV DNA was measured by 
real-time polymerase chain reaction on a LightCycler 2.0 
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The fluorescence 
detection kit and probes were purchased from Piji Biological 
Engineering Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). The detection limit 
of the HBV DNA was 1,000 copies/ml and the level of negative HBV DNA was set as 500 copies/ml.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by 
SPSS software (version 13). In the present study, continuous 
variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) or median (range) values. The level of HBV DNA was 
logarithmically transformed to a normal distribution for analysis. The significance of the differences between the results 
of Levene's homogeneity examination of the normalized 
continuous variables was determined by the Student's t-test. 
The significance of the differences between the categorical 
variables was analyzed by the Chi-square test. Non-conformity 
in the baseline between the two groups was eliminated by 
covariance analysis of the prothrombin time (PT). P<0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
PT was shorter in group A patients prior to treatment. To 
determine whether the baseline conditions of subjects in 
groups A and B (31 and 34 patients ingesting 0.5 mg entecavir 
and 100 mg lamivudine daily, respectively) were the same 
prior to the treatment, biochemical markers were analyzed. No 
significant differences were detected in gender or age between 
the two groups (P=0.309 and 0.524, respectively) (Table I). 
The baseline levels of ALT, bilirubin, albumin and Cr at the 
time antiviral therapy was commenced were similar between 
the two groups. No difference was observed between the levels 
of HBV DNA (P=0.077), however, PT was shorter in group A 
compared with group B (P=0.021).
Responses following the 4‑week treatment. To study the 
changes in patient responses prior to and following treatment, 
levels of ALT, bilirubin, albumin, Cr, HBV DNA and PT 
were analyzed. Following the 4‑week treatment of enticavir, 
patients in group A showed a marked downregulation of ALT 
(P=0.000, Table II), with a significant downregulation of 
HBV DNA levels (P=0.001). However, the levels of bilirubin, 
albumin, Cr and PT remained almost unchanged. In group B, 
the patients treated with lamivudine for 4 weeks demonstrated improved levels of ALT and bilirubin (P=0.000 and 
P=0.005, respectively) compared with those observed prior 
to treatment. HBV DNA levels were also markedly decreased 
(P=0.000).

Comparison of the two groups following treatment by enticavir 
or lamivudine. The present study investigated the difference 
in the efficiency of enticavir and lamivudine treatment. There 
were no significant differences in PT or in the levels of ALT, 
TB, ALB and Cr between the two groups following the 4‑week 
treatment (Table III). Moreover, the levels of HBV DNA (l g) 
were unchanged between the two groups (P=0.213).
Acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) developed in 2 patients 
(6.45%) in group A, while 2 patients (5.88%) in group B deteriorated into hepatic failure, with one patient undergoing liver 
transplantation. Therefore the deterioration rates of the two 
groups were similar (P=0.385).
Discussion
The present study is a retrospective analysis of patients 
enrolled between May 2008 and May 2011. Previous studies 
have reported that entecavir is as safe as Lamivudine, but 
that it is able to inhibit the replication of HBV faster and 
more efficiently, leading to improved clinical outcomes when 
used in patients with chronic hepatitis B (13,14). Although 
severe acute exacerbation in patients with chronic hepatitis B 
characterized by extremely high ALT levels accompanied by 
jaundice and hepatic decompensation is difficult to cure, few 
studies have focused on the efficacy of entecavir in patients 
with this condition. Wong et al showed that while entecavir 
was the better inhibitor of hepatitis B, the mortality rate within 
30 days was significantly higher than when using lamivudine 
(p=0.028) (12). In the present study, every indicator, including 
PT, exhibited no evident differences between the groups 
treated either with entecavir or lamivudine for 4 weeks. The 
deterioration rates between the two groups were also the same. 
These results demonstrated that the efficacy of lamivudine and 
entecavir was similar in the treatment of patients with severe 
acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B.
The study of Wong et al (12) also demonstrated that 
entecavir was able to lead to a more rapid decrease in HBV 
DNA compared with lamivudine and that this decrease may 
be associated with the high mortality rate demonstrated with 
entecavir treatment. However, in the present study, no differences in the levels of HBV DNA between patients treated with 
entecavir and lamivudine were detected. Further observation 
is required to investigate the correlation between HBV DNA 
levels and mortality. There are several factors that may affect 
these results. Firstly, the patients selected in the present study 
had severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and the 
typical presentation of severe acute exacerbation is a short 
onset of jaundice and an extremely high ALT level. Moreover, 
these patients may have strong immune scavenging and 
e-antigen negative conversion abilities (2). Therefore within

a short time, entecavir and lamivudine may exhibit good 
outcomes. Secondly, the analyses on genotype and other influencing factors were not accessible as the present study was 
only a retrospective analysis.
The present study identified that besides being a virological 
indicator, lamivudine was able to significantly reduce the levels 
of ALT and bilirubin, while entecavir was only able to decrease 
the ALT level. These results showed that lamivudine was superior in decreasing bilirubin levels as compared to entecavir, 
as observed by Wong et al (12), but that bilirubin levels were 
thought to be associated with the higher morbidity of entecavir. 
The main purpose of the present study was not to observe 
the short-term effects of entecavir treatment, but to prove 
whether entecavir would significantly increase the short‑term 
deterioration rate and thus cause its long-term application to be 
restricted. Current studies have yet to demonstrate the manner 
in which the anti-viral therapy may improve the short-term 
prognosis of patients with severe acute exacerbation of 
chronic hepatitis B (15,16). Certain investigators believed that 
short-term mortality mainly depended on the degree of hepatic 
necrosis but not the viral load (16,17). Treatment with nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine, was recommended for 
patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B 
mainly in order that they be provided with long-term therapeutic 
benefits (16). However, long‑term lamivudine treatment caused 
severe drug-resistance (8). Current evidence does not appear to 
support adefovir salvage therapy either (18,19). Entecavir was 
not recommended to patients with severe acute exacerbation 
of chronic hepatitis B based on the studies by Wong et al (12) 
which demonstrated a marked elevation of short‑term mortality, 
although the mortality rate had no significant differences 
between 30 days and 48 weeks (P=0.14). In the present study, 
entecavir did not show any superiority over lamivudine, particularly in its ability to reduce bilirubin levels. However, entecavir 
also did not lead to the elevation of short-term mortality rates. 
Consequently further investigation is required to confirm that 
entecavir is potentially a better choice for the anti-viral therapy 
in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis.
