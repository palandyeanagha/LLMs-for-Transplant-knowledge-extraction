Abstract
Background: Studies in multiple organ systems have shown cross-talk between signaling through the bone
morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) and estrogen pathways. In humans, pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) has a female predominance, and is associated with decreased BMPR2 expression. The goal of
this study was to determine if estrogens suppress BMPR2 expression.
Methods: A variety of techniques were utilized across several model platforms to evaluate the relationship
between estrogens and BMPR2 gene expression. We used quantitative RT-PCR, gel mobility shift, and luciferase
activity assays in human samples, live mice, and cell culture.
Results: BMPR2 expression is reduced in lymphocytes from female patients compared with male patients, and in
whole lungs from female mice compared with male mice. There is an evolutionarily conserved estrogen receptor
binding site in the BMPR2 promoter, which binds estrogen receptor by gel-shift assay. Increased exogenous
estrogen decreases BMPR2 expression in cell culture, particularly when induced to proliferate. Transfection of
increasing quantities of estrogen receptor alpha correlates strongly with decreasing expression of BMPR2.
Conclusions: BMPR2 gene expression is reduced in females compared to males in live humans and in mice, likely
through direct estrogen receptor alpha binding to the BMPR2 promoter. This reduced BMPR2 expression may
contribute to the increased prevalence of PAH in females.

Background
Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) is
essential for development; mice lacking the gene fail to
progress to gastrulation [1]. BMP signaling is essential
in almost all tubular organogenesis. In lung, kidney and
lacrimal gland formation BMP signaling is central to
development [2-4]. The BMP pathway also plays a central role in Müllerian duct regression and Sertoli cell
maturation regression [5,6].
Beyond its developmental role, signaling through
BMPR2 is associated with several adult diseases, including arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis,
diabetic nephropathy, renal fibrosis, and osteoporosis
[7-10]. The common role for the BMP pathway in all of
these seems to be an inappropriate response to damage
to the respective organ. Many of these diseases show a
marked gender imbalance in prevalence, and cross-talk
between estrogen and BMP signaling has been noted in
systems throughout the body [11-13].
For instance, in most but not all forms of pulmonary
hypertension, such as Diagnostic Group 1, females have a
higher prevalence of disease [14]. However, the precise
magnitude of distribution by gender is of some debate in
heritable and sporadic forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The landmark NIH Registry study in the
1980s, composed primarily of patients with sporadic
PAH, reported a female: male ratio of 1.7:1 [15]. Two
large recent studies have confirmed the gender predominance, although among those with heritable and sporadic
PAH the magnitude of the difference varied between
1.9:1 and 4:1 [16,17]. Moreover, while the heritable form
of disease is associated with BMPR2 mutation [9], even

low expression of normal BMPR2 appears to predispose
to disease [9,18]. We previously demonstrated that alterations in estrogen metabolism and estrogen metabolites
associate with the penetrance of PAH among female
patients with a BMPR2 mutation [19]. Our work to date
has focused upon the estrogen component of the sex hormone pathway in PAH, although we recognize that testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and other androgens
may influence both BMPR2 gene expression as well as
pulmonary vasodilation [20]. Together, these data led us
to question whether there might be direct regulation of
BMPR2 expression by estrogen. In this study, we tested
the hypothesis that estrogens directly regulate BMPR2
expression using quantitative RT-PCR, gel mobility shift,
and luciferase activity assays in human samples, live
mice, and cell culture.
Methods
It is known that there is a strong gender bias in the incidence and prevalence of PAH (more females), and that
BMPR2 expression is reduced in the lungs of patients
with heritable PAH and other forms of PAH [15-17,21].
We hypothesized that elevated exposure to estrogens
explains the gender discrepancy by directly regulating
BMPR2 gene expression. We employed the following
methods to test the hypothesis that estrogens directly
regulate BMPR2 gene expression.
Cultured human lymphocyte specimen studies: cell
culture
Cultured lymphocyte (CL) cell lines from normal subjects
were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ, USA). All CL cell lines were grown in 15% FBS
in RPMI 1640 with 2 mM L-Glutamine for studies with
and without estradiol (E2, 17b-estradiol) exposure. FBS
was stripped with activated charcoal (1 g per 50 ml of
FBS) for 30 min at 4°C, filtered, and sterilized. E2 was
purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis,
MO, USA), with stock solution made in 95% ethanol.
Cells were exposed to either standard or E2-containing
media. For E2-containing media, E2 was added to standard media to create a media containing 1 μM E2. Cells
were exposed to standard media or E2-containing media
for 24 h then harvested.
Cultured human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell
(PMVEC) specimen studies: cell culture
An established cultured human PMVEC line was
obtained for study from Drs Krump-Konvalinkova and
Kirkpatrick [22]. The cells were grown in normal
endothelial cell growth media from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) to passage 2, and transitioned to phenol
red-free media upon transition to passage 3 for E2 exposure studies. The media was changed daily for at least 48
h until the cells were at approximately 70% plate confluence, at which time exposure to normal media or media
treated with E2 (1 μM) was performed.
Cultured NMuMG cells
Normal mouse mammary gland epithelial cells (NMuMG,
ATCC CRL-1636 European Collection of Cell Cultures
no. 94081121) constitutively competent for TGF-ß superfamily signaling were used to measure the influence of
Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and E2 upon
BMPR2 gene expression [23]. We chose to use this cell
line because of the competence of TGF-ß signaling, and
also as a system previously validated for the study of
BMPR2 gene expression [24]. They were cultured in
DMEM 10% FBS, 1% pen/Strep 1% glutamine. For
BMPR2 gene expression studies in response to PMA
(1 μM) (Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, MO, USA)
and E2 (10-8 M), cell culture media was changed 2 days
prior to experimental procedures to phenol-red free, 2.5%
charcoal scrubbed media.
Cultured COS-7 cells
African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL1651, Manassas, VA, USA). COS-7 cells were chosen
because they do not constitutively express estrogen receptors and are not estrogen responsive. They were thus used
for the luciferase assay experiments below to further
define the association of the estrogen receptor activation
with BMPR gene expression. COS-7 cells were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibioticantimycotic at 37°C and 5% CO2 in humidified incubator.
Two days prior to experimentation the media was changed
to phenol-red free, 2.5% charcoal scrubbed media.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
NMuMG cells were grown as described above. Nuclear
proteins were isolated following the protocol of Deryckere et al. [25]. Nuclear proteins were incubated with
BMPR2 promoter derived (AGTCGGGAACTAGTTCTGACCCTCGCCCCC) or vitelligenin ER binding site
(AAAACGTTCGAGGAGGTCACAGTGACCTGGAGC
GG) biotinylated double stranded oligos as per the manufactures instructions. (LightShift Chemiluminescent
EMSA Kit Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Following binding, complexes were diluted in gel-loading
buffer and electrophoresed. The separated material was
transferred to nylon membrane and cross-linked all following the manufacture’s protocol. Detection again followed the manufacture’s method, in brief, the membrane
was blocked, washed, and incubated with streptavidin
conjugated HRP. The conjugate is incubated, washed and
detected with Luminol/enhancer solution and the image
capture via X-ray film.

Cultured lymphocyte, PMVEC, and NMuMG specimen
studies
Analysis of BMPR2 transcripts by real time
Quantitative analysis of BMPR2 transcripts by cultured
lymphocytes and PMVECs was performed using realtime RT-PCR, as previously described [18]. Briefly,
cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total cellular RNA
using Superscript III cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Taqman real-time assay was
designed for BMPR2 transcripts (NM_001204.6) using
the Primer Express software package (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were chosen for
forward and reverse primers (WT-forward primer 5’
TTAGTGACTTTGGACTGTCCATGAG-3’; WT-reverse
primer 5’-TCTAGCACTTCTGGTGCCATATATCT-3’),
as well as the probe sequence WT-Taqman probe 5’-
FAM-TAAGCGAGGTTGGCACT-3’. Assays were optimized using the standard curve method, and all specimens had amplification efficiencies of > 99.5%. Real-time
PCR analysis was carried out using Taqman Universal
Master Mix and a 7500 Real-Time PCR system according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). We used the TaqMan human
endogenous control plate (catalog number 4309199) to
analyze 13 genes as potential housekeeping genes (18S
rRNA, acidic ribosomal protein, beta-actin, cyclophilin,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerokinase, b2-microglobulin, b-glucronidase, hypoxanthine ribosyl transferase [HPRT], transcription factor
IID, TATA binding protein, 7 transferrin receptor, and
ABL) and chose HPRT for data normalization as previously described [26]. Each measurement was made in
triplicate and expressed relative to the detection of the
standard HPRT. Amplification parameters consisted of
initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing and
extension at 60°C for 1 min. Relative expression levels
were calculated using the comparative Ct method [27,28].
Quantitative analysis of BMPR2 transcripts by
NMuMG cells was performed using real-time RT-PCR,
with each measurement made in triplicate and expressed
relative to the detection of the standard b-actin.
Northern blotting
Equal amounts (15 μg) of RNA were denatured in formaldehyde, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond
N+
) (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA), followed by ultraviolet cross-linking. ULTRAHyb hybridization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The blots
were hybridized with a cDNA probe labeled with biotin.
Membranes were washed in 2 × SSC for 15 min at 42°C
and then in 0.1 × SSC for 30 min at 65°C. For visualization, X-ray film was exposed for 4 h to membranes
developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin.
Construction of luciferase reporter plasmids
The human BMPR2 promoter was cloned by PCR
amplification with restriction endonucleas recognition
site-containing primers. This amplicon was appropriately digested and cloned in to pGL3E (Promega, Madison WI. USA). The construct was confirmed by
sequencing.
pBRE plasmid is a luciferase reporter, containing parts
of the Id1 promoter, which responds specifically to BMP
activity to reflect canonical signaling [29].
Luciferase assay
Cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter driven
human ERS-1 expression plasmids (a generous gift from
M Melner) at various concentrations as reported in the
results section, BMPR2-luciferase reporter plasmids and
pTK-renilla, at constant concentrations (9 and 1 respectively), were transfected into COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL1651) utilizing FuGene 6 (Roche Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) 3:1 lipid to DNA. The total DNA
amount applied was held constant by the addition promoterless plasmid. Following transfection the COS-7
were incubated for 16 h and then luciferase and renilla
luciferase expression determined with the dual-luciferase
assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Assays were read on a
Turner Biosystems 20/20 n Luminometer. Luciferase
expression was normalized to renilla level. All conditions were assayed in triplicate and two independent
experiments were conducted.
For the pBRE assay, cells were plated into six well
plates and grown to 70% to 80% confluence. Wells were
transfected by application of 0.9 μg of pBRE and 0.1 μg
pTK-renilla complexed with 3 μg of FuGene 6 (Roche
Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) prepared following
the manufactures directions. After 16 h the media was
replaced with phenol red-free media. Twenty-four hours
later, wells were treated with estrogenic compounds or
vehicle as described. Following a 6-h exposure, the cells
were prepared for the dual-luciferase assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Assays were read on a Turner Biosystems 20/20 n
Luminometer. All conditions were assayed in triplicate
and two independent experiments were conducted. The
BMP-responsive luciferase output was normalized to
renilla expression to normalize for transfection efficiency
variation.
Animal studies, ovariectomy
All studies were conducted in accordance with principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes
Austin et al. Biology of Sex Differences 2012, 3:6

of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee. Wild-type male
and female FVB/NJ mice were purchased from Jackson
labs, bred at Vanderbilt, and pups allowed to reach
adulthood. Female mice aged 8 to 9 weeks were ovariectomized 5 weeks prior to study under continuous isoflurane anesthesia. All mice were otherwise treated the
same.
Animal studies, gene expression studies
Mice were sacrificed at 13 to 14 weeks of age, and RNA
extracted from whole lung homogenate using RNAeasy
Protect mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according
the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers were designed
using the NCBI primer designing tool, which incorporates BLAST searches to ensure specificity [30]. The following primer sets specific for Hprt, Bmpr2, Era, and
Erb were used: Hprt(TGCTCGAGATGTCATGAAGGAG, TTTAATGTAATCCAGCAGGTCAGC), Bmpr2
(CAGCTGGCCAGGCAGCCAAC, TGGCCAGCCTG
TTGCTCTCG), Era(CTACGGCCAGTCGGGCATCG,
GCATCAGCGGGCTAGGCGAC), and Erb(CTGCC
AGGCCTGCCGACTTC, ATGCACCTGCTCGCTGGCAC). The PCR reactions and relative quantifications
were performed using 25 ng of cDNA per reaction in a
7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied BioSystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Each measurement was made in triplicate and expressed relative to the detection of the standard HPRT.
Statistical analysis
All BMPR2 gene expression laboratory experiments
were performed in triplicate. Expression values are
reported as the mean relative to the housekeeping gene
± standard deviation (SD). For comparisons, data are
transformed so that all values in a given comparison are
relative to the lower value group which is identified as
the reference and thus with a value of 1.0. Raw values
were tested for normal distributions. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student’s t test or MannWhitney U test depending on the normality of the data.
All P values are two-sided and a P value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was
performed using the statistical package SPSS for Windows (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Quantitative analysis of transcripts in humans and mice
demonstrate reduced BMPR2 and increased ERa and ERb
gene expression among females
Cultured lymphocytes provide an in vitro model in
which to evaluate gene expression distinct from the
human subject milieu; specifically, all cells are passed
and exposed to equivalent levels of hormones and other
factors according to the media in which they are grown.
Thus, lymphocytes from 115 normal subjects were analyzed for relative BMPR2 gene expression. Of note,
there was no difference between these subjects according to gender (60 females, 55 males), nor in terms of
mean age (± SD) at the initial blood acquisition for the
establishment of cultured cells according to gender
(females 38.2 ± 24.4 years vs. males 35.1 ± 26.7 years;
P = 0.38 Mann-Whitney U test). While there was variability among all subjects in terms of relative BMPR2
gene expression, analysis according to gender revealed a
statistically significant difference between females (0.045
± 0.011) and males (0.056 ± 0.027). Compared to
females, BMPR2 gene expression was about 20% higher
among males (P = 0.005, Figure 1A). Culture conditions
were identical for all cells, so that all cells were exposed
to the same level of estrogens and other hormones in
vitro.
We next sought to confirm the differential BMPR2
gene expression between males and females in vivo,
independent of estrogen levels. We analyzed quantitative
Bmpr2 gene expression in whole lungs of ovariectomized female mice compared to male mice maintained
otherwise identically, and again found a statistically significant difference in terms of Bmpr2 gene expression.
Consistent with the human lymphocytes, compared to
ovariectomized females, Bmpr2 gene expression was
1.13-fold higher among normal male mice (P = 0.020,
Figure 1B).
A possible explanation for the differential BMPR2
expression between males and females in both the
human cells and mouse lungs is differential expression
of estrogen receptors. We therefore evaluated estrogen
receptor (ER) gene expression in the same mice. Ovariectomized female mice had a relative ERa gene expression 1.45-fold higher (P = 0.0004), and relative ERb
gene expression 1.19-fold higher (P = 0.030) than male
mice (Figure 1C).
The BMPR2 promoter contains a highly conserved
functional ER binding site
The above observations suggested that estrogen receptor
binding may suppress BMPR2 expression. Examination
of the BMPR2 promoter located an estrogen response
element (ERE) highly conserved across species (Figure
2A). To assess the potential functionality of this site, we
performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts from NMuMG
cells and found that the presumed ERE within the
BMPR2 promoter does bind ER in vitro. NMuMG cells
were chosen given their prior validation in the study of
BMPR2 gene expression associated with the consistent
competence of their TGF-ß signaling [24]. As seen in
Figure 2B, nuclear proteins were incubated with labeled

oligonucleotides and competitors as indicated. The vitellogenin gene was used as a positive control, since it has
a well defined ERE [31]. Exposure of the BMPR2 oligonucleotide sequence to protein results in a DNA-protein
complex (lane 1) of identical size to that bound by the
canonical ERE in vitellogenin (lane 5), indicating a
robust binding of the ER to the BMPR2 promoter of the
same mobility as the published positive control vitellogenin. The use of unlabeled ("cold”) BMPR2 oligonucleotide successfully competes away this band for both
the BMPR2 and the vitellogenin gene control lanes
(lanes 3 and 4), which confirms the ability of the
BMPR2 sequence to compete for ER binding (all experiments were done in the presence of 1,000-fold molar
excess of non-specific oligonucleotide, which suggests
that the elimination of vitellogenin binding is specific to
the BMPR2 competition); this suggests a specificity of
effect by BMPR2. The shifted band does not occur in
setting of a scrambled BMPR2 oligonucleotide sequence
(lane 2) or the absence of nuclear protein (lane 6),
demonstrating the need for both the correct ER protein
and the correct BMPR2 promoter sequence in this assay.
Treatment of normal human cell lines with estrogens
results in reduced BMPR2 gene expression, and this is
amplified in the setting of cellular proliferation
Expression of BMPR2 mRNA by both human lymphocytes and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial
cells (PMVECs) was examined after 24 h of treatment
with 1 μM E2. Compared to controls, BMPR2 mRNA
expression measured by quantitative PCR significantly
decreased after 24 h of E2 in both normal human lymphocytes (P < 0.05) (Figure 3A) and PMVECs (P < 0.01)
(Figure 3B) relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT.
To explore whether this response was unique to E2,
expression of BMPR2 mRNA by PMVECs was examined
after 24 h of treatment with E3 (estriol). Given the high
levels of E3 during pregnancy, which is a time of particular vulnerability to PAH presentation, response to E3
was explored. Treatment with 10 nM (P = 0.001), 30
nM (P = 0.001), and 100 nM (P = 0.009) of E3 resulted
in significantly lower BMPR2 gene expression compared
to the unexposed control PMVECs.
Given the association of BMPR2-associated PAH with
inappropriate cellular proliferation, we investigated the
impact of stimulating with a known mitogen (PMA) on
BMPR2 gene expression [32]. We found that PMA
alone was sufficient to suppress BMPR2 expression to a
degree comparable to E2 alone (Figure 3C). This finding
was not surprising, given the known effect of PMA to
increase expression by genes known to restrict cellular
proliferation, and increase gene expression by genes
known to promote cellular proliferation [32,33]. However, the combination of PMA and E2 caused a much
more dramatic, roughly four-fold reduction in BMPR2
expression, which suggests enhanced reduction in
BMPR2 gene expression in the setting of cellular
proliferation.
Reduction of BMPR2 gene expression by exposure to E2
occurs via ER binding to the BMPR2 promoter
Results in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that increasing levels
of estrogen receptor ought to result in decreased
BMPR2 expression. To test this directly, we used COS7 cells, which lack endogenous estrogen receptors.
COS-7 cells were transfected with noted amounts of ER
expression plasmid and a constant amount of BMPR2
promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. As expected,
increasing levels of ERa plasmid resulted in decreasing
levels of luciferase expression from the BMPR2 promoter driven reporter construct as normalized to tkRenella (Figure 4).
Figure 1 BMPR2 expression is lower in female humans and mice than males. (A) BMPR2 expression by quantitative RT-PCR, normalized to
HPRT, is reduced in cultured human lymphocytes from females compared with males. (B) BMPR2 expression normalized to HPRT is lower in
whole lung from ovariectomized female mice compared with males. (C) ERa and ERb expression are both higher in whole lung from
ovariectomized female mice compared with males. All comparisons were by unpaired Student’s t-test.

While E2 reduced BMPR2 gene expression, it appears to
increase Smad-dependent BMP pathway activity
To determine whether changes in BMPR2 transcript
level brought about a functional change in Smaddependent BMP pathway activity (the canonical BMP
pathway), luciferase reporter assays were performed.
pBRE, which measures BMP-specific Smad activity, and
thus canonical signaling, was tested. We found that, in

containing an estrogen receptor binding site (boxed), used for gel-shift assay below, is conserved across species. (B) Gel-shift assay indicating
that the estrogen receptor binding site is functional. BMPR2 probe sequence binds a protein (lane 1) of identical size to that bound by the
canonical estrogen receptor binding site in Vitellogenin (lane 5). Binding to both the BMPR2 probe sequence and the Vitellogenin probe
sequence can be competed away using cold BMPR2 probe sequence (lanes 3 and 4). Protein binding is not found when protein is omitted (lane
6) or with use of scrambled probe sequence (lane 2).

The combination of proliferation and estrogen produces an approximately 4× inhibition of BMPR2 expression (P < 0.05 by Student’s t test with
adjustment for multiple comparisons).

contrast to BMPR2 gene expression data, 16 h of E2
exposure at varying concentrations increased canonical
BMP pathway signaling as measured by pBRE activity.
This experiment established that while BMPR2 gene
expression is reduced, the canonical BMP signaling
pathway activity is not dampened in response to increasing doses of E2 in vitro. However, administration of the
ERa antagonist methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP)
reduced canonical BMP activity below control. As pBRE
represents a synthetic assay, we examined expression of
the Smad-dependent canonical BMP transcriptional target ID1. ID1 transcript expression was elevated 10-fold
following 16 h of exposure to 10 nm of E2 (Figure 5).
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that BMPR2 has approximately 25% lower expression in lymphocytes cultured
from female humans compared with males (Figure 1A),
and approximately 15% lower expression in whole lung
from ovariectomized female mice as compared to males
(Figure 1B). In both of these cases, the actual estrogen
exposure was the same for male and female groups, but
the level of estrogen receptor was increased in females
(Figure 1C). This led us to believe that estrogen effect on
BMPR2 expression was through canonical estrogen
receptors. There was an evolutionarily conserved estrogen receptor binding site in the BMPR2 promoter; we
confirmed its functionality by gel-shift assay and its
strength by its ability to out-compete the canonical estrogen receptor target vitellogenin (Figure 2). We found that
direct administration of estrogen suppressed BMPR2 signal by 15% in cultured lymphocytes and in pulmonary
microvascular smooth endothelial cells, but that in the
presence of a proliferative signal this suppression could
increase to 80% (Figure 3). We then used a cell line missing the estrogen receptor, and showed that we could add
it back to get a six-fold reduction in BMPR2 expression
in a dose-responsive manner (Figure 4). However, the
reduction in BMPR2 gene expression at baseline was not
reflected in a reduction in Smad-dependent effects
including ID1; non-canonical BMPR2 signaling was not
assessed (Figure 5). In total, these data indicate that
under normal circumstances, increased estrogen or
increased estrogen receptor decreases BMPR2 expression
by approximately 15%, but under extreme circumstances
(for example, proliferation or complete lack of estrogen
receptor) the total potential effect is a five- to six-fold
change. If this reduction is relevant to PAH pathogenesis,
the mechanism may involve downstream signaling by
BMPR2 that is not along the canonical BMPR2 signaling
cascade.
These results are relevant to the disease we study, pulmonary arterial hypertension, both because of the high
female prevalence, but also because we have shown that
among those with a BMPR2 mutation, it is women who
metabolize estrogen into the relatively more estrogenically active 16a-hydroxyestrone compound that develop
disease [15-17]. In contrast, women who metabolize
estrogen into 2-hydroxyestradiol or 2-hydroxyestrone
are less likely to develop PAH [19]. Several of the
enzymes responsible for estrogen metabolism, including
CYP1B1, have been studied and are expressed at the
mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue; not surprisingly, there is heterogeneity of expression among individuals [34]. It has been demonstrated that human
bronchial epithelial cells metabolize estrogen in vitro to
hydroxyestrogens such as 2-hydroxyestrone and 16aFigure 4 In the presence of estrogen, addition of estrogen
receptor to a cell line without endogenous expression reduces
BMPR2 promoter-reporter activity, in a dose-response (P =
0.0013 by Pearson correlation).
Figure 5 While BMPR2 gene expression is reduced, canonical
BMP pathway activity is increased by exposure to E2. (A) A
BMP responsive plasmid (pBRE system) studies: pBRE luciferase
activity, a measure of BMP activity, is increased with exposure to
increasing doses of E2. Uniform exposure to 50 ng of BMP4 in
concert with exposure to MPP or varying doses of E2 occurred.
Exposure to MPP, an ERa antagonist, resulted in reduced luciferase
expression, while E2 exposure increased luciferase expression. (B)
Consistent with this finding, gene expression of the canonical BMP

hydroxyestrone; however, while biologically plausible,
studies in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells are
lacking [35].
Since in most studies estrogen is protective of the pulmonary vasculature, the increased prevalence among
women might be best explained by the simple hypothesis
that gender differences occur through suppression of
BMPR2. On a broader level, these results, while novel,
might be expected. Whether or not the changes in BMPR2
expression we detected are specific to estrogens or also
seen with other hormones, such as thyroid hormone and
glucocorticoids requires further investigation. Thyroid
abnormalities are well documented among PAH patients,
and there is experimental data to suggest that glucocorticoids potentiate cellular proliferation among the vascular
smooth muscle cells derived from idiopathic PAH patients
[36]. Insulin resistance and perhaps the metabolic syndrome appear more prevalent among PAH patients, as well
[37].
While this study evaluates BMPR2 expression at the
molecular level, the PAH phenotype and the evolution of
clinical disease among PAH patients is quite complicated.
Data now exist to suggest that while PAH is more prevalent among females, incidence rates may not fully explain
the gender discrepancy. For example, females have better
right ventricular contractility compared to males at the
time of diagnosis, which may contribute to a potential survival advantage [38,39]. Females with PAH also may
respond better to certain therapies, as was recently shown
to be the case in a pooled analysis of subjects treated with
endothelin receptor antagonists [40]. Ultimately, there are
two critical issues for human subjects at risk: (1) do you
become a patient (develop PAH); and, (2) how long will
you survive with PAH. Determining the diverse array of
pieces that contribute to the ‘gender puzzle’ in PAH should
ultimately contribute to better therapy for all PAH patients,
and perhaps disease prevention. Estrogen-associated modification of BMPR2 expression may be one piece of that
puzzle, although much work remains to be done.
This study has several limitations. For example, the
human lymphocyte samples used were immortalized, so
that they were equal in hormone exposure; this allowed
for milieu uniformity but may not accurately replicate
the actual circulating hormone exposure in human subjects. Also, we were unable to distinguish between ERa
and ERb effect, although we understand that in many
cases the effect of the two is indistinguishable. Also,
since our previous work implicated specific products of
estrogen metabolism as a risk factor in PAH, comprehensive studies matching specific estrogen metabolites
to specific receptors in the context of suppression of
BMPR2 expression are warranted PAH [19,41].
Furthermore, while we detected a reduction in BMPR2
gene expression, the measurable functional consequences
on BMP signaling in the unstimulated state did not suggest reduced Smad-dependent (canonical BMP signaling)
effects. However, Smad-independent effects were not measured. We suspect that under normal circumstances the
influence of estrogens upon BMPR2 is not relevant, and
only becomes meaningful in the context of injury repair,
when BMPR2 appears to be in disequilibrium with the
canonical TGFb signaling pathway [42,43]. As with
BMPR2, estradiol decreases expression of TGFb1 and the
type 1 TGFb receptor in the lung vasculature [44]. Further
investigations are needed, but our findings may reflect the
complicated balance of BMPR2, the TGFb pathway and
associated events that result in PAH among susceptible
subjects (such as those with low BMPR2 at baseline), or
the possibility that Smad-independent effects mediate
downstream ramifications of BMPR2 gene expression
changes. In the context of cellular injury, a delicate balance of cellular differentiation and renewal characterize
the normal healing process, and it is possible that
enhanced estrogen exposures disrupt this balance. The
fact that estrogen exposure alters BMPR2 expression and
downstream signaling, while clearly complex, is novel and
may be relevant to PAH pathogenesis. Further studies will
be required to separate these related findings.
Conclusions
These studies strongly support the hypothesis that estrogen suppresses BMPR2 expression through direct
BMPR2 promoter binding by the estrogen receptor.
This provides one logical explanation for our finding of
reduced BMPR2 gene expression among females compared to males, and may contribute to the significant
gender disparity in pulmonary arterial hypertension. In
addition, this has potential implications for estrogenBMP cross-talk in many systems, while providing
another example of variation in gene expression according to gender.
