Endoscopic stenting for hilar cholangiocarcinoma:
efficacy of unilateral and bilateral placement of
plastic and metal stents in a retrospective review
of 480 patients
Manuel José Antunes Liberato* and Jorge Manuel Tavares Canena
Abstract
Background: Endoscopic biliary drainage of hilar cholangiocarcinoma is controversial with respect to the optimal
types of stents and the extent of drainage. This study evaluated endoscopic palliation in patients with hilar
cholangiocarcinoma using self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) and plastic stents (PS).We also compared unilateral
and bilateral stent placement according to the Bismuth classification.
Methods: Data on 480 patients receiving endoscopic biliary drainage for hilar cholangiocarcinoma between
September 1995 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the following outcome parameters:
technical success (TS), functional success (FS), early and late complications, stent patency and survival. Patients were
followed from stent insertion until death or stent occlusion. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the
Bismuth classification (Group 1, type I; Group 2, type II; Group 3, type > III).
Results: The initial stent insertion was successful in 450 (93.8%) patients. TS was achieved in 204 (88.3%) patients
treated with PS and in 246 (98.8%) patients palliated with SEMS (p < 0.001). In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,
the FS in patients treated with SEMS (97.9%) was significantly higher than in patients treated with PS (84.8%)
(p < 0.001). Late complications occurred in 115 (56.4%) patients treated with PS and 60 (24.4%) patients treated with
SEMS (p < 0.001). The median duration of stent patency in weeks (w) were as follows: 20 w in patients palliated with
PS and 27 w in patients treated with SEMS (p < 0.0001). In Group 2, the median duration of PS patency was 17 w
and 18 w for unilateral and bilateral placement, respectively (p = 0.0004); the median duration of SEMS patency was
24 w and 29 w for unilateral and bilateral placement, respectively (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis using the
Poisson regression showed that SEMS placement (B = 0.48; P < 0.01) and bilateral deployment (B = 0.24; P < 0.01)
were the only independent prognostic factors associated with stent patency.
Conclusions: SEMS insertion for the palliation of hilar cholangiocarcinoma offers higher technical and clinical
success rates in the ITT analysis as well as lower complication rates and a superior cumulative stent patency when
compared with PS placement in all Bismuth classifications. The cumulative patency of bilateral SEMS or PS stents
was significantly higher than that of unilateral SEMS or PS stents, with lower occlusion rates in Bismuth II patients.

Background
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the primary cancer of the
bile ducts and it arises from the malignant transformation of cholangiocytes, which are the epithelial cells
that line the biliary apparatus. Although it comprises
only 10-15% of hepatobiliary neoplasms, the incidence
of CCA has increased during the past 3 decades [1].
Hilar CCA was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity in 1965 when Klatskin [2] reported on a series of 13
patients. Malignancies of the biliary hilum have an extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of
less than 10% [3]. In the majority of cases, curative resection is not a therapeutic option, and palliation is the
main goal of therapy [3,4]. The relief of biliary obstruction not only reduces jaundice and associated pruritus
but also improves related symptoms such as anorexia
and disturbed sleep patterns and leads to an improved
quality of life [5]. Endoscopic biliary drainage is preferable to percutaneous or surgical procedures and has
become the standard of care because of its low invasiveness [4-7].
Endoscopic palliative bile duct drainage was first
reported by Soehendra et al. [8]. Currently, two types of
endoscopic stents are available. With the introduction of
duodenoscopes with 4.2-mm working channels in 1982,
the endoscopic insertion of large-bore plastic biliary
stents (PS) became possible [9]. The main disadvantage
of plastic endoprostheses is a relatively high occlusion
rate caused by biliary sludge, which occurs at a median
interval of 3 to 4 months after placement [3]. First
described in 1989 [10,11], self-expandable metal stents
(SEMS) are available with different lengths, diameters
and delivery devices. SEMS with a maximum diameter
of 10 mm theoretically offer the optimal conditions for
long-term drainage; however, only two prospective randomized trials have compared PS with SEMS in the
management of patients with hilar biliary obstruction
[12,13]. In an older study, Wagner et al. reported that
SEMS placement resulted in higher long-term patency
rates and higher technical success rates with diminished
costs [12]. A recent randomized controlled trial has just
been published, which demonstrated superior outcomes
in patients treated with metal stents both in terms of
success of drainage and survival [13]. One study [14]
reviewed a small number of consecutive patients who
underwent SEMS or PS placement for hilar obstruction
and also reported that SEMS yielded better outcomes. A
recent paper [15] comparing the clinical effectiveness of
SEMS and plastic stents in patients with inoperable hilar
CCA showed a significantly better stent patency for all
Bismuth classifications [16] when metal stents were
used. However, few comparative data are available from
a large number of patients to address whether PS
or SEMS is preferable for palliating malignant hilar
obstruction, and it remains unclear whether or not SEMS
placement is superior to plastic stent drainage.
The benefit of bilateral versus unilateral stenting continues to be debated [17-22]. Only one randomized controlled study using PS has compared unilateral with
bilateral drainage [20], and the authors concluded that
the insertion of more than one endoprostheses did not
appear to be justified as a routine procedure and that
single-stent insertion was effective. However Deviére
et al. [21] using two or more PS to achieve complete
drainage of the biliary system showed that this approach
improves survival and reduces procedure-related mortality and the incidence of early and late cholangitis when
compared to incomplete drainage. Thus far, no prospective randomized study has compared the unilateral and
bilateral placement of SEMS. A recent study suggested
more favorable cumulative stent patency with bilateral
over unilateral SEMS placement in cases of hilar obstruction, especially in cases of CCA [21]. The endoscopic deployment of bilateral SEMS is technically
challenging, even for experienced endoscopists. Various
techniques have been described for bilateral SEMS
placement [5,17,22-28]. The most commonly used technique is the stent-within-stent method, in which a wide
mesh SEMS (although a stent with a closed-cell configuration can also be used) is inserted into one side of the
hepatic duct, and a second SEMS is positioned on the
contralateral side across the mesh [23,24]. Recently,
SEMS with extra-wide open mesh designs in the central
portion to facilitate bilateral placement have been
described, and the initial trials have shown encouraging
results [25,26]. Other studies have described techniques to place the SEMS in a side-by-side configuration, with good results [5,17,22]. Recently, a novel
SEMS was developed with a 6 French delivery system
to allow a side-by-side pre-deployment insertion of
bilateral SEMS [27].
The aim of this article is to report on the experience
of our single tertiary-level center in the endoscopic palliation of hilar CCA during the last 15 years. In this study,
we compared the technical success, functional success,
early complications, late complications, stent patency
and survival for patients treated with PS and SEMS. We
also compared unilateral and bilateral stent placement
according to the Bismuth classification.
Methods
Patients and study design
This was a retrospective review of cases of endoscopically
inserted plastic and metal stents in patients with unresectable hilar CCA over a period of 15 years (September 1995
to December 2010). Data were retrospectively reviewed
from a dedicated prospective computerized endoscopy
database at a tertiary referral academic center (Center of
Liberato and Canena BMC Gastroenterology 2012, 12:103 Page 2 of 12

Gastroenterology, Cuf Infanto Santo Hospital, Lisbon,
Portugal). The diagnosis was based on ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiography,
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),
clinical history and histologic or cytologic confirmation
by pathologists. Histologic confirmation of cholangiocarcinoma was obtained in 82 patients (17%) by histopathologicevaluation of cytology (65 patients) or a biopsy of the
hilar lesion (17 patients). In patients without histological
confirmation the diagnosis was based on imaging and clinical outcome during follow-up. Patients were considered
to have an unresectable malignancy based on their medical fitness (57/480 patients - 11.9%) or disease extent
(423/480 patients - 88.1%). The follow-up continued from
stent insertion until patient death or stent occlusion. The
endoscopic and medical reports of these patients were
reviewed together with the radiological findings to determine the outcome in terms of the following parameters:
technical success, functional success, early and late complications, stent patency and survival. Hilar obstructions
were characterized by the Bismuth classification [16].
Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 included
patients with a type I malignant stricture, Group 2 included
patients with a Bismuth type II cancer and Group 3
included patients with Bismuth type III or IV strictures.
Patients in Group 1 were further divided into Group 1A if
they were palliated with PS or Group 1B if they underwent
SEMS placement. Patients in Group 2 had unilateral or
bilateral placement of PS or SEMS and were divided in 4
subgroups: Group 2A was palliated with 1 PS, Group 2B
was palliated with bilateral PS, Group 2C underwent 1
SEMS placement and Group 2D underwent bilateral SEMS
placement. Patients in Group 3 were divided into Group
3A if they underwent PS placement or Group 3B if they
received an SEMS. The intention-to-treat (ITT) and per
protocol (PP) methods were used in this analysis. The ITT
analysis was based on the original total cohort of patients
enrolled. The PP analysis was based on the subset of
patients with successful unilateral or bilateral stent placement. Patient characteristics and stent insertions were evaluated by the ITT analysis. Stent patency, complications and
survival were evaluated by the PP analysis. All patients
provided full, informed written consent prior to their procedures. The study was approved by our institutional
review board.
Definition of events
Technical success (TS) or successful stent insertion was
defined as the passage of the stent across the stricture
along with the flow of contrast medium and/or bile
through the stent. Functional success (FS) or successful
drainage was defined as a decrease in bilirubin to less
than 75% of the pre-treatment level within the first
month. Early and late complications were defined as
those occurring within 30 days and after 30 days of stent
placement, respectively, according to the criteria of
Cotton et al. [29]. Occlusion of the stent was considered
if patients had recurrent jaundice with cholestasis or
cholangitis (fever, increase in serum bilirubin, leucocytosis) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile duct, revealed by
imaging. Stent patency was defined as the period between stent insertion and stent occlusion or patient
death.
Technique
A prophylactic treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated before the procedure and continued for
10 days after. All procedures were performed by 2
experienced pancreatobiliary endoscopists (M.L. and J.
C.). ERCP procedures were performed with the patient
in the prone position under sedation, with propofol
administered by an anaesthesiologist. All endoscopic
examinations were performed using a therapeutic duodenoscope (TJF-145, TJF-160R, TJF-160VR, Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). The strategy used for biliary decompression was selected at the discretion of the endoscopist,
based on the location and complexity of the strictures as
well as the expected time of survival of the patient. Plastic stents were not changed routinely, and patients were
treated if occlusion of the stent or cholangitis developed.
Unilateral PS stenting was done with 10 French stents. If
the patient had bilateral PS placed, at least one of the
stents had a diameter of 10 French. Decision on unilateral versus bilateral endoscopic drainage was left to the
discretion of the endoscopist based on location and
complexity of the strictures. Biliary sphincterotomy was
performed in all cases to facilitate single or bilateral
stent placement.
For bilateral SEMS placement, we routinely use a previously described stent-within-stent technique (Figure 1)
[23,24]. In a small subset of patients, bilateral drainage
with SEMS was achieved using 2 different side-by-side
techniques. In the first technique, as described in detail
elsewhere [27], we used a novel non-foreshortening
metal stent with a 6 French delivery system (Zilver 635;
Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC) to enable side-byside bilateral hilar deployment because duodenoscopes
with 4.2-mm working channels allow the simultaneous
delivery of both stents. After bilateral guidewire placement, the Zilver 635 biliary uncovered metal stent deployment system was sequentially introduced over the
guidewires into the left and right hepatic ducts in a sideby-side fashion. Biliary dilatation was performed as
needed to facilitate stent placement. The stents were
then carefully deployed across the strictures in alternating/sequential fashion between the left and right sides
until full deployment was achieved (Figure 2). All SEMS
used had a 10-mm luminal diameter and an 80-mm

length. In the second technique, we also performed
placement of bilateral stents in a sequential fashion
[5,17,22]. After the insertion of bilateral guidewires, we
performed bilateral balloon dilatation of the stenosis.
The first SEMS was usually placed in the left hepatic
duct. The second SEMS was advanced to the right hepatic duct after the expansion of the initial stent. Stents
are usually placed with their distal ends at the same
level intraductally, i.e., not in a transpapillary position
(Figure 3). Special care was taken to place both SEMS at
the same level to facilitate re-entry in future if needed.
Follow-up
Follow-up continued from stent insertion to the death of
the patient or to the stent occlusion for all patients. Only
patients in whom the stent occlusion was reviewed in
our center were included in the study. Follow-up was
obtained by reviewing clinical notes provided by regular
clinic visits or by medical assistant reports, lab results,
imaging, data on our prospective database and structured telephone interviews with medical assistants or
family during follow-up or at the time of manuscript
preparation. Patients with incomplete follow-up were
excluded from the study. All of the patients were dead at
the time of manuscript preparation.
Statistical analysis
Student’s t test and the χ2 test were used to calculate the
statistical significance of different demographic and clinical variables when appropriate. Cumulative stent patency and cumulative patient survival were calculated by
the Kaplan-Meier method, and groups were compared
by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted
using a Poisson regression to determine possible factors

affecting stent patency. Age, sex, type of stent and type
of deployment (unilateral vs. bilateral stent placement)
were the variables included in the analysis. All reported
P-values were for two-sided test and a P-value less than
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS (Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences) 18 (IBM Corporation,
New York, USA) and STATA v11.0 (StataCorp Lp,
College Station, Texas, USA).
Results
Patients
A total of 12850 records for ERCP procedures that occurred between September 1995 and December 2010 were
identified in the endoscopy database. In total, 528 records
for patients with hilar CCA who underwent endoscopic
insertion of plastic and metal stents were selected in the
endoscopy database. Forty-eight of these patients were
excluded for the following reasons: incomplete data
concerning endoscopic procedures and follow-up (37
patients) and further surgery after the initial stenting
(11 patients).
In total, 480 patients (249 male and 231 female) with a
mean age of 74.6 years (range: 45–96) were enrolled in
the study. There were 231 and 249 patients palliated
with PS and SEMS, respectively. The characteristics of
the patients are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the demographics between patients
treated with PS and those treated with SEMS or for unilateral and bilateral stenting, overall and among the
groups defined earlier in the Methods section.
Stent insertion
The outcomes of the stent insertion are shown in Tables 2
and 3. The initial stent insertion (Table 2) was successful
in 450 (93.8%) patients. TS was achieved in 204 (88.3%)
and 246 (98.8%) patients palliated with PS and SEMS,
respectively. There were 30 patients with failed endoscopic
endoprostheses placement. Among these patients, 10
received percutaneous drainage, 4 underwent surgery and
the remaining 16 were considered unfit for further
interventions and transferred to palliative care. FS was
achieved in 440 patients (ITT = 91.6%; PP = 97.8%). All
patients with failed successful drainage were in Group 3
(8 in Group 3A and 2 in Group 3B). These patients
showed no improvement of bilirubin after the stent placement because of extensive hepatic involvement. Five of
these patients underwent bilateral percutaneous biliary
drainage without significant reductions in the bilirubin
level. The remaining 5 patients had significant comorbidities and very advanced disease, and they were not candidates for further intervention. SEMS comparison with PS

provided significantly different degrees of technical success, overall (P < 0.001) and in Group 1 (P = 0.036), Group
2 (P = 0.008) and Group 3 (P < 0.001). In the ITT analysis,
the FS in patients treated with SEMS was significantly
higher than that in patients treated with PS overall
(P < 0.001) and in Group 1 (P = 0.036), Group 2 (P = 0.008)
and Group 3 (P < 0.001). In the PP analysis, the functional
success in patients treated with SEMS was significantly
higher than that in patients treated with PS both overall
(P = 0.026) and in Group 3 (P < 0.001).
Stent insertion outcomes for Group 2 are shown in
Table 3. Bilateral stenting was performed in 38 patients
with PS and in 42 patients with SEMS. Bilateral PS was
attempted in 40 patients, and stents were successfully
placed in 38 patients (95%). The remaining 2 patients
had unilateral PS placement. Failure to place the guidewire in the contralateral duct was the reason for failure
in these 2 patients. Bilateral SEMS placement was
attempted in 45 patients, and successful bilateral drainage was achieved in 42 (93.3%) patients. The remaining
3 patients were treated with unilateral SEMS. The main
reason for unsuccessful bilateral SEMS insertion was a
failure to place the guidewire into the contralateral hepatic duct through the interstices of the initial SEMS. The
stent-within-stent technique was used in 36/42 patients
(85.7%), whereas the side-by-side stent placement was
used in 6/42 patients (14.3%). There were no significant differences in the ITT and PP analyses of TS

and FS in patients with unilateral vs. bilateral PS and
SEMS placement.
Complications and reinterventions
Early complications
Early complications (Table 4) occurred in 17 (8.3%) patients
treated with PS and in 5 (2.0%) patients who underwent
SEMS placement (P = 0.002). Early complications included
pancreatitis, bleeding and stent failure (occlusion and migration). There was no procedure-related mortality.
Late complications
Late complications (Table 4) occurred in 115 (56.4%)
patients treated with PS and in 60 (24.4%) patients treated with SEMS, and these differences were significant
(P < 0.001). All late complications were stent-related and
included migration (only in PS patients), occlusion and
cholangitis. There were significant differences in occlusion and cholangitis when comparing patients treated
with PS and those treated with SEMS. Repeat endoscopic biliary drainage because of stent failure was
required in 56.4% of patients with PS. In the group of
patients with SEMS, 75.6% did not require any further
intervention. In Group 2, 17/21 (80.9%) patients with
unilateral PS placement and 13/38 (34.2%) patients treated with bilateral PS stenting (P < 0.001) had stent
occlusion, respectively. Repeat endoscopic biliary drainage because of stent occlusion was required for 11/35
(31.4%) patients treated with one SEMS versus 5/42
(11.9%) patients with bilateral SEMS placement
(P = 0.036).
More reinterventions were required in the PS group
(n = 127) than in the SEMS group (n = 60) for stent failure and these differences were statistically significant
(P < 0.001).
Stent patency
Patients treated with PS and SEMS had a median time
to occlusion of 20 weeks (range: 3–25; mean: 18.9) and
27 weeks (range: 8–54; mean: 27.1), respectively.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative stent
patency times were significantly longer in patients
treated with SEMS than in those treated with PS
(P < 0.0001); the estimated relative risk of occlusion
(hazard ratio-HR) was 2.6731-fold higher in the PS
group than in the SEMS group, (95% CI 2.1416-3.3365)
(Figure 4). The median stent patency time was 22 weeks
(range: 14–25; mean: 22) in Group 1A and 35 weeks
(range: 25–54; mean: 35) in Group 1B. These differences
were significant (P < 0.0001); the HR was 4.6219 higher
in Group 1A than in Group 1B, (95% CI 3.2799-6.5129).
In Group 3A, stent occlusion occurred after a median
time of 12 weeks (range: 3–14; mean: 11), whereas in
Group 3B, the median time to occlusion was 17 weeks
(range: 8–20; mean: 16) (P < 0.0001). The HR was
3.8195-fold higher in Group 3A than in Group 3B, (95%
CI 1.9186-7.6037). The median stent patency time was
17 weeks (range: 7–18; mean: 15) in Group 2A (PS, unilateral) and 18 weeks (range: 12–22; mean: 18) in Group
2B (PS, bilateral). The median stent patency time was
24 weeks (range: 18–26; mean: 23) in Group 2C (SEMS,
unilateral) and 29 weeks (range: 22–28; mean: 30) in

Group 2D (SEMS, bilateral). Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed a significant difference in the cumulative stent
patency time for bilateral and unilateral plastic stenting
(P = 0.0004), and the HR was 2.2355-fold higher in
Group 2A than in Group 2B (95% CI 1.1787-4.2399)
(Figure 5). The cumulative stent patency time for bilateral SEMS stenting was significantly longer than that for
unilateral SEMS stenting (p < 0.0001), with an HR that
was 3.6934 higher in Group 2C than in Group 2D (95%
CI 2.0755-6.5724) (Figure 5). Multivariate analysis using
the Poisson regression showed that SEMS placement
(B = 0.48; P < 0.01) and bilateral deployment (B = 0.24;
P < 0.01) were the only independent prognostic factors
associated with stent patency.
Survival
The median survival time was 46 weeks (range: 9–61;
mean: 46.1) and 45 weeks (range: 7–59; mean: 44.9)
in patients treated with PS and SEMS, respectively.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no differences in the
cumulative survival between the 2 groups (P = 0.18),
with an HR 1.1777-fold higher in the SEMS group
than in the PS group (95 % CI 0.9104-1.5236).
Discussion
According to our findings, in a retrospective review of
480 patients, the palliation of hilar CCA with SEMS was
associated with successful stent insertion and successful
drainage in the ITT analysis as well as a lower complication rate and increased cumulative stent patency compared with PS placement for all Bismuth classifications.
The outcome in terms of FS after PS insertion in
patients with advanced disease (Group 3) was very poor.
In a subset of patients with Bismuth type II hilar strictures, the cumulative stent patency of bilateral SEMS or
PS placement was significantly higher than that of unilateral SEMS or PS stenting, with lower occlusion rates.
In this group of patients, bilateral SEMS placement
offered the best results in terms of cumulative stent patency and occlusion rates.
Our data results from a single academic tertiary center
which is a referral center for ERCPs especially difficult cases
and tumors. It is the largest center in the country receiving
patients from 20–30 hospitals all over the southern part of
the country. We perform an average of 850 ERCPs per year,
thus having a huge inclusion potential as far as hilar CCAs
are concerned. Furthermore our center is the main referral
center for endoscopic palliation of malignancies, coming
from oncology, gastroenterology and surgical centers.
There have been few comparative studies regarding PS
and SEMS placement in hilar CCA, and because such
data are scarce, no clear consensus has been reached
regarding the optimal approach in these patients. A recent randomized trial randomly allocated 108 patients to
SEMS or PS placement [13]. The authors reported that
endoscopic biliary drainage with SEMS was associated
with significantly successful drainage rate and longer
survival compared with PS placement. Raju et al. [15] recently presented a retrospective review of 100 patients
who underwent PS and SEMS placement for inoperable
hilar CCA. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the Bismuth classification, similarly to our study.
The SEMS group demonstrated a significantly higher
patency (5.56 vs. 1.86 months) and required fewer reinterventions for stent obstruction. The authors concluded that the patency of metallic stents was superior

to that of PS in all Bismuth classifications, although a
clear comparison between the groups was not presented
in the paper.
Our study suggests that patency of SEMS is significantly longer with lower occlusion rates when compared
with PS. In our paper, the duration of patency in the
plastic stent group was longer than previously reported
[15,30]. This finding may be due to the result of the high
number of patients with Bismuth type I strictures enrolled
in our study, as PS placed in patients with more advanced
disease tend to have shorter patency times [15,30]. The
use of SEMS in hilar CCA has multiple theoretical advantages, including a small and flexible delivery system that
allows for better technical success and flexibility and a
mesh network that enables not only a more stable conformation with the tortuous hilar anatomy but also drainage of subsegmental ducts. In our study, we found better
TS when using SEMS, which could be related to the inherent characteristics of the stents, as long and inflexible
large-bore plastic stents are difficult to place in complex
strictures. Overall, the TS was high in both groups (88.3%
in the PS group and 98.8 % in the SEMS group), and these
differences were significant. More complex strictures
showed greater differences in TS when comparing PS
with SEMS. Even in Group 1, there were significant differences between the two stent types (95.7% versus
100%), and this finding reflects our large sample size. As
expected, the FS of PS placement in patients with more
advanced disease (Group 3) was lowest, not only in the
ITT analysis but also in the PP analysis. This finding
could be the result of the lack of side holes in this type
of stent, which can result in reduced drainage from secondary branch ducts. In our study, PS were not routinely changed, which was the main cause of the
significantly higher rate of late complications associated
with stent failure in patients treated with PS. Overall,
our study suggests that PS stenting is associated with
worse outcomes than SEMS placement; therefore, endoscopic palliation with PS should be reserved for presurgical biliary drainage when needed and for patients
with a short expected survival time.
The optimal technique for endoscopic palliative metal
placement and the benefits of bilateral versus unilateral
stenting are still controversial and highly debated. De
Palma et al. [20] reported the only prospective randomized controlled study comparing unilateral and bilateral drainage using plastic stents in 157 patients. In the
ITT analysis, unilateral placement had a significantly
higher rate of stent insertion (88.6% vs. 76.9%) and a
lower rate of complications and early cholangitis than bilateral placement. The authors concluded that the routine insertion of more than one stent would not be
justified and that single stent insertion avoids the risk of
further procedure-related complications and mortality.
However these results need to be interpreted with caution because of some study biases. Information about
stent patency and occlusion rates in both groups was
not available. Furthermore subgroup analysis of patients
was not done and there was a high number of patients
with Bismuth type I stricture included for which placement of one stent is sufficient; thus it is impossible to
find out how results might have been affected by their
inclusion. A recent retrospective review of 46 patients
with hilar malignant obstruction compared unilateral
with bilateral SEMS stenting [22]. Cumulative stent patency was significantly increased with bilateral stenting
(median patency of 488 days vs. 210 days, P = 0.009), especially in cases of CCA.
Endoscopic bilateral metal drainage poses particular challenges for endoscopists and has been considered to be
more technically challenging than unilateral stenting
[5,17,19,22-28,31]. Various techniques have been described
for bilateral SEMS placement, and in the absence of a truly
Y-shaped SEMS, the creation of a Y-shaped stent configuration across the hilar bifurcation requires the placement of
straight SEMS in either a nested or parallel configuration.
Most endoscopists use the stent-within-stent technique
previously described [23,24] in this paper. Theoretically,
stent-within-stent deployment may prevent bile influx into
the area of stent overlap, leading to sludge formation. Furthermore, tumor ingrowth can occur more easily through
an expanded stent mesh in the area of overlap. In addition,
a nested SEMS configuration can be difficult to revise when
cancer ingrowth obstructs the stents. To facilitate nested Yshaped SEMS placement across the biliary confluence,
SEMS placement with an extra-large open mesh in the central portion of the stent has been described. Kim et al. [25]
reported their experience in 34 patients, in which TS was
achieved in 85.3% patients, and the FS in the PP analysis
was noted to be 100%. Stent obstruction occurred in 31%
of the patients, and the median duration of stent patency
was 239 days.
Endoscopic bilateral metal stenting can also be accomplished using a parallel arrangement known as side-byside deployment [5,17,22]. It has been reported that this
technique occasionally causes portal vein occlusion and
increases the rate of cholangitis because of the excessive
expansion of the bile duct by parallel stents [22]. In some
cases, this technique is impossible once one SEMS has
been deployed, even if a second guidewire is already in the
contralateral duct, because the first stent may press into
the bile-duct wall and prevent passage of the delivery system for the second SEMS. One solution for this problem
[5] is to place a temporary plastic stent in a sub-hilar position, with 2 guidewires placed in the right and left hepatic
ducts, before deployment of the first SEMS. After the
placement of the first SEMS beside the plastic stent, the
delivery catheter for the second SEMS is advanced into
Liberato and Canena BMC Gastroenterology 2012, 12:103 Page 9 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/12/103

the contralateral duct, with the plastic stent maintaining
the passage. Following the deployment of the second
SEMS, the plastic stent is removed. Another solution to
side-by-side SEMS placement is to use the novel SEMS
with a 6 F delivery system. Using this technique, Chennat
et al. [27] reported a TS of 100% (10/10 patients) and a
median stent patency of 130 days. The side-by-side approach may facilitate subsequent endoscopic access to
both drained ductal segments. A recent study [32] compared side-by-side versus stent-within-stent deployment in
52 consecutive patients with malignant hilar obstruction.
The authors found no differences in TS and FS between
groups. Side-by-side deployment was associated with a
higher rate of complications and a significantly better stent
patency in Kaplan-Meyer analysis but not on multivariate
analysis. Overall is not clear that a technique is better than
the other and further studies on this issue are needed.
In our study, bilateral stenting was only reported in
patients with Bismuth type II strictures because in our
retrospective review, patients with Bismuth type III
and IV strictures who underwent bilateral stenting
were short in numbers and had an incomplete followup with important data missing; therefore, they could
not be included in the study. Furthermore we avoid
attempting bilateral stenting in very advanced disease
because in cases of complex hilar strictures bilateral
stenting may not be sufficient for complete drainage.
In these patients complete drainage is achieved by 3
or more metal stents and even successful bilateral
stenting in advanced disease can leave some ducts
filled with contrast undrained [33]. Injection of contrast into intrahepatic ducts that cannot be adequately
drained should be avoided, as this practice is associated with worse outcomes [19]. A recent study by
Costamagna group suggests that multiple SEMS can
be placed in hilar malignant strictures with promising
results and that SEMS malfunctions can be easily
managed [34]. In our study using metal stents, bilateral
placement was successful in 42/45 (94.3%) patients,
and these results are comparable to those of
other reports that found a TS rate between 80-100%
[17,22,24-27]. The median stent patency time of our
bilateral metal stenting was 29 weeks, which was similar to the 130 to 239 day range [17,22,24-27] reported
by other authors, except for Naitoh et al. [21], who
reported a median stent patency of 488 days. We
found a significantly lower occlusion rate with bilateral
metal stenting (11.9% versus 31.4%) compared with
unilateral SEMS placement. Our bilateral stent occlusion rate compares favorably to previously reported
values of between 23 and 40% [22,24-27], although a
recent study reported an occlusion rate of 6% [26].
We also found that bilateral PS stenting was significantly better than unilateral PS placement in terms of
patency and occlusion rates. The differences in patency
were small (median 17 weeks; mean 15 weeks for
unilateral versus median 18 weeks; mean 18 weeks
for bilateral) but statistically significant. In contrast to
the present study, De Palma et al. [20] did not report
stent patency and occlusion rates. Furthermore, in the
study of De Palma et al., the poor results of bilateral
stenting from the ITT analysis with high rates of
cholangitis and lower TS suggest that the opacification of both lobes was performed even in patients
with advanced disease. As mentioned earlier in this
paper we did not attempt to place 2 PS stents in
patients with advanced disease (Bismuth III and IV
strictures) where bilateral stenting may not be sufficient for complete drainage, leaving ducts undrained
with associated cholangitis. Taken together, these findings suggest that bilateral stenting is better than unilateral stenting, and the best results are produced
with bilateral metal placement especially in patients
with Bismuth type II strictures.
We did not find significant differences in survival, although some of the patients with bilateral metal stenting
had improved survival time especially those free from
re-intervention and occlusion with cholangitis. Although
cholangitis has a negative impact on survival time,
survival depends mainly on the disease stage and we had
more patients (49 vs. 72) with advanced disease (Group
3) in the SEMS group, and we can speculate that was
the main reason why, in this study, SEMS placement did
not translate into a survival benefit. A recent randomized trial comparing PS with SEMS has shown a survival benefit for patients treated with SEMS [13]. In our
study patients treated with SEMS had a lower rate of reinterventions and complications and we can speculate
that can be translated into a better quality of life. Furthermore, although a cost/benefit analysis was not done,
the lower number of re-interventions, days at hospital
and hospital re-admission found in patients submitted to
SEMS placement suggests a clear benefit for SEMS and
in future studies that type of analysis, along with quality
of life improvement should be undertaken.
Several limitations of our study should be taken into
account. This was a retrospective study from a single
tertiary center. Bilateral stenting was only reported in
patients with Bismuth type II hilar strictures. The study
was performed over 15 years using different materials,
guidewires, stents and techniques, and this variation
could have affected the rates of TS and FS, especially
considering the plastic stents used in the 1990s. We suggest that further studies with a prospective randomized
controlled design are needed in which bilateral and multiple metal stenting (in complex hilar strictures and
advanced disease) can be compared with unilateral
placement of SEMS across all Bismuth classifications of
Liberato and Canena BMC Gastroenterology 2012, 12:103 Page 10 of 12

hilar CCA in terms of TS, stent patency, need for reintervention, complications and improvement of the
quality of life. In these proposed studies, different techniques for bilateral metal stent placement should also be
compared.
The strengths of our study are the large number of
patients included, both overall and in the different Bismuth classifications, when comparing plastic with
metal stents, as well as the examination of bilateral
stenting using both plastic and metal stents in a large
subset of patients, which allowed comparisons between
the outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the largest series
of endoscopic palliation of hilar CCA ever reported.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data suggest that endoscopic palliation of hilar CCA with SEMS should be considered the
standard of care, as it offers higher technical and clinical
success rates in an ITT analysis as well as lower complication rates, lower number of reinterventions and superior cumulative stent patency when compared with PS
placement for all Bismuth classifications. The cumulative
stent patency of bilateral SEMS or PS stenting was significantly higher than that of unilateral SEMS or PS
stenting, with lower occlusion rates in Bismuth type II
patients. In this group of patients, bilateral SEMS placement offered the best results in terms of cumulative
stent patency and the need for repeat endoscopic biliary
drainage resulting from stent occlusion.
