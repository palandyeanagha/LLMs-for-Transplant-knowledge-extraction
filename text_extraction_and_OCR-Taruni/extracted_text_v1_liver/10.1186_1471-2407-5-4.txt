Abstract
Background: Tumor development remains one of the major obstacles following organ
transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus directly contribute
to enhanced malignancy, whereas the influence of the novel compound mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) on tumor cell dissemination has not been explored. We therefore investigated the adhesion
capacity of colon, pancreas, prostate and kidney carcinoma cell lines to endothelium, as well as their
beta1 integrin expression profile before and after MMF treatment.
Methods: Tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers was evaluated in the presence of
0.1 and 1 µM MMF and compared to unstimulated controls. beta1 integrin analysis included
alpha1beta1 (CD49a), alpha2beta1 (CD49b), alpha3beta1 (CD49c), alpha4beta1 (CD49d),
alpha5beta1 (CD49e), and alpha6beta1 (CD49f) receptors, and was carried out by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.
Results: Adhesion of the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 was strongly reduced in the presence
of 0.1 µM MMF. This effect was accompanied by down-regulation of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1
surface expression and of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 coding mRNA. Adhesion of the prostate
tumor cell line DU-145 was blocked dose-dependently by MMF. In contrast to MMF's effects on
HT-29 cells, MMF dose-dependently up-regulated alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, and
alpha5beta1 on DU-145 tumor cell membranes.
Conclusion: We conclude that MMF possesses distinct anti-tumoral properties, particularly in
colon and prostate carcinoma cells. Adhesion blockage of HT-29 cells was due to the loss of
alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 surface expression, which might contribute to a reduced invasive
behaviour of this tumor entity. The enhancement of integrin beta1 subtypes observed in DU-145
cells possibly causes re-differentiation towards a low-invasive phenotype.

Background
With the improved long-term outcome of allograft recipients in the cyclosporine or tacrolimus era, malignant
tumors have become increasingly important. Malignant
tumours develop in 15–20% of graft recipients after 10
years, and thus contribute substantially to the morbidity
and mortality of these patients [1]. Malignancies can
develop in three ways: de-novo occurrence in the recipient, recurrent malignancy in the recipient or transmission
of malignancy from the donor. In all cases, the post-transplant treatment regimen and the level of immunosuppression are high risk factors due to the long-term
modification of the immune system.
During the last years, the novel immunosuppressive drug
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been introduced into
the clinical protocol to overcome severe side effects associated with cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Meanwhile, it has
become part of the immunosuppressive regimen after
liver, kidney or heart transplantation [2]. Still, the influence of MMF on tumor recurrence or de novo malignancy
has not been explored.
MMF effects are based on the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and prevention of
guanosine monophosphate synthesis from inosine
monophosphate, a rate-limiting step in the purine biosynthesis in lymphocytes. Consequently, MMF blocks the
proliferation and clonal expansion of T and B lymphocytes, and prevents the generation of cytotoxic T cells,
as well as other effector T cells [3]. Additional mechanisms may also contribute to the efficacy of MMF in preventing allograft rejection. By depleting guanosine
nucleotides, MMF suppresses glycosylation and the
expression of some adhesion molecules, thereby decreasing the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes into
sites of inflammation and graft rejection [3]. Immunoprecipitation studies have shown that one of the glycoproteins affected is the lymphocytic alpha4beta1 integrin, the
ligand for VCAM-1 on activated endothelial cells. Further
experiments have revealed inhibition of the integrin LFA1, the counter-receptor of ICAM-1, after MMF administration [4,5].
The integrins constitute a family of transmembrane receptor proteins composed of heterodimeric complexes of
noncovalently linked alpha and beta chains. Integrins
function in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix
(ECM) adhesive interactions and transduce signals from
the ECM to the cell interior and vice versa. For various
types of cancers, different changes in integrin expression
are closely associated with tumor growth and metastasis.
Based on the knowledge that MMF modulates integrin
expression, we postulated that MMF might not only suppress leukocyte recruitment to the donor graft, but also
prevent integrin-dependent tumor dissemination. To
explore how far MMF might serve as a metastasis-blocking
agent, we investigated the beta1 integrin subunit expression pattern of colon, kidney, pancreas and prostate
tumor cells before and after MMF treatment, as well as
MMF effects on tumor cell adhesion to human endothelium in vitro.
The present study indicates that MMF possesses antitumoral properties particularly to colon and prostate carcinoma cells. Alterations of the beta1 integrin profile are
responsible for blocking tumor cell adhesion to vascular
endothelium.
Methods
Cell cultures
Kidney carcinoma Caki I cells, pancreatic carcinoma
DanG cells and colonic adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells G
were obtained from the tumor cell bank of Johannes
Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. Prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). Tumor cells were grown and
subcultured in RPMI1640 medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified, 5%
CO2 incubator.
Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from human
umbilical veins and harvested by enzymatic treatment
with chymotrypsin. HUVEC were grown in Medium 199
(Biozol, Munich, Germany), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany), 10% pooled human serum
(Blood Bank of The German Red Cross, Frankfurt am
Main, Germany), 20 µg/ml endothelial cell growth factor
(Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 0.1% heparin
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 100 ng/ml gentamycin
(Gibco) and 2% 1 M HEPES-buffer (Seromed, Berlin, Germany). To control the purity of HUVEC cultures, cells
were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
labelled monoclonal antibody against Factor VIII-associated antigen (Von Willebrand factor; clone F8/86; Dako,
Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed microscopically or by
FACscan (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany; FL-1H
(log) channel histogram analysis; 1 × 104 cells/scan). Cell
cultures with a purity > 95% were serially passaged. Subcultures from passages 2–4 were selected for experimental
use.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
Tumor cells were pretreated with MMF (Roche Bioscience,
Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) (0.1 µM, 1 µM). Before adding the MMF-treated tumor cells to HUVEC (monolayer
adhesion assay), cell cultures were washed to remove
MMF from the medium. Results were compared to
untreated controls.

Viability of tumor cells in presence of MMF was assessed
by propidium iodide dsDNA-intercalation or quantitative
fluorescence analysis of enzyme-catalyzed fluoresceindiacetate metabolism.
Monolayer adhesion assay
HUVEC were transferred to six-well multiplates (Falcon
Primaria; Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) in
complete HUVEC-medium. When confluency was
reached, 0.5 × 106 tumor cells of each entity/well were
carefully added to the HUVEC monolayer for 60 min.
Subsequently, non-adherent tumor cells were washed off
using warmed (37°C) Medium 199. The adherent cells
were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and counted in five
different fields (5 × 0.25 mm2) using a phase contrast
microscope (20 × objective) to calculate the mean cellular
adhesion rate.
Evaluation of integrin surface expression
Tumor cells were washed in blocking solution (PBS, 0.5%
BSA) and then incubated for 60 min at 4°C with the FITCconjugated monoclonal antibody anti-alpha2beta1 (Becton Dickinson; clone AK-7), anti-alpha4beta1 (Cymbus
Biotechnology, Hofheim, Germany; clone HP2I1), antialpha5beta1 (Cymbus Biotechnology; clone SAM-1),
anti-alpha6beta1 (Becton Dickinson; clone GOH3), or
with the PE-conjugated monoclonal antibody antialpha1beta1 (Becton Dickinson; clone SR84), or antialpha3beta1 (Becton Dickinson; clone C3II1). Integrin
expression of tumor cells was then measured using a FACscan (Becton Dickinson; FL-1H (log) channel histogram
analysis; 1 × 104 cells/scan) and expressed as mean fluorescence units (MFU).
A mouse IgG1-FITC was used as an isotype control for
FITC conjugated antibodies. To evaluate background
staining of PE conjugated antibodies, goat anti mouse
IgG-PE was used (all: Cymbus Biotechnology).
To analyze integrin beta1 distribution on the cell membrane, tumor cells were transferred to round cover slips
(pretreated with 2% 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilan)
placed in a 24 well multiplate. Upon reaching confluency,
cell cultures were washed and fixed in cold (-20°C) methanol/acetone (60/40 v/v). Subsequently, cells were incubated for 60 min with unconjugated anti-integrin
monoclonal antibodies. Indocarbocyanine (Cy 3™; Dianova; working dilution: 1:50) conjugated goat-anti-mouse
IgG was then added as the secondary antibody. To prevent
photobleaching of the fluorescent dye, cover glasses with
stained cells were taken out of the wells and the residual
liquid was removed. These were then embedded in an
antifade reagent / mounting medium mixture (ProLong™
Antifade Kit, MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) and
mounted on slides. The slides were viewed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 10; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a plan-neofluar ×100 / 1.3 oil immersion
objective.
mRNA expression of beta1 integrins
mRNA expression of beta1 integrins was evaluated by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Tumor cells were seeded in 50 ml culture flasks (25 cm2
growth area; Falcon Primaria, Becton Dickinson) and cultured with or without MMF. Total RNA was extracted by
using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RNA
samples were then treated with 80 U/ml of Rnase-free
Dnase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany)
for 60 min at 37°C, to eliminate amplifiable contaminating genomic DNA. Subsequently, samples were incubated
for 10 min at 65°C to inactivate Dnase. Complementary
DNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA per sample
with a 60 min incubation at 42°C, using the Moloney
murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany) and oligo-(dT) priming (Boehringer
Mannheim). Amplification was carried out using gene
specific primers and Platinum-Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a Mastercycler Gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany). Reactions were performed in the
presence of 0.5 µl cDNA, with an initial incubation step at
95°C for 2 min. Cycling conditions consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec and
extension at 72°C for 30 sec over a total of 30 cycles. The
reaction was completed by another 10 min incubation
step at 72°C. The specific sequences for sense and antisense primers are shown in table 1. The PCR products
were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide.
Statistical analysis
All studies were performed 3–6 times. Statistical significance was investigated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test
showing two-sided probabilities and using normal
approximation. Differences were considered statistically
significant at a p value less than 0.05.

Results
MMF modulates tumor cell adhesion to HUVEC
The 60 min adhesion rates of tumor cells were calculated
at 22.5 ± 4.1 DanG cells/0.25 mm2, 39,8 ± 10.5 DU-145
cells/0.25 mm2, 55,3 ± 11.7 Caki I cells/0.25 mm2, or 80,5
± 17.2 HT-29 cells/0.25 mm2. MMF differentially modulated the adhesive capacity of the tumor cells which was
strongly dependent on the drug concentration and the cell
line used (figure 1). Adhesion of DanG cells was weakly
reduced by 1 µM MMF. A modest down-regulating effect
was seen on Caki I cells at a MMF concentration of 0.1 µM.
Strong and significant adhesion blockade was achieved
when HT-29 cells were treated with 0.1 µM MMF (p =
0.0079). This effect was reverted at a dosage of 1 µM. Furthermore, MMF dose-dependently and significantly
reduced the adhesive capacity of DU-145 cells with a maximum effect at 1 µM (p = 0.0079). In all experiments, cell
viability was not impaired by MMF.

The distribution pattern of those integrins which were
predominantly expressed on the respective tumor cell line
was further explored by confocal microscopy (figure 4).
alpha2beta1 (DanG cells), alpha3beta1 (Caki I, DanG
HT-29 cells), and alpha6beta1 integrins (HT-29 cells)
were distributed homogenously among the cell surface. In
contrast, alpha1beta1 integrins on Caki I cells accumulated mainly at the sites of cell-cell-contacts.
MMF modulates beta1 integrin surface expression
MMF evoked distinct alterations of the beta1 integrin
expression pattern (figure 5). MMF only slightly changed
alpha1beta1, alpha3beta1, and alpha5beta1 integrin surface levels on Caki I cells (figure 5A), and weakly downregulated alpha2beta1 on DanG cells when applied at 1
µM (figure 5B). However, 0.1 µM MMF strongly and significantly diminished alpha3beta1 (p = 0.0022) and
alpha6beta1 integrins (p = 0.035) on HT-29 cells (figure
5C). This effect was reverted at concentrations of 1 µM
MMF. The alpha3beta1 receptor became even slightly
enhanced, compared to control values. alpha1beta1,
alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha5beta1 on DU-145 cells
were up-regulated significantly by MMF in a dose-dependent fashion, whereby strongest effects were seen on

alpha2beta1 surface level in the presence of 1 µM MMF
(>70% fluorescence enhancement, compared to nontreated controls; p = 0.0022; figure 5D).
Influence of MMF on beta1 integrin coding mRNA
To allow a clear interpretation of the strong effects of MMF
on adhesion and beta1 integrin surface expression of HT29 and DU-145 cells, MMF evoked alterations of gene
activity was also evaluated in these cell lines (figure 6).
Control experiments using non-treated HT-29 cells
revealed high alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1
mRNA expression level (figure 6A). Application of 0.1 µM
MMF induced down-regulation of alpha3beta1 and
alpha6beta1 coding mRNA, which paralleled MMF's
influence on receptor surface expression. The effect was
reverted at a dosage of 1 µM. alpha3beta1 and
alpha6beta1 coding mRNA became even slightly
enhanced, compared to control experiments. With respect
to the prostate tumor cell line DU-145, alpha1beta1,
alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 coding
mRNA was clearly detected in untreated cell cultures.
Both, 0.1 µM and 1 µM MMF reduced mRNA of beta1
integrin subtypes, although the effect was more pronounced in the presence of 0.1 µM MMF (figure 6B).
Discussion
Although MMF has become part of the standard regimen
after organ transplantation its impact on tumor development and dissemination is still not clear.
Our adhesion experiments demonstrate that MMF downregulates binding of tumor cells to endothelium, which
might argue for anti-tumoral properties of this
compound. Notably, HT-29 and DU-145 cells responded
well to MMF (-70% adhesion reduction), while Caki I and
DanG tumor cells were influenced only modestly. From a
clinical viewpoint, distinct adhesion-blocking properties
of MMF might be limited to colon and prostate carcinoma
cells. Interestingly, HT-29 cells were more susceptible to
MMF than DU-145 cells: 0.1 µM MMF was sufficient to
significantly diminish adhesion of HT-29 cells, whereas 1
µM MMF was necessary to evoke maximum effects on DU145 cells. The different sensitivity of the tumor cell lines
to MMF might be caused by an unequal metabolic activity, coupled with variable IMPDH levels. Recent data have
shown that the level of expression of IMPDH mRNA and
protein differ among several cell lines [6], and that
IMPDH is selectively up-regulated in neoplastic and replicating cells [7]. Although this has not yet been proven,
MMF might be more effective in rapidly proliferating
tumor cells than in tumors with a lower replicating
activity. In this context, the average doubling times of HT29 and DU-145 cultures during their exponential growth
phase were calculated to be 13–16 h or 22 h, respectively
[8-10], whereas the mean population doubling times of
renal or pancreatic carcinoma cell lines ranged between
24–104 h or 16–40 h, respectively [11-14].
It should also be considered that MMF might switch on/
off different intracellular signaling cascades in colon versus prostate tumor cells. Indeed, adhesion blockade of
HT-29 cells was accompanied by reduced alpha3beta1
and alpha6beta1 surface expression, while adhesion
blockade of DU-145 cells was accompanied by a dosedependent up-regulation of integrins alpha1beta1,
alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha5beta1 on the cell
membrane.
Studies on integrin receptors presented evidence that
beta1 integrin expression by colon carcinoma cells
qualifies these cells to successfully adhere to secondary
sites. Recent experiments have demonstrated that colon
cancer cells adhere to endothelial cells via beta1 integrins
and that addition of beta1 integrin blocking antibodies
reduces tumor cell adhesion [15,16]. Based on a murine
spleen injection-liver metastasis protocol, the
alpha3beta1 integrin subtype was identified to
predominantly facilitate the metastatic activity of colon
cancer cells [17].

A converse scenario might be created during prostate carcinogenesis, as levels of beta1 integrins have been found
reduced in neoplastic versus normal prostate tissue
[18,19], and in malignant versus non-tumorigenic prostate cell lines [20]. An in vitro cell culture model revealed
that TGF-beta stimulates the expression of alpha2beta1
integrin on prostate cancer cell lines and concomitantly
reduces tumor cell adhesion to human bone marrow
endothelium [21]. Down-regulation in the expression of
the alpha3beta1 integrins may also allow prostate tumor
cells to become more invasive and lead to an increased
propensity for metastasis: When human alpha3beta1high
and alpha3beta1low expressing prostate carcinoma cells
were injected into immunocompromised SCID mice,
only those cells with a drastically reduced integrin level
were found to form tumors at the primary sites and to be
highly invasive and metastatic [22]. This is in context with
our data demonstrating beta1 integrin elevation on DU145 prostate tumor cells in the context with diminished
adhesion behaviour.
When discussing the relevance of integrins in tumor recurrence and malignancy, we should keep in mind that
integrin receptors serve as mechanistic binding as well as
differentiation triggering elements. Therefore, up-regulation of the same integrin type might either lead to
enhanced cell adhesion by coupling the receptor to its ligand, or to a reduced cell adhesion by activating integrin
driven differentiation signals. Based upon our in vitro
assay, we conclude that MMF blocks adhesion of colon
and prostate carcinoma cells by two different mechanisms: a) Loss of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 surface
expression directly contributes to the reduced adhesive
behaviour of HT-29 cells, b) Enhancement of integrin
beta1 subtypes might cause re-differentiation of DU-145
cells towards a low-adhesive phenotype. However, it still
remains to be determined if MMF indeed acts as a differentiation inducing drug in prostate tumor cells. Beside the
hypothesis that beta1 upregulation might activate differentiation inducing signals, selective inhibition of tumorpromoting pathways should also taken into
consideration.
Presumably, down-regulation of alpha3beta1 and
alpha6beta1 surface expression on HT-29 tumor cells
might be caused by inhibition of receptor glycosylation
and/or receptor de novo synthesis. The latter hypothesis
seems to be more likely because MMF's effects at the cell
surface were also observed at the mRNA level. This was
not the case with DU-145 cells where MMF evoked up-regulation of membranous beta1 integrins was not paralleled
by similar modifications of the beta1 integrin coding
mRNA. There is still no clear concept why MMF causes
integrin up-regulation in one tumor entity but down-regulation in another entity, both coupled with reduced
tumor cell adhesiveness. Presumably, HT-29 and DU-145
tumor cells might be equipped with different enzyme systems, the intracellular signaling cascade might be activated differentially in colon versus prostate tumor cells, or
sensitivity of specific pathways to MMF might differ
between both tumor types.
Speculatively, alterations of post-translational events
might change the receptor surface presentation in prostate
carcinoma cells. Elegant experiments by Liang and coworkers demonstrated that over-expression of alpha5beta1
or beta1 integrin induced the decrease of protein kinase B
(PKB) phosphorylation and subsequent accumulation of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 [23]. A yeast-based
two-hybrid system was employed which identified
IMPDH as specifically interacting with PKB [24]. Furthermore, MMF treatment significantly increased p21 proteins, which could be reversed by the simultaneous
addition of guanine or guanosine [25,26]. Hypothetically,
p21 may act as an MMF triggered upstream signal (via
PKB?), which contributes to enhanced beta1 integrin surface expression.
Conclusions
The present study indicates that MMF possesses antitumoral properties particularly to colon and prostate carcinoma cells. Alterations of the beta1 integrin profile are
responsible for blocking tumor cell adhesion to vascular
endothelium. MMF might also act on further adhesion
proteins which are relevant for tumor recurrence and dissemination. An in vitro study published recently refers to
the sLeX-selectin pathway targeted by MMF [27]. CD44
glycoproteins as well as receptors of the cadherin family
might also be modulated under MMF-based immunosuppressive regimen. From a clinical viewpoint, further studies must be undertaken which evaluate the tumor
recurrence rate and classify the tumor type in MMF versus
non-MMF treated transplant patients.
