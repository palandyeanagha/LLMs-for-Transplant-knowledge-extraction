In Europe, the dynamics of endemic hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) infection remain enigmatic. We studied the 
presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood 
donors. Using donations collected throughout the 
Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40,176 donations were 
tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5,239 donors 
were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and 
for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5,239 donations, 1,401 (27%) tested repeat-positive for HEV 
IgG, of which 49 (3.5%) also tested positive for antiHEV IgM. Four of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested 
positive for HEV RNA. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged 
from 13% among donors younger than 30 years to 
43% in donors older than 60 years. The finding of 
17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45,415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. For 16 of the 17 HEV 
RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch 
pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the 
Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of 
Europe.
Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, 
classified into four genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 
have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 
3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical 
features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic viruses. In Europe 
and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute 
disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, 
but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been 
suspected [1]. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread 
among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan [2,3]. 
Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to 
cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, 
such as patients who have received organ transplants 
[4,5], who may develop chronic hepatitis E [6,7]. Blood 
donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated 
by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA [8,9] 
and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among 
blood donors in the south west of France [10]. Cases of 
transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported 
[11-14]. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its 
implications for public health and the safety of blood 
are largely unknown. Which part of the population has 
signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the 
infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in 
a large number of recent blood donations, collected 
throughout the country.
Methods
Collection and selection of samples
To estimate the presence of HEV in the donor population, 417 plasma pools of 48 blood donations each (representing 20,016 donations, collected from November 
2011 through January 2012); and 42 plasma pools of 
480 donations each (representing 20,160 donations, 
collected in April and May 2012) were tested for presence of HEV RNA. All Dutch blood collection centres 
participated, thus all regions of the Netherlands were 
represented. The switch to pools of 480 was made 
after performing PCR on the 417 pools of 48 donations, 
as it appeared that the level of viraemia in recent HEV 
infection was sufficient to be detected in pools of 480. 
Plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA were deconstructed to identify and genotype individual HEV RNApositive donations.
In addition, plasma samples from 5,239 consenting 
blood donors were collected on two days in March 2011 
to determine HEV IgG seroprevalence, with subsequent 
testing for HEV IgM and HEV RNA in IgG-positive donations. All Dutch collection centres participated, thus all 
regions of the Netherlands were represented. Finally, 
for 391 donors testing positive for HEV IgG, archived 
samples of blood donations collected in 2009 were

retrieved for retrospective testing, to estimate the incidence of HEV infection in previous years.
Detection and genotyping of 
hepatitis E virus RNA
Amplification of a 74 bp fragment of HEV ORF3 was 
adapted from Pas et al. [7]. RNA was extracted 
from 0.4 mL of plasma using the QIAamp MinElute 
Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN) on a nucleic acid extractor (QIAcube, QIAGEN) and eluted in 50 μL according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol. For repository samples, 60 µl of plasma was diluted into 400 µl before 
extraction. MS2 phage was added prior to extraction 
as an internal control. Amplification used 20 μL of eluate in a 50 μL volume containing 12.5 μL of TaqMan 
Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 
0.2 μM HEV probe (FAM-ATTCTCAGCCCTTCGC-MGB, 
Applied Biosystems), and 0.6 μM of HEV forward 
primer (CGGTGGTTTCTGGGGTGA, Invitrogen) and 
0.9 μM HEV reverse primer (GCRAAGGGRTTGGTTGG, 
Invitrogen). PCR was performed using a real-time PCR 
system (LightCycler 480-II, Roche) and standard PCR 
conditions. Reactions were performed in duplicate, 
with and without MS2 detection using MS2-specific 
primers and a Hex/BHQ1 labelled Taqman probe [15]. 
The lower limit of detection (95% cut-off) of the assay 
is ca. 25 IU/mL HEV RNA. HEV viral loads were calculated retrospectively from the PCR Ct values, using 
a calibration curve based on the first World Health 
Organization (WHO) International Standard for HEV 
RNA [16], which later became available. HEV genotyping was performed by amplification and sequencing of 
a 326 bp fragment of the ORF2 region [17] using AMV RT 
and GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. If the HEV-RNA load in the 
index donation was too low, genotyping was performed 
using earlier or later samples of the donor. Sequence 
analysis was performed using DNAstar and Geneious 
software, using HEV reference sequences as described 
by Baylis et al. [18] and additional HEV sequences from 
GenBank. Genetic distances were calculated using the 
Tamura-Nei model, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method. The 16 
blood donor HEV sequences obtained in this study are

JX645333, JX678984 and KC223601. For comparison, 
HEV sequences from seven Dutch endemic hepatitis 
E patients were included, diagnosed in 2011 or 2012 
in our laboratory. No further patient information was 
available. The seven patient HEV sequences are available via GenBank accession codes JX645334–JX645340.
Serological testing
Samples were screened for IgG antibodies to HEV 
using an anti-HEV IgG enzyme immuno assay (EIA) 
(Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., 
Beijing, China) [5,10,19,20]. Positive samples were 
tested for presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies by 
an anti-HEV IgM EIA (Wantai). Positive samples were 
considered anti-HEV positive if found positive upon 
repeated testing. The assays were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. IgM-positive 
samples were tested for presence of HEV RNA and, if 
PCR-positive, were subsequently genotyped. Archived 
serial samples from HEV RNA-positive donors were 
tested to confirm seroconversion and to determine the 
duration of viraemia.
Statistical analysis and 
geographical information
The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. 
The Newcombe-Wilson method was applied to determine 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The age–seroprevalence curve was calculated using a second-degree 
polynomial fit. For incidence calculation, seroconversion was defined as conversion from seronegative to 
seropositive in subsequent donations, together with at 
least a threefold increase of the HEV IgG sample–to–
cut-off EIA value. The degree of urbanisation for postal 
code areas was provided by the central bureau for statistics (CBS), using a five-point scale ranging from 1 
(highly urbanised, ≥2,500 addresses/km2) to 5 (rural, 
<500 addresses/km2). 
Results
The screening of 459 plasma pools, containing 40,176 
blood donations, for presence of HEV RNA, resulted in 
the identification of 13 HEV viraemic donors (Donors 1 
to 13 in Table 1, red flags in Figure 1). If possible, the 
presence of HEV infection was confirmed by detection 
of HEV RNA in the original plasma bag. Seven donors 
were detected among the 20,016 donations in pools of 
48, six donors among the 20,160 donations in pools 
of 480. Nine of the 13 donors were in the early, seronegative phase of infection. For five of these seronegative donors a follow-up sample was available, and for 
three seropositive donors an earlier sample was available; all demonstrating seroconversion and confirming 
recent infection. An indication of the duration of viraemia was obtained as follows: In seven donors HEV was 
detectable in serial donations, 27 to 58 days apart (see 
‘first to last HEV RNA-positive donation’ in Table 1). In 
nine donors, an HEV-negative donation was available 
before and after the viraemic donation, 83 to 201 days 
apart (see ‘last to first HEV RNA-negative donation in 
Table 1).
Screening of 5,239 donors for the presence of HEV antibodies revealed 1,401 donors who were repeat-reactive 
for anti-HEV IgG, resulting in a seroprevalence of 26.7% 
(95% CI: 25.6–28.0). Some regional variation was 
observed (Table 2 and Figure 1): the seroprevalence 
in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands (30.5%) 
was higher than in the rest of the country (p=0.0004), 
while the seroprevalence in the north-western part was 
lower (23.6%, p=0.009). Anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence 
strongly increased with age: after the age of 30 years, 
the seroprevalence increased linearly with 1.05% per 
year (Figure 2; R2=0.98). The variation in seroprevalence in different parts of the Netherlands cannot be 
not explained by different age distributions of local 
donor populations. The overall seroprevalence in 
males was higher than in females (29.2 versus 23.1%), 
but this difference can be attributed to the higher average age of male donors (51.1 versus 45.5 years); no 
difference was observed when age-weighed seroprevalences were compared.

The anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence did not correlate with 
the level of urbanisation (Table 2). The lower seroprevalence in highly urban areas can be explained by the 
lower average age of urban donors. The HEV seroprevalence in the area with the highest density of pigs (surrounding the city of Eindhoven), was not different from 
the seroprevalence of the rest of the south-eastern 
part of the Netherlands (30.2% versus 30.6%). 
The incidence of HEV infection in recent years was estimated by measuring anti-HEV IgG in earlier, archived 
samples collected in 2009 from the 391 donors who 
tested positive for anti-HEV IgG in 2011. The total time 
span, covered by the serial samples, was 571 years. 
Seventeen donors seroconverted during this period, 
indicating an incidence of 1.1% per person-year (95% 
CI: 0.65–1.7). 
Forty-nine (3.5%) of the 1,401 anti-HEV IgG positive donors tested positive for IgM anti-HEV. Four of 
these IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA 
(Donors 14 to 17 in Table 1, and orange flags in Figure 1). 
Serial samples of all four donors showed IgM and IgG 
anti-HEV seroconversion, confirming recent infection.
HEV viral loads in the 17 viraemic donors ranged from 
near the detection limit (<25 IU/mL HEV RNA) to more 
than 100,000 IU/mL HEV RNA. In seven donors HEV 
viraemia occurred in up to five serial donations, with a 
maximum recorded viraemic period of 58 days (Donor 2 
in Table 1). In 16 of the 17 viraemic donors HEV genotyping succeeded, showing the presence of HEV genotype 
3. Phylogenetic analysis of the HEV sequences suggested clustering with each other, with Dutch endemic 
hepatitis E patients and with HEV sequences obtained 
from Dutch pigs, see Figure 3.
Discussion
The detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45,415 recent 
Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence 
of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological 
screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the 
Dutch adult population experienced HEV infection. This 
proportion compares with the 16% of 500 donors in the 
south-west of Britain [19], and the 53% of 512 donors 
in the south-west of France [10], who recently tested 
positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody 
assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there 
is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent 
study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6% 
in 7,072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, 
employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/
Genelabs) [21]. The Wantai assay used in the present 
study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of 
the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a 
higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCRproven cases by the Wantai assay [10,20]. Classical 
anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems 
unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors 
(Table 1), the striking age-related increase of HEV IgG 
seroprevalence (Figure 2), and the fact that already in 
2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch

pig farms [2], suggest that the high seroprevalence as 
detected by the Wantai assay may be correct. 
Unfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under 
the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related 
seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The 
age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a 
long-standing, stable situation, in which people are 
evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that 
scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of 
HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were 
a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult 
to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, 
the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort 
effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been 
described in England [22]. The HEV incidence found in 
this study of 1% per year, as well as the high number 
of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict 
transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV 
may have returned after a long period of absence.
HEV transmission by blood transfusion has been 
reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United 
Kingdom [11-14]. Our results suggest roughly one HEV 
viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may 
be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5,239 donors only detected antibodypositive donors in a later stage of infection (Donors 
14 to 17 in Table 1), while the screening for HEV RNA 
of 40,176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors 
in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV 
RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies (Donors 1 to 13). 
HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of 
organ transplants and patients with haematological 
malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women [23]. 
Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of 
HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations 
for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. 
Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence 
of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection 
in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral 
treatment using ribavirin [5,24].
The source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the 
Midi-Pyrénées region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was 
found [10], the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of 
pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands. Until 
recently, little was known of HEV transmission dynamics in European pig populations. Berto et al. describe 
the presence of HEV in 8 to 73% of stool samples collected from pig farms between 2007 and 2011 throughout Europe, and the presence of HEV in fattening pigs 
[25]. It is unclear whether pigs are the source of the 
current HEV infections. Intensive pig farming may have 
become the major amplifier of the virus, considering 
that millions of pigs are being reared in the Netherlands 
each year, of which each year again a large part probably acquires and sheds HEV. Subsequently, HEV may 
be spread via contaminated meat [26,27] or via faecally 
contaminated water used for irrigation [28]. Studies are 
needed to identify the transmission routes of HEV gt-3 
to humans, so that appropriate measures can be taken. 
It seems likely that at this moment other Western countries also experience extensive, silent HEV infection.
