Pure laparoscopic donor right hepatectomy (PLDRH) is not a standard procedure for living donor 
liver transplantation but is safe and reproducible in the hands of experienced surgeons. However, 
the perioperative outcomes of PLDRH have not been fully evaluated yet. We used propensity score 
matching to compare the perioperative complications and postoperative short-term outcomes of 
donors undergoing PLDRH and open donor right hepatectomy (ODRH). A total of 325 consecutive 
donors who underwent elective, adult-to-adult right hepatectomy were initially screened. After 
propensity score matching, all patients were divided into two groups: PLDRH (n=123) and ODRH 
(n=123) groups. Perioperative complications and postoperative outcomes were compared between 
the two groups. Postoperative pulmonary complications were signifcantly more common in the ODRH 
than in the PLDRH group (54.5 vs. 31.7%, P<0.001). The biliary complications (leak and stricture) were 
higher in PLDRH group than in the ODRH group (8% vs. 3%), but it failed to reach statistical signifcance 
(P=0.167). Overall, surgical complication rates were similar between the two groups (P=0.730). 
The opioid requirement during the frst 7 postoperative days was higher in the ODRH group (686 vs. 
568mg, P<0.001). The hospital stay and time to the frst meal were shorter in the PLDRH than in the 
ODRH group (P=0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). PLDRH reduced the incidence of postoperative 
pulmonary complications and aforded better short-term postoperative outcomes compared to ODRH. 
However, surgical complication rates were similar in both groups.
Laparoscopic liver surgery has become widely accepted, afording many benefts including fewer overall complications, less blood loss, lower pain scores, better donor quality-of-life during the early postoperative period, 
and a shorter hospital stay, compared to open surgery1–3
. As surgical techniques advanced over time, laparoscopic surgery for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) became possible2
. Afer the frst successful reports 
of laparoscopic lef lateral sectionectomy during adult-to-child LDLT in 20024
, many centers adopted the laparoscopic approach as the standard for living liver donors undergoing small graf resections5,6
. However, the use 
of laparoscopic procedures to perform larger graf resections (such as right hepatectomies) was initially limited 
by technical complexities and the steep learning curve associated with the procedures. However, a series of laparoscopic right hepatectomies performed by experienced surgeons at living donor centers showed that the results

were equivalent to those of open donor surgery7. Over time, the initial clinical acceptance of hand-assisted laparoscopic, donor right hepatectomy advanced to the adoption of pure laparoscopic donor right hepatectomy 
(PLDRH)1,8
. Several preliminary studies suggested that PLDRH was safe and reproducible in the hands of experienced surgeons7,9–11. However, the available data focus principally on the incidence and nature of surgery-related 
complications12; neither perioperative complications nor postoperative short-term outcomes of PLDRH have 
been fully evaluated. Terefore, we used retrospective propensity score matching in this study to compare perioperative complications and postoperative short-term outcomes between PLDRH and open donor right hepatectomy (ODRH) patients.
Methods
Patients and study design. Te Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this retrospective study (approval no. SMC 2018-07-068-001) and waived the requirement for written informed consent. 
All procedures in this study were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
All data were collected from digitalized patient charts and the clinical data warehouse of Samsung Medical 
Center. Our institute commenced an LDLT program in 1996 and PLDRH was initiated in May 2013. Between May 
2013 and April 2018, a total of 361 consecutive patients who underwent donor right hepatectomy or extended 
right hepatectomy during adult-to-adult LDLT were initially screened. Emergency cases (n=29) and cases in 
which the donor selection criteria were unusual (n=7) were excluded. Te remaining 325 patients were divided 
into two groups by surgery type: ODRH (n=187) and PLDRH (n=138) groups. To overcome bias caused by differences in covariate distributions, we used one-to-one propensity score matching to ensure that the two groups 
were comparable. Finally, 123 patients who underwent ODRH and 123 who underwent PLDRH were enrolled. 
An overview of the study design is shown in Fig. 1.
Donor selection. Our institutional selection criteria for ODRH when performing adult-to-adult LDLT are 
as follows: (1) Donor less than 65 years of age; (2) less than 30% macrosteatosis evident on frozen biopsy; and 
(3) expected remnant liver volume greater than 30%. Early on, PLDRH was performed only when the donor was 
younger than 60, and only when the donor elected to do so. In the frst seven consecutive patients, only donors 
with normal vascular or biliary structures underwent PLDRH. Surgical techniques, benefts, and complications 
of both open and laparoscopic procedures were thoroughly explained to the donors before they made the choice. 
Afer these patients exhibited no major complications, we decided to expand the selection criteria. Currently, our 
donor selection criteria for ODRH and PLDRH do not difer, and PLDRH is now recommended to donors as the 
primary surgical technique. Terefore, we excluded the initial seven patients from analysis.
Surgical technique. ODRH. Laparotomy was performed via incisions of both subcostal regions, combined 
with cephalic extensions. Afer dissecting ligaments around the liver, the right hepatic artery and portal vein 
were briefy clamped to defne a demarcation line prior to parenchymal sectioning. An ultrasound device was 
used to detect the geographical relationship between the middle hepatic vein and the liver parenchyma. During 
parenchymal dissection, the middle hepatic veins of segments V and VIII were gently divided and ligated, while 
leaving sufcient length for reconstruction. Afer the hepatic vein trunk was encountered, parenchymal dissection was completed posteriorly. Te hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein were divided, and the graf liver

was delivered to a bench for perfusion. Te remnant stumps of the hepatic and bile ducts were ligated or closed 
without narrowing.
PLDRH. A narrative overview on our PLDRH surgical technique was previously published by one of our surgeons13. Briefy, fve trocar ports were placed as follows: one 12-mm port receiving a 30° optic device at the 
umbilicus; one 12-mm operative trocar each at the right midaxillary line and the midline; and two 5-mm trocars 
for instrumental assistance, one at the lef midclavicular area and one in the subxiphoid region. Ultrasound observation followed by parenchymal sectioning was performed as described for ODRH. Parenchymal sectioning proceeded with the aid of an ultrasonic dissector (SonicisionTM; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a cavitron 
ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA® Excel; Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA). Te major hepatic veins 
were saved for reconstruction. Afer completion of parenchymal dissection, the remnant bile duct stump was 
sutured. A Pfannenstiel incision of length 12–14cm was created in the suprapubic area and the graf was retrieved 
in a plastic bag prior to perfusion.
Anesthesia and monitoring. Afer initiation of standard anesthesia monitoring including electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurement, and monitoring of the bispectral index 
(BIS), 400 µg morphine was administered intrathecally through the level 4–5 lumbar intervertebral space14. 
Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg kg−1
 sodium thiopental and 0.1 mg kg−1 vecuronium followed by tracheal 
intubation. Tereafer, the end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), oroesophageal temperature, and arterial blood 
pressure were monitored (the latter invasively, through a radial artery catheter). Dynamic indices that could 
be calculated using arterial blood pressure data (e.g., pulse pressure variation [PPV]) were evaluated throughout the operation. Anesthesia was maintained with inhaled isofurane, with the BIS held between 40 and 60. 
Intravenous (IV) remifentanil was continuously infused (0.01–0.1 µg kg−1
 min−1) to control blood pressure and 
heart rate. Hypotension (mean blood pressure decrease >20% from baseline) was treated with 5mg ephedrine, 
and bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats min−1
) was treated with 0.5 mg atropine. Neuromuscular blockade was 
monitored with the aid of a nerve stimulator attached to the adductor pollicis muscle. Te thumb response to 
train-of-four (TOF) counts of 0 or 1 was monitored via continuous infusion of 0.8–1.0µgkg−1
 min−1 vecuronium. 
Te mechanical ventilator was set to the volume-controlled ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 6–8mLkg−1
and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cm H2O, using a mixture of medical air and oxygen at a 
fresh gas fow rate of 2 L min−1
 (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.5). Te ventilation frequency was adjusted to 
maintain the ETCO2 at 4.0–5.7 kPa. If the peak pressure exceeded 30 cm H2O, we changed the ventilator mode 
to pressure-controlled ventilation15. During PLDRH, the intraperitoneal pressure was adjusted to 12±2mmHg 
afer infation of the abdominal space, and the 30° reverse Trendelenburg position was established. Immediately 
afer graf removal and stabilization of hemostasis, the CO2 gas supply was stopped and the patient was returned 
to the supine position.
A balanced crystalloid solution (Plasma solution A; CJ Healthcare, Seoul, Korea) was used as the intraoperative maintenance fuid. Te fuid level was controlled to maintain normovolemia. A colloid solution comprising 6% (w/v) Volulyte (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) was infused if the attending anesthesiologist 
considered it necessary. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed every 2 h during the operation. Our institute 
guideline states that red blood cells should be transfused if hemoglobin levels fall below 8 g dL−1
. However, no 
patient required an intraoperative transfusion. Te body temperature was maintained at 36.5 °C by providing a 
warming blanket.
Afer completion of surgery, oropharyngeal suctioning was gently performed and 0.25mgkg−1
 pyridostigmine 
with 0.01mgkg−1
 glycopyrrolate were administered to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. Afer confrming that 
the TOF ratio was >0.9, respiration was adequate, and that the eyes opened in response to a verbal stimulus, the 
tracheal tube was removed.
Pain control and discharge. For pain control, 400 µg of intrathecal morphine was administered prior to 
general anesthesia, because our prior study revealed that this aforded a superior analgesic efect14. Pethidine 
(25 mg via IV) was given prior to the end of surgery. Afer surgery, IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was 
initiated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Te PCA solution comprised 0.9% (w/v) normal saline with 
15 µgmL−1
 fentanyl, and was delivered at a rate of 1mLh−1 with a 1-mL bolus dose and a 15-min lockout time. 
Patients with numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores of >3 despite the use of IV PCA received rescue IV analgesics. PACU anesthesiologists prescribed the type and dose of such analgesics. Afer PACU discharge, either 
or both oral and IV analgesics were prescribed, depending on the NPRS score, by the surgeon. To allow us to 
compare the opioid requirements of the two groups, all opioids prescribed during the frst 7 postoperative days 
were converted to oral morphine equivalent doses (OMEDs). Te donor was discharged at the discretion of the 
surgeon if conditions such as the oral feeding, normalization of laboratory results, removal of all drains, and postoperative pain control with oral analgesics were met.
Outcomes. Our primary aim was to compare the perioperative complications and postoperative short-term 
outcomes of the two groups. Perioperative complications included intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia, 
postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) that require treatment with metoclopramide, pruritus that require 
treatment with pheniramine, postoperative pulmonary complications, and surgical complications. All patients 
underwent chest x-rays afer surgery and complications were evaluated using European Perioperative Clinical 
Outcome definitions16. All postoperative complications were evaluated using the modified Clavien-Dindo 
classification17 and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)18. Short-term postoperative outcomes 
were investigated during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were evaluated by monitoring intraoperative

hemodynamic and respiration levels and surgical complications, and examining laboratory data obtained preand post-operatively.
Statistical analyses. Continuous variables are presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs) or as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate, and categorical variables are presented as percentages. Te 
normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and parameters were compared 
between groups using the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Te chi-squared or Fisher’s 
exact test was employed to compare categorical variables.
To deal with bias attributable to the distinct distributions of covariates among patients in the two groups, 
we performed propensity score matching (one-to-one) using the nearest-neighbor method, with no replacement. Te following covariates were analyzed: height, weight, age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists 
(ASA) physical status, graf type (right vs. extended right), surgeon, current smoker status, and any history of 
abdominal operation. Te matching algorithm was based on logistic regression and tested by drawing histograms 
of the propensity scores and the standardized diferences, and a dot plot of the standardized mean diferences 
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Matching was considered appropriate when the diference in the logit of the propensity 
score between the nearest neighbors was within one caliper-width (0.1). All statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS sofware (version 22; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Te level of statistical signifcance (α) 
was set to 0.05.
Results
We initially included 325 donors, 187 that underwent ODRH and 138 that underwent PLDRH. Afer propensity score matching, 123 donors remained in each group. Te demographic and preoperative characteristics of 
patients before and afer propensity score matching are summarized in Table 1. Open conversion was triggered 
by portal vein stenosis in two patients, portal vein injury in one, lef bile duct injury in one, and inferior vena cava 
tearing in one.
Intraoperative outcomes. Intraoperative outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Total operation time, 
anesthetic time, and time to graf procurement did not difer signifcantly between the two groups (P=0.649, 
P=0.165, and P=0.206, respectively). Te Pringle maneuver was performed on 92 of 123 (74.8%) patients in the 
ODRH group and 52 of 123 (42.3%) in the PLDRH group (diference between groups, 32.5%; 95% confdence 
interval [CI], 19.8–43.8%). Tis diference was statistically signifcant (P<0.001). Te estimated blood loss (EBL) 
was signifcantly more in the ORDH (P=0.036), but amounts of intraoperative colloids infused were signifcantly 
more in the PLDRH (P=0.017). No patient required an intraoperative transfusion in the both groups.
Te intraoperative respiratory and hemodynamic data are shown in Fig. 2. Te median driving pressure (DP; 
the plateau pressure minus the PEEP) was 11 (10–13) cm H2O in the ODRH group and 16 (15–17) cm H2O in the

PLDRH group. Te median diference of 5 cm H2O had a 95% CI of 4–5 cm H2O and was signifcant (P<0.001). 
Mean lung compliance (tidal volume/DP) values for the ODRH and PLDRH groups were 43 ± 9 and 30 ±

, respectively. Te mean diference of 14mLcm H2O−1 had a 95% CI of 12–16mLcm H2O−1 and 
was signifcant (P<0.001). Two donors in the PLDRH group required pressure-controlled ventilation because 
they exhibited peak inspiratory pressure of more than 30cm H2O. Te median maximum PPVs of the ODRH and 
PLDRH groups were 13 (10–16)% and 22 (17–26)%, respectively. Te median diference of 8% had a 95% CI of 
7–10% and was signifcant (P<0.001).
Perioperative complications. All perioperative complications observed are summarized in Table 3. Te 
frequencies of intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia, and postoperative PONV and pruritus, did not difer 
signifcantly between the two groups (P=0.242, P=0.151, P=0.797, and P=0.166, respectively). Postoperative 
pulmonary complications were signifcantly more common (P<0.001) in the ODRH (54.5%) than in the PLDRH 
(31.7%) group (diference between groups, 22.8%; 95% CI, 9.8–34.7%). Specifcally, atelectasis was signifcantly 
more prevalent (P=0.009) in the ODRH (18.7%) than in the PLDRH (7.3%) group (diference between groups, 
11.3%; 95% CI, 2.4–20.4%).
Surgical complications did not difer signifcantly between the two groups (diference between groups, 1.6%; 
95% CI, −8.3–11.5%; P=0.730). Biliary complications (leak and stricture) was 4 of 123(3.3%) in the ODRH 
group and 10 of 123(8.1%) in the PLDRH group (P=0.167). One ODRH patient underwent re-operation to treat 
diaphragmatic hernia. Four PLDRH patients underwent re-operations, one to treat hepatic artery bleeding, two 
to treat bile duct leakage, and one to treat portal vein thrombosis.
Postoperative short-term outcomes. The short-term postoperative outcomes are summarized in 
Table 4. Mean OMEDs over the frst 7 postoperative days for the ODRH and PLDRH groups were 686 ± 253 
and 568 ± 126 mg, respectively. Te mean diference of 116 mg had a 95% CI of 66–167 mg and was signifcant 
(P<0.001), but NPRS in the PACU score did not difer signifcantly between the two groups (P=0.573). Patients 
in the ODRH group had a signifcantly longer median postoperative hospital stay (10 [8–12] days; P=0.003), 
time to the frst meal afer surgery (3 [2,3] days; P<0.001), and time to JP removal afer surgery (6 [5–8] days; 
P=0.005), compared to patients in the PLDRH group (9 [8–11] days, 1 [1,2] day, and 6 [4–8] days, respectively). 
Te respective median diference was 1 day for each comparison, and the respective 95% CIs were 0–2, 1–2, and 
0–1 days. However, re-admission rates did not difer between the two groups (P=0.634).

Pre- and post-operative laboratory data are shown in Fig. 3. During postoperative days 1, 3, and 5, serum 
aspartate aminotransferase (Day 1, P<0.001; Day 3, P<0.001; Day 5, P<0.001) and alanine aminotransferase 
(Day 1, P=0.003; Day 3, P<0.001; Day 5, P=0.002) levels were lower in PLDRH patients. PLDRH patients 
exhibited lower hemoglobin levels on immediate postoperative period, postoperative days 1, and 3 (P=0.033, 
P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively).
Discussion
In this retrospective study using propensity score matching, we compared the perioperative complications and 
postoperative short-term outcomes of PLDRH and ODRH patients. Living donors undergoing PLDRH exhibited 
better postoperative outcomes, including fewer postoperative pulmonary complications, less opioid consumption until postoperative day 7, and a shorter hospital stay. However, surgical complications as assessed using the 
Clavien-Dindo system did not difer signifcantly between the two groups.
Laparoscopic procedures employed for graf resections (such as right hepatectomy) continue to be highly 
demanding technically. Tus, their use remains both limited and controversial because of concerns about donor 
safety. Although hand-assisted, laparoscopic, right lobe donor hepatectomy through a subxyphoid vertical incision was introduced in 200619, PLDRH has only recently been attempted in a few highly specialized centers20. 
Preliminary studies of these attempts revealed that the postoperative short-term outcomes were comparable to 
those of the open approach7,9–11. In particular, Kim et al. demonstrated the feasibility of pure laparoscopic procedures in three donors undergoing right hepatectomies21. Pure laparoscopic procedures has several advantages 
compared to conventional open surgery, including less wound morbidity and faster recovery21. More recently, 
Kwon et al. reported that, afer careful donor selection, and using standardized surgical methods, pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy for adult LDLT was safe and beneftted the donors22. Similarly, we found here (in the 
largest such study to date) that PLDRH donors had lower opioid requirements until postoperative day 7 than 
the ODRH donors. In addition, total hospital stay, time to frst meal, and time to JP removal were shorter in the 
PLDRH than in the ODRH group.

Frequencies of perioperative complications including PONV and pruritus were similar between the two 
groups. However, the incidence of overall postoperative pulmonary complications was lower in donors undergoing PLRDH. Pulmonary complications are common afer LDLT, particularly afer right hepatectomy23. We 
recorded postoperative pulmonary complications in 106 patients (44%). During laparoscopic abdominal surgery, 
the increased abdominal pressure reduces the functional residual capacity and oxygenation extent more than 
during open surgery24. However, we found that the oxygenation and ventilation status of PLDRH and ODRH 
patients were similar. Also, despite the unfavorable intraoperative oxygenation and ventilation status of PLDRH 
patients, the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was only 60% of that of the ODRH group. 
Several explanations are possible. First, the reverse Trendelenburg position may ofset the decrease in functional 
residual capacity that develops secondary to the pneumoperitoneum. Second, an intraoperative recruitment 
maneuver followed by PEEP adjustment efectively improves respiratory mechanics and oxygenation during laparoscopic surgery25,26. We performed recruitment maneuvers intermittently but routinely adjusted the PEEP continuously during laparoscopic surgery. Tird, Jeong et al. found that open abdominal surgery was associated with 
more pulmonary complications than laparoscopic abdominal surgery27. It was suggested that this refected less 
direct damage to the diaphragm and respiratory muscles during surgery, and less postoperative pain facilitating

deep breathing and active coughing during recovery. Indeed, we found that the opioid consumption during the 
frst 7 postoperative days was signifcantly lower in the PLDRH group, supporting the arguments made above. 
Terefore, healthy donor lung status, the use of intraoperative recruitment maneuvers, and better postoperative 
rehabilitation of the PLDRH group may have reduced postoperative pulmonary complications despite the poorer

(compared to the ODRH group) intraoperative respiratory mechanics. However, only less than 10% of the pulmonary complications needed treatment.
As living liver donors are usually young and healthy, their cosmetic outcomes are important. DuBay et al. 
reported that, in younger donors, these outcomes and the perceived body image afer adult, right lobe, living 
liver donation were signifcantly lower than those afer renal donation; liver donors reported signifcantly poorer 
health-related quality-of-life28. PLDRH is most helpful in this context, because the small suprapubic incision 
created for graf extraction and the resultant scar can be covered by underwear or pants; this is not the case afer 
open, hand-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy.
Te major postoperative complication (grade IIIb or higher) that required re-operation were more common 
in the PLDRH than in the ODRH group, but diferences were not statistically signifcant. In particular, the incidence of postoperative biliary complications was two times higher in the PLDRH than in the ODRH group. 
Given the complexity and novelty of the former procedure, a higher incidence of major complications may seem 
inevitable. However, an experienced laparoscopic surgeon can reduce the incidence of such complications. Lee 
et al. reported a subgroup analysis of donors who underwent PLDRH; the major complication rate was 4.7% in 
the initial group but 0% in the most recent group10. Suh et al. also reported that modern technical developments 
such as three-dimensional laparoscopes and real-time, indocyanine green, near-infrared fuorescence cameras 
brought about substantial benefts7
. Tese developments greatly aid laparoscopic surgeons. PLDRH can substitute 
for open surgery if it is performed by an experienced team using the best available surgical devices.
Our study had certain limitations. First, because this was a single-center retrospective work on a novel laparoscopic technique, there may have been selection bias. When we initially commenced PLDRH, the selection criteria difered between the two groups. Terefore, we excluded the initial seven cases. Also, we used propensity score 
matching to minimize the bias in our retrospective study; thus, facilitating more accurate between-group comparisons. Second, not all intraoperative events and complications may have been identifed because we referred 
only to electronic medical records and assessed no long-term outcomes other than re-admission rate. Tird, we 
compared donor outcomes only by surgery type. Tus, further studies on recipient graf outcomes by donor surgical technique are required.
In conclusion, the use of PLDRH instead of ODRH when performing adult-to-adult LDLT led to improved 
early postoperative outcomes and reduced postoperative pulmonary complications. Te incidence of surgical 
complications was similar in both groups. Terefore, PLDRH is a viable alternative to ODRH when performed 
by experienced surgeons.
