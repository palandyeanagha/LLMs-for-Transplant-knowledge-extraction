Abstract
Background: Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) is present in up to 30% of cystic fibrosis patients and can result in
progressive liver failure. Diagnosis of CFLD is challenging. Non-invasive methods for staging of liver fibrosis display an
interesting diagnostic approach for CFLD detection.
Aim: We evaluated transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI), and fibrosis indices for CFLD
detection.
Methods: TE and ARFI were performed in 55 adult CF patients. In addition, AST/Platelets-Ratio-Index (APRI), and Forns’ score
were calculated. Healthy probands and patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis served as controls.
Results: Fourteen CF patients met CFLD criteria, six had liver cirrhosis. Elastography acquisition was successful in .89% of
cases. Non-cirrhotic CFLD individuals showed elastography values similar to CF patients without liver involvement. Cases
with liver cirrhosis differed significantly from other CFLD patients (ARFI: 1.49 vs. 1.13 m/s; p = 0.031; TE: 7.95 vs. 4.16 kPa;
p = 0.020) and had significantly lower results than individuals with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ARFI: 1.49 vs. 2.99 m/s; p = 0.002).
APRI showed the best diagnostic performance for CFLD detection (AUROC 0.815; sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 70.7%).
Conclusions: ARFI, TE, and laboratory based fibrosis indices correlate with each other and reliably detect CFLD related liver
cirrhosis in adult CF patients. CF specific cut-off values for cirrhosis in adults are lower than in alcoholic cirrhosis.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in
populations of European descent. Cystic fibrosis-related liver
disease (CFLD) is caused by biliary hyperviscosity which results in
bile duct obstruction and is present in up to one third of CF
patients. Five to 10% of patients develop liver cirrhosis and may
require liver transplantation [1]. Diagnosis of CFLD is challenging
because its clinical presentation ranges from simple steatosis to
multi-lobular biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension [2,3]. Noninvasive scoring systems based on liver sonomorphology [4,5] and
biochemical parameters [6,7] have been developed. However, in
many studies these diagnostic criteria were modified resulting in
heterogeneous data of CFLD prevalence [1]. The focal pattern of
liver involvement results in disaccordance between clinical findings
and histological staging and a high proportion of sampling errors
[8]. Therefore, although liver biopsy may help to identify patients
at risk for development of clinically significant liver disease [9] it is
not a standard procedure in CF [1].
In the last decade, ultrasound-based elastography methods for
non-invasive assessment of chronic liver diseases have been
developed [10,11]. First results of transient elastography (FibroscanH, TE) in cystic fibrosis revealed an elevated liver stiffness in
patients with CFLD classified according to pathologic ultrasound
criteria [12] and biochemical or clinical definitions [13]. In a case
series, TE could reliably identify children with CFLD and portal
hypertension [14]. First data with the recently developed acoustic
radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) technique revealed a high
accuracy for the detection of liver cirrhosis in pediatric CF patients
with portal hypertension [15].

However, liver elastography has not been systematically
evaluated in adult patients, and a direct comparison of TE and
ARFI is missing so far. Thus, the aim of the present study was to
evaluate both methods simultaneously in a cohort of adult CF
patients.
Materials and Methods
Ethical statement
The study was performed in strict accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the
Leipzig University ethics committee (registration number 091-10-
19042010). All study participants provided written informed
consent.
Patients and controls
Adult CF patients were prospectively investigated at presentation to the pulmonary outpatient clinic for clinical routine
examinations. Patients with pregnancy, age ,18 years, and liver
transplantation were not included. Patients underwent conventional upper abdomen ultrasound evaluation, elastography and
blood tests (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AP), bilirubin, gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), blood count, INR, albumin, creatinine, and cholesterol) at the same day. Fasting for at least three
hours was required prior to examination, however exceptions were
permitted when clinically required.
Previous ultrasound reports, recent pulmonary function tests
(time span ,6 months), and results of previous routine blood tests
were collected from clinical records.
Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease was defined if at least 2 of the
following conditions were present on at least 2 consecutive
examinations spanning a 1-year period [6,7]: (1) Ultrasound
confirmed hepatomegaly; (2) elevated serum liver enzyme levels of
ALT, AST, AP, or GGT; (3) ultrasound abnormalities other than
hepatomegaly (i.e., increased, heterogeneous echogenicity, nodularity, irregular margins, splenomegaly). An ultrasonographic
pattern of simple liver steatosis did not represent a diagnostic
criterion. In case of distinct ultrasonographic signs of liver cirrhosis
(i.e. coarse nodularity, presence of portal hypertension and
rarefication of peripheral portal veins) and clinical signs (e.g.
esophageal varices, splenomegaly) of liver cirrhosis CFLD patients
were classified as cirrhotics.
ARFI results were compared with a control group of 50 healthy
volunteers which has already been described in detail before [16].
Ten patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis served as positive
controls.
Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography
Liver stiffness was measured by ARFI technology (Acuson
S2000; Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, California,
USA; Software Version 350.1.050.36) using a convex probe (4C1,
Siemens Healthcare).
Patients were examined in a supine position with the right arm
elevated above the head in a resting respiratory position if
tolerable (short breath-hold without deep inspiration). The
measurement depth from the transducer surface was between 20
and 55 mm. The examiner aimed for a measuring angle close to
0u (region of interest position in the center of the transducer
surface).
Measurements were performed at two different sites in an area
of homogenous tissue: i) right liver lobe through the intercostal
space and ii) left liver lobe in the epigastric region in the median
line. Measurements were performed by experienced operators
(TK, VK, MN, MT, JW).
10 valid measurements at each site were required. The ARFI
success rate was calculated as the ratio between the valid and the
total number of measurements. The median value of each
measuring site was used for further analysis. In case of a success
rate below 60% the result was regarded as invalid and excluded
from further analysis [16,17].
Transient elastography (TE)
For transient elastography (TE; FibroscanH, Echosens, Paris,
France; Software Version 1.40) all subjects were examined in a
supine position immediately after ARFI measurement. TE was
performed in a right intercostal space in resting respiratory
position. 10 valid measurements were taken according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation (M probe). Measurements were
performed by experienced operators (TK, VK, MN, MT). Patients
with an interquartile range (IQR).median value/3 or a success
rate below 60% were considered as invalid and excluded from
further analysis.
Non-invasive fibrosis indices
In addition to ultrasound examination, liver fibrosis was
investigated by the two non-invasive fibrosis indices AST/
Platelets-Ratio-Index (APRI) and Forns’ score [18,19]. Forns’
score was calculated according to the formula [19]:
score~7:811{3:131|ln platelet count 109
l  z
0:781|In GGT UI ð Þ =l z3:467|
ln age years ð Þ{0:014|cholesterol mg ð Þ =dl
Statistical Analysis
Ordinal and nominal data were collected in a MicrosoftH Excel
file. Statistical analyses were conducted by using MedCalcH 11.4
(MedCalc Software, Belgium) and PASS 11.0.2 (NCSS, UT;
USA). Clinical and laboratory data were expressed as median 6
range and mean 6 standard deviation (SD) where appropriate.
Elastography results are presented as boxplots.
Fisher’s exact test and chi-square test were used to test for
association of variables. Nonparametric tests were chosen to compare
median values of two independent samples (Mann-Whitney U test) or
groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). Correlations between variables were
examined using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Diagnostic
performance of elastography methods and serologic fibrosis indices
were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The
probabilities of a true-positive (sensitivity) and a true-negative
(specificity) assessment with selected cut-off values were determined,
and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve
(AUROC) was calculated [20]. All tests were two-sided. A pvalue,0.05 indicated a significant difference or correlation.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the total study cohort
55 adult CF patients were prospectively included in the study
from April to December 2010 (table 1). Fourteen of 55 patients
(25.5%) met the criteria for CFLD. There were no significant
differences between CFLD patients and those without liver
involvement concerning age, body mass index, duration of CF,
age of initial CF diagnosis, and results of pulmonary function tests.

Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was more frequent
in the CFLD group (93% vs. 54%, p = 0.010). Only one patient of
the CFLD group (7%), but seven cases without CFLD (17%) had
undergone lung transplantation (p = 0.664).
In the ARFI control group, healthy subjects were significantly
younger than the CF individuals (p = 0.012). However, the age
difference was moderate (12% of median CF patient age) and
there was no correlation between age and liver stiffness.
The group of patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was
significantly older (p = 0.002) and had a higher body mass index
than CF-cases with cirrhosis (p = 0.025). None of the individuals
presented with either acute hepatitis (aminotransferase levels .26
upper limit of normal) or ascites.
Baseline characteristics of CFLD-patients
Six of the CFLD patients had distinct clinical and sonographical
signs of advanced liver disease, three of them showed collateral
circulation of the portal vein. These six cases were classified as
CFLD cirrhosis (table 1).
CF patients with cirrhosis showed higher values of alkaline
phosphatase (p = 0.028), bilirubin (p = 0.039) and a significantly
lower platelet count than CFLD cases without cirrhosis (135 vs.
2696109
/l, p = 0.010). There were no significant differences
concerning age, body mass index, time since and age at CF
diagnosis, and pulmonary function. The distribution of DF508
CFTR-genotype, treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, and the
presence of diabetes mellitus did not vary significantly.
Practicability of ARFI, transient elastography, and fibrosis
indices
ARFI-acquisition was completely successful in 53 cases (96%).
In two cases without CFLD the success rate was ,60% for one
liver lobe.

Liver Stiffness Measurement in CFLD
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e42139

TE measurements were invalid in six cases without CFLD (one
patient: success rate ,60%; five patients: IQR exceeding the third
of the median value) resulting in a rate of valid measurements of
89. Rates of valid results between ARFI and TE were not
significantly different (p = 0.271).
APRI score and Forns index could be calculated in all CF
patients.
Results of ARFI, transient elastography, and fibrosis
indices
Results of elastography measurements and serologic fibrosis
indices are shown in table 2. Individuals with CFLD had ARFI
and TE values similar to CF patients without liver involvement in
both liver lobes. ARFI results did not differ between both
subgroups and healthy controls (figures 1 and 2). Direct
comparison of ARFI results without Bonferroni correction for
the negative control group revealed a slight difference of shearwave velocities in the right liver lobe between the CFLD patients
and the group without CFLD (1.2860.31 vs. 1.1260.15 m/s;
p = 0.044; Mann-Whitney U test).
Both ARFI and TE did not reveal a significant difference
between CF patients without liver involvement and non-cirrhotic
CFLD cases (n = 8): 1.1260.15 vs. 1.1360.15 m/s (right liver lobe
ARFI, p = 0.83) and 4.061.1 vs. 4.261.3 kPa (TE, p = 0.94),
respectively (table 2). However, CFLD cases with liver cirrhosis
differed significantly from CFLD patients without cirrhosis in right
liver lobe ARFI (1.4960.36 vs. 1.1360.15 m/s; p = 0.031) and TE
(7.9565.88 vs. 4.1661.28 kPa; p = 0.020). Patients with alcoholic
liver cirrhosis had significantly increased values of shear-wave
velocity in both right and left liver lobe compared to CF patients
with cirrhosis (2.9960.77 vs. 1.4960.36 m/s and 3.0560.54 vs.
1.4860.20 m/s; p = 0.002, respectively).
TE results were highly correlated with median ARFI values of
the right liver lobe in all patients (rho = 0.762; p,0.001). ARFI
values of the left liver lobe showed good correlation with right liver
lobe ARFI (rho = 0.311; p,0.001) and with TE (rho = 0.333;
p,0.021). All elastography methods displayed a significant
correlation with APRI and Forns indices (rho.0.4; p,0.01).
The diagnostic performance for CFLD and cirrhosis detection
was comparable between elastography methods and the serological fibrosis indices (table 3). Sensitivity of ARFI and TE for CFLD
detection was low (50.0% and 42.9%, respectively). However,
specificity was 92.5% and 97.1%. Among all methods, the APRI
score showed the highest area under the receiving operator
characteristics curve values for CFLD detection with 85.7%
sensitivity and 70.7% specificity. In CFLD subgroups, diagnostic
accuracy of ARFI (right liver lobe), TE, APRI and Forns index for
detection of cirrhosis was almost equal (p,0.03, respectively)
(table 3).
Discussion
This is the first prospective study evaluating TE and ARFI
simultaneously for the detection of CFLD in a cohort of adult CF
patients presenting with baseline characteristics comparable to
previously reported studies [1,7].
ARFI and TE could be applied with a success rate.90% and
correlated highly between each other. However, TE had a higher
rate of invalid measurements than ARFI in patients without CFLD
(15% vs. 2%) which is in line with previously reported TE failure
rates [12]. This phenomenon may be partially explained by CF
specific conditions like hypertrophic intercostal muscles or by
difficulties to tolerate necessary standardized examination procedures (i.e. supine position, short respiratory holds) during the
examination in case of CF-related respiratory impairment [16].
Both TE and ARFI could not significantly discriminate between
non-cirrhotic CFLD patients and CF cases without liver disease
although a gradual increase would have been expected. This
observation should be interpreted very cautiously due to the
limited case number in the non-cirrhotic CFLD subgroup.
However, TE and ARFI (right liver lobe) distinguished between
liver cirrhosis and earlier stages of liver disease in CFLD patients.
Previous studies suggested a potential diagnostic benefit of left
liver lobe ARFI in healthy controls which seems to diminish in
advanced liver disease [16,21]. However, in our CF cohort left
liver lobe ARFI failed to discriminate between CFLD and non
CFLD patients and was not able to detect liver cirrhosis in CF
patients. Thus, it remains unclear whether left liver lobe ARFI
provides an additional diagnostic benefit.
Elastography values in CF patients with liver cirrhosis were
significantly lower than in alcoholic cirrhosis and differed from
reported cut-off values for liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B and
C [11,16,22]. Interestingly, in relation to healthy individuals shearwave velocity in cirrhotic CF patients were only marginally
increased (1.4960.36 vs. 1.1560.17 m/s; p = 0.007). However,
even this subtile difference of liver stiffness seems to be typical for
adult CF patients and allows reliable application of ARFI and TE.
It strengthens the assumption that elastography values depend on
the etiology of liver disease [23].
There is a set of possible explanations for our findings:
(i) Up to two thirds of pediatric and adolescent CF patients
show an ultrasound pattern of fatty liver disease [3,24,25]
while the incidence is lower in adult CF patients [26]. In
our adult cohort, 12/55 (22%) individuals displayed signs
of hepatic steatosis at ultrasound evaluation. A direct
relation of steatosis and CFLD is questionable, and
extrahepatic CF manifestations (i.e. malnutrition, essential
fatty acid deficiency, insulin resistance) have been discussed
as potential causes as well [3]. Fatty liver disease modulates
liver stiffness and can impair reliability of elastography for
the detection of fibrosis. Patients with fatty liver disease and
advanced fibrosis may not be detected by TE because of a
higher hepatic fat content [27]. 3/6 cases classified as CFrelated cirrhosis displayed an increased echogenicity of
liver parenchyma (steatosis grad I) in our investigations.
Thus, the marginally elevated elastography results in our
adult CF cirrhotic patients may be influenced by hepatic
steatosis.
(ii) CFLD is a known risk factor for a severe CF course in
children. However, the prognostic role of CFLD in adults
is less certain, and disease progression after adolescence is
rare [7,26]. Previous studies consisted of mixed patient
cohorts with a large proportion of pediatric patients
[12,13] or of CF children with portal hypertension [14].
Hence, the reported increase of liver stiffness in these
CFLD patients may be related to the more severe course of
pediatric CFLD while our results reflect a milder degree of
liver damage in adult CFLD cases.
(iii) The use of different CFLD definitions in previous studies
limits their comparability with our results [12,13]. We
defined CFLD according to Colombo’s criteria [1].
Though these criteria are sensitive for persistent liver
impairment, the diagnosis of CFLD is not always
associated with significant liver fibrosis [9]. The absence
of fibrosis in some cases may have limited accuracy of
ARFI and TE for CFLD detection in our study. In
Liver Stiffness Measurement in CFLD

addition, limited accuracy of all investigated ultrasoundand laboratory-based methods to detect liver fibrosis may
be also influenced by diagnostic limitations of our reference
method B-mode ultrasound. Conventional ultrasound may
misclassify patients as non-cirrhotic although they are
cirrhotic in reality.
(iv) The number of recruited patients - although comparable to
previous studies [12,13] - was not sufficient to detect a
significant difference of liver stiffness between CFLD
patients and those without CFLD. Based on a post-hoc
power calculation (alpha error 0.05, beta error 0.1), a
much larger case number would have been required for
reliable CFLD detection (n = 138 for TE and n = 171 for
right liver lobe ARFI, respectively). In addition, our case
number may have been too small to reveal correlations
between known risk CFLD factors and elastography results
although there was a trend of earlier age at diagnosis in
CFLD patients.
Figure 1. ARFI results in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and controls. Results of shear-wave velocity measurement in the liver tissue are
shown as boxplots (median, 25%- and 75% quartile, maximum and minimum, outliers) according to the site of measurement. Shear-wave velocity is
not increased in CF-related liver disease (CFLD) patients compared to healthy controls and CF patients without liver involvement. ARFI measurement
in the right liver lobe (A) can detect patients with cirrhosis in the CFLD group. Patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis have significantly higher shearwave velocity values than CF patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.002).

Ideally, non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis should be
compared to adequate results of liver biopsy. However, the focal
nature of liver damage in CFLD is the key problem for histological
assessment and limits its use as standard classification in CF [1]. If
focal liver disease affects biopsy, elastography will be affected as
well. The tissue volume assessed with TE and ARFI is relatively
small and even B-mode ARFI image measurement control cannot
exclude ‘‘acoustic biopsy sampling errors’’. However, we investiFigure 2. Transient elastography results in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Results of liver stiffness measurement are shown as boxplots
(median, 25%- and 75% quartile, maximum and minimum, outliers). Liver stiffness is not increased in CF-related liver disease (CFLD) patients
compared to CF patients without liver involvement. CFLD-patients with liver cirrhosis show a significant increase of liver stiffness.

Liver Stiffness Measurement in CFLD
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e42139

gated two different established elastography methods simultaneously and performed ARFI measurements in both liver lobes.
There was a high correlation of measurement results and thus a
sampling bias is unlikely. Moreover, we calculated APRI and
Forns index and showed comparable accuracy with ARFI and TE
for CFLD and cirrhosis detection. The APRI score performed best
compared to all other evaluated tests in our cohort. It may be an
interesting and easy to perform alternative for non-invasive
assessment of CFLD in adult patients which deserves further
evaluation in the future although it should be noticed that it was
unable to detect liver disease in pediatric patients before [13]. This
difference may be explained by age related levels of aminotransferases and platelets [28] which can result in imprecise upper limits
of normal and succeeding impaired diagnostic performance of
APRI.
In summary, right liver lobe ARFI and TE correlate with each
other in CF patients and can reliably detect CFLD related liver
cirrhosis. CF specific elastography cut-off values in adults are
lower compared to liver diseases of other etiologies. A structured
and prospective use of ultrasound- and laboratory based
approaches to investigate CF-related liver disease may detect
progression of liver fibrosis invisible by ultrasound and allow
further risk stratification in adult CF patients.
