In these unprecedented times of COVID-19, surgical
oncologists are being forced to consider triage and rationing of cancer surgery cases, for a number of reasons:
• the potential shortage of personal protective equipment,
such as masks, gowns, gloves;
• the potential shortage of hospital personnel due to
sickness, quarantine, and duties at home;
• the potential shortage of hospital beds, intensive care
unit (ICU) beds, and ventilators;
• the desire to maximize social distancing among our
patients, colleagues, and staff.
The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) asked each of
the SSO Disease Site Work Group Chairs and Vice Chairs
to provide their recommendations for managing care in
their specialties, assuming a 3- to 6-month delay in care.
These recommendations are summarized below.
The SSO supports the need for treatment decisions to be
made on a case-by-case basis. The surgeon’s knowledge
and understanding of the biology of each cancer, alternative treatment options, and the institution’s COVID-19
policies in place at the time the patient will be scheduled
for surgery all need to be taken into consideration.
The information below is based on the opinions of
individuals who are experts within their respective areas of
cancer and who are members of the Society’s various
Disease Site Work Groups.
BREAST CANCER
Defer surgery for at least 3 months for atypia, prophylactic/risk-reducing surgery, reconstruction, and benign
breast disease.

Ductal Carcinoma In Situ
• Defer for 3–5 months.
• Treat estrogen receptor (ER)? ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) with endocrine therapy.
• Monitor monthly for progression.
• ER- DCIS high priority for surgery when deemed safe
by the health system.
Estrogen Receptor? Invasive Breast Cancer (Stage I–
III)
• Treat with endocrine or chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant
fashion as deemed appropriate by multidisciplinary
tumor board recommendations.
Triple-Negative/HER2? Invasive breast cancer
• Treat with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for t2? and/or
n1? disease.
• Consider primary surgery as urgent if the patient is
unable to undergo chemotherapy or the tumor is small
and surgical information could inform chemotherapy
decisions.
Post-neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
• Delay post-chemotherapy surgery for as long as possible (4- to 8-week window) in those patients for whom
adjuvant systemic therapy is unclear/not indicated.
Unusual Cases/Surgical Emergencies/Special
Considerations
• Patients with progressive disease on systemic therapy,
angiosarcoma, and malignant phyllodes tumors should
be considered for urgent surgery and should not be
delayed.
COLORECTAL CANCER
• Defer surgery for all cancers in polyps, or otherwise
early-stage disease.
• Operate if obstructed (divert only if rectal), perforated,
or acutely transfusion-dependent.
• Proceed with curative intent surgery for non-metastatic
colon cancer.
• Consider all options for neoadjuvant therapy, including
utilization of total neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer, and to consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
locally advanced and metastatic colon cancer.
• For rectal cancer, neoadjuvant radiation component,
highly consider a short-course (5 9 5 Gy) regimen
(versus standard long-course chemotherapy).
• Delay surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer postneoadjuvant therapy for 12–16 weeks.
ENDOCRINE TUMORS
Most uncomplicated endocrine operations can be
delayed.
Diseases and presentations that might qualify for more
urgent surgery (i.e. within approximately 4–8 weeks during
the current pandemic), include the following.
Thyroid
• Thyroid cancer that is a current or impending threat to
life, those that are threatening morbidity with local
invasion (e.g. trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve),
aggressive biology (rapidly growing tumor or recurrence, rapidly progressive local-regional disease,
including lymph nodes).
• Severely symptomatic Graves’ disease that has not
responded to medical therapy.
• Goiter that is highly symptomatic or is at risk for
impending airway obstruction.
• Open biopsy with diagnostic intent for suspected
anaplastic thyroid cancer or lymphoma.
Parathyroid
• Hyperparathyroidism with life-threatening hypercalcemia that cannot be controlled medically.
Adrenal
• Adrenocortical cancer or highly suspected adrenocortical cancer.
• Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma that is unable to
be controlled with medical management.
• Cushing’s syndrome with significant symptoms that is
unable to be controlled with medical management.
• Generally, functional adrenal tumors that are medically
controlled, and asymptomatic non-functional adrenal
adenomas, can be delayed.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
• Symptomatic small bowel neuroendocrine tumors
(NETs; e.g. obstruction, bleeding/hemorrhage, significant pain, concern for ischemia).
1718 D. L. Bartlett et al.

• Symptomatic and/or functional pancreatic NETs that
cannot be controlled medically.
• Lesions with significant growth or short doubling times.
• Cytoreductive operations and metastasectomy should
generally be delayed but should be considered on an
individual basis.
GASTRIC AND ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
• cT1a lesions amenable to endoscopic resection should
preferentially undergo endoscopic management.
• cT1b cancers should be resected.
• cT2 or higher tumors and node-positive tumors should
be treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy.
• Patients finishing neoadjuvant chemotherapy can stay
on chemotherapy if responding to and tolerating
treatment.
Defer surgery for less biologically aggressive cancers,
such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), unless
symptomatic or bleeding.
HEPATO-PANCREATO-BILIARY CANCER
Operate on all patients with aggressive hepato-pancreato-biliary malignancies as indicated.
• Including pancreas adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer,
cholangiocarcinoma, duodenal cancer, ampullary cancer, metastatic colorectal to the liver.
• In cases where systemic chemotherapy is indicated in
addition to surgery, consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a means of postponing surgery.
• If responding to and tolerating neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, then continue and delay surgery.
Defer surgery for asymptomatic pancreatic NETs, duodenal and ampullary adenomas, GISTs, and high-risk
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, unless delay
will affect resectability.
Use neoadjuvant chemotherapy, ablation, or stereotactic
radiosurgery instead of resection for liver metastases where
possible. Consider ablation or embolization over surgical
resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
MELANOMA
• Delay wide local excision of in situ disease for
3 months and, as resources become scarce, all lesions
with negative margins on initial biopsy. Efforts should
be made to perform procedures in an outpatient setting
to limit the use of operating room (OR) resources. If
significant delay of definitive excision is anticipated,
the precise location of the biopsy site should be
carefully documented (e.g. photography, marking of the
site by the patient or caregiver) to facilitate identification at a later time.
• Surgical management of T3/T4 melanomas ([ 2 mm
thickness) should take priority over T1/T2 melanomas
(B 2 mm thickness). The exception is any melanoma
that is partially/incompletely biopsied in which a large
clinical residual lesion is evident. Gross complete
resection is recommended in this case.
• Sentinel lymph node biopsy is reserved for patients
with lesions[1 mm and, as resources become scarce,
set aside for 3 months.
• Manage clinical stage III disease with neoadjuvant
systemic therapy. If resources permit and the patient is
not suitable for systemic therapy, consider resection of
clinical disease in an outpatient setting.
• Metastatic resections (stages III and IV) should be
placed on hold unless the patient is critical/symptomatic or unresponsive to systemic therapies
(assuming surgical resources are available). Singledose palliative radiation may be considered for bulky
disease to alleviate symptoms if OR capacity is limited.
PERITONEAL SURFACE MALIGNANCY
• Operate on patients with malignant bowel obstruction if
a palliative procedure is feasible.
• As cytoreductive surgery/hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) can take unique levels of
resources, special consideration should be made for
proceeding with these cases.
• Defer CRS/HIPEC for low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms except in extreme circumstances.
• Consider neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy for
peritoneal metastases from high-grade appendiceal
cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, high-grade
mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and desmoplastic small
round cell tumors.
If patients are completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and are ready for surgery, consider continuing
chemotherapy if responding to and tolerating therapy. For
those who cannot continue neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
then consider delaying surgery for:
• 4–6 weeks in patients with high-grade appendiceal,
colorectal, mesothelioma, or ovarian cancer;
• 2–4 weeks in patients with gastric cancer or desmoplastic small round cell tumors.
Defer surgery for peritoneal metastases from rare lowgrade malignancies such as neuroendocrine tumors and
gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

SARCOMA
A primary soft tissue sarcoma without metastatic disease
on staging that needs surgery will be prioritized for the OR.
• Resection of newly diagnosed truncal/extremity atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs), classic
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans without fibrosarcomatous degeneration, and desmoid tumors can be
deferred for 3 months or more.
• Resection of other low-grade sarcomas with known
indolent behavior (e.g. retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcoma) and low metastatic risk (e.g. myxoid
liposarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid tumor) can be
deferred for short intervals depending on available
resources and absence of symptoms.
• Consider deferral of re-excision for R1 margins in
extremity/truncal lesions if OR resources are limited
and there is no evidence of residual disease on post
unplanned excision assessment.
If there is an indication for radiation therapy, plan to do
it preoperatively. This can be administered in a lower-risk
outpatient setting and will push out the timing of surgery
by about 3–4 months. In addition, consider the use of
preoperative radiation therapy as a bridge therapy to
postpone surgery when appropriate, even if the treatment is
not standard but there is evidence that it will not harm (i.e.
preoperative radiation therapy in retroperitoneal
liposarcoma).
Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-grade sarcomas at any site or for recurrent disease can be considered
if it can be safely delivered in an outpatient setting as a
means of deferring surgical intervention.
Use of neoadjuvant imatinib in localized GISTs as a
bridge therapy can be considered even if a formal indication for neoadjuvant therapy does not exist, provided the
mutation is sensitive.
Active observation protocols or low-toxicity systemic
options can be considered for patients with recurrent disease. Surgery for recurrent disease can be offered to
patients who:
• are likely to have relatively high chances of obtaining
long-term disease control in the context of complete
gross resection (e.g. long disease-free interval, solitary
site of recurrence);
• require immediate palliation (e.g. due to bleeding,
obstruction);
• do not have indolent histologies (e.g. well-differentiated liposarcoma in the retroperitoneum or classic
solitary fibrous tumor) that can be managed with active
observation.
