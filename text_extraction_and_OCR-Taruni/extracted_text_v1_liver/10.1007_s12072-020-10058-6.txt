Abstract
Background and Aim Cytokine storm has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We examine the incidence of acute on chronic liver 
failure (ACLF) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing compensated chronic liver disease (CLD).
Methods From 20 Jan 2020 to 7 Feb 2020, we studied 140 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to either Fuyang Second People’s Hospital (FYSPH), Anhui or the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (PLAGH) in Beijing, 
China. Pre-existing CLD includes those with liver cirrhosis assessed by APRI/FIB-4 score and /or ultrasound; NAFLD as 
identifed by either ultrasound or hepatic steatosis index with signifcant liver fbrosis and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or 
hepatitis C (CHC) infection. The diagnosis, grading of severity and clinical management of COVID-19 patients complied 
to the guideline and clinical protocol issued by the China National Health Commission. All patients had liver function test 
at least twice weekly till discharge with full recovery or death.
Results In total, 3 had liver cirrhosis, 6 patients had CHB, 13 had NAFLD with signifcant liver fbrosis (one also had CHB). 
On admission, none had liver decompensation. COVID-19 disease progression was signifcantly less frequent in non-CLD 
patients (10/118 8.5%) than CLD patients (13/22 59.1%, p<0.001). One patient with CLD had acute-on-chronic liver failure 
(ACLF).
Conclusion Disease progression is signifcantly higher in those COVID-19 patients with CLD as compared to those with no 
CLD. ACLF can also occur in patient with pre-existing compensated CLD who had severe COVID-19.

Introduction
With the rapidly expanding coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, liver injury has been increasingly 
recognized as part of the clinical picture. Indeed, hepatitis 
with elevation of serum alanine transaminases (ALT) has 
been reported to occur in up to half of the patients infected 
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) [1, 2]. The severity and frequency of liver injury correlate to the severity of COVID-19; those with disease progression sufered from severe liver injury more frequently 
[3–5]. The underlying mechanism of the liver injury remains 
speculative. In infuenza, severe hepatitis and acute hepatic 
decompensation in patients with underlying chronic liver 
disease (CLD) has been reported [6]. As no virus was found 
in the liver, “collateral damage” resulting from expanding 
CD8+ T cell populations during the infuenza infections has 
been implicated for liver pathobiology [7]. In COVID-19, 
there are cumulating immunological evidences to suggest 
that infammation serves as an important driver of disease 
progression. A phenomenon termed “cytokine storm” characterized by markedly elevated plasma levels of pro-infammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 
10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage infammatory protein 1-α, and tumour necrosis factor-α, has been 
associated with severe COVID-19 [3–5, 8]. These fndings 
bear resemblance to SARS caused by the SARS coronavirus, 
another closely related coronavirus, where cytokine storm 
and other dysregulated immune responses have been associated with disease pathogenesis [9]. On the other hand, direct 
cytopathic damage by the SARS-CoV-2 is also possible as 
there are entry receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) in the liver, especially in the bile duct cells [10]. 
Also, learning from SARS experience, the use of antibiotics, 
antiviral such as lopinavir/litonavir, other traditional Chinese 
medicine and secondary bacterial infection, might lead to 
liver injury in COVID-19 patients [11]. Globally, there is 
an increasing prevalence of CLD with underlying advanced 
fbrosis or cirrhosis, due to chronic hepatitis B or C infection 
and recently, non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver [12]. It 
is also unknown whether the disturbance of immunity related 
to COVID-19, will have an efect of hepatitis B or C infection, leading to reactivation [13, 14]. Many of these CLD 
patients are asymptomatic in a “compensated” state. With a 
reduced liver function reserve, these patients with CLD run a 
higher risk of decompensation with liver failure. So far, there 
is a lack of reports on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) 
in COVID-19 patients with compensated CLD. ACLF is a 
syndrome characterized by acute decompensation of CLD 
associated with organ failures and high short-term mortality. 
Nevertheless, there are great heterogeneity in the defnition 
of ‘acute’, ‘chronic liver’ and ‘failure’ by diferent working 
parties on ACLF [15]. In 2009, the Asian Pacifc Association 
for the Study of the Liver (APASL) provided the frst consensus on ACLF, defned as “an acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice and coagulopathy, complicated within 
4 weeks by ascites and/or encephalopathy” [16]. The 2014 
defnition was further expanded to include ‘high 28-day 
mortality’ [17]. The main diference with all other defnitions is that hepatic insults are only taken in consideration 
if they lead to liver failure (jaundice and HE). In this study, 
we report the incidence of liver injury and ACLF in patients 
with CLD compared with those without CLD, in accordance 
to APASL guidelines in Chinese with COVID-19.
Methods
Patients studied
Previously, we had studied patients presented to either Fuyang Second People’s Hospital (FYSPH) in Anhui or the 
Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital 
(PLAGH) in Beijing, China for the impact of non-alcoholic 
fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in patients with COVID-19 
[18]. From this cohort of patients, we reviewed their medical records for previous ultrasound studies, chronic hepatitis B infections and performed AST to platelet ratio index 
(APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), hepatic steatosis index (HSI) 
and BARD-Score to identify subjects with chronic liver disease (CLD). All COVID-19 patients without CLD admitted to these two hospitals during the same period as the 
COVID-19 patients with CLD were used for comparisons. 
These COVID-19 patients were follow-up till discharged 
with recovery or death (Fig. 1). The diagnosis and clinical management of COVID-19 patients were in accord to 
the practice guidelines “Chinese Clinical Guidance for 
COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment” issued by 
The Chinese National Health Commission, China. Briefy, 
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens was 
confrmed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay by local municipal Center 
for Diseases Prevention and Control (CDC). All patients 
received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. For those with 
severe symptoms, methylprednisolone (1–2  mg per kg 
weight per day) and empirical antibiotics (moxifoxacin or

piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem) would be administered according to patients’ clinical characteristics and physicians’ decisions. For those with respiratory failure, shock, 
or multi-organ failures, life support measures including 
ECMO were administered in an intensive care unit (ICU). 
Progression of illness was defned as development of at least 
one of the followings: respiratory rate≥30 breaths/min, resting oxygen saturation≤93% and PaO2/FiO2≤300 mmHg or 
worsening of lung CT fndings, during the hospitalization 
period. The criteria of hospital discharge included all the 
following conditions: body temperatures remain normal 
over 3 days, signifcant improvement of respiratory symptoms, resolution of pulmonary imaging of infammation, and 
repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2 confrm viral clearance 
at least one day apart. All CHB patients who were not on 
anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs), will be initiated 
NUCs if they received immunosuppressive therapy. Viral 
shedding period was defned as the time to undetectable

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from symptom onset [19]. The 
study was approved by the Ethics Committees of FYSPH 
(20200303006) and the Fifth Medical Center of PLAGH 
(2020005D). Written informed consent was waived in view 
of the designated hospital for new emerging infectious diseases status of the two centers.
Data collection
All the patients’ information, such as epidemiological, 
demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome 
data, were collected from medical records. All patients had 
liver biochemistries including alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on admission and then at least twice weekly 
till last follow-up. Comorbidity was defned as having at 
least one of the followings: hypertension, diabetes, coronary 
heart disease and chronic lung disease within 12 months 
of admission. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
was identifed as hepatic steatosis index [HSI=8×(ALT/
AST)+BMI (+2 if type 2 diabetes yes,+2 if female)] more 
than 36 points and/or by abdominal ultrasound examination [20]. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was defned as HBsAg 
positive for at least 6 months. Chronic liver disease was 
defned as FIB-4>3.25 or APRI>1.5 or CHB or subjects 
with HSI>36+BARD score 2–4 [21]. ACLF was defned 
by APASL criteria: jaundice (serum bilirubin>85 umol/L) 
and/or coagulopathy (international normalized ratio>1.5) 
complicated within 4 weeks by ascites or encephalopathy 
[17]. All the data in source documents were confrmed independently by at least two researchers.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ±SD and 
compared using the unpaired, two-tailed student’s t test (for 
normal distribution data) or median [interquartile range 
(IQR)] and compared with Mann–Whitney test (for skewed 
distribution data). Categorical variables were presented as 
numbers (percentage) and compared by the chi-square test 
or Fisher’s exact test. A p value<0.05 was considered as 
signifcant for all statistical tests. The statistical analyses 
were performed using R software, version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; https://
www.r-project.org/).
Results
Clinical characteristics of enrolled patients
Altogether, 140 patients with COVID-19 presented to the 
2 hospitals from 20 Jan 2020 to 7 Feb 2020 were enrolled 
(Fig. 1b). The median age (IQR) was 44.1 (33.3–52.3) 
years and 82 out of 140 patients (58.6%) were male. The 
median BMI (IQR) was 23.9 (22.0–26.0) kg/m2, 32 (22.9%) 
had underlying comorbidities, 54 (38.6%) had NAFLD, 
7 (5.0%) had positive HBsAg. The median in-hospital 
days were 18.0 (13.0–26.0) days. Of the 140 COVID 19 
patients, 118 (84.3%) had no CLD and 22 (15.7%) had CLD. 
Among those with CLD, 3 had cirrhosis with FIB-4>3.25 
& APRI>1.5, 6 had CHB and 13 NAFLD had signifcant 
fbrosis (HIS>36+BARD scores 2–4; one also had CHB). 
For the seven patients with CHB, two were already on 
entecavir 0.5 mg daily before COVID-19 diagnosis (HBV 
DNA copies 1.7×103 and 3.6×105 IU/mL) and the other 
three were started on entecavir 0.5 mg daily after admission (HBV DNA copies all<1.5×103
 IU/mL). Ten (77%) 
NAFLD patients had diabetes as well. Compared to those 
without CLD, those with CLD were older, with a higher 
BMI and more underlying comorbidities. Those with CLD 
also had higher proportion of patients with disease progression (Table 1).
Incidence of liver injury and dynamic changes 
of cytokines
During the clinical course of COVID-19, liver injury in 
terms of elevated serum ALT or ALP with GGT was the 
same among those with CLD as compared to those without 
CLD. The injury pattern was mainly hepatocellular with 
elevated ALP noted in less than four percent of subjects in 
each group. The mean of ALT, AST, TBIL, ALP, IL-6 and 
ferritin on admission, peak after admission, and discharge 
were shown in Fig. 2a. IL-6 levels were signifcantly higher 
in CLD patients at all three time points (42.5±11.9 pg/
mL vs. 16.2 ± 11.3  pg/mL, p < 0.001, 68.9 ± 46.9 vs. 
9.8±6.1 pg/mL, p=0.001 and 48.4±44.8 vs. 4.0±2.7 pg/
mL, p = 0.006, respectively). No significant differences 
observed with ALT, AST, ALP and TBL between the two 
groups. Serum ferritin levels were also higher in CLD group 
at admission (442.5±131.0 ug/L vs. 285.4 ±285.0 ug/L, 
p=0.034) and at peak values after admission 666.4±364.7 
ug/L vs. 410.9±391.6 ug/L, p=0.049) (Fig. 2a). Among 
CLD patients with or without CHB, there were no diference in ALT, AST, ALP and TBL, serum ferritin and IL-6 
on admission, peak and last follow-up (Fig. 2b).
COVID‑19 patients who had ACLF
A 79-year-old female with pre-existing NAFLD with fbrosis 
and no previous history of diabetes. She had a 4-day history 
of fever, cough with expectoration. SARS-CoV-2 infection 
was confrmed by real-time PCR assay from a throat swab 
sample. On admission, liver enzymes were normal. Chest 
X-ray showed multiple patchy ground glass opacities in

both lungs (Fig. 3). Oxygen therapy, methylprednisolone, 
human γ-Immune goblins, moxifoxacin and other symptomatic treatments were given according to the practice guidelines “Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia 
Diagnosis and Treatment” issued by The Chinese National 
Health Commission, China. Her serum IL-6 increased rapidly to 159.1 pg/mL on day 4 and ferritin level increased 
to>780 ug/L. On day 6, she had increasing dyspnea and 
serum creatinine increased from 64.4 to 126 mmol/L. Chest 
X-ray showed progression of multiple patchy shadows in 
both lungs. The patient was transferred to ICU for invasive 
mechanical ventilation (IMV) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Her bilirubin rose to 132 mmol/L 
fulflling the APASL criteria of ACLF on day 9. On Day 
12, her respiratory symptoms and liver functions improved. 
She became afebrile and CT showed signifcant resolution of 
the multiple patchy shadows. IMV was discontinued. However, her serum IL-6 increased markedly to 200.7 pg/mL 
on day 12 and ferritin continued to increase to>1444 ug/L 
on day 14. She developed fever with temperature 38.2 °C, 
melena and hypotension on day 14. She was treated empirically as septic shock with multiple antibiotics (tigecycline, 
vancomycin, capofungin, imipenum and cilastatin sodium). 
The liver function deteriorated again on day 16 followed by 
development of ascites. The patient succumbed on day 22 
with multi-organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 sequences were no 
longer detectable in patient’s specimens by RT-PCR from 
day 20 onwards (Fig. 3). The bilirubin, INR and IL6 levels at the time of death on Day 22 were 164.9 umol/L, 4.3 
and>500 pg/ml, respectively (Fig. 3).
Discussion
To date, there has been no report on the incidence of liver 
injury and ACLF in CLD patients with COVID-19. In our 
present report, we evaluate the pattern of liver injury and 
the occurrence of ACLF in those COVID-19 patients with 
pre-existing asymptomatic CLD. There were no signifcant 
diferences in terms of hepatocellular or ductular injury, as 
refected by the incidence and pattern of elevation of serum 
ALT or ALP, respectively among patients with or without 
CLD. However, COVID-19 patients with CLD was found 
to have a higher level of pro-infammatory cytokine, such

as IL-6 and ferritin. This is in keeping with the previous 
observation that elevation of serum level of TNF-alpha and 
IL-6 was signifcantly higher in cirrhotic as compared to 
those without liver disease on exposure to sepsis [22]. Most 
of the clinical reports in COVID-19 patients, had shown 
an elevation of proinfammatory marker in severe COVID19.1–5,8,9 Indeed, “cytokine storm” has been consistently 
reported to occur in severe or fatal COVID-19, as in SARS

[23]. In our study, CLD also had a signifcantly higher risk 
of disease progression. This further supports the inclusion 
of CLD as a comorbidity risk factor for disease progression 
in COVID-19 [18, 24].
There was one patient with CLD who developed ACLF 
and subsequently succumb after clearance of SARSCoV-2. The underlying mechanism is not clear. In an 
autopsy performed on a 50-year-old man with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, the liver tissue showed 
only moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular 
activity, but there was no conclusive evidence to support 
SARS-CoV-2 direct cytopathic efect or immune mediated 
injury [25]. There was also no mention of liver dysfunction in the report. However, the authors found that even 
though peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were substantially reduced and they were in a hyperactivated status, 
as evidenced by the high proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 
3·47%) and CD38 (CD8 39·4%) double-positive fractions. 
Also, there was an increased concentration of highly proinfammatory Th17 in the CD4+ T cells in the diseased 
patient favoring severe immune injury. In another report of 
post-mortem needle core biopsies of liver in four patients 
who died of COVID-19 pneumonia, the liver sections only 
showed mild sinusoidal dilatation, a common non-specifc 
change in terminally ill hospitalized patients [26]. Focal 
macrovesicular steatosis, and dense atypical small lymphocytes in portal tracts were seen in a patient with medical 
history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In general, there 
was no signifcant lymphocytic infltration of the portal 
tracts. No obvious fatty changes were seen in three of 
the four patients. Liver tissue from one patient contained 
regenerative nodules and thick fbrous bands, consistent 
with history of cirrhosis. One patient also showed patchy 
hepatic necrosis in the periportal and centrilobular areas. 
Again, there was no mentioned of ACLF in these four 
cases. Our patient had NAFLD with fbrosis. She developed multiple organ failures and eventually succumbed 
despite clearance of SARS-CoV-2. She had normal liver 
enzymes on admission, then developed jaundice and 
coagulopathy meeting APASL criteria of ACLF. With the 
recovery from respiratory distress and clearing of Chest 
X-ray abnormalities, her liver function and coagulopathy 
transiently improved. However, subsequently her disease 
followed a rapid progressive course. The underlying mechanism of liver damage was not clear, but both episodes 
were preceded by upregulation of infammatory markers, IL-6 and ferritin in the serum in keeping with previous reports of high levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in ACLF 
patients with systemic infammation [27]. Our study also 
showed that serum IL6 levels were signifcantly higher in 
COVID-19 subjects with CLD compared to those without CLD. Direct cytopathic liver damage by the SARSCoV-2 was possible, but SARS-CoV-2 sequences were 
no longer detectable in nasal swab specimens by RT-PCR 
from day 20 to day 22, the time period of the most rapid 
rise in liver enzymes and marked worsening of coagulopathy, At the same time, the serum IL6 and serum ferritin 
levels increased rapidly reaching highest levels on day of 
death, therefore favouring immune mediated attacks rather 
than direct cytopathic efects. Also, there was no conclusive evidence of direct cytopathic damage in any of the 
published autopsy cases [25, 26]. Hypoxic liver injury 
(hypoxic hepatitis) was another possible cause of deterioration of liver functions in the terminal phase of our 
patient. Hypoxic liver injury was reported in up to 2.5% 
of ICU patients, characterised by rapid transient increase 
of transaminases to greater than 20 times upper limit of 
normal and centrolobular necrosis [28]. Although hypoxia 
induced injury and other mechanisms, such as drug, traditional Chinese medication, sepsis, may contribute to the 
development of liver failure in our subject, the temporal 
relationship of elevation of infammatory markers with 
clinical deterioration suggested that excessive systemic 
infammation is likely to be the driver for the development 
of ACLF in COVID-19.
Our observation showed that ACLF could occur in 
COVID-19 patients with CLD. Further studies should be 
conducted so that more data can be collected to allow us 
to understand the full picture of COVID-19 on patients 
with CLD.
The shortcoming of the present study is that the presence of cirrhosis and advanced liver fibrosis was not 
detected by invasive liver biopsy. Instead, previously 
validated non-invasive markers, such as APRI score and

FIB-4 was used to assess the presence of underlying liver 
cirrhosis [29]. Further studies should be conducted so that 
more data can be collected to allow us to understand the 
full picture of COVID-19 on patients with CLD.
