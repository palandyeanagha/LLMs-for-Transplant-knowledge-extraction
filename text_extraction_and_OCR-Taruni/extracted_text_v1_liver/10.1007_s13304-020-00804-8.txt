On March 31st of this year, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared a pandemic infection from severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As on May 11th, 
there were around 4 million reported cases worldwide, with 
more than a quarter of a million deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, very long singlestranded RNA virus that shares a part of its genome 
sequence with SARS-CoV. Like SARS-CoV, it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (present in 
many compartments, including the hepato-biliary tract) to 
enter the target cells. A preliminary study suggested that 
ACE-2 receptor is particularly present in cholangiocytes [1], 
but SARS-CoV-2 infection does not cause bile duct injury, 
and bile duct markers are not severely altered in infected 
patients. A liver biopsy from a patient with COVID-19 
showed microvesicular liver steatosis, mild lobular and portal activity, a picture resembling drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) [2]. Though some drugs used to treat COVID-19 
patients are associated with DILI, the altered liver test fndings were largely present already on admission, so the DILI 
hypothesis is weak. The mechanism of liver injury is still 
unclear, but the most likely one relates to the liver being 
afected by the immunological reaction and severe infammation due to the viral infection. Patients with liver injury 
reveal higher inflammatory markers, such as C-protein 
reaction, procalcitonin and lymphopenia. They also have 
fever more frequently, and liver damage is more common in 
patients with severe pneumonia, which may be associated 
with an explosion of infammatory cytokines.
The incidence of elevated alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase transaminases associated with 
mild cholestasis in COVID-19 patients ranges from 14 to 
53%, peaking within the frst two weeks after admission. 
Whether patients with prior liver disease are more prone to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet clear. Patients with liver 
cirrhosis might be more susceptible to this infection because 
of their systemic immunocompromised status. According 
to a recent meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of chronic 
liver disease among patients with COVID-19 disease was 
3%, and the main causes of chronic liver disease were hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections 
[3]. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with 
pre-existing liver conditions, such as chronic viral hepatitis, 
is even trickier to establish. In patients with chronic liver 
disease, the addition of a further cause of liver injury—be it 
virus-directed or immune-mediated—might be expected to 
impair liver function, especially in the case of advanced liver 
disease. For instance, experience gained fromSARS-CoV 
in 2003 showed that concomitant infection with HBV could 
lead to severe hepatitis. But if the liver damage induced by 
COVID-19 is immunologically driven, as mentioned earlier, 
then the immunocompromised status of cirrhotic patients 
or cancer patients might be more protective than harmful. 
In a large cohort study on COVID-19 cases in China, 21 
individuals (2.1%) had pre-existing HBV, but no data were 
provided on this specifc group’s outcome [4]. Extracting 
data from seven studies, outcomes were not worse in 42 
patients with chronic liver disease and COVID-19, as the 
mortality rate was 0–2% [5]. A single case of acute chronic 
liver failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a decompensated alcoholic cirrhotic patient was recently reported. 
The patient responded to empirical antibiotic therapy and 
supportive care, completely recovering to his prior liver 
status [6]. Another important point to consider is that some 
drugs used against COVID-19 are biological agents (e.g. 
tocilizumab, baricitinib) that might reactivate HBV infection in inactive HBV carriers, or patients with occult HBV, 
thus causing liver function impairment. Strict monitoring 
of liver and virological tests are, therefore, warranted and

antiviral prophylaxis could be indicated in particular clinical settings. Drug-to-drug interactions should be checked 
before starting COVID-19 treatments, especially in patients 
with advanced liver disease taking many types of medication, including antiviral agents. A useful tool is available 
for this purpose: www.covid19-druginteractions.org. In 
patients with liver injury infected with SARS-CoV-2, hepatotoxic drugs should be used with caution, and liver function 
should be closely monitored to prevent it from deteriorating. 
Overall, the reported data are not yet enough for us to know 
the risk of infection in patients with existing chronic liver 
disease, or the impact of COVID-19 on their liver status 
and outcomes. Meanwhile, according to EASL-ESCMID 
position paper [7], adequate care should be assured—especially for patients with decompensated liver disease—using 
telemedicine if possible. A Chinese study showed that the 
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential complications in this population can be reduced by applying a simple 
approach, based on preventive messages and precautions 
sent to outpatients via WeChat, or adopted for decompensated cirrhotic inpatients [8].
Patients with liver cancer are another special population 
often coming to the hospital for treatment and monitoring, 
who may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, especially if they are receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 
The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in cancer patients treated 
at a tertiary institution in Wuhan was 0.79% (12 of 1524 
patients), higher than the reported cumulative incidence in 
the community during the same period [9]. Less than half of 
these infected patients were being actively treated for their 
cancer. Even with such small numbers, older patients and 
those with non-small cell lung carcinoma showed a higher 
risk of contracting COVID-19. Cancer patients generally had 
worse outcomes than other patients, with a mortality rate in 
the range of 5–20%, liver cancer being under-represented in 
the current literature [10].
Specifc measures for surveillance, follow-up and treatment have been recommended by the EASL, ESMO and 
ILCA. To ensure an adequate follow-up, outpatient visits 
could be conducted using telemedicine, whenever feasible, 
also considering the compliance of patients clearly hampered by their anxiety. Deciding the treatment strategy to 
avoid cancer progressing beyond the criteria for transplant 
is more challenging. According to the Society of Surgical 
Oncology [11], all patients with aggressive hepato-pancreato-biliary malignancies should undergo surgery. In cases 
where systemic chemotherapy is indicated in addition to 
surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered with a view to postponing surgery. Still, ablation or 
embolization should be used for HCC rather than surgical 
resection, when indicated. While patients with advanced 
liver cancer underwent locoregional and surgical treatment 
without any delay at some hospitals with a lower burden 
of COVID-19, treatment may have been postponed due to 
the COVID-19 emergency at other hospitals with a heavier burden of COVID-19, as in Lombardy. One group in 
northern Italy reported that 42 patients were scheduled for 
HCC treatments (both locoregional and systemic) with a 
delay of≥2 months in 26% of cases in the time of COVID19 (compared with a year before); and in three of these 
42 patients locoregional therapies were administered in 
lieu of previously-planned surgical resections [12]. At our 
hospital in the Veneto region, oncological strategies have 
been tailored to the local organization and treatment decisions have been discussed by the multidisciplinary team. 
Previously-scheduled locoregional treatments were not 
deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic because 
we were able to keep beds free for these procedures, and 
radiological activity went ahead as normal. Considering 
our hospital resources in the time of COVID-19, we saw a 
minimal reduction in the surgical procedures for hepatobiliary cancers, as patients with advanced liver cancer or at 
higher risk of tumor progression underwent liver resection 
as usual. On the other hand, the number of liver transplants 
performed between February 21st (when the frst case of 
SARS-CoV-2 was identifed in Veneto) and May 4th (the 
start of the second phase of the SARS-CoV-2 emergency 
in the region) was lower than in the same period in 2019, 
given a marked reduction in organ donations in the North 
Italian Sharing Organ Procurement area.
In conclusion, liver damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported quite frequently, especially in patients 
who developed severe COVID-19 disease. Whether the risk 
of infection and the virus’s impact on outcome are worse 
for patients with existing liver disease is still not entirely 
clear. Patients with chronic liver disease and liver cancer 
should, therefore, follow specifc measures and precautions 
to avoid clinical complications related to COVID-19. In 
COVID-19-saturated institutions, the scarcity of human and 
hospital resources probably prevented the regular radiological follow-up and oncological treatment of HCC patients. In 
the near future, our main task will be to establish whether 
the outbreak has worsened the prognosis for HCC patients, 
and to promptly reschedule their oncological treatments.
