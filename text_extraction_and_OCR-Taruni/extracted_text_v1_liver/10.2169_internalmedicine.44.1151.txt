Abstract
Object We summarize 10 years of experience with
liver transplantation for FAP patients in Japan and review the current opinions regarding this treatment for
FAP.
Methods and Patients All basic report data on patients
at the time of transplantation were registered with the
Japanese Liver Transplantation Society (JLTS). Based
on the JLST report data, more detailed information on
FAP patients was requested from each center.
Results Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)
for FAP patients was first performed in Japan in 1993.
LDLT has since been performed in 41 FAP patients, including nine cases of temporary auxiliary partial
orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT). Orthotopic
liver transplantation (OLT) from cadaveric donors for
FAP patients began in 1999, but only one FAP patient
has subsequently undergone this procedure. Of these
total of 43 FAP patients, 36 are currently alive: the oneyear survival rate of patients after transplantation was
93%, and the five-year survival rate of these cases was
77%. Preoperative clinical severity and the nutritional
status of patients are correlated with their outcome after
liver transplantation. Domino (sequential) liver transplantation has been carried out in 20 domino recipients
with end-stage liver diseases. Of the 20 domino recipients, 12 are currently alive.
Conclusion For FAP patients, these outcomes after
the operation were very similar to those of OLT from
cadaveric donors reported in other countries. Therefore,
we concluded that for the treatment of FAP, LDLT from
a living donor is equally effective as OLT from a
cadaveric donor.

Key words: familial amyloid polyneuropathy, living donor
liver transplantation, Japan
Introduction
Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is one type of hereditary generalized amyloidosis, initially showing polyneuropathy and autonomic dysfunction but with later involvement of many visceral organs (1). Four endemic areas
of this disease are known to exist in Portugal (2), Sweden
(3), and Japan (1). The precursor protein of amyloid fibrils is
a variant form of transthyretin (TTR) in serum (4). The vast
majority of patients show the typical clinical picture known
as type I FAP: the disease is caused by a mutation in the
TTR gene resulting in the substitution of methionine for
valine at position 30 (Val30Met) (5). Polyneuropathy begins
in the legs and progresses in an ascending fashion. As TTR
is produced mainly in the liver, liver transplantation for FAP
patients was first performed in 1990 in Sweden (6), which
was shown to result in the disappearance of variant TTR
with Val30Met from the sera of transplant recipients. Since
then, more than 800 patients in 16 countries have undergone
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) (7). Moreover, domino (sequential) liver transplantation using a graft from the
FAP patient was first performed in Portugal (8) in 1995, and
more than 200 domino transplant procedures reutilizing
explanted FAP livers had been performed by the end of 2002
(7, 9).

□ ORIGINAL ARTICLE □

TAKEI et al
The first liver transplant in a Japanese FAP patient was
carried out in November 1993 at Shinshu University
Hospital (10, 11), using living donor liver transplantation
(LDLT). This transplantation method that includes domino
liver transplantation has since been employed at different institutes in Japan. Here, we summarize 10 years of experience
with liver transplantation for FAP patients in Japan and review the current opinions regarding this treatment for FAP.
Materials and Methods
All basic report data on patients at the time of transplantation were registered with the Japanese Liver Transplantation
Society (JLTS). Centers report data on patients at the time of
transplantation, operative procedures, including transplantation from living donor or cadaveric donor, and/or temporary
auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT),
and patient death. Based on the JLST report data, more detailed information on FAP patients was requested from each
center: patients’ weight, height, and serum albumin levels
are necessary for calculation of the modified body mass
index (mBMI). TTR gene mutation, neurological severity of
FAP at transplantation, and pre- and postoperative states
were also obtained. Furthermore, data regarding domino
liver transplantation and Japanese FAP patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) from a cadaveric
donor overseas were collected.
Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to determine the significance of
differences between normally distributed means. KaplanMeier estimation for actual patient survival curves was performed. All statistical analyses were two-sided and were
conducted at the 0.05 significance level. Data are given as
means±SD.
Results
Liver transplantation for FAP
By January 2004, a total of 43 patients had undergone
liver transplantation in 9 centers in Japan (Table 1). The patients consisted of 21 men and 22 women, ranging in age at
liver transplantation from 26 to 63 years old (mean±SD, 40±
9 years old). Disease duration before liver transplantation
ranged from 0.5 to 10 years (mean±SD, 3.2±2.0 years). Five
different TTR gene mutations were reported (Table 2).
Among these, the Val30Met TTR mutation was the most
common, including 36 cases. Seven had non-Val30Met TTR
mutations: Tyr114Cys (n=3), Val30Leu (n=2), Ser50Ile
(n=1), and Ser50Arg (n=1). Of the total of 43 patients, 41
had undergone LDLTs from living donors. Of these 41
LDLTs, APOLT was performed in 9 patients. Only 2 patients had undergone OLT from cadaveric donors.
Based on the neurological severity before transplantation,
patients were staged clinically according to the criteria proposed by Coutinho et al (12): some autonomic dysfunction
was seen in 4 patients without any sensory or motor
neuropathy (stage 0); twenty-six patients had polyneuropathy
localized to the lower limbs (stage I); and neurological dysfunction was in the more advanced stages in the remaining
13 patients (stages II or III).
Among the total of 43 patients, 36 were alive, including
one patient who showed graft failure after APOLT and was
treated by removal of the transplanted graft 1 week later.
Twenty-seven patients returned to their previous normal
lives after transplantation, and 9 were in hospital or recuperated at home. Seven patients died after transplantation: with
regard to the severity of FAP, three patients were in stage I
and 4 were in stage II, and their causes of death were as follows: infection (n=2), hepatic artery thrombosis (n=2), multiple cerebral infarction (n=1), heart failure (n=1), and uterine
carcinoma (n=1). The registry analysis during the follow-up
of more than 1 year showed that mBMI of patients who returned to their normal lives were significantly higher than
those of patients in hospital or recuperating at home (p<0.05)
(Fig. 1).
The one-year survival rate of all patients after transplantation was 93%, and their five-year survival rate was 77%
(Fig. 2). The one-year survival rate of patients after LDLT
was 93%, and their five-year survival rate was 76%.
Living donors of LDLT
Among the 43 transplantations, 41 were LDLTs. All of
the donors had undergone TTR gene diagnosis and were

shown to be negative for TTR gene mutation. The age at operation ranged from 19 to 66 years old (mean±SD, 46±11),
and they consisted of 25 men and 16 women. The
intrafamilial relationships between living donors and FAP
patients are shown in Table 3. All of the living donors are
alive and returned to their normal lives after the operation.
Domino liver transplantation
Twenty recipients underwent domino liver transplantation
using the livers of FAP patients since 1999 in Japan. The age
at transplantation ranged from 17 to 64 years old (mean±S
D, 43±14 years old). The indications of domino recipients
are shown in Table 4. Among the 20 domino recipients, 12
were alive and 6 were dead, with no data available for the remaining 2.
Japanese FAP patients receiving OLT overseas
Twenty-one FAP patients with the Val30Met TTR mutation have undergone OLT from cadaveric donors (11 men
and 10 women). Eight underwent OLT in Sweden, and 13
were treated in Australia. The ages at transplantation ranged
from 28 to 49 years old (mean±SD, 36±6 years old). Disease
duration before transplantation ranged from 1 to 6 years
(mean±SD, 3.0±1.4). Among these 21 patients, only one
died early after transplantation because of primary nonfunctional transplanted graft. The 20 surviving patients were
all in good condition, and returned to their normal lives.
Discussion
Liver transplantation is now globally accepted for treatment of FAP patients. This therapy abolishes the hepatic
source of amyloidogenic TTR variants in serum and progression of the disease has at least halted in the patients receiving

successful operations (13, 14). Approximately 65 to 70 transplantations per year are carried out on FAP patients worldwide (15). In Japan, there are two large foci of FAP patients
(Arao city area in Kumamoto prefecture and Ogawa village
area in Nagano prefecture), and there are many additional
FAP families genetically unrelated to former endemic areas
(16). Nevertheless, the number of FAP patients undergoing
liver transplantation in Japan is relatively small, with only 3
to 4 transplantations per year being performed for Japanese
FAP patients. One important reason is that OLT from
cadaveric donors has not been widely accepted in Japan.
Approximately 2000 transplantations from living donors
have already been performed in Japan. However, based on
the records of the JLST, until January 2004 the total number
of OLTs from cadaveric donors in Japan is only 23, including the first case with Val30Met TTR type FAP treated successfully in 1999 (17). The graft size from a living donor is
much smaller than that from a cadaveric donor, which results
in long-term postoperative hospitalization for FAP patients.
In addition, postoperative recovery is sometimes problematic
in FAP patients receiving LDLTs (18). Despite these unfavorable conditions, the postoperative survival rate of FAP
patients undergoing LDLT from living donors is very similar
to that of patients undergoing OLT from cadaveric donors in
other countries; the five-year survival rate of FAP patients
undergoing LDLT in Japan was 76%, and according to The
Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy World Transplant
Registry (FAPWTR) in Sweden, that after OLT was approximately 80%.
The prognosis of FAP patients after liver transplantation
seems to be dependent on their preoperative state (19).
FAPWTR emphasized that the severity of autonomic symptoms significantly affected the patient’s recovery after operation, because many usually appeared in the patients at later
stages of FAP (15). However, gastrointestinal autonomic
symptoms, including severe episodic nausea, vomiting, and
alternating constipation and diarrhea, are often initial symptoms in Japanese patients with this disease (1), and these
bowel dysfunctions improved shortly after transplantation in
the FAP patients in our series (11, 18). Therefore, FAP patients with only autonomic disturbances are considered good
candidates for liver transplantation.
The mBMI is useful for estimating the nutritional status of
patients. This index was reported to be correlated well with
the prognosis of FAP patients after transplantation in foreign
countries (20, 21). The mBMI of patients who returned to
their normal lives after liver transplantation in our country
were significantly higher than those in hospital or recuperating at home at follow-up after more than one year. The
mBMI of patients who died after transplantation tended to be
lower than those in patients with good outcomes, except in
one patient who died of endometrial carcinoma 4 years 11
months after transplantation. Our results regarding mBMI
support those of previous reports (20, 21), indicating that the
nutritional state of FAP patients before transplantation is an
important factor in predicting their post-operative state.
FAPWTR reported that the type of TTR gene mutation is
a useful prognostic parameter (7, 15). A better 5-year patient
survival was reported in Val30Met TTR type FAP patients,
as compared to those with non-Val30Met TTR type FAP
(80% vs. 59%, respectively, p<0.001). In Japan, 2 patients
with Val30Leu TTR type FAP underwent LDLT, but both
died approximately one year after the operations. Autopsy
revealed heavy deposition of amyloid on the myocardium in
these two patients (22). Serious cardiac involvement by
amyloid is known to be one cardinal feature in FAP patients
with non-Val30Met TTR type (16, 23), and this severe phenotype of cardiac amyloidosis has been suggested to be responsible for the poor post-transplant prognosis in these FAP
patients. Recently, it was noted that after transplantation
rapid deterioration of cardiac function with further thickening of the ventricular wall occurred in some FAP patients, although polyneuropathy and autonomic dysfunction were
stabilized or slightly improved. These findings were originally obtained in non-Val30Met TTR type patients who may
have had substantial amyloid deposition on the myocardium
prior to the operation (24–26). However, a similar finding
was reported in typical FAP patients with Val30Met TTR
type (27). Wild-type TTR is regarded as playing a central
role in the pathogenesis of this form of cardiac amyloidosis
(22): wild-type TTR is inherently amyloidogenic, causing senile systemic amyloidosis (28), and conversion of normal
TTR to the amyloid fibril conformation may be promoted
after liver transplantation using a preexisting template of
variant TTR-derived amyloid deposits in the myocardium.
Therefore, it is critical to clarify the severity of cardiac
amyloid deposition when considering liver transplantation in
FAP patients. To overcome this problem, combined heart
and liver transplantation was carried out in a small number
of FAP patients in other countries (29).
As FAP patients who could obtain LDLT from a living
donor in Japan were restricted, twenty-one FAP patients
have undergone OLT in Australia or Sweden over the past
10 years (30). Their preoperative conditions of FAP were not
serious, which enabled them to go abroad, and the resultant
post-operative outcomes were satisfactory.
Liver tissue explanted from FAP patients has normal
structure and function except for the production of amyloidogenic variant TTR, and domino liver transplantation using
FAP liver grafts has been employed to compensate for the
shortage of available liver grafts (7–9). In other countries,
70% of these operations were performed in patients with
liver tumors, and 30% for non-malignant conditions (7). In
Japan, 20 domino recipients with different liver disorders underwent liver transplantation using grafts from FAP patients,
and 65% of them suffered from non-malignant diseases.
Development of FAP symptoms has not been reported in any
of the domino recipients at up to 7 years follow-up worldwide. However, Sousa et al reported that fibrillar deposits of
TTR were observed in the epineurium of the biopsied peripheral nerve in a domino recipient with a 6-year post-operative
history (31). Serial and careful follow-up of domino
1154 Internal Medicine Vol. 44, No. 11 (November 2005)

recipients is necessary.
In conclusion, LDLT from a living donor for the treatment
of FAP is equally effective as OLT from a cadaveric donor
and has changed the natural course of patients with this disease (32, 33). Early intervention (less than 5 years after
onset) can provide a better chance of improving patients’
conditions after transplantation (34). Considering that the
graft size from a living donor is much smaller than that from
a cadaveric donor, earlier transplantation is desirable.
However, this treatment cannot prevent the production of
variant TTR in the retina (35) or choroid plexus (36), and
long-term follow-up FAP recipients should undergo detailed
examinations of ocular and central nervous system manifestations.
