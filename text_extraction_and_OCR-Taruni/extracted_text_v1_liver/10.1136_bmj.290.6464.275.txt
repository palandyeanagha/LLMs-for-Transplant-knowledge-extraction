Abstract
Twenty two patients were entered into a randomised
controlied clinical trial comparing the efficacy of
somatostatin and vasopressin in controlling acute
variceal haemorrhage. Somatostatin was significantly
more successful in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage than vasopressin (p=0 003). Furthermore, no
complications were observed during treatment with
somatostatin.

Introduction
The main objective of vasoactive drug treatment of portal
hypertension is to control variceal haemorrhage until definitive
treatment can be undertaken. Although vasopressin has been
used for several years for the emergency control of bleeding
oesophageal varices,1 it is successful in only about half of all
patients.2 Moreover, treatment with vasopressin may have
undesirable side effects such as coronary vasoconstriction,
pulmonary oedema, and abdominal colic.3
Somatostatin, first isolated from the hypothalmus in 1972,4 is
widely distributed throughout the body, particularly high
concentrations being found in the central nervous system,
gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. In addition to inhibiting
the release of many gastrointestinal hormones,5-7 somatostatin
is also a potent inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic secretions.8 9
Furthermore, studies of the effects of somatostatin on hepatic
haemodynamics in animals and on wedged hepatic venous
pressure in man have suggested that somatostatin may be
effective in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage."° '1 The
aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of somatostatin
and vasopressin in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage in a
prospective randomised controlled clinical trial.

Methods
We studied patients with appreciable variceal haemorrhage as
defined by: either systemic disturbance (pulse rate greater than
100 beats/minute, systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg) for
two consecutive hours necessitating blood transfusion; or necessity
to transfuse two units of blood in 24 hours to maintain vital signs.
Bleeding varices were confirmed by endoscopy as the source of
haemorrhage in all patients.
Twenty two patients, satisfying the entry criteria, were randomly
allocated (using sealed envelopes) to receive intravenously either
vasopressin (argipressin; Ferring Pharmaceutical Company) or
somatostatin (Serono Laboratories, UK). The cause of portal
hypertension, grading of hepatic function according to Child's
criteria,12 age, sex, and ratio of index to interval episodes of bleeding
were similar in the two groups (table I). An index episode of bleeding
was defined as the first variceal haemorrhage and interval episodes
as all subsequent haemorrhages while the patient was undergoing
maintenance sclerotherapy.

Patients selected to receive vasopressin were infused at a rate of
0-4 U/min for six hours. If bleeding stopped the rate of vasopressin
infusion was decreased to 0-2 U/min for the following six hours,
then decreased to 0-1 U/min for a further six hours, and finally
stopped if no further bleeding occurred. Patients allocated to receive
somatostatin received a bolus dose of 250 ,ug followed by a constant
infusion of 256 iLg/h for 24 hours. Twelve patients received vasopressin and 10 somatostatin. In 18 of the 22 patients vasopressin or
somatostatin was used as a first line treatment. In the four remaining
patients the varices had been injected on admission as an initial
treatment but, because of continued bleeding, they were randomised
to receive one or other drug (one vasopressin and three somatostatin).
Successful control of variceal haemorrhage was defined as the
stopping of bleeding as evidenced b-y the absence of fresh blood in
the nasogastric aspirate, stable packed cell volume, or absence of other
overt signs of continued bleeding during the 18-24 hours of administration of the vasoactive drug. If haemorrhage was not controlled
by the vasoactive drug balloon tamponade of the oesophagus was
undertaken using either a Minnesota or a Sengstaken Blakemore tube.
Results
SOMATOSTATIN
The variceal haemorrhage was successfully controlled in all 10
patients receiving somatostatin (fig 1). Seven of these patients were
subsequently treated with injection sclerotherapy (one to three days
later) without any further episodes of bleeding. The three others,
however, rebled before definitive treatment could be undertaken.
One of the patients who rebled had been randomised to receive
somatostatin after a massive haematemesis following emergency
sclerotherapy. The haemorrhage was successfully controlled by
infusion of somatostatin, but he rebled on two further occasions after
the infusion of somatostatin had been stopped. In both cases infusion
of somatostatin was again successful in controlling the variceal
bleeding. He subsequently underwent successful oesophageal tranBRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 290 26 JANUARY 1985
section using a stapling technique. Another of the three to rebleed
refused injection sclerotherapy after initial control of her variceal
haemorrhage by somatostatin. She experienced four further appreciable episodes of bleeding in the three weeks after her initial
episode, all of which were controlled successfully by a 24 hour
infusion of somatostatin. She eventually died from multiple organ
failure. The third patient to rebleed did so after initial emergency
injection sclerotherapy for acute variceal haemorrhage. The bleeding
was successfully controlled by the administration of somatostatin,
but she subsequently sustained further massive variceal haemorrhage,
which was again controlled by somatostatin administration. She
underwent oesophageal transection under somatostatin cover but
subsequently died from a cardiac arrest in the intensive care unit. It
should be pointed out that she had had a cardiac arrest three hours
after admission with the initial episode of bleeding.
No complications were observed in any of the 10 patients during
infusion of somatostatin.

patients died from direct complications of balloon tamponade (inhalation in one case, oesophageal ulceration and perforation in the
other). In the two remaining patients the variceal haemorrhage was
not controlled by vasopressin and balloon tamponade. One of these
two underwent emergency oesophageal transection but died of liver
failure one week later. The other died of a combination of hypovolaemic shock and liver failure before any further treatment could
be undertaken.
COMPARISON
Analysis of the results by Fisher's exact test (table II) showed that
somatostatin was successful in a significantly greater number of
patients than vasopressin in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage
(p =0003). When the number of episodes of bleeding controlled by
somatostatin (17) was compared with the number controlled by
vasopressin (four) the difference between the treatments was of even
greater significance (p = 0-0002).

Discussion
The results of this randomised controlled clinical trial suggest
that somatostatin is more successful than vasopressin in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage when success is defined as
the stopping of bleeding during the administration of the
vasoactive drug. Moreover, no complications were observed in
those patients who received somatostatin. Although we initially
intended to randomise 30 patients to receive either somatostatin
or vasopressin, an adverse report'3 prompted us to perform a
preliminary analysis of our data. The highly significant result
obtained (p=0 003) in the first 22 patients clearly indicated
that the trial should be stopped.
This paper describes the first full report of a randomised
clinical trial comparing the efficacy of somatostatin and vasopressin in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage. These
results agree with two previous reports, one of which is anecdotal,"1 the other reported in abstract form only.'4 Raptis and
Zoupas, however, in a study of only five patients found that
somatostatin had no beneficial effect in the control of acute
variceal haemorrhage.15 The reason for the difference in results
is difficult to explain. In our experience, success with the
administration of somatostatin demands scrupulous attention
to detail. The bolus injection must be given after the infusion
has been started, and there must be no delay in changing
infusion bags. Although Raptis and Zoupas gave a bolus
injection followed by a constant infusion for up to 74 hours,
they do not give any precise details of their methods of administration or any indication of the precautions they took to ensure
that the circulating concentrations of the hormone did not fall
to below that required to exert a therapeutic effect.'5 Furthermore, their failure to show a fall in portal pressure after administration of somatostatin at operation is contrary to observations in cirrhotic rats'6 and cirrhotic patients,'7 using roughly
the same dose of somatostatin. Their failure to show a beneficial
effect of somatostatin in the management of acute variceal
haemorrhage may have been related to the method of administration.
Somatostatin has been shown to reduce splanchnic blood
flow in experimental animals'6 "I and in man." On the basis of
277
these initial studies and the observation that somatostatin
lowers wedged hepatic venous pressure in patients with cirrhosis
the hormone was suggested to be of possible value in the
management of patients presenting with acute variceal haemorrhage."1 Reports on the effects of somatostatin on hepatic
haemodynamics in cirrhosis have, however, been contradictory.
Thus an infusion of somatostatin (1 jig/kg body weight/min)
has been reported to reduce wedged hepatic venous pressure in
man." Similarly, -Bosch et al observed that an injection (1 jtg/kg
body weight) or an infusion (7-5 ,ug/min) of somatostatin
significantly decreased both wedged hepatic venous pressure
and estimated liver blood flow in cirrhotic patients.'7 In contrast,
Sonnenberg et al reported that an infusion of somatostatin
250 jig/h had no effect on wedged hepatic venous pressure or
liver blood flow in cirrhotic patients."9 The rate of infusion of
somatostatin used by Sonnenberg et al (3-0 jxg/kg body weight/h)
was lower than that used in other clinical studies and roughly
midway between the rates of infusion of the hormone that either
have had no effect or have significantly lowered portal pressure
in cirrhotic rats." Furthermore, we have previously shown
that in cirrhotic rats the beneficial effects of an infusion of
somatostatin on hepatic haemodynamics are enhanced by
prior bolus administration of the hormone."1 It therefore seems
likely that the conflicting reports on the effects of somatostatin
on hepatic haemodynamics in cirrhotic patients may be related
to the amount given and the mode of administration.
The precise mode of action of somatostatin has not yet been
established. The rapidity of onset of its effects on hepatic
haemodynamics in experimental animals and in man suggests
that the peptide acts directly on the smooth muscle of the
splanchnic blood vessels."'
Although bleeding stopped during the infusion of somatostatin in all 10 patients, three of the patients rebled before
definitive treatment (either the first injection of sclerosant into
the varices or oesophageal transection) could be implemented.
These episodes of rebleeding were, however, controlled with
further infusions of somatostatin, suggesting that a more
prolonged infusion of the hormone may be necessary to reduce
further the risk of haemorrhage before definitive treatment is
carried out. Prolonged use of somatostatin alone may therefore
avoid the use of balloon tamponade with all its recognised risks
such as oesophagitis, rupture of oesophagus, aspiration pneumonia, and airway obstruction. The 25% mortality directly
attributable to balloon tamponade in this study is similar to
that previously reported.20
In addition, somatostatin has several other potential advantages over vasopressin in the management of bleeding oesophageal varices. Firstly, as somatostatin has been shown to
stop bleeding from peptic ulcer in about 80% of patients
presenting for treatment2l' the hormone will have the additional
benefit of controlling haemorrhage from other sources when
they coexist with oesophageal varices. Secondly, somatostatin
has been shown to be effective in controlling haemorrhage from
ulcerative oesophagitis, a condition that sometimes accompanies
bleeding oesophageal varices.22 Finally, somatostatin, by
inhibiting gastric acid secretion,8 may promote healing by
preventing clot dissolution.
In conclusion, somatostatin would appear to be more effective
than vasopressin in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage.
Furthermore, in both the present study and studies by other
workers2l administration of somatostatin has appeared to be
free from the complications observed during administration
of vasopressin. It therefore appears that somatostatin is an
effective stopgap measure, giving time for patients' conditions to
improve and diagnostic measures to be undertaken.

ADDENDUM-Since this paper was accepted for publication a
report of a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing the
effects of somatostatin and vasopressin in the control of acute
variceal haemorrhage has been published (Kravetz D, Bosch J,
Teres J, Bruix J, Rimola A, Rodes J. Comparison of intravenous
somatostatin and vasopressin infusion in the treatment of
acute variceal haemorrhage. Hepatology 1984;4:442-6). There
was no difference in the effectiveness of somatostatin and
vasopressin in controlling variceal haemorrhage, but administration of somatostatin was associated with fewer complications.
The two trials are not, however, strictly comparable because
of differences, to which we have drawn attention (Hepatology,
in press), in the mode of administration of somatostatin and
vasopressin.

aged under 19 was compared with that of their unaffected identical cotwins measured at the same time.
In eight pairs the diabetic was shorter, and in the remainder the cotwins were the same height. In those
dbetics who were shorter than their cotwins at diagnosis
the average period of growth delay before diagnosis was
at least 35 weeks; by contrast, the mean duration of
symptoms was only six weeks. No cause for the growth
delay other than the diabetes was known in any of the
twins.
These findings show that the onset of insulin dependent
diabetes may be a slow process, with delay
occurring several months before symptoms appear.

Introduction
Growth is a sensitive indicator of health in childhood. Uncontrolled diabetes retards growth: before the discovery of
insulin growth stopped completely in children who developed
diabetes.' We have used these observations to determine
whether diabetes can be present, as shown by growth delay,
before the appearance of symptoms.
Studies of heights at diagnosis in diabetic children have
produced conflicting results. In most the diabetics were found
to be taller than expected,2-' although some studies showed
that their heights were normal8 10 1 or that they were shorter.12-"4
These discrepancies may be due to the difficulty in obtaining
exactly matched control groups. When comparing heights the
groups must be accurately matched for social class, racial
origin, and parental height. The ideal control for a diabetic
child is his unaffected identical twin, as twins usually grow at
the same rate and to the same final height.",
We studied the heights of identical twins discordant for
insulin dependent diabetes at the time of diagnosis of the
diabetic twin in order (a) to determine whether the diabetic
was taller or shorter at diagnosis than his unaffected cotwin
and (b), if there was a difference, to estimate how long before
diagnosis growth had been affected.
Subjects and methods
We studied identical twins included in the King's College Hospital
survey. Monozygosity was established as described."6
