Abstract
Venous aneurysms are benign acquired vascular lesions. A 59-year-old man developed a lesion on his right
wrist that would enlarge and flatten depending on whether his arm was dependent or elevated; he had no
prior history of trauma to the site. Examination of his wrist revealed a soft, compressible nodule contiguous
with venous structures in the area. The history and clinical appearance established the diagnosis of a
superficial venous aneurysm. Venous aneurysms typically occur on extremities, either in the superficial or
deep venous systems; a prior history of trauma is often elicited. Clinical observation may be appropriate for
the management of venous aneurysms; however, symptomatic lesions often require excision. In conclusion,
venous aneurysms often appear in adults; trauma may or may not precede their appearance. Asymptomatic
lesions may be observed, whereas surgery may be necessary to resolve the condition if the aneurysm is
symptomatic.

Introduction
Venous aneurysms are uncommon benign vascular lesions. Venous aneurysms in the upper extremity are
rare and often misdiagnosed as soft tissue masses. They are usually acquired and may be preceded by trauma.
Venous aneurysms are associated with the potential risk of thromboembolism; therefore, they require
correct diagnosis and treatment— either with surgical excision or close observation [1]. A man who
developed a superficial venous aneurysm on his right wrist without a prior history of injury to the site is
described and the salient features of this condition are reviewed.
Case Presentation
A 59-year-old man with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer was followed by his dermatologist every six
months for skin checks. His prior skin lesions included a basal cell carcinoma on the back, squamous cell
carcinomas on the cheek and antihelix, and multiple actinic keratoses. Benign lesions included lipomas on
his upper extremities. Four years ago, he developed an asymptomatic lesion on his distal flexor right forearm
overlying his wrist. There was no history of trauma to the site.
Cutaneous examination of his right forearm showed a soft, 10 x 10 mm, compressible blue subcutaneous
nodule that was most prominent when his arm was held in a dependent position (Figure 1). When he would
raise his arm above the level of his heart, the nodule would spontaneously flatten.

FIGURE 1: The distal right flexor forearm of a 59-year-old man with a
superficial venous aneurysm
Distant (A) and closer (B) views show a full aneurysm (arrows) demarcated by the pen marks extending from
the nodule; a vein is noted to be entering and exiting the dermal tumor. When the arm is raised, the vascular
tumor-distant (C) and closer (D) views- shows flattening of the aneurysm (arrows).
Correlation of the history and clinical morphology established the diagnosis of a superficial venous
aneurysm. The aneurysm did not interfere with the patient’s activities of daily living. Therefore, he declined
any additional evaluation and no therapeutic interventions were initiated.
Discussion
Venous aneurysms are acquired benign vascular lesions. They represent a dilation of a segment of vein that
is at least 1.5 times the diameter of the adjacent non-dilated vein. In addition, they are not associated with
an arteriovenous communication, pseudoaneurysm, or varicose vein [2].
Venous aneurysms are classified as either superficial or deep. Superficial venous aneurysms occur in the
saphenous system of the leg or the basilic and cephalic venous systems of the arm. Deep venous aneurysms
involve the femoral venous system of the leg or the deep fascia of the arm [3].

Venous aneurysms are typically described in middle-aged adults. However, they can also occur in childhood
or the elderly. They are equally common in men and women. However, they have been observed more
frequently in individuals with higher body mass indices [2].
Venous aneurysms are typically preceded by trauma; yet, idiopathic lesions may develop. They are usually
asymptomatic; however, patients can develop symptoms of vascular reflux including edema, swelling, and
pain. Deep venous aneurysms carry a distinction from superficial ones since they have an increased risk of
venous thromboembolism [1].
Similar to our patient, superficial venous aneurysms may present as asymptomatic subcutaneous soft
nodules that expand and flatten dependent on position of the extremity. In contrast, deep venous
aneurysms may present as painful or swollen soft tissue masses. In addition, deep venous aneurysms can
also present with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [3]. The clinical differential diagnosis for
a venous aneurysm includes benign adipose, melanocytic and vascular lesions (Table 1) [4-12].
Clinical
diagnosis
Clinical findings Pathology findings Reference
Angiokeratoma
Hyperkeratotic dark red to purple-blue
papules, plaques or nodules, commonly
seen on the extremities and trunk
Superficial vascular ectasia of the papillary dermis
with overlying epidermal hyperkeratosis.
[4]
Arteriovenous
malformation
Brown to violaceous plaques that feel warm
with a palpable thrill or bruit. Most
commonly seen on the head and neck.
Tangle of arteries and veins connected by fistulae that
bypass the capillary bed.

Blue nevus
Dermal papules, plaques or nodules with
dark blue or blue-black discoloration. Most
commonly seen on the distal extremities,
buttocks, scalp and face.
A proliferation of dendritic and spindled melanocytes
in the reticular dermis. May be associated with
sclerosis.
[6]
Lipoma
Soft, mobile, subcutaneous masses that are
commonly seen on the trunk and upper
extremities
Mature, white adipose tissue without atypia. [7]
Varicose vein
Subcutaneous tortuous, dilated veins,
typically seen on the legs and worsened
with prolonged standing
Vessel wall with hypertrophic smooth muscle layers,
disorganized elastin fibers, and increased fibrous
tissue.
[8]
Venous

Single vessel with fibrous intima and adventitia, loss
of smooth muscle, and fragmentation of elastic

found on sun-exposed surfaces of the lips,
face, and ears
Single, large dilated vessel with flat endothelial lining
and a thin fibrous wall. Thrombus may be present.
[10]
Venous
malformation
Blue or purple rubbery nodules that are
easily compressible, typically presenting in
childhood and growing with age
Dermal or subcutaneous aggregation of multiple,
dilated vascular channels with flat endothelial lining;
closely packed and often with thrombosis or
phleboliths within the vessel lumen.
[11]
Venous
pseudoaneurysm
Soft blue mass that may progress over
months to years. Commonly iatragenic or
congenital.
Dilated vessel with absence of endothelium. Intima
and media are thickened.
[12]
TABLE 1: Clinical and pathological differential diagnosis of venous aneurysm
Microscopic examination of venous aneurysms typically show thinning or absence of the vascular muscle
layer. In addition, fragmentation of elastin fibers and an increase in fibrinous connective tissue may be
present [3, 9].
Initial evaluation of a venous aneurysm includes venous duplex ultrasound imaging to establish the size as
well as the presence of a thrombus. Further diagnostic workup may include computerized tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging.

The pathogenesis of venous aneurysms can be idiopathic. Indeed, spontaneous venous aneurysms have been
described in congenital vascular syndromes, such as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome [1]. Alternatively,
venous aneurysms may occur secondary to inflammation, trauma, or venous insufficiency.
A mechanism for venous aneurysm was described in 1951 by Lev and Saphir; they utilized the terms
endophlebohypertrophy (congenital) or phlebosclerosis (acquired) [13]. These terms describe the changes in
the vessel wall marked initially by proliferation (endophlebohypertrophy) in the first decades of life,
followed subsequently by reduction (phlebosclerosis) of smooth muscle, fragmentation of elastin fibers, and
increase of fibrous connective tissue with age. This process may be more pronounced in anatomical areas of
high vascular trauma, such as the popliteal vein [14].
Complications of untreated venous aneurysms include disfigurement (such as mass or varicosities), edema,
pain, thrombophlebitis, or thrombus formation with recurrent thromboembolism [3]. Treatment of venous
aneurysm includes either observation or surgical intervention (such as excision or ligation) or, less
commonly, endovascular ablation. However, observation may be appropriate for asymptomatic superficial
venous aneurysms— similar to our patient.
Conclusions
Venous aneurysms are benign vascular lesions often preceded by trauma. Superficial venous aneurysms may
be diagnosed clinically; their morphology can vary based on the position of the affected extremity. The
management of venous aneurysms can include surgical or radiofrequency techniques; however, aneurysms
without associated complications may be observed.
