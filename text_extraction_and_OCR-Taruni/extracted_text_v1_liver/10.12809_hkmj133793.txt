Objective The clinical features of patients with psoas abscess in a local 
setting, including the microbiology, incidence and aetiologies, 
have not been well described. This study aimed to review such 
clinical features and patient outcomes.
Design Retrospective case series.
Setting Regional hospital, Hong Kong.
Patients Adults (aged ≥18 years) with psoas abscess admitted to Tuen 
Mun Hospital from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010 were 
included. The clinical presentations, aetiologies, microbiology, 
treatments, hospital stays, intensive care unit admissions, and 
outcomes of these patients were reviewed.
Results The series entailed 42 patients, five of whom developed their 
psoas abscess after admission and seven were intravenous drug 
abusers. The most common presenting symptom in communityonset cases was back, hip, or thigh pain (43% [16/37]). Fever was 
present at presentation in 41% (15/37) of these patients, four 
of whom presented with fever only. The diagnosis was made 
by computed tomography in 95% (40/42) of these cases. In all, 
23 abscesses were considered secondary; the most common 
aetiology being infective spondylitis or spondylodiscitis. The 
commonest causative organism for a primary psoas abscess was 
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, while for secondary 
abscesses they were more commonly from the gastro-intestinal 
and genitourinary tracts. Overall in-hospital mortality rate 
was 14% (6/42). Secondary psoas abscess patients had longer 
hospital stays (mean, 62 vs 34 days; P=0.007). 
Conclusion Psoas abscess is an uncommon condition. Most patients presented 
with only non-specific symptoms leading to difficulty in making 
an early diagnosis. In more than half of these patients, the psoas 
abscesses were secondary, the aetiology of which differed from 
reported overseas experience.

Introduction
Psoas abscess is an uncommon but dangerous condition. The high susceptibility of the 
psoas muscle to infections is related to its unique anatomy; organisms can access the 
muscle by either direct extension or via haematogenous seeding. The psoas muscle 
originates from the lower thoracic and all the lumbar vertebrae (lateral borders of T12 to 
L5), and extends through the pelvic retroperitoneum and over the pelvic brim to insert 
onto the lesser trochanter of the femur. Thus, it lies in close proximity to a number of 
retro- and intra-abdominal organs, including the kidneys, ureters, pancreas, appendix, and 
large and small intestines. Organisms from these organs could spread directly to the psoas 
New knowledge added by this study
• About half of all local patients with a psoas abscess had a secondary cause.
• The most common aetiology for a secondary psoas abscess was infective spondylitis (or 
spondylodiscitis), in which the finding differed from overseas experience.
Implications for clinical practice or policy
• Patients with psoas abscess commonly present with non-specific symptoms leading to 
difficulties in making an early diagnosis.

muscle. Moreover, the abundant blood supply of the 
muscle is believed to be a predisposing factor for 
haematogenous spread from distant sources.1
 The 
clinical presentation is usually insidious. The classical 
clinical triad—fever, back pain, and flank or groin 
mass—only ensues in a minority of patients. Treatment 
consists of adequate drainage either percutaneously 
or surgically, coupled with prompt antibiotic therapy. 
Serious complications such as sepsis and even 
mortality could result from delay in diagnosis. The 
presence of co-morbidities is also associated with 
a poor prognosis. Psoas abscess is traditionally 
classified into primary or secondary depending on 
the presence or absence of an identifiable infectious 
focus in an adjacent structure. Previous studies 
showed a high prevalence of primary psoas abscess 
in Asia.2
 In 1966, Lam and Hodgson3 published a 
local study involving 24 patients with primary psoas 
abscess treated in Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary 
hospitals between 1961 and 1965, all of which ensued 
despite exclusion of pelvic, retroperitoneal, and 
thoracic infections. Regarding locally encountered 
primary and secondary psoas abscesses, possible 
aetiologies and involved microbes have not been 
well described. 
Methods 
All clinical data were retrieved from the hospital 
electronic record database, as well as the Clinical 
Data Analysis and Reporting System that is a 
computerised data retrieval system of the Hong Kong 
Hospital Authority.4
 The diagnosis of psoas abscess 
(ICD-9 coding 728.89) under the categories of “any 
diagnoses” was searched. All patients with a psoas 
abscess admitted into Tuen Mun Hospital between 
the period of 1 January 2006 and 31 December 
2010 were included. This hospital has around 2000 
beds serving Tuen Mun New Town and northwest 
regions of the New Territories in Hong Kong. Patient 
inclusion criteria were: (1) established diagnosis of a 
psoas abscess by (a) computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or (b) surgical 
drainage; (2) aged 18 years or above; and (3) availability 
of complete clinical records for review. Patients 
were excluded if the diagnosis was only based on 
clinical suspicions in the absence of imaging and/
or operative confirmation. Clinical presentations, 
including symptoms and signs and their duration, 
microbiology, underlying pathologies, treatments 
offered, and outcomes were reviewed from the 
clinical records. The entire study was approved by 
the institutional review board at the New Territories 
West Cluster of the Hospital Authority. 
In this study, a primary psoas abscess was 
defined as occurring without an identifiable source 
of infection outside the psoas muscle, while it was 
considered secondary if there was a contiguous

Statistical analyses
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(Windows version 19.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago [IL], US) 
was used for all analyses. Descriptive statistics were 
used to summarise patient demographics. Univariate 
analysis was performed with the Fisher’s exact test 
for comparison of proportions and Student’s t test 
for comparison of means. Independent risk factors 
for mortality were evaluated by multivariate analysis 
and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 
Results
Patient characteristics
In all, 49 patients with a psoas abscess occurring 
during the study period were identified, seven of 
whom were excluded for one or more reasons: 
wrong ICD-9 coding (n=5); incomplete clinical

records (n=2), aged less than 18 years (n=1); and no 
imaging or operative confirmation of the diagnosis 
(n=1). The mean age of the final cohort of 42 cases 
was 61 (standard deviation, 16; range, 27-96) years. 
There were 27 males and 15 females; most (88%, n=37) 
had one or more additional medical condition. The 
most common of these were hypertension (n=14), 
diabetes mellitus (n=13), cardio/respiratory disorder 
(eg ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and 
chronic obstructive airway disease) [n=7], intravenous 
drug addiction (n=7), underlying malignancy (n=6), 
cerebrovascular accident (n=5), and chronic hepatitis 
(n=4). 
The underlying malignancies included 
carcinoma of sigmoid/colon (n=3), liver (n=1), cervix 
(n=1) and prostate (n=1), and the chronic hepatitis 
types were B (n=2), C (n=1), and both B and C 
(n=1). One patient was receiving long-term steroid 
therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and another was on 
chemotherapy for colonic carcinoma. None of the 
patients had liver cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection, a haematological malignancy, or 
inflammatory bowel disease. Regarding the patients 
with diabetes mellitus, in nine of them the mean value 
of their latest recorded glycosylated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c) level before admission was 10.7% (range, 
6.6-15.9%); HbA1c levels of four patients were not 
available. 
Clinical presentations 
Five patients developed their psoas abscess after 
admission, their presenting features on admission 
being unrelated to their abscess. Details about 
these five cases are summarised in Table 1, while the 
clinical presentations on admission in the remaining 
37 cases are summarised in Table 2. Among the 
community-onset psoas abscess patients, 18 were 
initially admitted to the medical unit, 13 to the

orthopaedic unit, and five to the surgical unit; one 
patient was directly admitted into the intensive care 
unit for management of septic shock. Around half of 
the patients (43% [16/37]) presented with back, hip or 
thigh pain, and 14% (5/37) with abdominal pain. Fever 
was present in 41% (15/37) of these patients, four 
of whom only had fever at presentation. A groin or 
flank mass, and limited hip movement were detected 
in about one fourth and one fifth of the patients, 
respectively. No patient presented with the classical 
triad (fever, back pain, and groin or flank mass). There 
was evidence of sepsis in 43% (16/37) of the patients 
and 8% (3/37) had hypotension on presentation. 
Diagnosis 
In 95% (40/42) of the cases the diagnosis of psoas 
abscess was made by CT, in one patient it was 
confirmed by MRI, and in another it was diagnosed 
intra-operatively. Bilateral psoas abscesses were 
detected in eight patients, whilst 34 had unilateral 
psoas abscesses (right-sided, n=18 and left-sided, 
n=16).
Aetiology and microbiology
The culture results are summarised in Table 3. 
Presence of pus and positive blood cultures were 
found in 27 and 15 patients, respectively. The most 
common organism cultured in both blood and pus 
was methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
(MSSA), whereas methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) was cultured from both the pus and 
blood of two patients. One of whom had enjoyed 
good past health without any recent hospitalisation 
or medical procedure, but the other had endured 
multiple medical illnesses and had been recently 
hospitalised. Secondary psoas abscesses were most 
commonly associated with infective spondylitis or 
spondylodiscitis (n=9). Other identifiable causes 
included septic arthritis of hip (n=3), osteomyelitis 
of vertebral bodies (n=1), pyogenic sacroiliitis 
(n=1), infected carcinoma of colon (n=3), infected 
peritoneal metastasis (n=1), liver abscess (n=1), 
infected carcinoma of the cervix (n=1), pyonephrosis 
(n=1), mycotic abdominal aneurysm (n=1), and 
suspected retained foreign body (n=1). The Figure 
shows the radiological features of four illustrative 
cases with secondary psoas abscesses. 
Psoas abscesses due to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection 
There were six patients with psoas abscess due 
to tuberculosis infection (mean age, 54; range, 
32-96 years), five of whom were admitted via the 
emergency department. The remaining patient had 
had a tuberculosis psoas abscess 3 years earlier 
and was found to have recurrence at follow-up, for 
which she was admitted and had surgical drainage. 
Four patients presented with a groin or flank mass, 
only two of whom had fever on presentation. Pus 
and wound swab cultures were negative for other 
bacteria in all of the cases. The initial acid-fast bacillus 
smear was positive in only one patient, but all six had 
culture-positive psoas pus. In addition, the sputum of 
one patient was culture positive for M tuberculosis, 
and another had M tuberculosis cultured in a gastric 
aspirate. Two out of the six patients were considered 
to be primary and other four were regarded as 
secondary infections from the spine (n=3) and hip 
(n=1). One (17%) of these six patients died.

Psoas abscess in intravenous drug abusers 
Among our patients there were seven intravenous 
drug abusers; six were considered to have a primary 
(haematogenous) psoas abscess and the other was 
regarded as secondary to left hip septic arthritis. Pus 
cultures yielded MSSA in six of them, including the 
patient with a secondary psoas abscess. The other 
patient had Streptococcus milleri and Prevotella 
intermedia cultured from the pus. Among the six 
patients with MSSA infections, five had only this 
organism grown from pus; the remaining patient was 
also culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
and Peptostreptococcus species. All six patients 
with positive pus cultures of MSSA also had MSSA 
bacteraemia. 
Treatment and outcomes 
Five patients received antimicrobial treatment only 
and 37 also underwent drainage (CT-guided [n=23], 
ultrasound-guided [n=4], and operative [n=10]). 
The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy for the 
pyogenic infections was 61 (standard deviation, 34)

psoas abscess (white arrowhead). Ligation of the mycotic aneurysm with a femoro-femoral bypass procedure and surgical drainage of 
abscess were performed. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital, taking lifelong antibiotic prophylaxis. (c) A 73-yearold woman admitted for persistent fever, whose CT abdomen shows a distal ureteric stone (not shown) causing right hydronephrosis 
and suspected pyonephrosis (black arrowhead). Peri-renal fat stranding (white arrow) and a large right psoas abscess with internal gas 
locules (curved white arrow) are present. The patient eventually died of uncontrolled sepsis. (d) A 28-year-old male with a history of 
appendicectomy 4 years ago presented with right lower quadrant pain. A right psoas abscess (large white arrow) was revealed by CT 
together with a metallic density inside the collection (small black arrow). A retained foreign body from the previous operation was 
suspected. The patient was treated using CT-guided drainage and the abscess resolved

days (excluding one patient with a psoas abscess 
secondary to Salmonella arteritis who was offered 
lifelong antibiotic therapy). 
Except for one in-hospital fatality, patients 
with tuberculous psoas abscesses received antituberculosis therapy for 9 months to 1 year. Their 
mean length of hospital stay was 49 (range, 8-183) 
days. Six (14%) of the patients were admitted to the 
intensive care unit. 
Overall in-hospital mortality rate was 14% 
(6/42). One patient was complicated by deep vein 
thrombosis and a sudden cardiac arrest during the 
hospital stay. Two patients died of uncontrolled 
sepsis; one who had a poor premorbid state was 
treated conservatively after discussion with patient’s 
family, another died of nosocomial multidrug 
resistant Acinetobacter infection. Yet another 
patient had a terminal malignancy and died of 
disseminated tuberculosis infection. The mean 
duration of hospital stay was significantly longer 
for patients with a secondary psoas abscess (62 
vs 34 days; P=0.007 [Table 4]). The mean age of the 
survivors was lower than that of those who died 
but the difference was not statistically significant 
(58 vs 76 years; P=0.063). Primary psoas abscesses 
appeared to be associated with higher mortality but 
not to the extent of statistical significance (26% vs 
4%; P=0.063 in multivariate analysis). Based on the 
multivariate analysis, differences between groups in 
relation to gender, underlying disease (eg diabetes 
mellitus, cirrhosis, cardiac or respiratory diseases, 
hepatitis B or C, HIV infection, and malignancy), 
receipt of immunosuppressants (including steroids), 
intravenous drug abuse, being chair- or bedbound, intensive care unit admission, presence 
of bacteraemia, and causative organisms were not 
statistically significant independent risk factors for 
mortality (Table 5). 
Discussion 
In 1986, Ricci et al2 reviewed 367 cases of psoas 
abscess from the world literature and reported 
differences in the aetiology worldwide. Thus, 70% 
(200/286 cases) of primary psoas abscesses occurred 
mainly in the developing countries, while secondary 
abscesses appeared exclusively in reports from 
developed countries including Europe, the United 
States, and Canada. The most commonly reported 
aetiology for secondary abscesses was Crohn’s 
disease.2
 More recent studies also revealed Crohn’s 
disease as the most common aetiology of secondary 
psoas abscess in overseas countries.6,7 Secondary 
psoas abscesses were reported to be more likely in 
older patients.2
 However, this was not evident in the 
current study. 
Primary psoas abscess probably occurs as 
a result of the haematogenous seeding from an 
infectious process in a distant occult source. Other 
proposed pathogeneses include suppurative 
lymphadenitis, and trauma with haematoma 
formation and secondary infection.8,9 Medical 
conditions causing immunosuppression (including 
diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, receipt of steroids 
or chemotherapy) are risk factors for a primary psoas 
abscess.1
 Secondary psoas abscess is caused by 
the spread from an adjacent infectious process. In 
contrast to data from overseas studies, in this study 
spondylitis (spondylodiscitis with disc involvement) 
was found to be the most common aetiology 
of secondary psoas abscess, and no cases were 
deemed related to Crohn’s disease. Spondylitis is an 
infrequently encountered condition and is the main 
manifestation of haematogenous osteomyelitis in 
middle-aged patients (>50 years old), with S aureus
as the predominant pathogen.10 In this study it was 
also found to be the causative organism in two of 
the nine patients with psoas abscess secondary 
to spondylitis or spondylodiscitis; the remaining 
seven cases included two with M tuberculosis, one 
with Escherichia coli, and four with no growth. 
Pyogenic sacroiliitis,11 infection of a kidney,12 and 
aortic infection13 are uncommon aetiologies of psoas 
abscess. Predisposing factors for pyogenic sacroiliitis 
include intravenous drug abuse and trauma. As 
in spondylitis, S aureus is also the most common 
causative organism of pyogenic sacroiliitis.14 Group 
B Streptococcus (S agalactiae) is an important 
pathogen causing neonatal meningitis and sepsis. 
Rare cases of sacroiliitis due to this organism have 
also been reported.15 Mycotic aneurysm is a rare but

potentially life-threatening condition. Most reported 
cases of psoas abscesses related to aortic infection 
were caused by Salmonella infection.13 Transient 
bacteraemia occurs in less than 10% of patients 
with non-typhoid Salmonella infection.16 Salmonella
bacteraemia, which particularly infects structurally 
abnormal vasculatures (eg with atherosclerosis), 
causes necrosis of the intima in a pre-existing 
aneurysm. Elderly patients are therefore particularly 
prone to endovascular infection owing to the higher 
frequency of atherosclerotic disease, with the 
abdominal aorta being the most frequently affected.17
When compared with primary psoas abscesses, 
secondary abscesses are reported to have a higher 
mortality.2
 In this study, however, primary abscess 
was associated with higher mortality. This could 
be explained by the higher frequency of infective 
spondylitis or spondylodiscitis as the underlying 
cause, which is known to have a low mortality 
rate. Nevertheless, patients with secondary psoas 
abscesses had longer hospital stays for the treatment 
of their underlying pathologies. 
Psoas abscesses are frequently missed at initial 
presentation. Most patients in this series presented 
with musculoskeletal (back, hip, or flank) pain, without 
fever; none had the classical triad of fever, back pain, 
and a groin or flank mass. Although enlargement 
and loss of definition of psoas muscle shadow in 
plain radiographs are clues,18 these are insensitive 
features. It has been reported that ultrasonography 
can help make an early diagnosis of a psoas abscess 
in the emergency department. Sonographic clues 
include asymmetrical swelling, focal low density, fluid 
collection, difficulty defining the muscle, and taken

together these attributes warrant further imaging.19
Accurate CT imaging can delineate the pathological 
process in the psoas muscle and clearly demonstrate 
any co-existing causative retro- or intra-peritoneal 
disease. The most common CT feature is a focal 
hypodense lesion within the psoas muscle, though 
a neoplasm or haematoma in the muscle could give 
rise to a similar appearance. Presence of gas within 
the muscle and CT enhancement of the rim of the 
abscess with contrast are more specific features.20
Treatment of a psoas abscess is based on early 
use of appropriate antibiotics in conjunction with 
drainage either percutaneously (guided by imaging) 
or surgically. Ultrasound-guided drainage has the 
advantage of easy availability, avoiding exposure to 
ionising radiation, and real-time monitoring of the 
entire procedure. However, ultrasound guidance 
may be limited by suboptimal image quality due to 
interference from overlying bowel gas, in which case 
CT guidance is preferable. The latter also provides a 
more accurate and safe way en-route to the abscess 
and allows better visualisation of associated pathology 
in nearby structures. Failure and complication rates 
related to CT-guided drainage are very low.21 Surgery 
is indicated for failed percutaneous drainage, multiloculated abscesses or the presence of an underlying 
pathological process warranting definitive surgery. 
Limitations 
This study was a retrospective study and data 
analysis depended on completeness of clinical data 
documentation. The statistical power for the analysis 
of risk factors for mortality was limited by the small 
number of deaths. 
Conclusion 
A psoas abscess is a serious infectious condition and 
usually presents with non-specific symptoms making 
an early diagnosis difficult, for which a high index 
of suspicion and prompt treatment are required. 
The relatively high proportion of secondary psoas 
abscesses and their aetiological profiles differed 
from reported overseas experience.
