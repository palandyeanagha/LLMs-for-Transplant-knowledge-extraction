Abstract Hyponatremia is common in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and is characterized by
excessive renal retention of water relative to sodium due to
reduced solute-free water clearance. The primary cause is
increased release of arginine vasopressin. Hyponatremia is
associated with increased mortality in cirrhotic patients,
those with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on transplant
waiting lists, and, in some studies, posttransplantation
patients. Clinical evidence suggests that adding serum
sodium to model for ESLD (MELD) scoring identifies
patients in greatest need of liver transplantation by
improving waiting list mortality prediction. Hyponatremia
is also associated with numerous complications in liver
disease patients, including severe ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, infectious complications, renal impairment,
increased severity of liver disease in cirrhosis, and
increased hospital stay and neurologic/infectious complications posttransplant. Vasopressin receptor antagonists,
which act to increase free water excretion (aquaresis) and
thereby increase serum sodium concentration, have been
evaluated in patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia
(including cirrhosis and heart failure) and euvolemic
hyponatremia (SIADH). Tolvaptan, a selective vasopressin
V2-receptor antagonist, is the only oral agent in this class
approved for raising sodium levels in hypervolemic and
euvolemic hyponatremia. The SALT trials showed that
tolvaptan treatment rapidly and effectively resolved hyponatremia in these settings, including cirrhosis, and it has been
shown that this agent can be safely and effectively used in
long-term treatment. Fluid restriction should be avoided
during the first 24 h of treatment to prevent overly rapid
correction of hyponatremia, and tolvaptan should not be used
in patients who cannot sense/respond to thirst, anuric
patients, hypovolemic patients, and/or those requiring urgent
intervention to raise serum sodium acutely.

Introduction
Hyponatremia is common in patients with cirrhosis and
portal hypertension and is characterized by excessive renal
retention of water relative to sodium as a result of reduced
solute-free water clearance [1]. Hyponatremia may result
from several factors related to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the most prominent of which is increased release
of arginine vasopressin (AVP; also known as antidiuretic
hormone, or ADH). AVP release in portal hypertension is
thought to occur via baroreceptor-mediated nonosmotic
stimulation caused by a reduction in effective circulating
volume, due in turn to arterial splanchnic vasodilation [1].
Other factors may include: (1) reduced production of solute-free water in association with reduced delivery of
sodium to the distal tubule due to reduced glomerular filtration rate; and (2) increased sodium resorption in the
proximal tubule.
Hyponatremia is associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with cirrhosis [2, 3], and in those on liver
transplantation waiting lists [4]. A number of recent studies
also have shown that hyponatremia is associated with
greater severity of complications of cirrhosis, including
difficult-to-control ascites [5, 6], and greater frequency of
complications posttransplant, including neurologic disorders, renal failure, and infectious complications [7–9].
Conventional treatment of cirrhotic ascites includes
sodium restriction, diuretic therapy, and large-volume
paracentesis [10]. Fluid restriction in combination with
orally administered aldosterone antagonists and loop
diuretics is currently the primary approach to treating
hypervolemic hyponatremia in cirrhosis. In some patients,
these therapies may be ineffective by themselves or inappropriate. In recent years, a number of vasopressin receptor
antagonists, which inhibit the effects of AVP and thereby
increase free water excretion, have been evaluated in
hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis or other causes of
hypervolemic hyponatremia. The oral selective vasopressin
V2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan is approved for treating
hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia, including that
caused by cirrhosis [11, 12]. Experience with this agent is
discussed in the following review.
Consequences of Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis
and End-Stage Liver Disease
Pathogenesis
A disturbance in body water homeostasis is a common feature of advanced cirrhosis [1]. This disturbance, which is
invariably associated with the presence of ascites, is characterized by an inability to adjust the amount of water
excreted in the urine relative to the amount of water ingested.
This leads to water retention and subsequent development of
dilutional hyponatremia. Chronic elevation of AVP, which
regulates both urinary concentration and excretion, can disrupt normal homeostatic correction of this hyponatremia.
AVP interacts with three subtypes of G-coupled receptors:
V1A, V1B, and V2 [10]. The latter receptors, which are found
primarily in renal collecting duct cells, are coupled to
adenylate cyclase, and their activation increases cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This, in turn,
activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates
aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels localized in intracellular vesicles. Following phosphorylation, the vesicles move to
the apical membrane, and the AQP2 channels are inserted
into the membrane, promoting water reabsorption and,
consequently, lowering plasma osmolality. Thus, V2 receptors represent an attractive therapeutic target in cirrhotic
patients with hyponatremia.
Prevalence
Recent data indicate that hyponatremia is present in as
many as half of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension [5]. The Cirrhotic Ascites Patient Population Survey (CAPPS) collected data for 28 consecutive days on 997
patients with cirrhosis and ascites from 28 centers,
including patients attending outpatient clinics as well as
inpatients under the care of hepatologists [5]. Hyponatremia was found in 57 % of inpatients and 40 % of outpatients, including serum sodium levels B 135 mEq/L in
49.4 %, B130 mEq/L in 21.6 %, B125 mEq/L in 5.7 %,
and B120 mEq/L in 1.2 %. In a consecutive series of 126
cirrhotic patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
of a tertiary care center, Jenq et al. [13] found serum
sodium concentrations\135 mEq/L in 53.2 % and
B130 mEq/L in 28.6 %. Kim et al. found hyponatremia
(B135 mEq/L) in 20.8 % of 188 inpatients with cirrhosis
[6]. Shaikh et al. [14] found serum sodium levels B 135 mEq/L in 51.6 % of 217 cirrhotic patients at a
single center.

The reported prevalence of hyponatremia in patients
undergoing liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease
(ESLD) varies. Among 213 consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at one
center, Hackworth et al. [8] found that 42 % developed
hyponatremia (serum sodium B 130 mEq/L) at some point
prior to transplantation, with 16 % remaining persistently
hyponatremic at the time of transplantation. In evaluating
data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for 2005 and 2006, Kim et al. [4] found that hyponatremia (\135 mEq/L) was present in 31 % of nearly 14,000
adults on the liver transplant waiting list. In an analysis of the
NIDDK-LTD (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases Liver Transplantation Database) and
MOLTO (Models for Optimal Liver Transplant Outcomes)
databases, Yun et al. [15] found hyponatremia (serum
sodium B 134 mEq/L) in 31.3 % of 2,175 patients undergoing transplantation. In 241 consecutive patients undergoing transplantation at a single center, London˜o et al. [7] found
hyponatremia (serum sodium \130 mEq/L) at the time of
transplantation in 8 % of patients.
Outcomes in Cirrhotic Patients
The CAPPS survey provided the first large-scale assessment of the clinical correlates of hyponatremia in cirrhotic
patients. In this population of 997 patients, hyponatremia
(serum sodium \135 mEq/L) was associated with severe
ascites, large fluid accumulation rate, requirement for frequent large-volume paracentesis, and impaired renal
function [5]. Although the frequency of complications was
greatest in patients with serum sodium\130 mEq, complications were still more common in those with levels of
130–135 mEq/L than in patients with normonatremia.
Significantly greater risks for hepatic encephalopathy (odds
ratio [OR] 3.40), hepatorenal syndrome (OR 3.45), and
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (OR 2.36) were observed
in patients with serum sodium B 130 mEq/L, and significantly greater risks of hepatic encephalopathy (OR 1.69)
and hepatorenal syndrome (OR 1.75) were observed in
those with serum sodium levels of 131–135 mEq/L compared with normonatremic patients.
In their study of 126 cirrhotic patients in an ICU, Jenq et al.
found that hyponatremia was associated with increased frequency of ascites (OR 4.57, P\.001), hepatic encephalopathy (OR 2.38, P = .027), sepsis (OR 2.08, P = .048), and
renal failure (OR 3.74, P = .001), as well as higher illness
severity scores (based on MELD [model for end-stage liver
disease], SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment],
APACHE II [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II], and APACHE III rankings) [13]. It was also an
independent predictor for both in- and out-of-hospital mortality, with in-hospital (73 vs. 56 %, P = .043) and 6-month
mortality rates being significantly increased in hyponatremic
versus normonatremic patients (Fig. 1). Most patients in this
series had gastrointestinal bleeding, and hyponatremia was
also significantly associated with mortality in this subgroup.
Other recent studies have shown that hyponatremia is an
independent predictor of mortality in patients with ascites
due to portal hypertension [16], and is significantly associated with increased severity of liver disease assessed by
Child-Pugh and MELD scores [6], greater risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic hydrothorax [6], and
risk for hepatic encephalopathy [6, 17, 18].
With respect to hyponatremia and hepatic encephalopathy, there are no specific clinical features linking the two
conditions; however, investigators have hypothesized that
low-grade cerebral edema associated with hyponatremia
may predispose cirrhotic patients to encephalopathy [19]. In
this scenario, hyperammonemia in cirrhotic patients would
lead to increased intracellular glutamine in astrocytes via the
glutamine synthase pathway, raising intracellular osmolality
and resulting in passage of fluid from the extracellular to the
intracellular compartment. The resultant astrocyte swelling
would then cause astrocyte dysfunction, primarily as a result
of increased oxidative stress, thereby facilitating development of hepatic encephalopathy.
Outcomes in Patients Awaiting Transplantation
and Posttransplantation Patients
Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality in
patients on the liver transplant waiting list. Data reported

by Kim et al. [4] on 6,769 registrants in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for 2005 and 2006
indicate that the serum sodium level and MELD score were
significantly associated with mortality, with a hazard ratio
of 1.21 per MELD point and 1.05 per 1-unit decrease in
serum sodium level from 140 to 125 mEq/L (P\.001 for
both). Decreases in serum sodium concentration were
associated with an increased risk of death even after
adjustment for MELD score (Fig. 2). The authors noted
that a significant interaction between MELD score and
serum sodium was observed, and that a revised MELD
score utilizing a combination of the two factors in assigning transplantation priority might have resulted in avoidance of death in a sizable proportion of patients (see below
for further discussion). In 296 patients referred for transplantation, Heuman et al. [20] found that MELD score,
persistent ascites, and serum sodium level \135 mEq/L
were independent predictors of early mortality on multivariate analysis. MELD score was the sole independent
predictor among patients with MELD scores[21, whereas
persistent ascites and low serum sodium were the only
predictors among patients with MELD scores\21; in the
latter group of patients, serum sodium was an independent
predictor whether analyzed as a continuous variable or as a
categorical variable with a cutoff of 135 mEq/L.
In a recent study in the posttransplant setting, Yun et al.
[15] found that serum sodium had no impact on 90-day
survival among 2,175 primary orthotopic liver transplant
recipients. Patients with severe hyponatremia (serum
sodium \125 mEq/L) had longer ICU and hospital stays,
and the incidence of central pontine myelinolysis, although
low, was correlated with serum sodium levels. Hackworth
et al. [8] also found no difference in 180-day mortality rate
among patients with hyponatremia (B130 mEq/L) at
transplant, those with hyponatremia that resolved before
transplant, and normonatremic patients in a retrospective
analysis of 213 transplant recipients. However, patients
with resolved or current hyponatremia had increased time
until discharge (P\0.01), longer ICU stay (P = 0.03),
and higher rates of delirium (P\0.01), acute renal failure
(P\0.01), acute cellular rejection (P = 0.03), and infection excluding sepsis and pneumonia (P = 0.02) than
never-hyponatremic patients, and patients with resolved
hyponatremia were more likely to be discharged at 3 weeks
than those with persistent hyponatremia (P = 0.04). Other
investigators have found an association of hyponatremia
with mortality in the posttransplant setting. Weissmu¨ller
et al. [9] found that a MELD score [30 (OR 4.17), serum
sodium \130 mEq/L (OR 2.07), and pretransplant hemodialysis (OR 2.35) were the main predictors of death
among 462 patients undergoing liver transplantation.
Similarly, in 241 consecutive transplant patients, London˜o
et al. [7] found a significantly lower 3-month survival rate
(84 vs. 95 %, P\0.05) in hyponatremic patients (serum
sodium \130 mEq/L), as well as increased risk for neurologic disorders (OR 4.6), renal failure (OR 3.4), and
infectious complications (OR 2.7). Survival was similar in
hyponatremic and normonatremic patients after 3 months.
In addition, a retrospective study by Boin et al. [21] in 318
consecutive patients undergoing liver transplantation
showed that hyponatremic patients (serum sodium B
130 mEq/L) had significantly reduced survival (P = 0.04).
Fukuhara et al. [22] found that MELD score (P = 0.03)
and hyponatremia (serum sodium B 130 mEq/L;
P = 0.005) were predictive of short-term graft survival,
and hyponatremia was a significant predictor of sepsis
(P\0.001), renal dysfunction (P\0.001), and encephalopathy (P = 0.026) in 134 consecutive patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation.
Addition of Serum Sodium Level to MELD Scoring
Considerable evidence suggests that addition of serum
sodium level to MELD scoring better identifies patients in
greatest need of liver transplantation by improving the
prediction of waiting list mortality. Biggins et al.
[23] developed a new scoring system to adjust MELD
based on serum sodium (MELD-Na score: MELD ? 1.59
(135 - serum sodium) for maximum and minimum
sodium concentrations of 135 and 120 mEq/L, respectively). MELD-Na scores of 20, 30, and 40 were associated
with a 6-month risk of death of 6, 16, and 37 %, respectively. It was estimated this scoring system would alter
allocation of 27 % of grafts to patients who would have
otherwise continued to wait to be transplanted (Fig. 3a).

Similarly, in a study of 266 cirrhotic patients on the liver
transplantation waiting list, MELD plus hyponatremia
(B130 mEq/L) predicted mortality significantly better than
MELD alone (P = 0.006) [24]. Risk of death across all
MELD scores was greater for patients with, versus without
hyponatremia. In their study of patients awaiting transplantation, Kim et al. [4] found a significant difference in
the c-statistic for ranking patients according to risk for
death for a MELD-Na index (MELD - serum sodium -
[0.025 9 MELD 9 (140-sodium)] ? 140, for sodium
level between 125 and 140 mEq/L) versus the standard
MELD index (0.883 vs. 0.868, P\0.001). Comparison of
use of the MELD-Na index and the MELD index among
477 patients who died within 90 days of transplant registration in 2006 showed that scores were similar using the
two indices for 363 patients, and that differences between
scores were sufficiently large for 110 (23 %) such that use
of the MELD-Na score might have altered prioritization for
graft allocation. With use of the MELD-Na score, it was
estimated that 7 % of the deaths during this period might
have been prevented (Fig. 3b).
Clinical Presentation of Hyponatremia
The signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are primarily
related to central nervous system dysfunction due to
movement of water from intravascular spaces into brain
cells, with resultant cerebral edema [25]. Initially, adaptive
mechanisms promote the efflux of electrolytes (sodium,
potassium, chloride) from brain cells, allowing for rapid
adaptation. Subsequently, the extrusion of organic osmolytes (primarily glutamate) promotes adaptation at a slower
pace. Both mechanisms serve to return water to intravascular compartments and limit the swelling of brain tissue
[10]. The rapid adaptations are typically completed in
approximately 48 h. Hyponatremia is classified as acute if
it develops within 48 h or as chronic if it develops over a
period exceeding 48 h [26, 27].
A number of factors determine the clinical presentation
of hyponatremia, including the rate, extent, and overall
timing of serum sodium decreases. The majority of patients
with serum sodium levels greater than 125 mEq/L are
asymptomatic as a result of the brain’s adaptive mechanisms; neurologic symptoms are more common when
serum sodium falls below this value [25]. Rapid serum
sodium decreases to 125–130 mEq/L in patients who had
previously been asymptomatic may also produce symptoms. Symptoms commonly associated with hyponatremia
include headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, muscle
cramps, lethargy, restlessness, irritability, and disorientation, and are typically nonspecific. Rapid declines in serum
sodium, which can overwhelm the brain’s adaptive mechanisms, or decreases to B120 mEq/L may produce more
serious complications, including seizures, permanent brain
damage, coma, brain stem herniation, respiratory arrest,
and death [10, 25]. Low serum sodium levels, even in the
absence of accompanying symptoms, raise the risk for
development of more severe, symptomatic hyponatremia
[28].

Management of Hypervolemic Hyponatremia
in Cirrhosis/ESLD
Symptomatic Hyponatremia
Patients with acute hyponatremia (hyponatremia that
develops in B48 h) are at risk for developing neurologic
impairment and, consequently, require prompt correction
of serum sodium levels; this is typically accomplished via
administration of a hypertonic (3 %) saline infusion. It
should be noted that there have been no dedicated studies
to assess the effectiveness of this strategy, which potentially raises the risk of ascites and edema. In patients with
chronic hyponatremia (hyponatremia that develops over a
period [48 h), the benefits of correction should be
weighed against the risk of developing osmotic demyelination, a process associated with too-rapid normalization of
serum sodium. Thus, serum sodium correction should be
performed in a controlled manner.
The adaptive mechanisms that control brain swelling
during development of chronic hyponatremia (onset in
[48 h) can also make the brain susceptible to injury in
response to overly rapid increases in serum sodium [10].
As serum sodium increases, the brain recaptures lost
osmolytes, but at a slower rate than they were lost during
the development of hyponatremia. When serum sodium is
raised too rapidly, water may move from brain cells into
the intravascular spaces, leading to cell shrinkage, and,
ultimately, to osmotic demyelination. Although the specific
mechanism has not yet been elucidated, investigators have
suggested that myelin-producing oligodendrocytes may be
more vulnerable to shrinkage than other types of brain
cells, or that they may be preferentially damaged by
inflammatory cells and mediators entering the brain after
the blood–brain barrier is disrupted by shrinkage of vascular endothelial cells [29]. Thus, symptomatic patients
may improve at first with rapid correction of serum sodium
[30]; over the subsequent days, however, progressive
neurologic deficits may emerge, and some of these may be
permanent.
To avoid osmotic demyelination, serum sodium should
be corrected in a controlled fashion: \10–12 mEq/L in
24 h and \18 mEq/L in 48 h [10, 30, 31]. For patients
particularly susceptible to osmotic demyelination (e.g.,
those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism, or advanced
liver disease), a slower rate of correction should be used.
Because the brain’s adaptive mechanisms typically take
48 h to manifest, they are often incomplete in patients with
acute (\48 h) onset of hyponatremia [32]. As a result,
rapid correction of serum sodium is less likely to cause
osmotic demyelination in these patients. When the timing
of hyponatremia onset is unclear, it is prudent to assume
chronic onset and avoid overly rapid elevations in serum
sodium.
Asymptomatic Hyponatremia
Currently, there are no specific guidelines for the treatment
of asymptomatic hyponatremia in cirrhosis. A general
algorithm for the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia is presented in Fig. 4. As noted previously, fluid
restriction in combination with orally administered aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics is currently the primary approach to treating hypervolemic hyponatremia in
cirrhosis. Fluid restriction typically produces only transient
benefits, however, as restriction to 500 mL is generally
required for benefits to be maintained [33]. In patients
resistant to fluid restriction/diuretic therapy, pharmacologic
agents such as demeclocycline—which is relatively contraindicated due to a high incidence of nephrotoxicity—and
the vasopressin receptor antagonist tolvaptan (profiled
below) may be tried. Two small studies have also suggested that the administration of albumin, which aids the
expansion of plasma volume, may improve serum sodium
concentration in patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia
[34, 35]; however, these data must be replicated in larger
studies.
Conventional therapy for treatment of ascites due to
portal hypertension includes sodium restriction, diuretic
therapy, and large-volume paracentesis [10]. The most
effective diuretic combination consists of an aldosterone
antagonist with potassium-sparing properties (e.g., spironolactone) plus a loop diuretic. Approximately 5–10 % of
ascites cases are diuretic-resistant or diuretic-intractable,
however, which portends a poor prognosis. The next step is
pharmacologic treatment with a vasopressin receptor
antagonist.
Vasopressin Receptor Antagonists
Since AVP release is a primary cause of hyponatremia in
cirrhosis, several vasopressin receptor antagonists have
been evaluated in treating hyponatremia in patients with
cirrhosis/ESLD and other conditions characterized by
hypervolemic hyponatremia (e.g., heart failure) or euvolemic hyponatremia (e.g., the syndrome of inappropriate
secretion of antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]). These include
the intravenous dual V1A/V2-receptor antagonist conivaptan, and the oral V2-receptor antagonists lixivaptan (VPA985), satavaptan, and tolvaptan. Currently, only conivaptan
(described directly below) and tolvaptan (described in the
following section) are approved for increasing serum
sodium in patients with hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia in the United States.
Dig Dis Sci (2012) 57:2774–2785 2779
123

Conivaptan is administered via an intravenous loading
dose of 20 mg followed by continuous infusion of 20 mg/
day for 2–4 days (if serum sodium does not rise at the
desired rate, it may be titrated upward to 40 mg over 24 h).
In patients with Child-Pugh class A–C hepatic impairment,
the recommended loading dose is 10 mg followed by a
continuous infusion of 10 mg over 24 h for 2 to a
maximum of 4 days (with titration up to 20 mg over 24 h if
serum sodium is not rising at the desired rate) [36]. In a
randomized, double-blind trial in 84 hospitalized patients
with hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia, conivaptan
given as a 20-mg loading dose followed by a 96-h infusion
of 40 or 80 mg/day significantly improved serum sodium
levels compared with placebo, with efficacy evident after

the first day of treatment. Area under the serum sodium
concentration-time curve was significantly increased with
both conivaptan doses versus placebo over 4 days
(P\0.0001 for both), and least-squares mean increases in
serum sodium were 6.3 and 9.4 mEq/L versus 0.8 mEq/L
with placebo. Conivaptan was generally well tolerated;
four patients had to discontinue treatment due to injection
site reactions [37]. A retrospective review of 24 cirrhotic
patients with hyponatremia showed that conivaptan raised
serum sodium in patients receiving or not receiving
diuretics [38]. Because conivaptan is available only as a
parenteral formulation, chronic use in cirrhotic patients
with hyponatremia may be limited. Theoretically, it may
not be advisable to use conivaptan in patients with cirrhosis
because of the possibility that V1A inhibition may result in
splanchnic vasodilation [39]. The estimated cost of conivaptan (average wholesale price) is $573/day [40].
Lixivaptan (VPA-985) was shown to increase urine output, decrease urine osmolality, and increase serum osmolality and serum sodium in a dose-ascending single-dose
study in patients with cirrhotic ascites [41], and to produce
significant dose-related increases in water clearance and
serum sodium in 44 hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis,
heart failure, or SIADH [42]. In a randomized, double-blind
trial in 60 hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis, lixivaptan
100 and 200 mg/day resulted in normalization of serum
sodium (C136 mEq/L) in 27 and 50 % of patients, respectively, compared with 0 % for placebo (P\0.05 and
P\0.001, respectively), and also yielded significant
reductions in urine osmolality and body weight [43].
Phase II trials of satavaptan suggested efficacy in controlling ascites in cirrhotic patients [44, 45]. However, in
three randomized, double-blind phase III trials involving
1,200 patients with ascites, satavaptan was not shown to be
more effective than placebo with respect to the primary
endpoints (worsening of ascites in one study and cumulative
number of paracenteses in the other two). In addition, while
mortality rates for satavaptan and placebo were comparable
in two of the studies, the third study reported a significant
increase in mortality with satavaptan versus placebo (29.4
vs. 21.7 %, respectively; HR 1.47; 95 % CI 1.01–2.15;
P = .049) [46]. Due to limited efficacy in treating the
underlying causes and observable symptoms of hyponatremia, as well as accompanying safety concerns, the manufacturer discontinued development of this agent in 2008.
Tolvaptan in Hypervolemic or Euvolemic
Hyponatremia
Tolvaptan is an oral, selective vasopressin V2-receptor
antagonist that blocks the effects of AVP, thus increasing
free water excretion (aquaresis) and serum sodium
concentration. Unlike diuretics, tolvaptan does not significantly affect urinary sodium or potassium excretion. It is
currently indicated in the United States for treatment of
clinically significant hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium\125 mEq/L) or less-marked
hyponatremia that is symptomatic and resistant to correction by fluid restriction, including treatment of patients
with cirrhosis, heart failure, or SIADH [11].
In an initial study, tolvaptan was shown to be more
effective than fluid restriction in increasing serum sodium
in 28 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium\135 mEq/L; tolvaptan, n = 17;
fluid restriction, n = 11) [47]. Changes in serum sodium
concentrations were ?1.6 versus -0.8 mEq/L (P = 0.016)
for tolvaptan versus fluid restriction, respectively, at 1 h
after the first dose, ?5.2 versus ?0.7 mEq/L after 5 days
(P = 0.019), and ?5.7 versus ?1.0 at the last visit (maximum, 27 days of treatment; P = 0.0065). In a study in 18
Japanese patients with intractable ascites or lower limb
edema, in which hyponatremia (\120 mEq/L) was an
exclusion criterion, tolvaptan doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg/
day for 3 days dose-dependently decreased body weight
and abdominal circumference and improved ascites and
edema [48]. Mean changes in body weight after 3 days
were -1.6, -2.6, and -3.4 kg for tolvaptan 15, 30, and
60 mg/day, respectively, and changes in abdominal circumference ranged from -2.8 to -6.0 cm. Urine osmolality was markedly decreased and remained decreased
until the end of the study.
Tolvaptan was found to reverse euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium\135 mEq/L) in
the Study of Ascending Levels of Tolvaptan in Hyponatremia (SALT)-1 and SALT-2 trials. In these two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials
of similar design [12], a total of 448 patients were randomized to tolvaptan (n = 225; 15 mg once daily on day 1,
increased at 1-day intervals to 30 and 60 mg/day if necessary during the first 4 days) or placebo (n = 223) in
addition to standard therapy for 30 days. In total, 120
patients (27 %) had cirrhosis, 138 (31 %) had heart failure,
and 190 (42 %) had SIADH or other causes of hyponatremia. Fluid restriction was avoided during the first 24 h
of treatment to prevent overly rapid correction of serum
sodium; 87 % of patients had no fluid restriction during
this period [11]. Thereafter, fluid was restricted as clinically indicated (intake B 1.5 L daily). Tolvaptan treatment
resulted in a significantly greater increase in serum sodium
at both time points (day 4 and 30) in both studies
(P\0.0001 for all comparisons). Pooled results for all
patients showed changes in average daily serum sodium
AUC of 4.0 for tolvaptan versus 0.4 mEq/L for placebo at
day 4 and 6.2 versus 1.8 mEq/L at day 30 (both
P\0.0001) [11]. Overall, 14 % of tolvaptan versus 25 %
Dig Dis Sci (2012) 57:2774–2785 2781
123

of placebo patients (P\0.01) required fluid restriction. A
significantly greater increase in serum sodium was
observed with tolvaptan treatment as early as 8 h after the
first dose. Significant reductions in serum sodium at days 4
and 30 were also reported for patient subgroups with
baseline sodium\130 mEq/L and \125 mEq/L (both
P\0.0001). During a 7-day follow-up after stopping
study treatment, serum sodium concentrations in the tolvaptan group decreased to levels similar to those in the
placebo group.
The SALT trials included 63 tolvaptan-treated patients
and 57 placebo patients with cirrhosis [49]. The mean age
for these patients (52 and 55 years, respectively) was
younger than that for patients with heart failure or SIADH/
other conditions (67 and 63, respectively) (data on file,
Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., Rockville, MD). At
baseline, 44 % had mild hyponatremia (serum sodium
130–134 mEq/L), 56 % had marked hyponatremia (serum
sodium \130 mEq/L), 85 % had cirrhosis due to alcohol
and/or hepatitis B/C, and 80 % were Child-Pugh class B/C.
Changes in average daily serum sodium AUC for the
SALT patients with cirrhosis were 3.5 mEq/L for tolvaptan
versus 0.3 mEq/L for placebo at day 4 and 4.2 mEq/L
versus 1.2 mEq/L at day 30 (both P\0.0001). Patients
receiving tolvaptan had significantly greater increases in
serum sodium (P\0.05) as early as 8 h after the first dose
and at days 2, 3, 4, 11, 18, and 25 (Fig. 5). The proportion
of patients with normalized serum sodium was significantly
greater with tolvaptan at day 4 (41 vs. 11 %, P = 0.0002)
and numerically greater at day 30 (33 vs. 19 %, P = 0.08).
Mean mental component summary scores of the Medical
Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-12) improved from baseline to day 30 in the
tolvaptan group but not the placebo group (4.68 vs. 0.08,
P = 0.02). Before the study began, 98 % of the tolvaptan
group were taking diuretics (with the majority on a moderate dose: spironolactone \200 mg/day or furosemide \80 mg/day); only 6 % discontinued diuretic use
during the trials. Diuretic use did not appear to have an
impact on treatment with tolvaptan [49]; however, the data
from this limited analysis need to be confirmed in larger
clinical trials.
In the open-label SALTWATER study, 111 patients (94
with serum sodium \135 mEq/L) who had previously
received tolvaptan or placebo in the SALT trials were
treated with tolvaptan after having returned to standard
care for at least 7 days. Average serum sodium levels in
these patients increased to approximately the same levels
as those observed with tolvaptan treatment in the SALT
trials and were maintained for at least 1 year [11, 50].
Adverse events in the SALT trials were generally similar in the tolvaptan and placebo groups [12]. The most
common adverse events in tolvaptan patients were thirst
(14 % with tolvaptan vs. 5 % with placebo) and dry mouth
(13 vs. 4 %, respectively). Desirable rates of sodium correction ([0.5 mEq/L/h) were exceeded in 1.8 % of 223
tolvaptan patients during the 24 h after the first dose. The
range of desirable increase was exceeded ([146 mEq/L) in
4 (1.8 %) of the tolvaptan patients.
In the analysis of cirrhotic patients in the SALT trials,
gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in six out of 63
(10 %) tolvaptan-treated patients and one out of 57 (2 %)
placebo-treated patients (P = 0.11) [49]. Among the tolvaptan recipients, five had evidence of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and concomitant esophageal varices and
one had a self-limited episode of bright red blood per

rectum that was attributed to hemorrhoids. The placebo
patient had a gingival hemorrhage and concomitant
esophageal varices that were not considered to be the cause
of bleeding. The investigators suggested that these events
were likely related to portal hypertension and esophageal
varices, but that this could not be established based on the
event descriptions, and noted that thus far there are no
known mechanisms by which tolvaptan would increase the
risk for variceal bleeding. The overall safety of tolvaptan in
patients with cirrhosis remains to be confirmed in larger,
prospective, placebo-controlled trials. Tolvaptan should be
used in cirrhotic patients only when the need to treat outweighs the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Use of Tolvaptan in Patients with Cirrhosis/ESLD
Tolvaptan is indicated for the treatment of clinically significant hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia characterized by serum sodium \125 mEq/L or by less-marked
symptomatic hyponatremia that has resisted correction
with fluid restriction [11]. Tolvaptan is contraindicated in
patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, in those unable
to sense or respond appropriately to thirst, in those who
require an urgent increase in serum sodium to prevent or
treat serious neurologic symptoms, in anuric patients, and
in patients taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 isoenzymes.
Tolvaptan should be used only when the need to treat
outweighs the risk, especially given that data are currently
available for short-term treatment only.
It is recommended that tolvaptan therapy be initiated
(and re-initiated) in the hospital setting, with frequent
monitoring of the patient’s serum sodium level to ensure
that overly rapid correction does not occur. Based on the
pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan, serum sodium should be
monitored within the first 8–12 h following initiation, and
then every 24 h thereafter. We recommend the dosing
paradigm used in the SALT trials, beginning with 15 mg
once daily, and increasing the dose at 24-h intervals to
30 mg once daily and then to 60 mg once daily if serum
sodium is not raised to the desired level [12]. No adjustments are necessary based on age, gender, race, cardiac
function, hepatic function, or renal function (providing
creatinine clearance is C10 mL/min). Tolvaptan may be
taken without regard to the timing of meals. Fluid restriction should be avoided during the first 24 h of treatment to
prevent overly rapid correction of serum sodium, and
patients should be advised to drink if they are thirsty. Once
tolvaptan therapy is completed, fluid restriction or other
therapies can be resumed, and changes in serum sodium
and volume status should be monitored.
If hyponatremia recurs after tolvaptan therapy has been
stopped, tolvaptan can be re-started in a hospital setting;
readmission may not be necessary (i.e., a step-down unit
may be utilized), provided adequate provisions are made to
monitor treatment responses and prevent overly rapid
correction of serum sodium levels. Among patients previously enrolled in the SALT trials, re-treatment with tolvaptan raised serum sodium to levels similar to those
achieved during initial therapy, and levels were maintained
during long-term daily treatment [50]. The estimated cost
of tolvaptan (average wholesale price) is $300/day [40].
Conclusions
Hyponatremia is common in patients with cirrhosis and
ESLD and is associated with increased risk of morbidity
and mortality. Mortality is significant in patients on liver
transplant waiting lists and correlates with hyponatremia.
Adjusting MELD scoring for hyponatremia improves the
prediction of mortality in waiting list patients and may
result in more appropriate allocation of grafts.
The selective oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist
tolvaptan acts to increase free water excretion and is
effective in resolving hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis and in others with hypervolemic or euvolemic
hyponatremia. Tolvaptan and other vasopressin antagonists
have the potential to improve outcomes in these patient
populations.
