ABSTRACT
Background and Objective: To compare the survival outcomes of patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) who 
received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) before or after intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT).
Methods: During the study period, the survival outcomes of HCC patients with 
PVTT who underwent TACE before (TACE-RT) or after IMRT (RT-TACE) were compared. 
Using propensity score matching (PSM), matched pairs of patients were compared.
Results: There were 76 patients in the TACE-RT group and 36 patients in the RTTACE group. Using a 2:1 matching, 75 patients were included into this study after PSM: 
50 patients in the TACE-RT group and 25 patients in the RT-TACE group. Before PSM, 
patients in the RT-TACE group showed significantly better survival when compared 
with the TACE-RT group (median survival, 13.2 months vs.7.4 months; P = 0.014) for 
patients with main trunk PVTT, and after PSM, the corresponding median survival was 
13.2 months vs.7.4 months (P = 0.020). When compared with TACE-RT, RT-TACE had 
a significantly lower rate of worsening in liver function (9.5% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.044) 
for patients with main trunk PVTT.
Conclusions: For HCC patients with main trunk PVTT, IMRT followed by TACE yielded 
better survival outcomes and liver function when compared to TACE followed by IMRT.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most 
common cancer and the second most common cause of 
cancer-related mortality [1]. Portal vein tumor thrombus 
(PVTT) is a poor prognostic factor of survival as it leads 
to portal hypertension, tumor spread, liver failure and 
death [2]. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
group recommended sorafenib as the standard therapy for 
these patients [3, 4]. In Asian countries, liver resection has 
been proposed as an option that offers a chance of cure if 
the lesion is resectable [5, 6]. The optimal treatment for 
patients with HCC and PVTT remains controversial.
Recently, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
has become the most popular palliative treatment 
for patients with unresectable HCC and is no longer

considered as an absolute contraindication to patients 
with HCC with PVTT [7, 8]. Advanced radiotherapies 
(RT) including three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 
(3D-CRT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), have produced 
promising results in HCC patients with PVTT [9-11]. The 
combination of TACE and radiotherapy for HCC patients 
with PVTT significantly improved survival outcomes 
when compared with TACE or radiotherapy alone [12-
19]. While most of these studies used TACE followed by 
RT, some applied RT before TACE [17]. In this study, the 
survival outcomes and adverse events of a cohort of HCC 
patients with different extent of PVTT underwent TACE 
either before or after IMRT were compared. In addition, 
a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was done 
to minimize potential bias inherent to this retrospective, 
nonrandomized study. Independent prognostic factors 
associated with survival were also investigated.
RESULTS
Study population
Of 164 patients with unresectable HCC with PVTT 
who underwent combined TACE and IMRT during the 
study period, 52 patients were excluded because they 
met the exclusion criteria. Thus, 112 patients (the TACERT group, n=76; and the RT-TACE group, n=36) were 
included in this study. Of these, 75 patients with HCC with 
PVTT (the TACE-RT group, n=50; the RT-TACE group, 
n=25) were selected in the propensity score analysis 
(Figure 1).
The two groups showed no significant difference in 
all the baseline characteristics, which included age, sex, 
Child-Pugh score, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBsAg positivity, ascites, 
AFP level, tumor number, maximum lesion diameter, and 
extent of PVTT before and after propensity score matching 
(Table 1).
The median follow-up was 11 months (range, 2-48 
months) for the TACE-RT group and 14 months (range, 
2-55 months) for the RT-TACE group. Collectively, all of 
the patients in the RT-TACE and TACE-RT group died 
during the study period. Thirty-eight (50.0%) of the 76 
patients in the TACE-RT group and 25 (69.4%) of the 
36 patients in the RT-TACE group underwent repeated 
TACE, with a mean of 1.9 (range, 1–9) and 3.1 (range, 
1–12) TACE procedures per patient in the two groups of 
patients, respectively.
Tumor and PVTT response
The tumor and PVTT responses in patients with 
different extents of PVTT are shown in Table 2. For the 
liver tumors, the response rates for all patients were not 
significantly different between the TACE-RT and RTTACE groups (59.2% vs. 72.2%, P = 0.182). On subgroup 
analysis, the response rate of the patients with main portal 
vein trunk tumor thrombus (main trunk-PVTT, MTPVTT) in the RT-TACE group was 81.0%, which was 
significantly higher than the 50.0% in the TACE-RT group 
(P = 0.021). However, in patients without main portal 
vein trunk tumor thrombus (non-main trunk-PVTT, nMTPVTT), the response rates between the two groups were 
not significantly different (67.5% in the TACE-RT group 
vs. 60.0% in the RT-TACE group, P = 0.602).
For PVTT, the response rates of all patients were 
not significantly different between the TACE-RT and 
RT-TACE groups (61.8% vs. 77.8%, P = 0.094). On 
subgroup analysis, the response rate of patients with 
MT-PVTT in the RT-TACE group was 85.7%, which 
was significantly higher than the 50% rate in the TACERT group (P = 0.007). However, in patients with nMTPVTT, the response rates between the two groups were not 
significantly different (72.5% in the TACE-RT group vs. 
66.7% in the RT-TACE group, P = 0.928).
Survival analysis of whole population with 
different extents of PVTT
The overall survival (OS) was similar between 
the TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups in all patients (P = 
0.053; Figure 2A). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 
38.2%, 18.4%, and 9.2% vs. 61.1%, 27.8%, and 16.7%, 
for the TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups, respectively. On 
subgroup analysis of OS in patients with different extents 
of PVTT, the TACE-RT group had similar OS as the RTTACE group in patients with nMT-PVTT, (P = 0.867; 
Figure 3A). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 50.0%, 
25.0%, and 10.0% vs. 66.7%, 26.7%, and 13.3%, for the 
TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups, respectively. In patients 
with MT-PVTT, the RT-TACE group had significantly 
better OS than the TACE-RT group (P = 0.014; Figure 
3C). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 25.0%, 11.1%, 
and 8.3% vs. 57.1%, 28.6%, and 19.0%, for the TACE-RT 
and RT-TACE groups, respectively.
Survival analysis of patients selected in the 
propensity score analysis with different extents 
of PVTT
For all patients selected in propensity score matching, 
the RT-TACE group had better OS than that of the TACERT group (P = 0.043; Figure 2B). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year 
OS rates were 30.0%, 10.0%, and 6.0% vs. 60.0%, 28.0%, 
and 16.0%, for the TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups, 
respectively. On subgroup analysis of OS in patients with 
different extents of PVTT, for patients with nMT-PVTT, the 
TACE-RT group had similar OS as the RT-TACE group (P
= 0.678; Figure 3B). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 
45.0%, 20.0%, and 10.0% vs. 60.0%, 30.0%, and 20.0%, 
for the TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups, respectively. 

www.oncotarget.com 24539 Oncotarget
In patients with MT-PVTT, the RT-TACE group had 
significantly better OS than the TACE-RT group (P = 
0.020; Figure 3D). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 
20.0%, 3.3%, and 3.3% vs. 60.0%, 26.7%, and 13.3%, for 
the TACE-RT and RT-TACE groups, respectively.
Factors associated with overall survival
On univariable analysis for OS before PSM, maximum 
lesion diameter > 5 cm was associated with decreased 
long-term survival rates (P = 0.008, Table 3). In the Cox 
proportional hazards model, one independent prognostic 
predictor of poor survival was a maximum lesion diameter > 
5 cm (HR: 2.004, 95% CI: 1.183-3.396, P =0.010).
On univariable analysis of OS for patients after PSM, 
maximum lesion diameter > 5 cm, TACE-RT treatment, and 
ALT > 40 U/L were associated with a decreased survival 
(all P < 0.05). In the Cox proportional hazards model, no 
independent prognostic predictor was identified (Table 3).
Adverse events
Table 4 shows the adverse events profile. During 
the period and between 1 and 3 months after treatment, 
worsening of liver function was observed in 22.4% 
(17/76) and 11.1% (4/36) of the patients in the TACERT and RT-TACE groups. The rate of liver function 
worsening in the TACE-RT group was higher when 
compared with the RT-TACE group, but there was no 
significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.154). 
On subgroup analysis of adverse events in the patients 
with different extents of PVTT, for patients with nMTPVTT, the rates of liver function worsening were similar 
between the two groups (12.5% vs. 13.3%, P = 1.000). 
For patients with MT-PVTT, the rate of liver function 
worsening in the TACE-RT group was significantly higher 
than the RT-TACE group (33.3% vs. 9.5%, P = 0.044). 
Fever, gastrointestinal disorders, and acute bone marrow 
suppression were observed in 14.5% (11/76), 25.0% 
(19/76), and 25.0% (19/76), respectively, in patients in 
the TACE-RT group, and 13.9% (5/36), 22.2% (8/36), and 
27.7% (10/36), respectively, in patients in the RT-TACE 
group. There were no significant differences between the 
two groups for these adverse events (P = 0.934, 0.748, 
and 0.754, respectively). All the disorders returned to 
baseline values within 3 weeks. No patients required 
discontinuation in treatment because of serious adverse 
reactions.

DISCUSSION
Accumulating evidences suggest that combined of 
TACE and RT is safe and effective to treat patients with 
unresctable HCC with PVTT [12-19]. Unfortunately, 
there are little data to suggest whether TACE should be 
given before or after external radiotherapy. Kang J et al 
[17] reported that there were no significant differences 
in response rate, survival rate, and α-fetoprotein level 
normalization rate between the SBRT-TACE group and the 
TACE-SBRT group. However, the latter regimen exerted 
a more severe negative effect on liver function when 
compared with the former one. For the whole population, 
our study showed similar results as reported by Kang J 
et al. On subgroup analysis using the extent of PVTT, 
for the first time our study showed that IMRT followed 
by TACE provided better survival outcomes and lower 
rates of worsening of liver function when compared with 
TACE followed by IMRT in HCC patients with main trunk 
PVTT. Using propensity score matching analysis which

reduced selection biases and increased reliability of the 
study, this study also substantiated the above observations.
When PVTT extends to the main portal vein, 
the prognosis is extremely bad because (1) shedding of 
HCC cells leads to extensive intra-hepatic metastases; 
(2) complete obstruction of the main portal vein causes 
further deterioration in liver function. In a recent review 
article on the role of radiotherapy as a treatment modality 
for patients with HCC and PVTT, main PVTT serves as a 
main obstacle to liver function maintenance and a source 
of metastasis, and IMRT can be an effective treatment for 
main PVTT [20]; (3) aggravation of portal hypertension 
results in intractable ascites and esophageal bleeding 
[21]. Many HCC patients with main trunk PVTT die of 
esophageal bleeding or liver failure caused by obstruction 
of the main portal vein, rather than from the liver tumor. 
The placement of a portal vein stent in patients with HCC 
with main PVTT to keep the main portal vein patent has 
been shown to play a prominent role in improving hepatic 
function, in preventing liver failure and variceal bleeding 
due to portal hypertension [22]. Thus, timely radiotherapy 
to control PVTT may be beneficial for these patients.

For patients with main trunk PVTT, TACE before 
IMRT can lead to hepatic ischemia and cellular damage, 
which can worsen liver function, reduce some effects of 
IMRT as tumor hypoxia caused by TACE, and enhance 
radioresistance in HCC [23]. On the other hand, IMRT 
before TACE can shrink the PVTT. Subsequently increased 
blood flow through the main portal vein can reduce the 
negative embolic effects of TACE, and the worsening effects 
on liver function caused by the combined treatment. Liver 
function is recognized to be an independent prognostic factor 
of survival of HCC patients with PVTT [24, 25]. These may 
help to explain why IMRT followed by TACE resulted in 
less worsening of liver function and significantly better 
survival outcomes for HCC patients with main trunk PVTT 
when compared with TACE followed by IMRT.
Our study had limitations. First, this is a retrospective 
study carried out in a single-center which have potential 
selection biases. However, we attempted to use propensity 
score matching analysis to overcome this limitation. Second, 
the aetiology of patients with HCC and PVTT in our study 
is mainly due to chronic hepatitis B. The results of this 
study may not be applied to HCC due to other aetiologies. 
Finally, a prospective randomized trial with considerable 
population is necessary to confirm our findings.
In conclusion, for HCC patients with main trunk 
PVTT, IMRT followed by TACE produced better survival 
outcomes and caused less worsening of liver function than 
TACE followed by IMRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital of the Second 
Military Medical University (Shanghai, China). Written 
informed consent was obtained from all the patients for 
their data to be used for clinical research.
Between January 2004 and December 2013, all 
consecutive patients with unresectable HCC with PVTT 
who were treated by combined TACE and IMRT at the 
Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital of the Second 
Military Medical University (Shanghai, China) were 
retrospectively studied. The inclusion criteria were: (a) age 
between 18 and 75 years, (b) HCC with major portal vein 
invasion, (c) the tumor was considered to be unresectable 
by two senior hepatic surgeons, (d) Child-Pugh A or B liver 
function. The exclusion criteria were: (a) Child-Pugh C 
liver function, (b) extra-hepatic metastasis, (c) previously 
treated by hepatic resection (HR), radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA), sorafenib or systemic chemotherapy, (d) serious 
associated medical diseases.
HCC was diagnosed according to the non-invasive 
criteria of the European Association for the Study of Liver/
American Association Guidelines [26]. The presence and 
extent of PVTT were assessed on multiphase dynamic 
CT scans using the following criteria: a low-attenuation

intraluminal mass which expanded the portal vein or as 
filling defects in the main portal vein trunk, portal venous 
branches, or both. The patients were divided into two 
subgroups according to whether the tumor thrombus had 
extended to the main portal vein trunk: Subgroup 1, extent 
of PVTT not involving the main portal vein (Cheng’s 
classification I and II; Japanese Classification vP1 to 
vP3); and Subgroup 2, PVTT had extended to the main 
portal vein (Cheng’s classification III and IV; Japanese 
Classification vP4) [27].
The treatment decision was made by our multidisciplinary team that the patients were suitable for 
treatment with either TACE before (TACE-RT) or after 
IMRT (RT-TACE). Patients were considered to be suitable 
for TACE only if they had good liver function and there 
were adequate venous collaterals around the blocked main 
portal veins [28, 29]. The final decision on the treatment 
was made by the patient after full explanation was given 
to the patient.
The TACE procedure
Using the Seldinger technique, a vascular catheter 
was inserted through a femoral artery to the hepatic artery. 
After hepatic angiography, the catheter was selectively 
inserted into the tumor-feeding artery whenever 
technically possible. An emulsion of 5-fluorouracil (1 g), 
mitomycin C (20 mg), cisplatin (5 mg), and lipiodol 10 to 
30 ml (1 to 2 ml/cm diameter of the tumor) was injected. 
Gelfoam fragments were then injected to embolise the 
tumor-feeding vessel. The treatment was repeated at 6 to 
8 weeks intervals until complete disappearance of viable 
intrahepatic tumor, provided that hepatic function was 
preserved.
Radiotherapy procedure
IMRT was used for radiotherapy. The patient was 
scanned during the arterial phase and portal phase, from 
carina to the fifth lumbar vertebra with a thickness slice 
of 5.0 mm. The images and related data were delivered to 
the treatment plan system (TPS). The PVTT was outlined 
as a clinical target volume (CTV), and the plan target 
volume (PTV) was expanded 1.0 cm in the XY axis, and 
0.5 cm in the Z axis (head direction). The prescribed doses 
to the initial PTV ranged from 50 to 67 Gy (median 58 
Gy), given in daily doses of 2.0-2.2 Gy. The biologically 
effective dose (BED) ranged from 61.0 Gy to 82.5 Gy 
(median 68.2 Gy, α/β=10). A dose volume histogram 
(DVH) was used for dose optimization, with 90% of the 
dose curve being completely covered by the PTV. The 
internal dose to the PVTT was uniform, and the dose 
change was never more than 5%. The radiation doses to 
the organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and the spinal 
cord were all acceptably low and the dose limit of a high 
dose was never more than 10%.
Combination treatment process
All patients received treatment within 1 week of 
diagnosis of HCC with PVTT. The group assignment 
was: for group TACE-RT, 76 patients were treated with 
TACE followed by IMRT within the next 2-4 weeks, 
and for group RT-TACE, 36 patients were treated with 
IMRT followed by TACE within the next 2-4 weeks, 
depending on recovery of liver function. Patients with a 
high viral load (≥ 104 copies/ml) of HBV-DNA were given 
nucleotide/nucleoside analog (NA) treatment [30].
Evaluation
All patients were followed-up by the same 
multidisciplinary team after treatment. This study was 
censored on June 30, 2017. The baseline characteristics of 
the two groups were compared before and after propensity 
score matched analysis. The short-term therapeutic effects 
on liver tumors and PVTT were evaluated separately 
according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [31, 32] within 1 month 
after treatment. A complete response (CR) was defined 
as disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement 
in all target lesions; a partial response (PR) was at least 
30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (contrast 
enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of the 
target lesions; a progressive disease (PD) was an increase 
of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions 
recorded since treatment started; a stable disease (SD) was 
any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or 
progressive disease. The response rate (RR) was estimated 
based on the combined number of patients with CR and 
PR. In addition to the size of the PVTT, other factors like 
recanalization of any part of the blocked portal vein were 
also taken into consideration.
For long-term survival outcomes, OS was compared 
between the two groups before and after propensity 
score matched analysis. OS was measured from the date 
of first treatment (either TACE or IMRT) to the date of 
death or the last follow-up. The prognostic factors for 
overall survival were explored using univariable and 
multivariable analyses before and after propensity score 
matched analysis. A subgroup analysis was performed on 
patients with different extents of PVTT.
The adverse events were evaluated according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE; version3.0) [33].
Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
20.0 (IBM, New York, NY). Continuous variables were 
expressed as mean ± sd or median (interquartile range) as 

www.oncotarget.com 24546 Oncotarget
appropriate. Categorical variables were compared by the χ2
test or the Fisher exact test, and continuous variables by the 
student’s t test or the non-parametric test. Overall survival 
curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and compared with the log-rank test. Univariable analyses 
were performed with the log-rank test. Variables with a 
P value of < 0.05 were then entered into a multivariable 
analysis. Multivariable analyses were performed with a 
Cox proportional hazard regression model.
To investigate the association between treatment 
and outcomes in an observational database rather than in a 
randomized, controlled trial, a propensity score matching 
analysis was used in an attempt to reduce biases in patient 
selection. The R version 2.12.1 (The R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing) and the MatchIt package were 
used to produce the propensity score graphs. PSM was 
performed via binary logistic regression to generate 
a propensity score for each patient. The co-variables 
entered into the model included age, sex, Child-Pugh 
score, HBsAg positivity, AFP, PVTT extent, tumor size, 
and tumor number. Subsequently, a one-to-two match 
between the RT-TACE group and the TACE-RT group on 
patients with HCC with PVTT was obtained by use of the 
nearest-neighborhood matching using a caliper width of 
0.02 without replacement.
All statistical tests were two tailed, and a P value < 
0.05 indicated a significant difference.
