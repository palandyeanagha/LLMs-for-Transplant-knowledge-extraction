Abstract The pathogenic role of invasive fungal infections
(IFIs) has increased during the past two decades in Latin
America and worldwide, and the number of patients at risk
has risen dramatically. Working habits and leisure activities
have also been a focus of attention by public health officials,
as endemic mycoses have provoked a number of outbreaks.
An extensive search of medical literature from Latin
America suggests that the incidence of IFIs from both endemic and opportunistic fungi has increased. The increase in
endemic mycoses is probably related to population changes
(migration, tourism, and increased population growth),
whereas the increase in opportunistic mycoses may be associated with the greater number of people at risk. In both
cases, the early and appropriate use of diagnostic procedures
has improved diagnosis and outcome.

Introduction
The pathogenic role of invasive fungal infections (IFIs)
has increased during the past two decades. As diagnostic
tools have been improved and the number of patients
with an immunosuppressive state (HIV, hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation [HSCT], chemotherapy for cancer patients, autoimmune diseases) has risen dramatically,
clinicians and scientists have begun to look more deeply
into the mechanisms of disease and their relationship
with susceptible populations. Working habits (agriculture,
livestock activities) and leisure activities have also been
the focus of attention by public health officials, as a
number of outbreaks of endemic mycoses have been
considered to be a result of exposure to higher inoculum
of microorganisms in their natural habitat [1, 2•, 3•, 4–8].
The number of scientific publications has also increased,
particularly in high-resource countries, though this is not
the case in Latin America, where only a few groups of
scientists (in Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina) have
reported their experiences, mainly discussing epidemiologic surveillance (incidence, prevalence, morbidity and
mortality rates, and risk factors). A number of relevant
reviews recently have become available.
This article is divided into two sections: endemic mycoses and opportunistic IFIs, with special emphasis on histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis,
cryptococcosis, invasive candidiasis, and aspergillosis and
infection by other filamentous fungi.

Endemic Mycosis
Histoplasmosis
This is the most prevalent disseminated mycosis in
Central America, in the so-called histo belt of the central
United States (particularly in the Ohio and Mississippi
river valleys), and in the southeastern regions of Mexico.
Histoplasma capsulatum lives in soil, especially under
alkaline conditions (pH between 5 and 10) and with
ambient temperatures between 20°C and 30°C. Dormant
and active infections have been observed in miners,
geologists, guano workers, farmers, and archeologists.
Several outbreaks have been observed after accidental
exposure to large quantities of bird and bat droppings
in in endemic areas. Several cases have been reported in
European and US citizens as well as local tourists who
visited caves in Belize, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru (Fig. 1) [4, 9, 10].
The reported annual incidence in México was 0.29/
100,000 inhabitants between 1953 and 1997, whereas in
the United States, the incidence was much higher, at 3.4/
100,000 inhabitants. Prevalence studies using skin testing
have shown reactivity between 5% and 50% in different
regions, mainly reflecting dormant infection. This type of
infection has also been found in other regions, such as in
northeastern Argentina (Tucuman), with a prevalence of
4.5% to 67%; la Serra do Mar in Brazil; the Pampa
Humeda; and the Parana and Uruguay river valleys,
Venezuela, Ecuador, and Colombia [11–14, 15•, 16].
Two biotypes infect humans: H. capsulatum var capsulatum and H. capsulatum var duboissii; however, eight
clades have been defined by molecular tools: 1 and 2 in
North America, A and B in Latin America (clade A more
common in Brazil and clade B in Colombia and Argentina),
and the Australian, Indonesia/Netherland, Euroasiatic, and
African clades. Several polymorphisms have been detected
in the yps3 gene, which encodes a surface protein; its expression has been related to virulence. These polymorphic
fragments also show a geographical distribution: polymorphisms 3, 5, and 6 are more commonly found in Latin
America and 2 is found in North America [10, 17, 18, 19•].
Histoplasmosis is considered an AIDS-defining illness.
In Latin America, the prevalence varies between 2.1% and
20%; it is an AIDS-defining infection in 30–75%, usually
seen in patients with fewer than 100 CD4+ cells. Pulmonary
disease is the most common presentation, followed by cutaneous involvement; disseminated disease is found in up to
50% of the cases. In Latin America, histoplasmosis is concomitantly diagnosed with tuberculosis in 10% to 20% of
cases with disseminated disease, whereas this co-infection is
observed in only 4% of patients in Europe and the United
States [14, 15•, 20–22].
Several genetic differences between North American and
South American strains have been identified using molecular typing methods that may explain clinical and experimental differences among HIV co-infected patients. South
American strains usually behave more aggressively [23,
24]: in Mexico, for example, strains EH-53 and EH-46 have
been isolated from non-HIV patients and strains EH316-19,
EH323, and EH325 from HIV patients. Dermatotropism is
also more common in South American isolates, with cutaneous involvement seen in 40% to 80% of patients (up to
90% in reports from Argentina and Panama), compared with
fewer than 20% of US patients [25••]. Polymorphisms of the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (based on 7 positions) have been associated with two cutaneous variants,
Hc1 and Hc2; these variants have been observed in Brazil,
Argentina, Colombia, and Asia and were absent on North
American isolates [10, 17, 19•, 26].
According to the 2007 guidelines of the Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the first-choice treatment for discrete to moderate histoplasmosis should be
itraconazole, and for severe forms, amphotericin with prednisone followed by itraconazole [27].
Coccidioidomycosis
This endemic IFI is caused by species of Coccidioides.
It is highly prevalent in dry regions (<600 mm of
annual rainfall) with high temperatures. The natural
habitat of the species is 5 cm to 30 cm below the
surface of alkaline soils. Weather conditions are usually
extreme, ranging between 0°C and 45°C. The two distinct species are endemic in different regions: C. immitis
in the San Joaquin Valley in California and C. posadasii
in Arizona, Texas, Mexico, Central America, and South
America. DNA sequencing of C. posadasii has enabled
investigators to approximate the geographic origin of
the infection. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms also are useful in identifying the two species.
Zimmermann groups I and II correspond to C. immitis
and C. posadasii, by means of five differences in nuclear genes (CHS1, pyrG, tcrP, serine-proteinase antigen, CTS2) and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) [3•, 12, 28••].
There are three distinct endemic areas in Mexico: the north
(near the US border), the Pacific coast, and the central valley.
Skin testing using coccidioidin has revealed a prevalence of
5% to 30%. In Central America, two endemic areas have been
identified, the Motagua River valley in Guatemala and the
Comaya valley in Honduras, with positive skin testing up to
42%. In South America, four countries have areas with high
prevalence: in Argentina, the Sierras Pampeanas; in
Colombia, the Magdalena, Guajira, and Cesar provinces; in
Paraguay, the area of the Great Chaco; and in Venezuela, the

Departments of Falcon, Lara, and Zulia (Fig. 1). Brazil is not
an endemic region, but several outbreaks in the Piaui and
Ceará districts have been reported in association with armadillo hunting [3•, 12, 29, 30•, 31].
Increased incidence has recently been reported in
Argentina and the United States, mainly owing to migration
and new settlements in high-risk areas. In Catamarca,
Argentina, the incidence rates grew from 0.6 cases per
100,000 inhabitants before 2006 to 2.1 in 2009. Most cases
in the United States and Mexico occur in individuals younger than 5 or older than 55 years. In contrast, the higher
incidence rates observed in South America involve those 25
to 35 years of age. Pulmonary outbreaks usually have been
associated with earthquakes, military encampments, construction sites, and archaeologic excavations [31–35].
Up to 40% of those infected develop the disease, but less
than 1% of these patients have progressive pulmonary disease with dissemination, which mostly affects patients with
associated risk factors such as HIV, diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, transplantation, or third-trimester pregnancy.
This last situation favors disseminated disease 40 to 100
times more often than in the general population, and mortality rates increase up to 90%. Individuals of African
American or Asian descent have the greatest incidence and
risk of dissemination, whereas Hispanics have the lowest
incidence. Another independent risk factor is the presence of
an allele (HLA–II DRB1*1301) on chromosome 6p21.3
[3•, 11, 35, 36].
Clinical manifestations are usually pulmonary, with reticular and/or miliary disease that can progress to frank
cavitations. In Latin American patients, the most common
manifestations of disseminated disease are cutaneous, osteoarticular, or meningeal. Coinfection with tuberculosis has
been reported occasionally, especially in white men and
Hispanic migrants [29, 37, 38].
Treatment with amphotericin B, itraconazole, or fluconazole is recommended for severe pulmonary or disseminated
disease. Only amphotericin B is recommended for pregnant
women [39, 40].
Paracoccidioidomycosis
This is a South American endemic IFI caused by dimorphic
species of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex. This
complex is comprises three species (S1, PS2, and PS3). In
endemic regions, the prevalence of the infection may be as
high as 75%, affecting both men and women; 1–2% will
present active disease. About 1.4% of cases are coinfected
with HIV. Of all active cases, 80% are reported in Brazil,
especially in the south and southeast regions, where the
annual incidence is 10 to 30 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
In other regions, such as north Argentina, Venezuela, and
Colombia, the incidence is much lower, about 2.4 cases per
1,000,000 inhabitants. Sporadic cases have been reported in
México (Veracruz) and Central America, with several
imported cases found in Spain and Japan. P. brasiliensis
remains confined to particular geographic areas (Fig. 1),
predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions with moderate temperatures (17º–24°C) and heavy rain (>1,400 mm
of annual rainfall) [3•, 11, 28••, 41, 42••, 43].
Molecular epidemiology performed by RFLP/RAPD
analyses have identified subspecies that affect particular
regions: the S1 polymorphism predominates in Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela; PS2 in Brazil
and Venezuela; and PS3 exclusively in Colombia (the main
differences are on SNPs on the gp43 gene). Variations in
virulence, susceptibility to sulfonamides, and accuracy in
serodiagnosis have been related with different polymorphisms, principally between S1 and PS2 [44•, 45].
The disease is associated with exposure to the fungus
in agriculture, specifically in cotton, coffee, and tobacco
plantations; decreased risk has been observed in plantations, such as sugar plantations, that are heavily treated
with pesticides.
Tobacco consumption seems to be associated with a
predominance of chronic disease in men 30 to 60 years
of age (13–70:1 ratio). This predominance could be related to a protective effect of β estradiol in women.
Although women can be readily infected, estrogens seem
to affect the mycelial-to-yeast transition, and they also
seem to increase the secretion of interferon-γ and the
levels of TH1 cells and decrease the levels of interleukin
(IL)-10 [43, 46•], as shown in experimental models. In a
retrospective study, 82% of 27 women with paracoccidioidomycosis were menopausal, and in several studies
conducted in prepubertal children, the rate of disease was
similar in both sexes; this clinical finding supports the
experimental evidence [28••, 41, 42••, 43]. Further
population-based studies are needed to corroborate the
protective influence of estrogens in women and to determine the labor risk in urban and rural areas.
Culture is still the diagnostic gold standard. In tissue, the
fungus is abundantly present with yeast cells, which allow
for direct diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration. Serodiagnosis
is based on identification of specific antibodies by immunodiffusion. Antigen detection is also available by identification of gp43 by enzyme immunoassay [42••, 45].
Chronic pulmonary or pharyngeal infections account for
90% of cases. Pulmonary involvement is usually interstitial,
followed by fibrosis [47–50]. Although it is the most common cause of death by a systemic mycosis in Brazil (followed by cryptococcosis), mortality rates vary between 1.18
and 3.48 deaths per million inhabitants [51]. The treatment
of choice is itraconazole, which has been demonstrated to be
superior to other antifungals in several comparative clinical
trials [50].

Opportunistic Mycosis
Candidemia
Hospital-acquired infections frequently cause morbidity and
mortality. Candida bloodstream infections are a good example; they are the fourth most common cause overall of
hematogenous infections in the United States, and they rank
fourth to seventh in Europe [1, 52]. In multicenter studies
conducted in Brazil and in Mexico, it has been found that
4% of nosocomial bloodstream infections are caused by
Candida species [53–55]. C. albicans is the most frequently
isolated yeast worldwide. In the United States, C. glabrata
is the second, but in Latin America, C. tropicalis and C.
parapsilosis are the most important species after C. albicans
[54, 56]. C. tropicalis is usually isolated from neutropenic
patients and other immunocompromised hosts, perhaps because of the extensive use of prophylactic fluconazole in the
region. C. parapsilosis has been associated with central
venous catheter infections because of its ability to form
biofilms, and it has been a significant pathogen in neonatal
intensive care units [2•, 54, 56], even more important than
C. albicans [57–61].
The incidence of bloodstream fungal infections is 0.28 to
0.96 per 1,000 admissions in the United States and 0.2 to
0.38 in Europe, whereas in Latin America these rates vary
between 1.2 and 5.3 (0.2–0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-days)
[1, 2•, 54, 55, 57]. Preliminary data in two referral centers in
Mexico City showed an incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 1,000
hospital discharges, which corresponded to 0.38 per 1,000
patient days (Table 1) [53].
Crude mortality rates of about 40% have been reported
worldwide; in reports from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile,
Colombia, and Costa Rica, the mortality rates vary between
20% and 63% [53, 54, 59, 62–64]. Lower mortality rates have
been reported in outbreaks caused by C. parapsilosis [60, 63],
but this rate seems to vary between different age groups: 24%
to 34% in neonatal intensive care units; 43% in children less
than 1 year old; 23% in children 1–12 years of age; and 40% to
63% in adults (Table 1) [53, 54, 60, 65].
In Latin America, amphotericin B desoxycholate continues to be the antifungal drug most commonly used, followed
by fluconazole [54, 55, 62, 66, 67]. Echinocandins and other
amphotericin B formulations are rarely used because of their
higher cost.
Antifungal resistance studies have been conducted globally and regionally. Overall resistance to FCZ varies between 1% and 6%. However, when analyzed by species,
resistance to fluconazole in C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and
C. tropicalis is less than 3% [54, 55, 58, 60–63]. Resistance
to fluconazole in C. tropicalis has been reported in up to 6%
to 8% of cases, but these results could be influenced by “the
trailing phenomenon” seen in susceptibility testing. C.
glabrata and C. krusei are usually more resistant (30% and
70%, respectively) [58, 67, 68]. In these large studies,
resistance to amphotericin B, echinocandins, or voriconazole has not been found [69••].
Cryptococcosis
Cryptococcosis is caused by a complex group of basidiomycetes, usually yeasts of 2–10 mm in diameter. This complex is called Cryptococcus neoformans and is divided in
two varieties: C. neoformans var neoformans (serotypes A
and D, genotypes VNI–IV) and C. neoformans var gattii
(serotypes B and C, genotypes VGI–IV). About 95% of
cases are caused by var neoformans, and serotype A (var
grubii) is responsible for 95% of those. This pathogen has
ubiquitous distribution. C. gattii is endemic in tropical and
subtropical regions, and is usually observed in immunocompetent individuals [70].
Cryptococcosis is the most important cause of fungal
meningoencephalitis worldwide, affecting immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised individuals. It
may cause other clinical patterns, such as fungemia,
pneumonia, and lesions of bone, skin, and soft tissue.
Meningoencephalitis is the most common clinical form
of cryptococcosis in Latin America, with 85% of cases
caused by C. neoformans [71]; 80% are associated with
HIV infection [72, 73].
More than 215,000 patients with AIDS and cryptococcosis were observed between 1980 and 2002, and 60% of the
patients were concomitantly diagnosed [72]. The prevalence
of meningitis in Mexico has been about 7% to 11% in
patients with HIV, with a decreasing trend in recent years
[2•]. Some studies reported Cryptococcus to be the fourth or
fifth most common yeast isolated in blood cultures; sometimes it is even more common than C. glabrata [28••, 60].
The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis varies according to the population being studied. In Rio de Janeiro, the
incidence was 0.3/100,000 inhabitants in 2002, increasing to
0.68 in 2003 [73]. In Colombia, this rate was determined to
be 0.24/100,000 inhabitants among the general population,
but 3/1,000 in HIV patients [74].
A multicenter Ibero-American study done in 2003 collected 340 strains derived from humans, animals, and soil
and found that C. neoformans var grubii (serotype A) was
the most common species (56% to 93.3%). The VNI genotype was the most common in Mexico, Guatemala,
Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Argentina
(45% to 93.3%). C. neoformans var gattii was isolated in
3% to 41%, and the VGI and VGIII genotypes were the
most frequent. Of note, genotypes VNIV and VGII were
not identified in Mexico in this study, but a later report
found these genotypes in two isolates from Mexico
(Table 2) [28••, 71, 75].

Most cryptococcosis cases (75–95%) occur in HIVinfected young men (<40 years old) [75–77]. In this subgroup, C. neoformans var grubii genotype VNI has been the
most frequent pathogen isolated, and most of the patients
show counts below 100 CD4+ cells [71, 74, 76–78].
da Cunha Colombo et al. [73] reported 81 HIV-infected
patients with cryptococcosis; 50% died before receiving
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and among
those who received treatment, 25% showed signs of immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS), and 33% of the latter
group died. Cryptococcosis is the second most frequent
cause of death as a result of a fungal infection in Latin
America. Mortality rates in Africa and Latin America are
unacceptably high (31% to 75%) when compared with 20%
in developed nations. Alcoholism and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (> 400 U/L) have been found to be
significant risk factors for death [47, 72, 73, 78, 79].
Patients without HIV infection usually have other immunosuppressive conditions that predispose them to this infection. The immunosuppression in these cases has been
attributed to defects in the cellular immune response as part
of the disease or conditioned by immunosuppressive therapy, as seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,
transplant recipients, and patients with malignancies who
are undergoing chemotherapy [73]. However, recent reports
have found no underlying disease in 5–10% of the patients
with cryptococcosis; this situation may delay diagnosis and
treatment and worsen the outcome [74, 76, 77].
Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance studies have
shown that more than 99% of the isolates are susceptible
to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosine. Pfaller et
al. [80] analyzed 1,811 isolates from five different geographic regions and showed that isolates from Latin
America had results similar to those from other regions.
Lizarazo et al. [74] reported susceptibility of 93 strains
between 1997 and 2005, finding that more than 97% of
them were susceptible to amphotericin B. He also found
that isolates of C. neoformans var grubii were 100% susceptible to fluconazole and itraconazole, but C. gattii isolates were only 88% susceptible to these agents.
Current treatment guidelines for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis recommend the use of amphotericin B desoxycholate plus flucytosine, but in Latin America, 80% of
patients are treated with amphotericin B desoxycholate and
fluconazole, with results similar to those of the standard
treatment [76–78].

IFIs caused by Aspergillus species, Fusarium, Mucormycosis,

(especially bone marrow transplants), persons living with
diabetes, and patients under chronic high-dose steroid treatment. In Latin America, IFIs have been described that were
caused by this group of pathogens, especially Candida and
Aspergillus(>90% of the cases). In the same group of patients,
the more relevant risk factors were profound neutropenia,
monocyte count less than 100 cells for more than 4 days,
and elevated serum level of reactive protein C [81].
In patients with profound neutropenia and fever, up to 7%
of the cases are caused by an IFI. After candidemia, the most
important pathogens involved are Aspergillus spp, Fusarium
spp, and mucormycosis agents. In Latin America, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis has been reported as the third leading
cause of deep mycosis, and mucormycosis as the eighth most
common cause in some general hospitals [82], [83•, 84].
Characteristically, diagnosis can only be established by histopathologic findings such as angioinvasion or by the isolation
of these pathogens from the bloodstream.
Aspergillosis
Candida spp and Aspergillus spp are responsible for 80% to
90% of all IFIs. A large amount of knowledge about
Aspergillus has been accumulated recently, especially regarding its biology, epidemiology, risk factors for infection,
host characteristics, clinical pictures (acute invasive sinusitis, allergic sinusitis, pulmonary invasive aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergillomas,
intestinal and cutaneous aspergillosis), treatment, and preventive strategies. Studies have considered all types of
patients, but most have emphasized patients with hematologic neoplastic diseases or bone marrow transplant recipients. Aspergillus is the most common cause of IFI in patients
with allogenic HSCT in Latin America, with a bimodal
distribution (before posttransplant day 30 or after day 90),
and it is the second most common cause in solid-organ
transplant recipients. Aspergillosis occurs in 3% of patients
with bone marrow transplants and in 1.3% of hepatic transplants, rates higher than the reported incidence in surveillance studies in the United States and Europe [5–7]. The
most common species is A. fumigatus, and the most common clinical presentation is pulmonary, followed by sinusitis [81, 85, 86].
Diagnostic tools that have been implemented include
culture, histopathology, and serologic methods; galactomannan in serum by immunoenzymatic assays has proven
to be useful when determined in multiple serial samples in
several circumstances, including early diagnosis in probable
invasive infection (with concomitant improvement in outcome), and therapeutic follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy [85, 87, 88]. Recently, several institutions in Latin
America have incorporated its use for the routine evaluation
of high-risk patients.
Voriconazole is considered the first-line treatment for this
clinical condition, but amphotericin B desoxycholate is still
used in Latin America because of economic reasons.
Crude mortality from aspergillosis ranges from 30% to
83% worldwide, and mortality rates in Latin America are
higher than 70%, especially among HSCT recipients.
Mortality in solid-organ transplant recipients is lower than
in HSCT recipients worldwide [5–7, 87, 88].
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing in 50 clinical isolates
of A. fumigatus (from México, Peru, Argentina, and France)
showed a splendid susceptibility to itraconazole (MIC900
0.25 mg/mL), voriconazole (MIC 9000.25 mg/mL), and
amphotericin B (MIC9001 mg/mL), similar to other results
from two recent international studies [89, 90].
Fusariosis
One of the most common mold IFIs seen in immunocompromised patients is caused by Fusarium spp septated fungi. Three clinically important species have been
recognized: F. solani, F. oxysporum, and F. verticillioidis.
These IFIs are therapeutic challenges worldwide because
Fusarium spp are often resistant to most antifungal
agents. Fusariosis causes fungemia (>60%) in immunocompromised patients, with or without endocarditis, skin
lesions (60–80%), sinusitis, and lung disease. In immunocompetent patients, fusariosis tends to be a superficial
infection (keratitis and onychomycosis) or to cause locally invasive skin or soft-tissue infection [91].
Brazilian investigators reported an overall incidence of
5.97 cases per 1,000 HSCT recipients; HLA-mismatched
related-donor HSCT recipients showed the highest incidence
and autologous HSCT recipients, the lowest. A trimodal distribution of fusariosis (early, late, and >1 year after receipt of
HSCT) has been described, and Fusarium is well known as
the second most important invasive filamentous fungi in immunocompromised hosts.
The crude mortality rate reported in Latin America is 66%,
but in patients with disseminated disease and persistent immunodeficiency (as in prolonged neutropenia and monocytemia and chronic high doses of corticosteroid), mortality is as
high as 100%; similar results were reported in the TransplantAssociated Infection Surveillance Network (TRANSNET)
database [5, 6, 92, 93].
Management of this IFI depends on accurate identification. The first line of therapy is high-dose amphotericin B
desoxycholate (>1.5 mg/kg per day). Voriconazole can be
used as a second choice, and posaconazole and other antifungal combinations have been described as salvage therapy
in cases of invasive fusariosis. Adjunctive treatment is based
on identification of cases requiring surgical debridement and
patients who can tolerate less immunosuppressive therapy
as well as granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [94].
30 Curr Fungal Infect Rep (2012) 6:23–34

Mucormycosis
Caused by hyaline aseptate fungi, the most common species
are Mucor, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, and Lichtheimia (previously Absidia), although Cunninghamella Bertholletia and
Apophysomyces elegans also are frequent causes.
Multicenter studies have described an increase in the
incidence of mucormycosis, which has become the third
leading cause of IFI among high-risk immunocompromised
patients, after Aspergillus and Fusarium. Major risk factors
for mucormycosis include profound and prolonged neutropenia and chronic high-dose corticosteroid use, as well as
tissue iron overload, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, voriconazole prophylaxis (mainly in HSCT), or
previous skin and soft-tissue trauma [8, 95]. The most
commonly seen clinical forms are rhinocerebral, pulmonary,
osteomuscular and skin diseases.
Some clinical reports and brief series of cases in Latin
America have been published, all of which share the same
characteristics: late diagnosis, biopsy as the main tool in
diagnosis, and high mortality rate. The mortality rate has
decreased with the use of combined therapy using antifungal
drugs and extensive surgical debridement [95–103].
Conclusions
An extensive search of the medical literature from Latin
America seems to show that the incidence of IFIs has
increased for both endemic and opportunistic fungal infections. The increase of endemic IFIs is probably related to
population changes (migration, tourism, and increased population growth), whereas the change in the incidence of
opportunistic IFIs is likely to be associated with an increase
in the number of people at risk. In both cases, the early and
appropriate use of standard and new diagnostic procedures
has improved the diagnosis and patient outcomes.
Histoplasmosis has shown interesting characteristics. It
seems to be more aggressive because of some genetic characteristics, as evidenced by more frequent skin involvement
among Latin American patients. In addition, tuberculosis
plays a major role as coinfection in people living with
HIV in this part of the world.
Opportunistic IFIs caused by yeasts have been extensively studied in Latin America, where the incidence of bloodstream infections due to Candida appears to be higher than
in Europe and the United States. In addition, the Candida
species distribution in this region is different, probably due
to strong variations in the quality of health care for high-risk
patients.
IFIs caused by filamentous fungi have increased in the
past two decades, and an additional increase in the number
of these IFIs should be expected. Invasive mold infections
have a high mortality rate because of poor drug susceptibility, a greater population with prolonged immunocompromise, and the lack of appropriate tools to obtain an early
diagnosis. Therefore, multicenter and large clinical, epidemiologic, and susceptibility surveillance studies are needed
in Latin America to improve our comprehension of the IFIs
among the population at risk.
