Abstract
Objective To evaluate the effects of hepatitis B vaccine and
immunoglobulin in newborn infants of mothers positive for
hepatitis B surface antigen.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised
clinical trials.
Data sources Electronic databases and hand searches.
Review methods Randomised clinical trials were assessed for
methodological quality. Meta-analysis was undertaken on three
outcomes: the relative risks of hepatitis B occurrence, antibody
levels to hepatitis B surface antigen, and adverse events.
Results 29 randomised clinical trials were identified, five of
which were considered high quality. Only three trials reported
inclusion of mothers negative for hepatitis B e antigen.
Compared with placebo or no intervention, vaccination
reduced the occurrence of hepatitis B (relative risk 0.28, 95%
confidence interval 0.20 to 0.40; four trials). No significant
difference in hepatitis B occurrence was found between
recombinant vaccine and plasma derived vaccine (1.00, 0.71 to
1.42; four trials) and between high dose versus low dose vaccine
(plasma derived vaccine 0.97, 0.55 to 1.68, three trials;
recombinant vaccine 0.78, 0.31 to 1.94, one trial). Compared
with placebo or no intervention, hepatitis B immunoglobulin or
the combination of plasma derived vaccine and hepatitis B
immunoglobulin reduced hepatitis B occurrence
(immunoglobulin 0.50, 0.41 to 0.60, one trial; vaccine and
immunoglobulin 0.08, 0.03 to 0.17, three trials). Compared with
vaccine alone, vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin
reduced hepatitis B occurrence (0.54, 0.41 to 0.73; 10 trials).
Hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin seem safe,
but few trials reported adverse events.
Conclusion Hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin,
and vaccine plus immunoglobulin prevent hepatitis B
occurrence in newborn infants of mothers positive for hepatitis
B surface antigen.
Introduction
Hepatitis B is a global communicable disease, associated with an
estimated 350 million chronically infected patients.1 Mother to
child transmission occurs often, either in utero or through exposure to blood or blood contaminated fluids at or around birth.
Such perinatal transmission is believed to account for 35% to
50% of hepatitis B carriers.2 The risk of perinatal transmission is
associated with the hepatitis B e antigen status of the mother. If a
mother is positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen, 70% to 90% of her children become chronically infected.3 4
If a mother is positive for the surface antigen but negative for the
e antigen, the risk of transmission is significantly lower.5–9
Two types of vaccines for hepatitis B have been licensed. One
is derived from plasma (plasma derived vaccine) and the other is
derived from yeast or mammalian cells (recombinant vaccine).10
Repeated injections over months are required to mount an
effective antibody response with vaccination. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin has high levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. The immunoglobulin is immediately effective and seems
protective for several months, after which it wanes.11 12 In the
present systematic review, we assessed the beneficial and harmful
effects of hepatitis B vaccines and hepatitis B immunoglobulin in
newborn infants of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.
Methods
We applied the Cochrane Collaboration methodology13
described in our predefined and peer reviewed protocol for this
review.14We included all trials that randomised newborn infants
of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen to hepatitis B
vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin within the first
month of life. We identified randomised trials from the registers
of the Cochrane Neonatal Group, the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary
Group, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials,
Medline, PubMed, and Embase. The last search was carried out
in February 2004. We scanned references lists and contacted
manufacturers of hepatitis B vaccine to ask for unpublished randomised trials. We wrote to the authors of trials when data were
not provided in the report. Our primary outcome measure was
the occurrence of hepatitis B, defined as a blood specimen positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.15 The secondary outcome
measures were antibody levels to hepatitis B surface antigen
< 10 IU/l (considered insufficient to prevent hepatitis B virus
infection16 17) and adverse events.
We assessed the methodological quality of trials on the basis
of their published reports, and information from the authors. We
post hoc classified trials as high quality if they had at least two of
the following components: adequate generation of allocation
sequence, adequate allocation concealment, or adequate
blinding. We did this because only one trial had high quality for
all the components. We carried out meta-analyses using a fixed
effect model and a random effects model in RevMan analyses
4.2. If the results of both analyses concurred, we reported the
results of the fixed effect model only.

We presented binary outcomes as relative risks with 95%
confidence intervals. Data were analysed by the intention to treat
principle, including all randomised participants. Heterogeneity
was explored by 2 test, with significance set ataPvalue < 0.10.
The extent of heterogeneity was measured by I2
.
18 We carried out
metaregression analysis using Stata if more than 10 trials were
included on hepatitis B occurrence. Metaregression examined
the intervention effect in relation to methodological quality of
trials, dosage of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccine, and
time of injection.13 We carried out subgroup analyses according
to methodological quality, hepatitis B e antigen status of the
mother, and time of injection. We used the test for interaction to
estimate the difference between two subgroups.19 For hepatitis B
occurrence we included infants with incomplete or missing data
in sensitivity analyses by imputing them into the following
scenarios (the last four being intention to treat analyses): case
analysis available, poor outcome assumed, good outcome
assumed, extreme case favours experimental intervention, and
extreme case favours control group.20 We used funnel plot and
Stata to detect publication bias and other biases according to the
methods of Begg and Egger.21 22
Results
Overall, 226 references were identified, 187 of which were
excluded. The remaining 39 references,7 23–60 referring to 29 randomised clinical trials, were included. Three of the trials did not
provide relevant data on our outcome measures (fig 1).29 58 60
The immunisation schedules varied substantially. A number
of trials had several intervention groups. Table 1 lists the relevant
comparisons of the included trials. Eighteen trials included
mothers positive for hepatitis B e antigen, three included mothers positive and negative for hepatitis B e antigen, and eight did
not report on the mother’s hepatitis B e antigen status. Ten trials
reported exclusion of low birthweight infants (the limits for
exclusion varied from 1600 g to 3000 g). The remaining 19 trials
did not report any exclusion criteria for birth weight. The
average duration of follow-up was 19 months (range 6 to 60
months).
Methodological quality of included trials
Generation of the allocation sequence was adequately described
in six trials.23 26 30 31 43 44 Treatment allocation was adequately concealed in six trials.29–32 40 44 Adequate methods of double blinding
were reported in three trials.30 32 40 Five trials were classified by us
as of high quality (table 2).30–32 40 44 The numbers and reasons for
drop outs and withdrawals were adequately described in six
trials.7 24 29 30 44 52
Hepatitis B vaccine versus placebo or no intervention
Compared with placebo or no intervention, hepatitis B vaccination significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B occurrence
(relative risk 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.40; four trials) (fig 2). Heterogeneity was considerable (P = 0.07, I2 = 54.2%).
The results of sensitivity analyses for drop outs were consistent,
indicating the robustness of the finding. Analyses of plasma
derived vaccine and recombinant vaccine individually showed
that both vaccines significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B
occurrence.
Subgroup analyses between high quality and low quality trials, the mother’s hepatitis B e antigen status, or time of vaccination were not significantly different (tests for interaction,
P = 0.25, P = 0.07, and P = 0.11, respectively).
Retrospective subgroup analyses according to vaccine schedules (0, 1, and 6 months v 0, 1, 2, and 6 or 12 months) showed no
significant difference (test for interaction, P = 0.75). No data on
adverse events were reported.
Recombinant vaccine versus plasma derived vaccine
Recombinant vaccine and plasma derived vaccine showed no
significant difference in hepatitis B occurrence (1.00, 0.70 to
1.42; four trials) (fig 3). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 29.4%).
Sensitivity analyses for drop outs confirmed the finding of no
significant difference between the two vaccines. Subgroup analyses for methodological quality or mother’s hepatitis B e antigen
status showed no significant difference (tests for interaction, both
P = 0.21).
Significantly fewer infants receiving recombinant vaccine
compared with plasma derived vaccine had antibody levels to
hepatitis B surface antigen < 10 IU/l (0.51, 0.36 to 0.72; three
trials).
High dose versus low dose vaccine
High dose vaccine and low dose vaccine showed no significant
difference in hepatitis B occurrence (plasma derived vaccine
0.97, 0.55 to 1.68, three trials; recombinant vaccine 0.78, 0.31 to
1.94, one trial). Owing to too few trials, it was inappropriate to
carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses. No significant difference was found between high dose vaccine versus low dose vaccine on antibody levels to hepatitis B surface antigen < 10 IU/l
(1.02, 0.82 to 1.27; two trials).
Schedules and types of recombinant vaccine and plasma
derived vaccine
No significant differences were found in hepatitis B occurrences
among different vaccination schedules, different recombinant
vaccines, and different plasma derived vaccines (data not shown).

Hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus placebo or no
intervention
Overall, hepatitis B immunoglobulin significantly decreased the
risk of hepatitis B occurrence in infants (0.52, 0.44 to 0.63; 11 trials) (fig 4). Compared with placebo or no intervention, hepatitis
B immunoglobulin alone significantly reduced hepatitis B
occurrence (0.50, 0.41 to 0.60; one trial). Compared with
vaccination, vaccination plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin significantly reduced hepatitis B occurrence (0.54, 0.41 to 0.73; 10 trials). The sensitivity analyses for drop outs were consistent,
indicating the robustness of the findings. In the metaregression
analyses, none of the trial characteristics (methodological quality,
dosage of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or time of hepatitis B
immunoglobulin injection) was significantly associated with the
effect of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (P = 0.92, P = 0.67, and
P = 0.79, respectively). Subgroup analyses did not show a significant difference between high quality and low quality trials, the
mother’s hepatitis B e antigen status, or time of hepatitis B
immunoglobulin injection (tests for interaction, P = 0.70, 0.62,
and 0.63, respectively).
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin did not significantly reduce the
number of infants with antibody levels to hepatitis B surface
antigen < 10 IU/l (1.55, 0.89 to 2.73; four trials).
Few trials reported adverse events. If reported, the authors
did not specify in which intervention group they occurred. A
meta-analysis on adverse events could not, therefore, be carried
out. In one trial,24 one infant who received hepatitis B
immunoglobulin died. The death seemed to be unrelated to the
immunoglobulin.
Neither funnel plot on hepatitis B occurrence showed asymmetry (Egger test, P = 0.31; Begg test, P = 0.23).
Multiple versus single injection of hepatitis B
immunoglobulin
Multiple hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus plasma derived
vaccine versus single hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection plus
plasma derived vaccine did not significantly reduce the risk of
hepatitis B occurrence (0.87, 0.30 to 2.47; two trials, I2 = 0%).

Vaccination plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus placebo
or no intervention
Compared with placebo or no intervention, plasma derived vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin significantly reduced
hepatitis B occurrence (0.08, 0.03 to 0.17; three trials) (fig 5). The
sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the finding. Subgroup analyses did not find a significant difference between high
quality and low quality trials, the mother’s hepatitis B e antigen
status, or time of hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection (tests for
interaction, P = 0.13, P = 0.28, and P = 0.22, respectively).
One trial reported the number of adverse events: three out of
71 infants given vaccination compared with five out of 34 in the
control group.32 The results showed no significant difference
(0.29, 0.07 to 1.13; one trial).
Discussion
Our systematic reviews shows that hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B
immunoglobulin, or the combination of vaccine plus immunoglobulin given to the newborn infants of mothers positive for
hepatitis B surface antigen prevents the occurrence of hepatitis
B. Furthermore, the combination of vaccine plus immunoglobulin was superior to vaccine alone. These benefits were not significantly associated with the methodological quality of the trials, the
mother’s hepatitis B e antigen status, time of injection, or number
of infants dropping out of the study.
Our review has several potential limitations. Firstly, some
analyses include few trials and a small number of newborn
infants. Secondly, most trials were of low methodological quality.
We did not, however, find a strong association between
methodological quality and results. This supports the robustness
of our results, but does not exclude the possibility of bias.61–63
Thirdly, although we did not find asymmetries in funnel plots, we
cannot exclude publication bias. Fourthly, only a few investigators responded to our request for further information and often
that the details were lost. Fifthly, most trials reported only surrogate outcomes (hepatitis B surface antigen status or antibody
levels to hepatitis B surface antigen) and not long term clinical
outcomes. One trial with long term follow-up did find more
patients with chronic hepatitis in the plasma derived vaccine plus
hepatitis B immunoglobulin group compared with the plasma
derived vaccine group.32
Our results show that hepatitis B vaccination prevents the
occurrence of hepatitis B in the newborn infants of mothers
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. We found no significant
difference between recombinant vaccine and plasma derived
vaccine on hepatitis B infections (relative risk 1.00, 95% CI 0.70
to 1.42). However, more infants who received recombinant
vaccine achieved antibody levels to hepatitis surface antigen
> 10 IU/l (1.96, 1.39 to 2.78). The advantage of recombinant
vaccine might be due to the difference in chemical and physical
characteristics of the antigen components of the vaccines.64
Recombinant vaccine is used in high income countries owing to
the fear of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus and other
infections, including transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.65 Our finding seems to support the introduction of recombinant vaccines in clinical practice.
The recommended schedules for immune prophylaxis
against hepatitis B varies among countries.66 67 In general we
were unable to show significant differences among different
doses, different schedules, and different forms of plasma derived
vaccine and recombinant vaccine on hepatitis B occurrence. Furthermore, our subgroup analyses did not show a strong association between timing of injection (within 12, 24, or 48 hours) and
magnitude of effects. The number of infants evaluated in these
comparisons was small. Therefore larger trials are needed before
equivalence or non-inferiority can be claimed.
Our meta-analyses found that hepatitis B immunoglobulin
alone or when added to hepatitis B vaccine decreased the risk of
hepatitis B infection (0.52, 0.44 to 0.63). A recent nonrandomised study reported no benefit of adding hepatitis B
immunoglobulin to vaccine in mothers negative for hepatitis B e
antigen.68 In our analysis, only one small trial out of 11 trials
included infants of such mothers.55 Our subgroup analysis did

not find any statistically significant difference between infants of
mothers negative or positive for hepatitis B e antigen. More randomised trials seem warranted on the addition of hepatitis B
immunoglobulin to vaccine for infants of mothers negative for
hepatitis B e antigen. It should be noted that hepatitis B immunoglobulin, as with plasma derived vaccine, has the potential for
transmission of bloodborne infections.69
Few trials reported sufficiently on adverse events. According
to what was reported, hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin seem safe. These results are in accordance with two
Cochrane reviews on hepatitis B vaccination of healthcare workers and dialysis patients.70 71 Furthermore, cohort studies found
that hepatitis B vaccination is well tolerated and that severe
adverse events are rare.72–79 One cohort study did find, however,

that hepatitis B vaccine increased the risk of chronic arthritis and
acute ear infections.80 We are unable to determine if the reliability of this finding owing to the methodological weaknesses of
cohort studies.66 Randomised clinical trials may overlook adverse
events because of the relatively low numbers of participants or
poor reporting of adverse events.81–83 Further trials ought to
focus on adverse events after the International Conference on
Harmonisation’s guidelines for clinical trials.79
In general, the risk of perinatal transmission from mothers
negative for hepatitis B e antigen is considered much lower than
that from mothers who are positive for the antigen.5–9 Further,
the infants of hepatitis B e antigen negative mothers often clear
an asymptomatic infection.15 Our findings are mainly based on
immune prophylaxis for infants of mothers positive for hepatitis
B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen. Evidence from randomised clinical trials is insufficient to either support or refute
immune prophylaxis for infants of mothers negative for hepatitis B e antigen. The applicability of our findings to mothers
negative for hepatitis B e antigen, which are of high proportions
in, for example, the United States and northern Europe, is therefore limited.84 Cost effectiveness studies indicate that hepatitis B
vaccination for infants of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface
antigen are cost effective in countries with low,85–88 intermediate,
and high prevalence.89–92 We identified no cost effectiveness studies assessing the effects of adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin to
vaccine. As hepatitis B immunoglobulin may reduce the risk of
hepatitis B infection, the need to carry out cost effectiveness
studies based on randomised trials seems justified.
Two trials that discussed a new way to potentially prevent
vertical transmission of hepatitis B did not fulfil our inclusion
criteria.14 The two trials randomised pregnant women positive
for hepatitis B surface antigen to hepatitis B immunoglobulin
versus no intervention before delivery.93 94 In the group receiving
immunoglobulin, fewer infants were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at follow-up. The methodological quality of those
trials was low. Furthermore, the mothers are at risk of developing
immune complex disease due to hepatitis B immunoglobulin
reacting with their own circulating hepatitis B surface antigens.
More trials are therefore needed before this intervention should
be adopted.

What is already known on this topic
Mother to child transmission accounts for up to 50% of
hepatitis B carriers
Repeated vaccination over months is required to mount an
effective antibody response
Immunoglobulin is immediately effective and seems
protective for several months, after which it wanes
What this study adds
Vaccine decreased the risk of hepatitis B infection among
infants of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
Immunoglobulin alone or added to vaccine decreased the
risk of hepatitis B infection among infants of mothers
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
Evidence on immunisation for infants of mothers positive
for hepatitis B surface antigen but negative for hepatitis B e
antigen is weak
