Although arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders are among the most frequent causes of 
mortality and morbidity, there has been little description of how the composition of thrombi and emboli 
depends on their vascular origin and age. We quantifed the structure and composition of arterial and 
venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Arterial 
thrombi contained a surprisingly large amount of fbrin, in addition to platelets. The composition of 
pulmonary emboli mirrored the most distal part of venous thrombi from which they originated, which 
difered from the structure of the body and head of the same thrombi. All thrombi and emboli contained 
few biconcave red blood cells but many polyhedrocytes or related forms of compressed red blood 
cells, demonstrating that these structures are a signature of clot contraction in vivo. Polyhedrocytes 
and intermediate forms comprised the major constituents of venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli. 
The structures within all of the thrombi and emboli were very tightly packed, in contrast to clots 
formed in vitro. There are distinctive, reproducible diferences among arterial and venous thrombi and 
emboli related to their origin, destination and duration, which may have clinical implications for the 
understanding and treatment of thrombotic disorders.
Tromboembolism remains a leading cause of death and disability. Trombi may partially or totally obstruct 
arteries or veins, leading to local ischemic complications and they can embolize to the cerebral arteries and lungs, 
where they may cause stroke or other life-threatening conditions. Tere are approximately 1 million incident 
cases of deep venous thromboembolism each year and over 60,000 deaths per year from recognized pulmonary 
embolism in the United States alone1,2
. Over 900,000 patients are hospitalized each year for management of acute 
myocardial infarction, which is responsible for 1 in every 6 deaths in the US, and about 800,000 patients sufer 
from stroke each year with 87% of all strokes being ischemic. Stroke kills about 140,000 people each year, or 1 in 
20 deaths in the US3
. Insights into the pathophysiology of thrombotic disorders have come from studies using a 
variety of designs, ranging from detailed in vitro molecular and cellular approaches, ex vivo pathological studies, 
in silico multiscale thrombosis modeling to in vivo animal models and clinical trials. Yet, there are remarkably few 
detailed analyses of thrombus structure that further our understanding of their relationship to vascular origin and 
duration in vivo, as well as the composition or the internal structural features of thrombi most closely associated 
with the risk of embolization.
Te composition, physical properties, and evolution of venous and arterial thrombi are likely to difer mainly 
due to various local conditions and time since formation. Platelets play an important role in the development of 
arterial thrombi formed at relatively high wall shear rates (~102
–105 s−1), generating what are ofen termed “white” 
thrombi. In patients with coronary artery disease, thrombi commonly arise from the rupture of atherosclerotic 
plaque and exposure of procoagulant components, such as collagen and lipid-rich activated macrophages bearing 
tissue factor4
, leading to myocardial infarction if thrombi become obstructive. Similar events may lead to in situ
arterial thrombosis in the cerebral or other circulations. In contrast, venous thrombi formed under low shear 
rate (10–100 s−1
) are mainly composed of red blood cells (RBCs) and fbrin, i.e. “red” thrombi. Te formation of 
venous thrombi is generally attributed to a combination of hypercoagulability together with injured or activated 
endothelium and impaired blood fow (Virchow’s triad)5,6
. Whether these perceived diferences in pathogenesis 
afect thrombus structure has received relatively little investigation but may be important for the risk of extension 
and embolization and approach to therapy.

Thrombi also undergo structural changes as they age. For example, the composition of coronary artery 
thrombi obtained from patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction evolve over time such that fbrin content 
doubles each hour during clinically manifesting ischemia, whereas the relative platelet content halves each hour7,8
. 
Tese changes have been associated with formation of a dense, stif fbrin network that impairs responsiveness 
to anti-platelet therapy and thrombolysis over time9,10. A similar increase in stifness over time associated with 
changes in structure occurs with aging of venous thrombi11. Knowing more about changes in thrombus structure 
over time is desirable, because they could infuence the treatment approach and prognosis.
Until recently, RBCs have been viewed as passive bystanders in these processes. It is generally thought that 
RBCs are trapped in venous clots and might thereby increase vascular occlusion, but that they otherwise contribute little to arterial occlusion. Tere is now increasing evidence that RBCs play a substantial role in clotting12. 
Sub-fractions of RBCs express phosphatidylserine on their surface and thus support thrombin generation13,14. 
RBCs also suppress plasmin generation and as a result inhibit clot lysis15,16. Platelet-driven clot contraction results 
in compression of RBCs into a tightly packed interior core with an accompanying shape change to polyhedral 
cells, named polyhedrocytes, whereas fbrin and platelets are mostly on the surface17. Polyhedrocytes have also 
been observed in intracoronary thrombi taken from patients post ST-elevation myocardial infarction8,17,18 as well 
as in ex vivo thrombi, venous clots and postmortem pulmonary emboli12,19,20. In vitro studies of clot contraction 
have demonstrated that the kinetics of clot contraction are accelerated and extent of contraction is enhanced by 
higher platelet levels and inhibited by RBCs and higher fbrinogen concentrations21.
Despite the clinical importance, a comprehensive analysis of these and the above-mentioned features to 
human arterial and venous thrombi and emboli has not been reported.
In this study, we used high resolution scanning electron microscopy to examine how the vascular origin and 
aging afect the structure and composition of in vivo human arterial and venous thrombi extracted from living 
patients and postmortem pulmonary emboli. We determined the proportions composed of diferent forms of 
fbrin, the presence of biconcave, polyhedral and intermediate compressed forms of RBCs, and echinocytes, as 
well as volume fractions of the thrombi comprised by leukocytes, platelets, and cellular microvesicles. Tese 
results revealed unique characteristics and diferences between arterial and venous thrombi as well as between 
their younger and older thrombi. Tese diferences in composition among various types of thrombi not only 
refect the mechanisms of their formation but also have implications for why some thrombi embolize and difer 
in their responsiveness to antithrombotic treatments.
Results
Approach. We used high resolution scanning electron microscopy to examine the structure and composition 
of the exterior and interior of 45 freshly aspirated arterial thrombi, 25 venous thrombi from open thrombectomy, 
and 10 postmortem pulmonary emboli (for technical details of obtaining thrombi and patient characteristics see 
the Supplemental Material and Methods). We imaged 10–12 randomly selected areas and collected 10–12 images 
from each specimen, resulting in about 700 total images. We studied these images without any pre-determined 
criteria to develop a set of “typical structural elements” found in any or all types of thrombi and emboli. We then 
selected representative images from randomly chosen portions of 6 arterial thrombi, 5 venous thrombi, and 6 pulmonary emboli that contained all the typical structural elements seen in all the specimens, and the overall composition and structural elements contained in these portions were quantifed. Te following structural elements 
were included in the analysis: fbrin (individual fbers, bundles, sponge); individual platelets, platelet aggregates 
and degranulated platelets; RBCs (biconcave, polyhedral, intermediate forms, balloon-like forms, echinocytes); 
white blood cells (WBCs); cellular microvesicles; and space between structures. In sum, total image areas of 
29,600 µm2
 from arterial thrombi, 55,100 µm2 from venous thrombi, and 38,600 µm2 from pulmonary emboli 
were quantifed (Supplemental Fig. S1).
Diferential composition of arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli. Composition of 
arterial thrombi. Coronary artery thrombi were composed primarily of fbrin (43% of the thrombus volume) 
and platelets (31%) (Figs. 1A–C and 2, Table 1). However, the appearance of the fbrin was surprisingly inhomogeneous and difered considerably from clots formed in vitro, which are generally composed of a branching 
network of individual thin fbers22. In the arterial thrombi, fbrin was found predominantly in the form of bundles (55% of all fbrin types), some of which were unusually thick. In addition, there was also a highly branched 
network of very thin fbers that we have termed “fbrin sponge”. Tese arterial thrombi were dense, meaning little 
unoccupied space was present. Tey also showed evidence of clot contraction, in that polyhedrocytes were commonly interspersed among fber bundles17. During clot contraction, platelets pull on fbrin fbers and compress 
RBCs, resulting in a transformation of shape from biconcave cells to polyhedral and various intermediate forms 
with formation of fber bundles17. Other RBCs appear balloon-shaped, as if they had been squeezed through 
the network of fbrin fbers or were otherwise deformed, as reported previously23,24. Of the 17% of the volume 
composed of RBCs, most (15%) comprised polyhedrocytes or other compressed forms, with smaller proportions 
of normal biconcave RBCs (2%) and balloon-like RBCs (less than 1%). Cellular microvesicles and leukocytes 
occupied 5% and less than 2% of the thrombus volume, respectively.
Composition of venous thrombi. Te overall composition of venous thrombi difered signifcantly from arterial 
thrombi. RBCs and fbrin fbers were the major components of venous thrombi, comprising on average 63% and 
35% of the volume, respectively, while arterial thrombi were mostly composed of fbrin and platelets (Table 1; 
Fig. 1G–I). RBC content was signifcantly higher in venous thrombi than in arterial thrombi (p<0.0001). Te 
proportion of compressed RBCs was also higher in venous thrombi than in arterial thrombi (p<0.0001). Most 
of the RBC component was present as polyhedrocytes and intermediate-shaped cells (38% and 19% of all RBCs, 
respectively), while the corresponding percentage in arterial thrombi was 13% and 2%. Only 2% of the cells in

venous thrombi were biconcave discs. Surprisingly, 5% of venous thrombus volume was occupied by echinocytes, 
which are characterized by spike-like or thorny projections. Such changes could be caused by long-term metabolic changes or alteration of their environment afer thrombus formation. Te fbrin was heterogeneous in composition, with 12%, 5% and 18% in the form of single fbrin fbers, fbrin sponge, and fbrin bundles, respectively. 
Te platelet content (0.4%) was signifcantly lower than in arterial thrombi (31.3%, p<0.0001). Te remainder of 
the volume was made up of microvesicles (1%) and leukocytes (less than 1%) (Table 1; Fig. 2).
Composition of pulmonary emboli. The Chi-square test showed that overall composition of pulmonary emboli 
difered signifcantly from arterial thrombi (p<0.0001) but was not signifcantly diferent from venous thrombi 
(p=0.061), although some individual diferences were signifcant. Te proportions of volume occupied by RBCs and 
platelets were especially diferent from the respective volumes they occupied in arterial thrombi (p<0.0001 for both).

Tere were slight diferences of emboli with parental venous thrombi, namely they were both composed primarily of 
fbrin fbers and RBCs. However, the volumes occupied by these structures in the emboli (41% and 49% of the overall 
composition, respectively) were diferent from the venous thrombi (Table 1; Fig. 2). Sixty percent of the total fbrin 
component in emboli was composed of individual fbrin fbers, which is signifcantly more than in venous thrombi 
(p=0.0025). Overall, the RBC content was lower in pulmonary emboli than in venous thrombi, 63% versus 49% 
(p=0.046). Another notable diference was that polyhedrocytes comprised a larger portion of RBC population (81%) 
compared with venous thrombi (59%) (p=0.0053). Te volumes occupied by platelets (0.8%), microvesicles (4%), and 
leukocytes (5%) were similar to the proportions in venous thrombi (Table 1; Fig. 2).
Individual components. Fibrin content and structure. Tree morphologically diferent fbrin structures 
were identifed within all thrombi: individual fbrin fbers, fbrin bundles, and fbrin sponge. Fibrin fbers, which 
typically predominate in in vitro blood clots, are generally long and relatively straight with occasional branch 
points (Fig. 1E,F,I). Te fbrin sponge is a fbrin network composed of very fne fbers, ofen with bound platelets 
and microvesicles (Fig. 1B). Fibrin bundles are fbers that have associated laterally with other fbers (Fig. 1A,D,G). 
Fiber bundles more than 1 μm in diameter were frequently observed within ex vivo thrombi (Fig. 3A,B), with very 
large pores separating bundles from each other (Fig. 3A). Some fbrin fbers formed twisted structures, especially 
thicker fbers or bundles (Fig. 3A). In some images, fber bundles were present together with thin fbers and 
cells or cellular microvesicles (Fig. 3B,C). Fibrin fbers had either smooth or rough surfaces. In some sections, 
e.g. regions with many fber ends, whole pieces of fbers appeared to be missing, perhaps as the result of partial 
enzymatic digestion25.
Te average total fbrin content was greater in arterial thrombi (51±5%) than in venous thrombi (36±4%) 
or pulmonary emboli (31±6%) (p=0.0408 and p=0.0088 respectively (Fig. 4A). More fbrin bundles were 
observed in arterial thrombi (42±8%) than in venous thrombi (20±3%) and pulmonary emboli (19±8%) 
(p=0.0035 for both (Fig. 4B).
In contrast to fbrin clots formed under static conditions in vitro, fbrin in thrombi showed the efects of fow. 
In thrombi, the fbers displayed a defnite directionality or preferential orientation of fbers in a single direction, 
but the degree of anisotropy was highly variable. In some cases, parts of a thrombus with a dense mat of fbers 
were oriented in the same direction, with very few holes or gaps (Fig. 5A,B). Te degree of anisotropy was quantifed by the use of polar plots, showing numbers of fbers at diferent angles (Fig. 5C). Some areas contained fbers 
that showed relatively random orientation, while others showed a moderate or a large amount of alignment. In a 
few cases where the orientation could be determined from the gross structure of the thrombus, it could be seen 
that the fbers were oriented in the direction of fow.
Thrombi also showed effects of platelet-driven contraction on fibrin redistribution from being uniform 
throughout the clot to the surface (Fig. 3)17.
Figure 2. Quantitation of structures identifed in pulmonary emboli, arterial and venous thrombi. Trombi 
were obtained from patients and prepared for scanning electron microscopy and their composition was 
quantifed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Te fbrin component was present as individual 
fbrin fbers, fbrin sponge and fbrin bundles; erythrocytes as biconcave, intermediate shapes, polyhedrocytes, 
echinocytes and balloon-like forms. Te proportions of total volume occupied by these structures were 
calculated and presented as pie charts. RBC=red blood cell.

RBC content and morphology. Te population of RBCs in the thrombi was divided morphologically into biconcave 
RBCs, intermediate-shaped RBCs, polyhedrocytes, balloon-like RBCs, and echinocytes. Polyhedrocytes originate from 
intravital platelet-driven mechanical compaction of thrombi. Intermediate-shaped RBCs are partially compressed cells 
that are no longer biconcave but not yet polyhedral-shaped. Te total average RBC content was signifcantly greater in 
venous thrombi (50±5%) and in pulmonary emboli (44±6%) compared to arterial thrombi (3.7±1.0%) (p<0.0001 
for both) (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, 45±5% of RBCs in venous thrombi and 44±6% in pulmonary emboli were present 
in intermediate and polyhedral-shaped forms, in contrast to only 3±1% in arterial thrombi (p<0.0001 for both). 
Surprisingly, venous thrombi had the greatest content of echinocytes (8±2%) as compared to arterial thrombi 
(0.5±0.1%) and pulmonary emboli (1.3±0.2%) (p=0.0260 and p=0.0068 respectively) (Fig. 4H).
Platelet and extracellular microvesicle content. Platelets were a major component of arterial thrombi (35±6%), 
but not of venous thrombi (2.3±0.3%) or pulmonary emboli (1.0±0.2%, p<0.0001 for both) (Fig. 4C). All 
platelets found in arterial and venous thrombi and in pulmonary emboli were activated to diferent degrees with 
accompanying shape changes, most of them present as aggregates bound to fbrin.
All thrombi also contained clearly identifed microvesicles, which may have derived from platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, or RBCs26,27. Microvesicle content was somewhat greater in arterial thrombi (5.0±0.9%) 
and pulmonary emboli (3.5±1.4%) than it was in venous thrombi (0.8±0.2%) (p=0.048, p=0.010) (Table 1; 
Fig. 4D). Tere was a strong positive correlation between the content of platelets and microvesicles in both arterial 
and venous thrombi (r=0.66, p=0.022, and r=0.87, p=0.017, respectively) and a strong negative correlation 
between the content of microvesicles and the total fbrin component (r=−0.70, p=0.05, for both arterial and 
venous thrombi). In pulmonary emboli, the correlation between microvesicles and platelets and microvesicles 
and total fbrin content was weak (r=0.19, p=0.033, and r=0.22, p=0.055, respectively).
WBC content. WBCs, identifed based on their size being larger that RBCs and their cell surface projections 
(Fig. 1H), occupied only a small volume in arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli. However, the 
content of WBCs was signifcantly greater in pulmonary emboli (6.6±3.3%) than in arterial (3.0±1.2%) and 
venous thrombi (0.5±0.2%) (p=0.044 and p=0.034, respectively) (Table 1; Fig. 4I).
Case reports. Location- and time-dependent changes in composition of arterial and venous thrombi can be 
gleaned from analyses of individual thrombi in the Case Reports section (see Supplement for details).
To answer the question whether composition and distribution of the various thrombus components depend on 
location and time of formation, we compared the head of venous thrombi, representing the oldest part attached to the 
vessel wall, with the tail, the most recently formed segment that extends in the direction of blood fow and with the middle (body) section lying between the two (Supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Te head and tail contained more fbrin than 
the body, while the body of the thrombus contained more RBCs than either the head or tail. Tere was a higher content 
of fbrin bundles in the head than in the tail. Polyhedrocytes predominated in the body of the thrombus compared with 
the head and the tail, where there were more intermediate-shaped RBCs.
Regional diferences within arterial thrombi were studied in thrombi removed surgically from abdominal aneurysms. Tose thrombi were large and were composed of many layers, much like an onion, that were separated by dissection (Supplemental Fig. S4). Te more superfcial (newer) layers were composed of a network of fber bundles having 
fairly uniform diameters, i.e. few having large or small diameters, and regular spacing of pores, while fbrin fbers in the 
older (abluminal) layers of thrombus showed a much broader distribution of diameters ranging from very thin fbers 
to very thick fber bundles, ofen with a rough surface. Similar results were seen upon examination of two arterial graf 
thrombi from the same patient, one only a few hours old and the other 2 days old.

Discussion
In the present study, the composition of arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli was characterized 
quantitatively using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Analysis and quantifcation of these images 
is extremely laborious and time consuming, since it must be done manually, taking about 3–4 hours per image 
for an experienced scientist. Consequently, not all images could be quantifed, but the conclusions were entirely 
consistent with qualitative results from examination of images from all thrombi and emboli. Te complexity of 
the study dictated several unavoidable limitations, such as the inter-observer disagreement of the order of 5–10% 
and the possibility of postmortem changes in pulmonary emboli.
Although traditionally arterial thrombi have been termed “white” and venous thrombi “red”, additional detail 
about the similarities or diference in their composition has been limited. We extended that knowledge to the 
quantitative level and show that arterial thrombi contain a surprisingly large amount of fbrin, even more than the 
volume occupied by platelets.

Our results confirm prior studies showing that the proportion of RBCs in venous thrombi and pulmonary 
emboli is considerably higher than in arterial thrombi. Compressed polyhedral RBCs, termed polyhedrocytes, and 
intermediate-shaped forms (both indicative of the intravital compaction of a thrombus mass), were also more common 
in venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli than in arterial thrombi. More fbrin bundles were observed in arterial than 
in venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli, but more individual fbrin fbers were observed in pulmonary emboli than 
in arterial and venous thrombi. WBCs were found more commonly in pulmonary emboli compared with arterial and 
venous thrombi, while microvesicles were more common in arterial thrombi and pulmonary emboli.
Tese diferences in composition may arise from the conditions under which the thrombi formed, as follows. 
Trombus structure is afected by constriction of the vessel wall, activation or damage of the endothelium, blood fow 
and shear, fbrin polymerization, platelet-platelet and platelet-fbrin interactions, and the efect of platelet contractile 
forces on fbrin fbers and cells. Arterial thrombi form under high shear rates of 500–1500s−1
, which signifcantly 
increases with stenosis as the thrombus grows, and may reach up to 250,000s−1 28,29. Increasing shear rate has a large 
impact on the fbrin network structure, promoting orientation and association of fbrin fbers into bundles30–34. We 
quantifed this orientation in some thrombi, which is in agreement with our fnding that arterial thrombi assembled at 
high shear rate contain more thick bundles (some twisted) than venous thrombi assembled at low shear rates. Arterial 
thrombi had higher platelet content, in agreement with earlier histological results35, which may contribute to fbrin 
bundle formation, since platelets pull on fbrin fbers36, decreasing the space between them, thereby promoting lateral 
association of fbers into bundles37. Another mechanistic aspect of these results is that the main structural outcomes 
of clot contraction are the redistribution of the platelets and fbrin toward the periphery of the clot and compression 
of erythrocytes in the interior of the clot, followed by their deformation into polyhedral cells that we have named “polyhedrocytes”. Tese structural signatures of clot contraction in ex vivo thrombi and thrombotic emboli derived from 
diferent vessels in human patients demonstrate that intravital contraction is common in vivo17.
Our results also confrm and extend previous studies by demonstrating that RBCs are found within arterial 
thrombi. Te relative paucity of RBCs in arterial compared with venous thrombi can be attributed primarily to 
the high shear rate, but it is notable that a large fraction of those that were present were polyhedrocytes. In addition, many balloon-shaped RBCs were evident (Fig. 1C), perhaps indicative of RBCs partially escaping from a 
contracting arterial thrombus.

Polyhedrocytes that form during clot contraction were discovered initially in clots made in vitro, but the 
present studies extend this observation by showing their presence in all clinical thrombi examined. Indeed, compressed RBCs comprised the major part of human venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli, demonstrating that 
they are not simply in vitro artifacts. Moreover, the prevalence of polyhedrocytes in thrombi is a morphological 
signature of clot contraction that is quite widespread in thrombi in vivo. Not all RBCs assumed a polyhedral 
shape, since we observed intermediate forms and balloon-like shapes as well. Tese diferences likely refect a balance between the strength of platelet-derived contractile forces and the cellular composition of the clot that resists 
contraction21. Although venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli contain fewer platelets than arterial thrombi, the 
proportion of RBCs that were polyhedrocytes was even greater than in arterial thrombi. Tis seeming paradox 
might be explained by the recently described disintegration of thrombin-activated platelets afer clot formation 
and contraction19,38 and perhaps the efect of muscle pumps from the surrounding skeletal muscles that can 
develop compression stresses up to 0.5MPa and may contribute to the compaction of thrombi39.
Surprisingly, the amount of space between structures was quite small, less than 2%, in both thrombi and 
emboli. A likely major consequence of this very small amount of space between structures is that permeability of 
pathological clots would be extremely low, much lower than would be estimated based on studies of in vitro clots, 
which may limit access of therapeutic agents and account for the limited efectiveness of thrombolysis.
Unexpectedly, venous thrombi, especially the head (oldest part), had the greatest content of echinocytes as 
compared to arterial thrombi and pulmonary emboli. Tis fnding is in agreement with some evidence that the 
transformation of RBCs into echinocytes is related to an increase in blood viscosity40,41 that may occur due to 
turbulence, stasis, as well as the resulting hypoxia or metabolic exhaustion of RBCs. Many fewer echinocytes were 
observed in pulmonary emboli and arterial thrombi, suggesting that the diference in the environment of established venous thrombi leads to a transformation to echinocytes in favor of other forms of RBCs.
Te composition of pulmonary emboli was distinctly diferent from their presumptive origin in the venous 
system. Pulmonary emboli contained a higher proportion of fbrin than venous thrombi, especially of individual 
fbers, and fewer total RBCs, especially biconcave and intermediate forms and a greater content of WBCs and 
microvesicles (Fig. 2), It is not yet clear how these diferences in composition might be related to the risk of embolization, or to changes afer embolization in vivo. Because the emboli were obtained from cadavers, some postmortem alterations could potentially afect their composition, but fresh samples could not be obtained and these 
samples were processed as soon afer death as possible; moreover, the lack of morphological signs of fbrinolysis25
reassures us that the impact of postmortem changes was limited.
Some support for the biological signifcance of these observations comes from the similarities between the 
composition of the tail of a venous thrombus from which embolization is most likely to originate, compared 
with those found in the body and head of the same thrombus (Supplemental Fig. S3D,I), although a limitation 
of this aspect of the study is that only one such thrombus was available. Te tail region of this venous thrombus, 
like the emboli, contained more fbrin and fewer RBCs than the other segments. Tese results are consistent with 
experiments in an animal model showing that the composition of venous thrombi change over time42. Initially 
RBCs were the predominant constituent of thrombi, but later fbrin increased in the head and tail, while the body 
was composed primarily of RBCs, in striking agreement with our fndings. Te bodies of venous thrombi were 
composed mostly of polyhedrocytes, whereas intermediate-shaped RBCs predominated elsewhere. Te higher 
content of fbrin fbers in the head and tail may impede the platelet contractile forces, reducing formation of polyhedrocytes. Tis may impair contractility, making this region more prone to embolization, because impaired clot 
contraction has been shown to correlate with a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with deep 
venous thromboembolism43.
Tere appear to be similarities and diferences in the aging of arterial thrombi compared with venous thrombi. 
Two independent approaches were taken to examine changes that occur in the fbrin of arterial thrombi as they 
age. Trombi associated with aortic aneurysms are composed of layers that can be separated from each other and 
likely represent diferent stages (and ages) in clot development. In addition, in the one case available for review, 
a newly formed thrombus was removed at the same time as an older thrombus, so that their structures could be 
compared. Te conclusions from both of these approaches were similar. Older arterial thrombi were denser, containing many more fbrin fbers with fewer intervening pores. Tis increase in density may reduce permeability 
through the thrombus leading to increasing resistance to fbrinolytic agents over time.
Platelets present in older thrombi were sometimes perforated by holes (Supplemental Fig. S4E) that likely arise 
from degranulation44, but most changes were observed in the structure of fbrin. In arterial thrombi, the fber 
bundles in older thrombi were much less homogeneous in diameter. Older thrombi were made up of both more 
fbers that are thicker and more fbers that are thinner, consistent with addition of fbers over time, thickening 
preexisting fbers, while those forming in the interstices would appear as thin fbers. Older portions of thrombi 
also displayed thick fber bundles with rough surfaces, in contrast to the smooth surfaces of fbers in newer 
thrombi. Te rough surfaces of fbers in older portions of a thrombus may arise from both adherent microvesicles 
and clusters of proteins that are known to bind to fbrin, such as plasminogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator, 
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, α2-antiplasmin, fbronectin, as well as DNA45–47.
Conclusions
We have characterized in detail the structure and composition of human arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli. We showed reproducible distinctive diferences among all three related to their origin and destination. Although some general results, such as arterial thrombi having the gross appearance of being “white” 
and venous thrombi being “red”, have been known for many years, there were some surprises, such as the preponderance of fbrin in all of these structures, providing a rationale for thrombolytic therapy for both arterial and 
venous thrombi. Moreover, all types contained substantial numbers of RBCs, most of which were compressed by 
platelet-driven clot contraction into polyhedrocytes and intermediate-shaped forms, with very few uncompressed

biconcave cells. Some echinocytes were present in venous thrombi, perhaps as a result of exhaustion of RBC metabolic functions over time. Tere was very little space between fbrin structures in all thrombi and emboli, far less 
than expected based on in vitro fndings, which likely reduces permeability in vivo and explains the limited efcacy of thrombolytic therapy. Tere were diferences in fbrin and RBC content between pulmonary emboli and 
deep venous thrombi, similar to diferences in the older head, middle, and younger tail of venous thrombi, which 
might relate to causes of embolization. Distinctive morphological diferences were observed in fbrin structures of 
diferent age, which can be accounted for by increasing accumulation of fbrin over time. Tese results may have 
important clinical implications for the understanding and treatment of thrombotic disorders.
Material and Methods
Clinical material and ethical aspects. Arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli were obtained 
from patients receiving standard antithrombotic treatment with no diferences in terms of gender or age. Te 
ethical aspects are described in detail in the Supplement, the “Clinical material and ethical aspects” section. Te 
study was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of University of Pennsylvania and local IRBs and Ethical 
Committees of the Institution that participated in the study. All methods were performed in accordance with the 
relevant guidelines and regulations, including informed written consent obtained from all patients.
Coronary arterial thrombi from patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (n=45), venous thrombi 
(n=25) and pulmonary emboli (n=10) were obtained as described in detail in the Supplement, the “Clinical 
material and ethical aspects” section. No morphological signs of fbrinolysis such as fbrin fbers ends and rifeness 
of fbers25 were observed in any intravitatal or postmortem samples.
Scanning electron microscopy. All thrombi and thrombotic emboli were prepared as described in detail 
in the Supplement and processed as described previously48. High-defnition micrographs were obtained from different randomly chosen areas of each thrombus or embolus to eliminate selection bias (Supplemental Fig. I) and 
examined in a Quanta 250FEG scanning electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Te predominant structures 
within these samples were identifed based on previous experience8,17,24,38,49–51, and representative images were 
assessed for all structures listed in detail in the Data Supplement.
Image quantifcation and statistical analysis. Quantitative assessment of thrombi and thrombotic 
emboli composition was carried out using the same previously used procedures7,24, which are described in detail 
the Data Supplement. Briefy, election micrographs were analyzed for each specimen individually, using a grid 
placed over each micrograph (Supplemental Fig. I). Each structural component was quantifed using an approach 
described in detail in six steps in the Data Supplement, to avoid any artifacts from any source. Te signifcance of 
the diferences in composition of the three types of samples (arterial thrombi, venous thrombi, and emboli) was 
analyzed using the Chi-square test with a 95% confdence level (p<0.05). As an independent approach, the composition of thrombi and emboli was presented as mean values averaged over all quantifed electron micrographs 
obtained for all 5 or 6 samples of thrombi/emboli. Te results of the relative volume fractions were expressed as 
a mean±standard error of the mean afer testing for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion. Tose 
data were compared statistically by a one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons 
with a 95% confdence level (p<0.05). Associations between contents of various structural components were 
assessed by the Pearson’s correlation test if the data arrays met the assumption of normality. All statistical analyses 
were carried out with GraphPad Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad Sofware, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
