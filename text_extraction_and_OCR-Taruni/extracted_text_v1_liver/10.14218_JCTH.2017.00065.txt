Abstract
Adoption of the model for end-stage liver disease score by
Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) deceased
donor liver allocation policy in 2002 has led to an increase in
the number of simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) transplantation.
Since kidney function recovery following liver transplantation
is difficult to predict, allocation of the kidney for SLK transplantation thus far has not been based on much rationale and
evidence. Lack of OPTN policy towards SLK organ allocation
has resulted in great variations among transplant centers
regarding SLK transplantation. Increasing use of kidneys
towards SLK transplantation diverts deceased donor kidneys
away from candidates awaiting kidney-alone transplantation.
Recently OPTN/United Network of Organ Sharing has implemented medical eligibility criteria for adult SLK transplantation
which also includes a concept of safety net. Implementation of
the new policy is a move in a positive direction, providing
consistency in our practice and evidence-based guidelines in
selecting candidates for SLK transplantation. This policy needs
to be monitored prospectively and modified based on new data
that will emerge over time. This review outlines the literature
on SLK transplantation and efforts towards developing rational
policy on SLK organ allocation.

Introduction
Renal dysfunction contributes to the morbidity and mortality
in liver transplant recipients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can
develop in up to 23% of patients with cirrhosis, while chronic
kidney disease (CKD) is present in 1% of such patients.1,2
Since introduction of the model for end-stage liver disease
(MELD) scoring system for organ allocation in liver transplant
candidates in 2002, the incidence of renal dysfunction among
liver transplant recipients has been significantly increasing,
contributing to an increasing trend in simultaneous liverkidney transplantation (SLK) after 2002.3–5
AKI affects 25% to 50% of liver transplant recipients, while
CKD develops in 30% to 90% and risk of end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is in
the range of 2% to 5% per year after transplantation.6 Native
kidney function recovery following liver transplantation alone
(LTA) is difficult to predict, and indications for SLK transplantation are not precisely defined. The decision to transplant SLK
has largely been center-specific and driven by the fear of persistent renal failure after LTA and its associated poor outcomes.
A recent study identified early liver allograft dysfunction, early
development of stage 3 AKI following LTA and requirement for
RRT at the time of liver transplantation as independent risk
factors for the development of ESRD within first year of LTA.7
Predictors of renal function recovery with good discrimination following LTA are poorly defined. Patients wait-listed for
kidney transplantation after nonrenal organ transplantation
have worse outcomes compared to patients waiting for kidney
transplant alone (KTA).8 Currently, the outcomes of SLK transplants are excluded from Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients, further encouraging the transplant centers to add
kidney to a high-risk liver candidate in order to buffer their
program’s outcome.4 Lack of uniform criteria for allocating
kidney to SLK has led to marked variation in the rates of SLK
transplantation among transplant centers, ranging from 0% to
44% of all liver transplants performed.9 With the increasing
trend in the number of SLK transplants has come controversy
over whether the addition of kidney allograft to liver transplant
candidates with renal dysfunction is associated with superior
long-term outcomes, or is it an unnecessary use of a limited
resource in the era of increasing organ shortage.
Impact of renal function on postliver transplant
survival
Pretransplant renal function was found in earlier studies to be
an independent predictor of survival following liver transplantation.3,5 This is particularly true among patients with serum
creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL or requiring prolonged RRT
prior to undergoing liver transplantation. Moderate and severe
renal dysfunction was reported as associated with poor graft
and patient survival following LTA in a United Network of
Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry analysis.5 In a study performed
by Gonwa et al.,
3 5-year patient survival rates following
deceased donor LTA were 79.1%, 72.2%, and 63.1% in

patients with pretransplant serum creatinine levels of 0–0.99
mg/dL, 1.0–1.99 mg/dL, and >2.0 mg/dL respectively. Corresponding survivals were 63.9% in patients who required RRT at
the time of deceased donor LTA and 69.6% in those who underwent SLK transplantation. Patients requiring RRT preoperatively had better survival with SLK transplantation compared
to deceased donor LTA. Because of the impact of renal function
on postliver transplant survival, serum creatinine was included
as a variable in the MELD scoring system.
MELD, postMELD era and need for SLK policy
MELD was developed to estimate the mortality in patients
waiting for liver transplantation and to allocate organs to the
sicker patients who would gain the most benefit from transplantation. The components of MELD score include the international normalized ratio, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine.
The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN)/
UNOS adopted the MELD scoring system in February 2002 to
facilitate liver allograft allocation to wait-listed patients based
on medical necessity in compliance with OPTN’s “Final Rule”,
which states that “allocation policies must be based on sound
medical judgment and standardized criteria, must seek to
achieve the best use of organs and must avoid futile transplants”. Since MELD score heavily weighs serum creatinine, it
has led to an increased number of patients with severe renal
dysfunction and on RRT to undergo liver transplantation.
An unintended consequence of the introduction of MELD
scoring for liver allocation in 2002 was a steady increase in SLK
transplantation, from 135 in 2000 to 731 in 2016 nationally, as
shown in Fig. 1. The question regarding the benefits of SLK over
LTA in patients with renal dysfunction then arises. Multiple
single-center studies and registry analyses aimed to address
the added benefits of the addition of a kidney transplant to
liver transplant candidates with renal dysfunction have shown
variable results.4,10,11 A matched-control analysis by Locke
et al.10 utilizing the UNOS database in 2008 failed to show
benefit of SLK transplantation over LTA despite using higher
quality allografts for SLK transplantation. This could likely be
related to the fact that kidney grafts were allocated to sicker
recipients, often with AKI, who probably developed multiorgan
disease processes that were too advanced to benefit from
either mode of transplantation. A subgroup analysis suggested
patient and liver allograft survival benefits for those SLK recipients who were on dialysis for more than 3 months prior to
transplantation as compared to LTA.10 Another study by
Gonwa et al.3 comparing the patient survival between SLK
and LTA revealed that patients on RRT at the time of liver transplantation do better with SLK than LTA.
A recent review of the literature and OPTN database
analysis regarding recipient survival with or without renal
dysfunction after SLK transplantation by Formica et al.4
showed that 37% of SLK recipients received no dialysis prior
to transplantation and out of those who received no dialysis,
40% had creatinine <2.5 mg/dL at time of transplantation.
The authors also illustrated that liver transplant candidates
with renal failure (defined by pretransplant dialysis time of
>2 months or serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL) benefited from
SLK transplantation compared to LTA. However, the outcomes
with SLK were inferior compared to those of LTA in patients
without renal dysfunction. A propensity score matched study
comparing 1884 SLK recipients with 31,882 LTA recipients transplanted from 2002 to 2009 showed a small survival benefit of
3.7 months at 5 years in patients with pretransplant nondialysisdependent CKD who underwent SLK compared to LTA.12 The
consensus finding from the registry studies is that SLK is
beneficial for those liver transplant candidates with marked
renal dysfunction, or for those who have been on prolonged
pretransplant dialysis.3,4,11
Kidney allograft survival is remarkably inferior in SLK
recipients as compared to KTA.4,10,13 In fact, the review by
Schinzler et al.14 showed that any of the kidney allografts
that failed following SLK transplantation in the MELD era
would have added a graft lifespan of 7.2 years, if transplanted
to a candidate on KTA wait-list. OPTN policy prioritizes organ
allocation to multiorgan candidates before kidney-alone candidates when the candidate is in the same donor service area as
the donor.4 A paired kidney analysis of multiorgan transplantation by Choudhary et al.13 demonstrated inferior survival when
a kidney is allocated to an SLK recipient compared to the contralateral mate kidney allocated to KTA. Kidneys used for SLK
transplants have lower kidney donor profile index (KDPI) and
thus have higher expected longevity.15 Among the SLK transplants, 49% of donor kidneys had a KDPI <35%, that would
likely be offered to pediatric patients on the KTA waitlist. On an
average, 250 high-quality donor kidneys per year are being
utilized by SLK transplants that otherwise would have been
offered to one of the prioritized groups on the KTA wait-list,
such as pediatric, young adult or highly sensitized patients.
It is not entirely clear which patients with renal dysfunction
would benefit from SLK. Centers err on the side of caution
while selecting candidates for SLK, as it is hard to predict if
the renal dysfunction prior to liver transplant is reversible or
not. There have not been standard medical criteria for the
evaluation of patients with renal dysfunction in advanced liver
disease requiring liver transplantation.
Is renal dysfunction irreversible in a potential liver
transplant candidate?
The decision whether a liver transplant candidate with renal
dysfunction should receive SLK versus LTA depends on the
ability to predict whether the kidney disease is reversible or
not. Renal function is commonly assessed by using a serum
creatinine-based formula to calculate glomerular filtration rate
(GFR), which is not very reliable in patients with liver disease.
Muscle mass, proximal tubular secretion and medications can
affect serum creatinine level. For instance, trimethoprim

Hussain S.M. et al: Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation

increases serum creatinine level by affecting tubular creatinine
secretion without altering GFR.
In patients with chronic liver disease, the relatively lower
serum creatinine is related to poor muscle mass, decreased
hepatic conversion of creatine to creatinine, and increased
volume of distribution due to the accumulation of extracellular
fluid, all of which can lead to overestimation of GFR when
creatinine-based equations are used. In addition, elevated
serum bilirubin interacts with creatinine assay, giving falsely
low serum creatinine results. The relatively low serum creatinine
can mask the drop in GFR in this patient population. This effect is
even more pronounced in women, who generally have lower
muscle mass to begin with, resulting in over-estimation of GFR.
Different creatinine-based GFR estimation equations are
available, such as the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the modification of diet in renal diseases (MDRD) study equation and the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
equation. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is based on the
assumption that creatinine production decreases with advancing age and is higher in individuals with greater weight but
does not take into account obesity with increased body fat.
This equation has not been revised for use with creatinine
values traceable to standardized reference. The MDRD equation was primarily derived from white subjects with nondiabetic kidney disease and is less accurate in populations
with normal or near-normal GFR. The CKD-EPI equation is
more accurate than the MDRD equation at higher levels of GFR
and in subgroups defined by sex, race, diabetes and transplant
status, older age and higher body mass index.
Cystatin C–based equations may be superior to serum
creatinine in estimating GFR, as they are not affected by
muscle mass, but the cystatin C assay may not be readily
available.16 Combining both serum creatinine and cystatin C
into a single equation can provide more precise estimated
GFR compared to equations that use cystatin C or creatinine
alone. The best methods for assessment of GFR in patients with
cirrhosis depend on the clearance of exogenous markers, such
as iothalamate, 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and
inulin, but these measurements are expensive, laborious and
not readily available. In addition, the clearances of exogenous
markers to estimate GFR have not been thoroughly studied in
patients with advanced liver disease and ascites.
It is crucial to differentiate AKI from CKD in liver transplant
candidates. CKD defined as GFR <60 mL/min for 3 months or
longer can be present in patients with chronic liver disease.
Recently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized
as a risk factor for CKD.17 Many patients with nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease also have underlying diabetes mellitus. Patients
with hepatitis C and B might have coexisting glomerulonephritis. AKI in advanced liver disease is commonly due to three
main etiologies: prerenal, hepatorenal syndrome, and acute
tubular necrosis. Differentiating between these etiologies has
important implications towards management and prognosis.
For instance, hepatorenal syndrome is a reversible functional
renal injury to the kidneys in the setting of advanced liver
disease, which does not generally qualify for the SLK transplant. AKI is also common following liver transplantation and
is multifactorial in etiology, ranging from acute tubular necrosis
due to hemodynamic instability to drug toxicity.
During the immediate postliver transplant period, about
8% to 17% of patients require RRT.16 About 68% recovered
renal function, defined as removal from RRT without death or
need for renal transplantation after liver transplantation, who
were on RRT at the time of transplantation.18 The majority of
patients who recovered renal function were on RRT for
<30 days in the pretransplant period. Ojo et al.19 utilized
registry data on nonrenal transplant recipients and found an
18% incidence of CKD at 5 years after liver transplantation.
Ruebner et al.20 looked at the risk of developing ESRD among
patients with renal dysfunction at the time of liver transplantation. The highest risk for developing ESRD at 3 years after
LTA was 31% in those with eGFR consistently <30 mL/min.
At 3 years after LTA, only 6% of patients who had received
short-term dialysis before transplantation were still on dialysis.
LTA recipients who required pretransplant RRT for <30 days
are likely to recover renal function spontaneously postliver
transplant, whereas those on RRT for >90 days do not.21
Previous studies have attempted to generate equations
based on several candidate variables in order to predict the
development of postliver transplant ESRD with good discrimination and C-statistics ranging from 0.74–0.76.22,23 Commonly cited predictors of ESRD development following LTA
include duration and severity of CKD, level of chronicity on
kidney biopsy, recipient age, duration of diabetes and hepatitis C virus status. A renal biopsy is gold standard to assess
the chronicity of the kidney disease but carries increased
bleeding risk in a cirrhotic patient with coagulopathy. Progression of underlying renal disease can be correlated with the
degree of interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. In one study, 59 liver transplant candidates with
renal impairment underwent kidney biopsy and SLK was recommended for patients with >40% global glomerulosclerosis,
>30% interstitial fibrosis or requiring dialysis for >2 months.
Based on these criteria, 70% of listed patients did not
undergo SLK; twenty-three ultimately underwent LTA and
ten patients underwent SLK. There were no differences in
renal function and survival at 1 year. Biopsy-related complications developed only in two patients.24
Principles involved in designing an SLK allocation
system
Attempts have been made by different societies involving
transplant surgery, hepatology and nephrology to come up
with SLK allocation, as summarized in Table 1. These policies
have sought to address the following areas: i) most accurate
and cost-effective way to measure renal function and diagnose kidney disease in patients with cirrhosis; ii) predictors of
irreversible kidney function in candidates being evaluated for
simultaneous liver kidney transplant; iii) impact of kidney
after liver transplantation on the outcomes in patients with
persistent renal dysfunction following LTA.
Proposed new policy for SLK allocation
In order to develop a proposal for policy on SLK allocation,
Formica et al.4 analyzed the OPTN database to evaluate the
characteristics of SLK recipients, outcomes in patients with
and without kidney disease after liver transplantation, waitlist survival in those awaiting primary kidney transplantation
versus those waiting for kidney after liver transplantation, and
kidney graft survival following KTA versus SLK transplantation.
The authors concluded that patients with liver transplantation
with renal failure defined as pretransplant dialysis duration
>2 months or serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL benefited from
SLK, whereas SLK could be detrimental for those without
renal failure. The proposal included the medical eligibility criteria
Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 289–295 291
Hussain S.M. et al: Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation

for SLK transplant and the concept of a safety net for liver
recipients who develop ESRD shortly after LTA.
Medical eligibility criteria for SLK transplantation includes
patients with CKD, sustained AKI and metabolic disease. CKD
was defined as estimated GFR of <60 mL/min for >90 days
prior to listing and an estimated GFR of <35 mL/min at the
time of listing or ESRD on maintenance dialysis. The rationale
for suggesting a higher GFR cut-off for SLK listing is based on
the data showing a 30% frequency of ESRD over 3 years in
patients who had an GFR <30 mL/min at the time of liver
transplantation.20 Moreover, the addition of calcineurin inhibitor to the immunosuppressive regimen in patients with low
GFR results in a further reduction in GFR, by at least 10 mL/min,
soon after transplantation, bringing the GFR closer to the GFR
requirement for KTA listing.27,28 Sustained AKI was defined as
the requirement for acute dialysis for 6 weeks or longer, an
estimated GFR <25 mL/min for 6 weeks or more or a combination of dialysis and estimated GFR <25 mL/min for 6 consecutive weeks duration.
The concept of a safety net is an essential component of the
proposed policy. This stems from the evidence that survival of
LTA recipients on the kidney wait-list is inferior to those listed
for first KTA. However, those prior LTA recipients who developed
kidney failure and received a kidney transplant within 3 years of
the liver transplant had long-term survival that was similar to
KTA recipients. It was proposed that any LTA recipient who is
registered for the kidney wait-list between 60 to 365 days
postliver transplant with either ESRD or GFR #20 mL/min
should be prioritized. It will not be applicable to SLK recipients,
unless they meet the definition of primary kidney nonfunction
(defined as being on dialysis or estimated GFR #20 mL/min)
90 days after SLK transplantation. The current UNOS criteria for
simultaneous liver kidney transplantation including “safety net”
are shown in Table 2. This policy went into effect as of August
10, 2017.29
Another feature added to the policy was inclusion of regional
sharing of kidneys in SLK transplant for patients with MELD
scores $35. Prior to implementation of this SLK policy, patients
requiring SLK transplant are likely to have MELD scores $35
and are eligible for regional sharing for liver but not for kidney
under the new kidney allocation policy. Thus, physicians were
forced to make a choice of either waiting for SLK when offered
locally or to simply accept liver-alone through regional sharing
for patients with high MELD score.
Predicted outcomes from the proposed and recently
implemented SLK policy
The policy proposed for SLK by Formica et al.30 is a first step
towards optimizing the use of a scarce resource. The intent of
the policy is to standardize the allocation of kidney allograft in
liver transplant recipients based on medical eligibility. Adoption of new criteria can reduce variability in center-wise practice patterns, better benchmarking of practice and further
refinement of SLK allocation recommendations.30
The key feature of this policy of requiring a safety net will
allow patients who suffer from ESRD soon after liver transplantation timely access to kidney transplantation. It is hoped
that this will decrease the physician’s rushed and erratic
conclusion to add kidney allograft in prospective liver transplant recipients with potentially reversible renal dysfunction
and relieve the clinicians of the burden of a wrong decision.
Almost 15–20% of LTA candidates have an estimated
GFR <30 mL/min and another 20–30% have an estimated
GFR <60 mL/min at the time of liver transplant evaluation.6,22
The risk of ESRD at 1 year from LTA is minimal, even in

recipients with listing estimated GFR <35 mL/min who were not
on RRT at the time of transplantation.31,32 Hence, one could
argue the medical eligibility criteria of GFR <35 mL/min at the
time of listing in the proposed policy as liberal. There is possibility of abuse with these criteria for listing of SLK if there is one
time documentation of GFR <35 mL/min. There is also concern
that this policy might in fact further increase the rate of SLK
transplantation.33 It is also possible that the new criteria could
potentially decrease the number of SLK transplants performed,
since 19% all SLK transplants performed between 2014 and
2015 did not meet current proposed criteria.
Proven factors for CKD, such as the presence of long standing
pretransplant diabetes or proteinuria, were not incorporated in
the proposed policy.34 More controversial and liberal is the AKI
definition in the policy.30 These patients comprise about 40% of
all SLK transplantations. Less than 10% of patients with LTA are
on dialysis in the first year of transplantation, indicating that
many recover native renal function.22 Asch et al.30 also propose
the concept of futility to be added to the policy, where organs are
not being offered to patients with poor projected survival.30
The proposed policy of SLK is based on the tenet of urgency,
which contradicts the new kidney allocation system based on
the tenet of utility. SLK transplantation exemplifies the tradeoff
between the principle of utility and medical urgency, as shown
by a recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database analysis that compared kidney allograft life span in SLK
recipients to donor-matched kidneys transplanted as KTA or
simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation. The adjusted
10-year mean kidney allograft life span was higher in KTA and
simultaneous pancreas kidney recipients compared with SLK
recipients by 0.99 years in the MELD era and 1.71 years in the
preMELD era. In other words, about 1 year of renal allograft life
span is traded with SLK transplantation, so that a sicker patient
gains access to organs.35
The proposed policy for SLK transplantation does not
address the current multiorgan transplantation policy, which
conflicts with the OPTN’s “final rule” based on sound medical
judgment to ensure equity and efficacy in organ allocation.
The current multiorgan transplant policy provides kidney
allocation with another organ, regardless of the degree and
duration of renal dysfunction, potential of kidney function
recovery and the survival benefit of the addition of kidney.34
A recent study by Ekser et al.,
36 described a novel idea of
delaying the kidney allograft for >48 h in patients undergoing
combined liver kidney transplantation.36 Liver transplantation
is first performed while the kidney allograft is placed on the
hypothermic pulsatile machine in order to allow time to stabilize the patient’s hemodynamics and normalize coagulopathy
before implantation of the kidney allograft, thus reducing the
risk for delayed graft function development and optimizing the
renal allograft function. This approach was associated with
superior graft and patient survival rates during the 4 year
follow-up. This could also avoid the wastage of kidney allograft
in high-risk liver transplant patients.
Finally, the interesting question as to whether liver is
immune-protective to the kidney in the setting of SLK transplantation has been asked. A recent study looked at the
incidence of kidney allograft rejection between SLK (n = 68)
and KTA (n = 136) recipients, utilizing protocol renal transplant
biopsies.37 Pretransplant donor-specific antibodies were
present in 20.5% of the patients in both groups. Among patients
with donor-specific antibodies, there was higher incidence of
antibody-mediated rejection (46.4% vs. 7.1%) and transplant
glomerulopathy (53.6% vs. 0%) in KTA versus SLK recipients.

Hussain S.M. et al: Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation

Among patients with no donor-specific antibodies, KTA recipients experienced higher incidence of T cell-mediated rejection
(30.6 % vs. 7.4%) and declining renal allograft function, while
SLK recipients has stable GFR. This suggests a protective effect
of liver allograft against chronic immunologic injury.

are summarized in Table 3. The decision to perform SLK transplant rather than LTA is important because the benefits to the
patient with liver disease of receiving a kidney transplant must
be balanced with the downside of not being able to use that
organ for a patient with ESRD. Inappropriate utilization of this
scarce resource may be detrimental to the ever-growing population of patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Furthermore, the kidney grafts that are transplanted into SLK
recipients are from higher quality donors, emphasizing more
on appropriate allocation of the best deceased donor kidneys.
Although the MELD score was designed to reduce wait-list mortality, kidney or liver transplant futility among SLK transplant
recipients with the highest level of acuity should not be overlooked. Although not yet readily available in many centers,
cystatin C-based equations may allow clinicians to better
select the most appropriate candidates for SLK or LTA.
Implementation of the new policy is a move in a positive
direction, providing consistency in our practice and evidencebased guidelines in selecting candidates for SLK transplantation. This policy needs to be monitored prospectively and
modified based on new data that will emerge over time.

Table 3. Key points
 Reduced kidney function is a predictor of adverse outcomes in liver transplant
recipients
 Burden of kidney disease is relatively high in patients with liver disease
awaiting transplantation
 Number of SLK transplantation is on the rise since the introduction of the
MELD scoring system for liver allocation in 2002
 Indications for SLK transplantation are not precisely defined with center-wide
practice variation
 Measuring kidney function with serum creatinine level has significant limitation
in patients with liver disease in whom cystatin-C-based equations may be more
reliable but not widely available
 Kidneys used in SLK allocation tend to have lower KDPI which would otherwise
have been allocated to pediatric patients on the waiting list for kidney alone
transplantation
 There is a great need for the standardization of kidney allograft allocation for
SLK transplantation in order to balance the benefits of this procedure with
the downside of not being able to utilize that kidney for a patient awaiting
kidney-alone transplantation
 The newly proposed and recently implemented policy includes medical
eligibility criteria for SLK allocation and a concept of “safety net” for those
liver recipients who develop ESRD shortly after transplantation along with a
recommendation for regional sharing of kidneys for SLK transplantation
 This policy is a step in the right direction and should be modified based on
new data that will emerge after its implementation
