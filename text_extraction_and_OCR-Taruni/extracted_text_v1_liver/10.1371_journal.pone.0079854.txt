Abstract
Background: Even with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), patients are often ineligible for surgical
resection, transplantation, or local ablation due to advanced cirrhosis, donor shortage, or difficult location.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been established as a standard treatment option for patients with
stage I lung cancer, who are not eligible for surgery, and may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with
small HCC who are not eligible for curative treatment.
Materials and Methods: A registry database of 93 patients who were treated with SBRT for HCC between 2007 and
2009 was analyzed. A dose of 10-20 Gy per fraction was given over 3-4 consecutive days, resulting in a total dose of
30-60 Gy. The tumor response was determined using dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging, which was performed 3 months after completion of SBRT.
Results: The median follow-up period was 25.6 months. Median size of tumors was 2 cm (range: 1-6 cm). Overall
patients’ survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 86.0% and 53.8%, respectively. Complete and partial tumor response
were achieved in 15.5% and 45.7% of patients, respectively. Local recurrence-free survival rate was 92.1% at 3
years. Most local failures were found in patients with HCCs > 3 cm, and local control rate at 3 years was 76.3% in
patients with HCC > 3 cm, 93.3% in patients with tumors between 2.1-3 cm, and 100% in patients with tumors ≤ 2
cm, respectively. Out-of-field intrahepatic recurrence-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 51.9% and 32.4%,
respectively. Grade ≥ 3 hepatic toxicity was observed in 6 (6.5%).
Conclusions: SBRT was effective in local control of small HCC. SBRT may be a promising alternative treatment for
patients with small HCC which is unsuitable for other curative therapy.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of death from cancer worldwide [1]. Current practice
guidelines recommend hepatic resection, liver transplantation,
and percutaneous ablation as curative treatment options [2].
However, hepatic resection can only be offered to 10% to 30%
of patients at diagnosis because of various clinical reasons [3],
and the use of liver transplantation is also very limited due to
the lack of donors and stringent indications. Although
percutaneous ablative therapy, including radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), can
also be used with curative intent for the treatment of small HCC
which is unsuitable for surgery, this ablative therapy cannot be
safely performed when HCC lesions are positioned at deep
locations, near to the bile duct or large vessel, at the top of the
dome, or are undetectable by ultrasound. Therefore, alternative
non-invasive local therapeutic modalities are indispensable in
these clinical settings.
Recent improvements in radiotherapy techniques, including
the conformal delivery of radiation, techniques that account for
respiratory motion, image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and
information on partial volume liver tolerance, allow the delivery
of higher doses of radiation to these tumors than previously
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79854

thought possible, thereby allowing radiotherapy to be used as
an alternative option for treating HCC [4]. Of the available
radiotherapy options, stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) has emerged as a non-invasive local treatment option
for patients with HCC when established curative treatment
modalities cannot be applied. Although prospective studies
remain sparse at this time, many previous clinical studies have
reported SBRT to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of
HCC [5-8].
In our current study, we report our clinical experiences with
SBRT as an alternative treatment for small, unresectable HCC
and evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of this highly
sophisticated treatment modality.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Asan Medical Center, and informed consent in writing was
obtained from each patient in the study.
Patients
Patients who were treated with SBRT for primary or recurrent
HCC were registered and the database was retrospectively
reviewed between March 2007 and December 2009. Eligibility
criteria for the present study included the following: (1) the
HCC lesion was not suitable for surgery due to liver cirrhosis,
no sufficient remnant liver for resection after previous surgery,
and patients’ refusal of surgery; (2) the HCC was located in
liver surface, near to the bile duct or large vessels, or at the top
of the dome where percutaneous ablative therapies cannot be
safely performed; (3) the HCC was confined to the liver without
extrahepatic metastases; (4) the HCC was < 6 cm across its
longest diameter, and ≤ 3 lesions were present; (5) the HCC
demonstrated no evidence of major vascular invasions; (6) liver
function was classified as Child-Pugh class A or B; (7) an
adequate residual functional liver volume was evident (> 700
cc); (8) there was a sufficient distance (> 2 cm) between the
HCC and adjacent organs at risk, such as the duodenum,
stomach, colon, and spinal cord; (9) an incomplete response
after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or unsuitable for
TACE due to the lesion non-visibility on hepatic angiogram;
and (10) no prior history of external beam radiotherapy.
In all of our patients, the diagnosis of HCC was based on (1)
histological confirmation; or (2) a characteristic tumor
appearance by at least two imaging studies (including dynamic
computed tomography (CT) scans, dynamic enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and angiograms);
and (3) the presence of risk factors, including hepatitis B virus,
hepatitis C virus infection and cirrhosis.
Simulation and target volume delineations
At least one week before CT simulation, we implanted three
gold seeds (CIVCO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA, USA) into
the liver parenchyma around the tumor under sonographic
guidance in almost every patient. The gold seeds were not
implanted in some patients who had surgical clips or compact
iodized oil, which still remained after previous treatments. All
patients were immobilized in the supine position using a
vacuum cushion, and while freely breathing 4-dimensional (4D)
CT scanning was performed using 16-slice CT system (GE
LightSpeed RT 16; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). A
Real-time Position Management respiratory gating system was
used to record the patients’ breathing patterns (Varian Medical
Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). All CT datasets were sorted into
10 phase bins that corresponded to the respiratory phase using
4D imaging software (Advantage 4D; GE Healthcare).
The gross tumor volume (GTV), as determined by dynamic
enhanced CT or MRI, included an enhanced mass at the endexpiratory phase of the CT image (50% phase). No GTV to
clinical target volume margin was added for taking into account
subclinical extension. The internal target volume (ITV) was
delineated as the sum of the individual GTVs, as defined within
the gated phases of respiration (usually 30-70% phase). The
planning target volume (PTV) was expanded to include a 0.5-
cm margin from the ITV. The whole and normal liver, both
kidneys, spinal cord, duodenum, and stomach were delineated
and 3- dimensionally reconstructed.
Treatment planning and delivery
SBRT planning was performed using a 3-dimensional
radiotherapy planning system (Eclipse; Varian Medical
Systems) that used multiple static conformal beams with
energies of 6- or 15-MV photons. A dose of 10-20 Gy (median:
15 Gy) per fraction was given over 3-4 consecutive days,
resulting in a total dose of 30-60 Gy (median: 45 Gy) being
administered to the isodose line covering the PTV. The total
dose was mainly determined based on general dosing
guidelines after determining the dose to be administered to the
normal liver, including the following: (1) the maximum dose
allowed to 700 cc of normal liver was estimated to be 15 Gy in
three fractions: and (2) the mean dose administered to normal
liver was not to exceed 13 Gy in three fractions [9,10]. Dose
limitations to other critical structures included the following: 2
cc of the esophagus or large bowel were to be limited to a total
dose of < 21 Gy, 2 cc of the stomach or duodenum were to be
limited to a total dose of < 18 Gy, and 2 cc of the spinal cord
were to be limited to a total dose of 18 Gy.
Image guidance was performed in two stages before
administering each fraction of SBRT using On-Board Imager
(Varian Medical Systems). First, cone-beam CT was done and
3D matching was performed. Second, gated fluoroscopy was
performed in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions to
confirm the marker positions at the end-exhale phase.
Evaluation and statistics
All patients were examined during SBRT to assess acute
toxicity. After treatment, regular follow-up examinations were
performed at 2-3 month intervals. A review of each patient’s
prior medical history, physical examinations, complete blood
counts, biochemical profiles, tumor markers, and imaging
studies were performed at each follow-up. Adverse effects
related to SBRT were graded according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 3.0).
Radiation-induced hepatic toxicity was also graded according
SBRT for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79854

to CTCAE or any decline in liver function using Child-Pugh
score in the absence of documented progressive disease
within three months after SBRT.
Tumor response was defined at three months after the
completion of SBRT according to both the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST version
1.1) and the modified RECIST with the consensus of two
radiologists (KSY and PMJ). Local failure was defined as the
recurrence of the treated lesion, intrahepatic recurrence was
defined as recurrence within the liver outside the treated lesion,
and extrahepatic metastasis was defined as recurrent disease
at any site outside the liver. For local recurrence, the presence
of wash-out on the portal and delayed phase images or
increase in volume within the irradiated hepatic parenchyma
was considered as such.
Overall and recurrence-free survivals were estimated from
the date of the start of SBRT to the date of death, the last
follow-up examination, or to the date of tumor recurrence,
respectively. The probability of cumulative survival was
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Correlation
between tumor sizes and radiation doses was performed using
Spearman correlation analysis. In addition, the existence of a
variable-effect relationship was confirmed by logistic regression
analysis. These analyses were performed using SPSS (version
12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 129 patients with HCC who were treated with
SBRT were registered between March 2007 and December
2009 at our institution. Among these, 28 patients were not
included in our current analysis for the various reasons in
Figure 1. The remaining 93 patients (103 lesions) met all of the
enrollment criteria and were included in this analysis (Table 1).
The study population was mostly male (80.6%), demonstrating
a median age of 61 years (range: 42-86 years). Sixty-nine
patients had liver function of Child-Pugh class A, and median
tumor size was 2 cm. Eighty-nine (95.7%) patients were
identified to have liver cirrhosis. Only 1 patient was treatmentnaïve, and all other patients had received various courses of
previous therapies, including hepatic resection, TACE, RFA, or
PEI before receiving SBRT. However, additional locoregional
treatments were not performed on recurrent or residual viable
HCCs if salvage SBRT was considered for the lesion. Before
CT simulation, 88 patients (94.6%) were implanted with 3 gold
seeds to serve as fiducial markers for IGRT.
Overall survival and tumor response
The median follow-up period for all patients was 25.6 months
(range: 1.8–55.4 months). At the time of analysis, 51 patients
were alive and 42 patients were deceased. The causes of
death were as follows: intrahepatic or extrahepatic tumor
progression in 29, progression of liver cirrhosis in 8, other
comorbidity in 2, complications after the following treatment in
1, and unknown cause(s) in 2. The 1 and 3 years overall
survival rates were 86.0% and 53.8%, respectively (Figure 2).
CT or MRI at 3 months after SBRT was evaluated in 91
patients (101 lesions). Of these, 16 (15.5%) achieved complete
response, 47 (45.7%) achieved partial response, and 38
(36.9%) achieved stable disease, yielding an objective
response rate of 61.2% according to the RECIST criteria (Table
2). Using the modified RECIST criteria, however, 53 (51.5%)
achieved complete response, 22 (21.4%) achieved partial
response, and 26 (25.2%) achieved stable disease, yielding an
objective response rate of 72.9% (Table 2). No progressive
disease was observed in the treated HCCs.
Patterns of failure and recurrence after SBRT
Seven local failures were recorded at the time of analysis.
Intrahepatic (i.e., out-of-field) recurrence was the main cause of
failure (58 of 92 patients), and distant metastasis developed in
20 patients during the follow-up periods. Local control rates at
1 and 3 years were 94.8% and 92.1%, respectively (Figure 3A),
and distant metastasis-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were
87.9% and 72.2%, respectively (Figure 3B). However,
intrahepatic recurrence-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years
were 51.9% and 32.4%, respectively (Figure 3C)
The incidence of local failure was significantly related to
tumor size. Most local failures were found in patients with
HCCs > 3 cm, and local control rate at 3 years was 76.3% in
patients with HCC > 3 cm, 93.3% in patients with tumors
between 2.1-3 cm, and 100% in patients with tumors ≤ 2 cm,
respectively (p=0.001) (Figure 4). There was no significant
correlation between tumor sizes and radiation doses (p=0.078).
Logistic regression analysis also revealed that the tumor size
was the only significant factor determining the local tumor
control (p=0.001). Other variables, such as the age, Child-Pugh
score, pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein level, and radiation dose
were not significant factors.
Additional treatment after SBRT for New Recurrent
Lesions
After the diagnosis of new recurrences, 65 patients received
various types of additional treatments, including locoregional
treatments for intrahepatic recurrences (e.g., segmentectomy,
TACE, PEI, RFA, SBRT) or treatments for distant metastases
(e.g., sorafenib, metastatectomy, SBRT for metastatic lesions,
palliative external beam radiotherapy). Liver transplantation
was performed in 7 patients. Of these, 4 patients received
transplantation for the treatment of liver cirrhosis without tumor
recurrence and 3 patients received transplantation in
combination with other loco-regional treatments after
intrahepatic recurrence.
Treatment-related toxicity
Symptomatic complications, including septic shock, due to
the insertion of the gold seeds occurred in 1 patient. However,
this individual recovered well before the start of SBRT with
supportive care. All patients received the planned SBRT
regimen with no interruptions due to intolerable side effects.
Fatigue and anorexia were the most common acute toxicities,
but these were mostly CTCAE grade 1. Grade ≥ 3 hepatic
toxicities, without progression of intrahepatic HCC, which may
have been related to radiation, were observed in 6 (6.5%)
SBRT for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79854

patients within 3 months of SBRT and are summarized in Table
3. The main patterns of hepatic toxicities were elevations in
serum liver enzyme levels or bilirubin levels. Nine (9.7%)
patients also experienced an elevation in the Child-Pugh score
to > 2 within 3 months of SBRT. Of these, one patient, who
experienced grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, died due to hepatic
failure at 2 months after the completion of SBRT. However, it
was difficult to differentiate the cause of hepatic failure from
SBRT or other unrevealed reasons, because the treated tumor
was small (1.5 cm), also located in the liver dome area, and the
liver function was good (Child-Pugh class A). The remainder of
the patients showed improved or stable liver function during the
follow-up period. Both the pretreatment Child-Pugh class and
the radiation dose were not correlated with the grade ≥ 3
hepatic toxicities in logistic regression analyses (p=0.081 and
p=0.153, respectively). There was no gastrointestinal
complication such as bleeding or perforation, during the followup periods. Two patients developed rib fractures that did not
require any specific treatment at 12 months and 18 months
after SBRT, respectively. In these cases, the PTV included a
portion of the fractured ribs. The total dose to those ribs was 30
Gy and 45 Gy, in three fractions, respectively. Biliary stricture
developed in 1 patient, whose tumor was located in the central
liver (segment 4), at 26 months after SBRT.
Discussion
Hepatic resection is the primary curative treatment for HCC.
Due to advances in surgical techniques and improvements in
postoperative management, the 5-year survival rate has
increased to about 70%, especially for small HCCs < 5 cm in
diameter [11]. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of patients
with HCC can undergo hepatic resection. For patients with
early-stage HCC who are not suitable for surgery,
percutaneous ablative therapy is another curative treatment
option. Although, randomized trials comparing hepatic
resection and RFA for the treatment of HCC reach different
conclusions [12-14], RFA can achieve satisfactory local control
rates and similar survival outcomes compared with hepatic
resection, demonstrating 5-year survival rates of 50-75% in
patients with liver function that is classified as Child-Pugh class
A [15]. Based on these clinical outcomes, the recently updated

Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guideline recommended ablative
therapy as the curative treatment option for very early-stage
HCC [16]. However, in some cases RFA cannot be safely and
effectively performed, just like surgical resection. Therefore,
there is an opportunity for SBRT to be performed on these
selected HCC cases.
Here, we reported a very high local recurrence-free survival
rate of 92.1% at 3 years. Many previous studies have reported
2 or 3 years local progression-free survival rates that range
from 66.4% to 90% [5,6,17-19]. Although, these results cannot
be directly compared due to the different inclusion criteria and
prescribed doses, our results show that tumor ablation is
possible using high dose of radiation and precision
radiotherapy techniques. We assume that thorough IGRT is
one of the most important ways to obtain a high local control
rate over a long follow-up duration. In our series, most of
patients were implanted with 3 gold seeds and pretreatment
verification of the marker positions was conducted using 2

separate processes before the administration of each fraction
to each patient. Even though pretreatment verifications are
eagerly performed, there are still various uncertainties
regarding to the respiration during treatment time. In
consideration of our lower cumulative incidence of local failure,
our PTV setup margin can cover the intrafractional respiratory
uncertainties. In addition, a high local control rate may be
associated with the inclusion of relatively small-sized tumors in
this study.
In the present study cohort, the incidence of local recurrence
was significantly related to tumor size. Although, there were
some different size criteria compared with previously reported

results for SBRT, other authors have also reported a
relationship between tumor size and the local control rate.
Kwon et al. reported that patients with a tumor volume < 32 cc
demonstrate better in-field tumor responses and in-field
progression-free survival rates than those with tumor volumes
≥ 32 cc [6]. Andolino et al. have reported a local control rate at
2 years of 90%, exceeding the local control rate of 65% at 1
year that was reported by Tse et al. They explained that the
higher median total dose and higher median tumor volume
contributed to the differences in the local control rates [5,8]. In
other RFA series, very similar findings were observed,
indicating that the local tumor control rate decreases as the
tumor size increases [20,21]. All of these findings may be
related to the prognostic significance of small-size HCCs. In a
previous surgical series, it was revealed that large tumor size is
a biological predictor of poor clinical prognosis, demonstrating
a higher incidence of occult vascular invasion and advanced
histological grade [22]. Therefore, care must be taken when
treating HCCs > 3 cm, and prospective studies are needed to
clarify the relationship between radiation dose escalation,
target volume expansion, and the control of microscopic
invasion. However, most HCC patients suffer from chronic liver
disease, including liver cirrhosis, and have a limited functional
normal liver volume. This may be an obstacle to performing
studies on dose escalation because of the risks of hepatic
toxicity following high-dose radiotherapy.
In our present analysis, the 3-year survival rate was 53.8%
for patients with small, recurrent HCC. This result is
comparable or slightly higher survival rates than that of other
previously reported studies on SBRT [5,6,17,19]. Because
SBRT was used as a salvage treatment following various
locoregional therapies in most previously reported studies, it is
difficult to compare the survival outcomes of SBRT, resection,
and RFA when they are used as the initial treatment modalities.
In the case of recurrent HCC following hepatectomy, repeated
resection demonstrates slightly better survival outcomes than
RFA, and the results of RFA are comparable to those of SBRT
[23]. To the best of our knowledge, no standard treatment has
been established for recurrent HCC; SBRT can be a good
treatment option for patients with recurrent HCC and can
achieve comparable survival outcomes to other aggressive
salvage treatment options.
The primary failure pattern was intrahepatic recurrence and
the 3-year intrahepatic recurrence-free survival rate was only
32.4%. Although HCC recurrence rates vary across earlier
studies, recurrence outside the radiation field is the main cause
of failure in previously published reports on SBRT [5,6,17].
Recently, a very similar rate of intrahepatic recurrence was
reported following the administration of salvage
hypofractionated radiotherapy to patients with recurrent small
HCC [24]. The authors suggested that intrahepatic recurrence
might occur because patients received salvage radiotherapy at
a more advanced disease state even if the recurrent tumor was
small [24]. In our present study, most patients, except 1
individual who received SBRT as the initial treatment modality,
were also treated with a median number of 5 courses (range
1-18) of locoregional therapies before SBRT, including
resection, TACE, PEI, or RFA. Therefore, particular attention
should be paid to interpreting the intrahepatic recurrence rates
between studies. Moreover, in order to overcome the
limitations of these clinical settings, trials are needed that
assess the efficacy of various combinations of SBRT and other
systemic treatment modalities including sorafenib.
Grade ≥ 3 hepatic toxicities were observed in 6.5% of
patients within 3 months after the SBRT and most patients
showed improved or stable liver function without a serious
hepatic damage during the follow-up period. This incidence
may be acceptable, compared with that of the previous studies
(range, 0-25.8%) [5-8,17,18]. Among the patients who
experienced the hepatic toxicities, one patient died due to the
hepatic failure at 2 months after the treatment similar to those
reported by Mendez Romero et al. [7]. However, the cause of
this hepatic failure is difficult to pin down precisely. The hepatic
function may be affected by various causes in patients with
chronic liver disease, as we are all well aware, this event may
be quite difficult to explain as what the real cause is. Although
the risk factors for the hepatic damage were not found in the
present study, the pretreatment Child-Pugh class is one of the
important factors in predicting the hepatic toxicities according
to the previous reports. Therefore, more attention could be

given in prescribing the total dose for patients with Child-Pugh
B cirrhosis [5,7,25]. Moreover, additional efforts aimed at
finding the clinical and dose-volumetric parameters to predict
the risk of hepatic toxicities in a large series of HCC patients
treated with SBRT are needed.
In conclusion, the SBRT is a noninvasive and an excellent
ablative treatment modality for patients with small, primary/
recurrent HCC. Our current results indicate that SBRT can be a
good alternative modality for the treatment of small HCCs that
are unsuitable for surgical resection or local ablative therapy. In
order to accurately determine its efficacy and impact on overall
survival compared with other local modalities, well-designed
prospective investigations of SBRT are needed. In addition,
further trials are also necessary to assess the efficacy of
combinations of SBRT and other novel targeted agents for the
treatment of patients with recurrent HCC.
