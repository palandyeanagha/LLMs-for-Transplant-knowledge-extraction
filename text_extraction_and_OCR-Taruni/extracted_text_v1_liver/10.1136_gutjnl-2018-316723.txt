Abstract
The microbiome has received increasing attention over 
the last 15 years. Although gut microbes have been 
explored for several decades, investigations of the role 
of microorganisms that reside in the human gut has 
attracted much attention beyond classical infectious 
diseases. For example, numerous studies have reported 
changes in the gut microbiota during not only obesity, 
diabetes, and liver diseases but also cancer and even 
neurodegenerative diseases. The human gut microbiota 
is viewed as a potential source of novel therapeutics. 
Between 2013 and 2017, the number of publications 
focusing on the gut microbiota was, remarkably, 12 
900, which represents four-fifths of the total number 
of publications over the last 40 years that investigated 
this topic. This review discusses recent evidence of the 
impact of the gut microbiota on metabolic disorders 
and focus on selected key mechanisms. This review 
also aims to provide a critical analysis of the current 
knowledge in this field, identify putative key issues or 
problems and discuss misinterpretations. The abundance 
of metagenomic data generated on comparing diseased 
and healthy subjects can lead to the erroneous claim 
that a bacterium is causally linked with the protection 
or the onset of a disease. In fact, environmental factors 
such as dietary habits, drug treatments, intestinal motility 
and stool frequency and consistency are all factors that 
influence the composition of the microbiota and should 
be considered. The cases of the bacteria Prevotella copri
and Akkermansia muciniphila will be discussed as key 
examples.
Introduction
Microbes that reside in the human gut are key 
contributors to host metabolism and are considered 
potential sources of novel therapeutics. Although 
this sentence may be seen as obvious in 2018, the 
universality of this concept is less evident. Undeniably, it is due to the advent of genetic tools and 
the metagenomic revolution of the last 15 years 
that we are now able to characterise the composition and function of microbiomes (box 1) from 
different parts of the body and link them to potential diseases, risks or even to the clear onset of 
clinical symptoms. In recent decades, microbes 
have mostly been used to develop disease-specific 
diagnostics. Currently, the mechanisms of interactions or of defense against potential pathogens 
are often described at the molecular level. Moreover, the current understanding is that some gut 
bacteria may also achieve this goal by communicating with human cells and mostly by promoting 
immune interactions.1 2 A large number of recent 
papers and reviews have covered different aspects 
of the microbiome and its potential role in human 
health, including the early life3–5 but also specific 
diseases, such as cardiometabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, neuropsychiatric diseases 
and cancer.6–12
In the present perspective review, recent evidence 
showing the impact of specific bacteria and the 
involvement of the innate immune system will be 
discussed. However, most importantly, we debate 
one part of the current knowledge in this field and 
ask the following question: how should we interpret 
the numerous hopes, promises and threats?
Before discussing specific examples, we recommend that you scrutinise the next paragraph, which 
introduces us to the infinite minuscule world that 
may have great impact on human health (figure 1).
The gut microbiota is now considered an 
important partner of human cells, interacting with 
virtually all human cells. In 2017, approximately 
4000 papers focusing on the gut microbiota were 
published , and between the years 2013 and 2017, 
more than 12900 publications were devoted to 
the study of the gut microbiota. This remarkable 
number represents more than 80% of the overall 
publications of the last 40 years (since 1977) on 
this topic. Therefore, this simple finding highlights 
the fact that this field of research is not only blossoming but also strongly suggests the necessity for 
advancement.
Although not discussed in detail on this perspective review, we should briefly mention that in addition to bacteria, other key microorganisms, such 
as archeae, viruses, phages, yeast and fungi, are 
present in the gut. These microorganisms, which 
likely control the activity of the host and, most 
importantly, of the gut microbes, have been investigated in detail and may be as important as bacteria. 
Therefore, the archaea, the virome, the phageome 
and the mycobiome offer an additional dimension 
to the investigation of host–microorganism interactions. As an example, the phages do not only 
exceed the number of bacteria (eg, 10-fold more 
phages than bacteria) but they are also new actors 
playing roles in these complex interactions.13–17 As 
a simple example, it has been more than a 100 years 
since Félix d’Herelle formally identified phages15
(figure 1). However, reproducible protocols to 
analyse the faecal phageomes using metagenomics 
analysis have only recently emerged.18 Therefore, 
this implies that this area of research requires more 
time before major fundamental breakthroughs can 
be translated to general applications for the public. 
Nevertheless, today, due to the different kind of 
media (ie, mode of communication), medical information can be rapidly disseminated to the public. 
Hence, one of the major caveats remains the lack 
of perspective not only from society but also from 
some scientists and healthcare professionals, who

may misinterpret data or are expecting a direct translation of 
such complex research from the bench to the clinic. Therefore, 
experts in this field must provide access to such knowledge with 
caution and without delusion.
Microbes interact with host cells: immunity links microbes to 
metabolism
Different systems recognise and monitor the presence of microorganisms in the body. For example, in the gastrointestinal tract 
(GI), epithelial cells play a major role as guardians that translate key information to the immune cells located in the lamina 
propria. In fact, the recognition and the monitoring of microbes 
is mainly performed by the innate immune system with pattern 
recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) 
and NOD-like receptors (NLR).19 The TLRs are transmembrane 
receptors expressed on cell surfaces (ie, TLR-2, 4, 5) or in endolysosomal compartments (ie, TLR-3, 7, 8, 9 or 13), whereas 
NOD receptors are cytosolic proteins. Together, these receptors recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 
from microorganisms (eg, lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, 
lipoteichoic acid, flagellin and muramyldipeptide) or danger-associated molecular patterns from damaged tissues.19 Thus, the 
GI tract not only contains a vast majority of the microbes that 
reside in the human body but also harbours probably the larger 
pool of the immune cells that are present in the body.20 Notably, 
the immune system also has a predominant effect on the composition of the microbiota.21 Therefore, GI cells are continually 
exposed to a vast number of microbial antigens and metabolites. 
In spite of this close proximity, we live with microorganisms in 
perfect symbiosis (figure 2).
In addition to the classical immune considerations, the interactions between gut microbes and the immune system have led 
to the discovery of previously unknown functions; for example, 
it was discovered that specific microbial components strongly

contribute not only to the regulation of energy metabolism but 
also to glucose and lipid homeostasis.22–24 In 2007, we first 
identified that constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such 
as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), were the key factors triggering 
the onset of low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance via 
mechanisms of interaction between gut microbes and the innate 
immune system (ie, TLR-4, CD14).22 Indeed, genetic models of 
both diet-induced obesity and diabetes were characterised by 
an increased level of circulating LPS, a condition called metabolic endotoxaemia,22 which was later confirmed in humans 
(figure 2)
25–34. Since the initial identification of LPS as a major 
actor involved in the onset of metabolic alterations associated 
with overweight and obesity (eg, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidaemia, hepatic steatosis), other PAMPs such as 
peptidoglycans or flagellin have been shown to play a causal role 
on the regulation of similar metabolic pathways.35–37
In addition to the specific changes in the composition of 
the gut microbiota, it is now accepted that several key factors 
contribute to the translocation of bacterial compounds from 
the intestinal lumen to the body. As previously indicated, gut 
microbes are constantly interacting with intestinal epithelial 
cells; however, in normal conditions, the gut barrier function 
is highly efficient due to complex multifaceted mechanisms 
(ie, tight-junction proteins, thickness and composition of the 
mucus layer, presence of antimicrobial factors, intraepithelial 
lymphocytes and other adaptive immune cells and production 
of immunoglobulin A (IgA)) (figure 2) (reviewed in König et al
and Wells et al38 39).
Figure 2 Major mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between microbes and host: impact of metabolism. The balance between healthy and 
pathological situations (eg, metabolic disorders) is crucial. This is under the tight influence of several factors including the genes, food and drugs. 
This left part of the figure shows that in healthy situation, the composition of the gut microbiome is associated with a higher mucus layer thickness, 
the production of antimicrobial signals and different short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate and propionate. Both butyrate and propionate bind 
to G protein coupled receptors (GPR)-43 and GPR-41 expressed on the enteroendocrine L-cells thereby stimulating the secretion of gut peptides 
such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). This effect contributes to reduce food intake and to improve glucose metabolism. 
Propionate can also bind to GPR-43 expressed on lymphocytes in order to maintain appropriate immune defence. Butyrate activates peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) leading to beta-oxidation and oxygen consumption, a phenomenon contributing to maintain anaerobic 
condition in the gut lumen. As depicted on the right part of the figure, during metabolic disorders, changes in the gut microbiome are linked with a 
lower mucus thickness, decreased antimicrobial defense and butyrate and propionate production. As a consequence, L-cells secrete less gut peptides. 
The lack of PPAR-γ activation lead to higher oxygen available for the microbiota at the proximity of the mucosa and increases the proliferation of 
Enterobacteriaceae. The decrease in propionate also contribute to the lower abundance of specific T cells (mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) 
and Treg) in the lamina propria of the gut. Altogether, such changes in the microbial environment and metabolites induce a leakage of pathogen 
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that are increased in the blood, and trigger low-grade inflammation.

Recent advances in basic science
It is also well known that a loss of immune tolerance is associated with bowel inflammation. Interestingly, recent data have 
also shown the accumulation of T cells in the intestines of obese 
subjects consuming high-fat diets, an observation that correlates 
with morbidity.40 Conversely, the circulation of other immune 
cells, such as mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) (ie, 
innate-like T cells), which exhibit elevated Th1 and Th17 cytokine production is strongly decreased in patients with obesity 
and type 2 diabetes41 (figure 2).
In conclusion, the gut barrier is controlled by fine-tuned 
communications occurring between gut microbes and the host 
immune system. Additionally, the complexity of those interactions raise the question about the level of our current understanding and eventually contribute to explain why it is relatively 
difficult to develop specific therapeutic targets.
Microbial activity, metabolites and metabolism
In addition to receptors recognising specific constituents of the 
cell membranes of microbes and directly related to the innate 
immune system, there is evidence that many different microbial 
metabolites also influence host metabolism mostly by binding 
to specific host membranes or nuclear receptors (for review see 
Husted et al, Pallister et al, Brown and Hazen, Rastelli et al, O’ 
Mahony et al, Kasselman et al42–47). Among the numerous 
metabolites produced by the microbiota, we can mention 
important metabolites such as folate, indoles, secondary bile 
acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), but also neurotransmitters (eg, serotonin, gamma amino butyric acid), and eventually short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The latter example is likely 
the most studied. Indeed, the most investigated are probably the 
SCFAs (ie, butyrate, propionate and acetate). It has been shown 
that SCFAs are recognised by G-protein-coupled receptors such 
as GPR-41 and GPR-43.48 The stimulation of these receptors 
triggers the secretion of intestinal peptides involved in glucose 
metabolism or food intake, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 
or peptide YY (PYY)49 50 (figure 2). Therefore, by stimulating 
enteroendocrine cells to produce key hormones, microbes act 
from a distance on different organs.51–53 Notably, propionate 
also regulates immune cells to produce antimicrobial factors 
and, therefore, may act as an immune regulator,54 including a 
reduction of cancer cell proliferation.55 56 This latter example 
also highlights the fact that a distinct microbial metabolite may 
play different roles, ranging from the regulation of glucose levels 
to immunomodulatory effects, in host metabolism.
Along these lines, in reality, the role and mechanisms of action 
of some SCFAs might also be very different from what has previously been thought. For example, butyrate has been considered 
for decades to be an essential energy source, allowing colonic 
cells to proliferate and contributing to the maintenance of 
healthy gut barrier function. However, in a recent study, Byndloss et al discovered that butyrate may also strongly influence 
the microbial environment and ecology by communicating with 
host cells. It has been shown that butyrate instructs colonic 
cells to ‘breathe’ oxygen by activating β-oxidation in order to 
protect the host against the expansion of potentially pathogenic 
bacteria to the intestinal lumen (figure 2).57 58 Specifically, the 
authors used recent information suggesting that the extremely 
low quantity of oxygen present in the luminal content of the 
gut (ie, the anaerobic state) is a condition that is required to 
prevent the expansion of putative facultative anaerobic pathogens such as Salmonella or Escherichia.
59 Thus, the authors 
demonstrated that the consumption of oxygen by the host cell 
to β-oxidise butyrate in the mitochondria contributes to limiting 
the diffusion of oxygen from the colonic cells into the luminal 
compartment, eventually leading to the maintenance of anaerobic conditions57 58 (figure 2).
What matters: quality, quantity or activity of microbes?
Over the last decade, pioneering papers have shown that some 
metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with shifts in the microbiota at the phylum level (ie, 
in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio).60 Since this discovery, 
not all papers have been able to replicate this finding, which 
gives rise to the following question: should we focus only on 
the general composition at the phylum level or should we go 
deeper (ie, the genus and species levels)? However, in addition 
to these considerations, there is another important question: is 
it more relevant to explore the metabolic capacity of the intestinal microbiota and, eventually, to the metabolites produced 
(eg, butyrate, bile acids, TMAO) than it is to study the microbial 
composition alone?42 51 61 62 Indeed, as briefly described in the 
previous chapter of this perspective, there are numerous metabolites produced by the gut microbiome that can influence our 
metabolism.
At this stage of our knowledge, there are no clear answers to 
these questions. Along these lines, in addition to these discoveries and observations, a recent, very elegant study demonstrated 
that it is the absolute quantity of microbes and not the proportions of microbes that really matters.63 This study strongly argues 
that most previous studies, which have primarily been based on 
the investigation of the relative proportions of microbes, have 
probably not been able to capture the essence of the problem. 
For example, the authors observed differences of up to 1 log 
between the microbial loads of healthy individuals. As another 
striking example, in this paper, the authors highlighted the fact 
that the abundance of Bacteroides is associated with Crohn’s 
disease only when using the classical relative abundance-based 
profiling, whereas by using quantitative microbiome profiling, 
it was the abundance of the genus Prevotella that was found to 
be decreased in patients with Crohn’s disease.63 Moreover, this 
observation underlines the real risk and the limitations of using 
relative abundance-based analysis because this type of analysis 
can lead to erroneous interpretations (figure 2).
Similarly, the necessity for analysing not only the presence of 
certain gut microorganisms but also the activity of these organisms has already been discussed by authors.64 65 More recently, 
Schirmer et al profiled the gut microbiomes of more than a 
hundred individuals, including patients with Crohn’s disease, 
ulcerative colitis and non-IBD control patients and analysed 
both the metagenomes and the metatranscriptomes of these 
individuals.64 They discovered that most of the bacteria were 
well correlated when analysing DNA and RNA abundances; 
however, strikingly, some organisms that were abundant in terms 
of metagenomic data were, as stated by the researchers, ‘inactive 
or dormant’ in the gut with little or no expression. Conversely, 
some disease-specific bacterial characteristics were only detectable when analysed at the transcriptional level. Therefore, such 
findings highlight the fact that the transcription of specific gut 
microbial pathways may vary over time, leading to potential 
phenotypic changes that may be complementary to changes associated with classical metagenomic abundance (figure 2).
Having said that, the specific examples highlighted above and 
relating the quantity of bacteria and the activity of the bacteria 
(including the metabolome) strongly demonstrate the importance of multiomics approaches and how various genomic and 
metabolomics approaches complement each other to further

dissect the interactions between microbes, host and the overall 
metabolism.66
Several interesting studies have also proposed that the microbiome should be seen as an integral part of precision medicine 
approach (for review see Suez and Elinav and Kashyap et al67 68) 
because it contributes to interindividual variability in all aspects 
of diseases situation but is also a modifiable factor leading to 
the development of future therapeutics. For example, Zeevi 
et al elegantly illustrate this concept by showing that the gut 
microbiome can be used to predict personalised blood glucose 
responses to specific diets, which differ between individuals.69
However, this has required the use of machine-learning algorithm 
that integrates many parameters, such as in this case the weeklong glucose levels, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical 
activity and gut microbiota from more than 800 individuals and 
more than 45 000 meals. Interestingly, the algorithm was then 
tested in an independent cohort of 100 individuals.69 Although 
found as highly promising and clearly showing the application 
by some researchers, others have requested to tone down the 
potentiality of a broad applicability with conclusions such as the 
fact that predictive algorithms are black boxes with complex 
statistical associations without the real mechanisms explaining 
the presence of such associations.70 Or others mentioned that 
the results does not provide enough evidence that the model is 
finally superior to the current methods of detecting high glucose 
levels and even did not demonstrated that personalised nutrition 
advice are superior to standard advices in view of managing high 
glucose levels in postprandial situations.
Actually, there is not yet a full consensus reached on what is 
the best option and how to proceed to design future personalised 
medicine, but the field is relatively young and warrants further 
work.
Nevertheless, obtaining a more comprehensive analysis of 
the situation by screening not only the composition but also 
the metabolites (eg, metabolome) in prospective conditions (as 
opposed to the current conditions that have the caveat of only 
studying single time points) will likely be useful. Notably, one 
may also argue that most studies have examined faecal material (which is easily accessible), whereas the mucosal microbiota 
is still under investigated (figure 2). This without saying that 
such ambitious studies will require standardised protocols for 
sampling, storage and analysis. In addition, as it has been done 
for many years in the area of nutrition and drug treatments, 
we should probably develop large-scale longitudinal studies. 
Indeed, these kind of future studies should be designed to allow 
a follow-up of several years in a very broad cohort of subjects 
(ie, apparently healthy as well as diseases subjects) during which 
samples (eg, blood, urine, faecal) as well as many as possible 
information should be carefully followed on top of the classical 
dietary habits and drug use.
Altogether, the different points discussed above strongly 
support the need for functional studies but it also highlight the 
current difficulties to obtain a clear consensus on the best way 
to proceed. Hence, to obtain a complete overview of the role 
of the microbiome on health, we will still need to combine 
compositional analysis of microbiomes and showing changes 
correlating to environmental changes (ie, diets, drugs) or 
biological states (ie, interindividual physiological variations, 
diseases). This will then require follow-up studies to validate 
the causality. This is the purpose of the next chapter of this 
perspective review.
Hopes, promises and threats: the indispensable need for 
proofs of concept
This last part of the review is dedicated to a discussion of critical issues and the necessity to develop well-defined experiments 
before claiming that some microbes are or not beneficial or 
even deleterious. As stated above, when a correlation is found 
between a given microbe and a disease or healthy situation, it is 
challenging to show the exact implication of the candidate on 
the onset of the disease or conversely its beneficial impact.
In other words, as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, 
the literature often discuss the role of specific candidates 
(ie, bacteria) as potential beneficial or deleterious candidate 
following correlative works. However, sometimes we probably 
rapidly (too rapidly) infer positive or negative effects without 
properly investigating these effects.
Therefore, we, as researchers usually start from correlation 
and seldom provide proof of concept by using isolated bacteria 
or identified metabolites. This is not because we do not want 
to investigate properly the roles of ‘new’ microbes or metabolites; but because it might be difficult to culture some bacteria. 
Indeed, moving from the signature identified at the 16S level to 
the proper isolation of the candidate bacteria and to investigations in complex models (even in vitro) usually requires much 
time and effort. Although recent advances in culturomics have 
been made,71 72 the isolation and the identification of anaerobic 
bacteria remain time consuming and fastidious.72 73 Moreover, 
when a putative candidate has been isolated and cultured, it is 
still necessary to culture it in quantities that are compatible with 
chronic in vivo testing.
On top of that, at the level of our knowledge, it is still very 
difficult to fully decipher the role of any microorganism in a 
complex community such as the gut microbiota. This last point 
is illustrated by two specific examples: the cases of two bacteria 
that is Prevotella copri and Akkermansia muciniphila.
The case of P. copri
The role of P. copri has been recently investigated in two independent elegant studies. Although, both seminal papers reached 
their respective conclusion from data obtained from human 
observational studies and subsequently confirmed in mouse 
intervention studies, they represent a clear example on how 
misleading a simple association study can be and how potential factors may influence discrepant and even contrasting results 
from functional proof-of-concept studies.
In the first one, P. copri was found to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by a mechanism associated with 
the production of succinate on the fermentation of dietary 
fibres.74 More precisely, De Vadder et al have discovered that 
a diet rich in fermentable dietary fibres was associated with a 
higher production of succinate.74 They found that the abundance of succinate was higher in the caecal content but not in 
the portal vein of the mice treated with dietary fibres. Therefore, they hypothesised that succinate was used as a substrate 
by the intestinal cells. Accordingly, succinate is a substrate 
for the intestinal gluconeogenesis, a process well described 
to improve glucose homeostasis.75 More importantly, they 
demonstrate that succinate feeding improves glucose tolerance 
and insulin sensitivity. Similarly, the colonisation of mice with 
P. copri replicates this beneficial phenotype in high-fat/high-sucrose fed mice.74 Finally, by using a mouse model with an intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of the rate-limiting enzyme 
involved in the gluconeogenesis (ie, glucose-6-phosphatase), 
they demonstrated that succinate produced by P. copri is an

essential mechanism involved in the improvement of glucose 
and insulin sensitivity.74
In the second study, Pedersen et al discovered that the metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is characterised by the 
presence of high levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) 
which correlates with a microbiome enriched in the biosynthetic 
pathways of such BCAAs.76 Among the bacteria linked with this 
observation, both P. copri and Bacteroides vulgatus were identified. To experimentally address the relation between P. copri
and an altered glucose metabolism, they gavage high-fat fed mice 
with P. copri or a vehicle. The authors discovered that P. copri
administration aggravates glucose intolerance, reduces insulin 
sensitivity and increases serum total BCAAs level.76
In conclusion, although both studies are designed and 
performed as proof-of-concept studies, whether P. copri should 
be considered as a beneficial or deleterious bacterium likely 
depend on the dietary environments and probably requires 
further investigations.74 76
Another key recent example is the large amount of interest 
generated by the bacterium A. muciniphila. This bacterium is 
one of the most abundant single species in the human intestinal 
microbiota (up to 5% of the total bacteria in basal conditions) 
and was isolated and characterised as a mucin-utilising specialist 
by Professor Willem de Vos in 2004.77 Today, A. muciniphila
is viewed by several scientists as a next-generation beneficial 
microbe.78–81
The case of Akkermansia in cardiometabolic disorders
It was described that A. muciniphila was less abundant in the 
intestinal microbiota of genetically obese and diabetic mice as 
well as of mice in which these conditions were dietarily induced. 
Interestingly, in these mice, the abundance of A. muciniphila was 
systematically found to be inversely correlated with body weight, 
fat mass, inflammation, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (figure 3).82–89 This observation therefore suggested that 
this bacterium might be of interest. However, few other studies 
in mice have reported an increased abundance of A. muciniphila
on the ingestion of a high-fat high-sucrose diet.90 91 Conversely, 
it has also been widely demonstrated that prebiotic feeding 
(eg, with inulin-type fructans and some polyphenols) strongly 
increases the presence of A. muciniphila and improves metabolic 
disorders associated with obesity, including decreased fat mass, 
insulin resistance, lower liver steatosis and reinforcement of the 
gut barrier.82 85 91–93 Importantly, in humans, the abundance of 
A. muciniphila was seen to be decreased in several pathological 
conditions, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and liver disease94–100 (figure 3). Metformin, 
which is the most extensively used antidiabetic treatment, 
and bariatric surgery dramatically increased the abundance of 
A. muciniphila (up to 20% of the total microbiota).101–104
In addition to these data, which are abundant but correlative, 
over the last 2years, several papers have adopted a proof-of-concept strategy by investigating the impact of the A. muciniphila
administration in vivo and in different models. It is now accepted 
that supplementation with A. muciniphila protects against several 
cardiometabolic features. All the studies in which animals were 
treated with A. muciniphila showed that the bacteria lowers 
body weight and fat-mass gain, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, 
cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis; improves insulin sensitivity 
and restores gut barrier function by influencing different factors 
Figure 3 Association between Akkermansia muciniphila and several diseases: what is known? What are the major confounding factors. The picture 
illustrated different pathological situations where the abundance of the bacteria A. muciniphila has been found to be increased or decreased. It also 
highlight several confounding factors associated with the modulation of the gut microbiota and eventually the abundance of A. muciniphila according 
to the health situation and shows the current data for which a proof-of-concept of the link between the disease and the presence of the bacteria has 
been made.

Recent advances in basic science
(ie, mucus-layer thickness, tight-junction proteins, antimicrobial peptides and immunity)83 96 105–108 (figure 3). Notably, one 
of the potential key mechanisms by which A. muciniphila acts 
is via specific compounds such as the protein ‘Amuc_1100’.105
Recently identified on the outer membrane of this bacteria, this 
protein has been shown to play immunomodulatory roles both 
in vivo and in vitro,105 109 and this effect of A. muciniphila on 
the immune system is important because A. muciniphila has 
recently been shown to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes in 
diabetes-prone animals.107
Akkermansia and immune-based cancer therapy: proof of concept
With regard to immunity, the impact of A. muciniphila seems 
to be of great importance not only in the context of metabolic 
syndromes or for reducing autoimmune type 1 diabetes as 
described above105 107 but also in the context of cancer therapy. It 
has been previously shown that anticancer therapies may rely on 
the composition of the gut microbiota.110 However, in a series 
of recent studies,111–113 a role for A. muciniphila in this context 
has been discovered. Specifically, the authors have shown that 
the gut microbiota and even specific key bacterial species may 
influence the outcomes of anticancer immunotherapy, such as 
anti-PD-1 treatment.111–113 First, the authors simply observed 
that the patients responding to anti-PD-1 treatment were 
those exhibiting increased abundance of gut A. muciniphila
compared with non-responders. This observation suggested that 
a favourable drug response might be observed in the presence of 
A. muciniphila. While this finding was a simple correlation, the 
authors clearly moved to a proof-of-concept strategy when they 
decided to transfer into mice the microbiota from responders 
and non-responders. In this experiment, the authors observed a 
similar response, that is, an altered drug response in the absence 
of A. muciniphila. Although they used particular models, that is 
germ free or antibiotic-treated mice colonised with the microbiota from responder or non-responder donors, the treatment 
with the bacterium A. muciniphila reversed the compromised 
efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade in mice receiving the microbiota from non-responders. Therefore, poorly responding mice 
(ie, colonised with non-responders faecal material) turned into 
responders on treatment with A. muciniphila, clearly showing 
that the presence of this bacteria plays an important role. More 
importantly, the authors found that this result was the consequence of an immunomodulatory effect of A. muciniphila.
111
Despite this very important finding, we may not rule out that the 
effects are not directly mediated by this bacterium but requires 
the activity (or cross-talk) with one or several other key species 
which drive the beneficial effects. Moreover, further human 
studies are needed in order to consider the bacteria as therapeutic adjuvants in this context.
The case of Akkermansia in neurodegenerative disorders
While different proof-of-concept studies have been described 
above, there are other situations where the over-representation 
of A. muciniphila in the faeces are not associated with a beneficial 
effect. In fact, a series of papers investigating Parkinson’s disease 
and multiple sclerosis (MS) have been recently published.114–116
More specifically, recent papers have characterised the gut 
microbiome of patients with MS and have identified variations in 
specific microbes. Indeed, the levels of 25 different bacteria were 
significantly different between diseased patients and controls, 
and one of these bacteria was A. muciniphila.
114 115 Strikingly, 
the studies by Berer et al and Cekanaviciute et al focused their 
attention on the increased abundance of A. muciniphila in the 
faecal material of patients with MS. However, although both 
studies elegantly demonstrated that the faecal microbiota of 
MS-affected individuals worsened disease progression compared 
with control individuals when transplanted into a mouse model 
of MS, none of these studies was able to detect the presence or 
any change in the abundance of A. muciniphila after the transplantation of the microbiota from the human donor into the 
recipient mice. Consequently, this observation exclude at this 
stage of the study the role of A. muciniphila in the onset of the 
disease.
This finding also suggests that the presence of A. muciniphila
in the human stool samples but not in the rodents that developed the disease by being colonised with the same human 
faecal material may be due to other bacterial candidate. Along 
this line, few of these papers dissected the potential effects of 
classical drug treatments of patients with neurodegenerative 
diseases as an important confounding factor that can induce 
a distinct signature, as previously shown in such diseases 
(figure 3).117
Indeed, a similar comparison can be made with some seminal 
studies published a couple of years ago, which showed differences in the compositions of the gut microbiota of type 2 
diabetic and non-diabetic patients including an increase in A. 
muciniphila.
118 After a couple of years, it was finally discovered 
that the previous data (at least on this bacterium) were in fact 
flawed because of the drug treatments (ie, metformin, liraglutide) (figure 3).102 103 118 119 A similar observation is done for 
the use of proton pump inhibitor that strongly affect the gut 
microbiota.120–122
Thus, one may argue that we should take into account of such 
confounding factor for all the future studies, including neurodegenerative disorders.
Box 1 Key definitions
Microbiota: This term refers to a collection of all taxa 
constituting microbial communities, such as bacteria, archeae, 
fungi and protists. When it refers to a specific environment, 
the term is preceded by the said location, for example, ‘the gut 
microbiota’ refers to the intestinal tract and the ‘oral microbiota’ 
is used when speaking about all the microbes from the oral 
cavity.128
Microbiome: This term was initially used to refer to the 
genes harboured by microbes; however, currently, the 
term ‘microbiome’ is also commonly used to refer to the 
microorganisms themselves (ie, the microbiota).128
Probiotics: These are live microorganisms that, when 
administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to 
the host.129
Prebiotics: These are substrates that are selectively utilised by 
host microorganisms conferring health benefits.130
Metagenome: This term refers to the entire genetic material 
present in a sample. The metagenome is composed of the 
genomes of several individual organisms, for instance, the 
genomes of human cells and of the gut microorganisms that are 
present in faecal material.
Metabolome: This term refers to the quantitative complement 
of all the low molecular-weight molecules present in a biological 
sample.131
Virome: This term refers to the entire viral genetic material 
present in a sample. The virome consists of the genomes of 
viruses.

Recent advances in basic science
Indeed, in such diseases, the vast majority of patients experience changes in dietary habits, chronic constipation and other GI 
comorbidities; therefore, these pathologies are classically associated with a change in gut motility and other premotor symptoms. 
Interestingly, it has been well described that stool frequency and 
consistency (figure 3)
123 are predominant factors for intestinal 
A. muciniphila abundance. In fact, a recent paper highlights the 
crucial importance of assessing stool frequency and consistency 
in microbiome studies.123 In addition, caloric restriction and 
fasting periods are key characteristics of the feeding behaviour of 
patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and these factors have 
clearly been shown to increase the abundance of A. muciniphila
in the human gut.124
Therefore, these different examples strongly show us that we 
need a careful analysis and demonstration of causality before 
making claims about the risks or beneficial effects of some 
microbes. As stated above, the last decade has been characterised 
by an abundance of papers assessing the difference between the 
microbiomes of healthy or diseased cohorts. Hence, the misinterpretation of data and claims that a bacterium is involved in a 
phenotype based on changes in the abundance of the bacterium 
is still seen almost daily in the literature (figure 3).
Finally, in addition to the case of P. copri and A. muciniphila,
recent data combining both observational and proof-of-concept 
studies have also suggested that specific species might be directly 
involved in the protection against metabolic disorders associated with obesity (eg, Christensenella minuta)
125 or, conversely, 
might contribute to the onset of such metabolic disorders (eg, 
Ralstonia pickettii, Enterobacter cloacae).126 127 Thus, these 
kinds of findings are interesting but cannot be generalised and 
warrant further confirmation using extensive studies, as detailed 
previously.
Conclusion and perspectives
We are living with a tremendous amount of microorganisms 
in our guts, ranging from bacteria, archaea to virus and fungi. 
There is no doubt about the fact that we have progressed in the 
analysis of the composition of the microbiota and of the key 
metabolites produced and even in the discovery and isolation 
of novel bacteria. However, we must acknowledge that a large 
number of the studies published the last couple of years have 
reported differences in the microbiome under different conditions. Although most of them are very well performed, we still 
need more work to go beyond the simple associations and we 
need to provide as much as possible more complex analysis 
(eg, multiomics and time series measurements) if we want to 
finally approach the final causality. Indeed, simple associations 
may lead to misinterpretation or overselling of expected results 
when translated into the human context. Thus, both types of 
approaches are important, that is, comparing diseased and 
healthy conditions and then showing the causality as a proof 
of concept. However, the general population as well as health 
practitioners should be rigorous when drawing conclusions 
from papers that assume that the discovery of differences in gut 
microbiota composition is potentially strongly associated with a 
specific disease or its overall evolution (box 1).
