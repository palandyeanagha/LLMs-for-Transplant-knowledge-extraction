Hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains from rabbits indicate 
that these mammals may be a reservoir for HEVs that 
cause infection in humans. To determine HEV prevalence 
in rabbits and the strains’ genetic characteristics, we 
tested bile, liver, and additional samples from farmed 
and wild rabbits in France. We detected HEV RNA in 7% 
(14/200) of bile samples from farmed rabbits (in 2009) 
and in 23% (47/205) of liver samples from wild rabbits (in 
2007–2010). Full-length genomic sequences indicated that 
all rabbit strains belonged to the same clade (nucleotide 
sequences 72.2%–78.2% identical to HEV genotypes 
1–4). Comparison with HEV sequences of human strains 
and reference sequences identifi ed a human strain closely 
related to rabbit strain HEV. We found a 93-nt insertion in 
the X domain of open reading frame 1 of the human strain 
and all rabbit HEV strains. These fi ndings indicate that the 
host range of HEV in Europe is expanding and that zoonotic 
transmission of HEV from rabbits is possible.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute 
hepatitis in many developing countries in Asia and 
Africa, where it is transmitted by the fecal–oral route 
because of poor sanitation practices (1). Acute hepatitis 
E is also increasingly reported in industrialized countries, 
where the transmission is mainly zoonotic (2). The initial 
discovery of HEV transmission from domestic pigs (3) has 
been followed by evidence that other mammals, such as 
wild boars and deer, are also potential reservoirs of HEV 
(4). Although the course of HEV infection is generally 
self-limiting and asymptomatic (or symptomatic with acute 
hepatitis), fulminant hepatitis can occur in pregnant women 
and in persons with underlying liver disease (5–7). HEV 
infections can also become chronic in immunocompromised 
patients, such as recipients of solid-organ transplants (8–
10), those with hematologic diseases (11,12), and patients 
infected with HIV (13–15).
HEV, genus Hepevirus, family Hepeviridae, is a 
positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped RNA virus 
(16). The HEV genome is ≈7.2 kb long and contains 3 open 
reading frames (ORFs) as well as 5′ and 3′ untranslated 
regions: ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, ORF2 
encodes the capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a small 
phosphoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV sequences 
has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes that infect 
mammals from a variety of species. HEV1 and HEV2 are 
restricted to humans and transmitted through contaminated 
water in developing countries. HEV3 and HEV4 infect 
humans, pigs, and other mammals and are responsible 
for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in developing and 
industrialized countries (2). HEV3 is distributed worldwide, 
whereas HEV4 largely is found in Asia. Although HEV3 
and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption 
of raw or undercooked meats, such as pig liver sausages or 
game meats (17,18), the full spectrum of animals that are 
reservoirs of HEV is still unknown.
Recent studies have characterized new HEV genotypes 
in isolates from rats in Germany (19), wild boars in Japan 
(20), and farmed rabbits in the People’s Republic of China 
(21,22). Because the potential risk for zoonotic transmission

of HEV from rabbits in France is unknown, and cases of 
autochthonous hepatitis E are commonly reported in this 
country (23,24), we investigated the prevalence of HEV in 
farmed and wild rabbits. We also looked for a genetic link 
between HEV strains circulating in rabbits and HEV strains 
circulating in humans in France.
Materials and Methods
Specimens from Farmed Rabbits
Bile specimens (n = 200) were collected in September 
2009 from rabbits raised on 20 farms in western France, in 
the departments of Maine et Loire (n = 6), Vendée (n = 6), 
Deux-Sèvres (n = 4), Calvados (n = 2), and Loire Atlantique 
(n = 2), the main geographic areas of rabbit farming in 
France. We sampled 10 rabbits from each farm when 
they were slaughtered at 70–90 days of age (Table 1). All 
rabbits were healthy and intended for human consumption. 
All samples were immediately stored at −80°C.
Specimens from Wild Rabbits
Liver specimens (n = 205) were collected during 
September 2007–November 2010 from 18 populations of 
wild rabbits, established in warrens; each population was 
considered epidemiologically independent. The populations 
were located in several departments of mainland France: 
Dordogne (n = 7), Finistère (n = 3), Deux-Sèvres (n = 2), 
Loire-Atlantique (n = 2), Haute-Garonne (n = 1), Charentes 
(n = 1), Morbihan (n = 1), and Pyrénées-Orientales (n = 
1) (Table 1). The number of rabbits sampled in a given 
warren ranged from 1 to 44. They were >6 months of age, 
apparently healthy, and intended for human consumption. 
Each rabbit was eviscerated within a few hours of its death, 
and a sample of its liver was taken and immediately frozen 
at −80°C. Necropsies were performed on a group of 12 
rabbits from the same warren in Haute-Garonne (W3), and 
samples of their intestine and cecum were taken, in addition 
to samples from the liver.
Specimens from Humans
Serum specimens were collected from immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients who had 
received a diagnosis of hepatitis E from the department 
of virology at Toulouse University Hospital. All samples 
were stored at −80°C (23,24).
RNA Extraction
Samples (140 μL of rabbit bile and 50 mg of liver, 
intestine, and cecum) were disrupted with TRIzol 
(Invitrogen, Saint Aubin, France). RNA was extracted with 
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, 
France). 
Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR
We used 1-step real-time reverse transcription PCR 
on the Light Cycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, 
Meylan, France) to amplify a 70-bp fragment. The primers 
and probes targeted the ORF3 region: forward primer 
HEVORF3-S: 5′-GGTGGTTTCTGGGGTGAC-3′, reverse 
primer HEVORF3-AS: 5′AGGGGTTGGTTGGATGAA
-3′, and probe 5′-Fam-TGATTCTCAGCCCTTCGCTamra-3′ (25). Each 50-μL reaction mix contained 1 μL 
of SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RTPCR System (Invitrogen), 15 μL of RNA, primers (200 
nmol/L) and probes (150 nmol/L), and 40 U of RNase 
Out (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out at 
50°C for 15 min, followed by denaturation at 95°C for 1 
min. DNA was amplifi ed with 50 PCR cycles at 95°C (20 
s) and 58°C (40 s). HEV RNA was quantifi ed by using a 
transcribed RNA standard constructed from a genotype 3f

HEV strain (GenBank accession no. EU495148). The limit 
of detection was 100 copies/mL.
DNA Sequencing
Two fragments, one within ORF2 (189 bp) and the 
other within ORF1, encompassing the hypervariable region 
and X domain (≈1,400 bp), were amplifi ed and sequenced 
in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method 
(PRISM Ready Reaction Ampli Taq Fs and Dye Deoxy 
primers; Applied Biosystems, Paris, France) on an ABI 
3130XL capillary DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA). The primers used for the ORF2 
fragment were the following: forward primer HEVORF2-S: 
5′-GACAGAATTRATTTCGTCGGCTGG-3′ and reverse 
primer HEVORF2-AS: 5′-TGYTGGTTRTCATAATCC
TG-3′. The primers used for the ORF1 fragment 
were the following: forward primer HEVORF1-S: 
5′-TGACGGCYACYGTKGARCTTG-3′ and reverse 
primer HEVORF1-AS: 5′-ACATCRACATCCCCCTGY
TGTATRGA-3′.
The whole genomes of 2 rabbit strains (W1–11 and 
W7–57) and 1 human strain (TLS-18516-human) were 
amplifi ed by overlapping RT-PCR. The primers are listed 
in Table 2.
Phylogenetic Analysis
The genotype was determined by using reference 
strains as previously described (26). Phylogenetic analyses 
were performed with genotype information on reference 
sequences based on the HEV classifi cation proposed by 
Lu et al. (27). Sequences were aligned by using ClustalW 
(MEGA5, www.megasoftware.net; BioEdit version 7.0, 
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit). Phylogenetic trees 
were created by the neighbor-joining (Kimura 2-parameter) 
method with a bootstrap of 1,000 replicates.
The 2 partial sequences of ORF1 and the 5 full-length 
sequences reported in this study have been deposited 
in GenBank. The accession numbers are JQ013789 
and JQ013790 for ORF1, and JQ013791 to JQ013795 
for the full-length sequences of W1–11, W7–57, TLS18516-human, TR19 (genotype 3c), and TR02 (genotype 
3e), respectively.
Results
HEV RNA 
All bile specimens from the 200 farmed rabbits and 
the liver specimens from the 205 wild rabbits were tested 
for HEV RNA (Table 1). Samples from 7 farms (35%) 
and 9 warrens (50%) tested positive for HEV RNA. HEV 
RNA was found in a 14 bile samples (7%) from farmed 
rabbits. The median HEV RNA concentration in the bile 
samples was 2.3 × 107 copies/mL (range 100 copies/mL–
109 copies/mL). A total of 47 liver samples (23%) from 
wild rabbits were positive for HEV RNA; median HEV 
RNA concentration was 1.9 × 106 copies/g (range 1,400 
copies/g–5.8 × 107 copies/g).
We tested the liver, intestine, and cecum samples from 
12 wild rabbits from the same warren (W3) in triplicate to 
obtain a clear picture of the tissue distribution of HEV in 
infected rabbits. HEV RNA was detected in all the tissues 
from 4 rabbits (nos. 4, 7, 9, 12), in the liver and intestine 
of 1 rabbit (no. 5), and in the liver only of 1 rabbit (no. 
6) (Table 3). The virus loads in the liver (mean 4.8 log 
copies/g), intestine (mean 4.0 log copies/g), and cecum 
(mean 3.6 log copies/g) were not signifi cantly different.
ORF2 Sequences
Phylogenetic analyses, conducted on the basis of a 
189-nt fragment within ORF2 of the 37 HEV strains from 
rabbits, HEV3 strains from humans circulating in France, 
and HEV reference sequences (HEV1, HEV2, HEV3, 
HEV4, rabbit HEV, rat HEV, wild-boar HEV) indicated 
that the 37 new ORF2 sequences from rabbit HEVs were 
clustered. One cluster contained 3 ORF2 sequences from 
previously characterized HEV from farmed rabbits from 
China, 2 ORF2 sequences from HEVs from farmed rabbits 
in France, and 13 ORF2 sequences from HEVs from wild 
rabbits in France (Figure 1). This cluster also contained 
an ORF2 sequence from a strain from a person in France 
(TLS-18516-human) (Figure 1). This strain was found in 
a serum sample from a 46-year-old man with an elevated 
alanine aminotransferase level (400 IU/L, reference <35 
IU/L).

ORF1 Sequences
Phylogenetic analysis based on a 1,400-nt fragment 
within ORF1, indicated that the ORF1 sequences from 
HEV strains from rabbits in France (n = 4) or China (n = 3) 
and the ORF1 sequence from the human strain TLS-18516-
human formed a distinct genetic group among sequences 
of HEV genotypes 1–4 (data not shown). The cluster of 
rabbit HEV sequences was also distinct from the HEV 
sequences from wild-boar and rat HEV genotypes that 
were characterized recently.
Comparison of the ORF1 sequences from rabbit 
HEV strains with reference ORF1 sequences from HEV 
genotypes 1–4 showed an insertion of 93 nt in the X 
domain of the ORF1 of all the rabbit HEV strains. This 
insertion was also found in the TLS-18516-human strain. 
The deduced amino acid sequences corresponding to 
this insertion, located between amino acids 938 and 939 
(Burmese strain, M73218), were not very similar, except 
for 2 conserved amino acids at the C-terminal end.

Genome Sequences
We obtained the full-length genomic sequences of 
HEV strains from 2 wild rabbits in France and the TLS18516-human strain. The phylogenetic tree, constructed by 
the neighbor-joining method using the full-length genomic 
sequences (including the sequences of genotypes 3f, 3e, 
and 3c, which were circulating in France), revealed that 
the HEV genomes from the rabbit strains and the TLS18516-human strain belonged to the same clade. This clade 
was clearly separated from genotypes 1–4, found in other 
mammals and from the new HEV genotypes found in wild 
boars and rats (Figure 2).
The length of the rabbit strain W1–11 genome, 
excluding the poly(A) tract at the 3′ terminus, was 7,262 
nt. The length of the rabbit strain W7–57 was 7,231 nt, 
and that of the TLS-18516-human strain was 7,259 nt. The 
nucleotide sequences of the rabbit strains and the TLS18516-human strain were 80.3%–85% identical (Table 4). 
The nucleotide sequences of the rabbit or TLS-18516-
human strains were 76.1% to 78.2% identical to those of 
genotype 3, 72.7% to 73.7% identical to those of genotype 
1, 72.2% to 73.5% identical to those of genotype 2, and 
72.9% to 74.9% identical to those of genotype 4. These 
comparisons therefore indicate that the sequences of the 
rabbit HEV strains and the TLS-18516-human strain are 
distinct from all known strains of HEV genotypes 1–4 and 
from the newly described HEV genotypes from wild boars 
and rats.
Discussion
We found that farmed and wild rabbits in France are 
naturally infected with HEV. We also characterized a 
human HEV strain that is closely related to rabbit HEV 
strains; this fi nding thus supports the potential of zoonotic 
transmission from rabbits to humans.
The HEVs found in farmed rabbits in several 
geographic areas of China have been identifi ed (21,22). 
HEV was also recently found in farmed rabbits in Virginia, 
USA (28). Our study results show that rabbits in Europe 
are infected with HEV and that some farmed rabbits and 
wild rabbits in France are infected. We found HEV RNA 
in 7% of the farmed rabbits and in 23% of the wild rabbits. 
However, the ages of the rabbits and the tissues tested 
(bile samples from farmed rabbits and liver samples from 
wild rabbits) may explain the observed difference in HEV 
prevalence. Nevertheless, previous studies have shown 
that the virus loads in liver and bile samples from swine 
infected with HEV are similar (29,30). Although the greater 
prevalence of HEV in wild rabbits could be linked to their 
older age, we could not test for a relationship between the 
prevalence of HEV and rabbit age because we did not know 
the rabbits’ precise ages.
Our analysis of the distribution of HEV in the tissues 
of infected wild rabbits showed HEV RNA not only in 
the liver, but also in the intestine and cecum; our analysis 
also showed that the virus loads from these organs were 
not signifi cantly different. This fi nding suggests that

extrahepatic sites of HEV replication exist in rabbits, as 
has been demonstrated for HEV3 in pigs (31). However, 
because the intestine and cecum samples may have been 
contaminated with blood, our results need to be confi rmed 
in future studies using methods that ensure that tissues 
other than the liver are not contaminated with blood.
To determine whether rabbits could be a reservoir for 
viruses that cause human infection, we analyzed partial and 
complete nucleotide sequences of the rabbit HEV strains 
and compared these sequences with those of human HEV 
strains circulating in France. Analysis of ORF2 showed that 
the sequences from rabbit HEV strains formed clusters, one 
of which included the sequences of HEV genotypes 2 and 4. 
The bootstrap values were very low because the fragments 
analyzed were small. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses 
based on ORF1 and the full-length genome indicated that 
all the rabbit strains from China and France belong to the 
same clade. One human strain, TLS-18516-human, clustered 
with the rabbit strains and appeared to be somewhat different 
from the 4 major HEV genotypes found in mammals and the 
newly described HEV genotypes from rats and wild boars. 
Although the full-length sequences of the genomes of the 
rabbit strains and the TLS-18516-human strain are more 
similar to that of HEV3 than to those of HEV1, HEV2, and 
HEV4, they do not seem to belong to the established HEV 
genotype 3 found in humans and swine, as recently suggested 
(20,32). Differences in the classifi cation of rabbit HEV could 
be because the full-length genomic sequences were used as 
the reference for phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 3 is highly 
diverse, with 10 identifi ed subtypes (27). We included in 
our analysis the full-length genomes of subtypes 3f, 3c, and 
3e, which account for ≈74%, 13%, and 5% of the human 
and swine HEV strains circulating in France (26,33). We 
also included the other full-length genomes representative 
of HEV3 subtypes, but subtypes 3d, 3h, and 3i are not yet 
available in GenBank. Our data indicate that the genomes 
of rabbit HEV strains or TLS-18516-human were <80% 
identical with HEV3, regardless of which method was used 
to align the sequences. This fi nding is compatible with the 
defi nition of a new genotype, as previously proposed (21,22).
We found a 93-nt insertion in the X domain of the 
ORF1 of the human strain TLS-18516-human and of all 
the rabbit HEV strains. This insertion, also found in the 
rabbit HEV strains from China (34), is not present in 
any known strain of HEV genotypes 1–4 or in the new 
HEV genotypes from rats and wild boars. The X domain 
corresponds to a macro domain found in the nonstructural 
polyproteins of several positive-stranded viruses such as 
togaviruses and coronaviruses (35–37). This domain can 
bind polyadenosine diphosphate–ribose regions and could 
play a role in the replication or transcription of virus 
RNA. Whether the insertion in the X domain infl uences 
the function of the HEV macro domain warrants further 
investigation. Several determinants, including this 
insertion, could be essential for specifying the host range, 
zoonotic transmission, and pathogenesis of rabbit HEV 
strains (34).
What rabbit HEV strains contribute to the 
epidemiology of hepatitis E in humans is not clear. HEV is 
endemic to southwestern France, and the annual incidence 
of locally acquired HEV infections has been estimated as 
3.2% (38,39). A case–control study found that the only 
factor independently associated with HEV infection was 
the consumption of game meat, mostly wild boar, deer, and 
wild rabbit (23). However, molecular data from various 
studies in France indicate that most HEV strains identifi ed 
belong to genotypes 3f, 3c, or 3e, which are prevalent in 
pigs and wild boars (23,26,40). A recent study showed the 
same proportions of genotypes 3f, 3c, and 3e in human and 
pig populations (33). Although this fi nding could indicate 
that rabbit HEV strains are less readily transmitted to 
humans than HEV genotype 3 strains, the primers used for 
PCR amplifi cation were not specifi cally designed for rabbit 
HEV strains. Therefore, the true prevalence of HEV RNA 
among rabbits and humans may have been underestimated. 
In addition, genotyping rabbit HEV may have been diffi cult 
because reference sequences have become available only 
recently.
The immunocompetent or immunocompromised status 
of the patient that became infected with a rabbit HEV strain, 
as well as the source of his contamination, is unknown 
because of the lack of medical follow-up. Molecular 
and epidemiologic studies are needed to determine the 
prevalence of rabbit HEV strains among immunocompetent 
and immunocompromised patients.
In conclusion, we have shown that in France, farmed 
and wild rabbits can be infected with HEV. Phylogenetic 
analysis, based on full-length genomes and a molecular 
signature in the X domain of ORF1, indicates that rabbit 
HEV strains could be a new genotype. Our identifi cation of

RESEARCH
a human HEV strain that is closely related to rabbit HEV 
strains reinforces the potential zoonotic risk for infection 
with this virus. Further studies are needed to demonstrate 
cross-species transmission directly and to evaluate the 
contribution of the rabbit reservoir to human HEV infection 
and disease.
