Abstract
Introduction Prostacyclin inhalation is increasingly used to treat
acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure,
although its pharmacodynamic properties remain controversial.
Prostacyclins not only affect vasomotor tone but may also have
cAMP-mediated positive inotropic effects and modulate
autonomic nervous system tone. We studied the role of these
different mechanisms in the overall haemodynamic effects
produced by iloprost inhalation in an experimental model of
acute pulmonary hypertension.
Methods In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled
animal study, twenty-six pigs (mean weight 35 ± 2 kg) were
instrumented with biventricular conductance catheters, a
pulmonary artery flow probe and a high-fidelity pulmonary artery
pressure catheter. The effects of inhaled iloprost (50 μg) were
studied in the following groups: animals with acute hypoxiainduced pulmonary hypertension, and healthy animals with and
without blockade of the autonomic nervous system.
Results During pulmonary hypertension, inhalation of iloprost
resulted in a 51% increase in cardiac output compared with
placebo (5.6 ± 0.7 versus 3.7 ± 0.8 l/minute; P = 0.0013), a
selective reduction in right ventricular afterload (effective
pulmonary arterial elastance: 0.6 ± 0.3 versus 1.2 ± 0.5 mmHg/
ml; P = 0.0005) and a significant increase in left ventricular enddiastolic volume (91 ± 12 versus 70 ± 20 ml; P = 0.006).
Interestingly, right ventricular contractility was reduced after
iloprost-treatment (slope of preload recruitable stroke work: 2.2
± 0.5 versus 3.4 ± 0.8 mWatt·s/ml; P = 0.0002), whereas
ventriculo-vascular coupling remained essentially preserved
(ratio of right ventricular end-systolic elastance to effective
pulmonary arterial elastance: 0.97 ± 0.33 versus 1.03 ± 0.15).
In healthy animals, inhaled iloprost had only minimal
haemodynamic effects and produced no direct effects on
myocardial contractility, even after pharmacological blockade of
the autonomic nervous system.
Conclusions In animals with acute pulmonary hypertension,
inhaled iloprost improved global haemodynamics primarily via
selective pulmonary vasodilatation and restoration of left
ventricular preload. The reduction in right ventricular afterload is
associated with a paradoxical decrease in right ventricular
contractility. Our data suggest that this reflects an indirect
mechanism by which ventriculo-vascular coupling is maintained
at the lowest possible energetic cost. We found no evidence for
a direct negative inotropic effect of iloprost.

Introduction
Because of its marked pulmonary vasodilating effects, ease of
administration and lack of toxicity, intermittent nebulization of
iloprost has become an established therapy in chronic pulmonary hypertension (PHT) [1] and is increasingly being used to
treat postcardiotomy right ventricular (RV) dysfunction [2-4].
There is evidence that ventricular afterload reduction may not
be the sole mechanism by which iloprost, the stable carbacyclin derivative of prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2 [PGI2]),
improves cardiac performance in PHT. PGI2 stimulates the
intracellular synthesis of cAMP [5], and was therefore postulated to have direct positive inotropic effects [6]. However, animal studies have produced conflicting results, showing
positive [7], negative [8] or no inotropic effects [9] of PGI2
infusion in various models. A clinical study demonstrated that
in PHT, inhaled iloprost increases cardiac output more than
nitric oxide [10]. Prostanoids are also known to modify the
autonomic nervous system (ANS) both indirectly (through
hypotension-induced baroreflex activation) and via direct
receptor-mediated effects on sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves [11-14]. It is reasonable to expect that these
diverse pharmacodynamic actions contribute to the haemodynamic effects even of inhaled iloprost, because inhalation of a
single clinical dose produces significant spill-over into the systemic circulation for at least 20 minutes, with up to 76% of the
aerosolized iloprost appearing intravascularly [15,16]. In the
present study we aimed to elucidate the precise mechanism(s)
through which inhaled iloprost affects the cardiovascular system. We used the current 'gold standard' methods to quantify
biventricular contractile performance and cardiac loading conditions in an experimental model for acute PHT as well as in
healthy animals with intact and pharmacologically blocked
ANS.
Materials and methods
This investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, published by the US National Institutes
of Health (Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) [17] and was
approved by the ethics committee of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.
Instrumentation
Twenty-six pigs (mean weight 35 ± 2 kg) were included in the
study. After intramuscular premedication with ketamine (20
mg/kg), piritramide (1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.5 mg), anaesthesia was induced with intravenous sodium pentobarbital (12
mg/kg). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium pentobarbital (3 to 4 mg/kg per hour), sufentanil (3 μg/kg per hour)
and pancuronium (0.2 mg/kg per hour). Mechanical ventilation
with a mixture of oxygen and room air was adjusted to achieve
normocapnia and normoxia, as controlled with arterial blood
gas measurements taken at regular intervals (ABL 520; Radiometer A/S, Brønshøj, Denmark). A balanced electrolyte solution was administered at a rate of 8 ml/kg per hour.
Normothermia was maintained during the entire procedure
using an infrared heating lamp.
A 7.5-Fr central venous catheter was inserted into the femoral
vein. A 16-G arterial catheter was advanced into the descending aorta via the femoral artery. A lateral cut-down was performed in the cervical region and an 8.5-Fr introducer sheath
was inserted into the left carotid artery.
Via a midline sternotomy, a tourniquet was placed around the
inferior vena cava (IVC) for controlled reductions in ventricular
preload. A 20 mm nonrestricting perivascular flow probe
(Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA) was placed around
the main pulmonary artery (PA). A 6-Fr micro-tipped pressure
transducer (SPC 360; Millar Instruments, Houston, TX, USA)
was advanced into the PA via a stab wound in the pulmonary
outflow tract with its tip just distal to the flow probe. Combined
micro-tip multisegment pressure-volume catheters (SPC 560
and SPC 570; Millar Instruments) were inserted into the right
ventricle and left ventricle, through a stab wound in the pulmonary outflow tract and via the left carotid artery, respectively.
Correct position of the conductance catheters was confirmed
with radiography.
Experimental protocol
Haemodynamic measurements were started after completion
of instrumentation and 30 minutes of haemodynamic stabilization. Measurements were always performed with the ventilation suspended at end-expiration. Data were acquired during
steady-state conditions and during a brief period of IVC occlusion to obtain a series of successive heart beats at progressively lower end-diastolic volumes, for the calculation of
contractile indices and pulmonary pressure-flow relationships.
In 16 animals acute PHT was induced with hypoxic pulmonary
vasoconstriction. After control haemodynamic measurements,
nitrogen was added to the inspiratory gas mixture and the fraction of inspired oxygen reduced until the mean PA pressures
exhibited an increase of at least 50% compared with baseline
values (for a detailed description of the ventilator settings and
the arterial blood gas status, see Table 1). When stable
haemodynamic conditions were achieved in hypoxia, haemodynamic measurements were repeated. Pigs were then randomly assigned to two groups: one group (n = 8) received
inhaled iloprost (50 μg dissolved in 5 ml isotonic saline solution), whereas the other group (n = 8) underwent inhalation of
placebo (5 ml isotonic saline solution).
In a subsequent study, including 10 pigs, the effects of inhaled
iloprost (Ilomedin®; Schering Deutschland GmbH, Berlin,
Germany; 50 μg dissolved in 5 ml isotonic saline solution)
were examined with (n = 5) and without (n = 5) blockade of
the ANS. Blockade of the ANS was accomplished with atropine methyl nitrate (3 mg/kg), propranolol hydrochloride (2

mg/kg) and hexamethonium bromide (20 mg/kg; SigmaAldrich NV/SA, Bornem, Belgium).
Haemodynamic and blood gas measurements were performed at the following time points: baseline, and 1, 5, 10 and
30 minutes after stopping iloprost/placebo inhalation. In the
PHT group, measurements at 1 minute after stopping iloprost/
placebo inhalation consisted only of the registration of steadystate haemodynamics, in order not to destabilize the animals
with too frequent IVC occlusions during PHT.
At the end of the experiments, the animals were killed with
intravenously administered potassium chloride during deep
anaesthesia.
Both iloprost and the placebo solution were aerosolized using
a commercially available ultrasonic nebulizer (OPTINEB®-ir;
NEBU-TEC med. Produkte Eike Kern GmbH, Elsenfeld, Germany) connected to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit.
This nebulizer is characterized by a mass median aerodynamic
diameter of 2.3 μm and a geometric standard deviation of 1.6.
Nebulization times were not prefixed as in the chosen mode of
delivery; the device stops automatically when aerosolization of
the volume filled into the nebulizer is completed. Mean nebulization times in our experimental setting were 617 ± 67 seconds. After stopping iloprost/placebo inhalation, an average
fluid amount of 0.50 ± 0.12 ml was found to remain in the
nebulizer.
Data acquisition
Each conductance catheter was connected to a signalprocessing unit (Sigma 5 DF; CDLeycom, Zoetermeer, The
Netherlands), in one of which the excitation frequency had
been adjusted from 20 to 19 kHz in order to avoid cross-talk
[18]. The theory of conductance volumetry has previously
been described extensively [19]. Parallel conductance was
measured by injecting 10 ml hypertonic saline into the right
atrium [20] and blood resistivity was determined. The correction factor α was re-calculated for each measurement.
All parameters were digitized at 333 Hz and stored for off-line
analysis with custom-made algorithms written in Matlab® (The
Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
Data analysis
As previously described, ventricular contractility was quantified with the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Emax; Figure 1) and the slope of the preloadrecruitable stroke work relationship (Mw) [21,22]. Myocardial
energetics of the right ventricle were assessed with computation of the pressure-volume area (PVA). PVA was calculated
as the sum of stroke (external) work (area within the pressurevolume loop) and potential energy (area under the end-systolic
pressure-volume line on the origin side of the pressure-volume
loop; see Additional file 2) [23]. Diastolic function was analyzed using the heart-rate corrected time constant of isovolumetric ventricular relaxation τ [24] and the chamber stiffness
constant β [25]. Right coronary artery perfusion pressure was
estimated as the difference between systolic arterial pressure
and RV systolic pressure [26]. As an estimate for RV oxygen
demand, we calculated the rate-pressure product (RPP). Both
PVA [27] and RPP have been demonstrated to exhibit excellent correlation with measured oxygen consumption in the
right ventricle [28].

Ventricular afterload was quantified as effective arterial
elastance (Ea; the ratio of end-systolic pressure to stroke volume). Ventriculo-vascular coupling was described as the ratio
of Emax over Ea [29]. PA compliance was calculated using the
pulse pressure method [30]. PA resistance was determined
using pressure-flow (PQ) plots that allow discrimination
between passive (flow induced) and active (tone induced)
changes in PA pressures [31]. Pulmonary PQ relations were
obtained by plotting, for every heart beat, the mean PA pressure over cardiac output during the rapid flow reduction
induced by IVC occlusion. The slopes of the resulting PQ plots
were analyzed by linear regression [31]. Vascular resistances
were calculated as pressure gradients over mean flow. PA
impedance was determined from Fourier series expressions of
pressure and flow.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated based on previous experiments. Power analysis revealed a minimal sample size of five
pigs to detect a 33% effect in mean PA pressure and RV-Mw,
when a level of significance of 0.05 and a power of 80% were
to be achieved. Results were statistically analyzed using a
commercially available software package (Statistica© for Windows, version 6.0; Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). To test the global hypothesis that iloprost has an effect on haemodynamic
variables in PHT, the group versus time interaction was analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance with the
within-factor time and the grouping factor treatment (iloprost
versus control). Likewise, the effects of ANS blockade were
tested with the grouping factor autonomic blockade versus no
ANS blockade [32]. In case of significant results, horizontal
and vertical pair-wise contrasts were performed using the
paired and unpaired Student's t-test, respectively. The Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was used to correct for multiple comparisons [33]. Nonparametric data were analyzed using
Friedman's analysis of variance, the Mann-Whitney U-test and
the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
In all conditions, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Haemodynamic effects of hypoxia-induced pulmonary 
hypertension
Alveolar hypoxia caused an increase in mean PA pressure
(Figure 2), calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)
and heart rate, whereas mean arterial pressure and systemic
vascular resistance decreased. The ratio of PVR to systemic
vascular resistance exhibited a nearly threefold increase from
baseline conditions (Table 2).
An increase in RV afterload was indicated by a higher effective
PA-Ea (Figure 3a), a lower PA compliance (Table 3) and a
steeper slope of the PA PQ relationship (Figure 3b). RV contractility was also higher in the presence of PHT, because both
Mw (Figure 3c) and Emax (Figure 3d) increased from baseline
conditions. Hence, ventriculo-vascular coupling (defined as
the quotient of Emax over PA-Ea) was preserved at essentially
the same level as in healthy animals (Table 3). However, there
was also a reduction in RV coronary artery perfusion pressure

Assessment of right ventricular contract Assessment of right ventricular contractility by pressure-volume loop analysis. Presented are RV pressure-volume loops (dotted ility by pressure-volume loop analysis lines) in one representative animal at (a) baseline, in (b) pulmonary hypertension, and (c) 5 minutes after inhalation of iloprost. These were obtained during a controlled 
preload reduction by occlusion of the inferior caval vein. The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship is obtained by fitting a regression line (solid 
line) through the points of maximal (end-systolic) elastance, delineated for each cardiac cycle with grey circles. The induction of pulmonary hypertension elicits an immediate increase in RV contractility (as indicated by the increase in the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship), 
which serves the right ventricle to preserve pump performance without changing preload in the face of high afterload conditions (homeometric 
autoregulation). Conversely, treatment of pulmonary hypertension with inhaled iloprost obviates the need for homeometric autoregulation and allows 
the right ventricle to return to its baseline (lower) contractile state. RV, right ventricular.

in the presence of increased oxygen consumption, indicated
by the elevated RV RPP and PVA (Table 4). RV ejection fraction decreased (Table 3) as a result of an increase in RV endsystolic volumes and unchanged RV end-diastolic volumes
(Figure 4a). RV diastolic function was not affected by induction of PHT, as indicated by isovolumic relaxation and chamber
stiffness (Table 3).
In the left ventricle, Mw increased during hypoxia-induced PHT
whereas Ea was no different from baseline (Table 5). Finally,
PHT caused a significant reduction in left ventricular (LV) enddiastolic volumes (Figure 4b) whereas parameters of LV
diastolic function were not significantly different from control
(Table 5).
Haemodynamic effects of inhaled iloprost in hypoxiainduced pulmonary hypertension
Inhalation of iloprost rapidly restored mean PA pressure and
PVR to baseline values (Figure 2 and Table 2). Animals treated
with iloprost had a significantly higher cardiac output and
mean arterial pressure than did animals in the control group.
RV afterload was significantly decreased, as indicated by a
lower PA-Ea, a higher PA compliance (Figure 3a and Table 3)
and significant reduction in the slopes of the PQ relationships
(Figure 3b). This was accompanied by a reduction in RV contractility; both Mw and Emax decreased as compared with the
untreated PHT condition (Figure 3c,d), which resulted in a
preservation of ventriculo-vascular coupling (Emax/Ea; Table
3). However, in iloprost-treated animals, oxygen supplydemand balance was now significantly improved; right coronary artery perfusion pressure was higher and RV RPP and RV
PVA were lower as compared with untreated PHT animals
(Table 4). RV ejection fraction was significantly improved by
inhaled iloprost, whereas RV end-diastolic volumes and
diastolic function were not affected (Figure 4a and Table 3).
LV contractility, diastolic function and afterload were not
affected (Table 5), but LV end-diastolic volumes were significantly increased after iloprost (Figure 4b).
Haemodynamic effects of inhaled iloprost in healthy 
animals
In undiseased conditions, inhalation of iloprost resulted in a
mild but statistically significant decrease in RV afterload,
whereas other haemodynamic parameters exhibited no major
changes (Figure 5a,b; for a detailed description of haemodynamics in this subset of animals, see Additional file 7). This

was associated with a small reduction in contractility, indicated by both RV Mw and Emax (Figure 5c,d). These effects
were comparable in animals with and without ANS blockade.
Parameters of LV afterload and contractility remained
unchanged after the inhalation of iloprost (data not shown).
Discussion
Our data confirm that inhaled iloprost improves cardiovascular
performance in the presence of acute PHT, primarily through
a selective reduction in RV afterload. Interestingly, the pulmonary vasodilator effects of inhaled iloprost were invariably
associated with a reduction in RV contractility. This is directionally opposite to what in vitro experiments have suggested
earlier, namely that prostacylins may possess positive inotropic properties by stimulating adenyl cyclase activity in cardiomyocytes [34,35].
In vivo work in this area has never provided convincing evidence for a direct positive inotropic effect of PGI2. In clinical
studies, such claims were based on load-dependent haemodynamic indices [6,36]. In experimental studies conducted in
pigs, supraclinical doses of intravenous iloprost caused an elevated contractile state but also systemic hypotension and
tachycardia [7], so that the rise in contractility possibly
resulted from baroreflex-mediated sympathetic activation [37].
Another group found no measurable effect of intravenous PGI2
on contractility using a canine model of load-induced RV dysfunction [9]. We, in contrast, recently reported a dosedependent decrease in RV contractility after intravenous
administration of epoprostenol in pigs with acute PHT [8]. We
hypothesized that this reduced inotropic state was related to
tight coupling between RV afterload and contractility. Indeed,

in a variety of animal models, but also in humans, it was shown
that acute and chronic PHT elicit an immediate increase in RV
contractility [38].
This reflex mechanism is referred to as 'homeometric autoregulation' and is postulated to result from stimulation of stretchactivated calcium channels [39], release of positive inotropic
substances from the endocardial endothelium [40] and/or elevated sympathetic tone [21,41]. Homeometric autoregulation
serves the right ventricle to preserve pump performance without changing preload in the face of high afterload conditions.
Conversely, alleviation of PHT with any effective pulmonary
vasodilator obviates the need for homeometric autoregulation
and allows the right ventricle to return to its baseline (lower)
contractile state. This could be mistaken for a drug-induced
negative inotropic effect. A similar phenomenon has been
described after treatment of PHT with inhaled NO [42]. The
discrepancy between our findings and those reported previously by Kerbaul and coworkers [9], who did not observe an
increase in contractility with PHT or a decrease after intravenous PGI2 treatment, is probably related to differences in the
experimental model; dogs had depressed RV function before
treatment in that study.
Hence, the negative inotropic effects observed during iloprost
inhalation in PHT are similar to our previous findings with intravenous PGI2 [8]. This observation favours the hypothesis that
the reduction in contractility is an indirect phenomenon
caused by the immediate adaptation of RV contractility to
match a drug-induced reduction in RV afterload. However,
basing this hypothesis solely on findings during PHT may be
delusive, because we could not entirely rule out the possibility
that inhaled iloprost might exert a subtle positive inotropic
action, which could have been masked or counteracted by the
predominant effects on RV afterload. We therefore repeated
the experiments in undiseased animals in which pharmacologically induced pulmonary vasodilatation was less pronounced.
Still, we found RV contractility to parallel RV afterload closely
(and not to be increased by iloprost). Interestingly, this mechanism occurred even in ANS blocked animals, suggesting that
the well known interaction of prostanoids with the ANS did not
contribute to our observations.
It appears from our data that matching contractility to the prevailing afterload allowed the right ventricle to preserve global
pump performance at lower energetic cost. PVA and RV RPP,
both estimates of RV oxygen consumption [23,28], normalized
almost to baseline levels after iloprost treatment in animals
with PHT. Right coronary artery perfusion pressure increased,
indicating a simultaneous improvement in RV oxygen supply. It
is tempting to speculate that such an energy-conserving
mechanism contributes to the beneficial effects of iloprost in
the treatment of patients with chronic PHT [1].

The improvement in global haemodynamics by inhaled iloprost
can also, at least partly, be attributed to the phenomenon of
ventricular interdependence. The latter is known to play a key
role in the disruption of circulatory homeostasis during PHT.
The pressure overloaded right ventricle eventually distends
and has a direct impact on LV performance through serial (failure to produce antegrade filling of the left ventricle) and parallel (disturbance of diastolic and systolic LV function by
leftward shifting of the septum) ventricular interaction [43,44].
In fact, reducing RV pressure load with iloprost allowed the
immediate restoration of LV filling after inhalation of iloprost.
Limitations of the study
Several limitations of the present study should be
acknowledged.
Data were obtained in an open chest-open pericardium model
using general anaesthesia. These experimental conditions may
significantly affect cardiovascular mechanics, but we considered them relevant to the setting of cardiac surgery, in which
RV dysfunction is an important risk factor for perioperative
mortality [45]. In addition, opening of the pericardium does not
interfere with serial ventricular interaction. In PHT, series interaction has been demonstrated to account for 65% of the
decrease in LV preload, even after relief of pericardial
constraint [46]. Acute PHT was created by inducing hypoxic
pulmonary vasoconstriction, and this may not be representative for clinical cases of PHT that are unrelated to hypoxia. It is
particularly important to note that in our study healthy pigs
exhibited an ability to increase contractile performance when
they were subjected to hypoxia, whereas in clinical practice
contractile performance and/or contractile reserve of the right
ventricle is often impaired. However, recently published data
obtained in a model of RV failure appear to be in accordance
with our observation, namely that prostacyclins are devoid of
direct positive inotropic effects [9]. The optimal dosage for iloprost therapy in acute PHT remains unknown, because no
dose-response curves are available for this particular situation,
but the selected dose and time in our study is within the range
reported in the literature for humans [15] and pigs [47].
RV coronary perfusion pressure was calculated rather than
measured directly. Because no consensus exists on this matter, we opted to use the difference between systolic arterial
pressure and RV systolic pressure, taking into consideration
the fact that an important part of right coronary artery flow
occurs during systole and that, in PHT, RV coronary artery flow
is impaired proportionally to RV systolic pressures [48].
Finally, the influence of ANS blockade on the effects of iloprost
was not studied in PHT. In pilot experiments, however, ANS
blockade in hypoxia-induced PHT was associated with lethal

cardiovascular collapse, highlighting the importance of the
intact sympathetic nervous system, as shown recently in our
laboratory [21]. Moreover, it must be noted that the iloprostinduced effects were rather short lived. The duration of action
seen in our study is within the range of observations in medical
and surgical patients [4,10], but it contrasts with demonstrated sustained benefits of inhaled iloprost in patients with
primary PHT [1]. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the
long-term effects of PGI2 might not be related simply to
vasodilatation but also to other mechanisms involving pulmonary vascular remodeling [49]. In any case, further pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies are warranted to define
the optimal dosage and strategies to prolong the duration of
action for inhaled iloprost in the perioperative setting.
Conclusion
In animals with acute PHT, inhalation of iloprost resulted in
selective pulmonary vasodilation, which – in contrast to previous findings with systemic application of PGI2 [8] – was associated with an improvement in global haemodynamics and a
restoration of LV preload. The reduction of RV afterload was
associated with a paradoxical decrease in RV contractility. Our
data suggest that this reflects an indirect mechanism by which
ventriculo-vascular coupling is maintained at the lowest possible energetic cost. We found no evidence for a direct negative
inotropic effect of iloprost.
