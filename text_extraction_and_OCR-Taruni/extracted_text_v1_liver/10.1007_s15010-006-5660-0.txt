Abstract
Background: Disseminated aspergillosis is thought to occur 
as a result of vascular invasion from the lungs with subsequent bloodstream dissemination, and portals of entry other 
than sinuses and/or the respiratory tract remain speculative. 
Methods: We report two cases of primary aspergillosis in the 
digestive tract and present a detailed review of eight of the 
23 previously-published cases for which detailed data are 
available. 
Results and Conclusion: These ten cases presented with 
symptoms suggestive of typhlitis, with further peritonitis 
requiring laparotomy and small bowel segmental resection. 
All cases were characterized by the absence of pulmonary 
disease at the time of histologically-confirmed gastrointestinal involvement with vascular invasion by branched 
Aspergillus hyphae. These cases suggest that the digestive 
tract may represent a portal of entry for Aspergillus species 
in immunocompromised patients.

Introduction
Aspergillus spores are ubiquitous, and once aerosolized, 
they may colonize the airways and related structures, such 
as the nose and facial sinuses [1]. Further immunosuppression, such as severe and prolonged neutropenia, markedly 
increases the risk for invasive disease characterized by tissue invasion and secondary bloodstream dissemination [1]. 
Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus 
niger are responsible for the majority of invasive diseases 
[2–4]. Invasive aspergillosis is reported to occur in fewer 
than 1% of patients infected by human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), in 1–5% of liver transplant recipients, in 3–7% 
of allogenic bone marrow transplant recipients, but in up to 
10% of patients with hematological malignancies or lung 
transplants, and as high as 14% of heart transplant recipients [2–7]. 
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounts for 90–98% 
of invasive infections. Extra-pulmonary aspergillosis may 
be present in 25–60% of cases and is almost universally 
described in the context of disseminated diseases [2, 8–15]. 
Although rarely documented before autopsy, these conditions usually result from bloodstream dissemination secondary to vascular invasion at the primary site of infection 
[16]. Isolated extra-pulmonary aspergillosis located in the 
central nervous system, the skin, the liver, the urinary tract 
and the digestive tract has only been mentioned in case 
reports, but potential portals of entry other than the respiratory tract are speculative [2, 3, 17]. We report two cases 
of primary invasive aspergillosis of the digestive tract and 
review the literature on Aspergillus spp. gastrointestinal 
involvement.
Methods
Our objective was to identify lower digestive tract involvement reported in series of invasive aspergillosis and secondly, to identify 
previously-published cases with a possible diagnosis of aspergillosis at this site. We searched the English-language literature from 
1960 to 2005, December, for reports of aspergillosis with digestive 
tract involvement through an electronic search of the MEDLINE 
(National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) database 
using key words “aspergillosis”, “invasive aspergillosis”, “disseminated disease”, “extra-pulmonary aspergillosis” and “digestive tract aspergillosis” and the reference lists of retrieved articles, 
including reviews. Cases were included if the diagnosis of primary 
invasive aspergillosis of the bowel was defined as histologic evidence of Aspergillus hyphae in a segment of the bowel biopsy with 
mucosal alteration and tissue destruction and/or tissue invasion

with microvascular involvement. Cases with isolated involvement 
of the upper digestive tract were excluded.
Case Reports
Case 1
A 65-year-old man presented with septic shock attributed to Proteus vulgaris primary bacteremia without clinical focus of infection. It occurred on day 6 after admission for transformation of a 
myelodysplasic syndrome into acute myeloid leukemia for which 
he received high-dose cytarabine with idarubicin as induction 
therapy. He responded to empirical broad spectrum antibiotics 
within 48 h. Fever recurred on day 10 with abdominal pain, and 
septic shock developed the following day. On day 12, emergency 
laparotomy showed a necrotic mass of the jejunum which was 
resected. Direct histologic examination showed branched hyphae 
with transmural involvement and vascular invasion. After transient improvement for 48 h, multiple organ failure developed. 
Macroscopic Aspergillus colonies appeared on the surgical stomas at day 14 and the patient died on day 16 despite intensive 
support and amphotericin B therapy. Autopsy showed disseminated aspergillosis with several new segmental necroses of the 
small bowel and multiple emboli of fungal material in several organs including the lungs. A detailed examination of the lungs did 
not show any consolidated aera. A. fumigatus was isolated from 
peroperative and autopsy cultures.
Case 2
A 52-year-old man presented with septic shock due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa primary bacteremia without clinical focus of 
infection. The symptoms occurred on day 14 after admission for 
transformation of a myelodysplasic syndrome into acute myelocytic leukemia for which he received high-dose cytarabine with 
idarubicin as induction therapy. He responded to empirical broad 
spectrum antibiotics within 48 h. Fever relapsed on day 25 with abdominal pain. A CT scan excluded lung infiltrates and confirmed 
the diagnostic of typhlitis. On day 30, a laparotomy performed 
for acute peritonitis revealed four masses in the ileon. Histology 
showed branched hyphae (A. fumigatus by culture) with transmural involvement and vascular invasion (Figure 1). A second CT 
scan excluded lung involvement. Therapy with amphotericin B 
(2 g over 28 days) was initiated and the patient made a full recovery on day 45. Two months later he died from hemorrhage during 
induction therapy for autologous bone marrow transplantation. 
Autopsy showed no recurrence of aspergillosis.
Results
Of 23 cases of possible primary invasive aspergillosis of 
the digestive tract identified in the literature [5, 12–14, 18–
22], details were available for only eight of them [23–30] 
(Table 1). 
Nine of ten patients presented with acute hematologic malignancy, and eight received high-dose cytarabine known to be associated with diffuse mucositis. Six 
presented a prior episode of bacteremia during neutropenia. All ten received a combination of antibiotics with 
broad spectrum coverage within the 2 weeks before the 
onset of the abdominal complication, and all presented 
with abdominal symptoms suggestive of typhlitis, with 
digestive hemorrhage in three. Laparotomy was performed 
for acute peritonitis and showed transmural necrosis of the 
small bowel requiring segmental resection in all cases. Histology consisted in multiple lesions from superficial ulceration to transmural necrosis and vascular thrombosis with 
tissue invasion by branched hyphae of Aspergillus spp. were 
present in all cases (Figure 1). All cases were characterized 
by the absence of pulmonary disease at time of histologically-confirmed digestive aspergillosis. Serology and antigenemia was either not available or not performed in all but 
one cases and death occurred in six of ten patients (60%). 
Of 155 clinical studies retrieved from our review of the 
literature, 25 included more than 25 cases of invasive aspergillosis in non-HIV infected adult patients with details on 
the distribution of organs involved (Table 2). There were 6 
autopsy series [11–13, 18, 31, 32], 11 retrospective series [5, 
14, 15, 19, 33–39] and 8 prospective series [20–22, 40–44]. 
The proportion of cases with a definite diagnosis 
was 100% in autopsy series and 73% (60–92%) and 65% 
(31–88%) in retrospective, and prospective series, respectively. The number of cases where the diagnosis was made 
before death increased from 23% (14–56%) in autopsy series, 
76% (28–100%) in retrospective and 99.9% (99–100%) in 
prospective series. Mortality averaged 60% (27–88%) in 
retrospective and 47% (32–64%) in prospective series. This 
may indicate that patients included in prospective studies 
were less critically ill, or may have benefited from early presumptive antifungal therapy. Case-fatality rate was recently 
confirmed to be highest in bone marrow transplant recipients (87%) and among patients with central nervous system 
involvement (88%) [45]. A large number of patients with 
solid organ transplant may have contributed to the higher 
survival rate reported in prospective series.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounted for a 
majority of cases. Bowel involvement during disseminated 
disease was not reported in prospective series and in only 
2% of cases in retrospective series (0–28%). However, 
it was reported in 17% (2–53%) of cases included in the

autopsy series. Apart from 14 cases for which no details 
were available, invasion of the digestive tract was always 
reported in the context of disseminated disease [11–14, 18, 
20, 21, 34, 40, 46]. A mixed infection with Candida species 
was reported in series where more details were available 
[12, 47]. A digestive hemorrhage was reported in most 
cases, but was not considered specific.
Comment
Invasive aspergillosis is almost exclusively considered as 
a pulmonary disease with secondary hematogenous dissemination [1, 5]. Fungal infections of the small and large 
intestine are rare [47]. However, Aspergillus spores are not 
only inhaled but also ingested, and isolated aspergillosis of 
the upper digestive tract has been described [48]. In two 
reviews covering more than 3,000 cases collected from 
several hundreds of articles over three decades, Denning 
suggested that, although never demonstrated, the gastrointestinal tract may be considered as a potential portal of 
entry for Aspergillus spp. [2, 3]. 
In contrast to Candida spp., Aspergillus spores may 
not survive or meet favorable conditions to develop on 
the mucosal surfaces of the digestive tract. However, large 
ulcers, such as those described as occurring after highTable 2

dose cytarabine-related mucositis, may be colonized by 
Aspergillus spores [48]. This may also be the case for patients 
developing a neutropenic or necrotizing enterocolitis, also 
referred to as typhlitis. This defines an abdominal complication occurring in neutropenia and induced by chemotherapy [49]. It complicates 5–30% of treatments, including 
those with high-dose cytarabine, with variable clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to 
life-threatening intestinal necrosis with perforation and secondary peritonitis [50, 51]. The latter condition mandates a 
surgical approach and has been associated with mortality 
rates of over 50% [52, 53]. Although not specific, abdominal 
CT scan may be suggestive. The eventual value of Aspergillus serology and antigenemia has not been studied in this 
context. Diffuse dilatation with edema of the bowel walls, 
predominantly located in the caecum, with some degree of 
hemorrhage and necrosis are common pathological findings [54]. As described in the ten above-mentioned cases, 
bowel necrosis is associated with the invasion of a poorly 
vascularized wall by gram-negative bacilli and yeast after 
breakdown of the normal flora [52, 55]. 
In conclusion, we report two cases of possible primary digestive aspergillosis. These two cases and the eight 
previously published suggest that the digestive tract may 
represent a portal of entry for Aspergillus species in immunocompromised patients.
