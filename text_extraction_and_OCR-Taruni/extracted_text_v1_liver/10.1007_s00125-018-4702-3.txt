Abstract
Aims/hypothesis In addition to beneficial effects on glycaemia and cardiovascular death, empagliflozin improves adiposity
indices. We investigated the effect of empagliflozin on aminotransferases (correlates of liver fat) in individuals with type 2
diabetes.
Methods Changes from baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were assessed in the
EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial (n = 7020), pooled data from four 24-week placebo-controlled trials (n = 2477) and a trial of
empagliflozin vs glimepiride over 104 weeks (n = 1545). Analyses were performed using data from all participants and by tertiles
of baseline aminotransferases.
Results In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, mean ± SE changes from baseline ALT at week 28 were −2.96 ± 0.18 and −0.73 ±
0.25 U/l with empagliflozin and placebo, respectively (adjusted mean difference: −2.22 [95% CI −2.83, −1.62]; p < 0.0001).
Reductions in ALT were greatest in the highest ALT tertile (placebo-adjusted mean difference at week 28: −4.36 U/l [95% CI
−5.51, −3.21]; p < 0.0001). The adjusted mean difference in change in ALT was −3.15 U/l (95% CI −4.11, −2.18) with
empagliflozin vs placebo at week 24 in pooled 24-week data, and −4.88 U/l (95% CI −6.68, −3.09) with empagliflozin vs
glimepiride at week 28. ALT reductions were largely independent of changes in weight or HbA1c. AST changes showed similar
patterns to ALT, but the reductions were considerably lower.
Conclusions/interpretation These highly consistent results suggest that empagliflozin reduces aminotransferases in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, in a pattern (reductions in ALT>AST) that is potentially consistent with a reduction in liver fat, especially
when ALT levels are high.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to
affect more than half of those with type 2 diabetes [1–3].
The first recognisable stage of NAFLD is hepatic steatosis,

when the fat content exceeds 5% of the liver volume [4].
Mechanistic insights suggest that ectopic liver fat is probably part of the pathogenic process in diabetes, contributing
to hepatic insulin resistance, excess gluconeogenesis and
higher fasting glucose levels [5]. Furthermore, hepatic
steatosis due to NAFLD leads to, and is often clinically
suspected by, increased levels of aminotransferases, with
levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding those
of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [4]. Elevated ALT
levels (typically >40–50 U/l) are common in individuals
with type 2 diabetes [6–8] and for a given serum ALT, those
with type 2 diabetes have more liver fat compared with
BMI-, age- and sex-matched individuals without diabetes
[9]. In a minority of individuals, hepatic steatosis progresses
to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), at which point liver inflammation and fibrosis necessitate monitoring and interventions to prevent progression to cirrhosis and other
life-threatening sequelae [4]. In individuals with type 2 diabetes and elevated liver enzymes or NAFLD, improved
glucose control may be important to delay the progression
of liver disease [10, 11]. The glucose-lowering agents pioglitazone [12] and liraglutide [13] have been shown to reduce liver fat in individuals with NASH with and without
type 2 diabetes, but the effects of newer agents on liver fat
are less well studied.
Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce hyperglycaemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes by
decreasing renal glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing
urinary glucose excretion and lowering HbA1c [14].
Empagliflozin, a highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor, was the
first glucose-lowering agent to demonstrate a reduction in
cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes
and established cardiovascular disease, driven by a 38%
reduction in cardiovascular death vs placebo [15].
Empagliflozin is associated with weight loss [15–22], probably due to osmotic diuresis and loss of calories in the urine
[14, 23]. Nearly 90% of the weight loss with empagliflozin
is due to a reduction in fat mass, with reductions in both
abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue [22].
This, in addition to improvements in other adiposity
markers with empagliflozin [24], led us to hypothesise that
empagliflozin may improve liver fat.
In the current analyses, we investigated the effects of
empagliflozin on ALT and AST using several datasets collected in individuals with type 2 diabetes: the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME® trial in participants with type 2 diabetes and
established cardiovascular disease [15], pooled data from
four Phase III trials [16–19] and a head-to-head trial of
empagliflozin vs glimepiride [22]. Given that empagliflozin
therapy is associated with weight loss, we hypothesised that
empagliflozin would lower ALT and AST, with greater reductions in ALT than AST, and that absolute reductions
would be most evident in participants with higher ALT
levels at baseline. We also investigated the contribution of
weight loss and reduction in HbA1c to improvements in
ALT.

Methods
Study participants The effect of empagliflozin on liver enzymes was analysed from three data sources. First, in the
EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial (NCT01131676), participants
with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 53–75 mmol/mol [7–9%] for
drug-naive participants and 53–86 mmol/mol [7–10%] for
those on stable glucose-lowering therapy), established cardiovascular disease, BMI ≤45 kg/m2
, and eGFR (according to
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]) ≥30 ml/
min/1.73 m2 were randomised 1:1:1 to receive empagliflozin
10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo once daily.
Background glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12 weeks. After week 12, investigators were encouraged to adjust glucose-lowering therapy to achieve
glycaemic control according to local guidelines. They were
also encouraged to treat cardiovascular risk factors to achieve
the best standard of care according to local guidelines
throughout the trial. The trial was planned to continue until
at least 691 participants had experienced an adjudicated event
included in the primary outcome (three-point major adverse
cardiovascular events: composite of cardiovascular death,
non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) [15].
Second, liver enzyme data from four Phase III trials in
participants with type 2 diabetes were pooled. In these
trials, participants with BMI ≤45 kg/m2
, eGFR (MDRD)
≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (or ≥50 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the monotherapy trial) and HbA1c ≥53 to ≤86 mmol/mol (≥7 to
≤10%) were randomised 1:1:1 to receive empagliflozin
10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo once daily for
24 weeks as monotherapy (NCT01177813) [16], add-on
to metformin (NCT01159600) [17], add-on to metformin
plus sulfonylurea (NCT01159600) [18] or add-on to pioglitazone with or without metformin (NCT01210001)
[19]. Rescue medication could be initiated if, after an
overnight fast, a participant had a confirmed plasma glucose concentration of >13.3 mmol/l during weeks 1–12 or
>11.1 mmol/l during weeks 12–24.
Finally, liver enzymes were analysed in the initial 104-
week period of the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial, in which participants with type 2 diabetes, BMI ≤45 kg/m2
, HbA1c 53–
86 mmol/mol (7–10%) and eGFR (MDRD) ≥60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 were randomised 1:1 to receive once-daily
empagliflozin 25 mg or glimepiride 1–4 mg as add-on to metformin (NCT01167881) [22]. Glimepiride was initiated at a
dose of 1 mg/day, with a recommendation for uptitration if
fasting plasma glucose (assessed with home monitoring) was
>6.1 mmol/l, to 2 mg/day at week 4, 3 mg/day at week 8 and
4 mg/day at week 12. Rescue medication could be initiated if,
after an overnight fast, a participant had a confirmed blood
glucose concentration of >13.3 mmol/l during weeks 1–12,
>11.1 mmol/l during weeks 12–28 or >10.0 mmol/l (or
HbA1c >64 mmol/mol [>8%]) after week 28.
For all the trials that contributed data to these analyses, the
clinical trial protocol was approved by the relevant institutional
review boards and local independent ethics committees, and all
of the trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization
guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Participants provided
signed and dated informed consent before entering each trial.
ALT and AST measurements In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME®
trial, samples for analysis of liver aminotransferases were taken during study visits at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 28 and 52,
and then every 14 weeks until the end of the trial. In the 24-
week placebo-controlled trials, samples for analysis of liver
aminotransferases were taken during study visits at baseline
and at weeks 12 and 24. In the initial 104 weeks of the EMPAREG H2H-SU trial, samples for analysis of liver aminotransferases were taken during study visits at baseline and at weeks
12, 28, 52, 78 and 104. In all studies, analyses of liver aminotransferases were performed by a central laboratory.
Analysis Changes from baseline in ALT and AST were
assessed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM)
analyses, including baseline ALT or AST and baseline
HbA1c as linear covariates and region, baseline BMI, baseline
eGFR, study, treatment, visit, baseline HbA1c by visit interaction, baseline ALT or AST by visit interaction and visit by
treatment interaction as fixed effects. The analysis of EMPAREG OUTCOME® data included an additional factor for the
last week a participant could have had an ALT or AST measurement. MMRM analyses were based on observed cases,
including values after initiation of rescue medication. In analyses of EMPA-REG OUTCOME® and pooled data from the
24-week trials, analyses were performed for the pooled
empagliflozin group and placebo. In each dataset, changes in
ALT were analysed in all participants and in tertiles by ALT at
baseline, and changes in AST were analysed in all participants
and in tertiles by AST at baseline. Data are expressed as adjusted means (95% CI) or adjusted means ± SE.
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, the contribution of
changes in weight or HbA1c (individual and combined effects)
to changes in ALT at weeks 28, 52 and 164 (median observation
time) were assessed using MMRM analyses as described above,
with additional factors for change in HbA1c or weight and, for
weight analyses only, baseline weight by visit interaction. These
contribution analyses were performed for all participants.

98.3 mmol/mol (8.1 ± 0.85%). Mean ± SD ALT was 26.2 ±
15.3 U/l in the placebo group and 25.5 ± 13.8 U/l in the
empagliflozin group, and AST was 22.9 ± 10.3 and 22.5 ±
9.6 U/l, respectively.
Data pooled from the 24-week trials included data from
2477 participants (825 in the placebo group and 1652 in the
pooled empagliflozin group). Baseline participant characteristics in the individual trials have been previously described
[16–19]. In the pooled dataset, 62% were male, 56% were of
Asian race and 41% were white, baseline mean ± SD BMI was
29.0 ± 5.5 kg/m2
, weight was 78.6 ± 18.8 kg and HbA1c was
64 ± 9.3 mmol/mol (7.99 ± 0.85%). Mean ± SD ALT was
28.4 ± 17.2 U/l in the placebo group and 28.2 ± 15.7 U/l in
the empagliflozin group, and AST was 23.1 ± 10.4 and 23.0 ±
9.7 U/l, respectively.
In the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial, 1545 participants were
treated (780 in the glimepiride group and 765 in the
empagliflozin group). Baseline participant characteristics
have been previously described [22]. In brief, 55% were male,
66% were white and 33% were of Asian race, mean ± SD BMI
was 30.1 ± 5.3 kg/m2
, weight was 82.8 ± 19.2 kg and HbA1c
was 63.0 ± 9.2 mmol/mol (7.92 ± 0.84%). Mean ± SD ALT
was 31.2 ± 22.6 U/l in the glimepiride group and 31.9 ±
19.6 U/l in the empagliflozin group, and AST was 25.0 ±
12.8 and 24.7 ± 11.6 U/l, respectively.
Changes in ALT In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial,
ALT decreased from baseline to week 28 and thereafter
remained stable in the empagliflozin group, and declined steadily and to a lesser extent in the placebo
group (Fig. 1a). Mean ± SE changes from baseline were
−2.96 ± 0.18 U/l in the empagliflozin group and −0.73 ±
0.25 in the placebo group at week 28 (adjusted mean
difference: −2.22 [95% CI −2.83, −1.62]; p < 0.0001)
and −3.06 ± 0.25 U/l and −1.80 ± 0.36 U/l, respectively,
at week 164 (adjusted mean difference: −1.26 [95% CI

164 (Table 1). In the second tertile, differences with
empagliflozin vs placebo in changes from baseline in ALT
were −1.45 (95% CI −2.65, −0.24; p = 0.0188) at week 28
and −0.91 (95% CI −2.59, 0.77; p = 0.2903) at week 164. In
the lowest tertile, changes from baseline in ALT were similar
between empagliflozin and placebo at weeks 28 and 164 (Fig.
1b). Similar patterns of changes in ALT were observed with
empagliflozin vs placebo in the pooled 24-week trial data
(Fig. 2a and electronic supplementary material [ESM] Fig.
1), and with empagliflozin vs glimepiride over 104 weeks in
the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial (Fig. 2b, ESM Fig. 2).
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, treatment differences in ALT were largely independent of concomitant changes in HbA1c or weight in the overall trial population (Table 2).
Changes in AST In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, AST
decreased from baseline to week 28 and thereafter remained
stable in the empagliflozin group, while there were no relevant
changes in the placebo group (ESM Fig. 3a). Mean ± SE
changes from baseline were −1.32 ± 0.14 U/l in the
empagliflozin group and −0.31 ± 0.20 in the placebo group
at week 28 (adjusted mean difference: −1.01 U/l [95% CI
−1.48, −0.54]; p < 0.0001), and −1.17 ± 0.23 U/l and −0.51
± 0.33 U/l, respectively at week 164 (adjusted mean difference: −0.66 U/l [95% CI −1.45, 0.13]; p = 0.1007) (Table 1).
Reductions from baseline in AST with empagliflozin were
greatest in participants in the highest tertile of AST at baseline
(ESM Fig. 3b), in whom the adjusted mean difference with
empagliflozin vs placebo was −1.53 U/l (95% CI −2.35,
−0.72; p = 0.0002) at week 28 and −0.99 U/l (95% CI
−2.34, 0.36; p = 0.1504) at week 164 (Table 1). Changes from
baseline ASTwere similar between empagliflozin and placebo
at weeks 28 and 164 in the second and third tertiles (ESM Fig.
3b). Similar patterns of changes in AST were observed with
empagliflozin vs placebo in the pooled 24-week trial data
(ESM Fig. 4), and with empagliflozin vs glimepiride over
104 weeks in the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial (ESM Fig. 5).
In all studies examined, while not compared statistically,
changes in AST were of a substantially lower magnitude than
changes in ALT (Table 1).
Discussion
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with NAFLD, which is
reflected by increased liver aminotransferase levels. ALT
levels above the upper limit of normal and AST levels lower
than those of ALT are typical findings supporting the presence
of NAFLD in real-life clinical practice in primary care [4]. Our
analyses from three large datasets from clinical trials of
empagliflozin in individuals with type 2 diabetes have shown
that treatment with empagliflozin consistently lowered ALT
and AST levels. The reductions in ALT observed with
empagliflozin were consistently greater than the reductions
in AST, more prominent in participants with the highest
ALT levels at baseline and largely independent of changes in
HbA1c and weight. Changes in ALT and AST were minimal in
participants with the lowest levels at baseline, who would be
predicted to have the lowest liver fat levels.
Transaminases, in particular ALT, are useful correlates of
liver fat. The overall patterns of change in ALT observed with
empagliflozin are broadly consistent with a reduction in liver
fat [4]. The twin-cycle hypothesis of diabetes postulates that
excess liver and pancreatic fat are major components of the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes [25]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that, among individuals with type 2 diabetes, those with a hospital record of NAFLD have an

increased risk of all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular disease and incident/recurrent cardiovascular events than
those without a record of liver disease [26]. Hence, any treatment that lowers liver fat and the risk of progression to more
advanced liver disease could have important benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes.
The mechanisms by which empagliflozin might reduce
aminotransferases or liver fat are unclear. Data from animal
models support a direct effect of empagliflozin on reducing
liver fat and improving hepatic glucose handling. In db/db
mice, glucose uptake in the liver and kidneys has been reported to be higher in mice treated with empagliflozin than in
controls [27], and in a NASH model generated by administration of streptozotocin to C57BL/6J mice, empagliflozin attenuated the development of NASH via anti-steatotic and antiinflammatory effects [28]. The SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin
has also been shown to improve markers of liver fat in individuals with type 2 diabetes and NASH [29]. Further emerging evidence, albeit from a much smaller trial, has linked
treatment with other SGLT2 inhibitors to reductions in liver
fat (and ALT) equivalent to those seen with pioglitazone in
individuals with type 2 diabetes [30].
Liver fat was not measured directly in any of the studies used
in our analyses. However, in a study using magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, ALT levels were found to correlate reasonably
well with the extent of liver fat in individuals with type 2 diabetes (r = 0.66), even though liver fat levels were disproportionately (200%) higher in those with type 2 diabetes than in control
participants without diabetes at given ALT levels in the range of
50–200 U/l [9]. This suggests that in individuals with type 2
diabetes, reductions in ALT from higher baseline levels (equivalent to the top ALT tertile in our analyses) are more likely to be
associated with meaningful reductions in liver fat. In the current
analysis, the patterns of reduction, the greater effects observed
when baseline ALT was higher and the consistent observations
across three large datasets lend confidence that our findings
reflect a real clinical action of empagliflozin. However, we
accept that further trials are needed, including those that take
histological measures of NASH in individuals with type 2 diabetes before and after treatment. Ongoing trials, including longterm trials of empagliflozin in individuals with heart failure
(NCT03057977, NCT03057951) and chronic kidney disease
[31], will provide additional data.
We also accept that ALT levels at baseline were measured
at only a single point in time and that a sustained elevation in
ALT is potentially a better marker of a higher level of liver fat.
While overall reductions in ALT were modest, reductions with
empagliflozin relative to placebo or sulfonylurea were in the
order of 4–7 U/l in those with higher ALT levels at baseline,
which appears meaningful. Finally, of course, we accept that
other conditions that influence the liver, such as hepatitis or
excess alcohol intake, can influence ALT and AST levels,
although alcohol does so in a different pattern [4].
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the greater changes in ALT
that we observed with empagliflozin vs placebo could occur
via effects on subclinical hepatitis, which would be present in
only a minority of individuals.
In conclusion, our results suggest that in individuals with
type 2 diabetes, treatment with empagliflozin reduces liver
aminotransferases, largely independent of changes in weight

and glycaemic control, and does so in a pattern that is potentially consistent with reductions in liver fat. These highly consistent trial findings add meaningfully to the emerging evidence from smaller trials on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors
on direct measures of liver fat, and collectively suggest a potential role for this class of drugs in managing NAFLD in type
2 diabetes. Further trials should now be promoted to enable an
indication to be developed.
