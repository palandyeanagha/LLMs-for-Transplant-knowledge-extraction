Remdesivir initially was intravenously administrated to treat the Ebola disease however right now 
it has been administered to treat COVID-19 in some countries. However it is necessary to find the 
exact effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir solution is administered with a 
cyclodextrin carrier that filters solely by the glomeruli; thereby patients with abnormal renal function 
cannot eliminate it quickly; therefore, remdesivir can lead to renal failure or liver dysfunction during 
therapeutic process of COVID-19. Assessment of renal function in patients with COVID-19 who 
have acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage renal disease is fundamental.
ABSTRACT
Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
In the patients taking remdesivir, liver and kidney function tests should be monitored daily, and remdesivir should be held in patients with 
increased liver enzymes or kidney function impairment.

Introduction
Remdesivir was first developed by the Gilead 
pharmaceutical company and has the ability to treat 
a wide range of viruses, such as severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS), Marburg marburgvirus and the 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It was used 
to treat the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa from 
2013 to 2016 (1, 2). Remdesivir is considered as a mono 
phosphoramidate medication of an adenosine analogue 
that has a broad antiviral spectrum (3). The Food and 
Drug Administration has authorized the emergency 
administration of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 in the United States because remdesivir 
can reduce recovery time by 31% (one-third). This 
declaration on remdesivir was happed after publishing 
of the results of the administration of this drug on 61 
patients (22 patients from the United States, 22 patients 
from Europe or Canada, and 9 patients from Japan) 
who received at least one dose of remdesivir. Mortality 
was 18% in patients under mechanical ventilator who 
received remdesivir and 5% in patients who did not need 
a mechanical ventilator (4,5). There are some side effects 
of remdesivir including nausea, phlebitis, headache, 
constipation, pain in the extremities and ecchymosis (5,6).

Methods 
In this mini-review, international databases including 
PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were considered 
for search of English articles from 31 December 2019 
to 15 August 2020. All type of articles was included. 
Keywords were COVID-19, novel coronavirus, 2019-
nCoV, coronavirus disease 2019, renal involvement, 
renal injury, renal failure, kidney injury, kidney failure, 
kidney involvement, remdesivir, veklury, GS-5734, liver 
injury, and liver involvement. After collection of articles 
of interest, references imported to Endnote software 
and removed duplicate titles. The selected studies were 
performed on humans and published in English. 
COVID-19 and kidney at a glance
While, a clinical study revealed that about one-third of 
patients who developed COVID-19 experienced acute 
renal failure (ARF), however in the patients more than 60 
years, two-thirds of patients had ARF since the antigen 
against novel coronavirus accumulates in renal tubules 
following COVID-19 (7). Recent clinical studies in 
patients with COVID-19 showed that 27% of patients 
have elevated plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels 
while proteinuria occurs in 63% of the studied individuals 
(7, 8).
COVID-19 and liver at a glance
Liver involvement accompanied by high alanine 
aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) has been firstly 
presented in Wuhan in which involved 43% of the patients 
developed COVID-19 (9). In the study carried out on 
417 Chinese patients with COVID-19, the increased 
liver tests were presented in the majority of the patients 
(76.3%) and accordingly 21.5% of patients reported liver 
injury during hospitalization especially during the 14 days 
after admission. Additionally, patients who have increased 
level of liver tests, have higher chance for severe form of 
COVID-19 (4). In Wuhan, 15.4% of the patients with 
COVID-19 had acute liver injury (10).
Remdesivir and COVID-19-related renal failure
As mentioned, remdesivir was intravenously administrated 
to treat the Ebola disease, in which it was enough to 
tolerate by the patients with Ebola; however, this drug 
is less effective than several monoclonal antibodies. 
Remdesivir has been utilized to treat COVID-19 in some 
countries, while, there is further need to study the exact 
effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19 (11).
Remdesivir prescription should be traded off cautiously 
in pregnant or breast-feeding women, cirrhosis, ALT 
or AST more than five times the upper limit of normal 
range and severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or receipt of 
continuous renal replacement therapy). In a randomized 
clinical trial 158 patients divided into remdesivir group 
and 79 patients divided into placebo group. This 
study showed that the most common adverse events 
in the intervention group were anemia, constipation, 
hypoalbuminaemia, hypokalemia, increased total 
bilirubin, and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, in the 
placebo group, the most common adverse events were 
hypoalbuminaemia, constipation, anemia, hypokalemia, 
increased AST, hyperlipidemia, and increased total 
bilirubin. According to the serious adverse events, the 
two groups were different (12% in the intervention group 
versus 5% in the control group). In the remdesivir group, 
more patients discontinued the drug compared to the 
control group (12).
Remdesivir is administered intravenously and has limited 
water solubility; therefore it is given with a cyclodextrin 
carrier. This carrier is filtered solely by the glomeruli; 
thereby patients with normal renal function eliminate 
it quickly. Conversely, patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI) are at risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Each 100 
mg of remdesivir powder contains 3 gr of cyclodextrin, 
and the solution contains 6 g. In addition, based on the 
experience with voriconazole, both dialysis and continuous 
renal replacement therapy should effectively remove 
cyclodextrin (13). Sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin 
sodium (SBECD) is applied in the formulation process as a 
solubilizing agent because remdesivir has limited aqueous 
solubility feature. Since SBECD has a renal excretion 
root, patients with moderate or severe renal impairment 
have exposure to SBECD. Hence a close look on eGFR 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate) is needed in the time 
of administration of remdesivir, especially in patients with 
renal impairment. The discontinuation of remdesivir is 
required if eGFR levels drop to half level from baseline. 
Remdesivir has contraindication in patients with severe 
renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min) (14). 
Remdesivir-induced liver injury in patients with 
COVID-19
According to the Gilead company declaration, laboratory 
abnormalities during the phase-1 trials were presented as 
the increased liver enzymes, coagulopathy and blood sugar 
in <5% of the patients. Additionally, serious adverse events 
were septic shock and AKI in 23% of cases, in such a way 
that 8% of the patients discontinued because of the side 
effects after the use of remdesivir (15). Wang et al carried 
out a study on 61 patients taking remdesivir consisting of 
a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on the admission 
day and 100 mg daily for the other days for ten days. The 
increase of liver enzyme was observed in 12 patients. In 
addition, renal impairment was observed in seven patients

with invasive ventilation and AKI in two patients with 
invasive ventilation (12).
Currently, there is very low-evidence regarding the 
potential hepatotoxicity of remdesivir. Considering 
its effective results in patients developed COVID-19 
infection and the high frequency of liver involvement 
following COVID-19, the attribution of liver dysfunction 
to the administration of remdesivir is challenging and 
further studies are needed in this regard (16).
Zampino et al to study the liver injury in treated 
COVID-19 patients revealed that remdesivir may cause 
hepatocellular toxicity. Although there were five patients 
(low-number) however, obvious increasing trend of 
bilirubin and ALT/AST was found following remdesivir 
administration. They suggested close monitoring of liver 
function tests in patients taking remdesivir for treating 
COVID-19 (17).
Conclusion
Nephropathy and liver involvement may occur due 
to direct inflammatory effect of cytokines following 
COVID-19. Both liver and renal dysfunctions are 
prognostic factors in the mortality rate of COVID-19 
and usually happen in severely ill patients. Remdesivir can 
also lead to renal dysfunction or liver involvement during 
medical treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, prescribing 
drugs such as remdesivir should proceed with extreme 
caution. Patients who had liver disease or who undergo 
continuous or intermittent dialysis or those with transient 
AKI may not be the safe candidates to receive remdesivir. 
Therapy assessment in patients with COVID-19 who have 
AKI or end-stage renal disease is fundamental in which 
needs primary assessments of the pros and cons, while 
the patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for suffering 
from lots of morbidity and mortality. In the patients 
taking remdesivir, liver function tests must be monitored 
daily, and remdesivir should be held in patients with high 
ALT level more than five times the allowable limit.
