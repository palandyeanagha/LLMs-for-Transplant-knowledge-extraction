Several consensus and guidelines recently updated their
recommendations for the management of Candida infection. Interestingly, neither the Infectious Diseases Society
of America (IDSA) guidelines [1] nor the European
consensus [2] gave any clarification on the issues raised
by Candida peritonitis, while epidemiological data over
the last decades have shown that non-candidemic invasive
candidiasis, mostly peritonitis, is a frequent and lifethreatening complication in surgical critically ill patients
[3–5].
In their article published in the current issue of
Intensive Care Medicine, Bassetti et al. [6] propose
specific recommendations from a consensus of experts.
This laudable attempt is a first and welcome step but, as
expected, it also highlights the moderate or low quality
of evidence in many fields. Patients who test positive for
fungal infection during the course of intra-abdominal
infections share many similarities with those infected
with other forms of invasive candidiasis [3–5, 7, 8].
These features are a source of confusion to many physicians, leading to a reductive assimilation of the
peritonitis cases with those of other forms of invasive
candidiasis and candidemia, and this approach may
unfortunately be responsible for a large overuse of antifungals [1, 2].
Candida peritonitis cases have a number of important
specific characteristics that deserve a specific treatment
approach and specific management (Fig. 1).
The first of these is the pathophysiology of peritoneal
contamination. The common issues of risk factors, progressive colonization, and invasion do not matter when a
perforation of the hollow viscus releases Candida cells
contained in the bowel flora within the peritoneum.
These are typical cases of community-acquired peritonitis where surgical management, including cleaning of
the abdominal cavity and a short antibiotic course, will
result in a rapid complete recovery. In these cases,
microbiological cultures are not recommended [9],
except for patients with septic shock and multiple organ
failure, the isolation of Candida does not reflect Candida
peritonitis, and additional antifungals should be avoided
[3, 5, 10]. This situation contrasts with recurrent peritonitis, such as anastomotic leakage, in which the
process described for invasive candidiasis might be more
significant and for which there is some evidence for the
benefits of early empirical antifungal treatment [11, 12].
The difficult cases, such as patients who underwent a
first re-operation for postoperative peritonitis, fall in

between these two sketched situations and represent
situations where the prediction of Candida peritonitis is
challenging.
The second specific characteristic of Candida peritonitis is that additional circumstances have been reported
where Candida cells emerge progressively, influenced
through combined exposure to well-known risk factors,
such as broad-spectrum antibiotic pressure, previous
abdominal surgery, parenteral nutrition, renal replacement
therapy, central venous catheter, among others. In these
‘‘at high risk’’ cases, the issue is no longer ‘‘do we need’’
to treat these cases but rather ‘‘when’’ should we initiate
the antifungal treatment. In these circumstances, infection
will not develop within hours but over days [3, 5, 13], and
except for candidemia reported in a minority of the
peritonitis cases [4, 5], an emergency antifungal treatment
is not a validated approach, as would be the case in the
treatment of sepsis of bacterial origin. A large part of the
common confusion lies in these different clinical situations, as they complicate the decision-making process of
the experts in coming to a consensus regarding the
diagnosis and treatment.

To improve readability and prioritization of the long
list of recommendations provided by Bassetti et al. [6],
we would like to emphasize several points which may
help clinicians identify early those surgical patients who
truly would benefit from treatment with.
First, we do not have any good tool to determine
whether fungi cultured from mixed polymicrobial bacterial and fungal samples should be considered, and the
time course of colonization and infection may be
unknown compared to the known process of infection that
has been well-described in candidemia. For this very
reason, specific clinical scores [10], which are not suitable
for candidemia, may help the clinician in choosing to
initiate antifungal treatment, especially in the most severe
patients, while awaiting mycological results. Alternatively, high negative predictive values of clinical scores
might help to eliminate yeast infection in communityacquired or nosocomial non-postoperative infections and
avoid useless antifungal treatments [14]. However, theses
scores remain to be validated in large multicenter cohorts
of patients.
Second, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence supporting the reduction of further yeast intraabdominal infection with prophylaxis or preemptive
treatment, even in subgroups of high-risk patients. We are
eagerly awaiting the results of the largest randomized trial
(INTENSE) that ended in 2012 (NCT01122368) in which
micafungin was compared to placebo in 252 high-risk
surgical patients (anastomotic leakage or a stay in the ICU
for [4 days after abdominal surgery).
Third, commonly used biomarkers are largely inaccurate for the diagnosis of non-candidemic infections
(Table 1). C-reactive protein is not specific, and procalcitonin levels rise modestly compared to
bacteriological infections [15]. Among the specific fungal
biomarkers, PCR can be used to detect candidemia early,
but the assay is insensitive for other candidiasis. (1 ? 3)-
b-D-Glucan (BG), part of the fungal wall, is a useful
biomarker for the diagnosis of invasive mycoses in highrisk hemato-oncological patients. In patients who have
undergone abdominal surgery, several studies have
recently shown that BG has higher positive predictive
values than the colonization index and Candida scores,
with increasing levels 3–5 days before the development
of non-candidemic invasive candidiasis correlating well
with disease development [16–18]. In addition, the levels
of BG have been found to decrease in patients responding
to antifungals but to remain high or even increase in cases
of treatment failure [18]. However, the eventual clinical
impact of its use remains to be determined in specific
prospective studies.
Fourth, the importance of organ dysfunction or septic
shock in the need to initiate early antifungal treatment
remains to be assessed. While evidence supporting early
antifungal treatment in the course of candidemia and
other form of invasive candidiasis is available, we do not
yet know if any delay in providing empirical treatment in
these life-threatening cases of community-acquired or
nosocomial cases will have negative effects.
Thanks to the contribution of Bassetti et al. [6], we
have now to explore which questions need to addressed
and identify the most interesting approaches with the aim
of improving the diagnosis, initiating and developing an
efficient therapy, and preserving the efficacy of the antiTable 1 Limitations of current clinical/biological tools in the diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis
