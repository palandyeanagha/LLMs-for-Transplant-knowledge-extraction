Abstract
The liver plays a critical role in both immune defense and tolerance in the body. The liver-resident immune cells (LrICs)
determine the immune properties, but the unique composition and heterogeneity of these cells are incompletely
understood. Here, we dissect the diversity of LrICs by a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling using the unbiased
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). A total of 70, 706 of CD45+ immune cells from the paired liver perfusion,
spleen and peripheral blood as references were profiled. We identified more than 30 discrete cell populations
comprising 13 of T and NK cell, 7 of B cell, 4 of plasma cell, and 8 of myeloid cell subsets in human liver and donorpaired spleen and blood, and characterized their tissue distribution, gene expression and functional modules.
Especially, four of CXCR6+ T and NK cell subsets were found to be present preferentially in the liver, where they
manifested heterogeneity, distinct function and prominent homeostatic proliferation. We propose a universal category
system of T and NK cells based on distinct chemokine receptors, confirmed subsequently by phenotype,
transcriptional factors and functionality. We also identified adaptive changes by the spleen and liver-derived monocyte
and macrophage populations. Finally, we give a global glimpse on B cell and plasma cell subsets in human spleen and
liver. We, therefore, reveal the heterogeneity and functional diversity of LrICs in human. This study presents
comprehensively the landscape of LrICs and will enable further study on their roles in various human diseases.
Introduction
The liver is the largest human solid organ and sits
between the digestive and circulatory systems. Essential
functions of the liver, include protein synthesis and
metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and
vitamins. Immunologically, the liver is not only responsible for detecting exogenous pathogens and antigens in
systemic circulation, but also is tasked with facilitating
immune tolerance which protects the host from antigenic
overload of dietary components, drugs, and bacterial
products originating in the gut1
. The underlying
mechanisms maintaining these dual immune properties of
liver are yet to be determined. Dissecting the unique
milieu and function of hepatic immune cells, which are
significantly different from those present in immune
organs (e.g., spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow), will
be essential for understanding liver-specific immunological properties and immune-mediated events implicated
in liver diseases2,3
. Liver immune cells are heterogeneous
and consist of multiple subsets with various immune
functions, including not only of conventional T cells, B
cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes4
. Recent
reports identify the existence of LrT cells5
, LrNK cells6,7
and macrophage8, which display notable differences

compared to those in circulation9
. These liver-resident
immune cells (LrICs) are also affected by tissue microenvironment in which regulatory modules are suspected
to play crucial roles in various liver diseases10. However,
these studies focused on particular cell subsets or limited
numbers of markers using classical flow cytometry, and
comprehensive characterization of immune cellular
compartments and heterogeneity in the human liver has
not been well performed. A reference map of the healthy
human liver immune cell landscape at single-cell resolution is critical to understanding immune pathogenesis and
treatment of liver disease, but has not previously been
established. The recent development of unbiased singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is well
suited to resolve immune cellular complexity and heterogeneity, identify new cell subsets and DEGs and
pathways, and delineate underlying cell lineage relationships11. Although scRNA-seq has been used to dissect the
whole liver in human12,13 and mouse14, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)15, NK cells16, dendritic cells
(DCs)17, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)18, it has not yet
been used to assess the whole scenario of liver immune
cells in healthy donors. Previous studies were also limited
by the total immune cell numbers analyzed, and no
matched blood cells for comparison. Thus, previous studies have not succeeded in depicting a high-resolution
liver immune cell atlas and LrICs could not be faithfully
confirmed. The spleen is the largest immune organ.
Anatomically, spleen vein blood is collected into the liver
via the portal vein. Therefore, paired spleen and blood are
optimal controls for the characterization of LrICs. Here,
we use scRNA-seq to provide the first unbiased and
comprehensive atlas of intrahepatic CD45+ immune cells
in relation to paired spleen and PBMCs from liver
transplant donors. This atlas will serve as a crucial
resource to enable further study on the role of various
immune subsets in the human liver and spleen as well as
various liver diseases.
Results
ScRNA-seq maps distinct immune cell populations in the
human liver
We performed scRNA-seq analysis of CD45+ cells from
three donors with normal histology (Supplementary Fig.
S1) using paired liver perfusion (LP), spleen, and PB
(Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Briefly, live CD45+ immune cells were isolated from fresh
samples by magnetic selection and single-cell transcriptomes were obtained using the 10× Genomics platform (Fig. 1a). The final dataset comprised 70, 706 singlecell transcriptomes merged from triplicate blood, spleen,
and LP samples (Supplementary Table S2). The resulting
single-cell profiles consistently passed stringent highquality filtering (Supplementary Fig. S2), yielding a mean
of 61, 000 reads/cell with median gene and unique
molecular identifier (UMI) counts of 1, 304 and 4, 213,
respectively (Supplementary Table S2).
We applied principal component analysis (PCA) using the
top variable genes ranked by their normalized dispersion as
previously reported15. We then used the first 50 PC loadings as input to Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) for visualization and clustered cells
using a graph-based method. We observed 23 distinct cell
clusters (C) composed of 4 major cell subtypes, including
NK & T, B, myeloid and plasma cells (PC) (Fig. 1b), each
identified by their unique signature genes CD3D (T cell
marker), KLRF1 (NKp80, NK marker), CD19 (B cell marker), SDC1 (CD138, PC marker), CD14 (monocyte marker)
and FCGR3A (CD16), respectively (Fig. 1c). We confirmed
that the data integration removed residual batch effect and
enabled excellent reproducibility across different donors
(Supplementary Fig. S3a). Indeed, every individual cluster
consisted of considerable proportion of cells from each
donor (Supplementary Fig. S3b).
Thus, the unbiased scRNA-seq data allowed comparison of the distribution of cell compartments among LP,
spleen, and blood. It was apparent that higher proportions
of T and NK cells in the LP, B cells in the spleen and
myeloid cells in blood (Fig. 1d, e). This data suggest that
the fine structure of immune cell compartments differs
significantly in these tissues and confirm a faithful recapitulation of the overall immune cell atlas.
We next sought to identify specific signatures for liverderived lymphocytes. We screened for liver-specific genes
in four major immune subsets compared to those from
spleen and blood (Supplementary Fig. S3c). Seven genes
are highly expressed by liver-derived subsets (Supplementary Fig. S3d). Notably, metallothionein (MT, a metalbinding protein regulating zinc and copper homeostasis)
gene expression was significantly higher in the LP than
that in the spleen and blood (Fig. 1f). Among MTs, MT2A
and MT1X were the most highly expressed (Fig. 1g). We
confirmed these findings at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR
(Fig. 1h). We also found that cytotoxic molecules GZMA
and NKG7, chemokine CCL4, and KLRB1 (CD161) and
IER2 were highly expressed in liver-derived lymphocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S3d). These molecules specially
related to liver-derived cell subsets may shape the unique
human liver immune microenvironment.
Identification of LrT and LrNK cells
Although this combined analysis provided an overall
picture of the immune cell atlas, the large data size might
hinder further dissection of the subclusters of each major
immune cell subset in detail. Therefore, we first comprehensively dissected the T and NK cells based on
variably expressed genes. Four of CD4+ T cell, 7 of CD8+
T cell, 2 of NK cell, 1 of ILCs and 1 of proliferative cell

subsets were identified and visualized using UMAP
(Fig. 2a) basing on the typical marker expressions and

cells. C3 and C7 identify the follicular CD4+ (TFH) and

cells. C8–C10 represents the tissue-resident T-cell subset.
C8 identifies mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT)
cells, C9 for CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells,
C10 for γδ T cells, C11 for CD8+ T cell expressing
cytotoxic markers (GZMB+ CD8+ Tc). C12 is the tissueresident NK (TrNK) subset, while C13 is the conventional
NK subset expressing cytotoxic markers (GZMB+ cNK).
C14 identifies ILCs. C15 identifies replicating T and NK
cell subsets. Comparing blood, spleen and liver facilitated
the dissection of tissue distribution patterns by various T
and NK cell subsets (Fig. 2c). We identified that C3 (TFH)
and C7 (TFC) preferentially resided in spleen representing
the follicular CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations,
respectively, while C8 (MAIT), C9 (Trm), C10 (γδ T), and
C12 (TrNK) resided in human liver as the tissue resident
cell populations (Fig. 2c, d).
To search for underlying core signatures shared by Trm
and TrNK cells. We first validated the previously reported
core signatures of CD69+ Trm cells in our dataset19. This
31 core genes composed signatures, combining two gene
sets (upregulated and downregulated genes of CD69+
compared with CD69− memory T cells), was scored for
each single cell and visualized in the UMAP by Single-Cell
Signature Explorer20. We found that this core signature
perfectly matched the MAIT, Trm, γδ T, and TrNK cells
(Fig. 2e). Next, we sought unique gene sets expressed by
Trm and TrNK cells through its comparison with liverderived Tem and GZMB+ CD8+ Tc cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4b, Table S4). In total, 63 genes were highly
expressed in Trm cells including chemokines (XCL2,
CCL3, and CCL4), cell adhesion molecules (ICAM1,
VCAM1, and ITGAD), transcriptional factors (EOMES
and IKZF2) and others. Similarly, unique genes in
MAIT cells included MAIT-specific genes (SLC4A10 and
KLRB1), chemokine receptors (CXCR6, CCR5, and
CCR6), transcriptional factors (IKZF2 and ZBTB16). The
specific genes by TrNK cells were also comparable to
MAIT and CD8+ Trm cells when compared to liver
GZMB+ cNK cells. This comparative analysis revealed the
core genes of TrNK and Trm cells, including KLRB1,
GZMK, CD160, CXCR6, EMOES, etc. (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Table S5). Finally, we validated that one of these
unique surface marker CXCR6 was co-expressed with
CD69 (one classical tissue-resident marker) (Supplementary Fig. S5a) but lacked of CD62L (Supplementary Fig.
S5b, c) by flow cytometry, and further demonstrated that
CXCR6+CD69+ Trm, TrNK, and MAIT cells were enriched in the human liver and spleen as compared to blood
(Fig. 2g).
Characterization of cycling liver-resident T and NK cells
As shown Fig. 2a, C15 was identified as cycling T and
NK cells that expressed replicating markers such as
MKI67 in comparison with non-cycling T and NK cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4a). Among cycling T and NK cells,
seven cycling subclusters could be identified (Fig. 3a)
basing on typical marker expression (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. S6, Table S6). C1–C6 identifies the cycling
Treg cells, MAIT cells, CD8+ Tem cells, GZMB+ CD8+
Tc cells, TrNK and GZMB+ cNK cells, respectively. Cells
in C7 belong to a lymphoid subset with NK cell markers,
such as NCAM1, KLRF1, and early differentiation markers, including CCR7, SELL, IL7R, IL18RAP, and
TNFRSF18 (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. S6).
Tissue-residence patterns of cycling T and NK cell
subsets in blood, spleen, and LP was shown in UMAP plot
(Fig. 3c). Peripheral cycling T and NK cells did not contain TrNK and MAIT cells. By contrast, liver and spleen
cycling T and NK cells contained more TrNK and MAIT
(Fig. 3d). In addition, the proportion of cycling TrNK,
Treg, and MAIT cells within NK, CD4+ T, and CD8+
T cells was higher in the LP compared to blood and spleen
(Fig. 3e). Furthermore, FACS data confirmed that hepatic
CXCR6+CD16− TrNK cells displayed higher levels of ki67
expression than that of CXCR6−CD16+ NK cells, suggesting that LrNK cells were characterized by more
robustly proliferative status in human (Fig. 3f). These
findings highlight the impact of tissue residence on T and
NK cell homeostasis.
To characterize the feature of C7-cycling, we analyzed
its transcriptomic feature using GSEA on the Hallmark
gene sets (Fig. 3g). There is a significant enrichment of
genes from Wnt-beta-Catenin, Myc target, unfolded
protein response, and inflammatory response pathways.
We identified that many genes involved in Wnt-betaCatenin pathways, Myc targets were significantly upregulated in this particular cell cluster (Fig. 3h, i; Supplementary Fig. S7). Together with the expression of NK cell
markers and early differentiation markers, C7 likely
represents a NK lineage or a lymphoid progenitor cell
population21.
A novel classification system for T and NK cells based on
chemokine receptors
Interestingly, we found that several key chemokine
receptors (CCR7, CXCR3, CXCR5, CXCR6, and CX3CR1)
have potentials to effectively identify most of T cell and
NK cell subsets (Fig. 4a). For example, CCR7 is uniquely
expressed by naïve/CM CD4+ (C1) and CD8+ T cells
(C5). CXCR3 is expressed by memory CD4+ (C2) and
CD8+ T cells (C6). CXCR5 is expressed by follicular
CD4+ (C3) and CD8+ T cells (C7). CXCR6 is preferentially expressed by MAIT (C8), CD8+ Trm (C9), γδ
T (C10) and TrNK cells (C12). CX3CR1 is uniquely
expressed by GZMB+ CD8+ Tc (C11) and cNK cells
(C13). The chemokine receptor expression patterns of NK
& T cells correlate with their distinct tissue distribution.
We observed liver- and spleen-derived NK & T cells

Zhao et al. Cell Discovery (2020) 6:22 Page 6 of 19

expressed higher levels of CXCR6, while blood T cells
mainly expressed CCR7 (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. S8).
Importantly, this particular category system for T and NK
cells based on these five chemokine receptors correlate
with the effectorness differentiation scheme of T and NK
cells (Fig. 4b). CCR7 defines the naive/CM state identified
by MYC, LEF1, TSHZ2, MAL, NOSIP, and TCF7 expression. CXCR3/CXCR5 defines a more intermediate differentiation state identified by expressing intermediate
levels of effector molecules. CXCR6 defines the tissue
resident lineages identified by the aforementioned resident core signature molecules, including EOMES, GZMK,
etc., while the CX3CR1 defined the terminal differentiation state with co-expression of many cytotoxic molecules, including FGFBP2, GZMB, GNLY, SPON2, PRF1,
etc.
We further confirmed the chemokine receptor-based
categorization of CD8+ T and NK cells using flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S9a). Through excluding
MAIT cells based on TCR-Vα7.2 and CD161, the
remaining CD8+ T cells contain CCR7+ naïve T (Tnaïve)
cells and CCR7− memory cells, the latter can be further
divided into CXCR6+CX3CR1− Trm, CXCR6−CX3CR1+
Tc and CXCR6−CX3CR1− Tem cells. The pool data also
confirmed that CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells and MAIT cells are
enriched in the LP, while Tnaïve cells and Tem cells are
distributed in the blood (Fig. 4c). Importantly, these four
populations of CD8+ T cells differentially express various
transcriptional factors (TFs) (Supplementary Fig. S9a).
Tnaïve cells lack all four TFs detected, while other
memory T cells express EOMES. Trm preferentially
expresses EMOES, PLZF, and Helios, while CX3CR1+ Tc
cells preferentially expresses T-bet. Similarly, CXCR6+
NK cells which mainly reside in the liver (Fig. 4d) express
high levels of EOMES and PLZF, while CX3CR1+ NK
cells only express T-bet (Supplementary Fig. S9b). Functionally, we found that CXCR6+ LrT cells and
CXCR6+CD16− LrNK cells displayed more capacity to
produce IFN-γ and CD107a in response to IL-12/IL18 stimulation in vitro as compared to those from PB- and
liver-derived CXCR6−CD16+ T & NK cells (Fig. 4e, f;
Supplementary Fig. S9c, d). Histologically, as shown by
data from Protein atlas (Fig. 4g), very few number of
CCR7+ cells (naive/CM T cells) are present in the liver,
and GZMB+ cells (Tc and NK cells) are concentrated in
the portal area, while GZMK+ (Trm and TrNK) cells
scattered evenly in the liver sinusoids and their numbers
are much more than GZMB+ cells. We also found that
HBV-infected livers contained more infiltration of
CXCR6+ LrT and LrNK cells (Fig. 4h), indicated a
potential role of LrNK & LrT cells in the pathogenesis of
HBV-associated liver diseases. Through this comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that CXCR6 marks LrT and
LrNK cells, including MAIT, CXCR6+ CD8+ Trm cells,
γδ T cells and CXCR6+ TrNK cells, while they display
distinct distribution and function in the liver.
scRNA-seq reveals monocyte cell heterogeneity in human
liver
Eight myeloid cell clusters could be identified and
visualized in the UMAP projection (Fig. 5a) basing on
typical marker expression (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Table
S7). C1 identifies classic CD14+ monocytes. C2 identifies
a tissue-derived CD14+ monocyte subset which was
mainly present in the spleen and liver (Fig. 5c). C3 identifies CD16+ monocytes, and C4 identifies macrophages.
C5 identifies megakaryocytes. C6–C8 represents various
DC subsets including cDC1, cDC2, and pDC, respectively.
C9 expresses markers of monocytes, T and B cells, suggesting the presence of mixed multiplets.
Tissue-residence patterns for myeloid cell subsets were
also examined (Fig. 5c). Megakaryocytes were only found
in blood and spleen. Classic CD14+ monocytes, which are
the major myeloid population in blood, were reduced in
spleen and liver. By contrast, the tissue-CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes and macrophages were relatively
enriched in spleen and liver but were notably absent from
blood. DCs represented only a minor cell population, but
their proportion in spleen was elevated compared to
blood and liver (Fig. 5d). These findings highlight the
importance of tissue residence to the distribution of
myeloid cell populations.
Environmental cues can finely tune the TrICs, especially
the myeloid cell populations. Here, we noticed that for
both CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes, the tissue-derived
cells differed with their blood counterpart in the UMAP
(see figure on previous page)

plot (Fig. 5c), indicating underlying transcriptomic differences (Supplementary Table S8). GSEA of the spleen
and liver CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes as compared
with blood CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes showed a significant common downregulation of interferon (IFN)-α
and IFN-γ responses, complement pathway, inflammatory
response and IL2-JAK-STAT5, IL6-JAK-STAT3, and P53
pathway (Fig. 5e, f). These findings probably reflect the
notion that liver is an immune tolerant organ which
would limit the hepatic inflammatory activation.
Finally, through flow cytometry we observed that PB
mainly contains CD14+ classical monocytes while spleen
and LP contain more CD16+ monocytes especially for
MerTK+ and CD206+ (MRC1) monocyte and macrophage, which matched our scRNA-seq data and previous
studies22 (Fig. 5g). Overall, this comprehensive analysis
confirms that distinct CD14+ monocyte, CD16+ monocyte, and macrophages are the primary monocyte subsets
enriched in the healthy liver, where they adapt to the
unique immune tolerant environment.
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of human B cell and
PC subsets
Clustering analysis identified 7 of B-cell clusters visualized using UMAP (Fig. 6a) basing on typical marker
expression (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table S9). C1 was
naïve B-cell subset. C2 identified marginal zone B (MZB)
cells enriched in the spleen. C3 expressed TXNIP, COCH,
and SSPN and identified the classical memory B (cMBC)
cells. C4 expressed ITGAX and identified age-associated B
cells (ABCs)23. C5 identifies germinal center B (GCB)
cells. C6 highly expressing interferon stimulated genes
(ISG) and was named ISG+ B cells. C7 highly expressed
ZBTB32 and was named ZBTB32+ B cells.
Tissue-residence patterns of B-cell subsets were assessed through UMAP comparison (Fig. 6c, d). Spleen clearly
contains the largest number of B cells. Naïve B cells
comprised a large proportion of the B-cell compartment
in all tissues. The MZB subset was absent from blood and
represented a major B-cell subset in spleen. MZB cells
were also present in the LP. The proportion of cMBC was
similar in blood and LP, but reduced in spleen. ABC was a
distinct subset present in blood, spleen, and LP. GCB,
ISG+ B, and ZBTB32+ B cells are rare populations mostly
enriched in spleen and liver, except for small number of
ZBTB32+ B cells in blood (Fig. 6c, d). We also noticed
that both cMBC (C3) and ZBTB32+ B cells (C7) in blood
differed from their tissue counterparts in the UMAP plot
(Fig. 6c), indicating possible transcriptomic differences
(Supplementary Table S9).
There is no agreement on specific markers of human Bcell subsets. To confirm the identification of major B-cell
populations, we extracted gene expression signatures
from previous reports on naive, MZB, cMBC, and
ABC24,25, and examined the selective enrichment of these
signatures in scRNA-seq defined B-cell subsets. Indeed,
the GSEA analysis showed that both upregulated and
downregulated gene sets matches well in naive, MZB,
cMBC, and ABC cells, indicating that our clustering
faithfully revealed the heterogeneity of human B-cell
populations (Fig. 6e).
GSEA of the GCB, ISG+ B, and ZBTB32+ B cells
compared to other B-cell subsets was also conducted to
probe their unique functions (Fig. 6f). GSEA of GCB
showed enrichment for hallmark gene sets, including Myc
targeted pathway and TNF signaling via NFkB, apoptosis
and inflammatory response. Indeed, we confirmed
increased expression of Myc-targeted genes from GCB
cells (Fig. 6g). These genes and pathways are features of
GCB from the light zone26. GSEA of ISG+ B showed
enrichment of IFNα and IFNγ responses (Fig. 6f, g). GSEA
of ZBTB32+ B showed enrichment of pathways, including
mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets (Fig. 6f,
g), indicating a population of proliferative B cells.
Four of PC, the antibody-secreting cell (ASC), clusters
could be identified and visualized in UAMP as follows

(Fig. 7a) basing on typical gene expression (Fig. 7a; Supplementary Fig. S10a, Table S10): C1 was identified as
plasmablasts (PBs) and C2 as PCs. C3 and C4 were PC
clusters with unique transcriptomic features. GSEA of
C3 showed enriched pathway for unfolded protein
response and protein secretion (Fig. 7b, c), indicating an
active antibody producing population, while GSEA of
C4 showed enriched pathway for IFNα response and
inflammatory response, indicating a cytokine-stimulated
population in vivo (Fig. 7b, c). The distributions of ASC
clusters across blood, spleen, and LP were similar with
approximately one-third identified as cycling plasmablasts
(C1), however, the immune activated C4 resided only in
the tissue and not blood (Fig. 7d, e).
We then compared B and ASCs transcriptomes so as to
search key genes determining ASC differentiation. ASCs
are in an active metabolic state reflected by their higher
UMI and gene counts (Supplementary Fig. S10b). Almost
20% in PBs and 50% in PCs of the gene contents are
immunoglobulin genes (Supplementary Fig. S10c), indicating that they are dedicated antibody producers. After
exclusion of immunoglobulin genes, PCA analysis identified four ASC clusters distant from the B cell clusters,
indicating that ASCs hold unique transcriptional signatures in addition to their higher levels of immunoglobulin gene expression (Fig. 7f). BCL11A and PAX5 are
expressed by B cells but lacking in ASCs. By contrast,
PRDM1 and IRF4 are preferentially expressed by ASCs
compared to B cells (Fig. 7g). Further analysis of ASC- and
B cell-associated DEGs identified 190 genes enriched in
ASCs and 55 genes enriched in B cells, consistent with
their unique immune functions (Supplementary Table
S11). The list shows specific markers such as MHC class II
molecules, MS4A1, CD79B for B cells, and TNFRSF17,
CD38, XBP1, etc. for ASCs. The ASC gene signatures
indicated their activities on antibody production, since
many highly expressed genes in ASCs are related to
protein translation, modification and trafficking (Fig. 7h).
Taken together, we gave a global glimpse on B cell and
ASC subsets in various human tissues.
Discussion
Our study provides the first transcriptional atlas of
LrICs and identifies their heterogeneity in healthy donors
using paired spleen and blood as reference tissues, which
enabled an analysis of subset structure and corresponding
specific genes, distribution, and immune functions of
various cell subsets in these organs (Table 1). Compared
to previous studies5,12,13,27, our data extend significantly
the identity and liver residency of human immune cell
subsets. Our findings will be a rich source for evaluation
of transcriptional profiles in various tissue immune cells
and diseases, and provide comparative scRNA data for
future studies.
Our data give novel clues for categorization of both T
and NK cell subsets based on unique expression patterns
of several chemokine receptors. For CD8+ T cells, CCR7
defines Tnaive and Tcm cells, CXCR3 does for circulating
Tem cells, CXCR6 does for MAIT, Trm, and γδ T cells
and CX3CR1 does for GZMB+ Tc cells. This new classification shows several advantages over previous T cell
category basing on CD45RA and CCR728. First, our
categorization fits accurately with the current understanding of immune surveillance because our data covers
PB, secondary lymphoid tissue (spleen), and peripheral
tissue (liver). By contrast, the CD45RA and CCR7 based T
cell categorization was mainly derived from PB and did
not describe organ-derived memory T cells. Second, our T
cell categories partly overcome Tem heterogeneity by
more clear definition of MAIT cells, CXCR3+ Tem cells,
CXCR6+ Trm cells and CX3CR1+ Tc, which share the
CD45RA−CCR7− phenotype based on previous classification29. Third, CXCR6 is likely a better marker to define
Trm than CD69 (and/or CD103) which, as tissue residence marker, is well-known to be an activation marker
and insufficiently defines Trm30. This notion has been
supported by several previous studies31–33. Fourth,
CX3CR1 is proposed as a useful marker to define CD4+
and CD8+ Tc cells in the study because it is co-expressed
with functional cytotoxic granules such as GZMB, GNLY,
PERF, etc. and is recently used to define cytotoxic subsets34. Finally, CXCR6 and CX3CR1 define LrNK and
cNK cells in similar manner, which is consistent with
distinct expression of TFs such as EMOES, PLZF, and
TBX21, and granules such as GZMK and GZMB,
respectively, in agreement with early reports characterizing LrNK cells6
. Thus, we identify CXCR6 as liverresident marker for both T and NK cells, and characterize

human liver-resident NK & T cells at the single cell level
for the first time. We also dissect their immune functions
through addressing the core hallmark genes expressed by
liver-resident T & NK cells, including adhesion and
integrin markers, chemokine and their receptors, coinhibitory markers, killer lectin-like receptors, and transcriptional factors EOMES, ZBTB16, IKZF2, and RORC.
These CXCR6+ T and NK cells also show a self-renewal
proliferative capacity, and play key roles in local immune
and inflammatory response as well as chemotaxis mediation. Overall, the present category of T and NK cells
based on chemokine receptors unifies the liver-resident T
and NK cell biology.
Three functionally distinct monocyte subsets have been
characterized in human PB, including classical
CD14highCD16− monocytes, CD14highCD16+ intermediate monocytes, and CD14lowCD16+ nonclassical
monocytes35. Our data revealed the CD14+ classical
monocyte, tissue-CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocyte
subsets and macrophage in human liver and spleen, and
provided a map of the baseline hepatic monocyte framework. Different from CD14+ classical monocytes which
are the major component in PB, the proportion of tissueCD14+ monocytes and CD16+ monocytes is much
greater in the liver and spleen than in blood. Notably, our
monocyte categorization is not identical to previous
monocyte subsets in human blood17 and proinflammatory macrophages observed in mouse and
human liver8,12. In addition, our results revealed several
downregulated pathways specifically associated with liverderived monocytesas compared to PB CD14+ and CD16+
monocytes such as inflammatory response and IFN-α and
IFN-γ responses. These findings likely reflect the notion
that liver is an immunotolerant organ which limit the
hepatic inflammatory activation. The validation of these
pathways greatly contributes to better resolution of
hepatic monocytes and macrophages. Taken together, our
data characterized the differences and relations between
hepatic monocytes and macrophages, and could be used
as reference data for future comparison studies on their
physiological and pathological significances.
Our analysis also revealed the heightened expression of
MTs and chemokines in liver-derived immune cell subsets. MTs have emerged as an important, yet largely
underappreciated component of the immune system to
regulate the activation, proliferation and differentiation
potential of immune cells through regulating the homeostasis of zinc and copper36. Exposure of MTs impacts the
ability of CD8+ T cells to proliferate and mount cytotoxic
responses against allogeneic target cells37. Combination
with these studies, our data highlight several aspects: (1)
MTs enrichment in hepatic immune cells is possibly due
to the Zn-rich environment in the liver; (2) higher
expression of MTs in hepatic immune cells may modulate
hepatic immune defenses and tolerance; and (3) MTs may
be required to sequester Zn in the liver in case of infection. Addressing these questions will be helpful for
understanding the functional roles of MTs in immunological fitness of human liver.
Finally, we produced the first scRNA atlas of large
numbers of human B cells and ASCs and confirmed the
existence of previously reported naive B, cMBC, CD11c+
ABC, and MZB subset and PB and PC, and identified
three additional B-cell subsets including GCB cells,
cycling ZBTB32+ memory B cells and ISG+ B cells as well
as two populations of previously unidentified PCs. This
comprehensive dataset of human B cells and ASCs
enables the comparison of subset transcriptomes and
identify novel subset specific genes which enable better
discerning the B cell and ASC subsets. These newly
identified signature genes would not only be helpful for
future characterization of B-cell subsets, but also provide
insights for their functions. This study, therefore, gives a
global glimpse on B cells in human tissues, supplementing
the previous data on mice B cells and ASCs38.
This study is limited by several aspects. First, although
LP from transplanted livers contains available liverresident or enriched cells39,40, it may not exactly reflect
hepatic immune cells, which possibly causes the difference of cell identity including macrophages. Second,
many genes were found to be uniquely expressed in various cell subsets, but their functions remained unclear.
Third, more comprehensive bioinformatics analysis is
required to reveal more tissue specific immune characteristics. Nonetheless, our transcriptional atlas of LrICs
at the single-cell level provides a framework for understanding the basis of liver immune responses and serves as
a powerful resource for the development of immune cell-

based diagnostics and therapeutic methods especially for
liver diseases. The use of paired LP, spleen and blood adds
additional dimensions supporting the determination of
novel immune subsets and markers, comparison of
potential inter- and intra-organ immune functional variations, identification of differentiation pathways, and
other uses.
Materials and methods
Human tissue cell isolation
For the scRNA-seq characterization, human tissue
samples including LP, spleen, and PB used in this study
were obtained from three adult donors with liver transplantation with approval from the Institutional Review
Board and the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third
People’s Hospital, Guangdong province and Beijing 302
Hospital, Beijing, China. The written informed consent
was obtained from each donor.
Immune cells from human samples were isolated
according to previous protocols41. Complete RPMI media
were used for all cell isolations. In brief, PBMCs (n= 26)
were isolated byficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation from heparinized blood of enrolled subjects.
Spleen (n= 15) wasfirst ground on ice and the cells were
collected andfiltered. LP was directlyfiltered and concentrated by centrifugation (750g, 15 min, 20 °C), and then
layered onto Ficoll.
In scRNA-seq assay, human CD45
+ cells from LP,
spleen cells, and PBMCs were isolated with the anti-CD45
magnetic-activated cell sorting kit, and cells were counted
three times by three individuals independently and a
mean of 22, 000-24, 000 live cells werefinally used for 10×
Genomics. The remaining cells were cryopreserved in
90% fetal calf serum (FCS) plus 10% DMSO for use in
subsequent assays. For additional validation assays, liver
biopsies were also collected from 12 chronic hepatitis B
(CHB) and 10 HBV-associated liver cirrhosis (LC)
patients, and 8 healthy liver tissue samples were obtained
from donors whose livers were used for transplantation.
In addition to the tissues used for pathological evaluation,
these liver biopsy specimens were homogenized for the
validation assay of T cells, NK cells, and monocytes using flow cytometry41.
RNA-Seq library construction using the 10× genomics
platform
The scRNA-Seq libraries were prepared with Single Cell
3′ Reagent Kit v2 (10× Genomics; 120,237, 120,236, and
120,262) following the user guide provided. Briefly, 22,
000 cells were encapsulated into droplets at a concentration of 2, 000 cells/μl. After the encapsulated cells
were lysed and reverse transcripts (53 °C for 45 min; 85 °C
for 5 min) were performed in a 96-Well Thermal cycler

and barcoded-cDNA was purified with DynaBeads
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; 37002D), followed by 14-cycles
of PCR-amplification (98 °C for 3 min; [98 °C for 15 s,
67 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 1 min] × 14 cycles; 72 °C for
1 min). The amplified-cDNA was then fragmented, ligated
with adapter and sample index, and selected with SPRI
beads (Beckman Coulter; B23318) to average 300 bp size.
The constructed library was sequenced on Illumina Hiseq
XTEN platform.
Alignment, UMI counting, and sample aggregating
The Cell Ranger Software Suite (Version 3.0.2) was used
to perform sample de-multiplexing, barcode processing,
and single-cell 3′ UMI counting with human GRCh38 as
the reference genome. Specifically, splicing-aware aligner
STAR42 was used in FASTQs alignment. Cell barcodes
were then determined based on distribution of UMI count
automatically. Finally, gene-barcode matrix of all three
donors was integrated with Seurat v343 to remove batch
effect across different tissue and donor. Following criteria
were then applied to each cell, i.e., gene number between
200 and 6000, UMI count above 1000 and mitochondrial
gene percentage below 0.1. After filtering, a total of
77, 099 cells (475/8267/5646 cells for blood/spleen/LP of
donor 1; 7562/9609/11,488 cells for blood/spleen/LP of
donor 2; 9239/13,958/10,855 cells for blood/spleen/LP of
donor 3) were left for following analysis. In the following
analysis, a total of 6393 cells were further excluded due to
doublets, the remaining 70,706 cells were finally entered
into the analysis of clusters.
Dimensionality reduction and clustering
The filtered gene-barcode matrix was analyzed by PCA.
Then Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP) was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the cells. Meanwhile, graph-based
clustering was performed on the PCA-reduced data for
clustering analysis with Seurat v3. For different cell types,
cells were grouped based on known markers and analyzed
with Seurat v3 in the similar manner.
Differential analysis for clusters
MAST44 in Seurat v3 was used to perform differential
analysis. For each cluster, DEGs were generated relative to
all of the other cells.
Identification of cluster-specific genes and marker-based
classification
To identify genes that are enriched in a specific cluster,
the mean expression of each gene was calculated across all
cells in the cluster. Then each gene from the cluster was
compared to the mean expression of the same gene from
cells in all other clusters. Genes were ranked based on
their expression difference, and the top DEGs from each
cluster were examined. For hierarchical clustering, pairwise correlation between each cluster was calculated, and
centered expression of each gene was used for visualization by heatmap. Classification of immune cell subsets
was inferred from the annotation of cluster-specific genes.
The identification markers for each subset are summarized in Supplementary Tables S3–S9.
Gene functional annotation
For DEGs, Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway analyses, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)45 were
performed with clusterProfiler46, which supports statistical analysis and visualization of functional profiles for
genes and gene clusters. In GSEA analysis, 50 hallmark
gene sets in MSigDB47 were used for annotation. To verify
the validity of clustering result for B cells, GSEA was used
to discover the correlation of marginal zone B (MZB)
cells, classical memory B cells (cMBC), Naïve B and
CD11c+ ABCs with signatures of these cell types calculated from published dataset (GSE64028 for MZB, Naïve
and classical memory B cells, GSE110999 for CD11c+
ABC cells), respectively24,25.
Single-cell signatures
Tissue-resident NK & T core signatures score was calculated for all NK & T cells and visualized with SingleCell Signature Explorer20. Since Single-Cell Signature
Scorer only consider positive marker for signature calculation, we referred to the method48 which consider both
upregulated and downregulated markers.
Real-time PCR
Lymphocytes total RNA was extracted with TRIzol
reagents (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and further reverse-transcribed
into cDNA with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara). The expression levels of MT2A
were determined by qPCR analysis using Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Takara). The real-time PCR
primers set for MT2A detection were as follows: forward
(5′-GAGTGCAAATGCACTTCGTGCAA-3′) and reverse
(5′-GCGTTCTTTACATCTGGGAGCG-3′), and the data
was normalized to actin RNA (5′-CACCATTGGCAATG
AGCGGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGGTCTTTGCGGATGTCCAC
GT-3′).
Flow cytometry
The fluorochrome conjugated antibodies or regents from
Biolegend, BD Bioscience, eBioscience and R&D Systems
were used in the study. For human PBMCs and various
tissue derived lymphocytes, dead cells were excluded using
fixable viability dye eFluor 450 (eBioscience). The left live
CD45+ cells were analyzed for phenotypic expression by BD
LSRFortessa, and the data were further analyzed with
Zhao et al. Cell Discovery (2020) 6:22 Page 17 of 19

FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA). For surface
marker staining, the cells were incubated with antibodies on
ice for 30 min and then washed and fixed with further
analysis. For the staining of transcriptional factors, the cells
were stained with surface marker first and then permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience) and
stained for intracellular protein. For intracellular cytokine
detection, freshly isolated cells were incubated with various
stimulators followed by Golgi-stop for additional 6 h. The
cells were then collected for surface marker staining, followed by cell permeabilization and intracellular cytokine
staining. For CD107a staining, the cells were incubated with
anti-CD107a antibodies since the onset of stimulation.
Then the cells were further incubated with BFA for additional 6 h.
Cell culture and stimulation
Human lymphocytes (1 × 106) were plated in 96-well
plates and were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium
containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin
(Invitrogen), and recombinant human 10 ng/ml IL-2
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). For T and NK cell stimulation, IL-12/IL-18 (50 ng/ml; PeproTech) was supplemented into the medium for 6 h, followed by intermediate
FACS analysis to detect cell activation. For measuring the
cytokine secretion, the cultured cells were collected and
analyzed by FACS after addition of Golgi stop solution
(BD Bioscience) for at least 6 h.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software
version 5.0 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Data represent mean ± SEM. Results were considered
significant when P < 0.05. Multiple comparisons were first
made among the three groups using the Kruskal–Wallis H
nonparametric test. Then the comparisons between two
groups were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test.
The comparisons in the same individual were performed
with Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs test.
