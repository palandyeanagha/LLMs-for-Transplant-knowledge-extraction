Abstract
Background: In major abdominal surgery albumin is shifted from the circulation, presumably leaking into the
interstitial space, contributing to a 30–40% decrease in plasma albumin concentration. During and after liver
transplantation exogenous albumin is infused for volume substitution and to maintain plasma albumin
concentration. Here we used liver transplantation as a model procedure for the study of albumin mass balance and
kinetics during major abdominal surgery with albumin substitution.
Methods: Patients were studied during liver transplantation (n = 16), and until postoperative day 3 (POD 3) (n = 11).
Cumulative perioperative albumin shift was assessed by mass balance of albumin and hemoglobin. Synthesis rates
of albumin and fibrinogen were estimated by the flooding technique using deuterium-labeled phenylalanine.
Albumin distribution was assessed by radioiodinated human serum albumin.
Results: At the end of surgery, 37 ± 17 g of albumin (p < 0.0001) had shifted from plasma, and this amount was stable
until POD 3 (48 ± 33 g, p = 0.0017 versus baseline). There was 91 ± 37 g exogenous albumin infused peroperatively and
another 47 ± 35 g was infused postoperatively until POD 3. Absolute synthesis rates of albumin and fibrinogen on POD
3 were 239 ± 84 mg/kg body weight/day and 33 mg/kg body weight/day (range 5–161), respectively.
Conclusions: Albumin net leakage from plasma progressed until the end of surgery, and was then unaltered until POD
3. This is in contrast with the normalization of the cumulative albumin shift identified at day 3 after non-transplant
major abdominal surgery. Liver synthesis of export proteins was high compared to reference values at the third
postoperative day, suggesting rapid recovery of synthesis capacity.

Background
Intravenous administration of albumin has been used for
more than 60 years in different states of circulatory instability. The strong association between body weight gain due to
fluid retention and poor outcome following surgery [1] and
in critical illness [2, 3] encouraged the use of colloids, such
as albumin, with the goal of decreasing the amount of fluids
that need to be intravenously administered to obtain
circulatory stability. This volume-saving effect has been repeatedly demonstrated in volunteers [4], but is less extensive
during surgery, with a ratio between colloids and crystalloids
of 1:1.8 [5], and in the critically ill a ratio of 1:1.4 [6]. Although positive short-term effects on circulatory stability
are evident [7], long-term effects with a possibility of adverse
outcomes are poorly understood and sparsely investigated.
Low plasma albumin concentration (P-alb) is often seen
after major abdominal surgery [8, 9]. P-alb below 25 g/L
on postoperative day 1 (POD 1) after pancreaticoduodenectomy predicts any serious complication (Clavien grade
III–V [10]) [11]. Likewise, a decrease in P-alb ≥ 10 g/L on
POD 1 is associated with threefold increased risk of any
postoperative complication [8]. The time course of the
perioperative decrease in P-alb is well-characterized and

occurs mainly during the first hours of surgery [12, 13].
The capillary leakage in the perioperative setting can be
studied by the transcapillary escape rate (TER) of radioiodinated human serum albumin [14]. The mechanism of
impaired capillary patency is unclear, but inflammation
and fluid overload are possible contributors [15]. By keeping rigorous track of infusions of exogenous albumin and
losses of albumin by bleeding and in drains, we have
adapted a method of mass balance. Using this approach,
we demonstrated a cumulative perioperative albumin shift
from plasma of 24 ± 17 g, presumably to the interstitial
space, 1 h after the end of major abdominal surgery [13].
However, whether this loss can be affected by intravenous
administration of exogenous albumin is not known.
Liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure in endstage liver disease. In our institution, fluid treatment during this surgical procedure has decreased over time and is
now standardized to 5 ml/kg body weight/hour, although
extra fluids can be administered at the discretion of the
attending anesthesiologist as guided by circulatory monitoring. Concomitantly, bleeding and exogenous blood
transfusions have decreased. Still, exogenous albumin is
given during and after liver transplantation for volume
substitution and with the intention of maintaining P-alb
above 25 g/L. This level is suggested to facilitate the interpretation of immune-suppressive drug concentrations.
The fate of albumin beyond the initial volume effect is,
however, poorly understood. The graft recovery after liver
transplantation is monitored by blood chemical analysis,
but the recovery of liver function in terms of the synthesis
rates of albumin and fibrinogen, two major plasma proteins synthesized in and exported from the liver, has not
been investigated previously.
The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the cumulative perioperative albumin shift at the
end of surgery for liver transplantation, and on the POD
3, respectively, when a generous amount of exogenous
albumin is supplied. The secondary aim was to quantify
the synthesis rates of two liver export proteins, albumin
and fibrinogen, on POD 3 after liver transplantation.
Methods
This prospective exploratory study of patients during and
after liver transplantation was performed at the Karolinska
University Hospital Huddinge between October 2015 and
October 2016 in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice.
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical
Board in Stockholm (2015/1048-31/2) and by the Swedish
Medical Product Agency (EudraCT 2015-002568-18). The
study was monitored by the Karolinska Trial Alliance. All
patients gave written informed consent after being informed orally and in writing about the investigational procedure and the possible risks involved.
Patients
During the study period, liver transplantation was performed on 79 occasions, and 16 subjects (6 female) aged
53 ± 7 years, body weight 82 ± 24 kg, body mass index 26.8
± 7.0 kg/m2
, were recruited to the study (Fig. 1). All
subjects were evaluable until the first primary end point at
the end of surgery (EOS), and finally 11 subjects received
the isotopic intervention on POD 3. In one patient the TER
measurement failed to reach the pre-set acceptable quality
(a regression coefficient exceeding 0.85), but this patient
was included in all other analyses. Patients younger than
40 years and pregnant women were excluded from the
study based on the recommendation by the World Health
Organization (WHO), that the risk of potassium iodine
treatment after nuclear accidents exceeds the benefit if the
radiation dose is low in patients ages 40 and higher [16].
Pregnancy tests were performed in women < 55 years old.
Patients who had participated in other studies involving radiation or the use of stable isotopes within 30 days were excluded, as were patients undergoing re-transplantation,
graft size reduction, bleeding more than 5000 ml, or continuous renal replacement therapy.

The patients had a model for end-stage liver disease
(MELD) score of 14 ± 5 [17], and according to the
Child-Pugh classification for cirrhosis mortality there
were three patients in group A, nine in group B, and
four in group C [18]. The main indication for liver transplantation was hepatocellular carcinoma in six patients,
primary biliary cirrhosis in three patients, alcoholic cirrhosis in three patients, Morbus Osler disease in one patient, autoimmune hepatitis in one patient, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in one patient, and cryptogen
cirrhosis in one patient. The following comorbidities
were noted: ulcerative colitis (n = 3), Crohn’s disease
(n = 2), hepatitis C (n = 2), diabetes mellitus (n = 2),
obesity (n = 2), renal insufficiency (n = 2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 2), asthma (n = 1),
peribronchial fibrosis (n = 1), hypertension (n = 1), and
hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 1).
Study procedure
All liver transplantations were performed using liver
grafts from brain-dead donors. All patients had an arterial line and central venous catheters, and circulation was
further monitored by pulmonary artery catheter (Vigilance II monitor, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA)
and/or trans-esophageal echocardiography for guidance
of fluid therapy and use of vasopressor. An autologous
blood recovery system (Cell Saver® 5+, Haemonetics
Corp, Braintree, MA, USA) was used in all patients
without hepatocellular carcinoma. General anesthesia
was maintained by sevoflurane in oxygenated air at a
minimal alveolar concentration of 0.8–1.0, complemented with fentanyl. Intravenous fluids were administered
according to the unit routines i.e. albumin 50 mg/ml at
2 ml/kg body weight/h (Baxter Medical AB, Kista,
Sweden), acetated Ringer’s solution 2 ml/kg body
weight/h and buffered glucose 25 mg/ml at 1 ml/kg
body weight/h. Extra fluids were administered at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Most patients
had a norepinephrine infusion to keep mean arterial
blood pressure above 60 mmHg.
Blood sampling for mass balance analysis commenced
in the operating room as soon as there was an arterial line,
and blood was then sampled at approximately hourly intervals during surgery i.e. at the same time intervals as
routine blood gases. Samples were also taken from all administered blood products including salvaged blood, and
from heparinized suction bottles, for determination of albumin and hemoglobin. After the end of surgery similar
samples were taken from blood, from drains and from
blood products given intravenously, two to three times
per day until POD 3. The amounts of fluid were weighed.
Samples were taken in tubes with sodium heparin, spun at
room temperature at 2000 g, and plasma was then stored
at − 18 °C until nephelometry analysis at Studiecenter
Karolinska University Hospital. The details and applied
equations for the mass balance calculations have been
published before [13]. Briefly, mass balance analysis compares the dilution of hemoglobin with that of albumin,
whilst keeping track of all measured gains and losses of
the two compounds. If albumin is diluted more than
hemoglobin, this suggests that albumin has been shifted
from plasma, presumably to the interstitial space. The
measured plasma volume at POD 3 was used for adjustment of baseline plasma volume in the 11 patients that
had such a measurement, otherwise anthropometric
plasma volume was calculated and used as the baseline in
the calculations [19]. Ascites was measured separately in
the assessment of perioperative fluid balance and body
weight changes, and was not included in the mass balance
analysis. Differences in the weight of native and donor
livers were also analyzed in changes of body weight.
Perspiration was assumed to be 3 ml/kg body weight/h or
0.5 ml/kg body weight/h during surgery and postoperatively, respectively. Differences between estimated bleeding during surgery and the weighing of sponges and
suction bottles were treated as perspiration in the fluid
balance calculations.
On POD 3 albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates were
measured in the semi-recumbent position. Nutrition was
limited to glucose 50 mg/ml at 80 ml/h during 4 h prior to
the investigation. Synthesis rates were measured by the
flooding dose technique, previously explained in detail
[12, 20, 21], using a 10 min infusion of L-2
H5 phenylalanine
20 mg/ml, 10 mol percent excess, at a dose of 0.45 g/kg.
Thereafter blood was sampled at 0, 5, 15, 30, 50, 60, 70,
and 90 min after the start of the infusion for determination
of the mol percent excess of L-2
H5 phenylalanine to
phenylalanine as an index of the precursor pool. After
separation of albumin from the other plasma proteins, the
synthesis rate was calculated from the rate of incorporation
of L-2
H5 phenylalanine into albumin in the samples taken
at 50, 60, 70, and 90 min. Analysis was performed on a
quadrupole gas chromatography mass spectrometer
(Agilent, Kista, Sweden). The fractional synthesis rate (FSR)
, i.e. the fraction of the intravascular pool that is
synthesized every day, was calculated as previously
described [12], and the absolute synthesis rate (ASR) was
calculated as the product of FSR and the total plasma pool
of albumin obtained from plasma volume and P-alb. The
principle of determination of fibrinogen FSR and ASR was
similar to that of albumin, although blood samples were
taken in citrate tubes, but the process of separation of fibrinogen from other plasma proteins was different from
that of albumin [22].
Measurement of TER and plasma volume was performed using radiolabeled albumin (SERALB-125, CIS
bio international, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France). A dose
of 200 kBq was injected intravenously 20 min after the
Amouzandeh et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:152 Page 3 of 10

start of the stable isotope procedure described above,
followed by blood sampling on nine occasions during
70 min. The radioactivity was measured by scintillation
counting (Wallac Compu-gamma CS 1282, energy window 20-82 keV) at the Department of Nuclear Medicine
at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge. TER was
derived from the slope of the logarithm of counts per
minute versus time plot. Plasma volume was calculated
from the radioactive dose administered divided by the
calculated activity in plasma at time of the injection, obtained from back extrapolation of the slope used for the
TER assessment [9].
Statistics
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (range) as appropriate according to the ShapiroWilk normality test. When comparing two time points,
the dependent t test was used. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the three main time points
(baseline, EOS, and POD 3) was performed (n = 11)
using the Geissner-Greenhouse correction i.e. not assuming sphericity, and Tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparisons test comparing every mean to every other mean
for parameters where normality could not be excluded
according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. Otherwise, Friedman’s non-parametric ANOVA with Dunn’s post-hoc
test was used. Correlation is presented as Pearson’s coefficient of correlation or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient as appropriate. The 95% confidence intervals of
the means are given for the most important outcome
parameters.
A study population of 10 was chosen to achieve 80%
power to detect a within-subject albumin shift from
plasma at the end of surgery with an effect size of 1.0
using the two-sided t test and a significance level of 5%.
In the absence of published data on patients undergoing
liver transplantation, we looked at our previous study in
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery where the
albumin shift was 24 ± 17 g, corresponding to an effect
size of 1.4 [13]. GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis and PASS 2008 (NCSS LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA)
was used for power analysis.
Results
Albumin mass balance
P-alb (n = 11) was 31.2 ± 7.7 g/L before surgery, 30.3 ± 4.3
at EOS, and 26.2 ± 4.0 at POD 3 (Fig. 2a); this corresponded to a total decrease of 12 ± 21%, which was not
statistically significant. During surgery the total exogenous
albumin administration was 91 ± 37 g including that in
salvaged blood and other blood products, and the loss of
albumin in bleeding amounted to 42 ± 36 g. Postoperatively exogenous albumin administration was 47 ± 35 g,
and the measured loss in drains was 25 ± 23 g between
EOS and POD 3 (Table 1). Blood hemoglobin was 113
(79; 162) before surgery and 89 (73; 99) at POD 3, corresponding to a decrease by 22 ± 16% (Fig. 2b).
The cumulative perioperative albumin shift, the
primary end point of the study, was 37 ± 17 g at EOS
(p < 0.0001, ANOVA; 95% confidence interval of the
mean net leakage 23–58 g), and 48 ± 33 g on POD 3 (95%
confidence interval versus baseline 21–75 g, p = 0.0017
and versus EOS − 14 to 35 g, p = 0.49). However, the time
course differed between the individual patients (Fig. 2c).
Plasma volume increased over time, also in the postoperative period (Fig. 2d). There was no statistically significant
correlation between the cumulative perioperative albumin
shift at EOS and peroperative albumin administration
(p = 0.098, n = 11). Data for the whole group of 16 patients
that had complete data until the EOS were overall very
similar to the subgroup of 11 patients (Fig. 2a-d and
Table 1), with the primary outcome cumulative correlation
between the cumulative perioperative albumin shift and
peroperative albumin administration at the EOS in 16
patients (r
2 = 0.34, p = 0.018).
Surgery and fluid balance
The duration of surgery was 5.5 ± 1.5 h and the length of
the procedure was statistically correlated with the cumulative perioperative albumin shift (p = 0.019), albumin loss
(p = 0.031), and the amount of albumin administered
(p = 0.013). Surgical bleeding amounted to 1.87 ± 1.46 L.
The donor liver had a weight of 1.89 ± 0.62 kg, similar to
the 1.87 ± 0.64 kg of the recipient’s original liver, with a
difference of 0.02 ± 0.63 kg. Liver donors were aged 64 ±
14 years, had body mass index of 26.6 ± 4.2 kg/m2
, cold
ischemic time was 7.8 ± 1.4 h, and liver perfusion after
vessel implantation was 0.28 ± 0.14 L/min in the hepatic
artery and 1.78 ± 0.76 L/min in the portal vein. Fluid
balance was positive at the EOS (Table 1), but variable
after that time point. The cumulative changes in fluid
balance and body weight are presented in Table 2. Data on
blood chemical analysis from the hospital laboratory are
presented in Table 3. Four patients had between 2 L and
3 L of ascites removed at the start of laparotomy. Among
the remaining patients, only three had “no ascites”.
When comparing estimated bleeding to the weighing of
suction bottles and sponges, there was a discrepancy of
0.71 ± 0.57 kg, classified as perspiration in the fluid
balance calculation.
Albumin synthesis and distribution
The synthesis measurements on POD 3 started at 62 ± 7 h
after the EOS, most often early in the morning due to logistic feasibility. Albumin kinetic parameters are summarized
in Table 4. The albumin fractional synthesis rate was 17.2 ±
6.9% per day and the corresponding albumin absolute

synthesis rate was 239 ± 34 mg/kg body weight/day.
The fibrinogen fractional synthesis rate on POD 3
was 36.5% (17.9–82.9) per day and the corresponding absolute synthesis rate was 33 (5; 161) mg/kg
body weight/day (Fig. 3a b and). Albumin and
fibrinogen absolute synthesis rates were positively
correlated (Fig. 3c).
Plasma volume estimated by dilution of 125I-HSA was
4.81 ± 1.02 l (n = 11) corresponding to 55 ± 13 mL/kg
body weight. This is 14% more than by anthropometry
according to Nadler [19] (4.22 ± 0.73 L). The mean
standard deviation of plasma volume (n = 11) by back
extrapolation of a single measurement was 27 ± 9 ml,
corresponding to a coefficient of variation of less than
1% and a mean 95% confidence interval of 109 ± 35 ml.
TER was 5.6 ± 2.0%/h (n = 10) with a coefficient of
variation of 13%. Intravascular albumin mass, derived by
multiplying P-alb by plasma volume, was 128 ± 39 g,
whereas the albumin absolute escape rate from plasma
was 6.9 ± 2.7 g/h.
In an exploratory analysis TER correlated with both
albumin ASR (p = 0.003, r
2 = 0.68) and C-reactive
protein (p = 0.010, r
2 = 0.58) but not with white blood
cell count (WBC) count or the cumulative
perioperative albumin shift on POD 3. The albumin
ASR correlated with plasma C-reactive protein (p = 0.039,
r
2 = 0.39) but not with WBC on POD 3 (Fig. 4). Also
the fibrinogen ASR correlated with C-reactive protein
(p = 0.016, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.72).
In a post-hoc analysis the albumin ASR and fibrinogen
ASR were correlated with other laboratory indices of
liver function such as plasma prothrombin time, bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The strongest Spearman rank
correlation was between the fibrinogen ASR and prothrombin time (rS = − 0.424, p = 0.192), whereas the
p value was ≥ 0.5 in all other tests for correlation.

Discussion
We have taken advantage of the local routine for patients that undergo liver transplantation to study the fate
of infused exogenous albumin in conjunction with major
abdominal surgery. Albumin was shifted from blood,
presumably to the interstitial space, at 37 ± 17 g at the
end of surgery. By postoperative day 3 a total of 48 ±
33 g albumin was lost from plasma. The institutional

reached a total of 138 ± 55 g, which is of the same magnitude as the measured total intravascular albumin mass.
Although the cumulative perioperative albumin shift was
somewhat larger than the 24 ± 17 g reported after the
end of surgical procedures without albumin supply [13],
it is not clear if, or to what degree, the exogenous albumin contributed to this difference in albumin shift. Fluid
overload has been suggested to cause capillary leakage,
and measured plasma volume at POD 3 was high. Thus,
a generous albumin supply might contribute to the loss
of albumin from the circulation by its plasma-expanding
property. In contrast, albumin has also been suggested
to stabilize the endothelial glycocalyx [15], and to block
heparin binding protein, which is suggested to be an important factor in endothelial patency [23]. There was no
significant correlation between the given amount of exogenous albumin and the cumulative perioperative albumin shift in 11 patients but there was significant
correlation in 16 patients. However, r
2 = 0.34 in the test
for correlation suggests the presence of other more
important mechanisms. Furthermore, the length of
surgery correlated with both the amount of exogenous
albumin and the cumulative perioperative albumin shift,
and is possibly related to inflammation that is another
proposed mechanism of capillary leakage [14, 15].
During surgery, the magnitude of systemic inflammation
is increased by manipulation of the small intestine [24]
and by ischemia-reperfusion injury in the donor liver
[25], which might both be associated with surgery time.
The body weight gain of 2.4 and 4.7 kg at the EOS and
POD 3, respectively, suggests an increased extravascular
space containing albumin at a concentration of 10–15 g/
L, which is similar to the interstitial albumin concentration in volunteers [26]. The prevailing increase in albumin shifted from the circulation on POD 3 differs from
what is seen in patients undergoing major abdominal
surgery without albumin infusion, where the cumulative
perioperative albumin shift decreased on POD 3 [13].
Although we aimed at a homogenous population undergoing standard liver transplantation without complications, the variability was considerable among these
patients selected for the study. Two subjects had a body
mass index under 18 kg/m2 and six had body mass

index higher than 30 kg/m2
, bleeding varied from 100 to
5000 ml, and surgery time from 3.1 to 8 h. However, it is
also worth noting that the five patients excluded from
the postoperative part of the study protocol due to
predefined exclusion criteria, did not differ at all at the EOS
compared to the 11 patients with full data on the
cumulative perioperative albumin shift, P-alb, blood
hemoglobin (B-Hb), or plasma volume. In the future, it will
be of interest also to explore the outliers after liver transplantation, because postoperative albumin administration is
likely to be much higher in some of these patients.
The use of continuous exogenous albumin infusion
during liver transplantation is part of a restrictive fluid
volume protocol at our institution. Still, fluid shifts are
large and crystalloid supply generous enough to cause a
significantly positive fluid balance and a weight gain at
POD3. Plasma is only given in connection with major
bleeding [27], because prophylactic administration of
plasma can disturb the rebalance of hemostasis associated with liver failure [28], and all blood products are associated with patient morbidity and impaired graft
survival [29]. Compared to our previous study in major
abdominal surgery without routine exogenous albumin
supply [13], P-alb decreased less during the surgical procedure in our study cohort, but we still lack evidence of
any long-term beneficial effects of maintaining P-alb.
The high plasma volume compensated for the low P-alb,
resulting in a rather normal intravascular albumin mass
on POD 3. P-alb thus remains as a weak index of the albumin turnover situation, and a low value can either be
the result of increased losses, decreased synthesis, or an
increased volume of distribution, both within and outside the vascular space. We speculate that the transient
increase in plasma volume in Fig. 2d between POD 1
and POD 2 is associated with occult bleeding. However,
this does not affect the cumulative perioperative albumin
shift more than marginally, as simulated in the supplement to our previous publication [13].
On POD 3 albumin de novo synthesis was high in
both fractional and absolute rates in the livertransplanted patients. Healthy volunteers have albumin
FSR between 7 and 14%/day and ASR between 142 and
239 mg/kg/d [30], and using the same flooding dose
technique our research group identified albumin FSR of
14 ± 3%/day and ASR of 177 ± 34 mg/kg body weight/
day after a light standardized meal [22]. Also albumin
ASR of 184 ± 72 is reported in critically ill patients with
multi-organ failure [31]. The strong correlation between
the synthesis rates of albumin and fibrinogen in the individual subjects also suggests this to be a general feature
of liver function, not influenced by the large exogenous
supply of albumin or the absence of exogenous fibrinogen. It also demonstrates quick recovery of liver-export
protein synthesis. The rapid growth of liver tissue after
liver resection [32] parallels the quick recovery of synthesis capacity in the insulted donor liver, an interpretation that is supported by our findings. In this limited
number of patients, albumin ASR and fibrinogen ASR
did not correlate with laboratory indices of liver function. Thus, we speculate that capacity for synthesis of
liver proteins might serve as a new independent index of
liver function after orthotopic liver transplantation.
Alterations in the rates of synthesis and degradation of
albumin are not considered in the albumin mass balance
calculations. If the synthesis rate during the first few
days after surgery is less than the degradation rate, this
would cause underestimation of the cumulative perioperative albumin shift by POD 3. In our patients albumin ASR was 20 ± 6 g/day on POD 3, which is high
compared to the albumin ASR of 11 ± 4 g on POD 2
after major abdominal surgery [9]. Here the albumin
ASR before POD 3 in the liver-transplanted patients and
the albumin degradation rate was unknown. However,
strong correlation between albumin synthesis and degradation rates is proposed in liver insufficiency [30]. In
conclusion, our finding of persistent high cumulative
perioperative albumin shift after liver transplantation
with generous albumin administration is robust.

in line with previous reports on groups of patients with
endothelial dysfunction [33]. We speculate that the concomitant correlation between C-reactive protein and the
synthesis rates of albumin (Fig. 4c) and fibrinogen, respectively, might partly relate to the fact that C-reactive
protein is also mainly synthesized in the liver, and that
the value is not only a marker of inflammation but also
in part of liver synthesis capacity.
The strength of this study lies in the application of
feasible methodology to assess the distribution of exogenous albumin during liver transplantation, a major
abdominal procedure. It is also the first assessment of
the recovery of export protein synthesis capacity in
the transplanted liver. The limitations are the small
size of the study and the unexpected heterogeneity of
the patients despite the strict inclusion criteria. Also,
the variable amount of ascites found at laparotomy
confounded the precise estimation of bleeding and
fluid shifts.
Conclusions
A routine of generous perioperative administration of
exogenous albumin during major abdominal surgery
(liver transplantation), which maintained plasma albumin concentration, resulted in a cumulative albumin
shift from plasma of 48 ± 33 g (p = 0.0017) until POD 3.
This corresponds to 68% of the net albumin balance
during that time period. The effects of this retention of
albumin on fluid balance and postoperative recovery remain to be elucidated. On POD 3 after liver transplantation the absolute synthesis rates of albumin and
fibrinogen were high, 239 ± 84 mg/kg body weight/day
and 33 (5; 161) mg/kg body weight/day, respectively,
which is in contrast to reports of the rates of synthesis
of liver-export proteins after other major abdominal surgical procedures.
Key Messages
 A generous exogenous albumin supply, to keep
plasma albumin unaltered, resulted in a cumulative
perioperative albumin shift, i.e. losses of albumin
from plasma not accounted for by bleeding, losses in
drains, or gains from blood products, of 37 ± 17 g at
end of surgery and of 48 ± 33 g on the third day
after liver transplantation.
 The cumulative perioperative albumin shift was
68% of the net amount of albumin administered
and it corresponded to 38% of the intravascular
albumin mass.
 Absolute synthesis rates of the liver export
proteins albumin and fibrinogen were high on the
third day after liver transplantation compared to
reference values.
