Abstract
Post-operative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication after surgery, occurring in 15–20% of patients. POD is associated 
with a higher complications rate and mortality. Literature on POD after liver transplantation (LT) is limited, with the few 
available studies reporting an incidence of 10–47%. The aim of this study was analyzing pattern, risk factors and clinical 
impact of POD after LT. Data on donor and recipient characteristics, postoperative course and POD of consecutive adult 
LT recipients from March 2016 to May 2018 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors for 
POD were analyzed using univariable logistic regression and Lasso regression. Kaplan–Meier method was used for survival 
analysis. 309 patients underwent LT during study period; 3 were excluded due to perioperative death. Incidence of POD 
was 13.4% (n=41). The median day of onset was 5th (IQR [4–7]) with a median duration of 4 days (IQR [3–7]). Several 
risk factors, related to the severity of liver disease and graft characteristics, were identifed. Graft macrovesicular steatosis 
was the only factor independently associated with POD at multivariable analysis (OR 1.27, CI 1.09–1.51, p=0.003). POD 
was associated with a higher rate of severe postoperative complications and longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, but 
did not signifcantly impact on patient and graft survival. Incidence of POD after LT is comparable to that observed after 
general surgery and graft factors are strongly associated with its onset. These results help identifying a subset of patients to 
be considered for preventive interventions.

Introduction
Post-operative delirium (POD) is one of the most common postoperative complications. Delirium can be defned 
as a transient, mostly reversible organic-mental syndrome 
that includes confusion, cognitive impairment, decline of 
vigilance, increased or reduced psychomotor activity and 
a disturbed sleep–wake cycle [1]. Prevalence in the general population is around 1–2%, whereas in hospitalized 
patients its incidence is 10–40%, with values reaching 56% 
in elderly patients and up to 87% in patients admitted to 
intensive care units (ICU) [1–3]. Nowadays, more and more 
elderly patients are considered eligible for surgery and surgical units have become familiar with the peculiarities of the 
ageing organism and its response to surgical stress [4, 5]. 
Postoperative delirium has been associated with prolonged 
length of ICU and hospital stay and increased costs of care, 
morbidity and mortality [6–8]. As incidence of POD can 
be reduced with specifc interventions, the rate of POD has 
been proposed as an indirect measure of the quality of surgical care [9].
Limited data are available about POD in the setting of 
liver transplantation (LT). Compared to the general population of surgical patients, LT patients are younger, more 
frequently afected by chronic disease and are treated with 
immunosuppressants and steroids. Therefore, knowledge on 
POD gathered in the general surgical population might not

be directly applicable to them. It has been suggested that 
pathogenesis of POD presenting after LT is multifactorial: 
infections, organ failure, encephalopathy and neurotoxicity 
of immunosuppressants have all been called into question. 
Reported POD incidence in LT patients ranges from 10 to 
47% [10–16]. Also in the setting of LT, POD has been associated with prolonged hospital and ICU stay, and increased 
mortality. Previous studies have linked POD to the use of 
antidepressant drugs before surgery, history of pre-LT portosystemic encephalopathy, alcohol abuse, retransplantation or 
high APACHE II score [10, 11, 13–16].
However, all available studies sufer from limited numerosity, lack a prospective diagnosis of POD using stringent 
criteria, or were performed and restricted to an ICU setting. 
As timely identifying patients at risk of developing POD is 
crucial to set up adequate precautionary interventions, the 
aim of this study was to analyze incidence, patterns and risk 
factors for POD after adult deceased-donor LT in a highvolume LT unit, using robust statistical methodology.
Patients and methods
Study population and design
This is a retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data on 309 consecutive adult LT recipients transplanted at our Center in the period from March 2016 to May 
2018 to identify incidence, pattern and risk factors of POD 
after LT. Diagnosis of POD was based on confusion assessment method (CAM) [17, 18] and was confrmed by a senior 
member of our dedicated team of transplant psychologists 
and psychiatrists who are in charge of pre-LT assessment 
and post-LT follow-up. In brief, patients matching POD 
diagnosis should present both changes of mental status 
characterized by acute onset and fuctuating course and 
inattention, and either disorganized thinking or an altered 
level of consciousness. For POD cases we also collected 
data concerning timing, duration, pharmacological treatment 
and associated clinical events (e.g. lines/drains/nasogastric tube self-removal, accidental falls, need for physical 
restraint measures, etc.). Brain imaging was not systematically obtained. For all patients, we collected data on pre-LT 
baseline patient characteristics (including history of alcohol 
abuse or hepatic encephalopathy), donor features, transplant 
operation (including number of packed red blood cells and 
other blood products units transfused, duration of surgery, 
end-procedure lactate) and postoperative period (including 
duration of mechanical ventilation, tacrolimus blood level, 
rejection episodes, graft function and other complications). 
Due to the retrospective observational nature of the study, 
approval by local ethics committee was not sought. All study 
procedures complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the Declaration of Istanbul.
Patient management
Indication for LT was discussed during multidisciplinary 
team meetings. All patients were systematically assessed by 
a transplant psychologist or psychiatrist before entering the 
waiting list. In patients with a history of alcohol abuse, a 
minimum of 3-months abstinence was confrmed by ethyl 
glucuronide hair test.
LT transplant anesthetic protocol included sedation by 
sodium thiopental or propofol (as induction agents), sevofurane (for anesthesia maintenance) and analgesia using 
sufentanil. Patients were monitored by the mean of Entropy®
monitoring during surgery without specifc targets unless the 
avoidance of values above 60. None of the patient received 
any premedication. Postoperative analgesia was based on 
continuous infusion of intra-venous morphine (usual dose 
between 0.6–1.2 mg/hour and stopped on postoperative day 
3 or 4) and paracetamol (1000 mg/8 h).
LT was performed as a rule using piggyback technique 
with inferior vena cava preservation. Veno-venous by-pass 
was never employed. In case there was a concern for hemostasis control at the end of LT operation, patients were 
treated with temporary abdominal packing and delayed 
abdominal wall closure (“open abdomen”), as previously 
described [19].
Immunosuppression was based on steroids (1000 mg 
methylprednisolone intra-operatively; 20 mg methylprednisolone or prednisone from day 1, tapered over 3 months), 
tacrolimus (target level 8–10 ng/ml) and mycophenolate 
mofetil. Tacrolimus trough level was measured daily in 
inpatients and twice a week in outpatients during the frst 
month. Induction with basiliximab (20 mg intra-operatively 
and on day 4) was administered in patients with autoimmune 
or cholestatic liver disease.
All patients were admitted to ICU after LT and discharged to the transplant ward based on clinical course and 
bed availability. After discharge from the hospital, they were 
followed-up at our outpatient clinic.
Defnitions
Early allograft dysfunction was defned according to the 
criteria proposed by Olthof et al. [20]. Postreperfusion 
syndrome (PRS) was defned as a drop in mean arterial 
pressure≥30% from baseline for at least one minute within 
5 min from graft reperfusion [21]. Severity of PRS was 
graded according to Hilmi et al. as mild or severe, this last 
being characterized by severe hemodynamic instability with 
hypotension, asystole, hemodynamically signifcant arrhythmias, or prolonged and/or recurrent fbrinolysis [22]. Acute

kidney injury (AKI) was defned and graded according to 
2012 KDIGO guidelines [23]. Postoperative complications 
were graded according to Clavien-Dindo classifcation [24]. 
Prognostic scores, including model for-end stage liver disease (MELD), donor age * MELD (D-MELD), and donor 
risk-index (DRI), were calculated using formulae from the 
original papers [25, 26].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables are reported as 
number and percentage. Pre-transplant patient characteristics, donor and transplant features, as well as outcomes 
were compared between patients who developed POD and 
controls. A stratifed descriptive analysis was initially performed using POD as a grouping variable. The Mann–Whitney, Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact tests were used to 
compare continuous and categorical variables, as appropriate. To identify variables associated with POD, univariable 
and multivariable logistic regression using least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method [27] were 
used. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier 
method. For all analyses, the level of signifcance was set 
at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with R version 3.6.1. (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria. URL: https://www.R-project.org/).
Results
309 LT were performed during study period, 3 of which 
were excluded due to on-table patient death, yielding a 
cohort of 306 patients for analysis. Incidence of POD was 
13.4% (n=41) (Fig. 1). Median timing of delirium onset and 
duration were 5th postoperative day (4–7) and 4 days (3–7), 
respectively (Fig. 2). POD was associated with an accidental 
fall in 3 (7.3%) patients, with nasogastric tube self-removal 
in 2 (4.9%) patients, with venous lines self-removal in 4 
(9.8%) patients and with the need for physical restraint 
measures in 8 (19.5%) patients. Haloperidol and promazine 
were the most frequently administered treatment in 32 (78%) 
and 15 (36.6%) of cases, respectively. Five patients were 
administered a combination of two or more drugs (Table 1).
We observed several diferences concerning baseline 
patient characteristics according to the development of POD 
(Table 2). In particular, patients who developed POD had 
lower pre-LT serum albumin (3.3 vs. 3.4 gr/dL) and sodium 
(137 vs. 140 mmol/L) levels, and higher bilirubin level (2.2 
vs. 1.6 mg/dL). They were more frequently admitted in hospital (9.8% vs. 3.8%) or ICU (9.8% vs. 3.8%) before LT, were 
more frequently on life support (9.8% vs. 1.9%) and had 
more frequently a history of hepatic encephalopathy (36.6% 
vs .18.1%) or were encephalopathic at LT (9.8% vs. 2.6%).
Patients in the POD group received a graft with a signifcant higher percentage of macrovesicular steatosis (3% 
vs. 0%), had higher levels of lactate at the end of LT (2.4 
vs. 2.0 mmol/L), a higher incidence of postreperfusion 
syndrome (24.4% vs. 12.8%) and required more frequently 
temporary packing followed by a delayed second-look 
operation (19.5% vs. 6.8%). D-MELD was higher in POD

patients (968 vs. 731). For analysis purpose, D-MELD was 
dichotomized into a binary variable with cutof = 1000, 
which was the value associated with a steep raise in the 
risk of POD.
Postoperative outcomes (Table 3) were generally inferior in patients who developed POD, as they required 
mechanical ventilation for longer (26 vs. 15 h) and had a 
higher rate of reoperation (22% vs. 10.2%) and grade IIIIV surgical complications (39% vs. 16%). Both hospital 
(18 vs. 11 days) and ICU stay (4 vs. 3 days) were prolonged in POD patients. Noteworthy, tacrolimus through 
levels were not signifcantly diferent during the frst 15 
postoperative days (Fig. 3).
At univariable logistic regression, several variables 
were associated with POD (Table  4). However, of the 
three variables included in the multivariable Lasso model 
(D-MELD>1000, history of encephalopathy and percentage of macrovesicular graft steatosis) only macrovesicular 
steatosis resulted signifcantly associated with POD (OR: 
1.27, CI: 1.09–1.51, p=0.003). Indeed, distribution of macrovesicular steatosis was diferent in patients who developed 
POD, confrming its association with POD (Fig. 4).
Finally, survival analysis showed a trend towards inferior 
survival in patients developing POD (Fig. 5). However, this 
fnding did not reach statistical signifcance.
Discussion
In this study, we linked POD delirium to several risk factors, confrming its multifactorial nature. The originality of 
our analysis is mainly represented by the inclusion of donor 
and transplant operation features in the analysis, which have 
been surprisingly neglected by previous literature on the 
subject (Table 5). To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
frst study highlighting that donor factors, in particular the 
degree of graft macrovesicular steatosis, play a major role 
in determining the onset of POD after LT.
Looking at our data, the whole picture appears rather 
clear. POD incidence was higher in patients with signs of 
more severely compromised hepatic function (lower sodium 
and higher bilirubin levels, history of encephalopathy), 
poor nutritional status (lower albumin) and who were more 
frequently admitted to hospital or on life support prior to 
LT. These patients also showed higher incidence of postreperfusion syndrome and higher lactate levels at the end 
of transplant operation, which are early signs of impaired 
graft function [28, 29], a fnding which in turn is in keeping 
with the association of POD with higher D-MELD and graft 
steatosis, this last being a well-known risk factor of poor 
graft function after LT [30]. Finally, patients sufering from 
POD also presented an increased rate of reoperation, had a

higher rate of severe postoperative complications and had 
longer ICU and hospital stay. Taken as a whole, these fndings suggest that delirium represents a hallmark of a more 
deranged physiology before and after LT. Sicker patients 
receiving suboptimal grafts and sufering from postoperative 
complications would be at particularly high risk of developing POD. These diferent risk factors appear to be closely 
interlinked and likely act in an additive way. Surprisingly, 
multivariable analysis identifed macrovesicular steatosis 
as the only variable independently associated with POD, 
suggesting that graft quality and function is pivotal in determining POD after LT. Although the minimal median diference in the degree of macrovesicular steatosis between study 
groups (0% vs. 3%) could seem clinically insignifcant, it 
should be noted that this diference refected a completely 
diferent distribution of this variable, as shown in Fig. 4.
In part, the concept that POD rate can be higher in 
sicker patients has been suggested by previous studies. 
Lescot et al. [14] identifed renal replacement therapy, 
history of encephalopathy and packed red blood cells 
transfusion as risk factors for POD, highlighting the relevance of intraoperative events, along with patient history. 
In a study on the incidence of POD in the setting of ICU 
after living donor LT by Wang et al. [16] patients with 
APACHE II score ≥ 16 or who were on mechanical ventilation for≥5 days were at higher risk of POD. The role 
of mechanical ventilation was confrmed by Bhattacharya 
et al. [10], who also found an association of POD with 
age, MELD, pre-LT hospital admission, history of alcohol abuse, urinary and pulmonary infection, and combined 
transplantation. Overall, these fndings are in keeping with 
the hypothesis that POD may represent a response to surgical and physiological stress. In this view, POD could 
be frequently interpreted as an epiphenomenon of poor 
pre-LT status or a complicated postoperative course. Our 
analysis confrms this concept and takes it one step further 
by linking POD to graft factors, which are major determinants of postoperative course after LT.
Incidence of POD in our series was 13.4%, which is 
lower as compared to previous series in the setting of LT 
[10–16], but comparable to the fgure in the general surgical population [9, 31, 32]. This discrepancy is likely due 
to the diferent diagnostic modalities employed in previous 
studies, which is also refected by the high variability of 
POD incidence across diferent series (Table 5). In contrast 
with previous studies [10, 11, 16], we did not identify history of alcohol consumption before LT as a risk factor for 
LT. This can be explained by our rigorous selection policy 
for transplant candidates with alcoholic cirrhosis, who are 
closely followed-up during the evaluation process and while 
on the waiting list. Also, patients presenting with symptoms 
of abstinence from alcohol after LT were not classifed as 
having POD unless they matched aforementioned diagnostic criteria for POD. Unfortunately, data about duration of 
alcohol abstinence before LT and concomitant use of other 
recreational drugs, which may have allowed fne-tuning our 
analysis, were not available.
As POD has been associated with reduced 1-year survival and long-term cognitive impairment [6–8], early 
identifcation of patients at increased risk for POD and 
implementation of mitigation or prevention strategies is of 
paramount importance. Environmental interventions like 
early discharge from ICU, resumption of oral feeding, lines 
and drains removal and free access to the ward for patient’s 
families are widely adopted in our unit. Among pharmacological interventions, sedation with dexmedetomidine, an 
α2-adrenoceptor agonist, has shown promising results in the 
general population [33]. However, data are lacking in the 
setting of LT and, as dexmedetomidine has prevalent hepatic 
metabolism [34], its use could be problematic in the early 
postoperative course after LT.
Limitations of our study include its retrospective, singlecenter nature. As aforementioned, limited information about 
duration of alcohol abstinence, social background and associated use of other substances might have precluded fnding a signifcant association of POD with history of alcohol 
abuse.

Conclusion
In conclusion, POD after LT is associated with severity of 
pre-LT hepatic disease and with graft features. In particular, 
graft steatosis in the only factor independently associated 
with POD. Incidence of POD is higher in patients sufering 
from severe complications and with a prolonged postoperative stay. Further studies are needed to identify strategies to 
prevent POD after LT.
