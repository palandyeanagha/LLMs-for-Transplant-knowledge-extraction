Abstract
Background: Regulatory B (Breg) cells represent one of the B cell subsets that infiltrate solid tumors and exhibit
distinct phenotypes in different tumor microenvironments. However, the phenotype, function and clinical relevance
of Breg cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are presently unknown.
Methods: Flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine the levels, phenotypes and functions of TIM1+
Breg cells in samples from 51 patients with HCC. Kaplan-Meier plots for overall survival and disease-free survival
were generated using the log-rank test. TIM-1+
Breg cells and CD8+ T cells were isolated, stimulated and/or cultured
in vitro for functional assays. Exosomes and B cells were isolated and cultured in vitro for TIM-1+
Breg cell expansion
assays.
Results: Patients with HCC showed a significantly higher TIM-1+
Breg cell infiltration in their tumor tissue compared with
the paired peritumoral tissue. The infiltrating TIM-1+
Breg cells showed a CD5highCD24−CD27−/+CD38+/high phenotype,
expressed high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and exhibited strong suppressive activity against CD8+ T
cells. B cells activated by tumor-derived exosomes strongly expressed TIM-1 protein and were equipped with suppressive
activity against CD8+ T cells similar to TIM-1+
Breg cells isolated from HCC tumor tissue. Moreover, the accumulation of
TIM-1+
Breg cells in tumors was associated with advanced disease stage, predicted early recurrence in HCC and reduced
HCC patient survival. Exosome-derived HMGB1 activated B cells and promoted TIM-1+
Breg cell expansion via the Toll like
receptor (TLR) 2/4 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.
Conclusions: Our results illuminate a novel mechanism of TIM-1+
Breg cell-mediated immune escape in HCC and provide
functional evidence for the use of these novel exosomal HMGB1-TLR2/4-MAPK pathways to prevent and to treat this
immune tolerance feature of HCC.
Introduction
Humoral immunity, in addition to cellular immunity,
has recently been reported to play a key role in tumor
progression [1, 2]. As the central component of humoral
immunity, B cells function in immunoglobulin (Ig) production, antigen presentation, and proinflammatory
cytokine secretion. Regulatory B (Breg) cells, a subset of
B cells, have been confirmed to regulate immune responses through a variety of ways [3, 4]. Recent studies
have revealed the existence of protumorigenic Breg cells
in tumor tissue [5–8]. However, those Breg cells have
showed different phenotypes and functions.
T cell Ig and mucin domain (TIM)-1, a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been identified as one of three
members of the human TIM family of genes that regulate immune responses [9, 10]. TIM-1 was first identified
to play a costimulatory role in the activation of CD4+ T

cells and dendritic cells; in TIM-1 exerts an important
effect by regulating cellular function [9, 11–13]. However, recent studies have confirmed that TIM-1 is mainly
expressed by B cells and that TIM-1 acts as a marker for
Breg cells [14]. TIM-1+
Breg cells appear to include the
highest proportion of IL-10-producing B cells, are 8–
20-fold enriched for IL-10 expression compared with all
other B cell subsets, and comprise over 70% of all IL-10
producing-B cells [15]. Their regulatory function and relationship with systemic autoimmune disease or transplantation have been characterized [15–18]. However,
the biological function of TIM-1+
Breg cells in the human tumor microenvironment has not been illustrated.
Exosomes are endosome-derived small intraluminal vesicles that are characterized by a size range from 30 to 200
nm in diameter and contain a variety of biological substances, including miRNAs, circRNAs, proteins, lipids,
and soluble factors, that are transferred to target cells to
play roles as important mediators in cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes derived from tumor cells have been reported to regulate the phenotypes and functions of
immune cells [19–23]. Recently, High mobility group box
1 (HMGB1) was demonstrated to be expressed on tumorderived exosomal membranes and packaged in human
amnion epithelial cell-derived exosomes (AECD-exosomes) [24] [25]. HMGB1 is an evolutionarily conserved
DNA-binding nuclear protein that has been determined
to be a damage molecular pattern (DAMP) protein involved in several disease states, including cancer, arthritis
and sepsis [26]. Tumor cells can release HMGB1 into the
local microenvironment, where HMGB1 binds with high
affinity to several receptors, such as toll like receptor-2
(TLR-2), TLR-4, TLR-9 and advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which can lead to tumor cell survival, expansion and metastasis [27]. However, whether HMGB1
expressed on tumor-derived exosomes can induce protumorigenic Breg production is not well known.
Materials and methods
Patients samples and cell lines
Human liver and HCC samples from resected HCC were
obtained from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University. None of the patients had received
anticancer therapy before surgical resection, and patients
with concurrent HIV, other cancer or autoimmune disease were excluded. Paired tumor and peritumoral liver
tissue samples and fresh samples of blood from 51 HCC
patients who underwent curative resection between September 2016 and August 2017 were used to isolate immune cells (Additional file 1: Table S1). Among the
samples, those from 20 HCC patients treated between
December 2016 and March 2017 were used to analyze
gene expression and perform immunoblotting. The tissue samples were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
or immunofluorescence (IF) at the same hospital where
the patients underwent surgical resection between September 2011 and December 2012 (Additional file 2:
Table S2). Clinical stages were classified according to the
guidelines of the International Union against Cancer. Patient consent was obtained from each patient, and the
protocol was approved by the Review Board of the Third
Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. HuH7,
HepG2, Hep3B, LM3, and LO2 cells were obtained from
ATCC.
Isolation of immune cells from the peripheral blood and
tissue samples
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using a standard Ficoll procedure. Tissue-infiltrating
leukocytes were dissociated from tissue specimens and
collected as described previously [28]. Specimens were cut
into small pieces and dissociated using RPMI 1640
medium (Gibco) supplemented with 0.05% collagenase IV
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.002% DNase I (Roche), and 20% FBS
(Gibco) at 37 °C for 1 h. Dissociated cells were filtered
through a 150-mm mesh and separated by Ficoll centrifugation (Axis-Shield), and the mononuclear cells were
washed with HBSS and resuspended in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Flow cytometry
Immunophenotyping was performed on a BD flow cytometer (BD LSR2) and the identification of exosomes was
performed on a BD flow cytometer (Accuri C6) following
the standard manufacturer’s protocols. The results were
analyzed using FlowJo 10.0 software. The immune cells
were stained with the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
used as listed in Additional file 3: Table S3. Detailed staining protocol were previously described [28]. For the intracellular staining of B cells, brefeldin A (10 mg/ml;
Sigma-Aldrich) was added during the last 4 h of stimulation. The cells were washed with PBS and stained with
monoclonal antibodies specific for CD19, CD27, CD38,
CD5, CD24 or CD8 for 30 min at 4 °C. After the cells were
washed in PBS, they were fixed and permeabilized with a
fixation/permeabilization solution (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA) for 20 min at room temperature. Then,
the cells were washed again and stained with monoclonal
antibodies against IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ for 30 min at
room temperature.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich) and then cut into 4-um sections, which were
processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described [28]. Then, the sections were incubated with a
primary antibody against human TIM-1 (Sigma-Aldrich).
The staining was detected by a Dako-Cytomation

Envision Horseradish Peroxidase System (DakoCytomation). Two independent observers who were blinded to
the clinical outcomes evaluated the immunohistochemical variables.
For the immunofluorescence analysis, paraffin-embedded
human HCC sections were stained with mouse anti-CD20
(Abcam) plus rabbit anti TIM-4 (Abcam) antibodies,
followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG plus CY3-
conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Abcam). Positive
cells were detected by confocal microscopy (LSM 510, Carl
Zeiss; ZEN 2010 software). All antibodies are listed in
Additional file 4: Table S4.
Isolation of human CD19+ B or CD8+ T cells from the
peripheral blood
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from
healthy donor blood samples by Ficoll centrifugation
(Axis-Shield). CD19+ B or CD8+ T cells (more than 95%
CD19+ or CD8+
) were purified from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells using a MACS CD19+ B or CD8+ T
cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech).
Elisa
For the collection of tumor-infiltrating TIM-1− and
TIM-1+ B cells, tumor–infiltrating leukocytes were dissociated from tissue specimens as described above.
Then, tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were stained with
the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies anti-CD19-
BV421 and anti-TIM-1-PE. TIM-1− and TIM-1+
B cells
were harvested by FACS sorting. To measure the level of
the cytokine IL-10, 1 × 105 TIM-1- and TIM-1+
B cells
were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 72 h.
Then, the culture supernatants were collected for ELISA
analysis. The levels of human IL-10 were determined
using human ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Gene expression analysis
A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was performed on a
total of 20 mRNA samples isolated from the HCC tumor
tissue and peritumoral liver tissue samples as described
previously [29]. Real-time PCR for mRNA detection was
performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche).
Data were normalized to the reference gene GAPDH.
The primers used were as follows: HMGB1 primers:
FW’ ACATCCAAAATCTTGATCAGTTA, RV’ AGGA
CAGACTTTCAAAATGTTT and GAPDH primers: FW’
GGGAAGCTTGTCATCAATGG, RV’ CATCGCCCCA
CTTGATTTTG.
Western blot analysis and Wes automated simple western
assay
Whole-cell proteins were extracted and analyzed using
the procedure for a normal western blot as previously
described [28]. The Wes simple western system is an automated capillary electrophoresis with immunodetection
approach that eliminates the blotting steps and improves
accuracy, reproducibility and quantification compared
with normal western blotting [30]. The identification of
exosomes was performed using a Wes simple western
instrument (Wes, Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA). Wes
Master Kits were used following the standard manufacturer’s protocols. The results were imaged and analyzed
using Compass software. The antibodies were used as
listed in Additional file 4: Table S4.
Exosome isolation from cell lines
Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of
conditioned media collected from various cell lines, including HuH7, HepG2, Hep3B, LM3 and LO2 cells. All
culture medium contained polymyxin B (20 μg/ml;
Sigma-Aldrich) to eliminate endotoxin contamination.
The cells were grown in their respective conditioned
media to 70 to 80% confluency. The medium was then
replaced with medium containing FBS depleted of microparticles by differential centrifugation (18 h at
100,000×g). After a 48 h incubation, the conditioned
media were initially cleared of dead cells/cellular debris
with sequential spins at 300×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The
resulting supernatants were then spun at 11,200×g for
32 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a
0.22 μm screen to remove large vesicles. Then, the
supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000×g for 120
min at 4 °C. The final exosome pellet was resuspended
in 1× PBS filtered through a 0.22 μm screen.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Exosomes suspended in PBS filtered through a 0.22 μm
screen were layered on copper grids with 0.125% Formvar in chloroform and stained with 1% uranyl acetate
in ddH2O. The exosomes were then placed on a transmission electron microscopy grid, and images were acquired using a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron
microscope.
NanoTracker analysis of exosomes
Exosome fractions isolated from the cell lines were diluted to meet the appropriate concentration analyzed on
a ZETASIZER Nano series-Nano-ZS. The videos were
merged and analyzed using the NanoSight® software program. The results show the particle size distribution vs.
intensity (percent).
TIM-1+ B cell induction in vitro
CD19+ B cells (2 × 105 cells/well) isolated from healthy
blood were left unprocessed or exposed to CpG ODN
(InvivoGen, 2 μg/mL), recombinant Human HMGB1
(R&D Systems, 10 μg/mL), or exosomes from LO2, HuH7,

HepG2, Hep3B and LM3 cells (2–3 μg in 50 μL PBS) prepared for 3 days or the indicated time. The cells were harvested for western blotting or stained with fluorochromeconjugated antibodies and then analyzed by FACS. In
some experiments, CD19+ B cells were pretreated with
2 μg/mL CpG ODN, 10 μg/ml anti-HMGB1, 20 μg/ml
blocking antibody against TLR-2 or TLR-4 (eBioscience)
or a specific inhibitor of the p38 (SB 203580,20 μM), Erk
(U 0126,20 μM), or Jnk (SP 600125,5 μM) signal (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequently exposed to the indicated
stimuli.
CFSE-based CD8+ T cell proliferation assay and cytokine
production assays
CD19+ B cells (2 × 105 cells/well) in a 96-well plate were
harvested after exposure to CpG ODN plus recombinant
human HMGB1 or exosomes for 3 days. Next, the cells
were collected, washed with PBS and centrifuged at
400×g for 5 min at 4 °C. CD8+ T cells were harvested
from the same healthy person at the same time and activated with IL-2 (150 IU/ml, PeproTech) for 3 days. CD8+
T cells were labeled with 1.5 μM CFSE (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in 0.1% BSA in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C and
quenched with cold PBS. Then, CFSE-labeled CD8+ T
cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in a 96-well plate
in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS.
TIM-1+ B cells add to the CD8+ T cells at a ratio of 1:1.
Next, the CD8+ T cells were activated by the addition of
2 μl anti-CD3 and 5 μl anti-CD28 beads (eBioscience)
per well for 3 days. Subsequently, CD8+ T cell proliferation and TNF-α and IFN-γ expression was measured by
flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The statistical significance of differences between groups was analyzed by the log-rank test or Student’s t test.
Correlations between two parameters were assessed by
Pearson’s correlation analysis. A multivariate analysis of
the prognostic factors for the overall survival curve and
disease-free survival curve was performed using the Cox
proportional hazards model and log-rank test. The cumulative survival time was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. All data were analyzed using
two-tailed tests, and P < 0.05 was considered the standard of statistical significance. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.
Results
High infiltration of TIM-1+ B cells is correlated with advanced
disease stage and poor survival in patients with HCC
We used flow cytometry to analyze the TIM-1 expression of B cells from 30 normal blood samples and 51
HCC specimens (Additional file 1: Table S1) comprising
blood samples and paired peritumor liver and tumor tissue samples. TIM-1 was expressed on more circulating
B cells in HCC patients than healthy donors (Fig. 1a,
and b). The percentage of TIM-1+
B cells in the HCC patients was significantly increased in the tumor compared
to the blood and peritumor liver (Fig. 1c). Our results
showed that the percentage of TIM-1+
B cells in lung
cancer patients was significantly increased in the tumor
compared to the blood and peritumor lung (Additional
file 5: Figure S1), which was similar to the HCC results.
Importantly, the proportion of TIM-1+
B cells in the
tumor tissue was positively correlated with patient TNM
stage (Fig. 1d, and e), microvascular invasion (Fig. 1f,
and g) and early recurrence (Fig. 1h and Additional file
6: Table S5).
Based on our observation that high accumulations of
infiltrating TIM-1+
B cells are correlated with advanced
disease stage, we subsequently examined the relationship
between TIM-1 expression and the survival of patients
with HCC (Fig. 1i). According to the median value of
TIM-1 density, the HCC patients who underwent curative resection and had recorded follow-up data were divided into two groups (n = 101, Additional file 2: Table
S2). Indeed, obviously negative associations were observed between TIM-1+ cell density and disease-free survival (n = 101, p = 0.018, Fig. 1j) or overall survival (n =
101, p = 0.007, Fig. 1k). Both the univariate analysis and
multivariate analysis revealed that the TIM-1 expression
level in the tumor tissue was an independent prognostic
factor for DFS and OS (Additional file 7: Table S6).
TIM-1+B cells are regulatory B cells that exhibit a unique
phenotype and function
Since the accumulation of TIM-1+B cells was negatively
correlated with DFS and OS in HCC patients, we used
flow cytometry to investigate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TIM-1+
B cells from the blood,
peritumor liver tissue, and tumor tissue from individual
patients. As is well known, conventional peripheral
IL-10-producing Breg cells are defined as CD5+
CD24highCD27+CD38high B cells. Interestingly, compared
with the TIM-1+
B cells from the paired blood and peritumor liver samples, tumor-infiltrating TIM-1+
B cells
exhibited a CD5highCD24−
CD27−/+CD38+/high phenotype, which is different from the conventional peripheral
Breg phenotype (Fig. 2a). Consistently, the tumorinfiltrating TIM-1+
B cells showed increases in the
expression levels of CD5, CD27 and CD38 compared to
the TIM-1−
B cells (Fig. 2b). Several studies have
reported that TIM-1 is an inclusive surface marker for
IL-10-producing Breg cells [14–16, 31]. Indeed, our
results showed that IL-10 was mainly expressed by
TIM-1+
B cells rather than TIM-1−B cells (Fig. 2b).
Moreover, tumor tissue-derived TIM-1+
B cells were

potent suppressors of CD8+ T cell effector functions, as
the TNF-α and IFN-γ production of CD8+ effector T
cells was significantly decreased after coculture with
TIM-1+ B cells or without depleting TIM-1+
B cells (Fig.
2c, and d and Additional file 8: Figure S2). In addition,
we further determined the relationship between
TIM-1+
B cells and CD8+ T cells in 18 HCC patients,
and the results demonstrated that the frequency of
CD8+ effector T cells negatively correlated with the frequency of TIM-1+
B cells (Fig. 2e).
As TIM-1 has been reported to be a potent regulator
of T cell effector responses in both auto- and alloimmunity [12, 16, 17], we investigated the role of TIM-1 signaling in TIM-1+
B cell function. Interestingly, an agonistic
antibody against TIM-1 triggered TIM-1+
B cells to produce IL-10 but showed no effect on the IL-10 production
of TIM-1−
B cells (Fig. 3a). Additionally, TIM-4, the natural ligand for TIM-1, was mainly expressed by CD11b+
myeloid cells (Fig. 3b), and the confocal microscopy results showed that TIM-4+ myeloid cells and B cells were
located in the same region (Fig. 3c), which suggests that
myeloid cells could promote TIM-1+
B cells to produce
IL-10 through TIM-1/TIM-4 signaling.
Tumor-derived exosomes promoted TIM-1+B cell
expansion via HMGB1
Exosomes have been shown to play an important in the
communication between immune cells and cancer cells by
transferring important cellular cargo [22, 23, 32]. We
therefore determined the effect of tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) on TIM-1+
B cell expansion. Exosomes were
isolated from cell lines (LO2, HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, and
LM3 cells) by differential centrifugation and identified by
electron microscopy, western blotting, flow cytometry and
NanoTracker analysis (Fig. 4a, b, c, and d). Tumor-derived
exosomes showed a strong potential to induce the substantial development of TIM-1+
B cells from healthy blood
B cells, whereas hepatocyte-derived exosomes failed to induce the generation of TIM-1+
B cells (Fig. 4e, and f ).
Due to HMGB1 playing a key role in tumor progression, we analyzed the amount of HMGB1 in 20 HCC tissue samples and their paired peritumor liver samples by
qPCR (Fig. 4h) and also analyzed four paired samples by
western blotting (Fig. 4g). Consistent with a previous report [26], our results showed that the expression of
HMGB1 was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in
peritumor liver tissue. The expression of HMGB1 was
much higher in HCC-derived exosomes than LO2-derived exosomes (Fig. 4i). HMGB1 was found to be
expressed on the exosomal membrane (Additional file 9:
Figure S3), and the major source of HMGB1 in the cultures was not the active or passive release of HMGB1 by
B cells (Additional file 10: Figure S4). To determine
whether HMGB1 could facilitate the expansion of
TIM-1+ B cells, we added HMGB1 or a neutralizing
antibody against HMGB1 to the culture system and
found that HMGB1 alone could facilitate the production
of TIM-1+
B cells, while the neutralizing antibody against
HMGB1 could reverse the promotive effect of
tumor-derived exosomes on the development of TIM1+
B cells (Fig. 4j, and k).
Tumor-derived exosomes trigger B cells to exhibit strong
suppressive activity against CD8+ T cells via HMGB1
Next, we investigated whether TDEs or HMGB1-induced
TIM-1+
B cells could inhibit CD8+ T cell proliferation and
function. For this aim, CD19+ B cells and CD8+ T cells
were purified from the same human PBMC sample. As
described above, TIM-1+
B cells induced by TDEs or
HMGB1 were coculture with CD8+ T cells that were stimulated using anti-CD3/CD28 mAb beads. Compared with
the CD8+ T cells alone or noninduced B cells cultured
with the CD8+ T cells groups, the groups with TDE- or
HMGB1-induced TIM-1+
B cells cocultured with CD8+ T
cells demonstrated direct suppression of CD8+ T cell proliferation and TNF-α and IFN-γ production by the
TIM-1+
B cells, whereas the anti-HMGB1 antibody group
showed significantly decreased suppression of CD8+ T cell
proliferation and function by TIM-1+
B cells (Fig. 5a, b, c,
d, e, and f ).
Tumor-derived exosomal HMGB1 induced TIM-1+B cell
expansion through the TLR-MAPK pathway
HMGB1 binds with high affinity to several receptors, including the receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) as well as Toll like receptor (TLR)-2, − 4, and − 9

[26]. Our results showed that blocking TLR-2 or TLR-4
significantly downregulated the frequency of TIM-1+
B
cells compared with the control treatment, while blocking
TLR-9 and RAGE did not affect the frequency of
TIM-1+
B cells (Additional file 11: Figure S5). A recent
study [8] demonstrated that TLR signaling participates in
PD-1high B cell induction through the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To further confirm the
mechanisms involved in the induction of TIM-1+
B cells
by HMGB1, we examined the activation kinetics of
MAPK, which is downstream of TLR2/4 signaling. Activation of the MAPK pathways was selectively enhanced in B
cells stimulated with TDEs or HMGB1 compared with the
other stimulations, and the activation of the MAPK pathways was inhibited with anti-HMGB1 antibody treatment
(Fig. 6a and b).
To determine the role of the TLR2/4-MAPK pathway in
the TIM-1+
B cell expansion mediated by tumor-derived
exosomal HMGB1, a TLR2/4 blocking reagent and MAPK
inhibitors were added to the culture system. Our results
showed that blocking TLR2/4 significantly downregulated
the frequency of TIM-1+
B cells and impaired the suppressive effects of TDE-induced B cells on CD8+ T cell proliferation and TNF-α and IFN-γ production (Fig. 6c, d, e, f,
g, h and i). MAPK inhibitors also effectively downregulated the frequency of TIM-1+
B cells and impaired the
suppressive effects of TDE-induced B cells on CD8+ T cell
proliferation and TNF-α and IFN-γ production (Fig. 6c, d,
e, f, g, h and i).
Discussion
Understanding the cellular and molecular underpinnings
of HCC-associated immune modulation is a prerequisite
for the development of immunotherapy-based treatment
approaches for this deadly malignancy. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized protumorigenic TIM1+
Breg cell subset and applied multiple analysis approaches to analyze the phenotype, biological function,
mechanisms of induction, and clinical relevance of these
cells in the HCC microenvironment. Our results showed

that TIM-1+
Breg cells exhibited a novel phenotype and
function that were different from those of the conventional peripheral Breg cells [33, 34]. Moreover, tumorderived exosomes induced B cells to become
TIM-1+
Breg cells through the HMGB1-TLR2/4-MAPK
pathway. Additionally, strong infiltration of TIM-1+
B
cells was correlated with advanced disease stage and
poor survival in patients with HCC.
Breg cells have been recently identified as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and
cancer. Breg cells have been reported to be enriched in patients with cancer and to be associated with advance disease stage and poor prognosis [8, 35, 36]. However, Breg
cells derived from different tumor microenvironments exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. Here, we demonstrated that in the context of HCC, TIM-1+
Breg cells, an
unrecognized protumorigenic B cell subset, exhibited a
CD5highCD24−
CD27−/+CD38+/high phenotype. Importantly, TIM-1 was not only a surface marker but also a
functional marker because triggering this molecule with
an agonistic antibody induced TIM-1+ Breg cells to produce IL-10. Additionally, we identified that the TIM-1 ligand TIM-4 was mainly expressed on myeloid cells, which
were determined to come into contact with B cells in the
HCC microenvironment, suggesting that myeloid cells
could induce TIM-1+ Breg cells to produce IL-10 through
TIM-1/TIM-4 signaling. Thus, these results showed that
TIM-1+
Breg cells in HCC are different from conventional
peripheral Breg cells.
In mice, TIM-1 has been reported to be an importance
receptor for the induction and function of Breg cells,
which preserve transplant immune tolerance and prevent autoimmunity [14, 31]. Many studies have showed
that the BCR, CD40L and IL-21 pathways are required
for IL-10-producing Breg cell induction and development [37]. However, recent studies have found that
TIM-1 ligation could induce IL-10-producing Breg cells,
and TIM-1 signaling was also required for the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production by Breg
cells. Moreover, some reports have indicated that the
interaction between TIM-1 and its ligand plays a crucial
role in Th2 polarization [38]. TIM-4 is the natural ligand
of TIM-1 and is expressed on DCs [38, 39]. In our investigation, we found that TIM-4 was mainly expressed on
myeloid cells, which induced TIM-1+
Breg cells to produce IL-10 through TIM-1/TIM-4 signaling.
TIM-1+
Breg cells have been shown to be involved in
autoimmune disease and transplantation tolerance.
However, the underlying mechanism contributing to the
accumulation of TIM-1+
Breg cells remains to be elucidated. With the emergence of exosomes as central
players in HCC pathogenesis and the expanding list of
reported exosome-mediated immunomodulatory effects
[21–23, 40], we hypothesized that HCC-derived exosomes could play a role in regulating immune cells during tumor progression. HMGB1 was recently reported to
be expressed on tumor-derived exosomes [24] and packaged in human AECD exosomes [25]. HMGB1 has been
determined to play both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic roles. HMGB1 can act as an antitumorigenesis
protein when it is located in the nucleus, where it stabilizes the chromosomes and maintains telomere length.
On the other hand, extracellular HMGB1 is recognized
as a prototypical DAMP, which has the protumorigenic
role of promoting tumor progression [41]. In our study,
HMGB1 was highly expressed on tumor-derived exosomes but not on hepatocyte-derived exosomes. The
treatment of B cells with exosomes from HCC resulted
in an increase in TIM-1+ Breg cell abundance, which
was dependent on exosome-associated HMGB1. The
major source of HMGB1 in the cultures was the
tumor-derived exosomal membrane, not the active or
passive release of HMGB1 from B cells (Additional file
10: Figure S4). Moreover, HMGB1 derived from
tumor-derived exosomes was particularly potent for inducing TIM-1+
Breg cell expansion, which promoted
HCC progression by impairing the function of CD8+ effector T cells. Thus, our study revealed a new mechanism of HMGB1-mediated HCC progression.
The mechanism of tumor cell survival, expansion and
metastasis is binding to TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-9 and RAGE,
which mediates HMGB1-dependent activation [27]. However, the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways are all
downstream of TLR signaling [42]. A recent study [8]
(See figure on previous page.)

western blotting (b), flow cytometry (c) and NanoTracker analysis (d). (e) After 3 days, CD19+ B cells (2 × 105 cells/well) from healthy donor PBMCs

B cells. f The dot plot represents the average percentages of TIM-1+B cells

demonstrated that TLR signaling participates in PD-1high
B cell induction through the MAPK pathway. Moreover,
TLR signaling has been recognized to promote antigen
presenting cell maturation and proinflammatory cytokine
production [43]. In our study, by blocking the activity of
TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-9 and RAGE independently, we
showed that the frequency of TIM-1+ Breg cells was
downregulated only in the TLR-2 and TLR-4 blockade
groups (Additional file 11: Fig. S5). Recent studies have
demonstrated that the activation of TLR-dependent signaling and HMGB1-RAGE can stimulate autophagy [44].
However, we found no change in the levels of
autophagy-related molecules during TIM-1+ Breg cell induction (Additional file 12: Figure S6). The TLR2/
4-MAPK pathway was activated during TIM-1+ Breg cell
expansion, and targeting these signaling molecules

impaired HMGB1-mediated TIM-1+
Breg cell expansion
and the suppressive function of TIM-1+
Breg cells against
CD8+ T cells, which suggest that HCC promotes the accumulation of TIM-1+
Breg cells through the TLR2/4-MAPK
pathway. Thus, our study highlights a novel pathway
whereby HCC cells are able to release exosomes with the
potential to promote the accumulation of TIM-1+
Breg
cells.
Based on our data, we propose a model describing the
role of TIM-1+
Breg cells in HCC progression (Additional
file 13: Figure S7). First, HCC cells release exosomes with
the potential to promote the accumulation of TIM-1+
Breg
cells through the HMGB1-TLR2/4-MAPK pathway. Second, TIM-1+
Breg cells create an immunosuppressive
microenvironment by secreting IL-10 and impairing CD8+
T cell functions, which provides favorable conditions for
HCC progression. Third, myeloid cells further strengthen
the immunosuppressive function of TIM-1+
Breg cells
through TIM-1/TIM-4 signaling. In the future, therapeutics aimed at interfering with these pathological
TIM-1+
Breg cells and the HMGB1-TLR2/4-MAPK immunosuppressive pathway may be developed to provide
novel strategies for HCC treatment.
