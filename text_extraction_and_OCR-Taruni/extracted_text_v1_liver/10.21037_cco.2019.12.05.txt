Introduction
Overview
Cholangiocarcinoma is a lethal disease of the biliary 
tract (1). Depending on the anatomical location (Figure 1),
tumors are either classified as intrahepatic or extrahepatic.
These tumors present numerous challenges for patients 
and physicians: advanced disease presentation for the 
majority of patients, recurrence after surgery, therapeutic 
resistance, and medical complications caused by the tumors.
For both intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHCC) and 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (EHCC), respectively,
medical complications such as biliary obstruction and 
vascular compromise of the liver are often life-threatening,
emphasizing that LC of these tumors is paramount for 
many patients. The management of these different biliary 
tract cancers to achieve LC differs in important ways.
In patients with early stage, resectable cancers, LC 
is often adequately achieved with surgery. However,
for advanced stage (locally advanced and metastatic) 
presentations, surgery is not usually a viable option. Most 
patients will only receive palliative chemotherapy when 
they have advanced disease, but emerging evidence suggests 
that prolongation of life for patients with unresectable 
locally advanced IHCC can be achieved with escalated dose 
radiation therapy (EDRT) (2,3). Application of EDRT 
to EHCC (4), on the other hand, has not been associated 
with prolonged survival largely due to limitations of giving 
higher radiation doses near bowel and stomach. Here, we 
review the recent data with EDRT for IHCC and EHCC,
and point to areas of future investigation in an era of 
molecular characterization and personalized medicine for

Abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) 
remain challenging diseases to treat. The majority of patients present with advanced disease, and the tumors 
often cause life-threatening biliary obstruction and vascular compromise of the liver. Local control (LC) of 
these tumors has the potential to prolong life for patients. While escalated-dose radiation therapy (EDRT) 
has been demonstrated to be an effective, safe option to achieve LC of IHCC, data for EHCC suggest 
that EDRT with current techniques has limitations, often due to dose-limiting bowel structures in close 
proximity to the extrahepatic biliary system. Here we review the results of EDRT for IHCC and EHCC and 
point to potential directions to combine radiotherapy with novel agents. The molecular characterization of 
cholangiocarcinoma has particularly opened new avenues for clinical investigations of targeted therapies with 
EDRT and may point to ways to achieve both systemic and LC benefits for patients.

cholangiocarcinoma (5).
History of radiation therapy in the treatment of 
cholangiocarcinoma
Historically, the utilization of radiation therapy for liver 
lesions has been limited by the risk for radiation-induced 
liver disease (RILD) (6). However, the use of focal high 
doses of radiation was shown to be safe in a series of seminal 
studies in the 1990s and 2000s (7,8). Since those studies, the 
role of radiation therapy in the management of liver cancers 
has been expanding. The advent of technological advances 
such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), respiratory 
management methods, and improved image guidance have 
enabled potentially ablative doses for the treatment of 
cholangiocarcinoma (2). 
Importance of LC
Several studies have shown that local progression in IHCC 
and EHCC often leads to liver failure and subsequent death 
(2-4). Tao et al. demonstrated that a majority of patients 
with unresectable IHCC die from tumor-related liver 
failure due to vascular compromise or biliary obstruction (3). 
A follow-up study that included surgical cases demonstrated 
that, within a cohort of patients with IHCC and for 
which cause of death was known, 54% died from tumor 
progression leading to tumor-related liver failure (9). LC is 
similarly important in EHCC. While a higher proportion of 
patients with EHCC die of extrahepatic disease burden or 
other organ failure compared to IHCC, local tumor-related 
complications remain an important contributor to patient 
death (4). 
Liver-directed treatment options for IHCC and EHCC
We previously reviewed the current management options 
of unresectable IHCC (10) and more generally discussed 
the technological advancements that enable ablative 
radiation doses for large liver lesions (Figure 2) (2). Possible 
alternatives to external beam radiation therapy include, 
radioemolization with Yttrium-90, radiofrequency ablation, 
and transarterial chemoembolization. The rationale to 
use a given liver-directed therapy is largely based on 
physician experience at a given hospital and availability of 
the technology at a given center. Level 1 evidence does not 
exist to show that one therapy is better than another. When 
all of these options are available at an institution, multiIntrahepatic

disciplinary management will help ensure an individualized 
approach for a patient, as clinical, biological, and anatomical 
considerations can be factored into the decision-making 
process.
Dose-escalation for cholangiocarcinoma
IHCC
Surgery is widely regarded as the only potentially curative 
option for patients with IHCC, but few patients with IHCC 
are candidates for radical resection (~10–15%) (11). Instead, 
patients with inoperable disease receive cisplatin plus 
gemcitabine, which showed improved overall survival (OS) 
compared to gemcitabine alone (12). 
Interest in using radiation therapy for IHCC dates back 
decades, but early studies were constrained to low doses 
and conventional fractionation due to normal tissue dose 
constraints. In the past 15 years, advances in radiation 
delivery, including intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT), proton therapy respiratory gating and CTimage guidance, contributed to the ability to safely deliver 
escalated doses of radiation (EDRT). These advances were 
utilized in Japan for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where 
hypofractionated proton therapy to escalated doses achieved 
5-year LC (90%) and OS (50%) rates similar to those after 
surgical resection for large tumors (10). A retrospective 
study of 79 patients treated with conventional and EDRT 
therapy for IHCC suggested a dose-response correlation. 
This study found that biological equivalent dose (BED) as 
a continuous variable significantly associated with LC and 
OS. Patients who received a BED of >80.5 Gy had a 73% 
3-year OS compared to 38% for those receiving lower doses 
(P=0.017). The higher radiation doses were linked with a 
lower rate of tumor-related liver failure, indicating that the 
higher BED treatments were a major contributor to the 
substantial prolongation of life that was observed (3). 
A follow-up study investigated outcomes of 362 
historical IHCC patients from 1997 to 2015 treated with 
either definitive radiation, resection, or chemotherapy (9). 
Clinicopathological characteristics, cause of death, diseasespecific survival (DSS), and intrahepatic progressionfree survival (IPFS) were compared between groups and 
within groups by era. This study found no significant 
improvement over time in IPFS or DSS for patients treated 
with definitive chemotherapy. Meanwhile IPFS improved 
from 50% to 75% and 48% to 64% for resection and 
radiation respectively. DSS too improved from 58% to 67% 
and 12% to 37% for resection and radiation respectively. 
Additionally, both forms of local therapy were associated 
with fewer liver related deaths for patients with IHCC 
(30% resection, 41% radiation, 72% chemotherapy). The 
improvement in IPFS and DSS for radiation was associated 
with EDRT. The focal delivery of higher radiation doses 
was hypothesized to confer a survival benefit similar to 
surgery because both therapies were associated with a lower 
likelihood of tumor-related liver failure, unlike systemic 
therapy. 
Prospective evaluation of EDRT delivered with protons 
was shown in a study of 44 patients with HCC, 37 patients 
with IHCC, and 2 patients with mixed HCC/IHCC. 
Patients received 15 fractions of radiation to a maximum of 
67.5 Gy equivalent. The 2-year LC for IHCC was 94.1% 
and the 2-year OS for IHCC was 46.5% (13). Encouraging 
results were also noted for HCC. This study led to 
two phase 3 randomized trials, NRG GI001 for IHCC

(hypofractionated radiation vs. observation after initial 
chemotherapy, NCT02200042) and NRG GI003 for HCC 
(protons vs. photons, NCT03186898). The NRG GI001 
was terminated due to lack of accrual, and the NRG GI003 
study is ongoing. 
An analysis of the National Cancer Database revealed 
that between the years 2004–2013, 401 out of 4,374 patients 
(9.2%) with IHCC were treated with radiation therapy (14). 
Patients who received radiation had longer median survival 
times, and receipt of radiation therapy was an independent 
predictor of prolonged survival in this large study of a 
contemporary cancer database. Notably, patients who lived 
in certain geographic areas and who received treatment 
at community centers were less likely to receive radiation. 
These results further emphasize the importance of LC in 
IHCC, the emerging role of radiation therapy in managing 
this disease, and the need to better educate physicians about 
how to deliver radiation at high doses.
EHCC
The results of EDRT in EHCC have not been as clearly 
favorable as those for IHCC. In 1990, a multi-center, 
retrospective study of patients with EHCC reported an 
improved median survival in patients receiving >40.0 Gy 
compared to those receiving ≤40.0 Gy (15). A retrospective 
analysis of 52 patients with unresectable EHCC treated 
between 1957 and 2000 at The University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center shed light on the limitations of 
conventional dosing in preventing local progression (16). 
Though the study was limited in its statistical power by its 
small patient number, it did suggest a possible association 
between increasing radiation dose and improved LC. 
However, in a recent study, we retrospectively analyzed 
a consecutive cohort of 80 patients treated with RT 
for unresectable EHCC between 2001 and 2015 (4). 
RT was given to doses of 30–75 Gy (median 50.4) for a 
biological equivalent dose (BED) of 36–98 Gy (median 
59.5). The cohort was split into an escalated-dose RT 
(EDRT) group (>50.4 Gy in 28 fractions, BED >59.5) 
and a conventional dose group (BED ≤59.5). The EDRT 
group did not demonstrate improved OS or freedom from 
local progression (FFLP). Further, EDRT was associated 
with worse freedom from distant progression and was also 
associated with the onset of grade 3 or higher lymphopenia, 
which has been shown to portend poor prognosis in other 
disease sites (17). All other toxicity rates were comparable. 
While dose-escalation has shown promising results in 
IHCC, these results suggest that higher doses do not 
provide the same LC and OS benefits in EHCC. The 
proximity of EHCC tumors to bowel limit the ability to 
completely cover the tumor with higher doses of radiation 
(Figure 3). 
The field still faces the challenge of achieving better 
LC for EHCC. Indeed, tumor-related complications are 
a significant driver of morbidity and mortality in patients 
with EHCC (4). There is a need to intensify treatment 
for EHCC, and new systemic agents, in combination with 
radiation, may provide a solution. 
Combining targeted therapy and radiation 
therapy
As EDRT for IHCC has shown promising LC and patients 
live longer, secondary patterns of regional and distant failure 
outside of the radiation fields have become apparent. Our

group presented an update to our experience with EDRT 
for IHCC, examining 63 patients with IHCC treated from 
2010 to 2016 with hypofractionated RT (Abu-Gheida, 
Koay et al., American Association for Clinical Oncology 
2019 Annual meeting abstract). This update showed good 
LC and OS rates (local-progression-free-survival of 67% 
and 2-year OS of 71%) and low toxicity rates. However, 
intrahepatic-distant-metastasis-free-survival (intrahepatic 
metastasis outside of the radiation field) and extrahepaticdistant-metastasis-free-survival were both 40%, indicating 
that systemic control remains a major challenge. 
Thus, there is strong rationale to combine systemic 
therapy with radiation therapy to achieve both distant and 
LC. In particular, the combination of targeted agents with 
EDRT represents an emerging opportunity for clinical 
research. Several molecular targets have been identified in 
recent years for cholangiocarcinoma, including tumors with 
fibroblast growth factor receptor genetic alterations (FGFR 
GAs), isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, and 
high microsatellite instability. 
FGFR
FGFR GAs appear to represent a unique subtype of IHCC,
occurring in 10% to 16% of IHCC cases. Patients with 
these genetic alterations appear to have a more indolent 
disease course and are generally younger than the patients 
without FGFR GAs (18). Javle and associates studied an 
orally bioavailable, selective pan-FGFR kinase inhibitor 
BGJ398 (infigratinib) in patients with FGFR2 fusions or 
other FGFR alterations whose disease had progressed 
while receiving prior therapy. The overall response rate 
was 14.8% and the disease control rate was 75.4%. The 
median progression free survival was 5.8 months (19). An 
ongoing phase 3 study for advanced cholangiocarcinoma 
with FGFR GAs is testing this drug in the frontline setting,
randomizing the patients to infigratinib versus gemcitabine/
cisplatin (NCT03773302). Other FGFR inhibitors,
including TAS-120, JNJ-42756493, AZD4547 are similarly 
being tested in clinical trials.
The mechanism of action for FGFR GAs has been a 
topic of great interest due to its role in cholangiocarcinoma 
as well as multiple other cancer types. Upon ligand binding,
the transmembrane protein dimerizes to trigger multiple 
downstream signalling pathways, including mitogen 
activated protein kinase, signal transducer and activator 
of transcription (STAT), and the phosphoinositide-3-
kinase (PI3K-Akt) pathway (20). Through these and 
other pathways, FGFR GAs are thought to contribute to 
oncogenesis through cell growth and survival, angiogenesis,
and resistance to therapy. Preclinical studies have shown 
radiosensitization with FGFR inhibition likely is dependent 
on the specific genetic alteration. Ahmed et al demonstrated 
that FGFR 4 contributes to radioresistance in colorectal 
cancer through reduction of RAD51 levels, thereby making 
HT29 colorectal cell lines resistant to radiation therapy.
Silencing of FGFR4 radiosensitized the HT29 cells by 
attenuation of double strand break repair by homologous 
recombination (21). Verstraete et al. investigated the ability 
of FGFR inhibition with JNJ-42756493 to radiosensitize 
colorectal xenograft models with wild type FGFR and 
FGFR2 amplification, but did not observe a radiosensitizing 
effect (22). There is no available data on FGFR inhibition 
and radiation therapy for IHCC, and it may be that only 
specific subsets of FGFR GAs benefit from a combination 
of FGFR inhibition and radiation. More basic and clinical 
research in this area is needed.
IDH1
IDH1 is mutated in about 25% of cholangiocarcinomas and 
has been tested in patients with a phase 1 dose-escalation 
study with AG-120. In a cohort of patients with mutated 
IDH1 cholangiocarcinoma, the partial response rate was 5% 
(4 out of 73 patients). The median PFS was 3.8 months and 
median OS was 13.8 months (23). Preliminary results of an 
ongoing phase 3 trial of AG-120 versus placebo in mutated 
IDH1 cholangiocarcinoma has been presented at ASCO 
(Lowery 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting) and has the primary 
endpoint of PFS.
Mutations in IDH1/2 occur in a hotspot of the 
catalytically active site of action for these enzymes,
resulting in production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG).
D-2HG competitively binds alpha-ketoglutarate, causing 
alterations in multiple downstream cellular processes like 
cell metabolism, DNA repair, redox states, and epigenetic 
regulation (24). Patients with IDH1/2 mutations have 
been shown to have improved responses to radiation in 
glioma (25,26). In preclinical studies, the silencing of 
wild type IDH1 has shown sensitization of cancer cells to 
chemotherapy and radiation, indicating that the targeting 
of wild type IDH1/2 cancers with pharmacologic inhibition 
may confer the same therapy responses seen in mutant 
IDH1/2 cancers. Indeed, this concept has been shown 
in preclinical studies (27,28). In the mutant IDH1/2 
population, targeted therapies may also be rationally

combined with radiation or chemotherapy to further 
sensitize the cancers to treatment. For example, mutated 
IDH1/2 cancers can have a “BRCAness” phenotype due to 
impaired homologous recombination DNA repair, that is 
partly attributed to inhibition of the alpha-ketoglutaratedependent dioxygenases [DNA damage response proteins 
lysine-specific demethylase 4A/B (KDM4A/B)], which 
induces the DNA repair defect. This has led researchers 
to investigate the use of poly ADP ribose polymerase 
(PARP) inhibitors in IDH 1/2-mutated cancers. Similarly,
studies have indicated that BCL2 and NAMPT may 
also be good targets in this subtype of cancer, including 
cholangiocarcinoma (24). More clinical investigation is 
warranted to determine how radiation can be combined 
with targeted agents for IDH 1/2, both in mutated and nonmutated situations.
MSI high
Around 1% of cholangiocarcinomas are thought to have 
high level microsatellite instability (29,30). At present, the 
data for checkpoint blockade in cholangiocarcinoma are 
limited. The initial report of the KEYNOTE-028 trial for 
PDL1-positive biliary tract cancers showed partial response 
in 4 of 24 patients (17%) and an additional 4 patients 
(17%) with stable disease (31). This led to a successor trial,
KEYNOTE-158, which included 104 patients with biliary 
tract cancers. The objective response rate for the patients 
with biliary tract cancers was only 5.8% in this study and 
17 patients (16%) had stable disease. Responses have also 
been documented in patients with mismatch repair deficient 
cholangiocarcinoma (32), with all 4 cholangiocarcinoma 
patients in a basket study of 86 with MMR-deficient tumors 
showing stable disease (n=3) or complete response (n=1).
Thus, checkpoint blockade may benefit a subset of patients 
with cholangiocarcinoma.
Several recently reported trials have described abscopal 
responses in patients who have received radiation therapy 
and immune checkpoint blockade. In unirradiated tumors 
on these trials, the abscopal response rates ranged from 
10–27% with another 13–23% having stable disease 
(33-35). In these trials, the responses in unirradiated tumors 
correlated with an increase in the peripheral CD8+ T cells,
peripheral immune cells, antibodies, and tumor-infiltrating 
cytotoxic T cells. Further research will be needed to 
maximize the anti-tumor effects of the immune system for 
cholangiocarcinoma and understand what role radiation 
may play in achieving this.
Future directions and summary
The goal of achieving LC of IHCC and EHCC stems from 
the fact that most patients with these diseases experience 
medical complications related to the primary tumor that 
can be life threatening, including biliary obstruction and 
vascular compromise. Controlling these tumors with liverdirected therapies like surgical resection, ablation, and 
radiation therapy can prolong life for patients. Giving 
EDRT using modern technologies has shown promise for 
IHCC, but the data for EHCC do not indicate the same 
benefit. These different results with EDRT in IHCC and 
EHCC are likely due in part to limitations of covering 
all EHCC tumors with high doses of radiation, owing to 
nearby bowel structures that are sensitive to high doses 
of radiation. Improved outcomes for patients in terms of 
LC will thus require new strategies, and targeted agents, 
particularly for FGFR gene aberrations, IDH1/2 mutations, 
and MSI-high, offer multiple avenues for clinical research 
with radiation therapy.
