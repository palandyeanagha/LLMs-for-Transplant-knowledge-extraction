Abstract
The present paper discusses the current literature with regard to substance-assisted psychotherapy with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive 
overview of the development from MDMA’s early application in psychotherapy to its present and future role in the treatment of PTSD. It is further attempted to increase the attention for MDMA’s therapeutic potential by providing a thorough 
depiction of the scientific evidence regarding its theorized mechanism of action and potential harms of its application in the 
clinical setting (e.g., misattribution of therapeutic gains to medication instead of psychological changes). Empirical support for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, including the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails that 
have been conducted since 2008, is discussed. Thus far, an overall remission rate of 66.2% and low rates of adverse effects 
have been found in the six phase two trials conducted in clinical settings with 105 blinded subjects with chronic PTSD. The 
results seem to support MDMA’s safe and effective use as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Even though preliminary studies 
may look promising, more studies of its application in a psychotherapeutic context are needed in order to establish MDMA 
as a potential adjunct to therapy.

Introduction
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma- and stressrelated disorder with close links to anxiety-, and dissociative-disorders. It is caused by exposure to a traumatic event 
that could result in serious injury or the loss of one’s life. 
Events that can be considered traumatic may further include 
being witness to or coming to know of close relatives or 
friends being affected by trauma events as well as being 
repeatedly confronted with aversive details of a traumatic 
incident. As a consequence, extreme psychological distress, 
recurring dreams of traumatic events and flashbacks are 
common symptoms experienced by patients suffering from 
PTSD (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Traumatic 
reminders may trigger prolonged and intense distress as well 
as physiological reactivity. Thus, external reminders and 
thoughts or feelings related to the trauma are often avoided. 
Further, negative changes in mood and cognition, and alterations in arousal and reactivity may be observed (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Lifetime prevalence of 
traumatic life events is estimated to revolve around 50–90% 
globally (Wittchen et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the estimated 
lifetime risk for PTSD reported by Kessler et al. (2005) 
revolves around 6–10%. Kilpatrick et al. (2013) estimated 
lifetime prevalence to amount to 8.3% in the United States 
using DSM-V criteria, with women being twice as likely to 
develop PTSD compared to men (Wittchen et al. 2009).
There is a variety of treatment options available, with psychotherapy being recognized as the most effective form of 
treatment for PTSD (Van Etten and Taylor 1998). Traumafocused therapies like Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Trauma-Focused 
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) constitute 
widely suggested first line treatments for PTSD (Benedeck

et al. 2009; Cloitre 2009). In a meta-analysis, Bradley et al. 
(2005) found different trauma-focused therapies to display 
equal efficacy for PTSD patients, with clinical improvement 
being evident in 44% of those entering treatment. In contrast, 
treatments that do not distinctly address processing of traumatic contents were found to be less effective in the reduction 
of PTSD symptoms (Flatten et al. 2011). A problematic issue 
psychotherapy has been dealing with is the high drop-out 
rates of around 30% (Cloitre 2009). These high dropout rates 
may be explained by the detrimental effects trauma exhibits 
on the patients’ ability to form trusting interpersonal relationships, subsequently affecting the working alliance between 
the patient and therapist (Doukas et al. 2014). Additionally, therapeutic effectiveness may be limited by the short 
period of optimal arousal (i.e., therapeutic threshold) displayed by many individuals with PTSD, further contributing 
to higher dropout rates. Interferences in autonomic arousal 
may restrain the process of reforming fear structures targeted 
by the psychotherapeutic treatment (Foa and Kozak 1986). 
These issues may explain findings showing that remission of 
symptoms after 40 months is only achieved in around 44% of 
those undergoing treatment (Morina et al. 2014).
Of those diagnosed with PTSD, about 20–30% respond to 
pharmacotherapy (Stein et al. 2009) with sertraline and paroxetine (Jeffreys 2009). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) were, as a class, found to have small effect sizes in 
PTSD symptom reduction (Hoskins et al. 2015) and are thus 
recommended as second-line treatment options (World Health 
Organization 2013). The use of benzodiazepines was found to 
negatively impact treatment outcomes in PTSD (Van Minnen 
et al. 2002). The need for future research into more effective 
agents for the treatment of PTSD was emphasized by several 
reviews of PTSD treatment studies (Foa et al. 2009; Stein 
et al. 2009). Currently existing treatment methods are ineffective for 25–50% of patients enrolled in clinical trials (Foa et al. 
2009; Stein et al. 2009; Mithoefer et al. 2011). As reported by 
the Guardian, more US soldiers died in 2012 by committing 
suicide than being killed in combat (Pilkington 2013) and the 
economic costs of PTSD and trauma- and stressor-related disorders are estimated to amount to 43.2 billion dollars annually 
(Greenberg et al. 1999). The necessity for more effective treatments efficiently reducing current treatment failure rates thus 
becomes apparent. A recently reintroduced psychopharmacological adjunct to psychotherapy yields promising results: 
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MMDA).
What is MDMA?
MDMA is a ring-substituted amphetamine with structural similarities to mescaline (Green et al. 2003). Even 
though traditionally regarded a psychedelic amphetamine, 
considerations have been made to classify MDMA as 
entactogen—establishing a unique class of drugs (Nichols 
and Oberlender 1990). It was first synthesized in 1912 and 
patented in 1914 (Benzenhöfer and Passie 2006), but its psychoactive properties in humans were not studied until 1978. 
In 1985 MDMA was emergency scheduled and categorized 
as a Schedule I drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) causing severe restriction of all clinical research. 
Subsequent illicit use, however, continued and increased 
(Sessa and Nutt 2007).
Positive cognitive effects of MDMA in a controlled clinical setting were described to include enhanced mood and 
well-being, happiness, relaxation (physical and mental), 
increased emotional sensitivity and responsiveness, heightened openness, extroversion and sociability, the feeling of 
closeness to other people, slight (visual, auditory, and tactile) changes in perception and exceptional anxiolysis (Harris 
et al. 2002; Vollenweider et al. 1998, 2002, 2005). Anxiolytic effects of MDMA comprise the feelings of immediate threat through the creation of a sense of detachment in 
patients rather than only diluting the very feeling of anxiety. 
Theoretically, this would allow for analytic reflection of past 
situations from different emotional perspectives (Schuldt 
2015). The effects of MDMA usually peak 2 h after admission and with elimination half-life revolving around 8 h (Cole 
and Sumnall 2003; Mithoefer et al. 2011), it coincides with 
average durations of substance-assisted treatment sessions 
(Mithoefer 2016). Most importantly, aforementioned pharmacological and subjective effects of MDMA have been consistently established across clinical settings (Kirkpatrick et al. 
2014). For a more thorough analysis of positive and negative 
effects as well as the physiological effects following MDMA 
induction in clinical settings, please resort to Schuldt (2015).
Why May MDMA be a Suitable Adjunct 
to Trauma Therapy?
Since the first paper on MDMA’s effects on humans was 
published in 1978 (Shulgin and Nichols 1978) and its prohibition in the United States in 1985, MDMA was amply 
applied as a catalyst in the psychotherapeutic process (Grinspoon and Bakalar 1986). Nevertheless, there appeared no 
systematic scientific literature on the early use of MDMA 
in clinical settings until the mid-1980s (Greer and Tolbert 
1986). Research regarding its potential for psychotherapy 
came to a halt after its illegalization. Only during the last 
decade therapeutic trials with subjects with psychiatric 
diagnoses have been re-approved and conducted again (see 
Bouso et al. 2008; Mithoefer et al. 2011; Oehen et al. 2013).
Approaching the current rationale for the application of 
MDMA in therapy from a psychotherapeutic perspective, its 
efficacy is hypothesized to result from its positive psychological effects. Positive outcomes in PTSD therapy show a

firm relationship with the strength of the therapeutic alliance (Charuvastra and Cloitre 2008), simultaneously, forming beneficial interpersonal relationships based on trust is 
often difficult for PTSD patients (Doukas et al. 2014). A 
small window of optimal arousal or therapeutic threshold, 
frequently producing distress and at times dissociation, is 
observed in many PTSD patients (Foa and Kozak 1986). 
Some of these challenges might be attenuated by MDMA, as 
the pharmacological effects of MDMA include an increase 
in the neurohormones oxytocin, prolactin and cortisol and in 
the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (Grob et al. 1996; 
Harris et al. 2002; Wolff et al. 2006; Nichols et al. 1982). 
Oxytocin is suggested to play a role in the accurate perception of emotion, affiliation and trust (Kirsch et al. 2005; Zak 
et al. 2005), highlighting its potential value in assisting with 
the formation of a therapeutic alliance. Thus, it might help to 
revisit traumatic experiences in a state of emotional engagement (Mithoefer et al. 2011). Elevated levels of oxytocin 
may improve social support and bonding (Olff 2012; Frijling 
et al. 2014), increase trust (Baumgartner et al. 2008), and 
decrease amygdala activation (Kirsch et al. 2005) outside the 
therapeutic context in those suffering from PTSD. Increases 
in emotional empathy and prosocial behavior (Hysek et al. 
2012) as well as a positive bias to socio-emotional stimuli 
(Kirkpatrick et al. 2014; Bedi et al. 2009) may also foster 
therapeutic progress. Since threatening interpretations are 
reinforced by negative emotional states (Mathews 2006), elevated levels of serotonin after MDMA ingestion may diminish this effect by increasing self-confidence and reducing 
feelings of anxiety and depression. Hence, this might help 
people to approach past experiences from different perspectives (Sessa 2011). According to the Emotional Processing 
Theory (EPT) of exposure therapy (Foa and Kozak 1986), 
fear reduction is achieved when information incompatible 
with the fear structure is incorporated. To do so, attending 
to threat is essential. MDMA may facilitate this very process. Negative cognitive effects in controlled clinical settings 
were observed to include disturbances of thought and difficulty concentrating, accelerated thinking, thought blocking, 
and impaired decision making (Vollenweider et al. 2002). 
In summary, these findings point to MDMA as a valuable 
catalyst disburdening cooperative engagement in therapy by 
strengthening the therapeutic alliance and by enhancing the 
identification of and response to emotional states.
Revisiting the trauma is often associated with intolerable negative feelings making confrontation extremely difficult. PTSD patients exhibit an attentional bias towards 
threat related stimuli, which correlates with amygdala 
activity. They also display increased reactivity to these 
stimuli (El Khoury-Malhame et  al. 2011). During a 
MDMA-assisted therapy session traumatic memories are, 
however, often experienced as less threatening and may 
thus facilitate reconsolidation of threatening memories 
(Doblin 2002). This may be explained by the positive correlation between decreased blood flow in the right amygdala and right hippocampus and the intensity of subjective 
effects of the experience (Carhart-Harris et al. 2015) and 
the observation that favorable autobiographical memories 
are perceived as more vivid and intense, while unfavorable 
memories are regarded as less negative and less distressing 
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). Bremner et al. (2005) found 
strong left amygdala activation, in participants with PTSD 
who underwent a conditioned fear paradigm, while the 
anterior cingulate cortex appeared deactivated. In comparison, decreased amygdala activation and increased anterior cortex activation was established in participants while 
reporting their worst memories after MDMA ingestion 
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). Again, it may be reasoned 
that the effects of MDMA on aforementioned brain areas 
foster memory reconsolidation. By what Amoroso (2015) 
describes as ‘mirror image of neural activation’, displayed 
in PTSD patients faced with fear after taking MDMA 
compared to those who confronted fear without having 
taken MDMA beforehand, imaging studies visualize possible changes in memory perception and perspective (for 
a detailed depiction of these changes see Sessa 2011). In 
addition, Gamma et al. (2000) evidenced increased cerebral blood flow in the occipital and ventromedial frontal 
cortex following MDMA administration. The neurocircuitry model of PTSD assumes absence of extinction of 
fear to be mediated by the ventral/media prefrontal cortex 
and the amygdala (Rauch et al. 2006). Besides, raised cortisol levels were found to enhance the extinction of fear in 
psychotherapy (Dominique et al. 2011). Taken together, 
the effects mentioned above might prevent the patient 
from feeling overwhelmed while confronting the trauma. 
Patients may still be able to access the memory of the traumatic event, even though feeling detached from the sense 
of imminent threat, which may facilitate reconsolidation 
of these memories.
Heightened amygdala activity is also associated with fearful and threat-related social stimuli (Whalen et al. 2001), and 
relatedly a study by Bedi et al. (2009) evidenced MDMA 
to reduce left amygdala activity in response to angry facial 
expressions. These findings may help to illuminate MDMA’s 
positive effects on social behavior and anxiety. Also, heightened activity in the ventral striatum, which is important for 
the processing of (socially) rewarding stimuli (Haber 2011), 
after attending to happy facial expressions was assessed in 
the same study. Collectively, these findings may provide 
further evidence for MDMA’s potential to improve the 
therapeutic relationship (Schuldt 2015). Ultimately, current 
evidence suggest that combined psychological, prosocial 
and anxiolytic effects of MDMA may contribute to trauma 
therapy.

Potential Harmful Effects Associated 
with the Application of MDMA 
in the Therapeutic Setting
The safety of MDMA is a rather controversial topic in 
the scientific literature as well as in the general public. 
In the therapeutic context acute adverse side effects may 
encompass nausea, vomiting, jaw clenching, muscle aches, 
feelings of numbness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, sweating and decreased appetite (Baylen and Rosenberg 2006). 
Detrimental effects on neurocognition include deficits in 
higher cognition and retrospective memory, depressive 
and confused thoughts, disturbed sleep and reduction of 
serotonin transporter levels in the cerebral cortex, amongst 
others (for an extensive review and debate see Parrott 
2013; Doblin et al. 2014; Multidisciplinary Association 
for Psychedelic Studies 2016). Nevertheless, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) assessed the benefit risk ratio 
to be acceptable for clinical studies of MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy (Doblin 2002). Arguably aforementioned 
harmful effects may not be generalizable to MDMAassisted psychotherapy for several reasons.
Firstly, MDMA and “Ecstasy” have been used interchangeably in the past. Whereas the former depicts the 
abbreviated version of a single chemical compound, references to “Ecstasy” often correspond to tablets containing 
MDMA alongside other components, e.g., 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone; Brunt et al. 2011), raising impurity issues (Spruit 2001). In order to appropriately assess 
the dangers of MDMA in the therapeutic context studies 
exploring the effect of high-quality product (Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP-MDMA), imperatively used in 
current trials, may be of higher validity. Additionally, it is 
important to highlight that environmental conditions commonly modulate the psychobiological effects of MDMA 
(Parrott 2004, 2006) further questioning the comparability 
of recreational and therapeutic use. It is thus debatable 
whether therapeutic doses of GMP-MDMA constitute significant risks for long term harmful effects, when administered in controlled environments (Vollenweider et al. 1999, 
2001). The controlled clinical trials conducted up to date 
report no persisting drug-related harm in over 850 participants (Doblin et al. 2014; Mithoefer et al. 2011, 2013). 
Therefore, the interchangeable use of the terms MDMA 
and ‘Ecstasy’ should be avoided in scientific literature 
regarding MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and more studies assessing long-term harmful effects of GMP-MDMA 
are needed.
Secondly, as coherently depicted by Amoroso (2015), 
most of the studies concerning the effects of MDMA on 
humans may not be generalizable to its application in therapy. Whereas a study by Schilt et al. (2008) investigated 
cognitive deficits in participants averaging a lifetime 
exposure of 327 tablets, it was reported that no more than 
20–30% of ecstasy users consumed more than 25 tablets 
in their entire lives (De Win et al. 2005). Moderate and 
heavy ecstasy-users only differ slightly on a battery of 
neurological test, but more so on measures of impulsivity 
and mental processing, possibly contributing to poly-drug 
use and neurocognitive deficits (Halpern et al. 2004). In 
addition, causation may not imperatively be implied by 
correlation (Aldrich 1995). It is generally complicated to 
control for poly-drug use, product purity and dose and 
underlying as well as preexisting mental disorders (Amoroso 2015). The possible involvement of confounding variables admonishes scientists to interpret those findings with 
caution (Lieb et al. 2002). Again, the extent to which such 
findings can be transferred to MDMA-assisted therapy 
remains questionable.
Thirdly, some of the misconceptions about MDMA may 
be due to flawed studies. A paper, later retracted from Science, claimed MDMA to cause severe dopaminergic neurotoxicity and subsequent death in primates (Ricautre et al. 
2002). Advertising campaigns portraying “Ecstasy” as a 
compound generating holes in brain tissue were supported 
by aforementioned government funded research (Schuldt 
2015). Upon critical responses questioning the validity of 
those findings (Mithoefer et al. 2003), it was found that the 
use of methamphetamine instead of MDMA caused the 
experimenters to obtain neurotoxic results.
Fourthly, MDMA’s adverse effects include tolerance and 
withdrawal symptoms (Degenhardt et al. 2010), but it does 
not seem to be linked to more serious adverse effects like 
suicidal tendencies that have been associated with paroxetine 
(Le Noury et al. 2015), which is currently used in the treatment of PTSD. Furthermore, the evidence for the dependence potential of MDMA seems limited. It should be kept 
in mind that these findings often refer to recreational use 
and may thus not be generalizable to studies investigating 
its therapeutic potential.
A potential concern in the use of MDMA as an adjunct 
to psychotherapy is the risk of patients misattributing therapeutic gains to medications minimizing the maintenance 
of improvements through psychological changes. As a 
consequence, the patients may be at higher risk of relapse, 
have more severe withdrawal symptoms and a greater loss 
of gains (Başoğlu et al. 1994). Preliminary evidence from 
follow-up studies to clinical trials with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, however, indicates that clinical and statistical 
increases in symptom relief may persist over time (Mithoefer 
et al. 2013; Oehen et al. 2013). In this regards, MDMA use 
in therapy might be different from other pharmacological 
interventions that are prescribed on a daily basis. Nevertheless, the risk of misattribution and subsequent reduction 
of positive effects acquired through psychological changes

deserves further investigation and should be considered for 
discussion with patients.
Eventually, these issues do not support inconsiderate 
use of MDMA or claim its use to be hazard-free, but rather 
underline the immediate need for more research directly 
examining its safe usage in the therapeutic context. Abuseoriented paradigms exhibit limited declarative value in 
salutogenetic, therapeutic contexts (Schuldt 2015). This 
is further exemplified by research on the neurotoxicity of 
amphetamine (common ADHD medication). Medication 
paradigms similar to therapeutic regimes evidence positive 
effects, whereas regimes resembling human abuse pattern 
reveal neurotoxic effects (Advokat 2007). In conclusion, the 
vast majority of research concerning “Ecstasy” appears to 
be inapplicable in order to establish the risks and potentials 
of the application of MDMA in clinical settings (Cole and 
Sumnall 2003; Krebs and Johansen 2012).
What Does MDMA‑Assisted Therapy Look 
Like?
The current treatment manual for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy proposes a mainly non-directive, patient-driven 
method by emphasizing empathetic presence and listening 
and non-directive communication. Its basic premise indicates that the interaction of the medicine, the therapeutic 
setting and the mindsets of participant and therapist compose the therapeutic effect. Detachment from the feeling of 
imminent threat while still being able to access traumatic 
memories may help to make engagement more comfortable 
and to confront the trauma without being overwhelmed. Further, an inherent feeling of safety is often noticeable, along 
with accelerated emotional processing. Despite appearing 
different from conventional treatments, MDMA-assisted 
therapy includes familiar elements from other models of 
therapy that are vital for its effectiveness: Exposure therapy, 
therapeutic alliance, anxiety management training, stress 
inoculation training, cognitive restructuring and transference and countertransference and individual therapists are 
encouraged to include therapeutic interventions based on 
their own experience, intuition, training and clinical judgment (Mithoefer 2013, 2016). The manual was created and 
implemented by the non-profit Multidisciplinary Association 
for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in the pursuit of approving 
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a therapeutic intervention 
until 2021 (Emerson et al. 2014).
Including two to three substance-assisted sessions, 
the treatment is usually comprised of 15 therapy sessions overall. The sessions can be subdivided into three 
stages: A preparatory stage (usually consisting of three 
90-min sessions), followed by one substance-assisted 
session (including an overnight stay at the facility), succeeded by an integration stage (of several sessions). Systematic trauma exploration does not take place until the 
first substance-assisted session. The sessions with MDMA 
assistance take place 2–6 weeks apart and each one lasts 
around 6–8 h. Currently, 125 mg of MDMA is regarded a 
full dose. Typically, patients rest in a lying position while 
one therapist sits on each side of them. Therapist teams are 
composed of one male and one female therapist in order to 
allow for parental transference to emerge. Trauma exposure 
is done using a non-directive and patient-driven approach. 
Normally, the contents of the trauma erupt spontaneously 
while the therapists encourage patients to revisit and reprocess the most distressing contents. The patients may be animated to reflect on, validate and verbalize their experiences 
in later parts of the sessions when peak effects of MDMA 
lessen. Alternations between episodes of communication 
and episodes of introspection, during which patients may 
listen to a standardized set of music and have the option to 
wear eyeshades, are dependent on the individual process. 
Subsequent integrative sessions serve the purpose of supporting patients in the long-term integration process by 
applying insights to daily life. A detailed depiction of the 
treatment can be found in the MAPS treatment manual for 
MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD (Mithoefer 2016).
Therapist training in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy 
has been recommended. In general, therapists are suggested to have strong empathic presence, to be client oriented and to have a solid background in therapy for PTSD 
(e.g., Cognitive Processing, PE, EMDR or psychodynamic 
psychotherapy). Furthermore, it is advised that the setting 
of the treatment should appear like a comfortable living 
room (for information about the importance of set and setting see Shewan et al. 2000). Nevertheless, Basic Cardiac 
Life Support (BCLS) is readily available and Advanced 
Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) can be summoned in an 
adequate time frame (Mithoefer 2016).
Even though the theoretical framework for substanceassisted treatment for PTSD appears to be convincing and 
preliminary results seem to be promising, more empirical 
evidence and independent replications are needed until 
definite conclusions may be drawn. Mithoefer (2013) outlined the differences between MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and other psychotherapy and thereby highlighted that 
as of yet, clinical studies assessed safety and effectiveness 
instead of therapeutic mechanisms. The mechanisms of 
actions are still of speculative nature and have to be verified by carefully designed studies. The existing studies will 
be critically discussed in the subsequent section.

What Can Clinical Trials Tell Us so Far?
The first government sanctioned MDMA-assisted psychotherapy study was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial which found preliminary evidence for the 
physiologically and psychologically safe application of 
MDMA in the psychotherapeutic context. Compared to 
placebo MDMA led to reduction of PTSD symptoms in 
chronic, treatment resistant PTSD patients. However, the 
sample size was too small (n=6) for firm conclusions to 
be drawn (Bouso et al. 2008).
The first study in the United States followed a few years 
later. Mithoefer et al. (2011) used a randomized, doubleblind, inactive placebo-controlled design and managed 
to include 20 participants with chronic, treatment resistant PTSD in their study. The first stage of the experiment 
involved participants being randomly assigned to receiving either a placebo or a full dose of MDMA (125 mg 
with the possibility of a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg 2 
h later), during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparation and integration 
sessions of psychotherapy. During the second stage, the 
participants in the placebo group were given the opportunity to take part in an open-label crossover part of the 
study, receiving a full dose of MDMA as well. No serious 
adverse effects were found to occur during the study. Further, reported scores on the Clinician-Administered PTSD 
Scale (CAPS) were significantly reduced subsequent to the 
MDMA-assisted intervention. The rate of clinical response 
was 83% in the active treatment group compared to 25% 
in the placebo group. Nevertheless, the double-blinding 
did not work as intended since both the researchers and 
the participants could successfully tell whether MDMA or 
a placebo had been administered. Mithoefer et al. (2013) 
readministered the CAPS and several additional tests to 
16 of the original participants in a follow-up to their initial study, between 17 and 74 month after the completion 
of their ultimate MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. 
While two participants relapsed, the remainder maintained 
significant clinical and statistical increases in symptom 
relief displaying the effect of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to be persistent over time. None of the subjects 
associated any harm with their participation in the study.
The most recent study establishing the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was the first one 
to include active placebo control into the randomized, 
double-blind study design (Oehen et al. 2013). In the 
first stage of the study the 12 participants were randomly 
enrolled into either an active control group receiving a 
low dose of MDMA (25 mg, with a supplemental dose 
of 12.5 mg) or the treatment group ingesting a full dose 
of MDMA (125 mg, plus a 62.5 mg supplemental dose). 
Again, the blinding was broken in the second stage of 
the study enabling participants to partake in a full dose 
MDMA-session in an open-label crossover section. Those 
who showed an inadequate clinical response to the full 
dose of MDMA had the opportunity to participate in two 
further sessions with higher doses (150 mg, with a 75 mg 
supplemental dose) in a third stage of the study. Subjects 
participated in either two or three substance-assisted sessions, with researchers reporting three sessions to exhibit 
significantly superior effects than two sessions. Although, 
no significant reductions in CAPS scores were found, 
improvements could be evidenced in the German version 
of the Posttraumatic-Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Results at 
1-year follow up reported a 36% decrease in CAPS scores 
compared to their initial scores in those who received a 
full dose of MDMA in the first stage. The CAPS score of 
those who received MDMA in the second stage dropped 
by 52%. Since PTSD patients generally recover over time 
and all subjects were provided the opportunity to take part 
in MDMA-assisted session eventually, recovery may have 
been natural. The effect size for secondary outcome measures was not reported by Oehen et al. (2013). Later, others 
found it to be quite large (Hedges’ g=0.97; Chabrol and 
Oehen 2013).
At present, only three therapeutic phase-two trials have 
been completed and published, while multiple others are 
currently ongoing or being prepared. An intention-to-treat 
(ITT) analysis of safety and primary efficacy data from six 
phase two trials with 105 blinded subjects shows promising 
results and low rates of adverse effects. Overall, a remission rate of 66.2% and an average drop of 47.7 points on 
the CAPS were evidenced (see Emerson 2016). Furthermore, a preliminary meta-analysis comparing the effects of 
PE therapy with those of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy 
displays promising results in favor of the latter. MDMAassisted psychotherapy appeared to have larger effect sizes 
than PE therapy in clinician-observed outcomes as well as in 
patient self-report outcomes (Amoroso and Workman 2016).
What is the Future Perspective 
of MDMA‑Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD?
Despite those phase-two trials already discussed, there are 
multiple others that are currently being conducted examining MDMA’s significance with regard to the treatment of 
MDMA-assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy 
(CBCT) for chronic PTSD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT02876172), its value for social anxiety in autistic 
adults (Danforth et al. 2016) and anxiety associated with 
life-threatening illnesses (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02427568).

Recently, the first clinical phase-three trial for MDMAassisted psychotherapy in PTSD was approved by the FDA 
(Philipps 2016), allowing for a broader collection of data 
with more participants in order to strengthen the scientific 
evidence. Moreover, the FDA has grated breakthrough 
therapy designation for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for 
PTSD (Wan 2017). So far, the Bouso et al. (2008) and the 
Mithoefer et al. (2011) studies were both entirely funded 
by MAPS. The association participated in the design and 
data analysis of the Mithoefer et al. (2011) study. Further 
MAPS partially funded the Oehen et al. (2013) study and 
helped to monitor and design it. This one-sided involvement 
in research provoked some people to question their objectivity (Sepkowitz 2012). Even though independent funding has 
been difficult to obtain, more research is warranted, preferable with other independent research teams involved to 
expand the validity and reliability of research findings.
In summary, preliminary results regarding MDMAassisted psychotherapy for PTSD look promising and warrant further investigation. If future phase-three trials may 
indeed replicate these findings implication of an efficient 
adjunct to psychotherapy is indispensible. MDMA may 
provide a bridge to effectively overcome the gap between 
psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, thereby facilitating 
the integration of a more holistic approach to psychopathology (Schuldt 2015).
