Abstract
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a disease characterized by tumorous lesions consisting of
myofibroblastic spindle cells and inflammatory cells that occur primarily in the soft tissues and viscera of
children and young adults. Total excision is the most effective therapy. Steroids have been used to treat unresectable lesions with some success. We herein report a case of IMT involving the frontal bone accompanied
by pachymeningitis. The tumor was characterized by an aggressive clinical course that was refractory to
prednisolone. Performing total excision seemed difficult. Celecoxib and methotrexate were effective treatments. Our experience suggests the efficacy of celecoxib and methotrexate as alternatives for treating unresectable IMT.

Introduction
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare disease characterized by tumorous lesions consisting of myofibroblastic spindle cells and inflammatory cells that occur
primarily in the soft tissues and viscera of children and
young adults. IMT can affect any part of the body, although
it is most commonly seen in the lungs, mesentery and
omentum and usually follows a benign clinical course. IMT
of the head and neck is rare, accounting for fewer than 5%
of all extrapulmonary cases. The most common location is
the orbit followed by the meninges, paranasal sinuses, infratemporal fossa and soft tissues. Our review of the literature revealed only 60 reported cases of IMT affecting the
cranial bone (1-5). IMT has been described under many different names, including inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT)
and plasma cell granuloma, highlighting the complexity and
variable histological characteristics of these tumors. These
lesions were once thought to be reactive in nature but have
come to be considered true soft tissue neoplasms that can
relapse, be multifocal and metastasize to distant sites.
Making a diagnosis of IMT requires a histopathological
examination because the radiological and clinical findings
are generally nonspecific. There is a consensus that total
surgical excision is the most effective therapeutic option in
cases in which the tumors are surgically accessible. Steroid
therapy has been used with some success in patients with
surgically unresectable lesions. Other medical treatment options, however, are limited, including radiotherapy and/or
adjuvant chemotherapy and treatment with immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs. Methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, vinca alkaloids, cyclosporine and azathioprine
have been used; however, the response is variable and often
poor (6-9).
We herein present the case of a patient with IMT of the
frontal bone whose lesion, despite showing a limited response to high-dose methylprednisolone therapy followed by

markedly shrank following the additional administration of a
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, celecoxib and methotrexate (MTX) therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of a case of IMT that showed a limited response to steroid monotherapy alone but was treated successfully with a combination of steroids, MTX and a COX-2
inhibitor.
Case Report
A 64-year-old woman was admitted with progressively
worsening vision in the right eye that had developed over
the previous one month along with one episode of a tonic
seizure. Four years before admission, she had undergone
complete resection of an IMT of the right femur.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed
dural enhancement and thickening, and the frontal lobe was
edematous (Fig. 1A, B). MRI also revealed a mass in the
maxillary sinuses. A biopsy of the nasal cavity mucosa disclosed a nonspecific chronic inflammatory reaction. Special
stains for bacteria, fungi and acid-fast organisms revealed
negative findings. An immunohistochemical analysis of
plasma cells and lymphocytes revealed the presence of both
kappa- and lambda-type light chains, demonstrating the
polyclonal nature of the plasma cells. Various examinations
were conducted; however, no infectious or autoimmune diseases or hematological disorders were detected. The patient
was diagnosed as having idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP). Following the administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg/d, administered intravenously for three days), the patient’s clinical symptoms and
neuroradiological findings improved. She was kept on oral
steroid therapy (40 mg of prednisolone per day) with gradual dose tapering.
The patient was admitted to the Department of Otolaryngology three years later for an evaluation of a nodule in her
forehead that had been present for the past two months. She
had no fever, fatigue or weight loss. A neurological examination revealed horizontal gaze nystagmus, hyperreflexia of
the four limbs, dysesthesia of the bilateral toes, bilateral
anosmia and conductive hearing loss in her left ear, which

were all previously detected without additional neurological
deficits. Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA), myeloperoxidase ANCA (P-ANCA), anti-Sjögren syndrome A (SS-A)
antibodies, anti-SS-B antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), beta-D glucan, soluble interleukin-2 receptor
and immunoglobulin G4 were negative. MRI revealed an enhanced soft-tissue mass of the forehead with erosion of the
frontal bone and dural thickening (Fig. 1C, D). A biopsy
was performed, and a histopathological analysis of the obtained biopsy specimen revealed spindle cells without cellular atypism and marked infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma
cells and neutrophils (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining demonstrated that the spindle cells were positive for α-smooth
muscle actin (Fig. 2B) and vimentin. On the basis of these
findings, a histopathological diagnosis of IMT was made.
The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression was
negative, and the ratio of IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cells was not
elevated. The dural thickening (typically seen in patients
with IHP) seemed to be due to the lesions accompanying
the IMT. Because performing complete resection was difficult and rapid growth of the tumor was observed, high-dose
steroid therapy was chosen to treat the patient. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was administered followed by oral
prednisolone at a dose of 45 mg daily. Seven weeks later,
despite the fact that the patient was still on prednisolone, a
computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated that the tumor had further markedly increased in size (Fig. 3A-C).
Two additional courses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy
were administered, and the tumor growth appeared to stop.
The third course was started followed by treatment with
MTX (6 mg/week) and celecoxib (200 mg/d) in addition to
oral prednisolone (45 mg/d). Two weeks later, marked
shrinkage of the tumor was achieved (Fig. 3D). The patient
was kept on oral prednisolone (45 mg/d) for 11 weeks, and
the prednisolone dose was then gradually tapered down to
20 mg/d after four months. In the six months of follow-up
after the patient’s discharge, there has been no radiological
evidence of any tumor progression or recurrence.
Discussion
In the present case, various examinations were conducted;
however, no infectious or autoimmune diseases or hematological disorders were detected. On the patient’s first admission, the tumor in the maxillary sinus and the dural thickening showed a marked improvement following the administration of methylprednisone pulse therapy. An immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsy specimen of the mass in
the frontal bone, which developed three years later, showed
spindle-shaped cells that were strongly positive for smooth
muscle actin and vimentin. These findings favor a diagnosis
of IMT (or inflammatory pseudotumor). Although the ALK
expression was negative, this does not necessarily exclude a
diagnosis of IMT because immunohistochemical positivity
for ALK is observed in only approximately 50% of cases of
IMT, more frequently in pediatric than adult patients.
It was difficult to consider the tumors of the paranasal sinuses to be distant metastatic lesions originating from the
femur. Our patient showed no pathological evidence of malignancy. In addition, distant metastasis of IMT is rare, occurring in <5% of cases, and metastatic disease is usually
identified on presentation or within a year of diagnosis (10).
However, the rapid dissemination to the paranasal sinuses
and the frontal bone suggests the malignant nature of the
disease. Our patient showed no pathological evidence of malignancy, although the clinical course was atypical for a benign tumor.
In our case, it is unclear whether the dural thickening was
caused by IMT or HP. There are cases of HP resulting from
IMT of the retropharynx or temporal bone (11), and some
reports suggest that IMT and HP are part of a spectrum of
disorders that have similar histopathologic findings (1). In
such cases, it is unclear whether the dural thickening is due
to direct spread of the tumor or inflammatory changes developing secondary to the tumor lesions because IMT occurring in the central nervous system is often dura-based.
It is difficult to determine the individual efficacies of the
COX-2 inhibitor and MTX in our case because both drugs
were administered simultaneously. There are case reports of
IMT being successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors (Table) (11-19). Furthermore, we found several cases of IMT
that were successfully treated with NSAIDs or a COX-2 inhibitor without the use of any surgery or any other medications.
The rationale for the use of NSAIDs in patients with IMT
was demonstrated by Applebaum et al. (20), who convincingly presented evidence of the presence of mediators of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
COX-2 that may play important roles in the growth of IMT.
Niederberger et al. showed that COX-2 is expressed in activated endothelial cells and that COX-2 inhibition can directly suppress the growth of these cells, suggesting a possible role of COX-2 in endothelial regulation (21). Therefore,
there are three possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic role of COX-2 inhibitors in IMT: (1) an antiangiogenic effect occurring via VEGF downregulation, (2) suppression of COX-2-mediated endothelial proliferation, and
(3) anticytokine suppression of the inflammatory process (20). In our patient, celecoxib and MTX markedly
shrank the tumor, while steroid monotherapy showed partial
effects of preventing tumor growth. Therefore, it is possible
that the antiangiogenic actions of the COX-2 inhibitor were
more effective for treating the IMT than the steroids and
that celecoxib was responsible for the rather favorable response observed in our patient.
On the other hand, in our case, MTX was administered
concomitantly with the COX-2 inhibitor. The role of MTX
is, however, not clear. The tumor markedly decreased in
size, as demonstrated on CT performed two weeks after the
additional administration of MTX, although one or two
months are generally needed until the peak efficacy of MTX
is achieved. In addition, although various regimens, including those with MTX, that is MTX plus vincristine, MTX
plus vinblastine and MTX plus cisplatin/adriamycin, have
been described in the literature, there are no reports suggesting the efficacy of MTX monotherapy for IMT (6-9).
Some reports indicate that the combination of MTX with
celecoxib enhances MTX-related effects (8); however, administering the two drugs at conventional clinical doses does
not alter the pharmacokinetics of MTX because the concentration of serum MTX does not reach the inhibition constant
(Ki) value. On the other hand, several authors have provided
evidence that COX-2 inhibitors are considerably more effective when administered in combination with a secondary
treatment regimen (22), which raises the possibility that
COX-2 inhibitors can be more effective when administered
in combination with MTX. In our case, therefore, the use of
the COX-2 inhibitor alone or administered in combination
with MTX was presumably effective in decreasing the size
of the tumor.
