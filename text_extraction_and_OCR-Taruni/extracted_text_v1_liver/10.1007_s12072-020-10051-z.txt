Abstract
Background The clinical characteristics and disease course in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis has not been described so far.
Methods In this case series, we report three patients with confrmed COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis 
from three hospitals in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak in China.
Result Patient 1 was a 53-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Though 
receiving intensive support, he died of irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 48 days after the onset of the illness. 
Patient 2 was a 75-year-old woman with a history of schistosomiasis-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Her 
family members requested that invasive rescue measures not be undertaken, and she died of acute respiratory distress syndrome 40 days after presenting with COVID-19 infection. Patient 3 was an 87-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis, 
portal hypertension, and esophageal variceal hemorrhage. He was discharged from the hospital 29 days after illness onset.
Conclusion The case series raise the possibility that decompensated cirrhosis may be a risk factor for a poor outcome in 
patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
The rapidly expanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic has had a major impact on the medical care 
of many individuals throughout the world [1, 2]. Previous 
studies have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 
disease have abnormal aminotransferase levels, which raise 
the possibility of signifcant COVID-19-induced liver injury 
[3, 4]. This clinical challenge is even prominent in patients 
with COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis – in particular, considering their immunocompromised 
status and worse clinical outcomes than compensated cirrhosis [4, 5]. Acute exacerbation of liver function has been 
described in decompensated cirrhosis clinical guidelines, 
although the efects of COVID-19 are not well defned [5, 
6]. Since the clinical characteristics and disease course in 
COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis are incompletely defned, in an efort to better understand 
this clinical scenario, we herein report three cases of patients 
with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing 
decompensated cirrhosis from three hospitals in Hubei, the 
epicenter of the outbreak in China.
Case series
A case of COVID-19 was defned as a confrmed positive 
after one of the following results: (1) demonstration of the 
presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high-throughput sequencing from 
nasopharyngeal swab specimens, (2) a positive real-time

reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay from 
nasopharyngeal swab specimens, or (3) the demonstration of 
SARS-CoV-2 specifc IgM and IgG in serum [1–3]. Decompensated cirrhosis was defned as clinically or histologically 
diagnosed cirrhosis with a history of at least one decompensating event, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and/or 
variceal hemorrhage.
Clinical characteristics and laboratory 
results at admission
Patient 1
A 53-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis 
(Child–Pugh class C; Model for End-stage Liver Disease 
[MELD] score, 15) was diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis after presenting with ascites previously and has been 
treated with entecavir. He experienced his frst symptoms 
(fever, cough, sputum, dizziness, and myalgia) on 22 January 2020 after coming back from Wuhan (Hubei, China), 
and was admitted to the hospital on 25 January 2020 with 
pneumonia diagnosed by chest CT imaging. The diagnosis 
of COVID-19 was confrmed on 28 January 2020. Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis, lymphopenia 
and thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia and prolonged prothrombin time (Table 1). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 
were in the normal range; and aspartate transaminase (AST) 
and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were slightly 
elevated (Table 1). Chest CT showed bilateral ground-glass 
opacities, typical of pulmonary COVID-19 infection.
Patient 2
A 75-year-old woman with a 5-year history of cirrhosis 
(Child–Pugh class C; MELD score, 14) due to schistosomiasis and was diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis approximately 6 months previously after presenting with ascites. 
She was admitted to the hospital on 12 March 2020 after 
30 days of intermittent fever after coming back from Wuhan 
(Hubei, China); and was confrmed with COVID-19 on 12 
March 2020. Laboratory results at admission revealed leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia (Table 1). In 
addition, ALT and AST levels were both minimally elevated 
and GGT and ALP levels were elevated (Table 1). Chest CT 
scan revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lung, typical 
of pulmonary COVID-19 infection.
Patient 3
An 87-year-old man with a 7-year history of alcoholrelated cirrhosis (Child–Pugh class, B; MELD score, 23) 
was diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis approximately 
7 years previously after presenting with variceal hemorrhage. He reported a close contact with sick persons several 
days before he developed cough, white frothy sputum, diarrhea and fever. He was confrmed to have COVID-19 and 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 11 February 
2020. Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis, 
lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, 
hypoproteinemia and prolonged prothrombin time (Table 1). 
ALT level was normal, while AST and GGT levels were 
slightly elevated. Chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass 
opacities and large bilateral pleural efusions.
Treatment, complications and outcomes
Patients 1 and 2 deteriorated clinically on 2 February 2020 
(day 12 from the onset of the illness) and 20 March 2020 
(day 38 from the onset of the illness), respectively, and 
were transferred to the ICU (Table 2). All patients were 
given antiviral therapy (patient 1: lopinavir plus ritonavir 
orlly [400 mg/100 mg, BID] combined with inhalation of 
interferon alfa-2b [500 wu, BID]; patient 2: arbidol orally 
[200 mg, TID]; patient 3: lopinavir plus ritonavir orally 
[400  mg/100  mg, BID] combined with arbidol orally 
[200 mg, TID] and with a switch to inhalation of interferon 
alfa-2b [500 wu, BID] because of an ongoing increase in 
bilirubin). In addition, all patients received liver protective 
drugs (glutathione-based therapy), broad spectrum antibiotics, systemic glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin 
therapy and intravenous blood products, such as plasma, 
albumin and cryoprecipitate. During hospitalization, all 
developed ascites and patients 1 and 2 developed pleural 
efusions. Therapeutic paracentesis was performed in all 
patients, as well as therapeutic thoracentesis in patient 1. 
Patient 1 and 3 developed melena and were treated with 
a proton pump inhibitor, somatostatin, and red blood cell 
transfusion to a target hemoglobin level of 8 mg/dL.
Patient 1 required endotracheal intubation and developed 
acute kidney injury, requiring continuous renal replacement 
therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. He 
developed progressive acute-on-chronic liver failure, and 
died of irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
on 10 March 2020 (day 48 from the onset of the illness). 
Patient 2 and her family members requested that invasive 
rescue measures not be undertaken, and she died of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome on 22 March 2020 (day 40 
from the onset of the illness). Patient 3 was discharged from 
the hospital on 11 March 2020 (day 29 from the onset of 
the illness) after the results of two real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction tests (nasopharyngeal 
swabs) taken 24 h apart were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
Given that cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of death and 
illness globally [7], understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection infuences the clinical course in this setting is important. In this study, we report for the frst time the clinical 
characteristics of three COVID-19 patients with pre-existing 
decompensated cirrhosis. Two patients with Child–Pugh C 
class disease died, while the patient with Child–Pugh Class 
B did not. Furthermore, the patient with the highest MELD 
score survived, while the ones with lower MELD scores did 
not. This raises the possibility that clinical decompensating events may be more important in predicting outcome of 
patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis.
COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated 
cirrhosis seem to have a higher complication and mortality 
rate than those with COVID-19 alone [1–3]. In this study, 
all patients were admitted to the ICU and two of them died 
during hospitalization. A possible explanation for this might 
be the poorer immune function in patents with decompensated cirrhosis, since immunodefciency is more prominent 
as the disease progresses [8]. Our data were consistent with 
previous work suggesting that patients with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome and cirrhosis, regardless of the disease 
stage, had worse outcomes than patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome without cirrhosis [9].
We were surprised by the outcome of patient 3, who was 
considerably older than the other patients reported. However, he may have had better liver function than patients 1 
and 2, given his lower Child–Pugh class and international 
normalized ratio. On the other hand, he had chronic kidney 
disease, which could be another risk factor for an adverse 
outcome of COVID-19. We recommend that for COVID-19 
patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis, while 
following the management principles of COVID-19, adequate nutritional support and proactive treatment to prevent 
decompensating events of liver cirrhosis are important.
We recognize that this study is limited by the small 
sample size. However, the death of 2 patients is notable. We expect that further studies with larger samples 
(COVID-Cirrhosis-CHESS, NCT04329559) will shed 
light on the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with 
pre-existing cirrhosis.
In conclusion, we report here on the clinical course of 
COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis. The data suggest that in patients with COVID-19, 
decompensated cirrhosis might be considered as a risk 
factor for a poor outcome.
