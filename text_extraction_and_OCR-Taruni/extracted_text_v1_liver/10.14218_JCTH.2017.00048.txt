Abstract
Despite significant improvements in outcomes after liver transplantation, many patients continue to die on the waiting list,
while awaiting an available organ for transplantation. Organ
shortage is not only due to an inadequate number of available
organs, but also the inability to adequately assess and evaluate
these organs prior to transplantation. Over the last few
decades, ex-vivo perfusion of the liver has emerged as a
useful technique for both improved organ preservation and
assessment of organs prior to transplantation. Large animal
studies have shown the superiority of ex-vivo perfusion over
cold static storage. However, these studies have not, necessarily, been translatable to human livers. Small animal studies
have been essential in understanding and improving this technology. Similarly, these results have yet to be translated into
clinical use. A few Phase 1 clinical trials have shown promise
and confirmed the viability of this technology. However, more
robust studies are needed before ex-vivo liver perfusion can be
widely accepted as the new clinical standard of organ preservation. Here, we aimed to review all relevant large and small
animal research, as well as human liver studies on normothermic ex-vivo perfusion, and to identify areas of deficiency and
opportunities for future research endeavors.

Introduction
Despite significant improvements in graft and patient survival
rates, there is still a large discrepancy between the available
organs for transplant and the number of candidates on the
waiting list for transplant. In the United States, in 2016, there
were 14,432 patients listed for liver transplantation and 7,841
liver transplants preformed, leaving 6,591 patients without
available organs for transplantation.1 Unfortunately, the
number of deceased organ donors appears to have reached
a plateau.1–4 As such, over the past three decades, many
centers have pursued several different methods to increase
the available donor pool for transplantation.
One such area involves increasing the use of marginal
donor organs. While most donor organs can generally tolerate
variable durations of static cold storage (SCS), and its associated ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), marginal organs have
been known to do poorly under such circumstances.5–7 This
has led to renewed interest in techniques that would improve
the quality of donor organ preservation and, thus, improve the
suitability of marginal donor organs for transplantation. The
concept of machine perfusion was introduced by Alexis Carrel
and Charles Lindberg in 1935, in their work “The Culture of
Organs”,
8 and later expanded upon by Belzer,9 who also was
a pioneer in hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP).
Hypothermic ex-vivo perfusion of the kidney produced
impressive results and resulted in increases in the number
of organs available for transplantation. Similar advances
have not translated to liver transplantation, however, where
SCS remains the prominent preservation modality outside of
clinical trials. Unlike kidneys, livers have a much higher metabolic activity and tolerate prolonged ischemia poorly. With
their high metabolic demand, donor livers have been more
challenging to perfuse and sustain under normothermic conditions. Research into normothermic ex-vivo perfusion has
continued over the last five decades. With advancements in
the perfusion technology and the understanding of organ
physiology, it has seen renewed interest as a platform to preserve, assess and potentially repair marginal donor organs.10
There are a number of devices currently in clinical use for
this procedure, including the Organ Assist’s Liver Assist (with
an adjustable temperature range from 108
–388 C; for performance of hypothermic and normothermic perfusion),11 the
OrganOx Metra (normothermic perfusion)12 and the Transmedics OCSTM Liver Portable Perfusion System (normothermic perfusion).13 Overall, these systems consist of a hepatic
artery +/− portal vein pump, a perfusate reservoir and an
oxygenating chamber of oxygenated perfusion (Fig. 1).
Although there is ongoing debate over the best preservation/perfusion temperature, normothermic (liver) machine
perfusion (NMP or normothermic machine liver perfusion)
appears to be gaining more traction and acceptance, compared
to subnormothermic perfusion and hypothermic machine
perfusion (HMP). It is, thus, likely to become the standard of
ex-vivo machine perfusion. Regardless of approach, it has

become evident that ex-vivo perfusion holds the highest
potential to increase the number of organs available for
transplantation by expanding the donor pool. We sought to
review the progress made in NMP, as well as to explore opportunities for future research.
Pre-clinical studies
Large animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies
Early in the history of liver transplantation, the impact of graft
ischemia on outcomes had become evident. In a first attempt at
machine perfusion of the liver, Slapak et al.14 adapted the
Debakey roller pump used in cardiac surgery into an apparatus
for in-situ liver perfusion of the donor organ for transplantation.
These initial perfusions lasted for about 8 h, and were done
under hypothermic conditions, given the success of hypothermic
machine perfusion of the kidney.14,15 The development of the
University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and its success in organ
SCS, led to temporary abandonment of machine perfusion.
Despite the successes of the UW solution in cold storage,
however, there was growing concern that SCS was not the
ideal preservation method for liver grafts. Although, normothermic (regional) perfusion had been introduced by Otto
et al.16 in 1958, and later by Liem et al.17 as a treatment
alternative for acute liver failure, normothermic ex-vivo perfusion did not enter the experimental scene until much later.
The discovery and success of cyclosporine resulted in a significant increase in the number of organs being transplanted.
With this success, however, came the issue of organ shortage.
While most ideal livers tolerated SCS well, marginal livers
did not. Unfortunately, there was no good way to assess the
organ quality prior to transplantation. As such, there was
renewed interest in ex-vivo perfusion as a modality for organ
evaluation and preservation. One of the earliest experiments in
normothermic ex-vivo liver perfusion was performed by Ikeda
et al.18 in 1990, in which six porcine livers previously stored for
24 hours at 48
C with the UW solution underwent 3 h of sanguineous perfusion either at 328
C or 378C. These organs were
compared to six other porcine livers perfused at 378
C immediately following procurement. The latter group had better portal
and hepatic artery pressures as well as bile production compared to both groups that underwent 24 h of cold storage.18
Experiments on liver perfusion have equally been driven by
the desire to optimize donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers
prior to transplantation. In 2001, Schön et al.19 used a DCD
porcine model to demonstrate successful preservation and
transplantation of porcine livers. The organs were subjected
to 1 h of warm ischemia time, followed by 4 h of NMP. While
none of the recipients of the six livers subjected to 4 h of SCS
survived for more than 7 days, all six recipients of livers from
the NMP group survived.19 About the same time, other investigators showed that NMP could be extended to 72 h, and was
associated with better histological preservation, less transaminase release, improved bile production and superior synthetic/
metabolic function.20–24
More recent experiments have, again, demonstrated
improvement in hemodynamics of the organ, reduction in
markers of ischemia, better avoidance of ischemic and hypothermic injury (Ishak score) and better maintenance of hepatocyte viability in livers preserved by NMP.25–27 In an attempt
to investigate the benefits of NMP on Maastricht Category 2
DCD donors, Fondevilla et al.28 used a DCD porcine model for
which the donor pigs had undergone 90-m cardiac arrest, after
which they were divided into three groups. The first group was
preserved by SCS, the second and third groups underwent
60 m of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) perfusion before being preserved by SCS or NMP for 4 h respectively.
The investigators reported a 0% survival in the SCS group,
83% survival in the ECMO+SCS group and 100% survival in
the ECMO+NMP group. Liver function, endothelial injury, cytokine and inflammatory response, and tissue necrosis was worst
in the SCS group, followed by the ECMO+SCS group and being
least in the ECMO+NMP group.28 These findings suggested that

Akateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review

for those countries that allow Maastricht Category 2 DCD
donation, the addition of NMP to the ECMO procedure could
improve outcomes. The above findings suggest that NMP
might be the best option to resuscitate organs exposed to
extended warm ischemia time, as occurs in DCD donation.
Current procurement protocols require in-situ flushing with
cold UW solution or histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution. There is concern regarding the effects of abrupt reperfusion on the organ. The concept of controlled oxygenated
rewarming was introduced by Minor et al.,
29 initially as an
adjunct to hypothermic perfusion. Banan et al.30 then combined gradual rewarming with NMP and reported improved
INR, bile production, cholangiocyte function and decreased
endothelial damage compared to immediate NMP after 4 h of
cold storage. However, these results were inferior to the group
that underwent NMP immediately without 4 h of cold storage.30
Some investigators have looked at optimizing the outcomes
from NMP through the addition of other adjuncts to the circuit.
In 2012, Chung et al.31 described the addition of a kidney to
the liver NMP circuit. Although the authors saw no improvement in inflammatory cytokine expression, subsequent experiments did find improvements in glucose, pH and renal
parameters such as urea and creatinine. Liver function did
not appear to be compromised. Another study by the same
group demonstrated that placing the kidney in the circuit
before the liver, was more physiologic and produced better
results compared to the liver-first circuit.32–34 Although en
bloc liver-kidney transplants are not mainstream, this finding
represents another area of exploration in patients undergoing
combined liver-kidney transplantation.
Other adjuncts include addition of pharmacologic molecules to mitigate ischemic injury. Goldaracena et al.35
demonstrated improvement in liver function with the addition
of anti-inflammatory strategies, including alprostadil and
n-acetylcysteine. It is worth noting, however, that other studies
have shown decreased inflammation with NMP, even in the
absence of added anti-inflammatory compounds.36 The
concept of the addition of therapeutic compounds to the NMP
perfusion circuit to improve outcomes following transplantation remains one of the areas of greatest potential growth in
NMP technology and is, therefore, worth pursuing.
Small animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies
There have been a limited number of rodent NMP studies due
to their small size and lack of appropriate NMP technology, until
recently. The smaller size and decreased complexity, however,
offers the ability to study different aspects of ex-vivo NMP perfusion at reduced cost. One of the earliest successful ex-vivo
perfusions of a mouse liver was performed by Baba et al.37 in
1988. In a proof-of-concept study, the group demonstrated
stable ATP levels and minimal ischemia after 80 m of ex-vivo
perfusion with oxygenated fluosol-DA.37 In 2008, Talboom and
colleagues38 were able to successfully resuscitate Lewis rat
livers using NMP after 45 m of warm ischemia and 2 h of
simple cold storage. The animals that received these perfused
livers had comparable survival to those with fresh livers, and
did better than those who received livers stored by SCS only.38
The same group, in 2012, used a mouse DCD model to study
machine perfusion/preservation at 208
C, 308C and 378C. These
livers were subsequently transplanted, allowing for evaluation
of long-term outcomes. Results showed that compared to SCS,
where none of the recipients survived past 12 h, 100% of the
recipients from perfused livers (at all three temperatures)
survived.39
Perk et al.,
40 using a DCD rat NMP model, developed a metabolic index of ischemic injury that could be used to evaluate
ex-vivo perfused ischemic livers, helping to predict the function
and, as such, suitability for transplantation. Using perfusate
glucose, urea and lactate levels, the model was able to distinguish between fresh and ischemic livers with 90% specificity.40
A recent study by Op den Dries et al.41 showed that for both
DCD and non-DCD rat livers, there was superior bile duct epithelial integrity and maintenance of morphology in NMP compared to SCS.41 Murine studies have also investigated the
impact of liver steatosis on outcomes. Given that liver steatosis
is major risk factor for primary non-function posttransplantation,42 many investigators have evaluated the use of the NMP
circuit to de-fat the liver prior to transplantation, as well as
mitigate IRI. Negrath et al.,
43 using various defatting cocktails,
showed that successful defatting was associated with improved
recovery from IRI.43 Preconditioning of livers on the NMP circuit
with Nodosin,44 as well as with thrombomodulin,45 was also
associated with improvement in endothelial damage and in IRI.
Clinical studies
Ex-vivo perfusion studies using discarded human livers
(w/o transplantation)
Donor organ shortages and increasing use of marginal donor
organs has been the major driver behind research on normothermic ex-vivo perfusion. One of the significant challenges in
working with marginal organs is the absence of the necessary
tools to adequately assess organs prior to transplantation. For
this reason, DCD has a high organ discard rate.46 In the USA,
about 10% of donated livers are discarded.47 NMP technology
has emerged as a means of viability testing, preservation and
resuscitation of would-be-discarded organs for transplantation. These discarded organs have, in turn, expedited the
translation of ex-vivo perfusion from animals to humans.
In 2013, Op den Dries and colleagues48 demonstrated
that this technology was feasible in human donor livers.
Four discarded livers from donors underwent cold storage
in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (one in UW solution)
for 5–9 h, followed by 6 h of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion
using oxygenated packed red blood cells and fresh frozen
plasma. Histological examination before and after perfusion
showed well-preserved morphology, without evidence of
additional hepatocellular injury, biliary ischemia or sinusoidal
damage. There was bile production from the livers and
decreased lactate in the perfusate during the study,48 consistent with preserved hepatic function. Banan et al.49 showed a
10% reduction in macroglobular steatosis with the addition of
exendin-4 and L-carnitine to the NMP circuit. These findings
could be useful in resuscitation of steatotic livers.
Retrospective studies/case reports in ex-vivo liver
perfusion
There have been several clinical series demonstrating the use
of NMP, but these have been limited to high-volume centers.
In January 2016, Perera et al.50 reported on the first liver
transplant from a graft resuscitated by NMP. The liver, which
had been subjected to 109 m of warm ischemia and 422 m of
cold ischemia, had been rejected by all other centers. The
organ was resuscitated with 416 m of NMP, after which it was
278 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282

successfully transplanted. Overall ex-vivo time from crossclamp to reperfusion was 13 h and 58 m. The recipient had
an uneventful post-transplant course and was doing well at
15-month follow-up.50
Watson et al.51,52 also reported on similar successful cases,
including one with 26 h ex-vivo (618-m cold storage, 8.5-h
NMP perfusion, 412-m SCS). In 2016, Angelico et al.53 conducted a retrospective review of six patients who had received
liver grafts perfused with NMP as part of the OrganOx trial,
comparing them to SCS recipients with similar donor and
recipient characteristics. They found that NMP was associated
with better intraoperative mean arterial pressures at 90 s, less
vasopressor requirement and less blood products compared to
SCS.53 Mergental et al.54 also reported on a series of five livers
that had been previously rejected (four DCD and one nonDCD
with prolonged ischemia). Following resuscitation with the NMP
circuit, the livers showed good viability (perfusate lactate, bile
production, vascular flows, and liver appearance). The livers
were all transplanted, and at 7 months post-transplant all
patients were doing well.54
Watson et al.55 also recently published another series of 12
patients who received liver transplants from organs preserved
by NMP. Six of the organs were perfused with perfusate at high
oxygen tensions. In this group, they noted five cases of postreperfusion syndrome, four cases of sustained vasoplegia and
one of primary non-function. The other six livers with perfusate
containing physiologic oxygen tension did not show these complications, suggesting hyperoxia during NMP could be detrimental to the organ.55
Clinical trials in ex-vivo perfusion
In addition to the case series reported above, there have been
a few Phase 1 pilot studies comparing NMP to SCS, or other
modalities. In all three trials, the investigators used the
OrganOx Metra12 device for normothermic perfusion. Table 1
summarizes some of the major findings from these trials.
The above-noted Phase 1 trials of normothermic ex-vivo
perfusion have demonstrated its non-inferiority to SCS.56–58
It is worth noting, however, that none of the livers in these
NMP trials were specifically labeled as extended criteria or marginal organs. In at least two of the trials (Ravikumar et al.56 and
Selzner et al.58), 80% of the livers were procured from brain
dead donors. As previously noted, optimal organs generally
tolerate SCS well, which is why this has been the standard for
care the last two to three decades. So, although these have
been non-inferiority trials, it is plausible that the true benefits
of NMP will be become evident in trials with direct comparison
using marginal livers. The authors of current trials have argued
that NMP studies using standard livers are necessary to prove
the feasibility of the technology before applying it to marginal
livers, where it is expected to have the most benefit.
There are several Phase 2 and randomized clinical trials
underway, and will hopefully address these concerns. The
current trials have proved the feasibility of this technology in
liver transplantation.
Predictions of organ utility/discard
There continues to be considerable debate about the best
parameters to use to truly assess the organ prior to transplantation. Regardless of parameters, however, NMP provides
a means of viability testing not afforded by SCS. Bile formation
and secretion is generally accepted as a hallmark of liver graft
function. Brockmann et al.24 have shown that bile output
(as well as base excess, portal vein flow, and hepatocellular
enzymes) were all markers of liver function in a porcine liver
transplant model. Sutton and colleagues59 showed that high
bile output of more than 30 g in 1 h was consistent with
lower necrosis and improved potassium and transaminase
levels, suggesting that this might be a good marker of viability.
Various perfusate markers have also been investigated as
markers of liver function, viability and degree of hepatocyte
damage. Karangwa and colleagues60 reported that a high
D-dimer level early-on in the NMP circuit predicts severe ischemia of reperfusion and poor graft function. Beta-galactosidase
level in perfusate,61 factor V level,62 perfusate pH62 and bicarbonate level59 have all been demonstrated as markers of viability. Other investigators have combined multiple parameters
in an attempt to develop an algorithm than could be used to
evaluate these organs. As previously noted, using a rat DCD
model, Perk et al.40 developed a metabolic index of ischemic
injury using perfusate glucose, urea and lactate levels capable
of distinguishing between fresh and ischemic livers with 90%
specificity. Bruinsma et al.63 advocated for the use of metabolomics (a comprehensive metabolic profile of the liver’s
condition) in combination with typical NMP parameters to
better assess and characterize preserved livers.

Akateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review

At this point, it remains unclear which factors best predict
graft viability, as there have been no large randomized trials
validating any of these parameters.
HMP and subnormothermic perfusion
Given the success with machine perfusion of the kidney, most
of the early studies in machine perfusion of the liver were done
at hypothermic and subnormothermic temperatures. In 1967,
Slapak et al.,
14 fashioned a completely portable apparatus for
hypothermic organ preservation including a 3-atmosphere
oxygen concentrator, which was used successfully to preserve
canine liver grafts ex-vivo before transplantation.14 HMP was
further promoted by the development of the UW solution. In
1990, Yanaga,15 working with Starzl, adapted the model MOX100 kidney perfusion machine into an ex-vivo liver perfusion
system. HMP, however, did not gain full acceptance at that time
due to the ease of SCS with the UW solution and the cumbersome nature of the HMP apparatus. Nevertheless, there was
continued progress being made in the field, including multiple
small and large animal studies.
In 2010, Guarrera et al.64 published the first prospective
trial of HMP in human subjects. In this study, 20 adults who
received HMP-preserved livers were compared to a matched
group of cohorts who had received livers preserved by SCS.
The investigators found no significant difference in overall
outcome between the two groups.64 Since then, there have
been more Phase 1 trials in hypothermic perfusion, including
a study by Guarrera et al.65 in 2015, which compared 31
extended criteria livers preserved by HMP to 30 matched SCS
controls. The researchers noted significantly less biliary
complications in the HMP group versus the SCS group (4 vs. 13,
p = 0.016). There was one primary graft non-function case in
the HMP group and in the SCS group. Additionally, the hospital
length of stay was significantly shorter in the HMP group.65
A similar study by Dutkowski et al. found significantly
decreased liver injury (peak alanine aminotransferase, cholangiopathy, biliary complications, and graft survival) in DCD
livers preserved by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. They
also compared hypothermic oxygenate machine perfusionperfused livers to brain dead donors preserved in a standard
fashion (SCS) and found no significant difference. While HMP
appears to be advantageous over SCS, there is no clear benefit
of HMP over NMP. Additionally, there have been no randomized
trials directly comparing HMP to NMP. Critics of HMP argue that,
this modality does not allow for full functional assessment of
the allograft, as the organs are not perfused at physiologic
temperature.
The future of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion
The most immediate need and benefit of ex-vivo donor organ
perfusion is organ assessment and potential repair prior to
transplantation. The inability to adequately assess organs
has led to relatively low rate of organ utility, despite an everincreasing need.66,67 NMP and its ability to assess various
organ parameters, including hepatic and portal artery resistance, bile production and changes in transaminases, provide
valuable information that would aid in pre-transplant organ
assessment. By providing a platform for pre-transplant assessment, NMP will serve to expand the donor pool, especially with
regards to DCD and steatotic donations, which are often challenging to adequately assess.7,68,69
One of the major challenges in liver transplantation is cold
ischemia time and the ability to reduce it. In 2009, Englesbe
et al.70 reported on Surgical Transplantation as one of the
riskiest jobs in Medicine, owing to the need to procure and
transplant organs as quickly as possible.70 In many hospitals,
transplants are done at odd hours of the day, as organs must
be transplanted immediately to decrease cold ischemia time.
NMP ex-vivo perfusion allows the ability to preserve the organ
for longer periods and to transplant it at a scheduled/desired
time. Not only can patients get their affairs in order, but transplant surgeons will be able to have rest periods between procurement and transplantation.
Moreover, NMP has shown great promise in its ability to
potentially mitigate the IRI associated with the procurement and
preservation process, allowing for transplantation of improved
organs. Extension of perfusion time, equally has potential
applicability in combined organ transplantation. Ceulemans
et al.,
71 in 2014, reported on the case of a patient with severe
cystic fibrosis leading to pulmonary failure and liver fibrosis. The
patient in that case underwent ex-vivo lung perfusion while the
liver was being transplanted, as his liver disease was deemed
too severe to allow for a lung transplant.71 A similar model could
be applied in a patient with more severe lung disease or heart
disease, who is unable to tolerate a liver transplant first. The
liver could be placed on the NMP circuit, avoiding further cold
ischemia time while the other organ is being transplanted.
Additionally, exploratory therapies are now associated with
NMP. One suggestion has been the addition of mesenchymal
stem cells to the NMP circuit, to hopefully induce immune
tolerance in the graft.72 Anti-apoptotic agents and cell protective agents can be added into the perfusate as a means to reengineer suboptimal organs to better tolerate IRI.73 Although
none of these have been employed in clinical trials or clinical
practice, the opportunities abound. In a recent study, Goldaracena et al.74 reported on the recent use of the ex-vivo
perfusion circuit to deliver Miravirsen to prevent hepatitis C
virus reinfection in porcine livers. This study, if translated to
human livers, could have significant implications for the use
hepatitis C virus-infected liver grafts, potentially in noninfected recipients. The technique could also be extended to
potential donors with other systemic infections or infectious
risk, expanding the donor pool.
Conclusions
Despite the great success of liver transplantation, the current
donor organ shortage and the changes in donor demographics
have placed an increased emphasis on the ability to safely use
marginal organs. Although it has shown great promise in
animal studies and early clinical series, there is still a paucity
of robust human trials on NMP to date. The efficacy and
superiority of this preservation technique to current methods
will have to be demonstrated to justify the additional cost.
