Summary. Isolated pancreatic islets were transplanted 
isogenoieally into the subcutaneus tissue, peritoneum 
and portal vein of diabetic rats. implantation of islets 
subcutaneously did not modify the diabetic state. Intraperitoneal islets ameliorated the effects of diabetes but 
normal urine vohmaes, blood glucose and urine glucose 
Ievels were not achieved. Direct injection of islets into 
the portal vein resulted in normal urine volumes, normoglycemia and abolition of glyeosuria in the rats studied. 
These effects have been maintained 2 months later. -- It 
is suggested that the portal environment may be the most 
effective site for transplanted pancreatic islets.

diabetes mellitus, portal vein, pancreas, isograft 
Although insulin maintenance therapy has prolonged the life of the diabetic and significantly reduced 
deaths from ketoaeidosis, the disabling late complications of the disease are not prevented by this 
form of treatment. Furthermore, in some patients, 
especially in the juvenile diabetic group, it is often 
difficult to maintain blood sugar levels within the 
normal range with exogenous insulin, indicating the 
need for an alternative method of treatment. 
Recently there has been much interest in the 
possibility of pancreatic islet transplants in the treatment of diabetes, and experimental work by Ballinger 
and Lacy Ill suggests that this approach is now 
feasible. These workers showed that intraperitoneal 
and intramuscular implantation of isolated pancreatic 
islets ameliorates the effects of streptozotoein induced 
diabetes in the rat. ttowever, although the intraperitoneal and intramuscular siting of these islets 
reduced hyperglyeaemia, polyuria and glyeosuria in 
these animals, consistently normal values were rarely 
achieved. 
Under normal circumstances insulin from the panereatie cells is secreted directly into the portal venous 
system. We have investigated the possibility that this 
intraportal site may provide a more physiological 
environment for the transplanted islets and possibly 
more effective utilization of secreted hormones than 
can be achieved by siting the islets intraperitoneally 
or subcutaneously. 
Materials and Methods 
1. Donors 
Pancreatic islets were harvested from inbred 
Lewis rats (250--300 g) by the collagenase digestion 
method of Lacy and Kostianovsky [2]. This method 
consists of cannulation of the common bile duct, 
distension of the pancreas with a balanced salt solution, fine chopping of the excised gland, and digestion 
for approximately ten minutes at 37 ~ C with eollagenase 
in a shaker water bath. After a series of washes, the 
islets were separated from unwanted aeinar tissue by 
differential layering of dialyzed Fieoll [4]. This technique requires dialyzing Fieoll, a high molecular weight 
polymer of sucrose, against distilled water to remove 
various contaminants with lyophilization back to a 
powder. The washed digest preparation is mixed with 
dialyzed Fieoll 25% (W.V.). Careful layering of decreasing concentrations of dialyzed Ficoll (23%, 20% 
and 11%) above the preparation readies it for eentrifugation for 10 rain at 800 g. The islets rise through 
the density gradient to settle at the 20~o--11~o 
interface leaving the digested acinar tissue behind 
in the 25% layer. A clean separation of islets is rapidly 
achieved with this technique. The number of islets for 
each preparation is estimated after centrifugation by 
the appearance of the density of islets at the 11~o-- 
20% interface. Frequent checking confirms the estimate to be accurate within 50 islets for each isolation. 
The islets can then be easily removed from the Fieoll 
with a silieonized transfer pipet and readied for transplantation. 
2. Recipients 
Twenty-five previously healthy Lewis rats (250-- 
300 g) of the same inbred strain as the donor group 
were made diabetic by the intravenous injection of 
streptozotoein (Upjohn) at a dose schedule of 65 mg/kg. 
These rats returned to their metabolic cages for 3 
weeks during which time a free diet of rat chow and 
water was allowed. Urine volumes were measured 
daily; blood sugars and urine glucose concentrations 
were estimated twice weekly. After 3 weeks each of the 
25 rats was allotted randomly to one of 4 groups. 
Group I. Diabetic Controls (10 rats) 
These rats received no treatment for diabetes.

Group II. Subcutaneous Implantation (5 rats) 
Under ether anaesthesia a No. 23 needle was introduced through the skin of the anterior abdominal 
wall and between 850--970 (Mean 890) islets deposited 
subcutaneously. 
Group III. Intraperitoneal Implantation (5 rats) 
Rats were anaesthetized with ether. Through a 
small (1 era) midline abdominal incision between 
600 and 850 (Mean 770) islets were introduced into the 
peritoneal cavity and the wound closed. 
Group I V. Intraportal Implantation (5 rats) 
A long (3 em) midline abdominal incision was 
cages for a period of 3 months during which time a 
free diet of rat chow and water was allowed. Urine 
volumes and glucose concentrations were measured 
daily and blood sugar levels were estimated twice 
weekly. 
Results (Figs. 1--3) 
Group I. All 10 control rats were grossly diabetic 
within 24 h of streptozotoein administration and 
remained so for the period of study. There was no 
improvement of this diabetic state with the passage 
of time. Blood sugar levels fluctuated between 280 and 
500

the blood glucose of diabetic rats. Diabetic controls [10] 
made under ether anaesthesia. Displacement of the 
large and small bowel to the left side displayed the 
portal and superior mesenteric veins with ease. A 
siliconized 1 ml glass syringe with attached No. 23 
needle was rinsed with Hanks solution and the plunger 
withdrawn to the 0.75 ml marking on the empty 
syringe barrel. The curved needle was then introduced 
cephalad into the portal vein for a distance of 1 em 
and the plunger removed from the syringe barrel. 
400--600 (Mean 550) islets in suspension were then 
introduced into the 0.3 ml of blood which had entered 
the syringe barrel, and the plunger replaced. With 
gentle pressure the blood and contained islets were 
injected into the portal vein, care being taken to 
avoid the introduction of air. Blood was then withdrawn a second time into the syringe and reinjected 
to deal with any residual islets. The needle was removed and pressure applied over the venipuncture for 
about 3 min by which time bleeding had usually 
ceased. After replacing the bowel the abdomen was 
closed. 
l~ats from all groups were observed in metabolic 
700 mg per 100 ml with daily urine volumes ranging 
from 62 to i68 ml. Heavy glycosuria (4--16.6 g per 
day) reflected the hyperglycaemia. 
Group II. Subcutaneous implantation of islets did 
not alter the diabetic state of the 5 rats in this group 
Urine volumes remained high (70--160 ml per day 
with blood sugar levels fluctuating between 300 and 
710 mg per 100 ml. Urine glucose was unchanged at 
4--15 g per day. 
Group III. Intraperitoneal implantation of pancreatie islets had an ameliorating effect on the diabetic 
state in all 5 rats. Blood gineose levels fell to 200-- 
400 mg per 100 ml and a similar reduction in urine 
volumes was also noted (70--100 ml per day). Urinary 
glucose content was reduced to 1.8--6.8 g per day. 
Group IV. Injection of islets directly into the 
portal vein resulted in normoglycaemia (62--121 mg 
per 100 ml) normal urine volume (6--2][ ml per day) 
and abolition of glycosuria in the 5 rats studied. This 
condition is maintained 2 months later.

Discussion 
Previous work has shown that pancreatic islets 
isolated by the collagenase digestion method maintain 
their insulin secreting properties in vitro [3] and that 
intraperitoneal transplantation of such islets reduces 
the severity of experimental diabetes in the rat [1]. 
islets into a subcutaneous pocket had no effect on the 
diabetic state of recipient rats. 
These results suggest that the site of implantation 
may be an important consideration if transplantation 
of pancreatic islets is to be used in the treatment of 
clinioM diabetes. The ideal implantation site would 
be one which would permit maximum survival and

This ameliorating effect of intraperitoneal isografts is 
confirmed by the present study although normal 
values for blood sugar, urine volume and urine glucose 
were not achieved. Implantation o~ the same number 
of islets into the portal venous system, however, 
resulted in normoglycaemia, normal urine volumes 
and abolition of glycosuria, effects which have been 
maintained two months after transplantation. In 
contrast to this dramatic response, implantation of 
function of transplanted islets, maximum effectiveness 
oi secreted hormones and safety to the patient. It 
would also be desirable that the transplanted islets 
be easily retrievable, particularly in view of the high 
infection risk associated with immunosupression 
therapy in diabetes. Perhaps the least hazardous 
implantation site in the diabetic patient would be a 
subcutaneous pocket; but the results of this study 
would indicate that islet function in this milieu would

be insufficient to materially affect the course of the 
diabetic state, possibly due to poor perfusion of the 
transplanted tissue. Similarly, the function of intraperitoneal islets would seem from this experimental 
study to be insufficient to maintain adequate control 
of blood sugar. Also, dissemination of tissue throughout 
the peritoneal cavity would present problems if 
retrieval were found to be necessary. Indeed, one is 
unable to locate the islets after intraperitoneal injection. The effect of siting the islets within the portal 
vascular system was dramatic with virtual recovery 
from the diabetic state in those rats studied. Whether 
regarding insulin release and hepatic utilization are 
in progress. 
The dissemination of the transplanted islets 
throughout the hver may present problems when one 
considers this site for transplantation in man. It 
would seem desirable then if the intraportal environment is found to provide the most effective functional 
milieu, to design a system whereby transplanted 
islets are bathed in portal venous blood while at the 
same time being readily retrievable. Possibilities 
include selective portal vein injection in a larger 
organism such as man or the use of an intravascular

or not a similar response could have been achieved 
by injection of islets into the systemic circulation is 
as yet uncertain but preliminary experiments in this 
laboratory suggest that the intraportal environment 
is the more effective. 
Investigations are underway to elucidate the sequence of events that allow for the establishment of 
the islets within the portal tract. Preliminary findings 
suggest that initially the islets are located in the 
terminal portal vessels 24 h after injection (Fig. 4). 
They become vaseularized at some point while remaining within the portal tract (Fig. 5) and appear 
able to synthesize insulin as evidenced by beta cell 
granulation (Fig. 6). Their ability to satisfy the insulin 
needs of the recipient animal has been demonstrated 
by the clinical parameters presented. Detailed studies 
Millipore chamber. However, to date there have been 
no reports of successful long term endocrine transplantation using the Millipore chamber. Alternatively, 
islets might be injected into the splenic artery which 
would allow tissue retrieval by splenectomy. Further 
investigations of these problems are at present in 
progress in this laboratory.
