Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease with multifactorial ethiopatogenesis, characterized by lymphomonocytic infiltration of liver, presence of serum autoantibodies (ANA, SMA, LKM-1) and high levels of immunoglobulins. Overlap 
syndromes are defined as the association of autoimmune hepatitis with cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis. The boundaries of these syndromes as distinct pathological entities are still matter of debate and they could be part 
of a major liver autoimmune disease. Furthermore, cholestatic diseases may present even with atypical features (AMA-negative primary 
cirrohosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis with normal cholangiography).
Case Presentation: We herein describe a case of a 7 year-old child affected by an overlap syndrome between type 2 autoimmune hepatitis 
and small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis. Although characterized by a severe onset, the disease showed a good response to treatment 
with prednisone and azathioprine.
Conclusions: The association of type 2 autoimmune hepatitis and small duct primary cholangitis has been rarely reported in literature 
and this report adds new data on this still unclear entity.

1. Introduction
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory disease with a multi-factorial etio-pathogenesis characterized by peri-portal lymphomonocytic infiltration of liver, 
liver-specific and/or non-organ-specific autoantibodies, 
hyper-gamaglobulinemia (1). AIH may be associated with 
different cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, resembling 
findings of other immune-mediated liver diseases. These 
associated phenotypes have been designated 'overlap 
syndromes' although the validity of these syndromes as 
distinct pathological entities remains unclear (2).
We describe a case of type 2 AIH associated with a small 
duct autoimmune cholangitis in a 7-year girl to add new 
data on this rare association whose bonders are still uncertain in childhood.
2. Case Presentation
The patient is a seven year old Sri-Lankan girl. In January 
2012 she contracted an upper airways infection with fever 
and after one week she presented yellow discoloration of 
eyes and acholic stools. Blood investigations showed an 
increase of total bilirubin (19.5 mg/dl, direct 9.4 mg/dl, 
and indirect 10.1 mg/dl), transaminases (AST 1216 U/L, ALT 
1022 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase (524 U/L). An abdominal scan showed irregular liver surface with inhomogeneous structure, compatible with chronic liver disease. 
In March, the child was admitted at our unit: general conditions were good, weight was 12.7 kg (25th pc), height 
92.2 cm (25th pc); she showed yellow eyes discoloration 
and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR 
(51 mm/h), LDH (1567 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (713 U/L), 
transaminases (AST 1391 U/L, ALT 1405 U/L), γ-GT (294 U/L) 
and IgG (2110 mg/dl). Liver kidney antibodies (LKM) were 
strongly positive (1:640). Other test, including Anti-native 
DNA antibodies, ASMA, AMA, EMA and tTG, were normal. 
A liver biopsy showed enlargement of portal spaces correlated to a lymphocytic infiltrate with plasma-cells, 
neutrophiles and eosinophiles. This process exceeded

the limiting membrane with piecemeal necrosis interesting the epithelium of the bile ducts. Periportal and 
portal fibrosis (onion-like), vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes with formation of binucleate cells and pseudorosettes and signs of lobular inflammation with formation of apoptotic bodies were also present, together with 
a reduction of the number of biliary ducts. A magnetic 
resonance cholangiography was then performed, showing normal duct anatomy and no signs of large duct sclerosing cholangitis. For this reason a diagnosis of overlap 
syndrome of type 2 AIH and small duct cholangitis was 
performed.
Treatment with prednisone at a dose of 15 mg twice daily (2 mg/kg/day) was followed by a general improvement. 
After two months the patient presented a mild but persistent increase of transaminases and alcaline phosphatase. 
There were also signs of hypercortisolism and hypertension, and for this reason a gradual reduction of prednisone to 10 mg/day was performed and azathioprine at a 
dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day was introduced. Two weeks later the 
liver enzyme levels returned to the normal range.
3. Conclusions
Our patient presented a type 2 AIH and biochemical 
(high direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases and γ-GT serum levels) and histological features of cholestatic liver 
disease suggestive of small duct PSC.
AIH is an inflammatory disease characterized by hepatic 
cells damage associated with hypergammaglobulinemia 
and the presence of auto-antibodies. In North Europe the 
incidence is 1.9 cases per 100,000 per year (higher in female sex) and all ages and ethnic groups are interested 
(1). 
The diagnosis of AIH is based on exclusion of other 
causes of chronic liver disease such as genetic diseases 
like α1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, Wilson's 
disease, viral infections (HAV, HBV or HCV), and drug hepatotoxity. The diagnostic criteria include a specific scoring system defined by the International Autoimmune 
Hepatitis Group in 1999 (3) and simplified in 2008 by 
Hennes and coll (4).
Two forms of AIH are usually distinguished. Type I is 
more common in the second decade of life and between 
45 and 70 years (5). It is associated with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies 
(ASMA). Type II is characterized by serum liver kidney 
microsomal anti-1 (LKM1) positivity. It is the less common 
form of AIH and it may present like a fulminant hepatitis, 
especially in younger patients or with a rapid evolution 
toward cirrhosis (6). Histological biliary changes, including bile duct damage, acute and/or chronic cholangitis, 
and biliary pattern of periportal hepatitis, have also been 
noted in 31% of children with AIH (7).
Overlap syndromes are characterized by the histological abnormalities of AIH and biliary tract involvement, 
which are mainly primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PBC is always characterized by bile duct injury, AMA positivity and increase 
of alkaline phosphatase and γ-GT, while PSC is typically 
characterized by AMA-negativity and overall by cholangiography abnormalities and it is more common in childhood: for this age it has been also proposed the definition 
“autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis”, to designate the 
overlap between AIH and PSC (8).
However these distinct pathological entities sometimes 
are uncertain. In fact patients with AIH and histological 
features of bile duct injury or loss, with AMA negativity, absence of large bile duct injury or inflammatory 
bowel disease, normal cholangiography have also been 
described (2). These patients represent a different syndrome designated as ‘‘autoimmune cholangitis”, or they 
may be variants of the two above reported overlap syndromes and designated as ‘‘AIH with AMA-negative PBC’’ 
or ‘‘AIH with small duct PSC’’ (2).
The histological findings of AIH include a dense mononuclear and plasma-cells infiltration of the portal areas, 
which expands into the liver lobule, destruction of the 
hepatocytes at the periphery of the lobule with erosion of 
the limiting plate (‘‘interface hepatitis’’).Connective tissue collapse results from hepatocyte death and expands 
from the portal area into the lobule (‘‘bridging collapse’’) 
with hepatic regeneration and ‘‘rosette’’ formation (9). In 
our patient we found loss or proliferation of interlobar 
ducts due to biliary tract injuries and peri-ductal inflammation and onion-skin type fibrosis, all findings diagnostic of a small duct PSC (10).
Our case is very interesting for different aspects such as 
the very early age of onset and the coexistence of type II 
AIH and PSC. Differently from our patient, in the experience of Olssen and coll (10), the median age of onset of 
AIH with large or small tract PSC was 27-28 years (ranging 
15-69 years) and it was often associated with other autoimmune disorders (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, non-specific colitis, diabetes). Furthermore, 
LKM positivity is rarely reported in this overlap syndrome 
(2, 11). In particular, in the report of Gregorio et al. (8), only 
one patient of 27 with AIH-ASC presented LKM positivity, 
while 20/27 presented ANA and/or SMA.
The diagnosis of the overlap syndrome of AIH with PSC 
requires predominant features of AIH by clinical judgment or the scoring system of the IAIHG (3), absence of 
AMA, and features of cholestasis including jaundice, high 
serum alkaline phosphatase and γ-GT levels, or histological changes that suggest bile duct injury or loss (2, 11). The 
diagnosis is usually confirmed by abnormalities in cholangiography. On the contrary, as in our case, a normal 
cholangiogram associated with histological data of biliary tract involvement leads to a diagnosis of “small duct 
PSC” (10).
Therapy of overlap forms does not differ from AIH 
alone, although in some cases with persistent hyperbilirubinemia ursodeoxycholic acid may be helpful. In children the treatment is usually performed at the diagnosis.

It includes prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day (up to 60 mg/day), 
alone or in combination with azathioprine; Maintenance 
regimen is reached by prednisone decrease to 0.1-0.2 mg/
kg/day or 5 mg/day, alone or in combination with azathioprine. This regime is maintained for at least 1-2 years 
after the normalization of liver parameters, the absence 
of clinical signs, and no evidence of active inflammation 
at biopsy.
Most patients show an improvement of liver tests after 
2-4 weeks of treatment with laboratory remission within 
six months/one year. Recent data estimate the remission 
rate of 65-80% for type II AIH (12), and higher than 80% 
for small ducts primary cholangitis (13-15). On the other 
hand, the frequency of relapses is still high in children 
so many trials with different immunosuppressive strategies have been performed (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) (1).
At the present AIH–PSC diagnosis is still difficult because of the lack of clear criteria, rarity, and differences 
between children and adults (2, 5, 11). As reported in the 
most recent works, it remains unclear whether the overlap syndromes form distinct entities or they are only variants of one major autoimmune liver disease (7, 11). 
Standardization of overlap syndromes’ diagnosis is still 
lacking, especially when they present with “non distinctive” features of PSC or PBC, as in our patient. In fact, in 
our case, the clinical and histological signs of PSC were 
not confirmed by MR-cholangiography, thus leading to 
diagnosis of AIH - small duct PSC overlap. Is important 
to underline that our patient presented a type II AIH-PSC 
overlap, in contrast to what has been mainly observed 
in other reports (8, 10), in which type I AIH is the form 
mostly observed in the overlap syndromes. Furthermore 
either PBC or PSC may show auto-antibodies (ANA, SMA) 
or severe lymphocytic interface hepatitis even though 
they are not AIH (7, 11). 
The clinical case we presented add new data on this controversial point, taking in consideration that more reports could be useful to better define the limits of these 
autoimmune liver diseases and to improve the management of these patients.
