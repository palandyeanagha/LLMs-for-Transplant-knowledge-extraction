Abstract: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a nonhuman primate that is used for preclinical 
research on stem cell transplantation therapies due to its similarity to human beings as well as its 
small size, enabling researchers to perform experiments without preparing a large number of cells. 
In this study, we developed a marmoset hepatic fibrosis model for regenerative medicine research. 
Six female marmosets aged 4–6 years were administered thioacetamide (TAA) at a dose of 2.5–40 
mg/kg two or three times a week. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy when blood chemistry 
indicated liver damage. Administration of TAA increased total bile acid, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and total bilirubin and decreased serum albumin levels. Following more than 11 weeks of continuous 
injection of TAA, histological analyses detected hepatic fibrosis in all animals. Type IV collagen 7S 
serum levels in animals with hepatic fibrosis were significantly higher than in normal animals as a 
possible marker of hepatic fibrosis in marmosets. Serial liver biopsies following the last administration 
of TAA revealed that induced fibrosis remained up to 11 weeks. The results suggest that continuous 
TAA administration induces persistent hepatic fibrosis in the common marmoset and this nonhuman 
primate hepatic fibrosis model have the possibility to evaluate the therapeutic effects of test samples 
to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis.

Introduction
Hepatic fibrosis has emerged as a global public health 
problem, and numerous cell therapies have been developed [5, 6]. For human clinical research of the novel 
therapies, testing with animal models is essential and 
various hepatic fibrosis models using mice and rats have 
been established [21]. However, positive results in rodent 
models have not always translated through to successful 
clinical therapies and more realistic preclinical models

need to be developed [6]. Nonhuman primates have the 
potential to bridge the gap between rodents and humans 
due to their physiological similarity with humans [1, 2].
A common marmoset, a small New World monkey, 
has recently drawn attention as a preclinical animal 
model. Marmosets have several favorable features for 
biomedical research including small size (300–500 g), 
good availability, and relatively rapid generational turnover [17, 18, 22]. They are also highly useful in preclinical studies in regenerative medicine [3, 9, 11]. One 
of the advantages of using marmoset animal model is 
that it can evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cell 
transplantation therapy with a small number of cells. 
Furthermore, it was reported that marmosets recapitulate 
human liver diseases in studies of GB virus B infection, 
a surrogate model of hepatitis C virus infection [15], and 
spontaneous pathologic findings associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [12]. However, there are no reports of experimental 
hepatic fibrosis models of marmosets. Therefore, we 
investigated the induction of a marmoset hepatic fibrosis 
model by administering TAA, a hepatic fibrosis-inducing 
compound used for other animal models [14].
In this study, TAA was administered subcutaneously 
2–3 times a week at 2.5–40.0 mg/kg to common marmosets. Weight measurement, blood biochemical tests, and 
histological examination by liver biopsy were performed 
to evaluate the presence of any liver disorder and the 
optimal administration dose and interval were examined.
Materials and Methods
Animals
This study was performed in strict accordance with 
the Regulation for Animal Experiments of the Central 
Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA) based on the 
Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments 
(Science Council of Japan, 2006). The animal experiment protocol was approved by the CIEA Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (approval no. 16002A).
Seven female common marmosets obtained from 
CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan), were used in this study. Six 
animals (A–F) were used for TAA-induced liver fibrosis 
models, and one (G) was used as an intact control for 
serum tests. The animals were 4–7 years old and weighed 
303–421 g at the start of TAA administration (A–F) or 
serum collection (G). They were housed singly in stainless steel cages (409 × 610 × 728 mm) in a conditioned 
animal room at 26–28°C and 40–60% humidity with a 
12:12 h light/dark cycle. The cages included wooden 
perches and a wooden resting place and positioned facing each other to allow the animals to communicate 
visually and vocally. The animals were fed a commercial 
New World primate diet (CMS-1M, CLEA Japan) with 
added vitamins and tap water ad libitum, and the food 
was moistened with hot water to vary the texture. The 
marmosets were also fed supplemental foods, such as 
sponge cake, apple jelly, or biscuits.
TAA administration and evaluation of liver fibrosis
TAA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved 
in saline (Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was 
subcutaneously administered to each marmoset 2–3 
times a week at a dose of 2.5–40 mg/kg in a volume of 
1–2 ml/kg. Dose and frequency of TAA administration 
were changed depending on the blood test and liver biopsy results to examine the optimal protocol. Blood 
samples (0.5 ml) were drawn from the femoral vein once 
a week, and the collected serum was shipped to a commercial laboratory (Nagahama Institute for Biochemical 
Science, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Nagahama, Japan) for 
albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), total bilirubin (TBIL), total bile acid (TBA), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE) measurements. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy 
at 3–9-week intervals when blood chemistry indicated 
liver disorder. Liver tissue was collected via a small 
abdominal incision with the animal under anesthesia with 
0.04 mg/kg medetomidine, 0.40 mg/kg midazolam, 0.40 
mg/kg butorphanol, and 1–3% isoflurane. Postoperative 
analgesia and infection control following biopsy included 1.2 mg/kg ketoprofen and 15 mg/kg ampicillin 
administered once daily for 3 consecutive days.
Liver tissue samples were fixed with 10% neutral 
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 
the samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin 
(HE), Masson trichrome, and Sirius Red, and the specimens were examined microscopically. Areas stained with 
Sirius Red were measured for quantitative analysis of 
fibrosis using a digital slide scanner (NanoZoomer S60, 
Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and ImageJ 
software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, 
USA). Blood serum samples were collected for type IV 
collagen 7S measurement in five marmosets when liver 
fibrosis was observed on liver biopsy in each animal. 

TAA-INDUCED HEPATIC FIBROSIS IN MARMOSETS 323
Measurements in marmosets A, C, D, E, and F were 
performed after 33, 24, 18, 22, and 22 weeks of initial 
TAA administration, respectively. This measurement was 
performed 2 weeks after liver biopsy for reducing the 
effect of surgery. Serum samples from intact three marmosets (E and F before TAA administration and G) were 
also used for the measurement. Type IV collagen 7S 
assay was performed in a commercial laboratory (SRL 
Tokyo Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis
Student unpaired, two-tailed t test was used to compare type IV collagen levels using Prism 7 (GraphPad 
Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
Subcutaneous injection of TAA reproducibly induces 
hepatic fibrosis in marmosets
Due to the lack of information regarding an effective 
dose of TAA, we had modified the doses and frequencies 
of TAA administration in four trials (Fig. 1). In the first 
trial, we gradually increased the dose from 2.5 to 10 mg/
kg twice a week in marmoset A (Fig. 1), but neither blood 
examinations nor liver biopsies indicated hepatic fibrosis even at 16 weeks after initial treatment. Next, TAA 
was increased up to 30 mg/kg three times a week after 
an interval of 2 weeks. A dose of TAA was further escalated to 40 mg/kg three times a week at the next 2 weeks 
as liver biopsy did not detected hepatic fibrosis. Then, 
hepatic fibrosis was detected at 24 weeks after initial 
treatment coupled with slight changes in blood examinaFig. 1. Subcutaneous injection of TAA reproducibly induces hepatic fibrosis in 6 marmosets (A–E). Upper) Doses and frequencies of

tions for AST, LDH, TBIL, and TBA levels. Biopsy 
specimens with Masson trichrome and Sirius Red stains 
showed that collagen fiber increased in pericentral regions and peritoneal areas (Fig. 1).
In the second trial, we started 10 mg/kg of TAA twice 
a week for 4 weeks, then increased to 20 mg/kg twice a 
week and continued for the next 3 weeks in marmoset B 
(Fig. 1). Next, we escalated TAA up to 40 mg/kg as we 
observed no hepatic fibrosis and then detected hepatic 
fibrosis 6 weeks after increasing dose to 40 mg/kg (Fig. 
1). Hepatic fibrosis was persistently observed for 9 weeks 
with continuous TAA injections.
In the third trial, we started 40 mg/kg as an initial dose 
of TAA in marmosets C and D (Fig. 1). We observed 
hepatic fibrosis in both the marmosets at 11 weeks after 
the initial treatment (Figs. 1–3). However, high-dose 
TAA administration resulted in temporary withdrawal 
due to weakening by suspected hepatic dysfunction. The 
marmoset D that had been administered TAA (40 mg/
kg) three times a week showed anorexia and nearly 20% 
loss of body weight 7 weeks after initial administration. 
Then, we stopped TAA administration for recovery and 
resumed TAA injection after an interval of 2 weeks, reducing the frequency to twice a week.
In the fourth trial, TAA was injected 20, 30, and 40 
mg/kg three times a week in marmosets E and F (Fig. 
Fig. 2. Hepatic fibrosis induced by TAA in a marmoset. Tissue section with Masson trichrome staining (×2.5) was 
collected from marmoset D that had been subcutaneously injected with TAA at 40 mg/kg 2–3 times a week 
for 16 weeks (Fig. 1). Collagen fiber (blue-colored) increased in the pericentral and periportal areas with 
bridging among areas.

Biopsy specimens with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome stain (MT) of marmoset C (×200) at each time point (w: week) are shown. Marmoset C was subcutaneously injected with TAA at a dose of 40 mg/kg twice a week for 23 weeks (Fig. 1). Collagen fiber increased 
with the TAA administration period, and fibrosis was observed until 11 weeks after withdrawal.

1). Liver biopsy detected hepatic fibrosis in the both 
animals 14 weeks after initial administration. However, 
the both animals were weakened during TAA administration period (40 mg/kg three times a week) and were 
withdrawn from TAA; the marmoset E showed anorexia, hypoactivity and marked body weight loss 8 weeks 
after initial administration, and the marmoset F showed 
anorexia, hypoactivity and hypothermia 11 weeks after 
intimal administration, respectively.
Quantitative assay of hepatic fibrosis with Sirius Red 
staining was performed using all 28 liver biopsy specimens in which the average area (± SD) was 6.46 ± 2.66 
mm2. The rate of appearance of Sirius Red-positive area 
was gradually increased after 40 mg/kg of TAA administration up to 31% in marmoset B (Fig. 1).
Recovery from hepatic fibrosis after TAA cessation
Serial liver biopsies were performed to examine spontaneous recovery from hepatic fibrosis. The typical case 
marmoset C to which 40 mg/kg TAA was administered 
twice a week is shown in Fig. 3. Masson trichrome staining detected definite fibrosis at week 21 following the 
initiation of TAA. Notably, fibrosis was continuously 
observed at 6 weeks after the last injection (Fig. 3). At 
week 11, mild fibrosis was still observed, suggesting that 
TAA-induced hepatic fibrosis persists for approximately 3 months after discontinuation of TAA treatment.
Blood examinations
Mean values ± SD of blood chemistry in 7 normal 
marmosets (marmosets A–F before TAA administration 
and marmoset G) were ALB 4.6 ± 0.6 g/dl, AST 125 ± 
97 U/l, ALT 7.8 ± 4.7 U/l, LDH 184 ± 41 U/l, TBIL 0.09 
± 0.02 mg/dl, TBA 8 ± 7 µmol/l, BUN 30.4 ± 5.7 mg/dl 
and CRE 0.19 ± 0.04 mg/dl. As an early response to TAA 
administration, AST, ALT, and LDH were increased (Fig. 
1). Conversely, TBIL and TBA levels increased after 
relatively long-term TAA administration, possibly due 
to altered structure of the hepatic organs. Additionally, 
serum ALB level coupled with body weight tends to 
decrease, which could reflect chronic liver dysfunction. 
The marmosets that showed severe clinical signs had 
either high TBIL (>1 mg/dl), high TBA (>300 µmol/l) 
or low ALB (<3.5 g/dl). Following TAA cessation, TBIL 
and TBA levels rapidly recovered in most cases. BUN 
and CRE levels that represent renal function slightly 
changed during the experimental period.
Measurement results of blood type IV collagen 7S
We measured the serum level of type IV collagen 7S, 
which is known as a marker for hepatic fibrosis, in TAAtreated marmosets. As shown in Fig. 4, serum levels of 
type IV collagen 7S in TAA-treated marmosets with 
hepatic fibrosis observed on liver biopsy were 7.98 ± 
0.50 ng/ml (mean ± SD, n=5) and were significantly 
higher than those in the control group (6.30 ± 0.50 ng/
ml, n=3).
Discussion
Hepatic fibrosis is defined as the deposition of excess 
extracellular matrix and is based on complex interactions 
between matrix-producing hepatic stellate cells and 
abundant hepatic and infiltrating cells. Researching these 
pathologies and production processes requires in vitro
and in vivo experimental work in animals. Although 
hepatic fibrosis in humans can be caused by various 
stimuli (congenital, metabolic, inflammatory, parasitic, 
vascular, toxin, or drug), the molecular mechanisms 
underlying fibrosis are basically the same [8]. A highly 
regulated program of molecular changes occurs following any kind of liver injury [7]. In fibrosis research, 
experimental animal models are currently the gold standard to confirm a proposed disease-associated mechanism, and these models should at least partially mimic 
a clinical situation. The most commonly used approach 
for inducing toxin-mediated experimental liver fibrosis 
is the periodic administration of CCl4 or TAA in mice or 
rats [4]. However, there have been few reports of hepatic fibrosis models using nonhuman primates which

have advantages for preclinical translational research. 
This study succeeded reproducible induction of hepatic 
fibrosis using TAA in common marmosets. That is the 
first report of a potential liver fibrosis model using the 
small nonhuman primate species.
As it has been reported that intraperitoneal or oral 
administration of TAA reproducibly induced hepatic 
fibrosis in rodents, we first attempted to administer TAA 
in drinking water [10, 20]. However, marmosets did not 
drink water with TAA administration; hence, we selected subcutaneous injection as an alternative route of 
administration. Increased dosages could reduce modeling 
time but greatly increase the mortality rate. Our preliminary data demonstrated that a safe dosage for subcutaneous injection of TAA is<50 mg/kg (unpublished 
data). This study adopted the method of administering 
TAA subcutaneously at 40 mg/kg 2 or 3 times a week to 
establish a hepatic fibrosis model in common marmosets, 
which showed morphological and pathophysiological 
similarity to human hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, fibrosis sustained for up to 11 weeks after withdrawal of TAA. 
Therefore, 40 mg/kg should be an appropriate initial dose 
for subcutaneous injection of TAA for hepatic fibrosis 
in marmosets. In addition, it is considered appropriate 
to temporarily stop TAA administration when hepatic 
dysfunction occurs, and resume administration following 
hepatic function recovery until hepatic fibrosis occurs.
Histological examination by liver biopsy is the most 
accurate for estimating hepatic fibrosis but it is invasive. 
We found that blood levels of TBA, ALB, TBIL, and 
blood type IV collagen 7S could be useful markers for 
evaluating hepatic fibrosis. Simultaneous elevation of 
serum TBIL and TBA levels is a sign of acute hepatic 
failure. Serum TBIL and TBA levels could be good markers for determining whether we should administer TAA. 
It is considered appropriate to temporarily stop TAA 
administration when these serum markers indicate hepatic dysfunction occurs, and resume administration 
following hepatic function recovery until hepatic fibrosis occurs.
Type IV collagen is a main collagenous component of 
the basement membrane and the serum concentration of 
the 7S fragment of the N-terminal domain of type IV 
collagen (type IV collagen 7S) has been identified as a 
marker for assessing hepatic fibrogenesis and fibrosis 
[16, 19]. Serum type IV collagen 7S levels in the TAAinduced hepatic fibrosis marmosets were higher than 
control marmosets. This indicates monitoring this marker could aid in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in marmosets as in humans. The human cutoff value is 6.0 ng/
ml [13] but 7.0 ng/ml could be a good cutoff value for 
marmosets; however, further evaluation is necessary.
The study suggests that continuous TAA administration induces progressive and persistent hepatic fibrosis 
in the common marmoset. A hepatic fibrosis model of 
common marmosets with TAA could be widely used, 
and established models are promising for research on 
preventing and treating chronic liver diseases.
