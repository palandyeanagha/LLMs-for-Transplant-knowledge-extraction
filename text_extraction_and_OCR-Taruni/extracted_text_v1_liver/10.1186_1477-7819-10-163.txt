Abstract
Background: There is no definite agreement on the better therapy (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus surgical
resection (SR)) for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eligible for surgical treatments. The purpose of this study is
to evaluate the evidence using meta-analytical techniques.
Methods: A literature search was undertaken until December 2011 to identify comparative studies evaluating
survival rates, recurrence rates, and complications. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated with either the fixed or random effect model.
Results: Thirteen articles, comprising two randomized controlled trials(RCTs), were included in the review, with
a total of 2,535 patients (1,233 treated with SR and 1,302 with RFA). The overall survival rates were significantly
higher in patients treated with SR than RFA after1, 3, and 5 years (respectively: OR, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.86);
OR, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.65); OR, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.84)). In the SR group, the 1, 3, and 5 years recurrence rates
were significantly lower than the RFA group (respectively: OR, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.05 to 2.08); OR, 1.76 (95% CI, 1.49 to
2.08); OR, 1.68 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.34)). However, local recurrence between two groups did not exhibit significant
difference. For HCC ≤ 3 cm in diameter, SR was better than RFA at the 1, 3, and 5 years overall survival rates
(respectively: OR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.89); OR, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.84); OR, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.62)). This
meta-analysis indicated that the complication of SR was higher than RFA (OR, 6.25 (95%CI, 3.12 to 12.52); P = 0.000).
Conclusion: Although local recurrence between two groups did not exhibit significant difference, SR demonstrated
significantly improved survival benefits and lower complications for patients with early HCC, especially for
HCC ≤ 3 cm in diameter. These findings should be interpreted carefully, owing to the lower level of evidence.

Review
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most
common malignant tumor and the third leading cause
of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with an estimated
500,000 deaths per year [1-3]. In past decades, developments of medical devices and interventional techniques
have resulted in substantial opportunities for HCC early
diagnosis and therapy.
Current options for the treatment of the early HCC
conforming to the Milan criteria (single HCC ≤ 5 cm or
up to three nodules ≤ 3 cm), that is stage I, consist of
liver transplantation, surgical resection, transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and percutaneous
tumor ablation [4-7]. Theoretically, the best treatment is
liver transplantation [8-13]. However, the limited availability of suitable living donors, as well as an increased
waiting period, has raised the demand for treatment
strategies of early HCC, such as SR and local ablation
therapies. Comparison of different local ablative methods has shown that RFA is the most effective in terms
of both morbidity and the elimination of tumors locally
[14,15].

Some disputes, however, are reported about RFA and
SR. Huang et al. [16], Molinari et al. [17], and Takayama
et al. [18] reported that SR had more advantages
(survival and recurrence rates) regardless of tumor size
(larger or smaller than 3 cm; even smaller than 2 cm).
However,Chen et al. [19], Hong et al. [20], Vivarelli
et al. [21], and Montorsi et al. [22] concluded that
RFA was as effective as SR in the treatment of solitary
and small HCC. Additionally, Livraghi et al. [23] and
Nashikawa et al. [24] considered RFA the first-line treatment for small resectable HCCs.
Whether RFA or SR is the better treatment for early
HCC has long been debated. The aim of this review was
to examine survival and recurrence rates after RFA and
SR for HCC over the past decade.
Materials and methods
Literature search
Electronic searches were accomplished of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CENTRAL)
and EMBASE databases until December 2011. The
following MeSH search headings, all in English, were
used: surgical resection, hepatic resection or hepatectomy; radiofrequency, radio-frequency or catheter ablation; and liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (Gang Xu and Fuzhen Qi) independently
extracted the following parameters from each study:
(1) first author and year of the publication; (2) patients
characteristics, study design, and following-up; (3) clinical outcomes. Discrepancies between the two reviewers
were resolved by discussion. The quality of all selected
articles was ranked in accordance with Jadad score.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria for this study were as follows:(1) compare the initial therapeutic effects of RFA with or without
TACE and SR for the treatment of early HCC, despite the
etiology of liver disease, differences in viral hepatitis, or
cirrhotic status; (2) report at least one of the outcomes
mentioned below; (3) clearly document indications for
RFA and HR; (4) If two or more studies were reported by
the same authors in the same institution, either the study
of higher quality or the most recent publication was
included in the analysis. The primary endpoints were overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years. The secondary endpoints were disease-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years.
Criteria for exclusion: case reports, letters, abstracts,
editorials, expert opinions, studies lacking control
groups and reviews without original data were excluded.
The following studies were also excluded: (i) those dealing with liver metastases, recurrence after hepatectomy,
or unresectable HCC; (ii) those with no clearly reported
outcomes of interest; (iii) those treating patients coupling with cholangiocellular carcinomas.
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analyses were intended to explore important
clinical differences among trials that might be expected
to alter the magnitude of treatment effect. A subgroup
analysis was performed in this meta-analysis to consider
HCC with single nodules of diameter ≤3 cm.
Statistical analysis
We expressed results for dichotomous outcomes as odds
ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous outcome as weighted mean difference (WMD)
or standard mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was
explored by χ2 and I
2
. If the result of the heterogeneity
test was P > 0.1 and I
2 < 50%, ORs were pooled using
the fixed-effect model(Mantel-Haenszel), otherwise, the
random-effect model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used.
The significance of the pooled ORs was determined by
Z-test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of
funnel plots, in which the standard error of log(OR) of
each study was plotted against its log(OR). An asymmetric plot indicates a possible publication bias. The symmetry of the funnel plot was further evaluated by Begg’s
and Egger’s test. Statistical analysis was undertaken using
the Stata software (version11: StataCorp, Texas, USA).
Results
Study selection and characteristics
After initial screening, 49 potentially relevant clinical
trials of HCC were identified. Of these, 16 trials did
not analyze the results of RFA separately from the other
therapies, while 14 trials only focused on RFA. These
30 studies were excluded. Six trials were also excluded
as no information concerning overall survival after three
or five years was provided. A total of 13 studies (2 RCT
and 11 NRCTs) [16,19-21,24-32] published between
2000 and 2011 were included.
These studies included a total of 2,535 patients: 1,233
treated with RAF and 1,302 with SR. The mean age ranged from 49.2 ± 9.9 to 69.4 ± 9.1 years. The male: female
ratio in the pooled data was 2.57: 1. The median or
mean tumor size (cm) ranged from 1.8 to 3.8. The
median or mean duration of follow-up ranged from 22.7
to 847 months. The quality and characteristics of
included studies are shown in Table 1.
Meta-analysis results
Overall survival rates
The meta-analysis showed that there was a significant
difference in overall survival between the two groups at
one year(12 trials [16,19-21,24-27,29-32], with certain

heterogeneity), three years(13 trials [16,19-21,24-32],
without heterogeneity) and five years(10 trials [16,24-32],
without heterogeneity) and that the SR group was
favored (see Table 2).
Recurrence rates
Our results, as shown in Table 2, indicated that recurrence rates at one year(13 trials [16,19-21,24-32], without heterogeneity), three years(13 trials [16,19-21,24-32],
without heterogeneity) and five years(10 trials [16,24-32],
without heterogeneity) were significantly higher in the
RFA group than in the SR group. However, no differences were found between the two groups (4 trials
[16,20,24,30]) with respect to the local intrahepatic
recurrence (see Table 2).
Complications
The meta-analysis (7 trials [16,19,24,25,27,30,32] reported
these data) showed that there was significant difference
between the two groups (OR, 6.25 [95%CI, 3.12 to 12.52];
P = 0.000), without heterogeneity (see Table 2). The RFA
group was favored.
Subgroup analysis in HCCs ≤ 3 cm
The meta-analysis (6 trials [16,21,24,27-29] reported
these data) showed that the difference was significant
and favorable to the SR group at 1, 3 and 5 years
(respectively, OR, 0.34 [95%CI, 0.13 to 0.89]; OR, 0.56
[95%CI, 0.37 to 0.84]; OR, 0.44 [95%CI, 0.31 to 0.62]
(see Figures 1, 2, 3).
Sensitivity analysis
To compare the difference and evaluate the sensitivity of
the meta-analysis, we employed one-way sensitivity analysis to evaluate the stability of the meta-analysis. The
statistical significance of the results was not altered
when any single study was omitted (data not shown).

Therefore, results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that
the data in this meta-analysis are relatively robust.
Publication bias
Funnel plots (Figure 4) were created to assess possible
publication biases. In addition, Begg’s and Egger’s tests
were used to evaluate the symmetry of the plots. As
shown in Table 2, the data suggest that the funnel
plots were symmetrical, and that publication biases
might not have an evident influence on the results of the
meta-analyses.
Discussion
There is some dispute whether survival benefits of RFA
exist for patients with early HCC compared with SR.
This meta-analysis demonstrated that RFA with or without TACE was inferior to SR in terms of overall survival
rates and recurrence rates at one, three, and five years,
contrary to the opinion of Livraghi [23]. This may be
partly explained by advances in surgical and radiological
techniques and perioperative care, and by more cautious
patient selection [33,34]. This finding may also be
adversely impacted by the delay of surveillance in effective treatment using RFA [35,36].

A high rate of recurrence after treatment is the main
factor affecting overall survival and late death of patients
with HCC [37]. Reportedly, the risk factors for tumor
recurrence after treatment include tumor location,
tumor size, multinodular tumors, and an insufficient
safety margin [38-40]. Additionally, recurrences arise
because of pre-existing microscopic tumor foci that were
undetected by imaging modalities, or because malignant

cells disseminated during operation [41,42]. In this study,
recurrence was found to be more frequent after RFA
than SR. This may be a result of the safety margin of
RFA being narrower than that of SR, as SR usually
excises the entire Couinaud segments containing tumors
and possible venous tumor thrombus. In addition, high
rates of recurrence after RFA may result from insufficient
ablation of the primary tumor or the presence of tumor
venous invasion in the adjacent liver. As for local intrahepatic recurrence rates, the two groups had no difference. This may be due to the development of techniques
of RFA and an accurate evaluation of treatment response
via a sufficient safety margin (at least 0.5 cm).
This meta-analysis suggested that the incidence of
complications after RFA for HCC was lower than those
after the SR group as a result of the microinvasive
characterization of RFA. Radiofrequency ablation is a
minimally invasive, target-selective technique, which has
been applied in clinical studies in the 1990s [43]: it can
induce thermal lesions less than 2.5 to 3.5 cm in diameter, using single expandable-tip electrodes, which are
handled percutaneously and guided by imaging modalities [44]. This procedure could be performed under conscious sedation and the hospital stay is then shortened.
The subgroup analysis showed marked differences in
the overall survival rates between RFA and SR for
HCC≤ 3 cm after one, three, and five years. Considering
the fact that patients with single HCC≤ 3 cm in diameter
were at early stage without micro metastases and vascular invasion, SR can achieve better clinic outcomes. However, a lack of sufficient data on RCTs and an unequal
constitution of patients may also affect these findings.
The majority of the data in the present study came
from non-RCTs, so the overall level of clinical evidence
might be low. However, a firm conclusion about bias is
difficult to reach as the asymmetry of the funnel plot is
minimal. Therefore our pooled OR might be an overestimate of the true effect.
Conclusion
In conclusion, SR demonstrated significantly improved
survival benefits for patients with early HCC, especially
for HCC≤ 3 cm in diameter, although local recurrence
between two groups did not exhibit significant difference. However, the findings need to be carefully interpreted, owing to the lower level of evidence. Further
RCTs are warranted to clarify the exact value of SR and
RFA for early HCC, especially for single nodules ≤ 3 cm
in diameter.
