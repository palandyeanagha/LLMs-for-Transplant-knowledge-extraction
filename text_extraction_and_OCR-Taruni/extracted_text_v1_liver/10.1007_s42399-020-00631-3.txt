Abstract
The earliest evidence from China suggested that COVID-19 patients are even more vulnerable to succumbing from complications in the presence of a multimorbid status, including metabolic syndrome. Due to ongoing metabolic abnormalities, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) appears to be a potential risk factor for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing
related complications. This is because of the interplay of chronically active inflammatory pathways in NAFLD- and COVID-19-
associated acute cytokine storm. The risk of severe disease could also be attributed to compromised liver function as a result of
NAFLD. We systematically reviewed current literature to ascertain the relationship between NAFLD and severe COVID-19,
independent of obesity, which is considered the major factor risk factor for both NAFLD and COVID-19. We found that NAFLD
is a predictor of severe COVID-19, even after adjusting for the presence of obesity (OR 2.358; 95% CI: 1.902–2.923, p < 0.001).

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, transaminemia associated with
COVID-19 is associated with higher mortality [1]. The
initial reports from liver biopsies of COVID-19 patients
showed ballooning hepatocytes with mitotic cells and eosinophilic bodies, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 induces
apoptosis in liver cells [1]. Other authors have proposed
that the increased levels of inflammatory mediators, such
as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 levels, may further contribute to
damaging hepatocytes in COVID-19 patients [1]. Hepatic
steatosis is a commonly observed finding in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 [2]. The effect of fatty liver
on the severity of COVID-19 illness has not yet been
studied. We aim to systematically review published literature and evaluate the severity of COVID-19 in patients
with fatty liver.

Methods Results
The flow chart depicting the process of study screening is
presented in Fig. 1. An initial electronic search yielded 65
articles, and 3 others were identified via cross-reference
search. After excluding duplicates, 41 studies were found to
be eligible for screening their abstracts and full texts. Out of
the 41 screened, 23 were not relevant to our study, 5 were
review articles/editorials, and the rest did not contain extractable data. Eight studies were included in the quantitative analysis of the pooled odds ratio (OR). The total sample size
consisted of 8142 COVID-positive patients, out of which
833 patients had NAFLD. The characteristics of the included
studies are summarized in Table 1.
The pooled OR for severe COVID-19 in NAFLD, after
adjusting for obesity was 2.358 (95% CI: 1.902–2.923,
p < 0.001; Fig. 2). A minimal heterogeneity was identified in
the analysis. No significant differences were observed in the
leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for disease severity.
Discussion
Patients with pre-existing liver disorders, such as liver
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are considered to
have a higher susceptibility for any kind of infection and
sepsis secondary to impaired host defense [11].
Cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity also have
been identified as potential risk factors for mortality in
COVID-19 [12].

A systematic literature search of PUBMED, Google
Scholar, and SCOPUS databases was performed to identify studies reporting the association of fatty liver and
COVID-19 through September 9, 2020. Search key terms
employed were as follows: “NAFLD,” “metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD),” “fatty liver,”
“COVID-19,” and “SARS-COV2.” The reference lists of
these articles were also screened and hand-searched to
identify further relevant studies. Included studies assessed
the presence or absence of fatty liver by computed tomography (CT) or abdominal ultrasound coupled with an internal expert consensus statement to diagnose NAFLD.
The presence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Whenever available, we collected data on the risk COVID-19 and its severity in patients diagnosed with fatty liver. Severe COVID-19 was
defined in most studies using guidelines laid down by the
National Health Commission of China. Other outcomes
included were hospitalization and ICU admission, as mentioned in Table 1. We included studies that reported OR
for severe COVID-19 in patients with NAFLD/MAFLD
after adjusting for obesity. Data on the odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (CI) were collected and
pooled to compute the pooled odds ratio using randomeffects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I
2
test, and I
2 of > 50% was considered a moderate interstudy variation. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using the
OpenMetaAnalyst software.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD (also known as
metabolic associated fatty liver disease, MAFLD), is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome,
which encompasses obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance [13]. It is understandable that due to these concurrent issues, NAFLD would predispose to severe COVID19. A multicenter retrospective study by Zheng et al. further
validated this information. They showed that obesity conferred a ~ sixfold higher risk of severe COVID-19 in patients
with NAFLD. The OR for the severity of COVID-19 illness

was 6.32 in obese NAFLD patients than in non-obese patients
with NAFLD [14].
However, our pooled analysis points out yet another interesting observation about COVID-19 and fatty liver disease.
We found that NAFLD was associated with an increased risk
of severe COVID-19, even after adjusting for obesity as a
possible confounding factor. We believe that liver fat and
associated inflammation could exacerbate the virusassociated cytokine storm, leading to worsening COVID-19.
Targher et al. found that increasing liver fibrosis measured by

Conclusions
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with a higher
risk of symptomatic, severe, and progressive COVID-19.
The association is significant even after adjusting for an important confounding factor, obesity. Hence, it can be concluded that the hepatic manifestation of COVID-19 is independently linked to the severity of coronavirus disease.
However, the exact relationship between liver fat and
COVID-19 remains to be elucidated.

NFS/FIB-4 score was linked to increased severity of disease in
COVID-19 patients [4]. Moreover, liver fat has been independently linked to an increased risk of testing positive for
COVID-19 [15]. A study showed that NAFLD was independently associated with a significant ALT elevation after
adjusting for BMI and other factors [16].
Hence, it is conceivable that injury caused by fat accumulation in the liver and subsequent fibrosis could be one of the
plausible reasons for the poor disease course observed in patients with NAFLD.
