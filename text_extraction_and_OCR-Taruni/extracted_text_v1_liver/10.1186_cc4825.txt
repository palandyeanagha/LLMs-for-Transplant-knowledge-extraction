Abstract
Treatment in the intensive care unit of patients with end-stage liver
disease has been limited. Liver transplantation has been a major
improvement in this and has become standard in the management
of these patients. However, many patients die awaiting liver
transplantation, mainly due to the scarcity of organ donors.
Conventional hemodialysis techniques have little or no effect on
liver detoxification and do not improve the prognosis of these
patients. In patients with acute hepatic failure, the majority of
endogenous toxins leading to organ failure and accumulating in the
blood are bound to albumin; therefore, the concept of albumin
dialysis is of major interest. To date, the most widely developed
system has been the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
(MARS®), which is based on the selective removal of albuminbound toxins from the blood. MARS® enables simultaneous liver
and kidney detoxification, improving the patient's clinical condition.
It is a major improvement in the management of patients with
hepatic failure that could permit, when appropriately indicated,
recovery from an acute episode and enhance the chances of
survival while waiting for an available organ donor.
Introduction
During the past decades, few therapeutic measures have
been developed for the treatment of patients with end-stage
liver disease. Despite a great improvement in the field of
transplantation, the mortality in patients developing hepatic
failure remains very high and many patients die while awaiting
liver transplantation. In recent years, a major interest has been
the replacement of the liver by extracorporeal systems that
may provide a lifeline until a spontaneous recovery of the liver
or until an appropriate donor is available. Many non-biological
liver support therapies based on detoxification of the patient’s
blood have been developed. These include standard or highflux hemodialysis, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or
hemodiafiltration, charcoal perfusion, hemadsorption with
non-biological adsorbents and plasma or blood exchange
[1-4]. To date, the most widely developed system has been
the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS®),
which uses albumin dialysis to mainly replace the
detoxification function of the liver. Two other systems using a
similar approach have been developed recently, the
Prometheus® and the Single-Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD®)
systems; few patients have been treated with these systems
to date, but their results could be promising [5,6].
Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
MARS® is a liver support system that uses an albuminenriched dialysate to facilitate the removal of albumin-bound
toxins. The system has three different fluid compartments: a
blood circuit, a circuit containing 600 ml of 20% human
albumin with a charcoal column and an anion exchange resin
column and a dialysate circuit [7]. MARS® requires a
standard dialysis machine or a continuous veno-venous
hemodiafiltration device (CCVVHD) to control the blood and
dialysate circuits.
MARS® has been used in the intensive care unit in most
clinical situations of hepatic failure [8,9]. The main indications
of treatment with MARS® are now better established but they
need further validation; they are summarized in Table 1.
Efficacy results
In patients suffering from acute decompensation on
chronic liver disease
MARS® has already been the object of three prospective
randomized studies to evaluate its short-term benefits in
patients suffering from acute decompensation on chronic
liver disease. Mitzner and colleagues [10] randomized 13
patients with hepato-renal syndrome, 8 in the MARS® group
and 5 in a control group. Mortality was 100% in the control
group and 75% in the MARS® treated group (p < 0.01).
Effectiveness was also demonstrated by the increase in

arterial pressure and the urinary volume, and the decrease in
creatininemia and bilirubinemia. In a second clinical trial,
Heemann and colleagues [11] randomized 24 patients with
severe cholestasis (bilirubin > 20 mg/dl) not improving after 3
to 5 days of standard medical therapy (SMT) in two groups,
SMT versus SMT plus MARS®. The determining factors for
acute decompensation were infection, drug intoxication,
hemorrhage and alcohol abuse. The results showed a
significant difference (p < 0.05) in the 30-day survival rate in
favor of the MARS® group: 6 deaths in the SMT group
(survival = 50%) against only one in the MARS® group
(survival = 91%). Effectiveness was also shown by
improvements in hepatic-encephalopathy and arterial
pressure, and a decrease in bilirubinemia, biliary acids, and
creatininemia. Recently, the results of a prospective
randomized multicenter study including 70 patients with
grade 3 and 4 hepatic encephalopathy have been presented
with the primary objective of decreasing by two stages the
degree of encephalopathy after five days of therapy [12]. The
study showed a significant improvement in the degree of
encephalopathy in 64% of the patients treated with MARS®
and 38% of the control group (p = 0.04). In particular,
ammonia levels were significantly reduced in patients treated
with MARS®.
Other uncontrolled studies have shown a beneficial effect of
MARS® in severe cholestatic liver disease [13], acute alcoholic
hepatitis [14], hypoxic liver [15], and graft dysfunction after
liver transplantation [16].
In patients with acute fulminant liver failure
Several uncontrolled studies have been performed using
MARS® in patients with acute fulminant liver failure, showing
improvements in encephalopathy, a decrease in intracranial
pressure, and an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure,
mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistances
and cardiac index [17,18]. Currently we are undertaking a
prospective controlled, randomized, multicenter study in
patients suffering from fulminant hepatitis to evaluate the
beneficial effect of MARS® on survival with or without
transplantation.
Safety
As MARS® treatment uses the same blood-contacting tubes
and membranes that are used extensively in 24 h hemodiafiltration treatment in intensive care unit patients and the
dialysate solution is supplemented with approved human
albumin that has no ability to cross the hemofilter membrane
and to enter the patients blood, the risks of the treatment are
limited to all known risks of conventional hemodialysis. These
risks may be related to catheter problems or inadequate
anticoagulation. In patients with end-stage liver disease,
however, coagulopathy disorders are frequent and the risk of
bleeding is increased. Faybik and colleagues [19] observed
that although MARS® can lead to a further decrease in
platelet count and fibrinogen concentration, platelet function,
measured by thromboclastography, remains stable and, in
particular, MARS® did not enhance fibrinolysis.
Conclusion
The concept of albumin dialysis in patients with end-stage
liver disease is a novel approach. Albumin dialysis with
MARS® has demonstrated interesting results in controlled
and uncontrolled trials in improving hepatic encephalopathy
and short-term survival. It has a good safety profile similar to
the CVVHD techniques. Technical improvements and
randomized controlled trials focusing on specific indications
are still needed to evaluate the impact of these therapies in
medical practice.
