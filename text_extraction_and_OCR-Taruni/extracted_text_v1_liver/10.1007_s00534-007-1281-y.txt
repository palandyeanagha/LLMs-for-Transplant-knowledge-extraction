Abstract
The purpose of radiation therapy for unresectable biliary tract 
cancer is to prolong survival or prolong stent patency, and to 
provide palliation of pain. For unresectable bile duct cancer, 
there are a number of studies showing that radiation therapy 
is superior to the best supportive care. Although radiation 
therapy is used in many institutions, no large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to date and the 
evidence level supporting the superiority of this treatment is 
low. Because long-term relief of jaundice is difficult without 
using biliary stenting, a combination of radiation therapy and 
stent placement is commonly used. As radiation therapy, 
external-beam radiation therapy is usually performed, but 
combined use of intraluminal brachytherapy with external 
beam radiation therapy is more useful for making the treatment more effective. There are many reports demonstrating 
improved response rates as well as extended survival and time 
to recurrence achieved by this combination therapy. Despite 
the low level of the evidence, this combination therapy is 
performed at many institutions. It is expected that multiinstitutional RCTs will be carried out. Unresectable gallbladder cancer with a large focus is usually extensive, and normal 
organs with high radio sensitivity exist contiguously with it. 
Therefore, only limited anticancer effects are to be expected 
from external beam radiation therapy for this type of cancer. 
The number of reports on ampullary cancer is small and the 
role of radiation therapy in this cancer has not been established. Combination treatment for ampullary cancer consists 
of either a single use of intraoperative radiation therapy, postoperative external beam radiation therapy or intraluminal 
brachytherapy, or a combination of two or three of these therapies. Intraoperative radiation therapy is superior in that it 
enables precise irradiation to the target site, thereby protecting adjacent highly radiosensitive normal tissues from irradiation. There are reports showing extended survival, although 
not significant, in groups undergoing intraoperative or postoperative radiation therapy compared with groups without 
radiation therapy. To date, there are no reports of large RCTs 
focusing on the significance of radiation therapy as a postoperative adjuvant treatment, so its usefulness as a postoperative 
adjuvant treatment is not proven. An alternative treatment is 
photodynamic therapy. There is an RCT demonstrating that, 
in unresectable bile duct cancer, extended survival and 
improved quality of life (QOL) have been achieved through 
a combination of photodynamic therapy and biliary stenting, 
compared with biliary stenting alone. Results from large RCTs 
are desired.

Introduction
At present, the proportion of patients with curable early 
biliary tract cancer is small and the prognosis of this 
cancer remains poor as a whole. Early detection is a key 
element to improve its prognosis. However, the proportion of patients with advanced cancer is very large, so 
treatments are essential for residual lesions after resection and for nonresected patients. In biliary tract cancer, 
radiation therapy and other therapies are being performed for inoperative disease, for recurrence after 
resection, and for residual lesions after resection. Only 
few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large 
numbers of patients have been conducted, so standard 
radiation therapy for this cancer has not been 
established.

64 H. Saito et al.: Radiation therapy and photodynamic therapy for biliary cancer 
Biliary tract cancers are low-radiosensitive adenocarcinomas and occur in deep-seated organs. Furthermore, 
normal tissues with higher radiosensitivity exist contiguously with the diseased sites. For these reasons, radiation 
therapy has not been considered as a good indication 
for these cancers. Since the prolonged survival achieved 
by 30- to 60-Gy external beam radiation therapy was 
reported in the 1970s, in addition to intraoperative 
radiation therapy, postoperative radiation therapy, and 
intra luminal brachytherapy, combinations of external 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy have come into 
use. Subsequently, reports began to appear showing prolonged survival due to biliary tract drainage plus radiation therapy for unresectable cancers. Also, intraluminal 
radiation therapy combined with drainage tubes is being 
used actively to enhance anticancer effects. There are 
many reports demonstrating improved treatment results 
with this combination, and opinions supporting its usefulness are prevailing, despite the low level of evidence 
to prove its effectiveness.
A number of studies show the usefulness of radiation 
therapy for biliary tract cancer, but most of these studies 
are small prospective or retrospective studies, so studies 
that confer high-level evidence are limited. Thus, radiation therapy is not a standard treatment in biliary tract 
cancer. As a rule, pathological diagnosis should be 
determined prior to the institution of treatment. The 
frequency of occurrence of biliary tract cancer is low. 
Implementation of large multi-institutional RCTs is 
desired.
Here we pose clinical questions (CQs) on radiation 
therapy in biliary tract cancer, with responses in the 
form of recommendations (grades of the recommendaCQ 1 Is radiation therapy recommended for patients 
with an unresectable biliary tract cancer?
For patients with an unresectable biliary tract cancer, 
radiation therapy may be used (recommendation C1).
The aim of radiation therapy for unresectable biliary 
tract cancer is to achieve prolonged survival or stent 
patency, and palliation of pain. Although there are many 
studies reporting the usefulness of, radiation therapy for 
this disease, the evidence level is low because no large 
RCTs have been conducted to date.2 The main symptom 
of biliary tract cancer is obstructive jaundice. However, 
radiation therapy is not short-acting, so priority is given 
to biliary drainage. On the other hand, long-term relief 
of jaundice is difficult without biliary stenting3
 (level V) 
and a combination of stent placement and radiation 
therapy is used.
Only a small number of studies have reported radiation therapy for unresectable gallbladder cancer and 
ampullary cancer, so its significance is not sufficiently 
proven.
A large number of studies have reported a survival 
benefit with radiation therapy for unresectable bile duct 
cancer in comparison with other palliative treatments 
or best supportive care4,5 (level IV). External beam 
radiation therapy is a commonly used type of radiation 
therapy. External irradiation exceeding 50 Gy leads to 
the increased occurrence of complications in nearby 
organs such as digestive organs. In view of the higher 
frequency of low-radiosensitive adenocarcinomas in 
biliary tract cancer, a dosage of less than 50 Gy is not 
sufficient for local control. To achieve more effective 
radiation therapy, boosted treatment, such as intraluminal brachytherapy (see CQ 2) and intraoperative radiation therapy, should be administered. It is highly frequent 
that use of intraluminal brachytherapy through the 
drainage catheters in patients in whom an internal 
fistula has formed.6

H. Saito et al.: Radiation therapy and photodynamic therapy for biliary cancer 65
In unresectable bile duct cancer, many reports show 
the superiority of radiation therapy over the best 
supportive care. However, due to the lack of multiinstitutional RCTs, the strength of recommendation for 
radiation therapy is only C1 at present. Although standard radiation therapy has not been established in bile 
duct cancer, it is recommendable because prolonged 
survival is observed more often in patients with this 
cancer with a combination of external beam radiation 
therapy and intraluminal brachytherapy than with the 
single use of radiation therapy.6 The advantages of 
radiation therapy include prolonged stent patency and 
palliation of pain, with local cancer control. Explanations of the benefits and drawbacks of radiation therapy 
should be given to patients when decisions on treatment policies are made for those with incurable 
disease.
In unresectable biliary tract cancer, attempts at combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy are being 
made to enhance radiosensitivity in radiation therapy, 
to control metastatic lesions, and to prevent metastasis. 
However, there is no RCT comparing the single use of 
radiation therapy and its combined use with chemotherapy. Foo et al.7 performed a small nonrandomized 
trial, in which the combination of external beam radiation therapy and intraluminal brachytherapy plus systemic administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was used; 
they found that an improved survival rate was achieved 
in the group for which the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was used (level III). For combination regimens, 5-FU alone, 5-FU plus mitomycin C 
(MMC), MMC alone, and cisplatin (CDDP) plus 5-FU 
are reported (9–58 patients; median survival period, 8–
30 months),2 but no recommendable regimen has been 
determined yet. Although there are many reports on the 
systemic administration of anticancer drugs for biliary 
tract cancer, intraarterial fusion chemotherapy has also 
been attempted.
There are reports demonstrating the efficacy of combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy for 
biliary tract cancer, but combining radiation therapy 
with chemotherapy as a standard is not always better 
than radiation therapy alone. In advanced cases of other 
gastrointestinal cancers, such as esophageal carcinoma8
and pancreatic cancer,9,10 there are studies showing that 
combination treatment of radiation therapy and chemotherapy is superior to radiation therapy alone, so the 
combination is thought to be a therapeutic modality 
worthy of consideration in biliary tract cancer. However, 
the efficacy of the combination of radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer will have to be 
demonstrated by conducting RCTs at some future 
date.
CQ 2 Is intraluminal brachytherapy recommended 
for nonresected biliary tract cancer?
For radiation therapy of bile duct cancer, many 
reports demonstrate the usefulness of a combination 
of external beam radiation therapy with intraluminal 
brachytherapy than those seen with external beam 
radiation therapy alone (recommendation C1).
External beam radiation therapy is generally used for 
bile duct cancer. Organs such as the digestive tract, liver, 
and kidney are included in the radiation field, so a 
dosage exceeding 50 Gy leads to the increased occurrence of complications. In general, a dosage exceeding 
80 Gy enables tumor control, so boosted therapy such 
as intraluminal brachytherapy is required to deliver that 
dosage.6 Intraluminal brachytherapy has the advantage 
of enabling the delivery of a sufficient dosage to the 
target focus, while reducing the influence of irradiation 
on the surrounding tissues. Therefore, a combination of 
intraluminal brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy contributes to increased effects of radiation therapy, with fewer adverse effects than those seen 
with external beam radiation therapy alone.
There are studies reporting that an improved response 
rate and an extended time to recurrence and survival 
were achieved by the combination of intraluminal 
brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy for 
bile duct cancer6,11–15 (level IV). On the other hand, there 
are also studies that failed to find a difference in the 
survival period compared with that shown with external 
beam radiation therapy alone14–16 (level IV). Thus, there 
is a low level of evidence that the combination of external beam radiation therapy with intraluminal brachytherapy contributes to improved treatment results. 
However, opinions that the combination of intraluminal 
brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy is 
an effective modality of radiation therapy for bile duct 
cancer are tending to prevail, and the combination is 
widely used in many institutions. In reality, most cases 
of bile duct cancer are advanced cancers and they are 
large in size. Therefore, improvement in the local control 
rate is not expected, but local control is possible with 
intraluminal brachytherapy in small-sized tumors17 
(level V). Also, when the combination of external beam 
radiation therapy and intraluminal brachytherapy is 
used, attention should be paid to the occurrence of complications such as digestive tract hemorrhage and bile 
duct fistula.17,18
The combination of intraluminal brachytherapy and 
external beam radiation therapy (see Fig. 1 for representative results) for unresectable bile duct cancer 
confers a better survival rate than treatment with a 
single modality.2 However, due to the lack of large

bination of external beam radiation therapy (mean total 
dosage, 46 Gy) and intraluminal brachytherapy with 
192-Ir (mean dosage, 13 Gy) was administered. No significant extended survival or usefulness of the radiation 
therapy was observed, with the median survival period 
being 14 months for the treatment group and 15 months 
for the no-treatment group (level III). On the other 
hand, Gerhards et al.20 carried out operation alone for 
20 patients, postoperative external beam radiation 
therapy alone for 30 patients (mean dosage, 46 Gy), and 
a combination of postoperative external beam radiation 
therapy (mean dosage, 42 Gy) and intraluminal brachytherapy (mean dosage, 10 Gy) for 41 patients, in a total 
of 91 patients with resected bile duct cancer. They found 
significantly extended survival in the radiation group 
(24 months) compared with the nonradiation group (8 
months) (level IV). Also, a report has demonstrated 
similar survival with postoperative radiation therapy for 
patients with cholangiocarcinoma with a positive biliary 
resection margin compared with those with a negative 
margin.21
Intraoperative radiation therapy enables accurate 
irradiation to the target focus and exclusion of the surrounding high-radio-sensitive tissues from the irradiation field. Because increased dosage per irradiation and 
an enlarged irradiation field lead to the increased occurrence of complications, combined use of intraoperative 
radiation therapy with postoperative external beam 
radiation therapy is carried out. There are several studies 
reporting that prolonged survival was achieved by the 
combination treatment of intraoperative and postoperative irradiation in bile duct and gallbladder cancers22–25
(level IV).
In ampullary carcinoma, the role of radiation therapy 
is not known, because, as Abrams et al.26 reported in 
their study, a combination of radiation therapy with cheCQ 3 Is intraoperative and/or postoperative 
radiation therapy recommended for resected biliary 
tract cancer?
Intraoperative and/or postoperative radiation 
therapy may be considered for patients with biliary 
tract cancer for whom noncurative resection has been 
conducted (recommendation C2).
The rate of local recurrence is high even in patients with 
resected biliary tract cancer. Postoperative radiation 
therapy is occasionally performed for resected patients 
to improve the local control rate. However, the signifi -
cance of postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy has 
not been reported in large controlled trials. In regard to 
the modality of radiation therapy employed, intraoperative radiation therapy, postoperative external beam 
radiation therapy, and/or intraluminal brachytherapy 
are performed, alone or in combination with each other. 
However, no consensus has been reached to date concerning which modality could be a standard adjuvant 
combination treatment after resection.
Pitt et al.19 conducted a prospective study of the effi -
cacy of radiation therapy in 50 patients with bile duct 
cancer in whom they confirmed, during operation, that 
no distant metastasis was present. Comparison and discussion of treatment results were made by randomly 
assigning the 31 resected patients and 19 nonresected 
patients into a group of patients for whom radiation 
therapy was given (n = 23) and a group of patients for 
whom no radiation therapy was given (n = 27). A com-

photodynamic therapy and stenting and reported that 
the mean survival period was 15.9 months and median 
survival period was 9.9 months, but that no significant 
extended survival was achieved, compared with 12.5 
months and 5.6 months, respectively, for the historical 
control group. However, according to their report, QOL 
was maintained in many patients, with 30-day and 60-
day mortality rates being 0% for both the patient and 
historical control groups (level IV). According to the 
authors’ discussion, the absence of a significant difference in survival period may have been due to the markedly extended survival period achieved in the historical 
control group compared with that in the group receiving 
biliary tract stenting alone. In a study of 24 patients 
conducted by Shim et al.,31 the 1-year survival rate was 
59.6% and the median survival period was 558 ± 178.8 
days. Furthermore, they found a significant reduction in 
the thickness of tumors measured by intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS), from 8.7 ± 3.7 mm at 4 months 
before treatment to 5.8 ± 2.0 mm at 4 months after treatment, and they also reported that improvement in the 
Karnofsky status was demonstrated (level IV).
In summary, combination treatment of photodynamic 
therapy and biliary tract stenting contributes to extended 
survival and improved QOL. However, it is not strongly 
recommended at this time due to the paucity of cases 
studied in RCTs. Results are awaited from large RCTs 
to be performed in the future.

(Nagoya).
CQ 4 Is photodynamic therapy recommended for 
unresectable biliary tract cancer?
There are reports demonstrating the usefulness of 
photodynamic therapy and it may be used for 
unresectable bile duct cancer (recommendation C1).
For photodynamic therapy for unresectable bile duct 
cancer, there are two reports of RCTs and three reports 
of phase II studies.
The two reports of RCTs compared combination 
treatment of biliary tract stenting with photodynamic 
therapy and biliary tract stenting alone. Ortner et al.27
reported that significant prolongation was achieved in 
the median survival period (493 days vs 98 days) and 
that QOL was good (level II). However, the trial was 
discontinued because of the recommendation that 
biliary tract stenting alone failed to produce a good 
prognosis. Zoepf et al.28 reported significant prolongation of the median survival period (21 months vs 7 
months) (level II). These two RCTs were small trials 
with 20 vs 19 patients and 16 vs 16 patients, 
respectively.
Three phase II studies of photodynamic therapy 
for unresectable bile duct cancer have been published. 
Berr et al.29 administered photodynamic therapy to 23 
patients and found that a 6-month survival rate after 
diagnosis was achieved in 91% of the patients, a median 
survival period was 11-month, the 30-day mortality rate 
was 4%, and local tumor response (partial response 
[PR]) was achieved in 13%; thus, they concluded that 
QOL was good and photodynamic therapy was useful 
(level IV). Dumoulin et al.30 treated 24 patients with 
motherapy is often used, and patients with pancreatic 
cancers are included in most studies.
In the surgical treatment of biliary tract cancer, the 
resection that aims curability does not rare become 
incurable based on the final histopathological findings.26
However, no clinical studies have been conducted 
concerning postoperative radiation therapy for these 
patients, so no definite consensus has been reached. 
There are some studies demonstrating the usefulness of 
intraoperative and postoperative radiation therapy for 
resected cancers of the gallbladder and bile duct, but 
there is no evidence that can lead to the recommendation of radiation therapy as a standard treatment. Thus, 
radiation therapy may be considered for patients who 
have undergone noncurative resection.
It should be made clear by RCTs in future whether 
intraoperative and postoperative irradiation for patients 
who have undergone resection of biliary tract cancer 
contributes to an improved survival.
