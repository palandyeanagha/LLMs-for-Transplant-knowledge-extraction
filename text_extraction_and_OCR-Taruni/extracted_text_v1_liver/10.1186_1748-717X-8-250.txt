Abstract
Background: Recent studies using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have
reported high tumor response and local control. However, the optimal SBRT dose remains unknown, and it is still
not clear whether a dose response relationship for local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) exist or not. We
performed this study to determine whether a dose response relationship for LC and OS is observed in SBRT for
inoperable HCC.
Methods: Between 2003 and 2011, 108 patients with HCC were treated with SBRT. All patients were unsuitable for
surgery or local ablation and had incomplete response to transarterial chemoembolization. Eighty-two patients with
a longest tumor diameter (LD) less than or equal to 7.0 cm who were treated with 3-fraction SBRT and were
analyzed. This cohort comprised 74 Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A patients and 8 CTP class B7 patients. The
median LD was 3.0 cm (range, 1.0–7.0 cm), and the median dose was 51 Gy (range, 33–60 Gy).
Results: LC and OS rates at 2 years after SBRT were 87% and 63%, respectively, with a median follow-up duration of 30
months for all patients. The 2-year LC/OS rates for patients treated with doses of > 54, 45–54, and < 45 Gy were 100/71,
78/64, and 64%/30%, respectively (p = .009/p < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the SBRT dose (p = .005) and
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (p = .015) were significant prognostic factors for OS. Correlation analysis revealed a
positive linear relationship between the SBRT dose and LC (p = .006, R = .899)/OS (p = .002, R = .940) at 2 years. Based
on the tumor-control probability model, a dose of 54.8 Gy provides 2-year LC with a 90% probability. Five patients
experienced grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxicity, and 6 had deteriorating of CTP score by greater than or equal to
2 within 3 months of SBRT.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated a dose response relationship for LC and OS with SBRT for HCC. Higher LC rates
resulting from an increased dose may translate into survival benefits for patients with HCC.

Background
Liver cancer is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, but the it was the second most frequent
cause of cancer death in 2008 [1]. The treatment of
choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery,
but less than 20% of patients are suitable for surgery
[2-5]. For patients with inoperable HCC, radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and other ablative therapies achieve
excellent local control (LC) for small tumors. However,
not all patients are suitable for these local therapies because of a large tumor size, tumor location, unmanageable coagulopathy, or invisibility on ultrasonography
[6-8]. For patients with HCC unsuitable for local ablative
therapies, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had
been widely used as the first line non-curative therapy
[9]. Radiotherapy (RT) has typically not been considered
a frontline treatment for HCC due to the lower
tolerance of the whole liver to RT [10]. However,
some recent studies reported favorable outcomes for
three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for
HCC [11-14].
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an external
beam RT method used to very precisely deliver a high
dose of radiation to an extracranial target within the
body using either a single fraction or a small number of
fractions [15]. As the liver obeys the parallel architecture
model of radiobiology, the risk of radiation-induced liver
disease (RILD) is generally proportional to the mean
dose of radiation delivered to normal liver tissue [16-18].
Several studies using SBRT for liver tumors have been
performed, and these studies reported high tumor response and LC rates [19-24]. We previously reported
our results from phase I and II trials of SBRT for HCC
and observed high LC rates and low severe toxicity rates
[25,26]. Due to the small number of patients in each
study, we were unable to determine the optimal dose for
LC, or clarify a dose response relationship for local control and overall survival. In this study, we expanded our
previous study to include more cases of SBRT for HCC
and analyzed additional data to determine whether a
dose response relationship for local control and overall
survival is observed in SBRT for inoperable HCC.

Methods
Patients
Between March 2003 and February 2011, 108 patients
with 122 HCC lesions were treated with SBRT, and the
medical records of these patients were retrospectively
reviewed. This study was approved by the institutional
review board of our institution. These patients included
those who previously participated in phase I (n = 38)
and II (n = 47) trials and additional patients (n = 23)
who refused to participate in prospective clinical trials.
The study eligibility criteria were previously reported
[25,26]. All patients had diseases unsuitable for surgery
or local ablation and underwent TACE before SBRT.
Only patients with incomplete response to TACE were
treated with SBRT and enrolled in this study. Incomplete
response to TACE was defined as incomplete tumor filling by the lipiodol-doxorubicin mixture used by response evaluation computed tomography (CT) images at
the 1 month after adequately performed TACE or increasing alpha-fetoprotein level. All patients provided
written informed consent after receiving an explanation
concerning the possible benefits and complications of
SBRT versus 3D-CRT. The 23 patients who refused to
participate in clinical trials also selected SBRT and they
were treated using the same method as those in the clinical trials. In this study, only lesions treated with SBRT

in 3 fractions were analyzed to avoid introducing confounding effect or errors from converting the biologically
equivalent dose (BED) between different fractionations. In
addition, only lesions with a longest tumor diameter
(LD) ≤ 7.0 cm were analyzed to avoid introducing bias
from the inclusion of extremely large tumors. Twenty-six
patients with 27 lesions were excluded for following reasons: (1) SBRT with more than 3 fractions in 22 patients
with 23 lesions and (2) LD > 7.0 cm in 4 patients with 4
lesions. In total, 82 patients with 95 lesions were analyzed.
The patient and tumor characteristics are shown in
Table 1. Fifty-four (66%) patients were diagnosed with recurrent disease. A recurrent disease is defined as a return
of cancer after curative treatment, that is surgery, local ablations, and after a period of time during which the cancer
cannot be detected. Seventy-four (90%) patients had
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A disease, and 8 (10%)
had CTP class B7 disease. All patients underwent TACE
before SBRT and 44 patients (54%) underwent 1 or 2 sessions. Eleven patients (13%) had multiple hepatic lesions
and all of the lesions were treated with SBRT in 1 session.
The median LD was 3.0 cm (range, 1.0–7.0 cm). All patients received no further treatment after SBRT, if no progression was observed. The patients with intrahepatic or
extrahepatic progression received customized salvage treatment. Thirty-one patients were treated with TACE, 10 with
RFA, 1 with percutaneous ethanol injection, 2 with surgical
resection, 1with liver transplantation, 12 with sorafenib, 2
with chemotherapy othan than sorafenib, and 6 with SBRT
at progression.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy
The SBRT technique used at our institution has been previously described [25,26]. Briefly, patients were immobilized
with a customized external vacuum-type (Vac-Loc; MedTec, Inc., Orange City, IA). Breathing-related tumor motion was minimized by abdominal compression using 4
belts [27]. Gold fiducials (4 mm x 0.8 mm) or lipiodol
deposits in the tumor were used to mark tumors for
SBRT. Daily image guidance using orthogonal ×-ray imaging or on-board CT was used to relocalize the target lesion before treatment delivery. A CT image was taken
with a slice thickness of 2 mm at 3 seconds per slice.
These relatively slow CT images included the respiratory
movement of the target; therefore, the tumor volume used
for planning was larger than the gross tumor volume
(GTV) and was referred to as the internal target volume
(ITV) [28,29]. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the ITV + 4 mm in the craniocaudal direction
and the ITV + 2 mm in all other directions [30]. SBRT
doses were prescribed at an isodose line (70–80% of the
maximum dose) that covered at least 97% of the PTV.
The SBRT doses were escalated from 33 Gy in 3 fractions to 60 Gy in 3 fractions in our previous study. The
final prescribed doses were 60 Gy in 3 fractions, but the
dosages were reduced by 0.5 or 1 Gy per fraction until
normal tissue constraints were allowed. We adopted the
normal tissue constraint that at least 700 ml of normal
liver (entire liver minus the cumulative GTV) should
not receive a total dose ≥ 15 (phase I) or ≥ 17 Gy
(phase II). For the spinal cord, the maximum dose
should not exceed 18 (phase I) or 22 Gy and 18 Gy to
0.25 ml or less of irradiated volume (phase II). For the
esophagus the maximum dose should not exceed 24 Gy.
In addition, although other normal tissue constraints
were not considered, dosages to the kidneys, intestine,
and stomach were restricted to the lowest level possible. SBRT was administered in a 3-fraction course
over no more than 14 elapsed days.
Evaluation and statistical analysis
Treatment response was assessed using modified Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [31]. Toxicities were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Classic RILD was defined as the presence of anicteric ascites and an at least twofold elevation in alkaline
phosphatase relative levels to the pretreatment value in the
absence of tumor progression [32]. Non-classic RILD was
defined as elevated transaminase levels (> 5× the upper limit
of normal) or NCI-CTCAE grade 4 levels in patients with
baseline levels more than 5 times the upper limit of normal
range, within 3 months after the completion of SBRT, or deterioration of the CTP score by ≥ 2, in the absence of classic
RILD [33]. LC was defined as no tumor progression during
follow-up and determined via post-SBRT radiographic studies. LC and overall survival (OS) rates (from the first date of
SBRT treatment) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and intergroup comparisons were performed using
the log-rank test. All factors with p-value lower than or
equal to 0.1 in univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards regression
model with a forward, stepwise procedure to determine
whether factors acted independently. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS statistical software (version
12.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and p-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Tumor control probability model
The tumor control end point was LC at the 2-year time
point. Doses to individual lesions were divided into 6

bins; the x-axis represented the mean dose given in that
bin, whereas the y-axis value represented the probability
of LC. The tumor control probability (TCP) for each bin
was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Quantification of the dose response to the tumor was estimated
using the logistic model as follows [34].

where D refers to the total dose, γ describes the slope of

by logit functions. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were found using the probability density function of normal distribution. The formula was implemented using
MATLAB R2011b (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).
Results
Local control
The median follow-up duration after SBRT for all patients was 30 months (range, 4–81 months). In all lesions, the 2- and 5-year LC rates were 87 and 82%,
respectively (Figure 1(a)). Univariate analysis identified
age, number of previous TACE sessions, American Joint
Committee on Cancer clinical T stage, Barcelona Clinic
Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, SBRT dose, and LD as significant prognostic factors for LC (Table 2). The 2-year
LC rates for lesions treated with doses of > 54, 45–54,
and < 45 Gy were 100, 78, and 64%, respectively (p =
0.009) Figure 1(b)). Correlation analysis revealed a positive linear relationship between the SBRT dose and LC
at 2 years (p = 0.006, R = 0.899) (Figure 2(a)). Multivariate analysis confirmed that SBRT dose (as a continuous
variable) (p = 0.027) and age (p = 0.026) were significant
prognostic factors for LC.
Overall survival
In all patients, the 2- and 5-year OS rates were 63 and 39%,
respectively (Figure 3(a)). Univariate analysis identified the
number of previous TACE sessions, BCLC stage, SBRT
dose, and LD as significant prognostic factors for OS
(Table 2). The 2-year OS rates for patients treated with
SBRT doses of > 54, 45–54, and < 45 Gy were 71, 64, and
30%, respectively (p = 0.001) (Figure 3(b)). The 2-year OS
rates for BCLC A and B-C were 74 and 51%, respectively
(p = 0.012) (Figure 3(c)). Correlation analysis revealed a
positive linear relationship between the SBRT dose and OS
at 2 years (p = 0.002, R = 0.940) (Figure 2(b)). Multivariate
analysis confirmed that the SBRT dose (as a continuous
variable) (p = 0.005) and BCLC stage (p = 0.015) were significant prognostic factors for OS. To determine the effect
of a local failure on survival, local failure was analyzed
as a prognostic factor. Univariate analysis revealed that
the 2-year OS rates for patients with and without local
failure were 27% and 68%, respectively (p < 0.001). In
32 patients with 37 lesions with dose > 54 Gy, LC and
OS rates at the time of the last follow-up (4.5 years)
were 100% and 68%, respectively (Table 3).
Tumor control probability
Figure 4(a) shows the fitted TCP of the SBRT dose versus the 2-year LC for all 95 lesions as plotted by the following fitted parameters: γ50 = 1.22 and TCD50 = 34.9
(95% CI, 32.6-37.2). According to the TCP curve, doses
of 54.8 Gy (95% CI, 51.2-58.4) and 46.4 Gy (95% CI,
43.3-49.5) provide 2-year LC with probabilities of 90%
and 80%, respectively. Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the fitted TCP of the SBRT dose versus the 2-year LC for 83
lesions with LD ≤ 5.0 cm and 12 lesions with LD > 5.0
cm, respectively.
Toxicity
One patient (1%) experienced grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia,
but this patient had pre-existing grade 1 hyperbilirubinemia.
Two patients (2%) experienced grade 3 ascites that required paracentesis without evidence of disease progression and with normal alkaline phosphatase levels. No
classic RILD was observed, but 6 patients (7%) experienced non-classic RILD (worsening of CTP score by ≥ 2
in all) within 3 months after SBRT. Excluding the patient
with disease progression, 4 patients (5%) experienced nonclassic RILD, and 3 of these patients were reversibly converted during long-term follow-up. One patient (1%)
experienced grade 3 soft tissue toxicity in the right
upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this patient had a
large tumor (LD, 6.2 cm) near the skin. Five patients
(6%) experienced grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI)

Discussion
This study revealed a dose-control relationship for SBRT
in 3 fractions for HCC. Higher SBRT doses resulted in
higher LC rates. In particular, we analyzed only lesions
treated with 3 fractions, and calculating the BED was
not necessary; therefore, no confounding effect or error
was introduced from converting the dose between different fractionations. More specifically, a SBRT dose > 54
Gy achieved LC rates of 100%. This result using > 54 Gy
in 3 fractions is consistent with those found in the phase
II study of SBRT for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (3-year LC of 98% with 54 Gy in 3 fractions) [35]. In
this study, LD was a prognostic factor for LC in univariate analysis. Although statistical significance for LC
was not observed in multivariate analysis, tumor size is
generally an important prognostic factor in HCC [3-6].
The SBRT dose and tumor size are closely related due
to normal liver dose-constraints. Therefore we performed stratified analysis according to LD to avoid the
effect of tumor size, demonstrating that the SBRT dose
remained significantly prognostic factor for LC (Figures 5
(a), (b)). In the lesions with LD > 5 cm, only 1 patient had
a SBRT dose > 54 Gy, and we could not carried out adequate statistical analysis for the difference in LC between
the SBRT dose groups (≤ 54 Gy vs. > 54 Gy).
For optimal dose quantification, we adopted the logistic model. On the basis of the best-fitted TCP curve,
doses of 54.8 Gy and 46.4 Gy produce 2-year LC with
probabilities of 90% and 80%, respectively. These findings suggest that 54 Gy in 3 fractions is an acceptable
dose to achieve LC for HCC lesions with LD ≤ 7.0 cm.
However, the SBRT dose required to achieve the same
LC rates may differ according to tumor size. We estimated the TCP curve after stratification by LD (≤ 5.0 cm
vs. > 5.0 cm). For lesions with LD ≤ 5.0 cm or > 5.0 cm,
the estimated SBRT doses to provide 2-year LC with a
probability of 90% were 51.1 (95% CI, 47.7–54.5) and
61.2 Gy (95% CI, 58.4–64.0), respectively.
To date, no prospective randomized study has compared dose-fractionation regimens in SBRT for HCC.
We suggested a SBRT dose of 54 Gy in 3 fractions by fitted TCP curve and survival analysis. In an Indiana University study, the prescribed doses were 48 Gy in 3
fractions for patients with CTP class A and 40 Gy in 5
fractions for those with CTP class B. In that study, the
2-year LC rate was 90% [21]. In a Belgium study, the
prescribed dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions, and the 2-year
LC rate was 95% [22]. The results of these studies are

comparable with those of the lesions that received
higher doses in our study, despite use of slightly lower
doses in the above mentioned studies. These observations may be attributable to the additional margin to the
GTV. In the Indiana University study, CTV expansion
was not performed, and the PTV was defined as GTV +
5–10 mm. In the Belgium study, the CTV was defined
as the GTV + 10 mm in all directions the within liver
and the PTV as CTV + 1.5 mm margin. In our institution,
CTV expansion was not performed and the PTV was defined as GTV + 2–4 mm. In SBRT, the differences in the
additional margin to the GTV affect dose-distribution.
Even without a GTV expansion, the surrounding 0.5 cm
may be adequately covered by the SBRT prescription. In
fact, the total dose to cover the GTV may be similar
among 3 institutions. When we reviewed our plan, PTVs
with additional margins of 5–10 mm or 11 mm were adequately covered by isodose lines of 48 Gy and 45 Gy, respectively. Therefore, to compare the studies of SBRT for
HCC, an additional margin and a prescribed isodose line
should be considered. Comparisons using a dose covering
the GTV or maximum dose may be suggested as appropriate methods. Furthermore, we think that consensus or
standardization of the SBRT technique for HCC, such as
defining of additional margin to GTV and prescribed isodose line, is needed.

Although it appears that the tumor response increases
with increasing radiation doses, it is difficult to demonstrate
a dose-relationship for OS because many complicated factors are involved in determining survival. This is especially
true in HCC because most of patients have liver cirrhosis,
and minimizing the deterioration of liver function induced
by treatment is critical. Further, as many patients who experienced intrahepatic tumor recurrence after treatment
exhibited a complete response, preserving liver function for
further treatment is important for prolonging OS. In patients with HCC treated by 3D-CRT, RILD is a relatively
common severe toxicity [11-14,36]. However, classic RILD
was not reported after SBRT and we also observed no classic RILD, perhaps due to the substantial difference in the
normal liver dose distribution between 3D-CRT and SBRT
[20-26]. On the other hand, we observed non-classic RILD
in 6 patients (7%) within 3 months after SBRT. Excluding
the patient with disease progression, 4 patients (5%) experienced non-classic RILD. Additionally, if late toxicity can influence survival, the fact that 75% of patients who
experienced non-classic RILD without disease progression
were reversibly converted during long-term follow-up duration is encouraging. Due to the high LC rate and little liver
deterioration induced by treatment, in our study, the SBRT
dose as a continuous variable was a prognostic factor for
OS in multivariate analysis.
Overall 5 patients (6%) experienced grade 3 or 4
gastrointestinal toxicity. These patients had the lesion in
close proximity (within 0–0.4 cm) to the GI tract and
relatively high doses were delivered to the GI tract. The
maximum doses to GI tract of these patients were 42,
45, 55, 55, and 60 Gy, respectively. Three patients had
pre-SBRT gastroduodenal ulcer confirmed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We previously performed studies
about severe gastroduodenal and intestinal toxicity after
SBRT using 3 fractions for abdominopelvic malignancies
and reported their results [37,38]. In the study about
gastroduodenal toxicity, we suggested that Dmax is a valuable predictor of severe gastroduodenal tocivity. A history
of ulcer before SBRT should be carefully considered as a
clinical predictor, especially in patients who receive a high
dose to gastroduodenum [37]. In the study about intestinal toxicity, we V25 is a valuable predictor of severe intestinal toxicity. And SBRT would be conducted with a
treatment interval of at least 48 hours if possible [38].
LC and OS rates in SBRT for HCC patients with
dose > 54 Gy were excellent and potentially equivalent
to those treated by RFA [6-8,39,40] (Table 3). Of course,
because of differences in baseline prognostic features between the patients, direct comparison between SBRT and
RFA has been limited. In most RFA series, the patients
had initial disease and received RFA as the first treatment.
However, in this study, 53% of the patients had recurrent
disease and all patients had an incomplete response to
prior TACE. Irrespective of these potential unfavorable
prognostic features, the outcomes were comparable with
those of RFA. Toxicities were also tolerable in SBRT for
HCC. On the basis of these observations, a phase II trial
of high-dose SBRT for the patients with small-sized HCC
(≤ 5.0 cm) is ongoing in Korea. Furthermore, we expect
randomized trials comparing SBRT and RFA for HCC to
follow.
This study had some limitations. First, this study was
not a randomized trial, and therefore, patients were not
controlled with respect to variable prognostic factors.
Nevertheless, all patients met the inclusion criteria of prospective studies and received SBRT with consistent technique. Therefore, selection bias can be controlled to a
considerable degree. Second, the TCP curve was estimated
using the logistic model. This result may be regarded as
hypothesis generating and should be validated with clinical data. Third, only a small number of large tumors were
included, and it may be inaccurate to apply our results to
large tumors. We believe that our results are more powerful and reliable for small tumors rather than large tumors.
In separate prospective SBRT trial for large HCC, we expect implemental results for large-sized HCC.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated a dose response relationship for LC and OS with SBRT for HCC.
Higher LC rates resulting from higher doses may improve survival benefit for HCC. High-dose SBRT may be
as effective and safe a treatment modality as RFA, a
major nonsurgical ablative modality. Based on the TCP
model, a dose of 54.8 Gy produces 2-year LC with a
probability of 90%. To validate our results and obtain
definitive conclusions, prospective studies in larger populations will be needed in the future.
