Summary and conclusions
One hundred cases of severe paracetamol poisoning
were treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine). There was virtually complete protection
against liver damage in 40 patients treated within eight
hours after ingestion (mean maximum serum alanine
transaminase activity 27 IU/1). Only one out of 62 patients
treated within 10 hours developed severe liver damage
compared with 33 out of 57 patients (58%) studied retrospectively who received supportive treatment alone.
Early treatment with acetylcysteine also prevented
renal impairment and death. The critical ingestiontreatment interval for complete protection against
severe liver damage was eight hours. Efficacy diminished
progressively thereafter, and treatment after 15 hours
was completely ineffective.
Intravenous acetylcysteine was more effective than
cysteamine and methionine and noticeably free of
adverse effects. It is the treatment of choice for paracetamol poisoning.

Introduction
Now that the biochemical mechanisms of paracetamol hepatotoxicity are understood' sulphydryl compounds such as cysteamine, L-methionine, and N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) may
be used successfully to treat severe paracetamol poisoning.2-10
Nevertheless, the relative efficacy of these agents in protecting
against liver damage, renal impairment, and death is uncertain
and doubts have been raised about the safety of cysteamine and
methionine.2-8 Furthermore, cysteamine and methionine are
not available commercially for intravenous administration.
Our initial findings with intravenous acetylcysteine were
encouraging,4 5 and we describe here the results of treating
100 cases.
Patients and methods
Patients-Eighty-seven patients admitted on 100 occasions with
severe paracetamol poisoning between December 1976 and May
1979 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. Their mean age
was 33 years (range 13-82), and 33 were male. Those admitted on
more than one occasion were considered as separate patients for each
admission. Forty-eight patients claimed to have taken only
paracetamol, 31 took it in combination with dextropropoxyphene as
Distalgesic, and the remainder also took one or more other drugs,
usually benzodiazepines or aspirin. All patients were admitted within
24 hours after ingestion and had plasma paracetamol concentrations
above a treatment line joining plots of 200 mg/l at four hours and
30 mg/l at 15 hours on a semilogarithmic graph. More-severely
poisoned patients with plasma paracetamol concentrations above a
similar line joining 300 mg/l at four hours and 45 mg/l at 15 hours
were defined as "high-risk" cases. Patients with values between
these two lines were designated as an "intermediate-risk" group.
When necessary the lines were extrapolated to 24 hours.
General management-Gastric aspiration and lavage were performed
on patients admitted within four hours of ingestion and those in
coma. Patients with persistent nausea and vomiting were given
intravenous fluid replacement and antiemetics. Impending or
established hepatic failure was treated conventionally. Twenty-one
patients who took Distalgesic required naloxone-20 were in deep
coma, and respiratory arrest had occurred in 10.
Treatment with acetylcysteine-Intravenous acetylcysteine was given
in an initial dose of 150 mg/kg in 200 ml 5% dextrose over 15 minutes

followed by 50 mg/kg in 500 ml 5% dextrose over four hours and
100 mg/kg in one litre 5% dextrose over the next 16 hours (total
dose 300 mg/kg in 20 hours). Roughly half of the patients were given
Airbron, which is a 20% sterile aqueous solution of acetylcysteine
for intrabronchial use. The remainder were given a similar solution
specially prepared by the manufacturer for intravenous use.
Investigations-Initially, the pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature,
and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored closely during administration of acetylcysteine. Full blood counts and estimations of
prothrombin-time ratio, activities of serum aspartate transaminase
(SGOT; serum AST) and serum alanine transaminase (SGPT;
serum ALT), and plasma bilirubin, urea, creatinine, and electrolyte
concentrations were usually performed on admission and daily for
three to five days. Plasma paracetamol concentrations measured on
admission1" were confirmed by specific chromatographic methods.12 13
Assessment of acetylcysteine-The efficacy of acetylcysteine was
assessed by comparing it with the results of supportive treatment
given alone to 57 similarly poisoned patients. Most of these had been
admitted during 1969-73, before specific treatment became available.
Comparisons were also made with 40 patients treated with intravenous
cysteamine and 20 treated with intravenous methionine during
1973-6.3 All had plasma paracetamol concentrations above the
treatment line, and except for the use of specific treatment their
management was similar to that in the acetylcysteine-treated group.
Severe liver damage was defined as an increase in serum AST or
ALT activity above 1000 IU/i and renal impairment as a rise in the
plasma creatinine concentration from normal to over 300 umol/l
(3 4 mg/100 ml).
Results
Patients given supportive treatment, acetylcysteine, and cysteamine
and methionine were broadly comparable in age, sex, severity of
poisoning, and ingestion-admission interval (table I). More patients
treated with acetylcysteine, however, had taken paracetamol with
other drugs and alcohol, and there was a highly significant excess of
Distalgesic poisoning in this group compared with the group given
supportive treatment (x2= 14 9; P < 0 001).
LIVER DAMAGE
Acetylcysteine given within 10 hours-Only one of the 62 patients
given acetylcysteine within 10 hours developed severe liver damage
compared with 33 (58%) of the 57 patients given supportive treatment.

BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 3 NOVEMBER 1979
Patients given acetylcysteine showed a minor increase in mean
maximum serum ALT activity to 113 IU/1, while their mean plasma
bilirubin concentration and prothrombin-time ratio were within
normal limits. In contrast, the corresponding values in the patients
given supportive treatment were over 2022 IU/1, 56 tLmol/l (3 3 mg/
100 ml), and 1 9 respectively (table UI). (In this group the mean
serum ALT activity was underestimated, since from 1969 to 1973
the results were often reported as over 850 or over 1000 IU/1.)
Thirty-three patients given acetylcysteine (53%'.) and 28 given
supportive treatment (49%0) were high-risk cases. Acetylcysteine was
almost completely effective in preventing even mild liver damage
when given within eight hours of ingesting paracetamol. In 36 out of
40 patients (90%) treated within this time (mean 63 hours) the
serum ALT activity remained normal (up to 40 IU/1), the mean
maximum value being only 27 IU/l and the highest individual value
79 IU/1.
Acetylcysteine given within 10-24 hours-In 38 cases acetylcysteine
was given 10-24 (mean 15) hours after ingestion. Severe liver damage
occurred in 20 (530 /), and the mean maximum serum ALT activity,
plasma bilirubin concentration, and prothrombin-time ratio were
3814 IU/1, 57 pmol/l (3 3 mg/100 ml), and 1-9 respectively. These
results were closely similar to those in the group given supportive
treatment (table II), though more patients given acetylcysteine were
high-risk cases (71% compared with 49% ). Severe liver damage
occurred in three out of nine patients treated 10-12 hours, seven
out of 15 treated 12-15 hours, and 10 out of 14 treated 15-24 hours
after ingestion.
High-risk patients-The efficacy of acetylcysteine is best assessed
in the high-risk cases, since severe liver damage occurred in 89',
of such patients given supportive treatment while the incidence in
those at intermediate risk was only 28%)o. Table III gives the results.
Of the 33 high-risk patients given acetylcysteine within 10 hours after
ingestion, only one developed severe liver damage, and there was
little or no disturbance of liver function in the others. Acetylcysteine
was particularly effective in the 19 high-risk patients treated within
eight hours: serum ALT activity remained normal in 17 (89%' ),
and the maximum values in the other two patients were 61 and
79 IU/1. The incidences of liver damage and its severity were similar
in patients given supportive treatment and those given acetylcysteine
10-24 hours after ingestion.
Critical ingestion-treatment interval for protection against liver
damage-To define more precisely the critical time limit for efficacy
of acetylcysteine we calculated the incidence and severity of liver
damage at different ingestion-treatment intervals. Patients who
presented late, however, were more severely poisoned and more
often at high risk irrespective of treatment. Comparisons with the
supportive-treatment group as a whole were not therefore appropriate,
since most patients presented early; hence to avoid misleading
conclusions we analysed separately patients at high risk and those at
intermediate risk. Table IV gives the results. Severe liver damage
occurred in 25 (89%) of the 28 patients given supportive treatment,
and the incidence was similar in the 13 admitted within 10 hours and
the 15 admitted more than 10 hours after ingestion. There was
complete protection against severe liver damage when treatment with
acetylcysteine was begun within eight hours, but the incidence was
7% when treatment was begun at 8-10 hours, 43% when begun at
10-12 hours, and 56%O when begun at 12-15 hours. Treatment after
15 hours was ineffective, severe liver damage occurring in 82% of
patients. In the intermediate-risk group there was no clear evidence
of protection after 10 hours, but the numbers were small.
RENAL IMPAIRMENT
There was no renal impairment (as defined here) in patients given
acetylcysteine within 10 hours (see table V). Nevertheless, renal

impairment occurred in 6 (11%,/) of the 57 patients given supportive
treatment, and three required haemodialysis. Five of the 38 patients
(13%) given acetylcysteine within 10-24 (mean 19-8) hours had renal
impairment, of whom one required haemodialysis. Compared with
supportive treatment and late acetylcysteine, the protective effect of
early acetylcysteine against renal impairment was significant (P = 0-02;
Fisher's exact test).
DEATHS
None of the patients given acetylcysteine within 10 hours died
from hepatic failure (see table V), but two died several days later from
hypoxic brain damage and stroke after taking Distalgesic. Liverfunction values remained normal in both cases. Two patients given
acetylcysteine 17-8 and 24 hours after ingestion and three given
supportive treatment died in hepatic coma. All were in the high-risk
group. The difference in mortality from hepatic failure between
patients given acetylcysteine within 10 hours and the late-treatment
and supportive-treatment groups combined approached significance
(P=0-08; one tail; Fisher's exact test).
COMPARISON WITH CYSTEAMINE AND METHIONINE
Table V compares the results of treatment with intravenous
acetylcysteine and cysteamine and methionine.5 When given within
10 hours all agents protected against severe liver damage, there were
no deaths from hepatic failure, and renal impairment did not occur.
Severe liver damage occurred in one of the 62 patients given acetylcysteine, none of the 27 given cysteamine, and three of the 15 given
methionine, the mean maximum serum ALT activities in the three
groups being 113, 149, and 1415 IU/l respectively. Serum ALT
activity remained normal in 47 (76%) of the patients given acetylcysteine compared with 11 (41%) and six (40%) of those given
cysteamine and methionine respectively (X2 = 8-7 and 5-6; P <001
and <0 02). Of the high-risk patients treated within eight hours,
19 given acetylcysteine had a mean serum ALT activity of 30 IU/i
compared with 222 IU/l in 12 given cysteamine and methionine
(t=2297; P<0 01). Hence acetylcysteine was apparently more
effective than cysteamine and methionine. The critical ingestiontreatment interval appeared to be the same for all three compounds.
The incidences of severe liver damage, fatal hepatic failure, and renal
impairment were similar with supportive treatment and cysteamine,
methionine, and acetylcysteine given 10-24 hours after ingestion.
SAFETY OF ACETYLCYSTEINE
Acetylcysteine did not produce any obvious side effects. Unlike
cysteamine it did not cause protracted vomiting, drowsiness,
irritability, and malaise. Hypokalaemia and low plasma bicarbonate
concentrations were often noted during the first 72 hours, and there
was a tendency towards low platelet counts, especially in patients with
severe liver damage. Acetylcysteine was not responsible, however,
since similar changes were observed with cysteamine, methionine,
and supportive treatment. Serial ECGs often showed transient
generalised T-wave flattening and prominent U waves consistent
with hypokalaemia.
Discussion
Intravenous acetylcysteine was clearly highly effective in
protecting against severe liver damage, renal failure, and death
after paracetamol overdosage when given within 8-10 hours of
ingestion. As with cysteamine and methionine, the incidence
and severity of liver damage rose as the interval between

ingestion and treatment increased beyond eight hours, and
treatment after 15 hours was ineffective. The importance of the
critical ingestion-treatment interval is sometimes not appreciated, and conflicting claims have been made. Douglas
et al'4 believed that cysteamine was of no definite advantage
whether given before or after nine hours, while Smith et a18
concluded that it might prevent further liver damage when
given up to 72 hours after ingestion of paracetamol.
Our use of patients given supportive treatment as historical
controls was not ideal, but to withhold specific treatment in
clinical trials would be unethical. Our results suggest that in the
doses used acetylcysteine is more effective than cysteamine and
methionine. Methionine seemed to be the least effective. Despite
administration within 10 hours, severe liver damage occurred
in 200% of our patients and in 4-100%" of patients given oral
methionine in other studies.7 15
Oral acetylcysteine has been used for paracetamol poisoning
in the USA,9 10 16 but severe liver damage occurred in 17% of
49 patients treated within 10 hours despite the use of heroic
doses (1330 mg/kg given over three days).'0 Acetylcysteine is
apparently more effective when given intravenously than by
mouth. This is not surprising, since in our experience most
severely poisoned patients develop early nausea and vomiting,
making oral treatment impracticable. In any event, absorption
is likely to be delayed or incomplete. Frequent vomiting has
been described with oral methionine," and in one study
vomiting 'apparently occurred in all 416 patients given oral
acetylcysteine.10 There seems to be no place for oral treatment
of severe paracetamol poisoning when effective intravenous
treatment is available.
Cysteamine invariably causes distressing side effects,2 3 6-8 14
and methionine may be toxic.3 7 18 Methionine is contraindicated
in severe liver disease and may contribute to encephalopathy
in paracetamol poisoning.'9 In contrast, acetylcysteine was
noticeably free of adverse effects and on these grounds alone is
preferable to cysteamine and methionine. Furthermore,
acetylcysteine is readily available, and a special intravenous
preparation (Parvolex, Duncan, Flockhart) is now marketed in
the UK for paracetamol poisoning.
The following plan of management is proposed for
paracetamol poisoning in adults. On admission blood should
be taken for emergency estimation of the plasma paracetamol
concentration, remembering that values obtained before four
hours after ingestion may not be reliable because of the
possibility of continuing absorption. Non-specific analytical
methods such as those described by Wilkinson20 and Welch and
Conney2l must not be used, since they may overestimate values
by up to 700%.2 Gastric lavage should be performed on
patients admitted within four hours of ingestion and on unconscious patients.
Intravenous acetylcysteine is indicated in patients with
plasma paracetamol concentrations above the treatment line,
provided that treatment is started within 15 hours of ingestion.
Patients who are thought to have taken over 7-5 g paracetamol
more than eight hours previously, however, should be treated
immediately without waiting for the plasma paracetamol result.
Although treatment with acetylcysteine between 15 and 24 hours
is ineffective, it probably does no harm and should not be
withheld if the time of ingestion is in doubt. Severe liver
damage and renal failure may occur with plasma paracetamol
concentrations below the present treatment line,5 and in view
of the safety of acetylcysteine a good case can be made for
lowering the line to 150 mg/l at four hours and 25 mg/l at
15 hours.

Vancouver style
All manuscripts submitted to the BMJ from now on should
conform to the uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted
to biomedical journals (known as the Vancouver style).
The BMJ, together with many other international biomedical
journals, has agreed to accept articles prepared in accordance with
the Vancouver style and will be introducing the system from
January 1980. The style (described in full in BMJ, 24 February,
p 532) is intended to standardise requirements for authors and
covers text format, presentation of methods and results, use of
SI units, and the form of tables and illustrations. All the participating journals have also agreed to introduce a standard form of
references.
In future references to papers submitted to the BMJ should
include: the names of all authors if there are fewer than seven or,
if there are more, the first three followed by et al; the title of
journal articles or book chapters; the titles of journals abbreviated
according to the style of Index Medicus; and the first and final
page numbers of the article or chapter.
