Abstract
Fontan-palliated patients are at risk for the development of Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD). In this study, we performed a detailed hemodynamic and hepatic assessment to analyze the incidence and spectrum of FALD and its association 
with patients’ hemodynamics. From 2017 to 2019, 145 patients underwent a detailed, age-adjusted hepatic examination 
including laboratory analysis (FibroTest®, n=101), liver ultrasound (n=117) and transient elastography (FibroScan®, n=61). 
The median patient age was 16.0 years [IQR 14.2], and the median duration of the Fontan circulation was 10.3 years [IQR 
14.7]. Hemodynamic assessment was performed using echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity testing and 
cardiac catheterization. Liver ultrasound revealed hepatic parenchymal changes in 83 patients (70.9%). Severe liver cirrhosis 
was detectable in 20 patients (17.1%). Median liver stifness measured by FibroScan® was 27.7 kPa [IQR 14.5], and the 
median Fibrotest® score was 0.5 [IQR 0.3], corresponding to fbrosis stage≥2. Liver stifness values and Fibrotest® scores 
correlated signifcantly with Fontan duration (P1=0.013, P2=0.012). Exercise performance was signifcantly impaired in 
patients with severe liver cirrhosis (P=0.003). Pulmonary artery pressure and end-diastolic pressure were highly elevated 
in cirrhotic patients (P1=0.008, P2=0.003). Multivariable risk factor analysis revealed Fontan duration to be a major risk 
factor for the development of FALD (P<0.001, OR 0.77, CI 0.68–0.87). In the majority of patients, hepatic abnormalities 
suggestive of FALD were detectable by liver ultrasound, transient elastography and laboratory analysis. The severity of 
FALD correlated signifcantly with Fontan duration and impaired Fontan hemodynamics. A detailed hepatic assessment is 
indispensable for long-term surveillance of Fontan patients.

Introduction
The Fontan operation was introduced in 1968 by François M. Fontan as surgical palliation of tricuspid atresia 
[1]. Despite various modifcations concerning surgical 
techniques, it has remained the palliative standard procedure for patients with univentricular physiology. With 
advances in surgical techniques, perioperative management, diagnostic capacities and adequate patient selection, 
early- and long-term survival of Fontan-palliated patients 
has improved over the past few decades [2–4]. Since the 
majority of Fontan patients reaches adulthood, there is 
growing evidence of end-organ dysfunction, especially 
afecting the liver [5, 6]. Fontan-associated liver disease 
(FALD) includes all abnormalities in liver structure and 
function which result from the non-physiological Fontan

circulation: liver fbrosis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [7–10]. The etiology of FALD seems to be 
multifactorial, involving hypoxic and ischemic liver insults 
before and during the multi-step surgical palliation pathway for patients with univentricular anatomy [11]. The 
hallmarks of the Fontan circulation—diminished cardiac 
output and chronic central venous congestion—augment the structural and functional alteration of the liver: 
impaired hepatic vein drainage, sinusoidal dilatation and 
hemorrhagic necrosis result in the development of perisinusoidal and pericentral fbrosis leading to FALD [11]. 
Although various studies focus on the detection of FALD, 
hepatic assessment is not routinely included in Fontan surveillance, and risk factors for FALD development have not 
yet been identifed.
In this study we performed a detailed hemodynamic and 
hepatic assessment to examine the incidence and spectrum 
of FALD and to analyze its association with hemodynamic 
parameters determined by echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity testing and cardiac catheterization.
Patients and Methods
Patients
From July 2017 to July 2019, 145 of 475 (30.5%) Fontan 
patients treated in our institution underwent a detailed, ageadjusted hepatic assessment including liver ultrasound and 
laboratory analysis in patients>7 years of age, and additional transient elastography in patients>14 years. Hemodynamic assessment consisted of echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Cardiac catheterization was 
performed in patients with a clinical indication for an invasive evaluation of hemodynamics, e.g. clinical deterioration, 
impaired exercise capacity or decreased oxygen saturation. 
Two patients who received the Fontan operation as adults 
and died from early Fontan failure were excluded from further analysis. In patients with elevated liver enzymes and 
bilirubin, other causes for liver disease, such as infectious 
hepatitis, were ruled out. In our analysis, FALD was defned 
as the combination of elevated liver enzyme or bilirubin levels and abnormal liver ultrasound fndings in accordance 
with reports of other investigators [12, 13]. Following the 
fndings of Horowitz et al. [14] and Moon et al. [15], the 
combination of heterogeneous echotexture, surface nodularity, lobar atrophy or hypertrophy, and splenomegaly defned 
ultrasonographic diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The study was 
approved by the institutional review board and the institutional ethics committee (decision number EA2/127/16). 
Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
Laboratory Assessment
Liver function was evaluated using the liver enzymes 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), total bilirubin, 
α2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1 and haptoglobin. 
The laboratory parameters alanine aminotransferase, 
γ-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, α2-macroglobulin, 
apolipoprotein A1 and haptoglobin were measured in accordance with recommendations required by BioPredictive 
(Paris, France) to calculate biomarker fbrosis scores with 
FibroTest®. FibroTest® was computed on the BioPredictive 
website (www.biopredictive.com). The calculated Fibrotest®
score was converted to liver fbrosis stage according to the 
METAVIR histological classifcation for liver biopsies [16].
Liver Ultrasound and Transient Elastography
Following our protocol for hepatic Fontan surveillance, 
patients between 7 and 18 years of age underwent liver ultrasound by an experienced pediatric radiologist, while patients 
older than 18 years were referred to an experienced hepatologist. Liver ultrasound was performed following a multidisciplinary-developed protocol including measurement 
of liver and spleen size, examination of liver parenchyma 
and liver vein morphology, signs of portal hypertension, and 
Doppler sonography of liver vessels. Transient elastography 
(TE, FibroScan®, Echosens, France) was performed using a 
size M transducer in Fontan patients older than 14 years. A 
median value of 10 measurements of the right lobe of the 
liver was calculated. In patients with abnormal abdominal 
anatomy, e.g. situs inversus or heterotaxy, transient elastography was not considered diagnostically conclusive. Liver 
stifness was reported in kilopascals (kPa).
Hemodynamic Assessment
Hemodynamic assessment was performed following our protocol for Fontan surveillance and included echocardiography 
and cardiopulmonary exercise capacity testing. Echocardiographic systolic function of the single ventricle was graded 
as normal/mildly, moderately or severely impaired according 
to visual assessment of ventricular contractility performance. 
The degree of atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation was 
classifed as none/mild, moderate or severe referring to the 
width of the colour Doppler regurgitation jet. Functional 
cardiopulmonary capacity testing was performed following 
a standardized institutional protocol using a cycle ergometer. 
Exercise was continued to the point of patients’ maximum 
tolerance. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) was measured 
in ml/kg/min and normalized in % of predicted VO2 max

using age-, gender- and body dimension-adjusted normative 
values suggested by Cooper et al. [17]. Cardiac catheterization was performed in patients with a clinical indication for 
an invasive hemodynamic evaluation (s.a.). The standard 
catheterization protocol included measurement of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure (EDP), liver vein pressure (LVP) and liver vein 
wedge pressure (LVWP). Transpulmonary gradient (TPG) 
was calculated by the diference between mean pulmonary 
artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and surgical data were obtained from the 
medical records of the German Heart Center Berlin/ Department of Pediatric Cardiology at Charité Universitätsmedizin 
Berlin. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range 
calculated as 75th minus 25th percentile. Fontan duration 
was defned as the time between the date of Fontan operation 
and end of follow-up. Correlation analysis was performed 
using the Spearman or Kruskal–Wallis H test. The impact of 
ventricular function and the degree of AV valve regurgitation on the development of FALD were analyzed using the 
chi-square test. Risk factors for the development of FALD 
were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Variables 
with P<0.1 were included in a multivariable regression 
model. Statistic analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical software program SPSS for Windows (version 23, 
IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A P value<0.05 was considered signifcant.

Patient Characteristics
Table 1 displays baseline patient characteristics of the total 
cohort. From July 2017 to July 2019, 145 Fontan-palliated 
patients received a detailed, age-adjusted hepatic assessment 
in our institution. The total cohort consisted of 80 pediatric 
(55.2%) and 65 adult patients (44.8%). The median patient 
age was 16.0 years [IQR 14.2], and median age at Fontan operation was 3.7 years [IQR 3.3]. The most common 
underlying morphologies are listed in Table 1 and consisted 
of tricuspid atresia (n=45, 31.0%), double inlet left ventricle (n=21, 14.5%) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
(n=22, 15.2%). Left ventricular dominance was found in 
95 patients (65.5%). Absent sinus rhythm was found in 
41 patients (28.3%), 29 of whom required a permanent 
pacemaker. The median duration of Fontan circulation was 
10.3 years [IQR 14.7]. The Fontan procedure was performed 
using extracardiac conduit in 109 patients (75.2%), intracardiac lateral tunnel in 22 patients (15.2%) and other surgical 
modifications in 14 patients (9.7%). Sixty-one patients 
(42.1%) received primary fenestration. In 29 patients the 
fenestration was closed by intervention after a median time 
of 1.6 years [IQR 2.4]. Two patients (1.4%) were diagnosed 
with plastic bronchitis and 12 patients (8.3%) with proteinlosing enteropathy. At the time of investigation, one patient 
with plastic bronchitis and seven patients with protein-losing 
enteropathy were in stable remission.
Laboratory Assessment
The results of laboratory analysis for the total cohort are 
listed in Table 2. According to age-adjusted standard values of our laboratory, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 
elevated in 31 patients, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
in 27 patients, γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT) in 115 patients 
and bilirubin in 32 patients. Thrombocytopenia was found 
in 37 patients. The median Fibrotest® fbrosis score was 0.5 
[IQR 0.3]. With regard to the Fibrotest® calculation, fbrosis was staged F2 in the majority of our patients (n=49; 
Table 2).

Liver Ultrasound and Transient Elastography
Liver ultrasound revealed hepatic parenchymal changes in 
83 patients (Table 2). The most common ultrasound fndings were heterogeneous echotexture (n =83), liver vein 
dilatation (n=69), altered liver vein morphology (n=32) 
and segmental hypertrophy or atrophy (n = 25). Hyperechogenic lesions were present in 10 patients, and sonographic signs of liver cirrhosis were detectable in 20 patients 
(17.1%). Median TE values were 28.0 kPA [IQR 13.7] in the 
pediatric and 27.6 kPa [IQR 14.5] in the adult population. 
Both values were well above pediatric and adult TE cutof 
values of 6.8 kPa and 7.5 kPA for severe liver fbrosis suggested by Fitzpatrick et al. [18] and Stebbing et al. [19]. 
Liver stifness values were signifcantly higher in patients 
with sonography-detectable liver cirrhosis than in patients 
without (P =0.017). Fibrotest® fbrosis score correlated 
mildly with liver stifness values measured by Fibroscan®

(P=0.045). No correlation was found between sonographic 
evidence of structural hepatic damage and Fibrotest® fbrosis 
score (P=1.297).
Hemodynamic Assessment
Echocardiographic examination was available in 145 patients 
and revealed no or mild impairment of systolic function in 
122 patients, moderate impairment in 20 patients and severe 
impairment in three patients (Table 2). AV valve insufciency was graded none or mild in 122 patients, moderate 
in 21 patients and severe in two patients. No correlation 
was found between systolic ventricular function, the degree 
of AV valve insufciency and the incidence and severity of 
FALD in the form of liver cirrhosis.
Exercise capacity testing was performed in 123 patients 
(84.8%). Median VO2 max was 25.6 ml/min/kg [IQR 8.5], 
equalling 64.8% [IQR 24.4] of age-, gender-, weight- and 
height-adjusted normative values. Normalized maximal oxygen uptake correlated strongly with the incidence of FALD 
(P=0.012) and ultrasonography-detectable liver cirrhosis 
(Fig. 1; P=0.003).
Seventy-six patients (53.1%) received invasive hemodynamic evaluation using cardiac catheterization; results are 
shown in Table 2. Invasive pressure measurement revealed 
a median PAP of 12.0 mmHg [IQR 4.0], EDP of 8.0 mmHg 
[IQR 3.8] and a median TPG of 3.5 mmHg [IQR 3.0]. 
Median liver vein pressure was 12.0 mmHg [IQR 5.0] and 
liver vein wedge pressure 13.0 mmHg [IQR 4.0]. PAP, 
EDP and LVWP were signifcantly higher in patients with 
sonography-detectable cirrhosis (P1=0.008, P2=0.003, 
P3=0.029; Fig. 2). TPG did not correlate with the presence of liver cirrhosis (P=0.175). Liver vein wedge pressure 
correlated strongly with liver stifness values measured by 
Fibroscan® (P1=0.005). The presence of a primary fenestration had no statistically signifcant impact on the incidence 
of FALD (P=0.138) or liver cirrhosis (P=0.299).
The Impact of Fontan Duration on Hemodynamics 
and FALD
In our cohort, Fontan duration showed a strong correlation with Fontan hemodynamics and hepatic abnormalities: 
pulmonary artery pressure signifcantly increased with the 
duration of the Fontan circulation (P=0.026). A signifcant 
decrease in exercise capacity was detected with prolonged 
time post-Fontan (P<0.001). Liver stifness values measured by transient elastography and fbrosis score calculated 
by Fibrotest® both correlated strongly with the duration 
of the Fontan circulation (P1=0.013, P2=0.012; Fig. 3). 
Fontan duration was signifcantly longer in patients with 
severe liver cirrhosis than in patients without (20.9 years 
[IQR 11.6] vs. 8.6 years [IQR 11.6], P<0.001; Fig. 4).

Risk Factor Analysis for the Development of FALD
Univariable risk factor analysis revealed Fontan duration, 
Fontan type and the absence of sinus rhythm to be signifcantly associated with FALD development (Table 3). Of the 
possible risk factors investigated in multivariable regression 
analysis, Fontan duration was found to be an independent 
risk factor for FALD (Table 3). Ventricular morphology did 
not infuence FALD manifestation.
Algorithm for Hemodynamic and Hepatic Fontan 
Surveillance
Based on the fndings presented in this study, we developed 
an algorithm for Fontan surveillance, which is demonstrated 
in Figs. 5, 6 and 7. We recommend annual or biannual 
referral of every Fontan-palliated patient to a specialized 
center for hemodynamic assessment including a detailed 
clinical examination, electro- and echocardiography, exercise capacity testing and laboratory analysis. In the case of 
clinical deterioration, cyanosis, reduced cardiopulmonary 
performance, arrhythmia, impaired ventricular function or 
increased AV valve regurgitation, a cardiac catheterization 
and/or MRI might be indicated for further hemodynamic 
evaluation. Additionally, a screening for second-organ diseases such as renal failure, frailty, chronic venous insufciency and especially Fontan-associated liver disease should 
be performed.
According to our fndings, in the majority of patients, 
the frst hepatic abnormalities are evident 4 or 5 years after 
the Fontan operation. Therefore, we recommend a routine 
hepatic assessment including laboratory analysis (e.g. liver 
enzymes, bilirubin, thrombocytes) and liver ultrasound 
from the age of 7 years. Patients with a complicated course 
after the Fontan operation including early Fontan failure 
should receive routine hepatic surveillance before reaching 
7 years of age. Patients with signs of liver cirrhosis should 
be referred to an experienced hepatologist and monitored 
closely for development of hepatocellular carcinoma or portal hypertension, including measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, liver sonography in 6-month intervals and performance 
of gastroscopy for diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal varices. In patients with tumor-suspicious lesions, a 
liver MRI is indicated.
Our fndings underline the strong interrelation between 
Fontan hemodynamics and the development of Fontan-associated liver disease. Therefore, a detailed hepatic assessment

should be performed when a patient presents with impaired 
hemodynamics (Figs. 5, 6). Conversely, progression of hepatic 
damage such as an increase in liver enzymes, sonographic 
signs of severe liver fbrosis or liver cirrhosis, or liver stifness values>30 kPA should prompt a detailed hemodynamic 
evaluation (Fig. 7).
Since every Fontan-palliated patient has a unique anatomy, 
this algorithm should only be considered as a recommendation 
for patients with an uncomplicated clinical course after Fontan 
operation and without signs of Fontan failure. The diagnostic 
and therapeutic approach should be individualized for each 
Fontan patient.
Discussion
Fontan-associated liver disease is the most common secondorgan dysfunction in Fontan-palliated patients, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [20–22]. This 
is the frst study to perform a detailed, noninvasive hepatic 
assessment to examine the incidence and spectrum of FALD 
and to analyze its association with hemodynamic parameters 
determined by echocardiography, exercise capacity testing and 
cardiac catheterization.
Over the past few years, various invasive and noninvasive 
diagnostic instruments have been proposed for the detection of FALD, including liver biopsy, laboratory assessment, 
liver ultrasound, liver CT or MRI, and transient elastography 
[11–13, 23]. Although histopathological evaluation is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of liver disease, in our 
study we focused on noninvasive assessment, considering that 
liver biopsy is associated with increased risk due to anticoagulation treatment and the unique vein anatomy of Fontan 
patients. Concerning long-term surveillance, noninvasive 
diagnostic instruments also appear to be more feasible and 
reproducible in the clinical setting.
Noninvasive Diagnostic Instruments 
for the Detection of FALD
Transient Elastography
Transient elastography is considered a rapid and noninvasive diagnostic instrument to assess liver fbrosis by measuring liver stifness [11]. Various studies report performing 
transient elastography in pediatric and adult Fontan patients 
with inconsistent results concerning correlation of TE values 
and Fontan duration, Fontan pressure or laboratory parameters [12–14]. In our cohort, a strong correlation was found 
between liver stifness values and the duration of the Fontan 
circulation and liver fbrosis score calculated by Fibrotest®. 
TE values did not correlate with pulmonary artery pressure 
or EDP, suggesting that venous congestion does not mainly 
interfere with liver stifness measurement. Moreover, in 
patients with sonographic detectable cirrhosis TE values 
were signifcantly higher than in patients without. These 
fndings indicate TE might be useful to detect structural 
hepatic damage in Fontan patients. Nevertheless, normative 
liver stifness values have to be validated for this particular 
patient cohort using laboratory tests and liver ultrasound.
Liver Ultrasound
Liver ultrasound is one of the most important diagnostic 
instruments for the detection of severe hepatic damage, such 
as liver cirrhosis. In our cohort, liver ultrasound revealed 
hepatic parenchymal changes in the majority of our patients. 
Severe liver cirrhosis was diagnosed based on sonographic 
scoring in 20 patients [14, 15]. Tumor-suspicious lesions 
were detected by liver ultrasound in three patients, but hepatocellular carcinoma was excluded by MRI. Based on its 
feasibility and reliability in the detection of hepatic damage

patient during follow-up.
Laboratory Assessment
Laboratory assessment revealed an elevation of γGT in 
86.5% of the total cohort. γGT is an enzyme located on the 
external surface of cellular membranes. The hallmarks of 
Fontan hemodynamics—low cardiac output and chronic 
venous congestion—may diminish vascular supply of intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to endothelial injury and release 
of γGT. Moreover, as a marker of increased oxidative stress, 
elevated γGT is associated with augmented risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure [24]. γGT elevation is 
common in FALD but does not seem to correlate with its 
extent. In our cohort, the liver fbrosis score calculated by 
Fibrotest® showed a strong correlation with the duration of 
the Fontan circulation, a mild correlation with liver stifness 
values measured by Fibroscan®, but no correlation with liver 
ultrasound fndings. Given these incoherent results, further 
studies are needed to evaluate the predictive ability of the 
Fibrotest® fbrosis score with regard to liver fbrosis in Fontan patients.
All in all, our study demonstrates that one diagnostic 
instrument alone is inefective in detecting Fontan-associated liver disease. Therefore, we propose the combination of laboratory analysis, transient elastography and liver 
ultrasound as basic hepatic screening for FALD in Fontan 
patients.
Impact of Fontan Hemodynamics on FALD
The development of Fontan-associated liver disease is based 
on a multi-step etiology including hypoxic insults, chronic 
venous congestion and low cardiac output [6]. This study 
revealed a high incidence of FALD among our patients 
based on laboratory and sonographic abnormalities found 
during examination. The severity of FALD varied between 
slightly elevated liver enzymes, minimal hepatic parenchymal changes and severe hepatic damage in the form of liver 
cirrhosis. In patients diagnosed with FALD, Fontan duration 
was signifcantly longer than in patients without (14.2 years 
[IQR 13.3] vs. 5.1 years [IQR 3.7]; P<0.001). This signifcant correlation was also detected in patients with severe 
liver cirrhosis.
In our study, PAP, EDP and LVWP were not associated 
with the incidence of FALD, but correlated strongly with 
its severity. Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity was signifcantly decreased in patients diagnosed with both FALD and 
severe liver cirrhosis. Since PAP, EDP and LVWP exhibit 
a small variance and are not highly elevated in compensated Fontan patients compared with patients sufering from 
Fontan failure, a statistically signifcant increase might only 
become evident in patients with severe, but not mild, organ 
damage. In comparison, cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
seems to be more sensitive to detecting changes in Fontan 
hemodynamics. This might be explained by chronic venous 
congestion leading to diminished preload reserve in Fontan 
patients, which can be demonstrated by worsened cardiopulmonary performance. Our results confrm that impaired 
hemodynamics lead to severe hepatic damage. Conversely, 
these fndings underline the importance of monitoring endorgan damage to detect impairment of Fontan hemodynamics. Further studies are needed to analyze and grade the 
severity of Fontan-associated liver disease and investigate 
the impact of hemodynamic changes during follow-up.
Risk Factor Analysis
Univariable risk factor analysis revealed Fontan duration, 
Fontan type and absent sinus rhythm to be risk factors for 
FALD. The infuence of Fontan type (intracardiac/lateral 
tunnel vs. extracardiac conduit) on FALD manifestation 
may refect the change in surgical technique from late to 
early Fontan era, and underlines the importance of time postFontan in the development of end-organ damage.
The importance of atrial contraction in Fontan hemodynamics and the negative efect of arrhythmias and pacemaker dependency on long-term outcome in Fontan patients 
have already been described by other investigators [25]. Our 
results imply that absent atrial contraction leads to impaired 
atrial flling, reduced ventricular preload and diminished cardiac output. The consequences are elevated atrial and central venous pressure, which increases venous congestion and 
may aggravate the development of FALD.
In multivariable analysis, Fontan duration was found to 
be the strongest independent risk factor for FALD. These 
results underline the fact that FALD manifestation is inevitable. Consequently, a detailed hepatic assessment is mandatory in long-term surveillance of Fontan patients.
Algorithm for Fontan Surveillance
Based on our fndings, we developed a diagnostic algorithm 
for hemodynamic and hepatic Fontan surveillance. This 
algorithm highlights the strong interrelation between Fontan 
hemodynamics and the development of Fontan-associated 
liver disease: progression of hepatic damage should result in 
a detailed hemodynamic evaluation and vice versa.
Conclusion
Fontan-associated liver disease is the most common secondorgan dysfunction in Fontan-palliated patients. In 70.9% of 
our patients, hepatic abnormalities suggestive of FALD were 
detectable by liver ultrasound, transient elastography and

laboratory analysis. The incidence and spectrum of FALD 
correlate strongly with exercise capacity and Fontan hemodynamics. Fontan duration was found to be an independent 
risk factor for the development of FALD. FALD surveillance 
is imperative in the monitoring of Fontan-palliated patients.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study which should 
be noted. First, this is a prospective, cross-sectional study 
which includes many diagnostic instruments for hepatic 
and hemodynamic assessment. Therefore, not every patient 
received every diagnostic procedure mentioned, due to either 
death, noncompliance, movement, or missing indication for 
invasive procedures (e.g. cardiac catheterization). Second, 
we focused on noninvasive diagnostic instruments to detect 
Fontan-associated liver disease. Therefore, histological 
assessment to evaluate the extent and severity of liver alterations is missing. Third, although liver disease is common in 
Fontan patients, no universal defnition of FALD exists, and 
further studies are needed to implement terminology and 
diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. Fourth, risk factor 
analysis was limited by the number of patients included in 
the study.
