Abstract
Objective: The benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) and gallbladder
carcinoma (GBC) is unclear, with conflicting results from nonrandomized studies. We reported a meta-analysis to
determine the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on survival.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CNKI databases were searched to identify clinical trials of
postoperative ART versus no radiotherapy for EHCC and GBC. The obtained data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3
and Stata 14.0 statistical software. Differences between two groups were estimated by calculating the odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results: A total of 21 clinical trials involving 1465 EHCC and GBC patients were selected according to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria and included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed the following: The
5-year overall survival (OS) rate was higher in the ART group than in the no radiotherapy group (OR = 0.63; 95%
CI = 0.50–0.81, p = 0.0002). The 5-year OS rate was significantly higher for those with lymph node-positive disease
(OR = 0.15; 95% CI 0.07–0.35; p < 0.00001) and margin-positive disease (OR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.19–0.85; p = 0.02) in
the ART group than in the no radiotherapy group. ART had a tendency to bring benefit to the 5-year OS of
patients with margin-negative disease but the difference was not statistically significant (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.30–1,
07, p = 0.08). The local recurrence rate was significantly lower in the ART group than in the no radiotherapy group
(OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.38–0.76, p = 0.0004), and there was no significant difference in the distant metastasis rate
between the two groups (OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 0.95–1.87, p = 0.10).
Conclusions: A meta-analysis of the existing study results showed that compared with no radiotherapy, ART is an
effective postoperative treatment for EHCC and GBC.

Introduction
Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) are rare, with approximately 12,
360 new cases projected to occur in the United States in
2019 [1]. The prognosis of these cancers is typically
poor, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate ranging
from 5 to 19% [2]. The 5-year OS rate of patients who
underwent surgery was reported to be 27 to 37% [3].
Obviously, surgical treatment can improve the 5-year
OS. However, the risks of local invasion, lymph node
metastasis and distant metastasis of EHCC and GBC are
high, and these tumors are close to the complex anatomy of the porta hepatis, which limits surgery to some
extent [2, 4–6]. Even after surgical treatment, the recurrence rate is very high; more than half of these patients
experience recurrence after radical surgery, with local recurrence after resection being typically observed [7–10].
Although radiotherapy is an effective local treatment for
eradicating potentially microscopic disease, the efficiency
of adjuvant radiotherapy in EHCC and GBC patients is
not clear.
Data supporting ART are sparse, and no consensus
has been reached. Some studies have reported that patients can benefit from ART only early in the disease
course but cannot benefit in the long-term [11–13]. At
present, most published studies on ART for EHCC and
GBC have been retrospective studies. Unfortunately,
large randomized adjuvant trial evidence is difficult to
obtain due to the relative rarity of EHCC and GBC.
Therefore, we performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to investigate on the use of ART in EHCC and
GBC patients and to clarify its effect on the 5-year OS
and relapse of these patients, including the incidence of
local recurrence and distant metastasis. To the best of
our knowledge, no meta-analysis has yet evaluated the
impact of ART on these outcomes in this patient population. Our study highlighted the benefit of long-term
survival (5-year OS) and the effect of ART on local
recurrence and distant metastasis. Confirmation of the
effects of ART on this population and the identification
of disease subgroups that would benefit from such a
strategy will help guide the design of a prospective, randomized study for this rare disease. In addition, the results of this study can serve as a reference for clinicians.
Methods
Literature search strategy
Literature searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane
Library and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases were performed from the date of
inception to March 2019. Searches were limited to human studies. The main keywords used for the search
were ‘extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma’, ‘gallbladder cancer’ (or neoplasms), ‘bile duct cancer’ (or neoplasms),
‘radi.’ (radiotherapy, radiation), ‘chemoradi.’ (chemoradiotherapy, chemoradiation, radiochemotherapy), ‘adjuvant’ and ‘postoperative’.
Selection criteria
Trials included tumors of the gallbladder and extrahepatic, perihilar, and distal bile ducts. In the experimental group, patients underwent surgery followed by
ART, irrespective of concurrent chemotherapy. In the
control group, patients underwent resection alone
without ART. To avoid overlapping patient data in duplicate publications, registry analyses were excluded
from this analysis.
Statistical methods
Two authors extracted data independently to rule out
subjective effects. The following details were extracted:
study period, patient number and disease site (EHCC or
GBC), nodal and resection margin status, chemotherapy
use, radiation type and dosage, and ART toxicity. When
reported, T stage and overall stage were collected. The
use of concurrent chemotherapy (CT) was extracted
when mentioned in the text. However, due to a lack of
individual data and the fact that only a percentage of patients were treated with CT in some cohorts, it was not
possible to statistically assess the impact of concurrent
systemic treatments. The outcomes were 5-year OS,
local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate. When
5-year survival was not reported in the text, it was independently calculated from survival curves.
The relative frequency of OS at 5 years between the ART
and no ART groups was expressed as the odds ratio (OR)
and 95% CI. Data were extracted from the primary publications and entered into the meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3
and Stata 14.0 software. The level of heterogeneity between
studies was evaluated with the Cochrane Q test and the I2
statistic. Egger’s regression test was used to assess publication bias.
Results
Studies
After screening for the inclusion criteria and reviewing
the full texts of potentially eligible studies, 21 retrospective studies were identified. Figure 1 shows the
flowchart of the literature search and selection process.
These studies involved 1465 patients: 753 were treated
with surgery alone, and 712 received ART. The detailed
characteristics of the included studies are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. Some patients in the ART group also received concurrent chemotherapy, which was variable
among the studies. The median external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) dose ranged from 37.5 to 52 Gy.

Efficacy of ART in terms of 5-year OS
The results showed a significant improvement in the 5-year
OS with ART (with or without CT) compared with no
ART (Fig. 2) (OR = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–
0.81; p = 0.0002). No significant heterogeneity existed
among the included studies (I2
, 15%; p = 0.26). Five studies
reported the 5-year OS of patients with lymph nodepositive disease, and four studies reported the 5-year OS
after margin-positive resection. Both analyses showed improvement in the 5-year OS with ART (OR = 0.15, 95% CI
0.07–0.35, p < 0.00001, Fig. 3; OR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.19–0.85;
p = 0.02, Fig. 4, respectively). No significant heterogeneity
existed among the included studies (I2
, 24%, p = 0.26; I2,
31%, p = 0.23). Three studies reported the 5-year OS of patients with margin-negative disease, and the meta-analysis
results showed that patients could gain a relative benefit
from ART but the difference was not statistically significant
(OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.30–1.07, p = 0.08, Fig. 5).
Efficacy of ART in terms of local tumor control
Eleven studies reported the influence of ART on local
tumor control. Subsequent analysis of these studies revealed that ART significantly reduced the risk of local
recurrence (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.38–0.76; p = 0.0004,
Fig. 6). The included studies had no significant heterogeneity (I2
, 32%; p = 0.14).
Efficacy of ART in terms of distant metastasis
Ten studies reported the impact of ART on distant metastasis. Pooled data showed a nonsignificant effect of
ART compared with surgery alone on distant metastasis
(OR = 1.33; 95% CI 0.97–1.87; p = 0.1, Fig. 7). Significant
heterogeneity was found among the included studies (I2
,
39%; p = 0.09). The studies by Kim et al. [24] and Todoroki
et al. [32], who reported the least favorable effects of ART,
were the main contributors to this heterogeneity. After exclusion of these two studies, the heterogeneity was not
significant (I2
, 0%; p = 0.5), but the effects of ART remained
nonsignificant (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.75–1.57; p = 0.66).
Toxicities
The toxicities reported in the included studies are shown
in Table 2. Acute and late toxicities were generally tolerable. The rates of grade 3 or higher acute toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, etc.)
and chronic toxicity (gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcer,
digestive tract obstruction, bile duct stricture, etc.) were
low. A few patients required surgery because of severe
toxic reactions, such as bleeding and stenosis.
Literature publication bias evaluation
The publication bias of the included studies is shown in
Table 3. The p value for publication bias regarding the
overall 5-year OS was < 0.05, suggesting the presence of
publication bias, and the remaining comparisons had a p
value of > 0.05, indicating no significant publication bias.
Egger’s regression test showed that publication bias
existed in the 5-year OS. The scissor method showed
that the combined results of the effect indicators before
and after clipping were 0.468 (95% CI, 0.216–0.720) and
0.242 (0.011–0.474), respectively, using the fixed effects
model and 0.523 (95% CI, 0.229–0.818) and 0.270 (−

Discussion
This analysis included 21 studies (involving 1465 patients) that assessed the impact of ART on GBC and
EHCC. In this comprehensive review and meta-analysis,
we found that patients who received ART had a significantly better 5-year OS rate and lower local recurrence
rate than those who did not receive ART. The results of
our study were, to some degree, consistent with those of
previous meta-analyses [35–37]. Horgan et al. concluded
that adjuvant therapy was beneficial for high-risk biliary
tract cancer patients, including those with lymph nodepositive disease (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30–0.80) and those
who underwent margin-positive resection (HR, 0.36;
95% CI, 0.19–0.68) [35]. Kim et al. reported that ART
reduced the risk of death (HR, 0.54; 95% CI 0.44–0.67;
p < 0.001) and recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.98;
p = 0.04) among patients with GBC [37]. However, being
different from these studies, our study included several
retrospective studies assessing the role of ART that were
published recently, and we focused on the long-term (5-
year) survival benefit of ART. In particular, we analyzed

the effect of ART on local recurrence and distant metastasis. Our results suggest that ART is warranted and should
be considered in prospective studies involving GBC or
EHCC. Currently, there is no standard adjuvant treatment
for patients with GBC or EHCC, and the controversy
regarding whether the addition of ART improves OS in
these patients has not yet been resolved [38–43]. Data are
emerging from several prospective trials on the efficiency of
adjuvant chemotherapy for GBC or biliary tract cancers,
but prospective trials involving ART are scarce [44–46].
The BILCAP trial suggested that capecitabine, comparing
with observation, can improve OS in patients with resected
biliary tract cancer when used as adjuvant chemotherapy
following surgery; however, this study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving OS in the intention-to treat
population [44]. In a randomized phase III study conducted by Edeline J et al., adjuvant gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was found to offer no benefit in resected biliary
tract cancer patients [45]. From the two trials, we can see
that the benefit of adjuvant CT was unclear and patients
may not receive much benefit from adjuvant CT, so it is
necessary to explore the effect of ART with or without adjuvant CT. Recently, the SWOG 0809 trial of GBC and
EHCC, a prospective single-arm trial, demonstrated that
gemcitabine and capecitabine followed by concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy had promising efficacy and the
toxicity was acceptable [2]. Tran Cao et al. reported that
ART was associated with a lower risk of death relative to
surgery alone for patients with lymph node-positive GBC
regardless of margin status (margin-negative resection:
HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52–0.84; margin-positive resection:
HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39–0.75) [47]. Lau et al. showed that
the combination of surgery and radiation resulted in
significantly longer survival than surgery alone (4.0 versus
3.7 years, p = 0.0004) [48]. However, some studies have
shown that ART cannot benefit GBC and EHCC patients.
For example, Leng et al. reported that ART did not improve the OS (22 vs 23 months, p = 0.978) of patients with
curative intent resection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
[49]. Among the studies in our meta-analysis, Borghero
et al. [15] concluded that ART did not benefit patients,
but the margins were negative in the observation group,
and the margin-positive rate in the radiotherapy group
was 64%. Therefore, the failure of radiotherapy to improve
the 5-year OS may be due to the higher proportion of
margin-positive patients in the radiotherapy group.
Some special points need to be noted in our study. Given
the retrospective nature of these studies on GBC or EHCC
patients who underwent surgery, it is reasonable to assume
that a majority of the included patients who received ART
were selected because of high-risk features, as our study
showed that patients who received ART are more likely to
have lymph node- and margin-positive disease. Thus, it is
difficult to draw a conclusion on the best treatment for
low-risk patients. In our analysis, only 3 studies reported
the 5-year OS of patients with margin-negative disease,
and we could not evaluate the effect of ART on lymph
node-negative disease. Other details, such as the lymph
Fig. 4 Forest plot of 5-year OS for margin-positive disease

node and margin status and the corresponding 5-year OS,
were not always reported in the 21 studies. Thus, only five
studies reported the effects of ART on patients with
lymph node-positive disease, and four studies reported
such data on those with margin-positive disease. Therefore, the results of the three analyses should be interpreted
with extreme caution.
In terms of toxicity regarding adjuvant therapy, ASCO
clinical practice guidelines for adjuvant therapy for resected
biliary tract cancer indicate the risk of potential harm associated with radiation therapy for patients with GBC and
EHCC [40]. However, in our included studies, the toxic reactions to radiotherapy were tolerable, and the incidence of
acute toxicity above grade 3 (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, etc.) and chronic toxicity
(such as peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, digestive
tract obstruction, bile duct stricture, etc.) was low. Severe
toxic reactions, such as bleeding and stenosis requiring surgery, were rare.
This study also had several limitations. First and foremost, all the included studies were retrospective analyses
and influenced by selection bias and treatment variations
during the study period. However, all of these studies compared ART with no ART, and they all evaluated the same
endpoints. Thus, we think that a meta-analysis is warranted
to confirm the effect of ART on GBC and EHCC patients.
Second, the number of patients included in each study was
relatively small. Considering that registry study information
is always incomplete and may overlap with institutional
study information, we excluded registry studies. Third, due
to the lack of relevant data, the efficacy of postoperative
ART alone cannot be assessed, and because not all studies
reported other details such as pathological condition and
grade, it was difficult to draw conclusions regarding the

best treatment for low-risk patients with early-stage, lymph
node-negative disease.
Conclusion
GBC and EHCC are rare and aggressive tumors for which
there is no standard adjuvant treatment. Our study provides
supporting evidence for the clinical application of ART in
GBC and EHCC. The subgroup analysis in our study
showed that patients at high risk due to lymph nodepositive disease and margin-positive disease can benefit
from ART. For patients with margin-negative disease, ART
also had a trend to improve 5-year OS. We also conclude
that ART can reduce the rate of local recurrence but does
not affect the distant metastasis rate. Considering that no
prospective trial has evaluated the effect of ART on GBC
and EHCC, our study may contribute to the rational design
of a prospective study and provide a reference for clinical
treatment.
