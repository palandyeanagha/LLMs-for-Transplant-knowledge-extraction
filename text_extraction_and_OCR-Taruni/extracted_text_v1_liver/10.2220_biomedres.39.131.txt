ABSTRACT
Immunosuppressive therapy is considered as one of the factors inducing to the onset of osteoporosis after organ transplantation. Chronic immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation is required for organ transplant patients, and it is important to prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic 
fractures to maintain the quality of life in patients. In this study, we examined the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on bone metabolism in rats. Five-week-old male Wistar rats were treated 
orally with 15 mg/kg cyclosporine or 1.5 mg/kg tacrolimus daily for 4 weeks. Each of cyclosporine and tacrolimus significantly reduced the bone strength of the femoral mid-diaphysis and bone 
mineral density of the tibia and femur. Bone histomorphometry showed that the administration of 
both drugs resulted in a decrease in bone volume, number and thickness of trabeculae, and an increase in trabecular separation. Bone formation parameters such as osteoid volume, osteoblast surface, mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate significantly increased 
in the cyclosporine-treated group. Bone resorption parameters such as eroded surface, osteoclast 
surface, and osteoclast number significantly increased in both the cyclosporine- and the tacrolimustreated groups. These results showed that cyclosporine increases both bone formation and bone 
resorption, leading to a high-turnover bone loss, and that tacrolimus increases bone resorption 
without affecting bone formation, leading to bone loss.
As osteoporotic fractures decline quality of life 
(QOL) (26) and increase mortality (25) in elderly 
patients, the prevention of these bone fractures has 
become a major concern. It is well-known that therapeutic drugs can cause bone fragility, as evidenced 
in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Recently, 
several other drugs were also clearly shown to cause 
bone fragility. We have previously reported the effects of antidiabetic (11) and antiepileptic (12, 13) 
agents on bone metabolism; these led to enhanced 
bone fragility. The present study investigates the effects of calcineurin inhibitors, which are immunosuppressants that have greatly contributed to the 
advancement of transplant therapy in recent years, 
on bone metabolism. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as 
cyclosporine and tacrolimus, are used as immunosuppressants, which inhibit the differentiation and 
proliferation of T-cells and show potent immunosuppressive actions. These drugs inhibit the synthesis of 
cytokines such as interleukin-2 by binding to immuAddress correspondence to: H. Wakabayashi, Ph.D.,

Experimental procedure. Animals were divided into 
three groups (10 rats/group): [1] control group treated 
with vehicle (0.2% CMC-Na), [2] 15 mg/kg cyclosporine-treated group, and [3] 1.5 mg/kg tacrolimus-treated group. Drugs were administered via oral 
gavage in a volume of 0.1 mL/100 g body weight 
once daily for 4 weeks. Whole blood was collected 
under CO2 anesthesia 24 h after the final drug was 
administered. The blood was centrifuged at 1500× g
for 10 min at 4°C, and the serum was stored at 
−80°C until needed. The femur and tibia were dissected, and soft tissue was removed.
Bone strength analysis. Bone strength of the femoral 
mid-diaphysis was evaluated via a three-point bending method using a mechanical testing machine 
(EZ-S; Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The femur was 
positioned on two supports placed 12 mm apart. The 
bending load was vertically applied to the mid-diaphysis with a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min until 
bone fracture. The load deformation curves were 
calculated using operation software (Trapezium X; 
Shimadzu), and the maximum load, breaking energy, and stiffness were directly calculated from the 
load deformation curve.
BMD measurements. Total BMD, trabecular BMD, 
and cortical BMD of whole femur and tibia were 
measured using quantitative computed tomography 
(QCT: LaTheta LCT-100; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with 
a pixel size of 250 × 250 μm and slice thickness of 
1 mm. The values of BMD were calculated using 
LaTheta software (ver. 1.31; Aloka).
Serum biochemical analysis. Serum calcium levels 
were measured with a commercial reagent (Denka 
Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and an automatic analyzer 
(7180; Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). 
Serum osteocalcin levels were measured with the rat 
Osteocalcin ELISA System (General Electric Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Serum tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP) levels were measured 
with the Rat TRAP assay (SBA-Sciences, Oulu, Finland).
Bone histomorphometry. We prepared non-decalcified specimens from the proximal tibia metaphysis 
according to the following method. Briefly, the tibia 
was fixed with 70% ethanol for 7 days, stained with 
Villanueva Bone Stain (basic fuchsin, fast green, orange G, and azure II; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) 
nophilin and suppressing the activity of calmodulindependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (14, 19). 
Long-term immunosuppressive treatment is essential 
for transplant recipients in order to prevent rejection 
after organ transplants. Few of the recipients can 
subsequently discontinue immunosuppressive therapy (23). Serious complications after organ transplants, such as onset of osteoporosis and an increase 
in risk of bone fracture, have been reported (3). Immunosuppressive therapy is considered as one of the 
factors inducing to the onset of osteoporosis after 
organ transplantation (32). Several studies have been 
conducted to elucidate the onset mechanism of bone 
loss induced by calcineurin inhibitors. It has been 
reported that cyclosporine induces the reduction of 
bone mineral density (BMD) by promoting bone 
formation and bone resorption (6). Meanwhile, other 
studies have also indicated that cyclosporine suppresses bone resorption (28), inhibits osteoclast activity, and promotes osteoblast activity (20). As with 
cyclosporine therapy, tacrolimus therapy has been 
reported to significantly reduce the BMD in transplant recipients (21, 27). However, tacrolimus has 
been reported to significantly decrease osteoclast 
number and increase bone volume (1). Because 
combined therapy of steroids, which cause severe 
osteoporosis, and calcineurin inhibitor is common in 
clinical practice, the effect of monotherapy with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus on bone metabolism 
has not been accurately evaluated. Thus, the aim of 
this study was to examine the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on bone metabolism in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. Five week-old male Wistar rats (120–130 g) 
were purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The rats were housed at 22 ± 2°C and 55 ± 5% 
humidity on a 12 h light-dark cycle with ad libitum
access to a standard chow (MF; Oriental Yeast Co., 
Tokyo, Japan) and water. All procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Niigata 
University of Pharmacy and Applied Life Sciences 
in accordance with the Japanese Government Animal 
Protection and Management Law, Japanese Government Notification on Feeding and Safekeeping of 
Animals.
Drugs. Commercially available agents of cyclosporine (Novartis Pharma K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and tacrolimus (Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were 
obtained, and suspended in 0.2% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,

used in the calculation of mineralizing surface per 
bone surface [(dLS+sLS/2)/bone surface], mineral 
apposition rate (Ir.L.Th/Ir.L.t), and bone formation 
rate per bone surface ([mineral apposition rate×mineralizing surface/osteoid surface]/bone surface). Fig. 1 
shows the scheme of the primary parameters (29). 
Standard bone histomorphometrical nomenclature, 
symbols, and units were based on those described in 
the report of the American Society for Bone and 
Mineral Research Histomorphometry Nomenclature 
Committee (5).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean
± standard error (SE). Differences between groups 
were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by 
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Bone strength properties
The following parameters of the femoral mid-diaphysis significantly decreased in the cyclosporine- and 
tacrolimus-treated groups compared with that in the 
control group: maximum load (32%, 17%), breaking 
energy (38%, 30%), and stiffness (34%, 18%) (Table 1).
in 70% methanol for 7 days, and embedded in methyl methacrylate resin. The resin blocks were then 
sliced to 5-μm thickness with a microtome (Leica 
RM2255; Leica Inc., Nussloch, Germany). All bone 
histomorphometric parameters were measured at the 
secondary spongiosa region. To exclude the primary 
spongiosa, the measurement region was 0.8–1.3 mm 
distal to the lowest point of the growth plate and 
0.2 mm from the lateral cortex.
Bone histomorphometric measurements were performed using a semiautomatic image analyzing system (Histometry RT CAMERA; System Supply, 
Nagano, Japan) with ×320 magnification. Bone structural parameters obtained included bone volume per 
tissue volume, thickness, number of trabeculae, and 
trabecular separation. Bone formation parameters 
obtained included osteoid volume per bone volume 
and osteoblast surface per bone surface. Bone resorption parameters included the eroded surface, osteoclast surface, and osteoclast number per bone 
surface.
The dynamic parameter was measured using a 
double fluorescent labeling technique. For labeling, 
all rats were injected subcutaneously with 25 mg/kg 
of tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mg/kg of calcein (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) 
5 and 2 days before they were euthanized, respectively. The labeled surface that reflected the calcification front at the time of tetracycline and calcein 
administration was visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX50; Olympus America Inc.,

cant difference in serum calcium levels among all 
groups. However, in the cyclosporine-treated group, 
serum osteocalcin levels and TRAP levels significantly increased (92%, 60%, respectively) compared 
with the control values. Serum TRAP levels significantly increased (31%) in the tacrolimus-treated group 
compared with control values. These results suggested that cyclosporine promotes both bone formation 
and bone resorption, while tacrolimus accelerate 
bone resorption without affecting bone formation.
Bone histomorphometric evaluation
For the cancellous bone structural parameters, cyclosporine or tacrolimus treatment significantly reduced 
bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) (54%, 
33%), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (20%, 12%), and 
trabecular number (Tb.N) (38%, 25%), and increased 
trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (68%, 45%) relative to 
that in the control group (Fig. 2). Additionally, cycBMD
The cyclosporine-treated group exhibited significantly 
decreased total BMD (15%, 13%), trabecular BMD 
(16%, 20%), and cortical BMD (8.3%, 5.7%) of the 
whole femur and tibia, respectively, compared with 
that in the control group (Table 2). Additionally, the 
tacrolimus-treated group showed significantly decreased total BMD (9.3%, 8.7%), trabecular BMD 
(8.8%, 13%), and cortical BMD (4.9%, 3.9%) of the 
whole femur and tibia, respectively, compared with 
that in the control group. Furthermore, total BMD, 
trabecular BMD, and cortical BMD of the femur in 
the cyclosporine-treated group were significantly lower than that in the tacrolimus-treated group. These 
results indicated that cyclosporine induces more severe decreases of BMD than tacrolimus.

Effect of calcineurin inhibitor on bone 137
teoclasts maintain a certain balance and function 
(15). The term “bone quality” refers collectively to 
elements other than BMD that affect bone fractures 
and is mainly defined by bone microstructure, bone 
turnover, and bone mineralization (18). To accurately evaluate the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on bone metabolism, evaluation of both BMD 
and bone quality is necessary. This study used bone 
histomorphometry to evaluate the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on bone quality. Cyclosporine 
and tacrolimus significantly reduced bone volume 
per tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.
Th), and trabecular number (Tb.N), and significantly 
increased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), showing 
that each calcineurin inhibitor causes rarefaction of 
the cancellous bone in the proximal tibia metaphysis. Cyclosporine significantly elevated both bone 
formation parameters and bone resorption parameters. Additionally, kinetic parameters were assessed 
by bone histomorphometry in this study. As a result, 
mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS), mineral apposition rate (MAR), and bone formation rate 
per bone surface (BFR/BS) significantly increased 
in the cyclosporine-treated group. These kinetic parameters are considered to represent the mineralization, differentiation, and proliferation of osteoblasts 
(24). Likewise, the evaluation of serum bone metabolism markers showed a significant elevate in osteocalcin levels, a bone formation marker, and TRAP 
levels, a bone resorption marker, in the cyclosponificantly suppress bone loss in adjuvant arthritic 
rats (4), reduce osteoclast activity and promote osteoblast activity (20). However, further details of the 
effect of cyclosporine on bone metabolism have not 
been clarified. In order to safely perform immunosuppressive therapy in transplant recipients, it is 
important to accurately evaluate the effects of immunosuppressants on bone metabolism. This study 
was performed to examine the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which currently are the essential 
drugs for organ transplantation, on bone metabolism. The efficacy of tacrolimus’ immunosuppressive 
effects has been clarified in several animal experiments, and its immunosuppressive activity is about 
10 times greater than that of cyclosporine (7, 30). 
The dose of tacrolimus used in this study was set at 
1.5 mg/kg based on previous animal reports (9, 10). 
Therefore, the dose of cyclosporine was set at 
15 mg/kg. Because the three-point bending test of 
femoral mid-diaphysis showed significantly reduced 
maximum load, breaking energy, and stiffness, it 
was concluded that daily administration of cyclosporine or tacrolimus for 4 weeks significantly reduced 
bone strength. In addition, BMD measurement using 
QCT showed that each calcineurin inhibitor significantly reduced total BMD, trabecular BMD, and 
cortical BMD.
Bone strength is defined by BMD and bone quality (18). To maintain BMD, it is essential that bone 
formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osFig. 4 Typical micrographs of the slices assessed by bone histomorphometry under natural light (upper photos) and fluorescence (lower photos). In the upper photos, the osteoid surface and eroded surface are indicated by the blue arrows and

rine-treated group. Consistent with Goodman et al. REFERENCES
(6), cyclosporine has been found to enhance both 
bone formation and bone resorption, leading to a 
high-turnover bone loss in which bone resorption 
exceeds bone formation. However, tacrolimus had 
no significant effect on bone formation abilities, as 
assessed by bone histomorphometry and evaluation 
of serum bone metabolism markers. Previous studies 
have shown that tacrolimus stimulates bone resorption by causing an imbalance of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK ligand/
osteoprotegerin system (31) and inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 pathway (8). 
Consistent with these findings, our study showed that 
bone resorption parameters in the tacrolimus-treated 
group significantly increased. Similarly, evaluation 
of serum bone metabolism markers showed that tacrolimus significantly elevated serum TRAP levels. 
These results showed that tacrolimus significantly 
promoted bone resorption without affecting bone 
formation, leading to bone loss. Our study showed 
significantly lower BMD of whole femur in the cyclosporine-treated group than in the tacrolimus-treated 
group, indicating that cyclosporine had more severe 
effects than tacrolimus did. In line with the results 
of this study, a previous prospective study has reported that cyclosporine induces more severe bone 
loss than tacrolimus does (16).
The limitations of this study are that the effects 
of each calcineurin inhibitor on bone metabolism 
have not been examined in a dose-dependent manner. However, previous studies have already shown 
that cyclosporine-induced bone loss depends on its 
dose and administration period (17).
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that daily 
administration of 15 mg/kg cyclosporine to rats for 
4 weeks caused a high-turnover bone loss and reduced bone strength. In contrast, 1.5 mg/kg tacrolimus was demonstrated to increase bone resorption 
without significantly affecting bone formation, leading to decreased BMD and bone strength. Organ 
transplant patients usually require chronic immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation, and it is 
important to prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic 
fractures to maintain QOL in patients. Therefore, 
patients taking calcineurin inhibitors should be monitored for changes in BMD and bone metabolism 
markers to prevent the risk of bone fractures.
