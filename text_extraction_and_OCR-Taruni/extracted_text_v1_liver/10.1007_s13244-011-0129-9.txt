Abstract Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) is a technique that has evolved over the past two
decades. It continues to have a fundamental role in the noninvasive investigation of many pancreatico-biliary disorders.
The purpose of this review is to summarise the key concepts
behind MRCP, the different techniques that are currently
employed (including functional and secretin-stimulated
MRCP), the pitfalls the reader should be aware of, and the
main clinical indications for its use.

Introduction
It has been exactly two decades since magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was first described [1].
Over this time, the technique has evolved considerably,
aided by improvements in spatial resolution and speed of
acquisition. It has now an established role in the investigation
of many biliary disorders, serving as a non-invasive alternative
to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
It makes use of heavily T2-weighted pulse sequences, thus
exploiting the inherent differences in the T2-weighted contrast
between stationary fluid-filled structures in the abdomen
(which have a long T2 relaxation time) and adjacent soft tissue
(which has a much shorter T2 relaxation time). Static or slow
moving fluids within the biliary tree and pancreatic duct appear
of high signal intensity on MRCP, whilst surrounding tissue is
of reduced signal intensity.
Heavily T2-weighted images were originally achieved
using a gradient-echo (GRE) balanced steady-state free
precession technique [1, 2]. A fast spin-echo (FSE) pulse
sequence with a long echo time (TE) was then introduced
shortly after [3], with the advantages of a higher signal-tonoise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio, and a lower sensitivity
to motion and susceptibility artefacts. Modified FSE sequences have been described, including rapid acquisition with
rapid enhancement (RARE) [4], half-Fourier acquisition
single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) [5], and fast-recovery
fast spin-echo (FRFSE) [6] sequences. Both breath-hold
(using a single shot approach) [7] and non-breath-hold
techniques (with respiratory triggering) [8] have been used,
with images obtained either as a two-dimensional (2D) or
three-dimensional (3D) acquisition. A 3D technique provides
a higher signal to noise ratio, which is traded off for thinner
contiguous slices. Acquiring images with near isotropic
voxels allows improved post-processing manipulation of
the images with multi-planar reconstruction, maximum
intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering. The
introduction of faster gradients and a parallel acquisition
technique has resulted in even greater spatial resolution and
faster acquisition times. More recently, functional assessment
of biliary excretion and pancreatic exocrine function has

MRCP protocol
Patients are fasted for 4 h prior to the study in order to reduce
fluid secretions within the stomach and duodenum, reduce
bowel peristalsis and promote gallbladder distension. We do
not routinely use an anti-peristaltic agent. Some centres use a
negative oral contrast agent (e.g. iron oxide or blueberry juice)
to reduce the signal intensity of overlapping fluid within the
stomach and duodenum, although this is not part of our
routine protocol.
At our institution, MRCP is performed on a 1.5-T Avanto
MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using a phasedarray body coil. The protocol imaging parameters are shown
in Table 1. We first perform an axial 2D breath-hold HASTE
sequence. Two breath-hold acquisitions are obtained, so that
the whole of the liver down to the duodenal ampulla is
visualised.
Following this, we perform two 3D respiratory-triggered
heavily T2-weighted FSE sequences in the coronal oblique
plane. The imaging plane is selected from the initial axial
T2-weighted images, with one acquisition aligned to the
common bile duct (CBD) in the head of the pancreas and
the second acquisition aligned to the pancreatic duct at
approximately 90 degrees to the first imaging plane. Respiratory triggering is achieved with the use of a navigator
sequence that employs an MR pre-pulse to monitor respiratory
motion. The navigator is placed over the edge of the
diaphragm on the coronal and sagittal localisers and image
acquisition is triggered when the position of this diaphragm
interface with the lung falls within a pre-specified acceptance
window. In this way a consistent position of the imaging slice
is obtained. The patient is asked to breathe regularly
throughout this acquisition, which takes between 3-5 min to
acquire. A stack of 40 slices are obtained, which are
contiguous and each of 1.5 mm in thickness. As the images
are heavily T2-weighted, the pancreatico-biliary tree is
displayed as high signal intensity, whilst adjacent structures
are of reduced signal intensity. This sequence is useful in
detecting small filling defects or strictures in the biliary or
pancreatic ducts. From this volume of data, a MIP reformat
can be generated. This displays only the pixel with the highest
signal intensity along a ray perpendicular to the plane of
projection. It thus highlights bile-filled and fluid-filled
structures very well. MIP reformats can be generated in
various coronal and sagittal oblique planes. We conventionFig. 2 Normal anatomy on MRCP. The confluence of the right and
left intrahepatic ducts to form the common hepatic duct is seen (long
thin arrow). The cystic duct (*) typically joins the right side of the
common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct (CBD) (short
arrow). The main pancreatic duct (arrowheads) drains along with the
CBD into the major duodenal papilla. An accessory pancreatic duct is
present (black circle), draining into the minor duodenal papilla. Fluid
containing structures such as the gallbladder (GB), duodenum (D) and
stomach (S) are well seen on this T2-weighted sequence with the
duodenum obscuring part of the biliary tree

ally create 18 MIP reformats at 10-degree intervals to each
other over a radial array of 180 degrees.
In addition to, or as an alternative to the MIP reformats, a
thick collimation slab can be obtained in the coronal plane.
This involves performing a fat saturated HASTE sequence
where a single slab of data 4 cm in thickness is acquired in a 1-
to 2-s breath-hold. It is useful in depicting the entire
pancreatico-biliary tree and no post-processing is required.
In order to evaluate the duct walls, and any focal
parenchymal pathology, 3D fat suppressed T1-weighted
GRE sequences before and after intravenous contrast administration can also be performed.
Secretin-stimulated MRCP
Secretin is an endogenous hormone normally produced by
the duodenum, which stimulates exocrine secretion of the
pancreas. When given as a synthetic agent intravenously
(1 ml/10 kg body weight), it improves the visualisation of
the pancreatic duct by increasing its calibre. Pancreatic
juice flows out of the major duodenal papilla to progressively fill the duodenum. We perform a thick slab MRCP in
the coronal oblique plane at baseline and then at 1, 3, 5, 7
and 9 min following injection. Its effect starts almost
immediately and peaks between 2 to 5 mins. By 10 min, the
calibre of the main pancreatic duct should return to baseline
(Fig. 1a-c) with persistent dilatation of >3 mm considered
abnormal. The indications for this technique include the
detection and characterisation of pancreatic ductal anomalies and strictures, evaluation of the integrity of the
pancreatic duct, characterisation of any communication
between the pancreatic duct and pseudocysts/pancreatic
fistulas, and the assessment of pancreatic function and
sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

distally in the same patient, the cause of the obstruction is seen with a
dependent filling defect (arrowhead) in the distal CBD in keeping
with a stone. This should not be confused with the non-dependent
aerobilia also shown at this level (arrow). c Axial T2-weighted MRI in
a different patient shows a central filling defect in a dilated CBD
which is due to flow artefact (arrow). The patient also has chronic
cholecystitis with a contracted gallbladder (arrowheads)

(P) associated with the main pancreatic duct due to a history of
pancreatitis. b Thin-section MRCP image more clearly shows that this
is due to extrinsic compression from the right hepatic artery which
appears as a subtle curvilinear signal void outside the duct and

Functional MR cholangiography
This involves the use of MR lipophilic paramagnetic contrast
agents, which when given intravenously, show hepato-biliary
excretion. Contrast agents include gadobenate dimeglumine
(Gd-BOPTA, Multihance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy),
gadolinium ethoxybenzyldiethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid
(Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist; Bayer-Schering Pharma, Berlin,
Germany) and, historically, mangafodopir trisodium (Teslascan;
GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway). Delayed imaging in the axial
and coronal plane, performed between 10-120 min following
intravenous administration, normally results in hyper-intense
bile on 3D T1-weighted fat-saturated GRE images. The signalto-noise ratio is higher than conventional T2-weighted MRCP,
allowing better delineation of the bile ducts. This technique can
be used for similar indications as for T2-weighted MRCP and in
most cases has a similar diagnostic accuracy. It is more
expensive than conventional T2-weighted MRCP and only the
biliary tree is depicted. For these reasons, most centres continue
to use conventional T2-weighted MRCP. However, functional
MRCP does have a number of advantages, as follows: (1) it
better demonstrates communications between cystic lesions and
draining bile ducts in the diagnosis of congenital biliary
disorders (e.g. Caroli’s disease) [11], (2) it helps to distinguish
true obstruction in a dilated biliary system (where delayed or
no biliary excretion is demonstrated) from pseudo-obstruction
[9], and (3) it can demonstrate active extravasation of contrast
in suspected bile leaks [12, 13]. Another advantage is that
these gadolinium-based hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents
initially distribute in the extracellular fluid compartment, thus
allowing for early dynamic pre-contrast and post-contrast
images in the arterial, portal venous and equilibrium phase
prior to the functional cholangiogram.
In cases where there is significant biliary obstruction or
impaired hepatocyte function, delayed images up to 24
h can be performed until contrast is seen in the gallbladder
and duodenum.
Normal anatomy on MRCP
Only central intra-hepatic bile ducts are normally seen on
MRCP (Fig. 2), usually measuring up to 3 mm in diameter,
whilst extra-hepatic bile ducts should not exceed 7 mm. In
patients with a previous cholecystectomy, mild biliary
dilatation occurs, with the CBD measuring up to 10 mm
in diameter. The intra-hepatic biliary drainage system
parallels the portal venous supply. The right hepatic duct
has two major branches: the right posterior duct, which has
an almost horizontal course (draining posterior segments VI
and VII), and the right anterior duct, which has a more
vertical course (draining the anterior segments V and VIII).
The right posterior duct usually runs posterior to the right
anterior duct and fuses with it on its left (medial) side. The
left hepatic duct drains segments II-IV and joins the right
hepatic duct to form the common hepatic duct. Segment 1
drains via a separate bile duct usually into the origin of the
left or right hepatic duct.
The pancreatic duct should be no greater than 3 mm,
with the main pancreatic duct of Wirsung normally draining
into the major duodenal papilla along with the CBD (91%
of individuals). An accessory pancreatic duct of Santorini
may be present in 45% [14], which drains into the minor
duodenal papilla. The cystic duct usually joins the extrahepatic duct from the right lateral aspect in 50% of cases,
although it may insert into its anterior or posterior aspect in
30% and medial aspect in 20% of individuals.

Pitfalls on MRCP
A number of pitfalls may arise which fall into four main
categories: (1) artefacts related to technique and reconstruction;
(2) normal variants mimicking pathology; (3) intra-ductal
factors; (4) extra-ductal factors.
Technique and reconstruction artefacts
A thick slab MRCP may obscure small filling defects or
strictures as the spatial resolution is degraded because of
volume averaging effects. Partial volume effects also
degrade spatial resolution in MIP reformats, leading to the
missed filling defects (Fig. 3a, b) and over- or underestimation of strictures. Due to respiratory motion artefact,
the biliary tree may appear stenotic, dilated, disconnected or
duplicated on MIP reformats. Hence it is important to
always review the original thin-section data set also.
Normal variants
A long cystic duct running parallel to the CBD may
simulate a dilated common duct, whilst a contracted
choledochal sphincter may mimic an impacted stone or
stricture in the distal CBD. En face visualisation of the
cystic duct insertion into the bile duct may also simulate a
filling defect. Performing MRCP in multiple imaging
planes or carrying out repeat MRCP imaging will help
resolve these problems.
Intra-ductal factors
Filling defects in the bile may arise, not only from bile duct
calculi but also from the presence of gas, debris, haemorrhage and tumour. Aerobilia is seen as a non-dependent
filling defect on the axial images (Fig. 4a, b), whilst a
signal void in the central part of the bile duct is due to flow
phenomenon (Fig. 4c) and may occur in dilated ducts and at
the point of insertion of a large cystic duct. The presence of
iodinated contrast material will also reduce the signal
intensity of bile.
Extra-ductal factors
Pulsatile vascular compression from adjacent vessels may
mimic a stricture. The commonest site of extrinsic vascular
compression is the common hepatic duct, followed by the
left hepatic duct, both due to the right hepatic artery
crossing its posterior aspect (Fig. 5a, b). The mid portion of
the CBD may also be narrowed due to the gastro-duodenal
artery. Pseudo-obstruction is typically seen as a bandlike
compression with minimal proximal dilatation. Susceptibility artefacts from metallic clips and gas may give rise to
difficulties in interpretation, although titanium clips used

nowadays for cholecystectomy are not magnetic. Overlapping of the biliary tree with other stationary fluids (i.e.
from adjacent bowel, cystic collections or ascites) may also
cause interpretation problems.
Clinical indications for MRCP
Identification of congenital anomalies of the cystic and
hepatic ducts
A normal biliary anatomy is present in only about 60% of the
population. There are many cystic duct variants [15, 16],
including a low insertion, a medial insertion (Fig. 6), and
drainage of the cystic duct into the right hepatic duct. The
most important variant of intrahepatic bile duct branching
clinically is the presence of an aberrant right posterior
sectoral duct draining into the common hepatic duct or cystic
duct in 5% of the population. This should be recognised on
MRCP (if performed), as it may be ligated or cut at the time
of cholecystectomy. The most common anatomic variant of
intrahepatic bile duct branching, occurring in 13-19% of the
population [15, 17] is drainage of the right anterior or
posterior duct into the left hepatic duct (Fig. 7). This is
important to detect in patients undergoing left hepatectomy
for living related transplant donation as accidental ligation/
resection may lead to cirrhosis of segments 5 and 8 or
segments 6 and 7 respectively. A triple confluence [15] may
also be seen (11%) where the right posterior duct, right
anterior duct and left hepatic duct simultaneously drain
into the common hepatic duct (Fig. 8a). When ERCP is
used as the ‘gold standard’, MRCP has an accuracy of
between 90 to 95% in the diagnosis of such congenital
anomalies [16].
Post-surgical biliary anatomy and complications
ERCP is often not possible in patients with a previous
biliary-enteric anastomosis. MRCP is then useful in the
demonstration of post-surgical biliary anatomy and in the
detection of biliary complications, with a 100% sensitivity
in the diagnosis of anastomotic strictures and a 90%
sensitivity for choledocholithiasis [18].
Pancreas divisum
This is the most common pancreatic variant and is associated
with an increased prevalence of acute pancreatitis. There is

failure of fusion of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts. The
larger dominant dorsal pancreatic duct drains the tail,
body and superior head of the pancreas into the minor
duodenal papilla (Fig. 9), whilst the smaller ventral duct
drains the inferior pancreatic head and uncinate process
into the major duodenal papilla, along with the CBD.
MRCP has a 100% accuracy in the detection of this
condition [19].
Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction
Choledochal cysts are associated with anomalous union of
the pancreaticobiliary duct, where the pancreatic duct and
CBD unite outside the duodenal wall and form a long
common channel greater than 15 mm in length. There are
five different types of choledochal cyst described (Todani
classification) with three main types of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction. MRCP can assist detection of such
variants when suspected clinically.
Choledocholithiasis
This is usually performed in patients presenting with
obstructive liver function tests and with suspected gallstones and/or a dilated CBD on ultrasound. It is also carried
out in patients who have persistent symptoms and abnormal
liver function following cholecystectomy. A systematic
review of the literature has shown that when compared
with ERCP, MRCP has an aggregated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value
of 85%, 93%, 87%, and 82% respectively [20]. Stones (as
small as 2 mm) appear as dependent low-signal-filling
defects within the CBD (Fig. 8a, b), surrounded by highsignal-intensity bile.
Benign biliary strictures
These usually develop following surgical injury (95%) from
procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hepatic
resection, liver transplantation and biliary enteric anastomosis. Other causes include trauma, inflammation from
choledocholithiasis, ischaemia involving the hepatic artery
and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Typically a
benign stricture involves a short segment, with a regular
margin and symmetric narrowing. MRCP can demonstrate
the site and extent of the stricture with a reported sensitivity
of 91-100% [21].
PSC is a fibrosing inflammatory process of the bile
ducts, resulting in stenosis of both intrahepatic (80%) and
extrahepatic ducts. Seventy percent of patients have
inflammatory bowel disease [22] and 10% of patients with

PSC will develop a cholangiocarcinoma. MRCP is not as
sensitive as ERCP in the detection of early changes, but is
useful for follow-up in established cases, in order to determine
severity and to recognise the development of complications.
On MRCP, the ducts appear beaded or have a ‘pruned tree’
appearance with multifocal strictures demonstrated, with
intervening normal or slightly dilated ducts seen (Fig. 10a, b).
Malignant biliary strictures
Cholangiocarcinoma is a tumour arising from the bile ducts.
On MRCP the periductal type is seen as a biliary stricture,
involving the CBD, common hepatic duct, biliary bifurcation
(Klatskin tumour) or intrahepatic ducts. Proximal bile duct
dilatation occurs (Fig. 11a). Suspicious features include
increased wall thickness (>3 mm), increased signal intensity
on T2-weighted images (Fig. 11b) and progressive enhancement of the bile ducts (due to the fibrotic component of the
tumour) following intravenous administration of gadolinium.
A malignant extrahepatic bile duct stricture is likely to be
longer than a benign stricture, with an irregular margin and
asymmetric narrowing.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma usually appears as a focal
mass, most often in the head of the pancreas, leading to

encasement and obstruction of the pancreatic duct and/or
CBD. Dilatation of both ducts is seen in approximately
75% of cases appearing as the ‘double duct’ sign on MRCP
(Fig. 12). Although contrast-enhanced CT is conventionally
used for staging local and distant spread in pancreatic
cancers, MRCP may be used as an initial investigation in
identifying the level of obstruction in patients presenting
with painless obstructive jaundice.
Peri-ampullary carcinoma can lead to high-grade obstruction of the CBD with abrupt termination on MRCP (Fig. 13).
There is usually only mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct.
Chronic pancreatitis
Chronic inflammation of the pancreas results in parenchymal destruction with fibrosis, fat necrosis and dystrophic
calcification. Strictures in the main pancreatic duct may
eventually develop a ‘chain-of-lakes’ appearance with
alternating stenoses and dilatation. Side branch ectasia and
intraductal calculi occur (Fig. 14). In advanced cases there
can be marked dilatation of both the pancreatic duct and
CBD simulating the ‘double duct’ sign seen with carcinoma
of the head of pancreas. The sensitivity of MRCP in the
detection of early side branch changes can be increased
with the use of secretin-stimulated MRCP [23].
Pseudocysts are encapsulated fluid collections seen in
both acute and chronic pancreatitis (Figs. 5, 6). These often
develop within the lesser sac. MRCP is more sensitive than
ERCP in demonstrating these fluid collections and may
show their connection with the pancreatic duct. With ERCP,
less than 50% of pseudocysts opacify with contrast [24].
Cystic pancreatic tumours
Cystic pancreatic tumours include serous cystadenomas,
mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm (IPMN). Often, small cystic lesions within the
pancreas are detected incidentally on CT performed for other
indications. MRCP can help delineate these tumours more
clearly (Fig. 15a, b). Table 2 shows the difference in
epidemiology and MRCP morphology between these cystic
tumours.
Biliary injuries
Following transection of the bile ducts (usually following
surgery), bile accumulates within the sub-hepatic space.
Fluid collections can be appreciated on MRCP with
transection of the affected bile duct. If functional MRCP
is used, extravasation of contrast from the biliary tree is
seen. A stricture may develop following accidental ligation
or transection, with upstream dilatation demonstrated on
MRCP.
Conclusion
The technique of MRCP has evolved considerably over the
last 2 decades, with technological advances in both
acquisition and post processing. It remains the investigation
of choice for the non-invasive diagnosis of many
pancreatico-biliary disorders. It is hoped that this review
has helped remind the reader as to the basic concepts
behind MRCP, the different sequences that can now be
employed, the pitfalls one should be aware of, and why,
even in modern day, it remains a test fit for purpose in the
radiological investigation of biliary pathology.
