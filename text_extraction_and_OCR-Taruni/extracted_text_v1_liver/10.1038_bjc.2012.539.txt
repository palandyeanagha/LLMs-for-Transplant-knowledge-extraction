Background: Sorafenib has recently been shown to reduce tumour growth in hepatoblastoma (HB) xenografts. The effect of a
combined administration with cytostatic agents was now investigated.
Methods: Cell viability after treatment with sorafenib and different cytostatic agents was evaluated in two HB cell lines (HUH6 and
HepT1) using MTT assay. ERK signalling was investigated by western blot, NOXA expression by rt-PCR, and formation of DNA
adducts using immunocytology. NMRI mice bearing subcutaneous HUH6-derived tumours were treated with sorafenib alone or in
combination with cisplatin. Tumour progression, viability, apoptosis, and vascularisation were monitored by tumour volume, AFP
levels, TUNEL assay, and CD31 immunostaining, respectively.
Results: The combination of sorafenib and cisplatin led to a remarkable decrease in cell viability. The cisplatin-induced enhanced
ERK1/2 activation, but not NOXA expression and the formation of DNA adducts was partly abrogated by sorafenib. In HB
xenografts, both, sorafenib and alternated application of sorafenib and cisplatin significantly reduced tumour growth (Po0.05).
Levels of AFP were lower in both treated groups (P ¼ 0.08). Relative apoptotic areas were increased (P ¼ 0.003). Mean vascular
density was the lowest in the sorafenib/CDDP group (P ¼ 0.02).
Conclusion: The combination of sorafenib with cisplatin might be a promising treatment option for high risk or recurrent HB.
The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) has been
shown to exert a potent tumour growth inhibition in vitro for
various types of cancer (Wilhelm et al, 2008). While sorafenib is
established in the treatment of advanced HCC in adults, little is
known about the impact of sorafenib in childhood liver cancer
(Llovet et al, 2008; Schmid et al, 2012). Preliminary data indicate a
possible role for sorafenib in paediatric HCC (Schmid et al, 2012).
In xenotransplanted hepatoblastoma (HB), treatment with sorafenib recently evidenced a potent inhibition of tumour growth
and angiogenesis (Eicher et al, 2012).
Hepatoblastoma is the most common liver tumour in children
with a 3-year overall survival of 95% in the standard risk group.
However, survival of children with high risk or recurrent HB
remains poor (3-year survival 67%) (Zsiros et al, 2010).
The impact of sorafenib is based on its dual action. Within
tumour cells, it reduces tumour cell proliferation by blocking
seronine/threonine kinases and induces apoptosis by reduction of
the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (Wilhelm et al, 2004). Furthermore, sorafenib acts in an anti-angiogeneic manner by inhibiting
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including endothelial growth

factor receptor VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and stem cell factor receptor
(KIT) (Wilhelm et al, 2008). Both effects are transduced by the
ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signalling pathway.
An increased phospho-ERK1/2 activity in patients with HCC
has been correlated with a good response to sorafenib (Abou-Alfa
et al, 2006).
Since chemotherapeutic agents are firmly established in
treatment study protocols of HB, we investigated the impact of
sorafenib in combination with different cytostatic agents on HB
cell lines and in a xenotransplanted HB mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture. Two continuous HB cell lines were used for all
experiments. The cell line HUH6 was derived from a mixed HB
(Doi, 1976). The HepT1 cell line originated from a multifocal
embryonal HB (Pietsch et al, 1996). Cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Biochrom, Berlin,
Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1%
L-glutamine on plastic culture dishes (Greiner, Essen, Germany).
Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2 at 37 1C and were proven to be Mycoplasma negative.
Preparation of sorafenib. BAY 43-9006 POWD 50 MG TOS 003
SOL (sorafenib) was kindly provided by Bayer HealthCare (Berlin,
Germany) and used for all experiments. For in vitro studies,
sorafenib was dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted in DMEM to
the required concentration with a final DMSO concentration of
0.1%. For animal studies, BAY 54-9085 was dissolved in a
Cremophor EL/Ethanol (50 : 50, Cremophor EL; Sigma, Munich,
Germany) solution at 10-fold of the highest dose and stored at
4 1C. This stock solution was freshly prepared every 3 days.
Through dilution in glucose 50%, solutions with the final doses
were prepared immediately before administration.
Cell viability. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (Becton
Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) as described above.
5  103 HUH6 cells and 2  104 HepT1 cells were seeded in 100 ml
culture medium. Cells were treated with CDDP (HUH6 þ HepT1:
0.15–10 mg ml  1
), Doxorubicin (HUH6: 0.009–0.6 mg ml  1;
HepT1: 0.078–5.0 mg ml  1
), Irinotecan (HUH6 þ HepT1:
0.78–50 mg ml 1
), Topotecan (HUH6 þ HepT1: 0.006–0.4 mg ml 1)
with and without sorafenib (1, 2 mM) for 72 h. Drug diluents were
prepared shortly before administration. Cell viability was assessed by
MTT (3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide) assay (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) as previously
described (Eicher et al, 2012). Absorption at 570 nm was measured
using a Milena Kinetic Analyzer (DPC Bierman, Bad Nauheim,
Germany). All assays were performed in triplicates. Cell viability was
normalised to control cultures.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analyses were carried out as
previously described. P44/42 (ERK1/2) mouse mAb (#4696) and
phospho-p44/42 (pERK1/2; Thr202/Tyr204) rabbit mAb were used
in a concentration of 1 : 2000 (#9101, both from Cell Signaling
Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as control for protein
loading (1 : 200, sc-25778; Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany).
HRP-labelled secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH,
Freiburg, Germany) served for visualisation by chemiluminescence
(Roti Lumin, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Densitometric
analysis was carried out using AlphaDigiDoc software (Biozym
Scientific, Oldendorf, Germany).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Hepatoblastoma cell lines HUH6 (3  105 cells) and HepT1 (4  105 cells)
were treated with CDDP (2 mg ml  1
), Sorafenib (3 mM), or a
combination of both for 72 h before RNA isolation. Total RNA was
then isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit in a QIAcube according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse
transcription was performed using a high capacity cDNA archive
kit and 1 mg RNA into 20 ml assay (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany). The gene expression level of NOXA was measured by
TaqMan detection via quantitative real-time reverse transcription
PCR, using the primer NOXA (PMAIP1, HP214062, sense
50
-CTGGAAGTCGAGTGTGCTACTC-30, antisense 50-TGAA
GGAGTCCCCTCATGCAAG-30
; Origene, Rockville, MD, USA).
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Hs99999905_m1;
Applied Biosystems) served as control.
The reactions were performed in MicroAmp optical 96-well
reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) and incubated for 2 min at
501C for 1 cycle, for 10 min at 95 1C for 1 cycle, for 15 s at 95 1C for
1 cycle and for 1 min at 60 1C for 40 cycles using CFX96 Real-Time
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). Relative
expression levels were calculated using the D threshold cycle
method (DCT) with GAPDH as control. Differences in gene
expression were calculated by the DD threshold cycle method
(DDCT) using the corresponding untreated culture as reference
sample.
CDDP uptake. 106 HUH6 cells were incubated with 100 ng ml  1
CDDP or 100 ng ml  1 CDDP and 3 mM sorafenib for 24 h. Two
experiments were carried out in triplicates.
Cells were trypsinised with 0.2% Typsin (DMEM; Biochrom),
counted, homogenised by ultrasound for 20 s and stored until
measurement at  80 1C. For analysis, samples were brought to
room temperature in the dark and diluted 5–10 min before
measurement.
Platinum concentration in cell suspension was assessed in
duplicates by a GFAAS (graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectrometry) system (Unicam M Series SOLAAR AA Spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany).
Absorbance of platinum was measured at 265.9 nm with Zeeman
background correction in the calibration modus using standard
addition.
Samples or standard platin solutions (Platinum Standard for
AAS, TraceCERT, FLUKA, Seelze, Germany) were diluted with 2%
nitric acid (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, Canada) in 0.02% Triton X-100
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) prior measurement. The recovery
rate of a platinum standard of 50 ng ml  1 ranged from 91.41% to
109.87% (mean: 98.44%). To estimate the precision, five samples of
cell suspension were spiked with standard (50 ng ml  1
) and
measured on two different days. The standard deviation of the
results was 3.43 ng ml  1 and the relative standard deviation was
6.96%. The limit of detection for platinum in the cell suspension
was 2.6–3.3 ng ml  1
.
Measurement of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand adducts in DNA. The
anti-neoplastic activity of cisplatin is based on the formation of
platination products in the nuclear DNA, with the guanine–
guanine intrastrand crosslink cis-Pt(NH3)2d(pGpG) [Pt-(GpG)]
representing 470% of total DNA platination.
Plated cells were treated with cisplatin (5, 10 mg ml  1
) and were
maintained in that medium for 5 or 10 h. Cells were harvested,
washed twice in PBS, resuspended and placed on pre-coated
microscopic slides (Superfrost Gold, ThermoFisher). Pt-(GpG)
intrastrand crosslinks in the nuclear DNA of individual cells were
visualised and measured by an immunocytological assay (ICA)
using the Pt-(GpG)-specific antibody ‘R-C18’ essentially as
described (Liedert et al, 2006). Briefly, cells were fixed in methanol
followed by alkaline denaturation (70 mM NaOH, 140 mM NaCl in
40% methanol, 0 1C, 5 min) and sequential proteolytic digestion
with pepsin (100 mg ml  1
) and proteinase K (50 mg ml  1; both
from Roche, Grenzach, Germany). After blocking with skim milk,
DNA adducts were visualised by indirect immunostaining with

primary antibody R-C18 and Cy3-rabbit anti-rat IgG secondary
antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclear DNA was
counterstained with DAPI (100 mg ml  1
). Integrated Cy3- and
DAPI-derived fluorescence signals from individual nuclei were
measured separately by digital image analysis (ACAS 6.0
Cytometry Analysis System, Ahrens Electronics, Bargteheide,
Germany), Cy3 signals were normalised to the corresponding
DAPI signals of the same nucleus. Mean values±95% confidence
intervals of 4100 cells per sample were calculated and expressed as
arbitrary fluorescence units (AFUs).
Animals and xenotransplantation. Xenotransplantation was
performed as previously described using 6- to 8-week-old female
athymic NMRI-Foxn1nu mice (Warmann et al, 2003). In total,
0.5 ml HUH6 tumour cell suspension (2–3  106 cells) was
subcutaneously injected into paravertebral areas. Treatment was
initiated when tumours had reached a diameter of 5 mm. The
animals were divided into three groups: (1) control, (2) sorafenib
and (3) combination of sorafenib with CDDP. Observation time
was 25 days. CDDP was applied intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a
concentration of 3 mg kg  1 bodyweight on days 1–3 and 14–16.
To avoid a possible interaction, Sorafenib tosylate was administered alternately once a day with a dosage of 30 mg kg  1
bodyweight p.o. on days 4–13 and 17–24. Control animals were
left untreated. Tumour growth and serum a-fetoprotein (AFP)
were monitored to determine treatment efficiency. Tumour
volumes of treated and control groups (V¼ 4/3p  a/2 b/2 c/2)
were measured every 5 days. Blood samples were taken from the
retrobulbar plexus on days 0 and 25. Levels of AFP were determined
by ELISA (DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg/Lahn, Germany).
On day 25, tumours were explanted and prepared for histological
analysis. All animal studies were approved by the local government’s
ethical authority for animal experiments (Regierungspra¨sidium
Tuebingen, No. CK 1/08 and K 5/09), which are in line with the
guidelines for the welfare and use of animals in cancer research
(Workman et al, 2010).
TUNEL assay. Apoptosis in explanted tumour tissue was assessed
using TUNEL assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Paraffinembedded and formalin-fixed tissue sections were transferred into
TUNEL reaction mixture (50 ml/section) containing a terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and fluorescein-dUTP. Cells
positive for apoptosis showed a green fluorescent signal and were
visualised by a Zeiss Axio Scope epifluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany) and AxioVision software 3.1
(Carl Zeiss Vision, Aalen, Germany). For statistical analysis, the
area of apoptotic tumour of each section was determined and
related to the total area of the section.
Vascularisation. Paraffin-embedded sections were used for
immunohistochemical staining against CD31. For each group,
three micron sections were cut (10 mm) from 4 to 5 different
paraffined tumour blocks and mounted onto SuperFrost Plus
microscope slides (R Langenbrinck, Emmendingen, Germany).
Unspecific binding sites were blocked by PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% goat serum (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA, USA). Sections were incubated with monoclonal rat anti-mouse
CD31 antibody (1 : 20; Dianova) overnight. A polyclonal rabbit antirat IgG antibody (1 : 100 biotin-labelled; Biozol, Eching, Germany)
was used as secondary antibody. Avidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex

(ABC) method was applied using ABC-Kit PK-6100 standard
(Linaris, Wertheim, Germany). The peroxidase substrate kit
ImmPACT AEC (SK-4205; Linaris) was used for visualisation.
Positive endothelial cells were stained red. For nuclear staining,
sections were counterstained in Mayer’s Haemalaun solution.
Sections were then embedded in Dako Fluorescent Mounting
Medium (Dako GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and analysed by
inverted microscopy (Axiovert 135; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany). For each section, mean vascular density (MVD) was
assessed as the number of blood vessels per hyperfield at 10-fold
magnification for a minimum of 10 fields and 4 samples per tissue
specimen. Two independent examiners performed this quantification. Areas of peripheral connective tissues and necrotic/apoptotic
areas were excluded.
Statistical analyses. Cell viability was analysed by one-way
ANOVA (GraphPad Prism 4.00; GraphPad Softwares Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA). Viability curves were fitted with a sigmoidal dose
response function with variable slope and were analysed by twoway ANOVA and Bonferroni-post test. AFP blood levels, relative
apoptotic areas and MVD were calculated with two-tail Student’s
t-test. All numeric data are expressed as mean±standard deviation
or 95% confidence interval. A value of Po0.05 was considered as
significant.
RESULTS
Effect of sorafenib combined with different cytostatic agents on
HB cells. The effect of sorafenib with different cytostatic agents on
the viability of HB cells was first monitored by MTT assay. Cell
viability in HUH6 and HepT1 cells was decreased by cisplatin
(CDDP), doxorubicin, and irinotecan in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1). Topotecan failed to reduce cell viability. Treatment with
CDDP and sorafenib led to an enhanced reduction in both cell
lines. Viability in HUH6 cells was reduced from 2 mg ml  1 to 0.8
and 1 mg ml  1
, when combined with sorafenib at 1 and 2 mM,
respectively (Figure 1A). For HepT1, 50% growth inhibition was
assessed with 2.9 mg ml  1 CDDP and was reduced to 2.7 and
2.3 mg ml  1 in combination with sorafenib (Figure 1B). With
increasing CDDP concentration, the additive effect was abolished
in HUH6 as well as in HepT1 cells. The viability curves intersected
at concentrations higher than 4 mg ml  1 CDDP.
Combining doxorubicin and irinotecan with sorafenib also
showed an augmented reduction of cell viability, however, less
pronounced than in combination with cisplatin (Figure 1C–F).
Using higher cytostatic concentrations, the additive effect was
again eliminated. There was no effect of topotecan on HB cells,
neither as mono-therapy nor in combination with sorafenib
(Figure 1G and H).
Sorafenib reduces pro-apoptotic CDDP signalling via ERK1/2,
without alteration of NOXA expression. Effects of sorafenib are
known to be transduced by the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway
(Gollob et al, 2006), and we recently showed that this pathway
might be involved in the sorafenib effect on HB cells (Eicher et al,
2012). As the combination of CDDP and sorafenib showed the
greatest benefit in MTT assay at low CDDP concentrations, we
further gained inside the mechanism by western blot analyses.
Treatment with sorafenib alone reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in HUH6 and to a lesser degree in HepT1 cells (Figure 2).
Incubating HUH6 cells with CDDP led to a remarkable activation
of ERK1/2 at 0.5 and 2 mg ml  1
, respectively (Figure 2A). Giving
sorafenib and CDDP concomitantly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was
lower compared with control, however, did not reach the effect
of sorafenib alone. Combined treatment with sorafenib and CDDP
(1, 4 mg ml  1
) showed similar effects in HepT1 cells, yet to a lesser
extent (Figure 2B).
Cisplatin was described to induce apoptosis by an ERKdependent upregulation of the BH3-only protein NOXA
(Sheridan et al, 2010). Therefore, we next evaluated NOXA
expression in HB cells. In controls of both cell lines, NOXA RNA
was present (Figure 2C). Treatment with 2 mg ml  1 CDDP led to
an increased NOXA expression in HUH6 and to a greater extent in
HepT1 cells as revealed by qRT-PCR. Sorafenib also caused an
increase in NOXA expression in both cell lines, however, to a lesser
extent. The effect of the combination of sorafenib and CDDP on
NOXA expression was comparable to those of sorafenib alone. In
contrast to the reduction of ERK phosphorylation, the CDDPinduced increase in NOXA expression in HUH6 cells was not
influenced by adding sorafenib and was diminished about onethird in HepT1 cells.
CDDP uptake and formation of DNA adducts. For human colon
cancer cells, an impaired uptake of CDDP was reported caused by
sorafenib (Heim et al, 2005). To evaluate the influence of sorafenib
in the context of a CDDP uptake in HB cells, the intracellular
CDDP concentration was measured using GFAAS assay with a
limit of detection for CDDP of 4.0–5.1 ng ml  1
. Less than 5 ng
CDDP was accumulated in 106 HUH6 cells regardless of treatment
with sorafenib. Thus, sorafenib did not significantly change the

intracellular CDDP concentration in HUH6 cells as estimated by
GFAAS assay (triplicates of two experiments, data not shown).
To further evaluate a possible interfering of sorafenib and
cisplatin, the formation of DNA adducts was investigated.
Incubating HUH6 and HepT1 cells with 5 and 10 mg ml  1 CDDP
for 5 or 10 h revealed a increased formation of Pt-(GpG) adducts
detected by immunostaining (Figure 3A). In concordance with the
augmented sensitivity to CDDP, the density of DNA adducts was
higher in HUH6 cells compared with HepT1 cells and increased in
both lines with exposure time and drug concentration. Quantitative evaluation of the Pt-(GpG) levels revealed no influence of
sorafenib on the CDDP activity (Figure 3B).
Anti-tumoral effect of sorafenib and CDDP on xenotransplanted HUH6 tumours. For in vivo studies, HUH6 tumours
were xenotransplanted subcutaneously in female NMRI-Foxn1nu
mice. Untreated HB xenografts showed an exponential tumour
growth (Figure 4A, n ¼ 11). Based on the observed interference of
sorafenib and CDDP in western blot analyses, a sequential drug
application was performed. Treatment with sorafenib (30 mg kg  1
bw p.o. on days 4–13 and 17–24) led to a significant reduced
tumour volume after 25 days compared with control (Po0.05 at
day 25, n ¼ 8). Combining both agents in an alternated schedule
led to a higher and earlier reduction of tumour volume, getting
significant from day 15 of treatment compared with controls
(Po0.05 at days 15, 20, and 25, n ¼ 10). In this group, two
tumours disappeared beyond the detection limit during treatment.
The direct comparison of the combined treatment with
sorafenib revealed a significant difference in relative tumour
volume after day 5 of treatment. However, in a multiple
comparison analysis, which is shown in Figure 4A, it did not
reach significance.

In Figure 4B, tumour volumes and AFP levels at the end
of treatment are shown. In control tumours, AFP levels
increased proportionally with the tumour volume (slope
13.10±5.676). In contrast, there was no proportional increase in
AFP levels to tumour volumes in the combined group (slope
1.544±0.6424). Interestingly, half of the animals treated with
sorafenib and CDDP had high AFP concentrations after 25 days,
despite low tumour volumes. The AFP at the end of treatment
was frequently lower in the sorafenib and sorafenib/CDDP
group compared with control mice, but failed to be significant
(P ¼ 0.08, n ¼ 5).
To further describe the anti-tumoral effect of a combined
treatment, apoptosis in paraffin-embedded tissue of HB tumour
sections was investigated by TUNEL assay. Treatment with
sorafenib revealed a significant increase in apoptosis (Figure 5B).
Sorafenib combined with CDDP showed no further increase in
apoptosis compared with sorafenib alone. Apoptotic areas were
significantly higher in tumours of sorafenib-treated mice
(21.5±3.2%) as well as in the sorafenib/CDDP group compared
with control (26.4±1.6%; P ¼ 0.003, n ¼ 5; Figure 5A).
Sorafenib did not only exert an anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effect, but also influenced angiogenesis as revealed by
CD31 staining (Figure 6A). Mean vascular density was significantly
decreased in sorafenib-treated (41.5±7.9) as well as in sorafenib/
CDDP-treated mice compared with control (73.2±6.9; P ¼ 0.02,
n ¼ 4; Figure 6B).
DISCUSSION
Based on the benefit of sorafenib treatment in adult HCC, a pilot
trial by the SIOPEL group combining sorafenib with PLADO in
childhood HCC was found to be a promising treatment approach
(Schmid et al, 2012). Since epithelial childhood liver tumours differ
from adult liver tumours in histology and biology, the anti-tumoral
impact of sorafenib cannot be clearly predicted. Recently, the case
of a child was reported with recurrent HB in which sorafenib and
bevacizumab, led to disease stabilisation for 3 months (Marsh et al,
2012). We evaluated the impact of sorafenib combined with
cytotoxic agents in preclinical HB models.
Combining sorafenib with cisplatin reduced cell viability in
HUH6 and HepT1 cells to a higher extent than cisplatin alone.
However, beyond the IC50 of both cell lines the additive effect was
abolished. Similar effects were seen combining sorafenib with
doxorubicin and irinotecan, but to a lower extent. In contrast to
previous reports of our group, showing that topotecan reduced
tumour growth in three subcutaneously grown human HB
xenografts, it failed to exert an anti-proliferative effect in HB cells
in vitro (Warmann et al, 2001). This difference might be explained
by the different growth pattern of a solid tumour compared with
the single cell culture. The observed interaction of sorafenib and
cytostatic agents has been already described and involves uptake of
cisplatin into cells (Heim et al, 2005).

Besides the commonly known effects of cisplatin inducing DNA
damage, growing evidence exists that MEK/ERK pathway is a
regulator of cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Wang et al, 2000;
Schweyer et al, 2004; Amran et al, 2005). In our study, the
cisplatin-induced ERK activation was higher in HUH6 than in
HepT1 cells, and correlated with the higher levels of Pt-(GpG)
adducts in DNA and the upregulated expression of NOXA. Thus,
cisplatin might induce apoptosis in HB cells by enhanced NOXA
expression via ERK1/2 signalling as shown in HeLa and melanoma
cells (Sheridan et al, 2010). As a main target of sorafenib, ERK
inhibition may reduce the pro-apoptotic activity of CDDP. Despite
reduced ERK activation, through combined treatment, total
expression of NOXA was not altered. Hence, induction of
apoptosis via NOXA and adduct formation by CDDP seemed to
be independent of a reduced phosphorylation of ERK and may act
additively to the reduced proliferation caused by sorafenib.
Furthermore, other pathways than ERK may be activated inducing
NOXA expression by CDDP in HB, such as the calpain pathway in
ovarian cancer cells (Al-Bahlani et al, 2011). In contrast to our
results, an enhanced ERK reduction has been described for
cisplatin and sorafenib in HepG2 cells (Chen et al, 2008).
Sorafenib might attenuate the cisplatin effect by reducing cellular
uptake of cisplatin, as reported for other solid tumours (Heim et al,
2005). Uptake studies in HB cells were not successful due to the
limit of detection below 5 ng per 106 cells. Since we found no
significant difference in the adduct levels between cisplatin and the
combined treatment, a hindered uptake of cisplatin by sorafenib
seems unlikely. Uptake of CDDP and induction of NOXA were not
alternated by the combined treatment, and are therefore not
responsible for the observed interference in the proliferation assay.
The benefit of cisplatin, in the treatment of HB, has been
demonstrated in large clinical studies, and serves as basis in further
treatment concepts including sorafenib (Perilongo et al, 2009;
Zsiros et al, 2010).
To avoid interference in vivo, sorafenib and cisplatin were
applied alternately to NMRI mice bearing subcutaneous HUH6-
derived tumours. HUH6 cells were used because of the lower
tumour incidence of HepT1 xenografts in NMRI mice. We found a
strong anti-tumoral effect of sorafenib in vivo, which was
comparable to the cisplatin mono-therapy observed in previous
studies (Warmann et al, 2005).
Combination of both agents in an alternating administration
schedule led to a stronger and earlier reduction of tumour growth.
This anti-tumoral action correlated well with the inhibition of
tumour angiogenesis, clearly indicating the role of the antiangiogeneic mechanism of sorafenib appearing in tumour tissue.
In the clinical setting, AFP is used as marker for treatment
response in HB as well as indicator for relapse after complete
remission. Sorafenib led to a decrease in serum AFP levels,
correlating with the reduction of tumour volume. AFP might
therefore also serve as molecular marker for monitoring a sorafenib
treatment in a clinical setting. However, serum AFP levels are
known to exhibit a high variance (Warmann et al, 2005). In our
study, some HB tumours showed elevated AFP levels in contrast to
low tumour volume, indicating the persistence of viable tumour
cells. Similar observations have been made in a variety of human
xenografts, characterising growth inhibition of sorafenib as disease
stabilisation (Wilhelm et al, 2004).
Our results provide evidence that combination of sorafenib and
cisplatin might be an attractive alternative for the treatment of
advanced or recurrent HB. Interference between both substances

on the level of signal transduction is probable and future efforts
seem necessary to reveal such interactions. Main goal will be a
better planning of administration of a combined therapy.
