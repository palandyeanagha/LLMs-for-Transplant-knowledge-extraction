Abstract. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of aggres‑
sive tumor that involves the intrahepatic, perihilar and distal 
biliary tree, and is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. 
The standard first‑line systemic therapy for patients with 
advanced CCA is a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin; 
targeted therapies and angiogenesis inhibitors are not widely 
used clinically at present. However, with the development of 
precision medicine, immunotherapy has started to play a more 
important role. Programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors are 
now considered a good therapeutic option for CCA. Treatments 
using chimeric antigen receptor T cells, bispecific antibodies, 
oncolytic viruses and cancer vaccines have also achieved 
satisfactory results. In addition, combinations of immuno‑
therapy with a variety of conventional therapies have shown 
some efficacy, and several studies have provided insights into 
their use in antitumor therapy. Although there are numerous 
challenges in the treatment of advanced CCA, immunotherapy 
remains a noteworthy breakthrough. The current evidence on 
the immunotherapy of CCA is discussed in the present review.

1. Introduction
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of aggressive tumor that 
involves the intrahepatic, perihilar and distal biliary tree (1). 
The mass‑forming type is the most common growth pattern 
of intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), which accounts for ~65% of all 
cases. Periductal infiltrating and intraductal growth are also 
commonly observed patterns of growth, on the basis of gross 
appearance (2). Perihilar CCA (pCCA) and distal CCA (dCCA) 
often appear as flat or unclearly defined nodular sclerosing 
tumors that diffusely infiltrate adjacent structures (2). Biliary 
intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary neoplasm 
of the bile duct are considered to be premalignant lesions of 
invasive CCA (3).
CCA accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal tumors (4). 
Globally, hepatobiliary malignancies account for 13% of 
cancer‑associated deaths, and 10‑20% of these are attributable 
to CCA (4). A study revealed that in the USA, the highest inci‑
dence of CCA is observed in Hispanic and Asian individuals 
(2.8/100,000 and 3.3/100,000, respectively), with the incidence 
and mortality rates of men being slightly higher than those 
of women (5). Cirrhosis, viral hepatitis (including hepatitis B 
and C), alcohol, tobacco, metabolic factors, non‑alcoholic fatty 
liver disease, diabetes, obesity and genetic susceptibility are 
thought to be associated with the occurrence of the disease (6). 
Inflammation and cholestasis are the main mediating factors 
in the development of CCA (7). A large, US population‑based 
case‑control study of ≥66‑year‑old patients who received 
Medicare demonstrated that autoimmunity problems, 
including systemic lupus erythematosus and vitiligo, are also 
associated with the risk of hepatobiliary cancer (8).
CCA is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. There are 
nearly no symptoms at the early stage, and it is also difficult 
to detect by imaging examination. Patients with CCA often 
suffer from abdominal discomfort, appetite loss, weight loss 
and other clinical symptoms, the most typical of which is 
painless jaundice (9). It is important to accurately determine 
a treatment plan for the disease in conjunction with imaging 
examination.
Surgery is usually the preferred treatment option, but liver 
transplantation following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also 
an option for a small number of patients with pCCA (1). The 
standard first‑line systemic therapy for patients with advanced 
CCA is a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin; targeted 
therapies and angiogenesis inhibitors have not been widely 
used in the clinic so far. It is well known that escape from 
immune surveillance contributes to the occurrence of tumors 
and, with the development of precision medicine, immuno‑
therapy serves an important role in tumor treatment (10). The

tumor microenvironment (TME) delivers survival signals 
to the tumor and might create a barrier to the delivery of 
chemotherapy (1). With the help of genetic profiling and 
classifications, the use of targeted therapies, radiation treat‑
ments and/or immunotherapy might help to improve the 
survival outcomes of patients with this otherwise devastating 
malignancy (1).
2. Immunotherapy
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD‑1) and T lymphocyte‑associated antigen 4 are 
the most common ICI drug targets. The present review focuses 
on PD‑1 and its details.
The expression of PD‑1 by tumor‑infiltrating lymphocytes 
is associated with poor prognosis (11). A study found that 
tumor cells from patients with occupational CCA exhib‑
ited immune‑escape behavior via the PD‑1/programmed 
death‑ligand 1 (PD‑L1) axis (12). Another study confirmed the 
proliferation of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells after 
blockade of the PD‑1 pathway (13). This phenomenon suggests 
that PD‑1 inhibitors may promote the monitoring of tumor cells 
by increasing the recruitment of immune cells, and that immu‑
notherapy with checkpoint molecule‑specific monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) can be effective for CCA treatment (14). 
However, PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors are not beneficial for the 
treatment of tumors in every patient (15). Pembrolizumab is 
a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) κ anti‑PD1 mAb. 
It does not trigger any cytotoxic activity, since the binding 
of pembrolizumab to PD‑1 does not engage Fc receptors or 
activate the complement system. Pembrolizumab has now 
been studied in clinical trials for multiple types of tumor (16). 
According to a report on the KEYNOTE‑158 (NCT02628067) 
and KEYNOTE‑028 (NCT02054806) clinical trials, pembro‑
lizumab has durable antitumor activity in 6‑13% of patients 
with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), regardless of PD‑L1 
expression; it also has manageable toxicity (17). Nivolumab is a 
fully human IgG4 anti‑PD‑1 monoclonal antibody that has been 
approved for multiple advanced malignancies, including mela‑
noma, non‑small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, squamous head and neck cancer and urothelial 
carcinoma (18). In a phase II clinical trial (NCT02829918) 
of nivolumab in patients with advanced refractory BTC, the 
objective response rate (ORR) of monotherapy with nivolumab 
was 11%, including a single case of unconfirmed partial 
response (PR), with a disease control rate (DCR) of 50%, as 
determined by central independent review. That study also 
reported that a median progression‑free survival (mPFS) of 
3.68 months and a median overall survival (OS) among the 
intention‑to‑treat population of 14.24 months (19).
Other biomarkers also require consideration. Indicators 
of the effectiveness of ICIs in patients with advanced 
CCA include the expression of PD‑L1, DNA mismatch 
repair (MMR) defects and/or high microsatellite insta‑
bility (MSI‑H) (20). A phase II study showed that the 
clinical benefit of pembrolizumab can be predicted by 
MMR status (21). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is also 
a common evaluation indicator of whether immunotherapy 
should be administered. The genomes of cancers with MMR 
deficiency contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic 
mutations (22). Certain studies have shown that the total 
number of somatic mutations (mutational load) is associated 
with the clinical response to ICI therapies in several types 
of tumors (23,24). However, another study showed that, as 
compared with MSI or even the TMB, the presence of immu‑
nogenic neoepitopes may be a more persuasive biomarker for 
immunotherapeutic response (25). In addition, tumor type 
may no longer be a major factor for determining the response 
to ICI (22).
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The emergence 
of CAR T cells has revitalized immunotherapy. Despite the 
toxicity profile and huge expense of CAR T cells, the clinical 
efficacy of CAR T cells in the treatment of refractory hema‑
tological malignancies is satisfactory. In the past few years, 
it has been discovered that improved second‑generation 
CARs, which usually comprise an antibody‑derived 
single‑chain variable fragment linked with intracellular 
signaling molecules, are able to activate T‑cell effector func‑
tions (26). CD28‑ and 4‑1BB‑derived domains are the most 
commonly used costimulatory domains. 4‑1BB‑containing 
CAR T cells are thought to have superior persistence, but the 
protein phosphorylation changes of signaling intermediates 
induced by CD28‑CAR T cells are stronger and faster (26). 
Third‑generation CAR T cells containing both CD28 and 
4‑1BB costimulatory domains have been demonstrated to be 
safe and effective at every dose level tested (27). Although 
fourth generation CARs, also known as T cells redirected 
for universal cytokine‑mediated killing, and fifth generation 
CARs have gradually been developed, it is unclear whether 
they have the same clinical effects as previous generations in 
malignant diseases (28). Fifth generation CARs are based on 
the second generation of CARs, but they contain a truncated 
cytoplasmic IL‑2 receptor β‑chain domain with a binding 
site for the transcription factor STAT3; the antigen‑specific 
activation of this receptor effectively provides three syner‑
gistic signals (TCR, co‑stimulatory and cytokine signals) 
required to drive full T‑cell activation and proliferation (28). 
Researchers have been exploring whether CAR T cells 
have the same anticancer effect in solid tumors as in blood 
malignancies, while facing several challenges (28). The 
same or different types of cancer may have different TMEs. 
Enhancing the infiltration of tumors by T cells has been 
suggested as a potential strategy for increasing the efficacy 
of tumor immunotherapy (29). Clinical trials of specific CAR 
T cell treatments for a number of solid tumor types have been 
conducted (30,31). The use of CAR T‑cell cocktail immu‑
notherapy may be a feasible option for patients with CCA, 
but toxicity requires further investigation (NCT01869166 
and NCT02541370) (32). A phase I study of CAR‑epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) T‑cell therapy for the treat‑
ment of patients with EGFR‑positive advanced unresectable, 
relapsed/metastatic BTC showed that 1/17 evaluable patients 
achieved complete remission (CR) and 10 achieved stable 
disease (SD). The mPFS was 4 months from the first cycle 
of treatment. This result demonstrates that this treatment is 
effective for CCA (33). At present, although there is substan‑
tial evidence from clinical trials showing the potential of 
CAR T‑cell treatment, the evidence to support its use for 
the treatment of advanced CCA is not sufficient for clinical 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20: 381, 2020 3
practice; therefore, more clinical trials are required to ensure 
the safe application of CAR T‑cell therapy.
Bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies that are able to 
recognize two different epitopes have a broad range of appli‑
cations. Great progress has been made in the treatment of 
hematological malignancies and solid tumors with T cell‑redi‑
recting bispecific antibodies (TRBAs) (34). Different TRBA 
formats have the same essential aim; directing CD3 T cells to 
target tumor cells(34). A recent study on prostate tumor‑specific 
antigen demonstrated that the combination of CD3 bispecific 
antibodies and anti‑4‑1BB co‑stimulation is a successful 
therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors (35). 
Novel IgG‑based 1 + 1 MG1122‑A and 2 + 1 MG1122‑B 
bispecific antibodies against mesothelin and CD3ε have been 
designed, and this type of construction has been shown to 
improve antitumor efficacy and tumor targeting; it may also 
reduce systemic toxicity (36). A study by Thakur et al (37) 
verified that anti‑human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2) bispecific antibody‑ or anti‑EGFR bispecific anti‑
body‑armed CD19‑CAR T cells (CART 19) aimed at multiple 
HER2+/EGFR+/CD19‑ tumor targets had specific cytotox‑
icity, and that the CART 19 model improved the survival of 
the T cells, which were even resistant to exhaustion under 
certain conditions. The results of several other studies have 
also indicated that bispecific antibodies provide satisfactory 
effects and have a wide range of applications (38,39). In 2003, 
a study reported that an anti‑mucin 1/anti‑CD3 bispecific anti‑
body indirectly increased the antitumor activity of a 4‑1BB 
ligand‑encoding adenovirus in CCA (40). However, no other 
findings about bispecific antibodies in CCA have yet been 
reported. We hypothesize that in the future, greater success 
will be achieved with bispecific antibodies in the treatment 
of CCA.
Oncolytic viruses (OVs) and cancer vaccines. OV therapy 
has emerged due to the disadvantages of traditional chemo‑
therapy. This type of treatment uses viruses with a natural or 
engineered ability to infect and kill cancer cells (41). Greater 
knowledge of the function of viral genes and advancements 
in molecular biology have significantly improved the safety 
and efficacy of OVs. The basis of the therapeutic efficacy of 
OVs is considered to be the recruitment of T cells and induc‑
tion of tumor‑reactive immunity (42). Studies have indicated 
that delivering OVs into the tumor can facilitate a strong and 
durable response against the tumor by stimulating the activity 
of the immune system (43,44). Talimogene laherparepvec is 
the only approved OV in the US to date (45). In addition, the 
use of an OV in combination with inhibition of transforming 
growth factor‑β signaling is thought to increase the efficacy 
of immunotherapy (42). According to a recent study, a novel 
Vaccinia virus known as VVΔTKΔN1L, with thymidine 
kinase and N1L gene deletions and armed with interleukin 12, 
successfully prevented the recurrence of tumors in surgical 
models of head and neck cancer in Syrian hamsters (46). 
This study laid an important experimental foundation for the 
development of new drugs in the treatment of solid tumors. 
Although good progress has been made with this antitumor 
method, a number of areas that require improvement and 
further study remain. Reinforcing the selective replication 
strength of OVs, constructing efficient OV delivery platforms, 
maintaining the balance between antiviral and antitumor 
immunity, overcoming the immunosuppressive TME and 
enhancing oncolysis are some directions of research for the 
continuous improvement of OV therapy (47). For example, 
although systemic injection has been proposed to be the best 
route of administration for an OV, local (intratumoral) injec‑
tion is the most used route of administration (48). Preclinical 
studies investigating the oncolytic effect of a measles vaccine 
virus and three survivin‑based conditionally replicative 
adenoviruses in CCA reported the possibility of treatment 
with OV (49,50). More trials are required to verify the safety 
and efficacy of these agents.
Vaccines for cancer are generally developed with a focus 
on clearing active disease rather than preventing disease (51). 
There is some evidence that dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are 
efficacious in tumor therapy; for example, Sipuleucel‑T has 
been shown to prolong the median OS of patients with prostate 
cancer (51). A non‑randomized uncontrolled study of another 
DC‑based immunotherapy in patients with BTC showed that 
the treatment was safe; however, 0/65 patients showed a CR 
at 3 months after the first vaccination. The PR and SD rates 
were 6 and 23% respectively, and the DCR and ORR were 
29 and 6%, respectively (52). In addition, honokiol may be able 
to enhance the therapeutic effect of DC‑based vaccines (53). In 
2012, a study demonstrated that a DC vaccine in combination 
with activated T‑cell transfer could be feasible and effective 
for preventing recurrence and achieving long‑term survival 
in patients with iCCA following surgery (54). These studies 
provide evidence to indicate that tumor vaccines can be helpful 
for patients with CCA. Clinical trials of immunotherapy in 
CCA are shown in Table I.
3. Combined therapy
With the continuous development of biomedical technology 
and the discovery of some deficiencies in clinical practice, 
combination therapy involving immunotherapy has the 
potential to provide improved clinical effects in numerous 
conditions.
Immunotherapy plus chemotherapy. For patients with 
advanced‑stage CCA that is not suitable for treatment with 
surgical or locoregional interventions, gemcitabine combined 
with cisplatin or oxaliplatin is the standard therapy; however, 
the response to this chemotherapy regimen is unsatisfac‑
tory. There is evidence that chemotherapy combined with 
immunotherapy may result in a good therapeutic response in 
CCA with a high TMB (55). A phase II trial (NCT03311789) 
studied the clinical response to nivolumab in combination 
with gemcitabine and cisplatin in 27 response‑evaluable 
patients with BTC, and found an ORR of 55.6%, including 
5 CRs and 10 PRs. Of the 6 patients who were resistant to 
gemcitabine‑based or cisplatin‑based chemotherapy, one CR 
and one PR were achieved. This result indicates that, as a PD‑1 
inhibitor, nivolumab is able to resensitize BTC to gemcitabine 
and cisplatin chemotherapy (56). No significant survival 
benefit was observed for this combination when compared 
with other combinations in clinical trials (56‑58). However, 
it has promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in

patients with advanced CCA (56). Patients with iCCA with 
high insertion‑deletion ratios can also benefit from treatment 
with this combination (59).
The aforementioned results may be due to the synergistic 
effect of chemotherapy and ICIs; it is suggested that the use 
of an ICI increased the efficacy of gemcitabine, which in turn 
increased the antigenicity of tumor cells and partially reduced 
the immunosuppressive effect of chemotherapy, which may be 
associated with the role of tumor‑associated macrophages (56). 
Therefore, the addition of a PD‑1 inhibitor to a chemotherapy 
regimen can better control the disease, benefit the patients and 
attenuate resistance to chemotherapy. However, as discussed 
above, the adverse reactions of ICIs are also a challenge that 
must be considered. Therefore, comprehensive management 
should be conducted to maximize disease benefits and mini‑
mize adverse reactions in clinical practice.
The combination of chemotherapy and DCs is another 
feasible combined therapy. In one clinical study of patients 
with BTCs, the median survival time (MST) was prolonged 
by DC‑based immunotherapy and chemotherapy, with a 
MST from the first vaccination of 8.2 months with chemo‑
therapy compared with 5.3 months without chemotherapy. In 
50 (77%) of the 65 patients treated with chemotherapy and 
DC vaccine, the DCR and ORR were 34 and 8%, respectively. 
In the remaining 15 patients treated with the DC vaccine but 
without chemotherapy, the DCR and ORR were 13 and 0%, 
respectively (52). In this study, a comprehensive analysis 
of associated influencing factors, including albumin level, 
C‑reactive protein level, fever after inoculation and nutritional 
index, was performed. The clinical efficacy of the DC vaccine 
following combined chemotherapy was improved compared 
with that of the DC vaccine alone, but this treatment did not 
have a clear advantage in curative effect, as compared with 
chemotherapy regimens combined with ICI.
Immunotherapy plus radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is a common 
antitumor treatment. When radiotherapy is administered, the 
sensitivity of the immune system to the tumors is increased (60). 
As mentioned above, for patients with a high TMB, MSI‑H, 
deficient MMR and/or positive PD‑L1 expression, treatment 
with a PD‑1 inhibitor may provide satisfactory results. Notably 
and unexpectedly, a case report showed that radiotherapy 
can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with 
late‑stage or recurrent iCCA with low TMB, proficient 
MMR, microsatellite stability and negative PD‑L1 expression 
status (61). This result expands the scope of treatment for CCA.
Jarnagin et al (62) demonstrated that immunotherapy 
and radiotherapy have synergistic effects in the treatment of 
CCA. In their study, which was reported in 2006, the clinical 
application of oncolytic herpes simplex virus combined with 
external beam radiation therapy yielded satisfactory clinical 
results. This efficacy was hypothesized to be associated with 
the radiation‑induced upregulation of growth arrest and DNA 
damage protein 34, which promoted tumoricidal activity in 
viral strains deficient in the γ(1)34.5 gene (62). Since then, this 
type of treatment combination has been rarely used. However, 
according to the results obtained to date, immunotherapy 
combined with radiotherapy has a certain efficacy and can 
continue to be considered as a potential direction for malignant 
tumor treatment.
Immunotherapy plus small molecule inhibitors. For CCA, 
genes affected by congenital mutations/polymorphisms 
include ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4, ATP 
binding cassette subfamily B member 11, ATP binding 
cassette subfamily C member 2, ATPase phospholipid trans‑
porting 8B1, cyclooxygenase 2, cytochrome P450 1A2 and 
glutathione S‑transferase ω‑1, and those affected by acquired 
mutations include adenomatous polyposis coli, AT‑rich 
interaction domain 1A, axin 1, BRCA1 associated protein 1, 
BCL‑2, BCL2 like 1, BRAF, EGFR (ERBB1), fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 
(IDH1), IDH2 and tumor protein 53 (7). IDH1/2 mutations and 
FGFR2 fusions are features typically observed in small‑duct 
iCCA, while they are usually absent in extrahepatic CCA. 
Furthermore, the mutation frequency of KRAS seems to 
be higher in pCCA and dCCA than in iCCA (2). Molecular 
therapy targeting these specific genes has demonstrated certain 
therapeutic effects (63), and immune drugs have also shown a 
promising clinical efficacy against these genes. A clinical trial 
(NCT01752920) was conducted in adult patients with unresect‑
able iCCA and FGFR2 fusion to investigate the preliminary 
therapeutic activity of derazantinib, an orally bioavailable, 
multi‑kinase inhibitor with potent pan‑FGFR activity. The trial 
reported an ORR of 20.7%, DCR of 82.8% and estimated mPFS 
of 5.7 months (64). Abou‑Alfa et al (65) reported the result of 
a clinical trial (NCT02924376), in which pemigatinib, a selec‑
tive, potent oral inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor 
(FGFR)1, 2 and 3, exhibited good therapeutic potential for CCA. 
Lenvatinib is a small‑molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
inhibits VEGFR1‑3, FGFR1‑4, platelet‑derived growth factor 
receptor α, stem cell factor receptor and RET (66). In a patient 
with recurrent iCCA with bone metastasis, amelioration of 
the disease was observed following treatment with nivolumab 
immunotherapy plus lenvatinib (67). This suggests that immu‑
notherapy plus molecular‑targeted therapy could be an option 
for the late‑line treatment of CCA. However, there is as yet 
no relevant evidence to support the combination of molecular 
targeted therapy and immunotherapy for the treatment of CCA; 
nor is there any clear evidence supporting its safety, efficacy 
and the benefits to patients. Despite this, it is potentially a 
feasible approach, and is worthy of further research.
Combinations of multiple immunotherapy drugs. In recent 
years, research into the efficacy of combinations of multiple 
immunotherapy drugs has begun, and their respective strengths 
are emerging. A clinical trial, NCT02923934, explored the 
efficacy and safety of a combination of two immunotherapy 
drugs, nivolumab and ipilimumab, for the treatment of CCA. 
This phase II clinical trial reported an ORR of 23%, DCR 
of 44%, mPFS of 2.9 months and OS of 5.7 months. Notably, 
all patients who responded had received prior chemotherapy, 
and none of them had a microsatellite unstable tumor (68).
Although the combination of immunotherapy drugs proved 
clinically effective in the study, dual‑drug immunization was 
not superior to single‑drug immunotherapy, with the exception 
of its effects on ORR. Dual‑drug immunotherapy remains a 
distant prospect for patients with CCA.
Immunotherapy plus antiangiogenic (AA) therapy. AA therapy 
is an type of antitumor treatment that is effective against most

tumors. The growth of cancer cells depends on blood vessels to 
supply and transport nutrients, and microvessel density is asso‑
ciated with cancer progression, metastasis and prognosis (69). 
The discovery that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
is an important mediator of angiogenesis prompted research 
into the therapeutic targeting of this pathway; furthermore, the 
expression of VEGF may be involved in hematogenic metastasis 
in CCA (70,71). VEGF has been demonstrated to be signifi‑
cantly associated with intrahepatic metastasis in iCCA, while 
in pCCA, VEGF‑A expression is thought to be upregulated and 
associated with increased vascular density. This suggests that 
AA treatments may achieve a good response in pCCA (69). A 
previous study has revealed that IDH1/2 mutations are associ‑
ated with iCCA, KRAS mutations are associated with pCCA, 
and protein kinase CAMP‑activated catalytic subunit α or β
gene fusions preferentially occur in eCCA (69). Hypoxia is 
the main stimulus for the production of VEGF, which leads to 
expression of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 
1‑α (72). In addition to the VEGF, MEK/ERK, Yes‑associated 
protein/Hippo and other pathways are also involved in angio‑
genesis (69), and may be potential targets for AA therapy. 
Bevacizumab, ramucirumab, sorafenib, regorafenib and several 
other new drugs are being used or studied for AA therapy, some 
of which have a good clinical efficacy (73‑75).
Studies have shown that PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors may 
enhance the antitumor effects of AA drugs (76,77). A preclin‑
ical study demonstrated that AA therapy also can improve 
anti‑PD‑L1 treatment in certain conditions by supporting 
vascular changes, such as vessel normalization and high endo‑
thelial venule formation, that facilitate enhanced cytotoxic 
T‑cell infiltration, activity and tumor cell destruction (77). 
The simultaneous blockade of VEGF receptor‑2 and either 
PD‑1 or PD‑L1 has been shown to induce additive antitumor 
effects (78). A non‑randomized, open‑label, phase I trial of 
ramucirumab and pembrolizumab was the first to combine 
AA therapy with an ICI to treat advanced BTC. The ORR 
was 3.8%, with mPFS and OS times of 1.64 and 6.44 months, 
respectively (78). In addition, the occurrence of adverse events 
was not negligible. These results suggest that although this 
type of combination treatment has a certain efficacy, it does 
not have a significant advantage over the aforementioned 
treatments, and may not be an optimal choice for advanced 
treatment. However, it remains to be seen whether combina‑
tions of immunotherapy agents with other AA drugs against 
other targets will achieve different results. Clinical trials for 
combined therapy in CCA are shown in Table II.
4. Conclusions
Although numerous challenges remain in the treatment of 
advanced CCA, immunotherapy is a noteworthy breakthrough. 
As discussed in this review, immunotherapy with a single drug, 
multiple drugs or a combination of traditional therapies can 
sometimes be an option for the treatment of CCA. With further 
theoretical research and evidence to validate their efficacy and 
safety, new treatment combinations may become the basis 
and direction for future studies. Combining more treatments 
may provide further benefits to patients with CCA. These new 
treatment combinations may also have implications for other 
types of cancer.
