Abstract
Adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal 
dysmotility are not uncommon and can be difficult to 
manage. This guideline gives an outline of how to make 
the diagnosis. It discusses factors which contribute to or 
cause a picture of severe chronic intestinal dysmotility 
(eg, obstruction, functional gastrointestinal disorders, 
drugs, psychosocial issues and malnutrition). It gives 
management guidelines for patients with an enteric 
myopathy or neuropathy including the use of enteral and 
parenteral nutrition.
1.0 Formulation of guidelines
1.1 Aim
This guideline aims to help clinicians manage 
patients who have or are thought to have severe 
small intestinal dysmotility that is causing malnutrition. It gives a logical guidance to determining 
the underlying diagnosis and shows how, knowing 
this, treatments may be tailored for each individual 
patient. It also aims to present some of the other 
factors contributing to the presentation and progress of the illness.
1.2 Development
The preliminary guidelines were compiled from 
the literature and a first document was drafted by 
Dr Nightingale and modified by members of the 
Neuro-gastroenterology and Motility Committee 
of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) 
and by the Small Bowel and Nutrition Committee 
of the BSG. The article was reviewed by the patient 
organisation PINNT (Support and Advocacy group 
for people on home artificial nutrition) and modifications made to result in the current document.
The guidelines have applied the GRADE system.1
Strength of recommendation can be strong, 
moderate or weak. The evidence was graded 
according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based 
Medicine.2
 Level 1 includes systematic reviews with 
homogeneity, individual randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs); level 2 includes systematic reviews 
of cohort studies, low quality RCTs and outcomes 
research; level 3 includes systematic reviews with 
heterogeneity and individual case–control studies; 
level 4 includes poor quality cohort or case series; 
and level 5 includes expert opinion without critical 
appraisal.
1.3 Scheduled review
The content and evidence base for these guidelines 
should be reviewed within 5 years of publication. 
We recommend that these guidelines are audited 
and request feedback from all users.
1.4 Service delivery
► Patients with severe chronic small intestinal 
dysmotility are not common but should be 
managed by a multidisciplinary team headed 
by a clinician with expertise in managing these 
patients. If managed appropriately, particularly 
if receiving parenteral nutrition (PN), there may 
be an improved quality of safe care and also 
considerable cost savings. (Grade of evidence 
level 4, Strength of recommendation strong)
► Any surgical procedure should be performed 
after extensive local/regional multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions at hospitals with 
surgeons and histopathologists experienced in 
managing these patients. (Grade of evidence 
level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
► Patients being considered for PN or a surgical 
bypass/resection should be seen at a dedicated 
PN centre or by an integrated intestinal failure 
(IF) unit respectively. (Grade of evidence level 5, 
Strength of recommendation strong)
► Regional networks may be established to ensure 
expertise is available to all and a national 
research forum may be established. (Grade of 
evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation 
strong)
1.5 Patients' experience
► Patients with a severe chronic small intestinal 
dysmotility causing malnutrition should be 
managed as individuals; other factors including 
opioid use and psychosocial circumstances must 
be taken into account. (Grade of evidence level 
5, Strength of recommendation strong)
► Patients will become experts in coping with 
their condition and management. All decisions 
should be made in conjunction with them. 
They are often more knowledgeable about 
their condition and treatments than the clinicians, nurses and dietitians and this should be 
respected. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength 
of recommendation strong)
► Facilities for looking after these patients 
should be able to deal with physical,

Guidelines
emotional, psychological, social and quality of life issues. 
(Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation 
strong)
► Patients should be referred rapidly to places of more 
advanced expertise if management is difficult or unsuccessful. There should be a clinician, specialist nurse and/
or a dietitian available and a psychologist/psychiatrist to 
discuss the patients. The healthcare professionals should be 
familiar to the patient and know their history, thus eliminating the need for lengthy, time-consuming explanations. 
(Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation 
strong)
► The patients should be managed on wards or IF/home parenteral nutrition (HPN) units where the healthcare professionals are familiar with their specialist needs, especially if 
receiving PN. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
► Patients, especially if receiving HPN, should have access to 
a helpline (ideally 24hours) so that emergencies are dealt 
with appropriately and quickly. (Grade of evidence level 5, 
Strength of recommendation strong)
► Written and audiovisual materials that explain and support 
the training techniques in enteral and PN should be available. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation 
strong)
► Meeting other patients with similar problems may improve 
the way in which a patient copes with their condition. (Grade 
of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
► Where appropriate, patients should be offered contact 
numbers for the relevant support group that represents 
their specific disease. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of 
recommendation strong)
► Follow-up appointments should be as deemed appropriate 
to the MDT and patient, and ideally the patient should 
not have to travel long distances for appointments. The 
appointment should be with experienced and familiar staff, 
thus enabling continuity of care. (Grade of evidence level 5, 
Strength of recommendation strong)
► Staff should be aware of the latest research and developments and should make patients aware of any which may 
apply to them. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
For patients needing home parenteral nutrition (HPN)
► The techniques needed for HPN should be taught by competent and enthusiastic staff who can convey the confidence 
required to undertake the therapy successfully and safely. 
The procedures taught should follow the British Intestinal 
Failure Alliance (BIFA) standardised parenteral support 
catheter guidelines.3
 (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of 
recommendation strong)
► Patients need to know that an aseptic technique, in which 
the key parts are not touched, must be used whenever their 
feeding line is accessed. This is vital for safety and peace of 
mind. (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong)
► All patients who require HPN whether short or long term 
should receive information about the patient support group 
‘PINNT’ (Support and Advocacy group for people on home 
artificial nutrition) and should be registered with the British 
Artificial Nutrition Survey (BANS). (Grade of evidence level 
5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.0 Summary of recommendat ions
2.1. Enteric myopathies are often a primary condition and have 
multi-visceral involvement (especially of urinary tract) and these 
other manifestations should be sought. Enteric myopathies may 
be secondary to a muscular disease (eg, muscular dystrophy) 
and an awareness of this is needed when managing the primary 
illness. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation 
strong)
2.2. Patients with an enteric neuropathy often have a serious 
underlying condition (often neurological or metabolic) which 
should be sought. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.3. A definite diagnosis should only be given when a detailed 
history, symptoms and investigations (including histology in a 
unit that has expertise in this area of pathology) confirm the 
diagnosis. If, as is commonly the case, a definitive diagnosis is 
not possible, an empirical working diagnosis of probable severe 
dysmotility may be necessary. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength 
of recommendation strong)
2.4. Mechanical obstruction must be excluded and occasionally (if radiology is inconclusive) this involves a trial of a low 
fibre (residue) diet or even a liquid diet. (Grade of evidence level 
5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.5. The contributing effects of drugs on gut motility (especially opioids and anticholinergics) must be taken into account. 
(Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.6. Psychosocial/behavioural issues often play a part in how 
the symptoms manifest and specialist psychosocial support must 
be available expediently. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of 
recommendation strong)
2.7. The effects of abrupt weight loss on the gut function must 
be taken into account. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of 
recommendation strong)
2.8. Investigations which include radiology, radioisotope 
studies, manometry, autoimmune screens and histology should 
be performed judiciously and in keeping with current guidelines, 
but may not give a definitive diagnosis. Care must be taken in 
interpreting them in the presence of some drugs (eg, opioids, 
cyclizine or anticholinergic drugs), severe malnutrition or an 
eating disorder. (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.9. These patients are complex with multiple issues contributing to their presentation and so they need MDT management. 
The team is likely to include a gastroenterologist, gastrointestinal 
physiologist, gastrointestinal surgeon, pain team, psychiatrist/
psychologist, rheumatologist (including fatigue management), 
urologist, gynaecologist, radiologist, dietitian, specialist nurses, 
clinical biochemist, histopathologist and pharmacist. Regional 
networking (can be via a virtual MDT) is encouraged both for 
support/guidance and to collect data. (Grade of evidence level 5, 
Strength of recommendation strong)
2.10. The aims of treatment for patients with severe chronic 
small intestinal dysmotility are where possible to:
► Reduce symptoms (eg, pain, vomiting, distension, constipation/diarrhoea, bloating/distension)
► Reduce morbidity and mortality
► Achieve a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range
► Achieve an improved/good quality of life. (Grade of evidence 
level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.11. Treatment should be directed at the main symptom, 
using as few drugs as possible, avoiding high doses of opioids and 
cyclizine and avoiding unnecessary surgery. Try to avoid medicalisation (eg, enteral access, suprapubic catheters, etc) early in

2.12. If the patient has taken long-term opioids, the narcotic 
bowel syndrome may have occurred and a gradual supervised 
opioid withdrawal should be considered. A pain specialist, if 
available, should be involved. (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength 
of recommendation strong)
2.13. If a patient is malnourished or at risk of becoming so, 
oral supplements/dietary adjustments should be tried. (Grade of 
evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.14. If feeding by the oral route is unsuccessful and if the 
patient is not vomiting, gastric feeding may be tried. (Grade of 
evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.15. If gastric feeding is unsuccessful, jejunal feeding initially 
via a nasojejunal tube may be tried and, if successful, a tube can 
be inserted endoscopically (through a gastrostomy (PEGJ) or 
as a direct jejunostomy) or surgically. A jejunostomy also can 
be useful for drug administration. (Grade of evidence level 5, 
Strength of recommendation strong)
2.16. If jejunal feeding fails (often due to abdominal distension 
or pain as the feed is infused) and if the patient is malnourished, 
then parenteral support may be needed. (Grade of evidence level 
5, Strength of recommendation strong)
2.17. A venting gastrostomy may reduce vomiting but can 
have problems (leakage, not draining, or poor body image). 
(Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong)

before any surgical procedure. A percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy (PEG) or stoma is generally delayed in severely 
malnourished or physiologically unfit patients. (Grade of

3.0 Key terms and definitions used in the guideline
Many terms are used in the literature. Only chronic intestinal 
pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) has been consistently used in the 
past to imply a dilated gut that does not function. Other terms 
such as 'enteric dysmotility' have been used to define the 'grey 
area' sitting between the functional gastrointestinal disorders 
and more severe CIPO. Enteric dysmotility has been primarily 
defined by manometric abnormalities, although histological 
abnormalities can also be found. It lacks the small bowel dilatation seen in CIPO and its current classification status remains 
uncertain.
In the past, different diagnostic labels have been given to 
patients based on the diagnostic test used. Unfortunately they 
are given to patients according to which diagnostic test is used. 
Currently they have not been merged to point to a specific diagnosis, which can be best given by histology. The histology may 
show abnormalities, but the extent they are due to malnutrition, previous surgery (including defunctioning bowel) or drug 
therapy is not completely clear.
Phrases that may be found on investigations
Radiology
► slow transit
► dilated bowel
► no transitional zone
Scintigraphy
► slow transit (gastric emptying, small bowel or colon) of 
liquid/solid
Manometry
► propulsive failure
► giant contractions
► no migrating motor complexes (MMCs)
Pathological
► neuropathy
► plexitis, leiomyositis
► myopathy
In this document the term 'intestinal dysmotility' is used to 
cover all conditions in which there is a failure to propel the 
luminal contents without there being an organic obstructing 
lesion. The intestinal dysmotility is considered severe when 
nutritional or fluid support is needed due to objective evidence 
of malnutrition, dehydration or electrolyte disturbance.
This guideline relates to adults and does not cover acute 
pseudo-obstruction (eg, ileus).
4.0 Introduction
Chronic small intestinal dysmotility occurs when there is a failure 
of coordinated intestinal propulsion, giving rise to the symptoms and signs of intestinal obstruction (colicky abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting usually with abdominal distension, and often a 
dilated bowel) in the absence of a mechanical cause.4 5 A frank 
obstructive picture with distended bowel is not always the case, 
especially if there is a neurological aetiology. For the purpose 
of this article, chronic will be taken as more than 6 months of 
symptoms. Chronic intestinal dysmotility may be defined as 
severe when there is associated malnutrition (BMI of less than 
18.5kg/m2
 or more than 10% unintentional weight loss in last 
3 months) and thus specific treatments which may include clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH, formerly referred 
to as artificial nutritional support) may be needed.
Normal gastrointestinal motility is determined by intestinal 
smooth muscle function which in turn is influenced by neural 
and humoral factors. A disorder of one or more of these systems 
can result in intestinal pseudo-obstruction.4
 There are many 
causes of acute or reversible/temporary intestinal dysmotility 
which include abdominal surgery, trauma, sepsis, metabolic (eg, 
hypokalaemia) or endocrine problems (eg, hypothyroidism), but 
they will not be discussed in this document as they do not usually 
result in long-term malnutrition. Dysmotility may occur in the 
small bowel and also in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract 
(eg, oesophagus, stomach and colon) and their involvement may 
complicate diagnostic tests and treatments. The primary problems with isolated oesophageal, gastric or colonic motility are 
not specifically discussed. Other medical causes of abdominal 
pain (eg, familial Mediterranean fever, angio-oedema, abdominal migraine and lead poisoning) are not specifically discussed 
but the clinician must be aware of them.
The diagnosis of these patients can be very difficult and may be 
empirical, especially when, as is most common, there is no definite histological confirmation of a disease process. The clinical 
features, results of investigations (eg, manometry) and histology 
may not all combine to indicate one specific diagnosis. Other 
factors that can give rise to the clinical picture or aggravate the 
condition are: unrecognised organic small bowel obstruction/the 
effects of previous abdominal surgery (including adhesions and 
neuropathic pain), drug usage (particularly opioids and drugs 
with anticholinergic effects), psychosocial problems including 
abnormal illness behaviour and malnutrition. In practice, all of 
these often play a part and contribute to the patient’s presentation. Untangling which of these factors gives rise to the dominant symptom can be challenging and needs the help of a MDT 
consisting of a gastroenterologist, gastrointestinal physiologist, 
gastrointestinal surgeon, pain team, psychiatrist/psychologist, 
rheumatologist (including a specialist in fatigue management),

If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, this should be clearly 
documented and the diagnosis only described as working (probably or possible) and the contributing factors to this should be 
stated on the patient’s problem list (eg, previous surgery, opioid 
or cyclizine use, psychosocial problems or undernutrition). A 
definitive diagnosis should only be given if there is a clear cause 
identified. It is very difficult to remove a diagnostic label once it 
has been given, and a premature or erroneous organic diagnosis 
in those with predominantly psychosocial issues or abnormal 
illness behaviour may make the management of contributing 
issues very difficult. A definite diagnosis, although satisfying 
to have, rarely affects the patient’s clinical management from a 
medical perspective.
This document discusses the differential diagnoses, the medical 
and nutritional treatment of chronic small intestinal dysmotility 
(myopathy and neuropathy) which result in malnutrition. In its 
most severe form, patients with small bowel dysmotility may 
need long-term PN or even a small intestinal transplant, while in 
a milder form dietary adjustments may suffice.
5.0 Conditions that mimic or can contribute to the 
presentation
A patient with suspected small bowel dysmotility will have 
had basal investigations to exclude other causes; these include 
inflammatory markers (CRP, albumin, platelets and faecal 
calprotectin) which, if normal, make active inflammatory bowel 
disease unlikely. These may be followed, as appropriate, with the 
use of endoscopies and cross-sectional imaging including with 
intravenous contrast to diagnose structural/mucosal diseases. 
Several other conditions may appear as severe chronic intestinal 
dysmotility but with no primary bowel pathology (figure 1). In 
one series the most frequent misdiagnoses for dysmotility were 
volvulus, megacolon and chronic constipation.6
5.1 Organic obstruction
A major problem, that is often not diagnosed, is a localised 
bowel obstruction as a result of adhesion formation. This may be 
suspected clinically when a patient has had a number of abdominal operations (with or without extensive adhesion division).7
A history of intermittent colicky abdominal pain with abdominal distension, loud bowel sounds, no bowel or stoma action 
and vomiting suggest this. A distal obstruction is suggested if the 
vomit is faeculent, while a more proximal one by green/yellow 
vomit. During an obstructive episode the bowel secretes more 
fluid, and when the obstruction resolves, diarrhoea follows (or 
a high stomal output). If a patient sticks to a low residue diet 
or even a liquid diet, the obstructive episodes may reduce or 
even be abolished. This approach, if successful, can be a useful 
supportive diagnostic test.
Radiologically, the clue to an organic obstruction is the 
demonstration of a distinct transition point between dilated and 
normal sized bowel, but this may not be apparent either because 
the obstruction has resolved or the bowel is fixed by adhesions 
and thus cannot dilate. It can be helpful to obtain an abdominal CT scan when the patient has an episode of severe pain. 
Contrast follow through studies or MRI scans, although useful 
when positive, may not be tolerated in the acute setting and do 
not always demonstrate the obstruction. Unsuspected diagnoses 
may be revealed (eg, small bowel volvulus from a band adhesion 
or an intussusception). Further clues to an organic obstruction 
are visible small bowel peristalsis, worse pain after prokinetic 
drugs or giant jejunal contractions on manometry.8 9
Multiple laparotomies themselves may result in secondary 
dysmotility, especially if the bowel becomes encased in fibrous 
tissue as can occur with sclerosing peritonitis. In addition, 
upper gut surgery (eg, a vagotomy, Whipple’s resection, gastroenterostomy, bariatric procedures or any bowel anastomosis) can 
result in secondary small bowel dysmotility.10
Radiation damage can cause strictures and a localised obstruction and/or a generalised secondary dysmotility. Problems caused 
by radiation damage tend to be progressive over many years.
5.2 Opioid and other drug effects on the bowel
Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can result from both opioid 
withdrawal and chronic opioid usage and manifests with features 
of dysmotility (especially constipation) when pain is not the 
dominant issue. The narcotic bowel syndrome may result from 
chronic usage and is defined as chronic, worsening or frequently 
occurring abdominal pain despite continued or escalating doses 
of narcotics in addition to dysmotility.11 The opioid usage 
induces a hyperalgesic effect. It may be becoming more prevalent but it is often not recognised by clinicians.12 13 In addition 
to being acknowledged to occur in patients with gastrointestinal 
disease (functional or organic), it also occurs in patients with 
no pre-existing gastrointestinal problems who take high doses 
of the opioids for other painful conditions (eg, joint problems or 
following surgery).
The components of therapy for narcotic bowel syndrome are 
recognition of the disorder, a trusting therapeutic relationship 
with the patient, replacement using neuropathic type pain drugs 
and controlled reduction in the opioid dose.14 Specific drug 
treatments have been tried for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and narcotic bowel syndrome and include clonidine (to 
reduce withdrawal symptoms) and peripheral mu opioid antagonists (naloxone, methylnaltrexone, alvimopan).15–17
Opioids inhibit intestinal motility and so invalidate the tests 
of small bowel motility. They may also increase the risk of line 
infections in patients on long-term PN.
Survivors of cancer treatment may have bowel dysmotility 
which may be due to chemotherapy or opioid medication. Their 
management may require a wider MDT input.
Cyclizine is both an antihistamine and anticholinergic drug 
which acts as a centrally acting anti-emetic. There are many 
reports of it being taken for its euphoric effect, which is most 
marked when taken intravenously. In addition to causing addictive behaviour, it is of a low pH and so damages veins. It is not 
recommended for long-term use, especially in patients receiving 
PN.18

Guidelines
Box 1 Contributing psychological factors
► Delay in diagnosis
► Poor knowledge within the medical community
► No cure
► Pain and problems of analgesic drugs (including addiction)
► Anxiety, depression, somatisation, poor coping, sickness role
► Interaction with family, carers and job leading to low 
self-esteem/confidence/mood
chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, vincristine) may also cause reduced 
gut propulsion.
5.3 Functional gastrointestinal disorders
Many of the symptoms of small intestinal dysmotility are the 
same as for patients with other functional abdominal gastrointestinal disorders (eg, irritable bowel syndrome, functional 
dyspepsia, cyclical vomiting, functional bloating/distension, 
functional constipation/diarrhoea and centrally mediated disorders of gastrointestinal pain).19
The differentiation and overlap with these functional gastrointestinal disorders is difficult. They all may have genetic and 
psychosocial influences (early life trauma, life stresses, coping 
mechanisms, lack of social support, etc). In addition, bacterial 
flora, inflammation, visceral sensation and motility may all 
contribute to the symptoms. In irritable bowel syndrome there 
may be an overlap with enteric neuropathy as increased lymphocytes have been observed in the jejunal myenteric plexus.20
However, significant malnutrition is rarely a consequence of 
these disorders.
The treatment—as for all dysmotility problems—is to identify 
and treat the main symptom. If weight loss has occurred, then 
the same therapies as for intestinal dysmotility may be tried at 
the same time as nutritional support is given. Significant caution 
should be exercised, however, to avoid escalating to more 
invasive forms of nutrition support in patients with functional 
symptoms, especially in pain predominant presentations, in the 
absence of objective features of biochemical disturbance or those 
who have a high or normal BMI. Such escalation of invasive 
intervention in these patients is subject to risks of iatrogenesis, 
and in clinical practice experience does not appear to improve 
global function, quality of life or symptoms.
5.4 Psychological/psychiatric problems
5.4.1 Anorexia nervosa
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) stated in 2013 that to 
diagnose a person with anorexia nervosa they must display: (1) 
persistent restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low 
body weight (in context of what is minimally expected for age, 
sex, developmental trajectory and physical health); (2) either an 
intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent 
behaviour that interferes with weight gain (even though significantly low weight); (3) disturbance in the way one's body weight 
or shape is experienced, undue influence of body shape and 
weight on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the
seriousness of the current low body weight.21
However, the patients that present to gastroenterologists often 
do not have this typical presentation. Delayed gastric emptying, 
especially of solid, and delayed small and large bowel transit 
have been described in patients with anorexia nervosa.22–25
There is a report of a patient having a mega-duodenum and no 
propagating MMCs which both improved with an increased 
nutritional intake.26
5.4.2 Avoidant/restrictive eating
Some patients who have had psychosocial problems in the past 
may have disordered gut motility partly due to a disordered 
eating pattern, undernutrition and the drug treatments which 
they received.27
5.4.3 Psychiatric disorders and psychological distress
Other major psychiatric disorders can be encountered, sometimes masquerading as or confounding a dysmotility diagnosis.28
It is not uncommon for some of these patients to be referred to 
an IF unit. Psychological distress is common (box 1) and so an 
MDT approach including both clinical psychology and liaison 
psychiatry expertise is ideal (see also section 9.6).
5.5 Effect of undernutrition on gut function
Malnutrition itself can impair gut function and cause malabsorption with mucosal atrophy, reduced gastric acid and pancreatic 
enzyme secretion and more bacterial colonisation of the upper 
gut.29 30 The effects of undernutrition on gut motility and histological appearance are uncertain.
There is literature on the superior mesenteric artery syndrome 
(Wilkie's syndrome) in which the third part of the duodenum 
is compressed between the superior mesenteric artery and the 
aorta (when the left renal vein is compressed it is referred to as 
‘nutcracker syndrome’). It is reported to be prevalent in patients 
who have suddenly lost weight and reported to improve when 
either the patient becomes better nourished or a duodenojejunostomy (bypass) is formed to avoid the obstruction. The 
symptoms attributed to this are postprandial epigastric pain, 
nausea/vomiting and loss of weight.31–35 Whether this is a cause 
or consequence of malnutrition and whether it is a radiological 
rather than true clinical entity remains contentious and some 
clinicians dispute its existence and think it is over diagnosed. 
Thus the risks of any surgery should be very carefully considered, especially as the benefits of surgery are not always predictable or clear.
5.6 Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) (joint 
hypermobility syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome 
hypermobility type)
Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) with its gastrointestinal associations is difficult to classify as most patients 
with EDS do not have a dysmotility of the small bowel, merely 
visceral hypersensitivity. Its symptoms may mimic dysmotility 
(neuropathy) and the presence of EDS can contribute to dysmotility, usually if postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) or other 
associated factors such as opiates are present. According to the 
2017 classification, patients previously diagnosed with joint 
hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type were reclassified as hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos 
syndrome (hEDS) if they met the strict criteria or Hypermobile 
Spectrum Disorders (HSD) if they had many but not all of the 
characteristics of hEDS.36 Patients with hEDS and HSD represent a third of patients referred to a tertiary neurogastroenterology clinic and these patients tend to be young, female with a 
poorer quality of life.37 hEDS/HSD is associated with a range 
of gut disorders (acid reflux, abdominal pain (especially typical 
is pain after eating or when any food arrives in the gut even 
from an enteral feed) and constipation).38 There is often autonomic dysregulation, particularly PoTs,37 chronic urinary retention due to a failure of the urethral sphincter to relax (Fowler’s

is being increasingly reported (most commonly in those having 
PoTs). An increasing number of patients with joint hypermobility and gut dysmotility are being seen by nutrition support 
teams because of weight loss and malnutrition. This group seems 
especially sensitive to opioids and cyclizine, both of which can 
exacerbate all of their symptoms.18 It is currently unclear the 
degree to which the association of hEDS with gut symptoms 
encompasses specifically any greater degree of chronic small 
intestinal dysmotility, or whether there are any different treatment approaches to patients without hEDS who have the same 
functional symptoms. The same cautions therefore should apply 
when considering escalating invasiveness of nutrition support in 
this group as to that of functional gastrointestinal disorders in 
general, especially if there is a pain predominant presentation.
6.0 Classification of chronic small intestinal 
dysmotility
Three major histopathological entities are recognised: myopathies, neuropathies and mesenchymopathies, depending respectively on the predominant involvement of smooth muscle cells, 
enteric neurons or the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Mesenchymopathies, which involve ICC, which are the gut pacemakers, 
are being recognised. The abnormalities described include a 
decreased ICC density, loss of processes and damaged intracellular cytoskeleton and organelles as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis and electron microscopy. It may be that 
abnormalities with the ICC are the primary event or may result 
from a neuropathy. In babies, immaturity may result in a delay in 
maturation of ICCs that can lead to the appearance of a reduction in these cells, so care needs to be taken with the histological 
diagnosis. As conditions specifically falling into this category are 
few, this document will only discuss conditions traditionally classified as a myopathy or neuropathy (figure 2, box 2).
It can be hard to determine if a condition is primarily a myopathy or neuropathy as some secondary conditions (eg, systemic 
sclerosis, vasculitis or amyloid) may appear as both. The end 
result of a neuropathy is often dysfunctional enteric muscle 
which occasionally can dilate, as in a myopathy. Overall, a 
neuropathy is more common than a myopathy in causing small 
bowel dysmotility but the reverse may be true in CIPO. The 
diagnosis can be difficult to define partly because the radiological, isotopic, manometric and histological diagnoses may be 
different.
6.1 Myopathies
Primary myopathies most commonly occur in children and young 
adults and are often familial (genetic). Myopathies often have 
multivisceral involvement and thus a relatively high mortality. 
They are characteristically associated with massive gut dilatation. 
Many predominantly affect the circular muscle (except hollow 
visceral myopathy). Primary myopathies are more common in 
children whereas secondary myopathies are more common in 
adults. Some causes will remain idiopathic.
6.1.1 Primary myopathies
Primary myopathies are due to abnormalities in enteric muscle 
(eg, hollow visceral myopathy or autoimmune myopathy). There 
has been interest in reduced immunostaining of alpha-isoactin in 
jejunal circular muscle, observed in one40 then 28 more patients 
(overall 24% of patients having full thickness jejunal biopsies).41
However, it is not clear if this is the primary pathology or 
secondary to other factors (eg, drugs, undernutrition or previous 
surgery) or a normal anatomical variant, and therefore not a 
specific finding.42 Precise information as to the location of the 
biopsy (jejunum or ileum) is essential for interpretation in this 
context.
Familial
Hollow visceral myopathy is the best known example of a familial 
visceral myopathy. It is a rare congenital disorder that usually 
presents in the first or second decade of life and, in addition 
to gross dilatation of the gastrointestinal tract (that often starts 
with a megaduodenum), there may also be associated dilatation 
of the urinary tract and associated frequent urinary tract infections.43–45 The disease has been reported to follow an autosomal 
dominant mode of inheritance.46 47 In infants other features may 
include malrotation, pyloric stenosis and bladder atony. There is 
a loss of enteric smooth muscle with vacuolar degeneration and 
fibrosis.48 The longitudinal muscle is predominantly affected. 
This may be due to the transformation of smooth muscle cells 
to collagen synthesising myofibroblasts.49 In one study of adult 
patients, four of six patients had urinary tract involvement with 
dilatation of the ureters and/or incomplete bladder emptying.43
Acquired: autoimmune myopathy
A few cases only of a lymphocytic enteric leiomyositis involving 
the smooth muscle cells have been reported.50–52 Eosinophilic 
leiomyositis has also been reported, and in this context must 
prompt investigation for parasites, including dog hookworm.
Jejunal diverticulosis
Diverticula in the jejunum usually result from congenital abnormalities or dysmotility (eg, disordered high pressure bowel 
contractions) and may be associated with subclinical systemic 
sclerosis. Careful examination of any resected specimen should 
be carried out to examine the muscle and nerve layers of the 
bowel wall, both in the region of the diverticula and adjacent 
bowel.
6.1.2 Secondary myopathies
Secondary myopathies occur as part of a multi-system disease 
(eg, systemic sclerosis, amyloid, chronic irradiation damage or 
muscular diseases).53 The problems of pseudo-obstruction are 
often only clinically apparent towards the end of the illness 
when nutritional support may be needed.

*Histology is generally inflammatory or degenerative.
Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and other connective tissue 
disorders
Most patients with systemic sclerosis do get gastrointestinal 
involvement particularly of the oesophagus.54 While the end 
result and main pathology is smooth muscle atrophy and gut 
wall fibrosis,55 it may start with microvasculature damage due to 
collagen deposits and inflammation which cause neural damage 
that progresses to muscle dysfunction and fibrosis. While 
systemic sclerosis patients with gross gastrointestinal involvement present in the terminal phase of the illness, this is not 
always the case and some present with gastrointestinal involvement early in the disease without cutaneous involvement and the 
disease may not progress for many years. The clinical outcome 
in elderly scleroderma patients is the poorest of all adult onset 
dysmotility patients.56 However, where indicated, long-term PN 
can offer a safe and effective means of nutritional support in 
patients with severe small bowel involvement.57 Other connective tissue and rheumatological disorders have been associated 
with dysmotility including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Still's disease.58 59
Amyloidosis
The primary type distribution may be associated with gut involvement. The most common underlying diagnosis is myeloma (often 
producing lambda chains). While classified as a myopathy, it can 
also cause neurological damage and, like systemic sclerosis, may 
cause both a myopathy and a neuropathy. The rectum can be 
spared so duodenal sampling should also be considered. Any full 
thickness biopsy for motility investigation should also be examined for amyloidosis. Genetic testing is now readily available 
for the hereditary type of amyloidosis, which may present more 
commonly in men and with peripheral neuropathy and cardiac 
as well as gut involvement.
Chronic irradiation damage
This usually occurs after pelvic irradiation for gynaecological 
cancers or genitourinary cancers. The sigmoid and terminal ileal 
areas are often most involved. However, the whole small bowel 
can be involved giving rise to a pseudo-obstruction picture or as 
discrete areas of strictures. Surgery is very difficult and has a high 
risk of an enterocutaneous fistula(s) being created. Gut permeability, secretion, motility and blood supply can all be affected, 
giving rise to any or all of the following: malabsorption, protein 
losing enteropathy, diarrhoea, perforation/fistulas, bleeding and 
obstruction. These problems can all occur months or years after 
more than 45Gy irradiation has been given. The irradiation is 
more likely to give problems if a patient is already malnourished, 
has diabetes mellitus, hypertension or a vasculitis.60
Muscular diseases
Myopathies may occur associated with congenital muscular 
disorders (muscular dystrophies, myofibrillar myopathies (eg, 
desmin myopathy), hereditary inclusion body myopathies), but 
the muscle weakness (and often cardiac problems) dominates 
the clinical picture although gastrointestinal problems if sought 
are common. Metabolic storage disorders can have a myopathic 
process and occasionally can be treated with specific enzyme 
replacement therapy.61
6.2 Neuropathies
An enteric neuropathy may occur as a primary pathology (congenital, autoimmune or infective), secondary to a generalised neurological disorder, paraneoplastic process, metabolic disorder (eg,

diabetes) or drugs/toxins or as a developmental abnormality. 
Visceral neuropathy is less well reported in the literature than 
visceral myopathy. Visceral neuropathy is commonly acquired in 
adulthood or in old age and is associated with a high morbidity 
usually due to factors other than the neuropathy. Luminal dilatation is rarely seen except at the end stage of the disease.
Two forms of pathology are found—either enteric neural 
degeneration (in the absence of inflammation) or inflammatory.
62 Degenerative neuropathies can result from mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathological findings include neuronal 
swelling, intranuclear inclusions, axonal degeneration and 
hypoganglionosis. The aetiology of many degenerative enteric 
neuropathies will remain idiopathic. Inflammatory neuropathies 
may include both plexitis and neuritis and can be lymphocytic or 
less commonly eosinophilic, the former promoting autoimmune 
screening, the latter investigation for parasites.
6.2.1 Primary neuropathy
The enteric neuropathies can affect both the submucosal and 
myenteric plexuses but the myenteric plexus is predominantly 
affected. The term 'visceral neuropathy' is used for primary 
intrinsic enteric nervous damage.
Congenital/familial/developmental
Familial visceral neuropathies include Hirschprung’s disease, 
mitochondrial cytopathies and Von Recklinghausen’s disease. 
Hirschprung’s disease can affect any part of the gut.
Mitochondrial disorders are relatively common if specifically 
sought. One study showed 19% of 80 adult patients labelled as 
CIPO to have this.63 Mitochondrial cytopathies such as mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) 
(the most common) (also referred to as thymidine phosphorylase deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised 
by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility (including bacterial overgrowth and lactic acidosis), cachexia and neurological problems 
including leukoencephalopathy (96%), polyneuropathy (96%), 
ophthalmoplegia (91%) (with ptosis) and hearing loss (55%).64 65
The disease is caused by mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene. Gastrointestinal dysmotility is the most prominent manifestation, with recurrent diarrhoea and symptoms 
of obstruction. Patients with MNGIE present between the first 
and third decade (mean age 18 years)66 and usually have a very 
reduced life expectancy and tend to die in early adulthood (mean 
37.6 years; range 26–58 years). It, like all mitochondrial defects, 
can be tested for by plasma and urine thymidine deoxyuridine, 
white cell thymine phosphorylase, the Tymp gene, MR brain 
scanning and muscle biopsy.
Autoimmune
Auto-antibodies directed at enteric neurons, usually neuronal 
ion channels (eg, voltage-gated potassium channels) can occur as 
a paraneoplastic phenomenon, when the anti-neuronal nuclear 
antibody (ANNA-1 or anti-Hu) is most commonly found, and 
antineuronal antibodies can occur in non-paraneoplastic motility 
disorders.67–69 Other auto-antibodies associated with dysmotility 
include acetyl cholinesterase receptor antibody (AchR) (ganglionic, nicotinic and M3 type), antibodies against the voltage-gated 
potassium channel-complex (VGKC-complex), voltage-gated 
calcium channel antibodies (VGCC), smooth muscle and 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).59 The pathogenetic 
role of auto-antibodies is, however, currently unclear. Coeliac 
disease has also been implicated in some cases of dysmotility.
Infective
Both herpes (Epstein–Barr virus and cytomegalovirus)70 and 
polyoma viruses (John Cunningham (JC) virus)71 72 have had 
their DNA isolated in the myenteric plexuses of some patients 
with visceral neuropathy. They may be causative agents rather 
than innocent bystanders but this has yet to be proven. Chagas’ 
disease (South American trypanosomiasis) typically causes a 
megaesophagus and megacolon. Chagas’ enteropathy is common 
and gives rise to dyspepsia, intestinal pseudo-obstruction with 
bacterial overgrowth.73 Lyme disease and botulism have also 
been reported as reversible causes of dysmotility.
6.2.2 Secondary neuropathy
The neuropathic process may affect the nerves external (extrinsic 
neuropathy) to the gut and so indirectly affect gut motility or 
may be part of a generalised illness. Indeed, most cases of visceral 
neuropathy are part of a generalised neurological disorder rather 
than a primary neuronal disorder of the gastrointestinal tract
Generalised neurological disorders
Disorders of the parasympathetic or sympathetic nerves that 
innervate the gut (including autonomic system degeneration and 
the neurological effects of diabetes mellitus (most common) and 
other endocrine or metabolic disorders) can indirectly cause gut 
dysmotility. Brainstem lesions, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease (basal ganglia calcification) and leukoencephalopathy can all affect gut motility.74 75 A lymphocytic 
leiomyositis and myenteric ganglionitis have been described in 
the ileum of children with cystic fibrosis and distal ileal obstruction.76 Myotonic dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s 
disease and porphyria may all be associated with an enteric 
neuropathy.
Paraneoplastic
Small cell lung cancer, carcinoid tumours, neuroblastoma and 
thymoma with anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies have all been 
described to cause an enteral neuropathy. There is often a dense 
inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells affecting 
both plexuses but mainly the myenteric (myenteric ganglionitis). Anti-Hu neuronal antibody is characteristic.77 Removal 
of a thymoma may result in resolution of the dysmotility and 
the patient gaining weight. CRMP 5 (CV2) and AchR autoantibodies have also been associated with paraneoplastic dysmotility and should prompt a careful search for occult malignancy.59
Drugs/toxins
Vincristine is directly neurotoxic and causes a visceral neuropathy. Anticholinergics (eg, phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants) have been associated with severe dysmotility. A case 
series of 102 life-threatening episodes of clozapine-induced 
gastrointestinal dysmotility episodes were collated with some 
evidence for dose dependence. A number of other drugs have 
been associated with severe dysmotility which, in most cases, 
improves with stopping the drug or reducing the dose; these 
include baclofen, buserelin, clonidine, fludaribine, phenytoin 
and verapamil. Lead poisoning can be a rare reversible cause.59
6.3 Idiopathic
In the majority of patients and in most centres, the precise aetiology of chronic severe dysmotility is not characterised histopathologically and remains based on the clinical presentation, 
physiological testing and exclusion of obstructive and mucosal 
disease. This in part reflects a low uptake of full thickness

patients with dysmotility, high rates of full thickness biopsies 
were associated with high rates of neuromuscular abnormalities of which two-thirds were primary and one-third were 
secondary causes, although not all biopsies yielded a diagnosis. 
The threshold and acceptability of full thickness biopsy testing, 
especially as most will not lead to a change in management, 
has not currently achieved consensus. There also remain some 
unresolved issues for gastrointestinal neuromuscular pathology 
standardisation and interpretation.59 For the near future, therefore, it is likely that the aetiology in the majority of dysmotility 
patients will remain idiopathic.
7.0 Physiological consequences of severe small 
intestinal dysmotility
7.1 Impairment of coordinated gut contractions and the 
migrating myoelectric complex (MMC)
If the MMC is impaired, then the small bowel will not be cleared 
of debris predisposing to gut stasis and bacterial overgrowth. 
With enteric neuropathies, gut coordination is disrupted and the 
presence of chyme in the small bowel can cause severe painful 
non-propulsive large contractions. This is one of the causes of 
abdominal pain shortly after eating.
7.2 Gut stasis
The failure of forward propulsion may also cause constipation 
and this is often the first symptom. Gut stasis results in abdominal distension and, if much fluid accumulates (oral intake and 
normal gut secretions), it may produce a large volume vomit. 
The vomit may be faeculent and contain food debris from several 
days previously.
7.3 Bacterial overgrowth and malabsorption
The combination of a dilated gut with reduced propulsion and 
ineffective MMC allows anaerobic bacteria to proliferate in stagnant loops of bowel. This bacterial overgrowth results in bile 
salts being deconjugated, less effective secondary bile acids (eg, 
lithocolic acid) being made and pancreatic enzyme degradation 
occurs so that steatorrhoea and malnutrition may occur. Associated with steatorrhoea is malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins A and E (less so D and rarely K) with deficiency symptoms 
(night blindness, poor colour vision, dry flaky skin and ataxia). 
Vitamin B12 may be malabsorbed but both folic acid and vitamin 
K can be manufactured by the bacteria and so may give rise to 
high serum levels.
Occasionally the bacteria can manufacture D-lactic acid 
(normally L-isomer) giving rise to D-lactic acidosis (high anion 
gap acidosis) and other bacteria can manufacture ammonia 
which may appear in high levels in the blood.
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is when excess 
micro-organisms are present in the small intestine and lead to 
a malabsorption syndrome with occasionally a protein losing 
enteropathy. Subtotal villous atrophy may be found on histology. 
There are several endogenous mechanisms for preventing bacterial overgrowth: gastric acid secretion, intestinal motility, intact 
ileo-caecal valve, intestinal immunoglobulin secretion and bacteriostatic properties of pancreatic and biliary secretions. The aetiology of SIBO is usually complex, associated with disorders of 
these mechanisms. In some patients more than one factor may 
be involved.
There is currently no gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO 
and the commonly available methodologies (the culture of 
jejunal aspirates and a variety of breath tests) are limited by large 
variations in their performance and interpretation.78
7.4 Problems of undernutrition
Patients who rapidly lose more than 10% of their body weight 
frequently have demonstrable physiological changes which 
include skeletal and cardiac muscle weakness, poor concentration and mental function including memory, prolonged sleeping, 
reduced sexual function, a low body temperature and a propensity to develop infections which are potentially severe.79 In the 
gut, malabsorption with mucosal atrophy, reduced gastric acid 
and pancreatic enzyme secretion and more bacterial colonisation of the upper gut can occur although the experimental 
backing for this is inferred from studies in patients with anorexia 
nervosa.22–26
8.0 Clinical features of chronic small intestinal 
dysmotility and management plan
8.1 History, examination and blood tests
The features of patients with a myopathy are summarised in 
table 1. The clinical history and examination should determine 
if there are associated systemic neuromuscular, connective tissue 
or endocrine diseases (muscular diseases, neurological disease, 
storage diseases, systemic sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, irradiation, 
etc) and thus if the myopathy or neuropathy is a primary or 
secondary disorder. Exploring the family history will detect some 
congenital diseases, as will asking about foreign travel (Chagas' 
disease). Examination especially includes the neuromuscular 
system and testing for joint hypermobility. Autonomic neuropathy should be considered if orthostatic, pupillary or sudomotor 
(sweating) dysfunction accompanies dysmotility. Simple clinical 
bedside assessment of orthostatic pulse rate change (lying to 
standing) may identify PoTs (box 3).52
Symptoms need to be listed in order of importance to the 
patient, and a record made of all the drugs currently taken or 
that have been taken for long periods (especially opioids and 
cyclizine).
A basic nutritional assessment will include measuring the 
patient’s height and weight and asking their usual weight in 
health and their weight change over the last 2 weeks, 3 and 6 
months. From these their BMI and percentage weight loss can

concentration greater than 3 µmol/L and a plasma deoxyuridine 
concentration greater than 5 µmol/L. Thymidine phosphorylase enzyme activity in leukocytes will be less than 10% of the 
control mean. Molecular genetic testing of TYMP, the gene 
encoding thymidine phosphorylase, detects mutations in affected 
individuals.
Rectal examination with an unprepared sigmoidoscopy will 
identify stool consistency and colour and permit biopsy for 
amyloid. Steatorrhoea will be detected and constipation/diarrhoea confirmed. Basic tests of autonomic function include lying 
and standing systolic blood pressure and heart rate with ECG 
confirmation.
8.1.1 Myopathy
Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, abdominal distension and bloating, early satiety, recurrent nausea and vomiting 
and alternating diarrhoea and constipation. Without treatment, 
weight loss and protein-energy malnutrition may ensue.79 The 
frequency of symptoms for those with a probable myopathy is 
shown in table 1.
41 The vomiting may be faeculent and often of 
high volume giving rise to a risk of pulmonary aspiration.
In hollow visceral myopathy (HVM), in addition to the 
features above, patients have a very dilated small bowel. They 
may have urological complaints including bladder-emptying 
dysfunction.43–45 Children with HVM may present at or before 
birth with hydronephrosis, megaureters and megacystis, or in 
the first year of life with constipation and episodes of intestinal 
pseudo-obstruction.43 44 The presence of digital arches on fingerprint, mitral valve prolapse, joint laxity and constipation before 
age 10 years all favour the diagnosis.74 HVM may present at any 
age, but early adulthood is most common.46 47
Signs of autoimmune disease (arthropathy, Raynaud's disease 
or proteinuria) may suggest a secondary myopathy, or the 
pseudo-obstructive syndrome associated with scleroderma may 
be declared by the cutaneous manifestations of this disease.
8.1.2 Neuropathy
Many of the features are the same as for a myopathy, particularly with severe abdominal pain after food; however, abdominal 
distension is often absent and the plain abdominal radiograph 
may appear normal.80
8.2 Radiological tests
The diagnosis is usually first suspected after plain abdominal 
radiographs have shown a dilated small and large bowel. Once 
suspected, investigations aim to confirm that there is impaired 
transit of luminal contents, to identify the region of the bowel 
affected, ideally to identify the propulsive abnormality and to 
show a specific pathology.6
 Investigations help establish the 
presence of intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may delineate an 
underlying cause. In practice the diagnosis is often presumed 
after several laparotomies have excluded a physical obstruction, although CT/barium follow-through/MR enterography

excluding a transition point in a diffusely distended small bowel 
suggests CIPO and may prevent unnecessary laparotomy. CT 
may also help distinguish severe dysmotility from functional 
bloating due to abdomino-phrenic dysinergia.81 Dynamic MRI 
of the small bowel is becoming increasingly helpful,82 83 though 
is less established. MRI brain can be helpful in the diagnosis of 
MNGIE.59
The measurement of whole gut time can be measured by 
serial X-rays of ingested radio-opaque markers (small lengths of 
barium-impregnated polyvinyl tubing).
Small bowel transit using a barium follow-through examination will usually give some indication of accelerated or delayed 
transit and a dilated duodenal loop (megaduodenum) may be 
one of the earliest signs of visceral myopathy.83 In addition, in 
HVM there may be oesophageal aperistalsis and variable dilatation of the small and large bowel.
8.3 Radioisotopic investigations
Gastric emptying can be measured using gamma scintigraphy to 
obtain serial images of labelled solid (scrambled eggs, liver or 
pancake), semi-solid (thick soup) or liquid (orange juice) meals 
in the stomach. Gastric emptying measurements may be helpful 
in determining whether the stomach is involved in a generalised 
disorder of propulsion or a localised one (eg, Chagas' disease). 
These isotopic meals can be extended to measuring the transit 
of the meal through the small bowel and, if the isotope has a 
long half-life, orocaecal and colonic transit may be determined. 
Liquid meals may not clearly demonstrate an abnormality.
8.4 Endoscopic tests
Jejunal aspirate for bacterial overgrowth is infrequently 
performed but usually by endoscopy (or fluoroscopy with jejunal 
intubation). A clinically significant overgrowth is when counts 
exceed 105
/mL (usual is less than 104/mL). Common species 
include Bacteroides, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. However, 
most of the bacteria likely to be relevant in causing symptoms 
cannot be cultured. Endoscopy also has a role in mucosal 
sampling and palliative venting. Capsule endoscopy examination 
can sometimes give transit information but is rarely used due 
to the risk of the capsule being retained and some regard it as 
contraindicated.
8.5 Non-invasive investigations of gut transit
Orocaecal transit can be measured using the rise in breath 
hydrogen due to the degradation of ingested polysaccharides (eg, 
lactulose). In health this is caused by caecal bacteria fermenting 
the ingested agent, but this is unhelpful if there is propulsive 
failure as small bowel bacterial overgrowth is common and is not 
a recommended test for this application.84 85 It is also unhelpful 
following a significant small bowel resection or if there is an 
enteric fistula.
Breath tests to diagnose bacterial overgrowth may be 
misleading and produce false negative results compared with 
culture of small bowel aspirate.78 86 This has in part been due 
to broad variations in how these tests are performed and interpreted. Recent work in the UK and USA has taken place to 
develop evidence-based consensus guidelines for breath testing 
in terms of dose of substrate (75g glucose, 10g lactulose) and 
cut-off values. In addition, while hydrogen only breath testing 
was previously used, modern testing protocols have incorporated the measurement of methane. Increased intestinal methane 
levels have been associated with delayed small bowel transit as 
measured by scintigraphy and therefore should be measured in 
patients with suspected small bowel dysmotility to improve the 
test's utility.86 Other tests that may indicate bacterial overgrowth 
include raised urinary indicans, blood D-lactate or alcohol levels.
8.6 Manometry
Intraluminal pressure sensors incorporated into a catheter can 
detect the patterns of contractile events. For the diagnosis of 
pseudo-obstruction, the logical investigation is small bowel 
manometry. Small bowel motor activity was initially studied 
using multi-lumen perfused tube systems, with a pump and strain 
gauge transducer external to the patient.87 This gave information on motor activity in the antrum and proximal duodenum, 
and detected abnormal motility88 and some types of pseudoobstruction.89 90 This technique required the patient to remain 
in a laboratory attached to a machine for more than 6hours and 
was not good at recording fasting, and postprandial activity.
91
An alternative is the wireless motility capsule (WMC) which 
is an ambulatory, minimally invasive diagnostic modality that 
allows continuous assessment of intraluminal pH, temperature 
and pressure during its transit through the gastrointestinal tract. 
The technology allows for both measurement of transit times in 
multiple regions of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, 
as well as pressure profiles in the antro-duodenum. The standardised equipment and procedures in WMC allow the comparisons of data across multicentres. The role of the technology 
has been best established in the evaluation of a large number 
of healthy volunteers92 and in patients with suspected gastroparesis and suspected chronic constipation. The worry with 
this technique in these patients is that the capsule may remain 
in the bowel and not be passed. However, a study in patients 
with Crohn’s disease has shown that the same precautions used 
when considering patients for capsule endoscopy (ie, clinical and 
radiological assessment and use of a patency capsule) can mitigate much of the risk in potential WMC patients.93
Twenty-fourhour ambulatory jejunal manometry94 uses a 
catheter with built-in miniature strain gauge transducers95
and records data to a solid-state digital recorder.96 The digital 
encoding of pressure data simplifies the analysis of continuous 
24-hour recordings by computer software.97 98 This technique 
has proved useful in several conditions99 100 including pseudoobstruction. During nocturnal sleep, normal stereotypic MMC 
activity is clearly evident101 and in some patients with pseudoobstruction the abnormal contractile activity of the small bowel 
results in distortion of the fasting MMC pattern. Manometry 
of patients with pseudo-obstruction can be difficult in the 
later stages of disease because the peristaltic activity required 
to propel a manometry catheter into position in the proximal 
jejunum is lacking, and endoscopic assistance may be needed. A 
patient with a neuropathy may have a normal diameter gut but it 
may be hyperactive with many uncoordinated and often strong 
contractions (bursts).90
The effect of any drugs the patient may be taking must be 
taken into account in interpreting any results (eg, opioids, anticholinergics and cyclizine). Manometry does not always produce 
results that are clinically helpful.90
8.7 Pathology and histology
The biochemical examinations recommended are listed in box 4.
Adequate biopsy material is not often available and few 
laboratories have an experienced gastrointestinal neuropathologist. There also remain some additional pitfalls for collecting 
and analysing samples including sampling error, effects of 
bowel handling, sparsity of normal data and specificity. Good

histological samples are needed to make a firm diagnosis. 
Close liaison between the surgeon and pathology laboratory is 
crucial so that a full thickness specimen of bowel is immediately 
processed. The samples should be divided. In an ideal situation 
some is snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and the main portion 
fixed for routine histology and electron microscopy. In practice 
the latter two may be the best option. The immediate processing 
of samples is important if a detailed examination of the nerves, 
ganglia and muscle tissue is to be carried out. Diagnosis of a 
neuropathy may be difficult in conventionally orientated and 
stained sections of gut, and whole mount plexus assessment is 
a research tool. The most important element is to ensure that 
enough sections and material is examined in a centre with experience of dysmotility.
A full thickness jejunal biopsy is usually taken laparoscopically 
and is often helpful diagnostically, but the procedure in centres 
without much experience can be unhelpful and have a significant risk. Published data from centres with expertise suggest a 
median operating time of 50min, conversion rate to open operation 2% and length of stay 1day with an 8% readmission rate 
for obstructive symptoms.102 In myopathies the diagnosis may be 
established. A neuropathy in general shows either degenerative 
changes or inflammation.
All full thickness biopsies should be stained with Congo red 
stains to look for the presence of amyloid. As full thickness 
jejunal biopsies may not change the clinical management and 
are associated with risks, they are often performed when a laparotomy does not find an organic cause of obstruction or when 
the patient happens to be undergoing surgery for another reason 
(eg, a jejunal tube placement).103
MNGIE can be diagnosed with a skeletal muscle biopsy in 
addition to the blood and genetic testing.
9.0 Treatments
The drug treatments for intestinal dysmotility are shown in box 5. 
Most of the drugs are commonly used to treat milder forms of 
the symptoms. Treatment is occasionally directed at the underlying 
condition but more often is targeted at a specific symptom.
9.1 Underlying condition
An underlying disease may need to be treated (eg, connective 
tissue disorder, enteric myositis, neoplastic disease or myotonic 
dystrophy). Diabetic control should be very good and may 
necessitate an insulin pump. Electrolyte, mineral or endocrine 
abnormalities should be prevented and treated when detected.
Immunosuppressive treatment has a small evidence base 
restricted to case series or reports. Prednisolone and ciclosporin 
have been reported to be of particular benefit in autoimmune 
myopathy.104 There is a case report of an improvement with 
initially prednisolone 1mg/kg and azathioprine 2mg/kg/day, then 
subsequently the prednisolone was replaced with budesonide 9mg/
day.
52
There must always be awareness that organic obstruction can 
be missed as a diagnosis and, if a prokinetic drug105 makes pain 
worse, then an organic obstruction must be considered. Similarly, a successful trial of a low fibre or liquid diet suggests an 
organic obstruction.
Some metabolic storage disorders can be treated with specific 
enzyme replacement therapy.61
9.2 Specific drug treatments of symptoms
No treatment is ideal, and even though some help to correct 
physiological abnormalities, they may not affect the patient’s 
symptoms (boxes 3 and 5).
Drug therapy106 can be difficult and often drugs with 
conflicting actions are used (prokinetic for constipation and

anticholinergic for colicky pain). Essentially, the drug therapy 
is targeted at the symptom perceived as most important by the 
patient.
Prokinetic treatments are used to try and improve the dysmotility itself and can return some of the measured abnormalities towards normal. They may especially help with vomiting 
and constipation. Prokinetic drugs are generally not used 
after a bowel anastomosis. Some of the previously used prokinetic drugs have been withdrawn or can only be used with 
extreme caution. They include domperidone and metoclopramide (D2
 dopamine receptor antagonists) which stimulate 
gastric emptying and small intestinal transit, and enhance the 
strength of oesophageal sphincter contraction. Metoclopramide 
also increases the release of acetylcholine from some enteric 
nerves. Domperidone is a selective antagonist of peripheral D2
dopamine receptors, which does not have the acetylcholinelike effect of metoclopramide. National Patient Safety Agency 
(NPSA) alerts have been issued for domperidone highlighting 
problems with prolonged QTc, therefore long-term use should 
be subject to QTc monitoring. The extrapyramidal side effects 
of metoclopramide (especially in children) and the potentially 
irreversible tardive dyskinesia in elderly subjects, together with 
no evidence of consistent benefit in gastroparesis, caused the 
European Medicines Agency’s Committee to recommend that 
metoclopramide is not used in the long term.107 Cisapride, a 
5-HT4
 agonist, enhances acetylcholine release in the myenteric 
plexus without having anti-dopaminergic effects and may have 
been of particular benefit if MMCs were present on small intestinal manometry. In a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial in 26 patients, cisapride helped abdominal pain, improved 
solid gastric emptying and the MMC.105 Unfortunately, due to 
an increased risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias (probably relating 
to a prolonged QT interval) in patients taking other medications 
or suffering from underlying conditions known to increase the 
risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cisapride was withdrawn. Tegaserod, 
a 5-HT4
 receptor partial agonist, increased stool frequency in 
irritable bowel syndrome108 109 and improved the symptoms in 
functional dyspepsia,110 but was withdrawn due to an increased 
risk of heart attacks or strokes.
Prucalopride, a high affinity selective 5HT4
 receptor agonist, 
has been used for constipation and appears not to have the 
cardiac risks of cisapride or tegaserod as it does not affect the QT 
interval. This is by having no significant action on the 5-HT1B/D
and on the cardiac human ether-a-go-go K+ channels.111
Erythromycin, a motilin agonist, is potentially useful112 if 
there are absent or impaired antroduodenal migrating complexes 
but is subject to tachyphylaxis. Doses of 900mg/day have been 
recommended.113 Azithromycin may be more effective for small 
bowel dysmotility.114
A somatostatin analogue (octreotide), given by a relatively 
painful subcutaneous injection, may be dramatically beneficial, 
especially in systemic sclerosis when other treatments have 
failed.115–117 It can improve vomiting and pain, partly because 
octreotide (in normal subjects) reduces the perception of volume 
distension due to inhibition of sensory afferent pathways.115
Octreotide may cause low amplitude MMCs to return.117
Octreotide may have a beneficial effect when erythromycin has 
been unsuccessful; its effect (50–100μg once or twice a day) is 
apparent within 48hours and is maintained for more than 2 years. 
It may be more effective when combined with erythromycin.118
The parasympathomimetics bethanechol, distigmine, neostigmine and pyridostigmine enhance parasympathetic activity in 
the gut and increase intestinal motility. They are rarely used 
because of both their gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side 
effects (diarrhoea and severe bradycardia). Pyridostigmine has, 
however, been shown to help refractory constipation (including 
in diabetes) and was well tolerated using a stepped dosing 
regimen.119 120
Naloxone 1.6mg given subcutaneously each day or methylnaltrexone given subcutaneously on alternate days may be beneficial in blocking dysmotility effects of opioids or in improving 
motility through blocking endogenous opioids.121
9.2.1 Constipation
Constipation may be a problem in early stages, but is rarely 
present when IF occurs. In the early stages of these diseases, 
constipation may be managed by diet ensuring that it includes 
an adequate intake of fibre and fluid. Bulk forming laxatives 
such as unprocessed wheat bran (or oat bran) taken with food 
or fruit juice are effective and methylcellulose (which is also a 
faecal softener), ispaghula, and sterculia are useful in patients 
who cannot tolerate bran.
Osmotic laxatives (macrogols (polyethylene glycol), lactulose 
or magnesium salts) increase the amount of water in the large 
bowel, either by drawing fluid from the body into the bowel 
or by retaining the fluid that was administered. Macrogols are 
inert polymers of ethylene glycol (PEG) which sequester fluid 
in the bowel. Lactulose is a semi-synthetic disaccharide which is 
not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It produces osmotic 
diarrhoea of low pH and prevents the proliferation of ammoniaproducing organisms. Magnesium salts are useful where rapid 
bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts should be avoided as 
they may give rise to sodium and water retention.
If there is an inadequate response to an osmotic laxative, a 
stimulant laxative can be added. Stimulant laxatives increase 
intestinal motility and often cause abdominal cramp; they should 
be avoided in intestinal obstruction. Excessive use of stimulant 
laxatives can cause diarrhoea and hypokalaemia. The anthraquinone laxatives (senna, dantron, cascara) are converted in the 
intestine to active sennosides, which may function by stimulating 
the myenteric plexus in the colon and also by inhibiting colonic 
water absorption. Their principal effect is in the descending and 
sigmoid colon. Their effect is largely local and depends on sufficient intestinal motility to present them to the colon for bacterial degradation to their active form. Sennosides, with prolonged 
use, had been thought to damage the intestine muscle and/or 
myenteric neurons but there is no clinical or animal evidence 
to support this.122 123 Poorly absorbed diphenylmethane derivatives (bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, sodium picosulfate) stimulate 
sensory nerves in the proximal colon and increase sodium and 
water movement into the colonic lumen. Castor oil can have 
a place with its principal effect on small bowel fluid secretion. 
Docusate sodium probably acts both as a stimulant and also as a 
softening agent.
Dantron, cascara and castor oil are rarely used, dantron 
because of potential carcinogenicity.
5HT4
 receptor agonists (prucalopride) are selective serotonin 
5HT4
 receptor agonists with prokinetic properties. Prucalopride is licensed for the treatment of chronic constipation in 
women when other laxatives have failed to provide an adequate 
response. Headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (including 
abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea) are the most frequent 
but rare side effects. The side effects generally occur at the start 
of treatment and are usually transient. It has the potential to be 
a useful prokinetic drug now that cicapride and tegaserod have 
largely been withdrawn. Linaclotide (a 14-amino acid peptide)

Guidelines
so generating cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which 
stimulates chloride secretion, resulting in increased luminal fluid 
secretion and an acceleration of intestinal transit. It also may 
have some visceral analgesic activity.
Methylnaltrexone is a peripherally acting mu-opioid-receptor 
antagonist that is licensed for the treatment of opioid-induced 
constipation in patients receiving palliative care when response 
to other laxatives is inadequate; it should be used as an adjunct 
to existing laxative therapy. Methylnaltrexone does not alter the 
central analgesic effect of opioids. Naloxegol is an oral agent and 
has the same properties.
Faecal softeners (liquid paraffin), the traditional lubricant, 
have potential disadvantages of minimal efficacy (hence usually 
used in combination with other agents) and safety issues (aspiration of paraffin, perianal burning). Bulk laxatives and non-ionic 
surfactant ‘wetting’ agents (docusate sodium) also have softening properties. Enemas containing arachis oil (ground-nut oil, 
peanut oil) lubricate and soften impacted faeces and promote a 
bowel movement. Dioctyl sulfosuccinate, an anionic detergent, 
can be used to break down hard stools.
Stimulant suppositories (glycerol) or enemas (phosphate) may 
also be effective although they are often less acceptable to the 
patient. Glycerol suppositories act as a rectal stimulant by virtue 
of the mildly irritant action of glycerol. Constipation may need 
regular enemas initially using low volume phosphate preparations progressing to high volume saline washouts or transanal 
irrigation systems.
Treatment of faecal impaction may need a manual evacuation 
under anaesthetic if disimpaction does not occur after oral and 
rectal treatment, or if there is a megarectum. The outcome of 
colectomy±ileorectal anastomosis is poor for these patients 
and best avoided. Sometimes a defunctioning loop ileostomy, 
which is reversible, may be performed before considering a total 
colectomy.
9.2.2 Pain
Pain is often poorly correlated with motor events. A simple 
measure such as reducing fibre in the diet can reduce abdominal 
distension by reducing bacterial fermentation and the production of gases. Low FODMAP diets may also have a role, but 
are restrictive in nature and should not be used in an already 
malnourished individual. Peppermint oil may also help.
Antimuscarinics that are used for gastrointestinal smooth 
muscle spasm include the tertiary amine dicycloverine hydrochloride and the quaternary ammonium compounds propantheline bromide and hyoscine butylbromide. The quaternary 
ammonium compounds are less lipid soluble than atropine and 
are less likely to cross the blood–brain barrier; they are also 
less well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Dicycloverine 
hydrochloride has a much less marked antimuscarinic action 
than atropine and may also have some direct action on smooth 
muscle. Hyoscine butylbromide is advocated as a gastrointestinal 
antispasmodic and is commonly tried, but it is poorly absorbed 
so intramuscular preparations may be more effective and can be 
used in the long term at home.124
Direct relaxants of intestinal smooth muscle (alverine citrate, 
mebeverine and peppermint oil) which may relieve pain in irritable bowel syndrome are commonly tried and have no serious 
adverse effects.
Persistent abdominal pain may be a major problem and its mechanism may include central nervous system sensitisation making 
it very difficult to treat. Features of neuropathic pain should be 
sought and managed with neuropathic agents. Opioid-induced 
hyperalgesia as part of the narcotic bowel syndrome can also 
develop and needs appropriate management (see section 5.2). 
If other analgesics prove ineffective, opioids and their derivatives may be tried though they themselves have pro-absorptive/
antisecretory effects and cause slowing of intestinal transit. Some 
opioids, such as tapentadol, may have a better dysmotility side 
effect profile. Targinact (oxycodone and naloxone combined) is 
marketed as a way of giving analgesia without causing constipation. A small amount of naloxone crosses the blood–brain 
barrier to block the dependence action of oxycodone, although 
when first used it may precipitate some withdrawal symptoms 
from the previous opioid-like drug. Naloxegol is a PEGylated 
naloxone formulation not combined with opioid and therefore 
should not cross the blood–brain barrier, owing to the PEGylation, to minimise withdrawal side effects.
Oral liquid preparations may be used but sublingual or 
transdermal buprenorphine or fentanyl have the advantage of 
bypassing the abnormal gut function. It may be of value to give 
a patient a 'pain holiday' in hospital during which sedation and 
continuous subcutaneous opiates, or even epidural anaesthesia, 
may reduce the pain threshold so allowing a reduction in maintenance analgesic dosage. Escalation beyond a low dose of opioid 
is likely to be ineffective in managing chronic pain and is associated with unacceptable risks, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, and should be de-escalated or discontinued if 
the chronic pain persists, even if no other effective pain medication is available.125
There is a growing appreciation for the role in abdominal pain management of the gut-brain neuromodulators, 
frequently used in neuropathic pain management.126 These 
include a tricyclic agent that can be used at sub-antidepressant
doses for abdominal pain or discomfort in patients who have 
not responded to laxatives, loperamide or antispasmodics. Low 
doses of a tricyclic antidepressant are used (eg, amitriptyline, 
initially 5–10 mg each night, increased if necessary in steps of 
10 mg at intervals of at least 2 weeks to maximum 30–50 mg
each night). A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
may be considered in those who do not respond to a tricyclic 
antidepressant, but they are considered to be less effective analgesics than the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
(SNRIs), of which duloxetine is the first choice.126 127 The role 
of gabapentin and pregabalin is well established for chronic 
neuropathic pain, and there is emerging evidence that the use 
of combination gut-brain neuromodulators from more than
one class is more effective than monotherapy.126 127 SNRI and 
SSRI classes, however, should not be combined due to risks of 
serotonin syndrome.
9.2.3 Vomiting
Now that domperidone and metoclopramide are no longer 
used in the long term and as cyclizine can cause psychological 
dependence and addictive behaviour,18 the 5-HT3
 antagonists 
like ondansetron are most commonly used but can result in 
constipation.
If a nasogastric draining tube helps symptoms, then a venting 
gastrostomy (ideally over 20 French gauge (FG)) usually inserted 
endoscopically (though it may also be done radiologically or 
surgically) may reduce vomiting by decompressing the stomach. 
The difficulty is having a large enough gastrostomy tube to allow 
all debris from the stomach to drain. Sometimes a tube can be 
inserted into the small bowel if very dilated to decompress it. 
These venting ostomies are often successful but are associated 
with many complications such as leakage and infection (often

with candida) and generally need to be changed more regularly 
than a feeding ostomy.
9.2.4 Diarrhoea: bacterial overgrowth and bile salt malabsorption
Antidiarrhoeal drugs such as loperamide, diphenoxylate or, rarely, 
codeine phosphate are very occasionally used for symptomatic 
benefit. Opioids with a central action, such as codeine, are not the 
first choice because of the risk of dependence and sedation.
Steatorrhea may be secondary to an overgrowth of anaerobic 
bacteria in the motionless dilated loops of bowel.
As the disease progresses, bacterial overgrowth can result in 
diarrhoea. This can be reduced with oral amoxycillin-claevulinic 
acid combination, metronidazole/tinidazole, cephalosporin, 
tetracycline (doxycycline), ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole or nonabsorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin or neomycin. Rifaxamin 
is often the first choice if it is on the local drug formulary. These 
may be used as necessary or in repeated courses every 2–6 weeks, 
often rotating (sometimes with a 1–2-week period of no antibiotic) to another antibiotic for a similar period of time before 
repeating. If metronidazole is used in the long term, the patient 
must be warned to stop if they develop numbness or tingling in 
their feet as an early sign of reversible peripheral neuropathy 
and be used at the lowest dose possible. Ciprofloxacin use longer 
term can cause tendonitis and rupture and again low dose and 
vigilance are required. The risk of resistant organisms, including 
Clostridioides difficile, should also be considered. There are no 
data currently about the use of probiotics.
Bacterial overgrowth is virtually inevitable and can cause 
cachexia without necessarily causing diarrhoea, so antibiotics (as 
suggested above) may be needed.
Bile salt malabsorption may occur and respond, if tolerated, 
to bile salt sequestrants (cholestyramine and colesevelam). It is 
most likely if terminal ileum has been resected or if there are 
large areas of fluid-filled dilated bowel.
Octreotide, occasionally used for its effects in reducing secretions and slowing gastrointestinal motility, has also been used in 
refractory SIBO.
9.2.5 Bloating/distension
Bloating and distension are common symptoms and not easy 
to treat. Reducing gas-forming microbes (eg, those producing 
CO2
, methane and hydrogen sulphide) with a low fibre diet or 
an antibiotic (rifaxamin), giving simethicone or peppermint oil 
or reducing visceral hypersensitivity (antidepressants) or constipation may help along with increasing physical exercise.128
9.3 Neuromodulation (pacemakers)
There is some limited evidence for gastric electrical stimulation (gastric pacing) to improve vomiting symptoms where 
gastroparesis is prominent and small bowel function relatively 
intact.129–131 Patients with diabetic gastroparesis respond best 
and, in general, responders tend to have more severe vomiting. 
Patients with idiopathic gastroparesis have a potentially higher 
rate of poor response to gastric electrical stimulation.132 Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation has shown some promise 
both for improving gastroduodenal motility and reducing pain 
sensitivity.133
The dorsal column pathways are involved in the transmission 
of visceral pelvic pain. Spinal cord stimulation suppresses the 
visceral response to colon distension in an animal model and 
therefore may be an effective therapy for chronic pelvic pain 
of visceral origin. There has been success reported in one study 
of 35 patients in whom the catheter tip was situated at the T5 
position for a median of 9 days (range 4–14).134 The Cochrane 
database concludes that more studies are needed.135
Sacral nerve stimulation uses electrical stimulation applied to 
the sacral nerves, eliciting a physiological effect on the lower 
bowel, anal sphincter and pelvic floor, and has shown some 
success in treating faecal incontinence and constipation.136–138
A Cochrane review concluded that from three studies there 
was “very limited evidence that sacral nerve stimulation can 
improve continence in selected people with faecal incontinence, 
and reduce symptoms in selected people with constipation” and 
larger “good quality randomised crossover trials are needed”.139
There is no evidence that sacral nerve stimulation helps any of 
the symptoms in patients with CIPO.
Small intestinal electrical stimulation is at an experimental 
stage.
9.4 Nutritional support
Nutritional assessment and support is an important aspect of 
management. With appropriate therapy, many patients with 
CIPO manage to maintain their nutritional status through the 
oral/enteral route without the need for PS.
9.4.1 Dietary adjustments/fluid management
Gastric motility may be far less deranged for liquids than for 
solids with the result that many patients tolerate liquid feeds 
better than solid meals. Sometimes frequent small meals with 
low-fat, low-fibre and liquid nutritional supplements may be 
helpful.
If the patient has a stoma and a short bowel, fluid restriction, 
a sipped glucose saline solution, use of loperamide sometimes in 
high dose (occasionally with the addition of codeine phosphate) 
will reduce the risks of dehydration, sodium and magnesium 
depletion. If a high net secretory output occurs, a proton pump 
inhibitor (or occasionally octreotide) may be needed.140
Post-feeding orthostatic symptoms in partial autonomic failure 
may respond to dietary adjustments and drugs such as fludrocortisone, midodrine and octreotide.
9.4.2 Vitamin/mineral deficiencies
Care is needed to ensure that micronutrient deficiencies particularly of iron, vitamin B12 and the fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A, D and E, do not occur. Magnesium deficiency 
is common especially if a high output stoma. Magnesium oxide 
may cause fewer osmotic effects than other preparations but is 
expensive.
Bone mineral density is important to address and should be 
assessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning in those with malnutrition. For patients who cannot take 
oral measures to improve bone density, parenteral bisphosphonates such as zoledronate should be considered.
9.4.3 Enteral nutrition
Enteral nutrition is preferred if the gut is accessible and 
absorbing. In carefully selected patients, feeding jejunostomy 
with or without decompression (venting) gastrostomy may 
be tried. A percutaneous endoscopic or radiological gastrojejunostomy is preferred to a direct jejunostomy where possible 
as direct jejunostomy tubes are more subject to leakage, retention, pain and skin problems, and gastro-jejunostomies can 
achieve both post-pyloric feeding and venting with generally 
easier endoscopic placement whereas direct jejunal tubes will 
often need to be placed surgically. Invasive enteral tube insertion 
should be preceded where possible by a trial of naso-enteral tube

Guidelines
feeding to ensure absorption and tolerance prior to running the 
risks of mortality and morbidity associated with invasive tube 
placement.
If liquid enteral feeds are given, any excess can be aspirated by 
enteric tube or gastrostomy before the start of the next meal to 
ensure that excess volumes do not accumulate in the stomach. 
Gastrostomies can be used, therefore, to aspirate liquid gastric 
contents (decompression of venting gastrostomy) as well as a 
conduit for feeding, particularly when there is a need to bypass 
a malfunctioning oesophagus and/or stomach. Pulmonary aspiration of large volume vomits is a very serious complication that 
may be difficult to prevent. A low antral site for gastro-jejunal 
tube placement is preferred to optimise drainage/venting and 
also stability of the jejunal extension.
9.4.4 Parenteral nutrition (PN)
Long-term PN should be reserved for patients with significant 
malnutrition or electrolyte disturbance who cannot tolerate 
enteral nutrition. Complications associated with total PN include 
infections, sepsis and cholestatic hepatic dysfunction.
If safe nutritional status cannot be maintained through the oral 
and enteral route, then HPN may be required. One problem of 
HPN in these patients is that they have more problems than do 
patients with a short bowel.103 They particularly have a higher 
incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection, septicaemia
and venous thrombosis. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. 
Procoagulation states sometimes exist, and it is possible that there is 
increased bacterial translocation from the gut. Opioid medication 
(which at high doses suppresses some aspects of immune function) 
and/or cyclizine increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream
infection, partly as the care taken by the patient in the management 
of their infusions at home,141 due to cognitive effects, is reduced. 
The use of feeding lines to administer any drug is to be strongly 
discouraged because of the risk of catheter infection. Such patients 
test the capabilities of the best organised nutrition teams to the full 
and should be managed in centres with a large experience.142 Vigilance for psychopathology and ongoing involvement of psychology 
and liaison psychiatry should be offered. There may be a benefit 
from the mutual support patients can give to each other in these 
situations, although patients with significant psychopathology can 
have a detrimental effect on others.
Howard et al143 have emphasised that the clinical outcome on 
HPN, like the mortality risk, is to a large extent a reflection of the 
underlying condition. While about 70% of patients with Crohn’s 
disease or ischaemic bowel conditions are fully rehabilitated after 
the first year on HPN, only a third of those with chronic intestinal dysmotility are similarly rehabilitated and it is most likely if 
the gut is not dilated.99 Impairment of strength and of well-being 
as a result of undernutrition and fluid and electrolyte imbalance 
will be corrected by HPN, but if the patient continues to experience vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain from the underlying 
condition, quality of life will remain suboptimal. The annual risk 
of catheter-related sepsis among HPN patients is consistently 
around 0.5 per 1000 catheter days but tends to be higher among 
those with chronic pseudo-obstruction, especially if they remain 
on opioid analgesia103 144; by contrast, patients with systemic 
sclerosis who may tend to have lower opioid requirements have 
lower catheter infection rates.145
Over half of those with pseudo-obstruction receiving HPN 
will be alive at 10 years.146
9.5 Surgical options
Surgery is to be avoided in this group of patients who are at high 
risk of iatrogenic injury; however, judicious palliative surgical 
intervention (resection, bypass or stoma formation) can improve 
symptoms and quality of life.147 148 If constipation is difficult to 
manage and high volume saline washouts are needed, then colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis or ileostomy may be necessary 
but diarrhoea or continuing episodes of obstruction may remain 
a problem. Adhesiolysis in the absence of a clear focal obstruction carries a high risk of severe complications and morbidity 
with ultimately more adhesion recurrence and worsening pain. 
Urology is often needed to help with neuromuscular disorders 
of the urinary tract (dilated ureters and bladder) and stents and/
or a suprapubic catheter may need to be inserted. Especially 
in women, there may be fertility problems due to dilated nonfunctioning fallopian tubes. Often the pains experienced result 
in gynaecological referrals.
9.5.1 Bypass surgery and enteric resections
There are several reports of surgery in adults to help these 
patients with pseudo-obstruction, although the clear separation 
into those with a myopathy and those with a neuropathy is not 
always made.90 147 After diagnostic laparotomy, bypass operations (gastro-enterostomy, duodeno-jejunostomy and jejunoenterostomy) can be performed in adults to reduce vomiting 
if there is dilated gut. If gastric surgery is being performed, a 
vagotomy must be avoided as this will further retard gastrointestinal transit. Many have an ileostomy56 90 often to treat constipation and some develop a short bowel from multiple resections. 
The reports of success are variable and any undertaking of 
surgery needs to be a multidisciplinary decision and based on 
each individual patient. Outcome is poorer in patients with 
evidence of small bowel dysmotility who undergo colectomy.
9.5.2 Small intestinal transplantation
Dysmotility is a rare indication for intestinal transplantation in 
adults with dysmotility needing HPN, but since the outcomes 
of HPN are currently better, transplantation should be reserved 
for those who develop complications related to PN including 
IF-associated liver disease, central vein thrombosis with reduced 
venous access, and recurrent catheter-related bloodstream infections.140 149 150 If other organs are damaged, a multivisceral 
transplantation may be considered. The role of small bowel 
transplantation solely to improve quality of life by ceasing 
PN is somewhat contentious, but as worldwide experience of 
transplantation increases with corresponding improvements in 
survival rates, the indications for transplantation may broaden 
in the future. It is vital that all patients considered for transplantation are reviewed by an experienced MDT with expertise in 
IF and a transplant centre.151 Pain is not a good indication for a 
transplant.
9.6 Psychosocial treatments
Psychological support from nurses, physicians and psychologists 
is important. Vigilance needs to be maintained for the presence 
of psychopathology even in patients with a strong suspicion 
of gastrointestinal neuromuscular disorder. In one case series, 
six patients diagnosed initially with IF had significant psychopathology requiring specialised psychiatric unit treatment.25 In 
addition to psychological distress including anxiety and depression, other psychological problems encountered can include 
somatisation disorder, personality disorders, substance misuse 
and disordered eating (see also section 5.4). Dysmotility disorders can also be associated with a risk of self-harm including 
suicide. Clinical psychology and liaison psychiatry provide

overlapping but complementary approaches and ideally a MDT 
involving both specialties should be available.
10.0 Outcomes
Outcome can vary from minor symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome to problems resulting in home parenteral 
feeding, major analgesics and frequent hospital admissions. 
Causes of death in these patients include pulmonary aspiration, 
pulmonary embolism, cardiac failure and suicide. Cardiac failure 
may be the terminal event in hollow visceral myopathy. The 
relationship between 'megaduodenum' and upper gastrointestinal tract cancer seems tenuous if it exists. Death will often be 
related to the underlying condition—obviously so in the case of 
pseudo-obstruction occurring as a paraneoplastic phenomenon, 
and also particularly in the degenerative neuropathies, collagen 
vascular disorders and infiltrative conditions such as amyloid. 
Amiot et al reported 51 patients with CIPO who required HPN, 
representing 26years of experience, and found that surgery was 
required in 84% of patients and survival probability was 94%, 
78%, 75% and 68% at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively.56
Higher mortality was associated with systemic sclerosis. The 
20-year experience of HPN from the Mayo Clinic found that 
the survival for patients with dysmotility disorders was second 
worse only to cancer due to the progression of the underlying 
disease, which was similar to data from St Mark’s Hospital in 
the UK. Recently published data from the Salford IF Unit have 
demonstrated worse outcomes for patients with a CIPO than a 
non-CIPO dysmotility phenotype.141 However, it would appear 
that there is room for improved outcomes in this challenging 
patient population by cost-effective investment in tertiary multidisciplinary provision.
11.0 Summary
Most cases of intestinal dysmotility will be without a clear diagnosis and thus labelled as idiopathic. Addressing the patient’s 
primary symptoms and treating malnutrition are the keys to 
management.
