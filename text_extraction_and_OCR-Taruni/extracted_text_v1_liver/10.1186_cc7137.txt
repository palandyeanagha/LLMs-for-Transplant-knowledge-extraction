Abstract
Introduction Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a
classic side effect of metformin and is known to be a severe
disease with a high mortality rate. The treatment of MALA with
dialysis is controversial and is the subject of many case reports
in the literature. We aimed to assess the prevalence of MALA in
a 16-bed, university-affiliated, intensive care unit (ICU), and the
effect of dialysis on patient outcome.
Methods Over a five-year period, we retrospectively identified
all patients who were either admitted to the ICU with metformin
as a usual medication, or who attempted suicide by metformin
ingestion. Within this population, we selected patients
presenting with lactic acidosis, thus defining MALA, and
described their clinical and biological features.
Results MALA accounted for 0.84% of all admissions during
the study period (30 MALA admissions over five years) and was
associated with a 30% mortality rate. The only factors
associated with a fatal outcome were the reason for admission
in the ICU and the initial prothrombin time. Although patients
who went on to haemodialysis had higher illness severity scores,
as compared with those who were not dialysed, the mortality
rates were similar between the two groups (31.3% versus
28.6%).
Conclusions MALA can be encountered in the ICU several
times a year and still remains a life-threatening condition.
Treatment is restricted mostly to supportive measures, although
haemodialysis may possess a protective effect.
Introduction
Since the UK Prospective Diabetes Study was published in
1998, metformin has become the standard of care for overweigh patients with diabetes [1]. Indeed, metformin has been
shown to reduce the rate of cardiovascular disease within this
population [1].
Metformin is a small molecule (165 kDa) with a 50% oral bioavailability; it does not undergo hepatic metabolism and the
main route of elimination is renal tubular secretion. Metformin
is not bound to proteins and its apparent volume of distribution
is usually reported to be higher than 3 L/kg (63 to 646 L in
total) attesting to the predominance of the intracellular location. Considering these data, metformin can theoretically be
extracted from blood by haemodialysis if dialysis is conducted
for long enough to mobilise the intracellular form.
Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but classic side effect of metformin [2]. Two years after the introduction of this drug to the US market, a study showed an
incidence of MALA of two to nine cases per 100,000 patients
treated with metformin each year [3] with an associated mortality rate as high as 50%.
The physiopathology of MALA is complex and mostly unclear.
However, this side effect seems to be closely related to the
anti-hyperglycaemic effect of metformin [4]. It is also known
that metformin impairs lactate clearance of the liver through
the inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain [5,6]. Although increased lactic acid production may be
induced by haemodynamic instability and/or tissue hypoxia
associated with severe metformin overdose or any underlying
unstable cardiovascular or respiratory condition, lactic acidoICU: intensive care unit; MALA: metformin-associated lactic acidosis; SAPSII: simplified acute physiology score II.

sis is predominantely due to a lack of lactate's clearance than
to an increased production.
Intensivists may be confronted with MALA because of its
potential severity. Nevertheless, the treatment of MALA is
mostly restricted to supportive measures as there is no specific therapeutics. Haemodialysis is appealing as it can buffer
acidosis and theoretically extract metformin from blood [7,8].
Unfortunately, this technique has not gained widespread
acceptance due to the lack of well-conducted studies. Indeed,
only case reports have dealt with this subject [9-12].
We aimed to assess the prevalence of MALA in a 16-bed, university-affiliated, intensive care unit (ICU), and the effect of
dialysis on patient outcome.
Materials and methods
Study design and definitions
The study was conducted at the Hopital Central, University of
Nancy, France. The hospital records of all patients admitted to
the ICU between August 2002 and August 2007 were retrospectively evaluated and patients were included if they met the
following criteria: current metformin medication as their usual
treatment; metformin overdose in the setting of a suicide
attempt; and lactic acidosis defined by lactate concentration
higher than 5 mmol/L and bicarbonate level less than 22
mmol/L. Patients were not enrolled if a limitation of care was
decided on admission.
The retrospective and non-interventional nature of this study
waived the need for ethics committee approval.
Clinical and laboratory features at admission and during the
ICU stay were studied: simplified acute physiology score
(SAPS) II of severity, Charlson index (used to assess the heaviness of comorbidities) [13], age, sex, reason for admission to
the ICU, blood pressure, respiratory rate and vasopressor
requirement. Acute renal failure was defined according to the
RIFLE (acronym indicating Risk of renal dysfunction; Injury to
the kidney; Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function
and End-stage kidney disease) criteria (increase creatinine
times three or glomerular filtration rate decrease of more than
75%; urine output less than 0.3 mL/kg/hour every 24 hours or
anuria for longer than 12 hours despite appropriate fluid
replacement) [14]. Biological data recorded were arterial pH,
blood lactate, bicarbonate, glucose and creatinine concentrations, as well as prothrombin time.
Patient population
The patients were divided according to their 28-day outcome
in order to investigate if there were differences in relation to all
the studied parameters. The population was also split regarding the use of haemodialysis. Due to the retrospective design,
no rules precluded the use of haemodialysis.
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or
median (range) for quantitative variables. Comparisons
between groups were performed with a Student's t-test,
Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney test when appropriate.
Analysis of associations between death and categorised risk
factors was done with Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chisquare test. Statistical analyses were conducted using the R
software [15] and a two-tailed p < 0.05 was deemed significant.
Results
During the study period, 3556 patients were admitted into the
ICU. Among this group, 160 were identified as having been
exposed to metformin but only 30 (18.7%) presented with
MALA (Figure 1). Reasons for ICU admission were shock (n =
12), acute renal failure (n = 9), acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury (n = 3), suicide attempt (n = 3), cardiac arrest (n = 2) and intracerebral haemorrhage (n = 1).
Thus, no patient was referred to the ICU because of MALA but
with an acute disorder associated with the development of
MALA.
Patients' characteristics are reported in Table 1. Length of stay
in the ICU was 12.8 ± 17.7 days and the 28-day mortality rate
was 30%.
When compared with survivors, non-survivors were more often
referred to the ICU for shock (p = 0.002), displayed a higher
SAPSII score (p = 0.004) and a higher prothrombin time (p =
0.04). The degree of lactic acidosis did not differ between

groups, nor did the requirement for mechanical ventilation,
vasopressors or dialysis.
On admission, 80% of our patients presented with acute renal
failure, of whom 62.5% underwent dialysis therapy (no patient
had a history of chronic renal failure). Only one patient with an
unaltered renal function underwent dialysis therapy because
of severe acidosis. Of note, 55.6% of survivors were dialysed
as compared with 52.4% of non-survivors (p = 0.8). Intermittent veno-venous haemodialysis with the use of a bicarbonate
buffer was performed and we observed no dialysis disequilibrium syndromes.
We also compared patients who underwent dialysis and
patients who did not (Table 2). There was a trend for a higher
severity among dialysed patients as reflected by a higher SAPSII score (p = 0.04), and trend towards a more frequent
requirement for supportive therapies (vasopressors, mechanical ventilation; not statistically significant) and a higher degree
of metabolic acidosis. Despite this higher severity, the mortality rate did not differ between dialysed and non-dialysed
patients.
Discussion
The definition and diagnostic criteria of MALA are based on
metformin exposure associated with the presence of lactic aciTable 1

dosis. We therefore enrolled patients with a lactate concentration of 5 mmol/L or higher and a bicarbonate level of less than
22 mmol/L evidenced before or at admission into the ICU.
Routine assessment of metformin plasma concentration is not
easy and of no value because metformin is essentially an intracellular toxin. Moreover, as any concentration of metformin
may impair liver lactate clearance, it is worth considering that
the observation of lactic acidosis concomitant to a recent
ingestion of metformin may, at least in part, be related to this
drug. We then choose to consider MALA as lactic acidosis
observed in all patients with a recent ingestion of metformin.
The current study describes 30 cases of MALA and there is,
to the best of our knowledge, only one study reporting a larger
series of cases but not focussed on critically ill patients [3].
We found that MALA was present in about 1% of patients
admitted to the ICU, and indeed metformin is a factor that is
detrimental to the outcome in the setting of an acute disease
rather than the primary reason for referral to the ICU.
The 30% death rate we observed is lower than previously
reported [3]. This may be because of a better awareness of
this side effect, as well as a continuous improvement of care
in the ICUs. We also noted a high rate (80%) of acute renal

failure on admission; this highlights the role of metformin accumulation in the pathophysiology of MALA.
The leading factor associated with a fatal outcome is unsurprisingly the reason for ICU referral: admission for shock is
associated with an increase risk of death as compared with
referral for acute renal failure or suicide attempt. Interestingly,
the degree of lactic acidosis was not associated with outcome. The fact that prothrombin time was related to survival
may reflect the importance of liver function in the pathophysiology of MALA, but may also just be a consequence of shock.
We also observed a trend towards higher illness severity
scores in the dialysed group of patients: SAPSII score was
higher and needs for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors
tended to be more frequent in dialysed patients. The fact that
despite these higher illness severity scores the mortality rate
was no different to that of the non-dialysed patients may suggest a beneficial affect of dialysis. Unfortunately, more detailed
analyses with adjustment for severity were precluded by the
small size of our population. Therefore, the protective effect of
dialysis remains hypothetical.
Apart from haemodialysis, continuous veno-venous haemofiltration or haemodiafiltration, dichloroacetate and/or sodium
bicarbonate infusions have been proposed as part of the treatment of MALA [8,16], but again only from small case series
discussions.
Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First,
the small size of our series did not allow us to make multiple
comparisons and multivariate analyses. Unfortunately, there is
no larger study dealing with MALA in the ICU. Second, the current study was retrospective and therefore we couldn't correct
the bias by which only the more severely ill patients were dialysed. Finally, in some situations (e.g. cardiac arrest or shock),
the exact role of metformin in explaining the degree of lactic
acidosis could not be definitely ascertained as these conditions may per se be associated with hyperlactataemia. Nevertheless, we strictly applied the recommended definition of
MALA for the inclusion of our patients considering that even in
these above mentioned conditions, part of lactic acidosis is
explained by metformin-induced impaired liver clearance.
Conclusion
We described one of the largest series of patients with MALA
and suggested a possible beneficial effect of dialysis in the
care of this disorder. Larger and prospectively designed studies are clearly needed to draw firm recommendations on the
treatment of MALA.

• MALA is of low (1%) prevalence in medical ICUs
• MALA is associated with a high (30%) mortality rate
• Prothrombin time on admission seems to be inversely 
related to survival
