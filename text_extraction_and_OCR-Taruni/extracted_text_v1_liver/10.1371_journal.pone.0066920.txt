Abstract
Background and Aims: The association between HLA-DP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and chronic hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection varies between different populations. We aimed to study the association between HLA-DP SNPs and
HBV infection and disease activity in the Chinese population of Hong Kong.
Methods: We genotyped SNPs rs3077 (near HLA-DPA1) and rs9277378 and rs3128917 (both near HLA-DPB1) in 500 HBV
carriers (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive), 245 non-HBV infected controls (HBsAg- and antibody to hepatitis B
core protein [anti-HBc]-negative), and 259 subjects with natural HBV clearance (HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive). Inactive
HBV carriers state was defined by HBV DNA levels ,2,000 IU/ml and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase level for
least 12 months.
Results: Compared to the non-HBV infected subjects, the HBV carriers had a significantly lower frequency of the rs3077 T
allele (p = 0.0040), rs9277378 A allele (p = 0.0068) and a trend for lower frequency of rs3128917 T allele (p = 0.054). These
alleles were associated with an increased chance of HBV clearance (rs3077: OR = 1.41, p = 0.0083; rs9277378: OR = 1.61,
p = 0.00011; rs3128917: OR = 1.54, p = 0.00017). Significant associations between HLA-DP genotypes and HBV clearance were
also found under different genetic models. Haplotype TAT was associated with an increased chance of HBV clearance
(OR = 1.64, p = 0.0013). No association was found between these SNPs and HBV disease activity.
Conclusion: HLA-DP SNPs rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917 were associated with chronicity of HBV disease in the Chinese.
Further studies are required to determine whether these SNPs influence the disease endemicity in different ethnic
populations.

Introduction
Approximately 400 million people worldwide are chronic
carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1]. The disease spectrum of
chronic hepatitis B varies among patients, ranging from inactive
non-replicative to active replicative state, which may lead to
fulminant hepatic failure, liver cirrhosis, or hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). While persistence or resolution of HBV
infection may be affected by a variety of factors, including viral,
environmental and host factors, family or twin studies have
suggested that host genetic constitution is also an important factor
which influences chronicity of HBV infection [2,3]. Many host
genetic variations, including genes coding for cytokines such as
interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factors [4], estrogen
receptor alpha [5], vitamin D receptor [6], mannose-binding
protein [7], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) [8] and
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) [9,10,11,12], have been suggested
to influence chronicity or clearance of HBV infection. In
particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the
CTLA-4, genes coding for an inhibitory receptor expressed by Tlymphocytes, and near the HLA-DR13 locus, coding for component of the major histocompatibility complex class II cell surface
receptors, have been studied in several case-control studies for
their association with HBV infection in different populations
[8,9,10,11,12]. However, these candidate gene studies were not
conducted on a large scale genome-wide approach.
Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been
performed with large cohorts to study the association of genetic
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66920

variations with HBV infection. These GWAS studies did not find a
strong association between HBV infection and those previously
identified candidate HBV-associated SNPs. These GWAS studies
demonstrated that certain SNPs near the HLA-DP loci, are
associated with persistent HBV infection [13,14,15]. In a
pioneering GWAS study with 786 Japanese chronic HBV carriers
and 2,201 controls, Kamatani and colleagues have identified an
association between chronic hepatitis B and 11 SNPs in the HLADP region, two of which, namely rs3077 and rs9277535, were
further validated in three additional Japanese and Thai cohorts
[13]. The association between these HLA-DP SNPs with chronicity
and/or clearance of HBV infection was further confirmed by two
other GWAS studies, one with 2,667 Japanese chronic HBV
carriers and 6,496 controls by the same group [14] and one with
181 Japanese chronic HBV carries, 184 healthy controls, and 185
individuals with natural clearance of HBV [15]. The association of
some of these HLA-DP SNPs with HBV infection has been verified
in many studies, but the association differs between studies in
different population cohorts, and more SNPs are yet to be
identified [16,17,18,19,20,21].
HLA-DP molecules, belonging to HLA class II, are involved in
antigen presentation to CD4+ T helper cells. As HLA-DP plays an
important role in host-immune response and particularly antigen
presentation, it would be interesting to investigate the possible
association of the HLA-DP loci variations with hepatitis B disease
activity, which is immune-mediated. Since the findings are not
consistent in different study cohorts [18,20], the association of
these HLA-DP SNPs with HBV disease activity remains unclear.
In the present study, we primarily aimed to investigate the
association of 3 HLA-DP SNPs, namely rs3077, rs9277378 and
rs3128917, with chronicity of HBV infection in the Chinese
population in Hong Kong. In addition, we studied the association
of these SNPs with hepatitis B disease activity. This will extend our
understanding of the association between HLA-DP variations and
HBV infection and may provide some evidences to explain the
widely different prevalence of chronic HBV in different ethnic
groups in the world.
Patients and Methods
Patients
The present study recruited 500 chronic HBV carriers (hepatitis
B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive for more than 6 months) who
had been followed up in our liver clinics in the Queen Mary
Hospital, Hong Kong. Upon their first and/or follow up visits,
these HBV carriers had given verbal informed consent for the
storage of blood samples for further studies. We have also
recruited 706 consecutive HBsAg-negative control subjects who
have donated blood at the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood
Transfusion Service, and they all had given verbal informed
consent during blood donation for the storage of blood samples.
Data were analyzed anonymously for the 706 HBsAg-negative
blood donors. Approval has been obtained from the Institution
Review Board, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong
Kong, for retrieving archived samples for this study. Among the
706 HBsAg-negative subjects, 202 had previous history of hepatitis
B vaccination and were excluded from the subsequent analysis. All
study patients/subjects are Chinese, and all blood samples were
collected during the period January 2010 to March 2011. All
subjects were tested negative for hepatitis C virus and human
immunodeficiency virus by the Procleix Ultrio Assay (Novartis
Diagnostics, Emeryville, CA).
Of the 504 non-vaccinated control subjects, 259 had HBV
natural clearance (HBV clearance group), denoted by the presence
of detectable anti-HBc by the Elecsys assay (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland). The remaining 245 subjects (non-HBV
infected group) were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBc.
Longitudinal clinical data, including alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and HBV DNA measurements, were obtained from the 500
HBV carriers. Inactive asymptomatic HBV carriers were defined
by HBV DNA levels ,2,000 IU/ml and persistently normal ALT
(,58 U/L for male and ,36 U/L for female) for least 12 months.
Genotyping Assays
Three SNPs within chromosome 6, namely rs3077 (in the 39
untranslated region of the HLA-DPA1 gene), rs9277378 and
rs3128917 (inside and near the HLA-DPB1 gene, respectively),
were studied (Figure 1). rs3077 was selected for this study because
rs3077 and rs9277535 (at the 39 untranslated region of HLADPB1) have been identified to be strongly associated with
persistent HBV infection [13]. We chose to study rs9277378
instead of rs9277535 because, our previous large scale genotypic
analysis revealed that, rs9277378 was more readily detected in
DNA extracted from sera than rs9277535 (data not shown).
Moreover, linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis by the Haploview
software (version 4.2) revealed that rs9277378 has a strong LD
with rs9277535 (D’ = 1.00, R2= 0.954) in the HapMap Han
Chinese in Beijing (CHB) and Japanese in Tokyo (JPT)
Populations. [22] We also confirmed, in a small subset of 50
randomly selected samples from the current study, that rs9277535
and rs9277378 genotypes were concordant in 48 (96%) samples
with a strong LD (D’ = 1.00, R2= 0.903). The SNP rs3128917 was
also chosen for the present study, as this SNP has the highest odds
ratio (OR) among 11 SNPs which influence chronicity of HBV
infection [16].
The 3 selected SNPs, rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917, were
genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, free circulating DNA was
extracted from 200 ml of serum samples, using the Purelink
Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). The SNP genotyping reaction was performed in a TaqMan real-time PCR format,
using SNP-specific primers and FAM- and VIC-labeled allelespecific probes provided in the TaqMan SNP genotyping kit (Life
Technologies) and the real-time PCR enzymes and reagents
provided in QuantiFast Probe PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). The real-time PCR reaction was performed in a
RotorGene-Q real-time PCR System (QIAGEN).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using PLINK v.1.07
(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/) [23] and SPSS
18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Logistic regression was performed
to compare between case and control groups, and all ORs and p
values were adjusted for age and sex. The Student t test was used
to test normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were
tested by the Chi-square test. Statistical significance was defined by
p,0.05.
Results
Demographic Characteristics and Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium
The mean age of the HBV carriers was 46.8612.1 years, which
was significantly higher than that of the non-HBV infected
subjects (36.469.9 years; p,0.0001) and that of the HBV
clearance subjects (40.3610.9 years; p,0.0001). The proportion
of male (304/500; 61%) in the HBV carriers was significantly
higher than that in the non-HBV infected group (127/245; 52%;

p = 0.020), but did not differ from that in the HBV clearance
subjects (152/259; 59%; p = 0.573). Three SNPs (rs3077,
rs9277378, and rs3128917) were genotyped in these 500 HBV
carriers, 245 non-HBV infected controls and 259 HBV clearance
subjects. All 3 polymorphisms in the HBV carriers, non-HBV
infected controls and HBV clearance subjects were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium, and there was no significant difference
between the observed and expected genotypic frequencies in all 3
SNPs in all 3 groups (all p.0.05; Table S1).
Association between HLA-DP Polymorphisms and
Chronicity of HBV Infection
The allelic frequencies of the three studied SNPs are listed in
Table 1. The minor alleles for rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917
determined from the present study cohort were T, A and T,
respectively. There was a significantly higher proportion of the
rs3077 and rs9277378 minor alleles (T and A, respectively) in the
non-HBV infected controls than in the HBV carriers (p = 0.0040
and 0.0068, respectively). There was a trend of a higher
proportion of the rs3128917 T allele in the non-HBV infected
controls than in the HBV carriers (p = 0.054). The HBV clearance
subjects had a significantly higher proportion of rs3077 T allele,
rs9277378 A allele, and rs3128917 T allele than in the HBV
carriers (p = 0.0083, 0.00011, and 0.00017 for rs3077, rs9277378
and rs3128917, respectively).
Genotype frequencies for the 3 SNPs were compared between
the HBV carriers and non-HBV infected controls, as well as
between the HBV carriers and HBV clearance group. The
genotype distributions of the 3 study groups are listed in Table 2.
Compared with the non-HBV infected controls, HBV carriers had
a lower prevalence of the minor alleles of rs3077 and rs9277378,
as shown by both the dominant-effect (homozygote minor+heterozygote vs. homozygote major) model (p = 0.0089 and 0.0162 for
rs3077 and rs9277378, respectively) and the additive-effect
(additive dosage of minor allele) model (P = 0.0036 and 0.0058
for rs3077 and rs9277378, respectively). There was also a lower
frequency of the rs3128917 T allele in the HBV carriers when
analyzed using the dominant-effect model (p = 0.0395), but the
difference was only marginal when the additive-effect model was
applied (p = 0.0561).
Comparison was also made between the HBV carriers and
HBV clearance subjects to test the association of these 3 SNPs with
natural clearance of HBV infection. As shown in Table 2, rs3077
T allele, rs9277378 A allele, and rs3128917 T allele were
associated with an increased chance of clearance of infection in
both the dominant-effect model (rs3077: OR = 1.42, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.95, p = 0.0284; rs9277378:
OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.18–2.2, p = 0.0029; and rs3218917:
OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.29–2.48, p = 0.00054) and the additiveeffect model (rs3077: OR: 1.42, 95% CI = 1.1–1.83, p = 0.0079;
rs9277378: OR = 1.62 95% CI = 1.27–2.07, p = 0.00011; and
rs3218917: OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.22–1.9, p = 0.00024).
Genotypic analysis showed that rs9277378 AA genotype might
be most relevant to the clearance of HBV infection (OR = 3.20,
p = 8.7161025
; Table 2). Therefore we performed subgroup
analysis to investigate the role of rs3077 and rs3128917 in the
patients/subjects with rs9277378 GG genotype, which represent
the genotype least likely to clear HBV infection. As shown in
Table 2, 398 patients/subjects had rs9277378 GG genotype: 283
(56.6%) HBV carriers and 115 (44.4%) subjects with HBV
clearance. Among these 398 patients/subjects, there was no
significant difference between the HBV carriers and HBV
clearance subjects in the proportion of the protective allele of
rs3077 (A allele proportion = 9.2% vs. 11.3%, respectively;

p = 0.727) and rs3128917 (T allele proportion = 13.8% vs. 17.4%,
respectively; p = 0.254).
Haplotype Analysis
LD information of these 3 SNPs for our 3 study groups is shown
in Table S2. Haplotype analysis was also performed to assess the
effect of the combination of these SNPs on HBV chronicity and
clearance of HBV. Of the 8 possible haplotypes out of these 3
SNPs, 5 common haplotypes (with overall haplotype frequencies
.0.05) were identified. As shown in Table 3, comparing to the
haplotype containing all 3 risk alleles (CGG), the haplotypes TAT
and CAT were associated with a higher chance of HBV clearance
(for TAT: OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.21–2.24, p = 0.0013; and for
CAT: OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.35–2.9, p = 0.00041). Since both
haplotype CAT and TAT were associated with HBV clearance,
we also performed haplotype analysis on only the last 2 SNPs
(rs9277378 and rs3128917; both at HLA-DPB1 gene). The
haplotype AT was significantly associated with an increased
chance of HBV clearance (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.32–2.18,
p = 3.6661025
, with reference to haplotype GG).
Association between HLA-DP Polymorphisms and HBV
Disease Activity
Among the 500 HBV carriers, 192 (38.4%) were asymptomatic
inactive carriers (HBV DNA levels ,2,000 IU/ml and persistently
normal ALT for least 12 months). The active carriers were
significantly older than the inactive carriers (mean age: 48.1612.3
vs. 44.7611.7 years, respectively; p = 0.002), and there was a
higher percentage of male in the active carriers (66%) than in the
inactive carriers (53%; p = 0.003). Association analysis showed that
there were no significant differences in the allele frequency of
rs3077, rs9277378, and rs3128917 between the active and inactive
HBV carriers (p = 0.175, 0.240, and 0.656, respectively). Similarly,
there were no significant genotypic differences between the active
and inactive carriers when with the dominant model (p = 0.341,
0.411 and 0.495 for rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917, respectively) and additive model (p = 0.172, 0.229 and 0.663 for rs3077,
rs9277378 and rs3128917, respectively) were applied. None of the
haplotypes was associated with HBV disease activity (all p.0.05).
Discussion
Recent GWAS studies have suggested that certain variations in
the HLA-DP regions are associated with protection against chronic
hepatitis B as well as viral clearance [13,14,15]. In the present
study, we have studied 3 SNPs to extend our understanding of the
association of these variations with HBV infection in Chinese
population in Hong Kong and identified that the rs3077 T allele,
rs9277378 A allele and rs3128917 T allele were protective for
chronicity of HBV infection. While other studies have demonstrated that HLA-DP SNPs rs3077 and rs9277535 are strongly
associated with chronic hepatitis B infection
[13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21], to our knowledge, the present study
is the first study to determine the association between rs9277378
and chronicity of HBV infection. Although it is possible that the
authentic effect of rs9277378 polymorphism may be due to its high
LD with rs9277535, our findings with rs9277378 suggested that
more SNPs (or combination of SNPs) in the HLA-DP regions may
be associated with HBV infection.
Data on the association of HLA-DP variations with chronic
HBV infection are relatively scarce. In one study with 201
Caucasian chronic HBV carriers and 235 controls, the rs3077 T
allele has also been identified to be protective against chronic
HBV infection [18]. However, in that study, the rs3077 T
protective allele was the major allele in the Caucasian cohort. This
is consistent with the data from the HapMap project, which show
that the frequencies of the protective alleles for rs3077 (T),
rs9277378 (A) and rs3128917 (T) were higher in people with
European ancestry than in the African and Asian populations [22].
Taken together, all these findings of HLA-DP genomic variations
may shed light on the difference in the geographic distribution of
HBV infection: it is possible that the lower prevalence of chronic
HBV infection in the European/Caucasian populations is due to
the higher prevalence of the protective HLA-DP alleles. Similarly,
the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in the Asian/
African populations is likely due to the lower prevalence of the
protective HLA-DP alleles. However, it should be noted that other
factors, apart from HLA-DP variations, are also associated with
chronicity of HBV infection. If the HLA-DP variations were the
sole decisive factors for chronicity, the prevalence of chronic
hepatitis B would have been much more than 10% in the Chinese.
Moreover, a certain proportion of Asian/Chinese who possess the
risk HLA-DP alleles may not have contacted HBV in their life time.
Thus, many other factors, such as viral, environmental and other
host genetic factors, are likely to be associated with chronicity of
HBV infection. Nevertheless, the findings from the present as well
as other genetic association studies, suggest that HLA-DP
variations are probably one of the genetic factors which plays an

HLA-DP SNP and HBV Infection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66920

HLA class II, are involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T
helper cells. The antigen-binding sites of HLA-DP molecules are
highly polymorphic, and they play an important role in the
physical binding of peptides and subsequent recognition by T-cell
[26,27]. While it can be expected that variations in the HLA-DP
coding regions will affect antigen presentation and hence viral
clearance, the 3 studied SNPs do not lie within the HLA-DP coding
region. The SNP rs3077 lies in the 39 untranslated region of HLADPA1, rs9277378 lies in the second intron of HLA-DPB1, and
rs3128917 is located ,2.5kb downstream of HLA-DPB1 (Figure 1).
As variations in these SNPs will not cause specific changes in the
HLA-DP coding sequence, the effect of variations in these 3 SNPs
on HLA-DP function and viral clearance is likely to be indirect.
There are at least two possible mechanisms. Firstly, it is possible
that variation in these SNPs may alter the expression of the HLADP genes, through the alternation of non-coding RNA sequence or
microRNA binding site, as demonstrated in a recent study that
variations in rs3077/rs3128917 and rs9277535 affect the expression of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 respectively [28]. Secondly, as
these SNPs are in a strong LD with the HLA-DP alleles, it is also
likely that variations in these 3 SNPs reflect some yet to be
identified variations in HLA-DP coding sequence [13,16]. Thus
variations in these 3 SNPs may be a marker for the variations in
the HLA-DP coding sequence, which in turn affect antigen
presentation of HBV-derived peptides and alter immune response
and chronicity of infection. In fact, it has been demonstrated in a
chimpanzee HBV infection model that the outcome of HBV
infection is determined by the kinetics of viral spread and CD4 Tcell priming [29]. This suggests that the outcome of HBV infection
can be influenced by the physical binding of HBV-derived
peptides and their subsequent recognition by CD4 T-cell, which
is dependent on HLA-DP polymorphism. The correlation between
variations in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 SNPs and the change in
HLA-DP gene expression and molecule structure deserves a more
thorough sequence analysis, and the functional roles of these
polymorphisms remain to be studied.
Haplotype-based association analysis is more sensitive than
individual SNP association analysis and can capture additional
phenotype-related variants with a greater statistical power. This
study found that both haplotypes TAT and CAT were associated
with an increase chance of HBV clearance, with ORs of 1.64 and
1.98, respectively, both of which were greater than that of the
individual SNPs (Table 1). However, there are two caveats. First,
although the haplotype CAT showed the greatest OR of 1.98, its
relatively greater 95% CI range and low overall haplotype
frequency (0.097; data not shown) suggested that its effect on
HBV clearance requires further investigations. Second, compared
to the OR for individual alleles in the SNPs (for example, for
rs9277378, OR = 1.61; Table 1), there was only a small increase in
OR by the current haplotype analysis. In this current study, we
found that the rs9277378 AA genotype might have the strongest
association with HBV clearance (Table 2), and subgroup analysis
indicated that the role of other protective SNPs in the rs9277378
GG subgroup was not significant. Therefore individual SNP
analysis may be sufficient to provide information on the single
most relevant and best-associated SNP with HBV clearance.
Nevertheless, haplotype analysis may still have its value by
increasing the statistical power in the association analysis and
taking into account the effect of variants in other SNPs.
Given the greater genetic distance and weak LD between
rs3077 (near HLA-DPA1) and the two other SNPs (rs9277378 and
rs3128917; both near HLA-DPB1) and the relatively high LD
between rs9277378 and rs3128917 (Table S2), it is possible that
the two HLA-DPB1 SNPs form one haplotype block while rs3077
belongs to a distinct haplotype block. Our finding that haplotype
of the HLA-DPB1 SNPs (rs9277378 and rs3128917) alone was
associated with HBV clearance (OR = 1.70), independent on the
effect of HLA-DPA1 SNP rs3077, also pointed to this possibility.
Although, in our present analysis, the effect of rs3077 alone on
HBV clearance appeared to be less than that of the rs9277378-
rs3128917 haplotype, it is likely that a more complex network or
combination of more SNPs in the HLA region is associated with
chronicity of HBV infection. Other recent studies have identified
some SNPs in the HLA-DQ region which are also associated with
susceptibility to HBV infection [14,17]. The interaction between
SNPs in the HLA-DP and HLA-DQ regions, their association with
HBV infection in different populations, and their correlation with
HLA-DP and HLA-DQ gene expression remain to be a challenging
task to decode the genetic factors involved in HBV infection.
Another important finding from the present study is that we
were not able to identify any association between HLA-DP
genomic variations and HBV disease activity. This is consistent
to other studies which also fail to identify any association between
other SNPs in the HLA-DP region and HBV disease progression
[18,20]. Because only a limited number of SNPs was studied in our
and other studies, more in-depth studies may be required to
elucidate the association between HLA-DP variations and HBV
disease activity. Similarly, the association between SNPs in the
HLA regions and HCC development remains to be confirmed in
different study cohorts. Two recent studies had identified 3 SNPs,
rs2856718 (HLA-DQA2/DQB1), rs3077 (HLA-DPA1), and
rs9272105 (HLA-DQA1/DRB1) to be associated with HBV-related
HCC development [17,30], while other studies failed to associate
rs3077 and other HLA SNPs with HBV-related HCC development [15,21,31]. Detailed studies in different populations are
needed to further elucidate the association between HLA genetic
variations and HBV disease activity and HCC development.
In conclusion, we showed that HLA-DP SNP rs3077, rs9277378,
and rs3128917 were individually associated with chronicity of
HBV infection. Haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TAT
was strongly associated with HBV clearance. None of these 3
SNPs was associated with HBV disease activity.
