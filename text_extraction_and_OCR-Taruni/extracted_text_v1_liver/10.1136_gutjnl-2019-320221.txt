Abstract
These guidelines on transjugular intrahepatic 
portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) in the management 
of portal hypertension have been commissioned by the 
Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) of 
the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) under the 
auspices of the Liver Section of the BSG. The guidelines 
are new and have been produced in collaboration with 
the British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR) 
and British Association of the Study of the Liver (BASL). 
The guidelines development group comprises elected 
members of the BSG Liver Section, representation 
from BASL, a nursing representative and two patient 
representatives. The quality of evidence and grading 
of recommendations was appraised using the GRADE 
system. These guidelines are aimed at healthcare 
professionals considering referring a patient for a TIPSS. 
They comprise the following subheadings: indications; 
patient selection; procedural details; complications; and 
research agenda. They are not designed to address: the 
management of the underlying liver disease; the role of 
TIPSS in children; or complex technical and procedural 
aspects of TIPSS.
Executive summary of recommendat ions
Recommendations: TIPSS for variceal bleeding
► In patients who have gastro-oesophageal 
variceal bleeding refractory to endoscopic and 
drug therapy as defined by Baveno 6 critera,32
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stentshunt (TIPSS) is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
Salvage TIPSS is not recommended where the 
Child-Pugh score is >13 (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
► In patients who have Child’s C disease (C10-
13) or MELD ≥19, and bleeding from oesophageal varices or GOV1 and GOV2 gastric 
varices and are haemodynamically stable, 
early or pre-emptive TIPSS should be considered within 72hours of a variceal bleed where 
local resources allow (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). However, 
large multi-centre randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) are necessary to determine whether 
patients with Child’s B disease and active 
bleeding or with MELD 12–18 benefit from 
early pre-emptive TIPSS.
► In secondary prevention of oesophageal 
variceal bleeding, TIPSS can be considered 
where patients rebleed despite combination of 
VBL +NSBB taking into account the severity 
of rebleeding and other complications of portal 
hypertension, with careful patient selection 
to minimise hepatic encephalopathy (weak 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
Further large controlled trials are required to 
investigate the role of TIPSS as first-line therapy 
in secondary prevention (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
► In secondary prevention of gastric variceal 
bleeding, TIPSS ±embolisation is recommended 
where patients rebleed despite endoscopic 
injection therapy (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence). TIPSS ±embolisationcan also be considered in selected patients 
with large or multiple gastric varices as first-line 
therapy in secondary prevention (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
► In patients with bleeding from ectopic varices 
refractory to local and pharmacological therapies, TIPSS usually with embolisation is 
suggested (weak recommendation, low-quality 
evidence).
► In patients with bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) refractory to NSBB and 
iron therapy, TIPSS may be considered (weak 
recommendation, low-quality evidence).
Recommendations: TIPSS for ascites
► In patients who are eligible for liver transplantation, TIPSS for ascites should only be 
undertaken after discussion with the regional 
transplant centre (strong recommendation, 
very low quality evidence).
► In selected patients with refractory or recurrent ascites, we recommend insertion of TIPSS 
provided there are no contraindications to 
the procedure (strong recommendation, high 
quality evidence).
► In addition to the standard TIPSS contraindications, patients who may not benefit from 
TIPSS for ascites include those with bilirubin 
>50µm/L and platelets<75×109
, pre-existing 
encephalopathy, active infection, severe cardiac 
failure or severe pulmonary hypertension 
(strong recommendation, moderate quality 
evidence).

Guidelines
Recommendation: TIPSS for hydrothorax
► Selected patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax may 
be considered for TIPSS insertion. (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
Recommendation: TIPSS for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)
► Although, renal function has been observed to improve 
following TIPSS, TIPSS for HRS (type 1 and type 2) remains 
experimental (weak recommendation, very low level of 
evidence).
Recommendations: TIPSS for Budd–Chiari syndrome
► It is recommended that all patients with Budd–Chiari 
syndrome (BCS) are managed in centres of high expertise 
which are either transplant centres or have formal links with 
a liver transplant centre (strong recommendation, very lowquality evidence).
► TIPSS is recommended where patients fail to respond 
to medical therapy with anticoagulation or hepatic vein 
interventions (strong recommendation, moderate- quality 
evidence). TIPSS can be considered where hepatic vein interventions is not technically feasible (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
► Patients with poor prognostic scores (see text), or those 
who do not respond to anticoagulation and radiological 
therapies, have a poor prognosis and should be considered 
for liver transplant assessment (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
Recommendation: prophylactic TIPSS
► There is insufficient data to recommend TIPSS prior to nonhepatic surgery, although in compensated cirrhotic patients 
undergoing curative surgery for cancer there may be a role 
(weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Further 
research is recommended, with the focus on careful patient 
selection.
Recommendation: TIPSS for idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal 
hypertension
► The indications for TIPSS in idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal 
hypertension (INCPH) should be similar to cirrhosis, and 
covered stents are preferred. The selection criteria should 
also be similar to cirrhosis with particular attention to risk 
factors for hepatic encephalopathy (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
Recommendations: TIPSS in portal vein thrombosis
► Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) should not be considered an 
absolute contraindication to TIPSS placement, although the 
presence of cavernoma is associated with a significantly high 
failure rate (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
► Patients with acute PVT should be discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, very low-quality 
evidence).
► Cirrhotic patients with PVT and variceal bleeding should be 
discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
Recommendations: TIPSS and hepatic encephalopathy
► TIPSS may worsen or precipitate encephalopathy. Patients 
undergoing elective TIPSS should be screened for covert and 
overt encephalopathy (strong recommendation, high-quality 
evidence).
► Screening should ideally be at least two of the following: 
psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) testing, 
Stroop testing, Critical Flicker Frequency and Spectral 
Enhanced or quantative EEG (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
► The presence of covert hepatic encephalopathy is a relative 
contraindication to elective TIPSS (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
► Although age >65 is not an absolute contraindication, it 
might increase the risk of encephalopathy and should be 
taken into account when deciding the eligibility for elective 
TIPSS (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).
► Patients who develop encephalopathy following a TIPSS 
should be managed according to standard guidelines, but 
if encephalopathy continues, consideration should be given 
to shunt reduction, embolisation or occlusion (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
Recommendations: cardiac assessments
► A cardiac history, examination, 12-lead ECG and N-Terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) should be 
undertaken in all patients undergoing elective TIPSS insertion (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
Further cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram +/-cardiology 
consultation) should be undertaken before elective TIPSS 
if any of these are abnormal (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
► Elective TIPSS is not recommended in patients with 
severe left ventricular dysfunction or severe pulmonary 
hypertension (strong recommendation, moderate- quality 
evidence).
► Echocardiogram in acute variceal haemorrhage may be inaccurate and should not delay an emergency, potential lifesaving TIPSS insertion (strong recommendation, low-quality 
evidence).
Recommendation: nutritional assessment
► Patients referred for elective TIPSS insertion should undergo 
a detailed nutritional and functional assessment (weak 
recommendation, low-level evidence).
Recommendations: renal function
► In patients with significant intrinsic renal disease (stage 4/5), 
elective TIPSS is not recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
► TIPSS can be considered in patients presenting acutely with 
variceal bleeding and renal dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low-level evidence).
Recommendations: preparation for TIPSS
► All patients considered for elective TIPSS should be discussed 
in a multidisciplinary team, and be reviewed by both hepatology and interventional radiology in the clinical setting as 
part of the work-up (strong recommendation, very low level 
of evidence).
► Cross-sectional imaging is recommended prior to TIPSS 
where possible (strong recommendation, very low level of 
evidence).
► Informed consent should follow established principles 
(strong recommendation, high level of evidence).
► General anaesthetic or deep sedation using propofol is 
recommended for all procedures (strong recommendation, 
very low level of evidence).

Tripathi D, et al. Gut 2020;69:1173–1192. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2019-320221 1175
Guidelines
► Routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended 
with the exception of TIPSS for variceal bleeding, 
complex procedures or where there is previous biliary 
instrumentation (strong recommendation, very low level 
of evidence).
► The decision to correct any coagulopathy should be based 
on thromboelastography since INR is often unreliable in 
liver disease (strong recommendation, moderate level of 
evidence). Platelet transfusion can be considered if platelet 
count <50×105
/L (weak recommendation, very low level 
of evidence).
Recommendations: TIPSS procedure
► All TIPSS should be performed using PTFE-covered stents as 
they are associated with better patency rates than bare stents 
(strong recommendation, high level of evidence).
► The portal pressure gradient should be measured as that 
between the portal pressure and IVC, and measured pre- and 
post-stent deployment (strong recommendation, moderate 
level of evidence)
► The portal pressure gradient should be reduced to 
<12mmHg or by>=20% of baseline in the case of variceal 
bleeding (strong recommendation, high level of evidence). 
For other indications, further reductions in the portal pressure gradient needs to balance efficacy with risk of hepatic 
encephalopathy, and should be individualised (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
► The role of embolisation with TIPSS is not clear and decisions should be individualised and based on cross-sectional 
imaging and portography showing large varices when portal 
pressure reduction alone may not be sufficient (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
► A Doppler ultrasound is recommended a week after TIPSS 
implantation in patients with prothrombotic conditions, 
and in other patients where TIPSS dysfunction is suspected 
(strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Doppler 
ultrasound is recommended at 6–12 monthly intervals or 
6-monthly in patients undergoing HCC surveillance (weak 
recommendation, low level of evidence).
► Patients with prothrombotic conditions such as BCS require 
follow-up with Doppler ultrasound with careful consideration for TIPSS venography as determined by the interventional radiologist. There is no indication for routine 
venography in other patients (strong recommendation, low 
level of evidence).
Recommendations: service delivery and development
► Units offering a TIPSS service should be performing a 
minimum of 10 cases per annum (strong recommendation, 
moderate quality of evidence).
► It is recommended that centres offering complex TIPSS 
(thrombosed hepatic or portal veins or in transplant recipients) should perform at least 20 cases per annum (strong 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
► Patients being referred for emergency TIPSS should be prioritised for transfer (strong recommendation, low quality of 
evidence).
Research recommendations
► The role of early or pre-emptive TIPSS in acute variceal 
bleeding in view of the conflicting evidence and uncertainly 
about patient selection. Large multi-centre RCTs would be 
the gold standard.
► The role of TIPSS as first-line therapy in secondary prevention against variceal rebleeding.
► A national registry or database to help inform us about the 
results in a variety of indications and evaluate current service 
provision.
► Nutrition in patients undergoing TIPSS. Patients’ nutrition 
can significantly improve following TIPSS for ascites but 
cachexia may be associated with more encephalopathy.
► TIPSS in the setting of chronic renal impairment and hepatorenal syndrome.
► Cardiac evaluation prior to TIPSS due to the limitations of 
the present methods. The role of NT-proBNP is not clear.
► Haemodynamic goals following TIPSS. Further study around 
the ideal reduction of portal pressure gradient both for 
variceal haemorrhage and the treatment of refractory ascites.
► The role of TIPSS in hepatic hydrothorax, and further study 
comparing TIPSS with standard of care is recommended.
► The role of prophylactic TIPSS prior to major non-hepatic 
surgery due to a lack of good-quality data on whether it 
improves outcome.
► Role of TIPSS in patients with ectopic varices to allow access 
to the portal system as well as reducing portal pressure.
Pat ient summary
This guideline has been produced under the auspices of the 
British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) with endorsements 
from the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) 
and British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR). It is 
aimed at teams of health professionals who refer patients to 
specialists for a TIPSS. This patient summary aims to summarise 
the key recommendations.
TIPSS is a non-surgical treatment for patients with liver disease 
and higher than normal pressures in the liver and surrounding 
blood vessels (known as portal hypertension), in particular the 
portal vein and hepatic veins. It involves a specialist (doctor) 
known as an interventional radiologist or hepatologist placing 
a bespoke metal tube (stent) inside the liver by inserting a wire 
through the jugular vein in the neck, then threading and guiding 
it (using X-ray) through the liver. The procedure is normally 
done under general anaesthetic or deep sedation, and takes 
approximately 90–120min in uncomplicated cases. In the UK 
there are more than 35 hospitals that offer this procedure.
The main reasons (“indications”) for performing a TIPSS are 
to treat bleeding from swollen veins in the gullet called varices 
(potentially an emergency) and excessive fluid build-up in the 
abdomen or stomach known as ascites. Other rarer indications 
involve diseases affecting the blood vessels leading out of (Budd 
Chiari syndrome) or into the liver (portal vein thrombosis).
The main complications of the procedure include bleeding, 
infection, heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure, fever, 
damage to blood vessels and bile ducts, and occur in less than 5% 
of patients. Long-term complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) affects one-third of patients. HE is a condition 
where the liver is not able to get rid of unwanted toxic chemicals such as ammonia (produced in the gut). Patients can become 
confused, drowsy or may fall into a coma or worse. In most cases 
HE responds positively to simple measures and medical therapy, 
but in a few patients it may be necessary to block off the TIPSS. 
It is very important that the patient is made fully aware of all 
these complications where possible.
To minimise the risk of complications, the following preparation/preparatory work is recommended:
a. Specialised scans to look at the liver and surrounding vessels.

Guidelines
b. Liver and kidney function tests.
c. Tests of the blood’s ability to clot.
d. Heart function tests.
e. A nutrition/dietary assessment.
f. Tests to judge the risk of a patient developing HE after the 
TIPSS procedure.
It is also possible to modify the procedure to reduce the risks 
of developing HE following TIPSS by, for instance, reducing the 
diameter of stent.
We recommend TIPSS (where there is good evidence to 
support its use) is performed in the following clinical situations:
a. Acute variceal bleeding unresponsive to other treatments 
such as endoscopy (camera examination of the gullet) with 
banding of varices and drug therapy (so-called standard of 
care). Patients who have very severe liver disease are unlikely 
to benefit since they will not tolerate the physical insult of a 
TIPSS procedure.
b. In a non-emergency situation to prevent further re-bleeding 
from varices where patients have bled again despite standard 
of care endoscopic and medical therapies.
c. In selected patients to prevent the build-up of fluid in the 
stomach (ascites) or lung (hydrothorax) where there is recurrent fluid build-up despite other treatments which includes 
insertion of a drain or use of water tablets. Although TIPSS is 
effective in reducing fluid build-up, there is no clear evidence 
of better survival and impact on quality of life is not clear.
d. To treat selected patients with BCS in specialist hospitals 
which also offer liver transplantation.
e. To treat portal vein thrombosis in selected patients in specialist hospitals performing a large number of TIPSS.
The role of TIPSS in the following clinical situations is not 
clear:
a. To prevent variceal rebleeding in selected patients at the time 
of first presenting with an acute bleeding episode after satisfactory stabilisation with standard of care. This is also known 
as “early” or “pre-emptive” where TIPSS is performed within 72hours of an acute variceal bleed in a stable patient who 
has stopped bleeding. There is conflicting data on whether 
it is effective, and which patients stand to benefit from this 
option.
b. In patients with long-standing kidney disease.
c. In a very rare condition called idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal 
hypertension where there is disease in the small blood vessels 
in the liver.
d. TIPSS as a preventative therapy in patients with portal hypertension being considered for surgery outside of the liver 
such as operations for bowel cancer.
Introduction
This document is the first such guideline produced by the BSG in 
collaboration with BASL and BSIR. There have been a number 
of recent advances, in the absence of an up-to-date UK-based 
guidance on TIPSS aimed at referring teams. The key aim of 
this guidance is to promote dialogue between referring teams 
and specialists at regional TIPSS centres. Along the referral 
pathway, members of the multidisciplinary team comprising 
gastroenterologists, hepatologists and interventional radiologists play equally important roles in decisions relating to clinical 
indications for TIPSS, patient selection and procedural aspects 
of TIPSS. The latest evidence would suggest that TIPSS has an 
increasing role in the management of acute variceal bleeding and 
ascites. However, recent publications report on major challenges 
with regards to available resources and knowledge of referring 
teams in implementing any changes in practice suggested by the 
evidence, particularly with regards to acute variceal bleeding.1
There is increasing importance of careful patient selection, 
and we believe that this requires particular attention in light of 
emerging data. We are also aware of rarer indications for TIPSS, 
which may have more of a place in routine practice.2–4 Unless 
stated otherwise, all sections are with reference to covered 
TIPSS.
Guideline development
These guidelines were drafted following discussions within 
the liver section of the BSG and acceptance by the proposal 
by the CSSC. The GDG comprised clinicians from hepatology, 
gastroenterology and interventional radiology with nursing and 
patient representation. There followed division of sections to be 
researched by designated authors as agreed by the GDG, and 
an exhaustive literature review. There was reference to previously published practice guidelines and positions statements, and 
guideline quality was assessed using the AGREE tool.
A preliminary guideline document was drafted by the authors 
following discussion and where necessary voting by members of 
the GDG. The draft guidelines were submitted for review by 
CSSC, then BSG council members. The guidelines were then 
reviewed by the BSIR and BASL. Finally, full peer review was 
undertaken by reviewers selected by the editorial board of Gut.
Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II
instrument
The AGREE II instrument is an accepted method for appraising 
clinical guidelines.5
 Six domains are listed:
Scope and purpose
The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other 
healthcare professionals managing patients with portal hypertensive complications of liver disease who are being considered for a TIPSS. The last international guidance on TIPSS was 
published by the American Association for the Study of Liver 
Diseases (AASLD) in 2009. Other guidelines exist incorporating 
some advice on the use of TIPSS,6
 but a dedicated guideline 
focusing on referral pathways for TIPSS has not been published 
recently. Important developments are covered in depth due to 
the potential impact on clinical practice. The guidelines are 
primarily aimed at the management of adult patients
Guideline development group membership and stakeholder 
involvement
Membership of the group includes gastroenterologists, hepatologists and interventional radiologists with nursing and patient 
representation. The guideline has been reviewed and ratified by 
the BSIR and BASL.
Rigour of development
The published literature has been searched using Pubmed, 
Medline, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane database between 
April 2018 and October 2019. The GDG met through a series of 
teleconferences and meetings in that time.
In accordance with the BSG advice on production of guidelines, the GDG applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) system. 
Strength of recommendation was strong, or weak.7
 Where 
the recommendation was unanimous a ‘strong’ recommendation was used, and where the decision was by majority and the 
recommendation was moderate or weak, ‘we suggest’ was used.

Guidelines
Table 1 Levels of evidence
Certainty Interpretation
Very low The true effect is probably markedly different from the estimated effect
Low The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect
Moderate The authors believe that the true effect is probably close to the 
estimated effect
High The authors have a lot of confidence that the true effect is similar to 
the estimated effect
Our grading of evidence was based on four level of evidence 
and the strength of our recommendation (strong, moderate or 
weak). (table 1)
Areas of disagreement about the recommendation grade were 
subjected to discussion and, if necessary, voting by members of 
the guidelines group. Where possible, the health benefits, side 
effects and risks of recommendations have been discussed. The 
guidelines will be subject to peer review after submission for 
consideration of publication in Gut.
Clarity and presentation
Recommendations are intended to be specific to particular situations and patient groups: where necessary, different options are 
listed. Key recommendations are linked to discussion threads on 
a discussion forum hosted on the BSG website.
Applicability
Where necessary, we have discussed organisational changes that 
may be needed in order to apply recommendations. We have 
attempted to identify key criteria for monitoring and audit 
purposes.
Editorial independence and conflict of interest
Guideline group members have declared any conflicts of interest.
History of TIPSS
The idea of TIPSS originated from animal studies exploring 
the transjugular route for imaging the biliary tree. The inadvertent portal vein puncture that occurred led Josef Rosch to 
consider this route as a potential way of decompressing the 
portal vein. In 1969 he discussed the potential of a radiological portacaval shunt.8 9 Early efforts at TIPSS were disappointing with poor primary patency of 2 weeks at most in
animal models.10 Further developments in the late 1970s with 
balloon angioplasty improved secondary patency rates.11 The 
first clinical application of TIPSS in humans was in 1982 when 
Colapinto created a balloon dilated intrahepatic porto-sytemic
shunt,11 in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. Clinical efficacy remained poor with high mortality from variceal 
rebleeding due to poor patency, until the introduction of the 
expandable 10 mm Palmaz stents later in the decade which 
offered much improved long-term patency in animal models.12
The first clinical application of TIPSS using expandable metal 
stents was in 1988 by Martin Rossle and Joerg Richter and 
colleagues from Freiburg who used Palmaz stents in a 9 mm
channel.13 These early procedures lasted on average 8 hours
and indeed the Freiberg programme was stopped briefly but 
recommenced in 1990 when Jean-Marc Perarnau introduced 
ultrasound guided portal vein puncture, dramatically reducing 
the procedure time. Seminal papers from the same group and 
from San Francisco heralded the clinical introduction of TIPSS.
Further clinical indications followed with TIPSS being used 
for ascites. However, the limitations of bare stents, namely 
shunt insufficiency became increasingly apparent. The introduction of bespoke PTFE-covered stents which featured a bileresistant coating and covered the entire tract greatly improved 
shunt patency.14 with subsequent reduced need for shunt interventions. The indications for TIPSS thus became broarder with 
the use of TIPSS in Budd Chiari syndrome.4
Indications for TIPSS
TIPSS for variceal bleeding
The place of rescue TIPSS in the management of patients with 
active variceal bleeding refractory to endoscopic therapy is 
established despite the lack of RCTs.15–17 A recent large observational study of salvage TIPSS showed that pre-TIPSS intensive care unit stay was associated with poor outcomes.18 The 
authors commented on the futility of salvage TIPSS in patients 
with Child-Pugh score (CPS) >13. The role for TIPSS in the 
secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is more debatable. 
When comparing bare TIPSS with endoscopic therapy, TIPSS 
results in reduced rebleeding, but increased hepatic encephalopathy and no difference in survival.19 Recent RCTs of TIPSS 
compared with endoscopic therapy in combination with drug 
therapy again show that variceal rebleeding is reduced with 
TIPSS.20–22 In a trial of TIPSS vs HVPG response guided drug 
therapy there was reduced rebleeding with TIPSS but this 
difference was not so marked in HVPG responders.20 This trial 
also showed that beyond 6 weeks there was no difference in 
rebleeding or mortality in the two arms. Hepatic encephalopathy was increased in two trials,20 21 although in one trial there 
was no difference in long-term hepatic encephalopathy when 
TIPSS was compared with VBL and NSBB.21 Another trial of 
TIPSS vs VBL plus NSBB in patients with cirrhotic portal vein 
thrombosis showed no difference in hepatic encephalopathy.22
This trial is notable for a high rate of recanalisation in the TIPSS 
arm (95% vs 70%) despite a significant number of patients 
having occlusion of the main portal vein and cavernoma. In all 
these trials there was no difference in survival, which may be 
related to the minimal impact of variceal rebleeding and TIPSS 
on survival after the acute bleeding episode, in contrast to early 
TIPSS as discussed below.20–24 TIPSS has been shown to be more 
effective than tissue adhesives in preventing variceal rebleeding 
in patients with gastric varices, with no differences in survival or 
complications in a RCT.25 The role of adjunctive variceal embolisation with TIPSS is not clear due to heterogeneity of studies 
with regards to the use of bare or covered stents and study methodology, and further controlled studies with covered stents are 
required.26
The concept that placement of a TIPSS early after endoscopic control of the index variceal bleed was first published by 
Monescillo et al using HVPG >20mmHg to select patients for
early TIPSS within 24hours of index variceal bleed. The trial
demonstrated better outcomes with improved survival in the 
early TIPSS arm compared with standard of care.27 However, 
only bare stents were used and standard of care did not reflect 
current practice. This was followed by the trial by Garcia-Pagan 
et al which reported better 12-month transplant-free survival in
the early TIPSS group in Child's C patients or Child's B patients 
actively bleeding at the time of endoscopy ((86% vs 61%, 
P=0.001; ARR, 25%; 95%CI, 2 to 48; NNT, 4.0 patients; 
95%CI, 2.1 to 50.0).28 The definition of ‘early’ was within 
72hours of endoscopically controlling the bleed. The standard of

were included. This was followed by a retrospective post-RCT
surveillance study by the same group screening 659 patients of 
whom 584 were excluded.29 Again they found an 86% 12-month
survival but only a trend to improvement in survival compared 
with endoscopy and drug therapy.29 A recent RCT from a single 
centre in China of early TIPSS (n=86, TIPSS within 72hours
of index endoscopy) vs standard of care (n=46) reported better 
transplant-free survival at 6 weeks and 1 year (HR 0·50, 95%CI
0·25 to 0·98; P=0·04) and improved control of bleeding or 
rebleeding with early TIPSS (HR 0·26 (95% CI 0·12 to 0·55; 
P<0·0001).30 There was no difference in the incidence of hepatic 
encephalopathy. The benefit was seen in all groups regardless of 
active bleeding or stage of liver disease. It is important to note 
that all patients with Child’s B and C disease were included 
irrespective of active bleeding, and that 75% of patients had 
chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection (33% HBV-DNA negative). 
Therefore, antiviral therapy could have influenced outcomes in 
addition to TIPSS, and the difference in predominant aetiology 
would suggest the results may not be applicable to the developed 
world. Furthermore, endoscopic sclerotherapy was used in more 
than 5% of patients, which is not in keeping with current international guidelines where VBL is recommended.31 32 A RCT from 
the UK of early TIPSS in 58 patients with Child-Pugh score ≥8, 
published in abstract form, showed no difference in survival (HR 
1.154 (95%CI 0.3289 to 3.422); P 0.79) nor rebleeding regardless of severity of liver disease or active bleeding .33 The 1-year
transplant-free survival in the control arm was significantly better
than in the 2010 study (76% vs 61%),28 suggesting improvements in overall care of patients with acute variceal bleeding in 
the past decade, and extrapolation of results from the 2010 study 
to the present time needs careful consideration. It is clear from 
these RCTs that rescue TIPSS, necessary in the 10%–31% of the 
control arm due to refractory rebleeding, was associated with 
very poor outcomes.
There have been a number of retrospective and prospective 
audits with variable results.1 34–37 The French study reported 
better outcomes with early TIPSS but only 6.7% of those eligible 
for early TIPSS had this undertaken and this group tended to 
have less severe liver disease and it was the liver disease severity 
which correlated with survival rather than early TIPSS.1
 One 
of the major challenges with early TIPSS was found to be the 
logistical issue of arranging a procedure as an ‘emergency’ in 
a stable non-bleeding patient, even in centres with keen multidisciplinary teams. The study also showed that some clinicians 
were not convinced that early TIPSS would be beneficial for 
their patients. Recent data has led to some debate regarding the 
inclusion criteria for early TIPSS.1 36–39 While Child’s C disease 
has been shown consistently to correlate with improved survival 
following early TIPSS, this has not been the case for Child’s B 
patients with active bleeding.1 36–39 A recent large observational 
study from China showed that patients with Child’s B disease 
only obtain benefit from early TIPSS with regards to 1-year 
survival if they had active bleeding. However, the findings 
must be interpreted with caution in light of the intraobserver 
variability and heterogeneity of reporting active bleeding.39
Furthermore, patients with Child’s A disease were also included. 
Thus, the latter criteria is controversial and further controlled 
studies are necessary to confirm the utility of this criteria in 
selecting patients for early TIPSS. A recent observational study 
also showed that patients with a MELD score of ≥19 are likely 
to benefit from early TIPSS,38 a finding confirmed by Lv and 
colleagues.39
A systematic review of two RCTs and two observational studies 
comparing early TIPSS with standard of care showed reduced 
mortality with early TIPSS (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.83, 
P=0.02) with moderate heterogeneity.36 There was a significant 
reduction in rebleeding with early TIPSS and no difference in 
hepatic encephalopathy. However, the authors concluded that 
further study was required to identify factors associated with 
poor prognosis after early TIPSS. Moreover, the recent RCTs by 
Lv et al and Dunne et al were not included.30 33
It is not clear from these studies if there is a maximal threshold 
of severity of liver disease beyond which there is no benefit from 
early TIPSS. In conclusion, the data to support universal adoption of early TIPSS in all high-risk groups currently is inadequate. A multi-centre trial collecting large numbers of patients is 
a research priority.
Ectopic variceal bleeding can be challenging to manage. The 
evidence for TIPSS in the management of bleeding ectopic 
varices is based on case series.40–45 Earlier reports showed excellent results for initial haemostasis, although rebleeding occurred 
in between 18%–42% of patients despite a patent shunt, leading 
the authors to recommend adjunctive measures such as coil 
embolisation or thrombin injections.40–44 The largest multicentre 
study of 53 patients found that TIPSS was a good option for 
those patients with stomal varices in particular.45 Covered stents 
were used in 85% of patients. Rebleeding occurred in up to 32% 
of patients and was related to MELD score, sites other than 
enterostomy and previous local therapy. Rebleeding was noted 
to be 50% in those with bleeding duodenal varices. An interesting observation was that neither post-TIPSS portal pressure 
gradient (PPG) at a threshold of 12mm Hg nor coil emoblisation 
influenced rebleeding rates, although the numbers were small.
The evidence for TIPSS in the management of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is limited to case reports and small 
case series.46–48 The severity of liver disease, the presence of 
oesophageal varices and endoscopic therapy for oesophageal 
varices have been reported to influence the incidence of PHG.49
TIPSS has been found to be successful in improving the appearances of PHG and reducing transfusion requirements in patients 
refractory to conservative therapies with NSBB and iron replacement.46–48 It is important to differentiate PHG from gastric antral 
vascular ectasia (GAVE). GAVE has characteristic endoscopic 
appearances and can co-exist with PHG.50 51 The management 
of clinically significant bleeding from GAVE is challenging and 
options include medical therapies such as tranexamic acid, and 
endoscopic therapies such as argon plasma coagulation, band 
ligation and radiofrequency ablation.51–53 In refractory cases, 
surgical antrectomy can be considered in selected patients. TIPSS 
does not have a role in the management of bleeding solely from 
GAVE, although it could be considered where there is co-existing PHG.
Figure 1 is a summary of the recommendations.
Recommendations: TIPSS for variceal bleeding
► In patients who have gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding 
refractory to endoscopic and drug therapy as defined by 
Baveno 6 critera,32 covered TIPSS is recommended (strong 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Salvage 
TIPSS is not recommended where the Child-Pugh score is 
>13 (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
► In patients who have Child’s C disease (C10-13) or MELD 
≥19, and bleeding from oesophageal varices or GOV1 and

or pre-emptive TIPSS should be considered within 72hours 
of a variceal bleed where local resources allow (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). However, large

multi-centre RCTs are necessary to determine whether 
patients with Child’s B disease and active bleeding or with 
MELD 12–18 benefit from early pre-emptive TIPSS.
► In secondary prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding, 
TIPSS can be considered where patients rebleed despite 
the combination of VBL +NSBB taking into account the 
severity of rebleeding and other complications of portal 
hypertension, with careful patient selection to minimise 
hepatic encephalopathy (weak recommendation, moderatequality evidence). Further large controlled trials are required 
to investigate the role of TIPSS as first-line therapy in 
secondary prevention (strong recommendation, low quality 
of evidence).
► In secondary prevention of gastric variceal bleeding, TIPSS 
±embolisation is recommended where patients rebleed 
despite endoscopic injection therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). TIPSS ±embolisationcan 
also be considered in selected patients with large or multiple 
gastric varices as first-line therapy in secondary prevention 
(weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
► In patients with bleeding from ectopic varices refractory 
to local and pharmacological therapies, TIPSS usually with 
embolisation is suggested (weak recommendation, lowquality evidence).
► In patients with bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) refractory to NSBB and iron therapy, TIPSS 
may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality 
evidence).
TIPSS for ascites, hepatic hydrothorax and hepatorenal syndrome
TIPSS for ascites
The initial randomised studies of TIPSS vs large-volume paracentesis (LVP) for patients with refractory and/or recurrent 
ascites published between 1996–2004 came to varying conclusions with regard to survival.54–58 However, these studies used 
relatively outmoded approaches including bare-metal stents 
and suboptimal approaches to patient selection. These studies 
generally excluded patients with more severe liver disease such 
as those with high bilirubin and INR, significant encephalopathy 
and renal failure. Two more recent randomised studies published 
in 2011 and 2017 both reported improved survival with TIPSS 
.
59 60 It should be noted that the largest study recruited 109 
patients,57 with the majority including fewer than 65 patients.
Several meta-analyses concluded that TIPSS led to better 
ascites control at the cost of increased encephalopathy.61–68
Importantly, some reported a higher transplant-free survival 
with TIPSS.
The most recent meta-analysis was published by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2016 and 
concluded that TIPSS is better at ascites control and improves 
transplant-free survival, with less renal failure, but more encephalopathy.68 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and quality of 
life were similar. NICE also commented that all these patients 
should be considered for liver transplantation and noted that 
there was a wide variation in UK practice. They were concerned 
that many patients were not being offered TIPSS (see section on 
TIPSS service).
Covered stents appear to have better outcomes including 
survival, when used for treating refractory ascites. Two retrospective studies comparing bare vs covered stents reported improved 
survival +/-ascites control with covered stents.69 70 A further 
retrospective case-control study of 150 patients with propensity 
score analysis reported improved survival with covered TIPSS.71
In this context it is interesting that the most recent randomised 
study from France in 2017 compared TIPSS (using a covered 
stent) vs LVP in recurrent ascites, and reported improved 
transplant-free survival and similar encephalopathy with 
TIPSS.59 It should be noted that this study took the four centres 
7 years to recruit 62 patients.
In contrast to the situation for variceal bleeding, the 
optimum target PPG when placing TIPSS for refractory ascites 
remains unclear. With regard to encephalopathy, the earlier 
TIPSS studies had described significant encephalopathy with 
bare-metal stents, however a much lower incidence of encephalopathy with 8 mm PTFE-covered TIPSS has been reported 
when used to treat variceal bleeding .20 72 Whether this can be 
extrapolated to the situation when TIPSS is used for refractory ascites is unclear. It should be noted that a randomised 
study comparing 8 mm vs 10 mm covered TIPSS for refractory 
ascites had to be stopped early after the results in the first 45 
patients revealed worse ascites control with 8 mm stents.73 A

Figure 2 Summary of recommendations for TIPSS in recurrent or 
refractory ascites.
10 mm- or 8 mm-covered TIPSS for refractory ascites reported 
higher post-TIPSS PPG and greater need for long-term paracentesis with 8 mm stents, with similar encephalopathy.
74 In 
addition, a recent report from the German TIPSS registry on 
185 patients, most of whom had TIPSS for refractory ascites, 
described prolonged survival with 8 mm vs 10 mm stents.75
Therefore, the optimal diameter of covered TIPSS stents for 
this indication remains unclear.
The MELD score was initially developed to predict survival 
post-TIPSS for variceal rebleeding or refractory ascites, then 
extended to predict survival in various liver disease patient 
groups.76 77 Some studies and authors have suggested TIPSS 
should not be undertaken based on a high (eg ≥18) MELD 
score, however the role of MELD in patient selection remains 
unclear.78 Gaba et al compared various scores including MELD 
and CPS in the prediction of outcome after TIPSS and found 
that CPS had the best overall capability at predicting mortality 
when TIPSS is used for ascites.79 In addition, Bureau et al have 
proposed the use of simple laboratory parameters (bilirubin 
<50umol/L and platelets>75×109
) to predict 1-year survival 
following TIPSS for refractory ascites.80 Further studies on the 
use of these criteria are required.
Three recent guidelines recommend TIPSS in the management of refractory or recurrent ascites.6 49 68 The EASL guidelines also suggested useful parameters to identify higher-risk 
patients with more advanced liver disease who would not 
benefit from TIPSS.49 These include bilirubin >50µmol and 
platelets<75×109
, current encephalopathy, active infection, 
progressive renal failure, severe systolic or diastolic dysfunction, 
or pulmonary hypertension. Many guidelines and studies have 
recommended that once a patient is being considered for TIPSS 
in the context of ascites, liver transplantation should also be 
considered at that stage for appropriate patients.
Figure 2 is a summary of the recommendations.
Recommendations: TIPSS for ascites
► In patients who are eligible for liver transplantation, TIPSS 
for ascites should only be undertaken after discussion with 
the regional transplant centre (strong recommendation, very 
low-quality evidence).
► In selected patients with refractory or recurrent ascites, 
we recommend insertion of TIPSS provided there are no 
contraindications to the procedure (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
► In addition to the standard TIPSS contraindications, patients 
who may not benefit from TIPSS for ascites include those 
with bilirubin >50µm/L and platelets<75×109
, pre-existing 
encephalopathy, active infection, severe cardiac failure or 
severe pulmonary hypertension (strong recommendation, 
moderate- quality evidence).
TIPSS for hepatic hydrothorax
Hepatic hydrothorax is an uncommon complication of endstage liver disease, affecting approximately 10% of individuals.81
Refractory hepatic hydrothorax is defined by a failure to control 
symptomatic fluid accumulation through optimisation of sodium 
intake and diuretic treatment. Management is challenging: 
thoracocentesis is recommended where there is respiratory 
compromise but where repeated intervention is required, TIPSS 
has been suggested. The published evidence supporting this 
approach is comprised of a number of case reports and six case 
series including 208 participants.82–87 These studies have been 
pooled in a meta-analysis.88 It is worth noting that the mortality 
estimates are different from those of the individual studies, 
and interpretation of the pooled estimates must take this into 
account. Good clinical responses are observed in a substantial 
proportion of patients treated with TIPSS and patient selection 
is critical to that. These studies indicate a probability of complete 
response of the hydrothorax of between 42% and 79%.82–87
However, there was appreciable early mortality reported in all 
but one of these series.85 There is clearly a risk of early mortality 
related to TIPSS for hepatic hydrothorax that appears related to 
progressive liver disease. The studies reported were done more 
than a decade ago and only one includes patients treated with 
PTFE covered TIPSS.82 Furthermore, since there are no studies 
comparing TIPSS with standard treatment, consequently, there is 
no available information on the impact of TIPSS on comparative 
survival in this population. Improvements in patient selection 
for TIPSS in general are likely to have reduced the reported early 
post-TIPSS mortality in patients with hydrothorax but there are 
no published data to support this.
Recommendation: TIPSS for hydrothorax
► Selected patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax may 
be considered for TIPSS insertion. (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
TIPSS for hepatorenal syndrome
The severity of liver disease usually precludes TIPSS in patients 
with severe portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction (type 
1 and type 2HRS). The poor residual liver function does not 
cope with the reduced portal inflow, with an increased risk of 
hepatic encephalopathy, and a potential unmasking of cirrhotic 
cardiomyopathy. Although, renal function has been observed 
to improve following TIPSS, TIPSS for HRS remains experimental.56 89 90 A recent systematic review demonstrates the 
paucity of good-quality data, and heterogeneity with regards to 
patient selection and outcomes.91 Furthermore, in type 2HRS

Guidelines
patients with more severe renal dysfunction were excluded. The 
rate of hepatic encephalopathy approached 50% which is significantly higher than for other indications. Finally, most studies 
used bare stents. Liver transplantation should be considered.
Recommendation: TIPSS for hepatorenal syndrome
► Although, renal function has been observed to improve 
following TIPSS, TIPSS for HRS (type 1 and type 2) remains 
experimental (weak recommendation, very low level of 
evidence).
TIPSS and Budd–Chiari syndrome
BCS is defined as obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow 
from the level of the sinusoids to the inferior vena cava. In most 
cases, BCS is primary, but secondary causes include tumour invasion or large hepatic cysts.92 In primary BCS, a procoagulant 
condition such as JAK2 positive myeloproliferative neoplasm is 
present in nearly 50% of patients.93 The stepwise management 
includes anticoagulation in all patients, and hepatic vein interventions in symptomatic BCS.92 The timing of TIPSS has been 
debated, but in the authors’ opinion it is indicated when hepatic 
vein interventions is unsuccessful or not possible. TIPSS may also 
be considered where there is an acute presentation and in smallvessel BCS. Where there is acute liver failure, patients may be 
eligible for super urgent liver transplantation. Due to the rarity 
of BCS no RCTs exist of TIPSS for BCS. It is important to note 
that BCS can present in a different way with more involvement 
of IVC in countries such as India and China.95, 96 Furthermore, 
the management strategies are more heterogeneous with regards 
to anticoagulation.
Numerous observational studies demonstrate very good 
long-term outcomes despite TIPSS being technically more challenging.4 93–104 The largest series demonstrate very good symptom 
resolution exceeding 70%, and excellent long-term outcomes 
with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70%. Primary patency rates 
are improved with the use of PTFE-covered stents. A direct intrahepatic porto-caval shunts (DIPS) procedure is also an alternative to the classic TIPSS where all hepatic veins are occluded. A 
tract is created by direct puncture from the IVC through the liver 
to the portal vein.105 The clinical outcomes following DIPS are 
similar to classical TIPSS.105 TIPSS is associated with the risk of 
hepatic encephalopathy which had been reported in up to 15% 
of patients.93 The risk of hepatic encephalopathy is considerably 
less with HV interventions which is more physiological. Recent 
data from a multicentre EU study102 suggests that Rotterdam 
Class III patients should also be considered for a TIPSS at an 
early stage, confirming previous data.106 This requires further 
validation. The BCS-TIPS score >7 has been consistently shown 
to predict poor outcomes in several studies, and such patients 
should be considered for liver transplantation.29 93 102 It is essential all patients with BCS are managed in specialised centres with 
an experienced multidisciplinary team comprising hepatology, 
interventional radiology and haematology, with access to liver 
transplantation which has a good outcome in selected cases.107 108
Recommendations: TIPSS for Budd–Chiari syndrome
► It is recommended that all patients with BCS are managed in 
centres of high expertise which are either transplant centres 
or have formal links with a liver transplant centre (strong 
recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
► TIPSS is recommended where patients fail to respond 
to medical therapy with anticoagulation or hepatic vein 
interventions (strong recommendation, moderate-quality 
evidence). TIPSS can be considered where hepatic vein interventions is not technically feasible (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
► Patients with poor prognostic scores (see text), or those 
who do not respond to anticoagulation and radiological 
therapies, have a poor prognosis and should be considered 
for liver transplant assessment (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
TIPSS prior to non-hepatic surgery in patients with portal 
hypertension (prophylactic TIPSS)
A rare indication for TIPSS is prior to elective non-hepatic 
surgery in patients with portal hypertension. This can reduce 
the potential deleterious effects of portal hypertension such 
as abdominal varices which can increase the risk of bleeding. 
There is a marked paucity of data. A recent systematic review 
studied all fully published studies.3
 All publications are retrospective in nature. The largest series was with 18 patients with 
many case reports with just one patient. There is also a marked 
heterogeneity with regards to patient selection based on the 
severity of liver disease and criteria for successful TIPSS prior 
to surgery. However, in almost all cases, curative surgery was 
performed and there did not appear to be increased mortality 
above what would be expected. Possibly mortality was lower 
than in those patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension 
without a TIPSS. However, there is a real risk of publication 
bias, and all data must be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, 
a recent retrospective study comparing 66 patient with TIPSS 
prior to abdominal surgery (predominantly colorectal surgery) 
to 68 patients without a TIPSS pre-surgery showed no differences in post-operative complications and mortality.109 A retrospective study of patients with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal 
hypertension (INCPH) undergoing non-hepatic surgery did 
not find that portal decompressive procedures prior to surgery 
affected outcomes, although the sample size was small.110 A 
prospective study showed the value of HVPG in predicting 
outcomes in cirrhotic patients undergoing non-hepatic surgery, 
with no patient having HVPG <10mmHg developing decompensation.111 The American Gastroenterology Association does 
not recommend routine TIPSS prior to surgical procedures in 
patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.112 Therefore, in 
view of the lack of evidence, this indication for TIPSS has to be 
carefully balanced against that of the risk of TIPSS itself.
Recommendation: prophylactic TIPSS
► There is insufficient data to recommend TIPSS prior to nonhepatic surgery, although in compensated cirrhotic patients 
undergoing curative surgery for cancer there may be a role 
(weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Further 
research is recommended, with the focus on careful patient 
selection.
TIPSS and idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
INCPH or porto-sinusoidal vascular liver disease113 is a rare 
cause of intrahepatic portal hypertension. Its diagnostic criteria 
have been described previously, and rests on liver histology 
which shows an absence of cirrhosis and the presence of subtle 
lesions such as hepatoportal sclerosis or nodular regenerative hyperplasia.114 There are only six published observational 
studies on the utility of TIPSS in INCPH.2 115–119 The largest 
of these from China compared patients with INCPH (n=76) 
with a matched control group of cirrhotic patients (n=76) over 
a median follow-up of 34 months. The indication for TIPSS was

variceal bleeding in all cases. Another study included a cohort 
of 41 patients from seven EU centres followed up over a mean 
of 27 months. In this study 80% of patients had a covered stent. 
The third study of 25 patients from a single centre in France 
extended over a mean follow-up of 39 months.118 The fourth 
study included 11 patients from two EU centres over a mean 
follow-up of 112 months.116 Two other studies have fewer than 
10 patients.115 117
The main observations are of overall good clinical outcomes 
with good control of ascites and 5-year survival of 60%–89%. 
The rate of hepatic encephalopathy was high in most of these 
studies at more than 35%.2 114 116–118 The study by Lv et al 
showed lower mortality (12% vs 26%) and hepatic encephalopathy (32% vs 14%) in the INCPH group compared with cirrhotic 
patients.119 Ascites, malignancy, immunological disorders and 
female sex were associated with mortality. Bare stents had higher 
bleeding and shunt dysfunction. It should be noted that portal 
vein thrombosis was higher in the cirrhotic group, and 8mm 
stents were used which could explain the low rates of encephalopathy. Having extra-hepatic co-morbidities, ascites as an indication and creatinine predicted worse survival, but no risk factor 
was identified after multivariate analysis in one of the largest of 
these studies.2
 The risk of procedural bleeding seemed rather 
high in the study by Bissonnette et al, and authors suggested this 
may be due to increased arterialisation of the liver.2
 The risk of 
associated splanchnic vein thrombosis was 39%, although this 
was not associated with mortality or rebleeding. Conversely, the 
presence of portal vein cavernoma led to increased morbidity in 
the study by Regnault et al.118
Recommendation: TIPSS for idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal 
hypertension
► The indications for TIPSS in INCPH should be similar to 
cirrhosis, and covered stents are preferred. The selection 
criteria should also be similar to cirrhosis with particular 
attention to risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy (weak 
recommendation, low-quality evidence).
TIPSS in portal vein thrombosis
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has traditionally been seen as a 
contraindication to TIPSS placement. However, there have been 
a number of reports and small series where transjugular shunts 
have been successfully placed, from 1993 onwards.120 Indications have included patients with acute portal vein thrombosis 
and ischaemic bowel,121 cirrhotic patients with PVT and variceal 
bleeding,122 and patients with PVT where the degree of thrombosis is felt to compromise liver transplantation.123 These studies 
have been heterogeneous, including cirrhotic patients, patients 
with acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis,124 those with 
partial or complete thrombosis, and the presence or absence of 
cavernous transformation. Scoring systems that provide some 
objective analysis of the burden of thrombosis exist, but are not 
routinely used, further compounding the difficulty in assessing 
the role of TIPSS in portal vein thrombosis.125 126
A meta-analysis identified a 60%–99%technical success rate 
(pooled 86%), and likely reflects a significant reporting bias, 
with a 25% incidence of hepatic encephalopathy.127 Another 
systematic review reported similar findings, although heterogeneity was noted due to cavernous transformation.128 Thrombolysis was associated with more complications,
As mentioned earlier, there has been a single clinical 
randomised trial22 in a population of cirrhotic patients that had 
previous bleeding, that identified a lower re-bleeding rate in the 
TIPSS group compared with the group that received banding 
ligation plus propranolol ((15%vs 45% at 1year, 25% vs 50% 
at 2 years). There was no significant difference in survival or 
encephalopathy. No published image scoring system was used.
Technical aspects which may facilitate success are reported and 
include: visibility of intra-hepatic PVT branches on US;124 transplenic/transhepatic “rendezvous” technique;129 local thrombolysis;130 and transjugular local thrombolysis and portal pressure 
guided stent placement.121
The publication bias skews the ability to make firm recommendation. Clearly at the advanced end of the technical spectrum of TIPSS placement, the absence of clear factors predicting 
success (apart from the visibility of intrahepatic portal vein 
radicles) limits referral criteria. At the same time, the therapeutic void between anticoagulation and major gut resection in 
patients with acute splanchnic vein thrombosis, and the ability to 
successfully convert patients into transplant candidates, means 
that units prepared to attempt these procedures should not be 
discouraged. Furthermore, the advance of digital image transfer 
platforms means that patients with PVT can be discussed with 
these centres without the patient automatically needing transfer.
Recommendations: TIPSS in portal vein thrombosis
► PVT should not be considered an absolute contraindication 
to TIPSS placement, although the presence of cavernoma 
is associated with a significantly high failure rate (strong 
recommendation, high-quality evidence).
► Patients with acute PVT should be discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, very low-quality 
evidence).
► Cirrhotic patients with PVT and variceal bleeding should be 
discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
Pat ient selection
Figure 3 is a summary of the key aspects of patient selection.
Hepatic encephalopathy
Pre-TIPSS assessment of encephalopathy
As with all portosystemic shunts, the major complication postTIPSS is HE. This is particularly heartbreaking for the relatives/
carers, who will be the first to notice changes in cognition. 
Phrases such as “I no longer recognise my husband/wife” reflect 
a poor outcome, especially when the TIPSS has been a palliative 
procedure in someone with recurrent ascites. The incidence of 
encephalopathy has been quoted as high as 55% and is dependent on patient and attainment factors: assiduous searching for 
encephalopathy will identify a higher incidence.
Every effort needs to be made to identify those at risk of postTIPSS HE, especially in the elective setting. This is harder to do 
when the TIPSS is being considered in an emergency, and under 
these circumstances, a history may be all that is available, for 
example, a history of debilitating encephalopathy in someone 
with an acute variceal bleed is a contraindication to a TIPSS 
unless there is a major competing portosystemic shunt that can 
be embolised.
Patient-related factors perhaps predictably include: age, 
severity of liver disease, history of preceding encephalopathy131
and size of shunt. A Child-Pugh score equal or greater than 10 
was a proposed cut-off point. The recently recognised additional 
risk factor of diabetes may well reflect altered renal handling of 
ammonia.132 This latter consideration is increasingly important,

are in patients who have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
and who are diabetic.
While these simple clinical markers are easy to obtain, most 
elective patients will have well-preserved liver function. The 
major advance has been the recognition of the clinical disorder 
“covert” or subclinical encephalopathy. This is a disorder in 
which patients with chronic liver disease exhibit specific, reversible, quantifiable, neuropsychological or electroencephalographic abnormalities in the absence of clinically obvious mental 
or neurologic defects.133 The critical next step is the identification that covert hepatic encephalopathy predicts the development of overt hepatic encephalopathty.134 This has driven the 
search for accurate techniques that identify covert encephalopathy, and parameters which predict the development of overt 
encephalopathy post-TIPSS.
EEG has been one of the most utilised investigations prior 
to patients undergoing TIPSS procedure but it has limitations. 
Visual EEG alone will underevaluate the risk of encephalopathy135 and the use of spectral analysis using the P3-4 lead has 
been shown to be superior to visual assessment alone.136 A value 
of less than 8hz is abnormal.
The Stroop test is a downloadable application that has shown 
sensitivity in diagnosis covert encephalopathy.
137 It is cheap and 
easily reproducible. It is underused in clinical practice.
Critical flicker frequency (CFF) involves the patient observing 
a flickering image. The frequency at which the image “fuses” 
from flickering to a constant is defined as the CFF, and patients 
with encephalopathy will have a lower value compared with a 
normal individual. The absence of a pre-TIPSS history of overt 
hepatic encephalopathy and a CCF value of >39Hz had a 100% 
negative predictive value for post-TIPSS overt encephalopathy.138
Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) psychometric testing is a well validated tool for establishing the presence of encephalopathy, both covert and overt.139 This technique 
has been studied prospectively, is readily available and utility 
confirmed.140 A patient with refractory ascites with a normal 
PHES score has a 90% probability of remaining free of HE 
post-procedure.138
Diagnostic guidelines have recommended that a diagnosis 
of covert encephalopathy requires at least two abnormal 
psychometric tests or an abnormal PHES, and, wherever possible 
a quantitative EEG.141 Patients who have evidence of covert 
encephalopathy should not undergo a TIPSS unless additional 
techniques are employed.
Post-TIPSS encephalopathy management
Despite attempts to carefully select patients for TIPSS, HE 
remains the most common complication following TIPSS, 
affecting almost one-third of patients. The management of postTIPSS HE is challenging and is medical or radiological or a 
combination of both.
Basic encephalopathy management should be followed. 
Biochemical abnormalities should be corrected, night sedation 
ceased and lactulose prescribed in order to achieve two bowel 
movements per day. Proton-pump inhibitors should be stopped. 
If HE continues, rifaxamin should be started. If HE continues 
then options in escalating order are competing shunt embolisation, TIPSS stent reduction and TIPSS occlusion. The latter 
is necessary in approximately 5% of patients with post-TIPSS 
HE.142
Recommendations: TIPSS and hepatic encephalopathy
► TIPSS may worsen or precipitate encephalopathy. Patients 
undergoing elective TIPSS should be screened for covert and 
overt encephalopathy (strong recommendation, high-quality 
evidence).
► Screening should ideally be at least two of the following: 
PHES testing, Stroop testing, CFF and Spectral Enhanced or 
quantative EEG (strong recommendation, moderate-quality 
evidence).
► The presence of covert hepatic encephalopathy is a relative 
contraindication to elective TIPSS (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence).
► Although age >65 is not an absolute contraindication, it 
might increase the risk of encephalopathy and should be 
taken into account when deciding the eligibility for elective 
TIPSS (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).
► Patients who develop encephalopathy following a TIPSS 
should be managed according to standard guidelines, but

Guidelines
if encephalopathy continues, consideration should be given 
to shunt reduction, embolisation or occlusion (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
Cardiac assessment
There is a growing awareness that the presence of cirrhosis is 
associated with significant cardiovascular abnormalities.143 This 
is commonly termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and comprises a 
constellation of cardiac abnormalities, which include myocardial hypertrophy, electrophysiological abnormalities (ie, 
prolonged QT), decreased ventricular compliance and normal 
systolic function at rest, but incompetence when under physical or pharmacological stress.144 145 The assessment of cardiovascular risk pre-TIPSS is therefore important, as shunting a 
significant volume of the portal to the central circulation, the 
cardiac output and right atrial pressures increase by 50% and 
100%, respectively. Despite these physiological changes, the 
clinical importance of underlying cardiac cardiomyopathy in 
patients undergoing TIPSS remains a subject of considerable 
debate. While some argue that cardiac (in particular diastolic) 
dysfunction predicts worse outcomes after TIPSS,146–149 others 
are more sceptical, as overt cardiac failure is very rarely 
reported.150–153
Of particular interest in the field is diastolic dysfunction, as the 
incidence approaches 40% in patients awaiting a TIPSS.146 154
Three prospective studies (n=33–101) reported that diastolic 
dysfunction is related to post-TIPSS mortality within 1year.
146–148
It must be noted that these studies solely utilised E/A (early 
maximal ventricular filling velocity/atrial maximal ventricular filling velocity) ratio <1.0to define diastolic dysfunction 
(limited by its dependence on cardiac loading conditions and 
age), lacked an independent echocardiographer and also that 
only 3/144 reported deaths were attributed to cardiac failure. In 
contrast, despite pre-TIPSS rates of diastolic dysfunction ranging 
from 30%–45%, five more recent studies (two retrospective 
studies, n=27–117; three prospective studies, n=15–883) found 
no relationship between diastolic dysfunction and post-TIPSS 
survival or cardiac failure.150–153 155 Although retrospective in 
design, Modha et al reported that post-TIPSS symptomatic heart 
disease is rare (8/883; 0.9%) and even when present there was 
no difference in mortality compared with controls (6.3 vs 12.0% 
at 30days, respectively).153 In contrast, a recent prospective 
French study of 100 patients undergoing TIPSS and a detailed 
cardiac assessment, highlighted that 20% were diagnosed with 
cardiac failure (requiring hospitalisation) within 1year of TIPSS 
of who 5/20 died.149 It is noteworthy that 55% had a preceding 
established diagnosis of heart disease (including moderate-severe 
aortic stenosis).149 There is a large degree of heterogeneity in 
these studies, and with the exception of the recent French 
study,149 the majority excluded patients with a history of IHD 
and CVS risk factors, thereby limiting the applicability to the 
findings to higher-risk individuals.
Serum N-Terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) has been shown to predict heart failure in patients 
with cirrhosis156 157 and peri-operative cardiac events in noncardiac surgery.158 NT-proBNP has also been shown to correlate 
with severity of liver disease and QTc interval in cirrhosis.159 160
However, there is conflicting data in the setting of TIPSS of 
whether NT-proBNP is predictive of cardiac events following 
TIPSS.149 152 In the largest afore-mentioned prospective study of 
100 patients, NT-proBNP was found to be predictive of cardiac 
decompensation after TIPSS, but not mortality.149 The authors 
recommended that a NT-proBNP level of less than 125pg/mL 
enabled identification pre-TIPSS of those patients not at risk of 
cardiac decompensation.149
The decision to perform a TIPSS in a high-risk patient, should 
be reached by a team of a gastroenterologist/hepatologist, interventional radiologist, anaesthetists/intensivists and where appropriate a transplant physician. However, there remains limited 
data to support the utility of echocardiogram in the absence of 
a positive cardiac history, examination or ECG (prolonged QT 
interval) and NT-proBNP) prior to TIPSS. The utility of alternative echocardiographic methods of assessing cardiac function such as left ventricular global longitudinal strain remains a 
research area.161
Recommendations: cardiac assessments
► A cardiac history, examination, 12-lead ECG and N-Terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) should be 
undertaken in all patients undergoing elective TIPSS insertion (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
Further cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram +/-cardiology 
consultation) should be undertaken before elective TIPSS 
if any of these are abnormal (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence).
► Elective TIPSS is not recommended in patients with 
severe left ventricular dysfunction or severe pulmonary 
hypertension (strong recommendation, moderate- quality 
evidence).
► Echocardiogram in acute variceal haemorrhage may be inaccurate and should not delay an emergency, potential lifesaving TIPSS insertion (strong recommendation, low-quality 
evidence).
Nutritional assessment
Over the past 5 years, our understanding of the impact of sarcopenia and malnutrition on survival in patients with cirrhosis has 
exponentially grown. As many as 20% and 50% of patients with 
compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, respectively, have 
sarcopenia. This, in turn, accelerates progression to liver failure 
and increases the rates of infections, ascites and encephalopathy. 
Recent international guidelines recommend that all patients with 
cirrhosis should undergo a rapid nutritional screen and in those 
deemed at risk of malnutrition, a more detailed expert dietetic 
assessment (ie, anthropometry, sarcopenia measures) should be 
undertaken.162 However, very few studies have focused on the 
impact of sarcopenia and malnutrition on the clinical outcomes 
of TIPSS. To date, a prospective study of 46 patients with 
cirrhosis from Italy has shown that sarcopenia (on CT) is independently associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy post-TIPSS.163 The authors hypothesised that this maybe 
be attributed to reduced processing of ammonia.163 In addition, 
a European study of 116 patients with radiological measures of 
sarcopenia pre and post-TIPSS, highlighted that persistence of 
sarcopenia post-TIPSS was associated with reduced effectiveness 
of TIPSS (especially with ascites) and a higher risk of liver failure 
and mortality.163 However, the study included patients where 
the indication for TIPSS was both variceal bleeding and ascites. 
Another study published in abstract form of patients undergoing 
TIPSS for ascites reported that the presence of sarcopenia preTIPSS did not impact on outcomes post-TIPSS.164 Even though 
very few studies exist, these data suggest the need for prospective studies on the role of nutritional assessment both pre- and 
post-TIPSS.

Rapidly progressive liver failure
Severe or uncontrolled hepatic encephalopathy
Uncontrolled systemic infection or sepsis
Unrelieved biliary obstruction
Polycystic liver disease (though successful cases reports exist)
Extensive primary or metastatic hepatic malignancy
Recommendation: nutritional assessment
► Patients referred for elective TIPSS insertion should undergo 
a detailed nutritional and functional assessment (weak 
recommendation, low-level evidence).
Renal function
Differentiating portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction 
from intrinsic kidney disease, and acute kidney injury from 
stable chronic renal disease, is probably important. However, 
there is limited supporting evidence at present: the RCTs of 
TIPSS largely excluded patients with intrinsic kidney disease or 
significant renal dysfunction, with a mean baseline creatinine of 
70–124 µmol/l.27 28 39 54–60 165–169
In portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction, reflecting 
more advanced disease, a higher serum creatinine is predictive of 
post-TIPSS mortality.77 170 In portal hypertension-related renal 
dysfunction and intrinsic kidney disease, a higher baseline serum 
creatinine may be associated with a lesser natriuretic effect of 
TIPSS171 172 and an increased frequency of the development 
of hepatic encephalopathy.173 The presence of severe intrinsic 
kidney disease (stage 4/5) may lead to an unacceptably high rate 
of severe encephalopathy.174
The indication for TIPSS may also be relevant. In rescue TIPSS, 
renal dysfunction is often acute and the key determinant of the 
risk benefit ratio is multiorgan dysfunction. However, in elective 
TIPSS for refractory ascites, suitability for a life-prolonging liver 
transplant and quality of life should be the focus.
Recommendations: renal function
► In patients with significant intrinsic renal disease (stage 4/5), 
elective TIPSS is not recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
► TIPSS can be considered in patients presenting acutely with 
variceal bleeding and renal dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low-level evidence).
Procedural details
The indications and pre-implantation work-up of a patient prior 
to TIPSS is discussed elsewhere. Elective patients should be 
discussed in a multidisciplinary forum. Implantation of a TIPSS is 
one of the most technically challenging interventional radiological procedures, and early dialogue with an interventional radiologist is essential. The interventional radiologist should ideally 
review elective patients in a clinical setting and be intimately 
involved with the decisions relating to suitability of a TIPSS. 
Emergency TIPSS (eg, uncontrolled variceal bleeding) will still 
naturally involve a discussion, which may also include issues of 
futility. TIPSS in patients with advanced liver disease, encephalopathy and multi-organ failure (especially aspiration) does 
not usually alter patient outcomes. All risk should be measured 
against clinical need and anticipated survival benefit.
Preparation for TIPSS
Imaging
Contrast-enhanced CT of liver (portal venous phase) or contrastenhanced MRI of liver is recommended for assessing suitability 
and planning the TIPSS procedure. In certain circumstances such 
as significant renal impairment, ultrasound can be used for this 
purpose, particularly if performed by the TIPSS operator. In the 
emergency situation, if the patient is well enough to be transferred to the interventional radiology suite, then they are well 
enough to undergo CT.
Consent
Consent should follow established principles and local procedures observed to ensure the WHO checklist completed. The 
PARQ mnemonic (Procedure, Alternatives, Risks, Questions) 
provides a useful framework. The procedure itself is quoted as 
having a 5% major complication rate including a 2% incidence 
of procedure-related death, although these figures included data 
from early series and reflected the emergency situation in which 
TIPSS was first deployed. Patients should be informed explicitly of the risk of encephalopathy, and intra-abdominal bleeding 
related to capsular puncture. The American Society of Interventional Radiology Standards of Practice Committee provides an 
evidence base for these discussions.175 Consent should also be 
obtained if paracentesis or transjugular biopsy is also planned 
during the same procedure.
Sedation
It is the authors’ opinion that the TIPSS procedure should be 
performed either under general anaesthetic or with propofolbased deep sedation. The procedure itself may be painful, 
particularly during the time of intrahepatic balloon dilatation. 
General anaesthetic, allows controlled breath holds which facilitate portal vein cannulation, and in the emergency situation the 
airway is protected should variceal bleeding occur. While some 
high-volume units have successfully used conscious sedation for 
many years, there was general agreement that this was not an 
ideal environment to be performing this procedure
Therefore, all patients should be prepared for general anaesthetic as per local policy. All patients should have up-to-date 
biochemistry (renal and liver function), haematology (full blood 
count and INR) and an ECG. Patients should be hydrated to 
facilitate central venous puncture, and to minimise the risk 
of contrast nephropathy. There is no role for pre-procedure 
N-acetyl cysteine or bicarbonate.176
In patients with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis 
should be considered either pre- or peri-procedure in order to 
facilitate extubation.
Antibiotics
Routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended. If a 
long/complex procedure is anticipated (when inadvertent biliary 
puncture may occur) or previous biliary surgery, then prophylactic antibiotics can be given according to local antibiotic policy 
to cover gram negative bacteria. for example, piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftriaxone IV for 48hours.177
Blood products
As INR is often inaccurate, thromboelastography (TEG) can 
inform whether FFP is required. Consider platelet transfusion if 
platelet count <50×105

 angiography and C-arm CT can be useful. A large angiography suite suitable for general anaesthesia and equipment for 
invasive pressure monitoring is required. Box 1 lists the standard 
equipment
TIPSS technique
A detailed description of the technique is beyond the scope of 
this guideline and can be found elsewhere. The key technical 
element of the procedure is the portal vein puncture. This may 
be facilitated by ultrasound guidance, which has been shown to 
reduce screen time.178 Stent placement should not compromise 
future options for transplantation, and should therefore not 
extend towards splenic/superior mesenteric vein confluence, 
as this disrupts surgical portal vein anastomosis. Stents placed 
near or in the right atrium will likewise seriously compromise 
the caval anastomosis. PTFE-covered stents have been shown 
to reduce the stenosis rate compared with bare stents, and 
are cost effective.179 TIPSS provides access to the splanchnic 
circulation, and allows variceal embolisation. The portal pressure gradient (PPG) is that between the portal pressure and 
IVC pressure, that is, porto-caval gradient. The porto-atrial
gradient can give a false higher PPG and is affected by intraabdominal pressures.180
Mitigation of encephalopathy during the TIPSS procedure
Large-diameter portosystemic shunts are associated with a 
greater risk of HE, so logically a smaller diameter TIPSS stent 
will reduce that risk. Unfortunately, this also runs the risk of not 
achieving adequate portal pressure reduction. The concept was 
investigated in a RCT which compared 8mm stents and 10mm 
stents and was stopped early as the smaller stent diameter was 
associated with less control of complications of the portal hypertension.73 The introduction of controlled expansion stents (with 
a “dial-able" diameter of 8 or 10mm) may allow the operator to 
modulate the encephalopathy rate, but this is not evidence-based.
Allied to the shunt diameter as a determinant of encephalopathy, targeting post-TIPSS portosystemic gradient values of 
<12mmHg,181 may result in the formation of very large shunts 
in patients with high portal pressure, and percentage reductions may be more practical (eg, 20%). Indeed a proposed PSG 
of between 6 and 8mmHg in patients undergoing TIPSS for 
diuretic resistant ascites182 may be too low, especially in a group 
who exhibit more advanced liver disease, and who have a higher 
risk of encephalopathy.
Adjunctive variceal/shunt embolisation
Conceptually, placement of a TIPSS associated with competing 
shunt embolisation should preserve portal blood flow, and hence 
reduce HE. This can be as simple as embolising a bleeding varix 
to the placement of multiple occlusion devices in umbilical veins 
and splenorenal shunts. The evidence supporting this approach 
ab initio is conflicting26 183 184 however, pre-TIPSS cross-sectional 
imaging review should allow procedural planning and encephalopathy mitigation if there is thought to be a significant risk.
Post-operative care
Post-operative right upper quadrant discomfort is common, and 
usually responds to parenteral paracetamol or opiate-based analgesia. Persistent severe pain, particularly when associated with 
haemodynamic compromise, warrants urgent investigation and 
contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
Early Doppler US (within 7 days of implantation) is unreliable,185 but confirmation of TIPSS flow prior to discharge 
is recommended in pro-thrombotic patients (eg, BCS and 
splanchnic vein thrombosis)
Long-term follow up
The majority of patients who undergo TIPSS will have cirrhosis, 
and Doppler studies may be performed at the time of routine 
6-monthly HCC screening where offered. Routine transjugular 
venography is not required unless stent dysfunction is seen on 
Doppler studies, or clinically suspected (eg, recurrent ascites).

Procedural complications
Complications will partially depend on the case mix and the 
data in table 2 is related to uncomplicated TIPSS as above.175
It is established that complication rates and survival are related 
to the number of cases performed by the centre and operators 
independently. It is clear from published data and case series 
that gathering enough data locally to reach any kind of statistical significance over a short period of time is challenging (<5 
years). The complication rates only act as a guide to help inform 
local or ideally networked outcomes. However, if a programme 
is failing to meet expected outcomes then a review of the service 
should take place.
Recommendations: TIPSS procedure
► All TIPSS should be performed using PTFE-covered stents as 
they are associated with better patency rates than bare stents 
(strong recommendation, high level of evidence).
► The portal pressure gradient should be measured as that 
between the portal pressure and IVC, and measured pre- and 
post-stent deployment (strong recommendation, moderate 
level of evidence).
► The portal pressure gradient should be reduced to 
<12mmHg or by>=20% of baseline in the case of variceal 
bleeding (strong recommendation, high level of evidence). 
For other indications, further reductions in the portal pressure gradient needs to balance efficacy with the risk of 
hepatic encephalopathy, and should be individualised (weak 
recommendation, low level of evidence).
► The role of embolisation with TIPSS is not clear and decisions should be individualised and based on cross-sectional 
imaging and portography showing large varices when portal 
pressure reduction alone may not be sufficient (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
► A Doppler ultrasound is recommended a week after TIPSS 
implantation in patients with prothrombotic conditions, 
and in other patients where TIPSS dysfunction is suspected 
(strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Doppler 
ultrasound is recommended at 6–12 monthly intervals or 
6-monthly in patients undergoing HCC surveillance (weak 
recommendation, low level of evidence).
► Patients with prothrombotic conditions such as BCS require 
follow-up with Doppler ultrasound with careful consideration for TIPSS venography as determined by the interventional radiologist. There is no indication for routine 
venography in other patients (strong recommendation, low 
level of evidence).
Service delivery and development
Service provision in the UK
A detailed national audit using data from NHS England and 
utilising the metric of Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) and 
Finished Admission Episodes (FAEs) provides some important 
information in terms of service provision, and service planning. 
The definition of service provision is clearly vital and interpretation may vary from a 24/7 service, a 7/7 service, a 5/7 service 
or a 1/7 service.
The majority of units that indicated they provided a TIPSS 
service performed 11–20 emergency procedures per year. Four 
units reported doing more than 30 emergency procedures per 
year. Additionally, there were units reporting a total number 
of procedures performed (elective and emergency) in a year 
of eight, raising the challenging question of numbers required 
for competency. A recent Canadian publication indicated that 
outcomes improved with units performing a minimum of 10 
procedures per year.186 Furthermore, between 2006–2017, 
there was no clear evidence of an increase in emergency procedures, despite published evidence and recommendations. This 
may reflect a failure of clinical uptake, but may also reflect lack 
of capacity, ie, there is demand but not the ability to transfer 
patients in an emergency to a unit that has the available beds. 
Logically, each hospital should know who its TIPSS provider is, 
and each TIPSS provider should be equipped to deliver on that 
expectation.
Personnel
Each centre will need to staff according to the level of urgency 
they are prepared to undertake. TIPSS may be performed in 
emergency (uncontrolled variceal haemorrhage), urgent (eg, 
controlled but refractory variceal haemorrhage) and elective (eg, 
refractory ascites). table 3 lists the key personnel and their roles.
Pathways and protocols
All centres should have locally agreed guidelines and protocols in place and coordinated between the major stake holders. 
These should be reviewed on a regular basis in light of new and 
emerging data.
M&M and audit
All participants in a TIPSS service should have arrangements, 
either locally or as part of a network, to submit data and 
outcomes to formal morbidity and mortality review and audit. 
These data should be measured against national data if available 
and be open to scrutiny.
Benchmarking
This should form an essential part of M&M and audit. 
Agreed standards of practice are hard to judge given the small 
number of cases performed in most UK centres, and therefore

Guidelines
Table 3
Personnel Description
Interventional radiologists At least two fully trained interventional radiologists or similarly-trained physicians able to carry out TIPSS 
independently and other related procedures such as variceal embolisation. Forming viable networks would be 
advised. Please see section on Networks (https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scn-sof.pdf)
Hepatology Hepatology team used to caring for patients with portal hypertension and its major complications (variceal 
haemorrhage, ascites and encephalopathy etc)
Intensive care Intensivists used to care for patients with portal hypertension and variceal haemorrhage.
Anaesthesia Anaesthetists who are used to working in Interventional radiology suites and are used to dealing with patients 
who may have the complications of portal hypertension (pleural effusions, heart failure, encephalopathy, variceal 
haemorrhage etc).
Key support staff Fully trained interventional support staff including nurses (capable of invasive pressure measurements) and 
radiographers
Other disciplines as necessary Nephrology with access to renal replacement therapy.
Microbiology.
Cardiology assessment.
Liver transplant services (These will not always be locally available but networked communication channels should 
be clearly defined)
Addiction services with pathways clearly defined.

submission of data to a national registry to help inform future 
planning and benchmarking would be ideal (as yet none exist). 
The figures quoted in table 4 are a guide and consideration has 
to be given to the case mix and severity of liver disease being 
treated.175
Suggested outcomes for uncomplicated TIPSS (ie, no portal 
vein thrombosis and patent hepatic veins) is given in table 4.
For complex TIPSS (thrombosed portal or hepatic veins, 
or previous transplant) it is recommended that these are 
performed in centres with >20 cases per annum and given 
the small numbers of outcome data and benchmarking, is 
difficult.187 Further evidence supports the need to ensure that 
centres wishing to start a TIPSS perform at least 10 procedures 
a year, regardless of whether the centre is a teaching hospital 
or not.186
Recommendations: service delivery and development
► Units offering a TIPSS service should be performing a 
minimum of 10 cases per annum (strong recommendation, 
moderate quality of evidence).
► It is recommended that centres offering complex TIPSS 
(thrombosed hepatic or portal veins or in transplant recipients) should perform at least 20 cases per annum (strong 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
► Patients being referred for emergency TIPSS should be prioritised for transfer (strong recommendation, low quality of 
evidence).
Research recommendations
► The role of early or pre-emptive TIPSS in acute variceal 
bleeding in view of the conflicting evidence and uncertainly 
about patient selection. Large multi-centre RCTs would be 
the gold standard.
► The role of TIPSS as first-line therapy in secondary prevention against variceal rebleeding.
► A national registry or database to help inform us about the 
results in a variety of indications and evaluate current service 
provision.
► Nutrition in patients undergoing TIPSS. Patients’ nutrition 
can significantly improve following TIPSS for ascites but 
sarcopenia may be associated with more encephalopathy.
► TIPSS in the setting of chronic renal impairment and hepatorenal syndrome.
► Cardiac evaluation prior to TIPSS due to the limitations of 
the present methods. The role of NT-proBNP is not clear.
► Haemodynamic goals following TIPSS. Further study 
around the ideal reduction of portal pressure gradient both 
for variceal haemorrhage and the treatment of refractory 
ascites.
► The role of TIPSS in hepatic hydrothorax, and further study 
comparing TIPSS with standard of care is recommended.
► The role of prophylactic TIPSS prior to major non-hepatic 
surgery due to a lack of good quality data on whether it 
improves outcome.
► Role of TIPSS in patients with ectopic varices to allow access 
to the portal system as well as reducing portal pressure.
