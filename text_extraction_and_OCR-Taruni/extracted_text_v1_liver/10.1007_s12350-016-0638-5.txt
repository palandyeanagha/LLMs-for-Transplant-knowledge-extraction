Background. DPD scintigraphy has been advocated for imaging cardiac amyloid in ATTR
amyloidosis. PET utilizing 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is the gold standard for imaging
brain amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease. PIB was recently shown to identify cardiac amyloidosis in
both AL and ATTR amyloidosis. In the ATTR population, two types of amyloid fibrils exist, one
containing fragmented and full-length TTR (type A) and the other only full-length TTR (type
B). The aim of this study was to further evaluate PIB-PET in patients with hereditary ATTR
amyloidosis.
Methods. Ten patients with biopsy-proven V30M ATTR amyloidosis and discrete or no signs
of cardiac involvement were included. Patients were grouped according to TTR-fragmentation.
All underwent DPD scintigraphy, echocardiography, and PIB-PET. A left ventricular PIB-retention index (PIB-RI) was established and compared to five normal volunteers.
Results. PIB-RI was increased in all patients (P < 0.001), but was significantly higher in
type B than in type A (0.129 ± 0.041 vs 0.040 ± 0.006 min21
, P = 0.009). Cardiac DPD uptake
was elevated in group A and absent in group B.
Conclusion. PIB-PET, in contrast to DPD scintigraphy, has the potential to specifically
identify cardiac amyloid depositions irrespective of amyloid fibril composition. The heart
appears to be a target organ for amyloid deposition in ATTR amyloidosis. (J Nucl Cardiol

BACKGROUND
Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR) is a
disease where wild-type or mutant TTR assembles into
amyloid. It is a systemic disease that affects mainly the
heart and nervous system.1 Over 100 different diseasecausing mutations in the TTR gene have been identified.2 There is a pronounced variation in the presentation
of the disease, where neuropathy or cardiomyopathy
may dominate, but most mutations have symptoms from
both the heart and nervous system. In addition, being a
systemic disease, gastrointestinal, renal, visual, and
other organ systems can be involved. These phenotypic
variations are in part tied to the disease-causing mutation and probably age at onset, but also to others as yet
unknown factors.3
Proteolysis and fragmentation of TTR appear to
play a central role in the development of TTR cardiomyopathy.4,5 Among patients with ATTR V30M
amyloidosis, the most common TTR mutation in
Europe, two phenotypes are noted: one characterized
by late-onset disease (50 C years of age) and with both
cardiac and neurological manifestations, and the other
by an early-onset disease (\50 years of age) and with
mainly neuropathic manifestation.6 These phenotypes
have been tied to differences in amyloid fibril composition.4,5 Amyloid from patients with late-onset disease
contains both full-length and N-terminal TTR fragments
starting at position 46-52 (Type A fibril pattern),
whereas amyloid of early-onset disease patients typically contains full-length TTR only (Type B fibril
pattern).7 The type B fibril pattern has so far only been
detected in the V30M population and in patients
carrying the rare Y144C mutation. Amyloid deposits
from patients with other mutations or wild-type ATTR
amyloidosis have all contained TTR fragments.8 Until
recently, the only available treatment for ATTR
amyloidosis was liver transplantation. However, subsequent analysis has shown that patients with type B
fibrils, generally early-onset V30M patients had a
substantial better outcome compared with type A
patients, i.e., generally late-onset V30M and nonV30M patients.9 If amyloid fibril composition has any
impact on the efficacy of pharmacological treatment has
so far not been investigated.
There are currently several diagnostic methods
available for detection of ATTR cardiomyopathy.
Despite the emergence of other modalities, echocardiography remains the basis for diagnosis and follow-up.
For the purpose of early detection of ATTR cardiomyopathy, 99mtechnetium-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy is by many
considered the gold standard.10 The exact mechanisms
by which DPD interacts with cardiac amyloid deposits
are not known, neither is it clear why some patients
with AL amyloidosis display DPD uptake and others
do not.
A class of novel tracers, originating from thioflavin
T, has been developed for specific amyloid imaging of
the brain in Alzheimer’s disease using the positron
emission tomography (PET) and is currently regarded as
the non-invasive gold standard for amyloid detection in
the brain.11 Carbon-11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B
(
11C-PIB), the original PET amyloid tracer, should in
theory bind to beta-pleated sheets in general, even
outside the brain. In a small pilot study 11C-PIB PET
showed a high affinity for cardiac amyloid deposits12 in
both light chain amyloidosis (AL) and ATTR amyloidosis. This was reproduced by Lee et al in 22 patients
with AL amyloidosis.13 Another related tracer, 18FFlorbetapir, has similarly been proven to identify cardiac
amyloid deposits with high diagnostic sensitivity,14 and
specific binding to cardiac amyloid has been shown.15
No previous study has investigated amyloid PET-tracer
uptake in ATTR amyloidosis patients with known
amyloid precursor protein; before further evaluation
can be done in larger prospective studies, the impact of
amyloid fibril composition on tracer retention needs to
be investigated.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of
amyloid fibril composition on PET/CT using 11C-PIB in
biopsy-proven ATTRV30M amyloidosis patients, and to
compare the outcome with that obtained by DPD
scintigraphy.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
Patients Selection
Ten patients with genetically and histopathologically
diagnosed neuropathic ATTRV30M amyloidosis were
Journal of Nuclear Cardiology Pilebro et al 241
Volume 25, Number 1;240–8 Positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing Pittsburgh compound B

included in the study. The amyloid fibril type, i.e., type A or B,
had been determined in fat pad biopsy for all patients. Biopsies
were analyzed regarding fibril type according to a standardized
Western blot method.7 We chose to include five patients with
type A and five patients with type B fibrils in the study. In
addition, to enable investigation of the impact of amyloid fibril
type, the patients selected had similar echocardiographic
findings displaying little or mild signs of cardiomyopathy,
and they were of comparable age and had similar disease
duration
Healthy Volunteers
Five healthy subjects without signs or symptoms of
cardiac disease were included (3 males, 2 females, age range
54-75). This cohort was also used as healthy controls in a
previously published study.12
Patient Characteristics
Patients were interviewed and their files were reviewed
for information concerning symptoms, disease duration, cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, known vascular
disease, renal insufficiency), and previous and current treatment for ATTR amyloidosis. The cardiac biomarkers troponin
T and NT-proBNP were analyzed at the clinical chemistry
laboratory of Umea˚ University Hospital, according to routine
practice using a Cobas 8000 machine and troponin T hs STAT
and proBNP II STAT reagents (Roche Scandinavia, Bromma,
Sweden).
PET/CT Procedure
After low-dose CT scanning, a 25-minutes dynamic
emission scan of the heart was started simultaneously with
the intravenous bolus injection of 11C-PIB (6 MBq/kg) using a
Discovery ST PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare). Imaging was
performed in 3-dimensional mode, yielding 47 transaxial
images. All appropriate corrections for scanner normalization,
dead time, decay, scatter, randoms, and attenuation were
applied. Images were reconstructed into time frames of 29
frames (12 9 5, 6 9 10, 4 9 30, 2 9 60, 2 9 120, and 3 9 300
s) using ordered-subset expectation maximization (2 iterations,
21 subsets), with the application of a 5-mm Gaussian filter.
Images consisted of 128 9 128 voxels, with dimensions of
2.34 9 2.34 9 3.27 mm, and a spatial resolution of approximately 7 mm.
11C-PIB PET Image Analysis
The analysis was performed using a dedicated software
(Carimas V2.6, Turku, Finland) as previously described.16
Briefly, the left ventricular wall was outlined semiautomatically and the regional radioactivity from 10 to 15 minutes after
injection was calculated. A small volume of interest was
positioned centrally in the left ventricular (LV) cavity, and a
time-activity curve from 0 to 15 minutes after injection was
integrated to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). An
11C-PIB retention index (RI) was then calculated by dividing
LV wall activity by the AUC and global LV RI values.
Summed PET images from 15 to 25 minutes after injection
were fused with CT to visually confirm cardiac 11C-PIB uptake
(Figure 1). The RI was presented as a parametric polar map
(see Figure 2)
Echocardiography
Patients were investigated with two-dimensional and
Doppler echocardiography using Vivid E9 (GE Medical
systems, Horten, Norway),17,18 and offline analysis was carried
out using Echopac PC version 113 (GE Healthcare). Enddiastolic interventricular septum (IVS) thickness (IVSD) was
measured from parasternal long axis view. From apical fourchamber view, left atrium (LA) volume was measured in endsystole using biplane area-length method and left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using manual biplane
Simpson model. Speckle tracking analysis was performed
using automated function imaging (AFI) for calculation of LV
global longitudinal strain from apical four-, three-, and twochamber views. The mitral annulus and apex were manually
outlined by the use of three index points followed by automatic
definition of the endocardial border, mid-layer, and epicardial
border in each frame throughout the cardiac cycle.19 Reduced
LV global strain was defined as a value C16 %.20
DPD Scintigraphy
All patients were scanned using a hybrid single-photon
emission computerized tomography (SPECT)-CT gamma
camera (Infinia Hawkeye, GE) with a Low Energy High

Resolution collimator after intravenous injection of 740 MBq
of DPD. Whole body planar images were acquired 5 minutes
and 3 hours postinjection in a 256 9 1024 matrix followed by a
cardiac SPECT-CT with a low-dose, non-contrast CT scan.
SPECT acquisition was made with a 128 9 128 matrix size in
30 projections followed by an iterative (OSEM, 3 iterations, 10
subsets) reconstruction with CT-based attenuation correction.
SPECT-CT reconstruction and image fusion were performed
on a GE Xeleris workstation. The CT volume data were
reconstructed into 5 mm slice thickness.
Visual scoring of cardiac retention was made according to
a suggested method11,12 (i.e., score 0, absent cardiac uptake
and normal bone uptake; score 1, mild cardiac uptake, inferior
to bone uptake; score 2, moderate cardiac uptake accompanied
by attenuated bone uptake; score 3, strong cardiac uptake with
mild/absent bone uptake). A score of 1, 2, or 3 was considered
as DPD positive. Two experienced specialists in nuclear
medicine independently performed image analysis. There were
no disagreements.
Endomyocardial Biopsy (EMB)
To validate the PIB-PET findings in patients with type B
amyloid fibril composition, these patients were asked to
volunteer to cardiac tissue sampling. One patient had undergone EMB previously and only one of the remaining four
agreed to the procedure. Biopsies were taken from the right
chamber according to the standard protocol.
Ethics
The study was conducted according to the Helsinki
declaration. All patients had given their written consent. The
central ethical review board in Umea˚ approved all study
procedures.
Statistics
11C-PIB RI was compared among Group A and B and
Healthy Volunteers using a Friedman test. The group means
were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests. Statistical
analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 5.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. There were no significant differences in disease
duration, prevalence of hypertension, or age between
group A and group B. Three patients with type B fibrils
had undergone liver transplant prior to investigation—
one 16 years prior to, and the other two during the year
before the investigation. Three patients were on investigational drug treatment with siRNA (Patirisan,
Alnylam). One patient in the type B group had iatrogenic ATTR amyloidosis, having received a liver from a
patient with ATTR amyloidosis as part of a domino
transplant procedure.21 Two patients with type B fibrils
had cardiac pacemakers -one due to high level AV-block
and the other SA-block; these two patients also hade
renal insufficiency and elevated NT-proBNP (Table 2).
In one patient with type B fibril composition, endomyocardial biopsy had been performed, which was amyloid
positive. None of the patients had undergone cardiac
surgery or had known coronary disease. All imaging was
performed within one year for each patient.
DPD Scintigraphy
None of the patients with type B amyloid fibril
composition had DPD uptake. Of the patients with type
A fibrils, four had grade 2 and one had grade 3 DPD
uptake (Table 2; Figure 1).
Echocardiography
No significant differences were observed between
the two patient groups regarding LV dimensions and
wall thickness or LA size (Table 3). No patient had
increased amounts of pericardial effusion. Seven
patients had increased LV wall thickness (wall thickness
[12 mm). Patients from both subgroups had mainly LV
wall thickening localized to the IVS. One patient

the same absolute color scale with a maximum of 0.1 mLmin-1

(number 9) had predominant apical thickening. In two
patients, increased LV thickness was localized to the
basal part of IVS. Three patients (no 6, 7 and 9) had
reduced LV global longitudinal strain. Reduced strain
was primarily seen in segments with more pronounced
wall thickening.
11C-PIB
All patients, regardless of fibril type, had increased
myocardial PIB uptake compared to healthy volunteers
(P\0.001) (Figure 1). When measuring 11C-PIB RI,
the 11C-PIB uptake was three times lower in patients

with type A fibrils compared to those with type B fibrils
(Table 3, mean 0.040 ± 0.006 vs 0.129 ± 0.041,
P = 0.001). The pattern of 11C-PIB uptake differed
between the two groups. In the type A group, the uptake
was relatively homogenous in all patients, but in the type
B group, uptake was patchy and unevenly distributed
throughout the myocardium in four out of the five
patients (Figure 2).
Endomyocardial Biopsies
One patient (no 9) in the study population had seven
years prior to the study undergone an EMB, which was
positive for amyloid. Only one (no 3) of the remaining
four patients with type B amyloid agreed to the
procedure. In that patient the biopsy showed rich
subendocardial as well as myocardial amyloid deposits,
appearing in part intracellularly (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that ATTR Val30Met
fibrils are of two different variants of which one consists
of full-length TTR (type B) and the other of a mixture of
full-length TTR, and TTR fragments starting around
position 50 (type A).7 Type A and type B deposits have
different histological appearance that includes fibril
morphology, tinctorial properties with Congo red as well

as distribution in the cardiac muscle. It is therefore
interesting that 11C-PIB seems to bind much stronger to
type B than to type A fibrils. Therefore, the quantitative
aspects of 11C-PIB binding to ATTR amyloid might
depend on fibril type, rather than amyloid burden. In
addition to different binding properties of type A and B
fibrils, it is not possible to exclude factors that would
minimize binding access such as fibrotic encapsulation
of amyloid deposits and reduced capillary patency in the
proximity of amyloid.
This reasoning holds true also for DPD. Absent
DPD uptake in type B hearts suggests that DPD either
does not have a binding site on type B fibrils or
binding occurs related to a secondary phenomenon that
is not present in cardiac type B. The exact binding site
for DPD is not known, but since DPD is widely used
for imaging of bone mineralization, the most likely
binding is associated with microcalcification. A case
study using 18F-sodium fluoride and PET, which is a
specific marker of cardiac microcalcification,22 was
recently shown to identify TTR amyloid,23 thus supporting that microcalcification occurs in TTR. The
current study indicates that not only radiolabeled
ligands but also therapeutic drugs can be expected to
exert different binding properties in the context of
amyloid fibril subtype.
A positive DPD scintigraphy is strongly associated
with future development of amyloid cardiomyopathy.
DPD scintigraphy in our study was positive only in
patients with type A fibrils. 11C-PIB retention was three
times higher in patients with type B fibril, compared to
the group with type A fibrils. This suggests that the
magnitude of 11C-PIB retention does not necessarily
imply cardiomyopatic development. Echocardiographic
abnormalities in patients with type B fibrils might in part
be ascribed by other factors. In our study, 2/3 type B
patients with increased LV wall thickness had long
standing renal insufficiency and hypertension. Our study
further suggests that the level and pattern of 11C-PIB and
DPD retention are strongly associated with fibrillar type,
indicating that the combination of 11C-PIB PET and
DPD scintigraphy might be used for accurate subclassification of the ATTR fibril type.
The 11C-PIB retention that we measured was
compared to a small group of healthy volunteers with
no signs or history of cardiac pathology. Although these
individuals most likely have no cardiac amyloid depositions, the PIB RI was not equal to zero. This is related
to the low resolution of the PET scanner (5-6 mm),
causing spill-over of activity from the blood pool into
the myocardial region of interest. Visually, as shown in
Figure 1, the absence of retention in the healthy volunteers is obvious in comparison to all patients. False
positive results have so far not been reported, but larger
cohorts are still needed to calculate the true sensitivity
and specificity of 11C-PIB in cardiac amyloidosis.
The presence of amyloid depositions in endomyocardial biopsies from patients with positive DPD
scintigraphy has been used to secure the diagnosis of
cardiac amyloidosis.24 Biopsy proof of absence of
amyloid deposition in cardiac tissues from patients with
negative DPD scintigraphy has not been provided. It is,
however, well known that amyloid deposition can be
detected in tissues from well-functioning and macroscopically normal appearing organs such as the GI-tract
or adipose tissue. 11C-PIB PET has been used extensively in detection of brain amyloid since 2002. The
incidental finding of increased 11C-PIB uptake in cortical brain areas of clinically non-demented subjects
initially caused concern about the specificity of 11C-PIB
for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. However, the
majority of these subjects developed clinically
detectable dementia within a follow-up period of a few
years. The finding of abnormal PIB uptake in the brain
of patients with mild cognitive dysfunction is now
considered prodromal Alzheimer’s disease and is a
validated inclusion criteria in drug trials.25 Thus, our
findings of positive 11C-PIBzz PET examination of
echocardiographically normal appearing hearts are not
unexpected and could prove clinically valuable. Early
detection of the disease before irreversible cardiac or
neurological damage has occurred is important and the
long-term outcome of novel pharmacological therapies
will be depending on the severity of organ damage at the
time of diagnosis. Sampling errors using biopsies from
any organ are not uncommon and direct cardiac biopsies
are often avoided until the clinical presentation is
manifest. Based on the preliminary results of our study,
cardiac 11C-PIB PET might be a sensitive marker of
early systemic ATTR amyloidosis. It would therefore be
interesting to utilize 11C-PIB PET in diagnosis of
disease onset in mutation carriers with follow-up.
Limitations
The study was performed on a small number of
patients and controls. In addition, EMB was only
performed on two patients, which, however, were
positive. A full compartmental analysis of PIB-PET
data was not performed, and might have contributed
additional insights into binding of PIB to myocardial
amyloid. In brain studies of Alzheimer’s patients,
kinetics were best described using models of reversible
binding but did not add to the clinical interpretation.
Due to the logistical reasons and high prevalence of
pacemaker carriers, cardiac MRI is not performed
routinely at our center and none of the patients underwent such investigation in conjunction with the study.

Summary
The present study evaluated two different aspects of
molecular imaging in a well-characterized cohort of
patients with a certain diagnosis of ATTR V30M. All
patients had myocardial PIB uptake on PET scan,
regardless of fibril type or DPD uptake, but with
significantly higher PIB retention in patients with fulllength fibril type, generally associated with less cardiac
involvement. Myocardial DPD uptake, on the other
hand, was only elevated in patients with the fragmented
fibril type.
Since 11C-PIB RI appears influenced by factors
other than mere amyloid burden, its use for amyloid
quantification in clinical practice might be limited. 11CPIB PET and perfusion studies may be useful to further
study amyloid depositions in vivo and their impact on
tissue metabolism. It would be interesting to follow
disease progression and also to measure the effect of
medical treatment on cardiac amyloid deposition and
tissue metabolism. This is attractive since it can be
applied to pacemaker-treated patients, where cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging is unsuitable.
NEW KNOWLEDGE GAINED
C-PIB PET appears to be a very sensitive method
for detecting cardiac ATTR amyloid deposits even in
patients with primarily neurological disease11 and normal echocardiographic appearance. DPD scintigraphy
appears to only detect ATTR deposits containing fragmented TTR, which previous studies have shown to
cause more severe clinical heart disease.
