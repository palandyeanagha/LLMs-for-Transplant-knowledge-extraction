Abstract
Background: Improved survival among HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has focused attention on
AIDS-related cancers including Kaposi sarcoma (KS). However, the effect of KS on response to ART is not well-described in
Southern Africa. We assessed the effect of KS on survival and immunologic and virologic treatment responses at 6- and 12-
months after initiation of ART.
Methods: We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of HIV-infected adults initiating ART in South Africa.
Differences in mortality between those with and without KS at ART initiation were estimated with Cox proportional hazard
models. Log-binomial models were used to assess differences in CD4 count response and HIV virologic suppression within a
year of initiating treatment.
Results: Between January 2001–January 2008, 13,847 HIV-infected adults initiated ART at the study clinics. Those with KS at
ART initiation (n = 247, 2%) were similar to those without KS (n = 13600,98%) with respect to age (35 vs. 35yrs), presenting
CD4 count (74 vs. 85cells/mm3
) and proportion on TB treatment (37% vs. 30%). In models adjusted for sex, baseline CD4
count, age, treatment site, tuberculosis and year of ART initiation, KS patients were over three times more likely to have died
at any time after ART initiation (hazard ratio[HR]: 3.62; 95% CI: 2.71–4.84) than those without KS. The increased risk was
highest within the first year on ART (HR: 4.05; 95% CI: 2.95–5.55) and attenuated thereafter (HR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.08–4.89).
Those with KS also gained, on average, 29 fewer CD4 cells (95% CI: 7–52cells/mm3
) and were less likely to increase their CD4
count by 50 cells from baseline (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 0.99–2.06) within the first 6-months of treatment.
Conclusions: HIV-infected adults presenting with KS have increased risk of mortality even after initiation of ART with the
greatest risk in the first year. Among those who survive the first year on therapy, subjects with KS demonstrated a poorer
immunologic response to ART than those without KS.

Introduction
Immunosuppression and co-infections with certain oncogenic
viruses appears to increase the risk of some cancers in HIVinfected patients [1]. Infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus
(KSHV) is a precondition for the development of Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS), and the seroprevalence of KSHV infection is high
in both HIV-infected and uninfected populations, particularly in
Africa [2]. Consequently, there has been a sharp increase in the
incidence of KS since the advent of the HIV pandemic, and KS is
a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in subSaharan Africa [3–5]. Today KS is one of the most common
cancers in Africa and is the most common tumour in HIV-infected
individuals [4,6]. In South Africa, the incidence of KS rose
dramatically as the HIV epidemic escalated (increasing threefold
between 1988 and 1996) [7]. KS has been found to be associated
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e64392

with advanced disease and high mortality among patients
attending primary care clinics [8].
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that just
over 5 million HIV-1-infected people were receiving antiretroviral
therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa by the end of 2010, for an
estimated coverage of patients eligible for ART of 56% [9].
Combination ART has been used to successfully treat early stage
KS for some time [10–12], achieving regression of KS lesions
[13,14] and successfully reducing KS-related mortality [13,15]. In
particular, suppression of replication of HIV has been associated
with remission of KS [16]. In the United Kingdom, survival at 5
years among patients diagnosed with KS in the era of ART was
estimated to be 98.4% in patients who had CD4 cell counts above
150 cells/mm3 and with skin or lymph node involvement only and
no other symptomatic disease [17]. At the other end of the
spectrum, 5-year survival was estimated at 8.4% in patients with a
history of AIDS, more severe immunosuppression, more advanced
KS and other symptomatic disease.
The prognosis of KS is not well defined in resource-limited
settings and its influence on response to ART is unclear. In
particular, the excess mortality related to KS among those on
ART is not well described. We used cohort data from two large
urban HIV care and treatment programs in Johannesburg and
Cape Town, South Africa, to assess the effect of KS on survival,
loss to follow-up and immunologic and virologic responses to
ART.
Methods
Ethics Statement
This analysis was nested within ongoing cohort studies of
routine ART outcomes at the sites in Cape Town and
Johannesburg. Use of data from the Themba Lethu and
Khayelitsha sites were approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand and the Ethics
Committee of the University of Cape Town, respectively. The
pooling of data in IeDEA-SA was approved by Ethics Committees
at the Universities of Bern and Cape Town. Individual patient
consent was not needed, consistent with the South African
Medical Research Council’s Guidelines on.
Ethics for Medical Research and the Declaration of Helsinki. As
this was a retrospective analysis of routine clinical service records,
no additional data collection or procedures were undertaken from
or on patients, all patient information was entered into the
database using coded identification numbers, and no information
that could reveal patient identity was available in the analytic
datasets.
Cohort Description
Data for this study came from two HIV treatment cohorts: the
Themba Lethu Clinic in Johannesburg [18] and three clinics of
the Khayelitsha ART programme in Cape Town [19,20], South
Africa. Both Themba Lethu and the Khayelitsha clinics are part of
the International epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS in
Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA), a large collaboration of ART
treatment programmes (www.iedea-sa.org) [21]. Themba Lethu
has initiated over 16,000 patients on ART since its inception in
2004. The Khayelitsha clinics were set up by Me´decins Sans
Frontie`res (MSF) in 2001 and are now run by the Western Cape
Provincial Department of Health. In August 2010, more than
16,000 patients were on ART. The data from the three
Khayelitsha clinics were aggregated for this analysis. Care at all
clinics was provided according to the South African National
Department of Health guidelines in place during the study period
[22]. Routine data were collected prospectively at each site to
facilitate HIV treatment monitoring. Data from the different sites
were transferred to the IeDEA-SA database managed by the
Universities of Cape Town, South Africa and Bern, Switzerland.
Eligibility Criteria
We included HIV-positive treatment naı¨ve patients $18 years
of age who initiated ART at a study clinic between 01 January
2001 and 31 December 2007. We limited the analysis to patients
starting standard South African public sector first-line ART
regimens (stavudine [d4T] or zidovudine [AZT] with lamivudine
[3TC] and either efavirenz [EFV] or nevirapine [NVP]) [22].
During the study period, the National guidelines’ eligibility criteria
for initiation of ART were either a CD4 cell count ,200 cells/
mm3 or a WHO stage 4 illness (such as KS) regardless of CD4
count. We found 13,847 patients were eligible for the current
analysis.
Study Variables
We compared ART outcomes by KS status at ART initiation.
KS was defined as having a KS diagnosis recorded in the dataset
between 6 months prior to and 6 months after ART initiation. KS
is diagnosed mostly on a clinical basis at the study sites and while
certain individuals may have had histopathological confirmation of
disease, this is not routinely done in all cases. Our primary
outcomes included: 1) all-cause mortality; 2) loss to follow up
(LTFU); 3) failure to achieve virologic response at 6- and 12-
months on ART (HIV viral load #400 copies/ml); and 4) failure
to achieve immunologic response (CD4 count increase of .50
cells/mm3 at 6 months and .100 cells/mm3 at 12 months after
ART initiation). LTFU was defined as having not attended the
clinic in the previous 4 months. Mortality is ascertained through
active tracing of patients who do not return to the clinic, and data
for those lost was also verified at the end of 2010 with the South
African National Vital Registration system for patients in whom a
civil identification number was available (42% of those lost to care
in Themba Lethu [23] and 47% in Khayelitsha [19]). As the
hazard of mortality was not consistent over time, for both the
mortality and LTFU outcomes, we considered the effect of KS on
each of these events at any time point after initiation of treatment.
We then further stratified the analysis into the first year after ART
initiation and after the first year on ART.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics for each group were stratified by KS
status and summarized as proportions or medians with interquartile ranges. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models
were used to estimate the effect of KS on mortality and loss to
follow up on ART at each time period considered. Person-time
was calculated from the date of ART initiation to the earliest of: 1)
death or loss to follow up; 2) transfer to another facility; or 3) end
of study period (31 December 2008). We used mixed linear models
with a random intercept and an unstructured correlation matrix to
estimate CD4 trajectories over time, accounting for repeated
observations on an individual. Time was specified as a quadratic
function. Models for those with KS and those without KS were fit
separately to allow for different curves by exposure group. The
association of KS with change in CD4 count from baseline to 6
and 12 months was estimated using a multivariate linear
generalized estimating equation model. Additionally, log-binomial
regression was used to estimate the impact of KS status on CD4
response (.50 cells/mm3 and .100 cells/mm3
) and VL
suppression (,400 vs. $400) by 6- and then by 12-months on
treatment respectively. All models were adjusted for age, gender,

baseline CD4 count (at ART initiation), tuberculosis treatment
status, time period (year of ART initiation) and initiating
treatment site.
Results
A total of 13,847 patients met eligibility criteria, including 247
individuals (1.8%) diagnosed with KS at baseline (i.e. 6 months
prior to up to 6 months after ART initiation). The prevalence of
KS was slightly greater in Khayelitsha than at Themba Lethu
(2.2% vs. 1.5%). The patient characteristics at initiation of ART
are described in Table 1. Those with KS at ART initiation were
similar to those without with respect to median age (35 vs. 35
years) and first-line ART regimen (68% vs. 69% initiated on d4T3TC-EFV). The median presenting CD4 count was somewhat
lower in KS patients (74 vs. 85 cells/mm3
) but those with KS were
about twice as likely to have a CD4 count in the 200–350 cells/
mm3 category (12.3% vs. 7.2%). The proportion on TB treatment
was also higher among those with KS (37% vs. 30%). As expected,
patients with KS were more likely to be male than other patients
(49% vs. 36%). Those without KS had received a median of 19.1
months of ART (IQR: 7.8–32.0) compared to 12.3 months (IQR:
2.3–29.8) among those with KS.
Mortality and Loss to Follow Up
Vital status outcomes were ascertained for 13,065 (94%) of the
13,847 subjects (95% for those with KS and 94% for those without
KS). Of these, 10% (1,312) died and 14% (1,837) were LTFU at
some point after ART initiation (Table 2). Median follow-up time
for those who died or were lost to follow up was 4.5 (IQR 1.5–
12.5) and 9.6 (IQR 4.4–19.3) months, respectively. Mortality was
highest within the first 12 months after starting ART (74% of
deaths occurred in the first 12 months).
A greater proportion of individuals with KS died after ART
initiation compared to those without KS (27% vs. 10%). The rate
of LTFU after ART initiation was 13.0/100 py among those with
KS compared to 3.9/100 py among those without KS. Individuals
with KS had higher mortality rates at all durations after ART
initiation compared to those without KS: 28.3/100 person-years
(100 py) vs. 7.4/100 py within the first year and 4.1/100 py vs.
1.8/100 py after the first year.
Cumulative incidence curves showed higher incidence of
mortality for those with KS after ART initiation with the greatest
differences in mortality occurring within the first year on treatment
(Figure 1). The risk of death for those with KS was over three times
that of those without KS at any time point after ART initiation
(adjusted HR: 3.62; 95%CI: 2.71–4.84) and four times greater
within the first year after ART initiation (adjusted HR: 4.05;
95%CI: 2.95–5.55) (Table 2). Among those who survived to a year
on treatment, the risk of death was still greater in the KS group
though the magnitude of this effect was smaller (adjusted HR:
2.30; 95%CI: 1.08–4.89).
We also analyzed the effect of time of KS diagnosis in relation to
ART initiation on mortality. The mortality rate after ART
initiation was greater among those diagnosed with KS before ART
initiation than those diagnosed with KS after ART initiation
(14.2/100 py vs. 9.8/100 py) though both of these were greater
than the proportion who died among those without KS (3.9/
100 py). The hazard of death among those diagnosed with KS
before ART initiation was higher than the hazard among those
diagnosed with KS after ART initiation (HR = 4.14 95% CI 2.97–
5.77 vs. HR = 2.61 95% CI 1.47–4.62) comparing both groups to
those without KS.

Kaposi Sarcoma and ART in HIV-Positive Population

A greater proportion of individuals with KS were LTFU after
ART initiation compared to those without KS (18% vs. 14%). The
rate of LTFU after ART initiation was 8.8/100 py among those
with KS compared to 5.5/100 py among those without KS.
Among those with KS, the rate of LTFU was greatest in the first
year after initiation of ART (13.6/100 py in the first 12 months vs.
7.0/100 py after 12 months). In adjusted proportional hazards
models there was little evidence for a difference in the rate of
LTFU in those with KS compared to those without, both in first
year (adjusted HR: 1.55; 95%CI: 0.85–2.82) and after a year on
treatment (adjusted HR: 1.21; 95%CI: 0.54–2.70). In competing
risks analyses with death as the competing event, the rate of LTFU
was closely similar but attenuated (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.59–1.78).
Immunologic and Virologic Failure
Among the 12,337 subjects alive and in care at 6 months on
treatment, CD4 count values were available for 8,676 (70%) of
these (63% of those with KS and 70% of those without KS). By 6
months on treatment, nearly a quarter of patients (23.7%; 95% CI:
17.3–32.7%) with KS had failed to achieve a CD4 increase of $50
cells/mm3 compared to 18.1% (95% CI: 17.5–19.1) of those
without KS (Table 3). The median increase in CD4 count by 6
months on ART was 98 cells/mm3 (IQR 58–164 cells/mm3)
among the KS group and 121 cells/mm3 (IQR 66–190 cells/mm3
)
for those without KS. Patients with KS gained, on average, 29
fewer CD4 cells (95% CI: 7–52 cells/mm3) than those without KS
over the same time period. Among the 11,667 patients who
survived to a year on treatment, CD4 count values were available
for 7,157 (62%) of subjects. 29.9% (95% CI: 21.4–39.6%) of KS
patients failed to achieve a 100 cell increase in CD4 count
compared to 23.3% (95% CI: 22.3–24.3%) of patients without KS.
The median increase in CD4 count by 12 months on ART was
150 cells/mm3 (IQR 90–225 cells/mm3
) among the KS group and
175 cells/mm3 (IQR: 105–260cells/mm3
) for those without KS.
Using adjusted generalised estimating equations, those with KS
gained an estimated 9 fewer CD4 cells (95% CI -21–40 cells/mm3
)
than those without KS over the first year of ART. The predicted
CD4 trajectories from start of ART suggested some advantage for
those without KS (Figure 2). Despite starting on very similar CD4
cell counts at ART initiation, those with KS gained fewer CD4
cells over the first year of treatment compared to those without
KS. By the end of the first year the rate of increase in CD4 count
was similar for the groups, though the group without KS retained
consistently higher CD4 cell counts after treatment initiation. In
log-binomial models, patients with KS were more likely to fail to
achieve a 50 cells/mm3 increase (RR 1.43; 95% CI: 0.99–2.06)
and 100 cells/mm3 increase (RR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.84–1.73) in
CD4 count at 6- and 12-months on treatment respectively
(Table 3). Sensitivity analyses yielded no qualitative differences
in results when attributing either achieving or failing to achieve the
outcome to all missing CD4 count responses at 6 or 12 months on
treatment (results not shown).
Virologic response to ART was favourable among both groups
(Table 3). By 6 months on treatment, only 11% of those with KS
had failed to suppress HIV viral load to ,400 copies/mL while
just under 8% of those without KS had failed to achieve
suppression. Among those who survived to a year on treatment,
similar proportions failing to achieve virologic responses were
noted (7% vs. 10%). The relative risk for failure to achieve
virologic suppression suggests that KS patients fared better at 6
(RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.38–1.79) and 12 months (RR: 0.25; 95% CI:
0.06–1.00) after initiation of ART compared to those without KS
though these estimates lacked precision. Results from sensitivity

Discussion
AIDS-related malignancies are increasing in significance as the
HIV epidemic matures, particularly in resource-limited settings.
These settings bear the greatest burden of disease due to cancers
yet are most limited in terms of drug options, infrastructure and
staffing required to effectively treat these conditions. As access to
ART continues to scale-up and models of HIV care shift away
from specialist services to decentralised clinics, investigating factors
that impact on the effective response to ART is important. ART
has shown much promise in the treatment of early stage KS [10–
16,24] but the effect of KS on response to ART is not clear.
We found the prevalence of Kaposi sarcoma among this HIVinfected treatment naı¨ve population was 1.8%, very similar to the
prevalence of 1.6% seen in Nigeria [25], and somewhat lower than
seen among European cohorts (3.8–6.4%) in the late 1990s [26–
28]. While there may be country-level differences in prevalence of
KS, our figures could underestimate the true prevalence in this
setting for several reasons. Firstly, diagnosis of KS in HIV
outpatient clinics may be impaired by limited access to oncology
and histopathology services, as well as lack of training on early
recognition KS by primary care staff. A recent study in South
Africa noted that 46% of study subjects were diagnosed with KS
and HIV at the same time [29] and earlier studies have shown
high pre-ART attrition underestimates KS prevalence; in South
Africa the prevalence of KS including pre-ART subjects was
estimated at 3.4% [8]. Additionally, limited communication and
linkage between oncology and outpatient services hampers the
recording of cancer diagnoses in HIV clinic patient records and
use of national cancer registry databases to ascertain cancer
diagnoses is not routine.
We demonstrated a substantially increased risk of mortality
associated with KS. The risk of death was four times greater
among the KS group in the first year on ART and though the risk
decreased thereafter, those with KS were still twice as likely to die
after the first year of treatment as those without KS after
adjustment for measured confounders. This is in keeping with
previous findings on KS mortality [8,25] and highlights the
importance of early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate
treatment for HIV-infected subjects with KS at every stage of
HIV infection and treatment. We also note that the KS group
were more likely to have a diagnosis of tuberculosis at initiation of
ART when compared to those without KS. Though TB is not
diagnosed primarily by chest x-ray in these settings, the
radiographic appearance of the nodular infiltrate associated with
pulmonary KS could have been mistaken for TB in some cases.
Pulmonary KS is associated with high rates of mortality and
though all models were adjusted for diagnosis of TB at ART
initiation, this may have contributed to the excess mortality noted
in the KS group.
Though the results were imprecise and lacked statistical
significance, we note that the majority of estimates suggested
those with KS were less likely to fail to suppress HIV viral load. It
is possible that this reflects survivor bias in that those with KS who
are also poorly adherent to treatment do not survive to have a viral
load test done at the intervals described. Though we cannot make
inferences from our results, if this effect were real, it might suggest
better adherence among those surviving with KS possibly related
to more intensive follow up and more frequent attendance at clinic
visits for their KS related care. We did also note some
immunologic differences. First, those with KS were roughly twice
as likely to have a nadir CD4 count between 200 and 350 cells/
mm3 compared to those without KS. This is likely explained by
the fact that KS (as a WHO stage 4-defining condition) was an
indication for initiation of ART with CD4 count $200 cells/mm3
at a time when the ART eligibility criteria were otherwise ,200.
Second, after initiation of ART, those with KS were less likely to
increase their CD4 cell counts by 50 and 100 cells at 6 and 12
months on treatment respectively. The KS group also had a
smaller mean increase in CD4 cell count at both time periods than
those without KS though the actual difference in CD4 gain was

small between the groups. This may be due to differences in
disease stage at treatment initiation [30] or possibly related to the
additional suppressive effect of chemotherapy on the KS patients’
immune system. CD4 cell counts have been documented to
decline by up to 50% during chemotherapy even in the presence
of virally suppressive ART [31], an additional immune insult that
would not be experienced by those not receiving chemotherapy
and could partially explain the lack of significant difference in viral
load suppression in this study. We emphasize that our findings
apply only to those who remained alive and in care with follow-up
laboratory results at the time points considered.

Our findings need to be considered in light of the study’s
limitations. First, the prevalence of KS is likely to be underestimated in these cohorts due to the remote location of oncology
services from the HIV outpatient clinics and other reasons
explored above. Current linkage projects in collaboration with
the National cancer registry are underway which aim to improve
ascertainment of cancers among HIV treatment cohorts. Second,
high rates of lost to follow up in these cohorts may introduce the
possibility of selection bias, though we did not find significant
differences in rates of LTFU between the groups. The rate of
LTFU may, however, have led to underestimations of the
mortality rates due to different mortality rates between patients
lost to follow-up with and without KS. As previously noted,
anywhere from 20–50% of those lost from HIV care are actually
deceased [23,32–34]. Finally, we lacked data on staging of KS
disease and use of chemotherapy and were unable to adjust models
for these or estimate the effect of chemotherapy and ART on
treatment outcomes, particularly among those with visceral
advanced KS.
Despite effective ART, clinical KS remains a poor prognostic
factor in ART treatment outcomes. High rates of mortality and
loss to follow up confirm that KS remains a significant problem in
low and middle income countries. Insufficient awareness at
primary care level leads to under-diagnosis of KS, especially in
its early stages, and result in patients often presenting with
advanced disease. Delays in initiation of treatment for AIDSrelated malignancies such as KS remain a problem in settings
where oncology services and chemotherapy are offered at specialist
tertiary centres often remote from primary care services and
unable to cope with the high patient burden. Under-diagnosis of
disseminated disease and limited chemotherapy options are also
likely to be negatively impacting on survival and need to be
addressed to improve outcomes for HIV-infected patients
presenting for treatment with KS. In particular, chemotherapeutic
options, such as paclitaxel, are not readily available in resourcelimited settings due to high cost. Future research efforts may focus
on investigating alternate chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide [35–37], which could be safely administered at primary care
level in order to increase access and reduce delays and resulting
mortality.
