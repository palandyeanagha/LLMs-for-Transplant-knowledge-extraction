Abstract Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and progressive renal impairment.
This holds true in the general population and particularly in
those with diabetes, in whom it is common and marks out
those likely to develop macrovascular disease and progressive renal impairment. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms through which microalbuminuria occurs
holds the key to designing therapies to arrest its development and prevent these later manifestations.
Microalbuminuria arises from the increased passage of
albumin through the glomerular filtration barrier. This
requires ultrastructural changes rather than alterations in
glomerular pressure or filtration rate alone. Compromise of
selective glomerular permeability can be confirmed in early
diabetic nephropathy but does not correlate well with reported
glomerular structural changes. The loss of systemic endothelial glycocalyx—a protein-rich surface layer on the endothelium—in diabetes suggests that damage to this layer
represents this missing link. The epidemiology of microalbuminuria reveals a close association with systemic endothelial dysfunction and with vascular disease, also implicating
glomerular endothelial dysfunction in microalbuminuria.
Our understanding of the metabolic and hormonal
sequelae of hyperglycaemia is increasing, and we consider
these in the context of damage to the glomerular filtration
barrier. Reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines
and growth factors are key players in this respect. Taken
together with the above observations and the presence of
generalised endothelial dysfunction, these considerations
lead to the conclusion that glomerular endothelial dysfunction, and in particular damage to its glycocalyx, represents
the most likely initiating step in diabetic microalbuminuria.

Introduction
The associations between microalbuminuria, cardiovascular
disease and progressive renal impairment are well described, but how these are linked mechanistically is
something of a conundrum [1]. Here we focus on the
pathogenesis of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, in
whom it occurs commonly and has particular significance. In
type 1 diabetes the prevalence gradually increases from onset
of disease (6% after 1–3 years), reaching over 50% after
20 years [2]. In type 2 diabetes the prevalence is 20–25% in
both newly diagnosed and established diabetes [3]. However,

it is also instructive to review the general epidemiology of
microalbuminuria, including those conditions with which it
is associated and those for which it is a risk factor. Such an
analysis reveals generalised endothelial dysfunction as a
common denominator in microalbuminuria in both the
general and diabetic populations. In 1989, this observation
led to the hypothesis that a common process underlies both
microalbuminuria and generalised endothelial dysfunction in
diabetes. This process was suggested to be the dysregulation
of enzymes involved in metabolism of extracellular matrix,
the ‘Steno hypothesis’ [4].
Nearly 20 years on from the Steno hypothesis, the
determinants of selective glomerular permeability to proteins at the cellular and molecular level are much better
understood. In particular, the importance of podocytespecific proteins in the regulation of selective permeability
has been recognised. Similarly, much is now known about
the biochemical derangements important in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. We draw together these
elements to consider the pathophysiological mechanisms
through which diabetes exerts its effects on glomerular
permeability in the initiating stages of diabetic nephropathy,
i.e. at or before the appearance of microalbuminuria. These
early changes establish the milieu in which the more
advanced changes of overt diabetic nephropathy develop.
Defining the mechanistic links from biochemical derangements to the appearance of increased urinary albumin
highlights key elements in the pathophysiological pathway
of the development of both diabetic nephropathy and
micro- and macrovascular disease elsewhere.
We hold with the established view that increased
transglomerular passage of albumin is the major source of
microalbuminuria [5]. While other hypotheses have been
advanced, for example, failure of tubular reuptake of
albumin, none are sufficiently robust to seriously challenge
this position.
In both general and diabetic populations, conditions
associated with endothelial damage predispose
to microalbuminuria
In the general (non-diabetic) population, hypertension is the
major risk factor for microalbuminuria, and the prevalence
of microalbuminuria in essential hypertension is around
25%. Individuals with essential hypertension who develop
microalbuminuria have a higher incidence of biochemical
disturbances, implying that hypertension per se may not be
the cause of microalbuminuria, but, rather, these additional
derangements [6]. Microalbuminuria is strongly associated
with vascular disease in hypertensive patients, suggesting
that it is a marker of vascular and/or endothelial damage in
this condition [7].
The insulin resistance syndrome describes a clustering of
disorders the underlying pathology of which is thought to
be related to insulin resistance and/or endothelial dysfunction [8]. Microalbuminuria is associated with several of the
disturbances found in the insulin resistance syndrome,
including endothelial dysfunction and obesity, in addition
to type 2 diabetes. Proinflammatory cytokines produced by
visceral adipocytes (adipokines) have recently emerged as
important mediators of the increased cardiovascular risk
associated with the insulin resistance syndrome. These
adipokines represent a possible link from insulin resistance
and obesity to microalbuminuria in the non-diabetic
population.
Microalbuminuria can be detected in patients undergoing
major surgery, particularly when complicated by sepsis [9],
and is associated with other inflammatory states, including
rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease [10].
Microalbuminuria can also be detected in a significant
proportion of the normal non-diabetic, normotensive population (6.6% in one study [11]), where it also associates
with cardiovascular disease. Male sex [11] and hormone
replacement therapy in women [12] seem to increase
susceptibility to microalbuminuria, and although the basis
for this is not clear, the fact that men have a higher incidence
of vascular disease in general implies a common aetiology.
Hypertension is approximately twice as frequent in
individuals with diabetes as in those without, and hypertensive individuals are predisposed to the development of
diabetes [13]. Hypertension is certainly a major determinant
of microangiopathy in diabetes, but the relationship
between hypertension and microalbuminuria in diabetes is
complex. Hypertension and microalbuminuria often coexist
in diabetic patients, and reducing blood pressure reduces
microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes [14]. However, it is
unclear whether hypertension contributes to the development
of microalbuminuria in diabetes. At least in type 1 diabetes,
hypertension and microalbuminuria appear to develop together: in longitudinal studies there is no evidence that hypertension develops before microalbuminuria [15]. This is more
difficult to demonstrate in type 2 diabetes, perhaps because
of the heterogeneity of the disease.
One third of patients with type 1 diabetes develop
advanced nephropathy, and the renal status of probands of
diabetic patients makes a difference of nearly 50% in risk
[16]. A family history of hypertension also predisposes to
microalbuminuria in diabetes [17]. These observations
suggest a genetic predisposition in individuals with type 1
diabetes who develop diabetic nephropathy, but as yet no
gene has been identified. Perhaps most significant is that
this and other evidence suggests that the susceptibility of
type 1 diabetic patients to diabetic nephropathy is increased
in response to increased genetic risk of insulin resistance
[18]. Consequently, it is the combination of this genetic risk
Diabetologia (2008) 51:714–725 715

with hyperglycaemia and its sequelae that leads to microalbuminuria and, eventually, diabetic nephropathy.
Thus, in the diabetic as well as in the general population
the risk factors for the development of microalbuminuria
can be grouped into those associated with vascular disease,
including endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and insulin resistance. This implies that microalbuminuria may
also, at least in these situations, result from endothelial
dysfunction. This does not preclude significant damage to
other components of the vessel wall, including basement
membrane, pericytes, matrix components (collagen, elastin)
and vascular smooth muscle cells. However, as the
principal regulators of vascular permeability, endothelial
cells are likely to be involved in systemic increases in
permeability.
Conditions associated with endothelial damage predispose individuals to microalbuminuria.
Microalbuminuria is a risk factor
for macro- and microangiopathy, including
advanced diabetic nephropathy
Microalbuminuria is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in type 1 [19] and 2 diabetes [20], as well as
in the non-diabetic population [21]. In type 1 diabetes,
microalbuminuria is closely associated with microangiopathy elsewhere (e.g. retinopathy). Although this association
is also present in type 2 diabetes, in a proportion of these
patients microalbuminuria does not appear to reflect
generalised microvascular damage [22].
Microalbuminuria predicts the development of overt
diabetic nephropathy in type 1 and 2 diabetes; however,
the relationship in type 2 diabetes is less clear because of
the greater heterogeneity of this condition and the presence
of other risk factors for microalbuminuria in these, usually
elderly, patients [23]. Microalbuminuria invariably precedes
overt diabetic nephropathy, and although microalbuminuria
may regress spontaneously in a proportion of cases, it
remains the best documented predictor for high risk of
development of diabetic nephropathy in both type 1 and
type 2 diabetes [24].
Microalbuminuria is a risk factor for vascular disease 
and nephropathy.
The relationship between microalbuminuria and vascular
disease suggests a common causality, as established risk
factors explain at most a small part of these associations
[25]. Unifying mechanisms, such as generalised endothelial
dysfunction or inflammation, are therefore implicated [8].
Indeed, AER is correlated with endothelial dysfunction in
type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and in the non-diabetic
population [26]. Markers of chronic low-grade inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), are also correlated
with microalbuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [27],
and increasing evidence from the non-diabetic population
indicates the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease [28].
Generalised and glomerular endothelial dysfunction
Markers of endothelial dysfunction, including elevated
serum von Willebrand factor (vWF) and increased transcapillary albumin escape rate, are present before the onset
of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes and worsen in
association with it [27, 29]. Type 2 diabetes is often
complicated by the presence of other risk factors for
vascular disease, and discerning the contribution of hyperglycaemia and its sequelae to endothelial dysfunction in
this condition is more difficult. While in some type 2
diabetic patients microalbuminuria may occur in the
absence of evidence of endothelial dysfunction, in others,
vWF levels predict its development [30]. The close
association between endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes may underlie the predictability of development of diabetic nephropathy and the
greater susceptibility to micro- and macrovascular disease
in other organs.
Endothelial dysfunction precedes microalbuminuria.
As endothelial dysfunction is an important antecedent of
microalbuminuria in both types of diabetes (albeit with a less
predictable relationship in type 2), it provides an attractive
explanation for the association between microalbuminuria and
vascular disease in diabetes (Fig. 1). But to what extent can
endothelial dysfunction be said to cause microalbuminuria?
As the glomerular endothelium is exposed to the same
diabetic milieu as other endothelia, it is highly likely that it is
also dysfunctional. This begs the question of how glomerular
endothelial dysfunction could lead to microalbuminuria. To
address this we now turn to consider the structure and
function of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB).
The glomerular filtration barrier is a complex biological
sieve
Unlike other capillaries, glomerular capillaries have a high
permeability to water (hydraulic conductivity) yet, like
716 Diabetologia (2008) 51:714–725

other capillaries, are relatively impermeable to macromolecules. These fundamental permeability properties
depend on the unique, three-layer structure of the GFB:
the endothelium with its glycocalyx, the glomerular
basement membrane (GBM) and podocytes (glomerular
epithelial cells; Fig. 2) [31].
Glomerular endothelial cells Glomerular endothelial cells
are highly specialised cells with regions of attenuated
cytoplasm punctuated by numerous fenestrae, circular
transcellular pores 60–80 nm in diameter [31, 32]. Initially
these fenestrations were thought of as empty and to
therefore provide little barrier to the passage of proteins.
Standard fixation protocols for electron microscopy do not
preserve the glycocalyx, but newer fixation techniques have
allowed the demonstration of a glomerular endothelial
glycocalyx of 200–400 nm in thickness [33, 34]. This
glycocalyx covers both fenestral and inter-fenestral
domains of the glomerular endothelial cell luminal surface.
Studies of the systemic endothelial glycocalyx are
instructive here. The glycocalyx is a dynamic, hydrated
layer largely composed of glycoproteins and proteoglycans
with adsorbed plasma proteins. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are largely responsible for the negative
charge characteristics of the glycocalyx. Removal of the
glycocalyx increases vascular protein permeability, providing evidence that it hinders the passage of macromolecules
[35, 36]. Compared with those without, capillaries with
fenestrations are much more permeable to water and small
solutes, but not to proteins. These characteristics can only
be explained by the glycocalyx [37].
Therefore, the presence of a significant glomerular
endothelial glycocalyx implies that the glomerular endothelium significantly contributes to the barrier to macromolecules [31, 32, 38]. Experimental data support this
view: in mice treated with glycocalyx-degrading enzymes
the distance between luminal lipid droplets and the
glomerular endothelium was decreased, and this was
accompanied by an increase in AER [39]. In rats, under
normal perfusion conditions albumin is confined to the
glomerular capillary lumen and endothelial fenestrae [40].
Endothelial glycocalyx has the correct anatomical distribution (on the surface of endothelial cells, including in
fenestral openings) to explain this distribution. Reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which are known to disrupt the
glycocalyx [41], cause torrential proteinuria without any
identifiable structural changes in the GFB using standard
electron microscopy techniques [42]. Furthermore, the
ability of human glomerular endothelial cell glycocalyx to
form a permeability barrier to macromolecules can be
directly demonstrated in vitro [43].
Endothelial glycocalyx forms a barrier to protein 
permeability in both systemic and glomerular 
capillaries.
The GBM The GBM is a basal lamina specialised for the
structural requirements of the GBM and its filtration
function. It is a hydrated meshwork of collagens and
laminins to which negatively charged HSPGs are attached.
Traditional concepts have therefore characterised the GBM
as a charge-selective barrier. However, more recent analyses indicate that it only makes a small direct contribution to
the barrier to protein passage [31].
Podocytes Podocytes, or, more specifically, their interdigitating foot processes, form the outer layer of the GFB (Fig. 2).
The gaps between adjacent foot processes, the ‘filtration
slits’ (25–60 nm), are spanned by the slit diaphragm. This is
a molecular structure thought to form the most restrictive
barrier to the passage of water and macromolecules. The
effect of mutations in podocyte-specific proteins (e.g.
nephrin mutations result in congenital nephrotic syndrome)
indicate the importance of podocytes in resisting the passage
of protein [44]. However, exactly how podocytes and their
foot processes contribute to selective permeability is not yet
clear. Electron microscopy studies have suggested that the
slit diaphragm has a porous structure with a pore half-width
of 2 nm. However, this figure is too small to account for the
experimentally observed passage of solutes of various radii,
emphasising that our understanding of slit diaphragm
function is incomplete [45]. Podocyte biology has been
reviewed in detail elsewhere [44].

also contribute to microalbuminuria (broken arrows)

Passage of albumin across the normal GFB
Filtration Water filters across the GFB via gaps through or
between cells rather than through the cell cytoplasm.
Therefore, the high hydraulic conductivity of the GFB
depends on the presence of fenestrae and filtration slits.
Fifty per cent of the hydraulic resistance of the GFB is
afforded by the two cell layers (endothelium and podocyte
foot processes), and 50% by the GBM [46].
Solute flux Solute flux (including albumin) from the
glomerular capillary occurs by a combination of convection
(i.e. being swept along by the filtration of water) and diffusion
[31]. The rate of convection of a solute depends on the
filtration rate and on its reflection coefficient. Reflection
coefficients are related to solute size, larger solutes having
higher reflection coefficients. A value of 1 indicates that a
molecule is totally excluded. The rate of diffusion of a solute
depends on the concentration gradient and its diffusivity
(solute permeability). The diffusivity of a solute decreases
with increasing size. A measure of overall flux of a solute is
given by the sieving coefficient: the filtrate to plasma
concentration ratio. The sieving coefficient for albumin
across the normal GFB is <0.001 [47]. The ratio of the
contribution of convective to diffusive flux (the Peclet
number) increases with increasing molecular size. That is,
for small molecules, diffusion dominates; for larger molecules, convection dominates. The Peclet number for albumin
across the normal GFB is near to unity, so both diffusion and
convection contribute [48]. Hence, an increase in GFR will
result in an increase in the convective flux of albumin.
However, despite this, the best estimates indicate that even a
50% increase in filtration rate would only increase urinary
albumin in the sub-microalbuminuric range, as the majority
of the excess albumin is reabsorbed by the tubules [47].
Therefore, for albumin flux to increase sufficiently to produce
microalbuminuria (assuming normal tubular reuptake), the
GFB must be physically altered in such a way as to increase
the sieving coefficient of albumin across it.
Models have been developed to correlate the macromolecular sieving properties of the GFB with the structure and
properties of its components [31]. These indicate that the
GFB functions as a whole, with each layer having an
important contribution to selective permeability. Whereas
hydraulic resistances are essentially additive, sieving
coefficients are multiplicative. This relationship means that
a change in one element significantly affects the overall
protein permeability to the same degree, i.e. a 10% change
in permeability of any one layer will produce a 10% change
in overall GFB permeability. Importantly, this means that,
regardless of which layer is most restrictive, a change in the
permeability of any layer of the GFB could potentially
account for microalbuminuria.
The presence of microalbuminuria implies dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier.
Theoretically, this could result from damage to any 
of its layers, including the endothelial glycocalyx.
Structural alterations in the GFB associated
with microalbuminuria in diabetes
Glomerular structural changes typical of diabetic nephropathy are commonly established by the time microalbuminuria becomes apparent [49, 50]. However, the changes
seen are heterogeneous, and all may be found in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients [51]. Early changes described
include an increase in glomerular size, GBM thickening,
mesangial expansion and broadening of podocyte foot
processes [49–51]. The increase in glomerular size is due
both to mesangial expansion and to enlargement in
glomerular capillaries. The latter occurs at least in part

through angiogenesis, an endothelium-dependent process
[52, 53]. Glomerular structural changes are less marked in
type 2 diabetes, with only a third conforming to the
classical pattern observed in type 1 diabetes [22].
Specific assessment of structural changes in glomerular
endothelial cells and associated glycocalyx in diabetes has not
been performed. Evidence is emerging, however, that total
systemic glycocalyx volume is reduced by acute hyperglycaemia in humans [54]. Furthermore, type 1 diabetic
patients have decreased systemic glycocalyx volume, and this
correlates with the presence of microalbuminuria [55]. GBM
thickening alone, without change in composition, does not
significantly affect its protein permeability characteristics.
Generalised glycocalyx damage occurs in diabetes 
and is associated with microalbuminuria.
Broadening of podocyte foot processes (effacement) is
an indicator of podocyte injury but generally correlates
poorly with degree of proteinuria [56]. Indeed, proteinuria
may occur in the complete absence of structural changes to
podocytes [57]. This is the case with diabetic microalbuminuria, which can occur in the absence of such
changes, at least in type 2 diabetes [58]. Some have
suggested that podocyte loss occurs in early diabetes and
that this would contribute to the filtration barrier defect
[51]. Others have argued that significant early podocyte
loss does not occur [59]. A likely reconciliation is that the
lower proportion of podocytes seen in early disease is due
to a relative increase in mesangial and endothelial cells,
while podocyte loss occurs at a later stage.
Recognised structural changes in the glomerular filtration barrier in diabetes do not correlate well with 
microalbuminuria 
Functional alterations in GFB selective permeability
associated with microalbuminuria in diabetes
Increased flux of albumin across the GFB in diabetic
microalbuminuria can be confirmed in experimental models using isolated glomeruli [60] and by inhibition of
tubular reabsorption of albumin [61]. Analysis of the
permeability of the GFB to molecules of varying size and
charge can be used to estimate whether the increased flux of
albumin is due to loss of size or charge selectivity of the
GFB. In animal models of diabetes the defect is primarily in
charge selectivity [61]. In clinically healthy non-diabetic
individuals with microalbuminuria, loss of both size and
charge selectivity of the GFB can be demonstrated [62].
However, in type 1 diabetes, defects in charge selectivity
occur earlier than loss of size selectivity [63]. Similarly, in
Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria is
associated with loss of charge selectivity. Loss of size
selectivity is seen only in those developing macroalbuminuria [58].
Defects in charge selectivity predominate over defects
in size selectivity in diabetic microalbuminuria, 
consistent with glycocalyx damage. 
We have already noted that physical alteration of the
GFB is necessary to increase its permeability to albumin.
Therefore, this confirmation of changes in GFB selective
permeability in diabetic microalbuminuria in the absence of
clearly identified structural correlates suggests that the key
changes are yet to be elucidated. These considerations and
the predominance of defects in charge selectivity point to
alterations in the negatively charged glomerular endothelial
glycocalyx as the missing link. We now move to consider
what aspects of the diabetic milieu are responsible for these
GFB changes and how they might cause endothelial,
including glycocalyx, dysfunction.
Metabolic pathways and effectors from hyperglycaemia
to microalbuminuria
There is now overwhelming evidence that hyperglycaemia
is the major initiating factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic
complications, including microalbuminuria. However, most
adverse effects of glucose are mediated indirectly through
diverse metabolic pathways. Four major hypotheses have
highlighted the roles of AGEs, increased activity of the
polyol pathway, activation of protein kinase C and
increased flux through the hexosamine pathway (Fig. 3).
Activation of these pathways in turn causes dysregulation
of a number of effector molecules which cause cellular
damage and dysfunction. The roles of these pathways and
effectors have been studied in detail in overt diabetic
nephropathy, but the importance of these elements individually in its initiation and the appearance of microalbuminuria are less clear.
For example, TGFβ is an effector molecule with a clear
role in the progression of established diabetic nephropathy, but
there is no evidence that it is important in the mechanism of
proteinuria per se. It is a key pro-fibrotic mediator, and in type
1 and type 2 diabetes, TGFβ is elevated in serum, urine and
glomeruli from an early stage of disease. Its levels correlate
with the degree of mesangial expansion, interstitial fibrosis
and renal insufficiency, but not with microalbuminuria.
Similarly, in animal models, blockade of TGFβ signalling
inhibits the development of these pathological features, apart
from the microalbuminuria [64, 65].
Here we focus on selected intermediaries and effectors
that have an identifiable role in microalbuminuria. In large
Diabetologia (2008) 51:714–725 719

part, dissection of these pathways and elucidation of their
role in glomerular disease has necessarily relied on tissue
culture or animal models. Such are described where human
studies are lacking or where they provide additional
significant insights.
ROS Brownlee has proposed oxidative stress as a
unifying mechanism whereby the above-mentioned four
pathways are inter-linked in the pathogenesis of diabetic
complications (Fig. 3) [66]. Hyperglycaemia increases
oxidative stress through overproduction of superoxide and
other ROS by the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
ROS have direct cellular effects (e.g. they increase activity
of nuclear factor κB [NFκB], a key inflammatory regulator), increase oxidative stress and interact with the above
four pathways. Normalisation of mitochondrial superoxide
production blocks all four of these pathways implicated in
hyperglycaemic damage and corrects a variety of hyperglycaemia-induced phenotypes in target cells of diabetic
complications. Endogenous superoxide dismutase normally
neutralises excess superoxide but is overwhelmed in the
diabetic state.
As well as forming a nexus of metabolic pathways
dysregulated by hyperglycaemia, ROS can also be considered as effectors through direct cellular actions. ROS
decrease glomerular HSPG production [67], directly disrupt
the endothelial glycocalyx [68], interfere with nitric oxide
bioavailability and activate NFκB.
Glomerular ROS production is increased in experimental
diabetes [69] and transgenic overexpression of superoxide
dismutase attenuates renal injury, including increases in
AER [70]. A superoxide dismutase mimetic also ameliorates increases in glomerular permeability both in vivo and
ex vivo in non-diabetic models [71]. Little work has yet
been done on the use of antioxidants in human diabetic
nephropathy, but in vitro work confirms the importance of
ROS in cells of the GFB. Podocytes produce ROS in
response to high glucose [72], and genetic overexpression
of superoxide dismutase prevents inhibition of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity by hyperglycaemia in
endothelial cells [73].
Biochemical disturbances important in mediating 
adverse effects of hyperglycaemia damage the endothelium and/or the glycocalyx.
Vascular endothelial growth factor Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of vascular
permeability and angiogenesis and is implicated in the
pathogenesis of diabetic retinal neovascularisation. In the
glomerulus it is produced in large amounts by podocytes
and is thought to be important in maintaining glomerular
endothelial cell fenestrations [74]. In rat models of type 1
diabetes, VEGF is upregulated in podocytes throughout the
course of disease [75]. VEGF inhibition attenuates glomerMetabolic

These in turn lead to the production of effectors that directly
cause glomerular endothelial
cell (GEnC) dysfunction (particularly of the glycocalyx) and
disturb podocyte–endothelial
cell communication. This results
in microalbuminuria. Progression of these lesions and development of other glomerular
changes, including podocyte
damage, lead to overt diabetic

ular hypertrophy and albumin excretion and prevents
upregulation of eNOS production in glomerular endothelial
cells [76]. Similar effects are observed in some, but not all,
models of type 2 diabetes [77].
In human type 1 diabetes, serum VEGF concentrations
vary according to glycaemic control, and higher levels are
associated with microvascular complications, including
microalbuminuria [78]. In type 2 diabetes, VEGF is
upregulated early in the course of disease and urinary
VEGF levels are correlated with microalbuminuria [79].
Further studies have confirmed initial upregulation of
VEGF signalling in type 2 diabetes followed by a downregulation as podocyte loss and sclerosis develops [80].
VEGF has the potential to induce the new vessel growth
seen in early diabetic nephropathy [53] and to alter the
permeability characteristics of the endothelium. Indeed,
there is increasing evidence of the importance of precise
control of glomerular VEGF for normal GFB function: both
transgenic podocyte-specific under- or overexpression
result in glomerular abnormalities, including glomerular
endothelial changes and proteinuria [81]. Retardation of
albuminuria in experimental diabetes by angiogenesis
inhibitors further implies the importance of angiogenesis
and/or endothelial-related processes in the development of
diabetic microalbuminuria [52, 82].
Experimental interventions that protect the endothelium reduce microalbuminuria.
The growth hormone/IGF system Dysregulation of the
growth hormone/IGF system can be detected early in
experimental diabetes and is associated with both glomerular hypertrophy and microalbuminuria [83]. All components of the growth hormone/IGF system can be detected at
the mRNA level in the normal kidney. However, as detailed
histochemical studies have not been performed, the exact
location of system components with the glomerulus and the
likely role of particular cell types cannot be defined.
The rapid renal growth in experimental diabetes is
preceded by a rise in the renal concentration of IGF-1
[84]. Somatostatin analogues ameliorate the increase in
IGF-1 and renal hypertrophy and reduce AER [85]. In
human type 1 diabetes, serum growth hormone levels and
urinary IGF-1 levels are elevated and correlate with microalbuminuria, while an IGF-1 gene polymorphism modifies
the risk of development of microalbuminuria [86]. The
somatostatin analogue octreotide reduces macroalbuminuria
and endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes [87].
Taken together, this evidence points to a role for the
growth hormone/IGF system early in human diabetic
nephropathy. However, there are few clues to its contribution to the pathogenesis of microalbuminuria at the
structural level. IGF-1 activates intracellular intermediates,
including NFκB, and an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor suppresses VEGF production, suggesting that VEGF is a
downstream mediator of the effects of IGF-1 [88].
Proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines TNFα is a
proinflammatory cytokine with diverse actions, including
increased production of endothelial cell adhesion molecules
and IL-6, which in turn regulates CRP. TNFα also directly
increases endothelial permeability and disrupts the glycocalyx [41, 89]. In experimental diabetes, TNFα levels rise
in urine and the renal interstitium prior to the onset of
albuminuria and correlate with it [90], as they do in human
type 2 diabetes [91]. IL-6 levels also correlate with
albuminuria in type 1 and 2 diabetes [91, 92]. CRP, often
thought of as a downstream marker of inflammation, is
elevated in both type 1 and 2 diabetes [27, 93] and
correlates strongly with cardiovascular disease.
Adipokines, which include leptin and adiponectin (and,
arguably, TNFα and IL-6), also have the potential to
contribute to the development of microalbuminuria in both
non-diabetic and diabetic populations. Enlargement of fat
cells in obesity is associated with a generalised proinflammatory state, including increased levels of TNFα and IL-6,
and hypersecretion of adipokines, with the exception of
adiponectin, which is downregulated [94]. Leptin induces
vascular permeability and synergistically stimulates angiogenesis with VEGF [95]. Its serum levels correlate strongly
with nephropathy in type 2 diabetes [96]. Adiponectin,
unlike other adipokines, appears to have protective effects
in the vasculature in general by reducing endothelial cell
activation and inflammation.

Fig. 4 Proposed mechanism of glomerular filtration barrier damage
leading to diabetic microalbuminuria. High glucose causes dysregulation of mediators including TNFα and enhanced production of ROS,
which directly damage the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx leading
to microalbuminuria. Increased levels of pro-angiogenic molecules,
including VEGF and inflammatory mediators, induce an activated and
more permeable glomerular endothelial cell phenotype
Diabetologia (2008) 51:714–725 721

What do these changes in regulation and expression of
these mediators tell us about the mechanism of microalbuminuria? It is clear that ROS and oxidative stress have
a central role, given their importance in various metabolic
pathways and direct cellular effects, including in the
disruption of endothelial glycocalyx, which may be relevant
in pathogenesis of microalbuminuria. There is strong
evidence for a role of VEGF early in the course of diabetic
nephropathy, probably through upregulation of production
by podocytes and actions on glomerular endothelial cells
disrupting their contribution to the GFB. The importance of
dysregulation of angiogenic factors is emphasised by the
protective effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. The growth
hormone/IGF system is also dysregulated early in diabetes,
and it appears that IGF-1 is an important contributor to
microalbuminuria through VEGF. Involvement of inflammatory mediators again points to a role for glomerular
endothelial cells through endothelial activation, and hence,
an increase in permeability through disruption of the
glycocalyx.
Conclusions
In summary, the various avenues of study of diabetic
microalbuminuria reviewed converge on the glomerular
endothelium. Our analysis therefore leads to the conclusion
that this is the site of the initial damage that leads to the
development of microalbuminuria in diabetes. The most
important aspect of this damage is disruption of the
endothelial glycocalyx through actions of mediators dysregulated by the diabetic milieu. Key players include ROS,
VEGF and proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 4). Disturbance
of endothelial cell–podocyte communication contributes to
and amplifies the endothelial lesion. Progression of microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy is accompanied by
predictable structural changes in the glomerulus, including
podocyte damage and loss. This is the result of the ongoing
diabetic milieu and disturbed cell–cell communication, but
is also secondary to increased penetration of the GFB by
serum proteins [97].
Thus recent evidence remains broadly supportive of the
Steno hypothesis [4] but it points specifically to disturbance
of the endothelial glycocalyx as the common process
underlying both microalbuminuria and generalised endothelial dysfunction. While it would be overly simplistic,
particularly in type 2 diabetes, to suggest that this is the
only factor involved (Fig. 4), it follows nevertheless that
microalbuminuria is an indicator of generalised endothelial
dysfunction. Most interestingly, these conclusions imply
that glycocalyx dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis
of other vascular disease, both microvascular and macrovascular. Therefore, therapies aimed at protecting or
repairing endothelial cells and their glycocalyx would be
expected to retard these diseases. Reduction or reversal of
microalbuminuria implies resolution of generalised endothelial dysfunction and has potential to be a useful indicator
of successful reduction of overall cardiovascular risk [98].
