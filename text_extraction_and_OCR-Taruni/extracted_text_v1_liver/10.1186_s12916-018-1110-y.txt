Management of patients with liver diseases
on the waiting list for transplantation: a
major impact to the success of liver
transplantation
Didier Samuel* and Audrey Coilly
Abstract
Background: The results of liver transplantation are excellent, with survival rates of over 90 and 80% at 1 and
5 years, respectively. The success of liver transplantation has led to an increase in the indications for liver
transplantation. Generally, priorities are given to cirrhotic patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score on the principle of the sickest first and to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the principle
of priority points according to the size and number of nodules of HCC. These criteria can lead to a ‘competition’ on the
waiting list between the above patients and those who are cirrhotic and have an intermediate MELD score or with
life-threatening liver diseases not well described by the MELD score. For this latter group of patients, ‘MELD exception’
points can be arbitrarily given.
Discussion: The management of patients on the waiting list is of prime importance to avoid death and drop out from
the waiting list as well as to improve post-transplant survival rates. For the more severe cases who may swiftly access
liver transplantation, it is essential to rapidly determine whether liver transplantation is indeed indicated, and to
organise a fast workup ahead of this. It is also essential to identify the ideal timing for liver transplantation in
order to minimise mortality rates. For patients with HCC, a bridge therapy is frequently required to avoid progression of
HCC and to maintain patients within the criteria of liver transplantation as well as to reduce the risk of post-transplant
recurrence of HCC. For patients with cirrhosis and intermediate MELD score, waiting time can exceed 1 year; therefore,
regular follow-up and management are essential to maintain the patient alive on the waiting list and to achieve a
good survival after liver transplantation.
Conclusion: There is a diversity of patients on the waiting list for transplantation and equity should be preserved
between those with cirrhosis of high and intermediate severity and those with HCC. The management of patients
on the waiting list is an essential component of the success of liver transplantation.

Background
Liver transplantation plays a major role in the therapeutic path of liver diseases [1]. It concerns all patients
with end-stage liver disease when other medical therapies have failed as well as a high number of patients with
primary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). The success of liver transplantation over the past
years has been considerable, with more than 5000 being
performed annually in Europe, surmounting to more
than 140,000 liver transplantations in total [2]. Such success comes as a consequence of the absence of alternative therapies and of the good post-transplant survival of
approximately 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.
In Europe, liver donors are mainly of cadaver origin,
either following brain death or cardiac arrest, under the
Maastricht 3 procedure [1]. In contrast to living donor
transplantation, where the date of liver transplantation is
known in advance, in cadaveric donor liver transplantation the date of liver transplantation is unknown.
Therefore, the wait for transplantation can vary from a
few days in the case of acute liver failure patients to
more than 1 year for patients with cirrhosis of intermediate severity or those with HCC. The waiting lists
for liver transplantation are composed of three types of
patient. (1) Those with acute liver failure, included, in
most countries, in a super-emergency waiting list giving
them absolute priority over all other recipients, and receiving a transplant within hours or days [3]. (2) Those
with decompensated liver cirrhosis, included in the waiting list on the principle of the ‘sickest first’, based mainly
on the calculation of the Model for End Stage Liver
Diseases (MELD) score. Those with very high MELD
score may likely access liver transplantation within days
or a few weeks, whereas those with intermediate or low
MELD scores will access liver transplantation within
months or even years. (3) Those with HCC on compensated liver cirrhosis. Organ-sharing agencies assign these
patients an artificial score according to the number and
size of tumours, providing them access to liver transplantation within a maximum of 18 months. Since the
number of candidates on the waiting list is greater than
the offer of viable livers, there is some degree of competition between patients. Liver centres should manage
their patients according to their clinical situation and
the expected waiting time for liver transplantation. For a
patient with an end-stage liver disease, the procedure of
liver transplantation and the postoperative period remain a heavy procedure. Therefore, patients should be
carefully prepared physically and mentally to undergo
transplantation, much like an athlete preparing for the
Olympic games. The management of patients on the
waiting list is essential to avoid death or drop out due to
deterioration of their condition as well as to ensure that
patients are in the best physical condition possible prior
to the procedure – this is essential for the success of the
post-operative course.
Management of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis
In the USA, the MELD score has been implemented since
2002 as a score to prioritise access to liver transplantation
[4]. Most countries in Europe have implemented the
principle of the ‘sickest first’ to prioritise such access also
based on the MELD score, despite some differences between countries. The principle of the ‘sickest first’ is one
of justice and has achieved a reduction in mortality whilst
on the waiting list in most countries. However, there are
several inherent issues that must be addressed.
First, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, creatinine and international normalised ratio levels, is not
the holy grail [4–6]. Some patients with severe liver diseases are poorly represented by the MELD score, such
as, for example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who
have, until the very late stage, a low MELD score due to
normal international normalised ratio and creatinine
levels, patients with refractory ascites and otherwise preserved liver function, patients with chronic encephalopathy due to portacaval shunts, and patients with
hepatopulmonary syndrome. Thus, these patients should
be offered MELD exception points to provide them the
possibility to access liver transplantation [7].
Management of patients with high MELD score or in the
intensive care unit (ICU)
There is a debate regarding the high mortality risk after
liver transplantation in patients with a high MELD score
[8]. Some authors consider that transplantation in these
patients can be futile. On the one hand, the survival
benefit for these patients is extremely high as shown in
patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis or with
acute-on-chronic liver failure [9, 10]; on the other, the
high mortality rates after liver transplantation can be
considered a waste of organs [8]. The MELD score is
highly predictive of the risk of mortality on the waiting
list [4, 11]. Patients on the waiting list with a MELD
score of over 30 or 40 have an expected mortality rate of
more than 50 and 70%, respectively, within 3 months
[4]. Therefore, there is justification to prioritise these patients. In patients with very high MELD scores (> 35),
there is a risk of high post-transplant mortality and of
over indication for liver transplantation. There is a consensus that for scores up to MELD 35, post-transplant
survival remains unmodified. In patients with a MELD
score above 35, there is currently no consensus on the
potentially higher risk of post-transplant morbidity and
mortality [12]; however, the postoperative morbidity and
ICU length of stay are significantly higher [12, 13]. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with chronic liver
disease transplanted while in the ICU or soon after
Samuel and Coilly BMC Medicine (2018) 16:113 Page 2 of 5

recovery remains low (< 10%) [14]. There are several reasons for this. First, patients in the ICU are frequently not
evaluated for liver transplantation either because they are
not in a liver ICU or because liver transplantation is considered too risky and futile. Several authors have tried to
determine, through scores such as the Frailty scoring system [15] or other scores [16], the limits at which transplantation is futile. Our personal opinion is that this line
of futility is permanently evolving.
Considering the dramatic improvement of the results
of liver transplantation over the past years, we need to
be more reactive regarding the indication of liver transplantation in the most severe patients, i.e. those in the
ICU. When a patient is referred in a critical condition,
the very first question to address is: is this patient a potential candidate for liver transplantation? For alcoholic
cirrhotic patients, or for patients with acute alcoholic
hepatitis refractory to medical treatment, this will require an urgent workup, advice from a specialist in alcohol addiction, and a consensus decision from the team
[9]. When the decision for liver transplantation is taken,
patient prognosis should be assessed using ICU scores
rather than the MELD score [17, 18]. An urgent workup
to assess comorbidities is also required. The difficult
issue is the definition of the optimal window for transplantation in such severe cases. The risk is to perform
transplantation in patients without an adequate workup
at the worse moment. Therefore, coordination with the
ICU specialists in order to determine the appropriate
timing for liver transplantation is essential. The optimal
transplantation window between several complications is
difficult to determine, but essential for its success. This
transplantation window may be open during the ICU
stay or soon after recovery prior to the advent of the
next deteriorating event [19].
Management of patients with intermediate MELD score
In many countries, patients with a MELD score between
18 and 25 have difficulty obtaining access to liver transplantation. The waiting time for these patients is long
and may exceed 1 year, with a risk of acute deterioration
of their liver condition. The position of most
organ-sharing agencies is that patients will be offered
transplantation as soon as the MELD score increases.
However, some patients may deteriorate rapidly and die
following new gastrointestinal bleeding or a septic shock
episodes. The other option, not yet considered by
organ-sharing agencies, is to assign these patients additional points in relation to the length of waiting time on
the list, taking into account the natural history of liver
cirrhosis. We find it logical to provide such patients with
the possibility to increase their priority in the waiting
list. During this waiting time, patients should be
maintained in the best possible condition until
transplantation, being followed on a regular basis either
by the transplant centre or by the referring centre. For
this, several actions have to be taken, as follows: (1) in
hepatitis C virus cirrhotic patients, an antiviral treatment
with interferon-free direct antiviral agents should be discussed [20–22]; (2) patients should be regularly screened
with Doppler ultrasound of the liver for emergence of
HCC; (3) prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding by routine endoscopy should be performed; and (4) patients with
refractory ascites should be treated either by TIPS or by iterative paracentesis to avoid malnutrition and other complications of refractory ascites. Additionally, it has been
shown that physical activity during the waiting time is
beneficial for the patient and may improve its VO2 [23].
Management of patients with HCC
Patients with HCC on decompensated liver cirrhosis
may have access to transplantation through the MELD
score. However, most of the patients with HCC on the
waiting list have a compensated liver cirrhosis and a low
MELD score. Thus, these patients cannot get access to
liver transplantation through the MELD score. Therefore, patients with HCC on the waiting list will gain
points according to the size of the tumour and the number of nodules as well as waiting time duration. There
are some differences between countries, yet the principle
is highly similar. In general, no additional points are
given for TNM1 tumours (a single nodule below 2 cm)
where strategies other than liver transplantation should
be favoured (i.e. percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical
resection). In contrast, patients with TNM2 tumours will
gain points with waiting time. The time between listing
and transplantation depends on the number of points
given to these patients and may vary according to the
policy of the organ-sharing agencies. During this period,
the centres should have a strategy to limit or reduce
tumour growth in order to avoid drop out from the
waiting list. It has been shown that a bridge therapy for
HCC is necessary for projected waiting times of over
6 months. The treatment of HCC during this period
may have a double objective; first, to reduce the size and
number of active tumours in order to place patients
within the criteria for transplantation (downstaging of
the tumour) and, second, to reduce and avoid tumour
progression. The treatment strategies for HCC may include percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection of
some tumour nodules, transarterial chemoembolisation
and, in some cases, sorafenib [1]. The treatments can be
combined according to the type and the progression of
HCC. Despite these strategies, some patients will drop
out from the list due to the progression of HCC outside
the criteria for transplantation. The three main poor
prognosis factors in patients with HCC are the regular
increase of AFP, an AFP level of over 1000 ng/mL and
Samuel and Coilly BMC Medicine (2018) 16:113 Page 3 of 5

the invasion of the portal vein by the tumour [24, 25].
These factors can become a contraindication for liver
transplantation due to the high risk of recurrence after
liver transplantation.
Is there a competition on the waiting list between patients
with decompensated liver cirrhosis, patients with MELD
exceptions and patients with HCC?
Since the points assigned to patients with HCC are given
arbitrarily, there is a risk of disequilibrium in favour of
these patients depending on the weight given to these
points. It is true that, in most countries, the percentage
of patients on the waiting list with HCC is increasing,
and is currently at 30–40%. Such an increase is due to
the epidemiology of liver diseases, the increasing number of patients with HCC and the high benefit in survival by liver transplantation to patients with HCC. In
addition, the criteria for liver transplantation for HCC
have evolved. Since 1996, the Milan criteria (one nodule
of ≤ 5 cm or three nodules ≤ 3 cm without vascular invasion) were the validated criteria for liver transplantation
for HCC [26]. With these criteria, the recurrence of
HCC after liver transplantation was below 10%. The
Milan citeria are still the validated international criteria.
There is a push from several teams to expand these criteria. In France, the Milan criteria have been replaced by
the AFP score [24] . Therefore, several new criteria have
been proposed. The UCSF criteria (1 nodule ≤ 6.5 cm or
n ≤ 3 nodules ≤ 4.5 cm or total sum ≤ 8 cm) [27]; the up
to seven criteria (number of nodules + the maximum
size of the tumour without vascular invasion should be 7
at maximum) [28]; and the AFP score, taking into account the size, number of nodules and the level of AFP
(applied in France) [24].
Due to the improvement in efficacy of antiviral treatments, the number of patients with decompensated, hepatitis B and C virus liver cirrhosis is sharply declining [29].
In contrast, the number of patients with decompensated
liver disease due to alcoholic cirrhosis has shown no decreases, and the number of patients with decompensated
liver disease due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has been
increasing, as shown already in the USA [30].
Thus, it is highly important that organ-sharing agencies maintain a good balance between the different indications for liver transplantation, thus avoiding an
increase in mortality or drop out from the waiting list
for any one category of patients. It is important to provide liver transplantation access to the sickest patients
with decompensated liver diseases, as well as to patients
with HCC and those with decompensated cirrhosis and
intermediate MELD score. Some authors consider that
patients with MELD exceptions should be prioritised
over those with very high MELD scores. The perfect
equation does not exist, yet a real time assessment of
the dynamic of the waiting list by the organ-sharing
agencies is essential to maintain equity.
Conclusion
Physicians should indicate liver transplantation for those
who will gain the most benefit from it, and should optimise the management of these patients during the waiting period in order to reduce the rate of dropout and to
improve the results after liver transplantation. Finally,
given the shortage of organs, physicians should balance
the benefit for the society with those to individual patients. These should not be in opposition and we should
work on increasing the organ pool and access to liver
transplantation, as well as on improving the results of
liver transplantation.
