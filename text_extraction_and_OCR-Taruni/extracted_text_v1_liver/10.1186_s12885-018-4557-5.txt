Abstract
Background: The optimal therapeutic strategy in UICC stage T3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients that
maximizes both safety and long-term outcome has not yet been determined. Our aim was to compare clinical
outcomes following hepatic resection (HR) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for stage T3 HCC.
Methods: From 2005 to 2013, 1179 patients with T3 HCC who underwent HR or TACE were divided into two
groups, HR group (n = 280) or TACE group (n = 899). The clinical outcomes were compared before and after
propensity score matching.
Results: The propensity model matched 244 patients in each group for further analyses. After matching, medium
overall survival (OS), 1, 3, and 5-year OS rates in TACE group were 11.8 (95%CI, 9.9–13.7) months, 49.6, 16.5, and 8.
4%, respectively; which in HR group were 17.8 (95% CI, 14.8–20.8) months, 63.1, 33.3, and 26.4%, respectively; (log
rank = 19.908, P < 0.01). Patients in HR group were more likely to develop pleural effusion, compared with those in
TACE group (0.4% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.01). However, no significant differences in other adverse events (AEs) were found
between two groups. Similar results were also demonstrated prior to the matched analysis. Multivariate analysis
indicated that prothrombin time (PT), tumor size, tumor numbers, UICC staging status, and initial treatment were
independent prognostic factors.
Conclusions: Our study revealed that TACE was an option for UICC T3 HCC patients. However, HR seemed to be
safe and yield a survival benefit compared with TACE, especially for patients with a good underlying liver function.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the second
leading cause of cancer death worldwide so far, estimated to be responsible for around 9.1% of the total
cancer death [1]. It is the only cancer that mortality is
still increasing regardless of the evolution and progress
of anti-cancer therapy in North America [2]. As in
China, more than 50% new developed cases occurred in
this country alone, which usually arises as a result of a
chronic liver disease, especially hepatitis B virus (HBV)
related. Due to its greatly invasive malignant features,
HCC has a characteristic propensity to invade into portal vein, or to develop intra-hepatic metastasis, which
was regarded as one of the most adverse prognostic factors [3]. Although several staging systems have been
proposed for determining the stage and prognosis of
HCC, no consensus exists on the best classification system [2, 4]. Until now the Union for International Cancer
Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer
(UICC/AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging

system has still served as one of the most important
staging systems all over the world [4].
UICC stage (7th) T3 HCC was defined as multiple
lesions with any lesion larger than 5 cm (stage IIIa), or
involving a major portal vein or hepatic veins (stage
IIIb). According to Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC)
staging system, most UICC stage T3 HCC cases are
classified as being Stages B or C, therefore transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) or Sorafenib, rather than
hepatic resection (HR) are recommended as the optimal
therapy for patients in these stages in Europe or North
America [5]. However, therapy strategy may be a little
different in Asian-Pacific areas [2, 3, 6, 7]. Until now, it
seems difficult to reach a common consensus on the
indication of HR for HCC patients worldwide. Actually,
HR was reported to be performed beyond the BCLC
recommendations in about 50% of HCC patients with
BCLC stage B or C in Asia-Pacific areas [6, 8, 9]. It’s not
yet clear what is the optimal therapeutic strategy for
UICC stage T3 HCC patients. The aim of this study was
to compare the clinical outcomes following HR versus
TACE for UICC stage T3 HCC.
As we known, the underlying liver cirrhosis and tumor
characteristics make a significant contribution to the
prognosis of HCC patients. Without balancing the biases
of liver cirrhosis and tumor characteristics can cause
confusion. Therefore, non-randomized studies that compare the outcomes of HR and TACE in HCC patients
without balancing the biases should be interpreted cautiously. Methods of balancing co-variables are needed in
this specific setting. In nonrandomized studies, propensity score matching (PSM) is an optimal method of reducing the biases of treatment selection [10]. Compared
with the traditional adjustment methods (stratification
and covariance adjustment), PSM maximizes the covariate balance between groups and is free of the limitations
of adjusting a limited number of covariates at one time
[11]. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted PSM
to minimize the biases to assess long-term outcomes of
HR versus TACE for UICC stage T3 HCC.
Methods
Patients
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center and The
First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine. All recruited patients provided written informed consent before HR or TACE. Between
January 2005 and December 2013, 10,396 consecutive
patients with the diagnosis of HCC at the Department of
Hepatobiliary Oncology at Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center and the Department of Hepatobiliary
Surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou
University of Chinese Medicine were considered
amenable for this study. Of these, 1179 patients met the
inclusion criteria defined as that in the our previous
studies [3, 12]: (1) a confirmed diagnosis of HCC with
no previous treatment; (2) Chronic liver disease with
compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade, A or B) or
without underlying chronic liver disease; (3) multiple tumors with at least one lesion more than 5 cm or tumor
involving a major branch of the portal vein; (4) tumor lesions suit for potentially radical hepatic resection with a
negative resection margin. As we described in the previous articles [3, 12]. Briefly, the criteria of potentially radical hepatic resection in our study are as follows, the
tumor with multiple lesions localized in right or left
hemi-liver, or the main tumor localized in one lobe only
with a small solitary lesion in contralateral lobe, or
tumor involving a major branch (the first or second
branch) of the portal or hepatic vein (s), which could be
safely resected without grossly remaining tumors. That
was regarded as potentially radical hepatic resection. At
the same time, a well preserved postoperative liver function of patients was anticipated, which was assessed by
our surgical team according to the criteria defined in the
other previous article that remnant liver volume no less
than 250 ml/m2 [13] (Fig. 1).
The criteria of exclusion were as follows: (1) patients
that failed to perform hepatic resection or TACE, such
as serious concurrent medical illness, or platelet count
(PLT) less than 50 × 109
/L, or Child–Pugh grade C,
et al.; (2) other therapies, rather than HR or TACE,
used as the initial treatment; (3) lack of follow up or
incomplete data.

Strategies for hepatic resection and TACE
Hepatic resection strategy was defined as potentially radical resection, detailed in our previous reports [3, 12, 14].
Briefly, intraoperative ultrasonography was performed
routinely to assess the numbers and size of tumor lesions
and the relationship between tumors and vessels. Pringle’s
maneuver was routinely used with a switch of clamp and
unclamp time of 10 min and 5 min. Anatomic resection
was our preferred surgical method for multiple nodules.
For multiple bi-lobar nodules, anatomic resection was
conducted for the main tumor, whereas satellite nodules
were non-anatomically resected with a negative resection
margin. In order to preserve adequate post-operative liver
function, non-anatomic resection was performed with a
negative resection margin for some specific cases. The
negative resection margin was defined as in our previous
reports [3, 12, 14]. The en bloc technique was our preferable technique in the surgical management for the patients
with portal vein invasion [3]. TACE was carried out
using the same drug regimens and techniques that we
described previously [12, 15], and TACE was performed by four radiologists who each had 7–10 years
of experience with TACE.
Propensity score analysis
We conducted PSM to minimize the bias that arises
from patient backgrounds to assess the safety and
long-term outcome of HR versus TACE for UICC stage
T3 HCC. Possible variables associated with clinical characteristics of HCC patients, including age, gender, etiology, serum biochemistries, Child-Pugh (C-P) grade,
albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) level, tumor size, tumor numbers, and UICC stage were comprehensively selected for
one-to-one propensity score matching analysis.
Follow-up
Complications were defined as complications within the
90 days after treatment. Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events V3.0 were used to grade the severity
of adverse events and complications [16].
The time to progression (TTP), according to the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) dictionary of cancer
terms, was defined as the length of time from the date
of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease until
the disease starts to get worse or spread to other parts
of the body. We just used TTP to see how well TACE
worked in TACE group. But it was hard to used it in HR
group. The duration of follow-up was defined as the
interval between the date of HR or TACE, and the date
of death or the last time of follow-up. Data in this study
were censored on December 31, 2016. All patients were
followed up at an interval of 2–3 months during the first
2 years after initial therapy, then 3–6 months after
2 years. The Strategies of follow-up involved physical
examination, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), abdominal
color ultrasonography, and chest X-ray (optional).
Computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and/or hepatic angiography were conducted upon
suspicion of recurrence and/or metastasis. If necessary, biopsy under guidance of ultrasonography or CT was performed to confirm the diagnosis. The diagnosis of tumor
relapse or metastasis was based on the criteria for HCC
used by the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases (AASLD) [2]. The numbers and the location of
recurrent and/or metastatic HCC were recorded when the
diagnosis was established. The recommended therapy
strategies from our multidisciplinary team [3, 14], involving potentially radial therapies, such as hepatic resection,
radiofrequency ablation, microwave thermotherapy, even
liver transplantation; or loco-regional therapy such as
TACE, or Sorafenib, or systemic therapy for those recurrent or metastatic cases were determined by the characteristics of tumor lesions, performance status (PS), liver
function of the patients. Conservative treatments were
provided for patients with terminal HCC, liver function of
Child-Pugh grade C, or PS scores > 2.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 21.0 (IBM, New York, NY) software was applied to
analyze the data. Measurement data were expressed as
means ± standard deviations (SDs), and comparisons
among groups were analyzed by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) or t tests. Enumeration data were expressed
as rates, and comparisons among groups were analyzed
by chi-square tests. Matched package was used to produce the propensity score graphs. Co-variables entered
into the model included age, gender, etiology, liver function (including PT, ALB, TBL, C-P grade and ALBI
grade), tumor burden (AFP, tumor size, tumor numbers,
UICC stage) [17]. One-to-one match between HR group
and TACE group was obtained by use of the nearest
neighbor matching. In addition, a penalty was added
when the propensity scores differed by more than 0.2
times the SD. Survival curves were generated using the
Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Univariate
and multivariate analyses of overall survival using stepwise variable selection procedure of Cox regression
model was assessed. Differences with 2-sided P values of
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline of patient characteristics before and after PSM
We compared the baseline characteristics of patients who
received TACE (n = 899) and HR (n = 280) in Table 1.
The most frequent etiology was chronic hepatitis B
virus (HBV) in both the TACE and HR groups (90% vs.
88%, P = 0.216). Compared with patients in the year
from 2005 to 2009, more patients in the year from 2010
Zhong et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:643 Page 3 of 10

to 2014 received TACE (60% vs. 40%, P < 0.001). Compared with patients in HR group, patients in the TACE
group revealed older (51.0 vs. 48.8 years, P = 0.009), larger
tumors (9.5 cm vs. 8.5 cm, P < 0.001), more cases of more
than one lesion (81% vs. 57%, P < 0.001), more patients of
UICC stage IIIa (56% vs. 49%, P = 0.033). In particular,
patients in the TACE group have longer prothrombin time
(PT) (12.7 vs. 12.3 s, P < 0.001), higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (80.7 vs. 55.4 U/L, P < 0.001), lower
serum albumin (ALB) levels (40.0 vs. 41.1 g/l, P < 0.001),
less cases of C-P grade A (95% vs. 98%, P = 0.049) and less
cases of Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade 1 (52% vs. 69%,
P < 0.001). We conducted PSM analysis to minimize
the bias according to the methods recommended by
D’Agostino [10]. After matching, 488 patients (each group
244 patients) were matched and selected for further
analyses (Fig. 2). After matching, there were no significant
differences between the TACE and HR groups (Table 1).

Outcome and overall survival
Before matching, the median follow-up period was 36.8
(range, 1.1–137.1) months for the HR group and 25.7
(range, 0.9–134.4) months for the TACE group. Before
matching, the median procedures of TACE were (1.8 ±
1.2) procedures. 457 (50.8%) cases just took 1 procedure
of TACE, 264 (29.4%) and 101 (11.2%) cases took 2 and
3 procedures of TACE, respectively. 77 (8.6%) cases took
more than 3 procedures of TACE. 419 (46.6%) cases developed progress after initial TACE. In these cases, 186
(20.7%) cases developed lesion enlarging or new lesion
occurred. 233 (25.9%) cases developed distant metastasis
or vessel invasion or vessel invasion progressed. The
median TTP was 5.7 [95% confidence interval (CI),
(4.7–6.6)] months. There were 135 (15.0%), 93 (10.3%),
and 86 (9.6%) cases received heat ablation, resection,
and Sorafenib treatment after the initial treatment of
TACE, respectively (Table 2).
The medium overall survival (OS), 1, 3, and 5-year
OS rates were 10.9 (95% CI, 9.7–12.1) months, 47.1, 16.9,
and 10.3%, respectively, which were lower than those in
HR group significantly [18.0 (95% CI, 14.1–21.9) months,
63.7, 31.9, and 25.3%; log rank = 32.979, P < 0.01, Fig. 3].
After matching, the mean procedures of TACE were
(1.9 ± 1.2) procedures. Median TTP 7.7 (95% CI, 5.7–9.8)
months. 49 (20.1%) cases developed enlarged or new lesion in liver, whereas 60 (24.6%) cases developed metastasis or vessels invasion. There were 43 (17.6%), 27 (11.1%),
and 21 (8.6%) cases performed heat ablation, resection,
and Sorafenib after initial TACE, respectively (Table 2).
The medium OS, 1, 3, and 5-year OS rates in TACE group
were 11.8 (95% CI, 9.9–13.7) months, 49.6, 16.5, and 8.4%,
respectively, which were lower than those in HR group
significantly [17.8 (95% CI, 14.8–20.8) months, 63.1, 33.3,
and 26.4%; log rank = 19.908, P < 0.01, Fig. 4].
Safety and mortality
Adverse events (AEs) related to TACE and HR within
90 days after treatment are shown in Table 3. Before
matching, patients in the TACE group have less cases to
develop grade 3–4 edema (0.2% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.031), grade
3–4 of fever (1.8% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.01), grade 3–4 of ascites
(0.3% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.03), and pleural effusion (0.2% vs.

other AEs were found between two groups, including
grade 3–4 of pain, vomiting, upper gastrointestinal
hemorrhage (UGIH), postoperative hemorrhage (POH),
renal failure, liver dysfunction, and bile leakage. 2 and 3
cases developed treatment-related deaths (TRD) in TACE
and HR group, respectively (P = 0.09). After matching,
patients in HR group were more likely to develop pleural
effusion, compared with those of TACE group (0.4% vs.
5.3%, P = 0.01). However, no significant differences in
other AEs were found between two groups.
Univariate and multivariate analyses of overall survival
for patients before and after the PSM analysis
To investigate the impacts of patient demographics and
clinical characteristics on the outcomes of OS, the
variables listed in Table 1 were included in the univariate
and multivariate analysis. Before matching, in the multivariate analysis, the prothrombin time (PT) (hazard
ratio, HR = 1.167; 95%CI, 1.002–1.359; P = 0.047), AST
(aspartate aminotransferase) (HR = 1.232; 95% CI,
1.055–1.439; P = 0.008), ALBI (HR = 1.246; 95% CI,
1.084–1.431; P = 0.002), tumor size (HR = 1.235; 95% CI,
1.071–1.424; P = 0.004), tumor numbers (HR = 1.334;
95% CI, 1.098–1.620; P = 0.004), UICC stage (HR =
1.831; 95% CI, 1.545–2.171; P < 0.001), year of treatment
(HR = 0.869; 95% CI, 0.746–0.993; P = 0.039), and initial
treatment (HR = 0.677; 95% CI, 0.569–0.806; P < 0.001)
were identified as independent predictors of OS
(Table 4).

2.559; P < 0.001), and initial treatment (HR = 0.646;
95% CI, 0.522–0.798; P < 0.001) were identified as
independent predictors of OS after matching as
shown by the multivariate analysis.
Discussion
HCC is one of the most serious and life-threating health
problem worldwide [1]. To our knowledge, HBV or
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections is the most leading
cause of HCC [18]. As hepatitis B virus was prevalent in
China, the cases in our study were almost hepatitis B
related HCC. Although there are studies reveal that
HBV accelerate HCC via multiple mechanisms, most of
the important is that HCC usually developed in the presence of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and associated
with impaired liver function [19, 20]. As we known, the
long-term survival of HCC patients greatly depends on
the well-preserved liver function as well as early-stage
HCC. Although at least there are 18 HCC staging systems now available, UICC/AJCC TNM staging system
and BCLC staging system are both among the most
common HCC classification and scoring systems [4].
UICC/AJCC stage T3 (stage IIIa/IIIb) HCC patients,
which were considered as intermediate or advanced
stage in BCLC system, remains even extremely poor in
prognosis. Especially as for stage IIIb cases, portal vein
thrombosis develops extremely high portal hypertension
which at last results in life-threatening bleeding esophageal and/or gastric varices, liver dysfunction, intrahepatic
dissemination of HCC and/or distant metastasis.
The outcomes of treatments for those patients with
such advanced stage have been disappointing in a long

time. Curative options such as hepatic resection (HR),
liver transplantation (LT) or radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) were not recommended in Europe and North
America. Although TACE might offer improved overall
survival benefits in some non-randomized control trials, it
is not yet recommended by practice guidelines [21–23].
On the other hand, therapy choices for those patients in
such stage in Asian-Pacific areas may be pretty different.
Surgical resection was recognized as the last but not
least option for these patients to obtain long-term
survival [2, 3, 5, 6]. Several studies have reported that
radical resection of the tumor and involved vessels can
prolong survival and may eventually offer a chance of
cure in selected cases [3, 12, 24, 25]. However, even in
these areas, there is still controversy over optimum
treatment strategy for HCC patients in these stage,
regardless guidelines for practice. Although there were
several studies comparing en bloc with peeling off
technique in the resection for HCC with portal vein
tumor thrombus (PVTT), we conducted one of the
largest study population and longest follow-up data in
our previous study that demonstrated en bloc HR
yielded more preferable survival outcomes over peeling
off resection for HCC with PVTT [3, 26, 27]. In this
study, we demonstrated that hepatic resection contributed to better OS compared with TACE in UICC/AJCC
stage IIIa/IIIb HCC cases. The medium OS in HR
group were 17.8 m, which were 6 months longer than
that of TACE group (11.8 m). The 1, 3, and 5-year OS
in HR group was significantly higher than that of TACE
group, respectively, (log rank = 19.908, P < 0.01). Several
studies reported that the response rate to TACE was
around 40% with supra-selective technique, and the OS
of the patients after TACE treatment ranged from
16 months to 25 months and even 48 months in selective recent series [28, 29]. However, the response rate to
TACE was about 25% in this study. The median OS was
11 months (12 months after matching), which was consistent to the previous findings [15, 30, 31]. One of the
reasons might be that the clinical stage of the included
cases in this study was UICC stage T3 HCC. The mean
size of tumor was 9.5 cm, with more than one lesion in
most cases, or with portal vein involved. Kadalayil, et al.
[32] has reported a simple prognostic scoring system, the
Hepatoma arterial-embolization prognostic (HAP) score.
In this prognostic scoring system, patients with low
albumin (< 36 g/dl), high bilirubin (> 17 μmol/l) or
α-fetoprotein (AFP) (> 400 ng/ml), and large tumor size
(> 7 cm) were associated with increased risks of death
when underwent TACE. In this study, the HAP score
was a little bit high (albumin, 41.1 g/dl; bilirubin
17.8 μmol/l; tumor size, 8.6 cm; and 47% of cases with
AFP > 400 ng/ml). However, the clinical and pathologic
data in this study was consistent well with our previous

studies [3, 12, 14]. According to the guideline of
diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma of
China [33], the cases with UICC T3 HCC were suitable
for TACE treatment. Although before matching, more
than 50% of the patients received only one TACE session, and 50% of these patients had disease progression
after the session, the medium OS in TACE group was
10.9 (95% CI, 9.7–12.1) months, which was consistent
with other studies [34, 35].
The OS in HR group was lower than those reported in
other researches [36, 37]. However, the results in this
study were consistent with those we previously reported
[3, 12, 14]. One of the reasons might be that the patients
enrolled in our studies were at a more advanced stage.
Some patients with advanced HCC might benefit from
resection [38, 39]. In this study, 36% of the patients after
matching had one tumor, the most frequent liver disease
etiology was HBV infection, the median age of the patients was 49.5 y, and the platelet count was 200 × 109
/L
(which means no portal hypertension). In view of these
characteristics, a surgical management should be done.
Until now, there have been several studies and
meta-analysis accessing HR and TACE in the management
of intermediate or advanced stage of HCC [25, 40–44].
However, to our knowledge, the study we presented here
was one of the several studies to access the survival outcome of HR versus TACE in UICC/AJCC stage IIIa/IIIb
HCC patients [12, 45, 46]. Moreover, this study comprised
the largest study population and presented the longest
follow-up data reported to date [3, 12, 25–37]. At last but
not least, our findings were obtained after PSM which
balanced patient demographics, liver functions, and tumor
characteristics between two groups. Therefore, it provided
us the most important data that might be used to establish
an optimal strategy for the management of UICC stage
IIIa/IIIb HCC patients.
In terms of safety, our study revealed that either HR
or TACE was generally well tolerated and just several
manageable adverse events occurred in patients with
UICC stage T3 HCC patients. Although patients in
TACE group were less likely to develop grades 3–4
edema, ascites, and pleural effusion before matching,
patients in HR group were more likely to develop pleural
effusion after matching. These were similar to those results reported in the previous studies [3, 12, 25, 45–48].
In this study, we performed univariate and multivariate
analysis to examine demographics and clinical characteristics associated with prognosis. Although Cox analysis
showed that PT, tumor size, tumor numbers, UICC stage
were independent prognostic factors, the hazard ratio
was just a little scale, which seemed to be not so clear
advantage for either arm. On the other hand, initial
treatment of hepatic resection yielded a hazard ratio of
0.646 over TACE, which meant there was a 35.6%
reduction in risk of death in HR group, that was a clear
advantage in HR arm. Although Kadalayil, et al. [32]
reported that α-fetoprotein (AFP) (> 400 ng/ml) was
associated with increased risks of death when underwent
TACE, in this study, the AFP level was not an independent
prognostic variable. Other studies suggested some risk
factors for OS in UICC stage T3 HCC, such as ALB
< 3.5 g/dL, tumor size more than 55 mm, multiple tumors,
peeling off thrombectomy in HR, and treatment option
of TACE alone, et al [3, 14, 46, 47] These observations
were partly compatible with our current results. Not
surprisingly, patients with long-term OS were more
likely to have normal PT time, smaller tumors, and less
likely to be multiple tumors.
Due to retrospective study, our study ineluctably had
some limitations. The most significant one was lack of a
well-balanced randomization. The treatment choices
were recommended by our Multiple Disciplinary Team
(MDT) in consideration of various clinical features and
guidelines available, which were more likely to increase
the possibility of unbalanced treatment allocation
through the treatment distribution and potential selection bias occurred. Although some studies revealed that
propensity scores matching (PSM) methods was not necessarily superior to conventional covariate adjustment,
it was still an increasingly popular method to balance
bias in observational studies [49]. Therefore, the problem of imbalance was supposed to be partially addressed
by using propensity score matching that yielded similar
baseline characteristics between two groups. Among the
risk factors of OS, an additional analysis to define a subgroup which is really saved by HR compared to TACE in
even UICC T3 HCC would give more practical information for the treat. However, we did not perform the subgroup analysis. This is the second limitation of this study.
Conclusions
Our study revealed that TACE was an option for UICC
stage T3 HCC patients. However, potentially radical
hepatic resection (HR) yielded a result of overall survival
advantage on TACE for UICC stage T3 HCC patients.
Therefore, HR seemed to represent the optimal therapy
strategy for the management of UICC stage T3 HCC and
should be recommended as a preferable treatment especially for patients with a good underlying liver function.
