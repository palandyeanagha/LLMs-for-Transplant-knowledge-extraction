Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► The gut microbiota in some subgroups of 
patients with IBS is different from healthy 
controls.
► In Clostridium difficile infections, faecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown 
excellent effects.
What are the new findings?
► This is the first large randomised controlled trial 
assessing the efficacy and safety of FMT in IBS 
with data on changes in the gut microbiota.
► FMT can change the gut microbiota in patients 
with IBS, but has less effect on symptoms and 
quality of life compared with placebo.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► This study does not show evidence for effective 
treatment of IBS with FMT, despite long-term 
changes in gut microbiota after FMT was 
shown in these patients.
► More research regarding the effect of FMT in 
IBS subgroups is needed before the real impact 
of FMT in IBS is known.
Abstract
Objective IBS is associated with an intestinal dysbiosis 
and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been 
hypothesised to have a positive effect in patients 
with IBS. We performed a randomised, double-blind 
placebo-controlled trial to investigate if FMT resulted in 
an altered gut microbiota and improvement in clinical 
outcome in patients with IBS.
Design We performed this study in 52 adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe IBS. At the screening visit, 
clinical history and symptoms were assessed and faecal 
samples were collected. Patients were randomised to 
FMT or placebo capsules for 12 days and followed for 6 
months. Study visits were performed at baseline, 1, 3 and 
6 months, where patients were asked to register their 
symptoms using the IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) 
and IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QoL). Prior to each 
visit, faecal samples were collected.
Results A significant difference in improvement in 
IBS-SSS score was observed 3 months after treatment 
(p=0.012) favouring placebo. This was similar for IBSQoL data after 3 months (p=0.003) favouring placebo. 
Patients receiving FMT capsules had an increase in faecal 
microbial biodiversity while placebos did not.
Conclusion In this randomised double-blinded 
placebo-controlled study, we found that FMT changed 
gut microbiota in patients with IBS. But patients in 
the placebo group experienced greater symptom relief 
compared with the FMT group after 3 months. Altering 
the gut microbiota is not enough to obtain clinical 
improvement in IBS. However, different study designs and 
larger studies are required to examine the role of FMT
in IBS.
Trial registration number NCT02788071.
Introduction: bac kground and
objectives
IBS is the most commonly diagnosed GI condition, 
and affects up to one in five people at some point 
during their lives.1
 In accordance with the Rome III 
criteria,2
 IBS is characterised by abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain and altered bowel function, 
without alarm symptoms such as blood in stools 
and weight loss. IBS can be further categorised into 
diarrhoea-predominant, constipation-predominant 
or mixed type.1
Many theories have been put forward but the 
exact cause of IBS is still uncertain. The complexity 
and diversity of IBS presentation makes treatment 
difficult.
Current evidence suggests that the microbiota 
of the GI tract could be a significant factor in the 
aetiology of IBS.3
 Changes in the intestinal environment are hypothesised to induce a compositional 
imbalance of the gut microbiota, termed ‘dysbiosis’, which is associated with IBS.4
 Several studies 
have demonstrated that the composition of the gut 
microbiota in patients with IBS is different from 
healthy controls.5

Gut microbiota
several diseases, including IBS, is growing rapidly. Human faeces 
from healthy donors contain more than a 100 different types of 
bacteria, along with parasites, viruses, fungi and bacteriophages, 
which may also play a significant role. In recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infections, FMT has shown excellent effects. FMT has a 
much higher cure rate than standard treatment6
 and studies have 
shown that FMT might restore intestinal microbial balance in 
treated patients.7–11 FMT has, in smaller studies, been shown to 
be able to create lasting changes in the colonic microbiota, which 
can be detected up to 6months after the treatment.12
FMT could therefore theoretically be a possible treatment for 
patients with IBS.
To date, one randomised placebo-controlled study and only 
few other smaller, non-randomised placebo-controlled studies 
have evaluated whether FMT is effective in patients with IBS.13 14
To clarify the effects of FMT on symptoms and gut microbiota in 
patients with IBS, we performed this randomised, double-blind 
placebo-controlled pilot study.
Methods
Trial design
Patients were included in a 6-month randomised double-blind 
placebo-controlled study and allocated to treatment with 
FMT capsules or placebo capsules. Twenty-five capsules were 
consumed while fasting every morning for 12 days. Before the 
first treatment, the participants had a bowel cleansing with 
Picoprep performed corresponding to the procedure before a 
colonoscopy.
All patients were seen for study visits at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 
months, where they completed the IBS-severity scoring system 
(IBS-SSS)15 and IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QoL).16 17 Additionally, patients were asked to keep a daily diary including 
Bristol Stool Form Scale,18 symptoms, use of laxatives and side 
effects of the treatment, if any.
The primary end point was to evaluate the reduction of 
IBS-SSS in the treatment group compared with the placebo 
group at 3 months. Secondarily, we evaluated change in IBS-QoL 
scores at 3 months and changes in microbiota diversity before 
and after FMT.
Participants
Adult patients with IBS (aged 18–60 years) were recruited 
between October 2016 and December 2016 from the Department of Gastroenterology, Aleris-Hamlet Hospitals Copenhagen, 
Søborg, Denmark and Department of Gastroenterology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Patients were diagnosed with IBS according to Rome III criteria.2
In addition, criteria were as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
► Moderate-to-severe disease activity (IBS-SSS ≥175);
► Able to read and speak Danish;
► Normal colonoscopy (performed within 1year) if the patient 
was ≥40 years or if the patient had blood in stool.
Exclusion criteria:
► Other chronic GI disease;
► Faecal sample positive for enteropathogenic microorganisms;
► Positive screening for HIV, HBV or HCV antibody;
► Surgical interventions in the GI region (except for appendectomy, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and gynaecological and 
urological procedures);
► Psychiatric disorder;
► Faecal calprotectin ≥50mg/kg;
► Abuse of alcohol or drugs;
► Medications other than birth control pills, hormone 
supplements, allergies/asthma agents, blood pressure and 
cholesterol-lowering agents, proton pump inhibitors and 
non-prescription medicines;
► Abnormal screening biochemistry;
► Abnormal colonoscopy findings;
► Pregnant, planned pregnancy or breastfeeding females;
► Ingestion of probiotics or antibiotics <8 weeks before the 
inclusion.
Furthermore, all patients were subclassified in three different 
IBS subtypes: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhoea-predominant (IBS-D) or alternating periods of constipation and 
diarrhoea (IBS-M).18 Demographic information was obtained 
in all participants and they reported their current use of medications and completed questionnaires to characterise their 
symptom severity and bowel habits. The patients were asked to 
live as they used to through the half year study period.
Only a few patients fulfilling inclusion criteria declined 
participation.
Donors
Four faecal donors were recruited to this study. Once recruited, 
the donors were instructed to keep up a healthy lifestyle during 
the collecting period. They were all screened according to guidelines19 20 and were recruited according to the following criteria:
Inclusion criteria:
► Aged between 18 and 45 years;
► Previously and currently healthy;
► Normal weight (body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 
24.9kg/m2
);
► Normal bowel movements (defined as 1–2 per day and type 
3–4 at Bristol Stool Form Scale);
► No medication consumption.
Exclusion criteria:
► Known or high risk of infectious diseases such as HIV, HAV, 
HBV or HCV;
► Positive stool sample for C. difficile toxin, parasites or other 
enteropathogens;
► Antibiotic treatment in the past 6 months;
► Abuse of alcohol or drugs;
► Smoking;
► Tattoo or body piercing within the last 6 months;
► Allergy, asthma or eczema;
► Family history of GI diseases, cancer, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases, allergy, asthma, eczema, cardiovascular 
diseases, neurologic or mental illnesses;
► Participation in high-risk sexual behaviours;
► Born by caesarean section.
Sample preparation
Donors were equipped with 500mL bottles of oxygen reduced 
sterile saline (0.9% NaCl), which they were instructed to keep 
refrigerated. Immediately after producing the sample, donors 
were instructed to cover the sample in the oxygen reduced 
saline to protect the sample from oxygen and to deliver it to 
our facility within 1hour. Thereafter, the sample was stored at 
5°C and processed in the laboratory no more than 3hours later 
from the time of delivery. Samples with saline were homogenised 
manually, using a 400mL BagPage XR from Interscience with a 
250µm filter to remove undigested fibrous material and centrifuged at 3000x g for 20min at room temperature to remove 
the added saline. In this way we obtained a more concentrated 
product. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was mixed

with glycerol as a cryoprotectant to a final concentration of 30% 
glycerol. The effect of glycerol 30% in the FMT capsules was for 
freeze protection. With a lower amount of glycerol our capsules 
dissolved at −20°C. Most of the process was done in an anaerobic environment, using Argon gas to protect the sample. Faecal 
matter was briefly exposed to oxygen only while being transferred between containers. Finally, the samples were frozen at 
−20°C. Once donors had passed the second screening, all faecal 
samples were mixed into one batch for the entire experiment 
before being double encapsulated using Capsugel DR Caps size 
0 and 00. One daily dosage of 25 such capsules contains approximately 12 g of the frozen faecal matter, which was derived from 
approximately 50 g of fresh faeces.
Interventions
FMT were in capsule form, packaged in plastic bottles. FMT and 
placebo capsules were identical in appearance: form, colour and 
size. Placebo capsules where made from saline, glycerol and food 
colouring E150. Also the placebo contained 30% glycerol. The 
identity of the capsules was unknown to participants, researchers 
and primary investigators. Participants were instructed to 
consume orally 25 capsules per day in the morning with water. 
It was allowed to eat an hour after capsule intake to ensure that 
most of the capsules had passed the stomach. The first daily dose 
was taken under supervision at the Department of Gastroenterology, Aleris-Hamlet Hospitals Copenhagen, where the study 
visits took place.
Faecal sample collection
Faecal samples were longitudinally collected from patients at 
baseline before bowel cleansing, 3 days after FMT treatment had 
stopped, and 1, 3 and 6 months after inclusion. The collected 
fresh faeces were stored in RNA later by the patients and brought 
to the hospital at study visits.
Library preparation and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of faecal samples using a 
PowerLyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio 12855–50) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified using primers 
341F and 806R and indexed Illumina compatible 16S amplicon 
libraries were prepared as described elsewhere.21 Paired end 
sequencing (2×301bp) was performed on the Illumina MiSeq 
platform with the MiSeq Reagent kit V.3.
Sequence processing and microbiomics analysis
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq V.2.17.1.14 
(Illumina). Primer sequences were striped from the 5’ ends 
of each read in a pair and reads without discernible primer 
sequences were discarded using a custom Biopython script. 
Reads were processed with the UPARSE pipeline using usearch 
V.10.0.240_i86linux32 to generate an operational taxonomic 
unit (OTU) table at 97% granularity.22 The UPARSE-pipeline 
was modified, replacing the ‘read quality filtering’ and ‘length 
trimming’ steps with an alternative quality filtering (usearch 
-fastq_filter -maxee 1.0).23
Usearch was also used to construct an OTU tree and assign 
taxonomy to the OTUs’ centroids24 25 using the ribosomal database project reference 16S training set with species names (V.16) 
as a reference database. Taxonomy assignments were added to 
the OTU table with a custom Python script and the OTU table 
with taxonomy information was converted into biom format 
using biom.26 Diversity metrics were calculated using the Qiime 
V.1.9.1 core_diversity_analyses.py27 pipeline using a sampling 
depth of 5000 and default parameters otherwise.
OTU abundances in pairs of samples were assessed for significant differences using the Mann-Whitney U test, corrected 
for multiple sampling with the Benjamini-Hochberg method 
(FDR=5%). Correlations between IBS-SSS and OTU abundances and correlations between IBS-SSS and α-diversity were 
assessed using Spearman-Rank correlation analysis, corrected 
for multiple sampling with the Benjamini-Hochberg method 
(FDR=5%). Significant differences in α-diversity (chao1 metric) 
between treatment groups were assessed using the MannWhitney U test (p≤0.05). Differences in β-diversity distances 
were assessed using a Mann-Whitney U test (p≤0.01). SourceTracker was used to infer the proportions of microbial communities that come from possible source environments.28
Ethics
The study was performed in accordance with the requirements of Good Clinical Practice and the Revised Declaration 
of Helsinki. The study was registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT02788071). All participants provided written informed 
consent to participate after verbal and written information 
about the study. Participants could discontinue at any time 
point on their request. As FMT, according to the Danish Health 
Authority, is not considered as a pharmaceutical, no authorisation by the Danish Medicines Agency was required. All authors 
had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final 
manuscript.
Outcomes
Sample size
We aimed to include 52 participants based on an effect of 
placebo of 0.40 and an effect of FMT of 0.80, with a power 
(1-β) of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.05 (two-tailed test) for intentionto-treat analysis.
Sample size was estimated assuming that 40% and 80% of 
patients in the placebo and FMT group, respectively would 
achieve the primary end point criteria at 3 months after inclusion.
Randomisation
Patients were randomised 1:1 to FMT capsules or placebo 
capsules and included by consecutive numbers. The randomisation was done in blocks of 4 by a researcher, not involved in 
the patients’ treatment and was generated by using the website 
Randomization.com ⟨http://www.randomization.com⟩. Investigators, patients and outcome assessors were kept masked to the 
allocation and intervention. The randomisation key was revealed 
to the researchers when participants completed the 6-month 
follow-up and data analysis was completed.
Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were done in RStudio (RStudio Team 
(2016). RStudio: Integrated Development for R. RStudio, 
Boston, Massachusetts, USA; http://www.rstudio.com/). The 
number, percentage, mean, SD, mean difference and 95% 
CIs were reported. The IBS-QoL score was transformed into 
a 0–100 scale using the formula: total score=(sum of the 
items−34/170)×100. Student’s t-test was used to determine 
the difference between placebo and FMT. A paired t-test and a 
repeated measure analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA), was used to 
determine, within each group, the difference between inclusion 
and 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up. All tests were done for both 
IBS-SSS and IBS-QoL. Spearman’s test was used to determine

the correlation between IBS-SSS and IBS-QoL. A score between 
0 and 0.19 was interpreted as very weak, 0.20 and 0.39 as weak, 
0.40 and 0.59 as moderate, 0.60 and 0.79 as strong and 0.8 and 
1 as very strong.
Two-way ANOVA was used to determine factors associated 
with decrease in either IBS-SSS or IBS-QoL score. If interaction 
was found between variates, a linear regression model was used 
instead, controlled by quantile-quantile plot of residuals.
Furthermore, a cut-off of 50 points15 reduction after 3 months 
in the IBS-SSS was used to distinguish between ‘effect’ and ‘no 
effect’. This end point was analysed using the χ2
 test. A logistic 
regression was used to determine associated factors for ‘effect’. 
Age, gender, BMI, previous or concurrently used IBS medical 
therapy, birth by caesarean section, breast feeding, IBS subtype, 
previous attempt with change in diet and weight loss were used 
as independent variables.
Measures
IBS disease severity was measured by using the IBS-SSS questionnaire,15 which includes five items on a 0–100mm visual analogue 
scale with total score ranging from 0 to 500mm. Question 1: 
severity of abdominal pain, question 2: frequency of abdominal 
pain, question 3: severity of abdominal distension, question 4: 
dissatisfaction with bowel habits and question 5: interference 
with quality of life.
Alterations in quality of life during the study were measured 
by IBS-QoL questionnaire, which consists of 34 items, each 
with a 5-point response scale. The 34 items are based on the 
following eight variables: health worries, food avoidance, body 
image, dysphoria, interference with activity, social reactions, 
sexual activity and relationships.17
Results
Patient characteristics
Overall, 52 patients were included in the study and randomised 
into two groups of 26 patients.
Patients in the two groups were comparable (table 1).
Only one patient dropped out while in the study, with no 
reason given. Other participants were excluded from the analysis 
due to the exclusion criteria (figure 1).
When participants were asked whether they were treated with 
FMT or placebo, only 25 patients guessed correctly (14 correctly 
guessed placebo and 11 correctly guessed FMT).
Disease severity (IBS-SSS)
The primary end point showing a significant difference in 
improvement between inclusion and the 3-month visit (mean 
(SD), FMT vs placebo; −52.45 (97.72) vs −125.71 (90.85), 
p=0.012) favouring the placebo group (table 2 and figure 2). 
The IBS-SSS score difference and score change over time at 
inclusion, 1, 3 and 6 months between placebo and FMT are 
shown in table 2 and figure 2.
The differences in scores between inclusion and 1, 3 and 
6months within each group were all statistically significant 
(data shown in online supplementary) and rm-ANOVA; FMT: 
p<0.01, placebo: p<0.01. No associated factors were found in 
the linear regression model or in the logistic regression model 
for a score change of 50 and above.
Eight (36.4%) of 22 patients receiving FMT capsules vs 19 
(79.2%) of 24 receiving placebo capsules showed a decrease in 
IBS-SSS of more or equal to 50 point at 3 months after inclusion 
(p=0.008).
Subgroup analysis in the different IBS types (IBS-C, IBS-D 
and IBS-M) at the 3 months visit showed higher improvement 
in IBS-SSS in the placebo group in all subgroups; however, a 
statistically significant effects was only seen among patients with 
IBS-C; mean (SD) FMT 42.2 (40.07) and placebo 149.12 (85.4) 
(p=0.025) (see online supplemental material table 2).
Quality of life (IBS-QoL)
The IBS-QoL score difference and score change over time 
between placebo and FMT are shown in table 2 and figure 2; 
showing a significant difference in improvement between FMT 
and placebo at 3 months (mean (SD) FMT vs placebo; −7.22

(10.12) vs −16.50 (9.60), p=0.003) favouring the placebo 
group.
Likewise, the placebo group has a significantly better change 
in IBS-QoL score at 1 and 6 months compared with the FMT 
group. The improvements within FMT and placebo groups 
(separately) were all significant by both paired t-test (data shown 
in online supplemental material table 1) and rm-ANOVA; FMT: 
p<0.01, placebo: p<0.01. No associated factors were found in 
the ANOVA.
The correlation between IBS-SSS and IBS-QoL was found 
to be 0.71 by Spearman’s correlation coefficient and therefore 
strong.
Side effects
The majority of the patients experienced side effects (22 (84.6%) 
in the FMT group and 15 (57.7%) in the placebo group (table 3).
There were no side effects that were more prominent in the

No serious adverse events were reported.
Microbiome analysis
A total of 8.3 million MiSeq paired reads were obtained, of
which 7.7 million were classified into 2747 OTUs. Analysis of
α-diversity showed that (i) faecal donors had higher microbiome biodiversity than patients with IBS (FMT and placebo 
groups separately) at inclusion, (ii) patients receiving FMT 
capsules had an increase in biodiversity to the extent that this 
group was not statistically distinguishable from the donors 
and (iii) the placebo patients remained statistically indistinguishable from their pretreatment state (Mann-Whitney U test, 
p<0.05, figure 3). In patients with IBS (FMT, placebo and at 
inclusion groups), α-diversity did not correlate with IBS-SSS 
(Spearman's rank correlation test; R=−0.050, p=0.442). 
Even while assessing subgroups of the data (IBS-C, IBS-D 
or IBS-M, and FMT or placebo), there were no correlations 
between IBS-SSS and α-diversity.
Source tracking software28 inferred that a larger proportion of 
the FMT groups’ microbiotas originated from the FMT donors’ 
microbiotas in contrast with the placebo group (p<0.01 for all 
time points) (see online supplemental material figure 1). Correspondingly, a much larger proportion of the placebo groups’ 
microbiotas, in comparison with the FMT groups’ microbiotas, 
were inferred to have originated from the patients’ own microbiotas at initial assessment (p<0.01 for all time points) (see online 
supplemental material figure 1).
Analysis of β-diversity (unweighted UniFrac) ordinated using 
principal coordinate analysis showed that the donors grouped 
close together at the edge of the ‘cloud’ of the microbiotas of 
patients with IBS at inclusion figure 4A, figure 4B. At all time 
points, the FMT recipients’ microbiotas had a higher density in 
the vicinity of the donors’ microbiotas (figure 4C), while the 
placebo recipients’ microbiotas, also at all time points, were 
dispersed over the cloud of the patients at inclusion (figure 4D). 
Statistical analysis of unweighted UniFrac pairwise distances 
(p<0.01) confirmed that FMT recipients’ microbiotas are more 
similar to the donors’ microbiotas than to the placebo recipients’ 
microbiotas. Furthermore, the placebo recipients’ microbiotas 
did not become more similar to the donors’ microbiotas than 
patients with IBS before randomisation. This confirms that treatment with FMT capsules caused the recipients’ microbiotas to 
more closely resemble the donors’ microbiotas.
Analysis of OTUs between donors, patients at inclusion, 
patients 3 months after FMT treatment and patients 3 months 
after placebo treatment, revealed that 11 OTUs established in 
FMT recipients (see online supplemental material table 3). The 
criteria for this depended on the donors having significantly 
more of the OTU than the patients at inclusion, the FMT-treated 
patients having significantly more of the OTU than the patients 
at inclusion and the placebo patients not having significantly 
different levels of the OTU to the patients at inclusion. By corresponding criteria, we showed that no OTUs established ‘from 
donors’ in the placebo patients, indicating a high-likelihood that 
the OTUs seen to establish in the FMT patients originated from 
the FMT capsules and not from other natural means of acquiring 
new intestinal microbes. Of these 11 OTUs, 6 were classified in 
the Clostridiales order and 4 in the Bacteroidales order.
Two OTUs had weak (0.16≤R<0.30) negative correlations 
with IBS-SSS, one OTU had a weak positive correlation with 
IBS-SSS and two OTUs had moderate (0.3≤R<0.5) positive 
correlations with IBS-SSS. None of these OTUs showed any 
significant changes in abundance due to FMT treatment. The 
two OTUs correlating negatively with IBS-SSS were both classified in the Blautia genus of the Clostridiales order which is associated with a healthy gut-microbiome.29–31 Of the three OTUs 
with positive correlations with IBS score, one was classified in 
the Bacteroides genus and two were classified in the Ruminococcaceae family. Neither of these groups has any particularly 
negative associations with health as they are extremely common 
inhabitants of the healthy human GI tract.
Discussion
In this study, we tested the use of FMT in 52 patients with IBS 
and characterised their faecal microbiotas before and after the 
treatment. Previously, FMT has been reported to reduce IBS

symptoms in smaller not blinded studies13 and one RCT.14
Our study, however, is one of the first randomised doubleblind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of orally 
administered FMT capsules in patients with IBS with moderate 
to severe symptoms. No other RCT has either examined the 
composition of gut microbiota in donors and patients and the 
change in microbiota composition before and after FMT in 
patients with IBS.
Overall, a reduction of IBS symptoms was found in both FMT 
and the placebo group, but our results show a significantly better 
effect of placebo compared with FMT treatment on improvement in IBS-SSS after 3 months, which was our primary end 
point. Likewise, the improvements in IBS-QoL scores were 
significantly better in the placebo group 1, 3 and 6 months after 
inclusion.
The microbiome results showed that our patients with IBS 
had lower stool microbial biodiversity than the healthy donors 
(figure 3) and in an ordinated β-diversity analysis, the donors’ 
microbiotas had a ‘cloud’ on the periphery of a comparatively 
larger cloud of patients with IBS (pretreatment) (figure 4B). 
These observations support the view3
 that there is a relationship of unknown causality between IBS and the intestinal microbiota. The consumption of FMT capsules was associated with 
an increase in stool microbial biodiversity above that seen in the

Gut microbiota
Figure 4 Principal coordinate analysis-ordinated β-diversity plots (unweighted UniFrac distances) show that FMT capsules make the FMT group’s 
microbiotas look more similar to the donors’ microbiotas. (A) The pretreatment microbiotas of patients with IBS are dispersed in a ‘cloud’. (B) The 
healthy donors group together around the bottom left of the IBS cloud of patients with IBS. (C) The post-treatment FMT groups’ microbiotas are 
dispersed throughout the cloud of patients with IBS, but show a higher density near the donors' microbiotas. (D) The post-treatment placebo groups’ 
microbiotas are dispersed evenly around the pretreatment cloud. The first three principal axes are presented, with PC1 (horizontal) explaining 10.37%, 
PC2 (coming out of page) explaining 7.19% and PC3 (vertical) explaining 4.56% of the variation. The four individual donors’ microbiotas and two 
mixtures of the donors’ microbiotas are represented by the six points labelled as ‘donor’ in the legend, while statistical tests comparing donors with 
other groups used only data from the four individual donors for comparisons.
placebo control group and the FMT capsules also resulted in 
the establishment of several OTUs in the recipients that did not 
establish in the placebo group. Ordination of β-diversity indicated that microbiotas of patients with IBS resembled donors’ 
microbiotas more closely following FMT capsule treatment and 
a microbiota source tracking software indicated that the FMT 
capsules brought about a long-term (at least 6 months) establishment of donor microbes in the recipients. These observations, 
in addition to the increase in biodiversity and the establishment 
of OTUs in the FMT treatment group, clearly demonstrate that 
the FMT capsules are having a lasting effect on the recipients’ 
microbiotas. However, these changes to the microbiotas did not 
improve the clinical prognoses of the recipients in any way. The 
low number of OTUs that had any correlation, positive or negative, with IBS score and the complete lack of correlation between 
α-diversity and IBS score indicate that there is no simple characteristic of the intestinal microbiota playing a role in IBS.
The strength of this study is that the patients could not guess 
what treatment they received, which is proof that the blinding 
was sufficient. None of our patients experienced serious adverse 
events. For this reason, we find the procedure feasible and safe 
in patients with GI symptoms.
However, limitations need to be taken into consideration. 
One such limitation could be that we included all IBS subtypes. 
The study by Johnsen et al14 focused on IBS-D and IBS-M. The 
study showed that FMT induced significant symptom relief in 
patients with IBS, but no data on changes in the microbiota 
were presented. Nevertheless, subgroup analyses in our study 
indicate that the IBS-D subgroup did not do better than the 
other subgroups. We used a donor-mix of FMT were Johnsen et 
al used single donor FMT. This could also influence the results. 
Perhaps donor mix is not preferable. In the review of previous 
smaller studies of FMT in IBS, an improvement was described 
in 74% of participating patients with IBS.13 This impressive 
result could possibly be explained by inclusion of only specific 
IBS subtypes (such as IBS-D) in some of these studies. However, 
all studies reviewed were without placebo control, making the 
improvement rate of 74% less reliable and difficult to compare 
both with our study and the study by Johnsen et al.14 Our 
capsules contained glycerol and we cannot exclude that glycerol 
had influenced bowel physiology and could have affected the 
outcome of the study. But both the FMT and placebo capsules 
contained glycerol.
Although our study shows a better effect of a bowel cleansing 
than a bowel cleansing followed by a FMT treatment on IBS 
symptoms, we still believe that FMT can be the way forward. 
Maybe the treatment should be approached in a different way. 
Could FMT counteract a possible positive effect of bowel 
cleansing? Maybe certain IBS harmful bacteria or other microbes 
could be lost during bowel cleansing and then reintroduced by 
FMT? Or should an antimicrobial therapy be used in advance of 
FMT treatment?
Several other factors could influence the effect of FMT, such 
as the route used for FMT, duration of treatment and quantity 
of faecal microbiota transplanted to the patient. No clinical trials 
have compared FMT delivery routes in IBS and further trials are

needed to determine if a change in delivery route could have 
an effect on FMT treatment success in these patients.5
 Also the 
use of FMT donor-mix versus single donor should be explored 
further.
There is no evidence for FMT providing symptomatic benefit 
in patients with IBS in this trial. No significant side effects to 
FMT were observed during 6 months follow-up.
Conclusion
In this randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled study, we 
found that FMT changed gut microbiotas in patients with IBS. 
But patients in the placebo group experienced greater symptom 
improvements compared with the FMT group after 3 months 
(p=0.012). However, more studies are required to examine the 
potential role of FMT in treating IBS.
