Abstract
The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been continuously rising over the last three decades and is projected to
become the most common indication for liver transplantation in the near future. Its pathophysiology and complex interplay with
diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are not as yet fully understood despite growing scientific interest and research. Modern
imaging techniques offer significant assistance in this field by enabling the study of the liver noninvasively and evaluation of the
degree of both steatosis and fibrosis, and even in attempting to diagnose the presence of inflammation (steatohepatitis). The
derived measurements are highly precise, accurate and reproducible, performing better than biopsy in terms of quantification. In
this article, these imaging techniques are overviewed and their performance regarding diagnosis, stratification and monitoring are
evaluated. Their expanding role both in the research arena and in clinical practice along with their limitations is also discussed.

Introduction
The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been
continuously on the rise during the last three decades alongside the growing epidemics of obesity, diabetes and metabolic
syndrome. It is currently the most common cause of abnormal
liver tests and chronic liver disease in Western countries and is
projected to become the most common indication for liver
transplantation in the near future. Its rates are increasing
worldwide, i.e. not only in the Western world but also in many
less developed countries due to the adoption of an inactive,
sedentary lifestyle combined with the consumption of cheap,
processed, high-calorie foods that accompany industrialization and urbanization. In the USA, at least one third of the
adult population is affected and the prevalence is comparable
in Europe. In Greece, a high analogous rate of liver steatosis
(approximately 31%) and steatohepatitis has also been reported [1] paralleling the global trend.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the
presence of hepatic steatosis, documented either by imaging
or by histology, in the absence of secondary causes of hepatic
fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption (>
21 standard drinks in men and > 14 standard drinks in women
on average per week, or a daily alcohol consumption ≥ 30 g
for men and ≥ 20 g for women), long-term use of steatogenic
medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders [2, 3]. It is
subclassified into simple steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver,
NAFL) and steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,
NASH); the former generally runs a benign course, while
the latter represents the progressive form of the disease with
significant hepatic and extrahepatic morbidity and mortality.
NASH is present in up to 25–30% of individuals with
NAFLD. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may progress to cirrhosis, with the associated comorbidities (portal hypertension,
hepatocellular carcinoma), and it also carries a substantial risk
for cardiovascular disease and malignancy (accounting for
half of deaths in patients with NASH) [4]. Approximately
20% of these patients progress to cirrhosis, in contrast to only
4% of those with simple steatosis [5]. Histologically, NAFL is
characterized by simple, predominantly macrovesicular,
steatosis in > 5% of hepatocytes, while NASH is differentiated
by the additional features of ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes and inflammation, with or without fibrosis. The presence and degree of liver fibrosis on histology is the most
important evidence-based predictor of adverse long-term outcomes [6, 7]. Therefore, differentiation between the two entities and assessment of fibrosis carries significant prognostic
implications for risk stratification and patient management.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome
are closely linked in terms of both pathophysiology and epidemiology. Generally thought to represent the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, NAFLD may be more than
this according to data suggesting that it could actually act as an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity [8].
Although NAFLD may be seen in the absence of metabolic
syndrome and vice versa, the presence of features of the metabolic syndrome (central obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, increased serum triglycerides and decreased highdensity lipoprotein) is associated with a higher risk of
steatohepatitis (NASH). Even though it is still a matter of
debate, it seems that cardiovascular risk is not the same across
the entire NAFLD spectrum, patients with NASH showing a
worse survival rate mainly due to cardiovascular disease [9].
Consequently, the incidental discovery of a fatty liver (e.g.
during ultrasonography performed for another reason) should
prompt a careful evaluation for all components of metabolic
syndrome and identification of cardiovascular disease, provided that other secondary causes of steatosis have been excluded
[3]. If risk factors for NASH are present or there is concern
about advanced disease, then evaluation of fibrosis should
follow, initially with noninvasive tests (imaging, serum
markers, clinical scores) [4].
Despite the growing burden of NAFLD, the extensive research and the flood of scientific data, treatment remains an
open question. No pharmacological treatment is currently approved for NAFLD, and therapy relies on lifestyle modifications through diet and physical exercise. Guidelines on how
and when to follow up patients are also thus far undetermined.
However, as new drugs enter clinical testing and more robust
evidence from larger studies accumulates, the need for the
optimal tool to establish the diagnosis, monitor therapy and
follow up patients will become pressing.
Traditionally, the gold standard for the quantification of
liver steatosis and diagnosis of NASH has been liver biopsy.
With the wide application of ultrasound guidance and thinner
needles, it is generally considered a safe method. However,
despite its minimal invasiveness, complications may occur,
the most important being bleeding which may even lead to
death (≤ 0.01%) [10]. Additionally, due to its invasive nature,
acceptance by patients is low, leading to poor compliance,
especially if repeated biopsies are required during follow-up.
A major limitation of liver biopsy is that it evaluates only a
very small portion of the liver (approximately 1/50,000) leading to sampling errors, as distribution of fat and fibrosis is
frequently nonuniform; this sampling variability may render
longitudinal monitoring problematic due to staging inaccuracies. Furthermore, histological assessment is subject to
nonnegligible intra- and inter-observer variation, although
concordance for fibrosis and steatosis is generally higher than
for inflammation [11, 12]. Liver biopsy is not feasible in
screening studies of the general population, not only because
of its invasiveness and associated risks but also on account of
its high cost. Even in patients with NAFLD, biopsy should be
considered only when clinical features, noninvasive markers
and imaging suggest the possibility of NASH. For the reasons
stated above, a noninvasive, accurate and safe method to detect and quantify hepatic steatosis, evaluate fibrosis and monitor disease is necessary. Imaging has the potential to meet
these needs.
Scope
The aforementioned issues, briefly touched upon in the introduction, outline the purpose of this review: (a) to examine the
role of imaging in the diagnosis of NAFLD and the performance of the different modalities, (b) to explore the potential
of imaging in risk stratification and specifically in quantifying
fibrosis and differentiating NASH from simple NAFL and (c)
to discuss the role of imaging in the follow-up of these patients
and the monitoring of treatment efficacy.
Imaging methods for diagnosis
and quantification of hepatic steatosis
Ultrasound
Ultrasound is the most widely available modality for initial
evaluation of suspected hepatic steatosis, usually after detection of abnormal liver function tests. It is noninvasive, easy to
perform and inexpensive and does not expose the patient to
ionizing radiation. Moreover, incidental focal lesions (accounting for the abnormal serum tests) may be detected and
the rest of the upper abdomen can be easily examined.
However, it is operator- and equipment-dependent and difficult to perform in obese patients, while excessive intestinal
gas may compromise the quality of the examination.
Additionally, assessment of steatosis is subjective as there is
no standard measure of liver echogenicity. The sensitivity for
the detection of moderate and severe steatosis (defined as >
30% by histology) is reported at 84.8% and specificity at
93.6% [13], but they drop to 53.3–65 and 77–81.2%, respectively, if all degrees of steatosis are considered [14, 15]
Specificity is also reduced in the presence of inflammation
or fibrosis.
On ultrasound, fatty liver demonstrates increased
echogenicity (“bright liver”) due to the increased interfaces
created by fat droplets within hepatocytes, leading to more
echoes returning to the transducer [16]. The decreased ability
of ultrasound to penetrate the liver results in a hypoechoic
distant field and inability to visualize the deepest parts of the
liver and the diaphragm (Fig. 1). There is usually hepatomegaly and decreased conspicuity of the intrahepatic vessels
70 Hormones (2018) 17:69–81

(“featureless liver”). According to these imaging characteristics, liver steatosis is usually graded as mild (increased
echogenicity but normal visualization of vessels and diaphragm), moderate (poor visualization of the intrahepatic vessels) and severe (diaphragm and deep parenchyma are not
seen).
Doppler ultrasound has also been evaluated for assessment
of NAFLD, suggesting alterations in portal vein hemodynamics, possibly due to reduced vascular compliance, especially in
the setting of severe fatty infiltration [17–19]. However, it is
not clear if the method offers any advantage over conventional
greyscale ultrasound.
An ultrasound-based method to estimate liver fat, named
controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), measures ultrasound
attenuation in the liver, and the calculated value is expressed
in decibels per meter (dB/m); steatosis grade is then assessed
by comparing the measured value with validated cut-offs [20].
This measurement is performed simultaneously with transient
elastography (see below).
Computed tomography
Computed tomography (CT) estimates hepatic steatosis quantitatively by measuring liver attenuation. Normally, liver CT
density (attenuation) measures approximately 55 HU
(Hounsfield units), about 10 HU higher than (normal) spleen.
As fat has low attenuation (− 100 HU), a proportionate decrease in density is seen with increasing fat accumulation.
Both the absolute and relative (to the spleen) values are used
to characterize steatosis; a cut-off value of 40 HU has been
suggested to predict fat content greater than 30% [21], a liver
to spleen ratio less than 0.8–1.1 [22–24] and a liver minus
spleen attenuation less than − 9 HU [23] (spleen is used as a
reference value to minimize variations across different CT
scanner models). Moreover, as a practical guide, the severely
steatotic liver parenchyma appears much darker than the
unenhanced hepatic vessels, giving the impression of a
contrast-enhanced scan (Fig. 2). Cut-off values have also been
calculated for post-contrast scans [23, 25] but are subject to
variability as they depend on injection rate, patient’s circulation and phase of enhancement.
Although CT is, unlike ultrasound, a quantitative method, it
still suffers from low sensitivity for mild steatosis [15, 26, 27].
Sensitivity and specificity of unenhanced CT for steatosis ≥
30% are 72.7 and 91.3%, respectively, but—similarly to ultrasound—drop to 50 and 77.2% when milder degrees (steatosis
> 5%) are also included [14]. CT density may be spuriously
elevated due to increased iron, copper or glycogen content,
thereby masking steatosis; likewise, low CT density values
may also be caused by edema and inflammation. Exposure
to radiation is also an important issue, which precludes use
of this modality for screening.
Dual-energy CT, using different rapidly switched tube potentials, has the potential advantage of tissue discrimination.
The main principle is that different materials (e.g. tissues)
have different attenuations at different X-ray spectra (different
tube voltage). Promising reports on measuring fat content
have been published [28, 29]; however, contradictory results
have also been reported [30, 31], perhaps due to the small
differences in the attenuation energy curves of fat and water.
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presently the most accurate imaging modality for the evaluation of hepatic
steatosis. The MR signal arises mainly from protons in water
and fat molecules. By exploiting the different physical and
chemical properties of water protons and fat protons, various
MR techniques have been developed for identification and
quantification of liver fat. For example, based on the different
spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of fat and water, the fat signal
can be suppressed and the resulting images allow a gross
visual assessment. However, more precise techniques are preferred for evaluation of liver fat.
Such a technique is the chemical shift, which is based on
the different resonance frequencies between protons bound in
a fat and water molecule. In its simplest implementation, the
“in/opposed phase” sequence, images are acquired at specific
echo times when water and fat signals are added and
subtracted, producing “in-phase” and “opposed phase” images, respectively (two-point Dixon method). In the fatty liver,
there is signal loss in the opposed phase images and the liver
appears dark (Fig. 3). This sequence is available on every
scanner and is part of all upper abdominal MR protocols.
However, the assessment of hepatic steatosis is qualitative
(or semiquantitative at best), and therefore, the technique cannot detect small changes in fat content, thus rendering it

unsuitable for longitudinal follow-up. Still, sensitivity and
specificity of the method are high (82–90 and 89.9–91%, respectively, for detecting all degrees of steatosis), and therefore, MRI is superior to US and CT for differentiating mild
steatosis [15, 32, 33].
More complicated techniques, still based on the chemical
shift effect, have been developed to accurately quantify liver
fat. These techniques (multipoint Dixon) measure the proton
density fat fraction (PDFF), which represents the concentration of fat within tissue. PDFF accurately and specifically
reflects the concentration of triglycerides within hepatocytes
(fat vacuoles) as other lipids within cell membranes and organelles are occult at MR imaging [34]. For a precise estimation, it is important to correct for many confounding factors
like T1 bias, T2* bias (often due to the coexistence of iron),
spectral complexity of fat, noise bias, and phase errors. PDFF
measurements obtained from the whole liver can be graphically presented as a colour map, generated on a pixel-by-pixel
basis, overcoming the sampling error issue which is inherent
in liver biopsy (Fig. 4). Using this method, MRI is able to
provide a standardized, reproducible and highly accurate measurement of hepatic fat, which is closely associated with histology [35, 36]. Sensitivity up to 96% and specificity up to
100% for detecting any degree of steatosis have been reported
[37]. Various PDFF thresholds for stratifying steatosis grades
have been proposed, each showing high specificity for the
particular cohort studied though not validated in longer prospective studies. A fat-fraction threshold of 5.56% based on a
large MR spectroscopy study [38] is commonly used to define
steatosis; however, the optimal cut-off value still needs to be
defined. The technique measuring PDFF is approved by the
FDA [39] and is commercially available worldwide from most
MR manufacturers.
MRS
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the most direct
technique to separate the signal from fat and water using the
Fig. 3 In- (a) and out-of-phase (b) MR sequence in a patient with
prominent steatosis. Note the significant signal drop of the liver in the
out-of-phase image (b) compared to the in-phase one (a)
Fig. 2 Unenhanced CT scan. In
the posterior part of the right lobe,
there is a geographically shaped
hypodense area (arrows) due to
irregular fat accumulation, giving
a false impression of a mass.
Attenuation in this area (28 HU)
is markedly lower than that in the
spleen (50 HU), while steatosis in
the left lobe is much milder (47
HU). This example stresses the
sampling error that may occur
with biopsy, where only a minute
part of the liver is examined
72 Hormones (2018) 17:69–81

chemical shift effect. It displays the signal amplitude of protons
as a function of their resonance frequency. Water has a single
resonance peak, while fat has multiple spectral peaks, as the
multiple protons in fat have different chemical bonds, experience different magnetic fields and resonate at different frequencies (spectral complexity of fat). At clinical field strengths (1.5
and 3 T), six well-defined peaks are formed and should all be
taken into account for accurate fat quantification. The area
under the water peak and every fat peak is measured, the
sum of the fat peak areas is calculated (=total fat signal)—or,
alternatively, only the area under the main methylene peak is
measured—and the total fat signal is added to the water signal.
The signal fat fraction (FF) is given as the fat signal (F) divided
by the sum of the water (W) and fat signals (FF = F/W + F).
Spectroscopy is usually performed with a single cubic voxel,
typically with a size of 2 x 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 x 3 cm3
, which is
placed manually in the liver parenchyma. Like the other MR
methods outlined earlier, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing any degree of steatosis (> 5%) are high and reported at
94.4 and 89.5%, respectively [40]. However, unlike other MRI
methods, the whole liver is not evaluated and sampling errors
may occur, similarly to liver biopsy. Both the acquisition and
analysis of the collected spectra require expertise and specialized software, limiting the availability of the technique.
Despite these practical limitations, MRS is considered to be
the gold standard MR method for hepatic fat quantification
[15, 40, 41]. The strengths and limitations of each imaging
technique are summarized in Table 1.
PDFF as an imaging biomarker
The proton density fat fraction, measured by both MRI and
MRS, provides an excellent measurement of hepatic fat content. It represents an inherent physical property of the tissue
and is not confounded by inflammation or iron overload
(which commonly coexist in liver disease) [37, 40]. It is highly
correlated with tissue histological grades in patients with
NAFLD [42, 43] and in diabetics [44] although this correlation may drop in the setting of advanced fibrosis [45]. It is a
very precise, reliable and reproducible method across different
scanner models and manufacturers [46–48] as well as among
adults and children [45, 49]. It offers the advantage of measuring objectively the changes in fat content in longitudinal
studies, which would not be possible by histology (obtaining
multiple liver biopsies), and therefore the ability to assess
response to therapy. Indeed, PDFF measurement has been
successfully used as a primary endpoint in clinical trials, alternatively to biopsy, detecting smaller changes in liver fat
compared to histology [50–52]. This wealth of validation data
strongly and convincingly supports PDFF as a robust noninvasive biomarker of steatosis.
For a biomarker to establish its role, especially if it is to be
used in large screening programs and clinical trials, it should
be widely available and cost-effective. Although MRI scanners are abundant in developed countries, the PDFF pulse
sequences may not be available in all imaging centres.
Therefore, some time is needed until the technique is adopted

and the necessary level of expertise is reached. The incremental cost of adding a fat quantifying sequence during an abdominal MRI performed for another reason is negligible.
Moreover, a dedicated MRI examination for assessment of
steatosis would require no more than 5 min and such a tailored
“abbreviated” protocol could be offered at a cost comparable
to that of a panel of serum tests or an abdominal ultrasound
scan [53]. A recent UK study examined a hypothetical
decision-tree model and concluded that use of multiparametric
MRI as an adjunct or as a replacement of transient
elastography resulted in a decrease in the number of biopsies
required, with associated cost savings in both scenarios [54].
Despite the exciting prospect of MRI-derived virtual biopsy, there are some limitations that should be noted in addition
to the limited availability of these complex techniques. PDFF
sequences cannot evaluate other features of liver disease like
fibrosis or inflammation, although other MRI techniques have
been used for this purpose. Patients with pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are normally not allowed to undergo
MR scanning, though this may not be an absolute contraindication in the future [55]. As wide-bore magnets are not yet
widespread, large body habitus remains a barrier; however,
the other available methods for liver evaluation (ultrasound,
transient elastography) are also problematic in this patient
group, which represents a considerable percentage of the
NAFLD cohort. Finally, as mentioned above, the precise
PDFF threshold between normal and abnormal liver fat has
yet to be specified.
Imaging of fibrosis—risk stratification
The identification of liver steatosis, either as a chance finding or during a targeted examination following abnormal
liver tests, establishes the diagnosis of NAFLD. Hepatic
steatosis predicts future diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
events and arterial hypertension. It has been shown that the
occurrence of steatosis, defined by imaging, was connected
with aggravation of metabolic comorbidities associated with
insulin resistance and that, conversely, resolution of steatosis
coincided with their regression [56]. Although the degree of
steatosis has been shown to be an independent factor for

disease progression, patients with steatosis alone (without
any inflammation or fibrosis) are at a very low risk of histological progression [57]. However, it has not yet been
demonstrated that the quantification of steatosis is of clinical
interest, except as a surrogate of treatment efficacy (e.g. after
dietary or pharmacological interventions). Therefore, the diagnosis but not the quantification of liver fat is recommended [3]. Moreover, it is known that the relationship between
liver fat and fibrosis is an inverse one and that decrease in
hepatic fat may not indicate response to therapy but worsening of hepatic fibrosis. For example, in obese mice with
NASH, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis improved
steatosis but exacerbated liver damage and fibrosis [58]. In
addition to this, it is known that in the late cirrhotic stage
there is loss of fat droplets from hepatocytes leading to the
so-called burnt-out NAFLD (thus explaining why NAFLD
escaped detection as the cause of many cases of “cryptogenic” cirrhosis).
Once diagnosis of NAFLD has been established, the next
important step in patient management is to confirm or rule out
the presence of steatohepatitis (NASH), taking into account
the clinical risk factors; for instance, metabolic syndrome is a
strong predictor of the presence of NASH in patients with
hepatic steatosis [2]. The diagnosis of NASH provides important prognostic information and implies that more active
follow-up or more aggressive therapy may be required.
Numerous serum markers have been tested for the noninvasive diagnosis of steatohepatitis. Among these, cytokeratin-18
(CK-18) fragments that are created during cell death or apoptosis have been widely investigated and proposed as a promising biomarker, but its accuracy is modest. To date, there is no
validated noninvasive procedure to replace biopsy and diagnosis can be made only by obtaining a tissue sample.
Histologically, NASH is defined as the presence of
macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular
inflammation; fibrosis is not part of the diagnostic criteria.
Chronic inflammation and hepatocyte injury activate stellate cells, leading to fibrosis. Although fibrosis is not included
in the histological criteria for NASH, it is frequently present
and it is the most important determinant of outcome, both for
cardiovascular and liver-related mortality [6, 7, 59, 60].
Progression of fibrosis in the fatty liver represents a complex
procedure where the immune system, dietary factors, host
genetics and the gut microflora play a role [61]. Diabetes,
increased body mass index and aging have been shown to
accelerate fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Moreover, it
seems that fibrosis progresses not only in patients with
steatohepatitis but also in a subgroup of patients with simple
NAFL (who demonstrate delicate fibrosis or mild inflammation but do not fulfil the histological criteria for NASH), albeit
at a much slower pace [57, 62]. Hence, its identification is
crucial for patient stratification and its monitoring important
during follow-up.
Liver fibrosis can be evaluated using various noninvasive
imaging tests. Conventional ultrasound, CT and MRI assess
morphologic abnormalities of the liver, like the nodular contour and the increased caudate to right lobe ratio. These features suffer from low sensitivity and are not present at the
initial stages of fibrosis, while many of them are entirely subjective. Moreover, it is known that a minority of patients with
advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis on liver biopsy may show
normal morphologic features on conventional imaging [63].
Consequently, alternative, more quantitative and reliable
methods were sought.
Ultrasound elastography is a technique that measures liver
stiffness by measuring the velocity of mechanically induced
shear waves propagating through the liver. Liver stiffness increases incrementally with histological stage of fibrosis.
Transient elastography (TE), performed with FibroScan®,
was the first technology of this kind to be extensively used
and validated. The technique is quick and safe and it evaluates
a volume of liver tissue, approximately 4 × 1 cm, which is at
least 100 times bigger than liver biopsy [64]. TE has an excellent negative predictive value for cirrhosis, up to 96% [65],
but performs moderately for lesser degrees of fibrosis and
cannot accurately distinguish between intermediate fibrosis
stages [66, 67]. Additionally, the technique is less reliable in
obese patients; although an XL probe for these patients has
been developed, obesity is still associated with less accurate
and reliable measurements [68].
As mentioned earlier, it is possible to assess the liver for
steatosis with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)
technology while performing transient elastography.
Therefore, using the same device, hepatic fat and stiffness
can be concomitantly measured in a quick and inexpensive
way. However, when directly compared with MRI, both
CAP and TE proved less accurate for the quantification of
steatosis and fibrosis, respectively [69].
It should be mentioned that TE is not literally an imaging
technique as it does not display any images of the liver or the
location where stiffness is measured. Alternative modalities
like 2D shear wave elastography (or supersonic shear imaging,
SSI) and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) incorporate
true imaging, and the site of measurement can be saved on the
images and subsequently used for accurate comparisons during
follow-up. Moreover, these imaging modalities allow hepatic
parenchyma evaluation (e.g. screening for HCC) during the
same session. They have shown promising results for the diagnosis and staging of fibrosis, though obesity is associated
with an increased rate of measurement failure [70].
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is the flagship of
imaging techniques for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis.
MRE uses an acoustic wave generator, placed outside the
scanner room, which is connected via a tube to a passive
nonmetallic driver. The driver is placed in contact with the
patient’s abdomen and transmits the vibrations into the body
Hormones (2018) 17:69–81 75

to generate propagating shear waves. Τhe microscopic displacements caused by the propagating waves are captured
and processed to create quantitative cross-sectional maps
(elastograms) of the whole liver. Liver stiffness is measured
in a manually drawn region of interest or averaged from several slices and is reported in kilopascals (kPa) [71].
MRE can be performed in obese patients and in patients
with ascites, showing a higher technical success rate and better
accuracy compared with TE [69]. It can accurately diagnose
early and mild fibrosis, and it is highly reproducible with
excellent inter-observer agreement, higher than histological
staging [72], partly due to the large volume of liver assessed.
The MRE sequence lasts less than a minute and can be added
to a standard upper abdominal protocol to provide a fully
comprehensive evaluation of the liver. The main limitation
of MRE is its limited availability, requiring added hardware
(wave generator) and special software (for image acquisition
and processing). Increased iron deposition in the liver may
lead to technical failure as iron may decrease signal intensity
to extremely low levels, prohibiting visualization of the propagating waves [73].
MR elastography has also been used to discriminate NASH
from NAFL even before the onset of fibrosis. Researchers
have found that liver stiffness was significantly higher in patients with inflammation (but without fibrosis) compared to
simple steatosis, allowing differentiation between the two with
reported sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 73% [74]. It is
believed that early liver injury leads to changes in the extracellular matrix that increase the stiffness of hepatic tissue.
Unfortunately, no further research on this issue was published
and validation is still lacking.
Other imaging techniques
Apart from the aforementioned, numerous other imaging techniques have been devised in an effort to noninvasively diagnose liver fibrosis; some of them will be briefly presented in
the following paragraphs.
Based on the idea that fibrous tissue accumulation increases tissue stiffness and may translate into increased arterial
rigidity, researchers have found a positive correlation between
degree of fibrosis and hepatic artery resistive index, measured
with Doppler ultrasound [75]. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS) of the liver is mainly used to characterize focal lesions, based on their specific hemodynamic properties. The
differences in blood flow parameters, like time to peak enhancement, have been used to diagnose cirrhosis but do not
seem effective for staging fibrosis [76].
Similarly, the microcirculatory changes due to hepatic
fibrinogenesis and the resulting increased hepatic resistance
have been studied with perfusion CT (repeated scans of the
liver to evaluate flow parameters after contrast administration). The perfusion changes occurring early during fibrosis
have been successfully detected with this technique [77, 78];
however, the increased radiation burden is a significant barrier. The increased deposition of collagen into the extracellular
space leads to its expansion; consequently, the amount of iodinated contrast that diffuses into this space, in the late or
equilibrium phase of enhancement, should also be increased.
Therefore, by using only two scans (unenhanced and equilibrium phase), the parenchymal enhancement can be measured
and the extracellular volume calculated. The technique proved
efficient in detecting cirrhosis and significant fibrosis, but not
in distinguishing earlier stages [79, 80].
Apart from MR elastography, there have been other interesting attempts to use MRI to assess liver fibrosis and differentiate NASH from NAFL. Similarly to CT, MR perfusion has
been used to detect fibrosis but showed lower accuracy than
MRE [81]. Gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is a liverspecific contrast agent which is taken up and excreted by
hepatocyte membrane transporters thus providing an estimation of liver function. The degree of enhancement has been
used to stage liver fibrosis. Moreover, gadoxetic acid enhancement was significantly lower in NASH compared to simple
steatosis [82], suggesting a potential ability to discriminate
between these two forms of NAFLD. This decrease may be
explained by the hepatocellular injuries caused by NASH and
is proportional to the degree of liver fibrosis. However, the
considerable overlap in the enhancement ratios and the low
specificity argue against its use for differentiating simple
steatosis from steatohepatitis [83]. Similarly to gadoxetic acid,
ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs)
have been tested for the aforementioned differentiation.
These particles are taken up by hepatic Kupffer cells resulting
in drop of signal in the liver. This decrease was smaller in
NASH compared to simple steatosis, probably due to dysfunction of Kupffer cells in the setting of steatohepatitis [84]. Postcontrast imaging is performed 72 h after administration of the
particles, making the procedure somewhat cumbersome.
Though the technique yielded promising results, further validation is needed. Research has also focused on
myeloperoxidase, a proinflammatory and highly oxidizing inflammatory enzyme, which is abundant in livers with NASH.
Using a specific MR imaging agent to target this enzyme, the
inflammatory activity in the liver could be assessed, providing
a potential biomarker for the direct noninvasive diagnosis of
NASH [85]. Finally, a modified spectroscopy technique
(MRS), focusing on phosphorus (31P) instead of protons
(
1
H), has been exploited to study hepatocellular metabolism,
but it performed only moderately in the discrimination between NASH and NAFLD [86].
Radiomics (texture analysis) is a new area of imaging research that aims to extract many quantitative features by applying sophisticated mathematical transformations and statistical analysis to the distribution of pixels in radiographic images (US, CT, MRI and even PET). A myriad of texture
76 Hormones (2018) 17:69–81

features are derived that can then be correlated with disease or
genome. The method is most well developed in oncology;
however, it has also been applied in the study of liver fibrosis
[87, 88]. Currently, the problem with radiomics is the great
variability in the features studied, the lack of standardization
and poor validation; nevertheless, the method is a promising
one and will likely play an important diagnostic and prognostic role in the future.
Imaging for monitoring and follow-up
Although NAFLD is common in the general population, it is
generally not associated with significant mortality or morbidity. However, as stressed before, a considerably higher proportion of patients with NASH will progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis compared to patients with simple steatosis. This dogmatic division of NAFLD into a “good” and a “bad” form has
become less rigid as our understanding and insight into the
natural history of the disease expands; it is now accepted that
both forms may progress—though at a different speed—to
liver fibrosis [57, 62]. Since the best predictor is fibrosis severity, and not NASH, it is essential to be able to assess the
amount of fibrosis present as advanced fibrosis portends the
worst prognosis. Therefore, the ideal strategy would be to try
to identify patients with liver fibrosis even in the absence of
NASH.
Regarding steatosis, it is generally accepted that the degree
of fatty change is not correlated with the advancement of
fibrosis and therefore it should not be employed as an evaluation criterion for assessing NAFLD severity. Nonetheless,
there are some studies suggesting that the degree of steatosis
is positively associated with some (but not all) of the histological features of steatohepatitis both in adults and children [89,
90]. Although the prevalence of NAFLD is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes (up to 75%) and diabetics are more
prone to develop NASH, there are data suggesting that
NAFLD may actually be a predictor and determinant for diabetes (rather than being merely an epiphenomenon) [91, 92].
Therefore, quantification and monitoring of fat seems justified
in addition to fibrosis assessment.
Despite the fact that no medical therapy is currently approved for NASH, research is intense and ongoing, and clinical trials would surely make full use of a reliable noninvasive
marker that could replace biopsy (currently recommended in
clinical trials by all guidelines but hampered by a considerable
dropout rate of up to 25% [93]). Consequently, an accurate
and reproducible noninvasive method for evaluation of liver
steatosis and fibrosis is indispensable in the struggle to unravel
and manage the disease.
Noninvasive imaging biomarkers for the diagnosis, staging
and monitoring of NASH have been successfully used in clinical trials. MRI PDFF can reliably detect longitudinal changes
as small as 2% (standard deviation of repeated PDFF measurements being < 1%), while histological grading of steatosis
(percentage of hepatocytes with fat) into four grades (< 5, 5–
33, 33–66 and > 66%) is much grosser. These small changes
in liver fat appreciated by MRI PDFF, but not by histology,
correlated well with MRS (the gold standard MR method for
fat quantification) and were also associated with changes in
body weight and serum markers [51]. MRI PDFF and MRE
have been utilized to examine the efficacy of ezetimibe in
lowering liver fat and correlated well with the histological
results, proving that application of these MR techniques for
assessing treatment response in NASH is feasible [94].
Moreover, it was shown that histological response was associated with a statistically significant decrease in MRI PDFF
and that, on the other hand, a 29% reduction in MRI PDFF
was required for steatosis to regress by one grade histologically. Although this decline was accompanied by equivalent improvement in hepatocellular ballooning, it was not associated
with any significant change in lobular inflammation and fibrosis, this pointing to the necessity for caution before the 29%
decrement on MRI PDFF is used as a cut-off of treatment
response in NASH [95]. MRI PDFF and MRS detected slight
changes in hepatic fat that escaped histological assessment in
a trial evaluating colesevelam for NASH [52]. In the same
trial, a decrease of 5% or greater in BMI correlated significantly with a decrease in MRI PDFF by 25% and with a decrease
in histology-determined steatosis grade. Notably, no significant change in other components of the NAS (NAFLD
Activity Score) score was observed for this range of BMI
reduction. Consequently, further validation is needed before
a specific percentage decrease in MRI PDFF can be suggested
as a meaningful endpoint in trials evaluating weight loss—the
backbone of treatment for NAFLD and NASH [96]. Other
researchers employed MRI PDFF and MRE to screen for
NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes
[97]. Assessing fibrosis simultaneously with steatosis provides a full estimate of the severity of the disease, as patients
with NAFLD and diabetes have increased risk of cirrhosis and
overall mortality. Despite the fact that screening is not advised
for diabetics by the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases, even in their recently revised guidelines [2],
the authors of this study concluded that using MR techniques
for screening is feasible and can be used to identify patients at
risk.
In a recent paper, a novel multiparametric MR technique
based on T1 and T2* mapping of the liver achieved high
diagnostic accuracy for diagnosis of NASH, showing significant correlation with hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation and fibrosis grade [98]. This technique, without the
additional hardware needed for elastography or any injectable
contrast material, can be performed quickly and sounds attractive as a noninvasive tool both for clinical practice and trials;
further validation is required to confirm the findings.
Hormones (2018) 17:69–81 77

From the examples presented herein, it is clear that MR
imaging biomarkers are being increasingly used as surrogate
endpoints in clinical trials. However, they are not—as yet—
robust enough to diagnose NASH and assess the full effect of
treatment. Further validation and larger studies are required to
define the optimal use of these modalities in noninvasive
screening and monitoring protocols. Additionally, these MR
techniques have to be compared to ultrasound-based techniques which, although less accurate and precise, are more
widely available and potentially more cost-effective.
Conclusions
As NAFLD becomes more prevalent in the general population
and evolves into a major public health issue, awareness of its
clinical significance is increasing within the scientific community in parallel with the intensification of research. New insights into the pathophysiology and course of the disease as
well as its connection to the metabolic syndrome are becoming available, preparing the ground for future treatments. Our
ability to study NAFLD has greatly expanded thanks to the
impressive advances in modern imaging and the potential they
offer to evaluate the liver noninvasively. As the sampling limitations of biopsy are increasingly recognized, its acceptance
as a “gold standard” is gradually losing its golden shine; moreover, its complication rate, although low, could be an important issue when large cohorts are screened. Serum markers,
used on their own or in complex prediction models, have not
so far provided a reliable alternative for the accurate assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.
Imaging, on the other hand, has emerged as the most qualified candidate for the noninvasive evaluation of the liver.
Importantly, the most promising and validated techniques
are based on ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance,
neither of which involves ionizing radiation. Ultrasoundbased techniques, namely transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter, are inexpensive, quick and easy
to perform; however, they carry a significant failure rate, especially in overweight patients. Magnetic resonance techniques allow more accurate, reproducible and precise quantification of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Magnetic resonance
spectroscopy is considered to be the gold standard MR method; nevertheless, it is a complex technique and evaluates only
a very small part of the parenchyma, with the concomitant
sampling error. Measurement of proton density fat fraction
can be performed throughout the whole liver on a pixel-bypixel basis and is highly correlated with spectroscopy. It is
more easily implemented, does not require significant expertise, is more widely available and is not limited by body habitus. Unlike fat, fibrosis does not have a unique molecular
signature and can be assessed only indirectly. Of the various
MR techniques suggested, magnetic resonance elastography
is the most accurate, evaluating liver stiffness through the use
of mechanical shear waves similarly to transient elastography.
However, contrary to transient elastography, MR elastography
is not influenced by patient demographics and allows evaluation of the entire liver.
Overall, MR techniques are the most robust and accurate
methods for quantification of steatosis and fibrosis. A dedicated MR protocol combining proton density fat fraction measurement and elastography could be performed in a few minutes and at a reasonable cost; it could even prove costeffective as an initial examination considering the expenses
associated with false-positive or false-negative results obtained with less accurate biomarkers. Perhaps a more reasonable
approach would be to scan patients with ultrasound-based
techniques in the first place and then refer those with abnormal
or inconclusive results for MRI. Despite the greater accuracy
and inter-observer agreement of MRI compared to histology,
the latter can detect features of inflammation that are still
beyond contemporary imaging capability, although research
may soon overcome this issue as well. Biopsy is not expected
to be completely replaced in the immediate future; nonetheless, imaging techniques have already started to change the
diagnostic algorithm for NAFLD, impact the design of clinical
trials and shape the way patients will be monitored as soon as
the new therapies enter clinical practice.
