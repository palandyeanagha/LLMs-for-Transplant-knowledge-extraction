that sufficient resources (including suitable accommodation) are made available, that services are made
attractive to patients, and that active steps are taken to
recruit long term mentally ill people into them.
Community services offering open access (as both
services did) commonly attract substantial numbers of
clients with less serious symptoms or no symptoms at
all.35 Provision dedicated to the needs of the long term
mentally ill may need to be established to prevent this
unintended redirection of resources to clients who
would not previously have been recruited into the
psychiatric system. Dedicated provision may also
encourage the more proactive or assertive approach to
recruiting the long term mentally ill into services,
which has met with some success."

Intravenous acetylcysteine in paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic
failure: a prospective controlled trial
R Keays, P M Harrison, J A Wendon, A Forbes, C Gove, G J M Alexander, Roger Williams
Abstract
Objective-To see whether intravenous acety-lcysteine would improve outcome in patients with
fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose.
Design-A prospective randomised controlled
study.
Setting-The Institute of Liver Studies, King's
College Hospital, London.
Patients-50 consecutive patients (21 male) aged
16-60 with fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose who had not previously received
acetylcysteine.
Interventions-Conventional intensive liver care
plus either acetylcysteine (25 patients) in the same
dose regimen as used early after a paracetamol
overdose, except that the infusion was continued
until recovery from encephalopathy or death, or an
equivalent volume of 5% dextrose (25 patients).
Main outcome measures-Survival; incidence of
cerebral oedema, renal failure, and hypotension
requiring inotropic support; liver function as
assessed by prolongation of the prothrombin time;
and degree of encephalopathy.
Results-The rate of survival was significantly
higher in the acetylcysteine treated group than in
the controls (48% (12/25 patients) v 20% (5/25);
p=0037, 95% confidence interval for difference in
proportions surviving 3% to 53%). Acetylcysteine
treated patients had a lower incidence of cerebral
oedema (40% (10/25) v 68% (17/25); p=0047, 95%
confidence interval for difference in incidence 2% to
54%), and fewer developed hypotension requiring
inotropic support (48% (12/25) v 80% (20/25);
p=0-018, 95% confidence interval 7% to 57%). Rates
of deterioration and recovery of liver function,
however, were similar in the two groups. No adverse
reactions to acetylcysteine were seen.
Conclusions -Acetylcysteine is safe and effective
in fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose.
Introduction
Acetylcysteine, by repleting glutathione stores,' is
highly effective in preventing massive hepatic necrosis
if given within 10 hours of a paracetamol overdose, and
it reduces the severity of liver damage if given up to 15

hours after drug ingestion.23 Until recently it was
thought that initiating intravenous acetylcysteine more
than 15 hours after overdose was of no benefit, Prescott
et al having shown that it does not prevent severe liver
damage when given at that stage.2 The reluctance to
use acetylcysteine late after overdose was strengthened
by work in animals suggesting that late use might even
be harmful.4 However, acetylcysteine given late after
overdose has now been shown not to be hepatotoxic.'
In a retrospective study of patients with fulminant
hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose we found a
better outcome when acetylcysteine was given 10 to 36
hours after overdose, despite no apparent enhancement of liver function as assessed by prolongation of
the prothrombin time.6
Evidence is also accumulating that acetylcysteine is
of benefit in other critical illnesses. A study in a porcine
model of endotoxin induced multiorgan failure7 and an
anecdotal report of multiorgan failure in a patient with
pancreatitis8 suggested that acetylcysteine given after
the onset of critical illness may ameliorate the multiorgan failure. We report the results of a prospective
randomised controlled trial of intravenous acetylcysteine in patients with established fulminant hepatic
failure after paracetamol overdose.
Patients and methods
Patients with fulminant hepatic failure9 after paracetamol overdose who had not already received acetylcysteine were eligible for the trial. Patients were
randomised on admission to the liver failure unit by
opening one of 50 identical sealed envelopes containing
an allocation to receive either acetylcysteine in addition
to conventional intensive liver care'0 12 or the same
level of intensive care alone. Twenty five patients were
randomised to receive acetylcysteine, which was given
by intravenous infusion using the regimen recommended after paracetamol overdose - namely,
150 mg/kg body weight in 200 ml 5% dextrose over 15
minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg in 500 ml 5% dextrose
over four hours, then 100 mg/kg in 1 litre over 16
hours. The final infusion rate was continued until
recovery from encephalopathy or death. Control
patients received an equivalent amount of 5% dextrose
without acetylcysteine. Treatment with acetylcysteine
could not be given blind because the solution has an
easily identified pungent aroma.
Intensive liver care for all patients included routine
insertion of a pulmonary artery flotation catheter and
radial arterial line. Intravascular filling pressures were
maintained with infusion of appropriate colloid solutions (blood or 4-5% human albumin solution). If
patients had oliguria despite an adequate pulmonary
capillarv wedge pressure of greater than 12 mm Hg a
dopasiiine infusion was begun at 2 tg/kg/min. Renal
replacement therapy with either intermittent haemodialysis or continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration

with a serum creatinine concentration greater than
400 [tmol/l. Hypotension, defined as a mean arterial
pressure of less than 60 mm Hg despite adequate
intravascular filling pressures, was treated with either
adrenaline or noradrenaline as vasopressor support.
Patients who progressed to grade 4 encephalopathy
were electively ventilated (Siemens servo 900C,
volume control) and given a continuous infusion of
muscle relaxant (atracurium 50 mg/h). The development of raised intracranial pressure due to cerebral
oedema was diagnosed from the typical clinical signs
(systemic hypertension and dilated pupils) and treated
with mannitol, hyperventilation, and thiopentone
according to the response.
Blood samples for haematological and biochemical
profiles were taken on admission and each morning
thereafter. The incidence of cerebral oedema, hypotension, and renal failure together with the daily
haematological and biochemical profiles were recorded
for each patient for later analysis. Particular attention was paid to the known indicators of poor
prognosis: arterial pH <7 3, prothrombin time >100 s
accompanied by a serum creatinine concentration
>300 [tmol/l in a patient with grade 3 or 4 coma,'3 and
a rise in the prothrombin time on day 4 compared with
day 3 after overdose. '4 On the basis of these predictors
two women who had been randomised to the acetylcysteine group underwent orthotopic liver transplantation; for the statistical analysis we assumed that they
would have died.
Statistical analysis-In order to detect a 40% difference in survival between the acetylcysteine treated and
control groups we had calculated that we would need to
recruit 25 patients in each group to give a 90% power of
achieving 5% significance. The retrospective study of
late treatment with acetylcysteine in patients after
paracetamol overdose who subsequently developed
fulminant hepatic failure had suggested that such a
difference in survival might be achieved.6 Analysis of
the difference in outcome between the two groups was
performed by X2 test. This test was also used to
compare groups for the incidence of hypotension,
cerebral oedema, and renal failure. Results were
considered significant if p<0 05 and were expressed
with the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in
incidence of these variables between the groups. The
Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison of
prothrombin time and grade of encephalopathy. The
time to death in the two groups was compared by log
rank test. Survivors were censored at 21 days, although
there were no further deaths after 16 days in the trial.
Ethics-The study was approved by the King's
College Hospital and Medical School ethics committee.
Results
The characteristics of the acetylcysteine and control
groups at entry to the trial are shown in table I. They
were well matched for age and sex. There were no
significant differences between the groups in the time
from overdose to either presentation at the referring
hospital or admission to the liver failure unit at this
hospital. Admission values of serum creatinine concentration, arterial pH, and prothrombin time were
similar. At entry a similar number of patients in each
group fulfilled the criteria for poor outcome.
Forty eight per cent of patients (12/25) in the
acetylcysteine treated group survived compared with
20% (5/25) of the controls (p=0 037; 95% confidence
interval for difference in survival between groups 3%
to 53%). Five of the 17 patients in the acetylcysteine
treated group who fulfilled at least one criterion for
poor prognosis survived compared with only one of the
18 patients in the control group; this difference was not

in days was similar in the treated and control groups
(X2=2 4 from Mantel-Haenszel procedure, df=1).
Survival curves are shown in the figure.
Fewer patients treated with acetylcysteine
developed clinical signs of cerebral oedema compared
with controls (40% (10/25) v 68% (17/25), p=0047,
95% confidence interval for difference in incidence 2%
to 54%) despite a comparable severity of liver failure as
assessed by prolongation of the prothrombin time and
grade of encephalopathy (table II). The development
of cerebral oedema was associated with a poor outcome
in both groups, no patients in the control group and
only two in the acetylcysteine treated group surviving.
Adrenaline or noradrenaline was given to maintain
mean arterial pressure in fewer patients receiving
acetylcysteine than controls (48% (12/25) v 80%
(20/25); p=0018, 95% confidence interval for difference in incidence 7% to 57%). The occurrence of
hypotension requiring inotropic support was also
associated with a poor outcome, no patients in the
control group and only two in the acetylcysteine
treated group surviving. The proportion of patients
requiring renal support was lower in the acetylcysteine
treated group than the control group (40% (10/25) v
60% (15/25)) but the difference was not significant
(95% confidence interval for difference in incidence 7%
higher to 47% lower).
Acetylcysteine was well tolerated by all patients,
none having evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction.
Discussion
These findings show that intravenous acetylcysteine
significantly improves survival in patients with
fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose.
That the median prothrombin time was similar on each
day of the trial in the acetylcysteine treated and control
groups is consistent with findings in the previous
uncontrolled study from this unit, in which acetylcysteine improved survival without having a measurable effect on liver function.6 However, although prolongation of the prothrombin time is a good indicator
of the severity of liver damage, it is only one measure of
hepatic function.

There were no significant differences in prothrombin time or encephalopathy grade between the groups on any day.
The lower incidence of cerebral and cardiovascular
dysfunction may account for the enhanced survival in
acetylcysteine treated patients as recovery from
any cause of multiorgan failure, including fulminant
hepatic failure,s is inversely related to the number of
failing organs and the duration of their dysfunction.'6
An important cause of organ failure is tissue hypoxia,
which may arise in fulminant hepatic failure because
tissue oxygen consumption becomes dependent on
oxygen delivery over a greater range than normal.'7
Although this may be increased, it is inadequate to
supply sufficient oxygen for tissue requirements in the
presence of the reduced ability to extract oxygen.
Acetylcysteine enhances tissue oxygen consumption
in fulminant hepatic failure not only by improving
oxygen delivery to tissues but also by increasing
peripheral oxygen extraction.'8 The reversal of tissue
hypoxia after infusion of acetylcysteine may account
for the lower incidence of multiorgan failure. The
mechanism by which acetylcysteine improves tissue
oxygen extraction in fulminant hepatic failure is poorly
understood, but we have suggested that it increases
microcirculatory blood flow by correcting a relative
deficiency in the activity of endothelium derived
relaxing factor.'8
Oxidant stress, mediated by either oxygen free
radicals or the direct oxidant action of reactive metabolites of paracetamol, can cause endothelial cell
damage'9 and may contribute to some of the complications, such as cerebral oedema. Paracetamol overdose
promotes the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to
xanthine oxidase, producing activated oxygen free
radicals which can oxidise important protein thiol
groups.20 Oxidation of essential thiol groups in 13
adrenoceptors has been shown to reduce the inotropic
effect of [ adrenoceptor agonists in an animal model.2'
The depression of myocardial contractility induced
by oxygen free radicals can be prevented by acetylcysteine,22 which is an avid scavenger of oxygen free
radicals.28 The prevention or reversal of oxidation
of thiol groups in [ adrenoceptors could explain
the reduced inotropic requirements in acetylcysteine
treated patients.
It had been thought that giving acetylcysteine late
after paracetamol overdose would be associated with a
high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. However,
no adverse reactions were encountered. Many of the
reactions reported with acetylcysteine in the past were
associated with high doses of the drug. The elimination
ofacetylcysteine is not impaired in severe liver damage24
and it is unlikely that toxic concentrations would
be achieved with the dosage regimen used in this
study.
We are grateful to Dr John Spooner, of Sterling Research
Laboratories, for generous support of studies of paracetamol
hepatotoxicity.

Design-Retrospective analysis of routine
abstracts of general hospital inpatient records linked
with those of psychiatric care, for inpatients with
physical disorders with possible psychiatric associations and for controls.
Setting-Oxfordshire health district.
Subjects-Inpatients aged 15-64 years discharged
from general hospitals during 1975-85 with a diagnosis among 14 selected diagnostic groups (including
potentially life threatening conditions, chronic
disabling diseases, and non-specific symptomatic
conditions) and control inpatients with acute
conditions.
Main outcome measures-Observed and expected
numbers of patients receiving psychiatric care.
Results-Observed use of psychiatric services
before and after index admission was close to that
expected for controls. For most other diagnoses the
observed use was significantly increased in the year
preceding and that subsequent to the admission. For
four diagnostic groups it was significantly greater in
the year after admission than in that before (acute
myocardial infarction (ratio before to after 2@17, 95%
confidence interval 1-5 to 3.3), cancer (2.05, 1-7 to
2.5), diabetes mellitus (1-89, 1-4 to 2.9), and chest
pain (1.78, 1-3 to 2.4)). During four years after the
admission the use of psychiatric services was significantly higher than in the general population for nonspecific symptomatic conditions (observed/expected:
abdominal pain 1-7, chest pain 2.0, and headache
4-2), cirrhosis of the liver (10-4), and fractures in
road accidents and other fractures (1-3, 1-6).
Conclusions-More patients with certain physical
conditions used psychiatric services. Alternative
methods of service delivery may be needed, especially for disabling chronic physical illness, alcohol
related disorders, and non-specific symptomatic
conditions.
Introduction
Associations between psychiatric disorder and
physical symptoms and conditions are evident in the
general population,'" in people attending primary care
services,4 and in patients in general hospitals.59
Explanations for such associations include psychiatric
disorder as a reaction to physical illness, psychiatric
disorder presenting with somatic symptoms, physical
complications of psychiatric disorders, and aetiological
or other risk factors common to both psychiatric and
physical disorders. Other important factors which may
result in associations between disorders include illness
and consultation behaviour4 and referral and admission
practice-' and the possibility that people with two
disorders may be more likely to receive specialist care
than those with either disorder alone.'0
Psychiatric illness among patients in general
hospitals is important, both because it can be a
persistent disability and because it is associated with
poor compliance with medical treatment and extra
demands on medical resources.5 11-13 Unfortunately,
such illness is not always recognised and, if recognised,
treated. Few patients are referred to specialist
psychiatric consultation services within general
hospitals.'4
We considered that it would be useful to quantify the
use of psychiatric services by patients in general
hospitals and to identify particular types of physical
problem associated with increased rate of use of
psychiatric services. Such information could have
implications for the delivery of psychiatric and other
psychological services and may also provide evidence
of aetiological associations between physical and
psychiatric disorders.
We used abstracts of general hospital inpatient
records linked with abstracts of psychiatric care to
study the use of psychiatric services by patients in
general hospitals with a diagnosis on discharge among
14 groups of chosen diagnoses. The use of psychiatric
services was compared, firstly, with that by the general
population in the same health district and, secondly,
with a group of patients in general hospitals selected as
controls. The diagnoses were chosen to illustrate
physical conditions which may be life threatening and
distressing (for example, myocardial infarction and
cancer); those which might in some patients be an
expression of psychiatric disorder (for example, chest
pain, abdominal pain, and headache); those in which
physical disorder may be the consequence ofpsychiatric
disorder (for example, cirrhosis after chronic alcohol
problems); and those in which associations between
physical and psychiatric conditions may exist but
whose nature may be more complex.
