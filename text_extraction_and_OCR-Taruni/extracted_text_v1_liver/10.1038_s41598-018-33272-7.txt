Face transplantation is a viable treatment option for carefully selected patients with devastating 
injuries to the face. However, acute rejection episodes occur in more than 80% of recipients in the 
frst postoperative year. Unfortunately, neither a correlation between histological grades of rejection 
and anti-rejection treatment nor systemic surrogate markers of rejection in face transplantation 
are established in clinical routine. Therefore, we utilized next generation aptamer-based SOMAscan 
proteomics platform for non-invasive rejection biomarker discovery. Longitudinal serum samples 
from face transplant recipients with long-term follow-up were included in this study. From the 1,310 
proteins analyzed by SOMAscan, a 5-protein signature (MMP3, ACY1, IL1R2, SERPINA4, CPB2) was 
able to discriminate severe rejection from both no-rejection and nonsevere rejection samples. Technical 
validation on ELISA platform showed high correlation with the SOMAscan data for the MMP3 protein 
(rs=0.99). Additionally, MMP3 levels were signifcantly increased during severe rejection as compared 
to no-rejection (p=0.0009) and nonsevere rejection (p=0.0173) episodes. Pathway analyses revealed 
signifcant activation of the metallopeptidase activity during severe face transplant rejection. This 
pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of SOMAscan to identify non-invasive candidate biomarkers of 
rejection in face transplantation. Further validation in a larger independent patient cohort is needed.
Face transplantation is a viable reconstructive option for carefully selected patients with severe facial disfgurement1,2
. Since 2005, 40 such procedures have been performed worldwide3. Face transplantation, similar to hand 
transplantation, belongs to a feld called vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA), which is characterized 
by the presence of tissues of diferent function and immunogenicity in the allograf, such as skin, fat, muscle, tendon, bone, bone marrow, nerves and vessels4
. From these tissues, skin is believed to be the most immunogenic and 
susceptible for acute rejection5,6
. In contrast to solid organ transplantation (SOT) in which rejection occurs in about 
10–20% of transplant recipients, the incidence of acute rejection in VCA is more than 80% in the frst year afer 
transplantation7–9
. Te VCA allografs are available for direct inspection, which is a unique feature compared to SOT. 
In face transplantation, sentinel faps may complement the rejection diagnosis and the experience from our center 
showed good correlation of histological fndings between the face allografs and sentinel faps, so far10. However, 
apart from clinical presentation and biopsy, there are no other assays to diagnose acute rejection in VCA4
. Terefore, 
biomarkers to diagnose, monitor or even prevent rejection are of great interest for the feld of VCA.
Te gold standard to diagnose acute rejection in VCA is the skin biopsy assessed by the Banf classifcation of 
skin-containing composite tissues11. However, skin biopsy is associated with morbidity to the patient, including 
scarring, bleeding or infection, hence it is not favorable for frequent monitoring. Furthermore, the Banf grading 
of skin rejection is semiquantitative, might be prone to intra- and interobserver variability, and lacks a correlation

to treatment response12–15. Tus, strategies to establish non-invasive monitoring, such as from blood samples, are 
very desirable for the clinical management as well as to defne the best treatment strategy. Since extensive immunosuppression drug administration is associated with increased morbidity to the patient, we sought to investigate 
whether molecular non-invasive protein markers could potentially help to better discern between diferent severities of the rejection process.
Only a limited number of studies have evaluated markers associated with acute rejection in face transplantation from peripheral blood samples16. As a tool for discovery of biomarkers associated with transplant rejection, 
the concept of mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics found in recent years its way into the feld of SOT, especially kidney transplantation17–19. Te SOMAscan proteomics platform, in contrast to MS or immunoassays, uses 
modifed aptamers to bind with high selectivity and afnity to proteins and to quantify their expression levels in 
biological samples. Due to the dual features of these modifed single-stranded oligonucleotides to interact selectively with proteins and to hybridize to the complementary DNA strand, hybridization on a microarray results 
in a quantitative protein expression read-out20. Te aptamer-based approach is novel for the feld of transplant 
proteomics. Here we present the frst comprehensive evaluation of protein biomarkers from serum samples of 6 
face transplant recipients utilizing the SOMAscan technology.
Results
Workfow and serum samples. A detailed overview of the patients’ characteristics is summarized in 
Table 1. We retrospectively analyzed management of acute rejection in 6 face transplant recipients whose serum 
samples were available (Table 2). Te data suggested that despite of similar clinical presentation and histological grades of rejection, some acute rejection episodes could be managed by only adjustment of maintenance 
immunosuppression and/or topical therapy (further referred as ‘nonsevere rejection episodes’), while other acute 
rejection episodes necessitated intravenous steroid boluses and/or more potent drugs (further referred as ‘severe 
rejection episodes’) for their resolution. In the frst step of the study, a total number of 24 serum samples from 
all 6 patients with a follow-up range of 12–54 months was included in the proteomic biomarker discovery with 
SOMAscan: 5 samples represented nonsevere rejection episodes, 6 samples represented severe rejection episodes 
and 13 samples represented no-rejection episodes. Subsequently, technical validation of SOMAscan results was 
performed on an ELISA platform (Fig. 1). None of the included rejection samples were from antibody-mediated 
rejection episodes. To demonstrate the diferences between no-rejection, nonsevere rejection and severe rejection 
states, a set of representative clinical pictures and biopsy fndings are shown in Fig. 2.
Signature of 5 serum proteins discriminates best severe rejection from nonsevere and no-rejection 
episodes. Te SOMAscan experiment provided us expression values for 1,310 proteins for every serum sample analyzed. We expected the highest biological variability between the no-rejection and severe rejection states 
(Fig. 3). Indeed, MMP3 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3), ACY1 (Aminoacylase-1), IL1R2 (Interleukin-1 receptor 
type 2), SERPINA4 (Kallistatin) and CPB2 (Carboxypeptidase B2) were found to be signifcantly upregulated 
proteins between the no-rejection and severe rejection serum samples (Table 3). MMP3 demonstrated the highest 
log2 fold change (FC) of 2.07, followed by ACY1 (log2FC=1.54) and IL1R2 (log2FC=1.05). Te signature of the

Figure 1. Scheme of the study design. 24 serum samples from all 6 face transplant patients representing norejection (n=13), nonsevere rejection (n=5) and severe rejection (n=6) were included into the SOMAscan 
analysis. Severe rejection episodes required steroid bolus or other more potent drugs for resolution, while 
nonsevere rejection episodes were reversed by maintenance immunosuppression adjustment and/or topical 
therapy only. To deem a sample as ‘rejection’, two conditions had to be met simultaneously: Biopsy of grade II 
or higher and necessity of anti-rejection therapy. Technical validation of SOMAscan data was performed on an 
ELISA platform.

downregulated (SHBG) during severe rejection as opposed to nonsevere rejection. No proteins were found to be 
signifcantly diferent between no-rejection and nonsevere rejection episodes, suggesting that nonsevere rejections are not able to trigger systemic response to an extent which could lead to major changes of protein levels 
measured in blood. Tis hypothesis can also be made visual by the principal component analysis where every 
individual sample is represented by a single point in a bidimensional space (Fig. 4B). Analysis based on the 5 
signature proteins revealed that no-rejection and severe rejection samples can be found in two distinct clusters,

clinical practice includes assessment of clinical presentation and biopsy fndings from both face allograf and

was marked by facial erythema and edema. Te biopsy showed grade III in both face allograf and sentinel fap. 
Te therapy included strong systemic immunosuppression with ATG (severe rejection). Te circulating levels 
of MMP3 were remarkably elevated during this episode. In contrast, the levels of MMP3 were comparable to a 
no-rejection state at POM12, although the patient had signs of hyperpigmentation in his face as well as grade 
III and II biopsy results in his face allograf and sentinel fap, respectively. Tis rejection episode required only 
topical therapy and adjustment of maintenance immunosuppression for resolution (nonsevere rejection).

separated by the frst principal component. On the other hand, nonsevere rejection samples were found to predominantly cluster with the no-rejection samples (Fig. 4B).

SOMAscan analysis are reproducible with ELISA. We selected MMP3 based on its ranking as the top protein in 
discriminative signature identifed as well as its known role in infammatory processes and tissue repair (Fig. 1). 
Indeed, we found high correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation coefcient rs=0.99) of the SOMAscan and ELISA 
data for the MMP3 protein (Fig. 5), demonstrating that the SOMAscan data accurately refect the relative protein 
expression levels. For better overview, individual MMP3 ELISA values for every included serum sample are also 
presented in Table 2. MMP3 ELISA further showed that severe rejections displayed signifcantly higher levels of 
MMP3 as compared to no-rejection (p=0.0009) and nonsevere rejection (p=0.0173) episodes (Fig. 6A). To evaluate the value of MMP3 as a biomarker for transplant rejection, we generated a receiver operating characteristic 
curve from the ELISA data of the no-rejection and severe rejection serum samples. We found good performance 
(AUC=0.9487; 95% CI 0.8409 to 1) for MMP3 as a diagnostic marker of severe rejection episodes (Fig. 6B). 
Similar performance (AUC=0.9333; 95% CI 0.7797 to 1) could also be achieved in discrimination of nonsevere 
from severe rejection episodes (Fig. 6B). In this context, MMP3 levels with cut-of value of 57 ng/mL indicated 
presence of severe rejection with 83.33% sensitivity and 100% specifcity. Since not all patients had a severe rejection event, we excluded samples from patients 1, 4 and 6 who didn’t experience any severe rejections and confrmed the fndings above (Supplementary Fig. S1). Te MMP3 levels were not notably elevated before the onset 
of acute rejection in most of the patients (Fig. 2, Table 2). Further, no statistically signifcant diference in MMP3 
levels based on diferent grades of rejection was demonstrated (Fig. 7), which could support the hypothesis that 
histological grades alone based on small superfcial skin sampling of the graf might not accurately represent the 
severity of acute rejection.
Metallopeptidase activity is associated with severe rejection. Te advantage of proteomic studies over gene expression studies is that protein synthesis is more likely to represent the molecular phenotype 
and functional changes than just the gene expression. In order to assess the molecular pathways associated with 
acute rejection, we performed gene ontology analysis of the fve signifcantly upregulated proteins during severe 
rejection according to the PANTHER classifcation system, which identifed one signifcant pathway activation: 
Metallopeptidase activity (FDR 0.035, Fold Enrichment=66.1). As expected, MMP3, CBP2 and ACY1 were 
found to be enriched in this pathway. Tis result further supports a potential pathophysiological role of MMP3 in 
rejection process of face allografs.
Discussion
In the present study, we show that the SOMAscan proteomics platform is able to identify potential biomarkers of 
face transplant rejection. A signature of 5 proteins could separate severe rejection episodes from both no-rejection 
and nonsevere rejection episodes. Consecutive technical validation with ELISA showed high data correlation for 
the MMP3 protein as well as signifcant increase of MMP3 during severe acute rejection episodes as opposed to 
nonsevere/no-rejection episodes. SOMAscan has been linked to biomarker discovery of various diseases such 
as cardiovascular diseases21,22, cancer23–25, Alzheimer’s disease26,27, Duchenne dystrophy28 or tuberculosis29,30. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, no published study evaluated its utility for the feld of transplantation 
to date. Most of the approaches of proteomic biomarker discovery in the feld of transplantation rely on MS31,32. 
Teoretically, due to normal cell turnaround, any protein of the human body could be present in the blood at minimal concentration33. To cover all these proteins, a potential assay should pose a dynamic range of more than 12 logs 
of concentration34. Despite of constant improvements in MS technologies, a trade-of in analyzing complex samples between the comprehensiveness, dynamic range (sensitivity), reproducibility and quantifcation still exists35. 
On the other hand, immunoassays based on antibody detection provide the advantage of very high sensitivity for 
Figure 5. Correlation between SOMAscan and ELISA measurements of MMP3 serum levels. High correlation 
(Rs=0.99) was found between SOMAscan and ELISA data for the MMP3 protein, demonstrating that

protein detection up to attomolar concentrations36. However, these assays might be prone to cross-reactivity issues 
and cannot be highly multiplexed due to a typical dynamic range of only 2–4 logs37. Te SOMAscan platform aims 
to fll the gap between the proteomic biomarker discovery platforms by utilizing a modifed aptamer-based protein 
detection approach20. According to the manufacturer, SOMAscan is able to assess more than 1,300 proteins simultaneously with sensitivity of 38 fM and dynamic range of more than 8 logs from just 50 µL of biological sample38. 
Taken all together, these advantages led us to evaluate the utility of SOMAscan in face transplantation rejection 
biomarker discovery as a potential alternative to other proteomic platforms.
We report that severe rejection episodes requiring more extensive therapeutic modalities were mainly associated with higher serum levels of MMP3. MMP3 is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in the breakdown of 
extracellular matrix in both normal physiological processes and in disease. Presently, not much is known about 
the role of this protein in transplant rejection of composite allografs. Nonetheless, MMP3 has been previously 
described as prognostic biomarker in SOT39,40. A report from kidney transplantation revealed that patients with 
chronic transplant nephropathy had signifcantly higher levels of circulating proMMP3 (inactive precursor of 
MMP3) as compared to patients with acute rejection, stable graf function or healthy individuals. Further, MMP3 
levels were positively correlated with elevated creatinine levels in these patients, indicating a potential pathogenic 
role of MMP3 in chronic transplant nephropathy39. However, it is important to note that in the aforementioned 
study, the inactive form of MMP3 (proMMP3) was measured. Te role of MMP3 has also been studied in context 
of allogenic hematopoietic cell and lung transplantation. Tis MS-driven proteomic study with subsequent ELISA 
verifcation identifed high plasma levels of MMP3 to be associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome post 
Figure 6. Results of the MMP3 ELISA. (A) A total of 24 serum samples from no-rejection (n=13), nonsevere 
rejection (n=5) and severe rejection (n=6) groups were included in ELISA validation of the SOMAscan 
results. Serum samples taken at time-points of severe rejections showed signifcantly higher levels of MMP3 as 
compared to samples from no-rejection (p=0.0009) and nonsevere rejection (p=0.0173) time-points. Data 
is presented as boxplots: Boxes delineate 1st (lower border) and 3rd (upper border) quartiles from the median

transplantation40. Further, similarly to our study, MMP3 appeared to be a diagnostic marker, since the levels of 
MMP3 were not signifcantly elevated at time-points before the onset of the pathologic condition40. In composite 
grafs, skin is considered to be the most immunogenic tissue5
 and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen 
or elastic fbers are an essential part of the dermis composition in the skin41. Terefore, MMP3 might play a role 
in the pathophysiological processes taking place in the skin during rejection by cleaving these proteins. However, 
the role of MMPs goes far beyond that, highlighted by their involvement in signaling and phenotypic changes to 
cells/tissues, which in turn links them closely to infammatory conditions, tumor metastasis, vessel remodeling 
or reparative mechanisms such as wound healing42. MMPs, including MMP3, are well known to be expressed 
by infammatory cells; however, several studies demonstrated that epithelial cells and fbroblasts are also able of 
MMPs production, which supports the direct participation of these enzymes in the wound repair and remodeling 
mechanisms43–45. Indeed, MMP3-defcient mice show impaired wound healing due to decreased wound contraction capacity46. Taken all together, our results indicate that elevated circulating MMP3 levels during severe acute 
rejection episodes might be a representation of ongoing tissue damage and repair. Tese fndings let us further 
hypothesize that such rejection episodes could lead in the long-term to chronic skin changes, such as altered 
extracellular matrix composition. However, this hypothesis needs to be confrmed with histological studies.
Te literature on non-invasive biomarkers in face transplantation or VCA in general is scarce, probably 
because of the relatively novel nature of these procedures and limited understanding of the immunological 
responses associated with this kind of transplantation. Most of the biomarkers related to transplant rejection in 
VCA were evaluated from biopsies in experimental and clinical setting47–49. However, skin biopsy is associated 
with morbidity to the patient such as scarring, risk of infection due to break in skin barrier or even potential rejection triggered through innate immune activation afer biopsy injury. Further, histopathologic grading by the Banf 
classifcation is semi-quantitative and subject to sampling bias based on the small representative sample that may 
miss a rejection process by the patchy nature of its presentation12,50. Also, the routine 4 mm punch skin biopsy 
does not assess deeper allograf tissues for rejection. Te histological assessment might be additionally prone to 
intra- and interobserver variability, since the diferentiation between “mild” (grade I) and “moderate” (grade II) 
perivascular infammatory infltrate is not objectively defned15. Last but not least, the clinical relevance of mild 
forms of rejection (grade I) by Banf grading is unclear too and justifes the question whether grade I rejections 
in face transplantation should be treated51. In our center, we don’t consider grade I rejection for anti-rejection 
treatment anymore. We see biopsy as central part of the clinical decision process but not the only criterion to 
initiate therapy52. Terefore, we include in our decision algorithm also other factors such as clinical presentation 
or medical history (e.g. resolving rejection, exposure to environmental conditions). Te potential development of 
a systemic non-invasive biomarker of severe rejection in face transplantation is clinically promising by allowing 
to complement the clinical and biopsy data in the decision of treatment options.
All the limitations of the conventional diagnosis of rejection from biopsies are underlined by the fact that no 
correlation between histological Banf grades and therapy has been established in VCA yet13,14,53. Severe rejection 
episodes are expected to be associated with strong systemic immune response which could be potentially measured in blood circulation. Unfortunately, no such markers of systemic activation are available in VCA to date. 
Tus, non-invasive biomarkers are of high demand for our feld. Studying the same 6 face grafed patients as in 
the present study, our group found that acute cell-mediated rejection episodes were characterized by increase in 
IFN-γ/IL-17-producing cells and decrease of FoxP3+cells in peripheral blood16. In the present study we demonstrate that elevated MMP3 levels correlate with severe rejections that required strong systemic immunosuppression. While SOMAscan is not available for biomarker discovery in every center performing face transplantation, 
the high correlation with ELISA data encourages us to see MMP3 as a potential biomarker, since ELISA can be

stratifed according to the histological Banf grades of rejection. A trend towards higher MMP3 levels with 
increasing Banf grades could be observed, however no statistically signifcant diference in serum protein levels 
between any grade of rejection could be demonstrated. Data is presented as scatter dot plot showing every

performed routinely in any hospital. Terefore, this report provides one of the frst and important pieces of evidence that molecular non-invasive markers could enhance the diagnostic armamentarium available to clinicians 
who manage rejection in VCA.
However, our study has several limitations. One of them is that it is difcult to draw conclusions from 6 
patients. Indeed, we observed signifcant variability in the serum reactivity between the patients, which made the 
data analysis more challenging. Nonetheless, just 40 face transplants have been performed worldwide to date and 
our patient cohort is one of the largest in the world3
. Furthermore, face transplantation is the most challenging 
transplant so far performed with extremely high rejection rates8
. Terefore, we believe that the evidence drawn 
from these patients might be relevant for the whole VCA community. Te single center nature of this study is also 
another limitation. It is reasonable to think that in centers with other immunosuppressive strategies and rejection 
diagnosis/treatment algorithms, the results might be diferent. Tus, it is important to validate our fndings with 
larger independent patient cohorts in the future. Further studies should also focus on evaluation of molecular 
patterns of subclinical rejection or other infammatory skin disorders to make drawing a clear line between these 
diferent entities easier for the physicians. Eventually, this might lead to better tailoring of immunosuppressive 
regimens as well as prevention of acute and chronic rejection.
Overall, face transplantation is now a reality for patients with signifcant facial deformities and is associated 
with good mid-term outcomes. However, the high prevalence of rejection urges us to better understand the 
immune-mediated process and the development of non-invasive biomarkers for the detection of rejection. In 
this pilot study, we utilize a novel proteomic platform in VCA recipients to detect severe rejection and we hope to 
extend this initial observation with a multicenter study.
Methods
Study approval. All 6 patients gave written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01281267) for face transplantation, as approved by the institutional review 
board (IRB) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Protocol #: 2008BP00055). No organs/tissues were procured 
from prisoners. Te organs were procured following the regulations and guidelines of the New England Organ 
Bank (NEOB) and all transplants were performed at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. All patients gave written 
informed consent to collect and process their blood samples as approved by the IRB at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital (Protocol #: 2010P000743). All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant institutional guidelines and regulations described above. All photographs of patients in this manuscript were produced 
by the investigators and the patients had provided informed consent for publication of identifying information/
images in an online open-access publication.
Patients and immunosuppression. Six patients were transplanted with facial allografs between March 
2011 and October 2014. Donors and recipients were matched according to sex, skin color and ABO compatibility, 
in addition to a negative T- and B-cell cytotoxic crossmatch. Te only exception was a highly sensitized patient 
with a high panel reactive antibody (98%), in which transplant occurred across a weakly positive cytotoxic T-cell 
crossmatch (20%)54. None of the patients ever received transplants other than VCA. Further patients’ demographic details are given in Table 1.
All patients received mycophenolate mofetil (1,000 mg), methylprednisolone (500 mg), and rabbit 
anti-thymoglobulin (1.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) for induction therapy starting at the time of transplant. Afer 
transplantation, the maintenance immunosuppression typically consisted of mycophenolate mofetil (1,000mg 
twice daily), tacrolimus (adjusted to achieve target levels of 8–12ng/mL) and prednisone taper16. With time, we 
attempted to withdraw steroids and reduce overall maintenance immunosuppression drug doses if permitted by 
the clinical and histological graf stability55. In case of acute cellular rejection, the rescue therapy was approached 
by one or a combination of these modalities: steroid bolus (methylprednisolone 500mg daily for 3 days followed 
by a taper), adjustment of maintenance immunosuppression or topical therapy. For steroid refractory rejection 
episodes, anti-thymoglobulin or alemtuzumab were further considered. All acute rejection episodes were successfully managed and no face graf losses, deaths or re-transplantation occurred.
Diagnosis of rejection. Face allograf biopsies were performed at 3, 6, 12 months and then yearly as well as 
during suspected rejection. An acute rejection was usually suspected in case of sudden change of graf appearance 
such as erythema, edema, exanthema or mucosa lesions. Tis might have been accompanied by pain or overall worsening of the general condition of the patient. Acute rejection was then diagnosed from formalin-fxed, 
parafn-embedded 4-mm skin punch biopsies (corresponding to serum samples) in accordance to the Banf 
classifcation of skin-containing composite tissues11 with following grades: grade 0 = ‘no or rare infammatory infiltrates’; grade I (mild) = ‘mild perivascular infiltration’ (with no epidermal involvement); grade II 
(moderate)=‘moderate-to-severe perivascular infammation with or without mild epidermal and/or adnexal 
involvement’; grade III (severe)=‘dense infammation and epidermal involvement with epithelial apoptosis, dyskeratosis, and/or keratinolysis’; grade IV (necrotizing acute rejection)=‘frank necrosis of epidermis or other skin 
structures’. Te biopsy grade was determined as a consensus opinion of at least two independent dermatopathologists (C.G.L. and G.F.M.). A rejection episode was defned as grade II or higher, which required at least one of 
the treatment modalities described above. Te clinical presentation (including sentinel fap appearance), medical 
history and environmental factors (e.g., exposure to sun) were also taken into account before an anti-rejection 
treatment was initiated.
Serum sample collection. Venous blood samples were prospectively collected in Red-Top tubes (no anticoagulant) from transplant recipients at these time-points: pre-transplantation and post-transplantation at 24hours, 
1 week, 3, 6, 12 months, followed by six-monthly intervals; and during suspected rejection. In case of suspected

rejection, the samples were taken before therapy was initiated. Serum was isolated from each blood sample and 
stored at −80 °C in the tissue repository where it could be retrospectively accessed for the proteomic analysis. 
Once available rejection serum samples were identifed, the samples immediately preceding the rejection episodes 
were selected in order to evaluate the potential predictive value of protein biomarkers.
Proteomic analysis using the slow-of-rate-modifed aptamer SOMAscan platform. SOMAscan 
analysis (SomaLogic; Boulder, CO) using longitudinal serum samples from six patients with face transplant were 
performed at the BIDMC Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center. Samples were run 
using the SOMAscan Assay Kit for human serum, 1.3k (cat. #900–00012), according to the standard protocol for 
serum from SomaLogic, as described previously56. Five pooled serum controls and one no-protein bufer control 
were run in parallel with the serum samples. Median normalization and calibration of the data was performed 
according to the standard quality control protocols at SomaLogic. All samples passed the established quality 
control criteria. A full list of proteins included in the SOMAscan v1.3k assay can be viewed in Supplementary 
Table S1.
ELISA validation of SOMAscan. Serum concentrations of MMP-3 from the 6 patients at various time 
points were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a commercially available kit (R&D 
Systems cat. #DMP300, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All standards and samples were run in duplicate. ELISA plates were read using a BioTek MX plate reader at Optical Density (OD)=450. 
A 4-parameter logistic curve was used with fnal calculations determined in an Microsof Excel (Redmond, WA) 
template containing built in macros for optimizing the best-ft model.
Statistical analysis. Raw SOMAscan data handling, quality-control and log2-transformation for further 
statistical analysis was carried out with readat package57. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check normal distribution of serum levels for each protein in the dataset. Diferences in protein serum levels across ‘rejection’ and 
‘no-rejection’ groups were calculated via empirical Bayes moderation of the standard errors from linear model 
fts using limma package58, as well as using non-parametric pairwise Wilcoxon test. For all multiple comparisons, 
p-values were adjusted with FDR controlling procedure59. Heatmaps and cluster dendrograms were built with 
heatmap.2 command (Euclidean measure for distance matrix and complete agglomeration method for clustering) 
within the gplots package60. Principal component analysis was carried out with prcomp function within stats package61. Plots for principal component analysis were done with plotly package62. Gene ontology overrepresentation 
analysis was carried out with PANTHER (version 13.1) using Fisher’s Exact with FDR multiple test correction63. 
Statistical signifcance of the ELISA data was evaluated with non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test or 
Kruskal-Wallis test. All statistical computing was carried out in R statistical environment61. Te threshold for 
statistical signifcance was set as p<0.05, and for multiple comparisons FDR-adjusted p<0.1.
