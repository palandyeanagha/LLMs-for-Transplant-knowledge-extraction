ABSTRACT
Introduction: Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) increases
the risk of variceal rebleeding in liver cirrhosis.
However, the strategy for preventing variceal rebleeding
in cirrhotic patients with PVT has not been explored.
This study aims to evaluate whether the transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or
conventional therapy is preferable for the prevention of
variceal rebleeding in liver cirrhosis patients with PVT.
Methods and analysis: This is a randomised
controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of
TIPS versus conventional therapy (ie, endoscopic
therapy combined with non-selective β-blockers and
anticoagulants) for the prevention of variceal
rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with non-tumoral PVT.
A total of 50 cirrhotic patients with PVT (thrombus
>50% of portal vein lumen occupancy) and a history of
variceal bleeding will be stratified according to the
Child-Pugh class and degree of PVT, and randomised
into the TIPS and conventional therapy groups. The
primary objective was to compare the incidence of
variceal rebleeding between the two groups. The
secondary objectives were to compare the overall
mortality, variceal rebleeding-related mortality, portal
vein recanalisation and complications between the two
groups, and to observe the progression of PVT in
patients without portal vein recanalisation.
Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved
by the ethics committee of Xijing hospital (No.
20110224-5), and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01326949). All participants give written informed
consent. The first patient was recruited into our study
on 4 June 2011. A total of 29 patients were recruited
through 5 March 2013 (14 and 15 patients assigned to
the TIPS and conventional therapy groups,
respectively). If TIPS is superior to conventional
therapy for the prevention of variceal rebleeding in
cirrhotic patients with PVT, TIPS might be
recommended as the first-line therapy in such patients.
But a small sample size potentially limits the
generalisation of our conclusions.
Trial registration: This study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov on 29 March 2011. The trial
registration number is NCT01326949.
Trial status: The first patient was recruited into our
study on 4 June 2011. A total of 29 patients were
recruited through 5 March 2013 (14 and 15 patients
assigned to the TIPS and conventional therapy groups,
respectively).
INTRODUCTION
Variceal bleeding is a common and serious
complication of advanced liver cirrhosis.1–3
The incidence of a first variceal bleeding
within 1 year is about 12% in cirrhotic
patients with gastro-oesophageal varices.2 3
The incidence of variceal rebleeding within
1 year is 60% in cirrhotic patients with a
history of variceal bleeding, and the mortality
from each rebleeding episode is nearly
20%.2–4 The presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) further increases the incidence
of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients.5
The efficacies of anticoagulation therapy
and the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for recanalising PVT in
liver cirrhosis have been shown in several
case series.6–11 However, the limitations of
the two treatment modalities are clear. First,
anticoagulation therapy appears to be effective for recanalising partial PVT rather than
complete PVT or cavernous transformation
of the portal vein.12 13 Second, if anticoagulation therapy was used in cirrhotic patients
with a history of variceal bleeding, the risk or
severity of bleeding might be further exacerbated.14 15 Third, the TIPS technique in the

presence of PVT is relatively difficult,16 and the
procedure-related complications are potentially lethal.17
Owing to the absence of randomised controlled studies,
no definite treatment algorithm for the management of
PVT in liver cirrhosis has been well established in the
Baveno V consensus and recent American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines on the management of vascular disorders of the
liver.18 19
On the other hand, the current therapeutic algorithm
for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in liver
cirrhosis includes non-selective β-blockers (NSBBs) combined with endoscopic therapy (ET) as the first-line
choice of therapy and TIPS as the second-line
therapy.2 3 18 This recommendation is mainly because the
rate of hepatic encephalopathy is significantly higher in
patients undergoing TIPS than in those receiving NSBBs
and ET, but the overall survival is not improved.20 21
However, the therapeutic algorithm could not be readily
extrapolated to cirrhotic patients with PVT.
We hypothesise that TIPS may be superior to conventional therapy for the prevention of variceal rebleeding
in liver cirrhosis patients with non-tumoral PVT.22 Thus,
a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted
at our centre to explore this issue.
METHODS
Study design
This is a randomised controlled study evaluating TIPS
versus conventional therapy (ie, ET combined with
NSBBs and anticoagulants) for the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with non-tumoral
PVT (figure 1). All patients who meet the entry criteria
will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either
TIPS or conventional therapy. This study is being performed in the Departments of Liver Disease, Digestive
Interventional Radiology, Endoscopy and Ultrasound of
Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military
Medical University.
Inclusion criteria
1. Written informed consent.
2. Adult patients (aged 18–75 years).
3. Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (liver cirrhosis is diagnosed by clinical presentations, laboratory tests,
images and liver biopsies).
4. Diagnosis of PVT (axial CT scans demonstrate that
the thrombus occupies >50% of the portal vein
lumen with or without portal cavernoma).
5. History of variceal bleeding (all patients will undergo
endoscopy to confirm that the upper gastrointestinal
bleeding originates from the oesophageal and gastric
varices rather than other potential sources).
Exclusion criteria
1. Active variceal bleeding (the time frame of the
acute bleeding episode should be 120 h18).
2. Thrombus occupies <50% of the portal vein lumen.
3. The thrombosed portal trunk is progressed to the
fibrotic cord (the patients will be included if the
interventional radiologists consider that the diameter of a collateral vessel is large enough to place a
stent8 17).
4. History of TIPS placement or shunt surgery (the
patients will be included if the surgical shunt is completely occluded or invalid).
5. Concomitant renal insufficiency (serum creatine
level is 1.5-fold beyond the upper limit of normal
(ie, >170 μmol/L)).
6. Severe liver insufficiency (the serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level is
threefold beyond the upper limit of normal (ie,
>120 U/L); or the total bilirubin level is threefold
beyond the upper limit of normal (ie >60 μmol/L)).
7. Severe cardiopulmonary diseases.
8. Uncontrolled systemic infection or sepsis.
9. Malignancy or other serious medical illness that may
reduce life expectancy.
10. Contraindications for propranolol.
11. Contraindications for heparin or warfarin.

12. Absolute contraindications for TIPS (ie, congestive
heart failure, multiple hepatic cysts, unrelieved
biliary obstruction and severe pulmonary
hypertension).16
13. HIV infection (before enrolment, HIV Ag/Ab is
measured in all patients).

Informed consent
All relevant information regarding the clinical trial is
included in informed consent forms in the Chinese language. Further, the investigators (CH, GH, ZY and/or
XQ) will provide a detailed explanation of this trial to
the eligible patients. Informed consent must be signed
by all patients or their relatives if the informed consent
cannot be signed by the patients themselves. All
patients’ personal data and medical information will be
kept confidential. All patients will be permitted to withdraw from this trial at any time.
Randomisation
After the eligible patients give informed written consent,
they will be stratified according to the Child-Pugh class
(Child-Pugh class A=5–6 points, Child-Pugh class B=7–9
points, Child-Pugh class C=10–15 points)23 and the
degree of PVT (partial obstruction, complete obstruction, obliterative portal vein).8 24 The Child-Pugh score
is calculated based on the five clinical and laboratory
variables (serum total bilirubin: <30 μmol/L=1 point,
30–50 μmol/L=2 points, >50 μmol/L=3 points; serum
albumin: >35 g/L=1 point; 28–35 g/L=2 points, <28 g/
L=3 points; international normalised ratio (INR):
<1.70=1 point, 1.71–2.20=2 points, >2.20=3 points;
ascites: no=1 point, mild=2 points, moderate or severe=3
points; encephalopathy: no=1 point, grade I-II=2 points,
grade III-IV=3 points). Degree of PVT is evaluated based
on the contrast-enhanced CT scans findings (partial
obstruction: beyond half of the portal vein lumen occupancy; complete PVT: nearly entire portal vein lumen
occupancy; obliterative portal vein: main portal vein disappears or progresses into a fibrotic cord). The patients
will then be randomised into the TIPS and conventional
therapy groups by means of a central randomisation
system (http://openrct.fmmu.edu.cn). This system has
been established by two investigators (HC and JX) from
the Department of Statistics of the Fourth Military
Medical University.
TIPS group
Patients assigned to the TIPS group will undergo TIPS
insertions within 48 h of randomisation. A step-wise
TIPS strategy has been described in our previous
studies.8 17 25 As Viatorr-covered stents are not approved
by the State Food and Drug Administration in the
Chinese mainland, Fluency covered stents (Bard
Peripheral Vascular, Bard, Inc) with a diameter of 8 mm
and a length of 6–10 cm will be employed in our study.
If the residual thrombus remains at the distal end of the
stent, an indwelling venous catheter will be placed in
the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and
splenic vein for local thrombolysis with bolus infusions
of urokinase (500 000 units twice a day) for 3 days.
Preoperative and postoperative portosystemic pressure
gradients (PSGs) will be measured. If the occluded main
portal vein or superior mesenteric vein cannot be recanalised or the TIPS insertion fails, the patients will be
treated with conventional therapy.
After the TIPS insertions, intravenous infusions of
heparin (50 mg twice a day) for 5–7 days followed by
oral warfarin for 6–12 months will be routinely prescribed at doses that achieve an INR of up to two times
the upper limit of normal for the prevention of shunt
dysfunction. Intravenous L-ornithine-L-aspartate (20 g
once a day) with or without branched-chain amino acids
for 4–5 days will be administered for the prevention of
portosystemic encephalopathy. Intravenous antibiotics
for 4–5 days will be prescribed for the prevention of
operation-related infections. If any evidence of shunt
dysfunction is observed, TIPS revision by balloon angioplasty and additional stent-placement will be planned,
and thereafter, long-term anticoagulation will be prescribed. If the shunt dysfunction cannot be revised, the
patients will be treated with conventional therapy.
As we have described previously,8 shunt dysfunction
will be suspected in any one of the following conditions:
(1) recurrent variceal bleeding; (2) recurrent or gradually worsening ascites or (3) the maximum flow velocity
within the shunt is less than 50 cm/s or the flow velocity
within the shunt is absent on colour Doppler ultrasound
(CDUS). Suspected dysfunction will be further confirmed if shunt stenosis is greater than 50% on portography and/or PSG is beyond 15 mm Hg.
Conventional therapy group
ET: Patients assigned to the conventional therapy group
will undergo ET within 48 h of randomisation.
According to the Baveno V and AASLD practice guidelines for the management of variceal bleeding,3 18 26
varices are ligated every 1–2 weeks until they are obliterated or are considered inappropriate for ligation by
endoscopists. Endoscopic sclerotherapy and/or cyanoacrylate glue injection are employed for gastric varices.
Endoscopic screening for recurrent varices is arranged
within 1–3 months after variceal obliteration, and a
repeat endoscopy is then conducted every 6 months.
NSSBs: Patients assigned to the conventional therapy
group will receive NSSBs within 5–7 days after ET.
According to the AASLD practice guidelines for the
management of variceal bleeding,3 26 propranolol
should be started at a dose of 20 mg twice a day and be
adjusted to the maximum tolerated dose (160 mg twice
a day) or until the heart rate is reduced to 55 bpm or
25% from baseline.

Anticoagulation: Patients assigned to the conventional
therapy group will receive anticoagulants within 2 weeks
after variceal obliteration. According to the American
College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the
management of deep vein thrombosis,27 intravenous
infusions of heparin are initially administered at a dose
of 1000 units/h for 5 days. Subsequently, oral warfarin
should be started at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day and be
adjusted to achieve an INR of up to two times the upper
limit of normal or a target INR range 2–3. Oral warfarin
therapy will continue for 6–12 months.
NSBBs-induced adverse events include lightheadedness, fatigue and shortness of breath, while the
anticoagulant-induced adverse events include bleeding,
thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis, osteoporosis, skin necrosis, alopecia, hypersensitivity reactions
and hypoaldosteronism. If the adverse events are considered mild or moderate, the treatment will be continued
or the dose of these drugs will be reduced until they disappear. If the adverse events are considered severe or
the patients are unable to tolerate these drugs, the treatment will be discontinued.
TIPS rescue: Patients assigned to the conventional
therapy group will receive TIPS as a rescue therapy in
any one of the following conditions: (1) one episode of
clinically significant variceal rebleeding after ET resulting in the development of hypovolaemic shock or a 3 g
drop in haemoglobin within any 24 h period if no transfusion is administered18; (2) two episodes of clinically
significant rebleeding (ie, melena or haematemesis) or
(3) one episode of clinically significant rebleeding with
pampiniform or racemose varices on endoscopy that are
considered inappropriate for ligation or sclerotherapy
by endoscopists.
Primary objective
To compare the rate of variceal rebleeding between the
patients undergoing TIPS and those receiving ET combined with NSSBs and anticoagulants.
Secondary objectives
1. To compare the rate of overall death and variceal
bleeding-related death between the two groups (subgroup analyses will be performed according to the
Child-Pugh class and grade of PVT).
2. To compare the rate of portal vein recanalisation
between the two groups (subgroup analyses will be
performed according to the Child-Pugh class and
grade of PVT).
3. To compare the rate of procedure-related complications between the two groups.
4. To compare the rate of hepatic encephalopathy after
treatment between the two groups.
5. To evaluate the rate of shunt dysfunction in the TIPS
group.
6. To observe the progression of PVT in patients
without portal vein recanalisation.

The grade of varices will be evaluated by endoscopy.
The Child-Pugh and MELD scores will be calculated.
The extension and degree of PVT will be evaluated by
abdominal CDUS and CT scans. According to previous
studies,7 30 31 portal vein recanalisation is considered
complete if the portal vein trunk, superior mesenteric
vein and splenic vein are patent; portal vein recanalisation is considered partial if the degree of thrombosis
within the portal vein trunk is decreased. Additionally,
all enrolled patients will have telephone follow-up with
one investigator (WZ) regarding their conditions and
drug use every week in the first month and once per
month thereafter.
As hepatic encephalopathy occurs, the following data will be
collected:
1. The number of episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. The starting time and duration of every episode of
hepatic encephalopathy.
3. The grade of every episode of hepatic encephalopathy according to the West Haven Criteria.32
4. The treatment and outcome of every episode of
hepatic encephalopathy.
As shunt dysfunction occurs, the following data will be
collected:
1. The number of episodes of shunt dysfunction.
2. The starting time and duration of every episode of
shunt dysfunction.
3. The diagnosis, treatment and outcome of every
episode of shunt dysfunction.
As variceal bleeding recurs, the following data will be
collected:
1. The number of variceal rebleeds.
2. The starting time and duration of every episode of
variceal rebleeding.
3. The causes of every episode of variceal rebleeding.
4. The treatment and outcome of every episode of variceal rebleeding.
As any patient dies, the following data will be collected:
1. The time of death after enrolment.
2. The cause of death.
Sample size calculation
No study has yet compared the outcome between cirrhotic patients with PVT receiving TIPS and those receiving conventional therapy. The sample size was
determined on the basis of the results of 12 RCTs in
which the rate of variceal bleeding was compared
between cirrhotic patients without PVT treated by TIPS
and ET (table 1).33–44 The pooled rates of variceal
rebleeding are estimated to be 20% and 43.4% in the
TIPS and ET groups, respectively. Notably, bare stents
were employed in these 12 RCTs, but covered stents will
be used in our study.
As the rate of shunt dysfunction is lower in patients
with covered stents than in those with bare stents,45 46
the rate of variceal rebleeding should be lower in the
patients allocated to the TIPS group in our study. On
the other hand, given that the rate of variceal bleeding
is significantly aggravated by the presence of PVT,5 the
rate of variceal rebleeding might be higher in patients
allocated to the conventional therapy group in our
study. Thus, we presume that the rates of variceal
rebleeding will be 10% and 45% in the TIPS and conventional therapy groups, respectively. Considering a
type I (α) error of 5%, a type II (1-β) error of 20% and
a dropout rate of 10%, the total number of patients to
be recruited is 50.
Statistical analysis
All data will be analysed on the intention-to-treat population. Continuous variables will be summarised as the
mean values (±SEs) or the median values (ranges), and

DISCUSSION
Study implications
PVT increases the rate of variceal rebleeding and mortality in cirrhotic patients,5 47 thereby negatively changing
the natural history of advanced liver cirrhosis.48
However, no randomised controlled studies have evaluated which treatment modality is preferable to prevent
variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with PVT. This
study is the first RCT to explore the efficacy of TIPS and
conventional therapy for the prevention of variceal
rebleeding in such patients. Survival and portal vein
recanalisation will be compared between patients treated
by TIPS and conventional therapy. If TIPS is superior to
conventional therapy, TIPS might be recommended as
the first-line therapy in these patients. This study will
also provide information regarding the natural history of
cirrhotic patients with PVT that cannot be recanalised.
Study limitations
First, cirrhotic patients with PVT are our target population. However, the sample size was calculated according
to the previous results observed in cirrhotic patients
without PVT. Therefore, the number of patients to be
recruited in our study may be inadequate. Second,
because the primary endpoint is variceal rebleeding, the
power calculation is primarily based on a difference in
the rate of variceal rebleeding between both groups.
Thus, the data regarding mortality should not be overemphasised. Third, this study is being conducted in a
single centre with the TIPS technique experience.
Accordingly, our findings might not be promptly generalised to other centres with less experience. However, it
should be noted that an increasing trend in the number
of PVT patients undergoing TIPS has been clearly identified.17 Fourth, the most common cause of liver cirrhosis is hepatitis B virus in China, while it is alcohol abuse
in Western countries. The difference in the aetiology of
liver cirrhosis might influence the application of our
findings in Western countries. Fifth, the ‘TIPS rescue’
therapy may potentially increase the survival of patients
assigned to the conventional therapy group. Thus, the
difference in the mortality between the two treatment
modalities cannot be truly reflected. Sixth, we did not
clearly define the maximum interval from the last
episode of variceal bleeding to our randomisation.
Considering that a longer interval might be associated
with a better survival, the absence of the threshold
might produce a bias of patient selection. Certainly, this
selection bias might be minimised due to the nature of
randomisation.
