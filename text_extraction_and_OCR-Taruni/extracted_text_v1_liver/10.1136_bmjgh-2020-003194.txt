ABSTRACT
Objective This study aimed to estimate the costeffectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among 
patients with non-genotype 1 for the eradication of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in China.
Methods A decision-analytic Markov model was 
developed to estimate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) for DAAs and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin 
(PEG-RBV) from a societal perspective. The model inputs 
were derived from the literature, a patient survey, HCV 
expert opinions and a specialised drug price database 
available in China. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
evaluate the model robustness and calculate reasonable 
prices of DAAs.
Results For patients infected with HCV genotype 2, the 
pan-genotypic regimen sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/
VEL) was the most cost-effective strategy compared with 
PEG-RBV, with an ICER of US$5653/QALY. For genotype 3, 
the combination of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (SOF-DCV) 
was the most cost-effective approach, with an ICER of 
US$3314/QALY. All DAA regimens for genotype 6 were 
cost-saving, and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF-RBV) 
was the optimal regimen. One-way sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that the ICERs were most sensitive to the 
utility values, discount rate and drug costs. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated that using a threshold equal 
to one time the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 
in China (US$9769/QALY, 2018), the probability of SOF/
VEL, SOF-DCV and SOF-RBV being cost-effective was 
58%, 83% and 71% for genotype 2, 3 and 6, respectively. 
Threshold analysis showed that the price of DAAs should 
be reduced by some degree to achieve better affordability.
Conclusions DAAs were cost-effective compared with 
traditional treatments. A reasonable reduction in the price 
of DAAs will increase drug affordability and is of great 
significance as a global strategy to eradicate viral hepatitis.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become 
a global public health issue, and the relevant long-term complications, such as liver 
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, have 
imposed large health and economic burdens 
on patients. There are around 71 million 
patients infected with HCV worldwide, 
leading to approximately 399 000 deaths each 
year.
1
 In China, the incidence of HCV infection increased sharply in the last decade, and 
Key questions
What is already known?
► The direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have dramatically improved the efficacy and reduced the burden of 
adverse events, making it possible to eradicate hepatitis C virus (HCV) globally.
► The international and national studies have proved 
the cost-effectiveness of some DAAs compared with 
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-RBV) for patients with genotype 1 from a payer perspective.
What are the new findings?
► This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of all DAAs compared with PEG-RBV for patients with 
non-genotype 1 from a societal perspective in the 
Chinese setting.
► This was the first evaluation to quantitatively compare pan-genotypic regimen sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
(SOF/VEL) with other DAAs or PEG-RBV especially for 
patients with non-genotype 1 in China considering 
limited access of gene testing in underdeveloped 
areas.
► Threshold analysis was used to calculate reasonable 
prices of different DAAs to achieve better economic 
efficiency when comparing with optimal DAA regimen in each genotype.
What do the new findings imply?
► For patients with non-genotype 1 in China, DAAs 
were more cost-effective than PEG-RBV, and produced better health outcomes and higher quality of 
life.
► More importantly, reasonable reduction in the price 
of DAAs will increase drug affordability and is of 
great significance for the global strategy to eradicate 
viral hepatitis, especially for the pan-genotypic regimen SOF/VEL that can simplify the clinical pathway 
of HCV infection.

the estimated number of patients reached 9.8 million in 
2015.1 However, in the same period, the diagnosis rate 
was only 2%, and the treatment rate was less than 1% in 
China, far below the global average.2 3 Liver cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma are the leading causes of death 
from HCV. The mortality rate of liver cirrhosis caused by 
HCV in China was 0.2 per 100 000 people, and that of 
hepatocellular carcinoma was 0.4 per 100 000 people in 
2016.4
The primary aim of HCV infection treatment is to 
achieve sustained virologic response (SVR), which 
can significantly reduce the risk of progression to liver 
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.5 Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-RBV) was the standard of care 
in China before the introduction of direct-acting antivirals 
(DAAs) in 2017.6 Compared with the suboptimal efficacy 
and severe adverse events of PEG-RBV, DAAs have drastically decreased morbidity and mortality attributable to 
HCV infection. However, patients still have limited access 
to such treatments in China since several DAAs, such as 
asunaprevir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, 
elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/
VEL), were not approved through priority review procedure until 2017. In addition, DAAs were more costly than 
traditional PEG-RBV therapy, and PEG-RBV was the only 
treatment on the national drug reimbursement list until 
the end of 2019.
Although the most prevalent HCV genotype in China 
is genotype 1, patients with non-genotype 1 still account 
for 43.2%.6
 Unlike the diverse options for patients with 
genotype 1, they can only be treated with limited types 
of DAAs. Among those patients, genotypes 2 (15.8%), 3 
(8.7%) and 6 (5.7%) are the majority, as well as genotypes 4 and 5 with nearly no report.6 7 Significant regional 
differences exist in the genotype distribution. Genotypes 
2 and 3 are more prevalent in western China, and genotype 6 is more prevalent in southern China.6
At present, scant evidence is available on the costeffectiveness of DAAs for patients with non-genotype 1. 
Hence, this study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of all treatment regimens for patients with non-genotype 
1 and provide insights for the eradication of viral hepatitis in China and globally.
METHODS
Model structure and assumptions
A decision-analytic Markov model was developed based 
on the results of previous studies.8–10 Fifteen exclusive health states were addressed, as shown in figure 1: 
METAVIR liver fibrosis states (F0—no fibrosis, F1—
portal fibrosis without septa, F2—portal fibrosis with few 
septa, F3—numerous septa without cirrhosis and F4—
compensated cirrhosis), liver fibrosis states achieving 
SVR (SVR F0–F4), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation 
(LT), post liver transplantation (PLT) and death. The 
model comprised the stages of treatment and disease 
progression. Patients received different treatment regimens when entering the model. Subsequent stages were 
determined according to their initial health state and 
treatment outcome. Annual cycles and lifetime horizon 
were adopted. The key assumptions of the study were 
as follows11–14: (1) spontaneous elimination of the virus 
was not considered; (2) patients received treatment 
only once, without considering further treatment after 
treatment failure or recurrence; (3) treatment compliance was 100%; (4) patients in F0–F3 states would no 
longer experience disease progression after achieving 
SVR, while patients in F4 state with SVR and all patients 
without SVR would enter a stage of disease progression.
Characteristics of patients
The target population was treatment-naive patients 
infected with HCV genotypes 2, 3 and 6. The model 
followed up a hypothetical cohort of 10 000 patients 
for each of the three genotypes. Baseline characteristics were obtained from a cross-sectional observational 
study across China,7 where the median ages of patients 
infected with HCV genotypes 2, 3 and 6 were 48, 38 
and 35, respectively. Therefore, the study assumed that 
patients entered the model at the age of 50, 40 and 35 
for genotypes 2, 3 and 6, respectively. Based on the same 
study, the proportion of males was 50.80%, 75.80% and 
66.70% for patients infected with HCV genotypes 2, 3 
and 6, respectively.7 According to another Chinese study, 
which observed patients with HCV for 20 years, the baseline distributions of METAVIR fibrosis states were 0.80% 
(F0), 45.50% (F1), 41.30% (F2), 9.90% (F3) and 2.50% 
(F4), respectively.15
Treatment regimens and clinical inputs
Treatment regimens for each genotype were defined 
following current clinical guidelines and proposed indications for DAAs in China.6
 For patients infected with 
HCV genotype 2, four treatment regimens were estimated: PEG-RBV for 24 weeks, and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF-RBV), sofosbuvir plusdaclatasvir (SOF-DCV) 
and SOF/VEL for 12 weeks. For genotype 3, PEG-RBV 
and SOF-RBV for 24 weeks, and SOF-DCV and SOF/VEL 
for 12 weeks were considered. For genotype 6, PEG-RBV 
for 48 weeks, and SOF-RBV, SOF-DCV and SOF/VEL for 
12 weeks were considered. The primary efficacy measurement in the model was SVR, defined as an undetectable 
HCV RNA level 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.6
Available treatment regimens and the corresponding 
SVR for patients with non-cirrhosis (F0–F3) and patients 
with cirrhosis (F4) were reported in online supplemental 
table 1. The SVRs of PEG-RBV and SOF-DCV were 
derived from systematic reviews or meta-analysis.16–22 The 
SVRs of SOF-RBV and SOF/VEL were derived from three 
published clinical trials in Asian or Chinese settings.21–23
Due to limited data availability, SVR for patients with 
cirrhosis infected with genotype 6 was assigned the same 
setting as that of patients with non-cirrhosis.

Transition probabilities
Since large-sample epidemiological research is rare 
in China, this study used transition probabilities from 
other countries. Transition probabilities were assumed 
comparable among the three genotypes.14 24–26 The probabilities of liver fibrosis progression between F0 and F4 
states were derived from a meta-analysis using Markov 
maximum likelihood estimation.27 Patients in F4 state 
could progress to DC and HCC, and the respective probabilities were obtained from Dienstag et al.
28 Patients 
with DC also experienced the transition to HCC.28 Only 
patients with DC and HCC would receive a liver transplant, and the corresponding probabilities were derived 
from Townsend et al29 and Planas et al.30 After achieving 
SVR, patients in F4 state could progress to advanced liver 
disease but typically experience a lower risk than those 
who did not achieve SVR. The mortality rates associated 
with DC, HCC, LT and PLT, higher than the general 
mortality, were derived from the literature.31–34 Agespecific all-cause mortality rates were extracted from the 
life tables of the WHO member states.35 It was assumed 
that F0–F3 patients had the same mortality rates as the 
general population after achieving SVR. F4 patients 
achieving SVR and F0–F4 patients who did not achieve 
SVR had 1.436 and 2.3737 times the background mortality, 
respectively. The mortality rates were not adjusted for 
patients older than 65 due to the significantly higher 
general mortality.
Cost inputs
The societal perspective was adopted in this study. All 
costs were converted to US$ using official exchange rates 
of 2018 (US$1=￥6.62) and inflated to 2018 prices using 
the China Consumer Price Index. All costs were listed in 
online supplemental table 1.
The direct medical costs consisted of the drug, monitoring and annual liver-related health state costs. Drug 
costs were regimen-specific, with different drug prices 
and treatment duration. Additionally, drug prices were 
obtained from a local database38 reporting the price 
of drugs in each province of China. Due to the societal perspective adopted, this study used the median 
prices of different provinces paid by patients only or by 
patients and payers together with drug reimbursement. 
According to the latest guidelines for HCV infection in 
China,6
 patients should undergo genotyping and liver

fibrosis tests to assess the severity of liver disease before 
treatment, as well as routine surveillance to monitor the 
efficacy and safety of the cure during treatment. Routine 
surveillance was carried out every 3 months during treatment, including plasma HCV RNA, complete blood count 
and liver ultrasound, among others; the number of times 
patients were tested varied depending on the treatment 
duration. Based on local charges of tests and consultation 
with HCV experts, the costs of genotyping, liver fibrosis 
test and routine surveillance were set at US$63, US$21 
and US$302, respectively. Annual liver-related health 
state costs associated with F0–F4, DC and HCC were 
obtained from a study addressing the main hospitals in 
eight cities in Mainland China.39 For LT and PLT, costs 
were derived from a disease burden study for Chinese 
liver transplant patients.40 Patients in F0–F3 states with 
SVR would not incur direct medical costs any more, and 
patients in F4 state with SVR need less health resource 
utilisation, 0.709 times of those in F4 state without SVR.41
Due to limited research on direct non-medical and indirect costs of patients with HCV in China, data on these 
aspects were obtained from a patient survey conducted in 
Tianjin for centralised and standardised patient management. Adult patients with HCV receiving PEG-RBV or 
DAAs in the past few years were invited by telephone to 
participate in the survey. A total of 155 patients receiving 
PEG-RBV and 145 patients receiving DAAs were investigated in 2018–2019. Based on the characteristics of 
the HCV treatment, the direct non-medical costs were 
the transportation and nutrition costs of patients and 
their family members, and the indirect costs were the 
productivity loss of patients and their family members. 
The human capital approach was used to calculate the 
productivity loss based on working time lost and the per 
capita disposable income of China in 2018. Combined 
with treatment duration, the direct non-medical costs 
and indirect costs were calculated for each regimen.
Utility inputs
Utility inputs consisted of three parts, as shown in online 
supplemental table 1. Since Chinese utility values were 
not available, this study used data from the international 
literature. Utility values of chronic HCV states were 
derived from systematic reviews of the quality of life of 
patients with HCV.42 43 Patients would experience a utility 
decrease during treatment due to treatment-related 
adverse events, with utility decreasing by 0.11 under PEGRBV and by 0.03 under DAAs treatment.44 Utility values 
after achieving SVR for F0–F4 states were obtained from 
Wright et al45
Model analysis
The proposed model was developed in Microsoft 
Excel 2016 software (Microsoft). The future costs and 
QALYs were discounted at an annual rate of 5%.46 The 
willingness-to-pay was set at US$9769/QALY adopting 
the threshold of one time the GDP per capita of 2018 in 
China. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
illustrated as efficiency frontiers.
One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess 
the influence of changes in individual parameters on 
the model results. The costs, SVR, transition probabilities, utilities and discount rate were tested under the 
range defined in the inputs table. The 95% CI of each 
parameter was used as the lower and upper values for the 
one-way sensitivity analysis. In case, the 95% CI was not 
available, the parameter varied by ±25%. In addition, the 
discount rate ranged between 0% and 8%. The results 
were shown as tornado diagrams.
Monte Carlo simulation was performed in probabilistic sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the 
model results when all parameters varied simultaneously. A total of 1000 Monte Carlo iterations were run 
by repeatedly sampling from the distributions assigned 
to all the uncertain parameters (gamma distribution for 
costs, and beta or uniform distribution for SVR, utilities 
and transition probabilities). The results were shown as 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, which reflected 
the probabilities of the treatment regimens being costeffective at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.
Additionally, threshold analysis was performed to 
improve affordability for patients. Keeping all the other 
parameters constant, the study estimated the threshold 
price, where the treatment regimen showed equal 
economic efficiency compared with the optimal DAA 
regimen for each genotype.
Patient and public involvement
This study did not involve any direct patient and public 
involvement.
RESULTS
Base-case analysis
The base-case results were presented in table 1 and 
figure 2. For patients infected with HCV genotype 2, 
DAAs gained more QALYs compared with PEG-RBV but 
with higher costs. The efficiency frontier consisted of 
PEG-RBV and SOF/VEL. SOF-RBV and SOF-DCV were 
above the efficiency frontier due to lower effectiveness 
or higher costs. The ICERs of SOF/VEL, SOF-RBV and 
SOF-DCV versus PEG-RBV were US$5653, US$7999 and 
US$10 680/QALY, respectively. SOF/VEL was the most 
cost-effective regimen and reduced the greatest cumulative probabilities of DC and HCC by 4.29% and 3.22%, 
respectively. The results were similar for genotype 3. SOFDCV was the most cost-effective regimen, with the ICER 
of US$3314/QALY, which reduced the cumulative probabilities of DC and HCC by 8.09% and 6.26%, respectively. 
Three DAA regimens for genotype 6 were cost-saving; 
SOF-RBV was the most cost-saving approach due to its 
outstanding health benefits.
Sensitivity analysis
In one-way sensitivity analysis, the most cost-effective 
regimen compared with PEG-RBV was analysed for each

genotype. The tornado diagrams of the 10 most sensitive parameters were shown in figure 3. The ICERs were 
most sensitive to the utility of patients in F0–F3 states 
after achieving SVR, while the other factors, including 
the discount rate, drug costs and SVR, were slightly 
different. For genotypes 2 and 3, the adjustment of some 
parameters, such as the discount rate, could make the 
optimal regimen no longer cost-effective. For genotype 
6, changes in the parameters had no fundamental influence on base-case results.
The probability sensitivity analysis also used the 
most cost-effective regimen for comparison. The costeffectiveness acceptability curves showed that under a 
threshold of US$9769/QALY, the probability of SOF/
VEL, SOF-DCV and SOF-RBV being cost-effective was 
58%, 83% and 71% for genotypes 2, 3 and 6, respectively, 
as shown in figure 4. If the threshold was increased to 
three times the Chinese GDP per capita (US$29 307), the 
corresponding probability would increase to 86%, 93% 
and 72%, respectively.
Threshold analysis
We chose the optimal DAA regimen for comparison in 
threshold analysis for each genotype. For genotype 2, the 
price reduction needed for sofosbuvir and daclatasvir 
to achieve the same economic efficiency as the optimal 
regimen SOF/VEL was 8% and 41%, respectively. To 
achieve cost-saving for all regimens for genotype 2, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and SOF/VEL need a price reduction 
of 28%, 63% and 25%, respectively. For genotype 3, the 
price reduction of sofosbuvir and SOF/VEL should be 
31% and 10%, respectively, compared with the optimal 
regimen SOF-DCV. To achieve further cost-saving, sofosbuvir and SOF/VEL need to cut price by 45% and 25%, 
respectively. Since all regimens for genotype 6 were costsaving, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and SOF/VEL need to 
reduce their price by 31%, 31% and 20% to achieve the 
same economic efficiency as SOF-RBV. The threshold 
analysis results were reported in table 2.
DISCUSSION
Few studies investigated the cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for patients infected with non-genotype 
1 HCV, especially genotype 6, in China.47 48 This study 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of all available DAAs and 
PEG-RBV for patients infected with genotypes 2, 3 and 6 
in China. Base-case results demonstrated that SOF/VEL 
and SOF-RBV were more cost-effective than PEG-RBV, 
while the ICER of SOF-DCV exceeded the willingnessto-pay threshold for genotype 2. For genotype 3, SOFDCV and SOF/VEL were more cost-effective than PEGRBV, while SOF-RBV was not cost-effective. SOF-RBV, 
SOF/VEL and SOF-DCV were all economically dominant 
relative to PEG-RBV for genotype 6, as the treatment 
duration of genotypes 2 and 3 with PEG-RBV was only half 
than that of genotype 6. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
that the base-case results were robust. More importantly, 
the prices of DAA drugs need to be reduced by a range 
of 8%–63% compared with the most cost-effective DAA 
regimen for each genotype.
Several cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted 
in China. However, most studies focused on patients 
infected with genotype 1 HCV.11 39 49 Among these

studies, Chen H et al11 and Chen GF et al39 compared 
DAAs with PEG-RBV for genotype 1; however, their 
results might have potential limitations in the Chinese 
setting because information on drug costs was obtained 
from other countries (DAAs were not available in China 
at that time). Another study evaluated the pan-genotypic 
SOF/VEL with other DAAs, indicating that a lower price 
of SOF/VEL would make it more cost-effective; however, 
the generality of this study’s findings was limited because 
only genotype 1 was considered.49 Wu et al are the only 
researchers who evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
SOF-RBV and SOF-DCV for Chinese patients with nongenotype 1, showing that SOF-RBV was a cost-effective 
alternative for genotypes 2 and 3 and a cost-saving alternative for genotype 6 relative to PEG-RBV.14 However, the 
pan-genotypic SOF/VEL, which simplified the treatment, 
was not included in their study. To the authors’ knowledge, no cost-effectiveness study included all available 
DAAs for the treatment of patients with non-genotype 1 
in China. Hence, this study is likely to represent the first 
economic evaluation in this field.
The societal perspective was adopted in several 
studies mainly conducted in the USA. Two American 
studies compared the cost-effectiveness of DAAs, DAAs 
plus PEG-RBV and PEG-RBV using a similar Markov 
model.50 51 The results showed that SOF-based treatment 
was cost-effective, while affordability was to be considered. 
However, only drug-related and liver-disease-related costs 
were included, and only patients with genotype 1 were 
addressed. Another study estimating DAA regimens with 
PEG-RBV indicated that the novel treatments were costeffective compared with standard care for genotype 1 and 
probably genotype 3 but not for patients with genotype 2 
in the American setting.25 Similarly, only direct medical 
costs were included, while indirect costs due to productivity loss or non-medical costs were not calculated. When 
the costs of absenteeism, presenteeism and patient/

caregiver time were included, the DAAs were found to 
be cost-saving relative to no treatment in another American study.52 SOF-RBV was cost-effective relative to PEGRBV in patients with genotype 2, considering costs of the 
productivity loss in the Japanese scenario,53 in line with 
our results.
DAAs offer more effective, shorter and better-tolerated 
treatment options for patients; hence, a comparison 
among DAAs is needed. When compared with the 
optimal DAA regimen for each genotype, other DAAs 
need a price reduction to achieve equal economic efficiency. Since the use of SOF/VEL creates an opportunity 
to simplify the care pathway by removing the need for 
genotyping, extra direct non-medical costs such as transportation costs can be saved.49 This aspect is of particular significance for primary healthcare institutions, 
where genotyping tests cannot be accessed to manage 
patients with HCV. In this study, SOF/VEL was found to 
be cost-effective for all genotypes, while it needed a price 
reduction of 10% and 20% compared with SOF-DCV in 
genotype 2 and SOF-RBV in genotype 6, respectively.
The present analysis has several limitations. First, some 
SVR rates were derived from separate clinical trials due 
to the scarcity of head-to-head trials comparing those 
treatment regimens, which may result in biased results. 
Second, transition probabilities were derived from international research in the absence of domestic information sources. Future studies should update the analysis 
when these data are available in China. Third, utility 
values from other countries were assigned to health 
states due to the unavailability of Chinese-specific utility 
data, which may affect the accuracy of our results. In 
addition, the sample size of our patient survey needs to 
be increased to improve the generality of direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs. Finally, our results may 
differ from the final discounted prices after price negotiation in 2019 as the drug costs were obtained from 
market prices, and some newly approved regimens, such

future.
CONCLUSION
DAAs were cost-effective compared with traditional treatments for Chinese patients with non-genotype 1 HCV, 
but the ICERs of DAAs were different. To globally eradicate viral hepatitis by 2030, DAAs’ prices need to be 
reduced by some degree to improve economic efficiency 
and increase the affordability of these drugs, especially in 
developing countries.
