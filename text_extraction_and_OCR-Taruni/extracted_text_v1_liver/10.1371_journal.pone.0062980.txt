Abstract
Background: The benefit of using serological assays based on HEV genotype 3 in industrialised settings is unclear. We
compared the performance of serological kits based on antigens from different HEV genotypes.
Methods: Taking 20 serum samples from patients in southwest France with acute HEV infection (positive PCR for HEV
genotype 3) and 550 anonymised samples from blood donors in southwest Switzerland, we tested for anti-HEV IgG using
three enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (MP Diagnostics, Dia.Pro and Fortress) based on genotype 1 and 2 antigens, and one
immunodot assay (Mikrogen Diagnostik recomLine HEV IgG/IgM) based on genotype 1 and 3 antigens.
Results: All acute HEV samples and 124/550 blood donor samples were positive with $1 assay. Of PCR-confirmed patient
samples, 45%, 65%, 95% and 55% were positive with MP Diagnostics, Dia.Pro, Fortress and recomLine, respectively. Of blood
donor samples positive with $1 assay, 120/124 (97%), were positive with Fortress, 19/124 (15%) were positive with all EIAs
and 51/124 (41%) were positive with recomLine. Of 11/20 patient samples positive with recomLine, stronger reactivity for
HEV genotype 3 was observed in 1/11(9%), and equal reactivity for both genotypes in 5/11 (45.5%).
Conclusions: Although recomLine contains HEV genotype 3, it has lower sensitivity than Fortress in acute HEV infection and
fails to identify infection as being due to this genotype in approximately 45% of patients. In our single blood donor
population, we observe wide variations in measured seroprevalence, from 4.2% to 21.8%, depending on the assay used.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus acquired
predominantly through faeco-oral transmission. Initially identified
as a virus endemic in low-income regions, causing waterborne
outbreaks of hepatitis, HEV is now recognised as the agent of a
zoonotic infection, causing indigenous disease in industrialised
countries [1].
Of the four HEV genotypes linked to human infection,
outbreaks are generally caused by genotype 1 or 2, whilst genotype
3 is associated with autochthonous infection in humans, pigs and
other mammals [2,3,4]. The clinical spectrum of acute hepatitis E
in humans is broad, with asymptomatic infection in many cases
[5].
Diagnosing HEV infection requires an understanding of the
different phases of disease. In acute infection, HEV viraemia, as
detected using PCR, is short-lived. Anti-HEV IgM and IgG are
detectable at symptom onset, if symptoms occur. Thereafter, IgM
titres fall over a period of weeks to months whilst IgG titres remain
detectable for a period of one to several years [6,7]. Most
commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) use antigens derived
from HEV genotypes 1 and 2 [8]. The assays are based on
proteins derived from two of the three open reading frames
(ORFs) contained in the HEV genome, ORF2 and ORF3. ORF2
encodes the capsid protein and ORF3 a cytoskeleton-associated

multifunctional protein. Assay sensitivity varies between different
kits, for several reasons: assays for HEV antibodies based on
recombinant proteins have been found to be more sensitive than
those based on synthetic peptides [9]; antigenic properties of the
epitopes, especially those of ORF2, are strongly conformationdependent; and HEV sequence heterogeneity implies that
antibody epitopes may not be conserved across strains. Differing
assay sensitivities may partly explain the wide seroprevalence
range reported in industrialised countries, from 0.2% to 52.5%
[10,11,12]. Furthermore, the observation that certain serological
tests have higher sensitivity for genotype 1 than for genotype 3 [2]
suggests that anti-HEV IgG screening in industrialised countries,
where indigenous infection is with genotype 3, is potentially
hampered.
Given the recent introduction of diagnostic tests based on HEV
genotypes 1 and 3, we compared the performance of an
immunodot assay based on these two genotypes to that of three
commercial EIAs based on genotypes 1 and 2 in two distinct
populations from regions where HEV genotype 3 is the agent of
autochthonous infection: 1) patients in southwest France in whom
acute HEV infection due to genotype 3 had been diagnosed by
real-time PCR and 2) asymptomatic blood donors (of unknown
HEV status) in southwest Switzerland. The aims of this study were
1) to examine whether an assay based on genotype 3 would have
superior sensitivity in a population of known HEV infection status
and 2) to examine the range of seroprevalence measurements
obtained by applying different assays to a single population.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Use of serum samples obtained from Toulouse, France, was part
of a non-interventional study with no addition to the usual
procedures. Biological material and clinical data were obtained
only for standard viral diagnosis following physicians’ orders (no
specific sampling, no modification of the sampling protocol, no
supplementary question to the national standardised questionnaire). Data analyses were carried out using an anonymised
database. According to the French Law of Public Health (CSP Art
L 1121–1.1), such protocol is exempt from written informed
consent.
Use of blood donor samples from Lausanne, Switzerland, was
approved by the Ethical Committee of the Canton of Vaud,
Switzerland. All donors provided written consent to the use of
blood samples in medical research.
Sample Populations
Serum samples from patients living in the region of Toulouse,
southwest France, with proven acute HEV infection, diagnosed on
the basis of positive HEV RNA with concomitant clinical and
biochemical evidence of acute hepatitis, were collected at the time
of symptom onset (acute infection), or up to fourteen months after
the acute phase (post-acute infection), and stored at 280uC. All
HEV infections in these patients were identified as being due to
HEV genotype 3, following real-time PCR based on ORF3 and
ORF2 as previously described [13].
Samples from blood donors were collected consecutively and
anonymously from 550 healthy blood donors living in the region of
Lausanne, southwest Switzerland, in November 2009 as described
previously [11]. Blood samples were stored at 280uC between the
seroprevalence study performed in 2009 [11] and the present
study. For analysis (see below), frozen samples were thawed in
batches.
Anti-HEV IgG EIAs
All samples were screened for anti-HEV IgG using three
commercially available indirect EIAs: MP Diagnostics ELISA (MP
Biomedicals SAS, Illkirch, France), Dia.Pro HEV IgG EIA
(Dia.Pro Diagnostic Bioprobes Srl, Milan, Italy) and Fortress
Diagnostics HEV-IgG EIA (Fortress Diagnostics Ltd, Antrim,
UK). The MP Diagnostics (formerly Genelabs Diagnostics,
Singapore) kit is an indirect EIA using three recombinant fusion
proteins: one containing a 42-amino acid sequence from the
ORF2 of the Mexican strain (genotype 2), one containing a 33-
amino acid sequence from the ORF3 of the same Mexican strain,
and one containing the homologous ORF3 sequence from the
Burmese strain (genotype 1) [14,15]. According to the manufacturer, sensitivity and specificity using this kit are 97% and 98%,
respectively. The Dia.Pro kit is sold in France under the name
Adaltis by InGen (InGen France, personal communication). The
assay uses four synthetic peptides representing epitopes from
ORF2 and ORF3 from the Burmese and Mexican HEV strains.
These peptides have the same C-terminal amino acid as the
recombinant sequences present in the MP Diagnostics test but
differ at the N terminus, being shorter by 10 residues (ORF3) and
longer by 46 residues (ORF2). According to the manufacturer,
sensitivity and specificity reach 100%. The Fortress Diagnostics kit
is identical to that produced by Wantai (Beijing Wantai Biological
Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd, China) [16] and uses one long
recombinant protein (PE2) containing 211 amino acids of the
ORF2 of a Chinese strain belonging to genotype 1. This protein
forms homodimers and polymers that have greatly enhanced
antigenicity compared to the monomeric form [16,17,18].
Specificity and sensitivity are not indicated by the manufacturer.
The three EIAs were each performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. In our analyses, any sample with an initial
optical density (OD)/cut off ratio of $0.9 was retested in duplicate
and was considered positive if the OD/cut off ratio of both
replicates was $1.0.
Anti-HEV IgG Immunodot Assay
Samples testing positive with at least one EIA underwent further
testing using a line immunodot assay, Mikrogen Diagnostik
recomLine HEV IgG/IgM (Mikrogen GmbH, Neuried, Germany).
This assay uses four recombinant proteins applied separately to a
nitrocellulose strip: O2 N, O2 M and O2C, which represent
approximately the N-terminal, middle and C-terminal third of the
ORF2 protein, respectively, and O3, which consists of the fulllength ORF3 protein. Each O2 N, O2C and O3 are present as
two bands, one with a genotype 1 sequence, the other with a
genotype 3 sequence; for O2 M, only a genotype 1 sequence is
provided. After sequential incubation with each sample, an antiIgG conjugate and a chromogenic substrate, the nitrocellulose
strips are scanned using a Plustek OpticPro S28 apparatus and the
results are evaluated using the recomScan program of Mikrogen
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each
individual HEV band on the strip is rated where the sensitivity
cut off is defined by the intensity of a control band. Any HEV
band undetectable (-), or with an intensity weaker than that of the
control band (6), is rated negative. Any HEV band with an
intensity equal to (+) or stronger than (++, +++) the control band
intensity is rated positive. If the intensity of two homologous bands
(one from genotype 1 and one from genotype 3) differ, only the
stronger band is rated. Second, the whole strip is rated, where each
positive HEV band, whatever its intensity (+,++or +++), is
attributed a number of points according to the protein identity
(O2 N: 2 points, O2C: 4 points, O2 M: 2 points, O3:3 points).
The sum of the points for the four non-homologous bands (the

brighter one of the two genotypes) of each strip is then calculated.
The final result may be negative (sum #2), borderline (sum = 3), or
positive (sum $4). According to the manufacturer, sensitivity is
100% and specificity is 98.8%. This assay differs from a previously
described immunoblot assay called RecomBlot [2], also produced
by Mikrogen, which is based on HEV genotypes 1 and 2.
For the 20 serum samples from patients with HEV RNA-proven
HEV infection, we calculated sensitivity as the percentage of
samples testing positive with each test. For the 550 blood donor
samples, we examined the percentage of samples testing positive
with each test and expressed this as the ‘measured seroprevalence’
for the given assay.
Data Analysis
Data are expressed as percentages to denote sensitivity and
seroprevalence, according to the sample population described.
Correlation was measured by calculating Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient. All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2008 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).
Results
Study Population
The patient population comprised 15 patients (12 men, three
women) presenting with clinical and biochemical features of acute
HEV infection, and five patients (three men, two women) with
post-acute infection, presenting 4–14 months after the acute phase.
Median patient age was 50.5 years (interquartile range 43–60
years). Measured ALT values were available in 7/15 patients with
acute HEV (mean 16316843 IU/L) and in 2/5 patients with
post-acute infection (mean 53612 IU/L). The blood donor
population comprised 332 men and 218 women, median age 55
years (interquartile range 46–63 years); 99.3% had normal ALT
values. In this group, none was positive for HIV or hepatitis B
surface antigen; one individual had antibodies to hepatitis C virus
(HCV) but was HCV RNA negative.
Of the patient samples from the acute phase of HEV infection,
8/15 (53%) were positive with MP Diagnostics, 12/15 (80%) were
positive with Dia.Pro, 14/15 (93%) were positive with Fortress,
and 6/15 (40%) were positive with recomLine (Table 1). Of the
post-acute samples, 1/5 (20%) were positive with MP Diagnostics
and Dia.Pro, and 5/5 (100%) were positive with Fortress and
recomLine. Of the six acute samples positive with recomLine, five
showed stronger reactivity for genotype 1 than for genotype 3, and
one showed equal reactivity for both genotypes; of the five postacute samples, four had equal reactivity for both genotypes and
one showed greater reactivity for genotype 3 (Table 1). Examining
test performances with all patient sera, we observed a correlation
between the strength of reaction with all three EIAs and the score
with the recomLine test (r = 0.63 for Dia.Pro, P = 0.007 to r = 0.8
with MP Diagnostics, P = 0.001).
Of 550 blood donor samples, 124/550 (22.5%) tested positive
with at least one EIA kit: 27/550 (4.9%) were positive with MP
Diagnostics, 23/550 (4.2%) were positive with Dia.Pro, and 120/
550 (21.8%) were positive with Fortress. Of these positive samples,
51/124 (41%) were positive, 67/124 (54%) were negative, and 6/
124 (4.8%) were borderline with the recomLine kit (Table 2).
The Dia.Pro and the MP Diagnostics kits had concordant
results for 540/550 (98.2%) samples, 20 (3.6%) being positive and
520 (94.5%) being negative with both tests. Of the 20 double
positive samples, 16 were also positive with the recomLine test. The
Fortress test yielded the highest proportion of positive results 120/
550 (21.8%). However, fewer than half of these (51/550, 9.3%)
tested positive with the recomLine test. Of the 430 samples testing
negative with the Fortress kit, three tested positive with the MP
Diagnostics kit and one tested positive with both MP diagnostics
and Dia.Pro kits. Of these four samples, none yielded a positive
result with the recomLine test.
Of the samples positive with $1 EIA and with recomLine, the
majority (44/51, 86%) scored 4 points (intensity greater than the
control band for O2C only), with the remainder (7/51, 14%)
scoring 7 points (intensity greater than the control band for
proteins O2C and O3); all recomLine-positive samples were either
undetectable or with an intensity weaker than that of the control
band for proteins O2 M and O2 N. Considering HEV genotypes
in positive recomLine samples, the intensities of the homologous
bands were equal for both genotypes (genotypes 1 and 3) in 25/51
samples (49%) and stronger for genotype 3 in 26/51 samples
(51%).
Examining all the donor samples, we observed a correlation
between the Fortress test reaction strength and the recomLine score
(r = 0.74, P = 0.0001) (Figure 1). However, for the Dia.Pro
(r = 0.479, P = 0.05) and the MP Diagnostics tests (r = 0.345,
P = 0.12), this correlation was less strong.
Discussion
We have examined the performance of three EIAs and one
immunodot assay in two distinct populations: a patient population
with acute/post-acute HEV infection and an asymptomatic blood
donor population. In the patient population, we were able to
determine assay sensitivity as all samples came from individuals
with PCR-proven HEV infection. We found the Fortress EIA to
have the highest sensitivity: 95% in all patients and 100% in the
post-acute phase subgroup (five patients). The recomLine immunodot, despite being based on HEV genotypes 1 and 3, and despite
being applied to samples with proven genotype 3 infection, had an
overall sensitivity of 55%. Although this improved to 100% in the
post-acute subgroup, identification of infection as being due
specifically to genotype 3 was achieved in a single patient. In the
blood donor population, in whom HEV status was unknown, we
observed marked differences in measured HEV seroprevalence,
from 4.2% to 21.8%, depending on the assay used.
Commercial assays for detecting anti-HEV IgG are required in
two main settings: 1) as a diagnostic test and 2) to measure HEV
seroprevalence in a given population. Compared to assays for antiHEV IgM, with which non-specific reactions are described [6],
non-specific reactivity with anti-HEV IgG is encountered less
frequently. As such, different EIA results are more likely to occur
from differences in sensitivity than specificity. Several explanations
exist for the differing kit performances we observe. The kits we
used are not based on the same antigen length and use different
genetic sequences, expressed in different systems: the MP
Diagnostics and Fortress kits use recombinant proteins while the
Dia.Pro kit is based on synthetic peptides. Second, the presence of
conformational epitopes in the long ORF2 sequence provided in
the Fortress kit is likely to play a major role; given that all the
recomLine-positive samples were O2C-reactive, it is possible that
the O2C band recognises epitopes which are present on PE2
(Fortress) but not on the short peptides of the other two EIAs.
Taking the Fortress and recomLine figures, as both these tests
had high sensitivity in the post-acute subgroup of patients, there
are two possibilities to explain the differences in measured
seroprevalence values: 1) that recomLine has too low a sensitivity
to detect antibodies at low titres; 2) that Fortress lacks specificity in
this non-epidemic population. Given that HEV infection is often
asymptomatic, it is difficult to prove that a negative screening test
means absence of previous infection. The best argument that

Fortress does not lack specificity comes from seroprevalence data
in southwest France among 188 children 2 to 4 years old (3.7%)
against a figure of 52.5% in adults in the same region [12]. The
low sensitivity of the recomLine assay as compared to Fortress can
also be seen in the patients with acute infection, when IgG
antibodies are still rising in concentration and, perhaps more
importantly, are still of low avidity.
Considering the recomLine immunodot as a screening test, this
assay uses the specific antigen ORF3 [2] and three ORF2
antigens, of which only one (O2C) is sufficient to give a positive
result on its own. Of the six blood donor samples with reactivity by
recomLine limited to O3, and so borderline, five were weakly
reactive with Fortress. These samples might be false positives with
Fortress or true positives due to higher antigenicity of PE2 over

O2C. However, given the correlation we observe between reaction
strength (OD/cut off ratio) of the Fortress assay and the recomLine
score, further studies are needed to investigate whether anti-O3-
alone may be indicative of past infection.
The low sensitivities we observe for the MP Diagnostics and
Dia.Pro kits are surprising, given the manufacturers’ own figures.
However, our observations are in keeping with those of Bendall
and co-workers who observed that the MP Diagnostics kit,
commercialised under the name of Genelabs HEV IgG EIA
(Genelabs, Inc., Singapore), was more sensitive early in HEV
infection than after the acute phase [16]; in a sample population
fulfilling criteria for blood donation, any individuals positive for
anti-HEV IgG are likely to be in the non-acute phase. When
screening individuals in the non-outbreak or low prevalence
context, an assay of high sensitivity is required and we propose that
the Fortress EIA fits this profile. The exception is chronic hepatitis
E in immunocompromised individuals in whom anti-HEV IgG
may be negative and in whom the diagnosis should be made by
PCR for HEV RNA [19,20].
This study has limitations. The main limitation is that, while we
were able to measure assay sensitivity in the patient population,
taking PCR as a gold standard test for HEV infection, we have no
gold standard test to apply to the population of blood donors. By
definition, asymptomatic blood donors have no symptoms of acute
or recent HEV infection and so, even if they have been infected
with HEV, they are beyond the window of PCR-demonstrable
viraemia. In the patient population, the samples in which to
determine each assay’s potential for measuring seroprevalence
were those from the patients with post-acute infection. However,
these samples were few in number: five patients of 20 with PCRproven infection. To address the question of sensitivity in
measuring seroprevalence, we would need to take PCR-proven
cases and follow them longitudinally to examine the performance
of different assays at different time points. This would still leave the
problem of determining specificity: as HEV infection may be
subclinical, it is not possible to identify truly negative individuals
who could serve as controls. Second, with respect to our
seroprevalence figures, the mean age of our blood donor
population was 55 years old, as donors were recruited from
centres other than university campuses and the military, as
previously described [11]; as HEV prevalence has been observed
to increase with age [11,21], the findings in our population may
overestimate HEV seroprevalence in Switzerland as a whole.
Against this, the aim of this study was to examine the benefit of
using an anti-HEV IgG assay based on HEV genotype 3 antigens
in populations in which this genotype is the cause of indigenous
infection, rather than specifically to measure seroprevalence.
In summary, we have observed highly variable performances in
both the acute setting and in the measurement of seroprevalence
between currently available commercial tests detecting anti-HEV
IgG. Our results suggest that epidemiological studies not using
identical screening assays should not be compared as observed
differences between populations may be explained by differences
in assay sensitivity as well as by true differences in seroprevalence.
Finally, our data show no benefit in using a screening assay based
on HEV genotype 3 antigens, either in demonstrating infection or
in identifying the responsible genotype, even in populations from
industrialised regions.

Figure 1. Correlation between strength of reaction and recomLine score. RecomLine immunodot score and optical density (OD)/cut
off ratio for samples positive only with the Fortress kit and those
positive with all three EIAs. The shaded zone demarcates samples which
were positive both with Fortress (according to our study protocol,
where an OD/cut off ratio $1.0 is considered positive) and with
recomLine.
