Abstract
Introduction Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used medication in pregnancy and is considered safe. Unfortunately,
APAP is also among the most commonly reported agents
implicated in overdoses during pregnancy. We present a
unique case of a pregnant patient with fulminant hepatic
failure resulting in a liver transplant from repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP.
Case Report A 22 year pregnant female presented with
abdominal pain and hepatotoxicity after taking supratherapeutic amounts of APAP to treat dental pain. The patient
denied intentional or acute ingestion of APAP but did admit
to taking approximately 8-9 grams of APAP per day for
10-14 days for dental pain. Other cause of hepatotoxicity,
including acute fatty liver of pregnancy, were evaluated for
and ruled out. She developed fulminant hepatic failure and
required liver transplantation which was successful. The
pregnancy remained viable through the operation but intrauterine fetal demise occurred 2 weeks later. An MRI of the
fetus showed extensive peri-cerebral and intraventricular
hemorrhage with extensive periventricular leukomalacia.
Discussion The degree of morbidity from repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP seen in this case is rare and
poorly described in a pregnant patient. There are no prior
reports describing the need for liver transplant after repeated
supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP during pregnancy.
Along with the typical cause of hepatotoxicy several unique
pregnancy-related causes also had to be evaluated for. This
case highlights the significant morbidity that can occur with
even unintentional APAP toxicity and the need to educate
patients, especially pregnant patients, of the risk of excessive APAP use.

Introduction
Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most widely used
medications in pregnancy and is generally considered safe
[1]. Unfortunately, APAP is also among the most commonly
reported agents implicated in overdoses during pregnancy
[2]. We present a unique case of a pregnant patient with
fulminant hepatic failure resulting in a liver transplant from
repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP.
Case Report
A 22-year-old G2P1A0 female with no past medical history
presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. She also complained of dental pain for several
weeks and endorsed using APAP 500 mg and Tylenol #3
(APAP 300 mg with codeine 30 mg) tablets for it. Other
than a prenatal vitamin, she denied taking any other prescription, herbal or OTC medications. Vital signs were:
heart rate of 104 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of
122/60 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 26 with a SaO2 of 100%
and a temperature of 35.4°C. An estimated gestational age
(EGA) by last menstrual period was 19 weeks and 5 days.
The physical exam was notable for tenderness in the right
upper quadrant, tachypnea and scleral icterus. Her uterus
was nontender with a fundal height consistent with dates.

The remainder of her exam including mental status was
normal. Initial pertinent laboratory values are shown in
Table 1. Review of her medical record showed she had been
evaluated 5 days earlier for chest pain. Laboratory results
from this visit are listed in Table 1. The patient was further
questioned about her APAP use and admitted to taking
approximately 12 APAP 500 mg tablets and six to eight
tablets of Tylenol #3 per day for the last ten to 14 days. She
states she did so because she was told she could not take any
other pain medications due to her being pregnant. She and
her family adamantly denied suicidality or intentional ingestion. Resuscitation with intravenous (IV) fluids, dextrose
and sodium bicarbonate was started. IV phytonadione was
given and IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was started according
to package insert dosing recommendations. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with presumed hepatotoxicity
from unintentional chronic APAP overdose. In the ICU, a
pelvic ultrasound showed a single intrauterine pregnancy
dated at 20 weeks and 2 days weighing 423 g with fetal
heart motion (FHM) of 126 bpm. An abdominal ultrasound
was interpreted as normal. Despite resuscitation, her metabolic acidosis persisted, liver function continued to deteriorate and she became somnolent. She was then transferred to
a tertiary care hospital for possible liver transplant approximately 24 h after admission. There, an extensive evaluation
for other liver failure etiologies was undertaken. Serum iron
levels, Hepatitis A IgM/IgG, Hepatitis B serologies, HBV
DNA, HCV PCR, CMV PCR, EBV PCR, HSV PCR, HIV
PCR, ceruloplasmin, ANA and F-actin IgG were all unremarkable. Her repeat labs are shown in Table 1. Though the
patient's clinical condition continued to decline with worsening coagulopathy, jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy,
the patient and her family expressed a desire that all measures be taken to preserve fetal viability. Approximately 48 h
from her presentation, she was intubated for airway protection due to declining mental status. A CT of her head prior to
intubation was interpreted as normal. She was listed for liver
transplant with a MELD score of 27. She had stage IV
hepatic encephalopathy but did not meet any other King's
College Critera. Seventy-two hours from her initial presentation, she underwent successful orthotopic liver transplant.
Intraoperative ultrasound at the end of the case documented
FHM. The pathology result on her native liver was consistent with fulminant liver failure due to APAP toxicity. On
the evening of postop day 0, she developed an anastomotic
bleed which was successfully repaired. She subsequently
did well and was extubated on postop day 3. Laboratory
results immediately before and 30 h after her transplant are
detailed in Table 1. She was started on tacrolimus, but not
mycophenolate, due to concerns for teratogenicity. On
postop day 4, a pelvic ultrasound demonstrated FHM of
124 bmp with appropriate interval fetal growth. However,
fluid was noted within the fetal peritoneal cavity consistent
with hydrops. A pelvic ultrasound done on postop day 13
showed FHM of 132 with resolving fetal intraperitoneal
fluid but was concerning for bilateral ventriculomegaly. A

repeat pelvic ultrasound on postop day 16 showed progressive
ventriculomegaly and irreversible brain damage. On postop
day 17, the patient underwent an induction termination of
pregnancy with misoprostol for intrauterine fetal demise. No
fetal autopsy was performed but a MRI of the fetal brain
demonstrated extensive pericerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage with extensive periventricular leukomalacia.
Discussion
APAP is the most common drug implicated in overdoses
during pregnancy [2]. The vast majority of the reported
cases of APAP toxicity during pregnancy involve single,
large acute ingestions and the reported outcomes are usually
favorable if NAC therapy is initiated in a timely fashion [3].
However, with delays in treatment, fetal demise and maternal death have been reported [4]. In contrast, our case
demonstrates the potential for severe morbidity with repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP. Compared to acute,
intentional APAP poisoning, unintentional APAP poisoning
in pregnancy is poorly described. Horowitz et al. comment
on the normal recovery of two women who ingested “repetitive, supratherapeutic (>4 g/day) doses” of APAP [5].
Haibach et al. reported on a 24-year-old at 27–28 weeks
EGA who ingested 29 g of APAP over less than 24 h
resulting in hepatotoxicity, fetal demise and eventual maternal recovery with NAC therapy [6]. Stokes et al. reported on
a 17-year-old at 21 weeks EGA who ingested 25 g of paracetamol in two doses of 10 and 15 g, 18 and 8 h before
admission who developed hepatotoxicity but recovered with
NAC therapy to have a normal pregnancy [7]. Kurzel et al.
attributed maternal hepatotoxicity and neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage to chronic APAP ingestion but were unable
to confirm the amount of APAP ingested and coingestants
complicated the case [8]. None of these previous cases
demonstrated the severe morbidity seen with our case. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP during pregnancy resulting
in liver transplantation.
While the risk to the mother from APAP poisoning is
paramount, there is concern that because APAP crosses the
placenta and fetal livers demonstrate mixed-function oxidase
activity by 14 weeks gestational age, fetal liver damage may
occur [5, 9]. We were unable to document this in our case.
Fortunately, NAC appears to readily cross the placenta [5].
While APAP was considered to be the most likely cause
of hepatotoxicity and liver failure in this case, other causes
were evaluated for. Viral, autoimmune and metabolic etiologies (i.e., Wilson's disease) were ruled out with laboratory
testing. Unusual toxicological causes of liver failure such as
pennyroyal or comfrey were considered but patient denied
any herbal or OTC medications. Unique pregnancy-related
causes of liver failure such as pre-eclampsia/eclampsia,
HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy
(AFLP) were strongly considered. They were ruled out by
history, exam and imaging studies. Concern was highest for
AFLP which is a microvesicular steatotosis caused by a
defect in mitochondrial β-oxidation leading to hepatotoxicity and liver failure usually in the third trimester [10]. The
final pathology report proved to be inconsistent with AFLP.
Conclusion
This case of repeated supratherapeutic ingestions of APAP
during pregnancy resulted in fulminant liver failure, liver
transplantation and fetal demise. It highlights the significant
morbidity that can occur with unintentional excessive ingestions of APAP and emphasizes the importance of educating
both physicians and pregnant patients of the potential danger supratherapeutic APAP use poses to both the mother and
the fetus.
