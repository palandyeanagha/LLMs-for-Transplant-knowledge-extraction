Abstract Acetaminophen (paracetamol) plays a vital role in American health care,
with in excess of 25 billion doses being used annually as a nonprescription
medication. Over 200 million acetaminophen-containing prescriptions, usually in combination with an opioid, are dispensed annually. While acetaminophen is recognized as a safe and effective analgesic and antipyretic, it is
also associated with significant morbidity and mortality (hepatotoxicity) if
doses in excess of the therapeutic amount are ingested inappropriately. The
maximum daily therapeutic dose of 3900–4000 mg was established in separate
actions in 1977 and 1988, respectively, via the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) monograph process for nonprescription medications. The FDA has
conducted multiple advisory committee meetings to evaluate acetaminophen
and its safety profile, and has suggested (but not mandated) a reduction in
the maximum daily dosage from 3900–4000 mg to 3000–3250 mg. In 2011,
McNeil, the producer of the Tylenol brand of acetaminophen, voluntarily
reduced the maximum daily dose of its 500 mg tablet product to 3000 mg/day,
and it has pledged to change the labeling of its 325 mg/tablet product to reflect
a maximum of 3250 mg/day. Generic manufacturers have not changed their
dosing regimens and they have remained consistent with the established
monograph dose. Therefore, confusion will be inevitable as both consumers
and health care professionals try to determine the proper therapeutic dose of
acetaminophen. Which is the correct dose of acetaminophen: 3000 mg if
500 mg tablets are used, 3250 mg with 325 mg tablets, or 3900 mg when
650 mg arthritis-strength products are used?
In 1960, acetaminophen (paracetamol) was
introduced in the United States as a nonprescription analgesic and antipyretic.[1] It now plays a
vital role in American health care, with in excess of 25 billion doses being used annually as a
nonprescription medication.[2] Additionally, over
200 million acetaminophen-containing prescriptions,
usually in combination with an opioid, are dispensed annually.[2] Most nonprescription acetaminophen-containing products are regulated by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug
monograph process.
Under the monograph regulatory process,
once a pharmaceutical is recognized as being safe
and effective for the general public to use without the need to seek treatment by a health care
professional, a monograph is established. To market the product, a manufacturer merely needs to

comply with the conditions of the monograph,
which include parameters such as indications and
dosage; no additional pre-market approval is
necessary. Acetaminophen is a classic example of
a pharmaceutical that is subject to the nonprescription drug monograph process as found in the
‘Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic
Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human
Use’ monograph.[3] The monograph specifies that
single-ingredient acetaminophen-containing products that contain 325 mg should be administered
in a dose of 325–650 mg every 4 hours while symptoms persist, not to exceed 3900 mg in 24 hours
for not more than 10 days (approved July 8,
1977). Products that contain 500 mg should follow
the dosing regimen of adult doses up to 1000 mg,
not to exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours (approved
November 16, 1988). The 650 mg sustained-release
products are governed not by the monograph
process but instead by the FDA New Drug Application (NDA) process.[1] All prescription products that contain acetaminophen must receive
FDA approval via the NDA process and, unlike
the monograph process, no dosing modifications
may occur without prior FDA approval.
While the monograph process dictates acetaminophen dosing, acetaminophen has come under
significant FDA scrutiny, and the FDA has become increasingly vigilant with regard to the use
of this medication, because of the occurrence of
hepatotoxicity when acetaminophen is not used
properly. Hepatotoxicity has been recognized as
being associated with inappropriate use of acetaminophen for over six decades.[4] Acetaminophen
has been cited as the leading cause of drug-induced
acute liver failure in the United States.[5-7] An estimated 78 414 emergency department visits for the
treatment of acetaminophen overdose occur annually.[8] Over the last two decades, the FDA has
held four advisory committee meetings to address
the toxicity-related issues associated with acetaminophen. The most recent advisory committee
meeting, which dealt with the issue of adult acetaminophen overdose, was conducted in 2009 and
formed the basis for current decisions that are
being made by the FDA and industry about how to
dose acetaminophen in both nonprescription and
prescription products.[9]
To address the issues surrounding acetaminophen toxicity, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) prepared an internal
report that formed the basis for discussion at the
2009 advisory committee meeting. The committee members were asked to vote upon several
recommendations, which included reducing the
total daily acetaminophen dose from 4000 mg to
3250 mg, limiting tablet strength to 325 mg/tablet,
and switching the 500 mg strength to prescription
status.[9] The advisory committee was generally
sympathetic to these interventions as ways to
reduce acetaminophen toxicity.[9] As with all advisory committees, the committee was purely ‘advisory’ to the FDA, and its recommendations
were not binding to the FDA. However, the
recommendations of the CDER group and the
advisory committee and subsequent actions by
the FDA and voluntary actions by industry have
created significant confusion about the therapeutic or ‘proper’ dose of acetaminophen.
What is the maximum safe daily dose of acetaminophen? In reality, the FDA has never validated the threshold toxic dose for the average
adult. The 3900 mg maximum daily dose, as recommended originally, was deemed to be safe and is
five to seven times lower than the estimated median lethal dose (LD50) of 400 mg/kg. The 1977
panel used anecdotal reports suggesting that 15 g
was the hepatotoxic dose; therefore, a dose of
650 mg was 23 times less than the hepatotoxic dose.
Subsequently, the analgesic monograph dictated
that 3900–4000 mg was a safe and effective maximum daily dose if acetaminophen was used properly and according to the approved labeling.
History has demonstrated the safety of this dose.
In 1994, Whitcomb and Block published the
results of their retrospective case series review
of 126 779 hospital discharge summaries from
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to
identify those patients who were taking acetaminophen and who developed severe hepatotoxicity.[10]
Forty-nine patients with severe acetaminopheninduced hepatotoxicity (defined as an aspartate
aminotransaminase level >1000 U/L) were identified: 28 patients had an intentional acetaminophen
overdose, and 21 were taking acetaminophen for
therapeutic reasons. All of these patients had taken
46 Krenzelok & Royal

more than the recommended daily maximum
dose of 4000 mg. No hepatotoxicity was identified in patients who had therapeutic doses of
acetaminophen or less than 4000 mg/day. A prospective study by den Hertog and colleagues
evaluated the use of acetaminophen in 697 stroke
patients who received a dose of 6000 mg daily for
3 days. None of the patients had liver enzyme
changes.[11] Temple and colleagues studied osteoarthritis in patients who received acetaminophen
4000 mg daily for 6–12 months, and none of the
patients experienced liver function tests that exceeded two times the upper limit of the normal
range.[12] These studies and a multitude of others
support the fact that 4000 mg is a safe maximum
daily dose.
The FDA CDER recommendation to reduce
the maximum daily dose to 3250 mg was therefore
not evidence based but merely a hypothetical intervention to reduce the potential of an overdose
occurring if a patient was not using acetaminophen properly or if, unknowingly, a patient was
using multiple acetaminophen-containing products. In other words, the expressed concern was
not with therapeutic dosing (£4000 mg/24 hours)
but with excessive dosing when two or more
products containing acetaminophen are taken inadvertently, and the potential for hepatotoxicity
with chronic use at excessive doses.
Consequently, a unilateral decision on July 28,
2011, was made by McNeil, the manufacturer of
the Tylenol brand of acetaminophen, to modify
the current label and dosage regimen (which is
permitted under the monograph process) of its
500 mg/tablet product, for patients who are not
under the care of a health care professional, to
six doses (3000 mg) daily. This decision was not
mandated by the FDA, and generic acetaminophen
manufacturers did not follow suit. Ironically, the
recommended doses of the Tylenol brand 325 mg
tablets and 650 mg sustained-release products
remain the same. For both products, McNeil’s
recommendations continue to allow a maximum
daily dose of 3900 mg. While McNeil has announced plans to modify the doses of the 325 mg
strength in 2012, it is not obligated to do so, and
its unilateral action does not obligate any other
manufacturers to modify their dosing regimens,
as is consistent with the monograph process.
However, this decision has the potential to be
misinterpreted by many as an FDA mandate that
was implemented for safety reasons.
Confusion in the metric-system–challenged
American society is likely to occur. Even among
health care professionals, acetaminophen-dosing–
related confusion is a distinct possibility. For example, if hospitals change their dosage guidelines
and apply the new McNeil-initiated 500 mg recommendations (a maximum of 3000 mg daily)
designed for outpatients not under health care
practitioner supervision to all acetaminophen
products (inappropriately) in the controlled hospital environment, there may be negative patient
care ramifications. Conceivably, a physician could
prescribe inadequate dose regimens of the intravenous form of acetaminophen, assuming incorrectly that the McNeil announcement applies
to all routes of acetaminophen administration
instead of the FDA monograph-approved 1000 mg
single dose and 4000 mg daily maximum, and
thereby compromise analgesic or antipyretic therapy.[13] Given the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen (an elimination half-life of 2–3 hours),
lengthening the dosing interval (e.g. 1000 mg
every 8 hours to stay within the maximum daily
dose as recommended in the McNeil guideline)
may cause individuals with pain or fever to be
subject to therapeutic failure in the latter part of
their dosing regimen. Another potential source of
confusion exists if a health care provider, such as
a pharmacist, nurse or physician, understands
that the McNeil changes are voluntary and recommends the traditional monograph-approved
dosing regimen of up to 4000 mg daily, thus creating confusion among uninformed health care
providers and the general public as to what is a
therapeutic and safe dose of acetaminophen.
To paraphrase Paracelsus, ‘‘the dose differentiates a remedy from a poison’’ and the 4000 mg
dose has been established as both safe and effective. Does the new lower dosing, as recommended
by the industry leader, suggest that doses in
excess of 3000 mg are no longer safe? If more than
3000 mg is administered in a 24-hour period, will
a hospital be obliged to complete a medication
safety error report? Will consumers contact poiConfusion: The Acetaminophen Dosing Dilemma in Adults 47

son centers or their health care providers when they
determine that they have exceeded the ‘new’
3000 mg maximum daily dose, leading to even more
confusion when they are informed that only daily
doses that exceed 4000 mg in adults are considered
excessive? Complicating the dilemma will be the
inevitability that patients will receive conflicting
advice when they speak to multiple caregivers.
The voluntary decision to reduce the maximum
daily dose of acetaminophen may exert undue
pressure on the generic acetaminophen manufacturers to adjust their dosing recommendations
accordingly, despite the fact that there is no evidence basis for changing the traditional dosing
regimen. Ultimately, this may result in inadequate pain relief and confusion, and may not
produce the anticipated reduction in the number
of acetaminophen-related emergency department
visits and the associated morbidity and mortality.
The fact remains that nearly 70% of acetaminophen-related emergency department visits result
from self-directed violence such as suicide attempts;[7] a change in dosing strategies is unlikely
to have an impact on self-harm incidents. Furthermore, considering the astronomical figure
that over 25 billion doses of acetaminophen are
used annually by the American public, the toxicity
signal related to acetaminophen is extraordinarily
low and is further evidence that the traditional
dosing regimen of acetaminophen is safe. Which is
the correct dose of acetaminophen: 3000 mg if
500 mg tablets are used, 3250 mg with 325 mg tablets, or 3900 mg when 650 mg arthritis-strength
products are used? The pessimistic viewpoint is
that the likely consequence of changing from the
traditional daily maximum acetaminophen dose of
4000 mg will be an onslaught of confused patients
and fellow health care professionals!
