Abstract Our objective was to assess how the diagnosis and
treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) have changed
over time. We used data from 891 patients in the MPS I
Registry, an international observational database, to analyze
ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, treatment initiation, and
treatment allocation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase, both, or neither)
over time for all disease phenotypes (Hurler, Hurler–Scheie,
and Scheie syndromes). The interval between diagnosis and
treatment has become shorter since laronidase became available in 2003 (gap during 2006–2009: Hurler—0.2 year,
Hurler–Scheie—0.5 year, Scheie—1.4 years). However, the
age at diagnosis has not decreased for any MPS I phenotype
over time, and the interval between symptom onset and treatment initiation remains substantial for both Hurler–Scheie and
Scheie patients (gap during 2006–2009, 2.42 and 6.71 years,
respectively). Among transplanted patients, an increasing proportion received hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood (34
out of 64 patients by 2009) and was also treated with
laronidase (42 out of 45 patients by 2009). Conclusions:
Despite the availability of laronidase since 2003, the diagnosis
of MPS I is still substantially delayed for patients with Hurler–
Scheie and Scheie phenotypes, which can lead to a suboptimal treatment outcome. Increased awareness of MPS I
signs and symptoms by primary care providers and pediatric
subspecialists is crucial to initiate early treatment and to
improve the quality of life of MPS I patients.

threatening genetic disorder [25]. This report looks at how
diagnosis and disease-specific treatment of MPS I have
changed over time by analyzing aggregate data from nearly
900 patients enrolled in the MPS I Registry.
MPS I (McKusick 607014) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by deficient enzyme
activity of α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), leading to lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in multiple tissues
throughout the body. MPS I is a chronic, progressive disease
affecting the heart, eyes, bones, joints, respiratory system,
facial appearance, viscera, and often the central nervous system. It has historically been classified clinically into three
syndromes based on age of onset, rapidity of progression,
and presence and degree of cognitive involvement [23]. Hurler
syndrome describes patients with the most severe form of MPS
I, with signs and symptoms typically appearing in infancy and
a median age of death of 6.8 years when untreated [20].
Patients with Scheie syndrome present later in childhood and
demonstrate slower symptom progression with preservation of
cognition and survival into adulthood [30]. Hurler–Scheie
describes an intermediate form with no or mild cognitive
impairment and death usually occurring in adolescence or early
adulthood when untreated. Patients with Hurler–Scheie and
Scheie syndromes also have been referred to as having attenuated MPS I. Collectively, these forms represent different
degrees of severity along a disease spectrum without strict
clinical, biochemical, or molecular diagnostic criteria in place
to differentiate them.
With an overall prevalence of 1:100,000 live births [19, 20,
27] and significant variability in presentation, diagnosis of
MPS I in all its forms poses a true challenge [8, 32]. Initial
diagnosis is primarily based on physician recognition of signs
and symptoms. Deficient IDUA activity and excess urinary
GAG excretion are seen in all patients, but do not accurately
predict disease severity or form. Although some genotype–
phenotype correlations have been established [11, 29], most
known disease-causing mutations (over 100 to date) are individually unique (“private”) and uncharacterized. Treatment of
MPS I has also proven challenging as disease-specific treatment options are limited, intensive, and not curative. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat
more than 500 patients with MPS I since 1981 [1, 18] and is
typically recommended for patients with Hurler syndrome
under 2 years of age with normal cognition (DQ>70), as it
can prolong survival, preserve neurocognition, and ameliorate
some somatic features [21]. However, due to its significant
morbidity and mortality, HSCT is reserved for the most severe
form of MPS I [5, 6, 28]. The allogenic stem cell infusion is
given following conditioning with chemotherapeutic agents
used to suppress the immune response; when successful, the
transplant is a one-time procedure, though graft failure may
necessitate subsequent transplants. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase (recombinant human α-Liduronidase; Aldurazyme®, BioMarin Pharmaceutical and
Genzyme, a Sanofi Company) was approved in 2003 to treat
the non-neurologic manifestations of MPS I and is the primary
treatment option for patients with Hurler–Scheie and Scheie
syndromes. Laronidase is also used to treat Hurler patients who
are not candidates for HSCT because of age, health status,
access to transplant, or parental choice. Laronidase must be
given as a weekly peripheral or central intravenous infusion
and is a lifelong therapy.
The timing of treatment initiation, and therefore of diagnosis, is thought to be an important factor for the success of
both HSCT and laronidase. Developmental outcomes are
better when transplant occurs before 24 months of age
[26]. Laronidase may also be more beneficial when started
early, as suggested by a case report of a sib pair with Hurler–
Scheie syndrome [15]. Other than laronidase and HSCT,
additional management of MPS I is symptom-based and largely supportive, such as surgical interventions (e.g., adenotonsillectomy, hernia repair, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, cardiac
valve replacement, carpal tunnel release, spinal decompression); physical, occupational, and speech therapies; respiratory
support (e.g., continuous positive pressure ventilation with
oxygen supplementation); hearing aids; and medications for
pain and gastrointestinal disturbances.
With the intent of improving the long-term health outcomes and quality of life of patients with MPS I worldwide,
we report how the chronology of symptom onset, diagnosis,
and treatment initiation with HSCT and laronidase have
evolved over time among Registry patients. We also analyze
treatment trends among patients in the MPS I Registry with
regard to the use of HSCT and laronidase by reported
phenotypes. Although there are some genotype–phenotype
correlations in MPS I [29], genotype information was not
included in the analysis since treatment decisions are usually
based on clinical manifestations, as newborn screening is
not yet available.
Methods
Variables analyzed and statistical methods
Data entered into the Registry as of March 2010 were analyzed. The 891 MPS I patients came from 179 sites in 33
countries (Table 1). Regionally, 46.6% of the patients came
from Europe and the Middle East, 35.1% from North America, 14.9% from Latin America, and 3.4% from Asia Pacific.
MPS I forms (Hurler, Hurler–Scheie, Scheie, and unknown
phenotypes) were analyzed by year of treatment initiation and
year of diagnosis with respect to the following treatment
groups: HSCT, ERT with laronidase, both laronidase and
HSCT, or neither treatment. A phenotype designation of “unknown” signifies that the reporting physician either checked
912 Eur J Pediatr (2012) 171:911–919

“undetermined” or left the field blank on the Patient Enrollment form. Treatment chronology was determined by analyzing age at symptom onset, diagnosis, and first disease-specific
treatment (either HSCT or ERT) in relation to reported phenotype and year of diagnosis. These analyses excluded
patients who reported symptom onset after diagnosis, as
occurs in siblings of children already carrying an MPS I
diagnosis, whose diagnosis and treatment chronology are not
representative of the general MPS I population. Three time
periods were examined: patients diagnosed before 2003 (prior
to laronidase approval), patients diagnosed in 2003–2005, and
patients diagnosed in 2006–2009. The latter two time periods
are not event-specific but were chosen to allow for sufficient
numbers of patients in each group for meaningful comparison.
Among Hurler patients who underwent HSCT, age at first
HSCT was analyzed by year of first HSCT.
Treatment initiation was defined as the initial laronidase
infusion or the initial HSCT, whichever treatment modality
was used first. Among transplanted patients, the stem cell
source (bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, or peripheral
blood) was determined. Among transplanted patients receiving laronidase, the timing of laronidase with respect to transplant was analyzed. Peri-transplant ERT was defined as
laronidase given at any time during the interval 6 months prior
and 3 months after HSCT. With respect to use of ERT in
conjunction with transplantation, the distribution of patients
by number and location (country) of treatment centers was
also determined. Variables are summarized using descriptive
statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, designated percentiles, and minimum and maximum values. As
data are not available for all variables in every patient, the
number of observations is always designated.
Results
Patient demographics
The demographic profiles of the 891 Registry patients are
shown in Table 2. Patients classified as having Hurler syndrome made up more than half of the study population, while
patients with the Hurler–Scheie and Scheie forms made up one
quarter and one tenth, respectively. Caucasian patients made
up >80% of the Hurler and Scheie groups, but only 61% of the
Hurler–Scheie group. Approximately 9% of patients had an
unknown form. Males and females were equally distributed in
this MPS I population, as expected for an autosomal recessive
disorder. Consistent with clinical severity, the median ages of
symptom onset, diagnosis, and treatment initiation (HSCT or
laronidase) were earliest for Hurler patients (0.5 year, 0.8 year,
and 1.4 years, respectively), intermediate for Hurler–Scheie
patients (1.9, 3.8, and 8.6 years), and latest for Scheie patients
(5.4, 9.4, and 17.1 years). The intervals between median age at
onset of symptoms to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment initiation were on the order of several months for Hurler
patients, a few years for Hurler–Scheie patients, and several
years for Scheie patients.
Chronology of symptom onset, MPS I diagnosis,
and treatment initiation
Figure 1 shows the median age at symptom onset, diagnosis,
and initiation of treatment with either HSCT or laronidase for
each disease form by year of diagnosis: <2003, 2003–2005,
and 2006–2009. Several notable trends were observed. The

median age at symptom onset remained relatively stable for
Hurler and Scheie patients over time, whereas it decreased by
approximately 1.5 years for Hurler–Scheie patients after 2003.
On the other hand, the age at diagnosis was stable over time
for all forms. The interval between median age at diagnosis
and initiation of treatment decreased for all groups after 2003,
when laronidase was approved. The decrease was more notable for Hurler–Scheie and Scheie patients (several years) than
for Hurler patients (several months). During 2006–2009, the
median interval between age at diagnosis and initiation of
treatment for individuals with Hurler–Scheie was 0.5 year,
and for Scheie patients, 1.4 years. However, even after the
2003 approval of laronidase, the median interval between the
age of symptom onset and the age of treatment initiation
between 2006 and 2009 for the Hurler–Scheie and Scheie
patients was 2.42 and 6.71 years, respectively.
Disease-specific treatment allocation by MPS I phenotype
The allocation of disease-specific treatments over time for the
770 treated patients is shown in Fig.2. HSCT has been used
primarily in Hurler patients, but especially so since 2003. Since
laronidase became available, the proportion of patients treated
with laronidase has increased in all disease forms. Among
Hurler patients, almost half of those who began treatment in
2006–2009 received laronidase alone, and approximately two
thirds of those who were transplanted also received laronidase.
Analysis of untreated MPS I patients
Of the 891 MPS I patients, 116 (13%) were listed as untreated
with either laronidase or HSCT. Over time, the proportion of
untreated patients has decreased. When analyzed by year of
diagnosis, 83 of the 534 patients (16%) diagnosed before 2003
were untreated, as compared with 21 of the 197 patients (11%)
diagnosed in 2003–2005, and 11 of the 159 patients (7%)
diagnosed in 2006–2009. Among untreated patients, all three
disease forms as well as patients with an undetermined/missing phenotype were represented. Of the 115 total untreated
patients who had a date of diagnosis, 56 (49%) were Hurler
patients diagnosed before 2003.
HSCT and laronidase treatment trends
Among all patients with Hurler syndrome receiving HSCT,
the median age at first transplant has not changed over time
(Fig.3) though the proportion of patients receiving stem
cells from cord blood or peripheral blood rather than bone
marrow has increased from 26 out of 158 patients (16.5%)
before 2003 to 33 out of 65 patients in 2003–2005 and 39
out of 64 patients in 2006–2009 (Fig.4). Among patients
receiving stem cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood,

transplanted patients also reported receiving laronidase. While
this analysis included laronidase given to HSCT patients at
any time in their disease course, nearly all patients (102 out of
111; 91.9%) who received both treatments after 2003 received
laronidase in the peri-transplant period. The 42 patients who
received laronidase and HSCT, with first treatment in 2007–
2009, came from ten centers (18 patients) in the USA and
seven centers (24 patients) in Europe (Spain, Belgium, Italy,
UK, Netherlands, Czech Republic). Ten of the 17 centers
reported only one patient, while the maximum number of
patients treated at any one center was 11. The three patients
who underwent their first transplant in 2007–2009 and did not
receive laronidase came from different centers in Europe.
Discussion
Analysis of data from the MPS I Registry has allowed for
improved understanding of the natural history of MPS I and
will enable evaluation of the impact of therapeutic advances on
morbidity and mortality [2, 3, 25, 30]. Limitations of observational registries such as the MPS I Registry, in which anonymized data are submitted voluntarily, include incomplete,
missing, or inaccurate data, as well as losses to follow-up and
lack of standardization of patient assessments. The voluntary
nature of the Registry may also lead to biased data as not all
physicians who manage MPS I patients use the MPS I Registry. Despite these potential biases, the data presented here offer
insight into diagnosis and treatment trends in the largest cohort
of MPS I patients ever evaluated.
Our data show that the median age at diagnosis has not
decreased over time for any form of MPS I, despite available
treatment options. Although Hurler patients tend to be diagnosed within a few months of symptom onset, Hurler–
Scheie and Scheie patients still remain undiagnosed for
years after symptom onset (Fig. 1). This gap not only
represents years of reduced quality of life that would likely
be ameliorated by treatment, but also a lost opportunity for
preventing or delaying irreversible disease manifestations,
as well as for genetic counseling about the risk of future
siblings being affected. Sibling case studies and studies in
the MPS I dog model suggest that starting enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase shortly after birth can significantly improve clinical outcome [13–15, 33]. Most patients
who begin treatment at a very young age have an older
sibling with a known diagnosis of MPS I. While studies of
affected sib pairs will certainly provide more information

about the potential impact of early laronidase treatment,
prompt clinical diagnosis will be imperative for the majority
of MPS I patients to benefit from this information. Demonstration of substantial improvement in clinical outcomes
with earlier diagnosis and treatment of MPS I along with
an enhanced ability to predict phenotype at birth through
genotype–phenotype correlations and/or disease biomarkers
will underscore the need for broad implementation of a
newborn screening program for this rare, life-threatening
disorder and will aid in decisions of which patients to treat
with what therapies, and how early to treat them.
As would be expected, the time interval from diagnosis to
initiation of disease-specific treatment decreased following the
availability of laronidase in 2003, especially for Hurler–Scheie
and Scheie patients, who until then had generally been offered
only palliative, symptom-based treatments. Prior to 2003, ERT
with laronidase was available only through clinical trials, the
largest of which enrolled mostly older children, adolescents,
and young adults with a mean duration of 13 years since
symptom onset [9]. In addition, the proportion of untreated
patients has decreased over time. Despite the decrease in time
from diagnosis to treatment, there still exists a delay of 0.5 year
and 1.4 years between median ages at diagnosis and treatment
for Hurler–Scheie and Scheie patients, respectively, during the
most recent time interval of 2006–2009. In comparison, for
patients with the Hurler form, there was almost no delay
between diagnosis and treatment. This may be due to parents
and/or diagnosing physicians perceiving the attenuated phenotypes as milder, or less urgent, thereby further delaying time to
treatment. In addition, it may represent time needed for laronidase approval by reimbursement authorities [7]. There may
also be regional differences in the delay between diagnosis and
treatment, given that laronidase was not approved outside the
European Union and the USA until 2005.
Interestingly, when looking at Fig. 1, the age of symptom
onset appears to have decreased somewhat in both the Hurler–
Scheie and Scheie populations. Rather than a true change in
the natural history of MPS I disease, this finding is more likely
to be secondary to small patient numbers and the retrospective
awareness that certain common early symptoms (such as
hernia and chronic otitis media) are often related to MPS I.
Also, while the actual age of diagnosis has not greatly improved, parents and physicians may have improved in the
retrospective recognition of the common early manifestations
of the disease, which led to younger ages of symptom onset in
the attenuated patient populations.
Of note, patients with an unknown disease form tended to
present with MPS I symptoms between the ages of patients
classified as Hurler and Hurler–Scheie. Similarly, they were
typically diagnosed and treated at ages in between those of
Hurler and Hurler–Scheie patients as well. This suggests that
patients in the Registry with an unknown disease form are more
likely to be on the more severe end of the MPS I spectrum.
This analysis identified several shifts in clinical practice,
such as the increasing use of laronidase among transplanted
patients, particularly in the peri-transplant period, and the increasing use of cord blood as a stem cell source. The proportion
of unrelated versus related donors for HSCT has remained
relatively stable as unrelated bone marrow donors have been
replaced by unrelated cord blood donors. Use of laronidase in
the peri-transplant period has been reported to be safe and well
tolerated without interfering with engraftment or increasing the
risk of graft-versus-host disease [6, 12, 16, 17, 31, 34]. Laronidase treatment may be particularly beneficial in patients in
poor clinical condition prior to HSCT, to help improve their
eligibility for transplant and tolerance of the full-intensity transplant conditioning [12, 16, 17, 24, 31].
In addition, an increasing proportion of Hurler patients in
the Registry is receiving laronidase alone (Fig. 2), reflecting
the fact that HSCT is not available in many parts of the
world, while the majority of transplanted patients are from
North America and Europe. A recent MPS I Registry analysis comparing patients from Latin America to those from
the rest of the world found that less than 1% of patients in
Latin America had been transplanted, compared to 27% of
patients from the rest of the world [22]. Our MPS I Registry
patients came from over 30 countries in Europe and the
Middle East, North America, Latin America, and Japan
and Asia Pacific (Table 1). Regional differences in treatment
availability would also impact the ages at treatment initiation as well as the proportion of untreated patients. For
example, in Brazil, which has a universal-access public
health care system, neither laronidase nor HSCT is covered
by government or specialized pharmaceutical programs [7].
Narrowing the gap between symptom onset and MPS I
diagnosis is of the utmost importance and largely relies on
increased recognition of clinical red flags by community
physicians and pediatric specialists managing the many MPS
I-related symptoms, such as otolaryngologists, orthopedists,
rheumatologists, and ophthalmologists. While there is significant variability of first presenting symptom both within and
between phenotypes, certain symptoms have been consistently noted to appear earlier than others in the MPS I population.
Coarse facial appearance, abdominal distension, and corneal
clouding are among the most common presenting symptoms
in children with Hurler syndrome [4, 10]. In the patients with
attenuated forms, joint stiffness/contractures, recurrent ENT
symptoms, corneal clouding, and umbilical hernias are the
most prevalent initial symptoms [4, 30, 32]. In addition,
certain constellations of symptoms should raise a physician’s
suspicion of MPS I. In a 2009 study of surgical procedures in
544 MPS I Registry patients representing all clinical forms,
72% had had at least one surgical procedure, with a median of
3 to 4 surgeries per patient, and with nearly half of the patients
reporting two or more surgeries by age 4 years [2]. Surgeries
often appeared unrelated, such as combinations of ear tubes,
Eur J Pediatr (2012) 171:911–919 917

hernia repair, and tendon releases in the same patient, and
often preceded the patient’s MPS I diagnosis, particularly in
the attenuated phenotypes. Many procedures were also performed at ages atypical for the general pediatric population,
such as younger ages of tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, and
older ages of hernia repair in patients with MPS I.
Given the rarity of MPS I, increased efforts to educate
community pediatricians and pediatric surgical subspecialists
on clinical red flags that should prompt a genetics referral is of
the utmost importance. An MPS I Registry analysis of early
presenting symptoms for each MPS I form is underway to aid
the front-line clinicians with earlier symptom recognition.
Furthermore, future analysis of MPS I long-term therapeutic
outcomes is merited, as large-scale evidence of improved
outcomes with earlier diagnosis and treatment would reinforce
the need for increased recognition of clinical red flags, allow
better understanding of the therapeutic potential of current
treatment modalities, and underscore the need for newborn
screening for this disorder.
