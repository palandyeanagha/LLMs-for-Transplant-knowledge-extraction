Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with all features of the metabolic syndrome. Although 
deposition of excess triglycerides within liver cells, a hallmark of NAFLD, is associated with a loss of insulin 
sensitivity, it is not clear which cellular abnormality arises first. We have explored this in mice overexpressing carbohydrate responsive element–binding protein (ChREBP). On a standard diet, mice overexpressing 
ChREBP remained insulin sensitive, despite increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis/fatty acid 
esterification and resultant hepatic steatosis (simple fatty liver). Lipidomic analysis revealed that the steatosis was associated with increased accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). In primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes, ChREBP overexpression induced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), 
the enzyme responsible for the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into MUFAs. SFA impairment of 
insulin-responsive Akt phosphorylation was therefore rescued by the elevation of Scd1 levels upon ChREBP 
overexpression, whereas pharmacological or shRNA-mediated reduction of Scd1 activity decreased the beneficial effect of ChREBP on Akt phosphorylation. Importantly, ChREBP-overexpressing mice fed a high-fat diet 
showed normal insulin levels and improved insulin signaling and glucose tolerance compared with controls, 
despite having greater hepatic steatosis. Finally, ChREBP expression in liver biopsies from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was increased when steatosis was greater than 50% and decreased in the presence of 
severe insulin resistance. Together, these results demonstrate that increased ChREBP can dissociate hepatic 
steatosis from insulin resistance, with beneficial effects on both glucose and lipid metabolism.
Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is gaining increasing 
recognition as a component of the epidemic of obesity worldwide. 
NAFLD is the most common cause of liver dysfunction and affects 
close to 20 million of patients in the USA (1). The spectrum of 
NAFLD ranges from simple fatty liver (hepatic steatosis), with 
benign prognosis, to a potentially progressive form, nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. All features 
of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
arterial hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (in the form of elevated 
triglyceride [TG] levels), are associated with NAFLD/NASH (2). 
Despite being potentially severe, little is known about the natural 
history or prognostic significance of NAFLD.
Excessive accumulation of TGs in hepatocytes is the hallmark 
of NAFLD (3, 4). Despite the existing correlation between fatty 
liver and insulin resistance, it remains unclear whether insulin 
resistance causes the excessive accumulation of TGs in liver or 
whether the increase in TG itself or of metabolic intermediates 
may play a causal role in the development of hepatic or systemic insulin resistance. Studies have favored the concept that the 
accumulation of intra-hepatic lipids precedes the state of insulin 
resistance, while others have shown that hepatic TGs themselves 
are not toxic and may in fact protect the liver from lipotoxicity by 
buffering the accumulation of deleterious fatty acids (5–8). Such 
findings suggest that hepatic steatosis is not necessarily associated with insulin resistance (9–11). In agreement with this concept, 
an identified population of obese humans can stay free of insulin 
resistance and are metabolically healthy despite morbid obesity 
(12). These findings suggest that not all lipids are detrimental for 
insulin sensitivity and that specific lipid species, when present in 
the proper location and time, may trigger signals that modulate 
adaptation to stress (13, 14).
The sources of fat contributing to fatty liver include peripheral 
TGs stored in white adipose tissue that flow to the liver by way of 
plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), dietary fatty acids, and 
fatty acids produced de novo through hepatic lipogenesis. After 
the esterification step, TGs can either be stored as lipid droplets within hepatocytes or secreted into the blood as VLDL, but, 
depending on the nutritional status, they can also be hydrolyzed 
to allow the channeling of fatty acids toward the β-oxidation 
pathway (15). Using a multiple-stable-isotope approach, Donnelly et al. (16) estimated that, of the TG content accounted for

in the livers of patients with NAFLD, 60% arose from NEFA, a 
little over 10% came from the diet, and close to 30% came from 
de novo lipogenesis, underlying the importance of de novo TG 
synthesis in the etiology of NAFLD. Pharmacologic or genetic 
manipulation of key lipogenic enzymes in mice can have profound metabolic consequences (reviewed in ref. 15). However, 
whether endogenously synthesized lipids per se affect insulin 
sensitivity is not clear.
Over recent years, studies reported that the liver transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element–binding protein 
(ChREBP) is required for the induction of the glycolytic enzyme 
L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) by glucose and that acting in synergy 
with sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) 
stimulates lipogenic genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase [Acaca] and 
fatty acid synthase [FASN]) in response to insulin and glucose, 
respectively (17–19). The activation of ChREBP in response to 
glucose involves several posttranslational modifications, such 
as O-GlcNAcylation (20), acetylation on specific lysine (Lys672) 
(21), and dephosphorylation on serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) 
residues (22). We have recently reported that modulating Ser196 
phosphorylation is important for ChREBP intracellular localization and activity in response to glucose and/or glucagon (23, 24). 
The role of ChREBP in the control of glucose and lipid homeostasis is rather complex, since, on one hand, global ChREBP deficiency leads to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance 
in C57BL/6J mice (25), and, on the other hand, ChREBP deficiency 
in an obese ob/ob background improves hepatic steatosis and other 
related metabolic alterations, including insulin resistance (26, 27). 
These opposite phenotypes may reside in the fact that ChREBP 
controls both glycolysis and lipogenesis and that the beneficial 
effect of ChREBP deficiency may only be apparent in the context 
of lipid overload. Given these apparent contradictory effects, we 
thought that a better knowledge of the role of ChREBP in the control of hepatic metabolism was needed.

In this study, we determined the metabolic impact of enhancing 
liver lipogenic rates via ChREBP on the outcome of hepatic steatosis and/or insulin resistance. We showed that while stimulating 
the entire lipogenic/esterification program, the adenoviral-mediated overexpression of ChREBP in mouse liver does not lead to 
insulin resistance. The dissociation between ChREBP-mediated 
steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance was even more apparent 
under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Lipidomic analysis revealed 
that ChREBP-mediated hepatic steatosis was not deleterious 
and that beneficial lipid species (monounsaturated fatty acids 
[MUFAs]) were preferentially enriched. Lastly, we measured the 
expression of ChREBP in livers of a small cohort of patients with 
histologically proven NASH. We compared the hepatic levels of 
CHREBP mRNA, according to the degree of steatosis and the severity of insulin resistance. Here, we also report a significant correlation among hepatic ChREBP expression, liver steatosis, and insulin resistance in humans.
Results
Overexpression of ChREBP in liver leads to the induction of the entire 
lipogenic and esterification program. To gain insights into the role 
of ChREBP in lipogenesis and insulin resistance, an adenovirus 
that expresses a dephosphorylated isoform of ChREBP (DP) was 
generated (19). Although we recently reported the importance of 
ChREBP acetylation and O-GlcNAcylation in response to glucose 
(20, 21), we also described the relevance of modulating the phosphorylation of Ser196 residue for ChREBP localization and/or 
activity in response to glucose and glucagon (23, 24). The phosphorylation level of the dephosphorylated ChREBP isoform was 
revealed using a specific ChREBP Ser196 antibody (Figure 1, A and 
B). Four weeks after adenoviral injection (1 single dose of 5 × 109
plaque-forming units/mice [pfu/mice]), high levels of GFP expression were detected in livers of both GFP- and ChREBP-injected 
mice but not in other tested tissues (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI41636DS1). ChREBP total protein (Figure 1A) and nuclear content (Figure 1C) were markedly increased in livers from ChREBP 
mice compared with that in GFP controls but not in other sites of 
ChREBP expression (i.e., white adipose tissue or skeletal muscle) 
(Supplemental Figure 1B). As a result, expression of key genes 
of glycolysis (Pklr), lipogenesis (Acaca, Fasn, Scd1), elongation 
(Elovl6) as well as esterification (GPAT) was significantly 
increased in livers of ChREBP 
mice compared with those 
of GFP controls (Figure 1E). 
The induction of Acaca, Fasn, 
and Scd1 gene expression led 
to a parallel increase in total 
protein content (Figure 1D). 
Overexpression of ChREBP 
also led to the induction of 
glycolytic and lipogenic genes 
(Pklr, Fasn, Acaca, Scd1) under 
fasting conditions (Supplemental Figure 2A).
The observed changes in 
gene expression occurred without influencing liver X receptor α (LXR) or Pparg expression (Figure 1E). In addition, no modification in mature SREBP-1c 
protein content was observed (Figure 1C). Consistent with this 
observation, glucokinase (Gck) expression, which is primarily under 
the transcriptional control of insulin via SREBP-1c (28) remained 
unchanged under ChREBP overexpression (Figure 1E).
Overexpression of ChREBP leads to modification in liver lipid composition. We next determined the metabolic consequences of liverrestricted ChREBP overexpression (Figure 2). ChREBP overexpression led to significant accumulation of lipid droplets visible 
after Oil Red O staining on liver sections (Figure 2A) that was 
correlated to a 3-fold increase in TG concentrations (Figure 2B). 
As a consequence, liver weight was increased by 25% in ChREBP 
mice compared with that in GFP mice (Table 1). In agreement with 
a redirection of the glucose flux toward fatty acid synthesis, we 
observed that glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and glycogen concentrations were reduced in livers of ChREBP mice (Figure 2C). Interestingly, the weight of epididymal adipose tissue was reduced by 
over 50% in ChREBP mice, and NEFA concentrations were lower 
(although the difference between GFP and ChREBP mice did not 
reach statistical significance) (Table 1). Liver damage was assessed 
by serum levels of liver aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which leak out to the circulation 
with liver injury. Intriguingly, AST concentrations were lower in 
ChREBP mice (Table 1), despite enhanced lipogenic gene program 
and hepatic steatosis (Figure 1E and Figure 2B). Consistent with 
potential lower liver damage, the level of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, reflecting the activity of NF-κB, was significantly lower in 
livers of ChREBP mice (Figure 2E).
Because fatty acids have been shown to serve as signaling molecules, exerting either beneficial (i.e., lipokines) or detrimental (i.e., 
lipotoxicity) metabolic outcomes (8, 29, 30), lipidomic analysis was 
performed in livers of ChREBP mice. No difference in ceramide 
concentrations was observed between GFP and ChREBP mice 
(Figure 2B). Accumulation of diacylglycerol (DAG) has been reported to cause insulin resistance by activating a specific isoform of protein kinase C, PKCε (8, 31, 32). Surprisingly, despite a 3-fold increase 
in DAG concentrations in livers of ChREBP mice (Figure 2B), 
no modification in PKCε localization in the cytosol and/or in plasma 
membranes of livers from ChREBP mice was observed (Figure 2D). 
Interestingly, lipidomics revealed a 3-fold increase in MUFA content in livers of ChREBP mice without any modification of the

concentrations of either saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (Figure 2F). It should be noted that a specific increase in palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) and oleate (C18:1, n-9) 
concentrations was observed (Figure 2F), in agreement with the 
significant effect of ChREBP overexpression on SCD1 expression 
(Figure 1D and Figure 2G).
ChREBP-induced steatosis is not associated with insulin resistance. To 
determine whether the development of hepatic steatosis affected 
whole glucose homeostasis in ChREBP mice in vivo, glucose, 
insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed (Figure 3A). 
While no statistical difference was reached for glucose or insulin tolerance between GFP and ChREBP mice, a difference was 
observed for pyruvate tolerance (Figure 3A). While plasma glucose rose significantly for both GFP and ChREBP mice after the 
injection of pyruvate, pyruvate conversion into glucose was lower 
in ChREBP mice compared with that in GFP mice throughout 
the time course of the test (Figure 3A). This difference, which 
reflects lower rates of gluconeogenesis, was in agreement with 
lower fasting blood glucose concentrations measured in ChREBP 
mice (Table 1) and with the significant decrease in expression 
of hepatic PCK1, the rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis 
whose expression is inhibited by insulin (Figure 3, C and D). The 
expression of Ppargc1a, which coactivates a number of transcription factors, such as hepatic nuclear factor-4α and forkhead box 
O1 (Foxo1), was also significantly decreased in livers of ChREBP 
mice. Foxo1 mRNA levels were also decreased by 50% (Figure 3D).

Modification in liver gene expression was correlated with a 3-fold 
increase in protein kinase B/Akt Ser473 phosphorylation under 
fasting conditions (Figure 3B). This increase in Akt Ser473 phosphorylation occurred independently of an increase in insulin 
concentrations in fasted ChREBP mice, suggesting enhanced 
insulin sensitivity in these mice (Table 1). In contrast, when a 
supraphysiological dose of insulin was injected into GFP and 
ChREBP mice, no apparent modification of the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) or of GSK3β (Ser9) was 
observed in livers of ChREBP mice compared with that in controls (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Since conditions associated with high rates of lipogenesis are 
associated with a shift in cellular metabolism from fatty acid 
β-oxidation to TG esterification, we examined mRNA levels of 
Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial β-oxidation, and 
Ppara, a nuclear receptor that promotes β-oxidation. The expression of Cpt1a and Ppara was significantly decreased in livers of fasted ChREBP mice compared with that of GFP controls, suggesting 
decreased mitochondrial β-oxidation rates in these mice (Figure 3D). 
We also measured the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 
(FGF21), a key metabolic regulator whose expression is regulated 
via PPAR pathways during states requiring increased fatty acid oxidation (33). Fgf21 mRNA levels were 3-fold increased in livers of 
ChREBP mice, despite decreased Ppara gene expression (Figure 3D). 
Our results suggest that the transcriptional control exerted by 
ChREBP on FGF21 (34) may be dominant over that of PPAR and 
that increased FGF21 expression did not lead to increased mitochondrial β-oxidation rates under our experimental conditions. 
Altogether, our results suggest that ChREBP-mediated hepatic 
steatosis is dissociated from insulin resistance in mice.

ChREBP overexpression protects against palmitate-induced insulin resistance in primary cultured hepatocytes. Next, we determined whether 
the increase in hepatic MUFA concentrations measured in livers 
of ChREBP mice may account for the lack of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. To address this issue, we tested whether a selective 
ChREBP-mediated increase in MUFA concentrations (such as 
oleate) could protect against SFA-mediated insulin resistance in 
primary hepatocytes. Mouse hepatocytes were first infected with 
either 3 pfu/cell of GFP or ChREBP adenovirus for 24 hours and 
then incubated in the presence of 0.48 mM palmitate (PALM, 
C16:0) for another 24 hours. Hepatocytes infected with GFP 
(3 pfu/cell) and incubated with a mix of oleate/PALM (OLE/PALM) 
for 24 hours were used as controls (Figure 4). After adenoviral 
treatment, insulin (1 nM) was added for times ranging from 0 
to 5 minutes. The insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on 
Ser473 was significantly reduced in the presence of PALM (at time 
points 3 and 5 minutes) (Figure 4, A and B). The PALM-mediated 
decreased Akt phosphorylation was not due to cell apoptosis, since 
no significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 was detected under all 
the tested culture conditions (Figure 4A). The weak cleaved caspase-3 band was likely due to the adenoviral infection, since it was 
equivalent regardless of the culture conditions (Figure 4A). Interestingly, when ChREBP was overexpressed, the deleterious effect 
of PALM on insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 
and on Thr308 was prevented (Figure 4A) and was associated with 
a marked induction of SCD1 (the Δ9-desaturase), the enzyme 
responsible for the conversion of SFA to MUFA (35) (Figure 4A). As 
a result, a significant increase in Δ9-desaturation index, reflecting 
the MUFA/SFA ratio, was observed under these experimental conditions (Figure 4C). In agreement with this hypothesis, a similar 
protective effect was observed when hepatocytes were incubated in 
the presence of a combination of OLE/PALM (Figure 4, B and C).
To better define the contribution of SCD1 to the ChREBP-mediated protective effects on Akt phosphorylation, we pharmacologically inhibited SCD1 activity (SCD1inhib), as described previously 
(36). First, within the same set of experiments, we confirmed both

the negative effect of PALM incubation on Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B) as well as the protective effect 
of ChREBP on Akt Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation in the presence of PALM (Figure 5, A and B). Performed in parallel, these results 
are comparable but are presented in 2 separate panels. When SCD1 
activity was pharmacologically inhibited in the presence of PALM 
(Figure 5A), the protective effect of ChREBP on insulin signaling (i.e., Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 
and Thr308) was significantly reduced (Figure 5B) 
and was correlated with a significant decrease in 
Δ9-desaturation index (Figure 5C). The Δ9-desaturation index was only significantly affected in 
presence of both ChREBP and PALM (Figure 5C), 
the only condition also associated with significant 
modification of the phosphorylated Akt/Akt ratio 
(Figure 5B). It should be noted here that ChREBP 
conditions alone (i.e., without PALM) did not 
increase the MUFA/SFA ratio, since hepatocytes 
were cultured under low glucose concentrations 
(5 mM), experimental conditions not sufficient to 
turn on lipogenic rates (17). Altogether, our results 
show that ChREBP overexpression reverses PALMinduced insulin resistance by increasing the MUFA/
SFA ratio in vitro.
To determine whether ChREBP overexpression 
in vitro led to metabolic changes downstream of 
Akt phosphorylation, basal and insulin-mediated 
inhibition of glucose production were measured 
in primary hepatocytes overexpressing ChREBP 
with or without the SCD1 inhibitor (Supplemental Figure 4). First, we observed that basal glucose 
production was increased by 20% upon PALM 
incubation. While insulin (100 nM) failed to 
decrease glucose production under PALM conditions, the presence of ChREBP enabled insulin to 
significantly decrease glucose production, despite 
the presence of PALM in the culture medium. 
This effect was lost when the SCD1 inhibitor was 
added (Supplemental Figure 4). This set of experiments confirms that ChREBP favors the effect of 
insulin on a key metabolic pathway such as glucose production in vitro.
Overexpression of SCD1 recapitulates the beneficial 
effect of ChREBP on Akt phosphorylation in vitro. AcylCoA desaturases, such as SCD1 (37), introduce a 
double bond at a specific position on the acyl chain 
of fatty acids, thereby influencing several structural, metabolic, and signaling properties of the fatty 
acid or of the fatty acid containing lipids. Among 
desaturases, SCD1 is particularly critical to convert SFAs (mainly PALM C16:0 and stearate C18:0) 
into MUFAs (palmitoleate C16:1n-7 and oleate 
C18:1n-9) in the liver (38). To better define the 
role of SCD1 in the beneficial effect of ChREBP on 
insulin signaling in liver cells, we performed experiments in which SCD1 was either overexpressed 
or knocked down using adenoviral strategies 
in primary cultured hepatocytes (Figure 6). 
We observed that SCD1 overexpression restored 
Akt phosphorylation on both Ser473 (Supplemental Figure 5) and Thr308 to control levels (Figure 6B) in the presence of PALM). In fact, SCD1 and ChREBP overexpression had similar beneficial effects on rescuing Akt phosphorylation (Figure 6, 
A and B) in the presence of PALM. It should be noted, however, 
that the levels of SCD1 reached were quite different depending on 
whether SCD1 or ChREBP was overexpressed (Figure 6A). Despite

with a combination of adenovirus as indicated (GFP, SCD1, ChREBP, shCTRL, and/or 
shSCD1) and described in the Methods section. Cells were then incubated for 24 hours 
with BSA or 0.48 mM albumin-bound PALM. An insulin (1 nM) time course was performed for 2 and 5 minutes (n = 6 independent cultures). (A) Western blot analysis

this difference, ChREBP efficiently rescued Akt phosphorylation 
to levels similar to those of SCD1 and control conditions (Figure 6, 
A and B). Importantly, we observed that the beneficial effect of 
ChREBP was significantly attenuated when SCD1 was knocked 
down (Figure 6, A and B). Recent studies have revealed that chronic SFA exposure activates unfolded protein response (UPR) in cultured cells (39, 40). UPR induces transcription of a set of genes 
whose protein products increase the capacity for protein folding 
and ER-associated degradation and induces apoptosis when the 
ER function is severely impaired (41, 42). Of these genes, chop is 
often used as an UPR marker. As previously described (40), chop
expression was increased in cells incubated with PALM (Figure 6C). 
Interestingly, the PALM-mediated induction of chop was prevented when SCD1 or ChREBP was overexpressed (Figure 6B). These 
results suggest that ChREBP and/or SCD1 prevented chop induction by increasing the MUFA/SFA ratio (as shown in Figure 5). 
Surprisingly, no significant reinduction of chop was observed when 
SCD1 was knocked down in the cells overexpressing ChREBP and 
incubated with PALM (Figure 6C), suggesting that ChREBP alone 
was sufficient to overcome the effect of PALM on chop expression.
Altogether, these experiments confirm that SCD1 overexpression can recapitulate the protective effect of ChREBP on Akt phosphorylation but also suggest that ChREBP overexpression may 
also exert its beneficial effects through additional mechanisms.
Exacerbated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed ChREBP mice. Having 
determined that ChREBP-mediated liver steatosis was dissociated from insulin resistance under standard chow diet (CD) conditions, we wished to address whether ChREBP overexpression 
could reverse some of the metabolic alterations induced by HFD 
feeding. To address this issue, C57BL/6J mice were maintained 
on a HFD (60% calories coming from fat) for 10 weeks. Six weeks 
after the beginning of the diet, mice were injected with 1 single 
dose of 5 × 109 pfu of GFP or ChREBP adenovirus and maintained 
on HFD for another 4 weeks. Mice injected with a similar dose 
of GFP and maintained for 10 weeks on standard CD were used 
as controls. ChREBP overexpression markedly induced glycolytic 
(Pklr) and lipogenic gene expression (Acaca, Fasn, Scd1, Elovl6) in 
livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice (Figure 7A). No difference in the 
expression of Cd36, involved in fatty acid uptake, was observed in 
livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice compared with that in HFD-fed 
GFP mice (Figure 7B). In contrast, a significant decrease in Cpt1a
gene expression (Figure 7B) and in β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (Table 1) was also observed, likely reflecting a decrease in 
β-oxidation rates in HFD-fed ChREBP mice. As a consequence, 
lipid droplet accumulation, as revealed by Oil red O staining on 
liver sections (Figure 8A), and hepatic TG concentrations were 
further increased (a 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 8C) in HFD-fed 
ChREBP mice compared with those in HFD-fed GFP mice. Interestingly, while their liver weight was increased (+40%), a marked 
decrease in white adipose tissue mass (–60%) (epididymal fat 
depot) was observed for HFD-fed ChREBP mice (Figure 8B), 
a reduction that was correlated with decreased NEFA concentrations (–40%) (Table 1). Despite exacerbated steatosis, no further 
increase in the expression of Tnfa, chop (Figure 8D), and of known

markers of inflammation (Ccl4, Mrc2, and Mgl1) (ref. 43 and data 
not shown) was observed in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice 
compared with HFD-fed GFP mice. Interestingly, a significant 
decrease in Il6 expression was measured (Figure 8D). Altogether, 
our results suggest that the ChREBP-mediated hepatic steatosis did not aggravate the inflammation status. Importantly, lipidomic analysis revealed that MUFA content was significantly 
increased in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice compared with 
that in HFD-fed GFP mice, as evidenced by a significant higher desaturation index (Figure 8E). Notably, oleate (C18:1 n-9) 
enrichment in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice occurred at the 
expense of PALM (C16:0), the percentage of which was significantly decreased (Figure 8F).
Beneficial metabolic and physiologic effects of ChREBP overexpression in 
HFD-fed mice. We next examined whether hepatic Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 and on Thr308 could be improved by ChREBP overexpression under HFD feeding (Figure 9A). As we observed in vitro 
(Figures 4–6), ChREBP overexpression caused a substantial increase 
in SCD1 protein content (Figure 9A) and markers of its activity (Figure 8E). In agreement with a significant state of insulin resistance,

the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 and Thr308 was reduced by 
about 50% in livers of HFD-fed GFP mice compared with that in 
CD-fed GFP mice (Figure 9B). Interestingly, Akt phosphorylation 
(Ser473 and Thr308) was not reduced in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP 
mice compared with that in HFD-fed GFP mice and was as high as 
in the control group (Figure 9, A and B). Accordingly, the phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues of several Akt substrates (ranging from 
250 to 55 kDa) was enhanced in HFD-fed ChREBP mice compared 
with that in HFD-fed GFP mice (Figure 9C). In addition, GSK3β
phosphorylation on Ser9 was comparable in livers of HFD-fed 
ChREBP and CD-fed GFP mice (Figure 9A). Sustained phosphorylation in these key effectors of insulin signaling (namely Akt, Akt 
substrates, GSK3β) occurred despite higher hepatic TG and DAG 
concentrations (Figure 8C). Fasting blood glucose concentrations 
were lower in HFD-fed ChREBP mice compared with those in HFDfed GFP mice (–30%) (Table 1) and were correlated with a significant 
decrease in Pck1 (–60%) and Ppargc1a gene expression (Figure 9E), 
and CRTC2 protein content (Figure 9A). Insulin regulates hepatic 
gluconeogenesis through the FoxO1-PPARGC1A interaction (44) 
and by promoting the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent 
degradation of CRTC2 (45). The fact that the expression of several key components of the gluconeogenic pathway (namely PCK1, 
PPARGC1A, CRTC2) was decreased in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP 
mice compared with that in HFD-fed GFP mice is in favor of a rescued insulin-signaling pathway. However, it should be noted that 
G6pc gene expression, a known target gene of ChREBP (46), was 
2-fold increased upon ChREBP overexpression (Figure 9E). Nevertheless, glucose tolerance was improved in HFD-fed ChREBP mice, 
and hyperinsulinemia was markedly decreased (Figure 10, A and B). 
As index of glycolytic flux in liver, hepatic pyruvate concentrations 
were measured (Figure 9D). Consistent with the transcriptional 
control exerted by ChREBP on L-PK expression (Figure 7A), a significant increase in hepatic pyruvate concentrations was observed 
(Figure 9D), supporting the idea that glucose flux is preferentially 
oriented toward glycolysis/lipogenesis in HFD-fed ChREBP mice.
Because Fgf21 gene expression is under the transcriptional control

culating levels of Fgf21 were measured (Figure 7B and Figure 10C). 
ChREBP overexpression led a to significant increase in Fgf21 mRNA 
concentrations and circulating levels, raising the possibility that 
enhanced circulating FGF21 levels may have also contributed to 
the observed improvement in glucose tolerance (Figure 10A).
ChREBP expression is positively related to the degree of hepatic steatosis and inversely to insulin resistance in patients with NASH. In order to 
translate the findings obtained in mice to human pathology, 25 
patients with histologically proven NASH were studied (48). Individual characteristics of patients are listed in Table 2. Mean BMI 
was 31 ± 5.5 kg/m2, and most patients had features of the metabolic syndrome. Mean homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) 
was 5.6 ± 2.6. Mean percentage of steatosis was 55% ± 21%, and, 
among the 25 patients, 28% had severe fibrosis (F3, F4). Only 16% 
had no fibrosis. The diagnosis of NASH was defined as steatosis 
of more than 20% of the liver and the presence of either hepatocyte 
ballooning or intralobular hepatocyte necrosis. Using the median values of steatosis (50%) and the HOMA index (4.8), CHREBP
mRNA levels were 2-fold higher in patients with steatosis of more 
than 50% compared with those in patients with steatosis of less 
than 50% (0.33 ± 0.03 relative expression [SEM] vs. 0.16 ± 0.03 relative expression [SEM]; P = 0.04) (Figure 11A). Conversely, ChREBP 
expression was decreased by 50% in patients with a HOMA index 
value of more than 4.8 compared with patients with a HOMA 
index value of less than 4.8 (0.18 ± 0.06 relative expression [SEM] 
vs. 0.35 ± 0.13 relative expression [SEM]; P = 0.04) (Figure 11B). 
Finally, significant correlations were found between the HOMA 
index (r2 = 0.25; P = 0.03) (Figure 11C) or the degree of liver steatosis (r2 = 0.27; P = 0.02) (Figure 11D) and CHREBP mRNA levels in 
livers of these patients.
Discussion
NAFLD is an increasing health concern now considered as a component of the metabolic syndrome (1). Excessive accumulation 
of TGs in hepatocytes is the hallmark of NAFLD. Dysregulated 
lipogenesis has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of 
hepatic steatosis in both humans (16, 49) and rodents (50). However, the contribution of the glucose-sensitive lipogenic transcription factor ChREBP to the pathophysiology of human steatosis 
and/or insulin resistance has not been clearly addressed. In addition, despite the widely accepted association between hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, it remains unclear whether a causal 
relationship always exists. Our study reports that ChREBP overexpression in mouse liver leads to a significant increase in hepatic 
TG concentrations and hepatic steatosis development. Interestingly, ChREBP overexpression in livers of HFD mice, while inducing 
a larger hepatic lipid overload, was protective against liver insulin 
resistance and was correlated with beneficial lipid species accumulation (i.e., oleate, C18:1 n-9, MUFA) and decreased percentage of 
PALM (C16:0). To our knowledge, our work is the first to report 
that hepatic ChREBP expression varies positively according to the 
degree of steatosis and inversely to insulin resistance in a cohort 
of patients with NASH.
ChREBP is a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription 
factor, playing a critical role in hepatic fatty acid synthesis (25–27). 
To further address the importance of ChREBP in the control of de 
novo lipogenesis and its relationship to insulin resistance development, we chose to overexpress a dephosphorylated isoform of 
ChREBP in mouse liver. Although it was previously reported that 
mutations of Ser196 and/or Thr666 may not result in a constitutively active form of ChREBP (51), we report here that ChREBP 
target genes were efficiently induced under both substrate abundance (standard CD and HFD) and fasting conditions. Indeed, 
ChREBP overexpression induced, the entire lipogenic/esterification program in liver independently of an increase in SREBP-1c 
activity and/or LXRα expression. Aside from previously known 
targets of ChREBP, such as L-PK, ACACA, FASN, GPAT, G6PC, 
and FGF21 (19, 34, 52), our results reveal that SCD1 and Elovl6 
are key ChREBP target genes. Indeed, a selective enrichment in 
their lipid products (i.e., MUFA) (Figure 2G) was observed upon 
ChREBP overexpression in liver under both standard and HFDs. 
Interestingly, both SCD1 and Elovl6 were identified among 700 
other direct target genes of ChREBP in a genome-wide scale analysis performed in HepG2 cells using ChIP sequencing (53).
Altogether, our results strongly support the hypothesis that 
ChREBP favors TG accumulation and may in fact protect liver 
from lipotoxicity by buffering the accumulation of detrimental 
fatty acids. In mammalian cells, fatty acids are required for the 
synthesis of phospholipid components of the membrane and 
energy storage as TGs. However, over accumulation of fatty acids 
can be considered toxic/deleterious (14, 54). To prevent lipotoxicity, cells can enhance incorporation of fatty acids into TGs 
that are then stored into lipid droplets (55). Under HFD feeding 
conditions (in terms of energy, 60% coming from fat), enhancing

endogenous generation of fatty acids via ChREBP overexpression 
had clear beneficial effects on both hepatic insulin signaling and 
glucose metabolism. Genes involved in lipogenesis and TG levels were further enhanced (+125%), and a notable switch in cellular fatty acid percentage was observed compared with HFD-fed 
GFP conditions. ChREBP overexpression induced hepatic steatosis with a greater accumulation of oleate than PALM (45% and 
15%, respectively), compared with GFP HFD steatosis, in which 
the oleate and PALM levels were nearly equivalent (27% and 24%, 
respectively) (Figure 12). Our results support the novel concept of 
lipoexpediency (in opposition to lipotoxicity) recently proposed 
by Semenkovich and colleagues (13). Emerging data implicate de 
novo lipogenesis in the generation of beneficial lipid transmitters that reduce disease risk (14). Although it may seem somehow paradoxical, optimizing lipid signals generated by de novo 
lipogenesis could help redirecting fat toward benefit, even in the 
setting of lipid overload (13). According to this hypothesis, it was 
reported that overexpression of DGAT1 improves storage of neutral TG within lipid droplets, thereby reducing deleterious lipid 
species, inflammation, and insulin resistance in macrophages 
and/or muscle cells (56–58). Disruption of elongases, enzymes 
that are crucial for fatty acids chain length (59), leads to severe 
metabolic alterations by changing free fatty acids pools (60), 
while their overexpression increases MUFA accumulation and 
TG synthesis and storage in lipid droplets. Lastly, the relevance 
of desaturase activity (namely SCD1, which introduces a cis double bond in the Δ9 position of saturated 16- and 18-carbon fatty 
acyl-CoA substrates; ref. 35) in fatty acid partitioning has recently 
been recognized as important as shown in experiments in which 
knockdown of unsaturase, by decreasing the MUFA/SFA ratio, 
causes ER stress and apoptosis. Of note, the expression of Dgat1, 
Elovl6, and Scd1 was significantly increased upon ChREBP overexpression in liver under HFD conditions (Figure 7A).
In fact, our results suggest that the lipogenic SCD1 enzyme 
was instrumental in the beneficial effects mediated by ChREBP 
overexpression. By stimulating SCD1 expression in liver, ChREBP 
led to the subsequent rise in oleate (C18:1n-9) concentrations 
under CD and HFD feeding. Experiments performed in primary 
hepatocytes revealed that ChREBP or SCD1 overexpression and/or 
oleate incubation prevented the deleterious effect of PALM on Akt 
phosphorylation (Ser473 and Thr308) and on chop induction. Our 
in vitro experiments support studies showing that lipotoxicity and 
ER stress are almost exclusively attributed to SFA (6, 39) and that 
they can be prevented by oleate and/or palmitoleate incubation 
(61, 62). ChREBP overexpression, through its positive control of 
SCD1, allowed for the conversion of PALM in the culture medium 
into specific lipids that are beneficial for insulin sensitivity and 
for the prevention of ER stress (i.e., chop induction). These results 
reinforce the concept that TG synthesis is crucial to prevent harmful effects on organelles and/or cell signaling. In agreement with 
this hypothesis, when SCD1 was inhibited pharmacologically or 
through a shRNA strategy, the protective effect of ChREBP on 
insulin signaling was significantly attenuated. Surprisingly, while 
it has been reported that SCD1 knockdown causes ER stress by 
causing SFA accumulation (39), no significant reinduction of chop
was observed when SCD1 was silenced in the context of ChREBP/
PALM conditions, suggesting that ChREBP overexpression alone 
could be sufficient to overcome the deleterious effect of PALM 
on chop induction. The contribution of SCD1 to hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and/or inflammation is rather complex. 
On one hand, inactivation of SCD1 in liver prevents fatty liver, 
insulin resistance, and obesity induced by high carbohydrate feeding (63) but, on the other hand, worsens diabetes in ob/ob mice 
(64). Furthermore, SCD1 deficiency aggravates the inflammatory 
state under conditions of methionine choline–deficient diet and 
in response to dextran sulfate sodium–induced acute colitis, causing hepatic overaccumulation of SFA that triggers hepatocellular 
apoptosis, liver damage, and NASH (65). Interestingly, oleic acid 
feeding and in vivo SCD1-rescued expression alleviates the dextran 
sulfate sodium–induced phenotype, suggesting that SCD1 and its 
related lipid species may serve as potential targets for intervention 
and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases (66). Therefore, consumption of an oleic-enriched diet or selective modulation of the 
lipogenic pathway via ChREBP and/or SCD1 could represent an 
interesting strategy to ameliorate and/or buffer the toxic effect of 
SFAs by diverting them to safe forms of lipids. In agreement with 
this concept, a recent study reports that consumption of an oleicenriched diet improves insulin sensitivity and decreases inflammation in muscles from aged rats (67).
Altogether, our study reveals that HFD-fed ChREBP mice are 
metabolically healthier than their controls, showing reduced 
fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced 
hyperinsulinemia, despite a higher grade of hepatic steatosis. It 
should be noted that ChREBP-mediated steatosis was dissociated 
from insulin resistance, despite elevated concentrations of DAG (a 
2-fold increase under CD but only a 20% under HFD), an important lipid intermediate previously implicated in hepatic insulin

resistance in both rodents (31, 32) and humans (8). Of note, our 
results are consistent with other mouse models in which increased 
DAG concentrations were not associated with insulin resistance. 
In these studies, overexpression of DGAT2 in liver (9) or blockade 
of VLDL secretion mediated by MTP inactivation (68) resulted in 
a clear dissociation between hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, despite a significant increase in hepatic DAG and ceramide 
concentrations. This discrepancy might be explained if different pools of DAG and ceramide exist within the hepatocytes, as 
previously suggested in muscle cells (69), with only certain pools 
being able to regulate inhibitors of insulin signaling (70). Another 
important feature of ChREBP overexpression is that amplified fat 
storage occurred in liver but was reduced in white adipose depot 
(under both standard diet and HFD). As a result, serum NEFAs, 
which predominantly arise from adipose tissue lipolysis at the 
fasting state, were reduced in HFD-fed ChREBP mice. Altogether, 
our current results contrast with previous studies reporting that 
ChREBP deficiency improves hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (25, 27). As mentioned in the 
Introduction, paradoxical metabolic/physiologic consequences of 
ChREBP deficiency have been previously reported, since deleterious or beneficial phenotypes can be observed depending whether 
ChREBP deficiency is generated under a context of lipid overload. 
We show here that ChREBP overexpression dissociated hepatic steatosis from insulin resistance by modifying the MUFA/SFA balance. Our results also suggest that enhanced glycolytic rates mediated by ChREBP overexpression (at the level of L-PK, evidenced 
by increased hepatic pyruvate concentrations) also contributed 
to the improvement of glucose tolerance in HFD-fed ChREBP 
mice (Figure 9D). Indeed, it has been previously reported that 
enhancing glycolytic rates through GCK in obese mice had beneficial influences on overall whole-body energy balance, including 
glucose tolerance (71). The fact that ChREBP global deficiency 
leads to decreased glycolytic rates (as evidenced by a lower pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate ratio) as well as major alterations in 
energy substrate utilization also supports this hypothesis. Lastly, 
the human homolog of ChREBP, WBSCR14 (also known as MondoB), is located on a chromosomal region deleted in the WilliamsBeuren syndrome, a syndrome characterized in 75% of the cases 
by severe glucose intolerance (72). Altogether, our results suggest 
that ChREBP could act as a dual regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, which have a reciprocal relationship in response to 
glucose. Indeed, under both standard diets and HFDs, key components of gluconeogenesis (namely PCK1, PPARGC1A, FOXO1, 
CRTC2) were decreased upon ChREBP overexpression. Interestingly, we observed a substantial decrease in the expression of the 
deacetylase SIRT1 in livers of HFD-fed ChREBP mice compared 
with that in HFD-fed GFP mice (data not shown), confirming the 
ChREBP-mediated inhibition of SIRT1 (73). In the liver, SIRT1 
controls gluconeogenic activity by modulating the acetylation

levels of a network of transcription factors and/or coactivators, 
including PPARGC1A (74–76). The deacetylation of PPARGC1A 
is tightly linked with enhanced PPARGC1A transcriptional activation (77). Therefore, as previously suggested by Noriega and 
colleagues (73), the ChREBP-mediated repression of SIRT1 could 
inhibit energy-producing pathways, such as gluconeogenesis 
(notably through increased acetylation levels of PPARGC1A). In 
agreement with this hypothesis, acetylation levels of PPARGC1A 
were decreased by 50% in livers of ChREBP knockout mice (73). 
Lastly, since the recent ChIP sequencing analysis of ChREBP identified gluconeogenic genes as direct targets of ChREBP (53), it is 
possible that the effect observed on these genes could be a direct 
consequence of ChREBP transcriptional repression rather than an 
indirect effect of increased Akt signaling.
Fatty acid biosynthesis is thought to occur to a greater extent 
in rodents compared with humans and could be even considered 
as a minor contributor to whole body lipid stores in present-day 
humans eating a typical HFD. However, Donnelly et al. (16) previously estimated that close to 30% of TGs accumulated in livers of 
patients with NAFLD came from de novo lipogenesis, and another study which reevaluated the contribution of lipogenesis to the 
development of hepatic steatosis showed that the expression of 
fatty acid metabolism-related genes, such as ACACA and FASN, 
is significantly increased in NAFLD (78). Interestingly, ChREBP 
expression (mRNA and protein content) was recently found to 
be elevated (a 2-fold increase) in livers of obese patients (79). To 
our knowledge, our study is the first to report increased ChREBP 
expression in patients with NASH. In addition, the 50% decreased 
ChREBP expression in livers of patients with severe insulin resistance (HOMA >4.8) reinforces the concept that ChREBP-mediated steatosis is not necessarily related to a high degree of insulin 
resistance. In our population, insulin resistance, as assessed by 
the HOMA index, was not correlated (positively or negatively) 
with steatosis (r2 = 0.03; P = 0.4). This differs from other studies 
that have shown a relationship between insulin resistance and 
the extent of steatosis. However, several findings indicate that 
this association is complex and sometimes absent due to alterations of some specific proteins, such as ATGL or adiponutrin 
(PNPLA3), or to insulin resistance at the receptor level (80). It 
is important to consider that the HOMA index is testing insulin resistance for the glucose pathway (i.e., in the fasting state, 
hepatic glucose production). In contrast, steatosis is indicative of 
the persistent effect of insulin on the lipogenic pathway (de novo 
lipogenesis) in the liver (81) and of adipose tissue resistance, leading to increased levels of NEFA and lipoprotein remnants being 
captured by the liver. In this setting, the absence of a positive 
relation between insulin resistance and steatosis could indicate 
the complexity of the relationships between insulin resistance 
and liver lipid accumulation. In addition, it has been recently 
suggested that the type of fatty acids that are stored in the liver 
could be more relevant than the degree of steatosis regarding the 
mechanisms of fatty liver injuries (5, 54). The absence of correlation between insulin resistance and steatosis does not preclude 
a possible relation between the level of hepatotoxic fatty acids 
and insulin resistance. Lastly, although it would have been highly 
relevant, we were not able to perform lipidomic analysis in this 
study, mostly because of methodological and ethical limitations 
to sampling human liver tissue.
By unraveling the contribution of lipogenesis via ChREBP to the 
development of hepatic steatosis in mice and in patients with NASH, 
our study shows that fatty acid composition is an important determinant of insulin sensitivity and, more importantly, that hepatic 
steatosis can occur independently of insulin resistance. Our results 
provide insights which we believe to be novel into the causal relationship between hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance and demonstrate that increasing the lipogenic pathway via ChREBP may protect 
against insulin resistance by raising beneficial lipid species. By combining experimental and human data, we believe that our study also 
provides original insight on the complex pathogenesis of NAFLD.
Methods
Animals and diets. Seven- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River and adapted to the environment for 2 weeks 
before study. All mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-hour-light/
12-hour-dark cycle in a temperature-controlled environment (the dark 
cycle going from 3:00 am until 3:00 pm). Mice had free access to water and 
standard CD (in terms of energy, 65% from carbohydrate, 11% from fat, 
and 24% from protein). For HFD studies, C57BL/6J mice (Charles River) 
were maintained on a HFD (EF R/M acc. D12492, Ssniff Spezialdiaten 
GmbH, modified upon personal request) for a total of 10 weeks, starting 
at 4 weeks of age. Modified HFD consisted of crude nutrients (fat 35% [SFA 
20%, MUFA 12%, cholesterol 3%] sugar/dextrin 22%) (in terms of metabolized energy, 60% from fat, 21% from carbohydrate and 19% from protein). 
Six weeks after the beginning of the HFD, mice were injected with 1 single 
dose of 5 × 109 pfu of GFP or ChREBP adenovirus (as described below) and 
maintained on HFD for another 4 weeks. Mice injected with a similar dose 
of GFP and maintained for 10 weeks on standard CD were used as controls. 
All studies were performed on 14-week-old mice, either fasted 18 hours or 
under fed conditions as stated in Table 1. For “fed” conditions, mice were

Antilipotoxic effect of ChREBP overexpression in mouse liver. Upon 
ChREBP overexpression in livers of mice fed a HFD, glycolysis and 
lipogenesis are stimulated, leading to the development of hepatic steatosis. ChREBP overexpression by stimulating SCD1 activity leads 
to a modification in lipid composition (namely a change in the monounsaturated [MUFA] to saturated [SFA] ratio) and dissociates hepatic 
steatosis from insulin resistance. Increased phosphorylation of Akt 
(Ser473 and Thr308) and of downstream substrates was measured 
in HFD-fed ChREBP mice, and glucose tolerance was improved. Our 
results provide insights into the causal relationship between hepatic 
steatosis and insulin resistance and demonstrate that increasing the 
lipogenic pathway may protect against insulin resistance by raising 
beneficial lipid species. CRTC2, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2; PPARGC1A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ

sacrificed between 9:00 and 10:00 am (during dark cycle). For “fasting” 
conditions, mice were fasted overnight (12 hours).
Generation of the ChREBP adenovirus construct. The full-length wild-type 
ChREBP-z isoform mutated on Ser196 and Thr666 (19) was subcloned 
into the shuttle vector pAd Track-CMV. Recombinant adenoviral constructs ChREBP and GFP recombinant adenovirus were produced in 
HEK293T cells and purified on cesium chloride gradients before use by 
the Laboratoire of Thérapie Génique.
Injection of the ChREBP adenovirus and in vivo insulin stimulation. Male mice 
were anesthetized with isoflurane before injection through the penis vein 
with 5 × 109 pfu of either GFP or ChREBP in a final volume of 200 μl of 
sterile NaCl 9%. Experiments and analysis were performed 4 weeks after 
the adenoviral injection (a single dose). For insulin signaling experiments, 
mice were fasted overnight and then injected with NaCl 9% or 1 unit of 
regular human insulin/kg (Actrapid Penfill, NovoNordisk) via the portal 
vein. Three minutes after injection of the insulin bolus, livers were removed 
and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests. Glucose tolerance tests were 
performed 4 weeks after adenoviral injections by glucose gavage (1 g d-glucose/kg body weight) after an overnight fast. Insulin tolerance tests were 
performed by intraperitoneal injection of human regular insulin (0.75 unit 
insulin/kg body weight; Actrapid Penfill, NovoNordisk) 5 hours after food 
removal. Pyruvate tolerance tests were performed by intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (monosodium salt, Boehringer Mannheim) (2 g/kg body 
weight) after an overnight fast. Blood glucose was determined using the 
One-Touch AccuChek Glucometer (Roche).
Analytical procedures. Serum concentrations of TG, NEFA, AST, and ALT 
were determined using an automated Monarch device (Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculté de Médecine Bichat, Paris, France). Serum insulin concentrations 
were determined using a rat insulin ELISA Assay Kit (Crystal Chem) using a 
mouse insulin standard. FGF21 concentrations were measured using the Rat/
Mouse FGF-21 ELISA Kit (EZRMFGF21-26K, Millipore). Liver G6P, glycogen 
concentrations, and pyruvate concentrations were determined as previously 
described (82). Liver TGs were measured with a colorimetric diagnostic kit 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Triglycerides FS, Diasys).
Staining techniques. For histology studies, livers were fixed in 4% neutral 
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Then, 7-μM sections were 
cut and stained with H&E. For the detection of neutral lipids, liver cryosections were stained using the Oil Red O technique (83) using 0.23% dye 
dissolved in 65% isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes.
Primary cultures of hepatocytes. Mouse hepatocytes were prepared as 
described previously (17) and cultured in the presence of 5 mM glucose 
and 0.48 mM albumin-bound PALM (C16:0) at a fatty acid/albumin ratio 
of 4:1 for 24 hours or 0.48 mM albumin-bound PALM/oletate (0.3 mM 
each) (OLE/PALM). The source of albumin used was fatty acid–free bovine 
serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 hours in these different conditions, hepatocytes were infected with 3 pfu per cell of GFP, ChREBP, SCD1, 
or shSCD1 (GeneCust) for 24 hours. After the adenofection period, insulin (1 nM) was added to the culture medium for times ranging from 0 to 
5 minutes. The SCD1 inhibitor (SCD1inhib) (ref no. A939572, QSChem) 
(36) was used for 24 hours at a final concentration of 10 nM.
Measurement of glucose production in primary hepatocytes. After specific adenofection (GFP or ChREBP), hepatocytes were incubated with cell culture 
medium containing no glucose (G0) but containing lactate and pyruvate 
substrates with BSA or PALM (0.48 mM) plus or minus insulin (100 nM) 
for 24 hours. Hepatic glucose production was measured after PCA neutralization as previously described (84).
Lipid analysis. Lipid assays were performed by the lipidomic facility (Bio-Medical Federative Research Institute of Toulouse, INSERM, Plateforme MetaToul). Briefly, after homogenization of tissue samples in methanol/5 mM 
EGTA (2:1 v/v), lipids corresponding to an equivalent of 1 mg of tissue 
were extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (2.5:2.5:2.1, v/v/v), in the 
presence of internal standards: 1,3-dimyristine (for DAG) and glyceryl 
triheptadecanoate (for TG). Chloroform phases were evaporated to dryness. Neutral lipids were purified over an SPE column (Macherey Nagel 
glass Chromabond pure silice, 200 mg): after washing cartridge with 2 ml 
chloroform, lipid extract was applied on the cartridge in 20 μl chloroform, and neutral lipid were eluted with chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v; 
2 ml). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 20 μl 
ethyl acetate. A sample (1 μl) of the lipid extract was analyzed by gas-liquid 
chromatography on a FOCUS Thermo Electron system, using Zebron-1 
(Phenomenex) fused silica capillary columns (5-m × 0.32-mm inside 
diameter [i.d.], 0.50-μm film thickness) (85). Oven temperature was programmed from 200°C to 350°C at a rate of 5°C per minute, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (7.25 psi). The injector and the detector were at 
315°C and 345°C, respectively.
To measure ceramide and sphingomyelin, total lipids corresponding to 
2 mg of tissue were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer 
in chloroform/methanol/water (2.5:2.5:2.1, v/v/v) in the presence of the 
internal standards ceramide NC15 (2 μg, prepared according to ref. 86); 
the dried lipid extract was submitted to a mild alkaline treatment in 
methanolic NaOH 0.6 N (1 ml) and then to silylation in 50 μl BSTFA 
(1%TMSCl)/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) overnight at room temperature. Sample 
(5 μl) was directly analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (4890 Hewlett 
Packard system, using a RESTEK RTX-50 fused silica capillary columns, 
30-m × 0.32-mm i.d., 0.1-μm film thickness). Oven temperature was programmed from 195°C to 310°C (12 minutes) at a rate of 3.5°C per minute, 
and the carrier gas was hydrogen (7.25 psi). The injector and the detector 
were at 310°C and 340°C, respectively.
To measure total hepatic fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) molecular species, lipids corresponding to an equivalent of 1 mg of liver were extracted in 
the presence of glyceryl triheptadecanoate (0.5 μg) as an internal standard. 
The lipid extract was transmethylated with 1 ml of BF3 in methanol (14% 
solution; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml of hexane for 60 minutes at 100°C and 
evaporated to dryness, and the FAMEs were extracted with hexane/water 
(2:1). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 50 μl 
ethyl acetate. A sample (1 μl) of total FAME was analyzed by gas-liquid 
chromatography (Clarus 600 Perkin Elmer system, with Famewax RESTEK 
fused silica capillary columns, 30-m × 0.32-mm i.d., 0.25-μm film thickness). Oven temperature was programmed from 110°C to 220°C at a rate 
of 2°C per minute, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (7.25 psi). The injector 
and the detector were at 225°C and 245°C, respectively.
To measure hepatocyte fatty acid composition, cells were washed twice 
with ice-cold PBS and scraped into PBS. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and sonicated. Cellular lipids were extracted 
with hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v) prior to transmethylation with 1 ml 
of BF3 in methanol (14% solution; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml of hexane for 
60 minutes at 100°C. FAMEs were then extracted with hexane and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. To assess the effect of SCD1 inhibitor, we estimated the Δ9-desaturation index as the abundance of SCD1 
products (oleic and palmitoleic acids) relative to both SCD1 products and 
substrates (palmitic and stearic acids).
Isolation of total mRNA and analysis by qRT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was 
extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 500 ng of RNA were reverse 
transcribed. qRT-PCR analysis was performed with a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) and SYBR green detection of amplified products. Primers for Gck, Pklr, Acaca, Fasn, Scd1, GPAT, Pck1, ChREBP, SREBP-1c
(17, 27), LXR (23), Pparg (87), and Fgf21 (33) were previously described.

antisense 5′-AGACGAGCAGTGGCTCAAT); Il6 (sense 5′-GTTCTCTGGGAAATCGTGGA; antisense 5′-TGTACTCCAAGCTATGG); chop (sense 
5′-AAGGAGAAGGAGCAGGAGAAC; antisense 5′-GGTACACTTCCGGAGAGACAG). The relative quantification for a given gene was corrected 
to the cyclophilin mRNA values.
Human CHREBP expression was analyzed in human liver frozen tissues from 25 patients with histologically proven NASH. Liver mRNA 
was extracted in TRIzol solution, followed by an RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen). 
cDNAs were generated from 1 μg RNA using Moloney murine leukemia 
virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) and pd(N)6 primers (Amersham Biosystems). Different amounts of calibrated mRNA (i.e., 
1.25 pg to 1.25 × 105 pg) (Applied Biosystems) were submitted to RT with 
the MMLV RT and pd(N)6 primers and, subsequently, used in real-time 
PCR for standardization of HPRT transcripts. Briefly, the cDNA prepared 
from 200 ng RNA was added to 50 μl PCR buffer with 20 pmoles of each 
forward and reverse primers. The sequences of primers are as follows: 
hCHREBP, forward, 5′-TTTTGACCAGATGCGAGACA-3′; hCHREBP, 
reverse, 5′-TGGCGTAGGGAGTTCAGG-3′. qRT-PCR was performed using 
the SYBR green detection PCR Core Reagents Kit. Expression of target 
genes was achieved by the ΔΔCt method (88).
Preparation of membrane and nuclear extracts. Liver nuclear and cytoplasmic 
extracts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology) as previously described (17). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay.
Immunoblots analysis. Proteins (40 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. ChREBP protein was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals), 
and SREBP-1c was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (SREBP-1 
Ab-1; NeoMarkers, Interchim). Rabbit polyclonal ACACA, SCD1, NF-κB 
p65 and phospho–NF-κB p65 (Ser536), caspase-3, and PKCε antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Insulin Rβ (C-19) was a rabbit 
polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the C terminus 
of insulin Rβ of human origin (IR-sc711; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). 
Rabbit polyclonal for total Akt, total GSK3β, phospho-Akt (Ser473 and 
Thr308), phospho-GSK3β (Ser9), Akt substrates, and PCK1 antibodies were 
purchased from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal mouse β actin (clone AC-74; 
Sigma-Aldrich) and lamin A/C (Cell Signaling) antibodies were used as 
loading controls. A polyclonal GFP antibody from Clontech was used. The 
FASN antibody was a gift from I. Dugail (Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France). The CRTC2 antibody was used as previously described 
(89). Autoradiograms of Western blots were scanned and quantified using 
an image processor program (Chemi Genius2 scan, SYNGENE).
Study population. Twenty-five patients with histologically proven NASH 
who were enrolled in the FLIRT trial, a randomized placebo-controlled 
fatty liver improvement with rosiglitazone therapy trial, were analyzed (48). 
The histologic diagnosis of NASH was defined as steatosis of more than 
20% and the presence of either hepatocyte ballooning or intralobular hepatocyte necrosis. None of the patients had alcohol consumption of more 
than 20 g per day, hepatotoxic drugs, or treatment with insulin for diabetes or with ursodeoxycholic acid. The following diseases were excluded for 
each patient: cardiac insufficiency, neoplastic disease, current or past treatment with drugs that can induce steatohepatitis, uncompensated cirrhosis, 
organ transplantation, B and C viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary obstruction, 
hemochromatosis, and Wilson’s disease.
Laboratory investigation. After a 12-hour overnight fast, venous blood 
samples were drawn to determine levels of AST, ALT, γ-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, glucose, cholesterol, TG, and insulin. 
Results were obtained from a centralized laboratory. Insulin resistance was 
assessed by using the HOMA index as follows: fasting insulin (mU/l) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (90).
Histological investigation. Liver samples were paraffin embedded and stained 
with H&E safran and red sirius. Steatosis was semiquantitatively assessed 
as both the percentage of hepatocytes involved within a lobule (0%–100%, 
steatosis score) and by using a 4-grade classification modified from Kleiner et al. (91): 0, absent; 1, <5%; 2, 5%–33%; 3, 33%–66%; 4, >66%. Staging 
and grading were performed according to Brunt et al. (92): F0, absence of 
any fibrosis; F1, isolated perisinusoidal or portal/periportal fibrosis; F2, 
perisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosis; F3, bridging fibrosis; F4, 
cirrhosis. The NAFLD activity score (NAS) was calculated according to 
Kleiner et al. (91). The score is defined as the sum of the scores for steatosis 
(0, <5%; 1, 5%–33%; 2, 33%–66%; 3, >66%), lobular inflammation (0, none; 
1, <2 foci/×200 magnification field; 2, 2–4 foci/×200 magnification field; 
3, >4 foci/× 200 magnification field), and ballooning (0, none; 1, few; 
2, many). Thus, this score ranges from 0 to 8. Fibrosis is not included in 
this score, as the separation of fibrosis from other features of activity is an 
accepted paradigm for staging and grading NASH (92). According to this 
classification, NASH is defined by a NAS of 5 or more.
Statistics. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA, t test, or nonparametric Wilcoxon test in case of small groups. All data are presented as 
mean ± SEM, with a statistically significant difference defined as a P < 0.05.
Study approval. All procedures were carried out according to the French 
guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. All animal studies 
were approved by the Direction Départementale des Services Vétérinaires 
de Paris and by the Mouse Facility Core laboratory (Institut Cochin, Inserm 
U1016, Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France). All patients gave written 
informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.
