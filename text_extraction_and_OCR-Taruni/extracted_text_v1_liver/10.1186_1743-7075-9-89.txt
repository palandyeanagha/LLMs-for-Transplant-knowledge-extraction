Fructose metabolism in humans – what isotopic
tracer studies tell us
Sam Z Sun* and Mark W Empie
Abstract
Fructose consumption and its implications on public health are currently under study. This work reviewed the
metabolic fate of dietary fructose based on isotope tracer studies in humans. The mean oxidation rate of dietary
fructose was 45.0% ± 10.7 (mean ± SD) in non-exercising subjects within 3–6 hours and 45.8% ± 7.3 in exercising
subjects within 2–3 hours. When fructose was ingested together with glucose, the mean oxidation rate of the
mixed sugars increased to 66.0% ± 8.2 in exercising subjects. The mean conversion rate from fructose to glucose
was 41% ± 10.5 (mean ± SD) in 3–6 hours after ingestion. The conversion amount from fructose to glycogen
remains to be further clarified. A small percentage of ingested fructose (<1%) appears to be directly converted to
plasma TG. However, hyperlipidemic effects of larger amounts of fructose consumption are observed in studies
using infused labeled acetate to quantify longer term de novo lipogenesis. While the mechanisms for the
hyperlipidemic effect remain controversial, energy source shifting and lipid sparing may play a role in the effect, in
addition to de novo lipogenesis. Finally, approximately a quarter of ingested fructose can be converted into lactate
within a few of hours. The reviewed data provides a profile of how dietary fructose is utilized in humans.

Introduction
Fructose has been a part of the human diet for many
thousands of years, and it is found in highest concentrations in fruits and to a lesser degree in vegetables. Cane,
beet, and corn sugars are produced industrially, and
their use results in significant quantities of added sugars
entering the diet, about half of which is fructose [1].
Cane and beet sugars are comprised of the disaccharide
sucrose (glucose bonded to fructose) and are commonly
called table sugar or simple sugar. Corn sugars come
from corn starch, and mainly consist of high fructose
corn syrup 55 (HFCS 55; 55% fructose-41% glucose),
HFCS 42 (42% fructose-52% glucose), and corn syrup
(glucose and oligoglucose with trace amounts of fructose). During the last several decades, the prevalence of
obesity and metabolic syndrome has risen dramatically
on a global basis, but more so in the U.S. population.
Because the prevalence is chronologically and statistically correlated with the increase of added sugar intakes,
particularly HFCS in the U.S. (HFCS is not consumed
significantly outside the U.S.), some have proposed the
intake of HFCS or fructose as a free monosaccharide
may be a cause of various adverse health consequences
[2]. Conventional clinical trials and ecological studies
have been conducted to assess the hypotheses, but not
all results are found to be supportive. Conventional
studies often cannot reveal details of interconnecting
metabolic pathways when testing fructose or fructosecontaining sugars, but they also cannot clearly distinguish a mechanistic cause associated with an observed
physiological consequence linked to the sugar consumed. This is because the ordinary diet contains multiple forms of saccharides which are inter-convertible in
the body and share many steps of the carbohydrate metabolism pathways.
Over the last decade, a series of controversies have
arisen regarding fructose consumption. In 2004, a commentary was written hypothesizing that the “high” fructose content in HFCS was the cause of the obesity rise
in America [3]. This was based on the association of the
obesity prevalence rise with the replacement of cane and
beet sugar by HFCS, even though the fructose content

of these two sweetener sources is essentially the same.
Later, several dietary studies using calorically high doses
of fructose were published to investigate fructose modulation of leptin hormone status, with a suggestion that
chronic changes in this hormone level could lead to
weight gain [4,5]. However, other studies and evidence
based reviews do not always support these findings
[6-13]. Recently, Welsh et al. [14] reported that the intake of added sugar has significantly decreased between
1999 and 2008 while the obesity prevalence has continued to rise. The current view is that obesity is a matter
of energy balance [15,16]. Next, the fructose moiety in
sugars was hypothesized to cause high serum uric acid
which could lead to the development of Type-2 diabetes
[17]. There is currently no direct proof for a cause and
effect relation of urate with diabetes, and NHANES
data suggests no relation of serum urate with fructose
intake at ordinary dietary consumption levels [18].
Then, another hypothesis has been raised that dietary
fructose may potentially lead to Non Alcoholic Fatty
Liver Disease (NAFLD) and augmented de-novo triglyceride synthesis, based on an analysis of hormone
regulated lipid pathways in the liver [19,20]. It is known
that high dietary levels of fructose can increase serum
triglycerides. However, all the factors linked to the development of fatty liver disease are not well understood
and can include, insulin resistance, inflammation, fat redeposition, abnormalities in control of reactive oxygen
species [21] and uncoupling proteins in mitochondria
[22]. NAFLD is currently an important and actively
researched field relative to dietary sugar intakes.
Additionally, it is important to understand the practical significance of testing an effect from a single sugar
using an unrepresentative dose compared to the true
population sugar intake, a question which is currently
under debate [23-26]. In many of the intervention studies involved with studying the various hypotheses mentioned above, very high doses of sugars over short term
were often applied, the study designs were more similar
to toxicological studies, and the studies were only able
to draw associative conclusions between applied dose
and observed health-related outcomes in the subjects
studied. The observed biological changes, although statistically significant by a P-value ruling, were often only

fluctuations within normal ranges. These studies rarely
measured actual development of disease or the intermediate metabolites characterizing mechanism-based
reactions. To begin to prove true effect of a diet component, it is useful to study the component disposal
through the common central pathways at the molecular
level. These studies are facilitated and detailed by the
use of isotope tracer labeled precursors, and this concept
is the stimulus for this review.
The questions raised by the above hypotheses reach
into the broader metabolome and fluxome. Our understanding of the metabolism of glucose and fructose as
separate sugars is founded upon many years of study,
and detailed anabolic and catabolic pathways are known
[27]. Recently, the extended metabolism of glucose and
fructose has been reviewed by Tappy and Le [28]. Glucose and fructose carbons are utilized through the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, lactate production (Cori cycle), pentose phosphate shunt, and lipid synthesis pathways in
various physiological compartments to provide substrates for glycogen homeostasis, amino acids, other
sugars, fats and energy (e.g. ATP). Glucose and fructose
enter the metabolic pathways differently (Figure 1), with
glucose being converted to 1,6-diphosphorylated fructose before being cleaved into the three carbon metabolic intermediates, dihydroxy acetone phosphate and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Absorbed fructose is only
mono-phosphorylated before being cleaved into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxy acetone phosphate, which is the
common intermediate with the glucose pathway. Glucose utilization can be regulated before cleavage,
whereas fructose is less regulated. This initial difference
has prompted some to hypothesize that, because fructose cleavage by-passes key feedback regulatory steps in
the glucose metabolic pathway, this bypass may lead to
increases of fatty acid synthesis, which may contribute
to causes of obesity [4]. This hypothesis relies on a simplified metabolic pathway analysis and on studies using
pure fructose in comparison to pure glucose, a situation
which rarely occurs in the American diet [29,30].
In nature, fructose commonly occurs together with
glucose, and composition values for some foods have
been tabulated by the USDA on its website: http://www.
nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/. The metabolism of
food derived sucrose, fruit sugars, honey, and high fructose corn syrup, major sources of fructose and glucose
in the diet, are currently under study, and the biological
effects resulting from the use of experimentally formulated mixtures of glucose and fructose are relevant to
our understanding. The use of mixed sugars are more
metabolically predictive of dietary consequences than
that from single monosaccharides studied individually,
as metabolism of each type of sugar is not independent
from the other (discussed below). Metabolic interactions
between glucose and fructose significantly impact general sugar metabolism.
Owing to the complexity of fructose and glucose metabolism, conventional feeding study approaches are
usually less informative than isotope tracer studies for
obtaining a clear picture of mechanisms for utilization
of dietary fructose or glucose. It is known that carbon
moieties in fructose and glucose can be inter-converted
in the liver [31], and thus studying the disposal and
metabolic effects of these dietary sugars with respect to
one another is most definitively conducted using
isotope-labeled sugars as tracers. A number of these isotopic tracer studies exist, and many are found in the literature dated before the year 2000. Although all
pathways have not been completely studied for fructose
disposal and metabolism under different physiological
conditions, a significant number of reports on fructose
isotope tracer studies are published. In this work, we
have reviewed fructose disposal and metabolism in
humans based on isotope tracer studies to better understand from a molecular stand point fructose oxidation,
fructose conversion into glucose, fructose conversion
into lipids, and fructose conversion into lactate.
Method
Pubmed and Scopus websites were searched using 2 or
more key word combinations of fructose, glucose, sucrose, tracer, 13C, 14C, and isotope with limitation of
using human studies. When reviewing the metabolic fate
of dietary fructose (including oxidation, glucose conversion, glycogen synthesis, lipid conversion and lactate
production), the data were obtained from publications
that met the following criteria: adult subjects, unbound
or bound fructose studied, isotope-tracer used, in English, and with metabolic-related study purposes. In total,
34 papers met the criteria. Other conditions related to
study design were not used as exclusion criteria, such as
subject fasting status, ways of fructose administration,
and sample size. Many of the studies on fructose oxidation were conducted by researchers interested in exercise and athletic performance enhancement. In some
studies, fructose ingestions were combined with glucose
or with other nutrient intravenous infusion. Dose levels
of fructose and administration methods (bolus or several
small portions) also varied between studies. As a result,
there is significant heterogeneity between studies and
the protocol, and quality among the tracer studies cited
in this review may not be similar. The expired CO2 recovery coefficients, correction factors (k factor) for the
collection loss of expired CO2, were not identical in the
studies investigating fructose oxidation. This may account for some of the observed variations in oxidation
rates of ingested fructose [32].

The following sections will review what tracer studies
tell us about the disposal and metabolism of dietary fructose as a single sugar or as a mixture with glucose, either
bound or free. In this way, the origins and fate of specific
carbons in these sugars may be determined in relation to
their partition among metabolic pathways and how the
presence of one sugar influences the metabolism of the
other. In two sections, studies are included which use
non-labeled fructose together with labeled pathway compounds to assess the impact of ingested fructose on metabolites or pool intermediates leading to alterations in
relevant end points, such as glucose production or de
novo lipogenesis. In this way, fructose carbons themselves
are not followed, but broader anabolic responses affected
by the fructose load can be measured. This isotopic
method makes use of Mass Isotopomer Distribution Analysis (MIDA), a technique reviewed by Hellerstein and
Neese (1999) [33]. Although these studies investigate a
number of other important physiological parameters, we
report here only the results which are directly measured
by the tracer itself.
Fructose absorption
To place the metabolism of labeled sugars in context, it
is helpful to briefly discuss what is known about the uptake of fructose, glucose and sucrose from the gut, interdependencies, and entry into the circulation. These
considerations should be taken into account when
designing studies. A number of the studies discussed in
this section do not use tracer labeled sugars, but are
included to provide a comprehensive description. The
absorption rate of fructose alone from the small intestine
is slower than that of glucose. This is partly due to the
differences in the absorption process between the two
monosaccharides. Glucose is absorbed from the intestine
into the plasma via more than one active glucose cotransporter protein. SGLT1 transports glucose from the
intestinal lumen through the apical membrane into the
intestinal epithelial cells. Exit from the epithelial cells
through the basolateral membrane to the blood is facilitated by GLUT2. Fructose is absorbed at a slower rate
from the lower part of duodenum and jejunum both
passively and actively by the brush-border membrane
transporter 5 (GLUT-5) and transported into blood also
by GLUT2 [34,35]. GLUT transporters are primarily
made up of 13 multiple homologous proteins (GLUT 1–
12 and 14) and they are located throughout the body
often exhibiting tissue specificities [36]. The capacity for
fructose absorption in humans is not completely clear,
but early studies suggested that fructose absorption is
quite efficient, though it is less efficient than that of glucose or sucrose [34]. The slower absorption and prolonged contact time with the luminal intestinal wall
would be expected to result in the stimulation of
regulatory and satiety signals and release of hormones
from enteroendocrine cells [37,38].
When fructose is consumed as the sole carbohydrate
source, it can be incompletely absorbed, and as a result,
produces a hyperosmolar environment in the intestine.
A high concentration of solute within the gut lumen
draws fluid into the intestine which can produce feelings
of malaise, stomachache or diarrhea [39], and results in
decreased food intake. However, when glucose is also
present, malabsorption is significantly attenuated [40].
Riby et al. [34] compiled data from five studies comparing glucose, fructose and mixtures of the two for degree
of absorption, by measurement of breath hydrogen as an
indicator of malabsorption. Pure fructose alone produced dose-dependent evidence of malabsorption starting from12 gram ingestion loads, while glucose and
sucrose individually produced no intolerance up to 50
gram ingestion loads. Incremental amounts of added free
glucose to a 50 gram fructose load dose-dependently
attenuated malabsorption symptoms, and at the equimolar mixture of the two (up to 100 grams total sugars), no
malabsorption was observed. Thus, how studies are
designed to deliver the various sugars can have an impact on sugar uptake and appearance in the blood.
Sucrose is a valid comparison for glucose-fructose
mixtures, as the disaccharide is cleaved by the enzyme
sucrase into the mono sugars before being absorbed into
the circulation. Comparison of sucrose absorption rates
in 32 normal subjects with an equivalent amount of
monosaccharide mixture containing glucose and fructose, infused intralumenally to avoid gastric hydrolysis,
resulted in the similar absorption rates for each glucose
and fructose component of the test [41]. In another
study, type-2 diabetic patients were fed sucrose or HFCS
with a background diet, resulting in plasma glucose
AUC’s not being different between sucrose and the
HFCS, nor were mean plasma insulin values [42]. It was
also shown that mucosal-to-serosal glucose flux was
similar between sucrose and glucose + fructose mixture
solution, but rates depended on sucrase and sodiumdependent glucose transport in an in vitro study [43].
Other comparison studies in normal men and women
[44] and in diabetics [45,46] produced no differences in
intestinal uptake between sucrose and honey (a glucosefructose mixture). Thus, the body appears to handle oral
free glucose-fructose mixtures or HFCS similarly as sucrose and that hydrolysis of sucrose does not appear to
be rate limiting for uptake.
Once absorbed, glucose is delivered to the liver then
to peripheral organs for utilization, and its entrance into
muscle and fat cells is insulin dependent. Fructose is primarily delivered to and metabolized in the liver for energy and for two and three carbon precursor production
without dependence on insulin. Bolus or divided doses
Sun and Empie Nutrition & Metabolism 2012, 9:89 Page 4 of 15
http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/9/1/89

of 50–150 g fructose produce plasma concentrations of
3–11 mg/dl of this sugar [47-52], while glucose can
spike upwards of 150 mg/dl and more. Although little
dietary fructose appears in the circulation, it can influence plasma glucose concentrations via sugar interconversion. In man, studies indicate fructose to glucose
conversion may occur to a highly significant degree
(reviewed below) and that this conversion occurs via the
3-carbon intermediate pathways. The extent of interconversion may be species dependent.
Key points: 1) Fructose is readily absorbed and its absorption is facilitated by the presence of co-ingested glucose. Sucrose, honey, 50:50 glucose-fructose mixtures and
HFCS all appear to be similarly absorbed. 2) Fructose itself
is retained by the liver, while glucose is mainly released
into the circulation and utilized peripherally. And, 3)
Plasma levels of fructose are an order of magnitude
(10–50 folds) lower than circulating glucose, and fructose elicits only a modest insulin response. This lower
glucose and insulin response by the body to fructose intake has been considered desirable for diabetic diets.
Fructose and glucose metabolic flux
Fructose and glucose metabolic flux is briefly described
in Figure 1. The important point of distinction between
glucose and fructose metabolism resides in two areas.
Absorbed fructose is extracted by, held, and processed
in the liver, with little fructose circulating in the blood
stream or delivered to peripheral tissues. Absorbed glucose or that produced in the liver from fructose or other
precursors is either metabolized in the liver or exported
to the blood stream and further to extrahepatic tissues.
Most absorbed fructose is cleaved in the liver into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxy acetone phosphate, and these
trioses further go to glycerol phosphate and pyruvate
metabolic pathways, respectively. With both fructose
and glucose, lactate conversion plays an important role
in distributing carbohydrate potential energy between
gluconeogenesis and acetyl CoA, with entry into the
TCA cycle or use in lipid synthesis (Figure 1) [53,54].
Lactate discharge is also a means for fructose carbons to
escape the liver and be transported to peripheral tissues.
Fructose cleavage to glyceraldehyde can result in the
production of glycerol via reduction. It was observed
that blood glycerol concentration increased after fructose ingestion in exercise subjects [55,56]. The noted
glycerol increases after fructose ingestion are either
greater or similar compared with the values after glucose
ingestion, and the produced glycerol can be oxidized for
energy. However, the metabolic balance between glycerol
produced from fructose and central pathway trioses has
not been clearly determined.
Given the complexity and interdependencies of energy
metabolism and biochemical synthesis arising from
sugars, consideration of the flux of carbons among these
pathways is critical to understanding the health consequences of consuming these nutrients. Single sugar distribution and fluxes between pathways are not easily
studied without isotopic labels. Classically, a limited
number of metabolites are characterized in a study and
some disposal points can be missed. More recently, a
computational technique is being employed utilizing.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or mass spectral
analyses of the 13C isotopomer distribution of metabolites, following administration of labeled precursors.
These precursors may be uniformly labeled compounds
or labeled at specific carbons, depending on the question
to be answered. An empirical metabolic flux analysis
profile is generated which can be mathematically modeled without being constrained by physical chemistry
rigor, as reviewed by Selivanoc and Lee [57,58]. This
technique allows one to model metabolite fluxes which
may not be well characterized or understood from direct
enzymatic or physical chemistry data. A second method
is under development to mathematically model general
metabolism and interdependencies of pathways using
known thermodynamic free energy and kinetic constant
parameters for each reaction in the pathway sequences
[59], but there is currently insufficient data to apply to
fructose metabolism questions.
Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and
likely the combination of both is needed for optimal predictive power. In the future, with these tools one should
be able to predict outcomes from sugars supply as a
function of the organism’s energy (ATP) status, oxidation/reduction potential (NADH/NADPH) and nutrient
dependent cofactors. Metabolic differences among compartments and their interactions as a whole should be
included. Experimentation should account for metabolome interactions, and study results should be interpreted carefully with respect to the experimental
conditions employed.
Key points: 1) Fructose is observed to enter all the
pathways of disposal as found for glucose glycolysis and
the TCA cycle. 2) Three carbon intermediates provide a
means for fructose to be released from the liver and to
be utilized peripherally, which suggests that physiological effects observed should be integrated with the
co-effect and metabolic fluxes arising from all sugars
using these pathways.
Metabolic fate of dietary fructose
The following reviews the data as presented in the
papers. As depicted in Figure 1, the interdependence of
metabolic pathways of fructose and glucose can influence the flow of metabolites and their temporal appearance as other compounds. Thus, in discussing the
disposal of fructose carbons, e.g. through oxidation, one

cannot accurately distinguish if the labeled CO2 arose
directly from the fructose itself, or from fructose which
had undergone conversion to neoformed glucose, neoformed lactate, or other neoformed compounds. Where
the conversions occur, these metabolites can be readily
transported out of the liver to other tissues, altering the
temporal appearance of metabolites. Further complicating the analysis, some studies used fructose labeled with
13C at different positions of its carbon backbone, uniformly labeled fructose, or 13C naturally enriched fructose. The different labeling may also influence the
appearance of the isotope tracer in various metabolites.
Using uniformly labeled fructose would limit the potential complications from different labeling positions on
isotope tracer appearance in its metabolites. It should
also be noted that most of the tracer studies described
in the following sections are short-term dietary studies
(monitored periods shorter than 8 hours) and may not
reflect longer term effects of fructose, such as on de
novo lipogenesis, VLDL TG production, or other metabolic specificities.
Fructose oxidation
Multiple studies have been conducted to observe how
much fructose and other sugars can be oxidized following ingestion. Table 1 summarizes fructose and other
sugar oxidation data reported from tracer studies in
humans under different experimental designs. In all, 19
relevant studies were found which met the inclusion criteria of this review. The first 4 studies cited in Table 1
used resting subjects with fructose ingestion levels from
0.5-1.0 g/kg body weight (bw). Within the study monitoring periods, the ingested fructose was oxidized from
30.5% to 59%. The study by Chong and colleagues [48]
showed fructose was oxidized faster than glucose (30.5%
vs 24.5%). This effect may be due to less regulation of
phosphorylation for fructose or to a wider tissue distribution of glucose. Oxidation rates increase as the dose
increases but would be attenuated by its rate of absorption when intake amounts are large. Delarue et al. [49]
indicated when the fructose administration dose
increased from 0.5 to 1 g/kg bw, the oxidation amount
of fructose correspondingly increased, such that a similar percent of the given fructose dosage was oxidized
(56% and 59%, respectively). However, there is a difference in oxidation rates between normal and diabetic
subjects, in that normal subjects could more efficiently
oxidize fructose than type-2 diabetics (38.5% vs 31.3% of
given dosage) [52].
The other studies in the Table 1 were conducted under
conditions of exercise where workloads corresponded to
50-75% of max VO2 uptake. The oxidized amounts of
ingested fructose ranged from 37.5% to 62.0%. Except in
one study [60] which showed that fructose and glucose
had similar oxidation rates (38.8% and 40.5%, respectively), the other studies all observed that glucose was
oxidized faster than fructose under the exercise conditions [47,50,55,56,61-65]. A very interesting phenomenon noted is that when fructose and glucose are
ingested together (including fructose-containing sucrose), the oxidation rates of the mixed sugars were faster than that of either one of them ingested alone at the
same dosage. Adopo et al. reported that, given 100 g
fructose, glucose, or fructose + glucose, 73.6% of the
mixed sugars were oxidized while the data of fructose
and glucose were 43.8% and 48.1% as ingested separately
[61]. The series of studies by Jentjens and colleagues
[66-69] also reported that fructose plus glucose or sucrose plus glucose consumed together were oxidized faster than glucose alone.
A summary of the sugar oxidation data is shown in
Figure 2. The data of obese or diabetic subjects are not
included in this figure. In non-exercise subjects, the
mean of the oxidized fructose amount was 45.0% ± 10.7
(mean ± SD, range 30.5-59%) of ingested dose within a
period of 3–6 hours. Under exercise conditions, this
mean was 45.8% ± 7.3 (mean ± SD, range 37.5-62%)
within 2–3 hours. When fructose and glucose are
ingested in combination, either as fructose plus glucose,
as sucrose, or as sucrose plus one of the 2 mono-sugars,
the mean oxidized amount of the mixed sugars increased
to 66.0% ± 8.2 (mean ± SD, range 52.2-73.6%). The oxidation data of glucose alone is 58.7% ± 12.9 (mean ± SD,
range 37.1-81.0%).
Key points: 1) A significant amount of ingested fructose is oxidized by the body to produce energy. 2) Under
resting conditions, fructose may be preferentially or
similarly utilized to produce energy as glucose, and
under exercise, glucose appeared to be more preferentially used to produce energy by the body. 3) When fructose and glucose are ingested together, the mixed sugars
will be oxidized significantly faster than either one of the
sugars ingested alone. And, 4) Fructose metabolism
could be very different between normal and obese/
diabetic subjects. A potential consideration with these
oxidation studies is that with shorter time frames of
measurement or incomplete oxidation and with only
partial labeling, position of the isotope label can influence the rate of appearance of the isotope in the exhaled
carbon dioxide (CO2). Temporal isotope appearance in
CO2 can be altered if some of the fructose carbons are
not completely oxidized in the time frame of measurement due to diversion to non-oxidative pathways.
Fructose-glucose conversion
The disposal pathway for fructose is not solely by direct
oxidation, as some absorbed fructose will be converted
to glucose. A number of studies have determined the

extent of the conversion, which can only be clearly done
using tracers. Table 2 tabulates the data from various
studies with different experimental conditions. Tran and
colleagues [70] studied the conversion of fructose to glucose as compared between men and women. After a 3
times ingestion of a fructose-containing beverage
(3x0.3 g/kg bw), 37.4% of the fructose was converted to
glucose in men during 6 hours. This value is significantly
higher than the conversion rate of 28.9% observed in
women. Similarly, using an equal fructose dosage,
Paquot et al. [52] noted the conversion percent from
fructose to glucose was 36.4% in 8 normal subjects
(4 M + 4 F), which is comparable with Tran’s data. However, the conversion proportion appeared to be lower in
obese and diabetic subjects (29.5% and 30.2%, respectively). In a dosing study monitored over a period of
6 hours, using 0.5 and 1 gram/kg bw, the conversion
from fructose to glucose was reported to be 54% and
50.7% of given dosages, respectively [49]. Surmely et al.
[71] infused fructose at 3 mg/kg bw per minute for the
first 3 hours, followed by doubling the infusion dosage
for the next 3 hours. It was noted that the subsequent
higher infusion dose level somewhat slowed the fructose
conversion percentage, 22% and 28% for high and low
dose levels respectively. Under exercise conditions,
Lecoultre et al. [51] reported that 29% of ingested fructose (96 g) is converted to glucose when a steady state of
carbohydrate flux was reached (1.7-2 hrs from the beginning of study). With repeated administration to achieve
a high dose level and under exercise, Jandrian et al. [50]
reported that 55-60% of circulating glucose comes from
fructose conversion during the latter half of the monitoring period. This data is similar to that observed by
Delarue et al. [49] who reported the amount of glucose
synthesized from fructose was 57% of overall glucose appearance in the circulation after an ingestion of fructose
at dosage of 1 g/kg bw, while the subjects were not
under exercise. These data suggest that 41% ±10.5
(mean ± SD, range 29-54%) of fructose can be converted
to glucose within 2–6 hours after ingestion in normal
non-exercise subjects. This conversion may be lower in
women compared to men, and obese and diabetic subjects may also have lower conversion capability.
For the conversion from dietary fructose to glycogen,
data are very limited. Nilsson et al. [72] reported that a
significantly higher amount of glycogen was determined
in the liver (274.6 mmol glycosyl unit per kg wet tissue)
after fructose infusion than that (76.2 mmol glycosyl
unit) after glucose infusion; and no difference of glycogen increase in muscle was noted (23.0 and 24.4 mmol
glycosyl units per kg after fructose and glucose infusions, respectively). Another fructose infusion study
(non-exercise) by Dirlewanger et al. [73] noted that fructose stimulates total glucose output, glucose cycling and
intrahepatic UDP galactose turnover, which was used as
a marker for increased glycogen synthesis. Blom and colleagues [74] reported that dietary fructose could be
about half as efficient as glucose or sucrose to replenish

noted data variations between studies could be due to the
differences of sugar dosages, tracer labeling forms, sugar
administration methods, subject characteristics, and/or measurement
errors. Also, the produced CO2 from labeled sugar oxidation can
arise directly from sugar molecules themselves, or other compounds
converted from the sugars, such as glucose, lactate, or fatty acid
from fructose.

muscle glycogen after exercise. In that study, healthy
young subjects exhaustively exercised on bicycle ergometers, and ingested 0.7 g/kg bw of fructose, glucose,
or sucrose divided in 3 doses. The rates of glycogen synthesis in muscle corresponding to each sugar treatment
were observed as 0.32, 0.58, and 0.62 mmol/kg per hour,
respectively. The data indicate that energy status plays a
role in how the body handles fructose distribution and
conversion to glycogen. A more recent study reported
that a part of dietary fructose was converted to glycogen
based on surge of blood 13C-glucose concentration following a glucagon administration after 4 hours of 13Clabeled fructose intake (0.72 g/kg-bw) [75].
Although it was reported that a significant amount of
fructose in the circulation could be used to produce
glycogen in liver via first conversion to glucose, no isotope tracer studies were found to directly quantitate
13C-carbons from dietary fructose incorporated into
glycogen in humans. Considering that most of absorbed
fructose is extracted and metabolized in liver, the data
from the fructose infusion studies noted above may not
be representative for orally administered fructose.
Lastly, a number of studies using labeled glucose
have examined how dietary fructose loads affect glucose production and disposal [76-78]. In these three
studies, 6,6-deuterium labeled glucose was infused as a
glucose metabolism tracer into male subjects after a
4–7 day fructose feeding, with fructose representing
>25% energy in the diet. Results indicated that hepatic
glucose production in normal subjects did not change
[76], or had no effect on whole-body insulin-mediated
glucose disposal [78]. Using a 2-step hyperinsulinemic
euglycemic clamp, healthy offspring of Type 2 diabetics
fed a high fructose diet exhibited higher fasting hepatic
glucose levels compared to controls [77].
Key points: 1) Fructose is converted to glucose to variable extents, depending on exercise condition, gender,
and health status. This interconversion occurs at the triose phosphate intersection of the glucose-fructose pathways. 2) A portion of fructose is incorporated into
glycogen after conversion to glucose, but the extent is
not known. 3) Fructose feeding has an effect on hepatic
glucose production and whole body glucose disposal.
And, 4) Fructose may be processed differently in obese
population or population with higher diabetes risk.
Fructose-lactate conversion
Another significant and perhaps underappreciated metabolic pathway of dietary fructose is its conversion to lactate. Earlier tracer studies observed that blood lactate
concentration was increased after fructose or fructose +
glucose ingestion compared to that after glucose ingestion alone [56,66,68,79,80]. It was also observed that sucrose ingestion also caused a higher blood lactate
response than did glucose [67,81]. However, no detailed
data were reported to clarify how much of the ingested
fructose was converted into the lactate in these studies.
Recently, Lecoultre et al. [51] conducted a tracer study
in 7 men while under exercise. Within 100 minutes,
96 g fructose with 144 g glucose were co-ingested. The
lactate conversion from 13C-labeled fructose was calculated using the parameters between 100 and 120 minutes
when steady state of carbohydrate flux was assumed. As
a result, 28% of fructose ingested was converted to lactate (35 micromol/kg-bw/min). Most of the converted
lactate (25/28 or 89.3%) from fructose was oxidized
mainly by working skeletal muscle (31 micromol/kg-bw/
min). The non-oxidative fructose disposal was 0.52
grams per minute accounting for about 40% of the fructose ingested. The rate of appearance of glucose from

fructose conversion was 19.8 micromol/kg-bw/min or
29% of the fructose dose. The authors also indicated that
the increased lactate production and oxidation would be
an essential explanation of faster oxidation of fructose +
glucose co-ingested than glucose ingested alone.
In the tracer study by Rowland and colleagues [82],
blood lactate concentration changes were compared in
10 men under exercise using oral test solutions of
13C-labeled glucose + 14C-labeled fructose (at 0.6 g/min
glucose + 0, 0.3, 0.5, or 0.7 g/min fructose). During the
2-hour study period and compared to glucose alone,
plasma lactate amount increased 31% and 24% under
the glucose + fructose ingestions at 0.6 + 0.5 g/min and
0.6 + 0.7 g/min, respectively. However, the study did
not indicate conversion percentage from the labeled
fructose or glucose dosages.
Key points: 1) Clearly, a significant amount of fructose
can be converted to lactate, but quantitative metabolic
data of dietary fructose to lactate conversion is very limited. The effects of fructose dose, administration
method, physical activity, and subject characteristics on
fructose-lactate metabolism remain to be further studied. 2) Labeling patterns of isotope tracer in fructose will
have an influence on the measured isotope appearance
in lactate, if the studied sugar is not uniformly labeled.
Fructose-lipids conversion
A significant number of clinical studies have been performed to investigate the influence of fructose intake on
blood triglyceride (TG) concentrations. However, tracer
studies aimed at revealing metabolic conversion from labeled fructose carbons to TG are extremely limited. In
contrast to the conversion from fructose to glucose, the
metabolic pathway from fructose to TG conversion can
be much more complicated due to the complex distribution and diversity of blood lipid compositions in the
body. De novo lipogenesis from sugars can occur in the
liver and end up as packaged VLDL TG and/or as intrahepatocellular lipids. There are currently no convenient
methods to quantitate overall DNL and intrahepatic
lipid deposition. The fractional contribution of sugars to
de novo lipogenesis and VLDL TG are commonly determined using tracer enrichment data of blood samples.
The time periods of liver de novo lipogenesis from
sugars and the factors influencing it are not completely
understood, and are impacted by the concentrations and
tracer characteristics of the various substrates drawn
from lipid precursor pools. De novo lipogenesis may
also occur in adipose tissue or muscles, but there are
no adequate methods available to quantitate it. A more
expansive discussion of de novo lipogenesis and methodological considerations is an appropriate subject for
a separate review.
Perhaps because of these difficulties, only two tracer
studies were found that investigated conversion of labeled dietary fructose carbons into plasma lipids. Chong
et al. [48] studied the effect of fructose on postprandial
lipidemia in fourteen adults (8 men) who were orally
administrated 13C-labeled fructose or 13C-labeled glucose at a dose of 0.75 g/kg bw, together with an 2 Hlabeled oil mix (85% palm oil and 15% sunflower oil)
at 0.5 g/kg bw. Blood lipid changes were monitored in
a 6-hour period. It was observed that plasma TG concentration rose more significantly after fructose ingestion (from baseline 1240 μmol/L (110 mg/dl) to its
plateau of 2350 μmol/L (208 mg/dl)) than that after
glucose ingestion (from baseline 1240 μmol/L to its
plateau of 1700 μmol/L(150 mg/dl)). However, the
concentration increases of 13C-enriched TG-fatty acids
and TG-glycerol from the labeled fructose in the Sf
20–400 lipid fraction (including VLDL) were very
small within the monitoring period. The plateau value
of 13C-palmitate concentration was about 0.022 μmol/L
(0.002 mg/dl), 13C-myristate was about 0.0015 μmol/L
(0.0001 mg/dl), and 13C-TG-glycerol was about
1.4 μmol/L (0.124 mg/dl), suggesting that fructose carbons were not substantially transferred into plasma TG
molecules during the time period monitored. The
authors indicated that the lipogenic potential of fructose
seems to be small, since the results showed that only
0.05% and 0.15% of fructose were converted to de novo
fatty acids and TG-glycerol at 4 hour, respectively. The
reported data should be viewed in the context of the 4-
hour time period and whether further conversion would
be observed at extended times was not illustrated. It was
observed by Vedala and colleagues [83], using labeled
fatty acids, acetate and glycerol as precursors, that a
meaningful portion of de novo synthesized triglyceride
would appear in blood at later times, and rates of this
delayed secretion were significantly different among normal, hypertriglyceridemic, and diabetic subjects. However, this study did not specifically measure fructose
conversion using labeled sugars.
In another study, Tran et al. [70] reported that 13Clabeled fructose consumption at 3x0.3 g/kg body
weight caused a small but significant increase of 13Cenrichment in VLDL palmitate in 8 men compared with
that found in 9 women (no increase) during a 6-hour
monitoring period. However, compared to baselines,
plasma TG and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations
decreased 5.3% and 32.9% in men and 3.3% and 24.4% in
women, respectively. The data indicate that the conversion from fructose to fatty acid occurred, however, no
blood lipid concentrations increased. Although the
authors reported that 42.9% and 43% of the ingested
fructose was oxidized and 37.4% and 28.9% was converted into glucose in men and women during the
Sun and Empie Nutrition & Metabolism 2012, 9:89 Page 10 of 15

6-hour monitoring period, conversion rate or percent
from fructose into fatty acid or triglyceride was not
reported. This study also noted that men processed
dietary fructose differently than women, and the given
fructose lowered postprandial plasma lipids. It was discussed that although fructose is a potent lipogenic substrate, the observed fat synthesis arising from fructose
carbons appeared to be quantitatively minor compared
with other pathways of fructose disposal, but it may
nevertheless have a significant impact on plasma and
tissue lipids. In this same study, respiratory quotient
(RQ) measurements found differences between genders,
with male subjects increasing their RQ by 3% and
females maintaining theirs. This data suggest that the
increase of blood TG frequently observed in men compared to women after high dose fructose ingestion
could be due to fat sparing during energy utilization.
There are several studies which used labeled acetate,
administered by intravenous infusion as a precursor of
lipid synthesis, to assess the fructose stimulation of de
novo lipogenesis (DNL). This technique uses the approach of Mass Isotopomer Distribution Analysis
(MIDA) to estimate the infused subunit (acetate) appearance in newly synthesized fatty acids and further predict
the effect of dietary fructose on fractional DNL. The
advantages and limitations of the method were well
reviewed by Hellerstein in 1996 [84]. Parks et al. [85]
investigated the influence of fructose-containing drinks
on blood lipid changes using infused 13C-acetate. Six
healthy subjects were randomly administrated 86 grams
(mean) of glucose, glucose + fructose (50:50) or glucose +
fructose (25:75) in drinks by a crossover-designed trial.
Four hours after fructose ingestion, a standard lunch
was consumed. Compared to glucose, more palmitate
synthesis in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) TG was
noted after fructose-containing drinks, but not after the
lunch. No significant differences were observed for TRLTG concentrations between glucose and fructosecontaining drink arms after baseline correction. Plasma
TG concentration was decreased after glucose preload
and stayed constant after fructose-containing drink preloads. Following the lunch, TG concentrations increased
for all treatments. The authors reported that the after
lunch TG-AUC data from fructose-containing drink
treatments were significantly larger than that of glucose
drink treatment. However, this AUC data was calculated
over the entire study time period. Due to the negative
TG rise during the glucose preload phase, the difference
between the glucose and fructose arms was accentuated.
Similarly, in Stanhope and colleagues’ study [86], 13Clabeled acetate infusion was used to measure fractional
DNL in a 10-week intervention involving 18 overweight
or obese subjects consuming either glucose (n = 8) or
fructose beverages (n = 10) delivering 25% of daily
energy. The percent changes of fractional hepatic DNL
were not significantly different from baseline following
9-week glucose consumption for both fasting and postprandial measurements. In the fructose beverage group,
the percent changes of fractional hepatic DNL were also
not significantly different between baseline and following
9-weeks for fasting data, but were significantly increased
for postprandial data (2-7% during 11-hour monitoring).
The actual amount of the DNL was not reported.
Faeh et al. conducted a shorter term crossover study
using a 6-day intervention [78]. Seven men were fed
hypercaloric (+800-1000 kcal/d) diets, with the additional 25% of energy provided through a fructose
solution. Fractional hepatic DNL was measured via 13Clabeled acetate infusion. The % changes from baseline
for plasma TG and hepatic DNL were found to be significantly increased for the hypercaloric fructose diet
compared to isocaloric control diets. The authors noted
that the results could not truly differentiate the effects
of the high-fructose intake per se and that of the total
carbohydrate energy overfeeding. This study also found
that fish oil added to the diets containing fructose attenuated this hyperlipidemic response somewhat [78].
Clearly, the 3 studies discussed above [78,85,86] assess
effects of dietary fructose with or without over energy
intakes on the utilization of acetate in the circulation,
which is designed to feed directly into lipid synthesis. In
humans, acetate concentrations in blood are fairly low. As
indicated in the Human Metablome Database [87], normal
blood concentrations of acetate are 41.9 ± 15.1 (SD) μmol/
L in adults aged 18 years and over. For earlier data,
Richards et al. [88] reported in 1976 that the normal value
of blood acetate was 25 ± 2 μmol/L. Beyond alcohol consumption, common dietary intakes have no or limited influence on blood acetate concentration [89,90]. In the
studies of Parks, Stanhope, and Faeh, acetate was constantly infused at 0.5-0.55 g/hr (about 7000 μmol/hr) for
25, 26 and 9.5 hours, respectively. Although the data of
blood acetate concentration were not reported in those
studies, it would be important to determine whether the
acetate infusion significantly raised blood acetate concentrations such that this could have a meaningful impact on
metabolic response to the fructose challenge. The coexistence of the infused acetate and intermediate metabolites
of fructose, including regulatory elements of citrate, malate, and lactate, could prime the pathway of DNL. As
detailed above, dietary fructose (up to 25% of daily energy
and 3 g/day-kg in these studies) can metabolically be converted into lactate and further result in blood lactate concentration increases. Beynen and colleagues’ hepatic cell
study [91] indicated that lactate and acetate both stimulate
fatty acid synthesis, and lactate can induce activation of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key enzyme for fatty acid synthesis. Thus, the meaning of stimulation of de novo
Sun and Empie Nutrition & Metabolism 2012, 9:89 Page 11 of 15
http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/9/1/89

lipogenesis observed from use of infused intermediate metabolite tracer and its interaction with the sugars studied
should be considered carefully, along with the study methodologies being validated for the dosage of infused tracer.
Additionally, how the infused acetate can truly represent
intrahepatocellular acetyl-CoA pool is another key point
to be clarified.
Key points: 1) The above tracer studies indicate the complex relationship between dietary fructose and lipid synthesis. The observed increases in plasma TG and DNL in these
studies can arise from both increased lipid synthesis and
decreased lipid clearance, and the relative contributions
were not addressed in any detail. And, 2) The intake levels,
health status, and gender of subjects are all important factors influencing sugar-lipid relationships. The influence of
fructose consumption on plasma lipids and de novo lipogenesis remains controversial and understudied.
Influence of exogenous sugars on utilization of endogenous
energy sources
After sugar ingestion, body utilization of energy sources
will change. As exogenous carbohydrate is used as a fuel
source, the oxidation rates of stored energy, typically,
endogenous carbohydrates and fat, will decrease. The
extent of the decrease is usually driven by ingested sugar
type, intake amount, and status of body energy need
(such as vigorous exercise or screen watching). Under
exercise, glucose is more likely to be preferentially oxidized than fructose, and this scenario will go in the opposite direction under a resting state. Although data are
limited related to detailed shifting of energy sources
under different conditions, some studies using subjects
under exercise may provide a basic concept of energy
source shifting after sugar ingestion. Jentjens and colleagues conducted a series of studies [66-69,80] using exercise subjects under somewhat comparable conditions,
and reported some data related to the energy source
shifting. The subjects were given drinks containing glucose, sucrose, glucose + fructose, or glucose + sucrose at
dosage 0 (control), 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.4 g/min and under
exercise workloads around 50% VO2 max uptake. For
controls (0 gram of sugar intake), the oxidation rates of
fat and endogenous carbohydrate were between 0.77-
0.95 g/min and 1.43-1.85 g/min, respectively. Compared
to the control, glucose-containing drinks decreased fat
oxidation rates by 21.6-41.7% (calculated based on
reported data) and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation
rates by 8.5-31.5%, except that one of the 5 studies noted
endogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates increased
(3.8% for medium and 14.1% for high glucose intake).
For fructose-containing drink arms, either for glucose +
fructose, sucrose, or glucose + sucrose, the fat oxidation
rates were lowered by 19.5-47.4% and endogenous
carbohydrate oxidation rates were lowered by 13.0-
31.6%. These percent decreases appeared to be positively
correlated to the sugar intake levels and the ratios of
fructose in the mixed sugar drinks. The other two studies [60,79] with similar settings as Jentjens and colleagues’ work also reported comparable data of decreasing
fat and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation after sugar
preloads.
Key points: 1) Together with other sugar interconversion data and the RQ data of Tran et al. [70], the
shifting of energy sources after sugar ingestion may indicate that the utilization of exogenous and endogenous
energy is closely regulated according to the energy balance of body. 2) Beyond specific health and physiological
conditions, physical activity, over energy consumption,
dietary macronutrient composition, and other lifestyle
factors would also play critical roles in the body’s
utilization of dietary sugars. In view of these factors,
how energy is quantitatively balanced with fructose loading is an area yet to be delineated.
Summary
Figure 3 summarizes the major metabolic fates of dietary
fructose based on the data obtained from the reviewed
isotope tracer studies. The mean oxidation rate of dietary fructose was 45.0% (ranged 30.5-59%) of ingested
doses in normal subjects within a period of 3–6 hours.
With exercise conditions, the mean oxidation rate of
fructose came to 45.8% (ranged 37.5-62%) within
2–3 hours. When fructose was ingested together with
glucose, the mean oxidation rate of the mixed sugars
increased to 66.0% (ranged 52.2-73.6%) under similar exercise conditions. Secondly, the mean conversion rate
from fructose to glucose was 41% (ranged 29-54%) of
Figure 3 Metabolic fate of dietary fructose carbons. The data
are obtained within study periods less than or equal to 6 hours.
After 50–150 gm fructose ingestion, the peak of fructose
concentration in plasma would be between 3–11 mg/dL. The
percent data above arrow lines or under box are the estimated
amounts of ingested fructose doses via the pathway, and the
question mark represents that the data remain to be further
confirmed. The dash-line represents presumably minor pathways.

ingested dose in 3–6 hours after ingestion in normal
non-exercise subjects. This value may be higher in subjects under exercise. The conversion amount from fructose to glycogen remains to be further clarified. Thirdly,
at short time periods (≤ 6 hours), it appeared that only a
small percent of fructose carbons enter the pathway of
liponeogenesis after fructose ingestion. The hyperlipidemic effect of dietary fructose observed in both tracer
and non-tracer studies may involve other metabolic
mechanisms and this could relate to energy source shifting and lipid sparing. Lastly, fructose can be catabolized
into lactate and cause an increase of blood lactate concentrations. Approximately a quarter of ingested fructose could be converted into lactate within a few of
hours and this is a means to release fructose-derived carbons from the liver for extrahepatic utilization. Even
though the reviewed tracer studies may not be fully representative of real-life diets and the obtained data are
limited, this review provides a basic outline how fructose
is utilized after it is consumed by humans.
