Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) frequently 
requires anticoagulation to prevent clotting of the extrac orporeal circuits. In recent years regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) has become a favourable alternative to 
heparin in patients at risk from excessive bleeding. Its use 
in liver failure patients, however, has been minimal due 
to the perceived risk of citrate accumulation and toxicity. 
In the previous issue of Critical Care, Schultheiss and 
colleagues [1] look at CRRT using RCA in liver failure 
patients, to determine whether citrate accumulation can 
be predicted using the total calcium (Catot) to ionised 
calcium (Caion) ratio (Catot/Caion), and whether RCA is 
feasible in such patients. Th ey demonstrate that, as 
expected, signifi cant citrate accumulation does occur, 
that it can be predicted using the Catot/Caion ratio, but 
more interestingly that the eff ects of citrate accumulation 
are not as severe as might have been expected. Th ey, 
therefore, conclude that CRRT in such patients is possible, 
an altogether interesting prospect in the management of 
liver patients.
Traditional concerns regarding RCA in liver failure 
have focused on the perceived risk of citrate toxicity. 
Reduced metabolism and subsequent systemic accumulation lead to potentially signifi cant metabolic derangements, with patients frequently exhibiting either metabolic alkalosis or acidosis [2], hypocalcaemia and other 
electrolyte disturbances, and notably a raised Catot/Caion
ratio [3].
Th ese concerns have recently been somewhat tempered 
by several studies involving use of RCA during extracorporeal liver support using the molecular adsorbent 
recirculation system. Faybik and colleagues [4] found that 
RCA was well tolerated despite raised Catot/Caion ratios, 
and that there were no adverse eff ects secondary to 
electrolyte disturbances, notably hypocalcaemia. Th ey 
suggest that citrate anticoagulation is possible and that 
the perceived benefi ts of fewer bleeding complications 
and longer fi lter circuit lifespans were realised. Meijers 
and colleagues [5] performed an open labelled crossover 
study  - RCA versus anticoagulation-free liver dialysis 
using the molecular adsorbent recirculation system - and 
similarly demonstrated that use of citrate in such patients 
is safe and feasible, with no signifi cant adverse outcomes. 
Neither study demonstrated signifi cant metabolic or 
electrolyte disturbances, largely as a result of clearly 
defi ned and applied treatment protocols, refl ecting 
learning from general critically ill patients [6].
Of interest, the recent study by Link and colleagues [7] 
determined that the Catot/Caion ratio was an independent 
predictor of 28  day mortality. Patients who had a ratio 
>2.4 had higher mortality rates, 33.5 times greater than 
those with a ratio <2.4. It might be that this refl ects 
Abstract
Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) for continuous 
renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has become 
increasingly attractive in recent years due to its 
favourable low bleeding risk profi le. Its use in liver 
failure, however, has been limited due to the risk of 
citrate accumulation and toxicity. In the previous issue 
of Critical Care, Schultheiss and colleagues look at CRRT 
using RCA in liver failure patients. They demonstrate 
that citrate accumulation can be predicted using the 
total calcium (Catot) to ionised calcium (Caion) ratio 
(Catot/Caion), and determine that despite the occurrence 
of signifi cant citrate accumulation, the eff ects of citrate 
accumulation are not as severe as might have been 
expected. This study raises interesting prospects with 
regard to RCA use in liver failure, and we postulate 
that citrate may have a role as a prognostic marker of 
metabolic capacity much as in the way of lactate and 
methacetin. However, further studies are warranted, 
in particular examining its application in subgroups of 
liver failure (chronic, acute, hyperacute and subacute), 
before its use becomes commonplace.

limited metabolic capacity in the liver and as such is a 
marker of degree of hepatocyte injury. One of the 
diffi culties in studying patients with liver failure is the 
breadth of disease this generic term covers. Patients with 
decompensated chronic liver disease are highly likely to 
have the metabolic capacity to cope with citrate anticoagulation whilst those with hyperacute liver failure 
may not. Various measures of metabolic capacity have 
the potential to be highly sensitive and specifi c clinical 
prognostic markers. Lactate [8], methacetin [9] and 
lignocaine [10] have all previously been shown to be 
useful, and citrate has such potential also. It would, 
however, need any clinician considering the use of citrate 
in patients with liver metabolic failure to be cognisant of 
the complications and identify such patients as carrying 
signifi cant mortality. In some, the use of citrate may be 
contraindicated, but the potential to introduce citrate 
metabolism into prognostic models may prove a further 
development [11]. Interestingly, such groups are not at 
particular risk of bleeding, having balanced disturbances 
in coagulation [12]. Th is is of concern to clinicians, as 
one would expect those patients in fulminant liver failure 
to potentially fall into this category, contraindicating the 
use of citrate anticoagulation.
Schultheiss and colleagues looked at potential predictors of citrate accumulation in an attempt to identify 
those patients who might develop a Catot/Caion ratio >2.5 
[1]. Th ey found that baseline liver function tests did not 
have any predictive capabilities, but that a baseline serum 
lactate level ≥3.4 mmol/L and a prothrombin time ≤26% 
were useful markers. However, such fi ndings may lead to 
inappropriate preclusion of citrate use, especially as 
several factors other than liver failure can lead to raised 
lactate levels, particularly low cardiac output states 
secondary to hypovolaemia or circulatory failure, fi ndings commonly encountered in intensive care patients; 
therefore, one should temper these fi ndings by stating 
that only baseline levels after appropriate fl uid resuscitation has occurred should potentially be used as a guide 
when considering the use of RCA.
Th is study raises interesting prospects with regard to 
RCA use in liver failure. However, it did not look at 
mortality, and based on the fi ndings of Link and 
colleagues [7], future investigations should certainly do 
so. In addition, none of these studies have looked at the 
eff ects of ultra-high continuous venovenous haemo fi ltration, frequently employed in the management of 
fulminant liver failure patients with septic shock to 
reduce vasopressor requirements, and for hyper ammonaemia and associated raised intracranial pressure [13]. 
Despite this, recent studies have served to somewhat 
dispel the notions that RCA is contraindicated in liver 
failure patients, but further studies are warranted before 
its use becomes commonplace.
