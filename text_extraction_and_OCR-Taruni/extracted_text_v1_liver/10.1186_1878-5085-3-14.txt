Abstract
This report is the collective product of word-leading experts working in the branches of integrative medicine by 
predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM) under the coordination of the European Association 
for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine. The general report has been prepared as the consortium 
document proposed at the EPMA World Congress 2011 which took place in Bonn, Germany. This forum analysed the 
overall defi cits and trends relevant for the top-science and daily practice in PPPM focused on the patient. Follow-up 
consultations resulted in a package of recommendations for consideration by research units, educators, healthcare 
industry, policy-makers, and funding bodies to cover the current knowledge defi cit in the fi eld and to introduce 
integrative approaches for advanced diagnostics, targeted prevention, treatments tailored to the person and costeff ective healthcare.

Changing Long-Held Beliefs is Never Easy: 
A Proposal for Multimodal Approaches in Female 
Healthcare - An Integrative View
Olga Golubnitschaja, Secretary-General of EPMA, and Vincenzo Costigliola, President of EPMA
Worldwide cardiovascular disease (CVD) is 
the leading cause of mortality in women: 
cardiovascular health in females is not improving 
as fast as that of males
Worldwide a third of all deaths of women and half of all 
deaths of women over 50 years old in developing 
countries are caused by CVD [1]. Several studies have 
been recently dedicated to the question of CVD-related 
death with particular focus on gender-dependent aspects. 
Although CVD is traditionally considered as the major 
health burden of male subpopulations surprising 
statistics have been collected for worsening the situation 
in females. New trends obviously demonstrate a shifting 
of the problem into healthcare of female populations: 
from 25 countries selected by World Health Organisation 
in the years 1990-2000, more than a half (15 countries, 
60%) currently demonstrate either increase in CVDrelated death in females or, even if the rates are decreased 
then less compared to men [2]:
1st group: increased CVD-related death in females
• Ukraine 63%
• Kazakhstan 58%
• Belarus 48 %
• Russian Federation 33%
• Romania 20%
• Japan 13%
• Mexico 2%
2nd group: CVD-related death is less decreased in females 
versus males
• Norway 17% less
• Germany 4% less
• Hungary 4% less
• Luxemburg 4% less
• USA 4% less
• Italy 2% less
• Portugal 2% less
• Armenia 1% less
Conclusion:
Taking into consideration that from altogether 25 selected 
countries only 10 countries demonstrate a decrease in 
CVD-related death rates in women compared to men, 
the situation is rather worsening for female cardiovascular healthcare or – if improving then not as 
eff ectively as for males. Th ese facts should be accepted as 
highly alarming for the acute reconsideration of current 
strategies in female cardiovascular healthcare.
Although CVD is common, signifi cant genderrelated diff erences have been recognised only 
recently
Evidence-based publications indicating signifi cant genderrelated diff erences in CVD diagnosis, manifestation and 
treatments as well as particular problems shifted to the 
female subpopulations appeared quite recently [3–5]. 
Delayed recognition of the mounting problems creates a 
consequent delay in covering multifaceted knowledge 
defi cits accumulated in CVD-related female healthcare 
which societies around the world are currently facing. 
Consequently there is an urgent need to elaborate the 
targeted measures forcing the improvement. Th e logic 
steps might be proposed as follows:
1 identify single lacks and gaps that altogether have 
resulted in current unsatisfactory situation;
2 analyse rapidly worsening versus improving regional 
healthcare situations and identify the most specifi c 
particularities of both;
3 elaborate eff ective strategies for covering the 
recognised defi cits at all levels of stakeholders that 
should be obligatory involved in the process of 
reorganisation including applicative science, social, 
economical and political levels;
4 consider to force the practical implementation of 
innovative approaches in predictive diagnostics and 
targeted prevention that are rapidly developing in 
pre-clinical trials;
5 create / readdress suffi cient budgets for educational 
measures, training purposes and staffi ng the experts 
essentially involved in the fi eld.
Conclusion:
For the concrete recommendations, several crucial 
aspects should be properly addressed by well funded 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14

analytical studies. Th e most relevant aspects for their 
detailed analysis are summarised below.
Women experience longer stays in hospital 
related to CVD and suff er greater complications 
and disability than men: negative social and 
economical impacts
Worldwide the leading cause of admission to hospital is 
CVD with consequent impacts for healthcare costs. 
Th erefore, a precise analysis of demographic statistics is 
very important for the economy of CVD healthcare to 
cover potential defi cits. Current reports [1, 6] indicate 
that women diagnosed with CVD suff er from
• higher levels of discomfort
• higher and longer pain attacks
• signifi cantly more of the consequent activity 
restrictions
• longer disability
• longer hospital stays
In this context it is becomes clear, why women have 
been reported to consume more hospital resources than 
men [7]. Th ose statistics have been collected for CVD in 
general but, the particular signifi cance is reported for 
diagnosed atrial fi brillation, heart failure and acute 
myocardial infarction [7–11]. Hence, the American 
National Hospital Discharge Survey reports stable rates 
of hospital admission for men versus permanently 
increasing ones for the age-matched women with 
diagnosed heart failure [10]: the female gender-specifi c 
increase comprises about 19% in North America since 
1990. Further, high risk of stroke as the secondary 
complication is the gender particularity acknowledged in 
women diagnosed with atrial fi brillation, in contrast to 
non of the predisposition as observed in men [8].
Conclusion:
Consequent negative impacts of the above listed risk 
factors should be considered as abusing the economy of 
healthcare and social systems, which the contributing 
female fellows in active age are involved in.
“Atypical symptoms” or inadequate diagnostic 
approaches in females?
Just simply using a logic thinking, one can expect 
signifi cant gender dependent diff erences in predisposi tion 
to, risk factors for and symptoms of cardiovascular disease, 
when anatomic, physiologic, biochemical and psychological characteristics of men and women are compared.
Deeper insights into cardiovascular-relevant gender 
particularities provide further strong argumentation for 
strictly diff erent predisposition, manifestation and prognosis as well as targeted preventive measures and appropriate treatment modalities for both sexes. Briefl y 
summarised female particularities are as follows:
• Sex hormones are decisive for the sort of CVD and 
period of life, as well as gender-specifi c disease 
manifestation;
• High prevalence of gender specifi c vascular dysregulation is also known as “vasospastic syndrome” 
(VS): in premenopausal women, the preva lence can 
be 30% and higher, whereby VS is more characteristic 
for intellectual professionals. Psychosocial gender 
particu larities, such as emotional stress, starvation to 
reach an extremely slim stature, etc., are strong 
contributors to VS worsening inade quate vasoconstriction in females. Untreated VS may predispose 
to a spectrum of severe CVD-related com pli cations 
manifested later in life [12]. Despite high prevalence 
and potentially tremen dous impacts for women 
health/care, VS has not been systematically investigated through large-scale scien tifi c projects;
• Th ere is a gender specifi c menopausal stress of or 
even damage to cardiovascular system followed by 
post-menopausal predisposition to ageing-related 
CVD that is signifi cantly higher in women compared 
to age-adjusted men: female hormone-related protective anti-ageing mechanisms are lost in menopause;
• Gender specifi c smaller vessel lumens is the strongly 
contributing risk factor for poorer outcomes under 
both ageing-related and -unrelated ischaemic conditions as well as under invasive treatments applied to 
cardiovascular system in women.
Consequently, the majority of studies, e.g. dedicated to 
acute coronary syndrome report “atypical symptoms” in 
women by diagnostic procedure standardised for male 
patients [13–18].
Conclusion:
Th ere is clear evidence for urgent necessity in genderdependent diagnostic profi les. Th ose profi les can be 
created by systematic biomedical studies considering the 
role of all contributing factors.
Current CVD diagnostics is elaborated for men but 
not for women
Despite the above listed argumentation, the symptomatology of CVD elaborates the manifestation models 
and patient questionnaires traditionally tailored to men 
as the main carriers of CVD. Th e absolute majority of 
large-scale studies dedicated to CVD symptoms include 
women as one tenth till maximum one quarter portion of 
the whole patient collective that makes any femalerelated particularity to non-signifi cant variable [19]. 
Hence, potentially important prodromal or acute 
symptoms relevant for female-specifi c manifestation are 
not considered at all. Consequently, using currently 
practised templates, women are highly restricted in a 
choice defi ning their real CVD-related problems [13].
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14

Conclusion:
Th is leads to inaccurate description of female-specifi c 
symptoms in general and individual ones in particular – 
the reason, why current preventive measures are untailored to women, CVD manifestation is rather 
unexpected and frequently remains undiagnosed at early 
stages in female patients.
Women experience delayed care in the case of CVD 
emergency: Lack of knowledge or long-held beliefs 
to be changed?
Th e above given facts partially explain statistics registered 
worldwide [20–28] demonstrating that in the case of 
CVD emergency and compared to male CVD patients, 
women experience
• later hospitalisation after symptom onset of acute CVD
• longer period of time before the treatment initiation, 
if any provided
• less likely intensive care settings
• illegibility for usual therapies, due to co-morbid 
disorders more frequent in female CVD patients
• less likely or delayed application of reperfusion therapy.
Th e performed socio-demographic studies have concluded the risk factors for delayed CVD-related hospital 
admission as follows: female gender, older age, ethnic 
minorities, low income, low education level and living 
alone [29]. Th ereby, the female gender risks carry either 
1. psychological or 2. educational and/or 3. physiological 
character:
1. by the psychological barrier for troubling others
2. by lack of knowledge to recognise an acute emergency, e.g. in the case of heart attack
3. by physiologically higher pain threshold compared to 
men [30].
Conclusion:
Th ese risk factors should be obligatory taken in 
consideration to improve individual outcomes.
Women with acute myocardial infarction have 
higher rates of mortality than men of the same 
age: female-specifi c complications or untailored 
treatment approaches?
Th eoretically, due to physiologically higher pain threshold compared to men, the rate of undiagnosed acute 
myocardial infarction and unrecognised silent infarcts is 
much higher in female patients [30, 31]. However, 
practically there are several factors contributing to higher 
rates of mortality of women with acute myocardial infarction. Among them are “atypical symptoms”, inaccu rate 
diagnostic approaches, untailored and delayed treatments, as summarised above. Data collected in several 
studies are consistent demonstrating early mortality 
(4-6  weeks) after acute myocardial infarction to be 
approxi mately double as high in female as in male patients 
[32–41]. Moreover, women below 50 years of age are of 
particu lar high risk of death related to acute myocardial 
infarction [1]. Th ereby, in-hospital mortality was signifi -
cantly higher in women across all age groups [41]. Th is is 
clear evidence for untailored treatments currently 
applied to female patients with acute myocardial infarction, rather than older age frequently used as the main 
argument to excuse higher mortality in females.
Conclusion:
Well funded studies are essential to be carried out covering 
evident knowledge defi cits in treatments tailored to 
gender-specifi c profi les of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction. Th ere is an urgent need in creation of multidrug cocktails considering greater burden of co-morbid 
diseases in women with acute myocardial infarction.
Short-term mortality after coronary intervention 
is higher in women than in men: The next acute 
problem related to gender-untailored treatment 
approaches?
Vascular complications remain more prevalent in women 
undergoing coronary intervention, and female gender is 
an independent risk predictor of in-hospital mortality 
[42]. Th e balloon angioplasty era generally resulted in 
poor outcomes in women [1]. But also the improved 
stent-application approaches are related to the statistics 
unfortunate for female gender: higher procedural risk 
and decreased effi cacy is still more typical for women. An 
operative mortality by artery bypass indicates 1.5-times 
higher risk for women compared to men [43]. Evidently 
gender-dependent physiological particularities play the 
central role: smaller vessels and lumens represent an 
additional technical problem for successful coronary 
intervention in women. Further, aggressive anti coagulation medications are more problematic for female 
patients suff ering more from access-site haematomas and 
bleeding complications [44].
Conclusion:
Innovative technical and pharmaceutical approaches are 
urgently needed to better satisfy gender-dependent 
particularities under coronary intervention in women.
Diabetes, CVD, cancer…What else?
Although the coincidence is common in women, 
consistent data do not exist to recognise 
co-morbidities by patient profi ling
Co-morbid diseases are frequent in women with CVD. 
Hence, CVD is the best acknowledged co-morbidity in 
diabetics. Moreover, it is well documented that female 
diabetics demonstrate poorer outcomes of CVD. Hence, 
the best recognised risk factor for high operation

mortality by and low effi cacy of valvular replacement is the 
combination of female gender and diabetes [5]. Further, 
cardiovascular diseased women, in particular female 
diabetics, have poorer prognosis of oncologic diseases [45].
Th e most frequent oncologic co-morbidities in female 
diabetics are
• endomentrium carcinoma (4.8-times higher prevalence in type 1 diabetes and 2.2-times higher in 
diabetes generally)
• ovarian carcinoma (2.42-times higher risk in female 
diabetics versus general female subpopulation)
• liver cancer (2.0-times higher risk)
• lymphoma (1.9-times higher risk)
• uterus carcinoma (1.7-times higher risk)
• rectum cancer (1.7-times higher risk)
• stomach cancer (1.6-times higher risk)
• leukaemia (1.4-times higher risk)
• kidney cancer (1.4-times higher risk)
• pancreatic cancer (1.3-times higher risk)
• breast cancer (1.2-times higher risk)
• lung cancer (1.1-times higher risk)
as documented in the literature [46]. Nevertheless, there 
is a signifi cant knowledge gap concerning “typical” versus 
“atypical” co-morbidity profi les in females.
Women develop CVD at higher age than men, and the 
consensus built in literature that the factor of age is the 
main reason for particularly frequent manifestation of 
accompanying disorders and severe complications 
observed in the cohort of cardiovascular diseased women 
compared to the male patient cohort. However, due to 
typical for 21st century demographic trends in favour of 
elderly populations, co-morbidities and more complex 
clinical situations now should be considered as less 
unique cases but rather as the persistent challenge in 
healthcare that required new strategies for improved 
treatment regiments.
Common risk factors moderating the outcomes in the 
most frequent female pathologies, namely DM type 2, 
CVD and breast cancer are progressing age, overweight, 
poor diet, physical inactivity and depression [47–49]. 
Moreover, modifi able risk factors persist from childhood 
and adolescence into adulthood and tend to cluster with 
synergistic negative eff ects for consequent manifestation 
of co-morbid pathologies [47, 50–58].
Conclusion:
Co-morbidities and complex clinical situations in elderly 
populations should be considered as the persistent 
challenge that requires new strategies in healthcare. 
Integrative medical approaches are strongly desirable to 
analyse common risk factors as well as their individual 
and synergistic eff ects. Frequent versus rare co-morbidity 
profi les in cardiovascular diseased patient cohorts should 
be created for advanced treatment regiments.
Breast cancer and CVD
In contrast to well acknowledged CVD / Diabetes link, 
CVD and breast cancer co-morbidity is poorly understood. Th is is an extremely unlucky situation, since compared to all other pathologies both co-morbidities 
demonstrate the highest frequency of incidence in 
females. Th e probability to identify a female postmenopausal patient above 55 years old diagnosed with sporadic 
invasive breast cancer but completely CVD-free is rather 
low. However, the coincidence of CVD and breast cancer 
in one individual, co-prevention, co-diagnosis and cotreatments are not considered at all.
What are current problems and knowledge gaps in 
prevention, diagnosis and treatments of breast cancer 
with co-morbidities?
• Worldwide 8-12 women from 100 are diseasing on 
breast cancer. Around 50% of DCIS (ductal carcinoma 
in situ) will progress to invasive and metastasis 
disease if untreated, with 20% of recurring ones 
despite “appropriate” treatments [49].
• Causative factors such as co-morbidities and epigenetic ones underlying recurrence of DCIS or progres sion to invasive disease are currently not known.
• Currently we need to treat 50 high-risk women to 
prevent one breast cancer: the role of negative prediction is underestimated [49].
• 95-98% are sporadic breast cancer cases versus 2-5% 
familial ones: the majority of sporadic breast cancer 
cases are peri- and post-menopausal women who are 
at signifi cantly higher risk of CVD.
• Co-morbidities in breast cancer are considered rather 
from view point of psychological aspects and 
palliative care but not as the realistic model to 
navigate bio medical research, eff ective diagnostic 
approaches and treatment multimodalities.
• Consistent data do not exist to recognise breast 
cancer co-morbidities by patient profi ling.
• Cost-eff ective healthcare promotion in breast cancer 
and its common or even persistent co-morbidities 
such as CVD and diabetes is not provided.
• Critical gaps between current research performance 
and clinically applicable results are dramatic.
Conclusions and recommendations:
If any, there is a very limited research activity around the 
world dedicated to integrative preventive and/or diagnostic and/or treatment approaches of both co-morbidities. Th e above listed challenges and knowledge gaps 
request a systematic reconsideration of current strategies 
in research and healthcare of the co-morbidities: the 
experts should be better motivated for really innovative 
integrative approaches. Th e most eff ective approach is 
the targeted prevention by screening for individuals at 
high risk followed by tailored treatments of pre-stages.

Prevention by modifi able risk factors should be 
prioritised and forced.
Do medication strategies aim at curing the patient 
or treating single organs?
Since 18th century, cardiac glycosides are used to treat 
congestive heart failure and attrial fi brillation [59]. Th e 
natural steroid toxin Digitalis-derived cardenolides – 
Digitoxin and Digoxin – are the most prevalent medicaments currently used in clinical practice. Th e medication 
forces the contractility in cardiac myocytes through 
inhibi tion of the Na+/K+-ATPase that indirectly increases 
Ca+ concentrations. During last decade, confl icting 
results have been published about potentially negative 
side-eff ects of the medication. However, recent studies 
have clearly documented a higher rate of invasive breast 
cancer among ever-users of Digoxin compared to neverusers [60]. Th e side-eff ect is particularly evident for 
postmenopausal Digitoxin users [61]. Moreover, a 
positive association between Digoxin usage and incident 
male breast cancer has been demonstrated [62].
Another example: Metformin seems to be eff ective 
against a pancreatic dysfunction in pre-diabetes and early 
diabetes stages. However, the application of Metformincontrolled blockade of apoptosis in young and middleaged patients with diagnosed pre-diabetic stages should 
become well investigated in terms of long-term sideeff ects such as potential cancer development (pancreas 
and other organs?) later in life. Current regulations 
request 3-year long follow-up studies that are apparently 
of insuffi cient duration for reliable statements.
Conclusions and recommendations:
Currently the cases in medical practice are not unique 
anymore, when a patient is taking around 20 and more 
tablets prescribed for parallel treatments of single 
disorders, which are frequently considered as indepen dent 
from each other. How much they are independent and 
how much overlapping within the treatment-frames? How 
much are single medications synergic with and contraproductive to each other? How much is multi modal 
medication depending on the profi le of co-morbidities and 
on individual patient profi le? All the questions should be 
obligatory addressed by long-term follow-up studies in 
accordance to reconsidered guide lines in order to avoid 
treatments of single organs and pathologies instead of 
desirable synergic multimodal approaches.
Demographic and female gender-related 
challenges: Recommendations for synergic 
multimodal approaches
Challenges
• CVD is strongly attributable to modifi able risk factors 
such as life-style, predominantly sedentary behaviour, 
and nutrition. Unfavourable demographic and 
epidemio logic trends in childhood and adolescence 
may lead to high CVD-predisposition (overweight, 
obesity, diabetes type 2) in societies followed by 
unprecedented burden on healthcare systems.
• Gender-related social and economical challenge: 
related to CVD, women experience longer stays in 
hospital, suff er greater complications and disability 
consuming more material and fi nancial resources 
than men with same diagnosis.
• Although CVD is the leading cause of mortality in 
women worldwide, cardiovascular health in females is 
not improving as fast as that of males.
• Signifi cant gender-related diff erences in presentation 
and treatment success of CVD have been recognised 
only recently; the consequent knowledge gap should 
be urgently covered in diagnostic, operation and 
medication technologies.
• Current CVD diagnostics is untailored for female 
gender.
• Women experience delayed care in the case of CVD 
emergency.
• Women have higher in-hospital and short-term rates 
of mortality than men with acute myocardial 
infarction, and after coronary intervention.
• Atrial fi brillation related mortality and stroke risk are 
higher in women than in men.
• Heart failure associated mortality declines in men 
much more signifi cantly that in women.
• Co-morbid diseases are frequent in women with 
CVD: Female diabetics demonstrate poorer outcomes 
of CVD as well as cardiovascular diseased women 
have poorer prognosis of oncologic diseases.
• Clustering of risk factors: overweight and obesity 
causes the leading severe diseases in women, namely 
diabetes type 2, CVD and breast cancer.
Desirable approaches
• Creation of gender-specifi c profi les for CVD-diagnostics and treatments by well-funded large-scale 
studies with parity of both sexes including “omics”-
based blood analysis, molecular imaging and elaboration of gender-specifi c questionnaires for accurate 
description of prodromal and acute symptoms of CVD.
• Consideration of CVD-specifi c sex-determinants 
such as mutated maternal mitochondrial DNA that 
emerges complications and fatal outcomes of CVD.
• Performance of large-scale population studies to 
identify most frequent profi les of co-morbid pathologies for eff ective treatments suitable for corres ponding combination of co-morbidities such as depression/
diabetes/CVD/breast cancer in female patients.
• Creation of strictly individual treatment priorities and 
regiments request personalised medical approaches

of high plasticity and new generation of multi-cocktail 
drug compositions.
• New drug delivery systems that allow for targeted 
treatments.
• Reasonable convergence between diagnostic and pharma ceutical industry in development of predictive/
prognostic approaches based on new multifunctional 
targets for diagnostic and treatment purposes.
• Besides general prevention in populations, there is an 
urgent need for targeted prevention in childhood, 
adolescence and adulthood as the most cost-eff ective 
approach that requests complete reconsideration of 
current diagnostic and treatment programmes off ered 
in healthcare systems: major CVD risk factors overweight, obesity and diabetes type 2 are the most frequent 
nutritional disorders in industrialised countries.
• Creation of new programmes in healthcare systems 
for eff ective promotion of and fi nancial motivation 
for healthy life-style.
Recommendations for innovative strategies to 
promote PPPM-related approaches in combating 
co-morbidities [64]
Long-held beliefs are fi rmly embedded in formal 
guidelines but also in public service performance and 
culture. However, important is that guideline committees 
follow the scientifi c evidence supporting the process of 
moving away from a target-based treatment towards 
approaches tailored to the individual patient-profi le [63].
Following approaches should be considered by 
healthcare-responsible organisations, research units and 
funding bodies to cover current knowledge defi cits in the 
fi eld and to introduce integrative approaches for eff ective 
prediction, prevention and tailored treatments:
1. creation of predictive molecular profi les of the 
disease, co-morbidities and pre-stages;
2. understanding of disease initiation: molecular, 
subcellular, cellular, intercellular, and single-organ 
levels as well as the organism as the whole;
3. disease progression should be considered as an 
interplay between promoters, contributors and 
inhibitors resulting in individual outcomes (similar to 
a geometric system of vectors by summarising 
directions and contributing power);
4. tailored treatment algorithms: specifi c targets, 
targeted pathways, multi-drug cocktails, frequent 
versus rare complications and co-morbidities, multimodal approaches;
5. eff ective primary and secondary prevention of comorbidities but not this of single diseases separately 
from each other;
7. new strategies in overall psychological supervision of 
individuals at high risk and patients at diff erent 
disease stages;
8. new European and inter/national guidelines for 
population screening that would make good use of 
gathered knowledge to advance cost-eff ective 
healthcare and improve individual outcomes;
9. promotion of integrative (bio)medicine to force 
practice-oriented research and cost-eff ective 
healthcare;
10. creation of a critical mass of experts stuffi ng for 
integrative (bio)medical disciplines;
11. education at two levels, namely in professional groups 
and in general population;
12. elaboration of new guidelines regulating the process 
of the paradigm change from a treatment of targets to 
a treatment tailored to the person with all her(his) 
individual particularities taken into consideration.

Summary Report - Special Session 
“Healthcare in Overview Across the Globe”
Th e “Healthcare in Overview across the globe” session 
started the 2nd day of the Congress in the impressive 
Bundeshaus - former Parliament of Federal Republic of 
Germany. Th e session included overview presentations 
from the respective EPMA national representatives 
regard ing the healthcare systems in Germany (Prof Dr F 
Paul), United Kingdom (Dr K Grosios), Japan (Prof Dr H 
Iso), Slovak Republic (Dr M Kapalla), Macedonia (Prof Dr 
K Richter), and Turkey (Dr M Dündar).
Th e members of the discussion panel included: Dr A 
Benini (Missionary of the Organisation of United 
Nations), Dr P Kulpa (General Director of Chief Sanitary 
Inspectorate, responsible for public health in Poland), Dr 
T Georgieva (Health Commission of the Bulgarian 
Parliament), Dr M Marzan (Medical Director of “Ana 
ASLAN” International Foundation, Bucharest, Romania) 
and Prof Dr S Suchkov (on behalf of the Government of 
Russia).
Th e audience included professionals involved in healthcare across Europe from public, private or third sector 
and at any level, whether clinicians, healthcare allied 
professionals, healthcare managers, academics, researchers, 
politicians, patients and public. Th is was one of the few 
times where many of the Congress participants were able 
to hear and appreciate the principles and organisation 
under which healthcare is founded and operates in 
diff erent European countries and how each healthcare 
system perceives and delivers PPPM. It is unlikely that 
such a session has been held before anywhere in Europe 
or worldwide.
Key recommendations:
• No European body, other than EPMA, is promoting 
the joint philosophy and integrative approach 
encompassing all three Predictive, Preventive and 
Personalised elements of medicine, in order to 
support a paradigm shift from late-stage intervention 
healthcare to Predictive Preventive and Personalised 
Medicine (PPPM) –driven healthcare;
• Individually, the three PPPM elements are 
increasingly becoming a recognised concept and are 
gradually integrated into healthcare systems across 
Europe in various forms. Some, such as various 
primary and secondary prevention programmes and 
health promotion campaigns, have existed for many 
years and others, such as eff orts to develop predictive 
tools and deliver personalised care, are now being 
established;
• PPPM has the potential to help us deal with many of 
the concerns facing healthcare systems in relation to 
disease and economic burden; whether in high, 
middle or low income countries;
• Careful consideration of many related issues 
(scientifi c, regulatory, ethical, etc) and, primarily, 
education (involvement from clinicians, governments, 
regulatory bodies, patients and public) are 
paramount;
• Development of quality standards and approaches is 
critical;
• In the same way that multidisciplinary and multisectoral involvement is essential to developing PPPM 
interventions, multinational cooperation would, 
additionally, provide maximum benefi t.
Specifi c points, which could be considered as EPMA 
working group activities:
• PPPM in developing (middle-to-low income) countries;
• PPPM Health Economics Statistics for PPPM research, 
IP issues for PPPM research (particularly early stage/ 
academic research EPMA database on biomarkers);
• Database of EU-funded or other EU and Worldwidelarge PPPM-related projects and initiatives;
• Th e role of rare diseases in PPPM;
• PPPM in Health (i.e. apparently healthy individuals).

Summary Report - Special Session 
“PPPM in Diabetes Mellitus”
Th e First International EPMA World Congress was held 
on September 15th- 18th, 2011 in Bonn, Germany. 
Participants from 43 countries were present to discuss 
ideas and strategies for advancing the concept of Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM). 
Given the growing epidemic of Diabetes mellitus, PPPM 
in Diabetes mellitus was a focal point of discussion 
during the General Session which was followed by a 
session dedicated to emerging concepts and developments in the fi eld.
Th e General Session emphasised the importance of 
Education in relation to PPPM in Diabetes Mellitus given 
the prevalence of worldwide diabetes which aff ects over 
300 million individuals or 6-7% of the world population. 
Th e predicted upward trajectory in the incidence and 
prevalence of this disease likely refl ects the inadequacies of 
existing diabetes education and prevention program mes, 
worldwide. Clearly, the growing burden of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus relates to the epidemic of over weight and obesity 
and thereby dietary habits and life style choices. Indeed, 
type 2 diabetes is now affl icting even children while in the 
not-too-distant-past, it was considered to be manifested in 
individuals in their 4th decade of life. Given the fact that 
dietary habits and life style choices cannot be “regulated” 
by any governmental agency, it then follows that 
“behavioural modifi cations” and promotion of adopting 
healthier dietary habits and life style choices must be 
initiated very early in life (e.g., kindergarten). Th us, the 
General Session emphasised the concept that the global 
burden of diabetes mellitus necessitates multifaceted 
initiatives on a global scale and identifi cation and 
promotion of eff ective means of translating emerging 
scientifi c information into eff ective public health policy.
Th e session dedicated to PPPM in Diabetes Mellitus 
was composed of a series of oral presentations by experts 
in their respective fi elds.
Highlights of Oral Presentations:
It is fi rmly established that endothelial cell dysfunction/
injury is a major culprit for the development of both the 
macrovascular (e.g., atherosclerosis) and microvascular 
(e.g., retinopathy and nephropathy) complications of 
diabetes mellitus; indeed, endothelial dysfunction is even 
a feature of the prelude stage of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(i.e., impaired glucose tolerance). Accordingly, an 
overview has been presented of the impact of diabetes 
mellitus on endothelial function followed by a more 
detailed discussion of circulating markers (e.g., endo thelial microparticles) emanating from damaged endothelial 
cells as potential markers for predicting endothelial 
dysfunction early in the disease process and long before 
the manifestation of target organ complications of 
diabetes mellitus. Emerging data has been shown regarding the impact of progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
on circulating levels of endothelial progenitor cells 
(EPCs); these cells are mobilised in from the bone 
marrow in response to injury and are believed to participate in repair and regeneration of the damaged endothelium. Th e reduced number of EPCs could likely serve 
as an early diagnostic indicator of endothelial cell injury. 
It is known that progressive obliteration of retinal 
microvessels is a characteristic feature of diabetic retinopathy and the consequent ischaemia and sight-threatening macular oedema and ultimately leading to preretinal 
neovascularisation. As alluded to earlier, EPCs participate 
in repair and regeneration of damaged endothelium. 
Nonetheless, since diabetes mellitus reduces the number 
of EPCs and impairs their function, the idea of introduction of non-diabetic EPCs into diabetic patients is 
advanced as an eff ective means of promoting wound 
healing and could guide their future use for treatment of 
extensive retinal or macular ischaemia in diabetic 
patients. Th e idea of ex vivo expansion and functional 
optimisation of EPCs (i.e., to correct diabetes-related 
defi cits) for eff ective cell therapy of vasodegenerative 
disease of the retina was discussed along with potential 
adverse consequences of cell-based therapy (e.g., pathological neovascularisation).
Th e clinical management of diabetic retinopathy has 
been stressed as a particular challenge in diabetes care, 
due to frequent visual loss by diabetic maculopathy and 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and suffi cient 
limitations of currently applied technologies regarding 
eff ective treatment of secondary complications.
With a view to the secondary complications, infl ammatory indicators as potential predictive indicators of 
diabetic nephropathy have been overviewed. Th e emerging role of infl ammation in manifestation of this complication of diabetes mellitus has been demonstrated. Th e 
more established infl ammatory markers include monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, CD68 and cyclooxygenase-2. An imbalance between increased pro-infl amma tory but reduced anti-infl ammatory cytokines has 
been proposed as the next class of prognostic biomarkers. 
Collectively, the presented data off er the promise of a 
novel markers generation for early identifi cation of 
diabetic nephropathy by assessment of their temporal 
relations in the renal tissue, plasma and/or urine.

Particular interest is dedicated to the determination of 
factors contributing to increased predisposition to cancer 
in diabetic patients such as a) stress-related factors (e.g., 
metabolic disturbances, hormonal dysregulation) which 
can lead to exacerbated oxidative/ nitrosative stress, b) 
mitochondrial dysfunction leading to disturbances of 
bioenergetics, impaired repair capacity leading to 
chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA damage and c) 
increased risk for infectious diseases and consequent 
induction of proto-oncogenic activity as well as activity 
of particular pathogenic bacteria. Th e stress proteome 
profi ling using peripheral leukocytes and plasma proteins 
has been proposed as the approach off ering the potential 
for clinical application given availability of advanced 
predictive diagnostics of secondary complications in 
diabetes types 2.
A potential application of polymorphic gene markers 
for monitoring disease progression in metabolic syndrome is currently under consideration such as several 
polymorphisms of apo-genes including APOA1, G-57A, 
APOA1 C83T, APOC3 Sst1, etc.
Dental aspects are considered to be of particular 
importance in the development of diabetes and its secondary complications. Hence, there is a number of characteristics of infl ammation common to both diabetes 
mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is a disease 
charac terised by chronic infl ammation of the periodontium (i.e., tissues supporting the dentition) which 
causes progressive loss of soft tissue attachment and 
bone support for the teeth, eventually causing loss of 
teeth. A healthy periodontium is of signifi cance and impor tance for the general health, nutrition and 
articulation, among others. Importantly, periodontitis is 
increasingly recognised as one of the most frequent 
complications of diabetes mellitus. Indeed, epidemiological data indicate a three to four fold increased risk for 
progressive periodontal destruction in diabetic patients 
compared to those without diabetes mellitus. Given the 
chronic infl ammatory basis of periodontitis, infl am matory cytokines/chemokines play a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis of both diabetes mellitus and periodontitis 
as its secondary complication. From the technological 
point of view, the potential use of gingival crevicular fl uid 
(CGF; fl uid from the infl amed gingival tissues surround ing 
the teeth) is proposed for assessment of infl ammatory 
mediators. Consequently, some cytokines expressed in the 
GCF (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, etc.) may be non-invasively detected 
as elevated to predict periodontitis in diabetic patients.
Advanced technologies have been presented in the fi eld 
of drug delivery systems (DDS) and their potential 
application in personalised medicine: the pivotal role of 
polymers in DDS; these included natural polymers (e.g., 
proteins, collagens, etc.), artifi cial poly mers (e.g., 
cellulose derivatives) and synthetic polymers (e.g., 
biodegradable (e.g., polyesters) and non-biodegrad able 
(e.g., acrylic polymers)). Th e appearance of novel, more 
eff ective and custom-made DDS for personalised medical 
solutions including those related to diabetes mellitus is 
expected as technologically available soon.
The specialised section has elaborated following 
recommendations:
Th e formidable challenge to public health posed by the 
global burden of diabetes mellitus is well-recognised. 
Less clear is eff ective measures that would halt this 
growing epidemic. Th e participants in the “PPPM in 
Diabetes Mellitus” session generally agreed that a 
number of measures focused on prevention and early 
identifi cation methods deserve due consideration as 
described below:
1. Th e fact that the prevalence and incidence of type 2 
diabetes mellitus continues to show an upward 
trajectory suggests that current measures are either 
not suffi ciently eff ective and/or implemented/
followed. Th e reasons for failure of nations (developed 
or otherwise) across the globe to halt the burden of 
type 2 diabetes must be carefully explored and 
eff ective solutions identifi ed.
2. Th e pivotal role of obesity in fuelling the increasing 
prevalence and incidence of diabetes is wellacknowledged. Th us, public health policy should 
seriously address the pervasive problem of advertising 
of high calorie, but low nutritional value, food items 
to children. In addition, the agricultural industry 
should be provided with incentives (e.g., tax and 
subsidies) to produce and market aff ordable nutrientrich foods that are less calorie-dense than processed 
foods. Th ese measures should be coupled with 
eff ective educational programmes (e.g., via the use of 
mass media) to inform the general public about the 
importance of healthy dietary habits as well as 
appropriate governmental policy (e.g., in relation to 
sales tax, food stamp, etc.) that would promote 
consumption of food items of high nutritional value. 
Since type 2 diabetes mellitus is now affl icting even 
children, eff ective and suitable educational measures/
programs must be implemented very early in life and 
continued throughout life. Th us, life style choices, 
such as dietary habits and physical activity, must 
remain a major focus of prevention strategies.
3. A wealth of knowledge does indicate that macro- and 
microvascular abnormalities contribute importantly 
to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and 
associated morbidity and mortality. Importantly, 
despite major strides in our ability to address major 
risk factors (e.g., dysregulation of glucose and lipid 
metabolism as well as blood pressure), the incidence 
of diabetic complications (e.g., nephropathy, 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14

retino pathy) remains high. As a result, the costs 
associated with taking care of these individuals 
coupled with loss of work productivity will continue 
to present major challenges for all nations and this 
problem is particularly grave for less affl uent societies. 
Such considerations further emphasise the need for 
identifi cation of eff ective preventive strategies.
4. A central component of preventive strategies is 
identifi cation of individuals at risk for development of 
diabetes mellitus. Th e use of demographic and life 
style factors has been helpful but the observational 
nature of these parameters limits their usefulness. 
Further, aside from considerations related to 
associated costs, assessment of indices of glycaemic 
control (e.g., glucose tolerance testing) are not necessarily effi cient in identifying individuals at high risk 
for development of the disease. Importantly, however, 
the era of genomics, proteomics and meta bolomics 
off ers the promise of eventually identifying novel, 
effi cient and cost-eff ective biomarkers for identifying 
individuals at risk of developing the disease and/or its 
complications; as described earlier, these aspects were 
the central focus of presentations in the session 
dedicated to “PPPM in Diabetes Mellitus”.

Summary Report - Special Session 
“PPPM in Cardiovascular Diseases”
It is imperative that patients, physicians, and researchers 
look into the potential benefi ts that predictive, 
preventive, and personalised medicine may off er patients 
with cardiovascular diseases. Any added benefi t to this 
patient group will have immediate consequences for 
hundreds of millions of patients and relatives due to the 
high proportion of people suff ering from the diseases 
[1,  2]. More than 17 million die each year from these 
diseases, including 7.6 million deaths from coronary 
heart disease and 5.7 million from cerebral stroke [1]. 
Th ere is also a substantial room for prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases through predictive, preventive, 
and personalised approaches.
Th e session “PPPM in Cardiovascular Diseases” has 
addressed the following questions pertaining to patients 
with cardiovascular diseases:
• Based on the Hippocratic request of ‘fi rst do no harm’, 
how can we understand the inferential powers of the 
traditional evidence-based medicine hierarchy and 
avoid any unintended consequences of the ‘genomics 
revolution’?
• What is the role of patient education of PPPM in 
cardiovascular diseases and how can we inspire hope 
without creating unintended hype and risks of 
commercialisation of products that off er more harms 
than benefi ts?
• What is the role of professional education of PPPM in 
cardiovascular diseases and how can we inspire hope 
without creating unintended hype and risks of 
commercialisation of products that off er more harms 
than benefi ts?
• What is a realistic timeline for the incorporation of 
PPPM into clinical practice? When can industry and 
academia realistically deliver new PPPM interventions 
compared to the expectations of patients (that is 
today)?
• What are the implications of PPPM for prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases?
How can we understand the inferential powers of 
the traditional evidence-based medicine hierarchy 
and avoid any unintended consequences of the 
‘genomics revolution’?
Th e traditional evidence-based hierarchy refers to the 
fact that diff erent experimental designs have diff erent 
inferential powers. In other words, what are we able to 
infer based on the results of a specifi c experimental 
design? Th e evidence hierarchy for establishing fi rm evidence for any intervention looks like the pyramid in 
Figure 1. Th e higher you come in the layers of the 
pyramid, the higher is the quality of research you can get, 
and the better are your inferential powers based on the 
research. Accordingly, the more easy and valid will it 
become to translate the research fi ndings into practice. It 
is very much like playing cards. If you have research 
fi ndings from a properly conducted systematic review of 
several randomised clinical trials, then this trumps the 
results of a single randomised clinical trial. If you have 
research fi ndings from a properly conducted randomised 
clinical trial then this trumps the results of a cohort 
study. It was Th e Cochrane Collaboration which coined 
the word ‘systematic review’ back in 1993, and there is 
now a handbook for systematic reviews on interventions 
[3, 4] and one on diagnostic tests [5, 6].
Judgments on the quality of evidence and recommendations of an intervention in healthcare are complex. 
Th erefore, the evidence hierarchy is the best framework 
for evaluating the eff ects of interventions. Sometimes, 
however, you need to downgrade or upgrade the 
inferential powers of a piece of research. If a systematic 
review of several small trials with high risk of random 
errors (‘play of chance’) and high risk systematic errors 
(‘bias’) is not well conducted, then the inferential powers 
of the systematic review needs to be downgraded. If a 
cohort study is well-conducted and shows an extraordinary large intervention eff ect (say, penicillin for 
pneumonia, insulin for diabetic coma, drainage of an 
abscess), then the evidence has to be upgraded. Th ere is 
no need for a randomised trial when it comes to interventions with a parachute-like intervention eff ect. 
However, such interventions are extremely rare in clinical 
practice. Furthermore, the research process is conducted 
as a forward running process (i.e., one has to construct 
the proper research design before one knows the 
benefi cial and harmful eff ects of an intervention). Th e 
research process should not be seen in retrospect where 
one assesses the intervention eff ects based on insuffi cient 
study designs.
A systematic and explicit approach for making judgments can help in preventing wrong recommendations 
and may improve medical communication. During the 
2000s the GRADE Working Group was developed [7,8]. 
GRADE stands for Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Recommendations to administer or not administer an intervention, 
should be based on the trade-off s between benefi ts on 
one hand, and risks, burden, and potentially, costs on the 
other. If benefi ts outweigh risks and burden, experts will 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14
Page 20 of 53

recommend that clinicians off er a treatment to patients 
with the disease in question. After going through the 
process of grading evidence, the overall quality will be 
categorised as high, moderate, low, or very low. Th e 
uncertainty associated with the trade-off among benefi ts, 
risks, and burdens will determine the strength of 
recommendations. GRADE has only two levels of recommendations; strong or weak, which is based on the available evidence:
• If clinicians are very certain that benefi ts do or do not 
outweigh risks and burdens, they will make a strong 
recommendation.
• If clinicians believe that benefi ts, risks, and burdens 
are fi nely balanced, or if appreciable uncertainty 
exists about the magnitude of benefi ts and risks, they 
should off er a weak recommendation. In addition, 
clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the 
importance of patient values and preferences in 
clinical decision making. When, across the range of 
patient values, fully informed patients are liable to 
make diff erent choices, guideline panels should off er 
weak recommendations.
When developing new interventions, investigators and 
industry are wise in conducting their research in diff erent 
phases in which scientifi c evaluation of the benefi ts and 
harms is adjusted to the level of knowledge obtained. Th e 
diff erent research designs used in the diff erent phases 
will depend on the intervention one wants to examine 
(Table 1).
When it comes to preventive and therapeutic interventions, randomised clinical trials are at the top of the 
evidence hierarchy. Th e main weakness of most 
randomised trials is that they usually only tell us what the 
outcome of groups of participants randomised to one 
intervention or the other is, giving us a summary of an 
eff ect on groups of participants, but do not give us information on how the individual responds. Personalised 
therapies off er what we all request: an in depth, personalised assessment of our heath status and a personally 
tailored approach to improve or remove any medical 
problems. If personalised medicine off ers ‘parachute-like’ 
intervention eff ects, then randomised trials may not be 
needed (but as we do not know the parachute like eff ects 
before we have the trial results, the randomised clinical 
trial is still the correct starting point). Moreover, most 
personalised therapies are likely to off er limited benefi t to 
a restricted group of patients. Such eff ects are hard to 
detect. Th erefore, personalised medicine must - like 
other interventions - undergo randomised clinical trials 
before they can be implemented. We need to demonstrate 
that the ‘personalised approach’ is off ering more benefi ts 
than harms compared with the ‘group-based approach’. 
Th erefore, when personalised therapeutic interventions 
show promise in phase II randomised clinical trials then 
they should undergo proper assessments in large phase 
III randomised trials compared with the more simple 
group-based approach. Only in this way we can assure 
that the personalised approach is off ering the benefi ts it 
promises.
Th e *omics development will be able to chop up even 
large disease areas like cardiovascular diseases in a 
number of smaller disease entities. Hereby, such smaller 
disease entities will, with further refi nement, end up as 
rare diseases, i.e., less than 1 out of 2000 people will have 
the specifi c disease. To conduct large phase III randomised clinical trials in such rare diseases is complex and 
costly. Th erefore, the European Union has established the 
European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network [9, 
10]. ECRIN is a pan-European infrastructure consist ing 
of national clinical research infrastructures designed to 
support multinational clinical research. By making 
Europe a single area for clinical trials and taking 
advantage of its population size to access patients, latent 
scientifi c potential is unlocked. ECRIN consists of 21 
countries covering more than 90% of the EU population. 
More countries are expected to join within the following 
years. ECRIN has been supported by EU FP 6 and FP 7 
during 2004 to 2011 (with a total of about EURO 6.8 
million). With the support of France, Spain, Italy, and 
Germany, ECRIN is expected to obtain European 
Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) status in 
2012.
ECRIN is working for harmonisation of regulatory 
issues and transparency in clinical research as well as for 
easier conduct of trials in prevalent and rare diseases.

ECRIN started the servicing of multinational trials in 
2010, and more than six trials are presently being 
conducted with the support of the ECRIN infrastructure. 
ECRIN plans to expand the network and strengthen the 
national partners; create a common European culture 
among professionals and patients communities; support 
cross-border connection of investigation networks; 
develop data management and monitoring tools for 
multinational trials; and make funding available for 
multinational clinical trials. Th e expansion includes other 
world regions, forming the basis for global trials. Such 
organisation will improve Europe’s attractiveness for 
investigator- and industry-initiated trials, boost Europe’s 
scientifi c competitiveness, and result in better healthcare.
Within cardiovascular diseases, stem cell therapy for 
regenerative medicine is one of the interventions that 
need further assessments [11]. To establish personalised 
autologous or allogeneic stem cell treatment algorithms, 
one has to consider whether one stem cell line is better 
than another to initiate development of new blood vessels 
or cardiomyocytes; whether there are diff erences in the 
individual persons inherent ability to respond to the 
intervention; whether clinical phenotype/co-morbidity 
has an infl uence on the effi cacy of the stem cells; etc. 
Such questions demand a concerted and collaborative 
action.
Th ere is a worldwide decrease in initiation of clinical 
trials with new treatment regimens within the 
pharmaceutical industry due to the increased costs to 
develop and test new interventions, and the more and 
more demanding regulatory requirements. Th is can very 
soon be a great problem for many diseases without

- randomised clinical trials
These study the impact of applying the new 
intervention in clinical practice. This includes 
large observational studies (clinical databases), 
randomised clinical trials, or cluster randomised 
trials.

eff ective treatment regimen. Moreover, some new 
treatments with the patient’s own stem cells are without 
any interest for the biotech industry, since these cannot 
be commercialised. Th erefore, there is a need for a review 
of whether regulatory demands have become too 
bureaucratic to develop new general and personalised 
treatments. In addition, the national and European Union 
foundations have to support fi nancially and logistically 
national and international academic investigator-initiated 
clinical trials within areas, which are without any 
commercial interest, but potentially can have a great 
impact for the individual patient and groups of patients.
What is the role of patient education of PPPM in 
cardiovascular diseases and how can we inspire 
hope without creating unintended hype and risks 
of commercialisation of products that off er more 
harms than benefi ts?
Patients are an invaluable partner in the planning and 
conduct of medical research. Th erefore, initiatives like 
Th e James Lind Alliance (http://www.lindalliance.org/) 
and Th e COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Eff ectiveness Trials) Initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/) 
having the aim to involve patients in clinical research 
design and defi nition of relevant outcome measures 
should be strongly encouraged [12–14]. It is through 
discussion with patients and their representatives that 
researchers can learn about which interventions patients 
would like and which outcome measures would matter to 
them.
Th ere should be ongoing information to the public about 
the status of personalised medicine, e.g., stem cell therapy 
in cardiovascular diseases and whether some preventive 
initiatives can improve the outcome of the therapy.
Patient organisations should follow the development 
within the areas and establish ongoing information to the 
patients about the status of, e.g., stem cell therapy in 
cardiovascular diseases and whether some preventive 
initiatives can improve the outcome of the therapy.
Furthermore, it is through liaison with patients and 
their organisations and representatives that researchers 
may impact political systems, so that more investment 
can be obtained for conducting clinical research. It is 
only through the conduct of randomised clinical trials 
and systematic reviews of such trials that we can learn 
how to optimise preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
interventions.
However, discussion with patients and their 
representatives need to be taken on equal terms. Th is 
necessitates education in the complex pathophysiology of 
cardiovascular diseases as well as the complexities of 
evidence-based medicine. People need to know why 
randomised trials are conducted and why patient series 
and cohort studies cannot provide reliable and valid 
information about the eff ects of interventions. Th ey also 
need to know that there is no ‘quick fi x’. Research takes 
time, it needs to be properly conducted [15, 16], and this 
necessitates investment of time, money, and patience. In 
addition, this contact forum can also be of importance to 
the patients understanding the validity of the many 
treatment regimens for diff erent diseases, which are 
presented by clinicians in diff erent media.
ECRIN has since 2005 celebrated the International 
Clinical Trials Day each year around the 20th of May [17]. 
Th is day is celebrated to commemorate the day of 20th of 
May 1747 when James Lind started his famous trial [18], 
and to make the public aware of clinical trials. Such 
events can raise interest and should be followed by a 
dedicated educational activity on evidence-based 
medicine, which should be directed by both schools and 
adult-learning institutions.
Th e way forward is to create hope by demonstrating to 
patients and to citizens that opportunities for identifying 
new preventive, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
interventions are vast. Th e fact that we now understand 
the evidence-based hierarchy much better enables us to 
only implement interventions that off er more benefi t 
than harm [19]. By teaching the public how interventions 
are assessed in randomised clinical trials and systematic 
reviews of such trials, we may prevent unnecessary hype 
is created and harmful interventions to enter clinical 
practice.
What is the role of professional education of PPPM 
in cardiovascular diseases and how can we inspire 
hope without creating unintended hype and risks 
of commercialisation of products that off er more 
harms than benefi ts?
The medical profession
Medical professionals need much better education on 
evidence-based medicine and need to think of 
randomised clinical trials as indelible part of their work, 
and not as an extraordinary rare activity that deserves 
extra monetary incentives.
Th ere is a need to educate much more physicians and 
nurses in conducting clinical research. Moreover, there is 
a need to educate more clinicians in conductance of 
systematic reviews of previous research [3, 5]. Only in 
this way are we able to close the gaps in our knowledge.
Furthermore, there seems to be a need for much more 
pregraduate as well as postgraduate education in 
evidence-based medicine. It is fi rst when those 
responsible for the clinical decisions master the evidence, 
it becomes correctly implemented.
The drug and device industries
Th e drug and device industries need to implement 
current knowledge about evidence-based medicine into 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14
Page 23 of 53

their clinical development plans and become much more 
transparent about their results.
Furthermore, the industries need to
• support much larger clinical trials on preventive, 
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions;
• be willing to conduct comparative randomised trials 
in which their products are compared with other 
interventions;
• support technical solutions for the implementing of, 
e.g., stem cell therapy in a broad public content and 
not only for a few highly specialised hospitals;
• support investigations which can outline the infl uence of 
patient’s genomic and clinical phenotype on the effi cacy 
of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions.
The governmental institutions
Governments and supranational organisations need to 
implement research programmes that focus on clinical 
research for common as well as rare diseases that aff ect 
the populations. In the EU, Horizon 2020 has been 
created to establish new growth and jobs in Europe [20]. 
Running from 2014 to 2020 with an €80 billion budget, 
the new EU programme focuses on a number of research 
questions in academia and industry. Horizon 2020 will 
invest in research infrastructures like ECRIN.
What is needed is complementary supranational and 
national research programmes that focus on clinical 
research for common as well as rare diseases that aff ect 
the populations with support for
• conductance of high quality systematic reviews of 
interventions;
• large-scale, multicenter clinical trials on preventive, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions;
• research to evaluate the genomic and clinical phenotypic infl uence on stem cell function;
• research to evaluate the genomic and clinical phenotypic infl uence on benefi ts and harms of clinical 
interventions.
Th e way forward is to create hope by demonstrating to 
medical professionals, industry, and governmental institu tions that opportunities for identifying new pre ven tive, 
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic interven tions are 
vast. Th e fact that we now understand the evidencebased hierarchy enables us only to implement 
interventions that off er more benefi t than harm. By 
teaching the public about how interventions are assessed 
in randomised clinical trials and systematic reviews of 
such trials, we may prevent unnessesary hype and 
harmful interventions to enter clinical practice.
What is a realistic timeline for the incorporation of 
PPPM into clinical practice?
Patients and relatives alike want interventions that work 
now. Global medical research delivers constantly new 
reports on randomised clinical trials - about 25000 
publications a year from all medical fi elds [21]. Th ey need 
to become integrated with what we already know. Based 
on updated meta-analyses with trial sequential analyses 
[22–24] in systematic reviews - taking both the risks of 
systematic errors [15, 16] and risks of random errors [22–
24] into account - we need to design new randomised 
trials in fi elds where the evidence is still not conclusive. 
In fi elds where the evidence is conclusive, the 
interventions have either to be implanted in clinical 
practice or research programmes redirected in case the 
intervention does not work or is causing more harm than 
benefi t. Such activities takes time, but due to the constant 
fl ow of new research fi ndings patients and relatives may 
rest assured that new preventive, diagnostic, prognostic, 
and therapeutic interventions are on their way.
What are the implications of PPPM for prevention 
of cardiovascular disease?
Targeting the appropriate population
Primordial prevention is an early eff ort to prevent 
cardiovascular diseases, mainly through formation and 
modifi cation of ‘desirable’ lifestyles and behaviours. 
Primary prevention is to control cardiovascular risk 
factors through modifi cation of lifestyles and the use of 
interventions [25]. Preventive measures can be classifi ed 
into population-level (public health) and individual-level 
interventions (Figure 2). For individual interventions, it is 
critical to select an individual or a group of individuals to 
administer the particular intervention. Th is process is 
based on appropriate prediction of future cardiovascular 
risk. Th en, personalised preventive measures should be 
given according to the predicted risk. In order to evaluate 
the appropriateness of the intervention for better public 
health, it is important to evaluate population-level impact 
using population-attributable fraction (PAF) as well as its 
eff ectiveness for the specifi c targeted individuals [26]. It 
is sometimes necessary to compare PAF of the condition 
that the new intervention could eliminate with that of the 
other conditions which existing measures have been 
targeting. Th is is because the existing measures may be 
replaced at least in part by the implementation of a new 
measure due to the limited resources that can be allocated to public-health sector. Th erefore, the harmonisation 
of new and existing measures is necessary with collaborative eff ort of academic, governmental and industrial 
specialists and stakeholders, as well as considering costeff ectiveness of new measurements. Th ere is at least one 
example in which such harmonisation has not been 
suffi cient. New public-health screening system was 
initiated in 2008 in Japan targeting the metabolic 
syndrome. Individuals were screened whether or not they 
have abdominal obesity, based on pathophysiological 
understanding of that condition. Th e implementation of 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14
Page 24 of 53

this new screening and subsequent interventions to 
individuals with metabolic syndrome led to the dis continuation of other services, especially for hypertension. 
Interventions for those with hypertension without 
abdominal obesity were de-emphasised and sometimes 
ignored. Two consequent problems have been recognised. First, the benefi ts and harms of the screening 
program and the subsequent interventions have not been 
evaluated rigorously by randomised trials. Second, it has 
been shown that the PAF of metabolic syndrome is much 
smaller than the PAF of non-overweight people with 
cardiovascular risk factors [27, 28]. Th e Japanese 
government is amending the existing strategies to focus 
more on the problems of non-overweight people being 
high risk individuals for cardiovascular diseases.
Personalised prevention
Apart from issues related to an intervention itself, 
emphases are placed here on prediction: the identifi cation 
of appropriate individuals (screening methods) and the 
allocation of appropriate interventions for particular 
individuals (risk stratifi cation). From a view of public 
health, mass screening is one of the most practical and 
successful methods for identifying people with high, 
intermediate, and low cardiovascular risks at one time. 
Refi nement of the risk stratifi cation algorithms can be 
achieved by introducing additional categories for 
intermediate risk using new biomarkers (e.g., high sensitivity CRP), new risk factor categories (e.g., high-normal 
blood pressure or impaired fasting glucose), and the 
evaluation of their cost-eff ectiveness.

Summary Report - Special Session 
“PPPM in Cancer”
Defi nitions
• Biomarker is a characteristic that is objectively 
measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal 
bio logic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Th us, 
a biomarker is a physical measurement; it is a protein, 
RNA expression (gene arrays), DNA (SNPs), metabolite, circulating cell, etc.
• Clinical endpoint is a characteristic or variable that 
measures how a patient feels, functions, or survives.
• Surrogate endpoint is a biomarker intended as a 
substitute for a clinical endpoint
• Th eranostic is the combination of therapeutics plus 
diagnostics
• Companion biomarker is an in vitro diagnostic medical 
device required for the new approval of a therapeutic 
treatment that serves to improve the risk/benefi t 
profi le of the treatment of a previously diag nosed 
condition through the stratifi cation of patients. Th e use 
of biological information is functional to develop better 
drugs quicker; prescribe for each patient the best 
treatment and optimise the costs; and use the expensive treatments for the patients who will benefi t from it.
The promises of biomarkers
In 2010, more that 50,000 papers that dealt with 
biomarkers have been published. Biomarkers are a child 
of the genomics technologies because they reduce risk in 
drug development (pharma companies), and improve 
patient outcomes (healthcare providers).
Th e use of a biomarker is strategically important for 
earlier diagnosis, patient stratifi cation, assessment of drug 
toxicity and effi cacy, disease risk, staging, and prognosis.
Types of biomarkers
• Translation biomarker: applicable in preclinical and 
clinical settings.
• Disease biomarker: relates to a clinical outcome or 
measure of disease.
• Effi cacy biomarker: refl ects the benefi cial eff ect of a 
given treatment.
• Staging biomarker: distinguishes among diff erent 
stages of a chronic disorder.
• Surrogate biomarker: a valid substitute for a clinical 
outcomes measure.
• Toxicity biomarker: reports a toxicological eff ect of a 
drug in in vitro and in vivo systems.
• Mechanism biomarker: reports a downstream eff ect 
of a drug.
The pharmacological audit trail used in the development of 
novel anticancer agents.

• Target biomarker: reports interaction of the drug with 
its target.
What do we miss?
• Diffi culty to access cohorts and appropriate banking; 
need for easier access to repository cohorts (retroand prospective) and biobanks.
• No validation, follow-up, comparison, or standardisation reference of biomarker tests.
• No biomarker inventory validated in Europe.
• Need to develop Europe-specifi c guidelines for 
biomarker qualifi cation and clinical validation.
What do we need?
• Dissemination, communication, and implementation 
of biomarkers.
• Improve linkage of biomarkers to clinical information 
(and patient information).
• Coordination between disciplines & technologies: 
acceleration of partnerships between academic, 
medical research, clinicians, pharma, diagnostic, and 
biotech companies).
Why does this happen?
• Relevance, specifi city, validation of biomarkers 
(access to repository banks) is still an issue of 
discussion and standardisation.
• Some biomarkers are only developed for drug 
discovery phase.
• Hurdles with regulatory, price and reimbursement of the 
drugs/diagnostics duo or the companion diagnostics.
• Hurdles linked to commercialisation model.
• Drug and biomarker development are not the same 
businesses.
• Lack of specifi c guidelines to facilitate the 
incorporation of personalised medicine into the 
health-service infrastructure; therefore, there is a very 
heterogeneous approach to the use of such 
biomarkers.
From these premises it appears that, despite the process 
towards personalised medicine, aimed at better 
predicting, preventing and treating diseases based on a 
patient’s individual characteristics, is gaining pace in 
Europe, a long-term structured approach to foster 
innovation in this area and to facilitate the rapid uptake 
of personalised medicine into clinical practice are 
lacking. Th e EPMA plays an important role to advance 
this area further and promote collaborative interactions 
among health agencies.
During 2010, the Health Directorate of the EC’s 
Directorate General for Research and Innovation 
organised a series of workshops on stratifi cation biomarkers and personalised medicine. Th e aim of these 
workshops was to take stock of the current situation in 
personalised medicine, and to identify further needs and 
opportunities from a research point of view.
With these premises, the EPMA should provide a 
platform for professionals to:
a) discuss the values of incorporating biomarkers into 
pharmaceuticals and diagnostics development, and of 
their potential applications in disease management 
such as early prediction, detection, and prevention of 
medical conditions;
b) facilitate tailored therapeutics that could be safer and 
more eff ective for individuals.
In the Session on Predictive, Preventive and Person alised Medicine in Cancer, the distinguished experts with 
acknowledged expertise address the prob lem of currently 
missing clear strategy of personalised treat ment in 
oncology. Particular attention is paid to the following 
questions:
a) Which biomarkers are useful?
b) Are they ready for clinical use?
c) How does biomarker investment add real value in the 
drug/diagnostics development pathway?
d) What are the key challenges with the identifi cation 
and validation of biomarkers?
e) Is there a diff erence in the process for safety biomarkers compared to effi cacy biomarkers?
f) What should be done to address the challenges in the 
short-, medium-, and long-term?
g) How much do inter-individual diff erences account in 
drug metabolism and response?
h) What other factors could help medicine 
personali sation?
i) How far could biomarkers play a role to avoid adverse 
drug reactions?
Conclusions
• High density biomarker data will change our view on 
health and disease and will impact on research, drug 
development and healthcare application.
• Complexity of innovative PPPM related biomarkers is 
to be expected.
• “Complex” multiplexing technologies will be the tools 
(Molecular Imaging / Profi ling, Genomics, 
Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, etc.).
• A standardised validation of biomarkers is crucial for 
PPPM application in routine medical practice (tools 
and profi les).
• Classical anamnesis together multiplexed assays will 
become the new gold standard.
• Appropriate statistical planning is crucial for the 
outcome of PPPM related studies.
Recommendations
It is important to remember that the EPMA brings 
together stakeholders involved in all areas of personalised

medicine: it is a unique opportunity to identify key 
challenges where actions are needed at the EU level to 
progress research, and to promote a development and 
implementation of PPPM in healthcare in a global scale.
• Cancer is a multi-factorial, whole-body disease that 
causes multiple organ and metabolic alterations. 
Usually not only one single intracellular signal 
pathway; not one single index/parameter. A paradigm 
shift from traditional single-factor strategy to multipleparameter systematic strategy will be important for 
the prediction/prevention, early-stage diagnosis/
therapy, and assessment of preventive and therapeutic.
• Practitioners working in PPPM need new 
methodologies for the handling of the vast amounts 
of clinical information 5-year survival rates, while 
useful, are inadequate as a sole predictor of individual 
patient response. Signifi cant advances being made in 
Bioinformatics and IT solutions for predictive, 
preventive and personalised medicine nowadays 
allow for integrative approach in making clinical 
decisions.
• An integrative approach should be eff ectively 
promoted in application of diagnostic and therapy 
monitoring technologies rather than prioritising 
individual ones, e.g. molecular profi ling against 
medical imaging or genomics taking precedence over 
proteomics among “fi shing expeditions for biomarkers”.
• In order to properly evaluate potentially promising 
biomarkers, these biomarkers need to be subjected to 
rigorous prospective, randomised clinical trials. Th e 
unique role and value of both retrospective and 
prospective studies is indicated.
• In PPPM fi eld, the most important role of biomarkers 
is in the realm of prediction and prognosis. Th e 
proper use of predictive and prognostic biomarkers 
would be critically important in prediction of the 
disease and effi cacy of potentially cyto-toxic and 
disease-inducing forms of aggressive treatment. In 
many cases, it would be in the patient’s best interest 
to avoid potentially harmful forms of treatment, if 
these could be reliably predicted (prior to treatment) 
to be ineff ective and futile. First do no harm!
• Th ere is a consensus in the necessity of panels rather 
than individual biomarkers to be clinically applied to 
more successful cancer diagnostics and treatment, 
specially due to the nature of human cancers which 
frequently undergo genetic alterations and mutations. 
It is important that researchers fi nd ways to 
successfully decipher large quantities of information 
and fi nd meaningful combinations of clinically useful 
biomarker panels.
• For several pathologies and patient cohorts, the role 
and signifi cance of biomarkers is not strictly “black or 
white”, but rather various “shades of gray”. In other 
words, the expression, meaning and impact of 
biomarkers may be inconsistent; subgroups of 
patients may express diff erent biomarkers within the 
cohort. Accordingly, strict rules and methodologies of 
validation may have to be revised in order to be 
reasonably fl exible to recognise and scientifi cally 
categorise these “shades of grey” in according to the 
individual patient profi les.
• In terms of early detection, targeted prevention and 
treatments, of particular importance are novel but 
critically important forms of “multiple biomarkers” 
related to infl ammatory process, to be recognised and 
factored.
• In terms of the biomarker nature, most protein 
“biomarkers” have not been fully analysed at the 
individual amino acid level. From a technical point of 
view it makes a good sense to use mass spectrometrybased protein analysis to obtain the exact protein 
sequence for a patient profi ling. Hence, many protein 
assays are based on antibodies that recognise general 
areas of proteins (i.e., N- and C-termini, and small 
groups of amino acids); however, many cancercausing mutations are very subtle. Th e use of current 
“generalised” antibodies might overlook patient-topatient variations in protein structure. An example 
that illustrates the point, there is the current interest 
to develop antibodies that are capable of 
diff erentiating normal from mutated versions of 
proteins (e.g., KRAS and BRAF). Currently used 
“Western blot” and ELISA analysis do not have this 
capability.
• Further innovation in diagnostics considers 
identifi cation of protein expression changes in cells in 
a range of diff erent dynamic states in a form of 
“protein atlases”. Th ese protein atlases may enable 
future work to identify small changes in cell 
phenotypes to indicate possibly pre-clinical changes 
in an organ or tissue.
• It is imperative that the PPPM community creates a 
committee based on the EPMA group to develop a 
rigorous strategy leading to a more productive means 
of identifying biomarkers that would be clinically 
relevant.
• Since an integrative medical approach by PPPM is a 
new fi eld, consequently new guidelines need to be 
developed.
• Due to a substantial lack of guidelines and specifi c 
recommendations on the use of biomarkers in cancer 
medicine, the creation of a committee by the EPMAconsortia to draft strategic recommenda tions on the 
use of PPPM related biomarkers in cancer treatment 
has been proposed.

Appendix
The elaborated list of statements and questions proposed 
by the EPMA experts to promote the fi eld and evaluate the 
implementation of PPPM strategies over the next years
Question 1a-f: Biomarkers
(1a) Why are there so many published biomarkers, yet 
very few in clinical practice? What is wrong in the 
validation process?
(1b) What are the key challenges with the identifi cation 
and validation of biomarkers?
(1c) Which biomarkers are useful?
(1d) How much do biomarkers account inter-individual diff erences in drug metabolism and response?
(1e) Should molecular profi ling (genomics) take precedence over proteomic analysis in initial “fi shing 
expeditions” for biomarkers?
(1f) Is pre-surgical genomic analysis of potential value 
in determining individual patient drug response?
Question 2a-d: First Do No Harm – Avoiding the 
unintended consequences of genomics
(2a) Myth from reality: Will we really soon reach an 
era of “customised care” for cancer? Is cancer care 
just a question of clarifying which gene or pathway 
is deranged and in which patient?
(2b) Liaisons with industry can be dangerous but also 
extremely benefi cial to PPPM. Th e proposed strategy: Exaggerating certain actions vs. lack-of-action.
(2c) Patient organisations (POs): Reciprocal discussion 
and education is recommended; more inputs from 
POs is needed, to share scientifi c knowledge with 
patients and to promote the philosophy of 
participative medicine.
(2d) Create a consensus with POs dealing with patient 
fears and expectations.
Question 3a-e: Cancer relevant (?) mutations
(3a) How important is the mutations analysis of 
individual genes (real risk of cancer for mutation 
carriers according to the last data)?
(3b) What are the national standards for the mutation 
testing in Europe and USA (if they do exist)?
(3c) What about reimbursement of such testing; other 
economic considerations?
(3d) Follow-up of mutation carriers: is there any fi xed/
fi nalised protocol? Is the task to make regular 
observations depend only on the desire of the 
mutation-carrier?
(3e) Creation of a comparative analysis and critical 
review regarding the situation in diff erent countries for the mutation testing / carriers treatment
Question 4a-d: Multi-parameter systematic strategy for 
PPPM in cancer
(4a) Cancer is a multi-factorial, whole-body disease 
that causes multiple organ and metabolic 
alterations. Th e matter is usually neither about 
only one single intracellular signal pathway, nor 
one single index/parameter.
(4b) A paradigm shift from traditional single-factor 
strategy to multiple-parameter systematic strategy 
will be important for the prediction/prevention, 
early-stage diagnosis/therapy, and assessment of 
targeted preventive strategies and therapeutics.
(4c) How do we extract relevant information: 
molecular biology developments are bringing a 
real “renaissance” of basic biomedical sciences and 
yet the risk is to become overwhelmed by an 
ocean of data or not be capable of appropriately 
interpret?
(4d) What is required for the development of *omics 
technologies, bioinformatics, systems biology, and 
computation biology in order to provide the 
fundamental conditions to realize the multiparameter systematic strategy for each aspect?

Summary Report - Special Session 
“PPPM in Neurodegenerative Diseases”
Introduction
Th e application of predictive, preventive and personalised 
treatment could not be more relevant to neuro de generative disorders (NDD) given the occurrence of predictably 
hereditary cases, having a long preclinical period (presymptomatic phase) and being still incurable.
On the other hand, the ageing population leads to an 
increasing occurrence of acquired NDD. Regrettably, at 
time of diagnosis is too late to begin with a neuro protective 
treatment since neuro-axonal degeneration is irreversible, 
as ongoing neurodegenerative cascades are already 
initiated and can at best be modulated benefi cially.
In all neurodegenerative diseases there is a great unmet 
medical need, calling for early diagnosis, prognostic 
evaluation, personalisation of therapeutic regimes and a 
better prediction of treatment outcomes. Fortunately, 
advancing technology and methodology can help to make
• Th e correct diagnosis signifi cantly earlier in the 
disease process.
• Th e PPPM approach could represent the “golden 
answer” to the challenges in NDD management.
• EPMA should assist by trying to eff ectively disseminate to all identifi ed relevant players every piece of 
evidence that becomes available in the support of the 
new paradigm.
• For example the latest report of ADI (Alzheimer 
Disease Association) - the World Alzheimer report 
for 2011 which covers specifi cally the topic of “Th e 
benefi ts of early diagnosis and intervention”, includes 
good evidence that the prevention NDD can bring 
savings to the healthcare systems.
• Education should be addressed in two main 
directions: towards the post-graduate level and also 
towards the young medical students.
Main topics to cover are:
1. To promote earlier diagnosis, to apply eff ective early 
interventions for people in the early stages of 
dementia and at premotor phases of Parkinson’s 
disease and comparable disorders. Th is is costeff ective for the governments: invest to save.
2. Th ere should be evidence-based practices in early 
intervention around the world
3. Care services should ensure that evidence-based 
clinical tests and interventions are made available to 
people in the early stage of NDD
4. Th e need of reliable markers indicative of a 
pathological process before symptoms manifestation 
and those that could be indicative of disease 
modifi cation by drug therapy.
Animal models and translational approaches
Better animal models of neurodegenerative diseases might 
be useful to identify the appropriate molecular targets 
responsible for disease at diff erent stages of the process (to 
block those processes) and/or the relevant endogenous 
repair mecha nisms (to stimulate protection/repair).
Future research on animal models of NDD should shift 
their focus from well-established models of end-stage 
symptoms towards the development and evaluation of 
new models that mimic disease triggering and progression more accurately. A major requisite will be an 
increased interaction between basic scientists and clinician scientists with respect to PPPM in neurodegenerative 
diseases. Diverse opportunities should be off ered to basic 
science trainees to experience the realities of the clinical 
routine and, for young clinician scientists, to gain exposure to the bench or clinical research. Scholarship or 
fellowship programmes that support basic science 
students to participate in clinical research and clinician 
scientist trainees to work in basic science labs will go a 
long way to breaking down the barriers.
Although understand genetic risk factors for NDD is 
essential, we need to move beyond simply identifying risk 
genes and start to tease out how lifestyle, environment, 
etc. aff ect expression of those risk genes. So a major area 
of focus should be on epigenetics and compound risk 
(“multiple hit hypotheses”) in relation to NDD. Another 
key area for development is simple, early stage diagnostics. We need well-validated but simple and cheap 
ways of detecting disease at its earliest stages. An 
example is the link between changes in olfaction and later 
onset dementia and/or PD. If that link can be validated 
then implementing simple “sniff test” protocols into 
routine clinical practice could form the basis of a large 
prospective trial. EPMA and its contacts could coordinate 
and fund such an eff ort. Of course if the trial is successful 
we need to have solutions to off er to patients. So EPMA 
support for on-going searches for targets and thera peutants eff ective in early stage disease is equally important.
Population imaging – a strategy to identify new 
imaging biomarkers in NDD
MRI neuroimaging off ers an elegant approach to fi nd 
new biomarkers in NDD. Good anatomical resolution, 
i.e. white and grey matter distribution, the ability to 
detect vascular changes such as in the microvasculature 
and to depict aspects of brain function or interconnectivity of distinct brain regions while being noninvasive are great advantages of this method.

Th e European Population Imaging Infrastructure 
(EPI2) intends to provide a dedicated environment for 
coordination of data acquisition at diff erent locations or 
diff erent time points in controlled population cohorts to 
be directly compared and communally analysed, thereby 
exponentially increasing the impact of population 
imaging studies and contributing to the aims of PPPM in 
NDD. EPMA, with its broad scope and global coverage 
may facilitate the deployment of necessary tools and the 
collaboration of centres interested and involved in 
population imaging.
Currently, no specifi c biomarkers are available that can 
identify persons at risk for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Imaging parameters are promising, and brain imaging 
may become of major importance to identify people that 
could benefi t from preventive intervention.
Th is development is further supported by current 
advances in data acquisition and analysis, as well as by 
the establishment of larger databases and the fusion of 
imaging with individual clinical data.
An example that supports the use of this approach is 
the fi nding of small vessel disease and microbleeds being 
risk factors for dementia. Th e relevance of this fi nding is 
now under investigation also in interventional trials.
Biomarkers in NDD – requirements and 
development
Th ere is a need of reliable markers that are indicative of a 
pathological process before symptoms manifestation and 
those that could be indicative of disease modifi cation by 
drug therapy.
Many of the biomarkers in the clinics show group 
diff erences (e.g. between normals and diseased), but none 
so far has been able to reliably diagnose Alzheimer’s or 
Parkinson’s diseases in their preclinical stages in an 
individual subject. It is possible that this depends on 
inaccurate diagnosis, since at present the diagnosis 
depends on clinical or pathological phenotypes, which 
suff er however from heterogeneity. Th is, added to the 
phenotypic convergence, indicate the limit of present-day 
understanding of these diseases.
Biomarkers (BMs) may help:
1. to identify individuals “at risk” to direct prevention 
eff orts, greatest impact;
2. to identify people at early disease stage, prior to the 
development of the full clinical phenotype to allow 
intervention with disease modifying therapies which 
may potentially improve clinical outcome;
3. in diff erential diagnosis and in monitoring disease 
progression;
4. to identify pathway-specifi c phenotype (endophenotype): phenotype associated within populations with 
particular diseases mechanisms. Will allow 
enrich ment of clinical trials by classifying subgroups 
and to anticipate who will benefi t;
5. determine the clinical effi cacy of new neuroprotective 
therapies.
Th e main drawback of currently available BMs such as 
neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF)-based BMs 
is that they are only available in large medical centres of 
heavily urbanised areas and are very expensive. Also, 
most clinics are not capable of conducting lumbar punctures to obtain CSF sampling, which is, per se, invasive. 
Th us it will be impossible to apply personalised treatment 
to the vast majority of the diseased population or to catch 
most individuals at an early stage to begin with 
neuroprotection therapy, which in the long-term will be 
cheapest treatment.
Th e major eff orts in neurodegenerative diseases nowadays involve BMs for both preclinical and clinical stages: 
preclinical BMs that help predict clinical therapeutic 
potential, and clinical biomarkers indicative of a target/
biology process and dose selection.
To meet these challenges the following 
recommendations are suggested:
1. to perform genetic predictive studies in combination 
with clinical assessment or/and additional BMs, in 
populations at risk to begin preventive therapy;
2. to identify the preclinical (asymptomatic) stage, since 
at this time window the directed prevention eff orts 
will have the greatest impact. Emerging innovative 
technologies and the understanding of the disease 
process itself will contribute to better prediction and/
or early diagnosis;
3. BMs should be accessible, cost and time eff ective. 
Th is will help to decrease time and cost of clinical 
trials. Strong recommendation to development of less 
invasive and cheaper BMs including serum/plasma 
protein-based BMs and blood transcriptomics-based 
BMs;
4. to associate genetic data with neuroimaging, neurological and biochemical patterns to allow the survey 
of genetic factors related to the rate of progression of 
neurodegenerative disease;
5. neurochemical BMs measured in the periphery 
(proteomics/transcriptomics in blood, CSF and other 
tissues), may be useful adjuncts to imaging and 
clinical assessment tools to provide valuable information about pathogenic mechanisms during clinical 
testing of neuroprotective/disease modifying drugs, 
which is especially relevant to personalised treatment;
6. biomarker tests must be standardised to ensure they 
can be measured correctly and consistently in all 
clinical settings;
7. to underpin public–private collaboration comprising 
scientists from academia and from pharmaceutical

and diagnostics companies, to develop the best 
methods to evaluate the progression from normal 
ageing to preclinical diseases stages and from mild to 
severe stages. It means that companies would need to 
share information with one another, as well as with 
academia.
Optical coherence tomography – an example for 
novel BMs in NDD
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive 
and fast method to demonstrate retinal abnormalities or 
alterations, such as neuro-axonal degeneration, in 
neurodegenerative diseases. OCT can be used to measure 
the retinal nerve fi ber layer thickness, the total macular 
volume and evolves as a method to quantify changes 
within distinct ganglional cell layers of the retina. Retinal 
nerve fi ber layer thinning is a feature in multiple sclerosis 
patients, that also occurs independently from episodes of 
optic neuritis and can therefore be used to assess the 
neurodegenerative portion of diseases in neuro infl ammatory diseases, such as MS. OCT can therefore contribute to a multimodal description of ongoing neurodegeneration, and complements imaging methods such as 
conventional MRI or MR spectroscopy. Studies in a variety 
of neurological diseases, also in their earlier phases, are 
ongoing and will help to evaluate the diagnostic and 
prognostic use of OCT parameters in these diseases.
PPPM aspects in Alzheimer’s disease: “From the 
World Alzheimer Report 2011: The benefi ts of early 
diagnosis and intervention”
Skills and technology are advancing and we are currently 
at a stage where diagnosis can be made increasingly early 
in the disease process. Th is progress should be translated 
to organisational as well as to clinical practice and 
scientifi c research, considering the following points:
• Every country should have a national dementia 
strategy. National dementia strategies should promote 
early diagnosis and intervention through awareness 
raising, training of the health and social care 
workforce, and health system strengthening.
• All primary care services should have basic 
competency in early detection of dementia, making 
and imparting a provisional dementia diagnosis, and 
initial management of dementia.
• Where feasible, networks of specialist diagnostic 
centres should be established to confi rm early stage 
dementia diagnoses and formulate care management 
plans. Practice based registers should be maintained 
in order to audit diagnostic activity, and to promote 
shared care with specialist services.
• In resource-poor settings with limited or no access to 
specialist dementia services, earlier dementia diagnosis can still be achieved, for example through 
scaling up the WHO mental health Gap Action 
Programme (mhGAP) evidence-based inter vention 
guide across primary care services.
• In complex health systems, explicit recommendations 
should be made regarding the roles of primary care, 
memory clinics and community care services in 
dementia diagnosis, early stage and continuing care.
• Th e availability of eff ective drug and non-drug 
interventions for people with dementia and their 
carers should be publicised to health and social care 
professionals through initial training and ongoing 
professional development, and to the public through 
population health promotion, and health and social 
care facilities.
• Purchasers and providers of dementia care services 
should ensure that evidence-based interventions are 
made available to people in the early stage of 
dementia, and audit this process.
• More research should be commissioned and funded, 
including investigation of:
– Th e effi cacy of drug and non-drug interventions 
specifi cally designed to meet the needs of people 
in the early stages of dementia.
– Th e real-world costs and benefi ts of scaling up 
earlier diagnosis and early-stage dementia care 
services, specifi c to the settings in which the 
economic evidence is to be applied.
– Th e eff ect of earlier diagnosis on outcomes 
(overall health, cognitive functioning, quality of 
life, etc.) for people with dementia and their 
carers.
– Th e progress towards closing the ‘treatment gap’.

Summary Report - Special Session 
“Targeted Prevention in Nutrition, Behaviour and 
Physical Activity”
Overview
Targeted prevention is the premise for an eff ective 
personalised medicine strategy, i.e. of the medical model 
proposing the customisation of healthcare. In this 
approach all decisions and practices are tailored to the 
individual patient by use of multi-faceted information, 
ranging from patient’s family history, social circumstances, environment and behaviours and including 
genetics and molecular biomarkers. Predictive and 
preventive medicine is in many regards an extension of 
traditional public health and clinical medicine tools, with 
eff orts for integrating the cutting edge of genetic 
research. Th e prediction of future disease can allow 
health care professionals and the patient themselves to be 
proactive in warranting lifestyle modifi cations (behaviour, 
nutrition and physical activity), enhancing physician’s 
intervention and counselling. In this perspective predictive medicine changes the paradigm of medicine from 
being reactive to being proactive and has the potential to 
signifi cantly decrease the incidence and prevalence of 
both common and rare diseases.
Relationship between diet and physical activity 
patterns, and the major nutrition-related chronic diseases 
are well established by epidemiological and intervention 
studies. Both are evidence-based approaches, mostly still 
on-going and starting in recent decades. On these basis 
recommendations are made to help prevent death and 
disability from these diseases, and are validated and 
refi ned by clinical practice and population intervention 
measures. Population nutrient intake and physical 
activity goals should contribute to the development of 
regional strategies and national guidelines to reduce the 
burden of nutrition related diseases: obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, neurodegenerative disease, several forms of cancer, osteoporosis and 
dental disease. Th e place of nutrigenomics, i.e. the study 
of the eff ects of foods and food constituents on gene 
expression and, more, of the infl uence of genetic variation 
on nutrition stems from the possibility of correlating 
gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
with nutrient’s absorption, metabolism, elimination or 
biological eff ects. Th e ultimate goal is to develop rational 
means to optimise nutrition, with respect to the subject’s 
genotype. Actually, genomics is of help in specifi c 
widespread conditions, such as methylenetetra hydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms, and the 
derived procedures are useful for preventing stroke, 
infertility, malformations and several adult’s disease.
Th e research of biomarkers of the early phase of dietrelated diseases has the aim of warranting nutritional 
intervention to restore health. Since nutrigenomics 
investigates the eff ect of diff erent genetic predispositions 
in the development of diseases, once a marker has been 
found and measured in individuals, the extent to which a 
person is susceptible to the development of a disease will 
be quantifi ed. As a consequence, personalised dietary 
recommendation can be given for individuals. Th e aims 
of nutrigenomics also includes being able to demonstrate 
the eff ect of bioactive food compounds on health and the 
eff ect of healthy foods on health. Th is should lead to the 
development of functional foods, a still controversial 
concept, that could keep people healthy according to 
their individual needs.
Despite nutrigenomics has been associated with the 
idea of personalised nutrition based on genotype, the 
present evidence and expert guidelines are still based on 
more traditional epidemiological and clinical studies. 
Actually mostly epidemiology allows to defi ne the eff ects 
of a nutritional regime, assessing causality/relationship 
between specifi c nutrients and specifi c nutrient regimes 
(diets) on human health.
Expert recommendation, counselling and dietary 
prescription for nutrition are tailored mostly according 
to age, gender, climate, work and associated or foreseeable disease. Th e lines take into consideration alimentary education by media and in the schools, the 
paediatrician-family doctors networks, specifi c intervention in the workplace and in the schools and other types 
of interventions, driven by national govern ments or local 
administrations. Th e main drawback: the success rate of 
intervention against traditional habits and hostile 
marketing actions, promoting “unhealthy” dietary and 
lifestyle habits is still very limited or inconsistent. In this 
context power of outcome analysis is of paramount 
relevance and relies on the consistency of the guidelines 
adherence assessment and on the robustness of outcome 
indexes chosen. When pertinent “markers” are unreliable, 
the maintenance of any intervention is unfounded and 
guidelines easily disregarded (Figure 3)
In this perspective the contribution of EU is crucial, 
because there is the potential of sharing objectives – 
regarding healthy nutrition – through integrated 
intervention and research programmes involving several 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14

EU Commissions: research and innovation, agriculture, 
health and consumers, education and culture and others.
Analogous evidences, regarding relationship with 
disease onset and progression are available for physical 
exercise and behavioural profi les (lifestyle, habits): nonetheless, in these fi elds guidelines and recommendation 
are still more vague, and more detail and personalisation 
are, obviously, needed. National interventions are and 
were performed, with campaigns against alcohol, smoking and – primarily – sedentary life, achieving variable 
accomplishment of the goals. Eff orts were concentrated 
on children and youngsters but it is evident that also an 
active old age is benefi cial for the quality of life: actual 
physical exercise prescription instead of or along more 
expensive therapeutic approaches is an aff ordable 
medical practice; it has a positive cost-benefi t analysis 
when the outcome are population and individual quality 
of life and appropriate resource use. Regrettably, 
national/regional interventions are extremely fragmented 
and erratic: the need of coherent EU policy is central and 
implies shared directives through health, education, 
mobility and research commissions.
Behaviour and physical fi tness are in some way 
genetically-conditioned, but information and relationship, and as a consequence, markers, are scarcely defi ned 
and not yet established. Th e present epidemic of obesity 
and related disease is the consequence of nutritional, 
behavioural and sedentary life habits promoted by social 
organisations at the family, school, work, leisure and even 
sport level, by an hostile marketing, promoting unhealthy 
diets, by misleading or unreliable information and by 
“traditional”, local or acquired, habits. Th e limits of 
infrastructures aimed at the mobility of citizens are 
mostly important. Knowledge and skills of health professionals in physical exercise prescribing is still insuffi cient 
(Figure 4).
For the near future it is awaited that neuroimaging 
methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
positron emission tomography (PET) will provide further 
basic evidence regarding the still largely unknown interactions between physical exercise/dietary interventions 
and brain function, both in health and disease conditions 
aff ecting the central nervous system. Understanding 
these basic mechanisms is considered as a fundamental 
prerequisite for more concerted exercise and/or dietary 
prescriptions, particularly in at-risk subjects or pro dromal phases of neurodegenerative disease conditions. It 
remains to be shown, however, whether neuroimaging 
will also provide reliable in vivo “biomarkers” for 
determining eff ects of exercise on an individual, 
personalised basis; i.e. whether neuroimaging parameters 
can be reliably used in an individualised work fl ow for 
determining eff ectiveness of preventive and/or therapeutic exercise and/or dietary interventions.
All determinants of health – genetic, food, behaviour, 
physical exercise, environment - are closely inter-related 
and the need of overlap when experts provide outlook 
and recommendation is evident.
Th e unfavourable contribution of pollution and environment is manifest in allergic and autoimmune disease, 
cancer, skin disorders, stress-related and cardiovascular 
diseases: many of these substances and environment 
pollutants are key quality markers of home/work 
environment and food.
Th e last decades have shown a remarkable good 
correlation between the high levels of air pollution 
(smoking, smoke exposure, NO2
, SO2, O3, diesel exhaust 
particles) and the high allergy and asthma incidence. 
Smoking and Diesel Exhaust Particles (DEP) were shown 
to seriously increase the titers of the allergy-related IgE 
antibodies, predisposing to skin allergy and allergic 
asthma. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has an

action. Figure 4. Determinants of active-sedentary life.

adjuvant role in children: pre- and postnatal exposure to 
tobacco smoke leads, by the age of 3 years, to an 
increased risk of developing sensitisations to food 
allergens; avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke only 
during pregnancy (but not after giving birth) does not 
signifi cantly alter the odds ratio of sensitisation. In 
ragweed allergic persons simultaneous exposure to DEP 
and the main ragweed allergen, leads to a 16-fold increase 
in the antigen-specifi c IgE titer. Th is example underlines 
two arms of prevention: reduction in the anthropogenic 
pollution, as well as a good control over the spreading of 
foreign plant species. Both organic and inorganic 
mercury was shown in humans to trigger urticaria, 
dermatitis, and correlate with raised IgE titers against 
grass pollen. Dental restoration using amalgam is 
considered to be the largest source of mercury exposure 
for most people in developed countries. Th e amounts of 
mercury in blood and milk of lactating women correlates 
with the number of amalgam fi llings. At least in the Baltic 
area, on a second line, the most important fi sh 
consumption biomarker was methylmercury among the 
women. As mercury tends to accumulate in the foetus/
newborn, both during pregnancy as well as during 
nursing, small children are even more exposed. Th e 
genotype is known to have an infl uence on the adjuvant 
eff ect of DEP on allergies. European and Asian studies 
show that elevated lead levels positively correlate with 
the total IgE level in children, thus predisposing to an 
allergic background. Studies of the last decade document 
a strong accumulation of transitional metals in tumour 
tissues, underlining the role of these toxic elements in 
cancer aetiology. Further associations between toxic 
metals and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson, 
Alzheimer, and autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematodes, scleroderma, Hashimoto thyroiditis, ALS etc. 
are well documented in the medical literature. Various 
chemicals can not only induce allergies, but also can 
trigger “pseudoallergic reactions”, which activate diff erent 
allergy pathways without involvement of the immune 
system. Pesticides, like Dieldrin, DTT, DDE, Heptachlor 
and diff erent PCBs can lead to release of infl ammation 
mediators like histamine and leukotrienes in skin, 
neurodegenerative and environmental patients. Diff erent 
genetic polymorphisms are involved in the human 
susceptibility to such chemicals.
Th e above-mentioned toxic agents become a new and 
important set of biomarkers of evident relevance in the 
biomonitoring of allergic, neurodegenerative, auto immune 
and cancer patients. Clinical conditions refl ect the 
interaction between the environmental factors and the 
genetic constellation of the aff ected person. Simultaneous 
analysis of these interactions gives an important tool in 
the personalised diagnostic, prevention and therapy: 
such research topics should become a priority.
A word of caution. Human nature is more complex 
than our genetic make-up, even conditioned and 
modifi ed by “nurture” and environment, and includes 
psychological and spiritual aspects as well as physical 
ones. To be individualised, diagnosis and treatment need 
to take into consideration the human beings in their 
multi-faceted expression. Th e challenge for medicine 
therefore extends beyond biomedicine. Th e whole health 
system needs to set in motion a process whose central 
aim is the care of the individual patient by a personcentred medicine approach.
Traditional medicine is the sum total of knowledge, 
skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and 
experiences indigenous to diff erent cultures that are used 
to maintain health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, 
improve or treat physical and mental illnesses. Traditional 
medical systems that have been adopted by other 
populations (outside their indigenous culture) are often 
termed alternative, complementary or non-conventional 
medicine. National laws and rules, international organisations, independent and commercial subjects are 
actively involved in the integration of several form of 
traditional medicine into the national healthcare systems: 
the need and the challenge is to promote the proper use 
of traditional medicine by developing and providing 
international standards, technical guidelines and 
methodologies. Assessment tools must be tailored to 
confi rm with the eff ective predictive, preventive and/or 
personalised medical outcomes of diff erent non-con ventional medical cultures, as single or global inter ven tions, 
compared to the current best practice approaches. 
Intervention based on cultural and anthropological 
understanding of diff erences, inequalities, shared needs 
and credence can be more eff ective, aff ordable and compliant. Moreover, if acknowledged as part of primary 
healthcare, they will increase access to care and preserve 
knowledge and resources. It is mandatory to ensure 
patient safety by upgrading adequately the skills and 
knowledge of traditional medicine providers and by 
validating and certifying professionals, beyond the plain 
fact that these health practices share and claim holistic, 
person-centred and inclusive approaches (Figure 5).
Awareness of the advantages of sustainability based on 
and environmental bioethics, is becoming a translational 
mechanism equally important of other fi elds of translational science and medicine. Prerequisites of health 
include the promotion of healthy practices respectful of 
cultural and environmental diff erences of populations, 
age groups, and individual biographical context. Th ese 
practices should allow people to take better control of 
their life, generating and maintaining their own health.
Overcoming illness can also become the foundation for 
better future health if includes empowerment of 
resilience. Th is is a dynamic process whereby individuals

exhibit positive behavioural adaptation when they 
encounter signifi cant adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, 
or even signifi cant sources of stress. Th e enhancement of 
resilience increases opportunity and capacity of 
individuals to manage their psychological, social, cultural, 
and physical resources that may sustain their well-being 
and capacity, individually and collectively. Th is allows for 
planning and negotiation for these resources to be 
provided and experienced in culturally meaningful ways.
Relationships that provide care and support, create love 
and trust, and off er encouragement, both within and 
outside the family, capacity to make realistic plans, 
having a positive awareness of self, improving communications skills, and the capacity to manage strong feelings 
and impulses modify the negative eff ects of adverse life 
situations. Personalisation of choice of diagnostic tests 
and treatments leads to less waste, reduced costs and 
greater satisfaction. In order to evaluate the success of 
such broadened medical inter ventions parameters need 
to be developed and adopted for assessing quality of life 
of patients and caregivers in terms of sustainable change, 
satisfaction, prevention of burnout as well as costeff ectiveness and technological excellence.
Knowledge and skills focused to behavioural cognitive 
interventions aimed at coping, adherence and selfeffi cacy of patients and health professionals are already 
available in few countries and institutions. Th ey must be 
implemented by supranational directives obliging to 
validate assessment of methodologies and outcome. 
Presently used dietary- and physical exercise-assessment 
methods often present diffi culties for researchers and 
respondents, and misreporting errors are common. 
Methods using information and communication 
techno lo gies (ICT) may improve quality and accuracy: 
the already available friendly and most experienced 
applica tions (including those for smart-phones) should 
be encouraged and validated in their outcomes.
Recommendations
1. Offi cial nutritional-physical activity guidelines at 
national and international level are very similar and 
almost coincident. Nonetheless, adherence is limited 
everywhere and eff ective individual/epidemiological 
assessment diffi cult and scarcely comparable. Th erefore, friendly and aff ordable model of lifestyle, 
physical exercise and nutritional assessment must be 
developed, with tools shared and suitable to be used 
at diff erent level of professional expertise, for 
increasing skills and expertise aimed at enhancing 
actively pro-resilience healing approaches .
2. Th e commitment of health professionals in pro-active 
intervention for the enhancement of healthy nutrition 
and behaviour, and for promoting physical exercise in 
a sustainable way is insuffi cient. Th is is also due to the 
bias that lifestyle intervention are specialised jobs of 
dieticians, psychologists and physical trainer. 
Dissemination of knowledge of the strong innovative 
advancement in the interpretation of mechanisms 
and eff ects of food profi les and physical activity, 
stemming from molecular biology and functional 
imaging must be warranted. Th is will give motivation 
and scientifi c credit to medical doctors when prescribing, as actual medicines, diets, physical exercise 
regimens and behavioural changes.

recommendations.

3. Clinical nutrition and the epidemiological basis of the 
present knowledge on risk factors are presently two of 
the most neglected disciplines in the medical school 
curricula, worldwide, and in the continuous medical 
education (CME) actions. Th e recognition of available 
and eff ective clinical, epidemiological and teaching 
expertise, at least in Europe, and the support of the 
tools adequate for training and boosting appropriate 
skills are the premise for any intervention.
4. Th e use of multimedia in lifelong professional 
curricula, including e-learning expertise and tools 
focus to telemedicine monitoring and prescribing of 
diets and physical activity, must be appropriately 
selected, assessed and promoted, providing diff erent 
and tailored professional tools (encompassing also 
fl ow-charts and decision trees) for medical doctors.
5. Th e European Commission should envisage supporting multi-center translational research activities 
conjoining epidemiological, clinical, and multimodal 
neuroimaging assessment of diets, physical exercise 
regimens, and behavioural interventions.
Th is type of translational research is expected to help 
unravel the promising, but largely unknown mechanisms 
by which healthy nutrition, behaviour and physical 
activity impact positively on the central nervous system 
and, ultimately, mediate sustained preventive and even 
therapeutic eff ects in healthy ageing and pathological 
conditions of the central nervous system.
Tailored medical practice is the product of tailored 
medical research, education and training.

The Conception of Anti-Ageing Section in EPMA
Introduction
Current scientifi c and technological progress and stability 
of social and economical spheres leads to increasing life 
expectancy in Europe. Th e number of residents aged over 
60  years is expected to be doubled by 2020. Th e 
retirement age is shifted but majority of aged people keep 
on working, study, go to fi tness-centres and travel. In our 
days many people prefer preventive healthcare measures 
against pharmacological and hospital-based medicine. 
Scientifi c researchers and medical doctors are facing the 
problem – to develop the comprehensive approach 
improving life quality, maintaining social activity, mental 
and physical health of the mature population, as well as 
preserving mental, physical and social health of young 
people. Th erefore, concepts of anti-ageing medicine 
become a modern trend for researchers and healthcare 
industry.
Currently there are three main directions acknowledged in the anti-ageing medicine, namely
1. Th e direction of fundamental interdisciplinary 
research (study the mechanisms of social and stressinduced diseases, mental and physical diseases of 
older people).
2. Functional Medicine of regulation - prevention, early 
detection and correction of social and stress-induced 
diseases and syndromes - chronic fatigue, metabolic 
syndrome, CVD, hypertension, diabetes, infarct, 
osteoporosis, neurodegenerative diseases. Th ey are 
associated with age, but environmental factors and 
lifestyle serve as provoking and triggering factors for 
diseases of “non-optimal adaptation”.
3. In important role plays aesthetic medicine (plastic 
surgery, SPA, fi tness, wellness).
Th e majority of diseases are classifi ed now as multifactorial, being associated with hereditary predisposition 
and life-style that require innovative approaches by 
integrative medicine. Consequently, anti-ageing medicine 
based on holistic approach, integrates knowledge in 
various areas of clinical disciplines, and also pays much 
attention to a new fi eld of science - predictive medicine. 
Individualised patient profi ling helps to identify persons 
at-risk and predicts pathologies before a clinical onset.
Innovative approaches for studying ageing 
process, and developing anti-ageing technologies 
to extend life span and increase life quality
Breakthrough in any fi eld of research is interconnected 
with development of innovative technologies and 
methodo logical approaches. Th e study of ageing, stressresistance/adaptation needs to undergo a number of 
technological improvements based on the use of 
advanced bio-informatics and instrumental tools as well 
as new model systems.
Because ageing is a systemic condition, priority must 
be given to systemic approach to population’s wide 
research of age-related changes occurring at the level of 
complete metabolome, proteome and epi/genome. It is 
necessary to develop uniform interdisciplinary understand able terms and defi nitions for describing verifi ed 
actual data, research protocols and results. It is a great 
challenge for professionals, since generally accepted defi -
nitions of healthy longevity and age-related pathologies 
do not exist now.
Methods to evaluate biological age and 
eff ectiveness of personalised therapies
Adequate health related markers and markers of disease 
predispositions need to be found. For this purpose we 
need to study status of healthy and aged persons in order 
to understand their mental and internal conditions 
(homeo stasis), peculiarities of constitution and phenotype. Health quality markers are described in Chinese 
medicine in specifi c symbols potentially might be 
adopted and translated into the common neuro / 
physiological “language”.
Section of personalised predictive diagnostics
Methods of diagnosis of optimal postural stereotype 
(optimal body statics), optimal cerebral metabolism, 
criteria of optimal lymph circulation and intersticial 
transport are valuable for practical application. Further, 
the method of early preclinical diagnosis of stressinduced conditions (postural stress, “endoecological 
crisis”) – non-specifi c grain for clinic behaviour of multifactorial diseases are well elaborated. However, the global 
standardisation as the essential element for the procedure 
tailored to the patient is currently missing. Many 
laboratories off er services for identifi cation of partial 
personal profi les by sequencing selected genes (ONCOgen, OSTEO-gen, CARDIO-gen, NEURO-gen, LIPIDgen, WEIGHT-gen, etc.). However, this information is far 
from being complete for clinical decisions: a number of 
post-genomic parameters should be essentially included 
into really predictive profi ling. As the next step, 
molecular biological parameters should become 
correlated with clinical status to identify individual risks 
(e.g. predisposition to breast cancer) and to estimate 
potential impacts of postural and lymphodynamic 
disturbances in clinical onset of the disease. Hence, it is 
known that endo-ecological (interstitial) crisis and 
immune defi ciency increase the risk of development of 
infl ammatory, degenerative, oncologic diseases and other. 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14
Page 40 of 53

A correct interpretation of phenotypic, constitutional 
and molecular biomarkers to predict individual 
predispositions should be the issue of a series of largescale studies.
Personalised prevention and treatment
Th ere is a huge number of fi tness-, wellness-, SPA-centres 
and beauty salons for people who would like to extend 
their healthy period of life and, therefore, ready invest 
good money into preventive healthcare. Unfortunately 
for a number of those centres, the general level of 
preventive healthcare services is far from being optimal. 
Hence, according to the statistics collected for female 
clients, after some procedures a great portion of women 
feel discomfort with mammary glands (mastopathy) and 
suff er from negative side-eff ects. Th is is frequently a real 
problem of megalopolises. For examples, every year in 
Moscow, over 100.000 women consult doctors on diff erent mammary gland problems appearing after regular 
treatments in SPA-centres and beauty salons in 15-20% of 
all cases. On one side women with predisposition to 
breast diseases, combination of muscle-tonic syndromes, 
signs of lymph congestion in upper aperture area need 
individualised preventive programmes such as professionally made detoxifi cation, lymph drainage, etc. On the 
other side, preventive healthcare requires professionals 
well educated in multidisciplinary aspects such as contraindications, predispositions, phenotypic features, individual molecular profi ling, etc.
Education
To promote the above listed aspects with the professionals and general population, the section aims at 
preparing the educational project at both professional 
and user levels. Th is is also the issue for national and 
international medical sessions and congresses related to 
the neuroscience, rehabilitation, health protection and 
anti-ageing medicine. Th e EPMA Journal (BioMedCentral, 
UK) is recommended to open a specialised section 
dedicated to the emerging fi eld of PPPM in anti-ageing 
medicine.
Innovative technologies and ethics
Innovative approaches such as evidence-based methods 
of express diagnosis for postural stress and “endoecological crisis” are recommended to be used in order to 
promote the participative element in PPPM and motivate 
patients to undergo individually created preventive 
programmes in health and disease. Th e adequate quality 
of the dialogue “doctor-patient” should correspond to the 
principles of medical ethics to apply innovative approaches 
of predictive diagnostics.
The priority approach
Th e activities of anti-ageing section are planned in the 
context of post-genomic era and epigenetic bio/medical 
research to study environmental and internal factors, 
ethical aspects of PPPM, cultural particularities and 
impact of personal responsibility for health. Th e 
professional set-up is the following: integrative medicine, 
neurosciences, immunology, CVD, oncology, sport 
medicine, imaging and “omics”-technologies, economy of 
personalised medicine, medical ethics.
Professional interactions
Th e anti-ageing section’s working plan and achievements 
will be discussed and regulated in the course of meetings 
and symposiums coordinated by the EPMA-Board.

Determining the Priorities of the Predictive, 
Preventive & Personalised Medicine in Dentistry
Th is chapter results from the specialised EPMA section 
of DPPPD (Department of Predictive, Preventive and 
Personalised Medicine in Dentistry) Symposium held in 
Voronezh, Russia in February 2012. Th e meeting gathered 
19 delegations from diff erent European regions and 
countries and created a brainstorming event to the 
eff ective promotion of PPPM in Dentistry.
Early and predictive diagnostics
In dentistry, this kind of diagnosis is not common, but 
there are some methods that fi t to the concept: simple 
and advanced stomatoscopy, express cytobacterioscopy, 
electroodontodiagnosis, etc. In this context, a list of 
examinations for persons at-risk should be considered:
• conservative dentistry for children and adults (dental 
caries, periodontal diseases, diseases of the oral mucosa, 
etc.)
• oral surgery and maxillofacial surgery (tumour processes, arthropathy of maxillofacial area, abscesses, 
phlegmons, etc.)
• prosthetic dentistry (atrophy of soft and hard jaw 
tissues, partial and fully edentulism)
• dentistry in common systemic disorders (metabolic 
syndrome with secondary complications, etc.).
Risk assessment and targeted prevention
For the risk assessment in dental disorders, an individual 
patient profi ling is particularly recommended, since some 
predispositions may be detected at early stages before 
clinical onset of the pathology followed by the most 
eff ective measures of the targeted prevention. For example, 
prediction and prevention of periodontal diseases in 
patients with diabetes mellitus and disease pre-stages.
Personalised patient treatments
Th ere is a huge number of methods and approaches to 
treat diseases in dental practice, which needs new 
guidelines promoting treatments tailored to the person, 
i.e. more personalised dental approaches. For example, 
the diagnosis of caries (a dental disorder aff ecting 50-90% 
of populations worldwide) involves 52 identifi ed but 18 
most signifi cant clinical parameters upon their ranking. 
Undoubtedly, personalised treatment should be carried 
out according to the diagnostic evaluation of individual 
indicators to improve the treatment outcomes.
Interactive pathologies and co-morbidities in 
dental disorders
It is well known that almost all human pathological 
conditions might be present in the oral cavity. Early 
symptoms of organ pathologies (such as changes in the 
condition of the tongue at the fi rst signs of diabetes, 
initial changes in the taste sensitivity in oncologic 
diseases) can be detected by means of duly organised 
preventive diagnostics in dentistry. On the other hand, 
intestinal dysbacteriosis detection may facilitate early 
detection of dysbacteriosis of the oral cavity, and 
consequent development of caries, gingival and oral 
mucosa disease progression. Th e research of the 
multifunctional biomarkers in dentistry should be forced 
through research activities to reply currently still open 
questions about physiological and pathologies interactions in diagnosis and eff ective treatments.
Personalised nutrition for prevention of frequent 
dental pathologies
Nowadays the infl uence of colouring nutritional liquids 
such as Coke, Fanta, and others for the tooth enamel 
colour and periodontal condition is getting more and 
more determined. Imbalanced nutrition and non-optimal 
life-style obligatory belong to the most frequent risk 
factors in onset of dental disorders. Recommendations 
for personalised nutrition should be the essential part of 
the overall dental care.
Economical impacts of predictive, preventive and 
personalised treatment in dentistry
Preliminary calculations of the economical impacts 
provide a view to tremendous cost reductions in overall 
healthcare by introducing the concept of PPPM in 
dentistry into routine medical practice. For the most 
common disorders such as infl ammation related diseases, 
chronic infections, diabetes, etc. a minimum of 4-5-fold 
reduction of the overall healthcare expenses is predicted.
Medical care in rare (dental) disorders
Rare dental disorders such as Papillon-Lefevre Syndrome 
represent a particular fi eld, where the practical application of PPPM is strongly recommended and should be 
eff ectively promoted by the specialised EPMA section. 
Correct diagnosis and eff ective treatment of rare dental 
disorder provide us with the unique opportunity to create 
optimal strategic approaches for the personalisation of 
the medical care in dentistry.
Psychological aspects and ethics in PPPM
Special attention needs to be paid to the ethically correct 
patient treatment approach that is well adapted to and 
supportive for individual patient cohorts, in particular 
for individuals with mental disabilities and retardation, 
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14

pregnancy, elderly patients, children and youth as well as 
patients with severe systemic pathologies such as Down’s 
syndrome and others.
DPPPD as the example of the regulated 
professional interactions within EPMA
Th e DPPPD networks the top scientists working with the 
PPPM related concepts and leading professionals in 
Dentistry.
Structuring the EPMA DPPPD specialised section
Th e Voronezh Academy as the EPMA-Representative in 
“PPPM in Dentistry” is in duty to structure the section 
with the EPMA support. Th e process of the section 
structuring is triggered in 2012 with the DPPPD meeting 
in Voronezh, February 2012.
Instruments to eff ectively promote the fi eld of “PPPM in 
Dentistry”
• Promotion of the PPPM related expertise through 
EPMA: EPMA has a particular interest to develop 
long-term professional collaborations with 
organisations awarded with the status “institutional 
member” of EPMA. Due to this highly eff ective form 
of collaboration, institutional member may expect a 
particular promotion through the EPMA consortia.
• Publicity: EPMA-website, magazines, newsletters, 
newspapers and TV programmes around the world, 
interviews with representatives, etc.
• Inter/national scientifi c meetings: Regular EPMA 
World Congress, EPMA-related professional 
meetings, PPPM-related conference and meetings in 
specialised sections, etc.
• Scientifi c articles: Scientifi c articles dedicated to the 
whole spectrum of PPPM in Dentistry should 
regularly update professional information about 
current achievements, provide outlook for further 
developments and, therefore, create a robust platform 
for professional recommendations and new guidelines 
in the branch. Th e EPMA Journal (published by 
BioMedCentral in UK as the “open access” journal 
indexed in PubMed amongst others) publishes 
review-articles, position papers, Editorial articles, 
Letters to Editor in the category “PPPM in Dentistry” 
and others. Any category of PPPM-related scientifi c 
articles published in other international journals may 
be advised by the EPMA experts and receive the 
EPMA-label being peer-reviewed and approved by 
nominated Representative(s) of the EPMA-Dentistry 
Section.
• Education: In the years 2012-2015 creation of 
specialised didactic materials for PPPM-related educa tional programmes within the book-series “Advances 
in PPPM” (EPMA/Springer, Editor-in-Chief: Prof Dr 
O Golubnitschaja); based on corresponding didactic 
materials, creation of educational programmes. 
Arrangement of master-classes and practical training 
courses, development and implementation of 
facultative education programmes for professionals 
are all within the framework of DPPPD as the 
specialised EPMA Section.
• Grant application: Reasonable professional partnerships are regularly discussed at the EPMA telephone 
conferences and meetings in view of scientifi c 
projects and grant applications. Th e thematic set-up 
of the EPMA-labelled proposals are performed in 
accordance to the expertise acknowledged by the 
EPMA consortia (see the instruments listed above) in 
terms of compatibility of partners and innovation of 
the objectives. Proposals with the status “EPMAlabelled” receive a special priority by professional 
advices for appropriate funding programmes and 
instruments.
Topics recommended for upcoming scientifi c 
projects
• Development of integrative medical approaches in 
dentistry by PPPM with multidisciplinary expertise of 
professional groups to be involved
• Innovative technological tools relevant for early and 
predictive diagnosis of dental disorders followed by 
elaborated measures for targeted prevention in 
groups at-risk
• Innovative treatment approaches tailored to the person
• Development of PPPM related approaches in 
diagnostics and multifunctional treatments of rare 
(dental) disorders

Summary Report - Special Session 
“Patient-Specifi c Modelling”
Introduction
Th e individualisation of medicine and healthcare appears 
to be following a general societal trend. Th e terms 
“personalised medicine” and “personal health” are used 
to describe this process. It must be emphasised, however, 
that personalised medicine is not limited to 
pharmacogenomics as it is sometimes defi ned, but that 
the spectrum of methods and tools for personalised 
medicine is much broader, see Figure 7.
Applications range from individualised diagnostics, 
patient-specifi c pharmacological therapy, therapy with 
individual prostheses and implants to therapy approaches 
using autologous cells, and from patient model-based 
therapy in the operating room including electronic 
patient records [1] to the individual care of patients in 
their home environment [2] with the use of technical 
systems and services.
Although in some areas practical solutions have already 
been developed, most applications will not have fully 
evolved for many years to come, as their development 
and adoption in clinical practice will depend on close 
cooperation, in particular between medicine and 
informatics.
Medical and information technologies are essential to 
personalised medicine and personal health. Th e synergy 
of these two technologies to generate and process 
information about the patient provides the basis for most 
tools and systems employed in individualised medicine.
Th e information gathered in healthcare and related 
fi elds, however, becomes more complex than at any other 
time in the history of medicine. It is expected that even 
more data will be generated thanks to the “omics” fi elds, 
complemented by the data on the nutrition components, 
herbal components, medical drugs, sensor data and the 
data on the particular interrelations between all these 
components. Continually increasing complexity of 
medical information in healthcare together with the 
rising impact of personalised medicine clearly catalyses 
closer cooperation not only between medicine and 
informatics but also with mathematics, knowledge 
engineering, communication technology, statistics, science 
of complexity, linguistics, ethics and other related fi elds.
Integrated (model-based) patient care
Often, semantics of research and clinical data is represented implicitly and is hidden in unstructured and 
disconnected descriptions of the data or just in the heads 
of human experts (researchers and caregivers). Meaningful semantics includes rich metadata, i.e. the predefi ned 
structure of data in medical records. In addition, it is 
extremely important to explicitly represent the patientspecifi c context of each discrete data item and how it 
relates to other data items, as well as how it fi ts within 
the entire health history of an individual.
A constantly growing stream of raw data is available 
today in both research and clinical environments, e.g. 
DNA sequences along with rare variants in research and 
sensor data along with personal alerts in healthcare. Th e 
representation of such raw data should adhere as much 
as possible to common and agreed-upon reference 
models (e.g. HL7/ISO RIM – Reference Information 
Model) and, depending on the clinical domain of 
discourse, to still to be defi ned Patient-Specifi c Models 
(PSM). Th is allows any observation to be represented in 
the same way in terms of its attributes such as ID, timing, 
code, value, method and status, as well as standard 
representation of clinical statements (e.g. observation of 
gall bladder acute infl ammation indicated procedure of 
cholecystectomy or EGFR variations cause resistance to 
Gefi tinib), where implicit semantics can become explicit 
and thus processable by decision support applications.
Wherever possible, patients are diagnosed and treated 
according to medical guidelines based on the general 
knowledge derived from observations of large 
populations of patients and controls, i.e. evidence-based 
medicine (EBM). Th ere are still wide variations between 
individual patients, in terms of anatomy, physiology, 
metabolism, and genetics, that cannot be accounted for, 
or factored into medical procedure decisions, by EBM, or 
by standard methodologies of patient assessment that are 
currently available to physicians and the healthcare 
systems.
In real-life clinical settings a combination of all 
available medical information obtained from the medical 
record, scripts and elsewhere, has to be mentally 
integrated by the physician to create an abstract 
presentation or “model” of the patient, which must be as 
close as possible to reality to serve as a basis for decision 
making with respect to the medical procedure to be 
followed. Th is is commonly known as clinical judgment.
Transcending this traditional medical record centric 
activity, i.e. information component listing and summary 
report of the patient/human, we propose a strategy 
towards an ICT-based holistic presentation of the 
individual patient and corresponding medical process/
procedure redesigns within a given domain of discourse, 
such as cardiovascular, neurological or oncologic 
disorders - see Figure 8.
Golubnitschaja et al. The EPMA Journal 2012, 3:14 
http://www.epmajournal.com/content/3/14
Page 44 of 53

With this holistic presentation of a specifi c patient, 
based on an importance rating driven collection of 
patient data as well as appropriate mathematical modelling methods, such as probabilistic relational models and 
process models as well as advanced ICT enabling tools, 
the practice of medicine will be substantially transformed 
towards model-based medical evidence (MBME) 
providing transparency of clinical situa tions, processes 
and decisions for patient and physician.
Th e patient-specifi c model is the central construct for a 
patient within such a personalised medicine 
environment, in order to provide a clinician with a realtime representation of critical information about the 
patient. Th e data of the patient-specifi c model reside 
within a probabilistic patient-specifi c database (PPD). 
Th e fi elds of the database consist of
a) absolute patient attributes, such as name, medical 
record number, etc.

b) descriptive patient attributes, such as biomarkers 
from the *omics and medical images; graphical 
physio logical information, such as ECG or EEG; 
physiological values within expected value ranges; 
results of biochemical and biomedical modelling, in 
the form of results of equations; pathological fi ndings, 
etc. and
c) probabilistic patient attributes, such as probability of 
tumour response to treatment, which are expressed in 
terms of probability and confi dence level; conditional 
tables; etc.
Real-time functions on a patient-specifi c model will 
require the development or modifi cation of a new form 
of database: a probabilistic database which will allow the 
utilisation of probabilistic data structures. Th is will 
incorporate a database design and a database 
management system which allows probabilistic database 
functions and storage capabilities.
Recommendations
1. Research and development on functional interactive 
models for an individual patient’s health, allowing for 
prediction of potential health problems under diverse 
model situations [3].
2. Research and development on the predictive and 
preventive potential of the new IT tools for in vitro
and in vivo diagnostics and consequent evaluation 
and implementation of these tools in daily healthcare. 
Th is must progress in concert with in silico diagnostics - active computer processing of acquired 
analytical data, patient profi le data, medical information and other related data in order to suggest 
reliable prediction and treatment of the patient [4].
3. Research and development on a “holistic approach” - 
a simultaneous systematic analysis providing a broad 
insight into various phenomena in order to reveal the 
underlying biomedical rules. Special emphasis should 
be given to the coupling of computer sciences, 
complexity theory, non linear dynamics and logic 
theory to enable the development of learning 
machines that extract the underlying rules and thus 
facilitate prediction that improves its accuracy while 
in usage [5].
4. Research and development on PSMs based on probabilistic graphical and related models enabling a 
mathematically structured integration of patient 
information from various independent sources in real 
time [6].
5. Development of probabilistic database management 
systems. While there are currently no commercial 
proba bilistic database systems, several research 
prototypes exist and should be evaluated for their 
usability to manage PSMs [6].
6. Encourage developments that healthcare providers 
are not the legal patient record keepers and let new 
entities (independent health record banks - IHRB) be 
the sole health record keepers, sustaining a single 
EHR for an individual no matter where this individual 
has been treated. Th ere should be multiple and 
competing IHRBs that will be regulated by new 
legislation that shifts the obligation of medical record 
keeping from healthcare providers to IHRBs [7].

Summary Report - Special Session 
“Biomarker Discovery, Validation, Standardisation 
and Practical Application in Medical Practice”
Most experts of the section are involved in the discovery 
and identifi cation of biomarkers in preclinical and clinical 
research across academia, government agencies, and the 
pharmaceutical industry. Preliminary topics of interest 
belong mainly to practically incorporating biomarkers 
into pharmaceuticals and diagnostics development, their 
potential applications in diseases management such as 
early prediction, detection and prevention of medical 
conditions.
Statements belongs to a) defi ne biomarkers, b) biomarker identifi cation and characterisation, c) its current 
lack for practical application in medical practice, d) 
outlook/trends and e) request and recommendations.
a) Statements to defi ne biomarkers
Th ere are many diff erent ways to defi ne biomarkers based 
on molecular properties, application, and methods. Th e 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest an inclusive 
defi nition for biomarkers as “a characteristic that is 
objectively measured and evaluated as a indicator of 
normal biologic process, pathogenic process, or 
pharmacologic response to a therapeutic intervention“. 
Th erefore a biomarker can be DNA, mRNA, protein, 
metabolite, or lipid. Th ese certain increased the complexity of biomarker research. Based on the application and 
suggested outcome/information, biomarker can therefore 
be classifi ed in diff erent clinical categories:
• Diagnostic Marker: identifi es a disease
• Predicative Marker: identifi es disease predisposition
• Prognostic Marker: predicts outcome
• Stratifi cation Marker: predicts drug response 
(responder/non responder)
• Effi cacy Marker: measures drug response
• Surrogate Endpoint: measures outcome
• Toxicity Marker: detects drug-induced toxicity
• etc.
b) Statements to biomarker identifi cation and 
characterisation
Novel innovative technologies have been developed and 
can be used for identifying, as well as characterisation 
and validation potential biomarkers. For example the so 
called *omics technologies (such as genomics, proteomics, 
and metabonomics etc.) have been developed and can be 
used for identifying potential biomarkers at several 
diff erent molecular levels. Based on this novel technology 
the biomarker research has faced many signifi cant 
challenges since the early 1990s. Th e fundamental issue 
that needs to be addressed therefore not to further 
improve the techniques it is how to improve the effi ciency 
of drug discovery and development. Th e current research 
and development (R&D) cost for developing a new therapeutic drug is greater than $800 million. Additionally, it 
takes an average of 12 years to get a new drug to market 
with an attrition rate greater than 90%. Reviewing the 
overall pharmaceutical R&D process, it becomes clear 
that many of the drug failures are due our lack of 
knowledge in population diversity, which is responsible 
for diff erence in drug effi cacy and toxicity. In fact, not a 
single approve drug is 100% safe and effi cacious for all 
patients. For the panellist the key questions were: How 
can we discover biomarkers that can be used to 
distinguish patients who will respond and/or will have 
adverse eff ects? Th ere is tremendous urgency to address 
this question. Biomarker also fi t perfectly with the vision 
of personalised medicine, the new expectation of medical 
practice. Th is is why biomarker research has been a 
central focus in many clinical research labs across the 
scientifi c world.
c) Statements to the current lack for practical 
application of biomarkers in medical practice
Th e use of biomarkers to investigate clinical relevant 
information allows proper classifi cation of patients into 
therapeutic groups and knowledge of therapy outcome. 
Unique molecular alterations can predict therapy 
outcome in specifi c therapeutic groups. Integrating this 
information allows selection of personalised targeted 
treatment regimes, saving unnecessary drug toxicity and 
decreasing morbidity. Th e use of biomarkers as classifi ers 
of patients (so-called stratifi cation marker) would also 
allow information on therapy outcome. Th ere are various 
examples of molecular markers that predict therapy 
outcome, but still await FDA approval to be included in 
the clinical setting. It is imperative to group biomarkers 
utilising well defi ned criteria to allow selection of 
approval process, prior to implementation to the clinical 
settings, based on benefi t to patients, availability of 
infrastructure to allow implementation, availability of 
specifi c therapy and technology within the clinical setting 
to implement the test, and any other criteria deemed 
appropriate.

However, due to the lack of specifi c validation and 
standardisation strategies to characterise such biomarkers, 
there is a very heterogeneous approach for the use of such 
biomarkers in preclinical and clinical research. In the last 
decade, the fi eld of proteomics, genomics and imaging 
analysis has expanded at a rapid rate. A range of exciting 
new technology has been developed and enthusiastically 
applied to an enormous variety of biological questions. 
However, the degree of stringency required in data analysis 
including correct prediction, normalisation and 
standardisation appears to have been underestimated. As a 
result, there are likely to be numer ous questionable 
fi ndings requiring further confi rmation and/or validation. 
With this premise, the EPMA should provide a platform to 
outlines a number of key issues in research, including 
those associated with experimental design, protein 
identifi cation and analytical complete ness. Furthermore, 
the selection of predictive markers must be carefully 
assessed and should depend on diff erent important 
parameters such as sensitivity and specifi city, etc.. 
Unfortunately, biomarkers with ideal specifi city and 
sensitivity are diffi cult to fi nd. One potential solution is to 
use the combinatorial power of a large number of 
biomarkers, each of which alone may not off er satisfactory. 
Recent technological advances in protein chip technology 
and bioinformatics off er a great opportunity for 
simultaneous analysis of a large number of potential 
predictive markers. Although many signifi cant results have 
been derived one limitation has been the lack of standards 
for presenting and exchanging such data. In the course of 
the panel discussion most recommendations belongs to set 
up proposal containing minimum information about a 
variety of bioanalytical experiment (sensitivity, specifi city 
of the biomarker etc.) as well as patient information (age, 
gender, pathology etc.) that describes the minimum 
information required to ensure that the predictive value of 
biomarkers can be easily interpreted and that results 
derived from its analysis can be independently verifi ed. 
Th e ultimate goal for upcoming biomarker studies is to 
establish a standard for recording and reporting analytical 
data, which will in turn facilitate the establishment of 
databases and public repositories and enable the 
development of data analysis tools. With respect to the 
EPMA objectives in the fi eld, we should concentrate on 
defi ning the content and structure of the necessary 
information for the correct prediction of biomarkers 
rather than the technical format for capturing it.
d) Outlooks and trends
Several trends have evolved over the last years which 
have facilitated knowledge transfer in predictive 
medicine from academia to industry, e.g.:
1. A strong need to fi nd new sources of innovation in 
the pharmaceutical industry in order to avoid 
“pipe lines drying up” – softening the “not invented 
here”– argument.
2. Personalised medicine will gain more importance.
3. Pharmaceutical industry becomes more scienceoriented. In fact, it even becomes more “academic” in 
structure e.g. establishing “Centres of Excellence”.
4. Academia becomes more “business-like” with an 
increasing need for third party funding and a 
redefi nition of the “mission of the university”.
Knowledge transfer can occur in many diff erent ways, 
however the key vehicle is licensing of proprietary 
technologies.
Technology transfer offi ces (TTOs), which comprehensively were established in most countries not before 
the turn of the millennium, have demonstrably gained 
(more) maturity. In particular the life sciences have 
profi ted there from.
Licensing as well as patenting activities have taken off 
in most industries, including life sciences. Also, 
biomarkers from all relevant areas of *omics are per se
patentable, thus fulfi lling an important prerequisite for 
commercialisation.
Accordingly, the number of respective licensing 
agreements is swiftly increasing.
Typical agreements relate to biomarker discovery and 
co-development but also to specifi c biomarkers (-sets).
Most agreements are concluded between biotech and 
pharmaceutical companies. However, academic research 
institutions are a rich source of biomarkers which is 
refl ected in the number of invention reports e.g. at 
PROvendis. Indeed, several licenses have been signed and 
there continues to be multitudinous negotiations between 
academia/TTOs and industry. Several bio markers which 
have been identifi ed in academia are now being marketed, 
including e.g. the multigene-panel of MammaPrintTM.
Yet, the path of a biomarker from the academia to 
industry seems to be particularly winding.
To some degree this is misleading. Biomarkers are 
relevant for diff erent steps in drug development and 
application. Inter alia, biomarkers are essential for studying mode of action of drug candidates. In this case, a 
detailed validation of a biomarker (by numerous independent scientifi c studies) will be more important to the 
industry than a monopoly position. Th us, although no 
license agreements will be signed, academia contributes 
enormously to drug development.
To some degree this is due to diffi culties of establishing 
approved diagnostic biomarkers on the market as (often) 
signifi cant eff orts will be necessary convincing physicians 
and providers of other (allegedly competing) diagnostic 
tools that there will be a win-win-situation for all 
stakeholders.
To a large extend, however, reasons can be found 
within academia. Th ese include the diffi culty of

conduct ing/funding large scale studies with suffi cient 
statistical power according to clinical development 
standards (however, initiatives such as the German 
National Biomarker database look promising). Th ey also 
include more general issues of the present technology 
transfer landscape such as an ongoing need to educate 
scientists.
Request and recommendations
EPMA-mission in the fi eld: request/recommendation for 
upcoming projects
• Creating novel innovative screening technologies 
(faster, more precise, cheaper)
• Using not only single biomarker per disease but their 
combinations and cell-based functional diagnostic 
systems
• Non- or minimally invasive diagnostic tools (saliva, 
urea, blood etc.)
• Knowledge exchange between biomedical researchers 
and biotechnology companies for advanced diagnostic tool production still need to be developed.
• Feasibility and validation studies: a number of key 
issues in research, development and clinical trial 
studies must be outlined,
• Transparent schemes for the establishing contact 
between researcher who discovered biomarkers and 
industry should be developed.
• Th e patenting system, at least in Germany, is not 
ideal; it is expensive and time consuming.
The EPMA Journal: request/recommendation for upcoming 
publications
• Published results must associate with laboratory 
design, analytical validation strategies, analytical 
completeness and data managements.
• Further assistance for defi ning key parameters in 
assay evaluation and validation in research and 
clinical trial projects in prospective medicine must be 
outlined
• Prevalence, Sensitivity, Specifi city, Accuracy, 
Likelihood ratio etc. should be defi ned
• Rare diseases and horizontal pathological processes 
like infl ammation that underlie major pathologies 
should be considered in the special issues

Summary Report - Special Session 
“Biobanking”
Ethically correct and technologically excellent biopreserva tion and biobanking are central activities in fi eld 
of PPPM. Th ese activities are a major focus of the Europe, 
Middle East and Africa Society for Biopreser vation and 
Biobanking (ESBB), which is a new society coming under 
the umbrella of EPMA. ESBB was formed in August 2010 
with the broad mission of advancing the fi eld of 
biobanking in support of research relating to healthcare, 
agriculture and the environment. ESBB has its focus on 
the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) 
and is also chapter of the International Society for 
Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER), a 
society with a global reach. ESBB works by exchanging, 
enhancing and disseminating relevant know ledge, by 
identifying and solving problems, and by en couraging 
high professional standards in the biobanking fi eld. It is 
an open society for people interested in all aspects of 
biobanking, including biopreservation science, biobank 
management, quality assurance, informatics, automation, 
ethical, legal, regulatory and social issues. It holds annual 
conferences which bring together people interested in all 
these areas. In order to develop solutions to problems 
that may be identifi ed at these conferences, the society 
encourages the formation of working groups that 
continue to function throughout the year.
In order for biobanks to provide the large sample sets 
that are required for many research studies, it is 
necessary for biobanks to form collaborative networks. 
Th ere is an evident need for access rules and sample 
exchangeability to be created for multi-centre medical 
research networks in a global scale. For biobank networks 
to be eff ective, the diff erent centres must collect samples 
according to the same standardised protocols so that 
samples are of similar quality, despite frequently observed 
unwillingness to share samples (the “My Syndrome”) that 
is a major obstacle to be overcome in the fi eld. Further, 
there is the need to fi nd cooperative “Win-Win” solutions 
for sample supplier and researcher. Biobanks in the same 
network must also adopt common access rules that 
encourage multi-centre research collaboration. Th is 
experience will guide development of biobanking in 
centres collaborating in the new EurocanPlatform 
(European Platform for Translational Cancer Research).
Biobanks must safeguard the interests of patients who 
are asked to donate their samples and for this reason 
informed consent is required for research use of samples. 
Th e other aspect is the matter of tight collaboration with 
patient organisations and individual sample donors. If 
patients are fully informed and feel that their samples will 
be used by the institution treating them to advance 
medical care, they are probably more likely to give 
consent.
Biobanks also need to be well integrated with hospital 
practice, for reasons of quality, effi ciency and economics. 
For example, the strong support of surgeons is required 
to ensure that samples are collected and processed with 
the minimum delay. If existing staff in the wards, 
operating theatres and pathology departments can take 
responsibility or at least facilitate the biobanking 
protocols this can result in increased effi ciency and 
reduce the need to employ extra biobank staff .
To encourage the integration of biobanking into 
hospital practice and encourage patients to support 
biobanking initiatives, it seems likely that better 
education about the benefi ts of biobanking might be 
helpful. Again for reasons of economy and effi ciency, this 
education about the benefi ts of biobanking might be best 
delivered in the context of education about PPPM in 
general to all sections of society: not only to current and 
potential patients, but also to healthcare professionals. 
To achieve this integration, educators in biobanking need 
to work closely with educators in other areas of PPPM. 
Th e union of ESBB and EPMA will help us to achieve this 
objective more eff ectively.
Recommendations
To ensure the eff ective integration of high quality 
biobanking with predictive, preventive and personalised 
medicine, we make the following recommendations:
1. High quality biobanking is essential for the advancement of medical care, since it provides the samples 
needed for research purposes as well as for diagnostic 
and therapeutic purposes. Th is needs to be widely 
understood to ensure that this critical activity receives 
the full support it deserves.
2. Many diff erent groups need to understand the value 
of high quality biobanking and it is particularly important that the medical profession is well informed 
on the subject so that they can educate other 
healthcare professionals and patients.
3. Biobanking must meet high ethical standards in order 
to win public trust and support. It must also meet 
high technical standards in order to provide samples 
that are fi t for purpose. For these reasons, biobanking 
must be conducted in a professional manner, 
biobanks must have responsible, well trained staff and 
biobanks themselves must be certifi ed and accredited.

4. Biobanks need to form cooperative networks in order 
to supply the large numbers of samples required for 
many research studies. Cooperative behaviour with 
sharing of samples is essential and needs to be 
encouraged, for example by suitable access policies.
5. Medical research needs to become an integral transparent part of routine medical care for the patients, in 
order to achieve that medical science is trusted to 
work with opt out and assumed consent for biobanking residual materials for observational research. 
In addition, biobanking for medical research needs 
the best results with regards to sample quality, 
annotation and consent rate. Surgeons, pathologists, 
and other medical and nursing professionals can play 
an important part in supporting high quality biobanking and should be partners in the process.

Health Informatics and Bioinformatics if it is to be 
Practical in Predictive, Preventive and Personalised 
Medicine
Informatics is central to preventive, predictive and 
personalised medicine, since it becomes essential to
• gather the complex data receiving from the emerging 
technologies, such as medical imaging, pharma cogenetics, clinical *omics, pathology-specifi c molecular patterns, disease modelling, individual patient 
profi les, etc.
• undertake both the retrospective and prospective 
analysis of biodata, information and knowledge 
related to the epi/genome and its links to disease for 
translational medicine
• provide the help with information and knowledge to 
advance health related sciences and make healthcare 
services more reliable
• to analyse the complex technological inputs for 
making optimal clinical decisions
• learn from what has happened at the individual, 
process and health system levels to promote the 
integrative approach by PPPM
• create patient records and secure safety treatment of 
patient data bases
• promote standardisation in healthcare
Currently there is a number of problems and 
challenges in creating the integrative bioinformatics 
for its application in daily clinical practice.
After more than 20 years of standards development 
work there is no widely accepted and adopted standards 
for
• Grammar to communicate health care information – 
despite progress with standards like HL7v2.x and CDA
• Information structures – despite progress with 
models like HL7v3 RIM and OpenEHR
• Terminology – despite progress with SNOMED, 
LOINC, HUGO and many others
• Rules and knowledge – despite progress with GELLO 
and Arden Syntax.
Also, the bioinformatics itself faces serious concept 
related and technological problems. Hence, it is the 
bio informatic analysis that has become the rate limiting 
step in genome sequencing. Further, huge data coming 
from epigenetics is massive and much more than 
generally recognised that represents a serious 
technological challenge for the storage and processing. 
Th e estimated size of human pangenome (individual 
genome multiplied with cell types/post-genome and 
world population) is ~ 4  ×  1024 bytes (4YB). Th erefore, 
making clinical sense of pangenomic information is very 
early in its development. Consequently, the current 
approach of diagnostic laboratories is concluded as 
unsustainable.
Conclusions and recommendations
Th e central premise is that informatics is critical to the 
development of preventive, predictive and personalised 
medicine and even more important in its application but 
yet it is only receiving piecemeal attention.
Ten years after sequencing the human genome we do 
not have the knowledge, education or informatics tools 
to implement clinical genetics, genomics, proteomics, 
meta bo lomics or epigenetics into practical personalised 
medicine.
PPPM informatics needs to be a research and education 
theme in its own right. Th e healthcare related scientifi c 
community has too few informaticians and unfortunately 
many of those that we do have are without the breadth of 
understanding of the fi eld to make the kind of advances 
that are needed. Th is is well illustrated by the existing 
gulf between health and bio-informaticians.
In terms of health policy, the attention should be 
focused on standardising registries. Th is is an area mostly 
funded by Governments and where the professions 
accept Government has a role. Th is approach should 
increase effi ciency and improve outcomes of the 
registries, but of more consequence, it would be a strong 
driver for standardising communications in the broader 
health related scientifi c community and healthcare 
industry.

Education in Predictive, Preventive and 
Personalised Medicine: EPMA Statement
Innovative Initiatives in Education of Professionals
Th e members of the Editorial BOARD of Th e EPMA 
Journal working weekly with the manuscripts and the 
peer-review procedure of the journal know very well, 
how diffi cult this task is. Diff erent professional groups in 
personalised medicine have realised that they speak 
“diff erent professional languages” less understandable for 
others. Consequently, great discoveries made/innovations triggered by one professional group, are frequently 
underestimated or even not valued at all by the others 
resulting in delays to the implementation of novel 
developments in personalised medicine across diverse 
areas. Th erefore, in healthcare we need to develop a new 
culture among experts in order to promote the multidisciplinary fi eld of personalised medicine. Our message 
is - the innovative PPPM-related educational programmes for professionals should be prioritised in the 
Common Strategic Framework (FP-8) as well as in other 
global and corresponding national programmes.
In order to promote innovative educational pro grammes, in collaboration with Springer and BioMedCentral, 
EPMA has developed worldwide pioneer initiatives 
creating the didactic materials for the fi eld as follows:
A. Th e EPMA Journal that regularly updates both needs 
and achievements in the fi eld of PPPM in application 
to major and rare pathologies.
B. Th e book-series “Advances in Predictive, Preventive & 
Personalised Medicine” (Book-series Editor-in-Chief: 
Olga Golubnitschaja, Figure 9); the book-series 
release is starting in 2012 with the following volumes:
– “Healthcare Overview: New Perspectives”, Volume 
Editor: Vincenzo Costigliola, Brussels, Belgium;
– “New Strategies to Advance Pre/Diabetes Care: 
Integrative Approach by PPPM”, Volume Editor: 
Mahmood Mozaff ari, Augusta, USA;
– “Neurodegenerative Diseases: Integrative PPPM 
Approach as the Medicine of the Future”, Volume 
Editor: Silvia Mandel, Haifa, Israel;
– “Drug delivery systems: Advanced technologies 
potentially applicable in personalised medicine”, 
Volume Editor: Jorge Coelho, Coimbra, Portugal.
Th is important initiative should be obligatory 
supported and well used at the European level and 
worldwide.
Educational Measures for Population: Promoting 
Participative Medicine
Advanced personalisation in medicine is achievable 
solely in the case of participative medicine that meets the 
demands of patient advocacy groups focussed on 
individually created medical approaches. Th e reader will 
fi nd a number of positive examples in each issue of Th e 
EPMA Journal and single volumes of the book-series 
“Advances in PPPM” concordant with this statement. It is 
evident that strong restrictions in the amount of 
education lead to dramatic defi cits and costs that have 
repercussions in several branches of the society resulting 
in increased pressure within healthcare systems [2]. Our 
message is - new guidelines are essential to regulate the 
fi eld in favour of educational measures for preventive 
programmes and advanced healthcare systems.
