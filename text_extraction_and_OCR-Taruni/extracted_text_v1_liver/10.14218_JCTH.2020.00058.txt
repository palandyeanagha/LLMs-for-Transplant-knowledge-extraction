Abstract
Acute liver failure (ALF) is the rapid onset of severe liver
dysfunction, defined by the presence of hepatic encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (international normalized ratio of $1.5) in the absence of underlying liver disease.
The elevated international normalized ratio value in ALF is
often misinterpreted as an increased hemorrhagic tendency,
which can lead to inappropriate, prophylactic transfusions of
blood products. However, global assessments of coagulopathy via viscoelastic tests or thrombin generation assay
suggest a reestablished hemostatic, or even hypercoagulable, status in patients with ALF. Although the current
versions of global assays are not perfect, they can provide
more nuanced insights into the hemostatic system in ALF
than the conventional measures of coagulopathy.

Introduction
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare, rapidly progressive syndrome that results from an acute onset of severe liver
dysfunction. The most commonly accepted definition of ALF
includes the development of hepatic encephalopathy and
coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] of
$1.5).1,2 The onset of acute symptoms occurs within 26
weeks, according to the American Association for the Study
of Liver Diseases (AASLD).1 But different societies have
slightly different variations on the temporal classifications;
for example, the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL) suggests three separate temporal subclassifications,2 while the International Association for the Study of the
Liver (IASL) and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of
the Liver (APASL) both employ a timeline of 4 weeks
(Table 1).3–5 Unless otherwise specified, the present review
will focus on the AASLD definition of ALF. INR reflects the disruptions in hepatic synthetic function in ALF and is an essential and useful clinical prognosticating tool. Clinicians often
rely on INR to assess bleeding risk in ALF.6 However, recent
studies have demonstrated that a careful approach is indispensable when interpreting raw INR values in the context of
hemostasis and bleeding diathesis in ALF. In this review, we
present the utility of INR as a reflection of coagulopathy, the
arguments for reestablished hemostatic system in ALF, and
the suggested tools for evaluating coagulopathy in ALF.
Interpretation of the INR value
Several reasons preclude the use of INR as the measure of
coagulopathy in ALF. First, INR was designed for the specific
indication of evaluating the interference of vitamin K-dependent clotting pathway, such as in warfarin-induced coagulopathy.7 INR is less relevant in ALF because both vitamin Kdependent and -independent factors contribute to the coagulopathy. Second, INR reflects only the changes in procoagulant factors. INR arises from prothrombin time (PT) and is
calculated as a ratio of patient’s PT to standardized PT.8 The
laboratory measures of PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) capture only the reduction in procoagulant
factors.9 These conventional studies of “coagulation” do not
reflect any deficiencies in anticoagulant factors such as
protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and tissue factor
pathway inhibitor (commonly referred to as TFPI) that are
also substantially reduced in ALF.10 Dynamic interactions
between all these cellular components do not fully enter the
INR.11 Lastly, INR is unreliable. There can be large interlaboratory discrepancies between INR measurements in patients
with liver disease because this test was not developed to
reflect coagulopathy in liver disease.12 Robert and Chazoulleres12 demonstrated that INR provided inadequate normalization of PT in patients with liver failure, whereas INR
normalized PT in anticoagulated patients. Trotter et al.13 additionally showed a significant inconsistency in INR results by
sending a sample of blood to three reference laboratories. The
laboratory variability resulted in different Model for End-Stage
Liver Disease (commonly known as MELD) scores and an
average change in organ allocation priority from 58th to 77th
percentile (p=0.01). The irregularities in PT/INR were
thought to be due to different sample storage time,

The differences in PT/INR values within subclasses of ALF
yield an interesting observation. In a study of 131 patients at
the King’s College in England, PT was more prolonged in
fulminant hepatic failure (development of hepatic encephalopathy [HE] within 8 weeks) at median of 58 seconds when
compared to PT in late-onset hepatic failure (development of
HE between 8 and 24 weeks) at median of 32 seconds
(p<0.01).14 Similarly, the landmark Lancet study that first
described the temporal subclassifications of ALF adopted by
the EASL guidelines showed that the admission PT value was
highest in the ALF group (development of HE within 8-28 days
of jaundice), followed by the hyperacute liver failure group
(development of HE within 0-7 days of jaundice) and the subacute liver failure group (development of HE within 29-72
days of jaundice).15 Despite this interesting observation, the
clinical significance in terms of coagulopathy and bleeding risk
behind these differences in PT/INR values in ALF subgroups
has not been explored.
Elevated INR is frequently observed in ALF but bleeding
complications are uncommon. Munoz et al.7 studied more
than 1,000 patients with ALF from the Acute Liver Failure
Study Group, a consortium of 24 tertiary care liver centers
collecting data on patients with ALF. The mean INR of this
cohort was 3.8 (ranging from 1.5 to >10.0). At admission,
81% of their cohort had an INR value between 1.5 and 5.0.
Fourteen percent had an INR value ranging from 5.0 to 10.0,
and 5% had an INR >10.0.7 Another study on 2,095 ALF
patients who presented to the Liver Intensive Therapy Unit
at Kings College Hospital between 1973 and 2008 showed a
similar INR profile. The mean INR in their cohort of 840 nonparacetamol ALF patients was 3.5 (range of 2.3 to 6), and the
mean INR in their cohort of 1,255 paracetamol ALF patients
was 6.2 (range of 3.9 to 9.3).16 Despite the elevated INR
values, spontaneous overt bleeding in ALF has been reported
to be uncommon.17–20 Bleeding in ALF is usually silent or
manifested as mucosal membrane bleeding, often gastrointestinal in origin.7,19,21 In the ALF Study Group, the INR
values of ALF patients who experienced bleeding were not
significantly different from those who did not experience
bleeding.7 Bleeding complications from invasive procedures
such as the placement of an intracranial pressure (ICP)
monitor is also comparable to those without invasive procedures. In a cohort of 58 ALF patients, bleeding from ICP
monitor placement was 10.3%, and half of the complications

were incidental radiological findings.22 More recently published in 2018, the overall incidence of bleeding was 10.6%
during the first 7 days of admission, 89% spontaneous and
11% post-procedural, in a cohort of 1,770 adult patients with
ALF in the ALF Study Group Registry. Bleeding complications
were the cause of death in 2.1% of their patients. Importantly, INR was not statistically different between bleeders
and non-bleeders.6
Rebalanced hemostasis in ALF
The exact mechanism of coagulopathy in ALF remains to be
fully elucidated. However, current evidence suggests that the
coagulopathy in ALF is derived from a complex and delicate
interplay between decreased synthesis of procoagulant
factors and anticoagulant factors, impaired fibrinolytic
systems, defective platelets, and thrombocytopenia.7,17,23 A
significant alteration to the hemostatic system between procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways in ALF results in a delicate balance.24 Any insult to this newly established system
can tip the scale toward either thrombotic or bleeding
complications.19
Acute hepatocellular injury leads to a considerable
reduction in coagulation factor levels, as reflected by the
prolonged PT/INR values. Hepatocytes synthesize most
coagulation factors, including fibrinogen and factors II
(prothrombin), V, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII.25 In the 1970s,
Boks et al.26 reported that the levels of clotting factors
were extremely depressed in their cohort of 7 ALF patients.
In another study, 31 patients with acute paracetamol overdose showed reduced coagulation factors II, V, VII, and X
but increased levels of factor VIII, an acute phase reactant
synthesized in endothelial cells.19,25,27,28 Coagulation
factors also have a short half-life,23 which augments the
effect of reduced production of coagulation factors in ALF.
These changes in coagulant factors are offset by decreased
anticoagulant proteins in ALF.19 Anticoagulant proteins,
such as protein C, protein S, protein Z, protein Z-dependent
protease inhibitor, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, and
a2-macroglobulin, are all synthesized by the liver;10,29,30
an acute injury to hepatocytes leads to a diminished generation of these factors.
In addition to the decreased levels of coagulant and
anticoagulant factors, fibrinogen is affected qualitatively and
quantitatively in ALF. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein that is
cleaved by thrombin into fibrin to form a blood clot.31 Green
et al.32 first reported the primary abnormality in fibrinogen in
ALF by demonstrating varying degrees of disturbances in
fibrin polymerization. A follow-up study modified the original
calorimetry technique by Green et al. and reported dysfibrinogenemia in 86% of their 29 ALF patients.33 These two
studies confirmed the high incidence of acquired dysfibrinogenemia in ALF. Furthermore, fibrinogen produced in patients
with ALF has increased amounts of sialic acid, which results in
abnormal fibrinogen function and prolonged thrombin time.25
Quantitatively, fibrinogen levels are typically normal or
slightly reduced in ALF,10,25 likely related to the fact that fibrinogen is an acute-phase protein.19 Qualitatively, the disturbance in fibrinogen may contribute to coagulopathy in ALF.
Fibrinolysis, a process that prevents clotting, is also
affected in ALF. All proteins involved in fibrinolysis, except
for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are synthesized by the liver.24
The plasma levels of plasminogen, antiplasmin (a-2 plasmin
inhibitor or a-2 PI), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor
(TAFI), and factor XIII are all significantly reduced in
ALF.10,24,26 The plasma levels of tPA and PAI-1 (inhibitor of
tPA) are increased during ALF, due to their release by activated endothelium and reduced hepatic clearance.10,19,25
However, PAI-1 levels are even more substantially increased
than tPA levels in ALF, resulting in impaired fibrinolysis and
hypofibrinolysis in ALF.10,19,24
Platelet dysfunction is routinely observed in ALF.23 In
addition, there may be mild to moderate reduction in platelet count,17,19,24 though some patients may still retain
normal platelet counts. According to data of more than
1,000 ALF patients from the Acute Liver Failure Study
Group, the median platelet level was 132,000/mL (range
of 1,000 to 533,000)7
. Thrombocytopenia in ALF is
thought to result from impaired platelet production and
thrombin-mediated platelet consumption, though the
exact mechanism is not yet known.23 Initially, it was
hypothesized that the decreased synthesis of thrombopoietin (TPO) was responsible for thrombocytopenia in ALF
because TPO is produced by the liver. However, Schiødt
et al.34 measured the TPO level in 51 patients with ALF
and reported that TPO level was above the upper limit of
normal in 22 patients, normal in 24 patients, and below
normal in only 5 patients. TPO levels did not correlate with
platelet count in ALF. However, the level and function of
platelet adhesive protein von Willebrand factor (vWF) and
its cleaving protease ADAMTS13 in plasma have shown to
affect platelet function in acute liver injury (ALI) and ALF.
ALI is defined as INR of $1.5 in the absence of prior liver
disease and illness duration of #26 weeks but without
hepatic encephalopathy. vWF is a multimeric protein that
is essential to platelet adhesion, and its reactivity towards
platelets is proportional to its size, which is regulated by
ADAMTS13. When compared to control subjects, patients
with ALI and ALF had highly elevated vWF levels but
reduced vWF function and reduced ADAMTS13 level and
function. The overall platelet activity was normal or
perhaps even increased; the rise in the concentration of
vWF and decreased ADAMTS13 level and function more
than compensated for the decrease in vWF function.11,35
There is also evidence suggesting that ALF may be a
hypercoagulable state. Stravitz et al.36 conducted a study
on 50 ALI/ALF patients assessing the level of microparticles
in their plasma. Microparticles are procoagulant membrane
fragments (ranging in size from 0.1 to 1.0mm) derived from
various cells. In their cohort, three dominant sizes of microparticles (0.27, 0.28 to 0.64, >0.64mm) were detected in ALI/
ALF patients and healthy controls, and the ALI/ALF patients
had a significantly higher concentration of all sizes of microparticles. When displaying tissue factor, a membrane protein
vital in initiating coagulation37,38 these highly procoagulant
microparticles released from acutely injured liver potentially
mediate the activation of coagulation and result in intravascular coagulation. The process further exacerbates liver
damage in ALF.36
Overall, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to
suggest that the hemostasis in ALF is complex and rebalanced
(Table 2, Fig. 1). Reduction in procoagulant factors counters
diminished anticoagulant factors. Decreased levels of antiplasmin and TAFI offset increased levels of PAI-1 and
reduced plasminogen. The increased amount of vWF compensates for the platelet dysfunction. Microparticles may even

play a role in normalizing coagulopathy. Hence, an elevated
INR does not fully represent the cellular processes in ALF.
Assessing hemostasis in ALF
Viscoelastic tests
Conventional coagulation tests, such as PT/INR, do not
entirely represent the in vivo process in the in vitro setting.
Global assays that consider all aspects of coagulopathy,
including pro/anticoagulation mechanisms and fibrinolysis,
offer many advantages in ALF. More recently, viscoelastic
tests (VET) of coagulopathy, including thromboelastographic
(TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), have
emerged for non-surgical applications in acute and chronic
liver diseases. VET is a single point-of-care assay that
allows for real-time functional evaluation of viscoelastic properties of coagulation, including dynamics of clot formation,
ultimate clot strength, clot stability, and degradation.11,39–42
TEG and ROTEM have long been utilized in liver transplantation as its use reduces blood and fluid infusion volume during
surgery.43–45
In ALF, the parameters reflecting primary and secondary
hemostasis are typically normal on TEG. Stravitz et al.11
conducted a prospective ancillary project to The Acute
Liver Failure Study Group and performed TEG on 50 patients
with ALI/ALF on admission. The mean INR was elevated at
3.4 (range of 1.5 to 9.6) but the mean and median TEG
parameters were normal for the entire population. Thirtytwo patients (63%) had normal TEG studies, and four
patients (8%) actually had hypercoagulable TEG parameters. Normal clot formation was observed without activation

of the protein C system.11 Furthermore, the authors
reported that the number of thrombotic complications was
higher than bleeding complications. Bleeding was reported
in six patients, while thrombosis occurred in eleven
patients.11 In another study, plasma samples from 20 ALF
patients showed similar results. The median INR in their
cohort was 4.1 (interquartile range from 2.2 to 6.1) but it
did not correlate with the TEG parameters. The authors
demonstrated hypocoagulable TEG tracing in 20%, normal
TEG tracing in 45%, and hypercoagulable tracing in 35%.46
No significant bleeding complications or need for blood
transfusions occurred in their study.46 In summary, TEG
tracings suggest perhaps a reestablished hemostasis
system in ALF despite the elevated INR values.
Thrombin generation assay
VET is a useful bedside tool, where the results are typically
available within minutes and the tracings available in realtime. However, one critique is that VET may not represent
the true hemostatic balance in ALF because it lacks protein
C activation and is insensitive to vWF in cirrhotic patients.47
Thrombin generation assay (TGA) overcomes the inherent
weaknesses of VET by providing a more accurate interplay
between pro- and anticoagulant factors in ALF, thus evaluating the coagulopathy globally. However, unlike VET, TGA
can be time-consuming and is currently only available in
research settings.48
Lisman et al.49 performed TGA using the Calibrated
Automated Thrombogram on 50 patients with ALI/ALF and
40 healthy controls. Thrombin generation in patients with
ALI/ALF was not significantly different from thrombin generation in control subjects when thrombomodulin was
added to test mixture.49 The presence of thrombomodulin
allowed for full activation of protein C in ALF, a condition
known to have protein C deficiency.9 This finding of indistinguishable thrombin generation between ALI/ALF patients
and control subjects supports the state of reestablished
hemostasis in ALF. Fibrinolytic capacity was also significantly impaired in ALI/ALF patients, supporting hypofibrinolysis in these patients. No lysis was observed within 3 h
in 73.5% of ALI/ALF patients but in only 2.5% of healthy
controls. This phenomenon was associated with decreased
levels of plasminogen and increased levels of PAI-1.49
Moreover, the intact thrombin-generating capacity and
hypofibrinolytic status persisted throughout the first week
of admission in ALI/ALF patients.49 Habib et al.50 conducted
a similar study on 32 patients with ALI/ALF and 40 control
subjects utilizing TGA. Patients with ALI/ALF had a median
INR of 3.36 (interquartile range 2.67 to 7.01) and
decreased coagulation factors, except for factor VIII, as
expected. The authors confirmed that thrombin generation
in the presence of thrombomodulin in ALI/ALF patients was
not significantly different from healthy controls. The ratio of
thrombin generation with thrombomodulin to thrombin
generation without thrombomodulin was significantly elevated in patients with ALI/ALF, suggesting hypercoagulable
state in these patients.50 Again, study data showed that
TGA demonstrates a rebalanced hemostatic system in ALF
that is not reflected in elevated INR values.
Conclusions
Based on the current evidence, global assessment of hemostasis in ALF indicates a “rebalanced” state. Therefore,
prophylactic transfusion of blood products is unwarranted
and may expose patients to harmful effects, such as volume
overload and transfusion reaction, without a clear
benefit.17,23,47 Global tests of hemostasis have gained
more recognition as potential tools in the evaluation of coagulopathy in patients with liver disease (Table 3). American
Gastroenterological Association acknowledges the potential
role of global assessment when evaluating clotting in
patients with cirrhosis.51 Both the European Association
for the Study of the Liver and the Society of Critical Care
Medicine also recommend the use of thromboviscous technology, such as VET and TGA, to assess bleeding/thrombotic
risks in critically ill patients with ALF.2,42 Neither the latest
study data nor the most professional society guidelines
support relying on INR as the sole measure of coagulopathy
in ALF. Future iterations and standardization of VET and TGA
are likely to provide a more comprehensive representation
of coagulopathy in ALF.
