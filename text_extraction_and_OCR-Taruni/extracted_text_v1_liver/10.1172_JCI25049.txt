Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron-overload disorder resulting from mutations in proteins presumed to
be involved in the maintenance of iron homeostasis. Mutations in hemojuvelin (HJV) cause severe, early-onset
juvenile hemochromatosis. The normalfunction of HJV is unknown.Juvenile hemochromatosis patients have
decreased urinary levels of hepcidin, a peptide hormone that binds to the cellular iron exporter ferroportin,
causing its internalization and degradation. We have disrupted the murine Hjv gene and shown that Hjv–/– mice
have markedly increased iron deposition in liver, pancreas, and heart but decreased iron levels in tissue macrophages. Hepcidin mRNA expression was decreased in Hjv–/– mice. Accordingly,ferroportin expression detected
by immunohistochemistry was markedly increased in both intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages. We propose that excess, unregulated ferroportin activity in these celltypes leads to the increased intestinal iron absorption and plasma iron levels characteristic of the juvenile hemochromatosis phenotype.
Introduction
Hereditary hemochromatosis disorders result from mutations in
genes coding for proteinsthatregulate iron homeostasis(reviewed
in ref. 1). To date, pathological mutations have been discovered in
5 genes: HFE (encoding HFE), TFR2 (encoding transferrin receptor–2), SLC40A1 (encoding ferroportin), HAMP (encoding hepcidin), and HJV (encoding hemojuvelin) (2–7). The autosomal-recessive diseases associated with mutations in HFE, TFR2, HAMP, and
HJV have similar clinical presentations. All are characterized by
systemic iron overload with deposition of excessiron in parenchymal cells of the liver, heart, pancreas, and other endocrine tissues.
Hemochromatosis disorders due to HFE and TFR2 mutations
tend to be less severe, with later clinical onset, than those caused
by HAMP and HJV mutations; the latter are characterized by accelerated iron loading, which, if untreated, may be lethal before the
fourth decade of life.
While the normal roles of HFE, TFR2, and HJV have not yet
been elucidated, 2 important clues suggest a unifying model for
the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis. First, the 4 hemochromatosis disorders are all characterized by increased intestinal
iron absorption and increased levels of serum iron. This suggests a defect that affects both absorptive enterocytes and tissue
macrophages, which supply most of the serum iron primarily
through recovery of the metal from senescent erythrocytes (1).
Second, patients with all 4 disorders produce inappropriately low
amounts of hepcidin, an iron-regulatory hormone (6–9). In normal individuals, hepcidin levels correlate with total body iron status — they are decreased in cases of iron deficiency and elevated
in cases of iron overload (reviewed in ref. 1). In hemochromatosis patients, the deficit in hepcidin expression roughly correlates
with the clinical severity of iron overload, which suggests that the
normal hepcidin response is defective. Patients with mutations
in HAMP and Hamp–/– mice develop severe hemochromatosis
associated with profound deficiency of hepcidin (7, 10, 11). Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing hepcidin develop severe,
prenatal iron-deficiency anemia and macrophage iron retention
(12). These observations are all consistent with the hypothesis
that hepcidin normally serves to inhibit intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release.
Recently, it was shown that hepcidin acts to downregulate cellsurface expression of ferroportin (13), a transmembrane iron
transporter necessary for iron transfer out of intestinal epithelial
cells and macrophages (14). In the absence of hepcidin, epithelial cells transfer more dietary iron across their basolateral membranes, which increases net absorption. Similarly, iron-recycling
macrophages retain less storage iron and return more of it to the
circulation. The consequence of both changes is hypersaturation
of the serum iron carrier transferrin, which leads to a surfeit of
non–transferrin-bound iron that is readily assimilated by parenchymal cells of the liver, heart, and endocrine tissues.
The role of HJV in iron homeostasisis obscure. Its closest homologs are repulsive guidance molecules(RGMs) RGM-A and RGM-B,
membrane-tethered proteinsimportant in the developing nervous
system (15–19). Molecules in this family share structural features
including an N-terminal signal peptide, an RGD motif, a von Willebrand type D domain, a GPI anchor motif, and a C-terminal
transmembrane segment. While expression of RGM-A and RGM-B
is restricted to the nervous system, HJV mRNA is detectable in
most tissues (20) and is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle,
cardiac muscle, and liver (6). More than 25 disease-causing mutations in HJV have been identified throughout the protein (21).
In this report, we describe the development of a mouse model
of HJV hemochromatosis. We disrupted the murine Hjv gene
through targeted deletion of most of the coding sequence. We
found that Hjv–/– mice rapidly accumulated iron in the liver, pancreas, and heart but had decreased iron content in the spleen. In
contrast to previous findings in human patients, we detected no
abnormalities in fertility and no obvious cardiac or endocrine
abnormalities, which suggests that mice are more resistant to
end-organ damage. Hepatic hepcidin expression was markedly
decreased, and ferroportin protein was present at very high levels.
These results support the hypothesis that juvenile hemochromatosis results from impaired hepcidin regulation and consequent
overexpression of ferroportin.

Results
Targeted disruption of Hjv results in severe hemochromatosis. To disrupt
the normal Hjv allele, we replaced exon 3 and the coding portion
of exon 4 with a neomycin resistance cassette using homologous
recombination in J1 ES cells (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI25049DS1). This knockout strategy deletes most of the
sequence coding for the Hjv protein. We identified correctly targeted clones by Southern blot analysis and verified homologous
recombination at both ends of the targeted region. We obtained
chimeric animals, which were bred with 129S6/SvEvTac femalesto
produce inbred F1 offspring carrying the modified Hjv allele. We
confirmed germline transmission of the targeted allele by Southern blot and/or PCR analysis (data not shown).
We interbred Hjv+/– animals to produce Hjv–/– offspring, and
approximately 25% of the offspring were Hjv–/–, which indicates
that there was no significant prenatal lethality. The mutant mice
were grossly indistinguishable from theirlittermates at birth. They
developed normally and showed no evidence of neurological or
muscular abnormalities. By 4 weeks of age, the livers of Hjv–/– mice
were noticeably brown. We measured tissue iron content at 6 to 7
weeks of age and found that Hjv–/– mice had almost 20-fold more
non-heme liver iron than did wild-type or Hjv+/– mice (Figure 1).
Pancreatic iron accumulation was also markedly increased in
Hjv–/– mutants (Figure 1). Excess non-heme iron was present in
the heart (Figure 1) as well as in the kidney and testis (data not
shown). However,splenic non-heme iron content was decreased in
Hjv–/– mice compared with that in Hjv+/– and wild-type mice (Figure 1). Serum transferrin saturations were close to 100% in Hjv–/–
mice (data not shown). Hemoglobin levels were indistinguishable
between Hjv–/– and wild-type mice (data not shown).
We further examined the sites of iron accumulation by staining
histological sections for iron (Figure 2). At 6 to 7 weeks of age,
there was considerable, pericanalicular iron accumulation in liver
parenchymal cells (hepatocytes), while the resident macrophages
(Kupffer cells) were spared. In most animals, hepatocellular iron
deposition appeared to be slightly more prominent in the periportal region (Figure 2, A and B, and data notshown). Iron accumulation was also observed in the distal tubules of the kidney and the
exocrine and endocrine pancreas, in a subset of cells in the anterior pituitary, and in arteriolar endothelial cells of the testis (data
not shown). Compared with that in wild-type mice, iron staining
was minimal in Hjv–/– splenic macrophages (Figure 2, C and D).
Furthermore, while there was abundant iron in enterocytes of 6-
to 7-week-old wild-type mice, there was a marked decrease in the
amount of stainable iron present in proximal duodenal enterocytes in Hjv–/– mice (Figure 2, E–H).
Young, female Hjv–/– mice were fertile and able to give birth to
pupsthatwere indistinguishable from normal mice. Six-to 7-weekold Hjv–/– male mice had robust, complete spermatogenesis and
normal numbers of Leydig and Sertoli cells and were also fertile
(data not shown). We conclude that systemic iron overload does
not affect the reproductive potential of young adult Hjv–/– mice.
Hjv–/– mice have a severe deficit in hepcidin production and overexpression of ferroportin. It is not currently possible to measure serum

levels of hepcidin in mice. For that reason, we examined liver
hepcidin mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. We found
that Hjv–/– mice had markedly decreased hepatic hepcidin mRNA
expression as compared with that of control mice (Figure 3). Hepcidin mRNA was undetectable in some Hjv–/– mice. When hepcidin
mRNA was detected, the levelsin Hjv–/– animals averaged approximately 5.5-fold less than those observed in wild-type controls
(P < 0.005, quantitation by phosphoimager analysis). The decrease
in hepcidin mRNA levelsin Hjv–/– mice occurred in spite of massive
iron overload. Hepcidin mRNA levels in Hjv+/– mice were indistinguishable from those seen in wild-type controls (data not shown).
We examined ferroportin expression by immunohistochemistry,
focusing on those tissueswhere ferroportin is known to be important
(14). While immunohistochemistry is less quantitative than other
techniques, it has the advantage of showing the cellular localization
of the protein. Ferroportin is normally expressed at low levels in the
absorptive enterocytes lining the intestinal villi (Figure 4, A and C).
However, in Hjv–/– mice,we observed a massive increase in ferroportin
protein expressed at the basolateral membrane (Figure 4, B and D).
Similarly, ferroportin expression was markedly enhanced in tissue
macrophages ofthe livers(Figure 4F) andspleens(Figure 4H) of Hjv–/–
mice comparedwith that ofwild-type controls(Figure 4, E and G).
Discussion
Targeted disruption of the murine Hjv gene resulted in a mouse
phenotype similar to that of human patients with juvenile hemochromatosis. Hjv–/– mice rapidly accumulated excess iron in the
liver, heart, and pancreas, which confirmed that HJV isthe juvenile
hemochromatosis gene and that loss of Hjv protein leads to iron
overload. Interestingly, Hjv+/– mice were indistinguishable from
wild-type mice in every study, which suggests that haploinsufficiency does not produce any clinical consequences. This is consistent with the fact that parents of juvenile hemochromatosis
patients have never been reported to be affected but is notably different from previous observations in Hfe+/– mice, in which a mild
heterozygote phenotype has been detected (22).
By 6 to 7 weeks of age, Hjv–/– mice had accumulated significantly
more iron than 12-week-old Hfe–/– mice of the same genetic background (23), which is consistent with the difference in severity
between juvenile hemochromatosis and HFE hemochromatosisin
human patients. However, similar to other mouse models of iron
overload (refs. 23–25, and our unpublished observations), Hjv–/–
mice did not develop significant hepatic fibrosis, frank cardiomyopathy, overt diabetes, infertility, or other end-organ dysfunction.
Mice appeared to be protected, by some unknown mechanism,
from toxic effects of iron overload.
Although HJV is expressed at high levels in cardiac and skeletal myocytes, Hjv–/– mice, similar to juvenile hemochromatosis
patients, had no grossly apparent abnormalities aside from iron
overload, which suggeststhat Hjv plays no essential role in muscle
development or function within the first 2 months of life. Based
on this phenotype, we conclude that the critical role of HJV is to
control iron homeostasis. Our data suggest that it acts by potentiating hepcidin expression. Hepcidin is primarily produced in the
liver, butsmaller amounts are made in the heart and pancreas(26),
which is similar to the pattern of HJV expression (refs. 6, 20, and
our unpublished observations). It is possible that HJV controls
hepcidin expression at several of those sites. Intriguingly, HJV is
expressed at the primary sites of iron loading in hemochromatosis,

which suggeststhat it could have a second, cell-autonomousfunction in either sensing or directly modulating cellular iron uptake.
In the absence of appropriate hepcidin expression, we would
expect impaired regulation of the iron exporter, ferroportin.
Accordingly, we observed markedly elevated levels of ferroportin
in 2 critical sites: the absorptive intestinal epithelium and tissue
macrophages. The iron content of both enterocytes and macrophages was decreased compared with that of wild-type animals.
Thus, increased intestinal ferroportin expression could account
for accelerated iron absorption and increased body iron burden by
maximizing the amount of enterocyte iron transferred to serum.
Similarly, increased macrophage ferroportin expression could
potentiate macrophage iron release, resulting in decreased macrophage storage iron and increased serum iron.
Our study also has implications for autosomal-dominant iron
overload associated with mutationsin the gene encoding ferroportin. There appear to be 2 classes of patients with “ferroportin disease” (27). One group has increased macrophage iron stores with
no apparent increase in total body iron, which suggests a partial
loss of ferroportin function (4, 28). Their phenotype is similar to
that observed in mice lacking 1 ferroportin allele (14). However,
other patients with a different constellation of ferroportin missense mutations present with symptoms that are more similar
to those of the other hemochromatosis disorders (29, 30). These
patients may have increased ferroportin activity similar to that of
Hjv–/– mice. This might result either from increased ferroportin
transporter activity or from impaired binding of hepcidin.
In summary, our findings define a mechanism for iron overload
in juvenile hemochromatosis due to mutations in HJV. Together
with results of other studies showing decreased hepcidin expression in other hemochromatosis disorders, they suggest that
increased body iron burden resultsfrom overactivity of ferroportin
due to impaired regulation by hepcidin. We propose that increased
ferroportin expression is the direct cause of increased intestinal
iron absorption and increased serum iron, which leads to rapid
deposition in target organs.
Methods
Targeted disruption of the murine Hjv gene. We isolated Hjv genomic clones
from a strain 129/SvJ mouse library (Stratagene). To construct the targeting vector to delete exon 3 and the entire coding region of exon 4 of Hjv, we
subcloned fragments of 3.8 kb (upstream of the deleted region) and 2.9 kb
(downstream) into a targeting vector containing a neomycin-resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites (Supplemental Figure 1). Linearized vector was
electroporated into 129 J1 ES cells. Correct homologousrecombinationwas
confirmed by Southern blot or PCR analysis of flanking sequences from
both ends of the targeted region. ES cell clones with normal karyotypes
were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Transmission ofthe targeted alleles
was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The animals were maintained on
an inbred 129S6/SvEvTac background. Subsequent genotyping was carried
out by extracting DNA from snipped tail samples (PureGene kit; Gentra
Systems) and subjecting it to Southern blot and/or PCR analysis.
Animal care. All mice were born and housed in the barrier facility at Children’s Hospital Boston. We weaned pups at 28 days and maintained them
on Prolab RMH 3000 LabDiet(PMI Nutrition International),which has 380
parts per million ofiron. All mouse procedureswere approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Children’s Hospital Boston.
Tissue iron staining and quantitative tissue iron measurements. Tissues were
harvested from 6- to 7-week-old mice that were not fasted priorto sacrifice.
Intestine, liver, and spleen samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Deparaffinized tissue sections were stained with the
Perls Prussian blue stain for non-heme iron in the Children’s Hospital Boston Pathology Laboratory. A subset of tissue sections were stained with
a diaminobenzidine-enhanced Perls iron stain (31). Deparaffinized tissue
sections were incubated for 30 minutes in 1% potassium ferrocyanide in
0.12 N HCl. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched for 20 minutes
at room temperature in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were rinsed in
PBS and incubated for 6 minutes in DAB/H2O2 (DAB-Plus Substrate Kit;
Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Quantitative measurement of non-heme iron
was performed as described previously (22). Results are reported as micrograms of iron per gram wet weight of tissue.
RNA preparation and Northern blot analysis. We harvested liver tissue from
6- to 7-week-old mice at sacrifice and immediately stored it at –80°C until
it was immersed in RNAlater solution (Ambion Inc.). We then transferred
the tissue from RNAlater to Trizol (Invitrogen Corp.) and homogenized it
3 timesfor 20 seconds each using a Polytron PT2100 apparatus(Novodirect
GmbH). We extracted RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
We fractionated 10 µg of total RNA from individual Hjv–/– and wild-type
mice on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted it onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences). We hybridized the membrane
with 32P-labeled probesspecific for hepcidin and β-actin mRNAs. We quantified the signals on a fluoroimager (Molecular Dynamics).
Immunohistochemistry.Immunohistochemicalstaining ofmouse tissueswith
an anti-ferroportin antibody (32)was carried out as described previously (14).
Previousstudies comparing immunoreactivitywith this antibody and preimmune controls validated the specificity of the antibody (data notshown).
