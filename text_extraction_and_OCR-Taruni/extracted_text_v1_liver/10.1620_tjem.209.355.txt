355-359 ── Major bile duct injury during cholecystectomy represents potentially severe 
complications with unpredictable long-term results. If these lesions are not treated adequately, they can lead to hepatic failure or secondary biliary cirrhosis therefore requiring 
liver transplantation. We report a patient who required liver transplantation 15 years after 
open cholecystectomy. A l0-year old girl underwent open cholecystectomy and duodenal 
repair for cholelithiasis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. She required two surgical inteventions, hepaticojejunostomy which was performed in another center and portoenterostomy 
for biliary stricture at our institution seven years after the cholecystectomy. Eight years 
after the third operation, she required recurrent hospitalization for treatment of 
hepatic abscesses. The extremely short intervals between the three life threatening episodes and the rapid progression to severe sepsis were taken into consideration and liver 
transplantation was performed at the age of 25. She is leading a healthy life at 4 years post 
transplantation. Although iatrogenic biliary injury can usually be treated successfully by a 
combination of surgery, radiological and endoscopic techniques, patients with severe injuries develop irreversible liver disease. This case report and review of the literature suggest 
that liver transplantation is a treatment modality for a selected group of patients with 
end-stage liver disease secondary to bile duct injury. ──── bile duct injury; secondary

Biliary and hepatic vascular injuries during 
cholecystectomy are complex lesions, associated 
with high rates of morbidity and mortality 
(Lillemoe et al. 1997; Buell et al. 2002). The 
incidence of major bile duct injury has remained 
constant at the rate of 0.1-0.3% during open surgery, and 0.3-1% during laparoscopic surgery. 
Although some centers report successful results in 
almost all patients with a combination of surgery 
and radiological techniques (Lillemoe et al. 1997; 

356 D. Öncel et al.
Johnson et al. 2000), biliary cirrhosis cannot 
always be prevented (Nordin et al. 2001). An 
associated vascular injury may occur in 10-30% 
of these patients, and although it generally 
remains “silent,” in rare cases it may lead to 
extensive hepatic necrosis (Bacha et al. 1994; 
Erkan et al. 2001; Nordin et al. 2001). These are 
the two serious complications of a benign disease 
that may eventually require liver transplantation. 
In this paper, we present a case of bile duct injury 
following open cholecystectomy, which resulted 
in secondary biliary cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation and also review the world literature.
CASE REPORT
A 10-year old girl underwent open cholecystectomy at other institution in 1987. At laparotomy, the gallbladder was found to be fistulized to 
the duodenum, and cholecystectomy and duodenal repair were performed. The postoperative 
period was complicated with both biliary and 
duodenal fistulae. The biliary fistula was treated 
by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJS), 
whereas the duodenal fistula was treated conservatively. This second operation showed a definite 
biliary tract injury, with no signs of any congenital abnormality.
Seven years later, she was referred to our 
institution, for recurrent cholangitis. She was followed conservatively for one year but her clinical 
course warranted an intervention. Her percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) revealed 
a Bismuth III stricture. Preoperative color 
Doppler ultrasound showed normal flow pattern 
in both the portal vein and hepatic arteries. 
During exploratory laparotomy, which was done 
seven years after her first operation, the HJS was 
found to be stenosed, and surrounded by dense, 
fibrotic tissues. Although the preoperative surgical strategy was to perform a HJS alone or following extended hepatectomy, attempts to find 
healthy bile ducts suitable for anastomosis were 
unsuccessful and a portoenterostomy (similar to

the Kasai procedure) was performed. An intraoperative liver biopsy confirmed presence of biliary 
cirrhosis. She was started on ursodeoxycholic 
acid treatment. Except for self-limiting or mild 
episodes of cholangitis, her bilirubin level 
remained below 2 mg/dl for six years until June 
2000, when the total bilirubin level rose to 4.2 
mg/dl and did not become lower than 2.7 mg/dl 
until October 2000. Her ultrasonographic evaluation showed dilation of the intrahepatic biliary 
tree. PTC and balloon dilation of the hilar strictures were performed (Fig. l A and B). Her bilirubin level gradually decreased to l.4 mg/dl by May 
2001. However, between October 2001 and 
February 2002, she was hospitalized three times 
for severe sepsis due to hepatic abscesses in the 
right lobe (Fig. 2). She underwent percutaneous 
drainage and required admission to the intensive 
care unit. Radiological examinations performed 
at that time did not show significant dilation of 
the biliary tree, therefore PTC and balloon dilation were not attempted. Given the extremely 
short intervals between the three life threatening 
episodes and the rapid progression from prodromal symptoms to severe sepsis, it was decided to 
perform a liver transplantation. Her preoperative 
liver function tests were as follows: total bilirubin, 4.7 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase 47 U/L; 
alanine aminotransferase 42 U/L; alkaline phosphatase 478 U/L; albumin 3.0 g/dl; and prothrombin time 16 seconds. The Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging showed signs of cirrhotic liver, left 
hepatic lobe atrophy and dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. After obtaining informed consent, orthotopic liver transplantation from a blood 
group identical donor was performed. At operation, the hepatic artery and its branches were 
found to be intact. Her postoperative course was 
uneventful. The pathologic findings were consistent with inactive cirrhosis. She is leading a 
healthy life at 4 years post transplantation.
DISCUSSION
The hepatic vasculature and the biliary tree 
may be injured during cholecystectomy (Lillemoe 
et al. 1997; Nishio et al. 1999; Erkan et al. 2001; 
Koffron et al. 2001; Buell et al. 2002; Bilge et al. 
2003). Although bile duct injury is more common, detailed studies show that “silent” concomitant arterial injury may be detected in patients 
with bile duct injury (Erkan et al. 2001; Koffron 
et al. 2001; Nordin et al. 2001). In rare cases, 
vascular injury occurs alone and causes dramatic 
tissue damage that initiates a series of events that 
lead to liver transplantation. The first report on 
such a patient was published in 1994. Inadvertent 
clipping of the right hepatic artery resulted in the 
development of a hepatic abscess in the right lobe 
and “necrosis in the central bile ducts” (Bacha et 
al. 1994). In the absence of extensive hepatic 
infarction due to vascular injury, the liver can 
usually be salvaged by treatment of the biliary 
lesion. However, since 1994, reports of patients 
who required liver transplantation for secondary 
biliary cirrhosis due to biliary tract injury (with 
and without concomitant vascular injury) have 
been published (Bacha et al. 1994; Robertson et 
al. 1998; Loinaz et al. 2001; Nordin et al. 2001, 
2002; de Santibanes et al. 2002; Fernandez et al. 
2004) (Table1).
Surgery is the main treatment method for 
complex biliary injuries. Unfortunately, a subgroup of patients (0-19%) has less than satisfactory outcome during a mean follow-up of only 
12-36 months (Ahrendt and Pitt 2001). The data 
on the long-term outcome of these patients are 
sparse. Although some centers report successful 
results in almost all patients with a combination 
of surgery and radiological techniques (Lillemoe 
et al. 1997; Johnson et al. 2000), biliary cirrhosis 
cannot always be prevented (Nordin et al. 2001). 
It must be noted that the patient reported in this 
paper had to undergo transplantation 15 years after cholecystectomy.
Roux-en-Y HJS is the technique of choice in 
the management of bile duct injuries occurring 
during open or laparoscopic surgery. Nevertheless, it is a technically demanding operation, 
which can ultimately lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis, especially if it fails in the first attempt 
(Mirza et al. 1997; Nordin et al. 2002; Fernandez 
et al. 2004). One possible cause of reconstruction 
failure may be concomitant vascular injury, which 
is clinically silent in the majority of the patients 

358 D. Öncel et al.
(Bilge et al. 2003). Although some reports accept 
concomitant vascular injury as a significant prognostic indicator, autopsy findings and anatomical 
studies do not support this idea. The authors do 
not recommend routine angiography since an 
association between vascular injuries and clinical 
outcome has not been shown (Bilge et al. 2003).
It must also be stressed that in many papers, 
outcome is rated as excellent “if there were no 
symptoms attributable to the biliary tract injury or 
reconstruction” or good “if mild symptoms not 
requiring invasive investigation and treatment” 
(Lillemoe et al.1997; Ahrendt et al. 2001). In 
other words, these “success” definitions include 
patients with residual cholestasis that has been 
asymptomatic during follow up. The long-term 
fate of the patients without excellent results 
according to the criteria proposed by Schweizer et 
al. (1991) (normal alkaline phosphatase, freedom 
from cholangitis, no obstruction and/or calculi on 
radiological investigations) has not received 
adequate attention. This issue is particularly 
important because the mean age of the patients 
with biliary injury is in the 40-50 ranges, i.e., a 
patient group with long life expectancy (Lillemoe 
et al. 1997; Johnson et al. 2000; Loinaz et al. 
2001; Buell et al. 2002). This case report and 
review of the literature suggests that liver transplantation will be a treatment modality for a 
selected group of patients with end-stage liver 
disease secondary to bile duct injury.
