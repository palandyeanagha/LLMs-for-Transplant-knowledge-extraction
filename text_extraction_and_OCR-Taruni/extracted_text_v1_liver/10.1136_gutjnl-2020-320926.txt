Abstract
Objective The SARS-­CoV-2-infected disease 
(COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings. 
Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical 
symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases 
with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine 
epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.
Design COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted 
in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 
February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, 
laboratory, management and outcome data of patients 
with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate 
analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics 
were used to analyse features of SARS-­CoV-2 from 
Zhejiang province.
Results Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) 
presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, 
vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-
day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver 
disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 
17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical 
types and family clustering, respectively, significantly 
higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) 
and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with 
GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) 
and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever 
>38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, 
respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics 
were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, 
respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate 
dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for 
severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence 
mutation of SARS-­CoV-2 with m6
A methylation and 
changed binding capacity with ACE 2.
Conclusion We report COVID-19 cases with GI
symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention 
to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms 
should increase to protect health providers.
Introduction
The outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2)-infected disease (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, 
Hubei province in December 20191
 and spread 
throughout China,2
 increasing the risk of global 
dissemination.3
 Although the Chinese government provided a quick response and took drastic 
measures, including quarantining Wuhan City on 
January 23, COVID-19 has become a major public 
health threat and economic burden on China. On 9 
February 2020, the date we finished data collection 
and started analysis, there were a total of 37251 
confirmed, 28942 suspected and 6188 severe/
critical cases, with 812 deaths and 2731 hospital 
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► The national spread and global sporadic 
appearance of the novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2)-infected disease (COVID-19) have 
become an enormous threat to human beings.
► Our understanding of COVID-19 has been 
greatly increased after efforts to study its 
gene homology with bat coronavirus, varied 
transmission capacity, potential effective drugs 
such as Remdesivir and other transmission 
routes such as faeces.
► Most of the current data are focused on 
Wuhan, which may have selection bias, since 
more severely affected patients were admitted 
to hospitals due to the region’s insufficient 
healthcare resources.
► In addition, respiratory symptoms and fevers 
have been overemphasised at times, while 
some non-classical symptoms have been 
overlooked, posing a threat to the public.

Significance of this study
What are the new findings?
► In this study, we report for the first time on the largest cohort 
of patients with COVID-19 outside Wuhan with GI symptoms.
► We found that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 
with GI symptoms was also higher than that in Wuhan.
► We uncovered novel characteristics of COVID-19, including 
increased family clustering and liver injury, severe/critical 
type tendency and higher rate of body temperature >38.5°C.
► The findings of novel m6 A methylation loci in the S protein 
of SARS-CoV-2 may provide underlining mechanisms for its 
change of virulence and transmission capacity during the 
spread.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
► Our results indicated that global authorities should pay more 
attention to patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms and 
its novel features, as those presentations may change the 
treatment strategy.
► GI doctors and other health professionals treating suspected 
patients with COVID-19 without respiratory symptoms and 
fever should take precautions.
discharges, according to official reports from the National Health 
Commission. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 
COVID-19 in Wuhan have been reported elsewhere,4 5 with estimated early transmission dynamics presented as the varied basic 
reproductive numbers (R0
) of 2.26 and 2.68,7 indicating a high 
virus transmission capacity.
SARS-CoV-2 was the seventh coronavirus identified with 
human infection capacity by the Chinese authorities. Its genomic 
features were revealed in a Wuhan patient, showing 89% and 
82% nuclear acid sequence similarity with Bat SARS-CoVZXC21 
and human SARS-CoV,
8
 respectively. Further functional studies 
indicated that the spike (S) protein of 2019-nCoV had a high 
affinity to ACE2, which is responsible for the virus invasion.9
It is well-known that viral mutations occur during transmission 
and spreading. Therefore, we would like to know the mutation 
and transmission ability, virulence change and associated clinical 
features of SARS-CoV-2 during its spread.
Currently, most published data focus on Wuhan, reporting an 
approximately 11% fatality rate caused by various complications 
such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute 
respiratory failure.4
 However, since Wuhan is the original location of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the disease outburst caused 
a shortage of healthcare resources; hence, the hospitals only 
admitted patients with severe/critical disease. In addition, ‘spring 
festival travel’, especially train transportation, greatly increased 
the risk of spreading the virus.10 Therefore, it is necessary to 
explore specific features of COVID-19 in areas outside Wuhan. 
Starting from January 17, SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in 
Zhejiang province, eventually reaching 1117 cases by February 
11, with 10.54% of cases having a lower severe/critical type of 
COVID-19 and zero death cases.
Since the latest study reported the finding of SARS-CoV-2 
nucleic acid in patient faeces11 and single cell analysis revealed 
the digestive system as a potential route for the virus infection,12
it is theoretically plausible that a portion of patients may present 
with GI tract symptoms. We should be very cautious about this 
speculation since the outpatient centres of GI endoscopy may 
become high-risk places. More formidably, doctors serving in 
these centres may behave less vigilantly, with lower levels of 
protective personal equipment compared with those doctors 
working in clinics serving those with fevers, unknowingly putting 
the GI practitioners under high exposure risk. Therefore, in this 
study, we provide the first report on the epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 
with GI symptoms outside Wuhan, which is helpful for disease 
control and medical staff protection.
Methods
Data sources and ethics
A retrospective study investigating the epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of COVID-19 between 17 
January 2020 and 8 February 2020 was performed. The data 
were uniformly collected by the Health Commission of Zhejiang 
province in designated hospitals, with all successfully enrolled 
patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 according to WHO 
interim guidance.13 Our preliminary data were reported to 
the authority of Zhejiang province and open for sharing with 
WHO. Written informed consent was waived by the ethics 
commission of the designated hospital, as this study was carried 
out for emerging infectious disease purposes and is part of a 
continuing public health outbreak investigation under national 
authorisation.
The definition of positive GI symptoms required that the 
patients have at least one of the following symptoms: nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea. GI symptoms were recorded on admission, precluding the influence of other medical therapy and 
external factors. The definition of diarrhoea was the passing of 
loose stools >3 times per day. A stool culture was performed 
with negative results for all patients with COVID-19 with GI 
symptoms. Since the diarrhoea was diagnosed on admission, 
those patients had no history of recent antibiotic use. Therefore, Clostridium difficile was not detected in the stools. Patients 
with COVID-19 were divided into four subtypes according to 
the degree of disease severity, based on the diagnosis and treatment scheme for SARS-CoV-2 of Chinese (sixth edition). The 
mild type is defined as having slight clinical symptoms without 
pneumonia on radiography. The common type is defined as 
presenting with fever and/or respiratory symptoms plus pneumonia on radiography. The severe type was diagnosed according 
to dyspnoea (respiratory rate (RR) ≥30 times/min), resting finger 
oxygen saturation ≤93%, artery PaO2
/FiO2≤300mm Hg (1 mm 
Hg=0.133kPa). The critical type is defined as respiratory failure 
with shock and multiorgan failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The definition 
of liver damage was alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >50U/L 
or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40U/L. The incubation 
period was calculated from the specific date of contact of the 
confirmed patient with COVID-19 to the time of onset of illness.
Procedures
Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic and outcome 
data were collected from patients’ medical records, with verification by independent doctors. Clinical outcomes were followed up 
to 8 February 2020, when specimens were obtained from throat 
swabs and sputum. For missing or vague data, direct communications with attending doctors and other healthcare providers 
were performed. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was 
performed in our hospital and the Centre for Disease Control 
and Prevention of Zhejiang province/city level under authorisation by previously reported real-time RT-PCR.

respiratory viruses were excluded, such as influenza A (H1N1, 
H3N2 and H7N9), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Outcomes
In this study, we collected and calculated epidemiological data 
(exposure to infected area, contact with confirmed/suspected 
patients with COVID-19, cluster situation and median incubation period) and other anthropometrics, demographics, symptoms and signs on admission. Laboratory and chest X-ray/CT 
results, comorbidities, treatments (including drugs, intensive 
care and mechanical ventilation) and clinical outcomes were also 
summarised.
Sequence alignment, transcriptional methylation site 
prediction and protein model electrostatic analysis
Gene sequences of SARS (AAS00003.1 and AY278489.2) and 
Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3) were obtained from the NCBI 
viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). ZJ01 
was separated and named from a Zhejiang patient (online 
supplementary material—ZJ01 sequence). SRAMP (http://www.
cuilab.cn/sramp) was used to analyse gene sequences and predict 
post-transcriptional methylation (N6-methyladenosine) modification sites. According to the results, the relevant predicted m6
A 
sites can be divided into four levels: very high, high, medium 
and low confidence. Multalin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/
multalin/multalin.html) was used to compare the differences 
among these sequences. The SWISS-MODEL online server 
(https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) was used to reconstruct the 
three-dimensional structure of proteins according to gene or 
amino sequence. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation can be used 
to calculate the electrostatic behaviour of S protein in aqueous 
solution through the vacuum electrostatics function of PyMol. 
Further analysis of the power of the protein model showed a 
difference in the electrostatic power distribution on the protein 
surface of the three virus strains.
Statistical analysis
For continuous variables, mean (SD) and median (IQR) were 
used for normally and abnormally distributed data, followed by 
unpaired t-test and non-parametric test when appropriate. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared 
using the χ2
 test. Univariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to identify the risk factors of severe/critical type patients. 
All significant variables achieved from univariate analysis were 
included in a multivariate logistic regression model with the 
forward method to identify independent predictors of the severe/
critical type. No adjustment for multiple testing was performed. 
A two-sided α of <0.05 was considered statistically significant 
and SPSS (V.26.0) was used for all analyses.
Results
Demographic and epidemiological characteristics
This study enrolled 651 patients with confirmed COVID-19 
from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020 in Zhejiang province, among which 74 (11.4%) patients presented with at least 
one GI tract symptom (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), which 
was higher than previous Wuhan data (table 1). In detail, of 
74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 53 patients 
had only the symptom of diarrhoea, 11 patients had only the 
symptom of vomiting and 10 patients had only the symptom of 
nausea. In addition, only three patients had all the GI symptoms 
of diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea, while four patients had the 
symptoms of both nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea was the most 
common GI symptom in this study and accounted for 8.14% 
of the total enrolled 651 patients with COVID-19, which was 
higher than the rate of 3.8% reported previously.14 Of 53 
patients with COVID-19 with diarrhoea, the median duration 
period was 4 days (IQR: 3–6 days), with the shortest duration 
of 1day and longest of 9 days. Most diarrhoea was self-limiting.
The average age of the patients with GI symptoms was 
46.14±14.19 years and the male:female ratio was 1:1. There 
were no coexisting conditions of cancer, chronic renal disease, 
pregnancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunosuppression. Thirty-eight (51.35%) patients had a Wuhan exposure history and 32 (43.24%) patients had a history of contact 
with patients with COVID-19. Intriguingly, the rate of chronic 
liver disease was 10.81% in patients with COVID-19 with GI 
symptoms, which was significantly higher than that of 2.95% 
in those without GI symptoms (p=0.004). More importantly, 
the rate of the severe/critical type was also markedly increased 
in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms than in those 
without GI symptoms (22.97% vs 8.14%, p<0.001). Family 
clustering is another pivotal phenomenon of COVID-19. We 
identified that 23 (31.08%) patients with GI symptoms had 
family clustering, which was prominently higher than that in 
patients without GI symptoms (20.45%, p=0.037). Twenty-one 
patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms and 195 without 
them had definite exposure times, with the median calculated 
incubation period as 4 days (IQR 3–7 days) and 5 days (IQR 3–8 
days), respectively.
Clinical features and laboratory abnormalities
The clinical characteristics of patients with GI symptoms are 
shown in table 2. Fever, cough and sputum production were the 
most common symptoms. Of the aforementioned symptoms, 29

(85.14%) had fever, with the highest temperature of 40.3°C. 
Additionally, 21 patients (28.38%) lacked respiratory symptoms of coughing and sputum production and presented only 
with GI symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Moreover, the rate of increased AST, but not ALT, was significantly 
higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms than in 
those without GI symptoms (29.35 vs 24.4, p=0.02). Finally, 
although most radiographic presentations were similar between 
patients with COVID-19 with and without GI symptoms, the 
rate of unilateral pneumonia was 12.16% in patients with GI 
symptoms, much lower than 23.22% in those without GI symptoms (p=0.030). Concerning infection-related markers, there 
was no significant difference in both procalcitonin and C reactive protein (CRP) between patients with COVID-19 with and 
without GI symptoms.
Complications and treatment
As shown in table 3, 5 (6.76%), 13 (17.57%) and 1 (1.35%) 
patient with COVID-19 with GI symptoms had complications 
of ARDS, liver injury and shock, respectively, where the former 
two were significantly higher than their counterparts of 2.08% 
and 8.84% in patients with COVID-19 without GI symptoms, respectively (p=0.034; p=0.035). All 74 patients with 
COVID-19 with GI symptoms were treated in isolation with

received antiviral treatment, including interferon-α sprays, 
arbidol hydrochloride capsules (two tablets three times daily), 
lopinavir and ritonavir two tablets (500mg) twice daily, via the 
oral route. Furthermore, the average time from illness onset to 
antiviral therapy was 5.56±4.09 days. Compared with Wuhan 
data, we had lower rates of glucocorticoid and antibiotic use, 
14.86% and 41.89%, respectively. No patients received continuous blood purification due to renal failure, and no patients were 
treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Until now, 
only one patient has died. Five (6.76%) patients with COVID-19 
with GI symptoms were treated with mechanical ventilation and 
transferred to the ICU, which was a significantly higher rate than 
that of 2.08% in the patients with COVID-19 without GI symptoms (p=0.034).
Prediction of risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 in 
patients with GI symptoms
Of severe/critical patients with COVID-19, 22.97% presented 
with GI symptoms in this study. When compared with mild and 
common COVID-19, initial univariate analysis of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables identified 11 significantly 
changed risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19, including 
increased ORs of age, age ≥50 years, period between illness 
onset and hospital visit, sputum production, any existing 
medical condition, multiple lung infection, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose and CRP, as well as decreased OR 
of the infected area (online supplementary table 1). Based on 
these variables, further multivariate analysis using the forward 
method was performed, and we found that sputum production 
of patients from infected areas such as Wuhan and increased 
LDH/glucose levels were the independent risk factors for severe/
critical COVID-19 in patients with GI symptoms (table 4).
Sequence alignment and protein model structure analysis
ZJ01 is a strain of SARS-CoV-2 with 29381 bases. The results of 
the potential methylation sites of S protein sequences of SARS, 
Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 indicated that there were significant 
differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS. These coronaviruses can infect host cells through using the S protein to bind to 
the host cell surface receptor ACE2. During virus maturation, 
S proteins are glycosylated and divided into the parts S1 and 
S2. S1 is spherical and mainly involved in the recognition and 
binding of viruses to host cells. S2 is stalked and able to promote 
the fusion of the virus into host cells. The comparison results of 
three virus strains showed that ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 had one 
high-confidence site, two moderate-confidence sites and four 
low-confidence sites. SARS has three high-confidence sites, three 
moderate-confidence sites and five low-confidence sites. From 
the perspective of high-confidence sites (figure 1A, red arrow), 
the potential methylation points of SARS-CoV-2 (n=1) and 
SARS (n=3) are predominantly concentrated in the S1 and S2 
segments of the S protein. The positions of two low-confidence 
sites and one medium-confidence site on S2 are relatively fixed 
among the three virus strains (blue arrow). These results suggest 
that the S proteins of the two viruses may have structural and 
functional differences due to m6
A methylation during transcription and translation.
Additionally, the results of gene sequence alignment 
(figure 1B) showed that the variation in S protein sequences 
between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 was subtle, and these variations 
were highly concentrated in the S2 segment. These variations 
resulted in five amino acid substitutions and two amino acid 
deletions. However, from the perspective of the simulated threedimensional protein structure, the effect of these variations on 
the overall S protein structure is relatively limited. The difference 
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS is significant, especially at the 
specific recognition point position in segment S1 (figure 1C, red 
circle). On the one hand, this change may affect the viral binding 
force on host cells. On the other hand, the electrostatic changes 
between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 are largely concentrated in 
the mutation zone of S2 (figure 1C, green ellipse), where the 
detailed mechanisms need further exploration.
Discussion
The national spread and global sporadic appearance of 
SARS-CoV-2 have become an enormous threat to human beings, 
and the threat is not restricted to China. An endeavour has been 
made by scientists to reveal the epidemiological, clinical and 
virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 with over 30 publications published in PubMed by 5 February 2020.2 4–7 Nevertheless, most of these studies focused on the situation in Wuhan, 
China. In addition, the initiative for SARS-CoV-2 screening 
started from fever clinics, while fever, cough and shortness of 
breath were the most emphasised symptoms, which increases the 
risk of omitting those patients with other symptoms and normal 
body temperature. It is theoretically plausible that one characteristic of a viral spread is an increased transmission capacity at the 
cost of decreased virulence, which is also true for SARS-CoV-2.15
Therefore, caution should be exercised for suspected patients 
with COVID-19 who had normal body temperatures and visited 
various outpatient clinics for non-respiratory symptoms.

the mutation of the ZJ01 S protein.
The suspected patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 
such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, should be seriously 
considered, since accumulated evidence supports SARS-CoV-2 
transmission through faeces11 and tears16 and its ability to bind 
to ACE2 of the GI tract has been identified.9 12 In this study, we 
reported the epidemiological, clinical and virological features of 
74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms from Zhejiang 
province. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes 
the situation of patients with COVID-19 GI symptoms and is 
the largest group of cases outside Wuhan. Our novel findings 
are valuable for disease prevention by emphasising suspected 
patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms and their specific 
clinical characteristics.
Among the 651 total patients with COVID-19 we investigated, the rate of patients with GI symptoms was 11.4%, which 
is higher than in the previously reported data of 3% from 
Wuhan.4
 However, a recent report from Wuhan revealed that 
10.1% experienced nausea/diarrhoea and 3.6% vomiting.17
Additionally, the latest data from Wuhan revealed that 79.1% 
of patients with COVID-19 presented GI symptoms, but such 
data were collected during 1–10 days after illness onset and 
reported in a Chinese domestic journal,18 differing from our 
strategy of collecting GI symptom data on admission that 
may be less biassed by various influencing factors, including 
drugs. More importantly, nationwide data showed GI symptoms in 8.7% of 1099 confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2,14
reinforcing our data. All these data indicated that there were 
symptom changes in patients with COVID-19. We suspect that 
SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute gastritis and enteritis, as evidenced 
by the vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. Since previous studies

Covid-19
indicated high ACE2 expression in the GI tract, we envision that 
such a change indicates the potential of virus mutation towards 
increased transmissibility, decreased virulence and multiorgan 
infection, as reflected in the clinics of increased R0 and infection 
routes. Taken together, the patients with COVID-19 showed an 
increased tendency to present with GI symptoms in dissemination, increasing infection risk in healthcare providers who were 
treating suspected patients with COVID-19 without respiratory 
symptoms and fever.
We further analysed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms. We 
identified a significantly higher rate of >38.5°C fever and family 
clustering, increased complications of ARDS and a high severity 
tendency (rate of severe/critical type, mechanical ventilation 
and ICU admission) in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, when compared with those without GI symptoms. We 
suspect that GI symptoms may cause patients with COVID-19 
to be more prone to electrolyte disturbance, such as significantly 
decreased serum sodium levels (p=0.016), and hence they trend 
towards the severe/critical type of the disease. Other reasons 
should be considered and explored based on future data. In 
addition, the higher rates of familial clustering may be related 
to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households. Further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas 
and increased LDH/glucose levels as independent risk factors 
for the disease. In addition, symptoms of fatigue, shortness of 
breath and headache were also significantly higher in patients 
with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, which may be caused by 
their higher fevers and increased electrolyte imbalance. Liver 
damage should be carefully monitored, as we found significantly 
increased AST levels and coexisting conditions of liver disease 
in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms. Since the ratio 
of chronic liver disease was higher in patients with COVID-19 
with GI symptoms, it could lead to increased levels of ALT and 
AST. Although there were no significant differences in glucocorticoid and antibiotic therapy between patients with COVID-19 
with and without GI symptoms, they were both lower than their 
counterparts in Wuhan,4
 showing our own experience in effective therapy.
The change and mutation of SARS-CoV-2 are the basis of its 
variation in epidemiological and clinical features. Using in-depth 
bioinformatics analysis of the novel identified SARS-CoV-2 
sequence from Zhejiang province, we identified many m6
A 
methylation sites in the S1 segment of ZJ01 and S2 segment of 
SARS, indicating that the S proteins of the two viruses may have 
structural and functional differences due to m6
A methylation. 
The addition of chemical modifications is critical to many steps 
of mRNA processing and fate regulation, while the most abundant internal modification is N6
-methyladenosin.19 20 Given the 
wide prevalence of m6
A modification on cellular mRNA, it is not 
surprising that a number of viruses contain m6
A in their RNA.21 22
The function of m6
A methylation on viruses may be diverse 
with both proviral and antiviral roles.23 24 Coronaviruses are 
enveloped RNA viruses containing the largest single-stranded, 
positive-sense RNA genome with a length between 25.5 and 
32kb.25 In contrast to previously reported m6
A modification in 
viruses, methylation at the N7 position of the 5’-cap structure of 
coronavirus RNA is commonly identified, which facilitates viral 
RNA escape recognition by the host innate immune system.26
Therefore, our findings on the novel m6
A methylation situation 
in SARS-CoV-2 may provide a novel mechanism for further 
study.
A large reservoir of SARS-like bat coronavirus has the capacity 
to efficiently use the human ACE2 receptor for docking, 
replication and entry.27 ACE2 is predominantly expressed 
in human alveolar cells and intestinal epithelial cells. The 
binding force change is caused by the sequence mutation of 
SARS-CoV-2, which merits further investigation. We found that 
the electrostatic changes between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 were 
highly concentrated in the mutation zone of S2 (the portion of S 
protein which promotes the fusion of the virus into host cells). 
Therefore, further studies exploring the underlining mechanisms 
for these conformations and binding force changes are urgently 
needed. These may help explain the increased GI symptoms in 
the later phase of this virus outbreak and their novel epidemiological/clinical features.
This study has several limitations . First, it is better to obtain 
the outcomes and more detailed therapeutic responses in a 
cohort study of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms. 
Second, although the risk factors for the severe/critical type 
of COVID-19 were identified according to patient data on 
admission, there is still a lack of a predictive model for disease 
progression. Third, cytokine storm is common in coronavirus28
and reported in a previous SARS-CoV-2 study5
; thus, it would 
be better if we could also detect cytokine changes in this study. 
Fourth, it will have more clinical relevance to propose an effective strategy for identifying patients with COVID-19 with GI 
symptoms who lack the typical symptoms such as fever and 
cough in the early stage. According to our experience, we should 
pay more attention to exposure history and family clustering 
during the screening process. Fifth, it would be meaningful to 
investigate the correlation between the viral genome and GI 
symptoms. Finally, since over 50% of SARS-CoV-2 was detected 
in the faeces according to one study,29 the prevalence of viral 
RNA from faeces samples in patients with GI symptoms should 
be compared with those in patients without GI symptoms in the 
future. Moreover, because of the relatively low detection rate for 
virus in the stool (three of nine patients with COVID-19 positive 
in our hospital) and rare stool samples were re-tested for the 
virus in patients after their recovery in this study, it is difficult 
to evaluate the implications of faecal-oral transmission, so this 
needs further investigation.
In summary, we reported, for the first time, the largest cases of 
patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms outside Wuhan and 
showed its novel characteristics of increased family clustering 
and liver injury, severe/critical tendency and higher rate of body 
temperature >38.5°C. Global authorities should pay more attention to patients with COVID-19 with GI and other non-classic 
symptoms and remain cautious in health provider protection.
