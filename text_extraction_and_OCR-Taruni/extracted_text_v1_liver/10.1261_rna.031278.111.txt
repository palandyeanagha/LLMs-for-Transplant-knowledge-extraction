ABSTRACT
miRNAs are ~22-nt RNAs that bind to the Argonaute family of proteins and have important regulatory roles in plants and
animals. Here, we show that miRNAs exhibit targeting activity in cells when delivered as single strands that are
59-phosphorylated and that contain 29-fluoro ribose modifications. Length preferences, chemical modification sensitivity, and
genome-wide seed-based targeting all suggest that this activity is Ago-based. Activity could be enhanced by annealing of
segmented passenger strands containing non-nucleic acid spacers. Furthermore, screening of randomly generated sequences
identified pyrimidine rich 39 cassette sequences that increased single strand activity. These results provide an initial step in the
development of single-stranded miRNA mimics for therapeutic use.

INTRODUCTION
Shortly after the demonstration that double-stranded siRNAs
could be designed to trigger RNA cleavage in mammalian
cells (Elbashir et al. 2001), single-stranded, 59-phosphorylated
siRNAs were also found to induce RNAi, but at a greatly
reduced potency (Martinez et al. 2002; Schwarz et al. 2002).
Even though the incorporation of free, single-stranded RNA
into Ago2 is not known to be common in nature, singlestranded RNAi has potential as a therapeutic agent, especially
given progress in the antisense field in the safe and effective
dosing of single-stranded oligonucleotides (Raal et al. 2010).
Chemical modification has shown to be important for
the therapeutic development of double-stranded siRNAs,
resulting in increased nuclease stability, improved potency,
reduced off-target effects, and elimination of immune stimulation (Bramsen and Kjems 2011). Work is also being
done to chemically improve single-stranded siRNAs, with
a recent paper showing that formulated, 29-fluoro modified single-stranded siRNA has activity in vivo (Haringsma
et al. 2012) and presentations showing that extensive chemical modification, including 59 vinyl phosphonates, phosphorothioates, and 29-fluoro ribose, can allow subcutaneous
delivery of unformulated single-stranded siRNAs with potency comparable to antisense oligonucleotides (Swayze et al.
2011).
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of z22-nt noncoding
RNAs that play roles in regulating gene expression in plants
and animals. Precursor miRNA hairpins are usually cut by
Dicer in the cytoplasm to produce a double-stranded duplex
that is incorporated into Argonaute (Ago) proteins (Kim et al.
2009). After elimination of the passenger strand by cleavage
and/or helicase activity, the guide strand binds complementary mRNAs. Studies suggest that the most prevalent form of
consequential target recognition occurs through complementary binding to a target 39 untranslated region (UTR) by
the miRNA seed region (positions 2 through 8 at the 59 end
of the guide strand), leading to down-regulation of mRNA
and protein levels (Bartel 2009).
While previous work analyzing single-stranded activity
has focused on siRNAs, miRNAs also hold therapeutic
promise, as restoration of miRNA levels is likely to be of
benefit in maintaining tissue differentiation and inhibiting
oncogenesis (Henry et al. 2011). Furthermore, the seedbased targeting of miRNAs allows for structures that would
never be tolerated as siRNAs (Chorn et al. 2010), a characteristic that may be advantageous in optimizing miRNA
single-strand mimics. We, therefore, decided to investigate

whether chemically modified single
strands can have miRNA activity and if
there were ways to enhance that activity.
RESULTS
We investigated the effects of 59-phosphorylation and 29-fluoro modifications
in the context of the microRNA miR124, a brain-specific miRNA whose targeting we have studied extensively (Lim
et al. 2005; Chorn et al. 2010) and that
may have potential use in suppressing
liver cancer (Hatziapostolou et al. 2011).
We tested eight different 29-fluoro/29-
ribo/29-o-methyl modification patterns,
with or without a 59 phosphate. Activity
was assayed by measuring mRNA knockdown of two known miR-124 targets,
CD164 (Fig. 1A) and VAMP3 (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Negligible activity in
cell transfection assays was observed
from miR-124 single strands containing
0, 6, or 7 29-fluoros, while maximum
single-stranded activity was observed from
the patterns that contained both a 59
phosphate and greater numbers (12, 13,
or 19) of 29-fluoro modifications. Without the 59 phosphate, only the pattern
with 19 29-fluoros (‘‘21-8’’) had substantial activity. None of the singlestranded oligonucleotides was as potent
as duplex miR-124, showing that there
is substantial room for improvement of
single-strand modification patterns.
We next tested a set of singlestranded, 59-phosphorylated, 29-fluoro
oligos that all contained the miR-124 59
sequence but that varied in length from
10 to 22 nt due to the addition of increasing amounts of the miR-124 39 sequence. Maximum activity was observed
for lengths of 19 to 22 nt (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous observations that
miRNAs are of length 19 to 24 and
consistent with the idea that the singlestranded miR-124 is acting through an
Ago-dependent pathway.
We also tested the effect of substitution
of a single 29-o-methyl modification at
every position along a 59-phosphorylated,
29-fluoro 21-mer (Fig. 1C). Interestingly,
substitution of a single 29-fluoro by a
29-o-methyl had little effect on miR-124
activity, except for the substitution 2 nt FIGURE 1. (Legend on next page)

from the 59 end, which led to a dramatic loss in potency.
This result is in line with the previous observation that
a 29-o-methyl substitution at position 2 causes a significant
reduction in Ago-based activity (Jackson et al. 2006). Furthermore, the fact that no other single substitution greatly
decreases miR-124 activity suggests that the enhancement of
single-strand activity is due to a distribution of 29-fluoros
across the transcript and not to one particular 29-fluoro.
Given that miRNA activity often diminishes the transcript levels of many targets, we evaluated the activity of
single-stranded miR-124 by transfecting cells and analyzing
transcriptome-wide effects using a microarray (Lim et al.
2005). Analysis of the 39 UTRs of the down-regulated genes
shows that the most significantly enriched hexamer and
heptamer motifs are complementary matches to the miR-124
seed region (Fig. 2), providing objective evidence that singlestranded miR-124 carries out seed-based targeting, consistent
with what is known about Ago-based miRNA activity.
Despite the fact that a chemically modified single-stranded
miR-124 has clear seed-based activity, it is still not as potent
as a duplex: For example, the addition of a passenger strand
to the 21-8p guide strand leads to a substantial increase in
activity (Fig. 3). We, therefore, sought to determine if activity
could be regained by adding back portions of the passenger
strand to an active single strand, with the eventual goal of
defining minimal structures for future studies of miRNA
mimics. We first tested the effects of adding back either
a 59 or 39 fragment of the passenger strand. This type of
structure was tested previously in the context of an siRNA
with a predominantly RNA guide strand (Bramsen et al.
2007) in a study that observed activity only when both
passenger fragments were annealed to the guide strand and
not when one or none of the passenger fragments was annealed. In this paper, since 21-8p has activity by itself, we are
able to detect effects of the passenger fragments on the guide
strand’s baseline activity. Interestingly, annealing of either the
59 fragment (P9, which forms 9 bp) or the 39 fragment (P.10,
which forms 8 bp and a 2-base overhang) led to a significant
decrease of activity relative to the original 21-8p single strand
(Fig. 3). In contrast, annealing both fragments at once led to
a dramatic increase in activity, close to that observed after
annealing a full-length passenger strand. These results suggest
that both passenger fragments are able to bind the guide
strand individually but must be bound simultaneously if
they are to enhance, and not impede, activity.
To follow up on these results, we added 6, 7, or 8 bp of
complementarity simultaneously to both ends of the guide
strand, connecting the 59 and 39 binding segments with a
linker segment consisting of carbon spacers to improve binding affinity (Fig. 4). The addition of the passenger strand that
created 8 bp of double-stranded nucleic acid at both ends
of the guide strand (P8.8c3) resulted in a significant increase
in potency compared with the guide strand alone, though it
was still not as active as the fully duplexed guide strand.
Conversely, the addition of a passenger strand with 6- or
7-bp ends (P6.6c3 and P7.7c3, respectively) had either negligible or negative effects when compared to the single-strand
guide strand by itself. Given our previous results, this may be
a result of loss of binding at one end or another due to the
small regions of complementarity; we, therefore, added locked
nucleic acid (LNA) bases to increase binding affinity (Bramsen
et al. 2007). The addition of LNAs did, in fact, improve the
activity of P6.6c3 and P7.7c3, with the P7.7c3-2.2LNA
having similar activity to P8.8c3.
The seed-based activity of miRNAs provides the opportunity to study the influence of the base composition of
the 39 half of the single strand on
activity without making major changes
to target site complementarity. We,
therefore, designed single-strand oligos
that shared the miR-124 21-8p seed
sequence and chemical modification
pattern but in which bases 10 through
19 were randomly generated. Eightyeight sequences were synthesized, after
binning into 11 different sets of eight

based on pyrimidine content (i.e., 0 to 10 pyrimidines).
The activity of each oligo was tested against miR-124 targets
CD164 and VAMP3 (Fig. 5A; Supplemental Fig. S4), and
several sequences showed greater activity than the original
miR-124 sequence. Importantly, a significant positive
correlation was observed between pyrimidine content of
the random cassette and activity (correlation = 0.64, P-val =
2 3 1011). A sequence logo of the top quartile performers
(Fig. 5B) clearly shows this enrichment for pyrimidines in
the highest performing oligos, suggesting that pyrimidines
are more conducive to single-strand activity than purines, at
least in the context of a highly 29-fluoro single strand.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that not every high
pyrimidine cassette was a top performer. Further experiments
will likely be required to understand the reasons for this.
We also tested whether a 39 cassette sequence that had
been identified in the context of a miR-124 seed could be
of use when fused to the seed region of a different miRNA,
the liver-specific miR-122. Perhaps because of its relatively
low pyrimidine content, the original miR-122 sequence had
little activity as a fluorinated single strand against the miR122 target GYS1, especially when compared with a duplex
miR-122 (Fig. 5C). However, when the 39 miR-122 sequence
was replaced with one of the high performing cassettes
(‘‘9Y_2,’’ containing 9 pyrimidines), targeting activity was
greatly enhanced, both against GYS1 (Fig. 5C) and SLC7A1
(Supplemental Fig. S5). These data make it unlikely that the
enhanced activity is due to serendipitous pairing of the
cassette region to the target site, given that the same cassette
improved activity against four different mRNA targets (of
two different miRNAs). Furthermore, analysis of the target
site sequences showed no evidence for additional pairing
from the cassette sequence being responsible for the improved activity (Supplemental Fig. S6).
DISCUSSION
Our results show that 59-phosphorylated, 29-fluoro modified oligonucleotides exhibit substantial miRNA seed-based
activity in cells. Although we have not shown direct biochemical evidence that this is an Ago-mediated process, the
observation of pervasive seed-based activity suggests that
these strands are being incorporated into Ago proteins.
Furthermore, the length preference of 19 to 22 nt, as
well as the sensitivity to modification at position 2 by a
29-o-methyl, are also indicators of Ago-based activity.
Since even a fully 29-fluoro modified single strand had
less activity than duplex RNA, it will be important to find
ways to further improve the potency of single-stranded
miRNA mimics while still maintaining some of its singlestrand nature. One method tried here was the annealing of
passenger strand fragments to the guide strand. Duplexes of
6, 7, and 8 bp at both ends of the guide strand (coupled
with a linker between the fragments and addition of LNA
modifications to the 6- or 7-bp fragments) were found to
improve activity. Previous observations have found that
shorter passenger strands forming around 14 contiguous
base pairs of duplex with a guide strand have significant
siRNA activity (Chu and Rana 2008; Sun et al. 2008). Our
results agree with these findings and extend them by showing
that the duplex portions can be separated by extensive gaps.
The toleration of these gaps may improve delivery of miRNA
mimics by reducing overall mass and charge and allowing
the insertion of chemical moieties that enhance delivery or
Ago activity. It will also be interesting to see if it is possible to
create even smaller duplex structures at the very ends of the
single strand that lead to increased activity.
On the other hand, we were surprised to observe that the
asymmetric formation of 8 or 9 bp of duplex at the 59 or 39

end of the guide strand, respectively, led to a decrease in
activity relative to the original single strand. It is possible
that the pathways for single-stranded and double-stranded
incorporation into Ago are distinct and that a structure in
which one end is single-stranded and one end is doublestranded prevents productive entry into either. Alternatively,
perhaps an 8- or 9-bp passenger fragment is unable to be
released following incorporation into the RISC, while longer
passenger strands can be detected by the RISC and cleaved
and/or removed. Obviously, more biochemical approaches
will be required to understand this behavior.
By randomizing the 39 sequence of single-stranded miR124, we were also able to identify sequences that promoted
its activity. These sequences tended to contain a high percentage of pyrimidines, which may reflect a positive effect of
pyrimidines or a negative effect of purines. Importantly, we
found that replacing 10 bases of the 39 sequence of a miR-122
single strand with a pyrimidine-rich cassette sequence greatly
enhanced its potency, showing that 39 sequence optimization
could be a powerful tool in developing miRNA mimics.
Understanding the reasons why certain sequences work well
in this context will be an interesting area for further study.
We have little understanding of why 29-fluoro content and
pyrimidine content have such beneficial effects on the activity
of single strands. The 29-fluoro modification’s unique electronegativity helps to maintain a C39-endo conformation and
gives oligonucleotides novel hydrophobic properties and basestacking properties (Manoharan et al. 2011). It is possible that
29-fluoro content and certain pyrimidine-rich sequences help
to put single strands into a conformation or hydration state
that facilitates Ago binding and enhances stability.
These studies provide an initial step in the development
of single-stranded miRNA mimetics and suggest that their
effectiveness can be improved by using certain sequences
and modification patterns. Addition of further chemical
modifications such as phosphorothioates should allow for
the in vivo delivery of nonformulated single strands, providing a way to dose miRNA mimics without the complications of delivery vehicles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligonucleotide synthesis
Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Sigma or Merck & Co. using
standard solid-phase synthesis followed by purification by ionexchange chromatography. Passenger strands were annealed by
combining oligonucleotides at 10 mM in 10 mM pH7.5 Tris-HCl/
50 mM NaCl and heating at 95°C for 2 min, followed by gradual
cooling for 1 h to 37°C.
qPCR measurement
HCT-116 cells, cultured in McCoy’s 5A Medium, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin,
and plated at a density of 6000 cells/well in 96-well culture plates
24 h prior to transfection, were transfected with Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Media
(GIBCO). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were rinsed
with phosphate-buffered saline and processed with the Cells-toCT Kit (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene-specific probes were
used on an ABI Prism 9700HT Sequence Detector for RT-qPCR.
Reverse transcription conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50°C,
10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, and 1 min
at 60°C. GUSB mRNA levels were used for data normalization.
Knockdown was calculated as DCt = CtTarget – CtGUSB and DDCt =
DCt(exp) – DCt(ctrl) and relative expression level = 2–DDCt and %
knockdown = 100 3 (1 – 2–DDCt).
Microarray and bioinformatics analysis
HCT-116 cells were transfected with 10 nM miRNA as described
previously (Jackson et al. 2006). RNA was extracted using RNeasy
(Qiagen), amplified using the Ovation protocol (Nugen), and profiled on custom Affymetrix arrays (Rosetta Custom Human 2.0,
Affymetrix). Array signals were analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip
Operating Software and Affymetrix Power Tools. UTR hexamer
and heptamer enrichment was analyzed using the hypergeometric
distribution as described previously (Jackson et al. 2006). Sequence
logo was generated using WebLogo (Crooks et al. 2004).
