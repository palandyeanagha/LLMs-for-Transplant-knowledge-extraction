Both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May 
have recently expressed their support 
for a change to the law in England to 
introduce an opting-out system for organ 
donation, and the Department of Health 
is consulting on the issue. This is based 
on the assumption that it would make 
a significant impact on the shortage of 
organs for transplantation and thus save 
hundreds of lives each year. It is a popular 
assumption, because the intention is so 
obviously well meaning. Sadly, though, it is 
an assumption that offers false hope.
WOULD A CHANGE IN THE LAW 
INCREASE DECEASED DONATION?
There is no good evidence from anywhere 
in the world that a change in the law 
leads to a sustained increase in donation. 
Indeed, there are countries where in fact 
donation has decreased, and Brazil offers 
perhaps the best example of this. The few 
publications that suggest a possible benefit 
have important methodological flaws that 
make it very difficult to isolate the impact 
of the law.1 The evidence was reviewed in 
great detail as part of the second Organ 
Donation Taskforce report in 2008,2 and 
little has changed since then. So what is 
the basis for the assumption? There are at 
least two important misunderstandings in 
the case that are often made. First, there 
is the superficially attractive observation 
of the Spanish donation experience. Spain 
has opting-out legislation and for many 
years has had the highest donation rate in 
the world. But the Spanish authorities have 
stated repeatedly that their ‘success’ does 
not stem from the law.3 Opting out was 
introduced in Spain in 1979, with no apparent 
effect. Ten years later, in 1989, a national 
transplant organisation was established 
with a wide-ranging brief to transform the 
donation system, based primarily on the 
employment of medically qualified donor 
coordinators in every hospital. The effects 
were immediate, and Spain has led the way 
since then. The Spanish model has been 
introduced successfully in other regions and 
countries, including northern Italy, Croatia, 
and Portugal. There were no changes in the 
law, but there were dramatic increases in 
organ donation as a result of nationally led 
changes in clinical practice in intensive care 
units (ICUs). Moreover, Spain does not in 
fact operate an opting-out system — there 
is no register for people to either opt in or 
opt out. As in England, consent for donation 
is explicit and comes either from the patient 
in life or through their family. 
There is one other important factor 
relevant to the Spanish success: different 
countries have different numbers of 
potential donors. Very few patients die in 
circumstances that allow organ donation 
to proceed (about one in a 100 in the 
UK). For clinical and practical reasons the 
patient must die from the ‘right’ diseases 
(that is, be free of transmissible agents 
such as cancer and significant infections), 
in the ‘right’ place (that is, in hospital 
and probably in an ICU), and in the ‘right’ 
way (that is, death must be, at least to 
some extent, expected and predictable). 
Most donors have suffered a catastrophic 
brain injury from intracerebral bleeding, 
trauma, or hypoxia, and have been treated 
in intensive care. For many years Spain has 
had between two and three times as many 
ICU beds per capita compared with the UK. 
Different resources and approaches to endof-life care result in different numbers of 
potential donors — and therefore of actual 
donors.
Second, a common misunderstanding 
is that under current opt-in legislation ‘in 
order to be a donor you have to have opted 
in, by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register 
(ODR)’. Because only 36% of the population 
have signed up there is a false belief that 
the other 64% will never be donors, because 
they haven’t opted in. In fact, in the UK last 
year the families of almost all brain dead 
potential donors were approached about 
donation,4 regardless of whether the patient 
was registered on the ODR. Certainly 
registration is to be encouraged as it makes 
it so much easier for the family to know 
their relative’s wishes, but it is absolutely 
not a requirement. Over 90% of families 
now agree to donation when the patient 
was registered but about 70% agree even 
when the patient was not registered. The 
suggestion that opting out would somehow 
add the ‘missing’ 64% of the population to 
the donor pool is quite wrong — in practice, 
they are there already.
The only experience of opting out in the 
UK comes from Wales, where legislation 
for what is called ‘deemed consent’ was 
introduced in December 2015. Although this 
still allows a role for the patient’s family, 
this is limited to providing information 
about the patient’s wishes, and the family’s 
attitude to donation should not be relevant. 
The numbers are small and it is premature 
to draw conclusions but in the first full year 
after the new law was introduced donor 
numbers were almost unchanged, while in 
the first 6 months of the second year they 
have fallen (on an annualised basis) by 14% 
(compared with a rise of 9% in England in 
the same time period).5
IS OPTING OUT A ‘BETTER’ FORM OF 
CONSENT?
There are also ethical and practical 
concerns about a change to the law. Optingout laws cover a spectrum but are usually 
described as either ‘hard’ or ‘soft’. Under a 
hard system organs will be removed after 
death if the individual has not opted out, and 
the family have no role. It is this system that 
leads to the frequently heard objection that 
the state is taking over the person’s body 
after death, and there are major ethical 
concerns. Consent is an active process that 
cannot be ‘presumed’ simply because no 
objection is known. It is not clear that such 
a system would be acceptable to intensive 
care clinicians, who play such a vital role in 
the care of potential donors. Under a soft 
system there is a presumption in favour 
of donation but the family have the final 
say. Ethically this is far less troublesome. 
However, it is not always apparent that 
the media and the public are aware of 
the differences between a hard and a soft 
system, and the widespread objection to the 
former may have an adverse effect on the 
possible acceptability of the latter, and so 
have an adverse impact on donation.
ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?
So if opting out is not the solution, what 
is? For nearly 20 years the UK had a 
poor record in organ donation, and the 
Organ donation:
opting in or opting out?

pursuing a change in the law …”

numbers were falling from the start of 
this century. In 2008 the Organ Donation 
Taskforce report was published6 with a 
series of recommendations that have all 
been implemented. They have transformed 
the donation system and overall donor 
numbers have increased by over 70% since 
then, and continue to do so — at least 
in England.7 Key to this transformation 
has been tremendous work by intensive 
care clinicians and the specialist nurses 
who work with them, combined with 
central support from a national donation 
organisation, NHS Blood and Transplant. 
Fundamental to this has been the move 
to recognise donation as being in the best 
interests of an individual who had wished 
to be a donor rather than seeing potential 
organ donors simply as a source of organs 
for someone else — autonomy rather than 
utilitarianism, if you like. These results 
are spectacular but everyone concerned 
knows that there is much more that can 
and should be done — and they are working 
hard to do it.
These results speak for themselves 
and more of the same would seem to 
be an excellent policy. GPs and practice 
nurses can play a valuable role by including 
organ donation in any discussions about 
a patient’s end-of-life wishes and by 
promoting the Organ Donor Register 
alongside other public health issues (‘stop 
smoking, lose weight, and join the Organ 
Donor Register’). The need for more organs 
for transplantation is pressing, but there 
seems to be little merit in pursuing a change 
in the law that appears to revert to the 
utilitarian approach that is now discredited 
and is unproven, controversial, expensive, 
ethically questionable, and possibly risky.
