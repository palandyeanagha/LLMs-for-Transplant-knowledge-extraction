Summary
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening
immune response to heparin that is associated with a high risk of
thromboembolic complications.We prospectively treated seven
subjects with acute HIT with fondaparinux and compared the
results to a similar historical control population from the same
hospital. Six of the seven fondaparinux-treated subjects were
transitioned to warfarin, beginning after platelet count recovery
occurred. Ten historical controls were treated with a direct
thrombin inhibitor (DTI), eight of which were transitioned to
warfarin. The primary study outcome was platelet count recovery which was defined as an increase from baseline by at least
30% of nadir to greater than 100,000/mm3 by day seven. Seven
subjects were prospectively treated with fondaparinux for a
median of eight days. Six of the seven had HIT with thrombosis

Introduction
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening
immune response to heparin that occurs in up to 5% of patients
treated with unfractionated heparin (1–3). Venous or arterial
thromboembolic complications will develop in 30–75% of patients with HIT unless they are treated with an alternative anticoagulant (4–7). Current guidelines recommend the use of either
direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) or heparinoids (danaparoid) for
patients with suspected or confirmed HIT (1).The DTI lack crosssensitivity to heparin and have become a standard therapy for patients with HIT in the USA (1, 8–12). These agents include lepirudin (Refludan – Berlex), bivalirudin (Angiomax-The Medicines Company) and argatroban (GlaxoSmithKline) (13–15). Unfortunately, the usefulness of these agents is limited by the need for
continuous intravenous infusions, frequent aPTT monitoring, and
prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR), which
complicates transitioning patients to warfarin (16–17).
Fondaparinux is a selective factor Xa inhibitor that is administered once daily by the subcutaneous route for the prophylaxis
and treatment of patients with arterial or venous thrombosis (18,
19). Unlike danaparoid, in-vitro data with fondaparinux shows a
lack of cross reactivity with HIT antibodies (8–12). Published
data on fondaparinux in HIT is limited to abstracts, case reports,
retrospective case series and a letter describing a small case
series (20–25). The purpose of our open-label, prospective pilot
study was to assess the feasibility of administering fondaparinux
as an alternative anticoagulant to patients with acute HIT. Comparisons were made with historical control patients who were
treated with a DTI.

formed consent document. All prospectively treated subjects
gave informed consent prior to enrollment. The study was conducted in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Subjects
In order to be considered for inclusion into the study, all subjects
were required to be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The diagnosis of HIT
was made when patients experienced an otherwise unexplained
50% or more decrease in platelet count from baseline (pre-heparin) during or within two weeks after heparin exposure and/or
any new thromboembolic complication during or within two
weeks after heparin exposure. In addition, all patients were
required to have a positive heparin PF4 antibody test or serotonin
release assay.
Thromboembolic complications occurring prior to or after
study enrollment of either prospectively treated or historical controls were confirmed as follows: in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis
or pulmonary embolism, diagnosis was confirmed with duplex
ultrasonography, ventilation-perfusion scanning or high-resolution computerized tomography. Subjects were excluded if they
met any of the following criteria: creatinine clearance less than
30 ml/min (estimated by Cockroft Gault equation); pregnant or
lactating; active blood dyscrasia other than HIT, recent or
planned surgery of CNS, eye or other procedure involving large
open surfaces or high bleeding risk; planned lumbar puncture;
active bleeding of GI, GU, respiratory tract or CNS; malignant
hypertension; pericarditis; pericardial effusion; endocarditis;
eclampsia; inadequate support system at home; alcoholism, drug
abuse, psychosis or dementia; hypersensitivity or contraindication to fondaparinux or warfarin.
Study design
Fondaparinux treated subjects
This pilot study prospectively treated patients with a diagnosis of
HIT with fondaparinux and compared their outcomes to a similar population of historical controls from the same hospital.
Prospectively treated subjects were identified and screened following laboratory support of the diagnosis of HIT. Patients who
were already being treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI)
could be enrolled as long as the duration of DTI treatment was
less than one day. If arterial or venous thrombosis was present at
the time of enrollment, subjects were assigned to the following
weight-based fondaparinux regimen given subcutaneously once
daily: 5 mg if body weight less than 50 kg; 7.5 mg if body weight
was between 50–100 kg, or 10 mg if body weight greater than
100 kg. Subjects without thrombosis at the time of enrollment received 2.5 mg subcutaneously once every 24 hours. Subjects
who did not have thrombosis and who weighed less than 50 kg
were excluded from the study.
The study protocol called for fondaparinux to be administered for at least seven days or until the INR was in the therapeutic range (2–3) and stable for at least two consecutive days.
Warfarin use and dosing decisions were left to the discretion of
the attending physician.
Daily measurements and assessments during fondaparinux
treatment included the following: platelet counts; Hg; warfarin
dose; presence of bleeding; transfusions; new thromboembolic
complications; peripheral pulses; observation of skin for color
and presence of ischemic complications including skin necrosis
or venous limb gangrene; amputations; other surgical procedures and deaths. Venouslimb gangrene was defined as acral necrosis that developed despite palpable or Doppler-identifiable
pulses. Patients or caregivers were contacted each week for four
weeks following the discontinuation of fondaparinux in order to
identify any new complications such as bleeding, thrombosis,
amputations or death.
Historical controls (DTI treated subjects)
Historical controls were identified using a list of patients with
positive heparin antibody results from April 2003 until October
2005. Data on the historical controls was obtained through computerized and manual chart review. All historical controls were
required to meet the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the
prospectively treated group. Furthermore, all historical controls
must have been treated with a standardized direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) protocol. The DTI protocol allowed the physician
to select either lepirudin or argatroban, with a dosing and monitoring algorithm consistent with the manufacturer’s FDA-approved labeling. The reason for requiring the standard DTI
protocol was to reduce the potential for errors in dosing and
monitoring and to reduce the variability in how the historical
controls were treated.
Study objectives
The primary objective of the study was to compare platelet count
recovery in fondaparinux treated subjects to a historical control
group who received “standard” therapy with a DTI. Since thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/mm3
) occurs in most, but
not all patients with HIT, and because platelets may begin to recover prior to initiation of treatment, we had two definitions of
platelet count recovery. Platelet count recovery in patients with
thrombocytopenia at baseline (one day prior to treatment) was
defined as an increase in the platelet count from baseline by at
least 30% of nadir to greater than 100,000/mm3 by day seven. In
patients without thrombocytopenia at baseline (one day prior to
treatment), platelet count recovery was defined as a platelet
count greater than 100,000/mm3 on days three and seven of treatment.
There were two secondary objectives of the study: 1) comparison of complication rates between fondaparinux treated subjects and historical controls and 2) successful bridging in those
treated with fondaparinux versus historical controls. Complications were defined as death, limb amputation, new thromboembolic complications, venouslimb gangrene or major bleeding. Patientsreceiving fondaparinux were monitored for possible
complications by phone for four weeks after discontinuation.
Major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding associated with a
hemoglobin decrease of 2g/dl or fatal, life-threatening, intracranial, or any overt bleeding requiring transfusion of at least 2
units of blood while receiving HIT treatment.
Successful bridging in subjects treated with warfarin was defined as an INR of 2–3 for two consecutive days while not receiving a DTI. This definition was necessary for DTI treated subjects
because these agents may prolong the INR, resulting in the need

to discontinue the DTI and recheck the INR while on warfarin
monotherapy.
Discrete variables, including baseline data, platelet count recovery, complications and successful bridging were compared
using the Fisher’s Exact test (GraphPad Software, Inc). The level
of significance was defined as 0.05 (two tailed).
Results
Subjects
Of the 20 subjects screened for prospective treatment with fondaparinux, seven met eligibility requirements and were enrolled.
The most common reason for excluding potential study subjects
was having an estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min
(N=11). Other reasons for exclusion were active bleeding (N=1)
and expected life expectancy of less than one month (N=1). Four
subjects developed HIT while receiving heparin or enoxaparin
postoperatively, while three were exposed to heparin during hospitalization for acute medical illness. Six of the seven had acute
thrombosis at the time of HIT diagnosis and received full treatment doses of fondaparinux; one subject was without thrombosis
and therefore received 2.5 mg once daily.
There were three fondaparinux treated subjects who were
treated initially with a DTI (two argatroban, one lepirudin) for
less than 24 hours prior to being enrolled in the study. Only one
of the fondaparinux treated subjects was receiving another drug
that is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia. This subject (#3) had undergone cardiac catheterization with abciximab.
None of the remaining subjects had other drugs (besides heparin)
that required discontinuation when thrombocytopenia was recognized. Furthermore, six of seven fondaparinux treated subjects had a “high” pretest probability of HIT using the 4 T’s scoring system (26). The heparin –PF4 ELISA optical densities of
each subject are displayed in Table 2.
Of 51 subjects with HIT who were screened to serve as historical controls, 31 were excluded because they had not been
treated with the standardized DTI protocol. Other reasons for exclusion from the historical control group included having an estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min (N=8) and total
body weight less than 50 kg (N=2). Seven subjects developed
HIT postoperatively, while three were exposed during their hospitalization for acute medical illnesses. Six of the historical controls were treated with lepirudin and four with argatroban.
Baseline characteristics of the study subjects are shown in
Table 1. Six of seven prospectively treated subjects and eight of
ten historical controls had experienced a thromboembolic complication of HIT prior to beginning treatment with fondaparinux
or the DTI protocol. Fondaparinux treated subjects had average
baseline (pre-treatment) platelet counts that were significantly
lower compared to the average baseline platelet count in the historical controls (73 versus 155; two-tailed P value equals 0.0131;
CI: –145.35 to –20.03).
Efficacy
All fondaparinux treated subjects experienced platelet count recovery as defined in the protocol (Table 3). The average percentage increase in platelet count from nadir to day7was 525%
(range: 53–1900%).
Platelet count recovery occurred in most (8/10) historically
treated subjects (Table 4). The average percentage increase of
245% (range: 5–600%), was not significantly different from the
fondaparinux treated subjects (two-tailed P value equals
0.2466).Two historical controls died (Subjects #4 and #7) during
the data collection period, and data on platelet count recovery are
therefore incomplete on these subjects.

Complication rates
Fondaparinux treated subjects
No new thromboembolic complications, major bleeding events
or deaths had occurred in any of the fondaparinux treated subjects during the study period or upon follow-up at four weeks.
However, subject #6, who presented with acute popliteal artery
thrombosis approximately one week following knee replacement, was enrolled after unsuccessful thrombectomy and later
underwent lower limb amputation after seven days of fondaparinux.
Bleeding complications were minor, and no patient met criteria for major bleeding. There were three fondaparinux treated
subjects 43% (3/7) who experienced a2g/dl or greater decrease
in Hg that was not associated with bleeding while on treatment.
Four fondaparinux treated subjects 57% (4/7) were transfused.
Since none of the transfused patients had clinically overt bleeding, their bleeding was classified as minor. Minor bleeding not
requiring transfusion was observed in 43% (3/7) of fondaparinux
treated subjects.
Historical controls
No new thromboembolic complications or major bleeding
events were noted in the historical controls while they were being
treated with a DTI, although venous limb gangrene was seen in
four of the ten subjects. Subject #2 developed gangrenous necrosis of a single digit of the same limb affected by DVT prior to
treatment with DTI and while he was receiving warfarin. Subject
#4 developed gangrenous necrosis of the left hand which
required amputation. As with subject #2, this occurred prior to
DTI treatment and while the patient was receiving warfarin. He
also had gangrenous necrosis of both lower extremities and died
on the same day that a DTI was initiated. Patient #6, who had a
right lower extremity DVT, experienced an area of focal necrosis
of the right lower extremity that was consistent with gangrenous
necrosis. This subject did not require surgery or amputation.
Subject #10, who had severe peripheral arterial disease and bilateral femoral-popliteal artery bypass grafts, developed gangrenous necrosis of the left lower extremity requiring amputation 12
days after initiating a DTI. This subject had been treated with a
DTI and warfarin for eight days prior to the left above the knee
amputation. Of note, the DTI had been stopped and started several times while warfarin was being titrated into the therapeutic
range.
Rates of bleeding complications in the historical controls
were similar to the fondaparinux group. One-half (5/10) experienced a2g/dl or greater decrease in Hg while on DTI treatment;
tranfusions were performed in 40% (4/10). Clinically overt but
minor bleeding not requiring transfusion was noted in one subject (10%). No patient met the criteria for major bleeding.

Successful bridging to warfarin
Of the six fondaparinux treated subjects who were transitioned to
warfarin due to thromboembolic complications, 33% (2/6) were
successfully bridged, i.e. stable in the therapeutic range
(INR=2–3) for two consecutive days prior to discontinuation of
fondaparinux. The other four subjects did not meet our strict
criteria for successful bridging for different reasons. One of the
subjects had to prematurely discontinue warfarin in order to have
her lower limb amputation. She was not continued on the study
after the amputation (although she continued to receive fondaparinux post-op off-protocol). One subject overshot the therapeutic range (INR went from 3.0 to 4.1) and the fondaparinux
was simply discontinued because it was felt that the patient was
adequately anticoagulated. In two of the subjects, fondaparinux
was discontinued on the day that the therapeutic range was reached. They did not meet our definition of successful bridging although they were deemed to be stable and in the therapeutic
range one day after fondaparinux discontinuation.Although warfarin was initiated in 8/10 of the historical controls, none were
successfully bridged during the study period despite long
courses of warfarin overlapping with DTI therapy. Significantly
more aPTTs were measured in the DTI treated subjects (Table 5).
Discussion
We report the first prospective, clinical trial of fondaparinux in
patients with suspected acute HIT. All of our subjects met our
pre-specified criteria for acute HIT when they began treatment
with fondaparinux and all experienced a complete platelet count
recovery with clinical outcomes that were at least as good as a
historical control population treated with a DTI. None of the historical controls or fondaparinux treated subjects developed a
new thromboembolic event during treatment or within one
month following treatment. However, progression of existing
thrombosis leading to amputation may have occurred in one fondaparinux treated subject and one of the historical controls.
The basis for studying fondaparinux in patients with HIT
rests upon the well established lack of cross-sensitivity between
heparin and fondaparinux in the sera of patients with HIT (8–12).
Several case reports have described the use of fondaparinux in
patients with acute HIT (20–22).A prospective case series of six
patients with a history of HIT who received fondaparinux for
thromboprophylaxis showed no adverse events during treatment
(23). Kuo et al. administered 7.5 mg fondaparinux daily to five
patients with HIT (24). Platelet counts recovered in all patients
between days two and nine and no new thromboses reportedly
developed. Bradner and colleagues conducted a retrospective review of 20 patients who had a diagnosis of HIT and who received fondaparinux (25). Most patients had received fondaparinux
within two weeks of the diagnosis of HIT. No new thromboses
occurred during or after fondaparinux use. Furthermore,
D’Angelo reported that the anti-PF4-heparin antibody became
negative in a patient with HIT treated with fondaparinux over 29
days (27).
Despite the case reports and lack of cross-reactivity in vitro
between heparin and fondaparinux in the sera of patients with
HIT, there are reasons for caution regarding the use of this drug
in patients with HIT. It has been demonstrated that fondaparinux
is as likely as enoxaparin to generate anti-PF4 heparin antibodies
in humans receiving the drug for thromboprophylaxis after orthopedic surgery (12). This suggests that fondaparinux is just as
likely to sensitize patients, and therefore place them at risk for
HIT if they are subsequently exposed to heparin or LMWH.
However, since the antibodies generated in fondaparinux treated
subjects reacted in vitro to PF4/heparin and PF4/enoxaparin
rather than PF4/fondaparinux, it has been postulated that it is unlikely that fondaparinux itself causes HIT. Moreover, the small
size and numbers of fondaparinux induced PF4/fondaparinux
antibody complexes are believed to be insufficient to cross link
platelet Fc receptors in vitro thus unlikely to induce platelet activation (28). Since fondaparinux was marketed globally in 2001,
only one published case of fondaparinux associated HIT has
been reported (29). This suggests that if HIT does occur with
fondaparinux, it is extremely rare.
In contrast to previous reports, we prospectively treated patients with suspected acute HIT, most of whom had thromboembolic complications, and compared our results to a population of
similar patients who were treated with a DTI. The baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups were similar in terms
of platelet count nadir following heparin exposure and baseline
thromboembolic complications resulting from HIT. However,
fondaparinux-treated subjects began treatment earlier than controls, and more often in the absence of preceding warfarin monotherapy during the acute phase of HIT. In fact, some historical
controls had already experienced platelet count recovery when
the DTI was initiated, whereas the prospectively treated subjects
were still thrombocytopenic upon treatment initiation. It is possible that the apparent delay in recognition and treatment of HIT
in the historical controls accounts for the two deaths seen in this
group.
It should be mentioned that one of the fondaparinux treated
subjects may have had abciximab-induced, rather than heparininduced thrombocytopenia. It is in fact possible that some of our
patients did not have acute HIT, since we did not perform serotonin-release assays to confirm the presence of heparin-dependent
platelet-activating antibodies. Furthermore, the heparin-PF4

ELISA optical densities were higher in the historical controls.
Published data suggest that HIT patients without thrombosis and
OD scores > 1.0 are at a nearly 6-fold increased risk of subsequent thrombosis than those < 1.0 (30). However, it is important to point out that six of our seven prospectively treated subjects did actually develop thrombosis during or after heparin exposure, making their relatively lower OD scoresless pertinent. It
is known that HIT with thrombosis occurs across a spectrum of
OD scores, and that the value of OD scores is largely related to
predicting the likelihood of future thrombosis. Unfortunately, we
did not “confirm” the presence of heparin-dependent plateletactivating antibodies by serotonin-release assay, a test that could
have added further weight to the diagnosis of acute HIT.
An intriguing finding in our study was that venous limb gangrene in the limb affected by a DVT occurred in three of the historical controls, but in none of the fondaparinux treated subjects.
A fourth case of limb gangrene also occurred in a historical control with arterial and venous thrombosis as well as a fondaparinux-treated subject who had arterial thrombosis. It has been reported that the DTI-warfarin overlap is a high risk period for warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene (31, 32). This is believed
to be related to the failure of warfarin to control thrombin generation early in therapy, when there are decreased levels of the
natural anticoagulants protein C and S (33). Thus, patients with
HIT must be very carefully transitioned to warfarin after thrombocytopenia has resolved and while maintaining adequate anticoagulation with a DTI (34). Moreover, during DTI-warfarin
overlap, the DTI should not be stopped until a minimum five-day
overlap period has taken place, the INR is stably in the therapeutic range for at least the last two days of overlap, and the platelet count has recovered to a stable plateau. It is certainly conceivable that because of the long half-life of fondaparinux, more
consistent anticoagulation is maintained during this transition
than with DTIs. Also, since DTIs commonly prolong the INR,
clinicians sometimes prematurely interrupt DTI therapy leading
to unopposed warfarin. The possibility that fondaparinux might
have an advantage of reduced risk for venous limb gangrene is a
hypothesis that should be tested.
One subject (#6) in the fondaparinux group did undergo
lower limb amputation after unsuccessful thrombectomy of an
acute popliteal artery thrombosis. This subject underwent total
knee replacement and received enoxaparin for two weeks, then
experienced acute, severe popliteal artery thrombosis requiring
thrombectomy. At this time it was noted that her platelet count
had declined from 222,000 to 67,000/mm3
, leading to suspicion
of HIT and initiation of argatroban for approximately 12 hours.
Upon confirmation of heparin antibody positivity, (OD > 3), she
was enrolled in the study. She had no manually detectable arterial pulses in her right foot prior to enrollment and until the day of
amputation. Her platelet counts increased from 80,000/mm3
(baseline) to 168,000/mm3 after three days of fondaparinux.
Despite an appropriate platelet count response, she was taken
back to surgery due to persistently absent pulses in the affected
limb.The surgeon noted “extensive white clot in the distal popliteal artery,” some of which was removed. After eight days the
limb was deemed to be unsalvageable (insensate, paralyzed,
bluish with multiple bullae) and was amputated. Of note, she had
received a 2.5 mg dose of warfarin the day after beginning fondaparinux when her platelet count was not completely recovered
(118,000/mm3 K). Early introduction of warfarin in this subject
theoretically could have exacerbated the pre-existing ischemic
damage leading to the development of gangrenous necrosis and
the need for amputation. However, the patient’s INR did not increase after this low warfarin dose, and we do not believe that the
warfarin contributed to her gangrene.
Because DTIs often cause prolongation of the INR, overlapping with warfarin therapy is more complicated than when overlapping heparin and warfarin. Although warfarin was initiated in
80% of the historical controls and therapy was overlapped for a
median duration of eight days, none of the controls had a stable,
therapeutic INR when the DTI was discontinued. Fondaparinux
was overlapped with warfarin for a median duration of five days,
and 33% had a stable, therapeutic INR at the time fondaparinux
was discontinued. This suggests that fondaparinux may simplify
the process of bridging to warfarin.
There are several reasons why fondaparinux may be an attractive alternative to DTI. These include subcutaneous dosing
without the need for aPTT or INR monitoring, simplified transition to warfarin, and significantly lower acquisition cost when
compared to DTIs. The current average wholesale price (AWP)
for lepirudin and argatroban ranges from $1,093.76 to $1,212.96
per day (35). In contrast, the AWP for fondaparinux is $43.50 to
$107.55 per day, depending on the dose.
Danaparoid is an effective alternative to DTIs and shares a
number of properties with fondaparinux. However, danaparoid is
less selective for factor Xa and is associated with a significant degree of cross-reactivity.While it is no longer available in the U.S.,
it is licensed for marketing in Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and much of Europe. A recent review of clinical outcomes in
1,478 patients treated with danaparoid suggests that outcomes are
comparable to those seen with DTIs, particularly when standard
treatment doses are used in those with isolated HIT (36). Our
study protocol employed a prophylactic dose of fondaparinux in
subjects without thrombosis.The subject(subject #3) who received a prophylactic dose was not transitioned to warfarin because
she was receiving aspirin and clopidogrel following coronary
stent placement.While she did not experience a recurrence of her
coronary artery thrombosis, we did not adequately test the hypothesis thataprophylactic dose of fondaparinux may be useful
in the prevention of thrombosis in patients with HIT. In view of
the experience with danaparoid, we would suggest that full treatment doses be employed even for patients without thrombosis.
Our study is clearly limited by the small number of patients
treated and the possibility that some of these patients did not
have HIT. However, it should add a measure of confidence that
fondaparinux may be safely administered to patients with a history of HIT. More research is needed in order to define the role of
fondaparinux in patients with acute HIT. Fortunately, there are
several emerging antithrombotics, including oral factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors, some of which are likely
to play an important role in the management of patients with HIT
(37).
