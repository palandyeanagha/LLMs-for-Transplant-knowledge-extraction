Hepatic stellate cells secrete Ccl5 to 
induce hepatocyte steatosis

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a wide spectrum of disease severity, starting 
from pure steatosis, leading to fatty infammation labeled as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
and fnally fbrosis leading to cirrhosis. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are known to contribute 
to fbrosis, but less is known about their function during NAFLD’s early stages prior to fbrosis. We 
developed an ex vivo assay that cocultures primary HSCs from mouse models of liver disease with 
healthy hepatocytes to study their interaction. Our data indicate that chemokine Ccl5 is one of the 
HSC-secreted mediators in early NASH in humans and in mice fed with choline-defcient, L-amino acid 
defned, high fat diet. Furthermore, Ccl5 directly induces steatosis and pro-infammatory factors in 
healthy hepatocytes through the receptor Ccr5. Although Ccl5 is already known to be secreted by many 
liver cell types including HSCs and its pro-fbrotic role well characterized, its pro-steatotic action has not 
been recognized until now. Similarly, the function of HSCs in fbrogenesis is widely accepted, but their 
pro-steatotic role has been unclear. Our result suggests that in early NASH, HSCs secrete Ccl5 which 
contributes to a broad array of mechanisms by which hepatic steatosis and infammation are achieved.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are considered to play a central role in hepatic fbrogenesis1–4
. Since fbrosis is the 
common pathway that ultimately leads to cirrhotic organ failure or hepatocellular carcinoma that occurs in progressive liver diseases, understanding the biology of HSCs is pivotal for all liver diseases that can lead to hepatic 
fbrosis. Tis paradigm is particularly important in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which has become 
the most signifcant hepatic illness in the world. Just in the United States NAFLD afects over 64 million people 
by a recent estimate5
, and it will soon become the most common cause of liver transplant and hepatocellular 
carcinoma6,7
. Although several drugs are undergoing clinical trials there are still no well-established pharmacologic agents to treat NAFLD, and the main mode of management is through reducing risk factors such as obesity, 
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes8
. Hence, elucidating the HSC pathobiology in NAFLD is crucial to identify novel 
treatment options.
Although fbrosis that leads to end-stage organ failure or cancer is an important feature of NAFLD, the disease 
does not start with fbrosis. Instead, NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of disease severity, starting from pure 
steatosis, leading to fatty infammation labeled as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fnally fbrosis leading to cirrhosis9,10. HSCs are known to contribute to fbrosis, but much less is known about their function during 
NAFLD’s earlier stages, in steatosis and infammation without fbrosis. One of the difculties in studying HSCs in 
the context of other cell types during the early stages of NAFLD is that they are relatively hard to identify in vivo
to study their role and that insightful in vitro assays that model HSC’s interaction with other cell types are difcult 
to develop. In response, we have devised an ex vivo assay that cocultures healthy hepatocytes with primary HSCs 
from mouse models of steatohepatitis to study their interaction. Te assay greatly enhances our ability to defne 
HSC function and the mechanism of its action during fatty infammation of the liver by identifying HSC-secreted 
mediators that have profound efects on nearby hepatocytes.
In healthy humans and mice, HSCs are quiescent, residing near sinusoids in the space of Disse. However, once 
the liver is aficted with a chronic illness such as NAFLD/NASH, quiescent HSCs become transdiferentiated 
to give rise to myofbroblasts11. Tese activated HSCs, termed myofbroblasts, are known to express cytokines, 
chemokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and other genes that contribute to hepatic fbrogenesis12. Our data 
indicate that chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (Ccl5, a.k.a. Rantes) is one of the HSC-secreted mediators in NASH

that directly induce steatosis and pro-infammatory factors in initially healthy hepatocytes. Another group 
already demonstrated that human HSCs express CCL5 when challenged with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, or CD40L in 
vitro13, but our work suggests for the frst time that HSCs express Ccl5 in early NASH to directly induce steatosis 
and upregulation of pro-infammatory factors in hepatocytes. Although Ccl5 is also expressed by other liver 
cell types14–17 and is better known for causing hepatic fbrosis through the recruitment of immune cells14,15, its 
pro-steatotic action in early NAFLD/NASH has not been recognized until now. Similarly, the essential function of 
HSCs in hepatic fbrogenesis is well accepted, but their pro-steatotic role, however minor, in directly infuencing 
hepatocytes in early NAFLD/NASH has not been clear. Using a mouse model of steatohepatitis, our result suggests that HSCs have a function in inducing steatosis and infammation, not just fbrosis.
Results
Mice fed a choline-defcient, L-amino acid-defned, high fat diet for three weeks develop steatohepatitis. NAFLD starts as simple fatty liver that can progress to steatohepatitis, fbrosis, and ultimately 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma18. Although HSCs are known to have a critical function in the development of hepatic fbrosis by secreting extracellular matrix proteins and expressing other pro-fbrotic genes1–3
, 
less is known about their action during the initial, fatty liver and the early infammatory phases of NASH. To 
study their function during this early stage of the disease, we isolated HSCs from a mouse model of steatohepatitis relying on choline-defcient, L-amino acid-defned, high fat diet (CDAHFD). Tese mice normally develop 
severe steatosis with moderate infammation but no fbrosis within 3 weeks, mild fbrosis within 6 weeks, moderate fbrosis in 9 weeks, and moderate to severe fbrosis in 12 weeks19. Tus, mice fed with CDAHFD for three 
weeks have fatty and infamed liver that resembles the histology of early NASH prior to fbrosis. Grossly, at three 
weeks, their skin became oily, evidenced by the greasy coat that sticks together in clumps (Fig. 1A). Internally, 
their livers were lighter in color, demonstrating hepatic fat (Fig. 1B). Microscopically, they showed several large 
and small lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, confrming moderate to severe steatosis with moderate 
infammation but no fbrosis (Fig. 1C). To study the role of HSCs at this stage of liver disease, we isolated them by 
optimizing and improving on an established protocol20. Each 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mouse fed with either 
normal diet or CDAHFD for three weeks yielded 0.5–1 million HSCs. Tis population of cells was 98.9% pure for 
positive fuorescence with ultraviolet light (Fig. 1D), a signal specifc for retinoid flled lipid droplets present in 
quiescent HSCs. Furthermore, absence of cells expressing albumin or F4/80 in this population confrmed almost 
no contamination of hepatocytes or macrophages, respectively (Fig. 1E).

Primary HSCs isolated from mice with non-fbrotic steatohepatitis more quickly become activated in culture. Quiescent HSCs are known to become activated spontaneously to myofbroblasts if they 
are cultured on plastic dish for 7–10 days21,22. Tis phenomenon is likely driven by the high degree of stifness 
inherent to plastic which acts as the activating signal to HSCs, and this same mechanism of action may also take 
place in the stifening hepatic tissue as fbrosis progresses which itself becomes one of many activating signals 
in vivo23. HSCs harvested from liver with steatohepatitis without fbrosis induced by three weeks of CDAHFD 
morphologically resembled quiescent HSCs from healthy mice, retaining UV-fuorescing lipid droplets, but they 
were slightly larger in size (Figs 1D and 2A). More signifcantly, they were functionally distinct. Teir morphologic transdiferentiation to activated HSCs occurred more quickly in culture, requiring only 3–6 days, instead of 
7–10 days. As opposed to the usual seven days, by the third day in culture, HSCs isolated from CDAHFD induced 
non-fbrotic steatohepatitis increased in size with the spread morphology (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, by day 3.5 in 
culture, these HSCs had heightened expression of activation markers alpha smooth muscle actin (Acta2) and 
alpha-1 type I collagen (Col1a1) covering the expanded cytosol (Fig. 2B). Tis elevated expression of activation 
markers was maintained even afer HSCs became fully activated on plastic dish (Fig. 2C). Finally, we analyzed 
the expression of several cytokines and chemokines involved in infammation and recruitment of immune cells, 
and HSCs from steatohepatitic liver showed signifcantly higher expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf), 
cluster of diferentiation 14 (Cd14), interleukin 6 (Il-6), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (Ccl5) and 8 (Ccl8) 
by day 3.5 in culture compared to HSCs from healthy mice (Fig. 2D). Tese results indicate that although HSCs 
isolated from the liver with CDAHFD induced steatohepatitis resembling early NASH have a quiescent morphology with retinoid positive lipid droplets, they are intrinsically diferent from quiescent HSCs and primed to 
become fully activated.
Primary HSCs isolated from non-fbrotic steatohepatitic liver induce steatosis and infammation in healthy hepatocytes. Since HSCs from steatohepatitic liver are more susceptible to become activated, phenotypically distinct from quiescent HSCs, we tested their ability to infuence nearby hepatocytes. When 
we cocultured primed HSCs from three weeks of CDAHFD with hepatocytes isolated from mice eating standard 
diet, initially healthy hepatocytes became steatotic with numerous lipid droplets within three days (Fig. 3A,B). 
Tis result was obtained while HSC-hepatocyte coculture was performed using a Transwell that physically separates the two cell types while secreted proteins and small molecules can freely traverse this barrier, suggesting 
that HSCs are inducing hepatocyte steatosis not through cell-cell contact but by secreting mediators. We verifed this phenomenon when steatosis was induced in healthy hepatocytes by applying the conditioned media of 
primed HSCs harvested from mice challenged with three weeks of CDAHFD (Fig. 3C,D). Finally, we evaluated 
the expression levels of various pro-infammatory cytokines and chemokines in steatotic hepatocytes cocultured 
with primed HSCs. Te result shows that these hepatocytes were not only steatotic but also expressed many 
pro-infammatory genes that further activate HSCs and attract immune cells (Fig. 3E).
Hepatocyte steatosis is induced by Ccl5 secreted from HSCs. Since hepatocyte steatosis did not require 
cell-cell contact with HSCs originating from steatohepatitic liver, steatosis inducing signals are likely transmitted 
through secreted mediators in a paracrine manner. To identify the secreted factors responsible for inducing steatosis 
in nearby hepatocytes, we performed a cytokine array blot of the conditioned media from HSCs in culture. One of 
the highly up-secreted proteins was Ccl5 (Supp. Fig. 1), which was already demonstrated to be upregulated at the 
transcriptional level (Fig. 2D), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confrmed the up-secretion of 
Ccl5 from these HSCs (Supp. Fig. 4). Finally, the upregulation of Ccl5 in HSCs from CDAHFD induced steatohepatitis in mice and early NASH in humans was further verifed by immunofuorescence which showed co-localization 
of Ccl5 with Acta2, an activated HSC marker in the liver (Fig. 4A,B). Moreover, these HSCs continued to express 
Ccl5 at a greater level than initially normal HSCs, even afer further activation on dish (Fig. 4C). Although Ccl5 is 
a relatively well-investigated chemokine, known to promote hepatic fbrosis, its possible pro-steatotic efect has not 
been investigated14,15. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether Ccl5 directly causes steatosis in hepatocytes 
or is simply an upregulated gene with an unrelated function. First, we applied recombinant Ccl5 protein at various concentrations to nontransformed mouse hepatocyte cell line AML12 in culture. Indeed, purifed Ccl5 protein 
induced steatosis in AML12 cells starting at 1ng/ml, but more robustly with 50ng/ml and 100ng/ml (Supp. Fig. 2). 
Ccl5 also caused steatosis in primary mouse hepatocytes at these concentrations, seen with Bodipy stain (Fig. 4D). 
Furthermore, these hepatocytes that became steatotic with recombinant Ccl5 upregulated pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines of their own (Fig. 4E), demonstrating Ccl5’s pro-steatotic and pro-infammatory efects. 
Interestingly, applying recombinant Ccl5 to hepatocytes caused those hepatocytes to upregulate Ccl5 themselves 
in a feed-forward manner. To further understand this HSC-hepatocyte interaction involving Ccl5, we cloned 
the full length Ccl5 gene and overexpressed it in HSCs (Supp. Fig. 3). We collected the conditioned media from 
these Ccl5 expressing HSCs, and applied it on healthy hepatocytes. As expected, these hepatocytes also formed 
lipid droplets, detected by Bodipy stain (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, these same hepatocytes increased expression of 
various pro-infammatory cytokines and chemokines but in greater folds than when recombinant Ccl5 was directly 
applied (Fig. 4G). To investigate the reason for this greater induction of pro-infammatory cytokines and chemokines in hepatocytes by Ccl5 overexpressing HSCs, we checked the expression levels of other cytokines and chemokines besides Ccl5 in these cells. It turns out, the HSCs overexpressing Ccl5 also had increased expression of other 
pro-infammatory mediators besides Ccl5, suggesting that Ccl5 induces either an autocrine signaling or purely an 
intracellular signaling cascade that leads to upregulation of genes such as Tnf and Il-6 (Fig. 4H). Pro-infammatory 
cytokines such as Tnf, Il-6, and unidentifed factors upregulated by Ccl5 in HSCs are likely being secreted and 
further inducing certain pro-infammatory gene expression in nearby hepatocytes. Lastly, the pro-steatotic efect 
of Ccl5 secreted by HSCs was further evidenced when a Ccl5 neutralizing antibody applied to CDAHFD-HSC 
conditioned media attenuated its induction of hepatocyte steatosis (Fig. 4I, Supp. Fig. 5). We also confrmed that

the source of Ccl5 is HSCs, not hepatocytes, in these assays by demonstrating the lack of Ccl5 immunofuorescence 
signal from hepatocyte culture (Supp. Fig. 6).
Blocking the action of Ccl5 using an inhibitor of Ccr5 decreases hepatocyte steatosis in vitro. Ccl5 is known to interact with the membrane C-C chemokine receptors including type 1 (Ccr1), type 3 (Ccr3), 
and type 5 (Ccr5)14,15,24. To determine expression levels of Ccr1, Ccr3, and Ccr5, we performed quantitative PCR 
(qPCR)of these three genes in primary mouse hepatocytes. Te result showed that hepatocytes express Ccr5
signifcantly more than Ccr1 or Ccr3 (Fig. 5A). To test whether Ccl5 expressed by HSCs signal through Ccr5 on 
hepatocytes to induce steatosis and to upregulate pro-infammatory cytokines, we applied both recombinant Ccl5 
and the Ccr5-specifc inhibitor Maraviroc on hepatocytes. As suspected, pro-steatotic efect of Ccl5 was attenuated with Maraviroc (Fig. 5B,C).

Discussion
Our study accomplishes two goals that should further facilitate the study of HSC biology in the setting of NASH. 
First, knowing that studying HSC’s interaction with nearby hepatocytes in their microenvironment during liver 
diseases would be facilitated by having a reliable ex vivo system that uses primary cells, we developed our coculture system using a mouse model of steatohepatitis histologically resembling early NASH. Using primary HSCs 
was important because malignant or immortalized cell lines ofen do not refect the molecular physiology and the 
measurable behavior of primary cells25. Also, the mouse as a species provides a vast array of genetic, diet, chemical, and anatomic models of liver diseases. Although there is no perfect animal model that completely recapitulates human NASH, we chose to utilize the CDAHFD model because it establishes severe steatosis with moderate 
infammation in three weeks which eventually leads to fbrosis in subsequent weeks, the stepwise progression 
seen in humans19. Our coculture system allowed us to better defne the function and its mechanism of HSCs in 
afecting nearby hepatocytes during steatohepatitis development. Several points should be noted here. Although 
we studied the function of diseased HSC’s infuence on healthy hepatocyte, the system also can be applied to 
investigate diseased hepatocyte’s action on healthy HSC. In fact, other important cell types such as macrophages 
and sinusoidal endothelial cells could potentially be used as long as a highly pure population can be isolated and 
cultured. Moreover, although we have not tried, it is possible to coculture three or more cell types together to 
study the interactions among them. Te cell type directly harvested from a diseased liver should more accurately 
refect its diseased phenotype, which is the strength of our ex vivo system. However, it must be emphasized that 
terminally diferentiated primary cells ofen cannot be maintained in culture for a prolonged period without 
changes in their phenotype. Tis is the reason why our coculture assays in this study did not extend beyond three 
days in culture. We believe that any terminally diferentiated primary cells cultured ex vivo for more than 5–7 days 
lose their original phenotype. Furthermore, the insight we gain from studying primary cells in a diseased context 
is only as good as the animal model. Nevertheless, our coculture system is a useful tool to better defne the role of 
hepatic cell types and their interactions in the setting of various liver diseases.
Second, using the coculture assay we developed, we wanted to better understand the function of HSCs in a 
mouse model of non-fbrotic steatohepatitis that may simulate early NASH prior to the onset of fbrosis. Our 
data demonstrate that HSCs directly induce steatosis in healthy hepatocytes by secreting mediators that act in a 
paracrine fashion. One of those mediators that have a direct steatotic efect on hepatocytes is Ccl5 which seems to 
exert its efect through Ccr5. Tis unexpected result suggests that HSCs have pathophysiologic functions beyond 
laying down excessive amount of extracellular matrix to cause fbrosis during the mid to late stages of NASH. We 
should caution, however, that this new fnding does not necessarily indicate that the pro-steatotic role of HSCs 
or Ccl5 during the early stage NASH is the major mechanism by which liver becomes steatotic. For example, it is 
known that Ccl5 is secreted by other cell types such as macrophages, platelets, endothelial, T cells, and hepatocytes14–17. Hence, hepatocytes likely become steatotic through multiple molecular signals and cell types, and the 
proportion of the phenotype contributed by HSCs through Ccl5 may be minor. Interestingly, supporting the mild 
pro-steatotic function of Ccl5, Ccl5 knockout mice demonstrate a trend toward lower hepatic triglyceride levels 
compare to their wildtype littermates15. Finally, although hepatocytes are generally considered the main driver 
of infammation that signals to other cell types including HSCs, our result suggests that a signifcant amount of 
pro-infammatory signals may reciprocate back to hepatocytes from HSCs to create a vicious circle of reinforcing 
infammatory signals12. Although not directly tested in this study, such feed-forward escalation in hepatic infammation likely involves other cell types as well.
In summary, our coculture assay using primary cells from the liver is a versatile method by which the interaction 
between isolatable cell types from any mouse model of liver disease can be researched. Te system attempts to faithfully recreate the microenvironment of cells within the liver by culturing freshly harvested primary cells for a short 
duration, lasting no more than 5–7 days. We applied the method to coculture diseased HSCs from steatohepatitic 
liver with healthy hepatocytes for three days, and discovered that HSCs can directly induce hepatocytes to become 
steatotic by secreting the chemokine Ccl5. Although this result does not preclude the possibility of other secreted 
factors or cell types causing similar phenotype, the data reveals a novel function of Ccl5 and HSCs. Our coculture 
system has the potential to uncover other therapeutically relevant functions of HSCs and other liver cell types, which 
is urgently needed given the rising incidence of NASH and the lack of FDA-approved therapies.
Methods
Animals. All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for 
the Care of Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee and the 
Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. Eight week old C57BL/6 female mice 
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Te animals were maintained under a 12-hour 
light-dark cycle with free access to standard laboratory chow diet or a choline-defcient, L-amino acid-defned, highfat diet (CDAHFD) consisting of 60% kcal fat and 0.1% methionine by weight in order to induce steatohepatitis19.
Hepatic stellate cells and hepatocyte isolation. Hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice fed 
the control diet and hepatic stellate cells isolated from mice fed the control diet or the CDAHFD by enzymatic 
digestion and Percoll density gradient centrifugation with modifcations. Te portal vein was perfused in situ with 
30mL of HBSS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and 30mL of 0.05% collagenase B (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, 
USA), respectively, at 37 °C with a fow rate of 6ml/min. Afer perfusion, the partially digested liver was excised 
and incubated with 20 mL of 0.05% collagenase and DNase I 10 μg/mL, (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 
at 37 °C for 30minutes. Te tissue was passed through a 70 µm nylon mesh to remove undigested materials and 
suspended in washing bufer (PBS containing DNase I). Hepatocytes were separated from the non-parenchymal 
cells and debris by centrifugation at 4 °C in the following sequence: twice for 5minutes at 50 g, and twice again for 
5minutes at 20 g. Te supernatant was collected for stellate cell isolation and the hepatocytes present in the pellet

were re-suspended in DMEM. Primary mouse HSCs were purifed from the remainder of non-parenchymal 
cells. Cells were centrifuged at 635 g for 10minutes and resuspended in washing bufer followed by pass through 
a 70 µm nylon mesh. Te pellets were resuspended in 10ml of 35% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) 
with an overlay of 1ml PBS. Afer centrifugation at 1130 g for 30minutes, HSCs are in the layer located between 
the PBS and 35% Percoll. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber) and 0.4% trypan blue 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Te purity was determined by UV sorting with BD FACS Aria II SORP Cell 
Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Cell culture. Isolated hepatocytes were re-suspended in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, plated onto 
collagen-coated six-well plates at a density of 5×105
 cells/well in 1.5ml culture medium, and cultured for 4hours. 
Te medium was then changed into serum-free medium and the cells were cocultured with hepatic stellate cells 
and loaded onto cell-culture inserts of 3 µm pore size (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). For recombinant Rantes 
treatment, various concentration of mouse recombinant Rantes (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were 
added to cells for 3 days. To test inhibition of Rantes, cells were preincubated with recombinant Ccl5 for 12hours 
before addition of Maraviroc (MVC, TOCRIS, Bristol, UK).
Human tissues. Eleven patients who underwent liver biopsies at the Massachusetts General Hospital and 
were diagnosed with NASH were identifed from the pathology database. Te archived tissues embedded in parafn blocks were processed for immunofuorescence analysis. Tis study was approved by the Partners Human 
Research Committee.
BODIPY staining of lipid droplets. Hepatocytes co-cultured with stellate cells or conditioned media were 
washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15minutes, and stained with BODIPY (1 µg/ml, Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 15min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and stained with DAPI.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and 
reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Superscript IV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). SYBR-Green real-time RT-PCR 
was performed with listed primers (Supp. Table 1) and GAPDH mRNA was used to normalize RNA inputs.
Immunofuorescence. Cells were fxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10minutes at room temperature and 
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-bufered saline (PBS) for 20minutes. Nonspecifc immunostaining was prevented by 30minutes’ incubation of the cells in PBS solution containing 20% normal goat serum 
(DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) at room temperature. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 
primary antibodies as follows: Ccl5 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), albumin (Bethyl Lab, Montgomery, 
TX, USA; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and alpha smooth muscle actin (BioGenex, Fremont, CA, USA; Abcam, 
Cambridge, MA, USA), F4/80 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), Col1a1 (TermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). 
Alexa Fluor 488, 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular probes, Eugene, USA) were used as secondary 
antibodies. Nuclei were revealed by 3 minutes of staining with the nuclear dye 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Afer 3 washes, cells were mounted with antifading solution (Vector 
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and examined under fuorescence microscope (BX51) (Olympus, Japan).
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting. Cell sorting was done using a BD FACS Aria II SORP Cell Sorter 
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Te pellet was resolved in 4 °C Hank’s complete and fltered using 
40 μm nylon gaze. Te sorting of the HSC required excitation via UV laser and measuring the emission in the 
Indo-1 channel based on a 505nm long pass flter. Te sample loading port was set to 4 °C and 300 rpm. We used 
a 100 μm nozzle and a pressure of 20 psi. HBSS with calcium or magnesium was used as sheath fuid. Te fow 
rate was set to 5000 events per second and the threshold was adjusted to 5000. Te collection device was set to 
4 °C. Te collection tube was a 5mL glass tube that contained 1mL of Hank’s BSS without calcium or magnesium, 
10mM HEPES, and 20% of fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Isolated HSCs from normal and CDAHFD treated mice were 
cultured in six-well plates at a density of 4×105
 cells/well for 72 h. Supernatants were collected, and an ELISA 
for Ccl5 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results are 
expressed as Ccl5 secretion for 72h.
Neutralization assay. Neutralizing antibody to Ccl5 and normal goat immunoglobulin G control were 
procured (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and used (2 μg/mL) for the neutralization assay. Antibodies were 
incubated with conditioned media for 1hour at 37 °C before applying it to primary hepatocytes.
Statistical analysis. All the experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. Data 
were expressed as mean +/− SD. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student t test for unpaired data to 
compare the values between the two groups and one-way analysis of variance among multiple groups. Diferences 
in values were considered signifcant at P<0.05.
