INTRODUCTION
Over the years, developments in the management of portal hypertension and variceal bleeding have led to a significant reduction in mortality.1
 Pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies remain the first-line treatment for prevention and treatment 
of variceal bleeding. In cases of first-line treatment failure, secondary options may be considered: surgical shunt creation, 
liver transplantation, and percutaneous treatments. 
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a 
well-described and widely performed technique to create a 
shunt between systemic and portal circulations, generally hepatic vein and portal vein, thereby bypassing the congested 
hepatic system. Unfortunately, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) 
occurs frequently in cirrhosis patients,2 and have been reported 
to lower TIPS success rates to 40–75%.3 While surgical shunt is 
a viable option, patients who do not meet surgical indications 
are left with very limited options. In this case report, we describe an endovascular mesocaval shunt creation with transsplenic approach to successfully manage variceal bleeding in 
a patient with total portal vein occlusion.
CASE REPORT
A 16-year-old female patient with portal hypertension and 
chronic portal vein occlusion was admitted for persistent melena and severe anemia. Patient history included duodenumpreserving resection of pancreatic head and Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy due to choledochal cyst at early childhood. 
Capsule endoscopy confirmed active bleeding with a large 
amount of blood clot at proximal jejunum (Fig. 1B). However, 
contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated total intra- and extrahepatic portal vein obliteration with intrahepatic collaterals and 
splenomegaly, rendering TIPS unfeasible (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, 
mesocaval shunt formation was decided under informed consent. Under US-guidance, a direct puncture of the splenic vein 
was done using a 21-G Chiba needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) and a 7-Fr Flexor Check-Flo Ansel modification 
sheath (Cook Medical). Angiography showed total obliteration 
of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) with cavernous transformation and collateral vessels (Fig. 1C). An 11-mm Arrow balloon catheter (Teleflex, Dublin, Ireland) was placed at the SMVReceived: January 25, 2017 Revised: July 21, 2017

The creation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a widely performed technique to relieve portal hypertension, and to manage recurrent variceal bleeding and refractory ascites in patients where medical and/or endoscopic treatments 
have failed. However, portosystemic shunt creation can be challenging in the presence of chronic portal vein occlusion. In this 
case report, we describe a minimally invasive endovascular mesocaval shunt creation with transsplenic approach for the management of recurrent variceal bleeding in a portal hypertension patient with intra- and extrahepatic portal vein occlusion.

splenic vein confluence as a fluoroscopic target. A 16-G Colapinto 
needle and a 9-Fr Teflon sheath (Transjugular Liver Access Set, 
Cook) were coaxially loaded over a guidewire via US-guided 
puncture of right internal jugular vein. Sheath tip was placed at 
the inferior vena cava (IVC), with a 0.035-inch guidewire placed 
at nearby common hepatic artery, due to concerns for vascular injury. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the Colapinto needle 
was advanced towards the target balloon, traversing the caudate lobe (Fig. 2A and D). After successful puncture of SMV, 
predilation of the extrahepatic tract was performed with 5-mm 
Mustang balloon catheter (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, 
USA). An 8-mm×7-cm stent-graft (S&G Biotech, Seongnam, 
Korea) was placed, followed by stent dilatation using an 8-mm 
FoxCross balloon catheter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, 
IL, USA). Another 7-mm×23-mm Palmas Blue stent (Cordis, 
Miami, FL, USA) was placed at splenic vein to prevent shunt 
wasting. Final angiography revealed patent flow between the 
SMV to IVC with an inverted “Y”-stent configuration (Fig. 2B, C, 
and D) with decreased gastric varices. Portal vein pressure decreased immediately from 26-mmHg to 6-mmHg. Transsplenic 
tract embolization was done using histoacryl glue. No immediate complications occurred. At 9 month follow-up, mild gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding symptom recurred despite the disappearance of esophageal varices at endoscopy. Mild stenosis 
of the proximal stent was observed and treated with balloon 
dilatation. Shunt patency was maintained up to 24-month follow-up, with intermittent balloon dilatation of proximal stent 
stenosis.
 
DISCUSSION
Initially described by Nyman, et al.,4 a total of eight cases of 
mesocaval shunt creation in the presence of chronic portal occlusion4-8 have been reported in English publications (Table 1). 
While mesocaval shunt creation may be offered to patients 
who are not surgical and/or TIPS candidates, certain anatomic 
requirements must be met. Preoperative contrast-enhanced CT 
should be performed to evaluate anatomic feasibilities, since 
potential complications may vary depending on the patient’s 
anatomy.9 Injuries may occur at adjacent vasculatures, pancreas, duodenum, and any other structures. One case reported 
mesocaval shunt creation through the pancreatic uncinate process without complications.5
 However, transpancreatic approach involves theoretical complications of pancreas bisection leading to pancreatic hemorrhage or inflammation7
 and 
should be avoided if possible. 
While most of the reported cases created entirely extrahepatic mesocaval shunts, we created a partially intrahepatic shunt 
by traversing the caudate lobe. A potential advantage for partially intrahepatic shunt is the prevention of shunt migration. 
Because a completely extrahepatic shunt lacks suitable anchoring structures, acute or delayed shunt migration has been suggested as a potential complication.5
 It should be noted that, in 
the presented case, mild stenosis without thrombotic occlusion of the stent graft required repeated balloon dilatation. 
Whether the surrounding hepatic parenchyme contributed to 
intrahepatic stent graft stenosis is unclear. 
To our best knowledge, this is only the second case of endovascular mesocaval shunt creation, with a unique use of transsplenic approach. Transcolonic,4
 transgastric,8 or transabdominal6,7,9 routes have been utilized, but there are concerns for 
increased risks of peritonitis, sepsis and hemorrhage.5,6,8,9 Alternatively, a direct puncture of the splenic vein under US-guidance was adopted. Although not widely advocated, transsplenic approach has been shown to be safe and feasible for portal 
vein intervention with preventable complications.10-13 Moreover, 
transsplenic endovascular process can bypass direct puncture 
of the abdominal wall, intestines, and major vessels with a single 
needle, reducing the risk of infection. In addition, the risk of 
hemorrhage may be reduced since only one wall of the SMV 
is punctured.5

Mesocaval Shunt Creation for Jejunal Variceal Bleeding

Despite the lack of long-term mortality analysis, mesocaval 
shunt offers an effective alternative treatment in patients with 
limited options due to PVT. Previous reports indicate that patients did not have recurrent thrombosis or variceal bleeding 
for as long as 18 months. Although our patient developed recurrent GI bleeding at 9 months, mesocaval shunt remained 
patent up to 24 months, which is the longest follow-up period 
up to date. Therefore, mesocaval shunt offers an alternative 
treatment in cases where TIPS cannot be applied. To determine 
its utility in clinical settings, further research on long-term durability of mesocaval shunt is warranted. 
In conclusion, intrahepatic and extrahepatic PVT or occlusion poses a great challenge in creating percutaneous portosystemic shunts in portal hypertension patients. We present a 
successful fluoroscopy-guided, endovascular mesocaval shunt 
creation technique that can relieve portal hypertension and 
variceal bleeding in patients with total portal vein occlusion.
