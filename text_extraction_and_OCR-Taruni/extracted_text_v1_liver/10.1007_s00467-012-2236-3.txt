Abstract In adults, strong evidence indicates that slowing
progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires an
integrated, multidisciplinary approach. In children, however,
this approach has not been studied. This editorial commentary
to the study by Ajarmeh et al in this volume of Pediatric
Nephrology highlights how a dedicated, multidisciplinary
team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, social
workders and clinic data managers slowed the progression
of CKD in children to a remarkable degree. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of the study and its cost implications,
as well as the issue of determining the optional complement of
physicians and allied health care professionals in such clinics.
Our calculations indicate that the additional costs of such
clinics would be recovered in one year, even if the progession
of CKD were to be delayed by 1 year in only 2% of affected
children. Here, we call on the international pediatric nephrology community to establihs guidelines for forming multidisciplinary clinics throughout the world.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease with multiple
complications that worsen with progression [1]. Managing
adults with CKD requires a careful, integrated approach to
all comorbidities and complications. In 1997, the National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) introduced evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for all stages of CKD and its complications
[2–5]. We now have guidelines for nutrition [6], anemia [7],
and bone metabolism specific to children [8]. There is good
evidence that meeting these guidelines when managing CKD
can improve outcomes, even survival rates [9]. Interventions
such as ACE inhibition and strict blood pressure control can
substantially slow the progression of CKD [10].
At the same time, we know that a multidisciplinary
approach is required to lessen the impact of future cardiovascular disease in these patients [11]. We also know that
social integration (measured as independent living, occupational and vocational training, living with a partner) is poor
in adults with childhood-onset of CKD [12]. Should it
therefore not be standard to have children and adults treated
by a multidisciplinary team of nurses or nurse practitioners,
pharmacists, dieticians, social workers, and physicians, ideally a combination of pediatric nephrologists, perhaps pediatric urologists, pediatric cardiologists, and possibly
physiatrists?

highlights the benefits of such an approach [13]. Both randomized trials found that health information, patient education, telephone-based support, and aid of a support group
slowed disease progression [14]. Most of the data supporting this concept come from case–control studies, but none
found it to be cost-ineffective [15].
Multidisciplinary clinics for children with chronic
kidney disease
Most centers caring for children with CKD have some
multidisciplinary features, but few studies have evaluated
the beneficial effects of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
approach to this disease. In one case–control study, 20
children with CKD stages 2 through 4 receiving the standard
of care were compared with 24 historical controls treated in
a dedicated multidisciplinary CKD clinic. Children in the
multidisciplinary clinic met more of the KDOQI guidelines
after beginning dialysis than did children receiving standard
care [16]. To this study we can gladly add that of Salma
Ajarmeh and her colleagues on the effect of a multidisciplinary care clinic on 125 children with CKD in this issue of
Pediatric Nephrology [17]. The results of these children
were compared with those of 73 historical controls with
CKD. The multidisciplinary approach improved calcium,
hemoglobin, and albumin concentrations, and most impressively, in a mean annualized estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) slope of +0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2
, reversing the
trend in controls, who had a mean slope of −4.0 mL/min/
1.73 m2
. The improved hemoglobin concentrations will also
have improved the outcomes, as indicated by the North
American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study
(NAPRTCS) database [18, 19]. Interestingly, blood pressure
was not significantly better controlled. The study did not
utilize 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, a powerful
tool for slowing progression of CKD, as established by the
Escape trial [10]. However, most Canadian provinces do not
fund ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, despite the overwhelming evidence supporting its use, not only in CKD, but
also in hypertension and cardiovascular disease in general [20].
Dedicated additional funding was the key to establishing
the multidisciplinary CKD clinic. Furthermore, the province
of British Columbia provided an infrastructure with a centralized renal disease registry and a clinic data manager. It is
unclear whether this is a full-time clinic data manager position. In the field of pediatric nephrology, the power of databases is perhaps most apparent in the success of the Renal
Transplant Cooperative Study cited above [21]. The government of the province of British Columbia and the Provincial
Renal Agency should be congratulated for funding the Patient Records, Outcome and Management Information System (PROMIS). The impressive improvement in the eGFR
should convince other government and funding agencies to
implement similar approaches, because the data show that
dialysis costs could be deferred as a result of slowing the
progression of CKD. The substantial savings in dialysis
costs from following similar strategies, including early referral, have also been highlighted in studies of adults, although substantial gaps remain in what we know about
slowing this disease [22].
Limitations and cost savings
The study presented by Ajarmeh and colleagues has several
limitations, mostly arising from the study design. In Pediatric Nephrology (and elsewhere), there are several examples
of prospective studies with negative results, despite
preliminary studies with strong positive results. A larger,
multicenter randomized approach would have a stronger
impact. As pediatric nephrologists, we have to move toward
a culture of multicenter, randomized trials to persuade
governments and funding agencies to invest in databases
and adequately funded multidisciplinary care teams for
children with CKD.
Costs are of paramount importance. Dialysis is one of the
most expensive treatments. When calculating the total costs
of dialysis to society, to the approximately US$97,000
(€78,000) of direct costs (for children it usually costs much
more [23]), must be added the indirect costs of gas, automobile maintenance, driver or attendant, meal expenses, and
so on, which average US$20,855 (€16,770) in adults annually [24]. The authors expect the total per-child cost of
dialysis to exceed 194,000 US dollars (156,000 Euros) per
year, as most children receive 4–6 treatments per week, and
monitoring is much more intensive, all of which adds to
travel costs.
As pediatricians, we must collaborate with health economists to control costs. For instance, compared with conventional in-center hemodialysis, home nocturnal hemodialysis
provides about three times as many treatment hours and
improves clinical and biochemistry factors, all at a 20%
cost-saving [25]. It is one thing to establish that an intervention, such as multidisciplinary care, improves clinical
outcomes, but it is quite another to show substantial savings
by delaying the need for renal replacement therapy. If dialysis can be deferred in 5 of 125 patients per year, the US
$970,000 (€780,000) in savings will easily offset the extra
costs of the extended health-care team (nurse up to a maximum of $95,940/year (€76,393) including benefits ($41.17/
h, € 33.10/h), social worker $95,917/year (€77,130; $41.71/
h, €33.54/h), pharmacist $107,921 ((€ 86,782; $44.99/h,
€33.54/h) dietician $84,128 (€67,649; $36.57/h, €29.41/h),
and a data manager $46,929 (€37,736; $20.37/h, €16.38/h),
totaling $429,897.21; €345,690.54). Thus, the savings
1832 Pediatr Nephrol (2012) 27:1831–1834

achieved by delaying progression of CKD in even 2% of the
children in this Canadian study would fund all the allied
health-care workers needed for such a multidisciplinary
team.
Future directions
The pediatric nephrology community should develop guidelines and standards for creating an optimal multidisciplinary
team to manage children and adolescents with CKD. Apart
from nurses or nurse practitioners, pharmacists, dieticians,
social workers, and pediatric nephrologists, for whom the
appropriate number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) per patient would have to be defined, addressing the social rehabilitation and the higher cardiovascular risk of these patients
should be emphasized. In Germany, the Kuratorium für
Heimdialyse, the major funding agency for pediatric renal
replacement institutions, requires similar centers to have a
ratio of one psychosocial professional for every six patients
with end-stage renal disease [26]. In London, Ontario, with
more than 200 children with CKD stage 2 and higher, we
have no psychologist and only 0.2 FTE of social work and
dietician positions.
The variability of pediatric nephrologists also varies
widely, even within a country. In Canada, the number of
pediatric nephrologists in the provinces ranges from zero to
0.87/100,000 children (average, 0.48; standard deviation,
0.29) [27]. Given the PROMIS registry mentioned above,
we can assume that Ajarmeh and colleagues identified all
children with CKD in British Columbia, which has
4,400,000 people (as of the 2011 census), 1,144,015 of them
children. In Canada, 26% of the population is less than
18 years of age; thus, the overall complement of physicians
is 0.17/100,000 children, and that of allied health-care professionals is 0.09/100,000 children.
The appropriate and optimal complement of providers in
a specialized care center is unknown. Administrative data,
such as admission rates, might help determine the ratio of
allied health-care professionals per 100,000 children, which
is associated with acceptable minimal outcomes and which
can serve as a minimum standard for health-care funding.
Canada is challenged by a small population of only
33,476,688 over a vast land mass (2011 census), and distance to a pediatric nephrology center clearly affects the
outcome of renal replacement therapy [28].
A really important remaining question is whether there
should just be a multidisciplinary or rather a multispecialty
approach. It would really be important to include a pediatric
cardiologist in the multidisciplinary team. Cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality form the single most important
survival factor in these patients, especially in view of the
high prevalence of vascular media calcifications,
cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias in these patients [11].
Multispecialty, multiple-site life-course studies of pediatric
renal and cardiovascular disease and its epigenetic factors
are essential for accurately determining the risk of exposures
and to identify vulnerable sub-populations [29]. There is a
need for the development of quality improvement translational efforts to close the gap between science and practice
and to enhance evidence-based care to improve outcomes.
This is particularly important for this first generation of
long-term survivors of childhood CKD [29, 30]. Especially,
given that children with special health-care needs comprise
12% of all children, but require more than half of pediatric
health-care dollars, there is a real need to improve their
access to preventive and early care [29]. The benefits of a
multidisciplinary health care program have also been demonstrated in children with chronic cardiac disease, with a
significant impact on both the frequency of hospitalizations
and the length of stay [31]. The benefits of including cardiologists in the long-term care of pediatric cancer survivors
at risk of long-term cardiomyopathy due to toxic chemotherapy effects provided an excellent example of multispecialty clinical care [32, 33]. It should be pointed out that the
growing cohort of pediatric cancer survivors forms one of
the most important reasons for the increase of CKD in
children [34].
Conclusion
Ajarmeh and colleagues’study reveals that multidisciplinary
care for children and adolescents with CKD stages 3
through 5 can slow the progression of renal dysfunction to
a remarkable degree. Their team of two pediatric nephrologists, a specialized renal nurse, a dietician, a pharmacist, a
social worker and a clinic data manager, were able to
significantly improve calcium, albumin, and hemoglobin
concentrations for the 125 CKD patients they evaluated.
Theirs is the second, much larger study to clearly show that
multidisciplinary care improved health outcomes in this
population. We agree with the authors that this multidisciplinary approach is clinically valuable and cost-effective
and should indeed become the international norm. We suggest augmenting this team further by regular involvement of
pediatric cardiologists.
