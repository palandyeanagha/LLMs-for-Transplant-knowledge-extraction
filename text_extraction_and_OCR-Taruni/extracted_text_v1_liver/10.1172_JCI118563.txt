Intracellular Advanced Glycation Endproducts in Bovine Endothelial Cells

Abstract
Hyperglycemia rapidly induces an increase in intracellular
advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in bovine endothelial cells, causing an alteration in bFGF activity (Giardino, I., D. Edelstein, and M. Brownlee. 1994. J. Clin. Invest. 94:110–117). Because sugar or sugar-adduct autoxidation
is critical for AGE formation in vitro, we evaluated the role
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intracellular AGE formation, using bovine aortic endothelial cells. 30 mM glucose
increased intracellular ROS formation by 250% and lipid
peroxidation by 330%, while not affecting ROS in the media. In cells depleted of glutathione, intracellular AGE accumulation increased linearly with ROS generation as measured by immunoblotting and the fluorescent probe DCFH
(AGE 0.258–3.531 AU* mm/53104
 cells, DCF 57-149 mean
AU, r 5 .998, P , .002). Deferoxamine, a-tocopherol, and
dimethylsulfoxide each inhibited hyperglycemia-induced
formation of both ROS and AGE. To differentiate an effect
of ROS generation on AGE formation from an effect of
more distal oxidative processes, GM7373 endothelial cell
lines were generated that stably expressed the peroxidationsuppressing proto-oncogene bcl-2. bcl-2 had no effect on hyperglycemia-induced intracellular ROS formation. In contrast, bcl-2 expression decreased both lipid peroxidation
(100% at 3 h and 29% at 168 h) and AGE formation (55% at
168 h). These data show that a ROS-dependent process
plays a central role in the generation of intracellular AGEs,
and that inhibition of oxidant pathways prevents intracellular AGE formation. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1422–1428).

Introduction
A causal relationship between chronic hyperglycemia and diabetic microvascular disease, long inferred from a variety of animal and clinical studies (1) has now been definitely established by data from the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial (2), a multicenter, randomized, prospective controlled
clinical study (3). A relationship between chronic hyperglycemia and diabetic microvascular disease in non–insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients is also supported by
recent literature (4).
The mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes tissue
damage and the resultant clinical complication syndromes can
be conceptually divided into two categories. The first of these
involves rapid changes in intracellular metabolites in response
to diabetic hyperglycemia. These changes can revert to normal
when hyperglycemia is abolished, but their cumulative effect
leads to irreversible tissue damage. Examples of this intracellular mechanistic category include increased polyol pathway
flux, increased de novo diacylglycerol synthesis, and altered intracellular redox state (5–8). The second type of mechanism by
which hyperglycemia causes tissue damage involves slow
changes in extracellular molecules due to hyperglycemiainduced covalent modification. These changes are irreversible
for the life of the extracellular molecule. The best studied example of this extracellular mechanistic category is covalent
modification of proteins by advanced glycation end products
(AGEs)1
 (9, 10).
AGEs have been thought to form only on long-lived extracellular macromolecules, since the rate of AGE formation
from glucose is so slow that more rapidly turned over intracellular proteins would not exist long enough to accumulate
them. Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that AGEs
do, in fact, form on proteins in vivo. In erythrocytes, AGEhemoglobin accounts for 0.42% of circulating hemoglobin in
normal subjects and 0.75% in diabetics (11). In endothelial
cells, a primary site of hyperglycemia-induced damage, increased AGE formation is even more pronounced. After only
one week AGE content increases 13.8-fold in endothelial cells
cultured in high glucose-containing media (12). This extremely
rapid rate of AGE formation most likely reflects hyperglycemia-induced increases in intracellular sugars which are much
more reactive than glucose, such as fructose, glucose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (13). Basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) is the major AGE-modified protein in
endothelial cells, but other proteins are also modified. Endothelial cell cytosol mitogenic activity is reduced 70% by AGE
formation when cytosolic AGE-bFGF is increased 6.1-fold.
In vitro, chelators, sulfhydryl compounds and antioxidants
profoundly inhibit AGE formation (14), presumably by reducing transition metal catalysts of oxygen radical reactions and
by scavenging of various free radical species. Thus, autoxidation of either free sugars of Amadori products on protein plays
a major role in AGE formation in vitro. In this study, we have

Bcl-2 Expression Prevents Intracellular Advanced Glycation Endproducts 1423
evaluated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intracellular AGE formation, using bovine aortic endothelial cells
and endothelial cell lines. In addition, we have investigated the
effects of free radical inhibition and peroxidation suppression
on intracellular AGE formation, using antioxidants and cells
stably transfected with the proto-oncogene bcl-2.
Methods
Cell culture conditions. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAE cells)
(passage 4–10) were a gift from Dr. El Sabban (Department of Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York).
Transformed FBAE GM 7373 cells (15) were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Both cell types were maintained in
Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), essential and nonessential amino acids and antibiotics. Confluent cells used for experiments were incubated for different times in MEM containing 0.4% FBS (growth arrest conditions) to
mimic the state of endothelial cells in vivo, with either 5 or 30 mM
glucose. Culture media was changed daily, and glucose concentration
was measured before each change of media using a Beckman glucose
analyzer. The media and all supplements were purchased from
GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, NY). BAE cells were also incubated with
30 mM glucose for 168 h in the presence of either 100 mM deferoxamine,
5 mg/ml a-tocopherol, 100 mM dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or 25 U/ml
catalase, all obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).
Fluorescent measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS). The intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species was
detected by using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate
bis(acetoxy-methyl) (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene,
OR). Cells (1 3 106/ml) were loaded with 10 mM DCFH-DA, and analyzed by Becton Dickenson FACSCAN with excitation and emission settings of 495 and 525 nm, respectively (16).
Extracellular free radical detection. The generation of hydroxyl
radicals by glucose in the extracellular media under various culture
conditions was assessed by measuring the formation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) from salicylate using HPLC with electrochemical detection (17). Briefly, complete MEM media containing either 5
or 30 mM glucose was incubated for 24 h at 378C in the presence of 1
mM salicylate (SA) (Sigma Chemical Co.). MEM containing 0.33 mM
xanthine plus 0.4 U/ml of xanthine oxidase (Sigma Chemical Co.) was
used as a positive control. Salicylate concentration was simultaneously measured with fluorescence detection (300 nm excitation,
412 nm emission) and DHBA was expressed as a ratio to salicylate
recovered.
Measurement of cellular lipid peroxides. The level of lipid peroxides produced in endothelial cells under various culture conditions
was fluorimetrically determined by the TBAR reaction as described
previously (18). TBA-reactive substances were expressed as nmol
MDA equivalents/106 cells by extrapolation from external standard
curves.
Induction of intracellular free radical generation. BAE cells (1 3
106/ml) were incubated for 3 h in 30 mM glucose MEM containing
0.5, 1, and 5 mM of the sulfhydryl reagent diethyl maleate (DEM)
(Sigma Chemical Co.) which depletes intracellular glutathione.
Measurement of total intracellular AGE protein. Cytosol fractions
of confluent cells were prepared as described previously (19). Equal
amounts of intracellular protein from cells grown under different culture conditions were dot blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH). AGEs were detected by using the monoclonal anti-AGE antibody 6D12 (20). The immunocomplexes were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham International,
Amersham, UK) and evaluated by scanning densitometry using an
Ultrascan XL (LKB Bromma, Sweden). The assay was standardized
by blotting different amounts of AGE-bovine serum albumin generated by incubation of BSA (1.6 grams) with glucose (3 grams) in 10
ml of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 90 d at 378C. The
assay was reproducibly linear over a range of 0.5–50 ng/ml standard
AGE-BSA (21). The specific epitope recognized by monoclonal and
polyclonal antibodies to AGEs are not known. The 6D12 antibody
used in these experiments has been shown not to recognize the AGE
structures FFI, pentosidine, pyrraline or free carboxymethyllysine
(20, 22, and Horuichi, S., personal communication).
Generation of lipid-peroxidation-modified protein. Stable preparations of linoleic/arachidonic acid vesicles were prepared as described
(23). Liposomes (10 mg/ml) and human serum albumin (2 mg/ml)
(Sigma Chemical Co.) were incubated with or without 0.1 mM CuSO4
in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 378C for 24 h (24). At
the end of the incubation, the protein was dot blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.), and immunoblotted either with monoclonal antibody specific for MDA-lysine (MDA-2
monoclonal antibody) (25), or with the 6D12 anti-AGE monoclonal
antibody. The immunocomplexes were visualized using an ECL kit
(Amersham International), and evaluated by scanning densitometry
using an Ultrascan XL (LKB).
Generation of bcl-2 stable transfectants. GM7373 cells were cotransfected with the plasmids pHSVbcl-2 and pSV7
 neo (26) using lipofectin reagent (GIBCO BRL). pHSVbcl-2 was constructed by digesting
pBShbcl-2 (gift of Dr. Arnon Rosenthal, Genentech, San Francisco,
CA) with ECORI and ligating into pHSV-Puc (27–29) digested with
the same enzyme. In this vector, bcl-2 is under the transcriptional
control of the HSV immediate early (IE) 4/5 promoter. Cells were selected against G418 (400 mg/ml), and bcl-2 expression was demonstrated using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human bcl-2
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
Results
Hyperglycemia increases intracellular ROS formation and lipid
peroxidation. To evaluate the effect of increased extracellular
glucose concentration on intracellular ROS formation and an
index of cumulative oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, the
intracellular ROS level was determined by DCFH-DA probe
oxidation and the level of lipid peroxides in BAE cells was determined by the TBARS reaction after various incubation
times in 5 and 30 mM glucose (Fig. 1). Incubation in 30 mM
glucose for 24 h increased intracellular ROS 2.5-fold. No significant difference in MDA equivalents/106
 cells was detected
when BAE cells were exposed to 5 or 30 mM glucose for 24 h
(22060.05 vs. 22060.04 pmol MDA equivalents/106
 cells, P 5
NS). However, in cells exposed to 30 mM glucose for 168 h,
lipid peroxides were increased 3.25-fold compared with cells
exposed to 5 mM glucose (22060.05 vs. 71660.06 pmol MDA
equivalents/106
 cells, P , .001), reflecting the cumulative effect
of hyperglycemia-induced ROS. To exclude the possibility that
autoxidation of glucose in the media was responsible for ROS
generation (30, 31), extracellular reactive oxygen species were
determined in both 5 and 30 mM glucose-containing media. At
the time of media change (24 h), there was no increase of total
DHAB level in the 30 mM glucose MEM vs. 5 mM glucose
MEM (5 mM glucose: 0.08360.01 total DHAB/SA 3103
; 30
mM glucose: 0.03660.003 total DHAB/SA 3103; xanthinexanthine oxidase: 3.1360.4 total DHAB/SA 3103
). Thus, the
oxidative damage in BAE cells exposed to 30 mM glucose is a
consequence of increased intracellular ROS production.
Increasing ROS at constant glucose concentration accelerates intracellular AGE formation. To evaluate the role of ROS
in intracellular AGE formation, BAE cells were variably depleted of glutathione by increasing concentrations of DEM in
5 mM glucose-containing media (32). For each concentration

1424 Giardino et al.
of DEM used, both the intracellular ROS levels and the cytosol AGE-protein content were determined as described in
Methods. Treatment of cells for 3 h with 0.5 mM, 1 or 5 mM
DEM increased the intracellular ROS levels 1.2-, 2-, and 2.6-
fold, respectively (Fig. 2). These increases in intracellular ROS
were associated with a concomitant increase in intracellular
AGE formation of 1.9-, 7.7- and 13.7-fold. The linear association of increased intracellular ROS formation with increased
AGE formation (r 5 .998, P , 0.002) at constant glucose concentration suggested that a ROS-dependent process plays a
central role in the generation of intracellular AGEs.
Lipid-peroxidation doesn’t induce protein modification recognized by the monoclonal anti-AGE antibody. Since a number of in vitro studies suggest that lipid peroxidation and NEG/
AGE formation may involve similar intermediates (33), the reactivity of the 6D12 monoclonal antibody with lipid peroxidation products was evaluated. After 24 h incubation of HSA
with linoleic/arachidonic acid liposomes under oxidative conditions, the lipid peroxidation product level measured by the
TBARS reaction was 3.3560.142 nmoles MDA (no MDA was
detectable in the controls). Lipid-peroxide-modified proteins
were detected by MDA-2 monoclonal antibody which is specific for MDA modified lysine (AU*mm 2.860.3). Lipid peroxidation products were not recognized by the anti-AGE
monoclonal antibody 6D12 under the same assay conditions.
Antioxidants reduce both intracellular oxidative damage and
AGE formation. To evaluate the effect of ROS inhibition on
intracellular AGE-modified protein formation, BAE cells
were incubated for 168 h with 30 mM glucose alone or in the
presence of either 100 mM deferroxamine, 5 mg/ml a-tocopherol, 100 mM DMSO (Fig. 3), or 25 U/ml catalase, and levels of lipid peroxides and AGEs were determined. Incubation
with 30 mM glucose alone increased the level of lipid peroxides by 325% and the level of intracellular AGEs by 261%.
The presence of catalase, an inhibitor of hydroxyl radical production from extracellular sources, had no effect on either intracellular lipid peroxide levels or intracellular AGE levels
(data not shown). In contrast, the effects of high glucose on
both intracellular lipid peroxide levels and intracellular AGE
levels were completely prevented by the chelator deferroxamine, the antioxidant a-tocopherol, and the radical scavenger
DMSO. These data demonstrate that there is causal relationship between hyperglycemia-induced ROS generation and intracellular AGE formation.
Bcl2 expression in endothelial cells doesn’t affect the increase in ROS induced by 30 mM glucose. In lymphocytes, bcl-2

Bcl-2 Expression Prevents Intracellular Advanced Glycation Endproducts 1425
has been shown to prevent oxidative cell damage such as lipid
peroxidation by acting at a step distal to the generation of
ROS (34). Therefore, GM7373 endothelial cell lines were generated that stably expressed the peroxidation-suppressing
proto-oncogene bcl-2, to differentiate an effect of ROS generation on AGE formation from an effect of more distal oxidative processes. GM7373 bc12 and GM7373 Neo cells were exposed to 30 mM glucose for different time periods and
intracellular ROS levels were measured using the DCFH-DA
probe. As shown in Fig. 4, no differences in the increase of free
radical generation were detected between GM7373 Neo and
bcl-2 cells when they were exposed to 30 mM glucose for up to
168 h. In both cell types, after 3 and 168 h exposure to hyperglycemia, the intracellular ROS levels increased 7.3- and 11.5-
fold, respectively.
Bcl2 expression in endothelial cells reduces the increase in
lipid peroxidation induced by 30 mM glucose. To evaluate the
effect of bcl-2 expression on oxidative processes distal to ROS
formation, the level of lipid peroxides was determined by the
TBARS reaction after various incubation times in 30 mM glucose. After 3 h of incubation, lipid peroxide levels in the Neo
cells were increased 1.9-fold (Fig. 5) while the levels in bcl-2
cells were the same as at 0 time. After 168 h of incubation, lipid
peroxide levels in the Neo cells were increased fivefold, while
in bcl-2 cells the hyperglycemia-induced increase was reduced
by 35%.
Bcl2 expression in endothelial cells reduces the increase in
intracellular AGEs induced by 30 mM glucose. To determine the
effect of bcl-2 expression on the formation of intracellular
AGE-proteins, intracellular AGE content was determined in
Neo and bcl-2 endothelial cell extracts prepared after varying
incubation times with 30 mM glucose (Fig. 6). After 3 h incubation, AGEs in the Neo cells were increased 3.6-fold. In bcl-2
cells, 40% of this hyperglycemia-induced increase was prevented. Similarly, after 168 h incubation, intracellular AGEs in
the Neo cells were increased 12-fold, while 61% of this hyperglycemia-induced increase was prevented in the bcl-2 cells.
Discussion
We have previously shown that hyperglycemia rapidly increases intracellular AGE formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells, with significant functional alteration of bFGF. It was
proposed that similar rapid intracellular AGE formation in
susceptible diabetic tissues could contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular and neurologic complications (12). In this study,
we demonstrate that hyperglycemia also increases intracellular
ROS formation and subsequent lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells. When glucose concentration is held constant, increased ROS generation by DEM is associated with a concomitant increase in intracellular AGE formation. If diethylmaleate,
like N-ethylmaleimide, also inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosFigure 3. Effect of antioxidants on BAE

phate dehydrogenase (35), the concentration of AGE-forming
triose-phosphates could be elevated in addition to ROS. However, no inhibition of GAPDH was observed at glutathionedepleting concentrations of DEM in mouse brain (36). ROSinduced lipid peroxidation and ROS-induced intracellular
AGE formation are both completely inhibited by three different antioxidants. Expression of the peroxidation-suppressing
proto-oncogene bcl-2 (34) does not effect the increase in endothelial cell ROS generation induced by hyperglycemia, but
it does reduce the increase in both lipid peroxidation and
AGE formation. Thus, a ROS-dependent process distal to superoxide and its conversion to peroxides plays a central role in
the generation of intracellular AGEs.
Two mechanisms have been proposed that may explain
how hyperglycemia causes increased ROS formation (30, 31,
37–41). One mechanism involves the transition metalcatalyzed
autoxidation of protein-bound Amadori products which yields
superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds. The other mechanism involves the transition
metal-catalyzed autoxidation of free sugars, which also yields
dicarbonyl compounds and superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.
Autoxidation of protein-bound Amadori products appears to
be the most important source of free radicals under near physiologic conditions (40). Our findings that no ROS generation
was detectable in the glucose-containing extracellular media
while intracellular ROS increased 2.5-fold, and that catalase in
the media had no effect on intracellular lipid peroxide levels or
intracellular AGE levels, are consistent with this interpretation. It is possible, however, that inside cells exposed to hyperglycemia, elevated levels of non-glucose sugars (42) and nonglucose derived Amadori products make proportionately different contributions to ROS generation.
The observed association between increased ROS and intracellular AGE formation could simply reflect the fact that
transition metal-catalyzed free sugar or Amadori product oxidation and free radical production are linked to the formation
of dicarbonyl precursors of AGEs. Inhibition of hyperglycemia-induced lipid peroxidation and AGE formation by the
iron chelator deferoxamine is consistent with this interpretation. Inhibition by a-tocopherol, a lipophilic peroxyl and hydroxyl radical scavenger, and by DMSO a hydroxyl radical
scavenger, however, suggests that hydroxyl radicals themselves
or a more stale hydroxyl-derived radical may be directly involved in the generation of additional reactive intermediates
from free sugars or Amadori products (43–46).
Further support for the hypothesis that an ROS-dependent
event distal to superoxide generation and its conversion to peroxides plays a central role in the generation of AGEs comes
from results of the experiments with bcl-2. This anti-apoptotic
protein has been shown to block the lipid peroxidation that occurs with apoptotic cell death, while having no effect on basal
or stimulated peroxide production in lymphocyte cell lines
(34). Thus, bcl-2 blocks the cumulative effects of oxidative
stress at a point distal to the generation of superoxide and its
conversion to peroxides. In endothelial cells, bcl-2 expression
has similar effects. It does not affect ROS generation induced
by hyperglycemia, but it does block lipid peroxidation. At the
same time, bcl-2 expression also blocks hyperglycemia-induced

Bcl-2 Expression Prevents Intracellular Advanced Glycation Endproducts 1427
AGE formation. One plausible role for bcl-2 would be as a
nonreactive trap of AGE-producing free radical species. It is
also possible that bcl-2 functions as a peroxidase or reductase,
although such activities have not yet been detected.
The demonstration that an ROS-dependent process plays a
central role in the generation of intracellular AGEs, and that
inhibition of oxidant pathways prevents intracellular AGE formation have important implications for pharmacologic attempts at preventing diabetic complications. Currently, AGE
formation can be reduced both by lowering hyperglycemia
(47) and by blocking reactive AGE precursors with drugs such
as aminoguanidine (48). Both interventions are effective in
preventing diabetic complications in animal models. Blocking
intracellular AGE formation by antioxidants offers an additional strategy for the potential prevention of diabetic complications that deserves further exploration.
