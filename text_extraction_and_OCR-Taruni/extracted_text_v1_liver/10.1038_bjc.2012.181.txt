Sir,
We read with great interest the paper ‘Lung cancer in the Swiss
HIV Cohort Study: role of smoking, immunodeficiency and
pulmonary infection’ by Clifford et al (2012) about the characteristics of HIV patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer. In particular,
they found out how in their cohort lung cancer was not associated
with CD4 þ cell count nadir, history of AIDS and use of c-ART as
well. On behalf of the Italian Cooperative Group on AIDS and
Tumors (GICAT) we performed a 25-year survey, between
November 1986 and March 2009, collecting 70 consecutive patients
with lung cancer and HIV infection, of whom 34 (50%) belonged
to the era before the introduction of c-ART into clinical practice
and the remaining 36 (52%) to the era after it became available. In
Table 1 we summarise the clinical characteristics of the patients.
Our patients were mostly intravenous drug users (overall, 57%)
and males (90%); the overall median age was 43.5 years. All
patients were heavy smokers (X20 packs per year), except for one
who did not smoke at all and three patients for whom data were
not available; overall 94% of the patients were smokers.
Median CD4 þ count nadir did not differ significantly in both
groups, with 278 cells ml
 1 (12–987) in the pre-c-ART cohort and
339 cells ml
 1 (4–761) in the post-c-ART group: overall, 19 patients
(27%) showed a CD4 þ nadir o200 cells ml
 1
, 11 (22%)
4500 ml
 1 and 30 (42%) within 200–499 ml 1
. Data about the
viral load at the time when lung cancer was diagnosed are available
only for the post-c-ART group of patients; in most cases, 21 out of
36 (58%), it was undetectable, while in 5 patients (14%) it was
X10 000 copies per ml, in 2 patients (6%) 500–9999 copies per ml,
and in 8 patients (22%) o500 copies per ml.
These data confirm that lung cancer in HIV is not associated
with immunodeficiency; as already pointed out by other investigators (Powles et al, 2003), this might suggest that the immune
function has less of a role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer than
in Kaposi’s sarcoma or non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
The overall survival rate was significantly better for the post-cART group, 3.8 months vs 7 months, P ¼ 0.01, in the pre- and postc-ART group, respectively. However, the cause of death was
comparable between both groups, with lung tumour being the
leading cause. The two groups differed for performance status (PS)
at the time of presentation, with poorer PS score in the pre-c-ART
patients. As the PS at the time of diagnosis is one of the strongest
predictors of overall survival for lung cancer, it is likely that the
better outcome for the post-c-ART group may depend on better PS
at diagnosis of lung cancer. When the cause of death was lung
cancer, overall survival was significantly better for the post-c-ART
patients (7 vs 4.1 months in the post- and pre-c-ART group,
respectively); for example, the cancer-related mortality rate at 1
year was 85% for the pre-c-ART patients vs 67% for the post-cART patients.
With our data we strongly confirm the association between
smoking and lung cancer in HIV patients, the lack of association of
immunodeficiency, as well as an improvement of survival in the
post-c-ART period, likely from a gain in PS score.
