Tim-3 expression and its role in
hepatocellular carcinoma
Feifei Liu, Yanning Liu and Zhi Chen*
Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors in the world, and its mortality is still on the
rise. Limited treatments and low chemotherapy sensitivity of HCC make new therapeutic strategies urgently
needed. With the rise of immune checkpoint blockade, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and anti-PD-1 antibodies have
shown therapeutic effects in various tumors. T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), a newly discovered
immune checkpoint molecule, plays a major role in the development of HCC. Tim-3 can be used to evaluate
the prognosis and therapeutic effects in HCC, and Tim-3 intervention has shown anti-tumor effects in
preclinical experiments. This review summarizes findings regarding Tim-3 and HCC in recent years and
discusses the rationale of Tim-3 as a therapeutic target for HCC.
Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Tim-3, Immune checkpoint blockade, Immunotherapy
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
primary liver cancer. It is the sixth most common
tumor and the third leading cause of cancer death [1].
For decades, HCC mortality in the EU, North America,
and Latin America has gradually increased, and it will
continue rising until 2020 according to predictions [2].
The HCC mortality in East Asia showed appreciable
declines, but it maintains at a high level [2]. HCC is a
typical inflammation-driven disease, nearly 90% incidences of which develop in the context of chronic liver
inflammation including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Surgical
resection, transplantation, radiofrequency ablation,
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and targeted
agents (Sorafenib, Regorafenib, and Lenvatinib) have
been proven to prolong survival in HCC patients [1].
Nonetheless, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently
needed due to the low chemotherapy sensitivity of
HCC and the limited targeted drugs for HCC.
Previous studies on the tumor microenvironment
(TME) have shown its crucial role in tumor progression
and prognosis [3, 4]. The immune system usually has
the ability to identify and eliminate tumor cells.
However, in the TME, tumors develop strategies to impair functions of the immune cells by reducing antigenicity and exploiting feedback inhibition [5]. Thus,
tumor immunotherapy has been developed aiming to
enhance the body’s own immune system and induce
anti-tumor responses. In 2013, the journal Science listed
tumor immunotherapy including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells and immune checkpoint
inhibitors as the major breakthrough of the year [6].
The success of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies in the treatment of early
melanoma introduced immune checkpoint molecules
as emerging targets for immunotherapy. To date, six
immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for
clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In HCC, clinical studies have focused on the
programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell
death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway and
CTLA-4 pathway. The PD-1 antibody Nivolumab was
proved to be efficient in phase I/II clinical trials of advanced HCC patients, with high rates of response and
satisfactory safety [7]. The PD-1 antibody Pembrolizumab, PD-L1 antibody Durvalumb, and CTLA-1 antibody Ipilimumab, Tremelimumab, and others have
entered phase I/II clinical trials, in combination with
each other or with other targeted drugs [8]. As a newly
discovered immune checkpoint molecule, T cell

immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) antibodies have
curative effects in laboratory-scale studies in several tumors, and some of them have entered phase I/II clinical
trials (Table 1); therefore, Tim-3 has the potential to
become a new target for cancer immunotherapy.
Structure and functions of Tim-3
Gene structure and protein structure of Tim-3
The Tim-3-encoding gene HAVCR2 is located at 5q33.2
in the human genome, a region that has been linked to
asthma, allergy, and autoimmunity [9]. Tim-3 is a type
I cell-surface glycoprotein, including an N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, a mucin domain with
O-linked glycosylation and N-linked glycosylation, a
single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region with a tyrosine phosphorylation motif. Tim-3 was
first identified as an immunosuppressive molecule on
the surface of T helper 1 (Th1) cells [10] and was then
detected on cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), monocytes,
macrophages, natural killer cells (NKs), and dendritic
cells(DCs).
Ligands and functions of Tim-3
Tim-3 plays a key role in inhibiting both adaptive
and innate immune responses. When it comes to different functions and cell types, Tim-3 binds to specific ligands. The most studied Tim-3 ligands are
galectin-9 (Gal-9), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), highmobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1
(CEACAM-1) (Table 2).
High expression of Tim-3 on effector T cells indicates
T cell exhaustion, showing inhibited proliferation and
TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion. The interaction of Tim-3
and its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9), mediates effector T
cell apoptosis through calcium-calpain-caspase-1
pathway [11, 12]. While on activated T cells, CEACAM1 and Tim-3 are co-expressed and form a heterodimer to suppress T cell function and downregulate its
anti-tumor immunity [13]. Tim-3+ Tregs in tumor loci
exert greater suppressor function than Tim-3− Tregs.
The Tim-3+ Tregs participate in shaping tumorimmune microenvironment (TIME) through supporting
development of exhausted CD8+ T cells and limiting
the expansion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-secreting
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [14]. Upregulation of Tim-3 on
macrophages facilitates their M2 polarization and increases IL-6 secretion, further promoting tumor growth
[15]. Tim-3 appears to have conflicting effects on DCs
and NKs as its entire different ligands. The
immunoglobulin-like region of the TIM family specifically recognizes PtdSer [16]. Interaction of PtdSer with
Tim-3 on DCs mediates elimination of apoptosis cells
and cross-presentation [17], while interaction of
HMGB1 and Tim-3 on DCs suppresses nucleic acidmediated innate immune responses in tumor site [18].
Tim-3 is expressed on mature NKs, and interaction of
Gal-9 and Tim-3 increases IFN-γ production in NKs
[19]. But the opposite result was obtained in a study in
chronic hepatitis B [20]. The Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway in
TIL cells is well studied in HCC.
Tim-3 in HCC diagnosis and prognosis
Tim-3 polymorphisms and HCC
Nearly 6000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
within the TIM3 gene have been identified, and several
(rs246871 [21], rs10515746 [22, 23], rs10053538 [22],
rs1036199 [22], rs11742259 [23], and rs35690726 [23])
may correlate to diseases. Genotype CC of rs246871 in
the TIM3 gene is associated with an increased probability of HBV-associated HCC [21]. GT+TT genotypes of
rs10053538 in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients

indicate higher susceptibility to HCC, more advanced
tumor grade, and shorter OS, compared with genotype
GG. Zhu et al. conducted several studies to explore the
associations of rs10053538 in TIM-3 with HCC. Their
study in 2012 [24] found that rs10053538 GT+TT genotypes were more frequent in HCC patients of tumor
grades III and IV, comparing to that in HCC patients
with grades I and II, while GG genotype showed the
opposite. Another study in 2013 [25] found that
rs10053538 GT+TT genotypes were associated with
HCC compared with cirrhosis patients without HCC.
They also correlated rs10053538 with the overall survival (OS) of a prospective cohort of HBV-related HCC
patients, showing that the rs10053538 GG genotype
was significantly associated with longer OS, compared
with GT+TT genotypes [26]. A recent study showed
that rs10053538 GT+TT genotypes were associated
with increased TIM-3 expression in HCC tissues [27],
possibly promoting HCC progression through T cell
dysfunction and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-
induced immunosuppression, further supporting the effect of TIM3 polymorphisms on HCC traits.
Tim-3 as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC
Meta-analysis has demonstrated that higher expression
of Tim-3 was significantly correlated with shorter OS
(seven studies, HR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.38–2.57; P < 0.001)
and more advanced tumor stage (three studies, III/IV
vs. I/II, RR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.45–2.81; P < 0.001) in cancer patients [28]. The aberrant expression of Tim-3 has
been found in tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating T cells,
Tregs, and TAMs of HCC tissue. It has been verified
that Tim-3 expression is correlated with HCC outcome.
Hang Li et al. [29] revealed that the higher number of
Tim-3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells in HCC tissues, the
shorter the survival of patients. In addition, there are
positive correlations of Tim-3 expression on CD14+
monocytes with tumor grades and Tim-3 expression on
TAMs with poor prognosis in HCC patients [15].
Serum soluble Tim-3 (sTim-3) level is also associated
with OS in HCC patients [30]. Moreover, Tim-3 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
may be used to predict recurrence in the therapeutic
liver-resected HCC patients [31]. Recurrent HCC patients present significantly higher ratio Tim-3+ CD4+ T
cells and Tim-3+CD8+ T cells in PBMCs before and
after liver resection than non-recurrent HCC patients.
Tim-3 can also be applied as an indicator to judge
treatment efficiency. Yttrium-90-radio embolization
(Y90-RE) reduces local advanced HCC and delays disease progression. By analyzing the immune status of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor tissues,
and PBMCs at various time points, Chew et al. [32]
found that Tim-3+CD8+ T cells were more abundant
in PBMCs of sustained responders (SRs) both before
and after Y90-RE than those in non-responders. And
the Tim-3+ CD8+ T cells in SRs are able to produce
pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated in vitro.
The results indicate that Tim-3+CD8+ T cells in SRs
obtain potential anti-tumor effects when appropriately
stimulated by tumor antigens released under radiotherapy. The high ratio of systemic Tim-3+CD8+ T
cells before Y90-RE denotes patients with a sustained
response after therapy as prolonging time-to-tumor
progression over 6 months.
In summary, an increase in Tim-3 expression in
tumor-infiltrating T cells, TAMs, and PBMCs and
serum sTim-3 level in HCC indicates poor prognosis,
in the form of shorter survival, more advanced tumor
grades, and higher probability of recurrence. However,
the high percentage of systemic Tim-3+ T cells appears

Tim-3 in TIME and HCC cells
The tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) acts a
crucial role in tumor progression. TIME contains numerous immune cells including tumor-infiltrating T
cells, TAMs, regulatory cells, and resident natural
killer cells. Immunosuppression is a major feature of
the TIME [4]. An immunosuppressive gradient exists
across the TME, the nontumor microenvironment
(NTME), and peripheral blood in primary HCC [33].
Tregs, tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRMs),
and TAMs are enriched in the HCC TME. The expression of T cell exhaustion markers (PD-1, Tim-3,
and CTLA-4) on Tregs and TRMs from TME is
higher than those in NTME or peripheral blood.
Tim-3 and TILs
The expression of Tim-3 was first discovered on CD4
+ and CD8+ T cells. The most notable role of Tim-3
is in TILs. Tim-3 was well known as a T cell exhaustion marker to suppress CTL and effector Th1 cell
function. Several studies have shown that Tim-3 levels
were markedly elevated in tumor-infiltrating T cells
[29, 31, 34, 35].
CD8+ T cells are the most important component of
TILs that exert anti-tumor functions. Large numbers
of CD8+ TILs in HCC are correlated with a fair
prognosis, including improved OS, longer relapse-free
survival, and delayed disease progression [36]. CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can directly contact
and lyse target cells via perforin and granzymes or induce target cell apoptosis via Fas/FasL signaling and
secretion of IFN-γ and TNF. However, CD8+ TILs
separated from human HCC tissues are functionally
exhausted as determined by upregulated expression of
PD-1, Tim-3 [29], CTLA-4, and lymphocyte activation
gene 3 (LAG-3) [31] compared with those from human
CHB tissues [37], tumor-free liver tissues [29, 34], and
peripheral blood [34]. Functional testing further
showed that these Tim3+CD8+ TILs exhibited reduced
cell proliferation (Ki67) and cell activity and the production of effector cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α),
indicating low anti-tumor activity.
CD4+ T cells exert contrasting roles in HCC that
range from effector cell function to regulatory cell
function [38]. CD4+ Th1 cells produce high levels of
IFN-γ and TNF-α upon antigen stimulation and take
charge of cell-mediated immunity to intracellular
pathogens and tumor cells [39], while CD4+CD25+
Tregs mediate immune suppression [40]. Tim-3 mediates Th1 cell apoptosis [10], and loss of Th1 cells promotes HCC growth [41]. Several studies have shown
high expression of Tim-3 along with reduced proliferation and activation potentials of CD4+ TILs in HCC
tissues [29, 34, 37, 42]. The ligand Gal-9 is expressed
on tumor-infiltrating APCs. DCs express a low level of
Gal-9 (10%) and TAMs express the highest level of
Gal-9 in HCC tissues [34]. Li et al. [29] found that
anti-Tim-3 mAb could enhance Ki67 expression and
IL-2 and IFN-γ production in Tim-3+CD4+ T cells
cocultured with HCC-derived Gal-9+ TAMs by blocking the interaction of Gal-9 with Tim-3. On the other
hand, coculture of CD14+ monocytes with TILs induced Gal-9 expression in monocytes via IFN-γ pathways [29]. These data suggest that tumor-infiltrating T
cell-derived IFN-γ induces TAMs to express Gal-9, and
binding of Gal-9 with Tim-3 in turn leads to T cell
dysfunction.
In addition to its expression on Th1 cells, Tim-3 is
also expressed on CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells. Upregulated Tim-3 expression levels in FoxP3+ Tregs are
observed in tumor sites [43]. Yan et al. [42] isolated
TILs from human HCC tissues and showed that
tumor-derived Tim-3+CD4+ T cells exhibited an impaired capacity to produce IFN-γ and IL-2. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the majority of these T
cells expressed high levels of CD25, Foxp3, CTLA-4,
and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), which were also shared by human
Tregs. They also verified a direct interaction between
Tim-3+CD4+ cells and Gal-9+ cells by fluorescence
in situ hybridization, indicating in vivo crosstalk between Tim-3+ CD4+ T cells and Gal-9-expressing
cells. These studies suggest that TILs and Tim-3/
Gal-9 signaling participate in a feedback mechanism
to downregulate anti-tumor immunity; blocking Tim3 can restore T cell function and improve anti-tumor
immunity.
Tim-3 and TAMs
The liver has the largest population of macrophages
that play a central role in clearing bacteremia and
recruiting immune cells. However, TAMs, especially the
M2 phenotype, act as protumoral macrophages,
through inhibiting effector T cell-mediated anti-tumor
immunity, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting
HCC cell growth and metastasis [44, 45]. Yan et al. [15]
has explained how Tim-3 affects activation and protumoral effects of TAMs in HCC. Transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β) in the HCC microenvironment enhances the transcription of Tim-3 in TAMs. Tim-3
then promotes bone marrow-derived macrophages and
peripheral monocytes to differentiate into M2-like macrophages, displaying enhanced expression of M2
markers CD206 and Arg-1 and increased IL-10 production but decreased IL-12 production. Interfering Tim-3
Liu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2018) 11:126 Page 4 of 12

with the anti-Tim-3 antibody, Tim-3 siRNA or Tim-3
shRNA-expressing lentivirus has the opposite outcome. M2 macrophages upregulate Tim-3 expression
and increase IL-6 production through the NF-κB
pathway. IL-6 consequently fosters HCC growth, migration, and invasion. Our study [46] was consistent
with the former study showing that Tim-3+ monocytes conferred typical characteristics of M2 macrophages with higher CD163 and CD206 expression and
IL-10 production. These studies suggest that Tim-3
on macrophages facilitate M2 polarization, promoting
HCC progression by IL-6-induced tumor growth and
upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also
observed reduced Tim-3 expression on monocytes
was closely related to altered phagocytic activity and
HLA-DR expression in monocytes [46]. The interaction between PtdSer and Tim-3 on phagocytic cells
mediates uptake of apoptotic cells [16, 17]. We can
reasonably assume that Tim3-expressing macrophages
fail to uptake apoptotic cells, further affecting the
homeostasis of the TME.
Tim-3 and HCC cells
In addition to modulating immune cell functions,
Tim-3 also regulates the function of tumor cells directly. The expression of Tim-3 on tumor cells has
been detected in various cancers, including melanoma
[47], non-small-cell lung cancers [48], osteosarcoma
[49], malignant pleural mesothelioma [50], clear-cell
renal cell carcinoma [51], cervical cancer [52], and
bladder urothelial carcinoma [53]. A further mechanistic study [54] showed that tumor cell-intrinsic Tim3 would promote HCC development by triggering
auto-secretion of IL-6 and then accelerating tumor
growth through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, overexpression of Tim-3 by introducing its
lentiviral-expressing particles in SMMC-7721 cell line
promoted cell migration and invasion by facilitating
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [55].
These studies indicate that Tim-3 expression in HCC
cells accelerates tumor growth through auto-secretion
of IL-6 and enhanced metastatic ability of HCC cells
by promoting EMT. On the other side, ligands of
Tim-3 are spread across the TME, possibly mediating
crosstalk between HCC cells and non-parenchymal
cells, further affecting the aggressive phenotype of
HCC cells.
Regulation of Tim-3 expression
Given the significance of Tim-3 in HCC, it is necessary
to understand its regulatory factors.
Cytokines in connection with T cell activation are
involved in induction of Tim-3 expression on T cells.
IL-12 and IL-27 signaling has been demonstrated to
enhance transcriptional induction of TIM3 in CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, mainly through the STAT1/T-bet
and STAT3/NFIL3 pathways, respectively [56]. IL-2,
IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 were also found to induce
Tim-3 expression in human T cells [57]. It was recently reported that the expression of OX40, a vital
regulator of T cell activation, represented the expansion of highly suppressive Tregs in HCC. Xie et al.
[58] showed that high OX40 expression was consistent with high expression of several immune-related
markers, including PD-1, PD-L1, Tim-3, and LAG-3.
TGF-β plays important roles in mediating T cell suppression in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. TGF-βtreated effector memory T cells express high level of
Tim-3 [59]. Upregulation of Tim-3 on TILs was
found in cancer patients under PD-1 blockade treatments. Further studies have demonstrated that Tim-3
upregulation after PD-1 blockade depends on the
PI3K/Akt pathway [60]. 14-3-3ζ protein was reported
to be highly expressed in HCC and to promote the
proliferation and EMT of HCC cells [61]. Recently, it
was found that 14-3-3ζ can be transmitted from HCC
cells to TILs by exosome-mediated delivery [62].
Overexpression of 14-3-3ζ contributes to CD8+ T cell
exhaustion by upregulating PD-1 and Tim-3 expression. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) also regulates
Tim-3 expression. Ji et al. [63] established lncRNA
and mRNA expression profiles of CD3+ T cells from
blood and tissues of HCC patients and healthy volunteers by using high-throughput screening. The results
showed that Lnc-Tim3 was upregulated in HCC patients, and it was negatively correlated with the percentage of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells in tumor-infiltrating
CD8+ T cells. Further experiments showed that LncTim3 bounds to the intracellular domain of Tim-3,
leading to both release and nuclear localization of
Bat3. Nuclear Bat3 further enhances p300/p53/p21-
mediated cell cycle arrest, promoting CD8+T cell exhaustion and survival.
Tim-3 on TAMs is also regulated by cytokines in
TME. Tim-3 expression was in accordance with
macrophage polarization, indicating that the factors
involved in macrophage polarization may affect Tim-3
expression as well on TAMs. Yan et al. [15] revealed
that TGF-β in the HCC microenvironment enhanced
the transcription of Tim-3 in TAMs.
There were few reports of regulation of Tim-3 in
hepatoma cells. As shown above, Tim-3 promotes
tumor growth and regulates EMT of HCC cells. Cytokines that affect HCC biological behaviors may participate in regulation of Tim-3 expression, including
TGF-β. RepSox is a potent, selective TGFβR-1/ALK5
inhibitor [64]. A study in acute myeloid leukemia suggested that RepSox reduced Tim-3 expression by
Liu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2018) 11:126 Page 5 of 12

inhibiting TGF-β signaling [65]. Given the regulation of
Tim-3 on TAMs and the crosstalk between HCC cells
and monocytes, we can also speculate that TGF-β may
be involved in the regulation of Tim-3 in HCC cells.
These results suggest that targeting the regulatory factors of Tim-3 may also be potential strategies in the
Tim-3-based HCC immunotherapy.
New approaches targeting Tim-3
Antibodies targeting Tim-3
In recent years, antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1
axis showed favorable efficacy in several cancer types.
Our laboratory has confirmed the effectiveness of
anti-PD-1 mAb in improving antiviral T cell responses. The CheckMate 040 trial has assessed the
safety and clinical benefits of Nivolumab (an
anti-PD-1 mAb) in patients with advanced HCC,
showing convinced efficacy and fewer side effects.
More than 30 clinical trials on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
and PD-1-activated cytokine-induced killer cells are in
recruitment phases, combining with TACE, radiotherapy, and targeted drugs, among others. However,
there is an increasing incidence of resistance to PD-1/
PD-L1 blockade. Other studies [66] have found that
blockade of PD-1 increased the expression of other
immune checkpoint molecules on tumor-infiltrated
immune cells, including Tim-3, CTLA-4, and LAG-3.
Co-expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells
that accumulate in the TME has been observed in
several tumor types [67, 68], and combined inhibition
of both pathways has a synergistic anti-tumor effect
[66, 69].
We retrieved and summarized patents on Tim-3,
most of which are new designed anti-Tim-3 antibodies, bi-specific antibodies against Tim-3 and PD-1,
and combinations of anti-Tim-3 antibodies and antiPD-1 antibodies. Anti-Tim-3 antibodies have displayed
anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies [29, 34, 42,
70] (Table 3). Anti-Tim3 monotherapy has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression in some tumor
types. Ngiow et al. found that anti-Tim3 antibodies
required the presence of CD4+ T cells and IFNγ-expressing CD8+T cells to trigger anti-tumor immunity [71]. WT3 sarcoma in mice can be inhibited
by anti-Tim3 RMT3-23 at a dose of 250 μg, injected
at days 3 and 11 of WT3 inoculation. This discovery
hinted at the prophylactic and therapeutic activity of
anti-Tim3 RMT3-23 against sarcoma. Anti-Tim3
RMT3-23 exhibited anti-tumor efficiency in mice
bearing MC38 colon adenocarcinoma, CT26 colon
adenocarcinoma, and WTMCA2 fibrosarcoma as well.
Dardalhon’s study showed monotherapeutic efficacy of
anti-Tim-3 5D12 in EL4 lymphoma [72]. However,
anti-Tim3 monotherapy encountered obstacles in

some cancer types, including murine glioma [73],

models [74]. Nevertheless, there is always a way out.
Researchers found the upregulation of other immune
checkpoints after blockade of Tim-3, such as PD-1
[71] and CTLA-4 [60]. Co-expression of Tim-3 and
PD-1 was found to be a biomarker of ICB resistance
[60]. Dual Tim-3 and PD-1 blockade [67, 69] or even
combining anti-Tim-3, anti-PD-1, and anti-CTLA-4
[71] shows synergistic anti-tumor effects in several
cancer types, more effective than any monotherapy.
Co-blockade of TIM-3 and its ligand CEACAM1 also
leads to enhanced anti-tumor immunity and improved
elimination of tumors in mouse colorectal cancer
models [13]. As a member of the TNFR superfamily,
CD137 stimulation in CD8+ T cells promotes their
proliferation, Th1-type cytokine production, and T cell
survival [75]. Guo and colleagues [74] combined
anti-Tim-3 RMT3-23 and CD137 activation mAb
lob12.3 and proved combination of the two synergistically inhibits ID8 ovarian cancer. Anti-Tim-3 in
combination with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
Decitabine has entered a phase I clinical trial. AntiTim-3 also increased efficacy of the chemotherapy
drug cyclophosphamide in a mouse CT26 colon
tumor model [76]. Tim-3 blockade combined with
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improved survival in
glioma-burden mice more than anti-Tim-3 RMT3-23
monotherapy, and the triple therapy with anti-TIM-3,
anti-PD-1, and SRS led to 100% survival [73].
Aptamers binding to Tim-3
Considering that monoclonal antibody production is
troublesome and costly, developing other forms of
inhibitors is an alternative strategy. Aptamers are
single-stranded or peptide molecules that bind to specific target molecules. They undergo selection through
a complex combinatorial process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).
Gefen et al. [77] isolated a nuclease-resistant aptamer
binding to Tim-3 with high affinity and specificity. The
trimer-form ligand efficiently blocks the interaction of
Tim-3 and Gal-9, enhancing the proliferation and
anti-tumor cytokine secretion of Tim-3+T cells. The
anti-tumor effects of Tim-3 aptamer were demonstrated to be superior to anti-Tim-3 monoclonal antibody both in vivo and in vitro. Tim-3 non-antigenic
oligonucleotide aptamer (Tim-3Apt), identified by
Hervas-Stubbs and his team [78], also displayed antagonist capacity on TIM3-expressing lymphocytes by
binding to the extracellular domain of Tim-3 with high
affinity and specificity. Combination of this Tim-3Apt
and PDL1-blockade showed synergistic anti-tumor effects in a mouse colon carcinoma model. Selected
aptamers can be chemically synthesized and exhibit
great malleability, low antigenicity, and high penetration rate when compared with monoclonal antibodies,
making Tim-3Apt a potential substitute for antiTim-3 mAb.
Cellular therapy
Cellular therapy has always been an integral part of cancer therapy. With the maturation of gene editing technology, gene-edited autologous immune cells aid cellular
therapy. Su et al. [79] generated PD-1-disrupted CTL by
the CRISPR-Cas9 system and demonstrated superior
cytotoxicity of these PD-1-disrupted CTLs against
EBV-positive gastric cancer cells. Editing of Tim-3 or
even editing of multi immune checkpoints is also
feasible.
The great breakthrough that chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cells made in blood tumors ignited researchers’
enthusiasm for cellular therapy [80]. Anti-CD19 CAR-T
cells were demonstrated to be effective in the treatment
of B cell leukemia and lymphoma [81]. A growing number of clinical trials of CAR-T cells are being conducted
[82]. The structure of CAR molecule has been optimized
to augment T cell activation and mobilize innate immune cells [83], and the targets of CAR molecules are
being extensively explored. However, the TME presents
barriers to the successful application of CAR-T by inhibiting T cell immunity within tumors including immune
checkpoints [84]. Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells showed excellent anti-tumor immunity both in preclinical experiments [85–87] and in
clinical trials [88], laying the foundation for combination
of ICB and CAR-T technology. PD-1 interference by
anti-PD-1 antibodies, PD-1 shRNAs, or a PD-1 dominant negative receptor breaks the suppression of CAR-T
cells by tumor cells [85]. Gene-edited CAR-T cells were
extensively studied. Suarez et al. [89] generated CAR-T
cells targeting anti-carbonic anhydrase IX and secreting
anti-PD-L1 antibodies, effectively suppressing renal cell
carcinoma in a humanized mouse model. Rupp et al.
[90] developed PD-1-deficient anti-CD19 CAR-T cells by
combining Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (Cas9 RNP)-mediated
PD-1 gene editing and CAR-expressing-lentiviral transduction, showing improved therapeutic efficacy against
leukemia. CAR-T combining disruption of Tim-3 or multi
immune checkpoint molecules is worth trying (Fig. 1).
Anti-GPC3 CAR-T of an alternative CAR targeting molecule suppressed HCC in patient-derived xenograft
models [91]. CAR-T targeting GPC3, AFP, epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD133, and mucin1 has
been included in clinical trials [82].
In summary, targeting Tim-3 with anti-Tim3 agents
(anti-Tim-3 antibodies and Tim-3Apt) and in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, CD137
Liu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2018) 11:126 Page 7 of 12

agonists, and chemotherapy agents and combination
with radiotherapy shows excellent anti-tumor effects
in preclinical studies. These results suggest that targeting molecules involved in Tim-3 signaling with the
above treatment strategies is feasible, including OX40,
TGF-β, IL-2, and other cytokines [92]. Gene-edited
CAR-T cells also make cellular therapy targeting Tim3 possible.
Challenges and prospects
ICB has achieved excellent results in preclinical and
clinical treatment of tumors. However, several challenges
still need to be overcome, including the drug safety,
pharmaceutical technology, and the selection of treatment regimens.
Although Tim-3 is an immune checkpoint molecule,
it is ubiquitously expressed in the human body, unlike
the limited expression of PD-1 on exhausted T cells.
Therefore, systemic application of anti-Tim-3 antibody
may generate more substantial side effects. The safety
and side effects still require plenty of large animal experiments and clinical trials to further examine.
Meanwhile, improving the targeting of anti-Tim-3
antibody is urgently needed. The direct injection of
anti-Tim-3 antibody into tumors is a method to improve targeting, requiring the combination of antiTim-3 antibody with transcatheter arterial embolization
(TAE) or TACE. Bispecific antibodies can bind target
cells and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC), and these two antibodies can be
designated as Tim-3 antibodies and TIL-specific antibodies or tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific antibodies to restore immune cell function or inhibit tumor
cell growth and invasion specifically.
As for the development of the Tim-3 monoclonal
antibody, there may be problems of high immunogenicity, high cost, and limited plasma concentration that
will significantly limit clinical application. These problems could be solved through technology upgrades or
discovering highly specific and efficient Tim-3 inhibitors like Tim-3Apt. To choose appropriate immunotherapy regimens, serial measurements of multiple
checkpoints will be necessary to better understand
the status of the TIME. Studies have revealed that applying targeted drugs to HBV/HCV-related HCC may
cause HBV/HCV activation and hepatitis, further
interrupting the progress of anti-cancer treatment.
Concerning this issue, the combination and timing of
antiviral drugs should be taken into account when
performing ICB therapy in HBV/HCV-related HCC.
Conclusion
Tim-3 is an immune checkpoint molecule that plays
a vital role in the development of HCC. The high expression of Tim-3 in HCC tissues often indicates
poor prognosis. Tim-3 inhibits anti-tumor immunity
Fig. 1 Pattern diagram of gene-edited CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells express CAR molecules against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which mediate
specific localization and elimination of tumor cells by interacting with the TAA expressing on tumor cell surface. HCC cells are able to express
ligands of immune checkpoints. The interaction of immune checkpoints and ligands leads to T cell exhaustion and apoptosis, which induces
dysfunction and apoptosis of CAR-T cells as well. The immune checkpoint molecules on gene-edited CAR-T cells can be knocked out with
CRISPR/cas9 system, which enables the gene-edited CAR-T cells to specifically recognize HCC cells, conduct anti-tumor responses, and avoid CART cell exhaustion due to immune checkpoint pathways
Liu et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2018) 11:126 Page 8 of 12

through mediating effector T cell exhaustion and apoptosis, enhancing Treg-mediated immunity suppression,
and facilitating TAMs M2 polarization. Tim-3 on HCC
cells also promotes HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion in an IL-6 autocrine manner (Fig. 2). Targeting
Tim-3 shows anti-tumor efficiency in preclinical studies.
The combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, CD137 agonists, and chemotherapy agents and combination with radiotherapy shows synergistic anti-tumor
effects in tumor mouse models. Antibodies, aptamers, and
gene-edited immune cells targeting Tim-3 and related
pathways are research directions with great potential.
Therefore, Tim-3 has excellent development prospects for
the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.

Fig. 2 Regulation and functions of Tim-3 in HCC. Cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, IL-17, TGF-β, and tumor-derived exosomes induce Tim-3
expression in T cells. Tim-3+ T cells present exhaustion phenotypes and reduced production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, indicating impaired antitumor immunity. Binding of Gal-9 to Tim-3+ effector T cells further mediates effector T cell apoptosis. Tim-3+ Tregs exert greater suppressor
functions, producing reduced IFN-γ and IL-2 as well. Gal-9-expressing cells, including TAMs and DCs, are involved in the interaction of Gal-9 with
Tim-3, further leading to Tim-3+ T cell exhaustion and apoptosis. HCC-derived TGF-β upregulates Tim-3 expression on TAMs and Tim-3 overexpression
then facilitates M2 polarization of TAMs, further promoting HCC growth, migration, and invasion by the IL-6 pathway. Tim-3 on HCC cells promotes
HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion in an IL-6 autocrine manner
