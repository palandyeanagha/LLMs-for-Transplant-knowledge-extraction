term to dramatically reduce the high 
incidence of HPAI in Bangladesh. We 
have progressively and dramatically 
increased the scope and benefi ts of our 
pilot PVC implementation program, 
but additional work is needed. To 
help spread PVC approaches throughout the country, community leaders, 
imams of local mosques, and school 
teachers can be trained to implement 
awareness programs on safe practices 
for raising poultry and regular cleaning and disinfection of live bird markets. The strengthening of biosecurity 
measures will help control the spread 
of HPAI virus and other zoonotic 
diseases.

Hepatitis E 
Virus Genotype 3 
in Shellfi sh, 
United Kingdom
To the Editor: Bivalve mollusks 
(shellfi sh), such as mussels and 
oysters, are fi lter feeders; they 
concentrate microorganisms of human 
and animal origin (up to 100×) from 
the surrounding environment. Several 
recent reports have linked the incidence 
of human infection with hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) to consumption of 
undercooked pork, game products, 
and shellfi sh (1,2). Infectious HEV 
has been found in swine manure and 
wastewater (3); therefore, application 
of manure to land and subsequent 
runoff could contaminate coastal 
water, leading to contamination of 
shellfi sh and, subsequently, possible 
human infection. Because they are 
fi lter feeders, bivalve mollusks are 
biologically relevant sentinels and 
can indicate potential pathogens that 
are contaminating the environment. 
It is essential to ensure that this 
sustainable resource of coastal areas, 
where mussels and oysters are farmed 
or collected wild, is not subjected to 
environmental contamination that 
could lead to public health risks.
Risk management for bivalve 
mollusks, aimed at control of fecal 
pollution, relies heavily on the use 
of Escherichia coli as an indicator 
of fecal (sewage) contamination 
and is enacted under European food 
regulations (Regulation 854/2004, 
www.cefas.co.uk/media/455777/
extract_reg_no_854_2004.pdf). 
However, although these regulations 
probably reduce the number of 
infections, especially bacterial 
infections, they are not viewed as 
adequately controlling the risk for 
viral infections. Specifi c risks are 
posed by the robustness of viruses 
in the environment and the different 
behavior of viruses within bivalve 
mollusks compared with behavior 
within bacterial fecal indicators. 
HEV is deemed to be inactivated 
during processing procedures used 
to prepare mussels for consumption; 
however, HEV is only 50% inactivated 
at 56°C and 96% at 60°C for 1 
hour, it is stable when exposed to 
trifl uorotrichloroethane, and it is 
resistant to inactivation by acidic and 
alkaline conditions (4). Most shellfi sh 
are usually eaten raw, but viable virus 
can also pose a risk to public health 
in shellfi sh that are lightly steamed 
or preserved by smoking and/or in 
acetic acid. Indeed, a recent study by 
the Food Standards Agency, in which 
>800 oyster samples from 39 growing 
beds in the United Kingdom were 
collected and screened during 2009–
2011, found norovirus at low levels 
in at least 76% of oysters (5). Other 
studies identifi ed hepatitis A virus 
and norovirus in shellfi sh production 
areas and in ready-to-eat products in 
the United Kingdom (1,6). In fact,

depuration experiments demonstrated 
no decrease in titers against hepatitis 
A virus over a 23-hour cleansing 
period (7). In addition, acute HEV 
infection attributed to consumption 
of shellfi sh was diagnosed for 33 
passengers who recently returned from 
a cruise (2). However, data have been 
restricted to questionnaires implicating 
consumption of shellfi sh as a source of 
transmission; no follow-up analyses of 
the contaminated foodstuff have been 
conducted. Thus, possible transmission 
routes for HEV remain poorly studied 
in the United Kingdom (2).
To determine whether HEV is 
present in mussels collected locally 
for human consumption, we examined 
48 mussels from 5 tidal locations in 
Scotland. We collected closed mussels 
from the west coast of Scotland (11 at 
Lunderston Bay and 28 at Ardrossan) 
and the east coast of Scotland (9 
at Stannergate, Dundee; Ferryden, 
Montrose; and the Ythan Estuary at 
Newburgh). 
The site at Ardrossan was near a 
slaughterhouse and a meat preparation 
purifi cation plant that processes pigs. 
The plant was considered a potential 
source of contamination, and mussels 
were collected in a 10-m2
 area around 
an outfall (drain/sewage pipe) directly 
in line with the processing plant.
A total of 36 (92%) of the 39 
mussels from the west coast were 
positive by PCR for HEV, and 5 (55%) 
of the 9 from the east coast were 
positive. The mean value of HEV 
RNA detected in the samples was 
4.25 log10 IU/mL (range 3.73–5.2 log10 
IU/mL), and the assay was validated 
by using the current candidate HEV 
World Health Organization standard 
(http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2011/
WHO_BS_2011.2175_eng.pdf). 
Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
most bivalve mollusk sequences 
clustered with HEV genotype 3 from 
humans and swine (Figure; online 
Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.
gov/EID/pdfs/12-0924-Techapp.
pdf). Also, HEV sequences isolated 
specifi cally from a UK human 
source corresponded with sequences 
isolated from the bivalve mollusks. 
The presence of a swine-like HEV 
genotype 3 in freshwater bivalve 
mollusks has also been reported in 
Japan and South Korea (1,9). 
Worldwide, an estimated 40,000 
persons die and another 40,000 
experience long-term disability 
as a result of consuming raw or 
undercooked shellfi sh (10). This study, 
demonstrating the presence of HEV in 
mussels collected locally in Scotland 
for human consumption, raises 
concern as to whether these shellfi sh 
are a potential source of infection, as 
reported (2). The association between 
environmental contamination with 
HEV and possible transmission by 
eating shellfi sh warrants investigation.

Autochthonous 
Gnathostomiasis, 
Brazil
To the Editor: Gnathostomiasis 
is an infestation by nematodes of 
the genus Gnathostoma; the main 
source of infection is raw freshwater 
fi sh. In the past, gnathostomiasis was 
regarded as restricted to certain Asian 
and Central American countries, but 
increase of migratory fl ux and changes 
in alimentary habits have contributed 
to importing cases into areas where 
the disease is not endemic (1,2). 
We report a case of autochthonous 
gnasthostomiasis in Brazil.
A 37-year-old man from Rio de 
Janeiro sought medical attention in 
2005 because of low fever, cough, 
abdominal tenderness, and pain in 
the left shoulder. The symptoms 
started 15 days after a recreational 
trip to Tocantins, where he practiced 
sport fi shing and ate sashimistyle freshwater raw fi sh (Cichla
sp.) that had just been caught. He 
reported no history of traveling to a 
gnathostomiasis-endemic area. Initial 
work-up depicted eosinophilia (43%), 
and a computed tomographic scan of 
the chest revealed left pleural effusion. 
Two weeks later, winding, linear, 
reddish lesions appeared on his back, 
which lasted 3 days (Figure, panel 
A). Serologic testing for Schistosoma 
mansoni was weakly positive. Acute 
schistosomiasis was diagnosed, and 
treatment with praziquantel was 
begun. In 4 weeks, all symptoms 
faded.
In 2009, the patient took 
albendazol for helminthic 
prophylaxis, and 3 weeks later, deep 
migratory, swelling, reddish nodules 
occurred on the thorax; each lesion 
lasted ≈6 days, and new lesions 
appeared at intervals of 1–5 days 
in a somewhat linear array (Figure, 
panel B). By this time, hemograms 
displayed eosinophilia of 25%, but 
a computed tomographic scan of 
the chest showed no abnormalities. 
Results of a complete ophthalmologic 
examination were unremarkable, and 
a fecal examination was negative 
for parasites. Gnathostomiasis 
was highly suspected on the basis 
of the clinical and epidemiologic 
fi ndings and results of skin biopsies. 
Histopathologic examination revealed a dense superfi cial and deep 
dermal infi ltrate of eosinophils and 
neutrophils but did not show the 
parasite. Two samples of plasma were 
sent to Thailand for immunoblot in 
search of the diagnostic band (24-kDa 
antigen) of Gnathostoma spinigerum, 
resulting in high titers. Albendazol, 
800 mg/day for 21 days, and a 
single dose of ivermectin, 0.2 mg/
kg, were administered and, despite 
initial improvement, the disease 
relapsed, requiring a second cycle of 
the medications. No signs of disease 
occurred during 2 years of follow-up.
Gnathostomiasis is found 
mostly in Japan and Thailand. In the 
Americas, most cases occur in Mexico
