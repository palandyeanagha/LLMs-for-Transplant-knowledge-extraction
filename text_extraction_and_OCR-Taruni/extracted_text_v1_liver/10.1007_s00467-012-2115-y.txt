Abstract
Background Pre-transplant nephrectomy is performed to
reduce risks to graft and recipient. The aims of this study
were to evaluate (1) indications, surgical approach, and
morbidity of native nephrectomy and (2) the effects of
kidney removal on clinical and biological parameters.
Methods This study was designed as a single-center retrospective cohort study in which 49 consecutive patients with
uni- or bilateral native nephrectomies were identified from a
total of 126 consecutive graft recipients in our pediatric
kidney transplantation database between 1992 and 2011.
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory details were extracted
from charts and electronic records, including operation
reports and pre- and post-operative clinic notes.
Results Of the 49 nephrectomized patients, 47% had
anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, 22% had cystinosis, 12% had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and 6%
had congenital nephrotic syndrome. Nephrectomy decisions
were based on clinical judgment, taking physiological and
psychosocial aspects into consideration. Nephrectomy was
performed in patients with polyuria (>2.5 ml/kg/h) and/or
large proteinuria (>40 mg/m2
/h), recurrent urinary tract infection or (rarely) hypertension. Urine output decreased
from (median) 3.79 to 2.32 ml/kg/h (−34%), and proteinuria
from 157 to 100 mg/m2
/h (−40%) after unilateral nephrectomy (p00.005). After bilateral nephrectomy, serum albumin, protein and fibrinogen concentrations normalized in
93, 73, and 55% of nephrectomized patients, respectively.
Clinically relevant procedure-related complications (peritoneal laceration, hematoma) occurred in five patients.
Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate quantitatively that
native nephrectomy prior to transplantation improved serum
protein levels and anticipated post-transplant fluid intake
needs in select children, reducing the risk of graft hypoperfusion and its postulated consequences for graft outcome.

are not well defined. Malfunctioning kidneys are removed if
they are perceived to convey short- or long-term risks to the
KT recipient or the graft. The spectrum of renal and urinary
tract disorders leading to ESRD differs between adults and
children. In addition, the removal of the native kidney(s) in
young children and infants prior to transplantation entails specific clinical challenges related to fluid management and nutrition. Hence, indications for pre-transplant nephrectomy are
expected to vary between the adult and pediatric patient groups.
Studies on the biological effects of nephrectomy are limited,
and outcome data are needed for informed decision-making.
The removal of endstage kidneys has been advocated for
patients with large proteinuria, refractory hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) or urosepsis, urolithiasis,
and polyuria [1, 2]. Heavy proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia
are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolic events [3–5]. Disturbed hemostasis in nephrotic
syndrome is thought to be caused by the loss of select coagulation factors in the urine, by unregulated protein and lipid
production and by endothelial injury [3, 6–8]. Removing the
native kidney(s) in nephrotic patients is expected to reduce the
risk of acute graft thrombosis, intravascular volume depletion,
nutritional deficit, and delayed wound healing [9].
There is minimal quantitative data on the effect of residual native kidney urine output and post-KT graft function in
children [10, 11], and the few publications available on
adults report conflicting results [12, 13]. Case reports [14]
and anecdotal experience suggest that pediatric patients with
polyuria due to tubular disorders or renal dysplasia may
continue to have substantial native urine output for prolonged
periods after transplantation. Large native urine output posttransplant can lead to extracellular volume depletion and
hypoperfusion of the graft and may exacerbate the perfusion
mismatch between small recipients and adult donors. Chronic
graft hypoperfusion may be associated with an important—
according to some studies, irreversible—drop in glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) and accelerated fibrosis, particularly in
the smallest renal transplant recipients [10, 15–19]. Volume
depletion and renal hypoperfusion can exacerbate drug (e.g.
cyclosporine) nephrotoxicity [20, 21] and further imperil the
perfusion of adult-size grafts in young recipients. These considerations provide the rationale to optimize the conditions for
post-transplant fluid management, including the removal of
one or both kidneys.
In the absence of prospective data or evidence-based
guidelines, we reviewed our pediatric experience of pretransplant nephrectomies. The aims of this study were (1)
to examine indications, surgical approach, and complications of native nephrectomies prior to transplantation and
(2) to determine the effects of uni- and bilateral nephrectomy on selected biological and clinical parameters, specifically urine volume and protein loss (where applicable) and
serum protein concentrations.
Material and methods
Study design
The study was designed as a single-center retrospective cohort
study. We identified consecutive patients with uni- or bilateral
native nephrectomies from a total of 126 consecutive graft
recipients in our pediatric KT database. For reasons of data
availability, we limited our review to patients who received a
graft between December 1992 and October 2011 (18.9 years)
(Fig. 1). The study was conducted in accordance with institutional ethics regulations; since it was a retrospective chart
analysis, no informed consent was required. Demographic,
clinical, and laboratory details, including serum creatinine,
albumin, total protein and fibrinogen concentrations, UTIs
and imaging, blood pressure, urine volume, and 24-h protein
excretion pre- and post-surgery were extracted from charts
and electronic records, including operation reports and preand post-operative clinic notes.
Patients and surgical procedures
We identified 49 transplant recipients with uni- or bilateral
nephrectomy (80 removed kidneys). Three patients who had

undergone unilateral removal of poorly functioning kidneys
due to lower urinary tract abnormalities at 4.7, 5.7, and
18 years prior to KT were excluded from the analysis
(Fig. 1). With few exceptions [congenital nephrotic syndrome, Wilms tumor (WT), or Denys–Drash syndrome
(DDS)], all patients had endstage renal disease at the time
of pretransplant nephrectomy. Most patients were followed
pre-operatively by the pediatric nephrology and (in part) the
urology team at this institution. Ten patients have been
described in a recent publication evaluating our experience
with retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) in children
receiving peritoneal dialysis [22]. The decision to remove
one or both kidneys, concurrently or sequentially, depended
on the diagnosis and the perceived benefit, such as preservation of some urine output during dialysis, and was based
on consensus among the team of nephrologists and surgeons. Clinical judgment and psychosocial considerations,
including the recipient’s age-related maturity, ability or willingness to cope with large volume fluid intake post-KT and
overall medical adherence figured importantly as measurable (objective) parameters. The operative approach was at
the discretion of the responsible surgeon.
Clinical definitions
In the absence of a generally accepted definition, we specified polyuria for this review as a sustained urine output of
>2.5 ml/kg/h. Proteinuria was defined as >4 mg urine protein/m2 per hour and large (nephrotic range) proteinuria as
>40 mg/m2 per hour [23]. To assess the effect of (unilateral)
kidney removal on urine output and proteinuria, we chose
timed urine collection(s) closest to the procedure, generally
<2 months pre- and post-nephrectomy. Measurements during the first 2 weeks post-nephrectomy were omitted from
analysis to avoid confounding effects of perioperative fluid
administration or dialysis adjustments. Charts were
reviewed for the incidence of UTI at least 1 year prior to
nephrectomy (median 2.8 years), between nephrectomy and
KT, and ≥24 months after KT. Recurrent UTIs were defined
as ≥2 documented infections within a 12-month period [24].
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as median and range unless noted
otherwise. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables, and non-parametric (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signedranks and Mann–Whitney U) tests for continuous variables.
Linear regression was used to assess longitudinal changes in
urine output and biochemical results pre- and postnephrectomy. Assumptions of a normal distribution of residuals, as well as a lack of heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity
and non-linearity were satisfied (data not shown). A critical p
value of 0.05 was used. The Bonferroni correction was
applied in cases of multiple testing. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata v.10.1 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX).
Results
Demographics, etiology of ESRD, and timing
of nephrectomy
Of 126 pediatric renal transplant recipients who received a
graft during the reviewed period, 49 patients (39%) underwent uni- or bilateral native nephrectomies (80 kidneys;
Fig. 1). The median age at transplantation in the nephrectomized study cohort was 9.4 years (range 2.0–19.5 years).
The main diagnoses leading to ESRD and nephrectomy
were congenital (anatomical) anomalies of the kidney and
urinary tract (CAKUT), nephropathic cystinosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and congenital nephrotic
syndrome (CNS) (Table 1). Histopathological reports were
available for 21 CAKUT patients, with evidence of renal
dysplasia in 71% of these.
Thirty-four patients (69%) of the cohort commenced
dialysis prior to, and 11 (23%) at the time of nephrectomy.
Four patients (8%) were transplanted preemptively, before
initiating dialysis: two of these were unilaterally nephrectomized 1–2 weeks prior to KT and two at transplantation.
Of the patients with nephrectomy prior to KT, 51% received
or intended to start peritoneal dialysis (PD), the remainder
hemodialysis (HD).
Native nephrectomies were performed a median of 1.9 months
(range 0–41.4 months) prior to transplantation (Table 1); 53%
of the children had a living related donor graft, and the
remainder received a graft from a deceased donor, almost
exclusively adult.
Indications for nephrectomy
Measurable parameters influencing the decision for native
nephrectomy included polyuria, large proteinuria, and recurrent UTI. Of a total of 22 patients with polyuria as an
indication for nephrectomy, 45% underwent unilateral nephrectomy, and the remainder underwent bilateral synchronous (18%) or staged nephrectomy (37%). The majority of
patients with polyuria had CAKUT or cystinosis (45%
each). The diagnoses associated with large proteinuria and
nephrectomy (n022) were glomerular diseases (FSGS,
CNS, and Denys–Drash syndrome; 50%), cystinosis
(32%), CAKUT (14%), and chronic interstitial nephritis
(4%). In this cohort, 82% of children with glomerular disease, 61% of those with CAKUT, and 45% with cystinosis
underwent bilateral nephrectomy (Table 1).

Surgical procedures
Eighteen patients (37%) underwent unilateral nephrectomy, 12 on the left side, this allowed for removal of the
right kidney at the time of KT, if needed, which is the
preferred side for the future graft. Two-thirds of the
patients had both kidneys removed: 17 in a single
(synchronous) operation, the remaining 14 sequentially. In
ten patients the nephrectomy was performed at the time of
transplantation, and two patients underwent native ureteronephrectomy 4 and 19 months post-transplant, respectively,
for frequent UTIs attributed to the residual native unit (Fig. 1).
Of the patients for whom we had access to detailed
surgical information, 31 organs were removed by minimally
invasive surgery [transperitoneal, 5 kidneys; retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN), 26 kidneys; total number of
procedures, 24], and 36 by open surgery (transperitoneal,
7; extraperitoneal, 29; total number of procedures, 30).
Thirty-eight percent of nephrectomies were combined with
additional procedures, such as HD or PD catheter placement, cystoplasty or KT. Of the remaining patients, the
median operation time was 3.0 h for unilateral and 7.2 h
for synchronous bilateral procedures (p<0.0001, Mann–
Whitney U test). The duration of open versus minimally
invasive surgery was 3.0 versus 5.2 h (p00.02). After stratification for the removal of one or both kidneys, the difference between open versus minimally invasive surgery time
remained statistically significant for bilateral synchronous
procedures (p00.002), but not for unilateral ones (p00.39,
Mann–Whitney U test). These times reflect substantial trainee
involvement.
Effect of nephrectomy on urine output
The median daily urine output of 15 patients with polyuria
who underwent unilateral nephrectomy (including the first of
staged nephrectomies) decreased from 2.1 l (3.91 ml/kg/h) to
1.4 l (2.39 ml/kg/h; median change −40%; p<0.005). The
percentage post-operative reduction in urine output was not
related to the amount of pre-operative polyuria (p00.73; linear
regression r
2
00.30). Changes in urine output according to
nephrectomy procedure are summarized in Table 2.
We tested the possibility that urine output of ESRD
patients further declined after unilateral nephrectomy towards the time of KT. Adequate urine collections were
available from four patients covering an observation period of 4.0–13.7 months. Median urine output declined by
36% (range −10 to −70%), corresponding to a decrease of
0.24 ml/kg/h per month (Fig. 2). In contrast, prenephrectomy urine production in these subjects had been
relatively stable over 1–3 years, after initiation of dialysis
(results not shown).
Effect of nephrectomy on proteinuria and plasma proteins
Twenty-two patients with large proteinuria (with or without
polyuria or frequent UTI) underwent nephrectomy. After
unilateral nephrectomy (including the first of sequential
nephrectomies), urine protein excretion decreased by a median of 35%, from 3.7 to 2.4 g per 24 h (158 to 102 mg/m2
/h)
(p00.01, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). Total serum protein,
albumin, and fibrinogen concentrations were within reference
ranges in 64, 69, and 36% of patients, respectively, prior to
nephrectomy and increased modestly after the removal of one
kidney, accompanied by a decrease of fibrinogen concentrations. Details are shown in Table 3.
Patients scheduled for bilateral nephrectomy demonstrated greater pre-nephrectomy urine protein excretion
than patients undergoing unilateral nephrectomy. Two of
these patients also had polyuria. Unilaterally and bilaterally
nephrectomized patients also differed with respect to their
pre-operative serum albumin and protein levels (Fig. 3a,
b). Within 2 months post surgery, initially low albumin and
total serum protein concentrations in patients undergoing
bilateral nephrectomy increased by 33 and 17%, respectively, while previously elevated fibrinogen concentrations decreased by 42% to almost normal levels (all p<
0.01) (Table 3).
Normal serum albumin, protein, and fibrinogen concentrations were recorded in 93, 73, and 55%, respectively, of
bilaterally nephrectomized children with prior nephrotic
range proteinuria, measured within 2 weeks to 2 months
post-nephrectomy.
Recurrent UTIs
To ascertain whether native nephrectomy led to the intended
reduction of UTI rates, we analyzed nine patients who had
undergone nephrectomy for recurrent UTI and for whom
data were available (3 unilateral and 6 bilateral nephrectomies). Three of the patients were nephrectomized at or after
KT, and for one of these patients there was insufficient postoperative information. Four of the five remaining patients
had no more UTIs between nephrectomy and KT, and one
had a single infection (observation period 1.1 years, range
0.1–2 years). Post-KT, three of the nine patients remained
free of UTIs during 2 years of observation (range 0.3–
4.8 years), and six patients had at least one recurrence of
UTI (median 3.0 UTIs per person-year, range 0.2–24.4
UTIs). All six patients had persistent UTI risks, such as
VACTERL sequence, posterior urethral valve bladder, cystoplasty, and intermittent catheterizations, not all of which
are amenable to surgical correction. However, two of the
latter patients underwent successful post-KT native nephrectomy, reducing the infection rate from 8.8 and 4.0 per year,
respectively, to <0.34 per year.

Hypertension
Persistent arterial hypertension (in addition to large proteinuria) was the indication for bilateral nephrectomy in a patient with FSGS. A second patient with dysplastic kidneys
underwent bilateral renal embolization for hypertension and
subsequently bilateral nephrectomy prior to his referral to
our center. Post-nephrectomy blood pressure control improved in both patients and resulted in the reduction of the
number of antihypertensive drugs from four to two and from
two to zero, respectively.
Nephrectomy-related complications
Clinically important, procedure-related complications were
noted in five patients undergoing nephrectomy prior to KT
for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD;
n01 patient), DDS/WT (2), and cystinosis with polyuria or
polyuria and large proteinuria (2). Peritoneal tears occurred
in 4/20 “at-risk” patients, i.e., children receiving or planning
to initiate PD, including 3/10 patients undergoing open
retroperitoneal nephrectomy [n013 surgeries (removal of

and repair of bilateral hydroceles] and 1/10 patients undergoing bilateral synchronous RPN (11 surgeries, 14 kidneys).
All four patients required temporary HD. The fifth patient
experienced a retroperitoneal hematoma following open,
extraperitoneal nephrectomy, which required transfusions
of packed red blood cells and fresh plasma.
Minor complications related to the anesthesia or surgical
technique were partial lung atelectasis (n 03) and
retroperitoneoscopy-associated (expected) transient subcutaneous emphysema (n02). Loss of urine output due to bilateral
nephrectomy resulted in fluid overload and/or volumemediated hypertension in five patients with ARPKD (n01)
and FSGS (n04). They were managed medically by intensified dialysis.
Discussion
Indications for peritransplant nephrectomy are controversial,
and clinical practice varies according to perceived risks and
benefits. The purpose of this study was to review our pediatric
experience and to evaluate the biological effects of uni- and
bilateral nephrectomy, specifically on urine output and proteinuria, where applicable, and serum proteins. We commonly
base nephrectomy decisions on physiological, clinical and
psychosocial determinants, with the goal to optimize the conditions for favorable graft outcome. Physiological risk factors
are those compromising volume status and the perfusion of
the (adult) graft in the pediatric recipient [10, 16, 19]. Clinical
arguments include risks for graft and recipient due to UTI/

urosepsis or persistent, severe arterial hypertension. Important
psychosocial factors are the predicted inability or stated unwillingness to comply with increased post-transplant fluid
intake, particularly among children and teenagers.
Our report represents the largest pediatric cohort examining clinical and biological effects of pre-transplant nephrectomies. Most prior publications have described
indications and surgical outcomes in adult patients
[25–30]. In addition to technical reports, we identified only
two case series mentioning the inclusion of children: In the
first study of 36 patients aged 10–67 years [28], eight
nephrectomized patients were compared with 28 patients
after ureteral reimplantation or no surgery prior to KT. The
authors found no difference in the rate of UTIs between
nephrectomized and non-nephrectomized recipients, but the
numbers were small and children were not analyzed separately [28]. The second study [29] comprised 62 patients,
including 11 children (14 nephrectomies). Pediatric indications were UTI (n09) or large proteinuria (n02), compared
with hypertension, UTI, lithiasis, renal carcinoma, and polycystic kidney disease in the adult patients [29].
In our study, we did not intend to evaluate whether nephrectomy improves transplant outcome or graft and patient
survival. The novelty of this report is that it describes the
effects of native nephrectomy on urine volume, proteinuria,
and serum proteins. Indeed, there are no data in the literature
to quantify these biological effects. Our findings may help
inform future decision-making. The renal diagnoses of the
nephrectomized cohort are similar to those of contemporary,
non-nephrectomized graft recipients transplanted in our center,
with the exception of nephrotic syndrome patients. This further
suggests that nephrectomy decisions were individualized, i.e.
based on psychosocial factors and clinical judgment, and not
(just) on the 24-h urine collection.
The decision to render young ESRD patients with preserved urine output anuric is not trivial. Where possible, the
second (staged) nephrectomy was delayed to the time of KT
to allow the advantage of residual urine production [31, 32]
and to avoid additional surgeries and anesthesia. Removing
the second kidney at the time of KT may circumvent this
problem, but prolongs transplant surgery. It has been argued
that patients may benefit from residual urine output and

metabolic renal activity should they return to dialysis in case
of early graft failure [33]. However, we did not encounter this
scenario in our cohort.
Patients undergoing nephrectomy risk peritoneal laceration
in addition to potential surgery and anesthesia complications.
In our cohort, clinically important, procedure-related adverse
events were documented in five patients, mainly peritoneal
leaks that required temporary HD instead of the planned
initiation or continuation of PD. Few patients experienced
fluid overload and hypertension post-operatively, which is
an expected outcome in patients rendered anuric. Interestingly,
most of the latter patients had been nephrectomized for FSGS
and persistent nephrotic syndrome. All responded well to
medical management.
Compared to conventional, open nephrectomy, minimally
invasive surgery shortened recovery and hospitalization times.
Transperitoneal (open or laparoscopic) techniques would require switching from PD to (at least temporary) HD postnephrectomy. The retroperitoneoscopic approach [34] preserved peritoneal integrity in 11 of 12 procedures. Three of
ten patients undergoing open retroperitoneal nephrectomies
suffered peritoneal laceration, but these procedures were all
performed during the first half of the review period.
Our rationale for nephrectomy in children with polyuria
was twofold: to reduce the risk of graft injury due to hypoperfusion and to alleviate the difficulty of maintaining high
post-KT fluid intake. Hypoperfusion of the graft may have
acute (tubular necrosis, graft thrombosis) and long-term consequences (accelerated chronic graft fibrosis) [9, 16, 19, 35].
Studying hemodynamic changes induced by the transplantation of adult-sized kidneys into young recipients, Salvatierra
and his group reported that the blood flow in the transplanted
renal artery diminished by one-half compared to the original
measurements in the living donor and concluded that aggressive intravascular volume replacement is necessary to achieve
and maintain optimal aortic (and renal arterial) blood flow
following renal transplantation [16]. Berg et al. and others have
shown that children receiving kidneys from pediatric donors
revealed increasing absolute and stable relative GFR compared
with those receiving adult kidneys [10, 18, 36]. By careful

histological comparison of protocol biopsies, Naesen et al. [19]
found functionally relevant, progressive non-immune graft
injury in pediatric recipients soon after the transplant of
adult-size kidneys. They postulated that graft ischemia associated with donor-recipient size discrepancy is a major risk factor
for chronic tubulo-interstitial damage. The same group provided molecular evidence, employing cDNA microarray techniques, that early graft hypoperfusion induces the coordinated
expression of profibrotic genes in the graft. Interestingly, gene
activation was evident before any histological appearance of
fibrosis [37]. These findings are relevant to our subjects who
received almost exclusively adult donor kidneys.
Large proteinuria is believed to increase the risk of graft
and extrarenal venous thrombosis due to the imbalance of
pro- and antithrombotic factors [3, 5, 38], compounded by
transplant-associated endothelial injury [39–41]. There is
little doubt that persistent, severe nephrotic syndrome poses
short- and long-term risks for the transplant recipient [40].
We have demonstrated that patients with compensated
large proteinuria, but only mildly decreased serum albumin concentrations, experienced a modest rise of serum
proteins after unilateral nephrectomy. Bilateral nephrectomy, on the other hand, fully corrected albumin, total
protein and fibrinogen concentrations in the majority of
previously hypoalbuminemic patients (see Fig. 3 and
Results section).
It is of note that not all patients with recurrent UTI
benefitted from pre-KT nephrectomy. This was likely due
to variability in the underlying anatomical/developmental
abnormalities affecting the lower urinary tract and bladder.
Conclusion
The indication for pre-transplant native nephrectomy in our
cohort was based on a combination of physiological, clinical,
and psychosocial considerations. Unilateral nephrectomy
reduced polyuria in all patients, by a median of 34%,
and proteinuria by 40%, while bilateral (synchronous or
staged) nephrectomy improved serum total protein, albumin
and fibrinogen concentrations significantly by 17–42%. The
main risk of the procedure is peritoneal laceration with
temporary interruption of peritoneal dialysis. Proof that
nephrectomy ameliorates graft fibrosis and long-term
outcome in select patients would require a prospective,
randomized, and controlled trial.
