Abstract
Liver fibrosis is not an independent disease. It refers to the
abnormal proliferation of connective tissues in the liver
caused by various pathogenic factors. Thus far, liver fibrosis
has been considered to be associated with a set of factors,
such as viral infection, alcohol abuse, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, as well as genetic diseases. To date, clinical therapeutics for liver fibrosis still face
challenges, as elimination of potential causes and conventional antifibrotic drugs cannot alleviate fibrosis in most
patients. Recently, potential therapeutic targets of liver
fibrosis, such as metabolism, inflammation, cell death and
the extracellular matrix, have been explored through basic
and clinical research. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to
review the antihepatic fibrosis therapeutics for treatment of
liver fibrosis in current clinical trials.

Introduction
Hepatic fibrosis, a reversible response to various chronic liver
injuries, may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma
and liver failure. Cirrhosis is the common end-stage of a
series of chronic liver diseases and can be divided according
to its compensated and decompensated states. A series of
complications of cirrhosis (such as portal hypertension,
infection, ascites, and esophageal bleeding) are associated
with significant morbidity and mortality.
The mechanism involved in the progression and reversal of
liver fibrosis is still not clear. Up to now, alcohol, hepatocyte
lipid deposition, and insulin resistance (IR) are recognized to
be the major risk factors in patients with chronic hepatitis.
Besides, intrahepatic oxidative stress, viral and schistosomiasis infection, hepatic sinus microcirculation disturbance,
and microbiota dysbiosis also participate in the occurrence
and development of liver fibrosis.1
Current therapies for liver fibrosis encompass two aspects:
etiology treatments and antifibrotic therapeutics. Removal of
underlying etiology of liver injury makes liver fibrosis reversible. However, up to now, there is lack of cause-specific
treatment for certain liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cholestatic liver diseases (CLDs),
and some genetic liver diseases. Therefore, there remains a
need to develop direct antifibrotic therapies for liver fibrosis.
Over the past several decades, many researchers have
proposed potential targets and alternative therapies for liver
cirrhosis. Unfortunately, there is no effective antifibrotic drug
approved for human use, up to now. This review will focus on
the representative drugs for liver fibrosis in clinical trials.
Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis
Fibrosis in epithelial organs is produced by the reticular
deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and chronic inflammation, accompanied by compromised immune systems and
pathological angiogenesis. Liver fibrosis is an abnormal
perpetuation of fibrogenesis due to various constant chronic
liver injuries. Apoptosis of liver parenchymal cells and continuous accumulation of ECM gradually replace the liver
parenchyma with scar tissue, eventually forming liver architectural distortion, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer,
and liver failure.2
As illustrated in Fig. 1, activation of hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs) is well established as the central driver of hepatic fibrosis. HSCs are derived from embryonic mesothelial cells.
Quiescent HSCs mainly store vitamin A and produce type IV
collagen, while activated HSCs produce collagen type I, III
and other proteins (fibronectin, elastin, laminin) after liver
injuries. In addition, activated HSCs exhibit a developed proliferative phenotype and contractile function. Abundant ECM
deposition and collagen production result in the increase of
liver stiffness, thereby stimulating the activation of HSCs and
forming a positive feedback loop to develop cirrhosis.3,4
Besides HSCs, other liver cells also contribute to matrix
protein production. Hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells,
and lymphocytes are involved in the development of liver
fibrosis through releasing cell contents and cytokines.1 Macrophages in the liver comprise Kupffer cells and monocytederived macrophages, and the latter stimulates HSCs to
become collagen-producing myofibroblasts.5
Compelling evidence from animal models indicates that
liver fibrosis is reversible. Firstly, modifications in ECM
composition may regulate cellular functions partly through

cell adhesion molecules and participate in the regression of
fibrosis.1,6,7 Secondly, cell death not only induces inflammation and promotes fibrogenesis but may also contribute to
fibrosis resolution through influencing the apoptosis and senescence of activated HSCs.6 Lastly, infiltrating macrophages
play a detrimental role in liver fibrosis. Infiltrating macrophages have shown profibrogenic and proinflammatory features in the progression of fibrosis. However, in a murine
model of hepatic fibrosis, the increased restorative macrophages are associated with the accelerated resolution of fibrosis.8 Overall, the resolution of liver fibrosis is also a complex
process.
Cause-specific treatments for liver fibrosis
Currently, the most important treatment is controlling the
underlying cause of the liver diseases. These include effective
suppression or elimination of hepatitis virus replication (hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus), drug eradication of
schistosomiasis, relieving cholestasis, reduction of body
weight in NAFLD, improvement of associated metabolic disorders, cessation of alcohol use in patients with alcoholic liver
disease (ALD), phlebotomy in hemochromatosis, and use of
corticosteroids/immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver
disease. All these therapies can reduce persistent hepatic
injury, thereby inhibiting liver fibrogenesis and/or promoting
fibrolysis.
Many researchers demonstrated that effective inhibition of
hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus replication significantly
improved the fibrosis stage in patients with hepatitis B or C,
and that liver fibrosis can be reversed in some participants.9–11 However, there are still some patients with virological and biochemical attenuation, whose liver fibrosis still
exists and even progresses, eventually into liver cancer.12
Additionally, it takes a prolonged period of time to promote
the resolution of liver fibrosis after viral elimination. Antiviral
benefits may be offset by the increased rates of drug resistance over time.11
Treatment based on the etiology may not completely
attenuate all fibrosis patients, as there are currently no
effective managements for eliminating the cause of certain
liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis.12 Thus, direct
antifibrotic therapies targeting ECM metabolism and HSC
activation are indispensable.
Antifibrotic therapies
Liver fibrosis plays an important role in liver tissue repair in
the early stage of injury. However, the management of liver
fibrosis is required in significant or advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis. At present, there is no recognized and effective
antifibrotic agent. Chronic inflammatory response is the
premise of fibrogenesis and the driving force of fibrotic
progression. Antiinflammation, hepatocyte protection and
antioxidation are important methods for hepatic fibrosis. In
the following sections, we mainly review representative drugs
based on therapeutic targets. Table 1 displays phase II/III/IV
clinical trials for current therapies.
Bile acid homeostasis and energy metabolism
Ursodeoxycholic acid
CLDs represent a series of hepatobiliary diseases accompanied by disorders of bile formation, secretion, and excretion.
The CLDs mainly include primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), both having a risk of
progression to liver fibrosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a
physiologic hydrophilic dihydroxy bile acid, is the primary
drug for treating CLD. Its antifibrotic property may be
associated with the stimulation of bile secretion and the
suppression of inflammation.13 Parés et al.14 pointed out
that UDCA (15 mg/kg daily, 1.5-14 years) improved survival
Fig. 1. HSCs are the key cells in the progression and regression of liver fibrosis.

and delayed the histologic stage progression of PBC patients.
UDCA use can significantly reduce alkaline phosphatase (ALP;
an essential indicator of CLD activity) levels in patients. The
most frequent adverse event in clinical trials is diarrhea,
which rarely leads to discontinuation of therapy.
However, only 20-30% of PBC patients had a complete
response to UDCA, and UDCA discontinuation deteriorates
liver biochemical indicators and is associated with pruritus.15
UDCA has an optimal dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/d. Lindor et al.16
found that high-dose UDCA (28-30 mg/kg daily, 5 years)
increased the risk of advanced cirrhosis, esophageal varices,
and bile duct cancer. A new phase IV clinical trial
(NCT03345589) has been proposed by West China Hospital,
Chengdu, China. This trial aims to define whether an alternative dose (18-22 mg/kg daily) of UDCA is effective in refractory PBC.
For PSC, the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases recommends not to use UDCA as a treatment, as
PSC patients did not exhibit significant improvements after a
long-term UDCA therapy.17
Farnesoid X receptor agonist
Farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR), also known as bile acid
receptor, is involved in the synthesis, secretion and reabsorption of bile acids. FXR activation effectively improves lipid
metabolism through improving insulin sensitivity, decreasing
hepatic gluconeogenesis, and reducing circulating triglycerides.18 Thus, FXR is a potential target for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and CLD-related liver fibrosis.
Obeticholic acid (OCA), an agonist of FXR, decreases bile
acids synthesis and exerts antiinflammatory and antifibrotic
effects. In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled
trial,19 patients with NASH exhibited improvements of liver
histological features after treatment with OCA (25 mg,
72 weeks). However, OCA therapy was accompanied by a
deterioration involving dyslipidemia and IR, indicating an
increased risk of atherogenesis. Given these adverse
events, OCA treatment for NASH should be further evaluated
in long-term prospective trials.
OCA has also been widely used in clinical trials for PBC.
Nevens et al.20 conducted a phase III clinical trial in PBC
patients with inadequate response to conventional drugs.
After 12 months of therapy, the OCA had significantly
reduced ALP, high-density lipoprotein, and total bilirubin
levels. These effects were sustained for 2 years. Although
improvements were observed at the lower dose (5 mg) in
some patients, incremental benefits occurred with adjustment to the higher dosage (10 mg). Another double-blind
phase II trial,21 including 165 patients with inadequate
response to UDCA, showed that OCA resulted in a clinically
significant reduction in ALP at all doses (10, 25, and 50 mg).
There were also significant improvements in gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), and conjugated bilirubin levels. In
2016, OCA was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients intolerant or with a null response to UDCA.
Dose-dependent pruritus was the only clinical adverse
event that differed between OCA treatment and
placebo.21,22 Pruritus can be controlled by antipruritic
agents or temporary OCA interruption, but high OCA doses
may result in the discontinuation due to pruritus. The mechanism of cholestatic pruritus may be related to the activation
of TGR5,23 as OCA is a weak TGR5 agonist.
Non-bile acid FXR agonists have also been developed and
are expected to cause less pruritus than OCA.24 Tropifexor
(also known as LJN-452), a well-tolerated FXR agonist, is
suitable for once-daily dosing25 and has been used in phase
II clinical trials for PBC and NASH (NCT02516605,
NCT04065841, and NCT03517540). Similarly, cilofexor (otherwise known as GS-9674) is also currently undergoing phase
II trials for NASH and CLD. Cilofexor therapy (30 mg or 100
mg daily, 12 weeks) reduced ALP levels in a dose-dependent
manner in patients with PSC, while adverse events (pruritus)
were similar among groups.26 In another trial,27 cilofexor (30
mg or 100 mg daily, 24 weeks) significantly improved hepatic
steatosis and liver biochemistry in patients with NASH.
However, no significant improvements in liver stiffness were
observed with magnetic resonance imaging-proton density
fat fraction and magnetic resonance elastography. Pruritus
was more common in patients receiving cilofexor at 100 mg
than those receiving cilofexor at 30 mg or placebo. Additional
studies of cilofexor in NASH with a longer duration are
warranted.
PPAR agonist
PPAR is a key regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver and has
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a
molecular target for dyslipidemia. As distinct PPAR isoforms,
PPARa regulates cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis,28
while PPARg contributes to inhibiting the activation of HSCs
and reducing collagen production.29 Hence, PPAR is a potential target for hepatic fibrosis.
Bezafibrate, an agonist of PPAR, is a widely used antihyperlipidemic agent. In a phase III clinical trial,30 bezafibrate treatment (400 mg, 24 months) in addition to UDCA
contributed to a significant biochemical attenuation in PBC
patients with an inadequate response to UDCA. The bezafibrate group also exhibited decreased liver stiffness and
improved fibrosis scores compared with placebo. Another
prospective study31 has compared the long-term efficacy
between combination therapy (UDCA + bezafibrate) and
UDCA monotherapy for PBC patients. The combination
therapy significantly decreased ALP levels and Mayo risk
scores but did not improve the survival rate. Bezafibrate
may result in dose reduction or discontinuation due to the
renal dysfunction or muscle pain.
Other PPAR agonists such as fenofibrate and seladelpar
have also been used in phase II/III clinical trials (Table 1).
According to a meta-analysis,32 combination therapy of
UDCA and fenofibrate had a superior efficacy to UDCA monotherapy in reducing ALP levels, whereas no improvements
were observed in clinical symptoms. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse events.
However, all trials included in this meta-analysis had a small
sample size and no adequate histological results were
reported. In prior studies, several serious adverse events
were found after fibrates therapy, including hepatotoxicity,
elevated creatinine, and increased creatinine kinase.33
Hence, larger controlled multicenter studies are required to
confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of PPAR agonists.

Hepatic inflammation
Cenicriviroc
Approaches directly targeting the inflammatory recruitment
are also important. CCR2 and its ligand are significantly
increased in liver fibrosis, and fibrosis is significantly ameliorated in CCR2-deficient mice,34 suggesting that CCR2 is
involved in liver fibrosis. CCR5 is also associated with the
accumulation of collagen and ECM.35 Therefore, inhibition of
CCRs may be a novel approach for liver fibrosis.
Cenicriviroc (CVC), an oral antagonist of the dual CCR2/
CCR5 receptor, is safe, well-tolerated and has been used in
phase II clinical trials in NASH patients with liver fibrosis. CVC
(150 mg daily, 2 years) can significantly promote NASH
regression and decrease the collagen area (as detected by
morphometry on liver biopsy). Treatment benefits were more
significant in patients with higher disease activity and fibrosis
stage at baseline. Safety and tolerability of CVC were comparable to placebo, and adverse events (fatigue, diarrhea)
had a mild or moderate severity.36 Another phase III trial
(NCT03028740) has been posted which investigates the
long-term efficacy and safety of CVC in advanced cirrhosis
patients. This trial mainly aims to evaluate liver histological
improvements based on a larger sample. Overall, CVC has a
favorable prospect in the application for liver fibrosis.
Galectin-3 inhibitor
Galectins are secreted proteins that bind to terminal galactose residues in glycoproteins on components of the ECM.
Galectin-3 is highly expressed on Kupffer cells and plays a
vital role in cell adhesion, inflammation, and fibrogenesis.37
In animal models, glectin-3 inhibitors significantly reduced
fibrosis stages and portal pressure.38,39 GR-MD-02, a galectin-3 inhibitor, was safe and well-tolerated in subjects who
had a definite histological diagnosis of NASH with advanced
fibrosis.40 FibroScan test showed the potential benefits of GRMD-02 therapy (8 mg/kg daily) on liver stiffness.40 Recently,
Chalasani et al.41 conducted a phase II clinical trial of GR-MD02 in 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Though improvements of fibrosis or NAFLD activity
scores did not differ significantly among groups, a subgroup
analysis showed that GR-MD-02 therapy (2 mg/kg biweekly,
52 weeks) did reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient and
development of varices in patients without esophageal
varices. Spasmodic cough was the only adverse event
related to the study drug. A phase III trial has been initiated
to evaluate to safety and efficacy of GR-MD-02 in NASH cirrhosis patients without esophageal varices (NCT04365868).
Human fibroblast growth factor analogs
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of hormones regulate metabolic functions and participate in tissue repair and
regeneration.42 Among them, FGF19 and FGF21 are considered to be closely related to NAFLD. NGM282, an engineered
FGF19 analogue, has been used in phase II clinical trial for
NASH.43 NGM282 therapy (3 or 6 mg daily, 12 weeks) can
significantly reduce liver fat content and decrease ALT and
AST levels without severe adverse event. Similarly, pegbelfermin (BMS-986036), a pegylated human FGF21 analogue,
was well-tolerated and significantly reduced hepatic fat fraction in patients with NASH.44 No severe adverse events or
drug-related discontinuations were reported. However,
whether FGF analogs contribute to improving liver fibrosis
histology is still unknown. It’s worthy of further discussion
in the follow-up clinical trials. Currently, two active phase II
clinical trials (NCT03486912, NCT03486899) are investigating the efficacy and safety of pegbelfermin in patients with
NASH-related fibrosis as determined by liver biopsy.
Cell death
Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 inhibitor
Continuous cell death of hepatocytes is a critical trigger for
liver fibrosis. The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)
regulates intracellular pathways of cell death, and its activation results in a deterioration in hepatic inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. ASK1 inhibitor treatment protects against
liver injury through decreasing oxidative stress reaction and
the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.45 As an ASK1
inhibitor, selonsertib (6 or 18 mg daily, 24 weeks) decreased
collagen content and reduced lobular inflammation on liver
biopsy in patients with NASH and stage 2-3 fibrosis, accompanied by improvements in liver stiffness on magnetic resonance elastography.46 However, the majority of patients
receiving selonsertib experienced at least one adverse
event. Side effects, such as numbness of upper extremities
and elevated liver enzymes, resulted in the discontinuation in
several patients. A recent phase III clinical trial
(NCT03053063) investigated the long-term (240 weeks) efficacy and safety of selonsertib in liver cirrhosis due to NASH.
However, this trial was terminated early due to lack of efficacy
based on the results of the week 48 analysis.
Pan-caspase inhibitor
Apoptosis-mediated inflammation and immune response also
play a crucial role in the process of fibrosis. Caspases are
intracellular cysteine proteases that participate in the process
of apoptosis and inflammation through proinflammatory
cytokines. Emricasan is a well-tolerated pan-caspase inhibitor. Emricasan (25 mg twice daily, 28 days) can effectively
decrease ALT levels, reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient, and improve intrahepatic inflammation in patients with
compensated cirrhosis.47 Most reported adverse events were
not serious and the frequent side effect was fatigue. Despite
improvements in liver enzymes and hepatic inflammation, it
is unlikely that Emricasan exerted an antifibrotic effect in
28 days.47 Although improvements of hepatitis may occur
relatively rapidly, attenuation of fibrosis will take longer. A
recent phase II trial48 demonstrated that Emricasan (25 mg
twice daily, 3 months) improved liver function and reduced
Child-Pugh scores in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Incidence of adverse events was similar between Emricasan
and placebo groups. However, it is worth noting that the multiple etiologies of cirrhosis may obscure the actual efficacy
when setting clinical scores as endpoints. Optimal doses and
long-term efficacy of Emricasan will be explored in an active
phase II trial (NCT03205345) in NASH patients with cirrhosis.

Guo Y.C. et al: Antifibrotic drugs

ECM and fibrogenesis
Transforming growth factor-b inhibitor
Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) is considered to be the
central factor participating in liver fibrosis. Various strategies
have been developed to inhibit the TGF-b pathway. Pirfenidone, an inhibitor of TGF-b, can ameliorate fibrogenesis
through inhibiting the activation of HSCs and reducing collagen synthesis in vitro.
49 Borunda et al.50 found that pirfenidone was well-tolerated and attenuated histological injuries
in patients with established advanced cirrhosis after
12 months of treatment. Only 15% of patients developed
adverse events, and these included photosensitivity, rash,
itching, and nausea. A phase II clinical trial51 showed that
pirfenidone (1200 mg daily, 24 months) improved inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis in patients with hepatitis C virusrelated cirrhosis. All patients on pirfenidone displayed
improvements of life quality and Child-Pugh scores. Side
effects such as gastritis and nausea were observed. As viral
clearance is indispensable to resolve liver damage, a combination therapy of pirfenidone and antiviral agents may be a
new approach for viral fibrosis.
Similarly, based on structural modification of pirfenidone,
hydronidone is a novel antifibrotic agent for hepatic fibrosis.52
An open-label and randomized clinical trial showed that
hydronidone was well tolerated and rapidly absorbed in
young, healthy volunteers.52 A phase II clinical trial
(NCT02499562) has explored the effective dose and safety
of hydronidone capsules in patients with liver fibrosis
induced by hepatitis B virus infection in Shanghai General
Hospital, Shanghai, China. However, related results have
not been posted.
Lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 antibody
The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family is crosslinking enzymes overexpressed in liver cirrhosis and contributes to fibrogenesis by
catalyzing cross-linkage of collagen and increases the stability of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis settings.53 Among the five
isoforms, LOXL2 is overexpressed by activated HSCs in liver
fibrosis. Selective inhibition of LOXL2 suppresses hepatic fibrosis progression and accelerates its reversal in animal fibrosis models.54
However, simtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against LOXL2, did not show a promising benefit in
clinical trials. In two phase IIb trials, simtuzumab alone
(subcutaneous injections: 75 or 125 mg; intravenous infusions: 200 or 700 mg, 96 weeks) was ineffective in decreasing hepatic collagen content or fibrosis stage in patients with
bridging fibrosis and hepatitis C virus infection.55 In another
6-month open-label safety trial, though treatment was welltolerated, no significant improvements were observed in
hepatic venous pressure gradient or liver biopsy after simtuzumab therapy (700 mg, intravenous infusion every 2 weeks
for 22 weeks).56 Also, in patients with PSC, simtuzumab
therapy (75 or 125 mg daily, 96 weeks) did not reduce liver
collagen content or Ishak fibrosis stage.57
Renin-angiotensin system inhibitor
The renin-angiotensin system is a crucial regulator of liver
fibrosis and portal hypertension.58 Activated HSCs can
secrete angiotensin II that promotes liver fibrosis through
angiotensin receptors. Yoshiji et al.59 demonstrated that
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combination
(perindopril: 4 mg daily, 12 months) with interferon
decreased serum fibrosis markers (hyaluronic acid, 7-S-collagen, P-III-P, TGF-b) in patients with chronic refractory hepatitis C. Another clinical trial60 demonstrated that ACEI
(captopril: 25-75 mg daily, 3 months) effectively reduced
the portal pressure and prevented variceal bleeding in portal
hypertensive patients. The adverse effects of captopril
(orthostatic hypotension and dry cough) were not severe
enough to stop medication. However, these studies are
limited by their lack of histological and immunohistochemical
examinations.
Similarly, angiotensin receptor blockades may also attenuate liver fibrosis. Losartan (50 mg daily, 48weeks) can
decrease serum aminotransferase levels and promote histological improvements in NASH with no adverse events.61 In a
randomized open-label controlled study, a combination
therapy of candesartan (8 mg daily) and UDCA (600 mg
daily) for 6 months also suppressed the expression of fibrosis
biomarkers and decreased arterial blood pressure in alcoholic
liver fibrosis with no significant complications or side
effects.62 Recently, a phase III trial (NCT03770936) has
been posted to compare the efficacy of candesartan and ramipril in hepatitis C virus-related liver fibrosis.
Challenges
At present, due to the complex mechanisms involved in
hepatic fibrosis, antihepatic fibrosis therapies still face many
problems, as outlined here:12,63 1) Hepatic fibrosis has a long
disease course. The most reliable method for evaluating the
efficacy of treatments is to observe the histopathological
changes. In contrast, it is not appropriate to use the clinical
serum or radiologic measurements directly as the primary
endpoints. 2) Currently, the mechanism involved in liver fibrosis has not been elucidated thoroughly. Murine models may
not accurately mimic human liver diseases. 3) Up to now,
many antifibrotic trials still assess the efficacy by liver
biopsy, which is costly and can be affected by sampling. The
invasive inspection may result in complications. 4) Though
many clinical trials confirm the efficacy and safety of combination therapy, the role of each component is not defined. 5)
Many scholars consider stem cells as a potential option.
However, the cellular and molecular basis of liver regeneration in liver fibrosis have not been elucidated totally.
Conclusions
Cirrhosis is a severe form of chronic liver disease and is the
typical outcome of various etiologies-induced liver injuries. In
this article, we reviewed current therapies in clinical trials.
Safe and effective therapies may delay the development of
decompensated cirrhosis and even reverse fibrosis stage.
Apart from conventional cause-specific therapies, the most
promising treatments for liver fibrosis are those that target
cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the reversal of
fibrosis. As we continue to explore the mechanisms and
targets of hepatic fibrosis, effective antifibrotic therapies will
be a reality in the future.
