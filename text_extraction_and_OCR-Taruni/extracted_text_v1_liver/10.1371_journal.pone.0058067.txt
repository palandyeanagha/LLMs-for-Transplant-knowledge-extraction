Abstract
Background: The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) is a commonly used freely
available self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Despite its popularity, several recent investigations have called into
question the robustness and suitability of the commonly used 4-factor 20-item CES-D model. The goal of the current study
was to address these concerns by confirming the factorial validity of the CES-D.
Methods and Findings: Differential item functioning estimates were used to examine sex biases in item responses, and
confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess prior CES-D factor structures and new models heeding current theoretical
and empirical considerations. Data used for the analyses included undergraduate (n = 948; 74% women), community
(n = 254; 71% women), rehabilitation (n = 522; 53% women), clinical (n = 84; 77% women), and National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 2814; 56% women) samples. Differential item functioning identified an item as inflating
CES-D scores in women. Comprehensive comparison of the several models supported a novel, psychometrically robust, and
unbiased 3-factor 14-item solution, with factors (i.e., negative affect, anhedonia, and somatic symptoms) that are more in
line with current diagnostic criteria for depression.
Conclusions: Researchers and practitioners may benefit from using the novel factor structure of the CES-D and from being
cautious in interpreting results from the originally proposed scale. Comprehensive results, implications, and future research
directions are discussed.

Introduction
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision [1] characterizes depression as
a multidimensional construct comprising negative emotion (i.e.,
negative affect; Criterion A1), an absence of positive emotions (i.e.,
anhedonia; Criterion A2), and a cluster of physical symptoms (i.e.,
somatisation; Criteria A3-5). The Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [2] is among the most popular
measures of depressive symptoms, likely owing its popularity to
being free and generally comparable [3–5] with the wellestablished Beck Depression Inventories [6], [7]. Despite its
popularity, the CES-D has areas of concern, particularly in its
latent factor structure and item content.
The CES-D was originally posited as having a 4-factor structure
representing depressed affect, absence of positive affect or
anhedonia, somatic activity or inactivity, and interpersonal
challenges [2]. The CES-D items and structure were not designed
a priori to reflect diagnostic criteria at the time of its development
[8] and recent investigations have called into question the
robustness and stability of the original 4-factor 20-item structure
[9–11]. Indeed, over 20 alternative factor solutions have been
reported (Table 1) and have suggested the presence of one, two,
three, and four factors [12–14]. The majority of factor-analytic
studies of the CES-D have employed principal component analysis
with orthogonal rotation [4], an analytic approach that may have
theoretically improbable assumptions and biased factor solutions
[15]. The shift away from such approaches is not a shift away from
exploratory factor analyses, but a shift towards the best practices
for such analyses; that said, exploratory factor analyses tend to be
exploratory. In the case of constructs that are established (e.g.,
depression), confirmatory factor analyses may be more informative
as measures are designed to fit a construct, instead of naming
constructs to fit the results from a measure.
Many researchers have also questioned the validity and
psychometric properties of several items on the CES-D [16–25].
Items potentially assessing somatic concerns (e.g., ‘‘I felt that
everything I did was an effort’’) may artificially inflate CES-D
scores for elderly or chronic pain populations [26], [27]. Two
socially-focused items (i.e., ‘‘People were unfriendly’’ and ‘‘I felt
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58067

that people disliked me’’) are believed to potentially confound the
validity of the CES-D by assessing other constructs (e.g., perceived
social competence) and symptoms of other disorders (e.g., Social
Anxiety Disorder) [4], [11], [14], [21]. For at least one item (i.e.,
‘‘I had crying spells’’), there appears to be a robust sex difference
in responses, leading to inappropriate inflation of women’s CES-D
scores due to cultural norms regarding emotional expression,
rather than actual differences in depressive symptoms [19], [20],
[25], [28], [29]. Furthermore, the CES-D also includes four
reverse-worded items (e.g., ‘‘I was happy’’) designed ‘‘…to break
tendencies toward response set as well as to assess positive affect (or
its absence)’’ [2]; however, these two purposes are at odds and may
lead to misrepresentation of response patterns or biased estimations of positive affect [4], [30]. Research suggests that depression
marked by absence of positive affect (i.e., anhedonia) may be
qualitatively and quantitatively different than depression resulting
from heightened negative affect [31–33], implying that measures
of depression should assess this dimension directly.
The aims of the current study were to (1) identify any sex biases
within the item content of the CES-D, (2) explore which of the
many prior factor solutions for the CES-D (Table 1) would
demonstrate the best factorial validity, and (3) test whether a new
theory-driven solution would exhibit the best fit. The ability of
items to predict depression similarly among men and women (i.e.,
differential validity) was assessed by using an application of item
response theory. The factorial validity of the CES-D was
examined using a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs)
that tested previously established models, as well as new models
based on theory and empirical research. This approach is in line
with conclusions from a recent meta-analysis [4] suggesting that
the use of CFAs would be an appropriate next step in solidifying
the optimal factor structure of the CES-D; that is, the use of CFAs
will circumvent the almost exclusive prior use of exploratory factor
analytic techniques with the CES-D [4], [15]. The present study
performed these analyses using five different samples (i.e.,
undergraduate, community, rehabilitation, clinical with a history
of depression, and a nationally representative sample from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHANES) to
permit generalizability of the findings across several applications
(e.g., epidemiological, clinical), while addressing the overuse of
data from specialized samples in this area (e.g., adolescent,
geriatric).

from several sources (details below); however, participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the data
collection associated with each archival source. The consent forms
in those data collections were all approved by ethics committees.
Participants
The first sample included undergraduates (n = 948) from the
University of Regina (251 men, 18–52 years [M age = 21.2;
SD = 4.3] and 697 women, 18–50 years [M age = 21.0; SD = 4.7])
who completed the CES-D as part of other investigations
approved by the University of Regina Research Ethics Board.
Using this type of sample generally ensures a wide range of
responses, whereas an entirely clinical sample might provide
a restricted range of relatively higher responses [15], [34].
Participants identified their ethnicity as White/Caucasian (89%),
First Nations (i.e., Canadian Aboriginal; 3%), Asian (4%), or other
(4%). Most reported being single (84%), while others were married
or cohabiting (13%), separated or divorced (1%), or chose not to
answer (2%). Undergraduates were recruited via campus advertisements directing them to a secure website for completion of an
online questionnaire package.
The second sample included community members (n = 254)
from across Canada (73 men, 18–54 years [M age = 32.6;
SD = 11.3] and 181 women, 18–55 years [M age = 32.0;
SD = 11.3]) who completed the CES-D as part of another webbased investigation approved by the University of Regina Research Ethics Board. Like the undergraduate sample, the
community sample was included to ensure a wide range of
responses. Most (70%) reported having at least some postsecondary education, being employed (50% full-time, 14% parttime, 10% as homemakers), and being single (52%). Others
reported being married or cohabiting (35%), separated or divorced
(10%), or chose not to answer (3%). Participants identified their
ethnicity as Caucasian (87%), First Nations (Canadian Aboriginal;
2%), Asian (2%), or other (9%).
The third sample was a rehabilitation sample of tertiary level
rehabilitation patients (n = 522) from a government-sponsored
rehabilitation program who completed the CES-D as part of
tertiary assessment for issues related to injuries sustained in motorvehicle or work place accidents (246 men, 18–85 years [M
age = 42.5; SD = 12.5] and 276 women, 18–79 years [M
age = 43.2; SD = 12.5]). The rehabilitation sample was included
to provide a comparatively broad range of responses from
a treatment-seeking sample that is very likely distressed, but not
necessarily depressed. Ethnicity data was not recorded for the
rehabilitation sample, but can be assumed to be primarily
Caucasian based on population demographics. Most reported
being married or cohabiting (57%), while others were single (27%),
separated or divorced (13%), or widowed (3%). Education levels
were not available for this sample.
The fourth sample, described as a clinical sample, included
community members (n = 84) from across Canada (19 men, 18–53
years [M age = 29.4; SD = 11.4] and 65 women, 18–55 years [M
age = 24.4; SD = 8.4]) who completed the CES-D as part of
another web-based investigation approved by the University of
Regina Research Ethics Board. In this sample, participants
reported being diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder by
a psychiatrist (77%) or a registered doctoral level psychologist
(23%). The average reported length of time since diagnosis was
approximately four years. Most of the clinical participants (60%)
reported having at least some postsecondary education, and most
reported being employed (24% full-time, 20% part-time) or
students (39%). Clinical participants identified their ethnicity as
Caucasian (89%), First Nations (i.e., Canadian Aboriginal; 4%), or
other (7%). Participants reported being single (63%), married or
cohabiting (29%), or separated or divorced (8%).
The fifth sample, referred to throughout as the NHANES
sample, included community members (n = 2814) from a large
scale sampling of participants across the United States (1242 men,
25–74 years [M age = 46.5; SD = 14.0] and 1572 women, 25–74
years [M age = 45.1; SD = 13.9]) who completed the CES-D. The
data was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics
from 1971–1975 as part of a Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey; however, depression symptoms have not changed substantially since then [1], [8]. The public access data is from the
National Institute of Mental Health and we are grateful for the
NHANES contribution. Comprehensive descriptions of the data
collection are available directly online from the Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention. Many of the NHANES
participants reported having completed Grade 12 (37%) or having
at least some postsecondary education (32%), and most reported
being employed (52% full-time, 11% part-time) or working as
homemakers (33%). NHANES participants identified their
ethnicity as Caucasian (91%), African American (8%), or other
(1%). The majority reported being married or cohabiting (79%),
while others reported being single (7%), separated or divorced
(8%), or widowed (6%).
Measures
The CES-D is a 20-item measure assessing symptoms of
depression with items phrased as self-statements (e.g., ‘‘I felt
hopeful about the future’’). Respondents rate how frequently each
item applied to them over the course of the past week. Ratings
were based on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (rarely or
none of the time [less than 1 day]) to 3 (most or all of the time [5–7
days]).
Analyses
Descriptive statistics and differential item
functioning. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each item
within each of the samples (Table 2). Means on each of the items
for men and women were compared by t-tests across samples as an
initial index of differential validity. Differential item functioning
was subsequently estimated to assess whether men and women
differed in their responses to each item along the continuum of
CES-D scores. Differential item functioning occurs when individuals with the same latent trait (i.e., depression) or total score (e.g.,
on the CES-D) respond to items differently due to test
characteristics (e.g., paper and pencil vs. computerised) or biases
(e.g., due to sex or race [35], [36]). Estimates of differential item
functioning can illustrate, for example, that men and women may
respond similarly to an item when they have relatively low CES-D
scores, but respond differently to the item when they are severely
depressed. Differential item functioning was estimated using an
item response theory approach rather than a Mantel-Haenszel
approach as it provides a more accurate estimate of non-uniform
differential item functioning (e.g., if it occurs only in more severe
levels of depression [37]). Non-parametric item characteristic
curves were rendered using jMetrik 2.1.0 [38] and were smoothed
using a Gaussian kernel. Item characteristic curves are an integral
part of item response theory that plot which response option (e.g.,
0, 1, 2, or 3 on a Likert scale) is most likely to be endorsed by an
individual with a certain total score. To illustrate an absence of
differential item functioning on the CES-D, men and women with
similar levels of depression should endorse the same option on
each item of the CES-D (e.g., severely depressed men and women
would both chose the highest option), and therefore exhibit very
similar item characteristic curves. The distance between the curves
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58067

for each sex was examined manually to identify potential
differential item functioning. An item was only confidently deemed
to exhibit differential item functioning if the curves for men and
women were grossly dissimilar either in slope or intercept. Item
response theory analyses require both relatively large samples and
a range of scores spanning the full continuum of potential scores
on the measure [35]; consequently, all five samples were combined
for these, but not subsequent analyses. Item characteristic curves
were plotted based on total CES-D scores, rather than latent
depression, given the aforementioned difficulties associated with
the latent structure of the CES-D.
Testing and modifying previous factor solutions. A series
of CFAs was conducted to replicate and test selected factor
structures published in previous studies (Table 1) and to extend
these previous models by excluding potentially problematic items
as suggested by previous research. Specifically, there appears to be
consensus throughout the literature that items 15 (i.e., ‘‘People
were unfriendly’’) and 19 (i.e., ‘‘I felt that people disliked me’’) may
warrant removal as they reflect interpersonal difficulties, a dimension not consistent with contemporary diagnostic criteria for
depression [1], [4], [11], [14], [21]. Similarly, item 17 (i.e., ‘‘I had
crying spells’’) may warrant removal as it produces robust sex
differences in endorsement [25], [28], [29]. Accordingly, previously demonstrated factor structures were tested with and
without items 15, 17, and 19. Several previous analyses have also
suggested that 2-item factors within the CES-D (Table 1) are
inherently unstable [15], [39]. Given the challenges associated
with 2-item factors, models including a 2-item factor (e.g., [21],
[40]) were tested with and without the 2-item factor utilizing the
same procedures (i.e., testing with and without items 15, 17, and
19).
CFAs were conducted separately in each sample to determine
whether the structure of the CES-D is generalizable and stable
across different applications. The size of the clinical sample was
not optimal for CFAs but research supports the applicability of
CFAs in samples of as low as 51 participants [41]; moreover, the
reliability of the factors and the strength of the communalities
between the items facilitate the use of CFAs in this sample. The
CFAs were performed with AMOS 18 and data from each of the
five samples were inputted in a maximum likelihood estimation
procedure. Bollen-Stine bootstrap chi-square and computed
bootstrapped parameter estimates with estimates from a maximum-likelihood procedure [45], [46] were also conducted because
the data did not exhibit multivariate normality; however, results
were comparable to the maximum-likelihood procedure and are
excluded for brevity. Each model was evaluated using the
following fit indices with 90% confidence intervals (when
applicable): 1) chi-square (values should not be significant); 2)
chi-square/df ratio (values should be less than 2.0); 3) Comparative Fit Index (CFI; values must be greater than.90, and ideal fits

Results
Internal Consistency
Internal consistency was acceptable for the current undergraduate (Cronbach’s a= .91), community (Cronbach’s a= .94), rehabilitation (Cronbach’s a = .92), clinical (Cronbach’s a = .85),
and NHANES (Cronbach’s a = .85) samples. The average interitem Pearson correlation with the reverse-scored items (i.e.,
positive affect/anhedonia) was .34 for the undergraduate sample,
.43 for the community sample, .38 for the rehabilitation sample,
.23 for the clinical sample, and .26 for the NHANES sample. The
average inter-item Pearson correlation without the reverse-scored
items (i.e., positive affect/anhedonia) was .37 for the undergraduate sample, .44 for the community sample, .40 for the
rehabilitation sample, .25 for the clinical sample, and .33 for the
NHANES sample. In all cases the average inter-item correlation
was relatively low, indicating diversity among the items and
supporting notions of more than one latent construct. The lowest
inter-item correlation was for the clinical sample and suggests that
there may be substantial variation among clinical presentations of
these symptoms for persons with a history of depression. Such
variation is implicitly supported by DSM-IV-TR diagnostic
criteria that allow for high levels of negative affect or high levels
of anhedonia to qualify as hallmark criteria for major depressive
disorder (i.e., ‘‘(1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or
pleasure’’; page 356 [1]).
Sex Differences on CES-D Items
Across all samples, persons with missing data (i.e., fewer than
1%) were excluded from the analyses. The t-tests comparing men
and women’s responses from all samples combined suggested that
women reported statistically significantly higher scores (p,.05) on
most CES-D items (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20); however, the effect sizes (i.e., using percentage of
variance accounted for ‘‘r
2
’’) were negligible (i.e., r
2
,.01) for most,
but not all items (i.e., items 3, 5, 6, 20, r
2= .02; item 14, r2= .03;
item 18, r
2= .04; item 17, r2= .07). Item 17 (i.e., ‘‘I had crying
spells’’) was the only item with item characteristic curves that
differed markedly between men and women, suggesting it has
significant differential item functioning. An item with nil or
negligible differential item functioning (i.e., item 20) is presented in
Figure 1 (i.e., Item characteristic curves) alongside item 17 for
illustrative purposes. The item characteristic curves demonstrate
that men and women respond similarly to item 17 when
depression levels are low or slightly above average (22.5 SD to
+0.5 SD), with both sexes choosing 0 (rarely or none of the time);
however, as depression levels increase, women are more likely to
choose a higher response option compared to men. Indeed, even
the most depressed men are most likely to choose 1 (some or a little
of the time), while the most depressed women are more likely to
choose 2 (occasionally or a moderate amount of the time) or 3
(most or all of the time). The item characteristic curve plots for all
items are not displayed for brevity, but are available from the
authors upon request.
Structural Analyses: CFA Results
The fit indices for each of the previously reported models – as
evaluated with data from each sample – are presented in Table 3
(where the model CFI exceeded.92 in at least three out of the five
samples). The results were interpreted to suggest that five models
might have the factorial validity to provide utility in divergent
populations, as many of the fit indices met acceptable standards
across the different samples. However, all of these models included
item 17 and/or failed to include items that assess positive affect,
which is inconsistent with current theory and diagnostic
approaches concerning depression [1]. Of all the newly derived
models (i.e., with items 15, 17, and 19 removed and without 2-item

factors [if relevant]), only one exhibited acceptable fit indices
within each sample, included positive affect items, and did not
include item 17. The model with the best fit indices was a revision
of the one proposed by Radloff [47], which also excluded items 9,
10, and 13. Relevant fit indices and inter-factor correlations for
this newly derived model are reported in Table 4. The original
model proposed by Radloff [47] included four factors: depressed
affect (items 3, 6, 14, 17, 18), anhedonia (items 4, 8, 12, 16),
somatic complaints (items 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, 20), and interpersonal
concerns (items 15, 19). Eliminating item 17 and the two
interpersonal items results in an easily interpretable 3-factor
structure (Tables 5 and 6; Figure 2– Path Diagram for the CES-D
new factor solution) that includes factors of negative affect (items 3,
6, 14, 18), anhedonia (items 4, 8, 12, 16), and somatic complaints
(items 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, 20), which is compatible with current DSMIV-TR conceptualization of depression [1]. The internal consistencies (determined using Cronbach’s alpha) for the total score of
the newly derived factor structure (undergraduate a = .87;
community a= .92; rehabilitation a = .90; clinical a = .80;
NHANES a= .83), the negative affect subscale (undergraduate
a = .87; community a= .90; rehabilitation a= .89; clinical a = .82;
NHANES a= .74), the anhedonia subscale (undergraduate
a = .75; community a = .86; rehabilitation a = .79; clinical
a = .81; NHANES a = .73), and the somatic subscale (undergraduate a= .72; community a = .80; rehabilitation a= .78; clinical
a = .51; NHANES a = .81) were all acceptable with the exception
of the somatic subscale in the clinical sample (i.e., a = .51). The
correlation between the total score of the original CES-D and the
total score of the current variant, as well as the correlations
between their respective subscale scores, were all very high
(Table 7).
Discussion
Despite the popularity of the CES-D, there has been considerable debate regarding the optimal factor structure and item
content for the measure (see Table 1). The current study sought to
summarize and address these issues by assessing the differential
validity of the CES-D and comparing the previously proposed
factor solutions for the CES-D to a novel, theoretically-driven
model. The results support a 14-item, 3-factor model that is
relatively more congruent with current diagnostic criteria for
depression [1].
Previous research has highlighted that item 17 (i.e., ‘‘I had
crying spells’’) of the CES-D may lead to inflated scores for women
[19], [20], [25], [28], [29]. As expected, item 17 exhibited
significant differential item functioning, such that even the most
depressed men were most likely to choose 1 (some or a little of the
time) on the Likert scale for that item, compared to the most
depressed women, who were more likely to choose 2 (occasionally
or a moderate amount of the time) or 3 (most or all of the time).
This finding underscores the importance of removing item 17 from
the CES-D and subsequently creating and utilizing new norms for
the measure that do not include this item. Continued use of item
17 and the associated norms or cut-offs will lead to notable
overestimates of depression in women and underestimates of
depression in men. Such misrepresentations owing to sex and
cultural biases, rather than true differences in depression, may
have significant social and practical healthcare implications.
Attempting to control for this sex difference by subtracting a value
from women’s scores (e.g., one point off of the total), or by
otherwise adjusting norms for each sex would be inappropriate
because sex differences on this item are nonlinear (i.e., women
score higher compared to men when both are severely depressed).
To illustrate, removing one point from women’s scores would
substantially and inappropriately lower scores of women who are
on the lower spectrum of depression (i.e., because item 17 is less
biased on the lower end of the spectrum) and would still
overestimate the severity of depression in severely depressed
women when compared to men.
Results of the CFAs failed to support CES-D models previously
identified by exploratory factor analyses. All models with
minimally acceptable fit indices for three out of the five samples
included individual items or 2-item factors that previous research
suggests should not be included in the CES-D [25], [28], or
involved extreme reductions in item content that impede the
capacity of the CES-D to assess DSM-IV-TR depressive
symptoms [1]. A modified version of the model proposed by
Radloff [47] provided a 3-factor (i.e., negative affect, anhedonia,
and somatic symptoms), 14-item solution that is consistent with
contemporary conceptualization of depression [1] and demonstrated excellent fit within all samples as indicated by all fit indices.
The solution also exhibited acceptable internal consistency for all
factors within all samples, with the exception of the somatic factor
having relatively poor internal consistency within the sample with
a history of depression. The differing results for internal
consistency suggest that negative affect and anhedonia may be
the most characteristic and consistent symptoms of depression,
while somatic symptoms may be more variable between individuals with a history of depression. The differences may result from
somatic symptoms being endorsed for reasons other than depression, such as chronic pain.
Several theoretical and clinical implications follow the present
findings. Researchers and clinicians should not use item 17 of the
CES-D (i.e., ‘‘I had crying spells’’) or be careful of its use and
interpretation. As the current results illustrate, a women crying is
not necessarily a viable index of her depression severity 2 perhaps
owing to culture norms of emotional expression 2 and a lack of
crying in either sex is not a viable index of an absence of
depression. Utilizing item 17 may lead to skewed estimations of
depression and invalid cut-offs scores. Nevertheless, crying is
a symptom of emotional distress, and researchers should explore
the possibility of creating a new item that assesses frequency of
crying without a sex bias. For example, perhaps a relative measure
of crying (e.g., ‘‘I cried much more frequently than I usually do’’ or
‘‘I felt like crying more than usual’’) rather than an absolute
measure of crying (e.g., ‘‘I cried most of the time’’) may limit such
sex biases. Moreover, the current model is consistent with previous
findings suggesting that socially-focused items of the CES-D (i.e.,
items 15 and 19) should not be included in the measure [4], [11],
[14], [21]. Finally, the current results further support depression as
a multidimensional disorder consisting of negative affect, anhedonia, and somatic symptoms [48–50].
The review of prior studies on the factor structure of the CES-D
highlights the divergent results of previous exploratory factor
analyses, none of which were strongly supported by CFAs with the
present data. Future studies of the CES-D may benefit more from
conducting further theory-driven confirmatory analyses rather
than exploratory analyses. The majority of previously reported
factor solutions suggested by previous exploratory factor analyses
exhibited poor fit in the current samples. The best fitting solution
was derived from contemporary theoretical research and previously established empirical data and exhibited excellent fit in the
variety of samples used. Accordingly, the version of the CES-D
presented herein would likely maintain factorial validity across
different settings (e.g., clinical, research). Future research on the
CES-D would benefit from exploring different forms of validity
(e.g., convergent validity, predictive validity) with the item set from
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale

the model suggested here. In addition, future research designs
should explicitly include comments regarding the influence of
sample on factor structure fit indices – a variable that the current
results indicates is important.
Several limitations of the current study provide directions for
future research. First, the majority of participants in the current
samples were not formally evaluated (e.g., with a structured
clinical interview) for clinically significant depression and although
the diagnostic criteria for depression has changed minimally since
data for the NHANES was collected (roughly 37 years ago),
potential changes over time with respect to social and cultural
attitudes may have resulted in different response rates and patterns
than if this data was collected today. Future research should assess
the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed item set with
participants categorized as meeting or not meeting DSM-IV
criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Second, the inability to
clinically classify individuals with or without depression also
precluded estimation of appropriate cut-off scores for the CES-D.
Future research may benefit from re-examining cut-off scores
while removing items identified in the current paper as inappropriate. Such an examination may shed light on discrepancies
in recommendations for cut-off scores [51–56]. Third, including
the reverse-scored items that are straightforwardly worded
assessments of positive affect/anhedonia may be creating a psychometric bias as a result of incidental response errors. Such
a possibility is relatively less likely than using reverse-worded items,
but future research could assess for such a bias by examining the
items separately and adding a measure that is not based entirely in
self-report for convergent and divergent validity. Fourth, combining all five samples created a large enough sample to produce
accurate estimations of differential item functioning; however, the
combination of differing samples (e.g., clinical, community) may
have introduced unmeasured confounds (e.g., cultural differences
in the NHANES but not in the clinical sample) that may impact
differential item functioning. Future research should examine
differential item functioning on the CES-D in a variety of large,
culturally homogeneous samples. Fifth, the current study only
provides support for a revised version of the CES-D in a primarily
English-speaking sample. Future research should cross-validate
this revision using a more culturally diverse sample and test its
compatibility with versions of the CES-D in other languages.
Sixth, the somatic factor included in the final solution demonFigure 2. Path Diagram for the CES-D new factor solution.

strated adequate fit, but relatively low internal consistency. As
such, the somatic items may benefit from further revision as they
may currently focus on symptoms that are also characteristic of
other disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders) or fail to assess symptoms
frequently associated with depression. For example, item 11 (i.e.,
‘‘My sleep was restless’’) is too vague to be specifically related to

depression and certainly excludes hypersomnia, waking early, and
difficulty falling asleep, which are characteristic of depression [1].
Additional revisions to CES-D content might also consider
including items describing cognitive symptoms of depression
(e.g., thoughts of worthlessness or suicidal ideation) to further
adhere to current diagnostic criteria. It may also be worthwhile for
future researchers to consider adopting a differential weighting
schema for items in the CES-D, such that items are weighted

according to their analytical power. That said, given the increasing
availability of alternative screening measures (e.g., PHQ-9 [57]),
coupled with the longstanding psychometric difficulties of the
scale, it may be time to begin the process of retiring the CES-D in
favor of newer measures that are also freely available for use.
The present study addressed pertinent issues associated with
CES-D items and precedent factor structures. CFAs performed
with several samples (i.e., undergraduate, community, rehabilitation, clinical, and NHANES) were interpreted to suggest a novel
best fitting model for the CES-D that is psychometrically and
theoretically robust, comprising 3-factors (i.e., negative affect,
anhedonia, somatic symptoms) and 14-items relatively more
congruent with current diagnostic criteria for depression [1].
The CES-D items may benefit from additional revision; however,
this alternative solution offers a valid item set, without biases
related to social concerns or sex, for research and clinical
