Patients with inborn errors of immunity or DNA repair defects are at significant
risk of developing malignancy and this complication of their underlying condition
represents a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality. Whilst this risk is increasingly
well-recognized, our understanding of the causative mechanisms remains incomplete.
Diagnosing cancer is challenging in the presence of underlying co-morbidities and
frequently other inflammatory and lymphoproliferative processes. We lack a structured
approach to management despite recognizing the competing challenges of poor

response to therapy and increased risk of toxicity. Finally, clinicians need guidance on
how to screen for malignancy in many of these predisposing immunodeficiencies. In
order to begin to address these challenges, we brought together representatives of
European Immunology and Pediatric Haemato-Oncology to define the current state of
our knowledge and identify priorities for clinical and research development. We propose
key developmental priorities which our two communities will need to work together to
address, collaborating with colleagues around the world.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with an inborn error of immunity (IEI) or a DNA
repair disorder (DNARD) have a significantly greater risk of
developing malignancies than the general population (1) with
an overall relative risk varying from 1.4- to 5-fold in registrybased studies (2–5). The risk, however, varies greatly between
underlying genetic conditions and within the narrow range
of malignancies seen to occur, with the risk of lymphoid
malignancies overall being 8–10-fold higher than age matched
controls, according to a recent study from the US Immune
Deficiency Network (5). Whilst many of the recognized,
genetically defined IEI are very rare, disease-specific studies
of the more common disorders have shown prevalences of
malignancy to range from 8 to 21% in common variable
immunodeficiency (6–8) to between 19 and 42% in DNARDs
such as ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome
and Bloom syndrome (9–13). International collaboration,
resulting in growing cohorts of patients with more recently
described combined immunodeficiency disorders (14) including
CD27 deficiency (15), CD70 deficiency (16), activated PI3Kδ
and activated PI3Kδ2 syndromes (17, 18) has demonstrated
comparable rates of malignancy, although the risk of case
ascertainment bias must be considered in these very rare patient
groups.
Across the spectrum of IEI/DNARD, lymphoid malignancies
account for 60–70% of diagnoses and disproportionally affect
children when compared to control cohorts (11, 13, 19).
Teams managing patients with IEI/DNARD will recognize that
both clinical and histological diagnosis of malignancy can
be challenging and diagnosis may be delayed, especially in
the setting of pre-existing non-malignant lymphoproliferation.
Similarly, management is often complicated by an increased
incidence of infectious comorbidities and severe, even lifethreatening, toxicities following conventional chemotherapy or
radiotherapy. These factors commonly reduce the intensity of
deliverable treatment. This combination of diagnostic challenge,
increased comorbidity and toxicity, and reduced therapy
intensity results in an inferior outcome for patients, making
malignancy a leading cause of death for this group of patients
(6, 7).
To improve the management of malignancy in patients
affected by IEI/DNARD, we brought together a working
group of representatives from both immunology and lymphoid
malignancy fields to define the current state of knowledge
and identify priorities for research, focusing predominantly
on lymphoid malignancy (Figure 1). We present here our
experience of diagnosing and managing these conditions, with
a focus on the unresolved challenges faced when caring for
this complex patient group. We discuss how our limited
understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis must be
expanded in order to drive the development of improved
diagnostics and more effective and less toxic targeted therapies.
From this we have drawn suggested priorities to be addressed
through clinical and basic research collaborations. Finally, as
our two fields continue to develop an increased understanding
of predisposition to malignancy, we will consider the issue
of identifying an underlying IEI or DNARD in patients with
malignancy as a first clinical presentation.
MECHANISMS OF ONCOGENESIS
There is an established role for a number of infectious agents in
the development of both hematological and non-hematological
malignancies in sporadic as well as IEI associated cases (16,
22–24). Notably, EBV is present in a significant proportion
of lymphoproliferative conditions as well as other soft-tissue
tumors (25). Human papillomaviruses are common in epithelial
malignancies and Helicobacter pylori is associated with both
carcinoma and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the
stomach. Whilst, much is still unknown about the oncogenic
processes these microorganisms modulate, particularly in an
IEI/DNARD background (26), EBV is known to be directly
oncogenic through the LMP1 protein (27). This makes IEI
patients with particular susceptibility to EBV, at a very high risk
of developing cancer. Nevertheless, as the same infectious agent
in two patients with the same underlying condition, even siblings
with identical causative mutations, can result in development of
different malignancies, causation must be more complex than
solely the effect of inadequate control of infection. The additional
role of the host immune system in tumor immunosurveillance,
a concept supported by the effective introduction of immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapies, may well be important, as is
consideration of the cell-intrinsic effects of the underlying
IEI/DNARD, including dysregulated cellular maturation, cell
signaling, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses (21, 28, 29). A
well-known example of these phenomena would be the failure

FIGURE 1 | Outlook on clinical and research needs for malignancies in inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and DNA repair disorders (DNARD). Due to the increased risk
and unfavorable outcome of malignancies in IEI and DNARD, the clinical working party (CWP) and the inborn errors working party (IEWP) of the European Society for
Immunodeficiencies (ESID), of the European group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the European Reference Network on Immunodeficiency,
Autoinflammatory and Autoimmune diseases (ERN-RITA), the host variation task force (Host Var. TF) of the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (iBFM) study group,
and the European Intergroup Collaboration for Childhood non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (EICNHL) formulated six topics with needs and tasks for clinical management and
clinical, translational, and basic scientific research to increase specific knowledge and improve management of these special malignancies; see main text and boxes
for more detailed lists. The red segment depicts an eye with outlook, the spectrum of symptoms of IEI/DNARD, with infections, and, additionally, approximately 25%
patients having autoimmune or autoinflammatory symptoms (20) and 4–25% of patients suffering from malignancies (21), is shown with blurred borders indicating that

of clonally expanded populations to apoptose in patients with
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome–ALPS (30, 31).
Of particular interest is the interplay between these
processes in patients with an underlying DNARD. For these
patients, a number of potentially oncogenic or selective
pressures accumulate, notably (i) DNA damage, especially
during attempted B- and T-cell receptor rearrangement,
immunoglobulin class switching and somatic hypermutation,
(ii) reduced immune repertoire affecting both infectious and
tumor immunosurveillance and (iii) dysregulated immune
development with potential for (pre-)malignant clonal selection.
This is highlighted by the substantially lower rate of tumor EBV
carriage in B lymphoid proliferations in patients with ataxia
telangiectasia compared to patients with other IEI (11). The
relative contributions of these potential oncogenic factors are still
not well-understood. Although our view of cancer susceptibility
in IEI is evolving, much more in depth research will be required
to define the relative importance of each of these potential
causative mechanisms (32).
Currently, the cytogenetic and molecular genetic basis of
malignancy in patients with IEI/DNARD is incompletely defined,
despite the massive increase in genome-wide sequencing and
whole transcriptome technologies over the last 15 years. In
part this is due to the rarity of the individual underlying
patient cohorts. However, there is also a lack of biobanked
diagnostic material of sufficient quality to allow the use of
advanced molecular techniques. This can, at least in part,
be overcome by increasing awareness within immunology
and oncology communities, but collaborative patterns of
working will also accelerate progress in this area (Box 1).
Addressing these challenges is important, as an improved
understanding of the molecular drivers of IEI-associated
malignancy will have significant benefits for patients. Firstly,
mechanistic understanding, exemplified by the studies of
genomic instability in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in
patients with ataxia telangiectasia (33), will elucidate causative
mechanisms. Secondly, it will allow comparison with sporadic
disease, driving rational selection of molecularly targeted

conditions.
MAKING A DIAGNOSIS OF MALIGNANCY
IN IEI/DNARD
Despite an increased awareness of the risk of malignancy
in patients with an underlying IEI or DNARD, making a
definitive diagnosis can be challenging (Box 2). Many patients
have complex co-morbidities, including inflammatory and
infectious conditions often involving atypical organisms, nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation and bone marrow dysfunction.
Each of these may mimic a developing malignancy clinically,
radiologically or histopathologically. These uncertainties can
result in a substantial psychological impact on the patient and
family, a factor which must be borne in mind during the
diagnostic process.
Whilst radiological imaging can define the location and
some features of pathology, current imaging techniques, even
advanced techniques such as diffusion weighted imaging,
MR spectroscopy and PET/CT, are not capable of definitive
differentiation of malignant from non-malignant lesions.
Furthermore, for those patients with a DNARD, there is a
strong rationale for minimizing the use of ionizing radiation,
resulting in understandable hesitance to undertake radiological
investigations. However, in order to prevent excess mortality
from delayed diagnosis it is important that alternative imaging
modalities or limited exposures are used when clinical concerns
of a possible malignancy exist.
Similar challenges exist for the majority of existing
biomarkers. Very few blood or urine-based investigations
are considered adequate for diagnosis of malignancy, with
human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP), urine catecholamines and neurone specific enolase (NSE)
being notable exceptions. Whilst these examples are equally
valid in patients with IEI, they are infrequently relevant in
diagnosis of malignancy in these patients. Cytomorphological
and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood, bone marrow
or effusions can be diagnostic in hematological malignancies,
including lymphoblastic lymphomas and Burkitt lymphoma,
but is commonly more complex than in patients without
an underlying IEI. Other markers of lymphoproliferation,
including lactate dehydrogenase, β2-microglobulin, IgM,
oligoclonal/monoclonal immunoglobulin bands and serum free
light chains, are commonly measured but we lack evidence to
guide their use in supporting diagnosis. They may, however,
have a role to play in monitoring disease following therapy.
Quantitative analysis of EBV in the peripheral blood is also
commonly performed, both during the diagnostic process and as
a marker of response to therapy. Newer technologies developing
the value of so-called liquid biopsies, such as identification of
circulating tumor cells and analysis of cell-free tumor DNA, may
offer the potential for a more integrative diagnostic test, sampling
the “whole” patient, rather than a single lesion and identifying
mutations driving malignant transformation (34). To date, these
remain in early clinical development in mainstream oncology
and have no established role in patients with IEI/DNARD.
Histopathology remains the cornerstone of diagnosing
malignancy. However, even this gold standard approach can be
challenging in patients with IEI, particularly when investigating
for possible lymphoid malignancy. Firstly, judging when to
perform an, often invasive, diagnostic investigation requires
careful multidisciplinary discussion. Targeting the lesion with
the highest likelihood of being diagnostic is a further challenge.
If clinically appropriate, a surgical biopsy providing sufficient
material for assessment of tissue architecture and ancillary
diagnostic techniques is preferred over a needle core biopsy,
but even when high quality material is obtained, histological
diagnosis is often difficult. Many IEI are associated with
non-neoplastic lymphoproliferations which may have specific
characteristic features but together constitute a broad spectrum
of processes, either inflammatory in etiology or resulting
directly from the underlying genetic defect. These lesions
may precede or co-exist with lymphoid malignancies and, in
many settings, diagnostic boundaries between non-neoplastic
and neoplastic lesions are ill-defined and difficult to apply.
Existing molecular techniques to assess lymphocyte clonality
may aid diagnosis, but these alone cannot provide diagnostic
certainty—clonal B-cell and T-cell proliferations falling short of
malignancy are not uncommon in IEI (35). Some polyclonal
proliferations can be clinically aggressive and some clonal
lymphomas respond to immunomodulatory therapies better than
to cytotoxic chemotherapy (36). Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities
may even occasionally be detected in immunodeficiencyassociated lymphoid hyperplasias (37), raising the question
of how to define and assess malignant transformation. In
the future, personalized genomic medicine may address these
challenges, but this must be established on the basis of further
detailed research. Integrating these newer sources of information
and deciphering diagnostic patterns will require a reference
network of specialist pathologists, supported by hematologists
and immunologists.

BOX 2 | Developmental priorities for improving diagnosis and classication of malignancies.
• Improve awareness amongst both immunologists and hematologist/oncologists of the increased risk of malignancy in particular patients with IEI/DNARD.
• Improve diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers with investigation and validation of developing technologies where appropriate.
• Prospective study of malignancies in defined cohorts of IEI/DNARD to include pathological and molecular characterization.
• Consensus diagnostic classification with integration of molecular pathological features with consideration of current and future targeted therapies.
• Develop provisional recommendations for screening cohorts at risk with studies to validate the impact of screening, including the impact on affected and unaffected
family members.
Lymphomas are the most common malignancy associated
with IEI (4, 5). In many cases these are immunohistologically
similar to lymphomas in immunocompetent people and can
be readily diagnosed according to the WHO Classification
of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues (38).
However, other lymphoproliferative disorders arising in
IEI/DNARD patients are not as easily classified and the
WHO Classification does not provide an explicit framework
applicable to the full range of IEI/DNARD-associated tumors
as it does for the post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disorders (PTLD). Nevertheless, as highlighted at a recent
Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European
Association of Haematopathology (39–41), the spectrum
of lymphoproliferative disorders is in many ways similar
across different immunodeficiency settings including IEI
and PTLD, prompting the Workshop Panel recently to
propose a unifying three-part nomenclature incorporating
the histopathological name of the lesion (e.g., hyperplasia,
polymorphic proliferation, lymphoma classified according
to the WHO Classification), any viral association, and the
underlying immunodeficiency background (42). This proposal
has merit in facilitating clinical and biological comparison
between related lesions in conceptually similar contexts
but the tumor heterogeneity seen across individual patients
with the myriad IEI now recognized remains incompletely
defined.
Underpinning this heterogeneity is an almost completely
unknown genomic landscape that is likely to be different between
immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals, and
between individuals with different IEIs, but which must
be incorporated into any future pathological schema. The
importance of this is clear. With the increasing availability
of targeted therapies, both small molecular inhibitors and
immunotherapies, understanding the underlying molecular
biology of individual diseases is a clinical imperative.
One final, but important, consideration is that of screening for
malignancy in patients with known predisposing conditions. This
is a very challenging area, with the need to take account of factors
including level of risk, location of predominant malignancies and
natural history of those malignancies. In essence, each underlying
IEI/DNARD must be considered separately, in keeping with a
number of existing examples (43, 44), with individual validation
of the benefit of screening. This will require the inclusion of large
cohorts of patients with proven IEI with analysis of the incidence
of all malignancies in each cohort. Despite these challenges, there
may be significant benefit to early detection of malignancy, with
the potential to limit treatment intensity and therefore restrict the
consequent toxicity.
MANAGEMENT OF MALIGNANCY IN
IEI/DNARD
In the majority of patients with an underlying IEI/DNARD who
develop cancer, treatment should be offered with the intention
of curing them of their malignancy. However, managing such
a patient must balance offering potentially curative therapy
with the risk of severe and even life-threatening toxicity
(Box 3). This includes not only an increased risk and severity
of expected toxicities, such as haemorrhagic cystitis following
cyclophosphamide in patients with DNARD, but also unexpected
toxicities such as cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity as well as
deterioration of pre-existing comorbidities, especially of renal
and pulmonary function. Examples of excess toxicities are
well-documented in many case reports and series (11, 45–48).
However, what is less well-appreciated from the literature is
the variability in toxicity, even within a single disease cohort,
a rare example of which has been summarized for patients
with Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (49). One approach which
therefore is commonly taken in IEI/DNARD is to apply an
initial dose reduction strategy. This allows for subsequent dose
escalation in patients not showing severe toxicity, as confirmed
by frequent monitoring investigations (13, 47, 50). An alternative
approach is the delivery of full-dose chemotherapy, but with
increased intervals between cycles to allow optimal recovery from
toxicity. Finally, protocol substitutions may be considered, with
alternative agents being used in certain circumstances such as
the substitution of topoisomerase inhibitors in DNARD patients.
Specifically introducing novel, non-genotoxic therapies is a very
attractive concept and is discussed further below. The risk is
that substitution with less intensive or alternative therapies may
result in under treatment and failure to achieve the primary
aim, which is the cure of malignancy. Equally, whilst targeted
therapies are hoped to carry less risk of toxicity, there is little
clinical experience with anything other than rituximab to support
this to date.
Many IEI and some examples of DNARD are suitable for
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
and this may form a core component of the management of
their underlying condition. Many centers would consider HSCT
in first remission as a consolidative treatment following
cytoreductive chemotherapy, with the added benefit of
addressing the underlying predisposition disorder. However,

BOX 3 | Developmental priorities for the treatment of malignancy including HSCT.
• Improve understanding of cancer therapy-associated toxicities, including predictive biomarkers for toxicity
• Develop consensus guidelines for initial therapy and dose modification, dependent on underlying IEI/DNARD.
• Prospective studies addressing the timing and delivery of HSCT dependant on underlying IEI/DNARD.
• Prospective studies of the true burden of therapy on subsequent quality of life and life expectancy to guide treatment strategy decision making.
• Develop guidelines for supportive care.
there are currently a number of key unanswered questions in
this area, including the state of response required prior to HSCT
(partial remission vs. complete remission), optimal conditioning
strategy (myeloablative vs. reduced intensity), value as salvage for
refractory/recurrent malignancy and the potentially increased
risk of secondary, second primary or relapsed malignancy
post-transplant.
For those IEI/DNARD where transplantation is not
immediately indicated, pre-emptive HSCT might be suitable for
patients with a particularly high risk of developing a malignancy.
This approach will require improved risk stratification
and development of appropriate biomarkers. Furthermore,
prolonged follow-up is required to validate outcomes of children
whose risk of pediatric malignancy is reduced, but who then may
continue to be at risk of other disease manifestations including
an adult cancer spectrum. This is particularly true for children
with DNARD (51) who, despite the use of modified conditioning
regimens, may be at substantial ongoing risk of complications
including non-haematopoietic malignancy.
In addition to chemotherapy, which provides the current
mainstay of malignancy therapy, and HSCT, a core component
of curing underlying IEI, patients require an intensive package
of supportive care measures, both to allow maximal intensity
of treatment delivery and to ensure minimal deterioration in
baseline organ function. Dependent on the specific underlying
IEI/DNARD, particular attention should be paid to surveillance
for and management of infection, with many clinicians
opting to keep a patient hospitalized for the duration of their
cancer treatment. Upgraded supportive care strategies include
more intensive immunological monitoring and wide-ranging
microbiological diagnostics as well as consideration of supportive
intravenous immunoglobulin, prophylactic antibiotics and
haematopoietic growth factors. Episodes of presumed or
confirmed infections require aggressive combinatorial broad
spectrum antimicrobials, as with all patients receiving cytotoxic
chemotherapy, but the duration of therapy may need to be
extended and obligate bactericidal agents may be warranted.
Particular attention must be paid to patients’ nutrition to
maximize recovery as well as to maintain intestinal integrity,
minimizing translocation of intestinal organisms. Physiotherapy
involvement is critical to reduce the risk of long-term respiratory
deterioration from infection and to rapidly identify and manage
musculoskeletal and neurological complications. Finally, clinical
psychology support provides essential support for patients and
families performing complex joint decision making which must
address the balances of risks and benefits described above.
NOVEL THERAPIES
The significant burden of toxicity seen in patients with
IEI/DNARD following treatment with, particularly genotoxic,
chemotherapy argues strongly in favor of the investigation of
alternative anti-cancer treatment strategies. Existing alternatives,
developed for the mainstream oncology market, rely on
a range of effector mechanisms which would need to be
carefully evaluated in each underlying IEI. This will be
particularly important for the immune modulating therapies
including checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapies
(Table 1). This presents substantial challenges, not least the
relative infrequency of cancer diagnoses in patients with
rare predisposing conditions. Additionally, the complex
combinations of pre-existing co-morbidities would make
defining tolerability very difficult in an acceptable early phase
trial setting. Conducting unbiased clinical trials of novel therapies
in specific patient cohorts will therefore be restricted to very few
conditions.
Despite these difficulties, the potential impact of targeted
drugs is substantial, as has already been seen with the anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody rituximab which has been used routinely
as a single agent therapy in the management of PTLD for
many years. Whilst achieving cure with single targeted agents
has proven uncommon in general hematology/oncology, patients
with IEI may prove more amenable to a strategy in which
a targeted, low toxicity drug provides cytoreductive therapy
prior to curative HSCT. This would still require a detailed
understanding of the driving oncogenic mechanisms, biomarkers
predicting response to therapy and potential mechanisms of
resistance (Box 4). Developing a collaborative network of groups
able to model the relevant disease process would allow for preclinical drug testing prior to developing a clinical strategy. Whilst
randomized prospective clinical trials may be unrealistic, the
need to investigate alternative therapies in these very high risk
patient groups argues in favor of developing common treatment
strategies with structured prospective collection of toxicity
and outcome data within specific underlying IEI/DNARD
cohorts.
SCREENING FOR IEI IN NEW
MALIGNANCY CASES

all childhood cancer cases are the result of an underlying cancer
predisposition syndrome (52–54). A significant proportion of
these are not previously known to the family, but can be

identified using screening approaches such as exome/genome
family trio sequencing with recently identified complex patterns
of inheritance identified (55, 56). Consequently, amongst all
oncology patients there will be a proportion of patients carrying
a previously undiagnosed IEI/DNARD. Given the increased risk
of acute toxicity and infection as well as the need to address
family counseling, especially with a perspective toward HSCT,
identifying and investigating such patients presents an important
part of their holistic care (Box 5).
In most centers consideration of immunological screening
investigations has traditionally been based on the presence of
additional clinical features including (i) a personal history of
infections, co-morbidities, developmental delay or congenital
abnormalities; (ii) a family history of known inherited conditions,
strong infectious or cancer history or a consanguineous parental
relationship; or (iii) unusual presentations of malignancy. The
latter group may include rare tumors such as extranodal marginal
zone lymphoma or peripheral T cell lymphoma in a child (57, 58),
unusual background histopathological findings, unusual sites of
disease (primary central nervous system lymphoma in a child)
(59), or unusual characteristic cyto-/molecular genetics, our
understanding of which is currently in its infancy (33). Having
made a diagnosis of malignancy, the presence or occurrence of
unusual infections, in terms of severity, organism or frequency,
or of severe or unusual therapy associated toxicity may raise the
suspicion of an underlying predisposition syndrome.
An alternative approach which is being used more frequently,
and will soon be included in a number of international late

phase oncology clinical trials, is the use of predisposition
screening tools for newly diagnosed cancers, most notably in
children (60, 61). These have been developed primarily as
decision support tools to identify higher risk patients who
should be referred to expert genetic counseling and consideration
of targeted or genome wide investigation. However, specific
screening for immune disorders as a causative underlying cancer
predisposition mechanism is rarely included.
For patients in whom an increased concern regarding an
underlying IEI/DNARD exists, determining the optimal time and
approach to screening can be challenging. Standard laboratory
investigations for underlying IEI/DNARD can be hard to
interpret at diagnosis of malignancy as a result of the patient’s
general clinical state, the presence of infection and fever, and, for
haematopoietic malignancies, involvement of the bone marrow.
Investigation during and immediately following treatment is
affected by anti-cancer therapy, including both traditional
chemotherapy and agents targeting haematopoietic/lymphoid
surface markers including CD20, CD22, CD30, and CD52
(Table 1). Direct assessment of the presence of an underlying
disorder might involve radiosensitivity studies, DNA damage
assays or, increasingly, genetic screening for known IEI/DNARD
associated mutations using constitutional DNA samples. With
the increasing availability of routine paired cancer/germline
and family trio genome sequencing, this approach is likely
to become more important and may bypass the challenges
of more classical cellular and functional testing. However,
implementation of genomic medicine at the clinical level will
require dedicated analyses to be developed and probably more
widespread training in interpretation and counseling to allow for
immediate treatment stratification by clinicians.
CONCLUSION
Despite a growing awareness of the increased risk of malignancy
in people with IEI/DNARD, the diagnosis and management of
these patients remain poorly understood and thus challenging
and are frequently based on correlation with sporadic
malignancies rather than dedicated IEI/DNARD specific
guidance. In order to improve this situation, diagnostic
and clinical teams caring for patients with IEI/DNARD
will need to work in collaborative groups and international
networks in order to bring together sufficient cases,
experience and understanding. This first meeting of ESID,
EBMT, RITA, iBFM, and EICNHL represents an example
of such a collaborative initiative. Having developed this
(non-exhaustive) list of developmental priorities, it is now
important to broaden collaborations in order to maximize
achievements that will allow improvement in patient care and
outcomes.
