Clinically significant carbon dioxide embolism is a rare but potentially fatal complication of anesthesia administered during laparoscopic surgery. Its most common 
cause is inadvertent injection of carbon dioxide into a large vein, artery or solid organ. This error usually occurs during or shortly after insufflation of carbon dioxide 
into the body cavity, but may result from direct intravascular insufflation of carbon 
dioxide during surgery. Clinical presentation of carbon dioxide embolism ranges 
from asymptomatic to neurologic injury, cardiovascular collapse or even death, 
which is dependent on the rate and volume of carbon dioxide entrapment and the 
patient’s condition. We reviewed extensive literature regarding carbon dioxide embolism in detail and set out to describe the complication from background to treatment. We hope that the present work will improve our understanding of carbon dioxide embolism during laparoscopic surgery. 
Key Words: Carbon dioxide, embolism, laparoscopy, pneumoperitoneum
INTRODUCTION
Laparoscopy has become a routine method for diagnosis and treatment of gynecological and intra-abdominal diseases. To do so requires insufflation of carbon dioxide for accurate visualization and operative manipulation. Consequently, carbon 
dioxide embolism may arise therefrom. Carbon dioxide embolism is a rare but potentially serious complication of laparoscopic procedures.1
 It is caused by entrapment of carbon dioxide in an injured vein, artery or solid organ, and results in 
blockage of the right ventricle (RV) or pulmonary artery.2 There have been reports 
of carbon dioxide emboli occurring in various procedures including laparoscopic 
appendectomy,3 laparoscopic cholecystectomy,4-7 endoscopy,8 hysteroscopy,9 and 
other gynecological laparoscopic surgeries.10-13 Recently, carbon dioxide emboli 
have also been reported to occur during laparoscopic nephrectomy,14 laparoscopic 
hepatectomy,15 endoscopic vein harvesting,16,17 endoscopic thyroidectomy,18 and 
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.19
Here we provide an extensive literature review regarding carbon dioxide embolism in detail, and describe the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, 
prevention, and treatment of carbon dioxide embolism during laparoscopic surgery.

Gas embolism was observed in all patients undergoing total 
laparoscopic hysterectomy, and 37.5% of patients had grades 
higher than III (Fig. 1). No patient in this study showed hemodynamic instability or electrocardiogram changes at the 
time of venous air embolism (VAE) occurrence. Most instances of VAE during total laparoscopic hysterectomy 
(TLH) occurred during transection of the round ligament 
and dissection of the broad ligament. 
In several cases, clinical carbon dioxide as a diagnosis 
was only reported in the medical or hospital record when 
some provocative medical intervention occurred. Less significant cases of embolism may only have been historically 
maintained as a comment in the specific anesthetic record, 
which were likely not individually reviewed in a large case 
series. Thus, the real “clinical incidence” of carbon dioxide 
embolism is likely higher than that reported by these series.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, CLINICAL 
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Carbon dioxide is the most widely used insufflation gas. 
Most serious cases of carbon dioxide embolism reported in 
the literature occurred at the beginning of the procedure due 
to misplacement of the Veres needle directly into a vein or 
parenchymal organ. Smaller amounts of carbon dioxide may 
also enter circulation through an opening in injured vessels, 
either in the abdominal wall or at the operative site,13,24 which 
may be one of the mechanisms that can explain the late onset 
of carbon dioxide embolism.
Carbon dioxide is well-suited for creating a pneumoperitoneum because it is chemically inert, colorless, inexpenINCIDENCE
Although the occurrence of clinically significant carbon dioxide embolism is rare, the incidence of any kind of carbon 
dioxide embolism is varied (Table 1). Brühl20 reviewed 
63,845 laparoscopies for liver biopsies and found only one 
case of gas embolism among 1,594 serious complications. 
In 1974, Phillips, et al.10 reported 15 probable carbon dioxide emboli among 113,253 gynecologic laparoscopies performed in one year. Hynes and Marshall11 found seven cases 
of carbon dioxide embolism out of 1,194 gynecologic laparoscopic procedures, representing an incidence of 0.59%. In 
a recent meta-analysis of nearly 500,000 closed-entry laparoscopies, carbon dioxide emboli occurred in seven out of 
489,335 laparoscopic procedures (0.001%).21 Mintz22 reported three fatal carbon dioxide emboli in a review of 100,000 
laparoscopies in France in 1977. Notwithstanding, clinically significant carbon dioxide emboli may be fatal, and the 
reported mortality rate is 28%.3
Recently, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has 
been used to monitor for carbon dioxide embolism. Fahy, et 
al.14 also detected one episode of gas embolism with TEE 
out of 16 healthy kidney donors during laparoscopic nephrectomy. Lin, et al.23 identified carbon dioxide emboli in 
69 out of 403 patients (17.1%) during endoscopic saphenous 
vein harvesting during coronary artery bypass surgery with 
TEE monitoring. Minimal, moderate, and massive carbon dioxide emboli occurred in 53 (13.1%), 14 (3.5%), and 2 
(0.5%) patients, respectively. Recently, in our lab, Kim, et 
al.13 reported the incidence and grade of carbon dioxide embolism during total laparoscopic hysterectomy using TEE.

ume of carbon dioxide that may be infused into a vein, intentionally cannulated by a Veres needle, in one minute at a 
low-flow rate.32
Carbon dioxide embolism can manifest itself through a 
“gas lock” effect, causing obstruction to RV ejection, right 
and left cardiac failure, paradoxical embolism with or without patent foramen ovale, arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse.16
Because of its high blood solubility, carbon dioxide causes 
similar but less marked effects than those produced by air. 
Carbon dioxide embolism does not produce the bronchoconstriction or changes in pulmonary compliance that are 
caused by air embolism.33 Clinically, carbon dioxide embolism can present with systemic hypotension, dyspnea, cyasive, readily available, and less combustible than air. Carbon dioxide is highly soluble in blood (Table 2),25 which 
allows rapid absorption into the blood stream across the 
peritoneum.26 At the same time, carbon dioxide can cause 
hypercapnea, metabolic acidosis, cardiorespiratory compromise, and greater postoperative pain as well as having adverse effects on intraperitoneal immune function, even increasing the risk of port-site tumor metastases in experimental 
models.27 Consequently, alternative gases have been investigated to reduce negative side effects.26-30 
The clinical effects of carbon dioxide embolism depend 
on the balance between the volume of carbon dioxide entering circulation and the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed.27 Dion, et al.31 reported that a mean of 300 mL carbon dioxide was necessary to cause the death of a 35 kg 
dog. If this figure is extrapolated to a 70 kg human, a volume of 600 mL could potentially cause death. However, a 
study that infused carbon dioxide into the left jugular vein 
in 89 dogs (5.1-9.7 kg) extrapolated that the lethal dose for 
50% of the subjects (LD50) for a 70 kg human was 1,750 
mL carbon dioxide.28 Mayer, et al.32 described a mortality of 
60% at a continuous intravenous carbon dioxide infusion rate 
of 1.2 mL/kg/min, which is equivalent to a rate of 72 mL/
min for a 60 kg person. That volume is only 5% of the volFig. 1. Carbon dioxide emboli detected by transesophageal echocardiography in a patient undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy;

dogs only after injection of a 100 mL bolus of air, whereas 
TEE identified all bolus injections of 15 mL of air. TEE 
monitoring has also been increasingly used for the diagnosis 
for carbon dioxide embolism during endoscopic saphenous 
vein harvesting in coronary artery bypass surgery.16,17,23
Because administration of fluid and pharmacologic agents 
during surgical intervention causes some turbulent flow, 
which stimulates gas bubbles in the right atrium, the traditional TEE view of the right atrium is not ideal for monitoring for the appearance of carbon dioxide bubbles. Therefore, 
the transgastric inferior vena cava view has been utilized to 
solve this problem.17,23 TEE has clearly demonstrated carbon dioxide originating from the inferior vena cava, as well 
as gas in the RV and main pulmonary artery, documented 
RV failure, interventricular septal shift toward the left ventricle, and a decrease in left ventricular dimensions.16
The disadvantages of TEE include high cost, technical 
complexity, and the need for constant operator attention.38
Transesophageal Doppler 
Transesophageal Doppler has recently emerged as an optimal means of gas embolus detection. It is easier and much 
less expensive to use routinely, and it is nearly as sensitive as 
TEE. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy in pigs, transesophageal Doppler was found to be a highly sensitive monitor that provided earlier detection of carbon dioxide emboli 
at lower doses than ETCO2 monitoring. This method demonstrated 100% sensitivity in detecting 0.1 mL/kg emboli.38
Precordial Doppler
Precordial Doppler was initially introduced as a simple and 
highly sensitive device for detecting venous air emboli.39
However, although Wadhwa, et al.40 monitored 100 patients 
undergoing laparoscopic procedures with a Doppler ultrasonic instrument, they reported no incidence of carbon dinosis, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, or asystole. A 
“mill-wheel” murmur also can be ausculated. Carbon dioxide embolism may increase or decrease end-tidal carbon dioxide tension.24 Other effects include elevated pulmonary 
arterial pressure (PAP), elevated central venous pressure, 
hypoxemia, and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon 
dioxide (Table 3).27
The relationship between carbon dioxide embolism and 
the interplay of different pressures (intro-abdominal, thoracic, cardiac, and venous) existing during laparoscopic surgeries has not been extensively studied. Peritoneal insufflation 
to intra-abdominal pressures higher than 10 mm Hg induces 
significant alterations of hemodynamics.34,35 Such hemodynamic changes might be caused by pneumoperitoneum, patient position, hypercapnia, or the carbon dioxide embolism 
itself. Adequate peritoneal insufflation below 10 mm Hg 
may decrease the incidence of carbon dioxide embolism. 
DIAGNOSIS
TEE
TEE has been established as the most sensitive method for 
detecting intravenous injection of carbon dioxide as small 
as 0.1 mL/kg when compared with ETCO2, pulmonary artery pressure, and precordial auscultation, which has a similar threshold of 0.5 mL/kg.36 In another study, TEE detected 
gas emboli of 0.02 mL (0.0007 mL/kg) boluses, and was 50 
to 100 times as sensitive to the presence of emboli, after bolus injection, as ETCO2.
37 Studies with TEE probes identified subclinical gas emboli in 11 of 16 patients (68%) undergoing laparoscopic cholecyctectomy,4
 but no emboli were 
reported when precordial Doppler ultrasonography was 
used in 61 patients undergoing the same procedure.5 Dion, 
et al.31 identified a change in pulmonary artery pressure in

ter bolus injection of 15 mL carbon dioxide, while it took a 
bolus injection of 100 mL carbon dioxide to cause a significant increase in PAP.31 The mean PAP rose by ≥3 mm Hg 
after bolus injection of 0.76±0.33 mL/kg of carbon dioxide 
in pigs.36 During laparoscopic liver resection in nine pigs 
after injection of 0.4 mL/kg of carbon dioxide, the mean 
PAP increased gradually over the entire four-hour study period. Pulmonary cardiac wedge pressure was fairly stable, 
varying between 6 and 8 mm Hg. Pulmonary venous resistance increased during the first 20 min, then remained stable. Cardiac output decreased during the first 15 min, then 
stayed constant during the rest of the study period.47
Schmandra, et al.15 observed a rise in mean PAP during 
laparoscopic liver resection, but the changes were not significant. There was, however, a significant increase in pulmonary cardiac wedge pressure with a significant decrease 
in cardiac output. Mayer, et al.32 reported an immediate 
three-fold increase above the baseline in mean PAP upon 
intravenous infusion of carbon dioxide, particularly in the 
high infusion rate group. Assuming that this increase in mean 
PAP can be entirely explained by a mechanical obstruction, 
mean PAP more closely approximates the residual degree 
of pulmonary vascular obstruction and circulatory compromise. The mean PAP returned to the basal level 9.9±3.3 
min after a 1 mL/kg injection of carbon dioxide, which was 
shorter than the time required for the mean PAP to return to 
basal levels after a 1 mL/kg injection of air (15.3±2.1 min).48
PREVENTION
Preventive measures can be taken at the time of surgery in 
an effort to avoid carbon dioxide emboli. To avoid massive 
infusion of carbon dioxide intravenously, correct positioning of the Veres needle must be assured. This can be accomplished by aspiration prior to insufflation or test inflation of 
a few mL of carbon dioxide. Use of low insufflation pressure during laparoscopic surgery is also very important to 
preventing carbon dioxide emboli.3
An increase in central venous pressure to a level permanently exceeding the intraperitoneal pressure may be appropriate for reducing the risk of carbon dioxide embolism.15
The reverse Trendelenburg position has been known to 
decrease the incidence of gas embolism,49 and head-down 
positioning may also reduce the migration of gas bubbles to 
the head because the bubbles are naturally buoyant. Positive end-expiratory pressure may decrease the pressure graoxide embolism. In another study,5
 no carbon dioxide embolism was detected on precordial Doppler ultrasonography 
in 61 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
The Doppler transducer is usually placed in the parasternal 
area at the fourth intercostal space overlying the RA. Despite the precordial Doppler’s ease of placement and sensitivity, it is an imperfect method because it is not quantitative, and its false negative rate due to position of probe.41
ETCO2 
ETCO2 monitoring has been suggested as a sensitive and 
noninvasive means of detecting gas embolism.42 However, 
carbon dioxide embolism can cause either an increase or a 
decrease in ETCO2.
24 Several reports have described a rise 
in ETCO2,
11,42 where a continuously recorded ETCO2 concentration increased abruptly from 3.8 to 4.2% in carbon 
dioxide embolism patients who were diagnosed on the basis of a sudden abrupt onset of systolic and diastolic murmurs during laparoscopy.42
Diakun43 detailed the temporal association of cardiovascular collapse with an abrupt increase in ETCO2. Most reports, however, described significant decreases in ETCO2
with clinical episodes of carbon dioxide embolism.6-8,23,44 A 
small transient rise in ETCO2 follows larger boluses, probably caused by an increase in the carbon dioxide dissolved in 
the blood. Rapid decrease in ETCO2 is caused by obstruction of some of the pulmonary vasculature by emboli, expanding the ventilatory dead space.37 Couture, et al.36 found 
that, regardless of the mode of administration of carbon dioxide (bolus or infusion), the first response to carbon dioxide embolism was a decrease in ETCO2. 
Precordial or esophageal stethoscope
There have been several reports of “mill-wheel” precordial 
murmurs: a loud, harsh, churning, tickling, splashing metallic sound, which are usually noted concomitantly with cardiovascular collapse.11,12,45,46 However, these signs are inconsistent. A recent review of seven episodes of carbon dioxide 
embolism during laparoscopy revealed that a “mill-wheel” 
murmur was reported by fewer than half of the patients. It 
was not specifically sought out in the other cases because of 
the rapidity of cardiac events.3 Brundin, et al.9 reported that 
the typical metallic heart sounds were noted during hysteroscopy in 10% of cases. 
PAP monitoring

ed as needed to maintain oxygenation of vital organs.12,53-56
The most important causes of life-threatening carbon dioxide emboli are right heart failure caused by gas lock created 
by entrapped carbon dioxide bubbles in the heart, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and subsequent left ventricular failure due to left ventricular filling defects. The treatment of 
life-threatening carbon dioxide emboli includes administration of vasopressors and inotropic agents to maintain cardiac output and the use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation to maintain hemodynamic stability.23 Vasodilators can 
also be used to treat increased pulmonary vasoconstriction 
and to reduce RV afterload when hypotension is not present.2
 Prostaglandin analogues or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be considered for treatment of severe pulmonary 
hypertension. One case report described the use of inhaled 
epoprostenol to treat pulmonary hypertension caused by a 
carbon dioxide embolism.16
Cardiopulmonary bypass has also been successfully used 
to support patients with emboli.43 If a patient remains unstable, emergency thoracotomy with internal cardiac massage 
and aspiration should be considered to facilitate movement 
of the gas from the heart.7,8
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is reportedly useful for treating carbon dioxide emboli, especially for the neurologic 
deficits caused by cerebral gas emboli. Hyperbaric compression reduces bubble size (one-third of the original volume at three atmospheres), restores blood flow, and limits 
detrimental effects of the gas-blood interface. Other potential beneficial effects include a reduction in intracranial 
pressure and increased tissue oxygenation via diffusion.57
Reust, et al.58 reported that repeated TEE showed clearance 
of large carbon dioxide bubbles in the coronary artery after 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for 
carbon dioxide emboli is less useful than for air emboli, because carbon dioxide is more soluble. Also, there is a higher 
pressure gradient between the blood and carbon dioxide bubbles (over 600 mm Hg), which encourages reabsorption.23
Complications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy include barotrauma (particularly to the ear and sinuses), pulmonary oxygen toxicity, decompression sickness, and seizures.59
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to thank the publisher of Anesthesiology and 
the authors (Kim et al., Anesthesiology 2009; 111) for giving us permission to adapt their figures (Fig. 1). Also, we 
dient between a vessel opening and the heart, thus reducing 
the likelihood of gas entry.14
TREATMENT
When a carbon dioxide embolism is suspected, a series of 
measures must be immediately performed (Table 4). Initially, insufflation should be discontinued with release of the 
pneumoperitoneum. The patient should be ventilated with 
100% oxygen in order to wash out carbon dioxide and improve ventilation perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Discontinuing nitrous oxide will allow 100% oxygen to be administered, but will not reduce the size of a carbon dioxide 
embolus the way it would an air embolus. This difference is 
due to the similarity in the solubility of nitrous oxide and 
carbon dioxide in blood, which prevents significant diffusion of nitrous oxide into or out of the carbon dioxide bubbles.50 Hyperventilation increases carbon dioxide excretion. 
Aggressive volume expansion may reduce further gas 
entry by elevating central venous pressure.7 The patient 
should be placed in a steep-head down, left-lateral decubitus (Durant’s) position in order to allow gas bubbles to rise 
to the apex of the RA and to prevent entry into the pulmonary artery.51 The Trendelenburg position can also decrease 
the risk of gas traveling to the head. Insertion of a BuneginAlbin multi-orifice central venous or pulmonary artery catheter may allow aspiration of gas from the RA or RV, provide 
a quicker diagnosis, and significantly improve hemodynamic 
status by relieving gas lock in the RA or RV.8,52
Vital signs should be continuously assessed, and supportive 
measures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be initiatTable 4. Management of Carbon Dioxide Emboli
