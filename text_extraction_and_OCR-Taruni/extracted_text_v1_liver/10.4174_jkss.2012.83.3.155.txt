Purpose: Many surgical patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), resulting in an increased demand, and possible 
waste, of resources. Patients who undergo liver resection are also transferred postoperatively to the ICU. However, this may 
not be necessary in all cases. This study was designed to assess the necessity of ICU admission. Methods: The medical records 
of 313 patients who underwent liver resections, as performed by a single surgeon from March 2000 to December 2010 were 
retrospectively reviewed. Results: Among 313 patients, 168 patients (53.7%) were treated in the ICU. 148 patients (88.1%) received only observation during the ICU care. The ICU re-admission and intensive medical treatment significantly correlated 
with major liver resection (odds ratio [OR], 6.481; P = 0.011), and intraoperative transfusions (OR, 7.108; P = 0.016). Patients 
who underwent major liver resection and intraoperative transfusion were significantly associated with need for mechanical 
ventilator care, longer postoperative stays in the ICU and the hospital, and hospital mortality. Conclusion: Most patients admitted to the ICU after major liver resection just received close monitoring. Even though patients underwent major liver resection, patients without receipt of intraoperative transfusion could be sent to the general ward. Duration of ICU/hospital 
stay, ventilator care and mortality significantly correlated with major liver resection and intraoperative transfusion. Major 
liver resection and receipt of intraoperative transfusions should be considered indicators for ICU admission.

INTRODUCTION
Surgery in patients with chronic liver disease has a 
higher morbidity and mortality than surgery in patients 
without chronic liver disease [1]. The risks associated with 
surgery are particularly high in patients with diseases of 
the hepatobiliary system requiring major liver resection 
[2,3]. Because of improvements in the understanding of 
hepatic anatomy and surgical techniques, outcomes of liver resection have improved [4] with posthepatectomy 
mortality at less than 5% [5,6]. Postoperative management 
is one of the contributors to the reduction of morbidity and 
mortality. Key elements of perioperative management include appropriate nutritional support [7], respiratory assistance, infusion of fluid and blood components [8], and 
liver medications [9].

To reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality, aggressive monitoring of patients, early detection of life 
threatening complications, and immediate therapeutic interventions are important. Comprehensive monitoring in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) facilitates all of these elements of care [10]. On the other hand, many surgical patients are admitted to the ICU, resulting in an increased 
demand, and possible waste, of resources [11,12]. Hence, 
selective admission of surgical patients to the ICU has 
been suggested [13-15]. Bastounis et al. [16] evaluated the 
need for ICU admission among patients who have undergone vascular surgery. However, studies on the necessity 
of ICU admission among posthepatectomy patients have 
not been reported, to our knowledge. 
The aim of this study was to assess the necessity of ICU 
care and suggest guidelines for determining ICU admission in these patients.
METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 313 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent 
liver resection, as performed by a single surgeon from 
March 2000 to December 2010. The Child-Pugh class of all 
patients except one was “A” class. The extent of liver resection was determined according to the indigocyanine 
green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICG R15) results and tumor characteristics. When there were poor prognostic 
characteristics following as presence of vascular invasion, 
satellite nodule and infiltrative type, we performed more 
wide resection within the limit of residual liver functions. 
Patients admitted to the ICU directly, without admission 
to a general ward after liver resection, were placed in the 
ICU group. Patients admitted from surgery to a general 
ward were placed in the non-ICU group.
Definitions
Body mass index (BMI) was divided into 4 categories according to the World Health Organization classifications 
for underweight (＜18.5), normal (18.5 to 25), overweight 
(25 to 30), and obese (＞30). Major liver resection was defined as resection of more than three segments of the 
Couinaud. Intraoperative transfusion included only red 
blood cell transfusion. Among complications, ascites and 
pleural effusions that occurred as surgical complications 
but resolved with medical management and without 
drainage were not considered complications in the analysis; only those requiring intervention were considered 
complications. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 
scores were calculated according to the formula used by 
Freeman [17] Intensive treatments in ICU did not include 
only vital sign monitoring, but inotrophics use with close 
monitoring for maintaining blood pressure, hyperoxygenation for improving low oxygen saturation and 
continuous renal replacement therapy for treating acute 
renal failure. 
Outcomes 
Clinical and operative characteristics were compared 
between the ICU and non-ICU groups. Predictive factors 
for intensive treatments and the ICU re-admission were 
analyzed. Postoperative course was re-analyzed according to subgroups with/without having predictive factors. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS ver. 
15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All continuous variables are presented as median (range), and categorical variables are presented as percentages of affected patients. A 
univariate analysis of the characteristics in each group was 
conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous 
variables and the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for 
categorical variables. For predictive factor of special care 
and the ICU re-admission, multiple logistic regression 
analysis was used in univariate and multivariate analyses. 
P-values ＜ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Table 2. Operative and postoperative characteristics according to 
intensive care unit (ICU) stay
168 patients (53.7%) were treated in the ICU. In both 
groups, males predominated and normal weight was most 
common. Hepatitis B virus was the most common cause of 
the underlying liver disease. The American Association of 
Anesthetists (ASA) score was 2 in 77 patients (53.1%) of the 
non-ICU group and 89 patients (53%) of the ICU group. 
Preoperative MELD score and ICG R15 were significantly 
higher in the ICU group than those in the non-ICU group. 
Operative and postoperative characteristics 
Major liver resection was performed more frequently in 
the ICU group (117 patients, 69.6%; P = 0.031). Median operation time and estimated blood loss in the ICU group 
were 326 minutes and 900 mL. The rate of intraoperative 
transfusion in the ICU group was higher, such as 91 patients (54.2%), than that (21 patients, 14.5%) in the non-ICU 
group (P ＜ 0.001) (Table 2). Among both groups, non-tumor liver pathology did not show a significant difference. 
Median postoperative hospital stay (13 days) in the ICU 
group was significantly higher than that (10 days) in the 
non-ICU group (P = 0.001) (Table 2).
Predictive factors of intensive treatment and ICU 
re-admission
Among 313 patients, 22 patients (7%) received intensive 
treatments in the ICU group or readmitted to the ICU because of hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary edema, variceal bleeding and re-operation. 148 patients (88.1%) in the 
ICU group did not received any intensive treatments and 
were only observed in the ICU. 
Intensive treatment and the ICU re-admission were 
closely associated with followings in univariate analysis:

DISCUSSION
Most patients with liver cancer experience deteriorated 
liver function due to malignancy and/or underlying 
disease. In such cases, the risk of morbidity and mortality 
after liver resection is increased [2,3,18]. Therefore, the risk 
of surgery due to co-morbidity and underlying diseases 
should be assessed carefully prior to surgery, and the extent and technique for surgery should be optimized 
accordingly. In addition, postoperative care at the ICU level should be considered to provide adequate observation 
of vital signs and signs of potentially life-threatening 
complications. Preoperative liver function and general 
physical status were assessed using the Child-Pugh class 
[19,20] and ASA score [21], and residual liver function using ICG R15 [22]. The risk of surgery according to these 
tests has been well known, and the results of such evaluation are of help in determining the appropriateness and 
extent of surgery. However, guidelines for ICU vs. general-ward admission after hepatectomy have not been 
established.
The concept of the ICU was introduced in 1801 in the 
Newcastle Infirmary, England, to provide a space for seriously sick patients or patients undergoing major surgery 
[23]. In the 1900s, the ICU developed into a space for selective patients, and in 1923, the first ICU was built in the 
department of neurosurgery [24]. After the introduction of 
the coronary ICU in the 1960s, mortality of acute myocardial infarction was reduced by approximately 20% 
[25]. However, the ICU has been used excessively in caring 
for postoperative patients and, thus, has been considered 
a waste of resources and a contributing factor to unnecessarily long hospital stays in many cases [11,12]. In 
fact, some studies indicated that selective admission to the 
ICU reduced hospital stays and costs without an apparent 
adverse effect on postoperative morbidity and mortality. 
These studies then suggested guidelines for determining 
which postoperative patients should be admitted to the 
ICU [13-15]. In addition, efforts have been made to establish general guidelines for admission to and discharge 
from the ICU [26]. Such guidelines have been developed 
by the American College of Critical Care Medicine and the 
Society of Critical Care Medicine. Indicators for ICU admission for postoperative patients were a need for ventilator support, chronic co-morbidities that may develop 
into acute severe medical or surgical illnesses, and shock

or hemodynamic instability [26]. However, many postoperative patients (70 to 76%) undergo monitoring only 
while in the ICU. This applies to posthepatectomy patients 
among others. In previous studies, those patients were defined as low-risk monitor (LRM) patients and “too well to 
benefit.”
In our study, most patients (148/168 patients, 88.1%) in 
the ICU group underwent monitoring only. This finding 
suggests that all patients after liver resection may not need 
admission to the ICU, and the patients who are admitted 
to the general ward did not need ICU-level care. However, 
the LRM patients are not no-risk patients and guidelines 
for admission to the ICU in posthepatectomy patients may 
be needed. Even though the guidelines mentioned earlier 
suggest that co-morbidities indicate a need for ICU admission, co-morbidities were not associated with intensive 
treatment and ICU re-admission. Another study reported 
that co-morbidities did not affect the early outcomes of liver resection [27].
Advanced age was one of the limitations for surgery. 
However, according to some studies, morbidity and mortality after liver resection do not differ significantly between patients older or younger than 70 years [28]. In our 
study, similarly, intensive treatment and the ICU re-admission were not associated with age. 
The presence of intraoperative transfusions and major 
liver resection were closely related with intensive treatment and ICU re-admission in univariate and multivariate 
analysis. Major liver resection was the most common 
cause of posthepatectomy liver failure. It was the most serious complication in the patients who underwent liver 
resection. This complication increased the cost markedly 
[29]. Intraoperative transfusion may affect not only oncologic outcomes but also morbidity [30]. In our study, 
Positive group underwent major liver resection and received intraoperative transfusion showing long ICU stay 
and postoperative hospital stay. They experienced more 
much postoperative ventilator care and mortality than 
negative group. 
In conclusion, prior to surgery, it is very difficult to determine the need for postoperative ICU admission. If the 
following conditions are met, some patients need not be 
admitted to the ICU after hepatectomy: adequate preoperative assessment is performed, the extent and technique of the surgery are appropriately selected, and major 
intraoperative problems do not occur. However, patients 
who undergo major liver resection and intraoperative 
transfuision may need to have intensive treatment and 
ICU re-admission, in which case they may suffer extension 
of hospital stay, increase of cost and serious complications. 
Because LRM patients are not no-risk patients, further 
studies are needed to validate the guidelines derived from 
this study. However, we suggest that patients who require 
transfusion during major liver resection should be admitted to the ICU after liver resection for close monitoring for 
the development of serious complications.
