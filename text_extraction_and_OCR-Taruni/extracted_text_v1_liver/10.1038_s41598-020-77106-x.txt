Metabolism is involved in both pharmacology and toxicology of most xenobiotics including drugs. 
Yet, visualization tools facilitating metabolism exploration are still underused, despite the availibility 
of pertinent bioinformatics solutions. Since molecular networking appears as a suitable tool to 
explore structurally related molecules, we aimed to investigate its interest in in vitro metabolism 
exploration. Quetiapine, a widely prescribed antipsychotic drug, undergoes well-described extensive 
metabolism, and is therefore an ideal candidate for such a proof of concept. Quetiapine was 
incubated in metabolically competent human liver cell models (HepaRG) for diferent times (0 h, 
3 h, 8 h, 24 h) with or without cytochrom P450 (CYP) inhibitor (ketoconazole as CYP3A4/5 inhibitor 
and quinidine as CYP2D6 inhibitor), in order to study its metabolism kinetic and pathways. HepaRG 
culture supernatants were analyzed on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled 
with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Molecular networking approach on LC-HRMS/
MS data allowed to quickly visualize the quetiapine metabolism kinetics and determine the major 
metabolic pathways (CYP3A4/5 and/or CYP2D6) involved in metabolite formation. In addition, two 
unknown putative metabolites have been detected. In vitro metabolite fndings were confrmed 
in blood sample from a patient treated with quetiapine. This is the frst report using LC-HRMS/MS 
untargeted screening and molecular networking to explore in vitro drug metabolism. Our data provide 
new evidences of the interest of molecular networking in drug metabolism exploration and allow our 
in vitro model consistency assessment.
Quetiapine is an orally administered atypical antipsychotic indicated in schizophrenia treatment, bipolar disorders and as an adjuvant treatment in major depressive disorders1
. Widely prescribed in these indications, this 
dibenzodiazepine derivative shows afnity for various neurotransmitter receptors including serotonin, dopamine, 
histamine and adrenergic receptors and has binding characteristics at the dopamine-2 receptor similar to those of 
clozapine2
. Quetiapine undergoes an extensive liver biotransformation, involving cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and 
uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)3–6
. Among them, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the predominant metabolic systems : CYP3A4 is known to give rise to N-desalkylquetiapine, N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide 
and quetiapine sulfoxide and CYP2D6 is known to give rise to 7-hydroxyquetiapine, 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine3,6,7
. In addition, minor metabolism though CYP3A5 is known to give rise to O-desalkylquetiapine7. Tis 
knowledge on quetiapine metabolism is resulting from a sequence of works specifcally targeting the metabolism 
of one molecule afer another. Despite the recent design of appropriate bioinformatics tools, visualization tools 
allowing metabolism exploration are still underused.
Molecular networking (MN) allows the organization and representation of untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data in a graphical form8
. Each node represents an ion and its associated fragmentation 
spectrum, the links between the nodes indicating similarities between spectra. By allowing to propagate structural 
information within the network and facilitating sample-to-sample comparison, the MN approach ofers valuable 
insights into drug metabolism9
. Tereby, a multi-matrix approach provides a semi-quantitative visualization of 
molecule repartition in diferent matrix samples. MN has already proven its interest in plant species profling10, 
metabolomics11, the dereplication of naturally produced substances12, and in drug metabolism analysis for in vivo

clinical or forensic purposes9,13. Particularly, previous works focused on in vivo new psychoactive substances 
metabolite discovery9
, multi-matrix post-mortem samples in case of drug intoxication13, and toxic plant samples 
in case of intoxication14. However, to our knowlegde, MN applied to in vitro metabolism exploration has not 
already been reported.
Many human hepatic cell lines, including HepG2 and HuH7 have been used as pharmacological and toxicological models. However, the lack of relevant expression of metabolism proteins is a major shortcoming 
when using cell cultures, particularly in drug biotransformation studies15,16. HepaRG, originally isolated from 
a female patient sufering from hepatocellular carcinoma, is a bipotent cell line that can diferentiate into either 
cholangiocyte- or hepatocyte-like cells in appropriate culture conditions17. Diferentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG transcribe liver-specifc genes at high levels, closer to primary human hepatocytes (pHH) and human 
liver tissue than any other liver cell lines18,19. More precisely, HepaRG cells express most of the drug processing 
genes including major CYPs20 and UGTs19,21. HepaRG cell culture exhibit a long-term fonctional stability while 
pHH loose their diferentiated phenotype and drug metabolism over time. Moreover, HepaRG cells have been 
successfully used in metabolomics22 and have shown greater metabolite production compared to human liver 
microsome due to the lack of sulfation, methylation, acetylation or glutathione conjugation in this latter model23. 
Tus, there is a large body of evidence that diferentiated HepaRG culture is a particularly relevant cell model 
system for drug metabolism study.
In the present study, MN application to in vitro metabolism exploration was investigated using our original 
MN analytical approach in diferentiated HepaRG cells. Since in vivo quetiapine metabolism pathways generate well defned metabolite derivatives, we used this drug in order to explore the consistency of our in vitro 
metabolic model.
Results
In vitro quetiapine metabolism kinetic. In order to understand quetiapine metabolism kinetic, we 
incubated quetiapine (13 µM) in metabolically competent human liver cell models, diferentiated HepaRG cells 
during 0, 3, 8 and 24 h (H0, H3, H8 and H24, respectively). Analysis of culture media at diferent time allowed 
us to generate a multi-matrix molecular network which displayed the MS/MS data acquired during analysis 
(Fig. 1a). Nodes are labelled with the exact protonated mass (m/z) and retention times (RT in minutes) and the 
links are labelled with the exact mass shif. A specifc color was assigned to each time (H0 in white, H3 in green, 
H8 in yellow and H24 in orange). Te area of diferent color in each node represent concentrations of the corresponding compound in each condition in a semi-quantitative manner. Nodes were linked together in cluster 
according to their MS2
 spectral similarities (Fig. 1a). Visual analysis of the multi-matrix molecular network 
shows a cluster containing quetiapine linked to other nodes (Fig. 1b). Te molecular network allows to make

two observations. First, quetiapine amount decrease as a function of incubation time with the HepaRG cells. 
Second, quetiapine is correlated with eight structurally related molecules (m/z 296.121 (RT: 6.3 min); 312.116 
(RT: 5.5 min); 340.147 (RT: 6.4 min); 354.126 (RT: 6.4 min); 356.142 (RT: 5.5 min); 398.152 (RT: 6.5 min); 
400.168 (RT: 4.9 min); 400.168 (RT: 5.6 min)). Immediately afer quetiapine incubation (H0), none of these 
latter molecules was detectable. Taken together, these results suggest that these spectrally related molecules are 
putative quetiapine metabolites.
In this quetiapine-containing cluster (Fig. 1b), the related metabolites can be classifed in two subgroups. Te 
frst subgroup corresponds to molecules that accumulate over time and therefore present their highest concentration at H24 (m/z 312.116; 354.126; 356.142; 398.152). Te second subgroup corresponds to molecules that 
does not accumulate and present relatively constant concentrations over time as long as quetiapine remains [m/z
296.121; 340.147; 400.168 (RT: 4.9 min); 400.168 (RT: 5.6 min)] (Fig. 1b). Taken together, these visual results give 
a good understanding of quetiapine metabolism kinetic, and suggest that the quetiapine structurally closed molecules can be divided into metabolite accumulating over time and transitory metabolite which do not accumulate.
Identifcation step. Structural identifcation remains a challenge in metabolism exploration. Here, a node 
identifed using GNPS or open spectral library can serve as a starting point to identify another node in the 
same cluster using information propagation. Information propagation within a molecular network consists in 
determining the structure of an unknown molecule using the structural information of the neighboring nodes. 
Such process can be automatized24. In particular, spectrally related molecules may display mass shifs corresponding to well-established biotransformation reactions (Supplementary Table 1)13. From a known structure, 
it is thus possible to determine the structure of a linked molecule, using these biotransformation reactions, 
coupled with structural information of the neighboring nodes. Our data showed also two compounds with the 
same exact mass (m/z 400.168) but with two diferent retention time (RT: 4.9 and 5.6 min) (Fig. 1b). According 
to literature data, m/z 400.168 could correspond to 7-hydroxyquetiapine (m/z 400.168) or quetiapine sulfoxide 
(m/z 400.168))6
. Tese nodes are linked to quetiapine (m/z 384.173) with a mass shif of+15.994, corresponding to oxidation reaction. We found also mass shifs which could correspond to two desalkylation (-44.026 Da), 
giving rise to m/z 296.121 compound (Fig. 1b). In order to fnd where the biotransformation took place, we 
used MZMine sofware chromatogram profle analysis and MS2
 fragmentation trees analysis using SIRIUS 4.0.1 
sofware25. Briefy, chromatogram profle analysis allows us to ensure that all nodes contained in the cluster of 
interest are not artefact. SIRIUS 4.0.1 sofware provides us a molecular formula for each detected fragment, 
allowing us to orientate towards a structural formula. Figure 2 displays the example of two m/z 400.168 isomers 
(RT 4.9 and 5.6 min).
We found that both isomers presented m/z 158.12 and m/z 269.07 fragments, which could correspond to the 
same alkyl chain of quetiapine and an oxidized tricycle, respectively. Tus, we concluded that oxidation reaction 
took place on the quetiapine tricycle. In addition, we found that m/z 237.10 and m/z 221.10 fragments correspond 
to an oxidized tricycle without sulfur and an unoxidized tricycle without sulfur, respectively (Fig. 2). Tese 
results suggest that m/z 400.168 (RT: 4.9 min) and m/z 400.168 (RT: 5.6 min) correspond to 7-OH-quetiapine 
Figure 2. Isomer diferentiation using. Chromatogram analysis of m/z 400.168 isomers (RT 4.9 and RT 5.6) at

and quetiapine sulfoxide, respectively. Same methodology was applied to other nodes, allowing identifcation of 
all the quetiapine-containing cluster molecules shown in Fig. 1.
Quetiapine metabolic pathways exploration. In order to explore metabolic pathways, we incubated 
quetiapine (13 µM) with or without cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors during H24. Since Kittler et al. (2014) 
and Ferron et  al. (2016) showed that ketoconazole was able to abolish CYP3A4-dependant metabolism, we 
adapted this method to our work26,27. Ketoconazole (10 µM) and quinidine (10 µM) were used as CYP3A4/5 and 
CYP2D6 inhibitors, respectively. Quetiapine quantitative analysis using a LC-HR-MS with external standard 
calibration curve method allowed us to control inhibitors efectiveness and measure quetiapine concentration 
at diferent time (Fig. 3). It also allowed us to compare these validated quantitative results with the semi-quantitative results obtained by MN. Te relevance of HepaRG model (Fig. 3a) was assessed by comparing it to pHH 
in the same conditions (Fig. 3b). We observed a higher quetiapine metabolism in diferentiated HepaRG cells 
compared to pHH. Indeed, approximately 50% of quetiapine were metabolized at H6 compared to 25% in pHH. 
However, of CYPs inhibitors displayed a similar profle between these two models. Te use of quinidine showed 
a weak inhibition of quetiapine metabolism while ketoconazole allowed a strong inhibition. Taking together, 
these results suggest that (i) CYP3A4/5 is more likely involved than CYP2D6 in quetiapine metabolism and that 
(ii) diferentiated HepaRG is a relevant model for this study.
We performed a MN approach in the presence of ketoconazole or quinidine CYP inhibitors in diferentiated HepaRG cells to visualize what putative metabolites are CYP3A4/5- and/or CYP2D6-dependent. Since the 
aim was to compare metabolite accumulation with or without CYP inhibitor, the H24 time was chosen (Fig. 4). 
All the known molecules were named consistently with the literature data, conversely with unknown putative 
metabolites, here called quetiapine M1 (m/z 356.142; RT: 5.5 min) and quetiapine M2 (m/z 354.127; RT: 6.4 min).
We observed that quetiapine (m/z 382.174) incubated alone (in orange) is nearly absent of culture media 
at H24 in Fig. 4. In addition, quetiapine incubated with quinidine (in red) showed a lower amount at H24, 
compared with quetiapine incubated with ketoconazole (in grey). Tis corroborate our quantitative results, 
showing a minor metabolism through CYP2D6 (Fig. 3). We found that a few putative metabolites were nearly 
absent of culture media when incubated with ketoconazole (in grey), suggesting a CYP3A4/5-dependent metabolic pathway for (N-desalkyquetiapine, Quetiapine M2, 7-OH-quetiapine and quetiapine sulfoxide). Similarly, 
production of some putative metabolites was decreased in the presence of quinidine (in red), suggesting a 
CYP2D6-dependent metabolic pathway (N-desalkyquetiapine sulfoxide and quetiapine M1). We also observe 
that a few metabolites undergo metabolism through these two isoenzymes (quetiapine M1, N-desalkylquetiapine 
sulfoxide and O-desalkylquetiapine). Te same experiment was carried out in our pHH model (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). However, fewer metabolites were found, which is consistent with our quantitative results showing a slower 
metabolism in this model (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results show that MN allows detailed visual analysis of 
in vitro metabolism, including metabolic pathways.
In vivo versus in vitro quetiapine metabolism. In order to compare our in vitro fndings to in vivo 
data, we performed a sample-to-sample comparison using MN, including one blood sample of patient treated

by quetiapine and our culture media of diferentiated HepaRG incubated by quetiapine (13 µM) during H24 
(Fig. 5).
Quetiapine-containing cluster visual analysis revealed that all putative metabolites found in our previous 
in vitro experiment were present in the patient blood sample (N-desalkylquetiapine, N-desalkyquetiapine sulfoxide, quetiapine M1, quetiapine M2, O-desalkylquetiapine, 7-OH-quetiapine and quetiapine sulfoxide and quetiapine acid). In addition, we found two other metabolites, present in both blood sample and diferentiated HepaRG 
cells supernatant, resulting from oxidation of N-desalkylquetiapine (m/z 312.116; RT: 4.4) and glucuronidation 
(+176.032) of quetiapine (m/z 560.206). Identifcation step suggested that these two metabolites could correspond 
to 7-OH-N-desalkylquetiapine and quetiapine glucuronide, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest 
that diferentiated HepaRG is a strong and consistent model in metabolism study. Sample-to-sample comparison 
including in vivo samples seems to be is a potent tool to further explore in vitro data experiment. Supplementary 
Table 2 reports putative identifed compounds or metabolites contained in the quetiapine-containing clusters, 
and metabolic pathway involved in quetiapine metabolites biotransformation.
Discussion
Metabolism unraveling is a fundamental objective of pharmacologic studies. However, visualization tools allowing quick metabolism exploration are still under-used. Te aim of this study is to illustrate the interest of molecular network for in vitro drug metabolism exploration.
Quetiapine appeared as a suitable candidate drug to carry out this proof of concept. Indeed, this molecule 
undergoes an extensive and well-described metabolism. Te existence of an abundant literature allows us to 
compare it with our data in order to assess their relevance3–7
. In addition, it is an inexpensive and widely prescribed molecule. Samples from patients treated with quetiapine were then easily available to compare real-life 
data with our in vitro study.
Identifcation means were also of major importance in this study. For this purpose, we used validated process 
based on exact mass, mass spectra, retention times, fragmentation pattern analysis with SIRIUS 4.0.1 sofware,

information propagation, and mass shifs corresponding to biotransformation reactions as already described9,13,25. 
Here, we propose identifcation of 10 putative quetiapine metabolites, among which two of them (quetiapine M1 
and M2) have not been already described in the literature (Supplementary Table 2). Kinetic metabolism study 
brings us valuable data on quetiapine-related nodes. Indeed, by visualizing quetiapine clearance, correlated with 
structurally related molecules appearance, we present strong evidence for claiming they are metabolites. None 
of them was detectable before H3 incubation and since their intermediate and fnal metabolite profls could be 
distinguished, a good understanding of the metabolites fliation can be proposed. Tese data allowed us to bring 
additional evidence on quetiapine metabolic pathway (Supplementary Fig. 2).
To date, it is well established that quetiapine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 
to a lesser extent. CYP3A5 appears to be routinely present in human kidney tissue but it is detected in only 25 
to 30% of adult liver samples28,29. Tus, pHH model may be limited by the lack of this cytochrome expression in 
a donor. Tis limitation was partially overcome using diferentiated HepaRG cells that exhibit poor but present 
metabolizer alleles for CYP3A530. To further investigate quetiapine metabolism pathways, we used quetiapine 
metabolism inhibitors. Ketoconazole is well known to be a CYP3A inhibitor, including CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, 
having high inhibitory potency and producing reversible inhibition through competitive and non-competitive 
mechanisms31–37. In this way, in vitro studies have shown that 10 µM ketoconazole inhibits specifc activity of 
CYP3A4 on HepaRG cells27. Since ketoconazole is known to inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, we were not able to 
precisely determine which cytochrome was the most involved in metabolites production. Terefore, we chose to 
mention CYPA4/5 in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2. In addition, a potent competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 is quinidine38–41. For these reasons, these two molecules (ketoconazole and quinidine) have been 
used in this study to clarify metabolism pathways. Metabolism inhibition visualization using MN brings further 
insight into metabolism pathways mapping and allows us to objectify a predominant CYP3A4/5 metabolism.
Comparing HepaRG data with in vivo data appears critical to establish the proof of concept concerning the 
use of molecular network in in vitro drug metabolism exploration. Among the 10 known quetiapine metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 2)3,5–7
, we identify 8 of them (N-desalkylquetiapine, N-desalkyquetiapine sulfoxide, 
7-OH-N-desalkyquetiapine, O-desalkylquetiapine, 7-OH-quetiapine, quetiapine sulfoxide, quetiapine acid and 
quetiapine glucuronide) whereas two other compounds were unknown putatives metabolites (quetiapine M1 and

was compared with diferentiated HepaRG cells culture media incubated with quetiapine (13 µM) during H24.

blue and orange, respectively. Nodes are labelled with the exact protonated mass (m/z), chemical structures, and

quetiapine M2). Te 10 putative metabolites reported in this study have been found in both human sample and 
HepaRG cells supernatant, showing the consistency of this latter model. Furthermore, by comparing in vitro and 
in vivo data, we found two metabolites that were not seen in previous in vitro molecular networks (quetiapine 
glucuronide and 7-OH-N-desalkylquetiapine). Since these latter metabolites were found to be equally present 
in in vitro experiments according to exact mass and retention time comparison at the gap-flling step, we believe 
that this preprocess made it possible to link the information of weakly expressed molecules in vitro. Tus, sampleto-sample comparison is found to be a potent tool to visualize weakly expressed molecules.
However, as expected, MN must be interpreted considering several limitations and requires optimizations at 
every stage of data processing, and a good knowledge of LC–MS/MS analysis. We cannot exclude that diferent 
LC–MS/MS settings would have allowed the visualization of other metabolites, in particular phase II metabolites.
We demonstrated that organizing data by their spectral similarities is a useful means to identifying new 
metabolites. Furthermore, unknown drug metabolite identifcation can provide valuable information on drug 
toxicity. It would be interesting to consider broader perspectives on metabolite mapping in the context of toxicity 
studies42. in vitro cell line models such as HepaRG can be used to study pathophysiology mechanism of diseases 
like steatosis and NAFLD43. Moreover, next-generation liver organoids can be produced directly from patient’s 
cells (ie blood cells, urine cells) and modifed genetically to study patient diseases and regenerative medicine 
purposes44. Tose tools combined with MN approaches provide a new way to integrate patient individual variability in therapeutic efciency and toxicity studies.
Material and methods
Material. William’s E medium (ref: 12551032) was purchased from Gibco (TermoFischer Scientifc, San 
Jose, CA). Penicillin–streptomycin was obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY USA). Fetal Bovine 
Serum (FBS) was purchased from Eurobio (Courtaboeuf, France) and from Hyclone GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Logan, UT USA). Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate was purchased from Serb (Paris, France). Dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO), formic acid, insulin, ketoconazole and quinidine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint 
Louis, MO USA). Quetiapine was purchased from LGC Standards (Teddington, UK).
Cell culture and treatment. Progenitor HepaRG cells were cultured as previously described20. Briefy, 
HepaRG cells were seeded at a density of 105
 cells/well in 96-well plates and cultured during two weeks in 
culture medium (William’s E medium (1X) (A12176-01, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 5 µg/mL insulin, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μM sodium hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 
and 2% DMSO). Cells were then cultured during two more weeks in the same medium supplemented with 2% 
DMSO to induce cell diferentiation into cholangiocyte- and hepatocyte like cells17. Te detection of quetiapine 
and its metabolites was performed using this coculture model. pHH were obtained from the processing of biological samples through the Centre de Ressources Biologiques (CRB) Santé of Rennes BB-0033-00,056 under 
French legal guidelines and fulflled the requirements of the institutional ethics committee. Cells were isolated 
by collagenase-perfusion of liver biopsies from adult donors45 and these cells were plated in 96-well plate at a 
density of 1.5×105
 /cm2 and cultured in the same William’s E medium than HepaRG cells supplemented with 2% 
of DMSO. Cells were cultivated 4 days afer plating prior to compounds exposure.
Diferentiated HepaRG cells and pHH were incubated with 100 µL of quetiapine (13 µM) during H0, H3, H6, 
H8 and H24 with or without CYP inhibitors during all the treatment time. Ketoconazole (10 µM) and quinidine 
(10 µM) were chosen in order to inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, respectively.
Samples extraction. in vitro samples (25 µL) and in  vivo blood samples (200 µL) obtained from one 
patient at the Toxicology Laboratory of Rennes University Hospital were extracted as already described13,14. 
Briefy, samples were supplemented with 500 µL of methanol containing internal standard (risperidone-D4) and 
then extracted with 300 μL of 0.1 M zinc sulfate solution. Afer supernatant evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 200 μL of LC–MS grade water and transferred into chromatographic vials for LC-HR-MS analysis and 
quantifcation. In order to extract and analyze samples using non-targeted screening, 25 µL of each sample were 
supplemented with 75 µL of methanol. Te supernatant (50 µL) was then diluted with LC–MS grade water (50

LC–MS settings. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses were carried out using 
Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to an UltiMate 3000 pump (Termo Scientifc, San Jose, CA). 
A heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II) was used for the ionization of the target compounds. Data 
acquisition, calibration and instrument control were performed using Xcalibur 2.1 (Termo Scientifc, San Jose, 
CA) sofware. Samples were maintained at 15 °C in the autosampler and quality controls were injected before 
each analysis.
Quetiapine quantitation assays were performed using a validated LC-HRMS method as already used13 as 
follow: Te mobile phases were composed of ammonium formiate at 10 mM and formic acid 0.1% in water 
(phase A) and acetonitrile and formic acid 0.1% phase B). LC was performed on a on a Hypersil Gold column 
(5 mm×2.1 mm, 3 µm) (Termo Scientifc, San Jose, CA).
Gradient elution was as follow : initial conditions of 95:5 (A:B) maintained for 1.5 min, increasing to 70:30 
(A:B) for 3.5 min, increasing to 60:40 (A:B) for 3 min, increasing to 5:95 (A:B) for 1 min, followed by a 1 min 
plateau with 5:95 (A:B), decreasing to 95:5 (A:B) for 3 min, and return to initial conditions 95:5 (A:B) for equilibration for 3 min. Tis corresponded to a total chromatographic run of 15 min. Te fow rate was 500 μL/
min, the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C, the injection volume was 5 μL. For mass spectrometry, 
the instrument operated in ESI positive mode, the range for acquisition was 120–700 m/z. Full scan data were

acquired at a resolution of 140.000 FWHM, with an AGC target of 1e6 and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. 
Source parameters were as follows: source voltage+4.5 kV, sheath gas fow 35 units, auxiliary gas fow 15 units, 
capillary temperature 300 °C, S-Lens RF level 50 units.
Non-targeted screening LC-HRMS/MS method used for MN building was as follow: Te mobile phases were 
composed of ammonium formiate at 2 mM and formic acid 0.1% in water (phase A) and ammonium formiate 
at 2 mM and formic acid 0.1% in methanol and acetonitrile (50/50) (phase B). LC was performed on a Accucore 
Phenyl Hexyl (100×2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) (Termo Scientifc, San Jose, CA) using the following gradient elution: 
initial conditions of 99:1 (A:B) maintained for 1 min, increasing to 1:99 (A:B) for 9 min, followed by a 1.5 min 
plateau with 1:99 (A:B) and return to initial conditions 99:1 (A:B) for equilibration. Tis corresponded to a total 
chromatographic run of 15 min. Te fow rate was 500 μL/min, the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C, 
the injection volume was 10 μL. For mass spectrometry, the instrument operated alternately in ESI positive and 
negative mode in the same run, the range for acquisition was, respectively, 70–1000 m/z in positive mode and 
negative mode. Ion precursor selection was performed in the data dependent mode of operation where the most 
intense ion from the previous scan was selected for fragmentation. Full scan (MS1) data were acquired for each 
ionization mode at a resolution of 35,000 FWHM, with an AGC target of 1e6 and a maximum injection time of 
120 ms. Source parameters were as follows: source voltage+3.0 and −4.0 kV, sheath gas fow 60 units, auxiliary 
gas fow 10 units, capillary temperature 320 °C, S-Lens RF level 60 units. MS/MS (MS2) data were acquired at 
a resolution of 17,500 FWHM with an AGC target of 1e5, maximum injection time was 50 ms, a TopN of 5 in 
positive mode and 2 in negative mode, an isolation window of 2.0 m/z. Te normalized collision energy (NCE) 
was stepped at 17.5, 35 and 52.5, and the dynamic exclusion time set at 3 s.
MN generation. Spectral data allowed us to generate MN using semi-quantitative bioinformatics approach. 
Data acquisition, processing (i.e. MS data conversion, preprocessing, MS1 annotation, and generation of molecular networks), visualization and network analysis have been described in detail elsewhere9
. Briefy, raw data 
were converted to an open MS format (.mzXML) with ProteoWizard’s MSConvert module46. Te mzXML fles 
were then preprocessed (deconvolution, de-isotoping, alignment, gap-flling) with MZmine 2 sofware47. Te 
single .mgf output fle was then loaded on the Global Natural Products Social networking (GNPS) web-based 
platform in order to generate the multi-matrix molecular network8
. To the use of high resolution data, the basic 
parameters were modifed to m/z 0.02 for the mass tolerance of precursor and fragment ions used for MS/MS 
spectral library searching, and m/z 0.02 for the mass tolerance of fragment ions used for MN. Te minimum 
cluster size was set to 1. In addition, links between nodes were created when the cosine score was greater than 
0.70, and the minimum number of common fragment ions shared by two MS/MS spectra was 6. Links between 
two nodes were only kept in the network if each node was in the top 10 most similar nodes. Full data processed 
through the GNPS platform are accessible through these links:

Te molecular network was visualized using Cytoscape 3.5.1 sofware48. Te nodes were annotated by comparison with reference standards, by spectral matching with the curated GNPS, mzCloud online mass spectral 
libraries and information propagation49.
