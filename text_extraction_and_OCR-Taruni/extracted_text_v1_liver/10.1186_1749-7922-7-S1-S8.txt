Abstract
Introduction: The treatment of complex liver injuries remains a challenge. Nonoperative treatment for such injuries
is increasingly being adopted as the initial management strategy. We reviewed our experience, at a University
teaching hospital, in the nonoperative management of grade IV liver injuries with the intent to evaluate failure
rates; need for angioembolization and blood transfusions; and in-hospital mortality and complications.
Methods: This is a retrospective analysis conducted at a single large trauma centre in Brazil. All consecutive,
hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients with grade IV hepatic injury, between 1996 and 2011, were
analyzed. Demographics and baseline characteristics were recorded. Failure of nonoperative management was
defined by the need for surgical intervention. Need for angioembolization and transfusions, in-hospital death, and
complications were also assessed
Results: Eighteen patients with grade IV hepatic injury treated nonoperatively during the study period were
included. The nonoperative treatment failed in only one patient (5.5%) who had refractory abdominal pain.
However, no missed injuries and/or worsening of bleeding were observed during the operation. None of the
patients died nor need angioembolization. No complications directly related to the liver were observed. Unrelated
complications to the liver occurred in three patients (16.7%); one patient developed a tracheal stenosis (secondary
to tracheal intubation); one had pleural effusion; and one developed an abscess in the pleural cavity. The hospital
length of stay was on average 11.56 days.
Conclusions: In our experience, nonoperative management of grade IV liver injury for stable blunt trauma patients
is associated with high success rates without significant complications.
Introduction
The treatment of complex liver injuries remains a challenge for surgeons despite the last decade’s advances in
diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. The mortality
rate for liver injuries grade IV (parenchymal disruption
involving 25–75% of hepatic lobe or 1–3 Coinaud’s
segments in a single lobe) in the literature varies from
8% to 56%. [1-4].
The nonoperative treatment for such injuries in hemodynamically stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma
admitted with no signs of peritonitis is being progressively more utilized as the initial therapeutic approach
in many designated trauma centers. Although some studies have demonstrated that the nonoperative treatment
is safe for selected patients, many surgeons still choose
to operate high-grade hepatic injuries solely according
to the grade of the injury [5-8].
One of the most significant advances in the management of trauma patients in recent years was the introduction of Computed Tomography (CT) scan for stable
patients. The recommendations on the use of CT for
hemodynamically stable patients are well established, as
outlined by the manual of the Advanced Trauma Life
Support (ATLS®) of the American College of Surgeons.

CT scan allows detection and classification of hepatic
lesions and excludes the presence of associated injuries;
especially injuries to hollow viscera, although in some
cases it underestimates the findings. CT scan, due to its
high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, is an important
screening and diagnostic tool for intra-abdominal injuries in hemodynamically stable patients; patients with
altered level of consciousness; and those with difficult
clinical examination or associated pelvic fractures [9-12].
The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness
of nonoperative management of grade IV liver injuries evaluating failure rates; need for angioembolization and blood
transfusions; and in-hospital morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Our University teaching hospital is one of the referral
trauma centers in a metropolitan area of approximately
2.8 million people. This study included patients
admitted to our trauma center from 1996 through 2011.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by our
institution’s research ethics board.
Patients were eligible for this analysis if they were adult
(15 years or more); sustained grade IV hepatic injury,
classified according to the American Association for the
Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Scale (grade IV hepatic
trauma corresponds to parenchymal disruption involving
25–75% of hepatic lobe or 1–3 Coinaud’s segments in a
single lobe) [1]; and were initially managed nonoperatively as per our hospital guidelines for hepatic injury.
We excluded all patients who did not meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria.
All patients were initially resuscitated in accordance to
the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS®) and were
submitted to CT scan examination. Selection criteria for
nonoperative liver injuries management were hemodynamic stability after initial resuscitation with crystalloid
and no need for blood transfusion, absence of clinical
signs of peritonitis, and no bowel injuries shown on CT
scan.
The nonoperative treatment protocol adopted in our
trauma division is described in Table 1.
Until March 2009 helical CT scan was used as a diagnostic tool. After this period, multi-slice CT became
routine for all admitted trauma patients in our hospital.
For the CT scan evaluation, the patient must be hemodynamically stable, or remain stable after adequate fluid
replacement. According to this protocol, Glasgow Coma
Score wasn’t an exclusion criterion. The presence of
contrast extravasation has usually indicated embolization
through arteriography prior to surgery indication.
Study variables and outcome measures
Age, gender, mechanism of injury, systolic blood pressure (SBP), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Injury Severity
Score (ISS), CT scan findings, presence of associated
abdominal injuries, need for surgical intervention, need
for blood transfusions, complications related to liver (rebleeding of the liver, biliary fistula, biliar peritonitis,
liver abscess and intra-abdominal abscess) and non-liver
related complications (pneumonia, empyema, atelectasis,
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, kidney failure,
intestinal fistulae, urinary tract infections, sepsis and
brain injury), mortality and length of stay in the hospital, were analyzed [13,14].
Statistical analysis
Discrete variables are summarized as frequency and percentages. Summary data for continuous variables is presented as means and standard deviations, or medians
and ranges depending on the distribution.
Results
During the study period, 754 patients with hepatic
trauma were admitted in our service. This total included
294 (39%) patients with blunt hepatic trauma. Eighty
patients (27.2%) of this total met the criteria and were
treated nonoperatively. Eighteen (22.5%) out of these 80
patients were classified as having a grade IV hepatic
injury; and thus constitute the study cohort. Of the 18
admitted patients with AAST-OIS grade IV blunt hepatic trauma, six patients (33.3%) were women and 12
patients (66.7%) were men. The mean age of patients
was 34.22 ± 13.02 years, ranging from 20 to 59 years.
The mechanisms of injury are distributed as follows:
11 patients were involved in motor vehicle crashes;
7 (38.9%) in motorcycle collisions; and 4 (22.2%) in
small utility car crashes. Two (11.1%) were pedestrians
hit by a car and 5 patients (27.8%) suffered other types
of blunt trauma.
The mean systolic blood pressure on admission was
116.76 ± 28.33 mmHg. The only patient admitted with
hypotension remained stable after 2000 ml crystalloid
infusion. The mean Revised Trauma Score was 7.60 ±
0.58. The average Injury Severity Score of these patients
was 24.11 ± 8.73.
Twelve patients (66.7%) required blood transfusion,
with a mean of 2.26 ± 1.57 packed red blood cells per
patient.
Additional abdominal injuries were found in four
patients (22.2%). Kidney was the most affected organ
(all 4 patients), and the spleen was affected in one
patient. None of the patients developed complications
related to the liver injury. Complications unrelated to
the liver occurred in 3 patients (16.7%); 1 developed a
tracheal stenosis (secondary to tracheal intubation); 1
had a pleural effusion; and 1 an abscess in the pleural
cavity. Patient characteristics evaluated are described in
Table 2.

Regarding the CT scan findings, seven patients (38.8%)
had isolated hepatic injury with perihepatic fluid and 11
patients (61.1%) had liver injury and free fluid in the
abdominal cavity (Figures 1 and 2). Ten patients (55.5%)
had helical CT evaluation while 8 (44.5%) had multislice CT scans. Six patients (33.3%) had repeated followup scans, on average 5 days after the initial CT. None of
the follow-up CTs demonstrated progression of the
injury. Nonoperative management failed in a single
patient (5.5%) that had a progression of the free fluid
(hemoperitoneum) in the abdomen along with peritonitis. The patient was operated 4 days after admission
when a large hemoperitoneum was found but no active
bleeding from the liver. Thus nonoperative hepatic
trauma management as per our protocol resulted in an
overall success rate of 94.5%. No patient died and the
mean hospital stay was 11.56 ± 5.3 days (Table 3).
Discussion
Since 1980 several studies have proposed that nonoperative treatment of blunt liver injuries be considered the
treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic stability. The great capacity of the liver for regenerating,
the pattern of venous bleeding, and the high rate of
spontaneous hemostasis, may explain and be responsible
for high success rates associated with nonoperative
treatment. Pachter et al, in a multicenter study with 13
Level I Trauma Centers in the USA, reported a 98.5%
rate of success in nonoperative treatment for selected
patients [7,8,12,15-18].
Severe liver injuries (grade III, IV and V) have higher
morbidity and mortality. In a study with 170 patients
with hepatic trauma, Rizoli et al observed a total of 10
deaths, all with grade IV and V injuries. Many surgeons
choose to operate complex lesions of the liver even in
patients admitted with hemodynamic stability, fearing a

possible rebleeding of liver injury. It is known that the
liver rebleeding in patients admitted with hemodynamic
stability and with no blush on CT scan, is a rare event
[2,6,16,19].
Patients admitted with severe liver injuries tend to be
more critical. The average ISS of patients in this study
was 24.1. Kozar et al found an average of ISS 28 for
patients with grade IV blunt hepatic trauma. In other
studies involving patients with blunt or penetrating liver
trauma with grade IV and V injuries, submitted to surgical treatment or non-surgical, the average ISS was 25,
33, 34 and 36 respectively [2,6,20-22].
None of the patients in our study died, in agreement
with other studies showing that nonoperative treatment
for grade IV blunt hepatic trauma is safe for selected
patients [5,22].
In this study we observed that none of the 18 patients
developed any complications related to the liver and
three patients developed non-liver related complications.
Kozar et al found complications in 19 of 92 patients
(21%) with grade IV injuries treated nonoperatively. Of
these patients, less than a half needed some kind of surgical intervention. Duane et al reported a complication
rate of 0% for patients with grade IV blunt liver injury
that did not undergo surgery or angioembolization
[6,22].
Only one of the 18 patients studied herein required
surgical conversion secondary to abdominal pain, showing a success rate of 94.5% of nonoperative treatment. In
a study with patients with grades III and IV hepatic
trauma Coimbra et al, related that 22% of patients undergoing nonoperative treatment needed surgical intervention. In another study with 230 patients with grades III,
IV and V blunt hepatic trauma treated nonoperatively,
Kozar et al had 12 patients (5.2%) who failed with nonoperative management and required surgical intervention
[5,6].
The abdominal CT scan is the diagnostic modality of
choice for hemodynamically stable patients with suspected abdominal injuries. CT scan has some advantage
over ultrasound exam. CT is less operator-dependent and
is not limited by the abdominal wall, subcutaneous
emphysema, obesity or intestinal distention. CT is very
important to diagnose abdominal injuries in patients with
neurological damage, since physical examination is feasible in no more than 16% of these patients [12,22-27].
CT scan allows visualization of hemoperitoneum, one
of the most obvious signs of the presence of abdominal
injury. Usually the hemoperitoneum is seen in the Morison pouch, perihepatic space and in the right paracolic
gutter and is reabsorbed after 5 to 10 days after injury.
The amount of hemoperitoneum have previously been
considered an indicator of liver trauma severity, but
some recent studies have indicated that the amount of
hemoperitoneum does not correlate with failure of nonoperative management [12,17,24,28,29]. Besides hemoperitoneum, CT allows the visualization of contusions,
subcapsular hematomas, intraparenchymal hematomas
and lacerations to the liver parenchyma [30,31].
An important role of the CT scan is to detect active
extravasation of contrast, indicating the presence of
active bleeding. With this information, an angiography
should be performed even in hemodinamically stable
patients due to the risk of bleeding and subsequent failure of the nonoperative management. Angiographic
embolization is a safe strategy in the management of
hepatic arterial hemorrhage in patients with blunt
trauma. It was demonstrated to reduce the amount of
transfusions, the need for further liver-related surgeries
and the mortality in high-grade liver injuries. Almost all
patients in this series were evaluated by helical CT scan,
which has a low accuracy to identify extravasation of
contrast. This explains the fact that no patient underwent
angiographic embolization in the present study
[21,32-36].
Besides the diagnostic capacity, CT also has an important role in monitoring patients treated nonoperatively.

In this study, the follow-up CT did not have an important role. Six patients were submitted to follow-up CT,
which never demonstrated worsening in the injuries or
contributed for the indication of any intervention. In a
study with 74 patients with grade IV blunt liver trauma
treated nonoperatively and with repeated performance
of CT, only three patients required another therapeutic
procedure. Of these three patients, two underwent
angiography and one drainage of a bilioma. However,
these three patients had strong clinical signs of changes
in the clinical course as tachycardia, abdominal pain and
elevated enzymes. Another study concluded that
repeated CT scan matters in patients with clinical deterioration and signs of peritonitis or sepsis [18,24,37,38].
Conclusions
In our experience, the nonoperative treatment can be
performed in trauma centers with protocols in place;
24-hour operating rooms; trained surgical teams; blood
banks; critical care support; and image diagnosing methods available, such as mult-islide or helical CT scan.
Although AAST-OIS grade IV blunt hepatic trauma
patients are critical, nonoperative approach can be
adopted in hemodynamically stable patients safely and
with high success rates.
