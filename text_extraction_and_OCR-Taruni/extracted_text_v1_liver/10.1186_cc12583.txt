In an observational study in a recent issue of Critical 
Care, we demonstrated that platelet function, as assessed 
by impedance aggregometry, is reduced in patients with 
severe sepsis and poor prognosis [1]. In the present study, 
we investigated whether th e prototypic endotoxin lipopoly saccharide (LPS) (Escher ichia coli; serotype 0.111:B4; 
Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) exerts comparable 
eff ects in an in vitro model. Th erefore, heparinized blood 
samples were drawn from the antecubital vein of healthy 
probands. After incu bation of samples with LPSs (100 μg/
mL) or vehicle for 240 minutes at 37°C, samples were subjected to impedance aggregometry (Roche Diagnostics 
Deutsch land GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and aggrega tion was induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 
collagen, thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), 
or arachi donic acid.
Incubation of whole blood samples with LPS markedly 
inhibited platelet function as revealed by determination 
of the impedance aggregometry variable of area under 
curve (expressed in arbitrary units). In LPS-treated 
samples, platelet function was signifi cantly reduced in 
comparison with vehicle-treated samples when collagen 
(−55%, P  =  0.008), ADP (−45%, P  =  0.008), or TRAP 
(−20%, P = 0.04) served as the activator. In contrast, no 
LPS-induced decrease in platelet function was detectable 
when arachidonic acid was used as the activator 
(Figure 1).
Our in vitro fi ndings on LPS-induced inhibition of 
platelet aggregation closely agree with our recent observational study in patients with severe sepsis. In both 
studies, the decrease in platelet function was dependent 
on the activator used and the ranking of activators was 
identical (collagen  > TRAP  > ADP). Moreover, our 
fi nding that LPS did not reduce arachidonic acid-induced 
platelet aggregation is in agreement with our previous 
observational study. In contrast to the other activators, 
arachidonic acid was neither an independent predictor of 
the diagnosis of severe sepsis nor an independent 
predictor of the outcome in severe sepsis.
Th us, the present study demonstrates that the decrease 
in platelet aggregation seen in patients with severe sepsis 
can be mimicked in the in vitro setting, suggesting 
comparable pathophysiological mechanisms.

Figure 1. Eff ect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the platelet function induced by various activators. After 240 minutes of incubation with 
LPS (100 μg/mL) or vehicle, heparinized whole blood samples were subjected to impedance aggregometry. The activators – collagen, adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP), thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), and arachidonic acid (AA) – were used. Box plots derived from eight experiments 
are shown. For statistical evaluation, the Wilcoxon test was used.
