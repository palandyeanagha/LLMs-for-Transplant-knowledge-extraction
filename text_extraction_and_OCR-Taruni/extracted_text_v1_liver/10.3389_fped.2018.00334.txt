Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is a prototype of EBV-associated
T- and/or NK-cell (EBV+ T/NK-cell) lymphoproliferative disorders. Most subtypes of
these are lethal. We established a unified treatment strategy composed of step 1
(immunochemotherapy: steroids, cyclosporine A, and etoposide), step 2 (multi-drug
block chemotherapy), and step 3 (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;
HSCT) for CAEBV and its related diseases. Allogeneic HSCT is the only cure
for CAEBV with few exceptions. Primary-EBV infection-associated hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (primary-EBV HLH) is also an EBV+ T/NK-cell lymphoproliferation.
The nature of EBV+ T/NK cells in CAEBV and those in primary-EBV HLH differ.
In primary-EBV HLH, most patients need step 1 only and some require step 2
for the successful induction of apoptosis in EBV-infected T cells; however, some
exceptional patients require HSCT. We herein present our single institutional experience
of CAEBV and primary-EBV HLH, together with that of post-transplant EBV+ T/NK-cell
lymphoproliferative disease. We also discuss some practical points on HCST with a
review of the literature.

INTRODUCTION
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a B-cell lymphotropic virus, was revealed to have the potential to infect
T and NK cells and cause lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs) in 1988 and 1989 (1–4). Since then,
as the prototype of these LPDs, various efforts have been made to diagnose and treat chronic active
EBV infection (CAEBV) and investigate its etiology and pathophysiology. The natural clinical
course of these LPDs with only supportive care is lethal with some exceptional disease subtypes.
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been the most reliable radical
treatment. However, it has a mortality rate of ∼10%, and a severe morbidity rate of another 10%.
It is challenging to select an adequate treatment before HSCT, identify which patients need HCT,
and establish which type of HSCT is appropriate. We herein present our current strategy, which
has been developed by an institutional review, and discussed it with a review of the literature.

Sawada and Inoue HSCT for EBV-Associated T/NK-Cell LPDs
The current classification of EBV-associated T- and/or NKcell (EBV+ T/NK-cell) lymphoproliferative disorders (5, 6) and
their requirement for HSCT are listed in Table 1. The treatment
is the same between CAEBV and its related diseases, i.e.,
hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB) and severe-type hydroa
vacciniforme (sHV). The main targets of our current literature
are CAEBV, its related diseases, and primary-EBV infectionassociated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (primary-EBV
HLH); however, EBV+ T/NK-cell lymphomas or leukemia and
post-transplant EBV+ T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disease
(T/NK-LPD) are also referred. This retrospective study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Osaka Women’s
and Children’s Hospital (the name has been changed: previously,
Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and
Child Health).
OVERVIEW OF CAEBV
Background
CAEBV is a chronic, but progressive and lethal disease
with persistent/recurrent infectious mononucleosis (IM)-like
symptoms (7). Kawa et al. developed a treatment strategy for
CAEBV based on their early etiological and pathophysiological
findings (3, 4). In their early studies, IL-2 transiently controlled
the symptoms of patients with CAEBV; however, this effect
was only observed in a limited number of patients (8). Steroid
monotherapy, or later with cyclosporine A (CsA), resulted in the
remission of symptoms in most patients, and etoposide (Etp) was

effective for CAEBV-associated HLH. However, without radical
treatment, all patients died of disease progression: uncontrollable
HLH flare followed by distributive shock or multi-organ failure,
affected-cell infiltration resulting in organ failure, or disease
progression to a refractory malignant lymphoma/leukemia
(9–11).
Based on the idea that CAEBV is not a simple infection of
EBV, but an EBV-associated neoplasm, they administered and
developed multi-drug block chemotherapy comprised of anticancer drugs, and finally allogeneic HSCT with revolutionary
success (12). These ideas and treatment concepts were gradually
accepted and are now widely employed, and CAEBV is partially
cited in the WHO classification in 2008 and revised classification
in 2017.
CAEBV-Related Diseases
In HMB and sHV, systemic IM-like symptoms are induced
with a topical skin reaction by mosquito bites and sunlight,
respectively. HV is a skin disease induced by sunlight, which
generally regresses spontaneously within several years (13, 14).
However, some patients with HV exhibit disease progression, in
which systemic manifestations are also induced by sunlight, and
die with a CAEBV-like clinical course. The former is nomenclated
as classical HV (cHV), and the latter as sHV.
Patients with HMB manifest a cutaneous ulcer, with a systemic
reaction as the disease progresses, induced by a mosquito sting. In
contrast to HV, all patients with HMB follow a CAEBV-like lethal
clinical course (15–17). HV and HMB were revealed to be EBV+
T/NK-LPDs, and sHV and HMB are regarded as CAEBV-related
diseases and treated using the same strategy as that for CAEBV.
TREATMENT OF CAEBV: A SINGLE
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW
Unified Treatment Strategy
The unified treatment strategy for CAEBV (with and without
HLH), sHV, and HMB is shown in Figure 1 [F]. The initial
treatment is immunochemotherapy (step 1). At the onset of
HLH, it is sometimes difficult to make a differential diagnosis
between primary-EBV HLH and HLH as a manifestation of
CAEBV, other types of EBV+ T/NK-LPDs, or even severe IM
(a kind of acute/transient EBV+ B-LPDs). Etp was omitted for
patients without symptoms of HLH. In CAEBV and its related
diseases, for a radical treatment, most patients are moved to
multi-drug block chemotherapy (step 2) within 1–2 weeks.
Patients received 2–3 courses of chemotherapy on average
in step 2. During the interval of chemotherapy, lower doses
of prednisolone (PSL) and CsA were maintained, particularly
in patients with a higher burden of residual disease. Firstline chemotherapy is modified CHOP (Figure 1). Second-line
chemotherapy is ESCAP. However, patients with complications
may undergo the Capizzi regimen instead: high-dose cytosine
arabinoside (HDCA) 3 g/m24 times (every 12 h), L-asparaginase
(L-Asp) 10,000 units/m2 once (4 h post-CA), and PSL 30
mg/m2/d (days 1 and 2). The interval is typically 3–4 months
between the initiation of treatment and allogeneic HSCT (step 3).

Sawada and Inoue HSCT for EBV-Associated T/NK-Cell LPDs
FIGURE 1 | Three-step strategy for the treatment of EBV + T/NK-LPDs. In step 1 (cooling), the initial dosage of prednisolone (PSL) is 1–2 mg/kg/d for children and
0.5–1 mg/kg/d for adults. Etoposide (Etp; 150 mg/m2 or 5 mg/kg, weekly) is omitted in patients without symptoms of HLH. In step 2 (multi-drug chemotherapy),
lower doses of PSL and cyclosporine A (CsA) were maintained, particularly for patients with a higher burden of residual disease. LDEC: low-dose Etp 30 mg/m2/d and
cytosine arabinoside 20 mg/m2/d are continuously administered for 24 h for 1.5 (0.5–2) weeks before the initiation of RIC. Closed circles indicate fixed administration,
and open circles indicate optional administration. One precedent dose of melphalan 70 mg/m2/d is added (total 210 mg/m2/d) for children and adolescents at a high
risk of rejection, and is replaced by systemic irradiation of 3 Gy with gonadal blockade in adults.
Significance of Multi-Drug Chemotherapy
We published our single center experience of 77 patients with
CAEBV and its related diseases, HMB and sHV, along the 3-
step strategy (6). The EBV-DNA load in whole peripheral blood
(PB) is a practical and useful marker for residual disease in
CAEBV and its related diseases (HMB and sHV). Effective
chemotherapy is defined as a reduction of ≤1/10, measured with
quantitative PCR, by each course of chemotherapy. In 6 out of
77 patients, the EBV-DNA load was reduced to the minimum
detection limit (200 copies/mL) or less by several courses of
chemotherapy. Two patients underwent successful HSCT under
their parents’ and physician’s choice, another 2 patients exhibited
early elevations in the EBV load and successfully underwent
HSCT, and the remaining 2 patients (CAEBV 1 and HMB
1) received one additional course of effective chemotherapy
and have been in continuous complete remission (CR) without
HSCT (6, 18).
The necessity for and significance of multi-drug
chemotherapy (step 2) is under debate. In our strategy,
multi-drug chemotherapy is important as a preparation for
subsequent allogeneic HSCT. It provides (1) a safe bridge
to HSCT by suppressing disease activity, (2) a high rate of
engraftment of donor cells at HSCT, and (3) a low relapse rate
after HSCT (6). The majority of patients with CAEBV died of
disease within observation periods unless they received radical
treatment. Some physicians consider there to be exceptional cases
without disease progression and organ failure. We hypothesize
that exceptional cases may be present in the subgroup of
patients achieving complete molecular CR by multi-drug
chemotherapy.

Allogeneic HSCT
In our institute, 75 patients had the intention to receive HSCT. Of
these, 12 patients progressed to an emergency medical condition.
Therefore, 63 patients who underwent planned transplantation
state were involved in the following analysis. Reduced-intensity
conditioning (RIC) was superior to myeloablative conditioning
(MAC) (19), and revised 3-year overall survival rates (3y-OS)
were reported to be 90.7 ± 4.0% (n = 54) and 66.7 ± 15.7% (n =
9), respectively (p < 0.05) (6). Furthermore, the incidence of late
sequelae after RIC, such as gonadal dysfunction, may be lower
than that after MAC (20). The current RIC regimen (standard
RIC) includes a total melphalan (LPAM) dose of 140 mg/m2, as
shown in Figure 1.
Cord blood transplantation (CBT) and bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) are excellent sources of HSCT, and 3yOS were 93.3 ± 6.4 and 92.9 ± 6.9%, respectively (p = 0.87);
however, the incidence of engraftment failure was higher in CBT
(21). RIC for CBT was successfully augmented thereafter, and
no engraftment failure has since been observed (n >10) (6). The
current augmentation of RIC for CBT is LPAM 70 mg/m2 on day8 in children and adolescents, and systemic irradiation with 3 Gy
with gonadal blockade in adults if a recipient has received only 2
or 3 courses of chemotherapy before CBT.
HSCT FOR CAEBV IN VARIOUS
SITUATIONS
Adult-Onset CAEBV
CAEBV is now recognized to occur not only in children and
adolescents, but also in adults at any age. Half of the children
(including adolescents) with CAEBV died in 5 years, and most
of them died in 10–15 years without radical treatment (10). Two
studies reported that adult-onset CAEBV progresses rapidly, and
most of patients died within 5 years (22, 23). In our series, 3y-OS
was equivalent between adults (≥ 20 years of age at onset) and
children (71.4 ± 12.1, 76.6 ± 5.3%, respectively; p = 0.61) (6).
Therefore, we concluded that our 3-step strategy is also applicable
to adults. Arai et al. reported similar findings (OS 61.5%) for
adult-onset CAEBV (24).
Emergent HSCT
In our series, in contrast to the promising findings of planned
HSCT (n = 63; 3y-OS 87.3 ± 4.2%), most patients with
advanced/uncontrollable disease (n = 12), including 8 who
managed to undergo emergent HSCT, were not rescued (3y-OS
16.7 ± 10.8%) (6). Our findings were consistent with those by
Arai et al. who reported that OS was 100% after HSCT for inactive
disease, but was 0% after HSCT for active disease (24).
Patients with liver-transaminase elevations or
hyperferritinemia were restored by HSCT, i.e., remedial HSCT
(2 out of 5 survived). However, HSCT did not save patients
(compassionate HSCT, 0 out of 3 survived) with severe jaundice
(liver failure), anuria (renal failure), or tracheal intubation (due
to distributive shock after HLH flare); these difficult cases were
attributed to disease progression and not to chemotherapy or
age (6). Therefore, we consider that initiating treatment earlier
to complete HSCT in advance leads to higher survival, although
HLH flare or disease progression may occur at any time, even
under treatment.
PRIMARY-EBV HLH
Background
Primary-EBV HLH is a secondary HLH following a primary
EBV infection; secondary means that it occurs in children
(and occasionally in adolescents and young adults) without
known immunodeficiencies, including familial HLH (FHL).
It has a lethal potential for HLH flare followed by multiorgan failure without an adequate treatment. These more
severe manifestations of primary-EBV HLH than those of other
infection-induced HLH may be attributed to primary-EBV HLH
not being simple infection-induced HLH, but LPD-associated
HLH based on EBV+ T/NK-cell proliferation (typically CD8+ T
cells). The EBV infection of T cells in primary-EBV HLH has also
been reported in non-Asian children (25).
The majority of patients with primary-EBV HLH are simply
cured with immunochemotherapy (steroids, CsA, and Etp), such
as the FHL-oriented protocol (HLH-94 or HLH-2004) or our step
1 (26, 27). Remission was achieved by immunochemotherapy
in 86–90%, and recurrence was observed in 8–17% (28, 29).
Notably, eight out of the 9 patients (89%) who did not achieve
remission during the initial steroid treatment/CsA/Etp died (29).
Therefore, allogeneic HSCT is required for patients refractory to
immunochemotherapy. In prospective studies including a small
ratio of patients with a congenital gene mutation responsible for
HLH (2–8%), HSCT was administered to 15–23% of patients
(27, 28). OS was 76–90% (28, 30), and varied between 53 and 86%
in patients who underwent HSCT (27, 28, 31, 32).
In prospective studies, patients with severe/persistent
or recurrent disease moved to HSCT without multi-drug
chemotherapy (33). In contrast, in practical situations, ∼50%
of patients were treated with multi-drug chemotherapy before
HSCT (32). However, few studies have been published from the
viewpoint of the effectiveness of multi-drug chemotherapy. In
one study on 20 patients, 13 achieved remission after steroids
with or without CsA and/or Etp (34). Thereafter, 4 out of
the remaining 7 patients achieved remission by multi-drug
chemotherapy (mostly CHOP) and continued to be disease-free
without HSCT.
Prolonged high doses of steroids/CsA/Etp may lead to
a severe immunodeficiency, and result in the occurrence
of another complication, immunodeficiency-associated B-LPD
(35). If immunodeficiency-associated B-LPD can be diagnosed
early, rituximab may be effective. A systematic review and
meta-analysis showed that survival ratios were 68 and 80% in
the immunochemotherapy (without HSCT) group and HSCT
group, respectively, and concluded that both approaches equally
contributed to decreasing mortality (36); however, disease
severity may differ in each group.
A Single Institutional Review
We treated 23 patients with primary-EBV HLH between 2000
and 2017 since the measurement of the EBV-DNA load with
quantitative PCR became available (paper under preparation). In
Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 4 November 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 334

Sawada and Inoue HSCT for EBV-Associated T/NK-Cell LPDs
our institutional review, a bias was expected to exist in disease
severity; our present study may include a higher ratio of severe
patients than others because, as an example, 50% of severely
affected patients were referred from areas outside our prefecture.
Patients with primary-EBV HLH follow the unified
treatment strategy shown in the section on CAEBV (Figure 1).
Most patients with severe HLH required pulsed high-dose
methylprednisolone (HD-mPSL; 0.5 g/m2/d for 3 days) and Etp
(150 mg/m2/d or 5 mg/kg/d one day per week). In contrast,
the delayed initiation of and/or dose reductions in CsA were
allowed for the patient conditions. Patients start the tapering of
PSL within 1–2 weeks if they achieve the remission of symptoms,
whereas those refractory to step 1 move on to step 2.
Treatment responses varied; 9 patients needed only step 1
(group A), 6 needed steps 1 and 2, but did not require HSCT
(group B), and the remaining 8 needed steps 1, 2, and 3 (group
C). OS also varied; all patients (15/15) are alive and well in
groups A and B, in contrast to only 3/8 (38%) in group C. In
group A, 2 patients showed a complete response to PSL and CsA
without Etp, and 7 received Etp (mainly once or twice). Patients
refractory to or dependent on immunochemotherapy (step 1)
were administered multi-drug chemotherapy (in groups B and
C). First-line chemotherapy was modified CHOP, and secondline chemotherapy contained HDCA and/or L-Asp (Figure 1).
Together with groups B and C, 6 out of 14 patients successfully
avoided allogeneic HSCT. Patients with resistant disease against
multi-drug chemotherapy were regarded as absolute candidates
for allogeneic HSCT. One severe patient omitted multi-drug
chemotherapy for urgent HSCT. Among the 8 patients in group
C, 5 had early deaths (mainly due to HLH), 1 relapsed 12 months
after RIC followed by BMT (RIC-BMT), but was successfully
rescued by MAC-CBT, and 2 maintained CR after HSCT.
Absolute Eligibility for HSCT in
Primary-EBV HLH
In our series, group B included 3 patients who were referred to
our institute requiring further treatment than steroids/CsA/Etp,
i.e., allogeneic HSCT, but successfully substituted multi-drug
chemotherapy for HSCT. As a corollary, patients in group C were
absolutely eligible for HSCT. Similar to CAEBV, one of the roles
of multi-drug chemotherapy is to identify who definitely needs
HSCT and who does not among patients with primary-EBV
HLH.
Group C may form a distinct disease subset. In some patients,
disease activity progressed after a significant reduction in the
EBV load or even after achieving complete donor chimerism by
HSCT. These patients in group C had no mutation in the known
genes responsible for FHL or other primary HLH. They possibly
had other unknown gene mutations in T/NK cells and/or nonT/NK cells that predisposed them to the induction/maintenance
of progressive HLH (37–39).
OTHER TYPES OF EBV+ T/NK-LPDS
Post-transplant EBV+ T/NK-LPD
Typical post-transplant LPD (PTLD) has been described as EBVassociated and B-cell type LPD, occurring before 12 months
(particularly in the third month) after HSCT or at any time after
organ transplantation (40, 41). Typical PTLD is susceptible to
rituximab. In contrast, T/NK-PTLD is a dismal complication
after transplantation (OS was ∼20%) (42). However, EBV+
T/NK-PTLD had a better prognosis than EBV− T/NK-PTLD (OS
of ∼38 and 13%, respectively) (42).
As one atypical PTLD, we have had 3 recipients with late-onset
EBV+ T/NK-PTLD including one patient reported previously
(patient 1) (18). All 3 patients responded to HDCA- and/or
L-Asp-containing chemotherapy, and are in continuous CR
without HSCT (paper under preparation). Although this atypical
PTLD belongs to the variety of EBV+ T/NK-LPDs, a patient
subset may exist that responds to chemotherapy and may be
cured without HSCT.
Malignant EBV+ T/NK-LPDs
Our patient number was limited in this subset. In the literature,
more than half of patients with localized extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma of the nasal type (ENKTL) were successfully
treated with local irradiation and chemotherapy (2y-OS 78%)
(43). Malignant T/NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia is susceptible
to HDCA and/or L-Asp, such as the SMILE regimen (44–47).
However, the SMILE regimen was highly toxic in elderly patients
or those with organ dysfunctions (48). Patients with advanced
ENKTL or aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) are treated with
the SMILE regimen and HSCT (46, 47); however, OS is still
dismal, particularly in ANKL (1y-OS <30%).
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIMARY-EBV
HLH AND CAEBV
Proapoptotic Potential in EBV-Infected
Cells of Primary-EBV HLH
In primary-EBV HLH, treatment is tapered alongside the
remission of symptoms. Residual disease of primary-EBV HLH,
molecularly assessed by the EBV-DNA load with quantitative
PCR, may be significantly reduced with successful treatment;
however, molecular CR (EBV < 200 copies/mL in PB) and the
complete clearance of EBV-infected T/NK cells (typically CD8+
T cells) were not mandatory at the end of the treatment, and
minimal residual disease (MRD) disappeared within a half or
a couple of years. This was in contrast to CAEBV, for which
a positive result for MRD without HSCT resulted in overt
relapse.
Investigators failed to infect peripheral blood T/NK cells
from healthy volunteers (PB-T/NK cells) with EBV in vitro,
except in one study (49). Furthermore, although EBV managed
to infect NK-cell lines and PB-T/NK cells, most were lost due
to apoptosis within 72 h (49). In two studies using clinical
specimens, EBV-infected T cells and NK cells were detected
in 0–50 and 50–100% of patients with IM, i.e., initial EBV
infection, respectively (50, 51), but are rarely maintained and
merely result in T/NK-LPD. These findings are consistent with
our previous observations, and provided a rationale for our
recent treatment.

Sawada and Inoue HSCT for EBV-Associated T/NK-Cell LPDs
Different Nature Between Primary-EBV
HLH and CAEBV
Our observations and the findings described above prompted
us to speculate that the nature of EBV-infected T/NK cells in
primary-EBV HLH and CAEBV completely differs (Figure 2).
In primary-EBV HLH, EBV-infected T/NK cells are activated
due to primary EBV infection, and maintain an antiapoptotic
predisposition due to a specific internal environment, such as
a high concentration of cytokines during early EBV infection.
Therefore, the purpose of treatment is to induce apoptosis in
affected and activated cells, as well as to suppress the T-cell
cytokine storm and monocyte/macrophage hyperinflammation.
In contrast, EBV-infected T/NK cells in CAEBV have acquired
a self-expanding nature during years of evading eradication
(Figure 2), and the purpose of treatment is complete cell death
(total cell killing).
Spectrum Between CAEBV and Malignant
T/NK-LPDs
CAEBV shares some common features with ANKL and ENKTL,
revealing a spectrum between CAEBV and malignant EBVassociated T/NK-LPDs (52, 53). Difficulties are associated
FIGURE 2 | Fate of EBV+ T/NK cells in primary-EBV HLH and CAEBV. (A) Primary-EBV HLH. EBV-infected T/NK cells may transiently proliferate under specific
conditions (primary EBV infection and large amounts of cytokines). However, they maintain a proapoptotic nature, and may be induced to enter apoptosis by
themselves, steroids/CsA, and/or anti-cancer drugs. (B) CAEBV. Although EBV occasionally infects T/NK cells, EBV-infected T/NK cells inherently have pro-apoptotic
effects and repeatedly appear and disappear. However, some of these cells acquire a self-maintaining and self-expanding predisposition over the course of years and
contribute to the development of disease.

antibodies (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA). FCM was performed with EPICS XL® (Coulter Inc., USA). B, T, and NK cells were defined as CD20 + CD19 + CD45 + cells,
CD3 + CD45 + cells, and CD3 - CD56 + CD45 + cells, respectively. LDEC, low-dose etoposide and cytosine arabinoside; Flu, fludarabine.

with making a differential “subdiagnosis” between CAEBV
and malignant EBV+ T/NK lymphoma/leukemia (ANKL
and ENKTL) in some cases. However, their distinction
may be practically less important and the diagnosis of
“EBV-associated T/NK-LPD” may be sufficient for a
severely ill emergent patient because both need similar
therapeutic approaches that include allogeneic HSCT (5).
In contrast, EBV+ T/NK cells in PTLD, arising under some
immunodeficient conditions, particularly after transplantation,
may reserve the potential for apoptosis and susceptibility to
chemotherapy.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR HSCT
Alloimmunity as the Main Effector Against
CAEBV After HSCT
The relapse rate after planned HSCT among patients with
CAEBV was as low as <5%, although most of their conditioning
regimens were RIC rather than MAC (6). The relapse rate
did not increase even after the transplantation of CB, which
is naïve to EBV (21). In one study, cytotoxic lymphocytes
(CTLs) against EBV were induced after allogeneic HSCT in two
patients with CAEBV (54). However, CTLs against EBV were not
properly induced and EBV DNAemia was often observed after
HSCT (21), which may correlate with progression to EBV+ BPTLD, but not with the relapse of CAEBV. In contrast, mixed
chimerism or autologous recovery correlated with the relapse
of CAEBV (6). These findings prompted us to speculate that
alloimmunity is the main effector against EBV+ T/NK cells
after HSCT, and that the success of allogeneic HSCT over
CAEBV mostly depends on allo-reactive CTLs against recipient
cells (21).
This is not the case for malignant EBV+ T/NK-LPDs. The
incidence of recurrence is high, even after allogeneic HSCT,
particularly in patients with ANKL. CTL against EBV may have
some benefit for these patients as maintenance therapy after
HSCT (55).
Effects of Anti-thymocyte Globulin on
EBV+ T/NK-LPD
The purpose of our early administration of low-dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG; ThymoglobulinR
, Sanofi, France; 1.25
mg/kg/d on d-7 and d-6) is to reduce recipient T-cell immunity
and enforce donor-cell engraftment, and, in addition, reduce
EBV-infected T/NK-cell numbers for better disease control.
Sanacore et al. suggested that the early administration of
ATG at 4.5 mg/kg 2 weeks before HSCT resulted in a subtherapeutic ATG concentration (< 1µg/mL in serum) on
day 0 of HSCT; therefore, it only depleted host T cells
selectively and enhanced donor-cell engraftment (56). Their
pharmacokinetics suggest that the concentration of ATG may
be lowered to a sub-therapeutic level on the day of HSCT (day
0), even if ATG is administered at 2.5 mg/kg 1 week before
HSCT (i.e., early dosing regimen). Penack et al. reported that
although LymphoglobulinR
(equine anti-thymocyte globulin)
was less effective for NK-cell depletion, ATG induced apoptosis
and necrosis in NK and T cells (57). However, the effects
of ATG on NK cells currently remain unknown in clinical
settings.
We measured the absolute number of each lymphocyte subset
in PB during RIC (Figure 3). In addition to the absolute number
of T cells, that of NK cells was also diminished by ATG:
<1/5 in 1 day and <1/10 in 2 days after the initiation of
ATG. Therefore, although NK cells were counted as a whole
without the distinction of EBV-infected and EBV-uninfected
NK cells, we regarded ATG to be effective for the disease
control of EBV+ NK-LPD as well as EBV+ T-LPD. As a result,
if ATG is administered to patients with a high burden of
residual disease, conditioning-induced (possibly ATG-induced)
HLH needs to be carefully considered (21). ATG actually induces
apoptosis and necrosis in EBV+ T/NK cells in clinical settings.
However, the cytoreductive effects of ATG on EBV+ T/NK
cells may be transient. When the complete engraftment of
donor cells fails (mixed chimerism or autologous recovery), the
EBV load may increase again with hematopoietic recovery after
HSCT (6).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Despite the evolution of treatment strategies against
EBV+ T/NK-LPDs, the prognosis of patients with
progressive/refractory disease remains poor. Better methods in
step 2 are desired. JAK 1/2 inhibitors may exert prophylactic
and therapeutic effects on HLH (58). The SMILE regimen
has been used in some hospitals. The novel combination
of romidepsin and pralatrexate was found to be effective
for T-cell lymphoma (59). Furthermore, bortezomib and
ganciclovir have been suggested to reduce the disease burden
(60). Cell therapy, such as CTLs against EBV (as acquired
immunity) or HLA-haplotype incompatible lymphocytes
(for alloimmunity), may also be effective to some extent
(55, 61, 62). We consider better disease control with these
modalities before and after HSCT to contribute to more
promising prognoses.
