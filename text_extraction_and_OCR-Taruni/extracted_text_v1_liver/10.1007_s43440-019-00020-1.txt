Abstract
The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide. Globally, it is currently the most 
common liver disease and is estimated to afect up to 25% of the population. In the frst stage, NAFLD is characterized 
by simple hepatic steatosis (NAFL, nonalcoholic fatty liver) that might progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
fbrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the global burden of NAFLD, together with future 
perspectives on how this epidemic could be restrained. There is also an urgent need for the development of new medical 
strategies for NAFLD patients. We aim to present the benefcial efects of life-style modifcations that should be advised 
to both non-obese and obese NAFLD patients. Since there are currently no medications directly used for the treatment of 
more advanced NAFLD stages, the central part of this review summarizes ongoing and recently completed clinical trials 
testing promising drugs for NASH resolution. The marketing of new therapeutic agents would greatly increase the odds of 
reducing the global burden of NAFLD.

NAFLD development and progression
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella 
term for a range of liver conditions afecting people who 
drink little to no alcohol. As the name implies, the main 
characteristic of NAFLD is excessive accumulation of fat in 
hepatocytes. NAFLD can range from relatively benign nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to the aggressive form called 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by both 
fatty liver and liver infammation. Since NAFL and NASH 
are chronic diseases, without proper treatment, they may 
lead to life-threatening complications such as fbrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure (Fig. 1).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver, the frst stage of NAFLD, is 
defned as the accumulation of excessive fat in the liver in 
the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and the lack of 
any secondary cause. It is diagnosed in patients with visible 
lipid accumulation in at least 5% of hepatocytes; however, 
diagnosis is hampered by lack of characteristic symptoms [1, 
2]. NAFL develops due to impaired hepatocyte metabolism, 
in particular because of excessive fatty acid (FA) uptake 
[3]. Other possible etiologies include decreased fatty acid 
oxidation, exaggerated de novo lipogenesis or reduced 
VLDL synthesis and secretion by hepatocytes [3, 4]. All of 
the mentioned above changes result in abnormal fatty acid 
metabolism that ultimately lead to lipid accumulation in the 
liver and might also be related to other complications, such 
as insulin resistance for example. Although most patients 
sufer from a mild course of illness, approximately 25% of 
cases progress and subsequently lead to the development of 
steatohepatitis, hepatic fbrosis, liver cirrhosis and hepatoma 
[5]. As shown in Fig. 1, remission of NAFL can be relatively easily achieved; however, it can also progress to more 
severe forms of NAFLD such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is characterized by excessive accumulation of fat combined with the development of infammation. 
Constant worsening of this disease may ultimately lead to 
irreversible liver damage—including fbrosis, cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma [6].
NAFLD can affect both lean and obese individuals; 
however, the association between NAFLD and metabolic 
syndrome is well documented and widely recognized. It is

known that obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 
dyslipidemia are the most common metabolic risk factors 
associated with both the development and progression of 
NAFLD [6]. According to the World Health Organization, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight 
(BMI≥25–29.9 kg/m2), and of these, over 650 million were 
obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2) [7]. Since the worldwide prevalence 
of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016, not surprisingly, the global epidemic of NAFLD is also spreading. Using BMI, one of the most classical epidemiological 
indexes to assess obesity, Loomis and coworkers reported 
that the risk of NAFLD/NASH increased linearly with BMI 
[8]. In comparison to control subjects with normal BMI, 
the risk of NAFLD/NASH was from 4.1- to 14-fold higher 
in patients with a higher BMI. Additionally, it was approximately 50% higher in men and doubled in those with diabetes [8]. In line with these data, a recent study with 3202 
individuals reported that higher BMI (overweight/obesity) 
is an independent, dose-dependent risk factor for fatty liver 
disease [9].
There is also a strong link between obesity and T2DM. 
According to data collected between 1999 and 2006, the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity among American 
adults with diabetes was 80.3% and 49.1%, respectively [10]. 
The same trend was also observed in Europe, where people 
with BMI≥25 were responsible for approximately 80% of 
T2DM cases [11]. Recently, a very important comparison 
between NAFLD and T2DM was made by Alkhouri and 
Scott [12]. The authors redefned the NAFLD spectrum by 
highlighting its similarities to T2DM: NAFLD is very common, the majority of patients sufer from the less advanced 
form, and it remains asymptomatic most of the time and 
can slowly progress from a relatively mild disease (hepatic 
steatosis) to a life-threatening disease (liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma). The authors compared NAFL with 
prediabetes and stressed that management of both diseases 
should rely on lifestyle modifcations. Next, upon progression of disease to NASH or T2DM, patients should be additionally treated with pharmacological agents to maximize 
the chances of disease remission. Finally, the development 
of NASH cirrhosis/HCC or T2DM with complications (i.e., 
neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy) requires the most 
aggressive treatment [12].
Molecular events implicated 
in the development of NAFLD
Obesity and metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance or dyslipidemia are the best-known mechanisms leading to excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. It has been shown that obese patients are characterized 
by enhanced lipolysis of triglycerides and fatty acid release 
from adipose tissue [3]. This excessive breakdown of triglycerides causes accumulation of fatty acids in the form of 
diacylglycerol not only in the liver but also in other tissues 
[13]. In the case of the liver, hepatic uptake of circulating 
fatty acids is mediated by fatty acid transporters: FATP (fatty

acid transport proteins), CD36 (cluster of diferentiation 
36) and caveolins that are located in the hepatocyte plasma 
membrane [14]. The levels of these proteins are increased 
in the livers of NAFLD patients, which together with hyperlipidemia leads to enhanced FA uptake by hepatocytes [3]. 
In line with these data, knockdown of FATP2, FATP5 or 
CD36 in mice ameliorated hepatic steatosis induced by highfat diet [15–17]. Once in the cytosol, FAs are stored in the 
form of triacylglycerols to be exported from hepatocytes 
or metabolized via oxidation. Importantly, all of these processes are disturbed in NAFLD patients leading to excessive TAG accumulation in hepatocytes. Catabolism of FAs is 
controlled on many stages, but the PPARα transcription factor is the master regulator of β-oxidation (occurring in mitochondria and in peroxisomes) and ω-oxidation (performed 
in cytochromes). The frst link between FA oxidation and 
PPARα was established after demonstrating that an AcylCoA oxidase gene (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in 
peroxisomal β-oxidation) is a direct PPARα target gene [18]. 
PPARα induces not only peroxisomal oxidation of longchain FAs but also the transcription of a wide panel of genes 
related to FA oxidation in the mitochondria and cytochromes 
[19]. Interestingly, hepatic PPARα levels were reduced in 
patients with NASH in comparison to subjects with steatosis 
and healthy controls. Thus, the amount of PPARα might be 
an important transition marker during NAFL progression 
towards NASH [20].
One can expect that augmented hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD would stimulate FA oxidation. In fact, data 
from human studies are conficting, showing enhanced, 
unchanged or decreased FA catabolism in steatosis or NASH 
[3]. However, the common feature from human NAFLD 
specimens and animal models is hepatic oxidative stress 
linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and FA oxidation. Liver 
biopsies collected from NASH patients were characterized 
by increased ROS levels and reduced expression of antioxidant genes. Lipid oxidation and oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA further diminishes mitochondrial function 
compromising cellular respiration and metabolism [21, 22].
Export of FAs from the liver is another important process 
regulating hepatic lipid content. In a simplifed model, liver 
steatosis begins when accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes 
does not match oxidation and secretion. On one hand, FAs 
are delivered to the liver from adipose tissue and from the 
small intestine; on the other hand, they are secreted from 
hepatocytes as water-soluble VLDL particles [3]. Formation 
of VLDL in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) strictly depends 
on apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) synthesis and the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) 
Thus, both proteins are considered to be key components 
regulating VLDL secretion from hepatocytes. In the frst 
step, loading of ApoB100 with lipids is catalyzed by MTTP, 
and then the nascent VLDL particle is transferred to the 
Golgi apparatus to ultimately be secreted from hepatocytes 
[23]. As demonstrated by Fujita and coworkers, dysfunctional VLDL synthesis and release is a NASH-specifc dysfunction [22]. Although the serum level of VLDL-TG was 
higher in NAFL subjects in comparison to controls, it was 
reduced in the NASH group. In line with these data, liver 
biopsies collected from NASH patients were also characterized by reduced expression of MTTP, ApoB100 and PPARα 
in comparison to NAFL specimens [22]. Enhanced lipid 
secretion from hepatocytes in steatosis might compensate 
to some extent the intrahepatic lipid accumulation. However, 
lipid export from hepatocytes seems to be biphasic during 
NAFLD progression. After initial increase, secretion reaches 
a plateau and even decreases. The VLDL-TG secretion rate 
increased linearly with increasing intrahepatic lipid content, 
but reached a plateau when fat content exceeded 10% [24].
Similar to other metabolic diseases, the molecular pathways regulating the development and progression of NAFLD 
are very complex. Although we already have an accurate 
understanding of lipid metabolism, we still need a deeper 
knowledge of factors controlling the transition from fatty 
liver to NASH. However, one should not forget that the current understanding of NAFLD etiology allows us to relatively easily prevent this disease.
Global burden of NAFLD disease
Lifestyle modifcations during the last decades have resulted 
in the growing incidence of noncommunicable disease all 
over the world. The global expansion of noncommunicable 
diseases, commonly known as chronic or lifestyle-related 
diseases, has dramatically changed health priorities not only 
in ‘western’ countries but also in developing ones. The new 
epidemic of NAFLD is related to the burden of liver diseases 
paralleling the worldwide increase of obesity and T2DM. 
The global prevalence of NAFLD is currently estimated to 
be 24%; however, one should not forget that the diagnostic 
tools that are currently used are inaccurate [25]. Noninvasive 
ultrasound examination is poorly sensitive for milder forms 
of hepatic steatosis; whereas, studies based on elevated liver 
enzymes systematically underestimated the true prevalence. 
Levels of ALT/AST are variably elevated in NAFLD and 
may be normal in 50–80% of cases [26]. Even, the ‘gold’ 
standard in NAFLD diagnosis—a liver biopsy—might give 
some variability because a relatively small liver fragment is 
used for histopathological examination [2]. Nevertheless, a 
meta-analysis published by Younossi and coworkers in 2016 
reported the prevalence of NAFLD in diferent geographical 
regions. According to the study, the highest rates of NAFLD 
were reported in South America (31%) and the Middle East 
(32%), followed by Asia (27%), the United States (24%), 
Europe (23%) and Africa (14%) [25]. Globally, more than a

billion people worldwide are afected [27]. More recently, 
Estes and coworkers published an alarming study that modeled NAFLD prevalence and incidence from 2016 to 2030 
[28]. Future NAFLD disease burden was analyzed in eight 
countries (China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, 
United Kingdom and United States) accounting for a quarter of the world’s population. According to the authors, over 
these 15 years, the total NAFLD population would increase 
by 18.3% to 100.9 million cases, with a prevalence of 28.4% 
(Fig. 2). The highest prevalence in 2030 was estimated for 
Italy (29.5%), United States (28.4%) and Spain (27.6%). 
Alongside the signifcant rise of total NAFLD patients, 
the authors also projected a growing number of diferent 
disease stages: NAFL, NASH or cirrhosis. Additionally, in 
all analyzed countries, the prevalence of HCC cases related 
to NAFLD were estimated to increase, ranging from 3240 
cases in Japan (47% increase in 2030) to 24,860 cases in 
United States (130% increase in 2030) [28].
Finally, a meta-analysis performed in 2014 among United 
States patients undergoing liver transplantation showed that 
NASH is the third most common indication for this type of 
surgery [29]. Today, liver transplantation is the best therapeutic option for patients sufering from acute or chronic 
liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Although liver 
transplantation is often a life-saving surgery for patients, the 
disproportion between recipients and donors is still an ongoing problem. A recently published, population-based ELITA 
study analyzed data from the European Liver Transplant 
Registry [30]. In that study, 60,527 patients who received 
liver transplantation between January 2007 and June 2017 
were classifed into fve groups based on the etiology of liver 
disease: 1) hepatitis C virus (HCV); 2) hepatitis B virus 
(HBV); 3) alcoholic liver disease (ALD); 4) NASH and 5) 
all other indications. In line with previous reports, alcoholic 
liver disease has emerged as the most common indication 
for liver transplantation in Europe and in the USA [30, 31]. 
Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs in 2014 led to a dramatic decline in the number of liver transplants performed in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to HCV infection 
(−60%), and in those with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV (−41%). In contrast, the number of patients 
enrolled in liver transplantation due to NASH has constantly 
increased over a 10-year period. Since the absolute number 
of liver transplantations caused by ALD, HCV and HBV 
in Europe is decreasing from 2014, there is a high chance 
that in the near future, NASH will become one of the main 
indications for this surgery [30]. Similar trends have been 
noted in the USA [32].
It is worth mentioning that patients with early-stage 
NAFLD (fatty liver with no signs of infammation) may easily revert this disease phenotype. In such individuals, a great 
improvement in NAFLD severity is observed after life-style 
modifcation and weight loss. However, in more advanced 
NAFLD stages, the prescription of drugs to reduce insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia is highly recommended 
[33]. Importantly, so far there is no drug approved for direct 
therapy of NAFL or NASH [34].
Dietary changes and physical activity 
in NASH
NASH is becoming one of the most frequent causes of cirrhosis and liver transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other fatty liver diseases [35, 36]. Since there is no 
approved drug for NASH therapy, it is crucial to look for 
therapeutic methods that can lead to prevention or reversal of 
NASH progression. It is known that high-fat, high-sugar, 
hypercaloric diets increase the risk of hepatic steatosis [37]. 
On the other hand, weight loss achieved by caloric restriction 
reduces hepatic infammation and fbrosis, and diminishes

nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [38]. Studies revealed that 
even a loss of 7–10% of weight results in improvements in 
NAS score, and a loss of≥10% of weight results in 90% of 
NASH resolution, 45% of fbrosis regression and a 100% 
steatosis resolution [38]. A calorie-restricted diet is the most 
important factor in nutritional interventions in NASH [39]. 
Weight reduction (at least 7%) achieved by several types of 
diet is indicated for remission of NASH [40]. The Mediterranean diet was recommended for NAFLD patients by the 
recent EASL–EASD–EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines 
[41]. This dietary pattern is characterized by a high intake 
of olive oil, which is rich in monounsaturated fat, nuts, fruits 
and legumes, vegetables, and fsh and a low intake of red 
meat, processed meats, and sweets. The Mediterranean diet 
minimizes consumption of processed, high-sugar food and 
high-fructose food. Fructose has been shown to increase 
hepatic TNF production, lipid peroxidation and might promote hepatic steatosis and NAFLD [40]. It has been shown 
that diets enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(PUFA) ameliorate steatohepatitis, together with a reduction 
in intrahepatic triglyceride content [42, 43]. Additionally, 
NAFL and NASH patients tend to consume lower amount 
of omega-3 PUFA versus a control group of patients [44].
Another lifestyle modifcation important for the treatment 
of NAFLD that is closely related to weight loss is physical 
activity and exercise. It was shown that exercise signifcantly 
reduces steatosis [45] and lowers the risk of NAFLD patients 
progressing to NASH [46]. A systematic review by Hashida 
and coworkers compared aerobic versus resistance exercise 
programs for NAFLD patients. The authors demonstrated 
that both exercise programs reduced hepatic steatosis in 
NAFLD with a similar frequency, duration, and period of 
exercise (40–45 min/session 3 times/week for 12 weeks). 
One should not forget that resistance exercise versus aerobic 
is characterized by lower intensity and energy consumption. 
Thus, this kind of physical activity may be more feasible for 
NAFLD patients with poor cardiorespiratory ftness that are 
accustomed to a sedentary lifestyle [47]. Since 10–20% of 
people sufering from NAFLD have a normal BMI, Wong 
and coworkers investigated if weight reduction is also benefcial for this group of patients. The authors enrolled 78 
volunteers (BMI<25) who were randomized to a 12-month 
lifestyle intervention program involving regular exercise, or 
to standard care. The primary outcome was remission of 
NAFLD at month 12. Patients were then prospectively followed for 6 more years. Importantly, remission of NAFLD 
was achieved in 67% of non-obese patients after lifestyle 
intervention. Furthermore, for half of all NAFLD patients 
enrolled in the study, a weight reduction of only 3–5% was 
efective in treating the disease [48].
Current strategies for NAFLD treatment
Successful treatment of patients sufering from NAFLD is 
challenging due to its complex etiology, difcult diagnosis, 
the wide spectrum of NAFLD stages and the presence of 
concurrent diseases. Thus, an individually tailored approach 
is required to improve outcomes not only for NAFL patients 
but also for those diagnosed with more advanced NASH 
stages. Because epidemiological studies demonstrated a tight 
link between NAFLD and an unhealthy lifestyle, its modifcation is a mandatory starting point for all patients [12, 
49] (Table 1). According to EASL–EASD–EASO Clinical 
Practice Guidelines [41], comprehensive lifestyle modifcations should combine: (1) energy restriction (500–1000 kcal/

day); (2) macronutrient composition (low-to-moderate fat 
and moderate-to-high carbohydrate intake); (3) exclusion of 
fructose intake both in beverages and foods; (4) strict daily 
limit for alcohol consumption (below 30 g for man and 20 g 
for women); and (5) physical activity (at least 150–200 min/
week of moderate intensity in 3–5 sessions) (Table 1). All of 
the abovementioned lifestyle modifcations have benefcial 
efects on weight reduction and metabolic control. In fact, 
this ‘therapy’ is a very efective frst line of treatment recommended for NAFL and early NASH (no or mild fbrosis: 
F0–F1) patients. Importantly, pharmacotherapy in addition 
to lifestyle modifcations is recommended for progressive 
NASH (≥F2 stage) patients. Additionally, patients with 
early-stage NASH, but with a high risk of fbrosis progression should also be enrolled for treatment with prescribed 
drugs.
Unfortunately, despite intensive studies, there is not a single drug for NASH approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Thus, no specifc therapy can be recommended and 
all currently prescribed drugs are used of-label. Nevertheless, there are some medicines that are already used worldwide [50]. Among the insulin sensitizers currently available 
on the market, only pioglitazone was demonstrated to have 
some positive efects in NASH patients (improved histology and biochemistry) [51–53]. Although no clear statement about pioglitazone can be made (still of-label use 
outside T2DM), this medication could be used for NASH 
according to the clinical guidelines published by the joint 
EASL–EASD–EASO Associations [41]. However, as discussed below, its usefulness for NASH is still under investigation. Vitamin E is another drug currently proposed by 
the EASL–EASD–EASO for NASH; however, its benefcial efects and long-term safety issues require further studies [53, 54]. In addition, statins might be used to improve 
patients’ lipid profle and prevent cardiovascular risk; however, they have not been adequately tested in NASH [41].
Unfortunately, for many NASH patients, pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifcations are not sufcient to reduce 
liver fbrosis and infammation. Current problems with resolution of the histological lesions indicate an urgent need for 
the development of new pharmacotherapies to manage this 
disease [38] (Fig. 3).
Promising drugs for NASH
Cenicriviroc
Cenicriviroc (CVC) is an oral, dual antagonist of C–C 
chemokine receptor types 2 and 5. Blockade of CCR2, a 
chemokine receptor predominantly expressed on monocytes 
and macrophages, results in reduced recruitment, migration 
and infltration of these cells to the injured parts of the liver 
[55, 56]. Parallel CCR5 inhibition impairs the migration, 
activation and proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells 
[56, 57]. In one study, 288 NASH patients took part in the 
CENTAUR phase 2b clinical trial (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT02217475) to test the efcacy and safety of CVC in 
adults with NASH (Table 2). For this 2-year study, patients 
were divided into 3 groups: A—application of 150 mg daily 
CVC for 2 years, B—application of placebo for 1 year followed by application of CVC for another year, C—application of placebo for 2 years. Currently, only the results from 
the 1st year of the study are available; so, this review will 
focus on them. In the 1st year of the CENTAUR doubleblinded study, 144 patients received once-daily 150 mg 
CVC, and the second group of 144 subjects was enrolled 
into placebo treatment. The primary endpoint of the study 
was a 2-point improvement in the NAFLD Activity Score 
(NAS) without worsening of fbrosis was not achieved (16% 
CVC vs. 19% placebo; p=0.52). Nonetheless, more CVC 
patients had improvement in fbrosis by≥1 stage without 
worsening of steatohepatitis (20% CVC vs. 10% placebo, 
p=0.02). CVC also impacted infammation, as refected by 
marked reductions in circulating biomarkers—CRP, IL-6, 
IL-1β and soluble CD14. Due to its antifbrotic properties in 
subjects with NASH after 1 year of the CENTAUR clinical 
trial, CVC is currently being tested in the AURORA phase 3 
clinical study for efcacy and safety for the treatment of liver 
fbrosis in adults with NASH (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: 
NCT03028740) [58].
Elafbranor
Another promising drug currently tested for resolution of 
NASH is elafbranor—a dual PPARα/δ agonist. PPARα 
is an important player in the context of steatohepatits: it 
modulates fatty acid transport and β-oxidation in the liver. 
Moreover, PPARα activation by fbrates improves plasma

lipids by decreasing triglycerides and increasing HDL levels 
[59]. It was shown that in advanced NASH, the PPARα level 
is reduced, but it recovers after improvement in disease [20]. 
PPARδ also regulates metabolism in the liver—its activation enhances fatty acid transport and oxidation. Furthermore, use of PPARδ agonists results in elevation of plasma 
HDL levels and proper glucose homeostasis [60]. In phase 
2b of the GOLDEN-505 clinical trial, the efcacy of NASH 
treatment with elafbranor was evaluated (ClinicalTrails.
gov Identifer: NCT01694849) (Table 2). Here, 276 subjects 
were randomly divided into three groups: A—93 patients 
received 80-mg elafibranor per day, B—91 of patients 
received 120-mg elafbranor daily, and C—92 patients were 
in the placebo group. The GOLDEN-505 trial aimed for 
NASH reversal without worsening of fbrosis (absence of 
at least 1 NASH feature: steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning 
or infammation). This primary outcome was later modifed to “disappearance of ballooning with resolved lobular 
infammation or the persistence of mild lobular infammation only”, to highlight the importance of hepatocyte ballooning as a main feature of steatohepatitis. In this study, 
19% of patients met this primary outcome in comparison 
to 12% from placebo group. Additionally, in the case of 
subjects with NAS≥4, a signifcant efect of 120 mg, but 
not 80-mg elafbranor was observed when compared to the 
placebo group. In these patients, improvement in steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular infammation was 
observed. NAS was ameliorated by≥2 points in twice as 
many patients as the control group (48% elafbranor vs. 21% 
placebo; p=0.013). Furthermore, the liver fbrosis stages 
were reduced in patients with NASH resolution after elafbranor treatment. Both doses of the tested drug improved 
serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, GGTP, ALP) and lipid 
profle (triglycerides, LDL, HDL). In addition, a reduction in 
serum infammatory markers (CRP, fbrinogen, haptoglobin) 
was obtained. Additionally, in diabetic patients (40% of participants), the level of fasting serum glucose, HbA1c and 
markers of insulin resistance were improved. Importantly, 
all of the above-listed benefcial efects of elafbranor fulflled the requirements of the study secondary endpoints 
[61]. After successful phase 2b trials, elafbranor is currently 
being investigated in phase 3 of the RESOLVE-IT study 
(ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT02704403) to evaluate 
efcacy and safety in NASH patients.
Obeticholic acid
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a 6a-ethyl derivative of one of 
the human bile acids: chenodeoxycholic acid, which is a 
natural Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. Due to synthetic modifcation, OCA stimulates FXR activity 100-fold 
more intensely than chenodeoxycholic acid [62]. Thanks to 
this feature, OCA exerts anticholestatic and hepatoprotective 
properties by regulating the metabolism of cholesterol and 
bile acids [63]. Additionally, it possesses anti-infammatory 
and antifbrogenic activity [64]. In phase 2a of a clinical trial 
on OCA in diabetic and NAFLD patients (ClinicalTrails.gov 
Identifer: NCT00501592), weight loss as well as increased 
insulin sensitivity and a reduction in markers of liver infammation and fbrosis were observed (Table 2). Next, 283 
patients with NASH were included in the phase 2b—FLINT 
trial (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT01265498) in which 
they were administered 25 mg OCA daily for 72 weeks. 
Importantly, the primary endpoint of the study—decreased 
NAS score by at least 2 points without worsening of fbrosis—was achieved (45% OCA vs. 21% placebo; p=0.0002). 
Moreover, patients treated with OCA were characterized by 
reduced fbrosis (35% OCA vs. 19% placebo; p=0.004). 
A significant reduction in steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning was accomplished as well. 
Decreased body weight and reduced ALT levels occurred 
in the group of patients treated with OCA [65]. Currently, 
OCA is being investigated in the phase 3 of the REGENERATE study (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT02548351) 
to evaluate its impact on NASH with fbrosis and in phase 
3 of the REVERSE trial (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifier: 
NCT03439254) to evaluate its efcacy and safety in subjects 
with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH.
Pioglitazone and Vitamin E
The purpose of the phase 3 PIVENS study (ClinicalTrails.
gov Identifer: NCT00063622) was to assess if therapy with 
vitamin E or pioglitazone will lead to an improvement in the 
NAS score of nondiabetic patients with NASH. Pioglitazone 
is a drug from the thiazolidinedione class, which is commonly used for T2DM treatment. By activating the PPARγ 
nuclear receptor, pioglitazone regulates the expression of 
genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. It has a 
benefcial impact on lowering insulin resistance in the liver, 
muscles and adipose tissue, and decreases gluconeogenesis 
in the liver [66]. The second tested agent, vitamin E, is an 
antioxidant with anti-infammatory and anti-apoptotic activity [67]. In patients with NASH, the level of α-tocopherol, 
which is a constituent of vitamin E, is lower versus healthy 
controls [68]. Thus, it was suggested that supplementation with vitamin E could be benefcial for the treatment of 
NASH (Table 2). In this study, 247 participants were divided 
into three groups: A—30 mg daily pioglitazone and placebo 
(instead of vitamin E), B—vitamin E (800 IU daily) and placebo (instead of pioglitazone) and C—placebo only. The primary outcome was improvement of histological features—a 
decrease by≥1 point in hepatocellular ballooning score, lack 
of an increase in fbrosis score, and a general reduction in the 
NAS score to≤3 or by at least 2 points. The vitamin E treatment reached this primary endpoint—it revealed a greater 

8 N. Pydyn et al.
1 3
improvement rate in NASH than placebo (43% vitamin E 
vs. 19% placebo; p=0.001). Treatment with pioglitazone 
was also benefcial for resolution of NASH (34% pioglitazone vs. 19% placebo; p=0.04), however, it did not reach 
the expected p=0.025 value. For secondary outcomes, in 
both groups, there was a signifcant reduction in steatosis, 
lobular infammation and NAS score, but not in fbrosis 
and portal infammation. Scores for hepatocyte ballooning 
were signifcantly improved only after vitamin E treatment 
(p=0.01), but steatohepatitis was resolved with statistical 
signifcance in the group of patients who received pioglitazone (p=0.001). A signifcant reduction in ALT, AST, 
ALP and GGTP levels was observed in the serum of patients 
from both groups [53]. As a result of this promising study, 
pioglitazone was further evaluated in phase 4 of a clinical 
trial to assess its efect on NASH in prediabetic and diabetic patients (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT00994682). 
Here, 101 patients were qualifed for the study, and received 
30 mg daily pioglitazone (if well tolerated, the dosage was 
increased to 45 mg per day after 2 months of the trial) or 
placebo for 18 months. The primary outcome, which was 
reduction of NAS by more than 2 points without worsening of fbrosis, was achieved both in prediabetic and diabetic patients. Resolution of NASH, which was a secondary 
endpoint, was obtained only in patients with diabetes (60% 
pioglitazone vs. 16% control; p=0.002). In both the prediabetic and diabetic groups of patients treated with pioglitazone, a signifcant reduction of steatosis, NAS score, insulin 
resistance, and serum triglyceride level was observed. However, only in diabetic patients was a signifcant reduction of 
fbrosis (p=0.035), infammation (p=0.013) and ballooning 
(p=0.006) accomplished. The general conclusion of this 
study was that similar results regarding NASH treatment 
were achieved by both prediabetic and diabetic patients [69].
GLP‑1 analogs
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived incretin 
hormone which possesses glucose-lowering features: it is 
able to induce insulin secretion and reduce production of 
glucagon. It also suppresses appetite and retards gastric 
emptying. Endogenous GLP-1 is degraded within a few 
minutes; so for therapeutic purposes, a GLP-1 analog—
liraglutide—with a half-life of 13 h was developed [70]. 
Liraglutide use leads to weight loss, and improvement in 
metabolic regulation and beta cell function [71, 72]. It is 
used to maintain glycemic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes. Liraglutide was also shown to improve lipid transport, beta-oxidation and de novo lipogenesis in in vitrotreated hepatocytes [73–75]. In phase 2 of the LEAN study 
(Liraglutide Efcacy and Action in NASH), 26 patients 
received 1.8 mg liraglutide daily by subcutaneous injection, 
and the other 26 subjects were injected with 1.8 mg placebo 
(ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT01237119) (Table 2). The 
primary outcome was improvement in liver histology (resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fbrosis) and 
was met in 39% of liraglutide patients versus 9% of placebo 
patients (p=0.019). Among the secondary endpoints, the 
amelioration of NAS score and its components (steatosis, 
ballooning and infammation), stage of fbrosis and serum 
biomarker levels (liver enzymes, lipid profle) were listed. 
Patients treated with liraglutide showed a signifcant reversal of steatosis (83% liraglutide vs. 45% placebo; p=0.009) 
and hepatocyte ballooning (61% liraglutide vs. 32% placebo; 
p=0.05). Additionally, a smaller proportion of liraglutidetreated patients showed progression of fbrosis (9% liraglutide vs. 36% placebo; p=0.04). Liraglutide treatment 
signifcantly reduced body weight, BMI and depleted the 
concentration of serum liver injury biomarkers. Nonetheless, 
no diferences in lobular infammation and NAS score were 
observed between these two groups of patients [70]. The 
authors of this study did not continue to evaluate liraglutide 
in clinical trials, but they initiated a new phase 2b to investigate the efcacy and safety of another GLP-1 inhibitor—
semaglutide (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT02970942). 
However, liraglutide is now tested by another group in the 
phase 3 CGH-LiNASH study to compare the efects of liraglutide and bariatric surgery on weight loss, liver function, 
body composition, insulin resistance, endothelial function 
and biomarkers of NASH in obese Asian adults (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifer: NCT02654665) (Table 2).
Conclusions
From the global perspective, a growing number of 
patients suffering from metabolic diseases require urgent 
action. All decision makers—not only physicians, scientists or politicians—should join together in a community 
effort to promote healthy food and physical activity. In 
our opinion, there are still many possibilities to stop this 
negative trend. For example, more attention should be 
paid to education programs for young people, parents and 
teachers. Unfortunately, as described above, the global 
epidemic of NAFLD is predicted to spread even further. 
Furthermore, there are a constantly growing number of 
people on a waiting list for liver transplantation due to the 
liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, urging the development of 
new therapeutic strategies.
