Abstract The lack of an efficient cell culture system for
hepatitis E virus (HEV) has greatly hampered detailed analyses of this virus. The first efficient cell culture systems for
HEV that were developed were capable of secreting infectious HEV progenies in high titers into culture media, using
PLC/PRF/5 cells derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma and A549 cells derived from human lung cancer as host
cells. The success achieved with the original genotype 3
JE03-1760F strain has now been extended to various HEV
strains in fecal and serum samples obtained from hepatitis E
patients and to HEV strains in fecal and serum samples and
liver tissues obtained from pigs and wild boar across species
barriers. In addition, infectious HEV cDNA clones of the
wild-type JE03-1760F strain and its variants have been
engineered. Cell culture-generated HEV particles and those
in circulating blood were found to be associated with lipids
and open reading frame 3 (ORF3) protein, thereby likely
contributing to the assembly and release of HEV from
infected cells both in vivo and in vitro. The ORF3 protein
interacts with the tumor susceptibility gene 101, a critical
cellular protein required for the budding of enveloped viruses, through the Pro, Ser, Ala, and Pro (PSAP) motif in
infected cells; ORF3 is co-localized with multivesicular
bodies (MVBs) in the cytoplasm of infected cells, thus suggesting that HEV requires the MVB pathway for the egress of
virus particles. This article reviews the development of efficient cell culture systems for a wide variety of infectious
HEV strains obtained from humans, pigs, and wild boar, and
also provides details of a new model for virion egress.

countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America where sanitation conditions are suboptimal, and zoonotically in many
industrialized countries including the United States, European countries, and Japan [1–6]. Hepatitis E has long been
described as a self-limiting hepatitis that never progresses
to chronicity [3]. However, since the identification of a
case of chronic hepatitis E in Europe, chronicity has been
documented in immunocompromised solid-organ transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals [7–9].
HEV is classified in the genus Hepevirus within the
family Hepeviridae [10]. The virion measures 27–34 nm in
diameter and is believed to be non-enveloped, although
HEV particles in circulating blood and culture supernatants
are associated with lipids, as described in detail below. The
HEV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense
RNA measuring approximately 7.2 kilobases (kb) in
length, which is capped and polyadenylated [11, 12]. It
contains a short 50 untranslated region (UTR), three open
reading frames (ORFs: ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3), and a
30
UTR. ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins including
methyltransferase, papain-like cysteine protease, helicase,
and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [13, 14]. ORF2 and
ORF3 overlap, and the ORF2 and ORF3 proteins are
translated from a single bicistronic subgenomic RNA
measuring 2.2-kb in length [15]. The ORF2 protein is the
viral capsid protein, which works for particle assembly,
binding to host cells, and eliciting neutralizing antibodies;
the crystal structure of a truncated recombinant ORF2
protein has been elucidated [16, 17], but the structure of the
whole capsid protein has not yet been resolved [18]. The
ORF3 protein, which is a small phosphoprotein made of
113 or 114 amino acids (aa), is necessary for virion release
[19, 20], as is described in detail below.
The discoveries of animal strains of HEV from domestic
pigs, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbits, rats, bats, chickens, and fish (trout) have significantly broadened the host
range and genomic diversity of HEV [5, 21–29], and the
existence of at least four putative genera in the family
Hepeviridae, one comprising human HEV genotypes and
closely related animal viruses, and the other three including
viruses from rodent (rat), chiropteran (bat), and avian
(chicken) hosts, has been suggested [28]. The trout hepevirus might correspond to a separate taxonomic unit of
higher rank, e.g., a subfamily [30]. Hepatitis E is now a
recognized zoonotic disease, and several species of animals, such as swine, wild boar, and deer, are considered to
serve as reservoirs of HEV strains that infect humans
[31–36]. The ingestion of uncooked or undercooked meat
and the viscera of farmed pigs and wild boar may be the
major route of HEV infection in industrialized countries,
including Japan [5, 6, 37]. Four major genotypes of HEV
that infect humans have been identified [38, 39]. Genotypes
1 and 2 have so far been isolated only from humans and are
mainly seen in developing countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 are
zoonotic, and have been identified in many sporadic cases
affecting middle-aged and elderly men in industrialized
countries [4, 39–41]. Although two HEV strains (JBOAR135-
Shiz09 and wbJOY_06) of new unrecognized genotypes, provisionally designated genotypes 5 and 6, respectively, that
cluster closely with human HEV strains but are markedly
divergent from rat, bat, and avian HEV strains, have been
detected from wild boar in Japan, it remains unknown whether
these boar strains can infect humans across species [42, 43].
HEV has been regarded as a virus that is impossible to
culture in vitro, given the tremendous difficulties in developing a cell culture system. There are no small animal models
of infection, and macaques are inaccessible or unaffordable
for most researchers in the field. The establishment of a
practical cell culture system that facilitates the propagation of
HEV in vitro is critical for virological characterization, as well
as for studies on the prevention of HEV infection. This article
reviews the breakthrough in the establishment of cell culture
systems for various HEV strains from humans, pigs, and wild
boar, and provides details of a new model for virion egress.
Establishment of cell culture systems for HEV strains
of genotypes 3 and 4 found in feces and serial passages
of their progenies in cultured cells
HEV usually replicates to low titers in vivo, and growing it
in cell culture has proven to be exceedingly difficult.
However, a breakthrough has been achieved recently using
a fecal specimen from a sporadic case of acute hepatitis E
in Japan that contained a very high load of HEV (JE03-
1760F strain of genotype 3: 2.0 9 107 copies/ml), which
thus enabled the establishment of a robust culture system
for HEV. The fecal suspension was used as an inoculum,
and the replication capacity of HEV was then evaluated in
21 established cell lines derived from humans, monkeys,
cows, dogs, rats, and mice, including three human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, Huh7, and PLC/PRF/5
cells). The JE03-1760F strain was found to replicate efficiently in two cell lines; PLC/PRF/5 (Alexander) and A549
from human lung cancer [44]. Of note, although A549 cells are
not hepatocytes, HEV was shown to be distributed not only in
the liver, but also in the lung, kidney, spleen, and even colon in
infected pigs [45]. The presence of HEV in bile, lymph nodes,
and tonsils in infected pigs has also been reported [46, 47].
Upon inoculation of the JE03-1760F strain, progeny
viruses were excreted into the culture media in titers
reflective of the HEV inoculum. HEV grew efficiently
following the seeding of 1.0 9 105 copies (genome copies
per cells: approximately 0.1) in the wells of a six-well
microplate containing monolayers of PLC/PRF/5 or A549
cells, and the viral load in the culture medium reached
148 J Gastroenterol (2013) 48:147–158
123

108 or 107 copies/ml, respectively, on day 50. The first
successful propagation of the JE03-1760F strain in PLC/
PRF/5 and A549 cells may have been ascribable to the
markedly high HEV titer in the inoculum. RNA viruses
generally exist as quasispecies [48]. A sample with a high
titer has an increased probability of containing variant(s) with advantageous mutations needed to permit the
infection of a cultured cell. Notably, the JE03-1760F strain
harbored the 29 point mutations with 6 non-synonymous
mutations found in the virus in feces, which were not possessed by any of the reported genotype 3 HEV strains [49].
The initial success was followed by the establishment of
a culture system with the use of another fecal suspension,
from a patient with fulminant hepatitis E, containing
the HE-JF5/15F strain of genotype 4 at a high titer
(1.3 9 107 copies/ml) [50]. The HE-JF5/15F strain was
propagated and passaged more efficiently than the JE03-
1760F strain [51]. Epidemiological surveys suggest that
HEV of genotype 4 is significantly more frequently associated with a severe form of hepatitis than HEV of genotype 3 [52–54]. The high replicative activity of HEV
genotype 4, reproduced in the culture system for the
HE-JF5/15F strain of this genotype, is expected to be
useful for elucidating the viral factors associated with the
development of fulminant hepatitis E in infected patients.
Furthermore, HEV progenies of the genotype 3 JE03-
1760F strain in the culture supernatant grew efficiently
through many generations of passages in PLC/PRF/5 and
A549 cells (53 generations of passages as of June 2012),
with the highest HEV RNA titer in the culture media being
108
–109 copies/ml (unpublished observations). In addition,
HEV progenies of the genotype 4 HE-JF5/15F strain in the
culture supernatant replicated efficiently through many
generations of passages in PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cells (33
generations of passages as of June 2012), with the highest
HEV loads in the culture supernatants being 109
–1010
copies/ml (unpublished observations). Shukla et al. [55]
described the adaptation of the Kernow C1 strain, a
genotype 3 HEV strain purified from the feces of a
chronically infected patient, to growth in human hepatoma
cells (HepG2/C3A) selected for a virus recombinant that
contained an insertion of 174 ribonucleotides (58 amino
acids) of a human ribosomal protein gene. However, no
such insertion or deletion of nucleotides was observed in
the genomes of the cell-culture adapted JE03-1760F and
HE-JF5/15F strains during the long-term passages. No
cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in the PLC/PRF/5
and A549 cells during these serial passages of the JE03-
1760F and HE-JF5/15F strains, despite differences in the
durations of the cell culture and the changing profile of the
HEV load in each passage.
Although HepG2 and Huh7 cells are not permissive for
the wild-type JE03-1760F and HE-JF5/15F strains of feces
origin, recent studies have demonstrated that both these
cell lines are capable of supporting the successful propagation and passages of cell-culture adapted JE03-1760F
and HE-JF5/15F strains (unpublished observations).
Propagation of HEV strains found in circulating
blood in cultured cells
HEV is an emerging infectious threat to blood safety.
There have been a number of publications delineating this
threat by providing evidence of the transmissibility of this
virus through transfusions. Transfusion-transmitted HEV
infection has been reported not only in developing countries (genotype 1) [56], but also in industrialized countries,
including Japan and the United Kingdom (genotypes 3 and
4) [57–60], thus suggesting that HEV in circulating blood
can also grow in cultured cells. Therefore, this study
examined whether HEV strains in serum samples could
replicate in PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cells and release infectious progeny viruses into the culture media; this was
investigated in relation to the HEV load, genotype, and
co-existence of HEV antibodies [61]. The study revealed
that various HEV strains of genotype 1, 3, or 4 in the serum
samples obtained from patients with autochthonous or
imported hepatitis E could infect and replicate efficiently in
PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cells. Notably, HEV strains in all
serum samples tested, with or without concurrent HEV
antibodies, were successfully propagated in cultured cells
when inoculated at an HEV load of C105 copies per well in
a six-well microplate (Fig. 1). Progeny viruses of serumderived HEV strains in the culture supernatant were successfully passaged in PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cells, thus
indicating that the HEV progenies of serum origin released
from cultured cells were infectious, similar to those of
feces origin [61].
Characterization of HEV particles in culture
supernatant, circulating blood, and feces
An examination of the physicochemical properties of HEV
particles in the culture supernatant revealed the HEV particles in cell culture to have a buoyant density of
1.15–1.16 g/ml in sucrose gradients [62], which was
identical to the finding in serum samples, irrespective of
the presence or absence of circulating anti-HEV antibodies,
but markedly lower than that in feces, which peaked at
1.27–1.28 g/ml [61] (Table 1). The great majority (more
than 90 %) of HEV particles in the circulation were free of
immunoglobulins even in the presence of IgM anti-HEV
antibodies [61]. Similar to cell culture-generated HEV
particles, HEV particles in serum were non-neutralizable

123

by immune sera and anti-ORF2 monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) that could definitely neutralize the infection of
HEV in feces in the cell culture system [44, 62], and few or
no virus particles in either the serum or cell culture were
captured by anti-ORF2 mAb and anti-ORF3 mAb. Interestingly, however, after treatment with a detergent such as
deoxycholic acid, Tween 20, or NP-40, the binding efficiency of HEV particles in serum and culture supernatant
to both anti-ORF2 and anti-ORF3 mAbs markedly
increased [61], thus suggesting that the HEV virion in both
the serum and culture medium possesses the ORF3 protein
on its surface, in association with lipids [19].
The detergent-treated HEV virions in the serum and
culture medium were partially neutralized by anti-HEV
antibodies, which may be ascribable to the incomplete
exposure of ORF2 and ORF3 proteins after treatment with
detergent only. The cell culture-produced and serum HEV
particles treated with both detergent and protease, with a
buoyant density of 1.27-1.28 g/ml in sucrose (Table 1), can
be neutralized by an anti-HEV immune serum and antiORF2 mAb, thus indicating that virions treated with lipid
solvent and proteases, possessing the same characteristics
as virions from feces, are neutralizable by anti-HEV
immune sera. The ORF3 protein is required for virion
release from cultured cells. Taken together, these findings
indicate that it is very likely that HEV particles are released
from both infected cultured cells (in vitro) and infected
hepatocytes (in vivo) as lipid-associated virions, accompanied by ORF3 protein, and that the ORF3 protein and
lipids are dissociated from the virion after shedding in the
bile duct, which contain detergent (deoxycholic acid), and
then in the duodenum, which contain protease (trypsin)
secreted from the pancreas (Fig. 2).
HEV attaches to the host cell via a specific high-affinity
receptor and enters the cytoplasm by clathrin-mediated
endocytosis [63]. However, virtually nothing is known
about the mechanism by which HEV enters susceptible
cells. It is interesting that non-neutralizable HEV particles
in serum samples and culture supernatant, which are
associated with lipids and band at 1.15-1.16 g/ml in
sucrose gradients, can bind to cultured cells, although
inefficiently, and can be propagated in cultured cells [19].
Furthermore, a lipid solvent did not abolish or increase the
infectivity of the HEV progenies obtained from infected
cells, and both the cell culture-generated HEV particles and
those that were treated with detergent and/or protease were
propagated in the cultured cells with nearly identical efficiency [61], regardless of the presence or absence of the
ORF3 protein and lipids on the surface. These findings,
taken together, suggest that it is unlikely that only a fraction of HEV particles in the serum samples and culture
media, partially unaccompanied by lipids, can bind to the

to provide a plausible explanation(s) for this intriguing
observed phenomenon, future studies must therefore elucidate whether and how non-neutralizable HEV particles in
the serum and culture supernatant can enter susceptible
cells.
Propagation of HEV strains in cell culture
across species barrier
Shukla et al. [55] recently showed that genotype 3 viruses
infected swine cells (LLC-PK1) more efficiently than
human cells (HepG2/C3A). A549 cells can also support the
replication of swine HEV of genotype 4 in a fecal specimen
[64]. However, it remains unclear whether swine HEV
strains of genotypes 3 and 4 recovered from domestic pigs
and wild boar can grow as efficiently as human HEV
strains in human cultured cells, irrespective of the source of
the inoculum virus. Therefore, to investigate this problem,
liver homogenate, serum and fecal specimens obtained
from HEV-infected domestic pigs and wild boar were
employed as inocula, and various swine and boar HEV
strains were cultivated in A549 and PLC/PRF/5 cells and
their replication efficiency was evaluated in relation to the
viral load and origin of the inoculum [65].
Inoculation of three HEV RNA-positive liver homogenate samples with a higher HEV load (4.0 9 104
–6.6 9
105 copies per well) obtained from raw pig liver, sold as
food that had been purchased from grocery stores and kept
frozen at -80 C [6], released HEV progeny viruses into
the culture medium. Figure 3a shows that HEV RNA was
first detected in the culture medium of A549 cells on the
2nd to 6th day post-inoculation (dpi), with a viral load of
40–220 copies/ml, and continued to increase thereafter,
with the highest titer of 1.1–7.3 9 107 copies/ml on
30 dpi. HEV progenies were also released into the culture
medium upon the inoculation of fecal and serum samples
[65].
Efficient viral multiplication was observed upon the
inoculation of four liver homogenate samples containing
boar HEV at an HEV load of 9.8 9 105
–6.6 9 106 copies
per well [65]. HEV RNA was initially detected on day 2
and reached the highest titer of 9.8 9 107
–3.5 9
108 copies/ml on day 50 (Fig. 3b). Overall, HEV progenies
were released into the culture medium when swine and boar

HEV strains were inoculated at an HEV load of
C2.0 9 104 copies per well, irrespective of the inoculum
source, although the HEV RNA titers in the culture medium of
30 dpi differed markedly, ranging from 1.0 9 102 to
1.1 9 107 copies/ml, by inoculum, when inoculated at viral
loads ranging from 2.0 9 104 to 1.1 9 105 copies per well
[65]. In sharp contrast, no progenies were detectable in the
culture supernatant upon the inoculation of swine and boar
HEV strains at an HEV load of\1.8 9 104 copies per well.
These results indicate that swine HEV strains of genotypes 3
and 4 from domestic pigs and wild boar can replicate as efficiently as human HEV strains in human cultured cells, thereby
supporting the zoonotic nature of HEV in the culture systems
for HEV as well.
Construction of infectious cDNA clones of wild-type
and mutated HEV genomes and analysis of the function
of the ORF3 protein in virion egress
A full-length infectious cDNA clone (pJE03-1760F/wt) of
the genotype 3 JE03-1760F strain was developed [66].
The inoculation of the pJE03-1760F/wild-type (wt) virus
into PLC/PRF/5 or A549 cells in six-well plates at
1.0 9 105 copies per well allowed the cDNA-derived virus
to grow as efficiently as the original feces-derived virus in
both PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cells, thus reaching 106 copies/
ml on 30 dpi in the respective cells. Therefore, the reverse
genetics system for HEV is utilizable in a robust cell culture system to elucidate the mechanism of HEV replication
and the functional roles of HEV proteins.
Previous studies suggested the expression of the intact
ORF3 protein to be essential for the infection of animals
[67, 68], but this protein is not required for infection and
virion morphogenesis in vitro [69]. However, an immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay using an anti-ORF3 mAb suggested the
presence of ORF3 protein on the surfaces of cell culturegenerated HEV particles and those in circulating blood [61,
70]. Therefore, to examine whether ORF3 protein is
responsible for virion morphogenesis and viral release from
infected cells [19], a full-length cDNA clone of an ORF3-
deficient mutant (pJE03-1760F/DORF3; hereafter, DORF3
for simplicity) was constructed by mutating the initiation
codon of the ORF3 gene (ATG to GCA) on the pJE03-
1760F/wt cDNA clone (Fig. 4a).
The culture supernatant of cells transfected with RNA
transcripts of the DORF3 cDNA clone was inoculated onto
A549 cells to determine whether the DORF3 mutant virus
in the culture medium of the transfected cells was infectious and replication-competent and, if so, whether HEV
virions were released from the DORF3 mutant-infected
cultured cells. Viral RNA was nearly undetectable in the
culture supernatant of A549 cells inoculated with the
DORF3 mutant (Fig. 4b). Despite the significantly lower
levels of HEV RNA in the culture supernatant of DORF3
mutant-inoculated A549 cells, the intracellular HEV RNA
was nearly equal to that observed in cultured cells inoculated with the pJE03-1760F/wt (Fig. 4b). When applied to
sucrose density ultracentrifugation, the DORF3 mutant in
the culture supernatant of the transfected cells banded at
1.27–1.28 g/ml, in contrast to the pJE03-1760F/wt virus,
which peaked at 1.15–1.16 g/ml (Fig. 4c) [19].
The advent of an infectious cDNA clone of genotype 1
HEV (the Sar55 strain), allowed Emerson et al. [20] to
confirm the findings of the previous study conducted by
using a genotype 3 infectious cDNA clone of the JE03-
1760F strain, which reported the ORF3 protein to be
essential for virion egress from infected cells, the ORF3
protein to be present on the surfaces of HEV particles
released from infected cells, and the HEV particles
released from infected cells to be lipid-associated [19].
Genotypes 2 and 4 HEVs have not yet been examined for
the function of the ORF3 protein in virion egress using
infectious cDNA clones. However, given its conservation,
Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of the ‘‘enveloped’’ and ‘‘non-enveloped’’
HEV particles in infected hosts. HEV particles excreted from the liver
into the circulation are likely to be present as ‘‘enveloped’’ virus with
cellular membranes and open reading frame 3 (ORF3) proteins on
their surfaces, while the ORF3 protein and cellular membranes are
dissociated from the virion after shedding in the bile duct, which
contains detergent (deoxycholic acid) and then in the duodenum,
which contains protease (trypsin), both secreted from the pancreas

123

and because the association of HEV virions of genotype 1,
3, or 4 in the blood circulation with ORF3 protein and
lipids on the surface has been noted [61], it is very likely
that the function of the ORF3 protein related to HEV
morphogenesis is common to all HEV strains, irrespective
of genotype.
A Pro-rich sequence is present in the C-terminal region
of the ORF3 protein in all mammalian and avian HEV
strains, and the Pro, Ser, Ala, and Pro (PSAP) motif
between amino acid residues 95 and 98 of the ORF3 protein (Fig. 4a) is conserved among all known HEV strains,
including avian HEV strains [71]. The introduction of
amino acid substitutions (two Pro-to-Leu replacements) in
the PSAP motif (mutLSAL) (Fig. 4a) significantly reduced
the virus yield in the culture supernatant, similar to an
ORF3-deficient variant, DORF3 (Fig. 4b). Notably, no
significant difference in the intracellular HEV RNA level
was observed upon inoculation of the wild-type virus and
its ORF3 variants (Fig. 4b). The particles generated in the
culture supernatant of the mutLSAL RNA-transfected cells
banded at 1.26–1.27 g/ml, similar to the particles in the
DORF3 RNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4c), thus suggesting
that the PSAP motif in the ORF3 protein is indispensable
for the formation of membrane-associated HEV particles.
Viral particles in the culture supernatant of the mutLSAL
RNA-transfected cells were efficiently captured by an antiORF2 mAb, but not by an anti-ORF3 mAb, which was
similar to the findings observed in the supernatant of the
DORF3 RNA-transfected cells, with or without prior
treatment with 0.1 % sodium deoxycholic acid. These
results indicate that an intact PSAP motif in the ORF3
protein plays a pivotal role in the release of HEV particles
having lipid-associated membranes and ORF3 protein [71].
Cellular factors involved in the release
of hepatitis E virions
Recent studies have revealed that viral matrix proteins play
critical roles during the later stages of virus budding in
many enveloped RNA viruses, including retroviruses,
orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and filoviruses: these
viral proteins possess a so-called late (L)-domain containing P(T/S)AP, PPxY, and YxxL, which are critical motifs
for the efficient release of an enveloped virus [72–76], and
they hijack host proteins in the vacuolar protein sorting
pathway [75, 77]. This pathway gives rise to multivesicular
bodies (MVBs), which are topologically identical to virus
budding [78]. The PTAP motif was first identified in the
Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
has been reported to bind to the tumor susceptibility gene
101 (Tsg101), which is identified as a critical cellular
protein required for the budding of enveloped viruses, e.g.,
HIV and Ebola virus, from the plasma membrane [79, 80].

not illustrated in the Fig., a Ser-to-Leu mutation at aa 87, which is
identical to the majority of reported genotype 3 HEV strains, was also
introduced in the mutLSAL. The stop codon of the ORF1 gene and
the proposed initiation codons of the ORF2 and ORF3 genes are
indicated by lines above the nucleotides. The dots represent
nucleotides identical to those at the top (wild-type). The initiation site
of subgenomic mRNA transcription [92] is depicted by a vertical line
with an arrow facing right. The DORF3 mutant was generated by
mutating ATG (Met) to GCA (Ala) at the start codon of the ORF3 gene.
The mutLSAL mutant was produced by converting CCC (Pro) to CTC
(Leu) at the 95th codon and CCT (Pro) to CTT (Leu) at the 98th codon of
the ORF3 gene. b HEV RNA in the culture supernatant (upper panel) and

indicate the requirement of an intact PSAP motif in the
ORF3 protein for the formation and release of membraneassociated HEV particles possessing ORF3 proteins on the
surface, in agreement with the observation by Emerson
et al. [20], who reported the PxxP motif of the ORF3
protein to play an important role in virus egress and
infection.
When the intracellular localization of the ORF3 protein
and Tsg101 was examined by immunofluorescence
confocal microscopy, a high degree of co-localization of
wild-type ORF3 protein and Tsg101 was observed in the
cytoplasm. In contrast, the mutLSAL ORF3 protein showed
essentially no signal of co-localization with Tsg101,
despite the fact that the mutated ORF3 protein showed an
intracellular localization similar to that of the wild-type
ORF3 protein. These results support the notion that the
ORF3 protein interacts with Tsg101 through its PSAP
motif in infected cells [82]. The effect on virion release
from infected cells was examined by utilizing small
interfering (si) RNA against Tsg101 to examine whether
Tsg101 was functionally involved in HEV budding through
its interaction with the ORF3 protein. The depletion of
endogenous Tsg101 by siRNA led to a significant reduction
of HEV release in cultured cells, although the HEV RNA
replication was not affected by the transfection of siRNA
against Tsg101. These results indicate that Tsg101 plays a
pivotal role specifically in the release of HEV virions, thus
corroborating the role attributed to Tsg101 in the budding
of other known enveloped viruses such as retroviruses [80],
although HEV is known to be a non-enveloped virus. It was
also strongly suggested that HEV utilizes the mechanism of
cellular MVB sorting, because Tsg101 is a component of
the endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I
complex which is involved in MVB sorting.
The vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4 (Vps4)
ATPase is one of the final effectors in the MVB pathway
and functions downstream of Tsg101, and therefore it was
hypothesized that dominant negative (DN) mutants of Vps4
might disrupt virion release. In fact, DN mutants of
Vps4 inhibit the budding of infectious HIV particles in
co-transfection experiments [76]. The overexpression of
DN mutants of Vps4 inhibited the release of HEV substantially. The reduction in the release of HEV particles in
the presence of DN mutants of Vps4 appears to be due to a
specific block in the formation of membrane-associated
virions. It is likely that Vps4 is required for the final step in
the formation of membrane-associated HEV particles.
These results suggest that HEV utilizes the MVB pathway
for virion egress, and that the enzymatic activities of Vps4
are involved in the virus release [82].
Whether the membrane-associated HEV particles are
generated intracellularly or at the cell surface remains
unclear. HEV particles with lipid membranes and the
ORF3 protein on their surfaces were found abundantly in
the lysates of cells infected with wild-type HEV (unpublished observations), and the ORF3 protein and Tsg101
were co-localized in the cytoplasm, as described above,
thus suggesting that mature membrane-associated HEV
particles are generated before their release from the surfaces of infected cells. An immunofluorescence assay using
anti-ORF3 mAb and antibody against CD63, another MVB
marker protein, revealed that the ORF3 protein was
co-localized with CD63 in the HEV-infected cells [82].
Taken together, these findings indicate that HEV likely
utilizes the cellular ESCRT mechanism in the cytoplasm,
but not at the cell surface, to induce the release from
infected cells. Further studies are needed to clarify whether
membrane-associated HEV particles really bud into the
intracellular vesicles formed in infected cells, and whether
they are derived from the Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi
network (TGN), or endosomes, and also whether the
mature virions are released into the extracellular environment by the exosomal secretion pathway, similar to the
pathway in known enveloped viruses such as the hepatitis
C virus (HCV) [83, 84].
Although it has been reported that monotherapy using
interferon or ribavirin inhibits the viral replication in
immunocompromised patients with chronic HEV infection
following solid-organ transplantation [85, 86], no approved
antiviral drugs are yet available to prevent or treat HEVassociated diseases. A conserved virus release mechanism
would therefore be likely to be an excellent target for
antiviral drugs, and human tetherin/BST-2 is reported to
inhibit the release of HIV, filoviruses, and herpesviruses
[87–91]. It may therefore be interesting to analyze whether
tetherin/BST-2 inhibits the virion release of HEV. A better
understanding of the mechanisms whereby viruses recruit
cellular factors should therefore help greatly in the development of new therapeutic strategies.
Conclusion
This article has described the development of the first
efficient cell culture systems for a wide variety of HEV
strains from humans, pigs, and wild boar. The unique
characteristics of cell-culture-generated HEV particles and
those in the circulating blood were reviewed, and the
current knowledge on virion egress obtained by the
established cell culture models, reinforced by a reverse
genetics system, was introduced. These cell culture systems, with the aid of reverse genetics systems, will solve
many mysteries and answer numerous questions surrounding the epidemiology of HEV infection, and will be
useful for the further understanding of the HEV life cycle
and the investigation of potential antiviral drugs, as well as
