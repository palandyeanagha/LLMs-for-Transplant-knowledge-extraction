Abstract
Purpose of Review In the setting of kidney transplantation, the ureter is a common source for complications. As a result,
prevention of ureteral complications and their management is of crucial importance. In this context, the purpose of this review
is to summarize recent literature on the ureter in the kidney transplant setting with a special focus on new findings. We conducted
a PubMed and Medline search over the last 10 years to identify all new publications related to ureteroneoimplantations, stents and
management of complications in the kidney transplant setting.
Recent Findings Performance of the “Lich-Gregoir” technique for ureteroneocystostomy seems to be favourable in regard to
postoperative complications when compared with other methods described in the literature. Moreover, major urologic complications can be further reduced by ureteral stenting.
Summary A new approach for management of ureteral strictures in renal transplants is presented. We discussed the usage of a
ureteral stent covered with a biostable polymer aiming to prevent tissue ingrowth into the lumen as a new option for management
of ureteral stricture in the kidney transplant setting.

Introduction
In the setting of renal transplantation, postoperative complications and a resulting graft impairment or even graft loss are
major issues. Besides acute graft rejection and vascular complications, ureteral complications such as urinary leak at site of
the ureterovesical junction and ureteral obstruction may occur,
especially in the first 3 months after kidney transplantation
[1••, 2, 3]. Since a large part of complications are related to
the ureter and in this conjunction mostly arise from
ureteroneocystostomy, the purpose of this review is to provide
an update and summarise recent literature dealing with the
ureter in the kidney transplant setting [4].
Performing the ureterovesical anastomosis in kidney transplantation is one of the major steps during the surgery. There
are predominantly two commonly used procedures for
ureteroneocystostomy: “Politano-Leadbetter” (PL) and
“Lich-Gregoir” (LG). However, several fewer known
methods exist including the “U-stitch” procedure and the
“full-thickness” technique [5, 6]. In special situations, performance of ureteroureterostomy or pyeloureterostomy is justified [7, 8].
Usually the anastomosis is easy to perform if the recipient has a normal bladder capacity. If the patient has no
residual urinary excretion, the anastomosis can be more
difficult. In these cases, the risk of complications is much
higher. Such complications are e.g. urinary leak, ureteral
necrosis or ureteral stenosis and are commonly stated with
an incidence of up to 12.5% in literature [9–11]. This can
also increase the mortality rate [1 0]. Urologic
complications—especially ureteral obstruction and urinary leak—are shown to be significantly reduced by generally stenting the ureter [2, 12].

Ureteral strictures are one possible complication in kidney
transplant recipients. Management of ureteral strictures is often conducted by placement of a ureteral stent. In this review,
we also discuss usage of the lately introduced Allium-stent as
a management option for ureteral strictures in renal transplant
recipients [13].
Material and Method
The present study conducted a PubMed and Medline search
over the last 10 years to identify all new publications related to
ureteroneoimplantations, stents and the management of complications in the kidney transplant setting. Original studies and
review articles were included. Keywords used for the search
were “kidney transplantation”, “DJ-Stent”, “Allium-Stent”,
“Ureteroneocystostomy”, “Politano-Leadbetter”, “LichGregoir” and “ureteral complications”. Abstracts were
screened for relevance of content in terms of the subjects
mentioned above. When the abstract was considered relevant,
the article was retrieved, read and analysed. The search was
complemented by examining the reference list of relevant
publications—especially when a certain information was evaluated as crucially important. In the end, information was included in this review if perceived essential or new.
Ureteroneocystostomy and Surgical Options
Several techniques can be used for ureteroneocystostomy.
The most common procedures are the antirefluxive techniques “Politano-Leadbetter” (PL) and “Lich-Gregoir”
(LG). For the intravesical PL technique, one cystotomy
is performed in order to access the interior of the bladder.
Additionally, another intravesical cystotomy follows with
a subsequent insertion of the ureter into the urinary bladder. The LG technique utilises only one cystotomy in
order to perform an extravesical anastomosis between ureter and the mucosa of the bladder [5, 6]. As antirefluxive
techniques, both procedures have the creation of a submucosal tunnel in common. However, LG is a wellestablished technique that is widely used and has several
advantages when compared with PL. For LG, a shorter
ureter can be used with minimal handling when compared
with PL. By using this technique, ischemic injury of the
distal ureter with a potentially higher complication rate
resulting at the ureterovesical junction may be prevented
[5, 6, 14]. Moreover, unlike the “Politano-Leadbetter”
technique, only one cystotomy is needed for “LichGregoir”, contributing to a decreased risk for urinary leak
and hematuria [6]. Since only one cystotomy is needed for
LG, this technique is less time-consuming and easier to
perform [5].
Besides “Politano-Leadbetter” and “Lich-Gregoir”, there
are other surgical methods for the implementation of the
ureterovesical anastomosis. One of those methods is called
the “U-stitch” technique. Performance of the “U-stitch” technique is—in comparison with the previously mentioned
techniques—even faster. For this extravesical and
antirefluxive technique, the ureter is initially inserted into the
interior of the bladder through an artificial opening.
Subsequently, the distal end of the ureter is sutured with only
one or two U-stitches from the interior of the bladder through
the bladder wall. The threads are tied externally, so that the
ureter is anchored from the inside of the bladder [5, 6].
Although this technique is advantageous in terms of surgery
time, it is associated with a higher risk for urologic complications, especially hematuria. Therefore, most kidney transplant
centres favour the “Lich-Gregoir” technique [5, 15, 16].
Another possible but less known and less common option
is the so-called “full-thickness” (FT) technique [17]. This
technique also consists of only one cystotomy. In contrast to
PL and LG, the extravesical full-thickness technique is implemented by suturing the ureter to the mucosa and muscle layer
of the bladder simultaneously without the creation of a submucosal tunnel [17]. Kayler et al. [17] compared LG with FT
in a retrospective study and showed promising results. The
authors demonstrated a lower incidence of anastomotic urinary leak for the FT technique. They assumed this result might
be associated with the thicker wall that has to be sutured with
the ureter, preventing the sutured layers from tearing away.
However, the number of studies analysing the “full-thickness”
technique is limited, and more research is needed.
As the most commonly used methods for
ureteroneocystostomy are LG and PL, the majority of studies
in the literature only compare these two techniques. Recent
studies comparing these two procedures demonstrated less
overall postoperative complications for LG compared with
PL [5, 6]. In a meta-analysis by Alberts et al. [6], urinary leak
and hematuria were shown to occur significantly less when
the LG technique is performed. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial by Slagt et al. [4] demonstrated fewer urinary tract
infections in connection with LG. However, there were no
differences between the two methods in terms of ureteral strictures and vesicoureteral reflux [6].
Due to the lower urinary tract complication rate, the
European Association of Urology recommends performing
the “Lich-Gregoir” technique in the setting of renal transplantation [18]. In Accordance with the recommendation of the
European Association of Urology, we also favour
implementing the LG technique for ureteroneocystostomy.
Owing to the lack of studies analysing the FT method and
since the U-stitch technique is accompanied by a higher complication rate, the “Lich-Gregoir” method seems to be the
most appropriate and advantageous method for
ureteroneocystostomy.

DJ-Stents Considerations
Urologic complications are a major issue in the setting of renal
transplantation, potentially resulting in graft impairment or
even graft loss [1••]. Mangus et al. [12] found out that the
incidence of postoperative urologic complications can be significantly reduced by stenting the ureter during surgery. In
their meta-analysis, they showed renal transplant recipients
receiving a stent during transplantation had a lower postoperative urologic complication rate (1.5%) compared with those
not stented (9.0%). In order to prevent and reduce the risk for
major urologic complications, several centres have implemented a routine use of ureteric stenting [2, 3]. Some centres
still favour selective stenting when postoperative complications are expected or a higher probability is expected [3, 19].
The European Association of Urology [18] recommends universal usage of stents in renal transplant recipients due to
strong evidence of preventing postoperative complications.
Benefits of stenting the ureter are especially associated with
facilitating the healing process of the performed anastomosis,
which is often the source of postoperative complications.
Stenting protects the ureter also from urinary leak.
Moreover, ureteral obstruction as a result of postoperative
swelling of the mucosa or external compression can be
prevented [1••, 12]. However, even though the benefits of an
inserted stent during implantation are indisputable, possible
complications should not be underestimated and should be
taken into consideration. The most common and important
complication associated with stents are urinary tract infections
(UTI) [2, 20]. Stented patients have higher rates of UTIs even
after stent removal [21]. Besides UTIs, also stent migration,
encrustation, pain and bladder discomfort may occur [1••, 2,
3]. Stents may also be forgotten in situ, which may lead to
further complications as reported by Bardapure et al. [22].
Although very rare, this should especially be kept in mind in
patients with recurrent UTI. Additionally, Siparsky et al. [23]
demonstrated a higher risk for BK virus in stented renal transplant recipients. BK virus may cause BK nephropathy,
resulting in graft impairment and even graft loss [23].
In general, stent-related complications are especially seen
in patients when the stent is left for a longer period in situ [2, 3,
20]. Patel et al. [1••] also demonstrated a better quality of life
in patients with early stent removal. However, there is no
consensus about the optimal time of stent removal. In most
centres, stents are removed between 2 and 6 weeks after transplantation [1••, 20]. Since a later stent removal shows a higher
risk for stent-related complications, some authors advocate an
early removal of the stent after 3 weeks [20]. Although stentrelated complications may be reduced by an early stent removal, there still is some concern about higher rates of urinary leak
and ureteric obstruction when stents are removed too early.
However, there is no doubt that a transplant ureteric stent
reduces the incidence of major urologic complications, even
when placed for a short period of time and removed after only
5 days [1••]. More research is needed in order to define and
determine an optimal stent removal time.
Ureteral Complications
In case of a ureteral stricture of the transplanted kidney, a
sufficient urinary drainage is often only possible by the placement of a ureteral stent. This is a good minimally invasive
option but is also associated with major limitations, such as
stent migration, incrustations with stent obstruction and urinary tract infections. Considering those limitations, a frequent
replacement every few months is necessary and therefore often reduces quality of life. Since 2005, a self-expanding, largecalibre ureteral stent is placed in patients with ureteral stenosis
observing good success and low complication rates. The metal
self-expanding component of the stent is made of a super
elastic nickel titanium alloy (nitinol). The entire stent is covered with a new biocompatible, biostable polymer to ensure
through its non-permeable characteristics a prevention of tissue ingrowth into the lumen and early encrustation [13].
Because of the large calibre of the implanted stent (24–
30 F), obstruction rates in literature are observed to be low
(2% and less in 12 months) [13, 24]. Concerning the placement of Allium-stents in a kidney transplant (Fig. 1), there are
only three reported cases in literature [13]. But knowing about
the good safety profile, the Allium-stent should be considered
in complicated cases (Fig. 2), although there seems to be an

even higher rate of dislocation due to the short ureter of the
kidney transplant.
Special Situations
As described above, there are several techniques for
ureteroneocystostomy. However, in some cases, performance
of ureteroneocystostomy is difficult or even impossible. In this
context, a short graft ureter remains a challenging issue for
surgeons. In addition, the ureter and its surrounding vessels
are sometimes damaged during organ procurement, potentially resulting in ischemia and ureteral necrosis. This bears the
risk for subsequent urologic complications, especially at the
ureterovesical junction. In these cases, ureteroureterostomy or
pyeloureterostomy are described as possible alternatives [7, 8,
18]. For pyeloureterostomy, the recipient’s ureter is cut and
sutured to the transplant pelvis [25]. Ureteroureterostomy is
conducted by suturing the spatulated donor ureter to the recipient’s ureter following a small incision in the recipient’s ureter
[8].
A meta-analysis by Suttle et al. [8] demonstrated a higher
risk for stricture, obstruction and stone formation when
ureteroureterostomy is performed. These complications especially occur at site of the anastomosis. However, there was no
statistically significant difference in the overall complication
rate between ureteroneocystostomy and ureteroureterostomy.
The latter technique even bears some advantages. Due to the
maintenance of a natural ureteral orifice with a natural
antirefluxing anatomy, a decreased risk for vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infection was demonstrated. Moreover,
the natural orthotopic orifice facilitates future endourologic
procedures [8]. However, this method should be selected only
in special cases, since there are fewer options for management
of complications once ureteroureterostomy or
pyeloureterostomy is performed [25]. Most transplant centres
use ureteroureterostomy or pyeloureterostomy when a complication affecting the initially performed ureterovesical anastomosis necessitates a reintervention [8, 25]. However, there
are only a small number of studies analysing these methods in
the setting of renal transplantation and more research needs to
be done.
Conclusion
In conclusion, performance of the “Lich-Gregoir” technique
for ureteroneocystostomy in conjunction with stenting the ureter seems to be the most favourable procedure in the setting of
renal transplantation. By choosing this technique, major postoperative complications can be minimised, resulting in a positive outcome for the patient and the graft function. However,
there is no consensus about the optimal stent removal time.
Further research needs to be done concerning stent removal
time and other methods for ureteroneocystostomy.
