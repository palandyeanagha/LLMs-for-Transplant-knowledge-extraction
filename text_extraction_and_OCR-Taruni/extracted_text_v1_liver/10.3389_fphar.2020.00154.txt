Major depressive disorder is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder with high rates of
recurrence and mortality. Many studies have supported that inflammatory processes
play a central role in the etiology of depression. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a
member of the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) family, regulates a variety of
pharmacological activities, including energy metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism,
and insulin sensitivity. In addition, recent studies showed that the administration of FGF21,
a regulator of metabolic function, had therapeutic effects on mood stabilizers, indicating
that FGF21 could be a common regulator of the mood response. However, few studies
have highlighted the antidepressant effects of FGF21 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
induced mice, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of FGF21 in depression has not
yet been elucidated. The purpose of the current study was to determine the
antidepressant effects of recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21). The effects of rhFGF21
on depression-like behaviors and the inflammatory signaling pathway were investigated in
both an LPS-induced mouse model and primary microglia in vitro. The current study
demonstrated that LPS induced depressive-like behaviors, upregulated proinflammatory
cytokines, and activated microglia in the mouse hippocampus and activated the
inflammatory response in primary microglia, while pretreatment with rhFGF21 markedly
improved depression-like behavior deficits, as shown by an increase in the total distance
traveled and number of standing numbers in the open field test (OFT) and a decrease in
the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST).
Furthermore, rhFGF21 obviously suppressed expression levels of the proinflammatory
cytokines interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and inhibited microglial activation and the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signing pathway.
Moreover, coadministration of rhFGF21 with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1
(FGFR1) inhibitor PD173074 significantly reversed these protective effects, indicating
that the antidepressant effects of rhFGF21 occur through FGFR1 activation. Taken
together, the results of the current study demonstrated for the first time that exogenous
rhFGF21 ameliorated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior by inhibiting microglial

expression of proinflammatory cytokines through NF-kB suppression. This new discovery
suggests rhFGF21 as a new therapeutic candidate for depression treatment.
Keywords: major depressive disorder, depressive-like behavior, FGF21, inflammation, NF-kB signaling pathway
INTRODUCTION
Major depression disorder (MDD), a mood disorder
characterized by the symptoms of a persistent feeling of
sadness, loss of interest, and worthlessness, affects
approximately 300 million people worldwide (Zhang et al.,
2019). A total of 0.8 million patients with depression commit
suicide annually (Lee et al., 2019). There are some clinical
antidepressants on the market, such as norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine
oxidase inhibitors; however, only one-third of patients respond to
these therapeutics (Li, 2019), which are often associated with
numerous side effects and a high risk of relapse after drug
withdrawal, such as the 61.8% relapse rate in the case of
fluoxetine (Andrews et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2019). Therefore,
further study to develop novel effective antidepressants is
urgently needed.
Several hypotheses to explain the pathology of depression,
including glutamatergic excitotoxicity, monoamine system
impairment, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction,
neuroinflammation, and neural plasticity and neurogenesis
disruption, have emerged (Taniguti et al., 2019). Among these
hypotheses, inflammatory processes have been suggested to be
involved in the etiology of depression in many studies
(Domingues et al., 2018). Increasing amounts of preclinical
and clinical research have shown that proinflammatory cytokines
might contribute to depression. The proinflammatory cytokines
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play
critical roles in the process of inflammation and can induce
depressive disorders (Wright et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2019). The
levels of IL-6 and TNF-awere reported to be increased in the blood
and cerebrospinal fluid of MDD patients (Syed et al., 2018).
Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a commonly used
proinflammatory endotoxin, can trigger microglial activation and
induce immune activation and behavioral changes that are similar
to the clinical symptoms of human depression (Adzic et al., 2015;
Taniguti et al., 2019). Therefore, mice were administered LPS to
serve as a model of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and
induce depression-like behaviors. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), a
major transcription factor, is involved in the activation of an
exceptionally large number of genes in response to inflammation.
Once stimulated by LPS, NF-kB translocates to the nucleus and
regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a,
interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and IL-6 (Lin et al., 2007; Domingues et al.,
2018; Muhammad et al., 2019).
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of the
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, is mainly expressed in
the liver and functions as a hormone. After its secretion, FGF21
regulates a variety of pharmacological activities; whole-body
energy metabolism, especially glucose and lipid metabolism;
and insulin sensitivity (Xu et al., 2009; Gaich et al., 2013; Pan
et al., 2018; Li, 2019). In addition, recent studies showed that the
administration of FGF21, a regulator of metabolic function, had
a therapeutic effect on mood stabilizers (Chang et al., 2018). In
bipolar disorder (BD) patients, the FGF21 level was significantly
enhanced after valproate treatment; however, there was no
significant difference between the FGF21 levels of healthy
control and BD patients, indicating that FGF21 may be a
common regulator of the mood response (Chang et al., 2018).
Moreover, a previous study reported a significant negative
association between cerebrospinal fluid FGF21 levels and Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in male Chinese subjects, but
not in female (Liu et al., 2017). These results further demonstrate
that FGF21 plays a role in mood regulation; however, the
mechanism by which FGF21 mediates mood disorders is
not clear.
In the current study, the effects of recombinant human FGF21
(rhFGF21) on the depression-like behaviors of LPS-induced
mice models were evaluated. The NF-kB signaling pathway is
involved in inflammatory events. Once stimulated by LPS, NFkB is phosphorylated and activated, and phosphorylated NF-kB
translocates into the nucleus and binds a consensus sequence in
targeted genes to regulate the expression of inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b (Yang M. et al.,
2018). Therefore, we speculated that the anti-depressive effect
of rhFGF21 is mediated by NF-kB signaling pathway regulation.
To confirm this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression levels of
inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of an LPS-induced
depression-like model and in primary microglia. Additionally,
the NF-kB signaling pathway was analyzed to further explore the
possible underlying mechanism of the antidepressant effects
of rhFGF21.

The secondary antibodies used in this study were goat anti-rabbit
IgG H&L (HRP) (No. ab6721) and Alexa Fluor ®488-conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit (No. ab150073) purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, MA, USA).
Animals
The experiments were conducted in male C57BL/6N mice (20–
25 g), which were purchased from the Animal Center of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). The animal use
and care protocol conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health
and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Wenzhou Medical University.
Drug Administration and Animal
Experimental Procedures
The experimental design and protocol used for the animal
experiment in this study are illustrated in Figure 1A. The mice
were divided into three groups randomly; (1) the control vehicle
(normal saline, NP) administered group; (2) the LPS + NP
treated group; (3) the LPS + rhFGF21 treated group. Mice
were pretreated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle or rhFGF21
(0.75, 1.5, and 3 mg/kg) twice daily for three consecutive days.
These doses were chosen because it has previously been shown
that rhFGF21 with the dose of 1.5 mg/kg dramatically attenuated
locomotor function deficits in mice (Jiang et al., 2018). One hour
after the last rhFGF21 administration on day 3, the mice were
treated i.p. with LPS (0.83 mg/kg) dissolved in sterile saline. The
concentration of LPS was based on the results of previous studies
(Tomaz et al., 2014; Taniguti et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a;
Wang et al., 2019b). The animals were subjected to following
behavioral tests 24 h after LPS. Then, the animals were deeply
anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation. The
hippocampal tissue was rapidly removed and stored at -80°C
until assays. NF-kB, iNOS, and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) protein levels were assessed by western blot
analysis (n = 5). Levels of the proinflammation factors IL1-b,
TNF-a, and IL-6 were determined by RT-PCR (n = 5). To detect
Iba1, NF-kB, and FGFR1 by immunofluorescence localization
(n = 4), mice were deeply anesthetized and subjected to cardiac
perfusion with saline followed by perfusion with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Their brains were rapidly removed

and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight for further
immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 1A).
Behavioral Assay
Depression behavior was monitored by increased duration of
immobility in the forced swim test (FST) and decreased sucrose
preference; meanwhile, sickness behavior was measured by body
weight loss, reduced food intake, and locomotor activity. It has
been reported that LPS-induced depression-like behaviors can be
dissociated from sickness from 24 h after LPS administration
(Walker et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2019). The sickness responses
and behavior (piloerection, ptosis and lethargy) was usually
measured during peak period of sickness at 6 h after LPS
administration (Silverman et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2019). In
our behavioral experiment, we forced on examining the effects of
rhFGF21 on depression-like behavior measured at 24 h after LPS,
which include FST and locomotor activity monitored by tail
suspension test (TST) and open field test (OFT) (n = 9) (Yu
et al., 2019).
The TST, a behavioral test used to evaluate depressive-like
behavior in animals, was conducted as previously described
(Steru et al., 1985; Lee et al., 2019) with slight modifications.
The TST was carried out in a soundproof box (40 × 20 × 60 cm)
with cameras on the side and bottom of the box. Briefly, a string
was fixed to each mouse with tape 1 cm from the tip of its tail.
The mice were 20 cm above the ground, and the test was carried
out for 6 min. The immobility time was recorded during 5 min of
a 6-min observation period.
The FST is a common behavior test used to evaluate
depression-like behavior. The immobility time after each mice
ceased struggling and remained floating motionless in the water
was recorded. A decrease in the duration of immobility is
indicative of an antidepressant-like effect (Porsolt et al., 1977).
In this test, mice were individually placed into a cylinder (25 cm
in height, 10 cm in diameter) containing water at a depth of 19
cm of water at 25 ± 1°C. After a habituation period (2 min), the
total amount of time each animal remained immobile during a 6-
min session was scored as the immobility time, as described
previously (Taniguti et al., 2019).
The OFT, a method used to evaluate the autonomous behavior,
inquiry behavior, and tension of experimental animals in new
environments, was carried out according to a previous study with
few modifications (Ieraci and Herrera, 2006). In brief, mice were
individually placed in the center of a black wooden box (50 × 50 × 50
cm) that served as the open field. Locomotion behavior indicated by
the number of standing number was recorded for 5 min using a
camera and analyzed using an open field experimental video
analysis system (Smart 3.0, Panlab SMART video tracking
system, Barcelona, Spain). The arena floor was cleaned with a
10% ethanol solution between trials.
Primary Rat Microglia Culture
Primary rat microglia cultures were prepared from the cerebral
cortices of 1–2-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups with
mild trypsinization as previously described with minor
modifications (Lin et al., 2017). Briefly, after removing the
meninges of the brain, the cortical cortices were dissected and
cut into small, 2-mm pieces, and tissues were digested with 0.25%
trypsin for 30 min at 37°C. The tissues were suspended in
DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin and mechanically triturated with a plastic P1000
pipette tip. Then, the mixed cells were passed through a 70-mm
nylon mesh cell strainer and plated on 6-well plates or cell
culture dishes. After three days, the medium was completely
replaced and changed every three days with fresh medium. After
approximately 14 days, the mixed cells achieved 90% confluency,
and microglia were isolated from mixed glial cultures via mild
trypsinization according to our previous study (Lin et al., 2017).
Mixed glial cultures were incubated with a trypsin solution
containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min to detach a layer
of cells. Primary microglial cells remained attached to the bottom
of the plate and were used for further study.
Western Blot Analysis
Total protein from brain hippocampal tissue and primary
microglia was extracted using protein extraction reagents
containing 1% protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nuclear
and cytoplasmic protein was purified using a Nuclear and
Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology,
Shanghai,China). The protein content of the sampleswas measured
by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China). An equivalent amount of protein (30 mg) was separated on
an SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto a Polyvinylidene
Fluoride (PVDF) membrane. After being blocked with 5% nonfatmilkin Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% Tweenfor 2 h at
room temperature, the membranes were further incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (a 1:400 dilution of antiFGFR1, and 1:1,000 dilution of anti-p-FGFR1, anti NF-kB, antip-NF-kB, anti-BDNF, and b-Actin). After three washes with TBST,
the membraneswere incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,
the immunoreactive protein bands were developed and visualized
with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Biological
Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel), and the band densities
were quantified using Image Lab 5.0 software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Immunofluorescence Analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to determine the
localization of Iba1 in the mice brain hippocampal tissue. In
brief, the whole brain was post-fixed by 4% PFA for 12 h,
embedded in paraffin, and cut into section (5 µm thick),
followed by mounted on slides. Sections were deparaffinized
and rehydrated. Then tissue was incubated with 3% H2O2 for 15
min, followed blocked nonspecific binding in 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 37°C. Then sections were treated
with primary antibodies anti-Iba1 (1:1,000), NF-kB (1:1,000),
FGFR1 (1:1,000) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with
AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000)
at 37°C for 1 h. Then, the nuclei were stained with DAPI for
7 min. The immunostained sections were observed and imaged
using a Nikon ECLPSE 80i fluorescence microscope (Nikon,
Tokyo, Japan). Three indexes of microglia activation (number,
soma size, and process length) were measured according to the
previous study (Tang et al., 2018). The density of Iba1 positive

cells were automatically analyzed by Image-Pro plus 6.0 software
(Bethesda MD, USA) at ×10 magnification in a defined area. The
area of microglia soma and the microglia process length were
measured at ×20 magnification by Image-Pro plus 6.0 software.
For each group, at least six representstive images were taken
from four mice.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye was applied to
measure whether rhFGF21 affected the mRNA expression level
of pro-inflammation cytokines including IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL6. Total RNA was extracted from mice brain hippocampal tissue
and primary microglia by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
residual genomic DNA was removed by RQ1 RNase-Free
DNase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), and 1 mg of the total
RNA from each sample was applied for complementary DNA
(cDNA) synthesis using the PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit
(TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan). Real-time qRT-PCR was performed
in 96-well plates using a quantitative PCR system (CFX
ConnectTM Real-Time System, Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Each
reaction mixture consisted of 10 ml of the SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 ml of
the forward and reverse primers (5 pmol each), 25 ng of the
cDNA, and diethylpyrocarbonate water for a final volume of
20 ml. The oligonucleotide PCR primer pairs are listed in Table 1,
purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The cycling
program was an initial hold at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 62°C for 30 s,
and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The mRNA expression levels of
the target genes were normalized to the mRNA expression level
of the housekeeping gene b-actin, and analyzed by the 2–DDCT
method. The results are expressed as the means ± SEMs of
duplicate samples from three independent experiments.
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM from at least three
independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). Statistical significance between groups was determined
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)followed byTurkey's test
using. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Endogenous FGF21 Was Reduced
in the Hippocampus of the LPS-Induced
Mouse Brain
FGF21 plays an important role in mood regulation, and its levels
were significantly increased in BD patients after treatment with
the antidepressant drug valproate (Chang et al., 2018). Therefore,
we detected the endogenous expression levels of both FGF21
protein and FGF21 mRNA. LPS treatment significantly
decreased the endogenous FGF21 protein (Figures 1B, C) and
mRNA (Figure 1D) expression levels compared to those in
saline-treated mice (control group).
Exogenous rhFGF21 Administration
Alleviated Depressive-Like Behavior
Induced by LPS
To evaluate the effects of rhFGF21 on depressive-like behavior
induced by LPS, the OFT, FST, and TST were performed. Mice
were pretreated with saline or rhFGF21 (0.75, 1.5, and 3 mg/kg,
i.p.) for three days, followed by LPS administration (0.83 mg/kg,
i.p.). In the OFT, a general measure of curiosity and detective
behavior, the total distance traveled, line crossings, and number
of standing events are used to assess locomotor activity. LPS
significantly suppressed the total distance traveled and number
of standing events compared with those in the control group
(Figures 2A, B). Pretreatment with different concentrations of
rhFGF21 significantly improved the decreased total distance
traveled (Figure 2A) and number of standing events caused by
LPS treatment (Figure 2B). In the FST, a putative indicator of
behavioral despair, LPS administration markedly increased the
mouse immobility time compared with that of the control group,
and rhFGF21 treatment significantly decreased the increased
immobility time induced by LPS (Figure 2C). In the TST, a
classic method to assess mood, the time taken until the mouse
remained immobile was measured. LPS significantly increased
the immobility time during suspension, indicating that LPS
induced depression-like behaviors. rhFGF21 administration
significantly reduced immobility compared with that in the
LPS-treated group (Figure 2D). As shown by behavioral
analyses, pretreatment with rhFGF21 at doses of 0.75, 1.5, and
3 mg/kg significantly alleviated LPS-induced depression
behavioral deficits; however, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg rhFGF21 had a
greater effect than 0.75 mg/kg rhFGF21. Therefore, rhFGF21 at a
dose of 1.5 mg/kg was applied in further studies. Moreover,
rhFGF21 without LPS administration did not change the total
distance traveled, or number of standing events in the OFT or the
immobility time of the mice in the FST and TST (Figures 3A–
D). These results demonstrate that rhFGF21 improved
depression-like behaviors induced by LPS and was effective
only in disease conditions.

committed suicide, microglial activation was observed, indicating
that microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation in the
brain during the pathogenesis of depression (Brites and Fernandes,
2015). The transfer of microgliafrom a ramified status to an activated
status is marked by reduced process length and swollen soma
(Kettenmann et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2018). To further investigate
the antidepressant effect of rhFGF21 on the inflammatory response,
microglial activation in the mouse hippocampus was assessed by
immunofluorescence labeling to determine the number, soma area,
and process length of microglia. Iba1 immunofluorescence
assessment demonstrated that LPS exposure significantly enhanced
the number of microglia (Figures 4A, B, D) and activated microglia,
as indicated by an increased soma area (Figures 4A, B, E) and shorter
ramified processes (Figures 4A, B, F) compared with the control
group. Interestingly, after pretreatment with rhFGF21 for 3 days,
LPS-induced changesinmicroglial numbers andmorphologiesin the
hippocampus were significantly reversed (Figure 4).
Exogenous rhFGF21 Administration
Reduced the Production of Proinflammatory
Cytokines Induced by LPS Through
Inhibiting NF-kB Signaling Pathway
Microglial activation can induce the expression of inflammatory
cytokines. Therefore, the expression levels of the critical
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 were
measured by RT-PCR, and iNOs expression was measured by
western blotting. LPS exposure significantly triggered the mRNA
expression of cytokines in the hippocampus, as indicated by the
enhanced release of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. Conversely,
rhFGF21 administration markedly reversed LPS-induced
changes in the expression levels of these inflammatory
cytokines (Figures 5A–C). As shown by western blot analysis,
LPS administration significantly increased the production of
iNOS, and pretreatment with rhFGF21 considerably reversed
this increase (Figures 5D, E).
The expression of inflammatory factors in LPS-triggered
activated glial cells is regulated by NF-kB signaling pathways
(Chen G. et al., 2018; Muhammad et al., 2019). LPS activated the
NF-kB signaling pathway, as reflected by the increased nuclear level
of NF-kB protein. To investigate whether rhFGF21 can decrease
proinflammatory cytokine expression through inhibiting the NFkB signaling pathway, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were
extracted, and NF-kB was measured by western blotting with bactin and H3 used as cytoplasmic and nuclear housekeeping
proteins, respectively. There were no significant differences in
NF-kB expression levels in the cytoplasm of cells in the LPS and
rhFGF21 pretreatment groups (Figures 5D, F). However, LPS
treatment markedly increased nuclear NF-kB, and this increase
was markedly reversed by pretreatment with rhFGF21 for 3 days
(Figures 5D, G).
Exogenous rhFGF21 Could Function
Through FGFR1 Activation
FGFR1 is widely expressed throughout the nervous system and
contributes to hippocampal nerve growth and long-term
potentiation (Deng et al., 2019). To investigate whether the

effect of rhFGF21 on depression is mediated through the FGFR1
signaling pathway, we detected the expression levels of FGFR1
and p-FGFR1 by western blotting. LPS administration markedly
reduced FGFR1 and p-FGFR1 levels in the hippocampus
compared with those in the control group, and rhFGF21
treatment significantly rescued this decrease in hippocampal
FGFR1 and p-FGFR1 (Figures 6A–C).
BDNF is a major representative of the brain neurotrophic
factors, which are involved in cognition control. Cognitive
dysfunction in depressive patients is due to decreased levels of
BDNF (Domingues et al., 2018), and BDNF has been suggested to
influence the response to antidepressant treatment (Hennings et al.,
2019). Therefore, the effect of rhFGF21 on BDNF expression was
measured. LPS treatment significantly reduced BDNF expression
compared with that in the control group. Interestingly, rhFGF21
prevented the decrease in BDNF levels in the mouse hippocampus
induced by LPS administration (Figures 6A, D).
Exogenous rhFGF21 Administration Inhibited
Inflammatory Cytokines Expression Through
NF-kB Inhibition Mediated by FGFR1
Activation in Cultured Primary Microglia
To further evaluate the effects of rhFGF21 on the inflammatory
response of microglia and the underlying possible mechanism of
action of these effects, primary microglia were extracted and
isolated from the cerebral cortices of 1–2-day-old neonatal
Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Meanwhile, since FGF21 usually
functions by activating its receptor, to further investigate the
function of FGFR1, its receptor, the FGFR1-specific inhibitor
PD173074 (10 nM) was applied. Levels of the inflammatory
cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 were assessed by RT-PCR. The
mRNA levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 were higher in the
primary microglia of the LPS-treated group compared with the
control group, while rhFGF21 treatment significantly reduced
IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 upregulation induced by LPS.
Additionally, PD173074 significantly reversed the rhFGF21
treatment-induced downregulation of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6
mRNA (Figures 7A–C), indicating that rhFGF21 suppresses
inflammatory cytokine expression through activating FGFR1
in microglia.
NF-kB signaling pathway activation is involved and critical to
the development of depression as it triggers the production of
proinflammatory mediators (Su et al., 2017). To further explore
the anti-depressive effects mediated by the anti-inflammatory
mechanism of rhFGF21 in microglia, the protein levels of p-NFkB and NF-kB in cultured primary microglia were analyzed by
western blotting. The levels of p-NF-kB/NF-kB were
significantly higher in the LPS-treated group than in the
control group, and rhFGF21 could suppress NF-kB activation
stimulated by LPS administration, while cotreatment with the
FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 and rhFGF21 significantly reversed
the inhibitory effects of rhFGF21 on NF-kB (Figures 7D, E).
Consistent with the western blot data, LPS significantly

stimulated NF-kB activation and translocated into nucleus.
Exogenous rhFGF21 treatment obviously suppressed this
translocation. Whereas PD173074 co-administration
significantly reversed the effects of rhFGF21 on NF-kB (Figure
7G). Besides, the effect of rhFGF21 on BDNF expression was also
analyzed. Consistent with the results in the animal study, LPS
administration significantly reduced the level of BDNF
compared with that in the control group; however, rhFGF21
markedly upregulated BDNF expression, and as expected, the
FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 significantly reversed this
upregulation of BDNF (Figures 7D, F). To further confirm
whether rhFGF21 functions through its receptor FGFR1, the
immunofluorescence staining of FGFR1 was also performed.
Consistent with the result in the animal model, LPS markedly
suppressed FGFR1 activation, rhFGF21 rescued FGFR1
activation. Nevertheless, this was reversed by PD173074
coadministration (Figure 8). In summary, these results
indicate that rhFGF21 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine
expression through NF-kB inhibition mediated by
FGFR1 activation.
DISCUSSION
Studies have demonstrated the association of four FGFs, FGF2,
FGF9, FGF21, and FGF22, with depression, and the correlation
between these FGFs and depression has been well reviewed by
Deng et al. (2019). FGF2 is a neurotrophic factor widely
expressed in the CNS. Administration of a combination of the
antidepressants olanzapine and fluoxetine upregulated FGF2

levels (Maragnoli et al., 2004). Furthermore, FGF2 alleviated
depression-like behaviors in rats (Turner et al., 2008). Chronic
FGF-2 infusion blocked deficits in the sucrose preference test
(SPT) and FST caused by chronic unpredictable stress (Elsayed
et al., 2012). FGF9 is expressed mainly by neurons in the brain
(Garcès et al., 2000). Exogenous FGF9 administration was found
to increase depression-like behaviors, and exogenous FGF9
knockdown in the dentate gyrus improved anxiety-like
behavior in rats (Aurbach et al., 2015). The effect of FGF9 was
found to be opposite that of FGF2, which may be due to the
inverse relationship between FGF9 expression and FGF2
expression, and FGF2 and FGF9 may act as physiological
antagonists to mediate emotionality and vulnerability in mood
disorders (Aurbach et al., 2015). FGF22 is expressed mainly in
the skin and brain, and the deletion of endogenous FGF22
induced depression-like behavior, as shown by the FST, TST,
and SPT (Williams et al., 2016). Recent studies have reported
that FGF21 possesses various pharmacological activities
including its antioxidant activity, suppression of apoptosis
induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress (Liang et al., 2017),
and anti-inflammatory activity (Wang Q. et al., 2018; Zhang
et al., 2019). FGF21 weakly binds heparin and can pass through
the blood-brain barrier by simple diffusion (Hsuchou et al.,
2007). rhFGF21 has been demonstrated to have potent
therapeutic activity in various neurological disorders, such as
Parkinson's disease (Makela et al., 2014), Alzheimer's disease
(Amiri et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019), and ischemic stroke (Jiang
et al., 2018; Yang X. et al., 2018). In the current study,

pretreatment with rhFGF21 at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg
significantly prevented the increase in immobility time induced
by LPS administration in the FST and TST, indicating the
antidepressant-like effect of this large molecule. Notably, the
administration of rhFGF21 alone did not significantly alter
behavior compared with the control group, demonstrating that
rhFGF21 is effective under only disease conditions.
The central or peripheral administration of LPS, an
endotoxin, results in depression in animal models. Therefore,
LPS treatment is a validated approach to establish a depression
model, and LPS-induced depression-like animal models are
commonly used to assess the anti-depressive effects of
molecules. Various studies have demonstrated LPS-induced
behavioral impairments including increased immobile time in
the FST and TST (Brites and Fernandes, 2015), which is
consistent with the results of our study. Pretreatment with 1.5
mg/kg rhFGF21 for three days markedly prevented and
ameliorated LPS-induced depression-like behaviors (the
increased total distance traveled and number of line crossings
revealed by the OFT and decreased immobility time revealed by
FST and TST), indicating the potential antidepressant effects
of rhFGF21.
An increasing number of studies have suggested that
inflammation plays a crucial role in the process of MDD (Rush
et al., 2016; Yang M. et al., 2018). The activation of microglia, a
kind of macrophage in the brain, can trigger the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathological
development of neuroinflammation- and degeneration-related
diseases. The hippocampus is a brain region with a high density
of microglia. Some studies have shown that microglia is activated
in neuroinflammation, contributing to the development of
depression (Wang Q. et al., 2018). LPS administration induced
depression-like behaviors, triggered microglial activation in the
hippocampus, and upregulated proinflammatory cytokine
expression (Brites and Fernandes, 2015). Activated microglia
are the major source of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6, in the CNS (Yang M. et al., 2018).
Preclinical and clinical studies have proposed that
proinflammatory cytokines are associated with the
pathogenesis of depression (Karson et al., 2013) and that an
increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to
depressive-like behaviors (Raison et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2019).
In addition, various studies demonstrated increased serum levels
of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in patients with depression (Song
et al., 2009; Brites and Fernandes, 2015). In the current study,
rhFGF21 could inhibit the activation of microglia and reduce the
expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL1b, and IL-6 in the hippocampus of a depressive-like mouse
model induced by LPS administration and in primary microglia
stimulated by LPS.
The NF-kB signaling pathway plays a critical role in the
inflammatory response. Under normal conditions, NF-kB is

bound to the inhibitor IkB, and exists in an inactive state in the
cellular cytoplasm. However, once activated by an activator, such
as LPS, NF-kB is phosphorylated to p-NF-kB, which is then
released and translocated into the nucleus, where it promotes the
expression of inflammatory cytokines (Luo et al., 2014; Yang M.
et al., 2018). In the current study, we examined nuclear and
cytoplasmic levels of NF-kB in the hippocampus of an LPSinduced depression mouse model and determined the expression
levels of NF-kB and p-NF-kB in LPS-induced primary microglia
to assess the effects of rhFGF21 on the NF-kB signaling pathway.
rhFGF21 could reduce the increase in the ratio of p-NF-kB/NFkB induced by LPS and decrease the enhanced level of nuclear
NF-kB induced by LPS, indicating that rhFGF21 could inhibit
NF-kB activation and translocation into the nucleus. These
results indicated that rhFGF1 may exert an anti-inflammatory
effect by mediating the NF-kB signaling pathway and that
rhFGF1 is a novel antidepressant candidate.
FGF21 activity requires its binding to a receptor complex that
consists of FGFR1 and the coreceptor b-Klotho (Min et al.,
2018). Previous studies have demonstrated that FGF21/FGFR1
signaling plays a major role in increasing basal glucose uptake
(Hsu et al., 2019), inducing macrophages through the Ox-LDLFIGURE 7 | Exogenous rhFGF21 supplement suppressed pro-inflammation cytokines expression by activating FGFR1 through inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-kB, and

induced inflammatory response (Wang N. et al., 2018),
attenuating neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra of rats after
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Zheng
et al., 2019), and protecting the blood-brain barrier by increasing
tight junction and adhesion junction proteins after traumatic
brain injury (Chen J. et al., 2018). In the current study, to further
investigate the functions of rhFGF21 in suppressing the NF-kB
pathway to inhibit microglial activation and proinflammatory
cytokine expression mediated through FGFR1 activation, the
FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 and rhFGF21 were used to treat
primary microglia stimulated with LPS. rhFGF21 activated
FGFR1, which suppressed proinflammatory cytokine expression
and reduced the ratio of p-NF-kB/NF-kB expression stimulated by
LPS in primary microglia. In contrast, PD173074 blocked these
inhibitory effects of rhFGF21, indicating that rhFGF21 suppresses
the NF-kB pathway to inhibit microglial activation and
proinflammatory cytokine expression mediated through FGFR1
activation. Proinflammatory cytokines can reduce the expression of
BDNF, and neurotrophic factors are critical in the pathogenesis of
depression and brain neuroplasticity (Lee and Kim, 2010). Several
reports demonstrated that LPS administration induced
inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced BDNF and other
neurotrophin expression, which could cause cognitive dysfunction.
BDNF levels are much higher in the hippocampus than in other
brain structures due to the great biological importance of the
hippocampus in memory maintenance and its involvement with
emotions. In addition, our study demonstrated that rhFGF21 could
prevent LPS-induced BDNF downregulation by increasing BDNF
expression in the mouse hippocampus and in primary microglia,
which was reversed by its combination treatment with PD173074.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that rhFGF21
treatment improves LPS-induced depression-like behaviors and
decreases proinflammatory cytokine expression. In addition, the
current study demonstrates that rhFGF21 can act as an
antidepressant upon hippocampal microglial stimulation
through inhibiting activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway
by activating FGFR1. Accordingly, the present study indicates that
rhFGF21 could be a potent candidate drug for antidepressant
therapy. However, the underlying mechanism by which rhFGF21
