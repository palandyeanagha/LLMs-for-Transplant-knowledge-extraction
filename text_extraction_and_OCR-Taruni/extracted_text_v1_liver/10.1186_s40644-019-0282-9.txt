Abstract
Background: Accurate and early diagnosis of residual tumors or intrahepatic recurrences after TACE is critically
needed for determining the success of treatments and for guiding subsequent therapeutic planning. This metaanalysis was performed to assess the efficacy of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with the quantitative apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in diagnosing residual or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE).
Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and the
Cochrane Library database, from inception to July 2019, was conducted to select original studies on diagnosing
residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE using DWI sequence with its ADC value. Two researchers independently
chose study, extracted data, conducted meta-analysis, and evaluated methodological quality according to Quality
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.
Results: Twelve studies comprising 624 patients and 712 tumors were finally included. The pooled sensitivity,
specificity and AUC value of DWI in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE were 85% (95%CI: 74–92%),
83% (95%CI: 75–88%) and 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87–0.92), respectively. Residual or recurrent HCCs have significantly lower
ADC value than necrotic tumors (MD = -0.48, 95%CI: − 0.69~ − 0.27, P < 0.01).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that DWI performed better in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after
TACE, and ADC value may serve as alternatives for further evaluation of residual or recurrent leisions in HCC
patients after TACE.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant tumors, with serious threats to human life and
health, and it is estimated to be the fourth major factor
of cancer death in the worldwide population [1]. However, only approximately 20% of patients with HCC are
suitable for surgical resection or liver transplantation,
mainly because the tumors are often diagnosed at an
intermediate to advanced stage, and the associated liver
cirrhosis is too far developed to permit tumor resection
or liver transplantation to be endured [2, 3].
As a first-line and curative therapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) operates by injecting chemotherapeutic drugs at the HCC site while impeding blood
supply to the tumor. In previous studies, TACE has been
proven to be an efficient bridge therapy for patients
waiting for liver transplantation and can improve survival prognosis in patients with inoperable HCC [4, 5].
However, the rate of recurrent HCC after TACE is relatively high, with reported 12-month recurrence rates of
78% [6]. Therefore, the accurate and early diagnosis of
residual tumors or intrahepatic recurrences after TACE
is critically needed for determining the success of treatments and for guiding subsequent therapeutic planning.
By detecting water diffusion indirectly, diffusion
weighted imaging (DWI) provides information regarding
tissue cellularity and cell membrane integrity, and its
quantitative value of the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) is highly associated with tumor cellularity [7, 8],
indicating that DWI and ADC values may be potentially
used to diagnose and differentiate residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE. Moreover, DWI and ADC values are
of great importance in guiding the post-TACE treatment
of patients with HCC. However, the accuracy of DWI
and the quantitative ADC value for diagnosing residual
or recurrent HCCs has shown conflicting results in an
increasingly large number of clinical trials, mainly
because different diagnostic accuracies associated with
DWI and ADC values have been reported [9–20]. Therefore, based on the currently available published articles
on DWI and the ADC value in detecting residual or
recurrent HCCs after TACE, this meta-analysis was performed to provide evidence-based conclusions for
imaging diagnostics.
Materials and methods
Literature search
According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [21], a
comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Embase, Web
of Science, Scopus and the Cochrane library database was
performed to select original studies, from inception to July
2019, that evaluated the accuracy of DWI and the quantitative ADC value in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE. Medical subject heading words and free words
were used conjunctly and were as follows: (1) “Diffusion
weighted imaging” or “DWI”; and (2) “transarterial chemoembolization” or “transcatheter arterial chemoembolization” or “TACE”. In addition, a manual search was
performed of the identified review articles and included the
study references to acquire available studies and to
minimize the potential publication bias.
Selection of articles
Inclusion criteria
(1) DWI and the calculated ADC values were used as
diagnostic indices for detecting residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE. (2) Pathology and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or follow-up clinical results
served as the reference standard [22]. (3) The two-bytwo table, including the true-positive (TP), false-positive
(FP), false-negative (FN) and true-negative (TN) values,
could be extracted or calculated. (4) More than 10
patients were included in the study. (5) When the data
were published repeatedly, the latest study with detailed
information was included. (6) The study was published
in English.
Exclusion criteria
(1) Surgical resection and any other therapies besides
TACE were applied to treat HCC. (2) The two-by-two
table of DWI alone could not be acquired when DWI
was used in conjunction with other MRI images; these
studies were also excluded. (3) Review articles, case reports, animal studies, and editorial comments were excluded. (4) Conferences abstracts were also excluded, as
their conclusions might not be up to date.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two researchers (ZL and HFL) independently extracted
the study data and evaluated the methodological quality
using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool [23], and any disagreements
were solved through discussion until consensus was
reached. A predefined Excel file was adopted to extract
study data, including first author name, publication year,
country, study design type (prospective or retrospective),
baseline information of involved patients (number, mean
age, gender, the number of lesions), time interval between TACE and DWI examination, blinding method
application, reference standard, DWI protocol (field
strength, b value, ADC cut-off value), and threshold
method used (visual diagnosis or ADC measurement).
Additionally, two-by-two table values were extracted
from all included studies. The quality was assessed via
the evaluation of risk bias in four domains (patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing)
and clinical applicability in three domains (patient
Liu et al. Cancer Imaging (2020) 20:3 Page 2 of 10

selection, index test and reference standard) of the study
characteristics. Each domain was scored as high, low, or
unclear.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
Data synthesis and statistical analysis were performed
using STATA (version 12.0, StataCorp, USA) and Review
Manager software (version 5.3, the Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). To present the study characteristics of DWI
in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE
suitably, data synthesis was performed by the METANDI
module and hierarchical logistic regression modeling in
STATA software. The Spearman correlation coefficient
was calculated to test the threshold, and a P-value less
than 0.05 indicated the threshold effect. A chi-squared test
was performed to measure the heterogeneity degree of the
enrolled studies, and the degree was considered low for Isquared (I
2
) = 25 to 49%, moderate for I
2 = 50 to 74%, and
high for I
2 > 75%.
The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive
likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio
(NLR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
computed from the two-by-two table data. Then, the
receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and area
under the ROC curve (AUC) were computed to evaluate
the value of DWI in diagnosing residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE, and the value was considered good
for AUC values > 0.9 and medium for AUC values from
0.7 to 0.9. Moreover, the ADC values of the residual or
recurrent HCC group and the necrotic lesion group
were compared and pooled as the mean difference (MD)
with a random-effects model to incorporate expected
heterogeneity. Additionally, possible factors, including
study design type (retrospective or prospective), b value
(< 800 or ≥ 800) and threshold method (visual analysis or
ADC measurement), that may lead to heterogeneity were
analyzed through subgroup analysis. Moreover, the reliability and stability of this study were evaluated through
sensitivity analysis. Last, Deeks’ funnel plot with the linear regression of log odds ratios on the inverse root of
effective sample sizes was performed to test for publication bias: a P-value < 0.05 was representative of publication bias.
Result
Study selection and description
Figure 1 demonstrates a detailed flowchart of the study
selection process. The electronic search combined with
the manual search initially yielded 2210 potential literature references, and this number was reduced to 1356
after removing 854 duplicated references by Endnote X7
software. Upon reading the titles and abstracts, only 97
references were retrieved for further inspection. After
full text review, a total of 12 studies [9–20], comprising
624 patients and 712 tumors evaluated by DWI, were
finally included. The baseline information extracted from
each study is presented in Table 1.

Assessment of study quality
The methodological assessment results of the included
studies are shown in Table 2. The risk of bias for patient
selection was primarily related to case-control studies.
Case-control studies were defined as studies involving
both patients prediagnosed with and patients without residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE before undergoing
DWI examination. In this meta-analysis, none of the included studies had a case-control design, leading to a
low risk of bias in patient selection for all included studies. For this meta-analysis, only four studies showed a
clear blinding application method [12, 16, 18, 20], which
results in an unclear risk of bias concerning the index
test in the other eight studies. Pathology, DSA and clinical follow-up results are all reliable reference standards
in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE;
therefore, all studies included in this meta-analysis presented a low risk of bias compared with the reference
standard.
Statistical analysis
Heterogeneity test
The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.141 (P =
0.662 > 0.05), indicating that there was no obvious threshold effect of DWI in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE. The chi-squared value of the pooled SEN was
27.47 (P = 0.02 < 0.05), and the I
2 value was 49.03%, demonstrating low heterogeneity for SEN. SPE had a chi-squared
value of 56.58 (P < 0.01), and the I
2 value was 75.38%, representing high heterogeneity.
Pooled analysis
The pooled weighted values of DWI in diagnosing
residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE were as follows: SEN =85% (95% CI: 74–92%), SPE =83% (95%
CI: 75–88%), PLR =5.12 (95% CI: 3.27–7.38), NLR =
0.18 (95% CI: 0.09–0.34), and AUC =0.90 (95% CI:
0.87–0.92). Forest plots and ROC curves for the 12
studies are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4.
Comparison of ADC values
Among the included studies, 8 studies compared the
ADC value between residual or recurrent HCCs and
necrotic tumors. Our pooled analysis demonstrated that
residual or recurrent HCCs had significantly lower ADC
values than necrotic tumors (MD = -0.48, 95% CI: −
0.69~ − 0.27, P < 0.01), which is shown in Fig. 5, indicating that the ADC value may be important for differentiating residual and recurrent HCCs after TACE.

Subgroup analysis
As presented in Table 3, the study design type, b value
and threshold method used did not significantly affect
the ability of DWI to diagnose residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE.
Analysis of sensitivity and publication bias
For the use of DWI in the detection of residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE, the reliability and stability of this
meta-analysis were assessed by removing one study with
unclear field strength and the use of the b value. The
resulting SEN was 87% (95% CI 78–93%), SPE was 83%
(95% CI 74–89%) and AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–
0.93), indicating that the effect values were still within
the 95% CI of the original results, thus showing that the
results were reliable and stable. Deeks’ funnel plot is presented in Fig. 6 and demonstrates no obvious publication bias of DWI in the diagnosis of residual or
recurrent HCCs after TACE (P = 0.206).
Discussion
Because of the potential severe complications and relatively high cost, pathology and digital subtraction angiography are not recommended as routine follow-up
examinations for diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE [24]. However, residual or recurrent HCCs

increase the disease burden and worsen the survival
prognosis of patients after TACE [25]; thus, noninvasive
imaging is increasingly being used to diagnose residual
or recurrent HCCs after TACE. Contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CECT) is commonly used in
analyzing the distribution of lipiodol deposition and is
beneficial for evaluating the therapeutic effects of TACE
[26]. However, lipiodol deposition often makes it hard to
diagnose the residual tumor on CECT because the accumulation of intratumoral lipiodol may mask its enhancement, which would significantly decrease the accuracy
and contribute to a lower sensitivity of 72% (95% CI:
67–76%) [27] compared with this study conclusion that
DWI had a higher sensitivity of 85% (95% CI: 74–92%)
in detecting residual or recurrent HCCs. Contrastenhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) is a valuable imaging
method for evaluating vascularity because the depiction
of tumor vascularity is not affected by lipiodol accumulation. A recent meta-analysis reported that CEUS can
reach up to a weighted SEN of 97% (95% CI: 95–99%) in
the diagnosis of residual or recurrent HCC after TACE
[27]. Nevertheless, CEUS examination has always been
conducted on a solitary mass or on a dominant mass in
patients with multiple tumors, which limits its wide clinical application in detecting residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE [28].
After the TACE procedure, the HCC tumor cells
undergo necrosis and apoptosis, with increased cell
membrane permeability and enlarged cell gaps, leading
to more water molecule movement on DWI and an
increased ADC value. For residual or recurrent HCCs,
the tortuosity of the extracellular space and the higher
density of hydrophobic cellular membranes will increase
cell density and restrict the apparent diffusion of water
protons, thus presenting a high signal on DWI and a
lower ADC value [7, 29]; therefore, DWI was increasingly used in the follow-up of TACE treatment. To
provide a diagnostic value and to investigate the possible factors that affect the efficacy of conducting
DWI, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate
the value of DWI in diagnosing residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE.
In this study, 12 studies comprising 624 patients and
712 tumors detected on DWI were included. The SEN,
SPE, and AUC values of DWI in diagnosing residual or
recurrent HCCs after TACE were 85% (95% CI: 74–

92%), 83% (95% CI: 75–88%), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–
0.92), respectively, indicating a high value of DWI in
diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE.
Additionally, the PLR for DWI was 5.12 (95% CI: 3.27–
7.38), revealing moderate accuracy in diagnosing residual
or recurrent HCCs after TACE. The NLR value for DWI
was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.09–0.34), and a negative DWI result
may be used as a moderate justification to rule out residual or recurrent HCCs after TACE. Moreover, this
pooled analysis also indicated that the ADC value of
necrotic tumors was significantly higher than that of residual or recurrent HCCs, confirming previous findings
and revealing that the ADC value can be used as an efficient imaging method to differentiate the properties of
lesions after TACE.
In this meta-analysis, the opposite results of falsenegative (1-SEN) and false-positive (1-SPE) rates were
15 and 17%, respectively, for DWI in diagnosing residual
or recurrent HCCs after TACE, and some of the following possible factors could contribute to the relatively
high number of false-negative and false-positive results.
1) Adjacent hepatic inflammation could restrict water
diffusion, resulting in sustained hyperintensity on DWI,
thereby producing a false-positive DWI diagnosis of the
lesion after TACE [30, 31]. 2) Intralesional hemorrhage
or liquefactive necrosis can occur after TACE, which
may also contribute to diffusion restriction in necrotic
tumors, and can decrease the accuracy of DWI in the
detection of residual or recurrent HCCs [32]. 3) Owing
to the limited spatial resolution of DWI, small tumors
would not be diagnosed precisely, leading to falsenegative and false-positive results on DWI [33]. 4) The
signal intensities observed on DWI are easily affected by
the T2-relaxation time of the tissue, as seen in the fact
that a false-positive diagnosis of necrotic tissue may be
induced by well-differentiated HCCs, high-grade dysplastic nodules, and hemangioma [34]. Only histopathology can be regarded as the absolute gold standard for
diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs [22]. DSA or
follow-up results may contribute to false-positive results.
Significant sources of heterogeneity concerning the
use of DWI in the diagnosis of residual or recurrent
HCCs after TACE and the evaluation of this metaanalysis demonstrated 4 potential factors that may
account for this result: 1) Freiman et al. [35] reported
that a higher b value might decrease the signal-to-noise

ratio (SNR), whereas blood perfusion can be easily
affected by a lower b value. Vandecaveye et al. [36] suggested that the SNR is the highest and the image quality
of DWI is the best at a specific b value of 600 s/mm2
.
This meta-analysis demonstrated that DWI performed
better for the diagnosis of residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE with lower b values than with higher b
values, revealing that the b value of DWI was one of the
factors affecting diagnostic efficacy. 2) Heterogeneity
might be induced by the different threshold methods
used. There is a trend towards a higher diagnostic value
of ADC measurement compared to visual diagnosis. Visual diagnosis is easily affected by the T2 shine-through
effect and may account for this result [37]. 3) There are
5 retrospective studies and 7 prospective studies included in this study, which may be another reason for
the heterogeneity. Prospective studies tended to perform
better, although these findings were not statistically significant. 4) Heterogeneity might also be induced by the
various field strengths adopted in the different studies
[38], because a higher resolution of images will be created with higher field DWI-MRI scanners. However, we
were not able to perform subgroup analysis associated
with field strength owing to the limited included studies.
There were some deficiencies in this study that should be
noted. First, although a combination of electronic and manual searches was performed, only 12 studies comprising
624 patients on DWI were involved. The small number of
included studies might have a negative impact on the diagnostic accuracy; therefore, further high-quality studies on a
larger scale may be required. Second, the exclusion of studies other than those published in English, review articles
and conference abstracts may contribute to potential publication bias. Third, field strength was found to affect the efficacy of DWI in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs
after TACE. However, because of the limitations of the included studies, the accuracy of DWI in diagnosing residual
or recurrent HCCs after TACE from the perspective of field
strength was not been explored.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study suggested that DWI performs
well in diagnosing residual or recurrent HCCs after
TACE, and the ADC value may serve as an alternative
marker in the further evaluation of HCC patients after
TACE.
