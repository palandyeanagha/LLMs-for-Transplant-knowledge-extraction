Abstract
Background: Hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MTDPS) is a disease caused by defects in
mitochondrial DNA maintenance and leads to liver failure and neurological complications during infancy. Liver
transplantation (LT) remains controversial due to poor outcomes associated with extrahepatic symptoms. The
purposes of this study were to clarify the current clinical and molecular features of hepatocerebral MTDPS and to
evaluate the outcomes of LT in MTDPS patients in Japan.
Results: We retrospectively assessed the clinical and genetic findings, as well as the clinical courses, of 23 hepatocerebral
MTDPS patients from a pool of 999 patients who were diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases between 2007 and 2019.
Causative genes were identified in 18 of 23 patients: MPV17 (n = 13), DGUOK (n = 3), POLG (n = 1), and MICOS13 (n = 1). Eight
MPV17-deficient patients harbored c.451dupC and all three DGUOK-deficient patients harbored c.143-307_170del335. The
most common initial manifestation was failure to thrive (n = 13, 56.5%). The most frequent liver symptom was cholestasis
(n = 21, 91.3%). LT was performed on 12 patients, including nine MPV17-deficient and two DGUOK-deficient patients. Among
the 12 transplanted patients, five, including one with mild intellectual disability, survived; while seven who had remarkable
neurological symptoms before LT died. Five of the MPV17-deficient survivors had either c.149G > A or c.293C > T.
Conclusions: MPV17 was the most common genetic cause of hepatocerebral MTDPS. The outcome of LT for MTDPS was
not favorable, as previously reported, however, patients harboring MPV17 mutations associated with mild phenotypes such
as c.149G > A or c.293C > T, and exhibiting no marked neurologic manifestations before LT, had a better prognosis after LT.

Background
Mitochondrial diseases are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders that affect multiple organs, are characterized by impaired energy production, and can present
at any age. Neurological symptoms are the most common
clinical presentation and liver involvement is observed in
approximately 10–20% of cases, particularly in patients
that present as neonates or during early infancy [1].
Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MTDPS) is
caused by defects in any of the proteins involved in
mtDNA maintenance, leading to quantitative and qualitative defects in mtDNA, and currently has been classified as mtDNA maintenance defects [2, 3]. MTDPS has
three clinical phenotypes; myopathic, encephalomyopathic, and hepatocerebral. Hepatocerebral MTDPS is
known to cause acute liver failure in infancy and is associated with mutations in DGUOK, MPV17, POLG,
SUCLG1, and TWNK [4].
Liver transplantation (LT) is considered as a definitive
treatment option for pediatric patients with liver failure,
and the survival rate for pediatric LT recipients in Japan
is more than 85% at 5 years [5]. Contrarily, previous
studies have reported that the overall survival rate of LT
performed for mitochondrial hepatopathies was only
30% due to post-LT deterioration of neurologic and extrahepatic symptoms [6]. LT for mitochondrial diseases
may be considered in patients with isolated liver disease,
however, it is difficult to exclude the development or deterioration of extrahepatic manifestation before LT in a
clinical setting.
In 2013, we reported the clinical and molecular characteristics of MTDPS in Japan [7], identifying 13 patients
with hepatocerebral MTDPS. Among those patients, mutations in DGUOK were the most frequently observed
followed by MPV17 and POLG. Since that earlier report,
we have diagnosed ten additional patients with hepatocerebral MTDPS and have performed LT on patients with
mitochondrial hepatopathies [8–10]. The purposes of this
study were to clarify the current clinical and molecular
features of hepatocerebral MTDPS and to evaluate the
outcomes of LT in MTDPS patients in Japan.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of patients who
were diagnosed with hepatocerebral MTDPS from 2007
to 2019. Patients were enzymatically and/or genetically
diagnosed and diagnosis of MTDPS was confirmed by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This
study was approved by the ethics boards of Chiba Children’s Hospital and Saitama Medical University.
Patients
We have used biochemical and molecular genetic testing
to diagnose mitochondrial diseases in Japan since 2007.
A total of 999 patients were diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases, 101 (10.1%) of which were mitochondrial
hepatopathies. Among these, 23 patients were diagnosed
with hepatocerebral MTDPS.
Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity
We examined mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme
activity using liver samples as previously described [11].
Enzymatic diagnosis was confirmed according to the
diagnostic criteria described by Bernier et al. [12]
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Nuclear DNA and mtDNA were enumerated by qPCR,
according to the previously described methods [7, 13].
The mtDNA gene ND1 was compared against a nuclear
reference gene, exon 24 of CFTR. A relative copy number of mtDNA to nuclear DNA of < 35% was defined as
mtDNA depletion.
Results
Clinical characteristics
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the patients.
The cohort comprised 23 patients (11 male and 12 female) with hepatocerebral MTDPS from 19 nonconsanguineous families; 15 of the patients have been reported earlier [3, 7, 8, 10]. Twenty patients (87%) presented with initial manifestations during infancy, and six
of those developed initial symptoms during the neonatal
period. The most common initial manifestation was failure to thrive, seen in 13 patients (56.5%), followed by
vomiting (8/23 patients), and jaundice (4/23 patients).
Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes were analyzed
in 22 of the patients, and multiple enzyme deficiencies
in liver tissues were noted in 19. All affected patients
tested for mtDNA content showed significant mtDNA
depletion, ranging from 0.5 to 31.7%. Causative genes
were identified in 18 of the 23 hepatocerebral MTDPS
patients. Liver manifestations are shown in Table 2. The
most frequently observed liver symptom was cholestasis
(21/23 patients, 91.3%); meanwhile hepatomegaly, fatty
liver, liver fibrosis, and liver failure were observed in 15
(68.2%), 16 (72.7%), 17 (77.2%), and 20 patients (87.0%),
respectively. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) developed in two patients with MPV17 deficiency, and the level of α-fetoprotein was highly variable,
ranging from 24.9 to 503,320 ng/mL.
Table 3 shows the breakdown of extrahepatic manifestations. Failure to thrive (18/21) was the most common
extrahepatic involvement. Vomiting (10/22) and feeding
difficulties (11/23), which developed during the neonatal
period, were also frequent symptoms. Hypoglycemia and
lactic acidosis were found in 15 and 16 patients, respectively. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was observed in 5/
22 patients (MPV17, four patients [Pt936, Pt1244,
Shimura et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:169 Page 2 of 9

Pt1273, and Pt1943]; DGUOK, one patient [Pt66]).
Hypothermia was also observed in one patient with
DGUOK deficiency.
Molecular investigations
We identified causative genes in 18 of the 23 patients,
including mutations in MPV17 (13 patients), DGUOK (3
patients), POLG (one patient) and MICOS13 (one patient). The variants that are predicted to be pathogenic
are presented in Table 4. Homozygous or compound
heterozygous c.451dupC (p.L151Pfs*39) with other mutations were detected in 8 of 13 MPV17 deficient patients. The c.143-307_170del335 mutation was found in
all three patients with DGUOK deficiency. Pt94 had a
novel homozygous frameshift mutation, c.13_29del
(p.W6Pfs*71) in MICOS13.
Liver transplantation and prognosis
LT from a living donor was performed on 12 patients,
including nine with MPV17 deficiency and two with
DGUOK deficiency (Table 4). The reasons for performing LT were as follows: two patients (Pt68YB and
Pt2017ES) had HCC, two patients (Pt2017EB and
Pt2017YS) had multiple hepatic masses and end-stage
liver disease, and the remainder of the patients had
liver failure. Neurological manifestations were also observed before LT in nine patients other than Pt1702,
Pt2017YS, and Pt2017ES. Furthermore, five of the 12
LT patients (41.7%) survived, four of which were
MPV17-deficient patients (Pt1702, Pt2017EB,
Pt2017YS, and Pt2017ES). Three of the four patients
who presented with onset after 6 months of age (75%)
survived, whereas only two of the eight patients with
onset before 5 months (25%) survived. Moreover,
Pt2017YS and Pt2017ES with MPV17 deficiency did
not develop any complications following LT, whereas
Pt2017EB, who had mild intellectual disability before
LT, presented with mild headache after LT. Lastly,
Pt1702 who received LT due to liver failure at the age
of 8 months had normal liver function after LT, however, developed epilepsy, mild intellectual disability,
dysarthria, fine motor dysfunction, white matter lesion
in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and
psychosis after 6 years of age.

Following LT, three MPV17-deficient patients (Pt936,
Pt1244, and Pt1273) and one DGUOK-deficient patient
(Pt66) developed PH, as did one MPV17-deficient patient (Pt1943) that did not undergo LT. All five patients
suffering from PH showed poor prognosis. The causes of
death after LT were respiratory failure due to sepsis in
Pt936, PH in Pt1244 and heart failure in Pt1273. Tissue
vulnerability following LT caused a ruptured suture in
Pt68EB, who developed peritonitis and sepsis. Pt68YB
died of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome
caused by pneumonia after LT.
Two of the 11 patients (Pt339 and Pt1589) who did
not receive LT survived. Pt 339 with MPV17 deficiency
survived for 11 years after the onset of MTDPS. She presented with failure to thrive since infancy, and developed
liver failure accompanied by acute encephalopathy at the
age of 2 years. The liver failure was ameliorated by medical management, however, her liver disease gradually
progressed to cirrhosis causing esophageal varices, which
were treated by endoscopic variceal ligation. She ultimately developed certain neurological manifestations:
spastic gait, intellectual disability, and seizure. At the
time of writing this report, she had spastic paralysis associated with white matter lesion, and required the use
of a wheelchair.
Among eight MPV17-deficient patients who harbored
a frameshift mutation (c.451dupC) in at least one allele,
only one patient (Pt1702) survived. All of the patients
with MPV17 mutations who survived had either
c.149G > A, or c.293C > T in at least one allele. Pt339
and Pt1702, both with c.293C > T, developed neurological symptoms, including seizures, intellectual disability, and psychiatric symptoms, while sibling patients
with c.149G > A did not exhibit neurological manifestations, other than mild intellectual disability and headaches for Pt2017EB.
Discussion
Mutations in MPV17 were the most common genetic
cause of MTDPS in the patient cohort involved in this
study, followed by mutations in DGUOK. The prevalence of these mutations in MTDPS patients observed in
our study differs from that of other studies. For example,
a previous study reported that POLG mutations,

followed by MPV17 and DGUOK mutations, were the
most common in European countries [14]. Meanwhile,
another showed that MPV17 and DGUOK were the
most, and second most, frequent genetic causes of
MTDPS, respectively [15], although all parents of the patients in that study were consanguineous.
Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous
c.13_29del in MICOS13, in Pt94. This novel mutation
caused reduced levels of MICOS13 mRNA and protein
in the patient’s fibroblasts and was confirmed by a rescue assay using a lentivirus system. Although MICOS13
has not been reported to be directly involved in mitochondrial DNA replication, several reports support this
relationship. For example, IMMT (also known as MIC60
or Mitofilin) has a critical role in MICOS assembly and
mitochondrial DNA organization [16]. IMMT directly
contacts mtDNA and is involved in the D-loop
architecture. Other studies showed that a defect in
CHCHD10, which is also related to MICOS complex
function, resulted in decreased MICOS complex
organization, reduced copy number and caused instability of mtDNA [17, 18].
The frameshift mutation c.451dupC was seen in 8 of
13 patients (61.5%) in our cohort with MPV17 deficiency. A homozygous c.451dupC mutation was also
identified in Korean sibling patients who died from liver
failure at the age of 6 months [19], however, has not reported elsewhere. Japanese patients with the homozygous c.451dupC also developed liver failure requiring LT
during infancy and died within 2 years of LT. It is, therefore, conceivable that the c.451dupC mutation might be
more frequent in East Asian populations, and homozygosity at this locus is likely associated with poor outcomes regardless of whether LT is performed. In

contrast, two patients with c.293C > T and sibling patients with c.149G > A, in which homozygosity is associated with a comparatively better prognosis, survived
regardless of LT [3, 20]. Taken together, patients harboring c.149G > A or c.293C > T in at least one MPV17 allele of might show milder phenotypes.
LT in patients with mitochondrial diseases remains
controversial due to the potential for extrahepatic manifestations. In guidelines for pediatric patients, LT for patients with mitochondrial diseases involving severe and
life-threatening extrahepatic multi organ manifestations
is contraindicated due to the high possibility of neurological deterioration [21]. In such patients, limited data
are available regarding the efficacy of LT and long-term
prognosis, and outcomes are known to be heterogenous
[1, 22–24]. It has been reported that five of 14 patients
with DGUOK mutations survived for more than 5 years
after LT without severe neurological symptoms, even
though some patients presented with muscle hypotonia
and psychomotor retardation before transplantation
[22]. In that study, all survivors harbored at least one
mutation that predicted a DGUOK protein with some
potential residual activity. Moreover, in our cohort, overall survival rate following LT for MTDPS was 41.7%,
which was lower than that for other diseases (> 85%) [5].
We also found that survival rate of LT patients with onset after 6 months of age (75%) was higher than that of
onset before 5 months (25%). LT may, therefore, be
more effective in patients with later onset.
Table 5 summarizes 20 patients with MPV17 mutations who received LT [20, 25–31], including nine patients from our cohort. Nine of these 20 patients (45.0%)
survived after LT. Patients with the homozygous
c.149G > A, or compound heterozygous c.149G > A or
c.293C > T, with other mutations tended to show a better prognosis after LT. Eight of the 11 deceased patients
(72.7%) presented with neurological involvements before
LT. Mild neurological symptoms were observed before
LT in just one of the nine patients that survived, however, seven patients (77.8%) manifested with neurological
abnormalities after LT. Collectively, patients harboring
c.149G > A or c.293C > T in at least one allele without
marked neurological manifestations might have a better
prognosis after LT.

A previous study found that three out of 14 patients
with DGUOK mutations developed PH after LT [22]. In
the current study, PH was observed in five patients including four with MPV17 deficiency and one with
DGUOK deficiency. Four of these developed PH after LT.
Although PH can be caused by chronic liver disease and
portal hypertension, PH after LT is infrequent; PH has
also been reported in patients with primary mitochondrial
diseases (e.g. m.3243A > G, NFU1, BOLA3) [32, 33], however, the mechanism underlying this remains unknown.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the survival rate for MTDPS patients after
LT in our cohort was lower than that for other diseases,
however, LT was relatively effective in patients with later
onset. Our results also suggest that a better life
prognosis after LT might be expected in MTDPS patients who have MPV17 mutations, such as c.149G > A
or c.293C > T, that are associated with milder phenotypes and do not have marked neurological manifestations before LT.
