Patient-Derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Alpha-1 
Antitrypsin Deficiency Disease Modeling and Therapeutic 
Discovery
Joseph E. Kaserman, MD1 Andrew A. Wilson MD1
PIZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal recessive disease affecting approximately 
100,000 individuals in the United States and one of the most common hereditary causes of liver disease (Chest. 
2002;122[5]:1818-1829). The most common form of the disease results from a single base pair mutation 
(Glu342Lys), known as the “Z” mutation, that encodes a mutant protein (Z alpha-1 antritypsin [AAT]) that is 
prone to misfolding and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than appropriately secreted. Some 
of the retained mutant protein attains an unusual aggregated or polymerized conformation. Retained polymeric 
ZAAT aggregates are hepatotoxic and lead to downstream liver disease in a subset of PiZZ neonates and 
adults through a gain-of-function mechanism. PiZZ individuals are likewise highly predisposed to developing 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema as a result of low circulating levels of AAT protein 
and associated protease-antiprotease imbalance. Much of our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis 
of AATD is based on studies employing either transgenic mice that express the mutant human Z allele or 
immortalized cell lines transduced to overexpress ZAAT. While they have been quite informative, these models 
fail to capture the patient-to-patient variability in disease phenotype that clinicians observe in their AATD 
patients, raising the question of whether alternative models might provide new insight. Induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), first described in 2006, have the capacity to differentiate into a broad array of cell types 
from all 3 germ layers, including hepatocytes. Disease-specific iPSCs have been derived from patients with 
a variety of monogenic disorders and have been found to faithfully recapitulate features of such diseases as 
spinal muscular atrophy, familial dysautonomia, Rett syndrome, polycythemia vera, type 1A glycogen storage 
disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, long QT syndrome, and others. This discussion reviews the potential 
applications of iPSCs for understanding AATD-associated liver disease as well as for development of potential 
therapeutic strategies.

Directed Differentiation of Induced 
Pluripotent Stem Cells to the 
Hepatic Lineage 
The ability to isolate and culture human pluripotent 
stem cells, first with embryonic stem cells in 
the late 1990s and subsequently with induced 
pluripotent stem cells, has provided researchers 
with a tool to derive human hepatic cells in vitro 
via directed differentiation, an approach in which 
cells are sequentially exposed to developmental 
stage-appropriate signals to guide differentiation. 
The efficiency of directed differentiation protocols 
has substantially improved over time through the 
application of knowledge derived from developmental 
biology.1 For example, culture of undifferentiated 
pluripotent stem cells in the presence of TGF beta 
superfamily member and nodal analogue, Activin A, 
exposes cells to signals they would encounter in the 
anterior primitive streak of a gastrulating embryo thus 
inducing their differentiation to definitive endoderm, 
the germ layer from which hepatocytes as well as 
lung, thyroid, intestine, and pancreas are derived.2
The hepatic lineage is then specified via exposure of 
definitive endodermal cells to high levels of fibroblast 
growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein, 
resulting in the emergence of hepatoblasts that coexpress alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin and serve 
as precursors for hepatocytes and biliary epithelial 
cells.3,4 Further exposure in culture to hepatocyte 
growth factor, dexamethasone, and oncostatin M 
then promotes hepatocyte maturation.5,6 As has 
been the case with other directed differentiation 
protocols, recent evidence has suggested that culture 
in 3-dimensional conditions likewise promotes the 
maturation of hepatocytes, resulting in increased 
expression of genes associated with liver function 
and a subset of cytochrome p450 genes together 
with increased expression of the asialo-glycoprotein 
protein receptor 1, a cell surface marker expressed 
by mature hepatocytes.6
Despite these advances, hepatic differentiation 
protocols have not been successful in reproducibly 
achieving levels of maturation comparable to adult 
primary hepatocytes, a challenge that has been 
broadly observed in pluripotent stem cell (PSC)- 
directed differentiation protocols.7 Limitations in 
hepatic differentiation protocols are illustrated both 
by the continued expression of immature markers, 
such as AFP, together with limited induction of Phase 
1 and Phase 2 enzymes vital for drug metabolism. 
In addition, differences in the primary cells chosen 
for comparison has made it difficult to compare 
published protocols from different labs, resulting in 
uncertainty in their relative efficacy. The significance 
of these shortcomings with respect to the application 
of patient iPSC-hepatic cells to disease modeling, 
drug screens, or cell-based therapies is unclear but 
may vary based on the developmental stage at which 
hepatocytes acquire specific biological functions.

Careful work over a period of decades has resulted in 
a body of work describing the cellular and systemic 
consequences of protein misfolding arising from the 
pathogenic Z mutation. Our understanding of these 
consequences is outlined in the paragraphs that follow.
Polymerization and Accumulation of Misfolded 
Protein
Work performed in the early 1990s demonstrated 
that misfolded ZAAT molecules can polymerize 
within the ER via a mechanism referred to as loopsheet polymerization7 wherein the reactive center 
loop of one ZAAT monomer can insert into the 
A-sheet of an adjacent monomer resulting in noncovalent binding. The misfolding of proteins and their 
predisposition to polymerization result in a variety 
of downstream consequences that together form the 
basis for the clinical disease.8 Polymerized ZAAT 
accumulates within hepatocytes of PiZZ patients and 
is poorly secreted. Retained ZAAT polymers form large 
inclusions, referred to as globules that occur within the 
ER of subsets of hepatocytes in affected individuals.7
These globules, likewise found in the PiZ transgenic 
mouse model of ZAAT-liver disease, stain positive

Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated 
Liver Disease

with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and are resistant to 
digestion with diastase, a pattern that differentiates 
them from other protein aggregates. ZAAT inclusions 
perturb the ER architecture and are physically 
segregated into compartments separate from the rest 
of the ER network that can nonetheless communicate 
with other inclusions and with the ER network itself.9
For reasons that are poorly understood, globules are 
not homogenously distributed and are found in only 
a subset of PiZZ patient hepatocytes.10 Studies in 
PiZ mice have demonstrated that hepatocytes lacking 
globules exhibit a proliferative advantage that varies 
with the relative number of globule-containing cells, 
leading to speculation that signaling between globulecontaining and globule-devoid cells contributes to 
liver disease pathogenesis.10,11
Aberrant Protein Glycosylation and Secretion
Newly synthesized AAT protein is secreted into the 
rough ER where it is post-translationally modified prior 
to secretion. Steps in this process include cleavage 
of its signal peptide together with glycosylation 
at 3 distinct asparagine residues (numbers 46, 83, 
and 247) as the protein takes on a 3-dimensional 
conformation.12 Following additional trimming 
of glucose units to produce a monoglycosylated 
oligosaccharide,13-16 mature AAT glycoproteins 
are released from the protein folding machinery and 
transported to the Golgi where terminal modification 
of the carbohydrate side chains occurs prior to 
secretion.12 While post-translational modifications 
and secretion of normally folded M protein occur very 
rapidly, glycosylation is altered and the overall kinetics 
of both glycosylation and secretion is significantly 
slowed for ZAAT protein.17-20 These processes have 
biological consequences as aberrant glycosylation has 
been associated with the proinflammatory properties 
of Z protein17 while delayed secretion is associated 
with the injurious intracellular accumulation of ZAAT 
polymers.
Autophagic Flux
Misfolded ZAAT not secreted or removed by ERassociated degradation (ERAD) accumulates in the ER 
and forms insoluble polymers that cannot be degraded 
proteasomally. ZAAT polymers, like other aggregated 
proteins, are degraded via an alternative degradation 
mechanism known as autophagy. Autophagy, 
commonly used to refer to the more specific term 
macroautophagy, is a homeostatic process of 
intracellular degradation in which subcellular 
structures are enveloped and degrade in doublemembraned vacuoles known as autophagosomes.21
Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes resulting in 
the degradation of their contents that can then be 
repurposed by the cell. Autophagy is best quantified 
through measurement of pathway activity in the cell 
that can be estimated via the relationship between 
autophagosome production and clearance, together 
known as autophagic flux.
22 While flux is challenging 
to measure in human liver specimens, the formation of 
autophagic vacuoles is significantly increased in liver 
samples of PiZZ individuals, consistent with increased 
pathway activity. Autophagic activity quantified by flux 
has been documented in multiple cell-based models, 
including patient iPSC-hepatic cells, as well as in the 
PiZ mouse model of AATD liver disease.5,23-27
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response
Expression of ZAAT protein in cell models is associated 
with activation of signaling pathways believed to 
be related to liver disease pathogenesis. One such 
pathway is the ER overload response (EOR) that been 
described in multiple ZAAT expression systems and 
that is characterized by induction of the transcription 
factor NF-κB.18,28 However, NF-κB activation is 
non-specific and can also indicate activation of a 
distinct signaling pathway known as the unfolded 
protein response (UPR). The UPR, activated in cells 
in response to cellular stresses such as accumulated 
misfolded proteins, involves global down-regulation 
of translation with associated up-regulation of 
genes that increase the ER protein folding capacity 
or degradative capacity via the ERAD pathway.29
Discordant findings have characterized the literature 
regarding the presence or absence of UPR activation 
in the setting of AATD, with activation not observed 
in primary mouse liver cells or immortalized human 
or mouse cells18 but found to occur in primary human 
peripheral blood monocytes.28 The reason for this 
discordance is uncertain but could be consistent with 
context specificity that varies with species, cell type, or 
developmental stage.

Polymerization and Accumulation of Misfolded 
Protein
Work by our lab and others has demonstrated that 
AATD patient-derived iPSC-hepatic cells faithfully 
recapitulate features of a variety of metabolic liver 
diseases, including most of the known features of 
ZAAT-associated hepatocellular toxicity, as outlined 
in Figure 1. SERPINA1 is expressed in differentiating 
iPSCs upon reaching the hepatic progenitor stage with 
levels of expression increasing as cells mature further.5
In differentiating iPSCs derived from PiZZ patients 
homozygous for the Z allele, ZAAT protein accumulates 
intracellularly and forms polymers consistent with 
observations in the PiZZ human and PiZ mouse 
livers.5,30 Aggregated ZAAT likewise accumulates to

form globular inclusions in PiZZ patient iPSC-hepatic 
cells that are localized predominantly within the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum.31 PiZZ patient iPSChepatic cell globules stain positive with PAS and are 
resistant to digestion with diastase as is the case in 
other model systems.32 In a limited number of iPSC 
lines derived from patients with severe liver disease, 
globular inclusions were identified in approximately 
25% of iPSC-hepatic cells, a percentage greater than 
commonly observed in patient biopsy samples but 
consistent with their emergence in only a minority of 
hepatic cells even within diseased individuals.31
Aberrant Protein Glycosylation and Secretion
The kinetics of post-translational modifications of 
AAT protein can be quantified via the classical pulsechase radiolabeling assay, in which nascent peptides 
are labeled with radioactive amino acids prior to 
immunoprecipitation and separation based on size.33
Glycosylated AAT protein is approximately 3kDa 
larger than the newly synthesized peptide, allowing 
for discrimination between glycosylated and nonglycosylated species. The delay in this process known 
to occur in ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes and the 
associated delay in ZAAT secretion has likewise been 
observed in PiZZ patient iPSC-hepatic cells by 2 groups 
of investigators.5,31 Evidence from these groups 
likewise demonstrates that the observed alterations 
in AAT processing and secretion are resolved with 
correction of the single base pair Z mutation in patient 
cells and that patient-to-patient differences in disease 
phenotype appear to be recapitulated in this model. 
Together, these findings underscore the potential 
utility of patient iPSCs as predictive and therapeutic 
tools for the AATD patient population. Further studies 
are needed to determine whether iPSC-derived cells 
recapitulate differences in fucosylation described 
in ZAAT relative to MAAT protein in patient blood 
samples.17
Autophagic Flux
As discussed above, ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes 
are unable to degrade polymeric ZAAT via the 
proteosomal degradation pathway but can do so 
at least in part via the autophagy pathway. The 
potential significance of this pathway for therapeutic 
manipulation was demonstrated in PiZ mice by 
Perlmutter and colleagues via the demonstration 
that the anti-seizure medication Carbamazepine, a 
member of a class of drugs that induce the autophagy 
pathway, reduced the number of hepatic PAS positive, 
diastase-resistant globules and likewise diminished 
hepatic fibrosis, a clinically significant downstream 
consequence of ZAAT proteotoxicity.34 Similar to 
observations made previously in mouse models and 
human cells, our group has found that autophagic 
flux is increased in PiZZ patient iPSC-hepatic cells 
relative to those differentiated from wild-type (WT)
controls.5 Furthermore, this enhanced flux was further 
augmented in PiZZ but not WT iPSC-hepatic cells 
treated with carbamazepine and was associated with 
a reduction in intracellular AAT but not other hepatic 
proteins, such as AFP. These findings are in accord 
with other published data demonstrating reduced AAT 
immunofluorescent staining in iPSC-hepatic cells 
treated with carbamazepine.32
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response
Accumulated ZAAT protein activates signaling 
pathways that have been overlapping but distinct in 
various models used to study AATD. To understand 
the downstream transcriptomic consequences of 
ZAAT production, we performed microarrays on 
PiZZ patient-derived iPSCs compared to WT iPSCs 
and embryonic stem cells during hepatic-directed 
differentiation.5 We found that there were no 
statistically significant differences in gene expression 
among the groups until reaching the hepatic stage 
of differentiation when AAT protein is expressed. 
To identify a transcriptomic signature of disease, we 
evaluated gene expression differences that emerged 
with differentiation between WT and PiZZ iPSCs and 
found a set of genes differentially expressed between 
these 2 groups upon reaching the hepatic stage. The 
second most differentially expressed gene on this list 
was caspase-4, the ER stress-specific caspase believed 
to be a homolog of caspase-12 in mice.35 We did 
not detect markers of UPR activation in our diseasespecific signature, consistent with other models of 
hepatic ZAAT-associated signaling.18 Earlier stage 
liver progenitor cells evaluated by qPCR and western 
blot, however, did demonstrate up-regulation of ATF4
and sXBP-1 mRNA and increased sXBP-1 and Grp78/BiP protein together with reduced IκBα protein, all 
consistent with UPR activation at this stage. Together, 
these results suggest that ZAAT expression activates 
the UPR in a stage/context-specific manner, consistent 
with the variability demonstrated in other models.

literature has suggested additional mechanisms 
through which ZAAT proteotoxicity may perturb 
hepatocellular function and thereby lead to clinical 
disease. For instance, regional heterogeneity of 
hepatocellular phenotype, referred to as zonation,
36,37
has been found to be perturbed in liver tissue of PiZ 
mice and PiZZ patients and is associated with a defect 
in ureagenesis.38 The significance of these findings for 
patients has yet to be elucidated and represents an area 
where iPSCs could provide validation and potentially 
further our understanding of a potentially significant 
disease mechanism.
Ira Fox and colleagues demonstrated differences in 
the secretion kinetics of ZAAT that varied between 
PiZZ individuals with and without known liver 
disease.31 This work was in accord with studies from 
this group 2 decades earlier featuring primary skin 
fibroblasts that together suggest the presence of 
genetic cofactors that influence the kinetics of ZAAT 
secretion and may thereby confer risk of developing 
liver disease.20 If confirmed, these findings suggest the 
possibility that patient iPSCs could be used to predict 
an individual’s future risk of developing liver disease, 
an exciting proposition since there is currently no way 
to know which PiZZ patients are likely to develop this 
complication. The prospect that patient-derived iPSCs 
serve as genetic surrogates for patients themselves 
likewise supports potential cell-based in vitro clinical 
trials that could serve as an adjunct to traditional 
clinical studies. To be successful, “clinical trials in a 
dish” would require curated pools of iPSCs harboring 
genetic diversity representative of the applicable 
patient population.39 Whether differences in the 
drug responsiveness of iPSC-derived cell types such 
as hepatocytes predict the response of an individual 
patient’s hepatocytes in vivo is an important question 
that will require head-to-head testing of cell types, 
likely in the context of a clinical trial.
Similarly, published work has suggested that PiZZ 
iPSC-hepatic cells exhibit broad sensitivity to toxicity 
from commonly-used medications.5 This finding 
is in keeping with work demonstrating that ZAAT 
polymer expression renders cells more sensitive to 
UPR activation in response to a “second hit”, such 
as treatment with tunicamycin or in response to low 
glucose.40 While the mechanistic underpinnings of 
this drug-induced toxicity in cells that did not express 
adult levels of CYP450 enzymes were not defined, 
the findings suggest the possibility that iPSCs could 
represent a platform to predict individualized risk of 
drug toxicity, when combined with protocols capable 
of achieving this level of maturation.
Along these same lines, recent literature has 
demonstrated the applicability of patient iPSCs 
as a platform for drug screening.41 While other, 
immortalized, cell lines could similarly serve this 
purpose, the genetic and phenotypic diversity that 
patient iPSCs potentially represent could make them 
well suited as a primary or confirmatory tool for this 
application.
Finally, the only curative treatment for AATD has long 
been organ transplantation, a procedure with limited 
availability and considerable morbidity that carries 
with it the life-long burden of immunosuppression. 
Seminal work from Japan has demonstrated the 
transplantation of patient iPSC-derived differentiated 
cells to restore function to damaged tissue.42 Potential 
roadblocks to widespread use of this approach remain 
to be surmounted, including potential off-target effects 
of genome editing to correct disease-causing mutations 
and the potential risk associated with inadvertent 
transplantation of pluripotent cells.39 However, recent 
studies demonstrating a proliferative advantage for 
gene-corrected MAAT hepatocytes over diseased 
ZAAT hepatocytes suggest that transplantation of 
cells edited to correct the Z mutation may have utility 
for AATD and could represent a cure for the disease 
that to this point has remained elusive.43
