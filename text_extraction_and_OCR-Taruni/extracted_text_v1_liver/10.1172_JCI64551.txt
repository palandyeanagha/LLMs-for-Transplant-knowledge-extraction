Patients with cholestatic disease exhibit pruritus and analgesia, but the mechanisms underlying these symptoms are unknown. We report that bile acids, which are elevated in the circulation and tissues during cholestasis, cause itch and analgesia by activating the GPCR TGR5. TGR5 was detected in peptidergic neurons 
of mouse dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord that transmit itch and pain, and in dermal macrophages that 
contain opioids. Bile acids and a TGR5-selective agonist induced hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglia neurons and stimulated the release of the itch and analgesia transmitters gastrin-releasing peptide and leucineenkephalin. Intradermal injection of bile acids and a TGR5-selective agonist stimulated scratching behavior by 
gastrin-releasing peptide– and opioid-dependent mechanisms in mice. Scratching was attenuated in Tgr5-KO 
mice but exacerbated in Tgr5-Tg mice (overexpressing mouse TGR5), which exhibited spontaneous pruritus. 
Intraplantar and intrathecal injection of bile acids caused analgesia to mechanical stimulation of the paw by 
an opioid-dependent mechanism. Both peripheral and central mechanisms of analgesia were absent from 
Tgr5-KO mice. Thus, bile acids activate TGR5 on sensory nerves, stimulating the release of neuropeptides in 
the spinal cord that transmit itch and analgesia. These mechanisms could contribute to pruritus and painless 
jaundice that occur during cholestatic liver diseases.
Introduction
Patients with cholestatic liver diseases, characterized by diminished 
delivery of bile into the intestine, can experience severe and intractable pruritus that is an indication for liver transplantation (1, 2). 
Cholestatic patients can also exhibit altered pain perception. Jaundice in the absence of abdominal pain (“painless jaundice”) suggests gradual malignant obstruction of the biliary tract, whereas 
painful jaundice (cholangitis) is associated with an acute obstruction with gallstones, as recognized by Courvoisier a century ago 
(3). Patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for cholestatic diseases report lower postoperative pain scores and require 
less morphine analgesia than patients undergoing liver resection, 
despite the more extensive transplantation procedure (4). Mice with 
bile duct ligation to induce cholestatic disease also demonstrate 
analgesia to mechanical stimulation of the paw (5). However, the 
mechanisms of cholestatic itch and painless jaundice are unknown.
The distinct sensations of itch and pain are evoked by different stimuli that elicit the discrete responses of scratching and 
withdrawal (6). Itch and pain are antagonistic: painful stimuli 
(scratching) relieve itch (7), and analgesics (intrathecal morphine) 
can cause itch (8). However, itch and pain are related because they 
both protect against irritating and damaging stimuli, and they 
share a similar mechanism of transmission: pruritogens and algesic substances are sensed in the skin by primary spinal afferent 
neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which transmit information to the brain via second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of 
the spinal cord (6). Whether itch and pain are transmitted by the 
same or different neurons is uncertain. The labeled line hypothesis proposes that there are distinct populations of neurons that 
transmit either itch or pain. The existence of an itch-specific pathway was supported by the identification of histamine-selective 
C fibers in human skin (9), and by the report that gastrin-releasing 
peptide (GRP) is an itch-selective transmitter of DRG neurons (10) 
that activates the GRP receptor (GRPR) on spinal neurons, which 
transmit itch but not pain (11). A heterodimer of the GRPR and a 
μ-opioid receptor (MOR) variant, MOR1D, in spinal neurons may 
mediate opioid-induced itch (12). However, sensory nerves in the 
skin are selective but not specific for histamine, since they also 
respond to nociceptive stimuli such as capsaicin (13), an agonist 
of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1), 
and DRG nociceptors expressing TRPV1 are necessary for scratching behavior (14). Mice lacking vesicular glutamate transporter 2 
in subsets of DRG neurons exhibit attenuated pain but enhanced 
itch (15, 16), which implicates this transporter in both sensations. 
These findings support the selectivity theory of itch, which proposes that primary spinal afferent neurons can sense both pruritogens and algesic substances and that inactivation of central pain 
signaling is a prerequisite for itch transmission (6, 17).
Peripheral and central mechanisms may explain the itch and 
analgesia that can accompany liver disease. Bile acids (BAs) are 
potential mediators, since cholestatic patients have increased BA 
concentrations in the circulation (18) and skin (19), and application of BAs to the skin causes itch (20, 21), whereas bile salt–binding resins relieve cholestatic pruritus (22). Alterations in opioids

and their receptors may also contribute. There are increased circulating levels of opioids in humans (23) and rats (24) with cholestatic disease, and fewer MOR binding sites in the brain of cholestatic 
rats (25). The opioid antagonist naloxone can alleviate cholestatic 
pruritus (26) and reverses the analgesia observed in mice with 
cholestasis (5). However, the mechanisms by which sensory nerves 
detect and respond to BAs are unknown, and the neuronal mediators of BA-induced itch and analgesia have not yet been identified.
In addition to their role in the digestion and absorption of 
dietary fats, BAs are signaling molecules that regulate multiple 
cell types by activating nuclear and plasma membrane receptors 
(27). We report a major role for TGR5 (also known as GPR131 or 
GpBAR1), a G protein–coupled plasma membrane receptor for 
BAs (28, 29), in BA-induced itch and analgesia. TGR5 is a widely 
distributed receptor that has been implicated in energy metabolism (30), glucose homeostasis (31, 32), bile composition/secretion 
(33–36), and inflammation (28, 37, 38). TGR5 is also expressed by 
neurons of the enteric and central nervous systems, where it may 
mediate the effects of BAs on intestinal motility (39) and detect 
endogenous neurosteroids (40, 41). The existence of TGR5 in the 
nervous system led us to hypothesize that TGR5 on sensory nerves 
mediates BA-induced itch and analgesia.
Results
TGR5 is expressed by peptidergic neurons of the DRG. In order to determine whether TGR5 is expressed by DRG neurons involved in 
itch and pain, small-diameter neurons (<25 μm) from mouse 
(C57BL/6) DRG (all regions) were individually selected, and 
expression of Tgr5 mRNA was examined by single-cell nested 
PCR. Neurons were further characterized by similarly examining the expression of mRNA for the itch transmitter Grp (10, 42) 
and for the Trpa1 and Trpv1 ion channels that participate in itch 
and pain transmission (14, 43, 44). Transcripts corresponding in 
size to Tgr5 (236 bp) were amplified from 36% of small-diameter 
DRG neurons (78 neurons from 7 mice; Figure 1, A and B). Of all 
of the small-diameter neurons, 50% expressed Grp (206 bp), 59% 
expressed Trpa1 (393 bp), and 77% expressed Trpv1 (229 bp) (Figure 1B). Of the Tgr5-expressing neurons, 39% coexpressed Grp, 41% 
coexpressed Trpa1, and 32% coexpressed Trpv1. Tgr5, Grp, Trpa1, 
and Trpv1 were all coexpressed by 22% of small-diameter neurons. 
The identity of all transcripts was confirmed by sequencing, and 
no products were amplified from the neuronal culture medium or 
when RT was omitted.
Using an antibody raised in rabbit to the carboxyl terminus 
of human TGR5 (39), we found TGR5 to be localized to DRG 
neurons (thoracic, lumbar, and sacral). The neuronal subtypes 
expressing TGR5 were characterized by simultaneous localization 
of TGR5 with the pan-neuronal marker Hu (human antibody), 
and with neuropeptide transmitters of itch (GRP, goat antibody) 
and neurogenic inflammation and pain (calcitonin gene–related 
peptide [CGRP], sheep antibody, and substance P [SP], rat antibody). Nonpeptidergic neurons were identified by examining 
binding of isolectin B4 (IB4) conjugated to FITC. TGR5 immunoreactivity (TGR5-IR) was prominently localized to small-diameter 
neurons, with a cross-sectional area of 150–250 μm2 (Figure 1, C 
and D). Of the Hu-IR neurons, 28% coexpressed TGR5-IR (259 
TGR5-IR of 931 Hu-IR neurons from 5 mice). All of the TGR5-
IR cells coexpressed Hu-IR (259 of 259 neurons, 100%), and were 
thus confirmed to be neurons. The TGR5-IR neurons were mostly 
peptidergic (Figure 1C). Of all of the TGR5-IR neurons, 38% coexpressed CGRP (133 of 248) and 48% coexpressed SP (188 of 393). 
Of the CGRP-IR neurons, 63% coexpressed TGR5-IR (123 of 194), 
and of the SP-IR neurons, 66% coexpressed TGR5-IR (188 of 286). 
GRP-IR also colocalized with TGR5-IR in small-diameter DRG 
neurons (Figure 1C). However, there was considerable variability 
in the intensity of the GRP-IR between neurons, which precluded 
quantification of the extent of GRP-IR and TGR5-IR colocalization. TGR5 was not prominently colocalized with nonpeptidergic 
neurons that bound IB4-FITC (Figure 1C). Of the TGR5-IR neurons, only 8% bound IB4-FITC (15 of 193), and of the neurons that 
bound IB4-FITC, only 9% expressed TGR5-IR (15 of 176). TGR5-
IR was also present in peptidergic neurons that coexpressed SP or 
CGRP in rat DRG (data not shown).
The TGR5 antibody specifically interacts with human TGR5 
expressed in HEK293 cells (39). In order to further characterize 
specificity in mice, we compared DRG sections from Tgr5-WT and 
Tgr5-KO mice. The TGR5 antibody strongly stained small-diameter neurons of Tgr5-WT mice (Figure 1E). In contrast, the staining 
of small-diameter neurons of Tgr5-KO mice was markedly diminished, although the background fluorescence of larger-diameter 
neurons was retained (Figure 1E). Expression of Hu-IR, SP-IR, 
CGRP-IR, and GRP-IR was the same in Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO 
mice (Figure 1E and data not shown). Preadsorption of the TGR5 
antibody with the receptor fragment that was used for immunization abolished the TGR5-IR signal in DRG neurons from Tgr5-WT 
and C57BL/6 mice (Figure 1E). Staining was also absent when the 
TGR5 antibody was replaced with normal rabbit IgG or was omitted (Figure 1E and data not shown). These results indicate that the 
TGR5 antibody specifically detects TGR5 in mouse DRG neurons.
As a control for the specific detection of GRP in DRG neurons,

in enteric nerves that control gastrin secretion, were incubated 
with the GRP antibody used for neurochemical coding (goat) 
and a well-characterized antibody that was raised in rabbits (45). 
Both antibodies stained the same DRG neurons, and both stained 
neurons of the myenteric plexus and mucosal nerve fibers of the 
gastric antrum (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI64551DS1). The 
goat GRP antibody clearly stained myenteric neurons and fibers 
in a whole-mount preparation of the gastric antrum. These results 
indicate that Tgr5 mRNA and TGR5-IR are expressed by smalldiameter peptidergic neurons containing CGRP, SP, and GRP that 
also express TRPA1 and TRPV1.
TGR5 is expressed by spinal neurons and dermal macrophages. The 
expression of TGR5 and GRP was examined in whole spinal cord 
(all regions) of C57BL/6 mice by RT-PCR. Transcripts corresponding to Tgr5 (236 bp) and Grp (206 bp) mRNA were amplified from 
the spinal cord, and Tgr5 mRNA was also amplified from the gall 
bladder, an established site of TGR5 expression that was used as a 
positive control (Figure 2A). Segments of spinal cord (sacral and 
lumbar) of C57BL/6 mice were stained to detect TGR5-IR, Hu-IR,

abolished staining. (C) In mouse skin, TGR5-IR localized to dermal macrophages (arrows), which were identified based on appearance and

and markers of peptidergic (CGRP-IR, SP-IR, GRP-IR) and nonpeptidergic (IB4-FITC binding) neurons. TGR5-IR was detected in 
a subpopulations of Hu-IR neurons of laminae I, II, and V of the 
dorsal horn, and lamina X in the region of the central canal (Figure 
2B). TGR5-IR was prominently localized in neuronal cell bodies, 
whereas CGRP-IR, SP-IR, GRP-IR, and IB4-FITC were detected in 
nerve fibers in the dorsal horn. In order to examine the localization 
of TGR5 in peripheral tissues, sections of mouse skin were studied. 
TGR5-IR was detected in dermal macrophages, which were identified by histological appearance (Figure 2C). Preadsorption of the 
TGR5 antibody with the immunizing peptide abolished staining 
in the spinal cord and the skin (Figure 2, B and C), confirming 
specific detection of TGR5. These results indicate that TGR5 is 
expressed by a subpopulation of spinal neurons and by dermal 
macrophages that are known to contain opioids (46). Attempts 
to simultaneously localize TGR5 and opioids were unsuccessful 
due to the inadequacy of the available opioid antibodies raised in 
species appropriate for simultaneous localization.
BAs and a TGR5-selective agonist increase the intrinsic excitability of 
DRG neurons by a TGR5-dependent mechanism. In order to determine 
whether BAs can directly regulate the excitability of primary spinal afferent neurons, patch-clamp recordings were made from 
acutely dissociated mouse DRG neurons. Recordings were made 
from small-diameter neurons (<30 pF capacitance), because these 
neurons possess the properties of nociceptors (e.g., sensitivity 
to capsaicin; ref. 47). The intrinsic excitability of neurons was 
assessed by measurement of the rheobase (minimal input current 
required to generate 1 action potential [AP]) and the AP discharge 
frequency at a current twice that of rheobase (2× rheobase). Input 
currents were applied for 500 ms. Recordings were made from 
neurons before (basal control) and after incubation with BAs or 
a TGR5-selective agonist (all 10, 30, or 100 μM, 10 minutes) or 
vehicle control (1% DMSO, 0.9% NaCl).
Incubation of DRG neurons from Tgr5-WT mice with deoxycholic acid (DCA; 100 μM, 10 minutes), which activates TGR5 (28, 
29), caused a 28% decrease in rheobase (control, 108.6 ± 16.0 pA; 
DCA, 77.9 ± 9.8 pA; P = 0.002) and a 63% increase in AP discharge 
frequency at 2× rheobase (control, 1.6 ± 0.3 APs during 500-ms 
input current; DCA, 2.6 ± 0.5 APs; P = 0.015) (Figure 3, A and B). 
In marked contrast, DCA did not affect rheobase or AP discharge 
frequency of neurons from Tgr5-KO mice (Figure 3B). DCA had 
no effect on the resting membrane potential or the input resisFigure 3

normalized to control values to account for variability in control responses between experiments. DCA decreased rheobase and increased AP 
discharge frequency at 2× rheobase in neurons from Tgr5-WT mice, but had no effect on neurons from Tgr5-KO mice. (C) Summary data showing 
that DCA did not affect resting membrane potential or input resistance of neurons from Tgr5-WT mice. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.005 vs. control; paired

tance of neurons from Tgr5-WT mice (Figure 3C). Vehicle control 
treatment did not affect rheobase, AP discharge frequency, resting 
membrane potential, or input resistance (data not shown). Thus, 
DCA increased the intrinsic excitability of DRG neurons in a 
TGR5-dependent manner, but did not directly depolarize neurons.
To further characterize the effects of BAs on neuronal excitability, DRG neurons from C57BL/6 mice were incubated with graded 
concentrations of BAs that are known to activate TGR5, including DCA and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) (28, 29). Although 
the highest concentration of DCA (100 μM, 10 minutes) reduced 
rheobase and increased AP discharge frequency at 2× rheobase, 
lower concentrations of DCA (10 or 30 μM) had no effect (Figure 4A). TLCA (10 or 100 μM, 10 minutes) reduced rheobase 
but did not affect AP discharge frequency (Figure 4B). Oleanolic 
acid (OA) is a naturally occurring component of leaves from the 
olive tree Olea europaea that potently activates TGR5, but not the 
nuclear farnesoid X BA receptor (48). OA (10, 30, or 100 μM, 10 
minutes) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in rheobase 
and increase in AP discharge frequency (Figure 4C). The highest 
concentration of OA (100 μM) decreased rheobase to 40.0% ± 9.9% 
of control and increased AP discharge frequency to 218.2% ± 46% 
of control. Further evidence in support of increased excitability 
was the observation that 36% of neurons treated with 100 μM OA 
exhibited spontaneous AP discharge and anodal break excitation 
compared with control (4 of 11, P = 0.024), an effect not seen with 
DCA or TLCA (Figure 4D). This increased excitability of OA-treated neurons was associated with an increase in the input resistance 
(basal, 1,078 ± 224 mΩ; OA, 1,625 ± 230 mΩ; P = 0.045), suggesting closure of K+ channels. In contrast, DCA and TLCA did not 
affect the input resistance or the resting membrane potential (Figure 3C and data not shown). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has 
been reported either to not activate TGR5 or to have weak agonisFigure 4

account for variability in control responses between experiments. DCA (100 μM) decreased rheobase and increased AP discharge frequency, 
whereas TLCA (10 and 100 μM) only decreased rheobase. OA caused a robust and concentration-dependent decrease in rheobase and increase 
in AP discharge frequency. UDCA had no effect on rheobase or AP discharge frequency. (D) Representative recording of the membrane potential

tic activity, while retaining the detergent and irritant properties 
of BAs (28, 49). UDCA (30 or 100 μM, 10 minutes) did not affect 
rheobase, AP discharge frequency, resting membrane potential, 
or input resistance (Figure 4E and data not shown). These results 
demonstrated that BAs known to potently activate TGR5 (DCA 
and TLCA) and a TGR5-selective agonist (OA) directly regulated 
the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter DRG neurons that participate in itch and pain transmission.

attached dorsal roots (combined cervical, thoracic, and lumbar-sacral regions) under basal conditions and after superfusion with DCA, TLCA, 
OA, or UDCA (10, 100, and/or 500 μM, 60 minutes superfusion). DCA, TLCA, and OA stimulated GRP-IR, Leu-ENK–IR, and CGRP-IR release 
over basal. UDCA stimulated GRP-IR release only at the highest concentration (500 μM). Removal of extracellular calcium (–Ca2+) prevented 
DCA-, TLCA- and OA-stimulated release. Preincubation with capsaicin (+Cap) did not affect DCA-, TLCA-, or OA-evoked GRP-IR or Leu-ENK–IR 
release, but prevented CGRP-IR release. (D) Capsaicin did not stimulate GRP-IR release, but strongly stimulated CGRP-IR release. *P < 0.05

BAs and a TGR5-selective agonist stimulate release of neuropeptide 
transmitters of itch and analgesia. GRP is an itch-selective transmitter (10, 11), and leucine-enkephalin (Leu-ENK) induces both 
itch and analgesia (5, 26). GRP has been detected in DRG and 
spinal cord (10, 42, 50), and Leu-ENK is present in the spinal 
cord (51). To assess whether TGR5 regulates release of these 
neuropeptides, segments of spinal cord with attached dorsal 
roots were superfused with BAs and a TGR5-selective agonist 
(10, 100, or 500 μM, 60 minutes superfusion), and neuropeptide release was measured by ELISA. It was necessary to study 
neuropeptide release from rats rather than mice, since only rats 
provided sufficient tissue for detection of the low concentrations of secreted neuropeptides.
DCA and TLCA stimulated concentration-dependent release 
of GRP-IR and Leu-ENK–IR (Figure 5, A and B). The maximal 
responses were to DCA (500 μM), which caused a 3-fold increase 
over basal in GRP-IR release (1.33 ± 0.05 vs. 0.45 ± 0.09 pmol/g; 
P = 0.001), and TLCA (500 μM), which caused a 7-fold increase over 
basal in Leu-ENK–IR release (21.60 ± 6.24 vs. 3.08 ± 0.43 pmol/g; 
P = 0.042). However, lower concentrations (100 μM) of both BAs 
also significantly stimulated release of GRP-IR and Leu-ENK–
IR. DCA and TLCA did not release GRP-IR and Leu-ENK–IR in 
the absence of extracellular calcium (Figure 5, A and B). OA also 
stimulated calcium-dependent release of GRP-IR and Leu-ENK–
IR (Figure 5, A and B). UDCA did not stimulate GRP-IR release, 
except at high concentrations (500 μM) (Figure 5A).

Although it does not cause pruritus in human skin (52), CGRP 
is a mediator of neurogenic inflammation that colocalizes with 
GRP in DRG neurons (10). DCA, TLCA, and OA, but not UDCA, 
stimulated calcium-dependent release of CGRP-IR from the spinal 
cord and DRG (Figure 5C).
The neuropeptides released from segments of spinal cord with 
attached dorsal roots may derive from spinal neurons or from the 
central projections of DRG neurons within the dorsal horn. To 
determine whether BAs stimulate neuropeptide release from DRG 
neurons that express TRPV1, tissues were preincubated with capsaicin (10 μM, 20 minutes). This treatment can deplete neuropeptides such as CGRP from primary spinal afferent neurons expressing TRPV1. Preincubation with capsaicin did not affect DCA-, 
TLCA- or OA-evoked release of GRP-IR or Leu-ENK–IR (Figure 5, 
A and B). In marked contrast, capsaicin preincubation prevented 
DCA-, TLCA-, and OA-evoked release of CGRP-IR (Figure 5C). In 
keeping with these results, capsaicin (0.1 μM) did not affect GRPIR release, but strongly stimulated CGRP-IR release (Figure 5D). 
These findings indicate that BAs known to activate TGR5 and 
a TGR5-selective agonist can stimulate release of neuropeptides 
from the spinal cord and DRG of rats. GRP-IR and Leu-ENK–IR 
probably derived from spinal neurons, since preincubation with 
capsaicin did not affect BA-evoked release of these neuropeptides, 
and direct stimulation with capsaicin had no effect on GRP-IR 
release. In contrast, CGRP-IR derived from TRPV1-expressing 
primary spinal afferent neurons, since capsaicin preincubation 
prevented BA-evoked CGRP-IR release, and capsaicin directly 
stimulated CGRP release.
BAs activate TGR5 and induce GRP- and opioid-mediated itch. To determine whether BAs induce itch by a TGR5-dependent mechanism, 
scratching behavior was examined in Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO mice as 
well as in Tgr5-Tg mice (overexpressing mouse TGR5). Test agents 
were injected intradermally into the nape of the neck, and scratching events (movement of hind limb to injection site) were recorded.
Without injection, Tgr5-WT mice exhibited a low frequency of 
spontaneous scratching (14.2 ± 3.8 events/60 minutes; Figure 6, B 
and J). This frequency increased 3.4-fold in Tgr5-Tg mice (47.3 ± 1.6 
events/60 minutes; P = 0.037, Tgr5-Tg vs. Tgr5-WT), which was 7-fold 
higher than in Tgr5-KO mice (6.6 ± 1.6 events/60 minutes; P = 0.021, 
Tgr5-Tg vs. Tgr5-KO). Scratching events measured within 60 minutes 
of vehicle (0.9% NaCl) injection similarly increased 3.5-fold in Tgr5-
Tg and Tgr5-WT mice (P = 0.011; Figure 6, C and J).
In Tgr5-WT mice, intradermal injection of DCA (25 μg) strongly 
stimulated scratching within 30 minutes (DCA, 97.2 ± 13.3 
events/30 minutes; control, 4.5 ± 2.1 events/30 minutes), which 
declined to baseline within 90–120 minutes (Figure 6, D and J). 
Compared with Tgr5-WT controls, DCA-induced scratching was 
diminished in Tgr5-KO mice (45.4 ± 13.4 events/30 minutes; 
P = 0.001), but amplified in Tgr5-Tg mice (132.6 ± 9.7 events/30 
minutes; P = 0.001; Figure 6D). The effects of DCA were dose

The GRPR antagonist [Tyr4, D-Phe12]-bombesin or

scratching at all time points compared with vehicle.

related, with threshold response to 5 μg and maximal response 
to 25 μg (Figure 6E). Higher DCA doses caused severe scratching 
that damaged the skin, and were not further studied. Although 
TLCA and OA (25 μg) robustly stimulated scratching in Tgr5-WT 
mice, responses were markedly diminished in Tgr5-KO mice (Figure 6, F and G). Of all the tested BAs, OA stimulated the largest 
scratching response in Tgr5-WT mice (192.6 ± 15 events/30 minutes). UDCA (25 μg) had a small effect on scratching in Tgr5-WT

into the plantar surface of the hind paw. Responses to stimulation of the plantar surface of the paw with von Frey filaments of graded stiffness and 
paw thickness were recorded. Results are expressed as percent basal value. An increased von Frey response indicates that a stiffer filament was 
required to induce withdrawal (mechanical analgesia), whereas a decreased response indicates that a less stiff filament was required to induce 
withdrawal (mechanical hyperalgesia). (A) Intraplantar injection of DCA (12.5–125 μg) or capsaicin (5 μg) increased paw thickness in Tgr5-WT

mice that was similar in Tgr5-KO and Tgr5-Tg mice (Figure 6H). 
The established pruritogen histamine (50 μg) caused an equivalent 
degree of scratching in Tgr5-WT, Tgr5-KO, and Tgr5-Tg mice (Figure 6I). Figure 6J summarizes the scratching responses measured 
within 60 minutes of intradermal injection of vehicle (0.9% NaCl), 
DCA, TLCA, OA, UDCA, or histamine to Tgr5-WT, Tgr5-KO, and 
Tgr5-Tg mice. These data confirmed that TGR5 overexpression 
induced spontaneous scratching and that DCA, TLCA, and OA 
caused scratching that was highly dependent on TGR5 expression.
Deletion of GRPR or intrathecal administration of a GRPR 
antagonist suppresses scratching to diverse pruritogens (10). 
Compared with vehicle control, intrathecal injection of the GRPR 
antagonist [Tyr4, D-Phe12]-bombesin (53) caused an approximately 
60% reduction in DCA-induced scratching in Tgr5-WT mice 
(102.0 ± 37.5 vs. 249.0 ± 89.6 events/60 minutes; P = 0.001; Figure 
7A). These results indicate a major role for centrally released GRP 
in BA-evoked scratching.
Morphine, a MOR agonist, is a pruritogen, which implicates opioids as mediators of itch (12, 54). Systemic administration of the 
MOR antagonist naloxone, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, 
blunted the scratching response to DCA administered to Tgr5-WT 
mice 30 minutes after treatment (Figure 7B). A second challenge 
with DCA — administered 180 minutes after the first DCA injection, when naloxone was cleared — stimulated a 3.4-fold increase 
in scratching compared with the initial challenge (117.6 ± 20.0 vs. 
34.9 ± 9.0 events/60 minutes; P = 0.002). Thus, opioids contributed to the pruritogenic actions of BAs.
Mediators such as histamine and tryptase that are released 
from mast cells when they degranulate are powerful stimulants of 
itching. To determine whether mast cells could contribute to BAinduced scratching, Trg5-WT mice were treated with the mast cell 
stabilizer and histamine H1 receptor antagonist ketotifen or vehicle 
control (0.9% NaCl) prior to administration of DCA. DCA (25 μg) 
stimulated a similar degree of scratching in mice treated with ketotifen or vehicle (Figure 7C), which suggests that mast cells and histamine do not contribute to DCA-stimulated scratching.
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been identified in the serum of 
cholestatic patients as a potential pruritogen; when administered 
to mice, LPA induces scratching (55, 56). To assess whether TGR5 
could contribute to LPA-evoked itch, scratching was examined in 
Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO mice. Intradermal injection of LPA (100 μg) 
stimulated a similar degree of scratching in Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO 
mice (Figure 7D). To determine whether LPA can activate TGR5, 
HEK293 cells expressing human TGR5 were incubated with LPA 
or DCA. cAMP formation was measured as an index of receptor 
activation, since TGR5 couples to Gαs (28, 29). DCA stimulated 
cAMP generation in HEK293 cells with an EC50 of 99.6 ± 13.3 μM; 
in contrast, LPA up to 500 μM did not affect cAMP levels (Figure 
7E). Thus, TGR5 did not mediate the pruritogenic effects of LPA, 
and LPA did not directly activate TGR5.
To determine whether BAs can act centrally to cause itch, DCA 
(25 μg, 5 μl) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 5 μl) was injected intrathecally 
to Tgr5-WT mice, and scratching behavior was recorded. There was 
no difference in the frequency of scratching events between DCAand vehicle-treated mice within 30 minutes of injection (vehicle, 
3.8 ± 0.5 events/30 minutes; DCA, 4.8 ± 1.0 events/30 minutes; 
n = 4). Thus, DCA stimulated scratching when administered 
peripherally, but not centrally. These results indicated that BAs and

a TGR5-selective agonist robustly stimulated scratching behavior 
in mice by activating TGR5 in the periphery. We therefore conclude 
that TGR5-induced pruritus is mediated by central action of GRP 
and also requires opioids, but is independent of mast cells.
BAs activate TGR5 and cause opioid-mediated mechanical analgesia. Bile 
duct resection in mice, which mimics cholestatic disease, induces 
an analgesia to mechanical stimulation of the paw by an opioiddependent mechanism (5). To evaluate whether exogenous BAs 
can mimic the effects of bile duct ligation and cause analgesia, BAs 
were administered to mice by intraplantar injection. Paw thickness 
was measured to assess inflammatory edema, and paw withdrawal 
responsiveness to stimulation of the plantar surface with graded 
von Frey filaments was examined to assess mechanical pain.
After intraplantar injection to Tgr5-WT mice, DCA (12.5–125 
μg) caused a large and dose-dependent increase in paw thickness 
that was maximal at 1 hour and sustained for at least 4 hours (Figure 8A), indicative of edema. Capsaicin (5 μg) also induced edema. 
After intraplantar injection of DCA (25 μg) to Tgr5-WT mice, the 
filament stiffness required to elicit paw withdrawal increased, 
indicative of mechanical analgesia. The increased von Frey score 
was detected within 1 hour and maintained for at least 4 hours, 
with a maximal effect at 2–3 hours (Figure 8B). Intraplantar injection of UDCA (25 μg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) had no effect on von 
Frey score. Conversely, after intraplantar injection of capsaicin to Tgr5-WT 
mice, the filament stiffness required 
to elicit paw withdrawal decreased 
(Figure 8B), indicative of mechanical 
hyperalgesia. At 2 hours after intraplantar injection, the von Frey responses 
were 316.6% ± 44.4% of basal for DCA, 
67.6% ± 12.3% for UDCA, 76.6% ± 11.5% 
for vehicle, and 37.2% ± 14.1% for capsaicin (P = 0.002, DCA vs. vehicle). The 
analgesic action of intraplantar DCA 
was dose related, with a maximal effect 
observed with 37.5 μg (Figure 8C). 
In marked contrast to the analgesia 
observed in Tgr5-WT mice, intraplantar 
DCA did not cause mechanical analgesia in Tgr5-KO mice (Figure 8D). Similar 
to DCA, intraplantar injection of TLCA 
or OA (25 μg) caused mechanical analgesia in Tgr5-WT, but not Tgr5-KO, mice 
(Figure 8, E and F).
To determine whether opioids released 
locally within the paw contribute to BAinduced analgesia, DCA was administered by intraplantar injection to Tgr5-
WT mice; 2 hours later, mice received 
intraplantar injection of naloxone or 
vehicle. In vehicle-treated mice, DCA 
induced mechanical analgesia that was 
sustained for at least 4 hours (Figure 
8G). Naloxone fully reversed this analgesia within 1 hour.
In order to investigate whether BAs 
can affect pain by central mechanisms, 
BAs were injected intrathecally, and 
withdrawal responses to mechanical 
stimulation of the plantar surface of the paw with von Frey filaments was assessed. In Tgr5-WT mice, intrathecal DCA (25 μg) 
caused mechanical analgesia within 1 hour that was maintained 
for at least 4 hours, with a maximal effect at 2 hours (Figure 9A). 
Intrathecal injection of UDCA (25 μg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) had 
no effect. At 2 hours after intrathecal injection, responses were 
218.3% ± 43.7% of basal for DCA, 76.1% ± 12.1% for UDCA, and 
100.2% ± 17.4% for vehicle (P = 0.002, DCA vs. vehicle). DCAinduced analgesia was dose related, with a maximal response 
detected with 12.5 μg (Figure 9B). In contrast, intrathecal DCA 
did not cause mechanical analgesia in Tgr5-KO mice (Figure 9C). 
TGR5 overexpression did not influence the degree of analgesia in 
Tgr5-WT mice (data not shown), which was presumably maximal.
To evaluate the contribution of endogenous opioids to BAinduced analgesia, DCA (25 μg) was administered intrathecally to 
Tgr5-WT mice, and after 2 hours, mice received naloxone or vehicle 
systemically. In vehicle-treated mice, DCA induced mechanical 
analgesia that was sustained for at least 4 hours (Figure 9D). Naloxone fully reversed this analgesia within 1 hour.
These results indicated that BAs and TGR5-selective agonists 
induced mechanical analgesia by activating TGR5 in the periphery 
and spinal cord. TGR5-induced mechanical analgesia was mediated by opioids. Although intraplantar injection of BAs caused

opioids that activate MOR1 on pain-selective spinal neurons (iv). Activated MOR1 induces central 
mechanisms of analgesia (v).

to be substantially greater than the average effects we observed 
when recording from all neurons, regardless of Tgr5 expression. 
Differences in the level of Tgr5 expression between neurons could 
also account for the variability of effects of BAs on neuronal excitability. Although DCA and TLCA did not induce the spontaneous 
firing of APs in DRG neurons, OA did induce AP discharge in 35% 
of small-diameter neurons, in accord with the proportion of neurons expressing Tgr5 mRNA. Our results raise the possibility that 
BAs in peripheral tissues could activate TGR5 on nerve endings, 
leading to AP discharge and central transmission. The limitations 
of our study are that we applied agonists to the neuronal soma 
rather than the nerve endings and that we made recordings from 
isolated neurons in culture, where DRG soma have no stimulatory inputs beyond the depolarizing currents injected as part of the 
experimental protocol. Further studies are required to determine 
whether application of BAs to the skin results in central transmission. Although we detected TGR5-IR in the soma of DRG neurons, we did not detect TGR5-IR in nerve fibers in the skin or the 
dorsal horn, which is a caveat of our interpretation. Our inability 
to detect TGR5 in nerve fibers is likely related to the low density 
of innervation by TGR5-positive nerves and inadequate sensitivity 
for detecting the low receptor levels in nerve fibers, since we are 
also unable to detect TGR5 in the fibers of enteric neurons that 
highly express TGR5 in the soma (39).
We found that TGR5 activation stimulated the release of neuropeptides from segments of rat spinal cord with attached dorsal 
roots. DCA, TLCA, and OA stimulated a concentration-dependent 
release of GRP-IR that required the presence of extracellular calcium ions, whereas UDCA had minor stimulatory action only at the 
highest tested concentration. We were unable to study BA-evoked 
neuropeptide release from Tgr5-WT or Tgr5-KO mice because larger amounts of tissues were required for these analyses, which we 
obtained from rats. Thus, although our results suggest that BAs 
stimulate neuropeptide release by a TGR5-mediated mechanism, 
further studies using selective antagonists are required to definitively determine the involvement of TGR5. The GRP released from 
this preparation could derive from the central projections of DRG 
neurons or from spinal neurons. Although GRP has been detected 
in DRG neurons (10, 42), GRP is more prominently expressed by 
spinal neurons, including those within laminae I and II of the dorsal horn (50). We detected GRP-IR in both locations. However, 2 
observations suggested that BAs release GRP from intrinsic spinal 
neurons rather than from the terminals of DRG neurons in the 
dorsal horn. First, preincubation of tissues with the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, which depletes neuropeptides from nociceptors, did 
not prevent BA-evoked GRP-IR release. Second, capsaicin did not 
directly stimulate GRP-IR release. In marked contrast, capsaicin 
pretreatment prevented BA-stimulated release of CGRP-IR, and 
capsaicin directly stimulated CGRP-IR secretion. Thus, whereas 
CGRP derives from TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons, GRP probably derives from spinal neurons that do not express TRPV1. Further studies are require to determine the mechanism by which BAs 
induce GRP release from spinal neurons. One possibility is that 
BAs excite DRG neurons, which stimulate the release of a transmitter within the dorsal horn that promotes the secretion of GRP 
from spinal neurons. This possibility is in line with the ability of 
BAs to induce hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. The spinal transmitter that is released by BAs remains to be identified, although 
glutamate has been proposed as a transmitter for GRP-dependent 
and -independent synaptic transmission of itch within the dorsal 
inflammatory edema, the inflammation was unrelated to the analgesia: both DCA and capsaicin caused edema, yet DCA induced 
analgesia, whereas capsaicin had the opposite effect.
Discussion
We here report a new mechanism by which BAs cause itch and 
analgesia: TGR5 is expressed by sensory neurons that transmit itch 
and pain, and TGR5 activation enhances neuronal excitability. BAs 
stimulate release of GRP and Leu-ENK, modulators of itch and 
pain, from spinal cord with attached DRG. Additionally, BAs cause 
GRP- and MOR-dependent scratching and MOR-dependent antinociception. Our major finding was that BA-induced pruritogenic 
and analgesic responses were abrogated or absent in mice with loss 
of TGR5 function, whereas scratching was exacerbated in mice 
with gain of TGR5 function. These findings may provide insight 
into the mechanisms of cholestatic pruritus (2) and painless jaundice (3, 4). TGR5 antagonists may represent a new treatment for 
cholestatic pruritus, whereas TGR5 agonists may be analgesics.
Our results showed that BAs can signal to sensory neurons and 
cause TGR5- and GRP-mediated itch (Figure 10A). Using single-cell 
RT-PCR, we detected Tgr5 mRNA in 36% of small-diameter DRG 
neurons, where Tgr5 was often coexpressed with other mediators of 
itch, including Grp (10, 42) and the Trpa1 and Trpv1 ion channels 
(14, 43, 44). Using a TGR5-selective antibody, we found TGR5-IR 
to be localized to 28% of all DRG neurons and more than 60% of 
peptidergic neurons. In accord with a prior report (50), GRP-IR 
was expressed at low levels, which precluded quantification of the 
extent of colocalization with TGR5-IR. However, our results support other reports of Grp mRNA and GRP-IR in small-diameter 
DRG neurons expressing CGRP, SP, and TRP channels (10, 42).
Our electrophysiological studies of isolated DRG neurons provided evidence that BAs can induce neuronal hyperexcitability by 
activating TGR5. We observed that brief exposure of DRG neurons 
to the BAs DCA and TLCA, which potently activate TGR5 (28, 29), 
caused decreased rheobase and increased AP discharge frequency 
at 2× rheobase, indicative of increased intrinsic excitability of these 
neurons. Several observations suggest that these effects are mediated by activation of TGR5. First, DCA did not affect the excitability 
of DRG neurons from Tgr5-KO mice. Second, OA — a potent TGR5 
agonist that does not activate nuclear BA receptors (48) — was the 
strongest stimulant of excitability. Third, UDCA — which does not 
activate TGR5 or is a weak agonist (28, 49), yet retains the irritant and detergent properties of BAs — had no effect on neuronal 
excitability at any concentration tested. The effects of DCA, TLCA, 
and OA on rheobase were concentration dependent, and, with the 
exception of TLCA, all agonists increased AP discharge frequency 
at the highest tested concentrations. Importantly, BAs increased 
neuronal excitability at concentrations similar to those in the circulation and skin of cholestatic patients (18, 19). Collectively, our 
data indicate that BAs and a TGR5 agonist can directly regulate 
the excitability of small-diameter DRG neurons. Although our 
results support the hypothesis that BAs increase the intrinsic excitability of DRG neurons by activating TGR5, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that BAs also regulate excitability by other mechanisms 
(which may include activating nuclear BA receptors), or through 
effects on other cell surface receptors or ion channels. Further 
studies are required to investigate these possibilities. We recorded 
from all small-diameter DRG neurons, even though only a portion 
of these neurons (36%) expressed Tgr5 mRNA. Thus, the magnitude of the effects of BAs on TGR5-expressing neurons is likely

Tgr5-KO mice, and thus require TGR5 expression. Intraplantar 
DCA also caused edema, possibly due to release of SP and CGRP 
from cutaneous sensory nerves. However, the edema was unrelated 
to the analgesic actions of BAs, since capsaicin caused a similar 
degree of inflammation, yet was hyperalgesic. Naloxone reversed 
analgesia that was induced by peripherally and centrally administered DCA, implicating opioids and MOR. Mice with cholestasis 
also exhibit opioid-dependent antinociception (5). The source of 
opioids released after peripheral and central administration of 
DCA is unknown. We found TGR5-IR to be localized to dermal 
macrophages, consistent with other reports (28, 37). Leukocytes, 
including macrophages, express opioids that can activate MORs 
and δ-opioid receptors on the peripheral terminals of DRG neurons to suppress nociception (46). Further studies are required to 
determine whether BAs activate TGR5 on dermal macrophages to 
release opioids that activate receptors on sensory nerves in the skin 
and cause antinociception. However, the observation that intraplantar naloxone reversed analgesia to intraplantar DCA supports 
the local release of opioids, possibly from macrophages. We also 
detected TGR5-IR in regions of the spinal cord known to express 
opioids, including laminae I, II, and X (51), and TGR5 agonists 
stimulated release of Leu-ENK–IR from spinal cord. As expected, 
BA-evoked release of Leu-ENK–IR was unaffected by preincubation with capsaicin, and thus derives from spinal neurons. Our 
results suggest that BAs may activate TGR5 on spinal neurons to 
release opioids that induce analgesia. Further studies are required 
to identify the subtypes of spinal neurons that express TGR5 and 
to determine whether TGR5 is expressed by neurons that release 
opioids. It is not known whether cholestasis leads to increased levels of BAs in the spinal cord. However, BAs have been detected in 
rat brain (59) and in cerebrospinal fluid of normal human subjects 
(60), and levels are increased in patients with liver failure (61).
Opioids are pruritogens, and itch is a limiting side effect of 
intrathecal opiate analgesics (8). Naloxone inhibited DCA-induced 
scratching, implicating MOR in the central transmission of BAinduced itch (Figure 10A). Our observation that peripheral (but 
not central) BAs caused opioid-dependent itch suggests that BAs 
in the periphery can stimulate the central release of opioids. However, the mechanisms of this release remain to be determined. 
MOR isoforms that are selectively expressed by itch- or paintransmitting spinal neurons may mediate the pruritogenic and 
analgesic actions of spinal opioids (12). Interaction between the 
MOR1D isoform and GRPR in itch-transmitting spinal neurons 
provides a mechanism for morphine to activate GRPR and induce 
itch, whereas morphine activation of MOR1 in pain-transmitting 
spinal neurons mediates antinociception.
Our observations provide insight into the itch and analgesia 
that can accompany liver disease. The findings that BA levels are 
elevated in serum and skin of cholestatic patients (18, 19), that 
BAs cause itch (20, 21), and that BA-binding resins are an effective 
treatment (22) implicate BAs as causative agents of cholestatic 
itch. We observed hyperexcitability of DRG neurons and release 
of transmitters of itch and analgesia at BA concentrations, in line 
with the elevated levels of total BAs detected in serum of patients 
with cholestatic disease (61). However, BA levels do not necessarily correlate with pruritus severity (2, 22, 56, 62), and other pruritogens may also mediate itch. Of these, LPA is a strong candidate 
(55, 56). The levels of LPA and autotaxin, an enzyme that generates LPA, are elevated in the circulation of cholestatic patients 
with pruritus, and autotaxin levels correlate with the intensity of 
horn (57). We cannot exclude the possibility that SP and CGRP 
also contribute to BA-evoked itch, since both peptides colocalized with TGR5 in DRG neurons, and TGR5 agonists stimulated 
CGRP release from spinal cord/DRG. Further studies are required 
to assess the contributions of SP and CGRP to BA-stimulated itch. 
Our suggestion that BAs evoke GRP release from spinal rather 
than DRG neurons raise questions about the function of GRP in 
DRG neurons. The possibility that other pruritogens stimulate 
GRP release from DRG neurons remains to be investigated.
Our results showed that BAs cause scratching behavior by 
TGR5- and GRPR-mediated mechanisms. Intradermal injection 
of DCA, TLCA, and OA caused a robust concentration-dependent 
increase in scratching, whereas central administration of DCA had 
no effect. These results indicate that BAs cause scratching by activating TGR5 in the periphery, but not in the spinal cord. Antagonism of spinal GRPRs reduced BA-induced scratching, consistent with stimulation of an itch-selective pathway involving GRP 
release and activation of the GRPR on itch-selective neurons in 
the dorsal horn (10, 11). The pruritogenic effects of DCA, TLCA, 
and OA depended on the level of Tgr5 expression. Tgr5 deletion 
inhibited DCA-, TLCA-, and OA-stimulated scratching, whereas 
DCA-evoked scratching was more frequent in mice overexpressing Tgr5. However, histamine-stimulated scratching was unaffected by the level of Tgr5 expression. Thus, we conclude that TGR5 
selectively mediates BA-induced itch. In contrast to the analgesic 
effects of BAs, which were absent from Tgr5-KO mice, BA-stimulated scratching was not abolished by Tgr5 deletion, and UDCA also 
caused a low level of TGR5-independent scratching. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that BAs regulate sensory neurons by 
additional mechanisms, or that BAs activate TGR5 on other cells 
in the skin that release pruritogens. Studies using antagonists of 
plasma membrane and nuclear BA receptors and of mice selectively lacking neuronal TGR5 will be required to examine these possibilities. However, administration of a mast cell stabilizer and H1
receptor antagonist did not affect DCA-evoked scratching, which 
excludes involvement of mast cells and histamine in this process.
The level of Tgr5 expression per se determined scratching behavior, regardless of increased levels of BAs, since mice with a gain 
of Tgr5 function exhibited a 3.4-fold increase in spontaneous 
scratching compared with Tgr5-WT mice and a 7-fold increase in 
scratching compared with Tgr5-KO mice. Nothing is known about 
the level of TGR5 expression in cholestatic patients, although we 
detected increased TGR5-IR in neurons of mice after bile duct 
ligation (N.W. Bunnett and C.U. Corvera, unpublished observations). Thus, increased expression of TGR5 in sensory neurons 
may amplify responsiveness to physiological levels of BAs, which 
fluctuate with episodic secretion of bile (58).
We detected TGR5 in small-diameter DRG neurons that also 
expressed TRPV1 and TRPA1, although the role of these channels 
in BA- and TGR5-mediated itch is unknown. TRPV1 contributes 
to the pruritogenic actions of histamine (43), and GPCRs for some 
pruritogens activate TRPA1, which mediates their pruritogenic 
effects (44). Further studies are required to determine whether 
TGR5 couples to TRP channels that mediate itch transmission.
We conclude that BAs induce analgesia by TGR5- and opioiddependent mechanisms (Figure 10B). Intraplantar injection of 
DCA, TLCA, and OA and intrathecal injection of DCA reduced 
paw responsiveness to von Frey stimulation, indicative of mechanical analgesia by peripheral and central mechanisms. UDCA had 
no effect, and DCA, TLCA, and OA responses were absent from

transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase. PCR reactions 
used the following intron-spanning mouse primers: Tgr5 outer forward,

5′-GCCAGATCTTCTCCATG-3′ (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction contained 
primers, 0.5 U HotStar Taq Polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dNTP, and 
10× PCR buffer (Qiagen) (20 μl final volume). PCR reaction conditions were 
50 cycles of initial activation at 95°C for 15 minutes, denaturation at 94°C 
for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds, extension at 72°C for 
1 minute, and final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. As a positive control, 
RNA was isolated from whole DRG, spinal cord, or gall bladder and was 
reverse transcribed using Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen). As negative controls, 
fluid from the vicinity of the collected cells was amplified, or RT was omitted. Products were separated by electrophoresis (2% agarose), stained using 
ethidium bromide, and sequenced to confirm identity.
Immunolocalization and microscopy. DRG and spinal cord (thoracic, 
lumbar, and sacral) from C57BL/6 mice (male and female, 6–8 weeks of 
age) and Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 200 g) were collected and fixed (4% 
paraformaldehyde, 100 mM PBS, pH 7.4) for 2 hours on ice. Tissues were 
cleared in PBS (3×, 10 minutes), incubated in sucrose (30% w/v in PBS, 
overnight, 4°C), and embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek). Frozen sections 
(12 μm) were collected onto glass slides and air dried (1 hour, room temperature). Sections were blocked (10% normal horse serum, 0.1% Triton 
X-100 in PBS, 1 hour, room temperature), then incubated with the following primary antibodies in blocking buffer (overnight, 4°C): rabbit antiTGR5 (1:200–1:500, P87/88; ref. 39); sheep anti-CGRP (1:1,000; ref. 64); 
rat anti-SP (1:800; ref. 65); goat anti-GRP (1:100, C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-GRP17–27 (1:1,000, 1078; ref. 45); human anti-Hu (panneuronal marker, 1:10,000; ref. 66); or IB4-FITC (1:400; Vector Laboratories). Sections were washed (3× PBS, 10 minutes) and incubated for 1 hour 
at room temperature with the following fluorescent secondary antibodies: donkey anti-sheep IgG–Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500), anti-sheep IgG–Alexa 
Fluor 647 (1:500), anti-rabbit IgG–Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000), anti-rabbit 
IgG–Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500; Molecular Probes), anti-human IgG–Texas 
Red (1:100), or anti-rat IgG–FITC (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Tissues were washed and mounted using Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Specificity of the TGR5 antibody was determined by incubation of the TGR5 antibody with DRG from Tgr5-WT or Tgr5-KO mice, or by preadsorption of 
diluted TGR5 antibody with receptor fragment that was used for immunization (GPSIAYHPSSQSSVDLDLN, 50 μM, overnight, 4°C) prior to staining. Specificity of the secondary antibodies was evaluated by replacement 
of the primary TGR5 antibody with normal rabbit IgG (1:500, SC-2027; 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or by omission of the primary antibody. Positive and negative control samples were imaged under identical conditions. 
Specificity of the 2 GRP antibodies was determined by simultaneous staining of DRG sections and of sections and myenteric plexus whole-mounts 
of the gastric antrum (39), an established site of GRP expression that 
served as a positive control.
To localize TGR5 in the skin, frozen sections (6 μm) of mouse skin were 
prepared, and TGR5 was detected by immunohistochemistry using rabbit 
itch (56). Moreover, LPA stimulates scratching behavior in mice 
(55, 56). Our results showed that LPA did not activate TGR5, even 
at concentrations far in excess of those that activate LPA receptors (i.e., 500 μM), and that TGR5 did not mediate LPA-evoked 
scratching. Moreover, in contrast to BA-evoked itch, ketotifen 
inhibits LPA-evoked itch (55), suggesting different mechanisms. 
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that LPA mediates 
cholestatic itch. Although the contribution of GRP to cholestatic 
pruritus has not been investigated, opioids have been implicated, 
since naloxone alleviates cholestatic pruritus (26) and analgesia 
(5), and circulating opioids increase during cholestasis, although 
levels do not necessarily correlate with the degree of itch (23, 24, 
56). Additional studies are required to examine whether centrally 
and peripherally released opioids contribute to BA-evoked itch 
and analgesia and to investigate the involvement of TGR5 in itch 
in patients with cholestatic disease.
Our results raise questions about the role of TGR5 in the nervous system. Although TGR5 may allow primary spinal afferent 
and spinal neurons to respond to elevated BA levels during cholestatic diseases, what is the physiologically relevant activator 
of neuronal TGR5? One possibility is that TGR5 allows sensory 
nerves to detect and respond to the increased circulating levels of 
BAs after feeding (58) or to detect BAs that are synthesized in the 
central nervous system (60). Alternatively, there may be distinct 
TGR5 agonists in the nervous system, such as neurosteroids that 
are structurally related to BAs and are potential TGR5 agonists in 
the central nervous system (40, 41). The physiological relevance of 
these new sensory mechanisms remains to be determined.
Methods
Animals. Tgr5-KO, Tgr5-Tg and Tgr5-WT mice (C57BL/6 background) have 
been described previously (32). Mice were maintained as heterozygotes, 
and age- and gender-matched littermates were studied. C57BL/6 mice and 
Sprague-Dawley rats were from Charles River Laboratories and Harlan Laboratories. Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment 
with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and free access to food and water. 
Animals were killed by anesthetic overdose and bilateral thoracotomy.
Dissociation and selection of DRG neurons. Male and female C57BL/6 mice 
were transcardially perfused with Krebs bicarbonate solution (118 mM 
NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.9 mM CaCl2, 
25.0 mM NaHCO3, 11.1 mM dextrose, 95% O2, and 5% CO2 [pH 7.4]). 
DRG were removed, pooled, and incubated in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free Hanks 
balanced salt solution containing collagenase and dispase II (both 2 mg/
ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Neurons were dissociated by 
trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, followed by 2 repeated 
enzymatic digestions for 20 minutes at 37°C. Neurons were washed by 
centrifugation and resuspension (3×, 1,000 g, 2 minutes) and suspended 
in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. Dissociated neurons were plated 
onto coverslips coated in 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine and 0.004 mg/ml laminin, then incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a humidified incubator (37°C, 95% air, 5% CO2) until selection for single-cell RT-PCR within 
8 hours of DRG removal. Cover slips were perfused with Krebs solution 
(95% O2, 5% CO2). Individual small-diameter neurons (<25 μm) were drawn 
into a glass pipette (tip diameter, 25–100 μm) pulled with a micropipette 
puller (model P-87; Sutter Instruments Co.) by applying negative pressure 
(63). The pipette tip was broken into a PCR tube containing 1 μl resuspension buffer and RNAse inhibitor (RNAseOUT, 2 U/μl; Invitrogen). The 
tubes were immediately snap frozen.
Single-cell RT-PCR. Single neurons were processed to obtain cDNA using 
Superscript III Cells Direct cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to

shaved, and mice were placed in individual cylinders on a glass shelf. Mice 
were acclimatized to the experimental room, restraint apparatus, and 
investigator for 2-hour periods on 2 successive days before experiments. 
Peripheral administration of test agents — DCA, TLCA, OA, or UDCA 
(5–25 μg); histamine (50 μg); or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 10 μl) — was done 
by intradermal injection at the nape of the neck. For central administration, DCA (25 μg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 5 μl) were injected intrathecally 
(L4/L5) in conscious mice. Hind limb scratching of the injection site was 
video recorded for 240 minutes. To examine the contribution of GRP, 
the GRPR antagonist [Tyr4, D-Phe12]-bombesin (2 mM, 16 μg; AnaSpec; 
ref. 53) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 5 μl) was injected intrathecally (L4/L5) 
10 minutes before DCA injection. To evaluate the contribution of opioids, 
5 mg/kg naloxone hydrochloride was injected intravenously (tail vein) 30 
minutes before recordings, and mice received intradermal DCA at 0 and 
180 minutes of recordings. To determine whether mast cells participate in 
BA-induced scratching, the mast cell stabilizer and H1 receptor antagonist 
ketotifen (1 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was administered to mice 
5 minutes before DCA injection. The role of TGR5 in LPA-evoked scratching was examined by comparing scratching in Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO mice 
after intradermal injection of LPA (100 μg). Scratching behavior was quantified by 2 observers unaware of test agents or genotypes. 1 scratch was 
defined as lifting the hind limb to the injection site and then a placing of 
the paw on the floor, regardless of the number of strokes. If counts differed 
by greater than 3 scratches over a 30-minute period, both observers reevaluated the record. Results were expressed as the number of scratching events 
during 15, 30, or 60 minutes of observation.
Pain behavior. Tgr5-WT, Tgr5-KO, and Tgr5-Tg mice were studied (male 
and female, 6–20 weeks of age). Mice were placed in individual cylinders on 
a mesh stand. Mice were acclimatized to the experimental room, restraint 
apparatus, and investigator for 2-hour periods on 2 successive days before 
experiments. To assess mechanical pain, paw withdrawal in response to 
stimulation of the plantar surface of the hind paw with graded von Frey 
filaments (0.078, 0.196, 0.392, 0.686, 1.569, 3.922, 5.882, 9.804, 13.725, and 
19.608 mN) was determined using the “up-and-down” paradigm (68). In 
this analysis, an increase in the filament stiffness required to induce paw 
withdrawal indicates mechanical analgesia, whereas a decrease in the filament stiffness required to induce withdrawal indicates mechanical hyperalgesia. To assess inflammatory edema of the paw, hind paw thickness was 
measured using digital calipers before and after treatments. On the day 
before the study, von Frey scores were measured in triplicate to establish a 
baseline for each animal. For peripheral administration of test agents, mice 
were sedated with 5% isoflurane, and DCA, TLCA, OA, or UDCA (12.5–125 
μg); capsaicin (5 μg); or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 10 μl) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of 1 hind paw. For central administration 
of test agents, DCA or UDCA (0.25–25 μg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 5 μl) 
was injected intrathecally (L4/L5) in conscious mice. von Frey score and 
paw thickness were determined 60–240 minutes after injection. To evaluate the contribution of opioids released locally within the paw to analgesia induced by peripherally administered BA, naloxone hydrochloride 
(5 μg, 10 μl) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 10 μl) was administered by intraplantar 
injection 2 hours after intraplantar injection of DCA (25 μg). To assess the 
involvement of opioids to analgesia induced by central administration of 
BAs, naloxone hydrochloride (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was injected 
intravenously (tail vein) 2 hours after an intrathecal injection of DCA 
(25 μg). Investigators were unaware of test agents or genotypes. von Frey 
scores and paw thickness were expressed as percent of basal value.
TGR5 activation assay. HEK293 cells stably expressing human TGR5 were 
generated and maintained as described previously (39). TGR5 activation 
was assessed by measuring cAMP formation. Cells (10,000 cells per 5 μl) 
were suspended in phenol red–free DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.1% BSA, 
anti-TGR5 (1:1,000, P87/88; ref. 39) and the Biotin-Avidin System (Vector 
Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Slides were examined by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 
Meta microscope, or by bright field microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 
microscope, with ×10 Plan Apochromat (NA 0.45) and ×20 Plan Neofluar 
(NA 0.5) objectives (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Image brightness and contrast were 
modified using Adobe Photoshop CS5. Images of TGR5-positive and -negative control slides were collected and processed identically.
Coexpression of TGR5-IR with neurochemical markers in DRG neurons 
was evaluated by examination of captured images (single plane); only those 
neurons with a clearly defined nucleus were included in counts. All positive 
neurons from each image were counted. The proportion of TGR5-positive 
neurons was expressed as a percentage of neurochemically defined neurons 
and of the total number of neurons. The cross-sectional area of TGR5-positive DRG neurons was determined from captured images using ImageJ software (NIH). Only neurons with a detectable nucleus were considered in this 
analysis, and only every third section was analyzed to avoid duplication of 
measurements. Bins of 50 μm2 were used to subdivide neurons based on size.
Patch-clamp recordings. DRG (thoracic and lumbar) from mice (C57BL/6 
Tgr5-WT and Tgr5-KO, male) were acutely dissociated (47). Briefly, DRG 
were incubated in collagenase (1 mg/ml; Worthington) and dispase (4 mg/
ml; Roche) for 10 minutes at 37°C, triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and incubated for an additional 5 minutes at 37°C. Dissociated neurons were plated onto vitrogen-coated coverslips and stored in a 
humidified incubator (37°C, 95% air, 5% CO2) until retrieval (4–24 hours) 
for electrophysiological studies. Perforated patch-clamp recordings were 
made from small-diameter neurons (<30 pF capacitance) in current clamp 
mode at room temperature (47). The pipette solution contained 110 mM 
K-gluconate, 30 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2; 
the external solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 
10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.25). The recording 
chamber was continuously perfused with external solution, and agonists 
were applied using a multi-barrel fast-flow system. The resting membrane 
potential, input resistance, rheobase (current required to generate 1 AP), 
and AP discharge frequency at 2× rheobase were recorded. Input currents 
were applied for 500 ms. Recordings were made from the same neurons 
under control basal conditions or after exposure to DCA, TLCA, UDCA, or 
OA (10, 30, or 100 μM) or vehicle (1% DMSO, 0.9% NaCl) for 10 minutes.
Neuropeptide release. Slices (0.4 mm) of spinal cord with attached dorsal 
roots from male Sprague-Dawley rats (combined cervical, thoracic, and 
lumbar-sacral segments) were prepared at 4°C (McIlwain Tissue Chopper). 
Slices (100 mg) were superfused with Krebs solution (119 mM NaCl, 25 mM 
NaHCO3, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 4.7 mM KCl, 11 
mM d-glucose, 95% CO2, 5% O2, 37°C) containing 0.1% BSA and peptidase 
inhibitors (1 μM phosphoramidon and 1 μM captopril) (67). Tissues were 
stabilized for 90 minutes, after which superfusate was sampled at 10-minute intervals. After collection of 2 basal samples, slices were stimulated with 
DCA, TLCA, UDCA, or OA (10–500 μM) for 60 minutes. At the end of the 
experiment, tissues were blotted and weighed. Fractions (2 ml) were freezedried and reconstituted with assay buffer, and GRP-IR, Leu-ENK–IR, and 
CGRP-IR were determined by enzyme immunoassays (Phoenix Pharmaceutical). Peptide concentrations were calculated as picomoles per gram tissue 
wet weight. To examine whether BA-evoked neuropeptide release required 
calcium, slices were perfused with calcium-free Krebs (1 mM EDTA). To 
determine whether neuropeptides were released from primary spinal afferent 
expressing TRPV1, either tissues were preincubated with capsaicin (10 μM, 
20 minutes) before stimulation with BAs, or the direct stimulatory effects of 
capsaicin (0.1 μM) on neuropeptide release were examined.
Scratching behavior. Tgr5-WT, Tgr5-KO, and Tgr5-Tg mice were studied 
(male and female, 6–20 weeks of age). The fur at the base of the neck was

and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and were stimulated with DCA or 
LPA (18:1; 10–12 M to 10–2 M) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were lysed with 
1 volume of 0.3% Tween 20, 5 mM HEPES, and 0.1% BSA in water (pH 7.4). 
cAMP in the lysate was assayed using ALPHA-screen, according to the

Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were compared statistically using Graphpad Prism 5. Differences between 2 groups were 
examined using paired 2-tailed t tests (excitability of the same neurons and 
neuropeptide release from the same tissues before and after BA exposure) 
or unpaired 2-tailed t tests (excitability of different neurons or behavioral 
responses of different mice treated with vehicle or test agents). Differences 
among multiple groups were examined using ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test (behavioral studies using multiple test agents or 
mouse genotypes) or Dunnett post-hoc test (excitability of different neurons incubated with graded concentrations of BAs). A P value less than 0.05 
was considered significant.
