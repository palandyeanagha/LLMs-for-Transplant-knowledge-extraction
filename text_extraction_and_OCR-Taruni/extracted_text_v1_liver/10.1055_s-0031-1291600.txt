Treatment of a refractory biliary stricture after
living donor liver transplantation, with a short
fully covered metal stent with a long string
In July 2007, a 56-year-old man with
hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma underwent living donor liver
transplantation (LDLT), at our institute,
using the right lobe graft. We carried out
double duct-to-duct biliary anastomoses
of the two graft bile ducts – one to the recipient’s common hepatic duct and the
other to the cystic duct.
In October 2008, the patient had obstructive jaundice, and was diagnosed as having late biliary strictures involving both
anastomoses (●" Fig. 1). Two percutaneous
trans-anastomotic biliary catheters were
placed. Over the course of 12 months, the
patient underwent seven sessions of
percutaneous balloon dilation in both
anastomoses. Follow-up cholangiography
showed resolution of the stricture at the
anastomosis with the recipient cystic
duct, and persistence of the angulated
stricture at the second anastomosis with
the common hepatic duct, which was
confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (●" Fig. 2).
Owing to failure of the percutaneous
treatment, and to avoid occlusion of the
anastomosis to the cystic duct, we placed
a short Niti-S biliary, fully covered, selfexpandable metal stent (SEMS; Taewoong
Medical Co. Ltd., Seoul, South Korea), 3 cm
in length and 8mm in diameter, with an
incorporated platinum radiopaquemarked, 10-cm long retrieval string,
across the stricture (●" Fig. 3). The SEMS
was removed 3 months later by grasping
the string with standard forceps. A final
cholangiogram showed resolution of the
stricture (●" Fig. 4). No further procedure
was carried out during the 1 year of follow-up.

Biliary complications remain the most
common and intractable problem after
LDLT, with the incidence of biliary strictures ranging from 3.7 % to 25.3 % [1, 2].
The use of covered SEMS to treat post-liver-transplantation biliary strictures has
been reported [3–5]. This report highlights the feasibility and usefulness of a
short SEMS in the treatment of a refractory, and otherwise untreatable, biliary
stricture after LDLT with double duct-toduct biliary reconstruction.
