Due to higher vulnerability and immunogenicity of extended criteria donor (ECD) organs
used for organ transplantation (Tx), the discovery of new treatment strategies, involving
tissue allorecognition pathways, is important. The implementation of machine perfusion
(MP) led to improved estimation of the organ quality and introduced the possibility
to achieve graft reconditioning prior to Tx. A significant number of experimental
and clinical trials demonstrated increasing support for MP as a promising method
of ECD organ preservation compared to classical static cold storage. MP reduced
ischemia–reperfusion injury resulting in the protection from inadequate activation of
innate immunity. However, there are no general agreements on MP protocols, and
clinical application is limited. The objective of this comprehensive review is to summarize
literature on immunological effects of MP of ECD organs based on experimental studies
and clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION
The remarkable evolution of solid organ transplantation (Tx) has led to improved overall
outcomes for patients with terminal organ dysfunction. However, ischemia–reperfusion injury
(IRI) in combination with early immune activation remains a significant challenge limiting the
potential of this therapy (1, 2). IRI depends on several factors, including primary condition
of the graft and length of cold and warm ischemia time (CIT and WIT). It additionally
determines the extent of the inflammatory response and increases immunogenicity and the
degree of microcirculatory perfusion failure during reperfusion resulting in early allograft
dysfunction or primary non-function (3, 4). As a link between the degree of IRI and activation
of innate immunity (5) has been proposed, the discovery of new treatment strategies including
tissue allorecognition pathways (Figure 1) has gained importance, especially in the era of
extended criteria donor (ECD) organ Tx. The direct pathway starts with recipient CD4
and CD8 T cells recognizing endogenous alloantigens presented by donor human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) molecules on the surface of donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) after
their migration from the graft to the recipient’s lymph nodes. This process is initiated by
the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from damaged cells during IRI (4). On
the other hand, the indirect allorecognition relies on recipient-derived APCs, which ingest,
process, and present alloantigens (typically HLA antigens) in the context of recipient HLA, for
self-restricted recognition by recipient T cells (6, 7). In the semi-direct pathway, recipient APCs

acquire donor HLA molecules that present alloantigens directly
to recipient T cells (8). Direct allorecognition alone can result in
acute rejection, even without indirect mechanisms. Furthermore,
depletion of donor immune cells from an organ prior to Tx may
prevent rejection (9).
For more than 50 years, static cold storage (SCS) was the
gold standard method for organ preservation until the interest
in the concept of organ machine perfusion (MP) was renewed
(10). To date, a significant number of experimental and clinical
trials were published demonstrating increasing support of MP as
a more physiologic method of solid organ preservation compared
to SCS (11–15).
MP is a promising tool to reduce the gap between organ
demand and supply that is resulting in a dramatic prolongation
in waiting times and associated with increased morbidity and
mortality for patients on the waiting list for Tx (16). In an effort
to counter this trend, organ allografts that would have previously
been deemed unsuitable are nowadays more frequently used
for Tx (12) including donation after circulatory death (DCD)
and ECD (aged ≥ 60 years or aged 50–59 years with vascular
comorbidities) organs (12, 17, 18). Older donor organs have
higher immunogenicity, mediated by poorer monocyte clearance
of damaged necrotic cells, and therefore recipients may require
a more intense immunosuppression in the early period after
Tx (19–22). Knowing about the ECD grafts’ increased risk for
poor function or failure (23–25), implementation of new storage
techniques, such as MP, paved the way for better characterization
of organ quality and the possibility for graft reconditioning before
Tx to improve organ vulnerability and immunogenicity (10, 26).
MP reduced IRI in experimental and clinical models of ECD
organ Tx resulting in protection from inadequate activation of
innate immunity (1, 27–36).
Figure 2 summarizes frequently described MP settings
including the underlying mechanisms. Briefly, hypothermic
MP (HMP, 4–10◦C) is based on the concept that oxidative
energy production by mitochondrial electron transport is
sustained at reduced rates by keeping low temperatures (10).
In contrast, normothermic MP (NMP, 37◦C) aims to provide
an approximately near physiological environment for organs
ex vivo (37). Subnormothermic MP (SNMP, ∼21◦C) is a
halfway approach between HMP and NMP, while controlled
oxygenated rewarming (COR) is a concept to rescue cold-stored
marginal grafts by gentle oxygenated warming up prior to blood
reperfusion (38, 39).
Currently, there are no general agreements on MP protocols,
and clinical application is limited due to the lack of randomized
clinical trials comparing the different MP strategies. The objective
of this comprehensive review is to summarize literature on MP of
ECD organs and discuss arising immunological aspects based on
experimental studies and clinical trials.
MACHINE PERFUSION OF EXTENDED
CRITERIA DONOR KIDNEY GRAFTS
It seems that MP for Tx of ECD kidneys is associated
with decreased IRI resulting in improved outcome
compared to SCS (Table 1). Whereas most studies

Kvietkauskas et al. Machine Perfusion of ECD Organs
FIGURE 2 | Different machine perfusion strategies of extended criteria donor organs for protection against activation of innate immunity.
on MP in ECD kidneys reported positive effects on
the graft, only a few studies reported inconclusive
results (40, 48).
Hypothermic Machine Perfusion
Techniques
A DCD porcine kidney HMP model demonstrated improved
graft outcome (27, 41, 42), particularly concerning the chronic
effects of IRI by protecting against chronic immune response
by reducing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (27).
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition plays an important role in
the genesis of fibroblasts in the course of interstitial fibrosis (27,
52). Furthermore, oxygenated HMP showed superior outcome
rates compared to non-oxygenated HMP (41). The significantly
reduced occurrence of typical signs for chronic graft loss,
like chronic inflammation or interstitial fibrosis, confirmed
an improvement in recovery from IRI (41). Lately, the use
of an extracellular oxygen transporter was investigated. M101
(hemoglobin of the marine worm) was associated with improved
effects of HMP upon recovery and late graft outcome, shown
by the nearly absent infiltration of mast cells resulting in
reduced levels of fibrosis in the kidney (42). Extracellular oxygen
carriers may logistically, rheologically, and immunologically be
superior to packed red blood cells, but need further investigation.
Studies on human DCD and ECD kidneys supported the
superiority of HMP over SCS (32, 43, 45, 46). Reznik et al.
(43) found a considerably lower number of complications
and negative effects, like acute rejection, correlated with HMP
kidneys retrieved from DCD donors. Another study in ECD
kidneys (Nyberg Score class C or D) demonstrated an association
of HMP with lower levels of early inflammatory cytokines
[tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL1β] in perfusion solution compared to SCS (32). HMP also
affected the expression of hypoxia-related genes [i.e., hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1α] (46). This may limit interstitial
fibrosis and tubular atrophy, improving long-term outcomes
in kidney Tx. ECD kidneys profited most by application of
HMP (46).
Normothermic Machine Perfusion
Techniques
In a pig study, reduced graft immunogenicity was achieved
by initiating an inflammatory cytokine storm [especially IL-6,
interferon leading to a donor-derived leukocyte mobilization
and removal prior to kidney Tx (1). The authors proposed
that migration of donor leukocytes in conjunction with the
secretion of an IL-6, IFN-γ, and CXCL-8 storm leads to direct
allorecognition and activates the recipient immune response
following Tx (1). Short-term NMP of cold-stored human ECD
kidneys did not reduce the incidence of acute rejection, while
the rate of delayed graft function improved significantly (5.6 vs.
36.2%) (45). More recently, Weissenbacher et al. (49) was able to
maintain the quality of ECD kidneys for up to 24 h, hence buying
time for viability assessment, improving the feasibility to exploit
this important source of donor organs using the NMP technique.
Although the primary results are encouraging, more research
focusing on the reduction of immunogenicity of ECD organs
is needed.
MACHINE PERFUSION OF EXTENDED
CRITERIA DONOR LIVER GRAFTS
Currently, there is no general consensus on the standardized
pretreatment of ECD livers in order to improve Tx outcomes
(53). Experimental and clinical studies of MP of ECD livers are
summarized in Table 2.
Hypothermic Machine
Perfusion Techniques
In several studies in DCD rat models, a reduction in IRI in
liver tissue was evident after HMP when compared to SCS
(28, 29, 54, 56, 57, 61, 62). This finding was confirmed in
large domestic animal studies (64, 71). Hypothermic oxygenated

perfusion (HOPE) treatment of DCD and severely fatty livers
significantly decreased IRI of hepatocytes by reducing the
activation of Kupffer and endothelial cells (29, 70). Moreover,
HOPE successfully suppressed the recipient’s immune system,
blunting the alloimmune pathway (28, 29). This was evident
by decreased Kupffer and endothelial cell activation induced by
initial anti-oxidative effects and damage-associated molecular
pattern (DAMP) release as a consequence of HOPE treatment
and liver Tx (28). Furthermore, T cell infiltration in liver grafts
as well as blood levels of circulating activated T cells decreased
(28). A short time (1 h) of reconditioning of DCD rat and porcine
livers using HMP after up to 16 h of SCS showed improvements
in organ quality (58, 64). Long-term (24 h) HMP of DCD rat
livers markedly reduced HLA class II antigen expression on
post-sinusoidal venular endothelium compared to SCS (55).
Bae et al. (33) found that supplementation of HMP perfusion
solution with the antioxidant, vitamin E, reduced inflammatory
cytokine levels [IL-6, TNF-α, and monocyte chemoattractant
protein (MCP)-1], involved in alloimmune response, in graft
tissue. The addition of metformin to HMP preservation solution
reduced liver IRI, with significant protective effects on livers,
especially in aged rats (69). Furthermore, HMP significantly
reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-8) (34). The attenuation of those cytokines affects
many downstream pathways, including a reduced expression
of chemokines and adhesion molecules such as intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, MCP-1, P-selectin, and others.
This effect subsequently decreases the level of neutrophil
activation and inevitable leukocyte migration to stressed cell
sites, leading to improved overall outcome rates in human livers
(34). In another study, HOPE protected DCD livers from initial
IRI, leading to improved graft function preventing intrahepatic
biliary complications; however, acute rejection rate remained
similar (16 vs. 12%) when compared to SCS (75).
Subnormothermic/Normothermic Machine
Perfusion Techniques
SNMP and NMP significantly ameliorated hepatic damage in
DCD livers compared to SCS in animal models (31, 39, 60, 65,
68, 72). In a porcine model of liver MP, prolonged periods of
NMP facilitate a reduction in hepatic steatosis (63), while the
supplementation of perfusate with defatting agents significantly
reduced the intracellular fat content of perfused rat livers within
a few hours (59). Efficient vasodilation was found to be important
in order to improve the effectiveness in the preservation of
DCD livers during NMP (66). Olschewski et al. (60) compared
HMP to SNMP and SCS, demonstrating beneficial effects on
the initial organ function, structural integrity of the sinusoidal
endothelium, and hepatocellular damage when DCD rat livers
were perfused using SNMP. Furthermore, SNMP was associated
with lower IRI when compared to SCS (74), while prolonged
NMP additionally eliminated the neutrophil infiltrate in grafts
(76). Another study of ECD livers showed superiority of COR
over HMP, SNMP, and SCS (38). When comparing NMP to
SNMP and SCS, NMP was most efficient in terms of recovery of
DCD livers (67). Avoiding initial hypothermia did not improve
liver graft quality in a porcine DCD model of NMP (73). Recently,
the first randomized controlled trial showed a 50% reduction
in liver graft injury, despite a 50% decrease in the number of
discarded organs and a 54% increased mean preservation time
after a period of NMP compared to SCS (∼36% of grafts were
DCD). However, they found no significant difference in bile duct
complications, graft, or patient survival (78).
The currently ongoing VITTAL trial aims to improve the
suitability of non-transplantable livers in the UK by monitoring
their function during NMP followed by Tx of the sufficiently
improved graft (79, 80). We expect that the results of this novel
approach could improve consistency and increase the usage of
ECD liver grafts without compromising recipient safety.

Short-term HMP could resuscitate ischemically damaged DCD
lungs and ameliorate IRI. In a canine model of MP, HMP
improved the ATP production by the mitochondrial electron
transport chain, leading to a significant decrease in oxidative
damage and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and
TNF-α) after reperfusion compared to SCS (81). Moreover, shortterm HMP washed out residual microthrombi in the donor lungs.

Perfusion Techniques
NMP was able to modulate pro-inflammatory gene expression
and reduce pulmonary dysfunction, edema, pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and the number of neutrophils in animal DCD
lungs (82, 83). Moreover, NMP resulted in reduced donor
leukocyte transfer into the recipient by inducing mobilization
of donor leukocytes into the perfusate and allowing their
removal via the leukocyte filter prior to Tx (9). Therefore,
reduced donor leukocyte migration to recipient lymph nodes
resulted in a reduction of direct allorecognition and T cell
priming, diminishing recipient T cell infiltration, the hallmark
of acute rejection (9). In a clinical study, NMP showed
the capacity to remove donor dendritic cells generating
non-classical monocytes, which are directly involved in
immune surveillance, from the graft (36). NMP of donor
after brain death (DBD) lungs with clinically diagnosed
infection significantly reduced bacterial counts in the fluid
of the bronchoalveolar lavage and inflammatory injury by
decreasing endotoxin levels and key inflammatory mediators
[TNF-α, IL-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α,
MIP-1β] when combined with broad-spectrum antibiotic
treatment (35). The administration of mesenchymal stromal
cells (MSCs) ameliorated ischemic injury in donor lungs
during ex vivo NMP and attenuated the subsequent IRI after
Tx (84).
The use of MP in reconditioning of ECD donor lungs for Tx
is currently under investigation in clinical trials (85, 86), with
results being expected soon.
MACHINE PERFUSION OF EXTENDED
CRITERIA DONOR HEART GRAFTS
Currently, clinical evidence of MP in ECD heart grafts is
limited (Table 4). HMP improved the preservation of DCD
heart grafts compared to SCS proven by superior postreperfusion contractility. The underlying mechanisms could
include enhanced preservation of the energetic states and
superior cellular integrity (87). Recently, Korkmaz-Icöz et al.
(88) demonstrated that HMP of aged donor hearts with MSCs
protected against myocardial IRI in a rat model.

with a reduction in islet and acinar cell damage, stable perfusion
dynamics, and minimal edematous weight change as well as
potentially ameliorated endocrine viability and functionality after
preservation (89, 90). More recent studies in the human pancreas
indicated that especially DCD pancreas benefits more from
oxygenated HMP compared to SCS alone (91). Even 24 h of
HMP of ECD human pancreas–duodenum organs was feasible
resulting in no deleterious parenchymal effects (92). Since those
studies focused on the results after MP without following Tx,
currently, there are no data available about clinical outcomes in
this context.
CONCLUSION
MP allows successful utilization of more vulnerable and
immunogenic otherwise discarded ECD organs. It has been
shown that MP not only reduces the levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and positively influences gene expression related to
hypoxia during reperfusion but also induces donor-derived
leukocytes, including dendritic cell-generating non-classical
monocytes, mobilization, and removal prior to Tx. Moreover,
MP was able to protect against epithelial and Kupffer cell
activation and to reduce recipient T cell infiltration of the
donor graft. More recently, novel methods such as viral vector
delivery during MP to allografts are under investigation (93).
This biological modification of the graft prior to Tx may be
a future therapeutic strategy to suppress the immune response
against the allograft leading to Tx without or at least reduced
dose of the systemic immunosuppression that carries the
additional risk of infection and malignancy. Many studies have
already shown superiority of ECD organ MP over the current
standard SCS. However, there are no general agreements on
MP protocols, and wider clinical application is limited due to
the lack of randomized controlled trials. More trials focusing
on immunological pathways in the different MP settings with
respect to every single organ are mandatory to get detailed

mechanistic insights. This knowledge about various pathways
will help us to optimize organ quality after MP of ECD
organs and therefore improve Tx outcomes as well as graft and
patient survival.
