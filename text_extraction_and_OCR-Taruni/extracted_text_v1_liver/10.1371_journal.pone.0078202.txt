Abstract
Background: Tools to predict death or spontaneous survival are necessary to inform liver transplantation (LTx) decisions in
pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), but such tools are not available. Recent data suggest that immune/inflammatory
dysregulation occurs in the setting of acute liver failure. We hypothesized that specific, dynamic, and measurable patterns of
immune/inflammatory dysregulation will correlate with outcomes in PALF.
Methods: We assayed 26 inflammatory mediators on stored serum samples obtained from a convenience sample of 49
children in the PALF study group (PALFSG) collected within 7 days after enrollment. Outcomes were assessed within 21 days
of enrollment consisting of spontaneous survivors, non-survivors, and LTx recipients. Data were subjected to statistical
analysis, patient-specific Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) inference.
Findings: Raw inflammatory mediator levels assessed over time did not distinguish among PALF outcomes. However, DBN
analysis did reveal distinct interferon-gamma-related networks that distinguished spontaneous survivors from those who
died. The network identified in LTx patients pre-transplant was more like that seen in spontaneous survivors than in those
who died, a finding supported by PCA.
Interpretation: The application of DBN analysis of inflammatory mediators in this small patient sample appears to
differentiate survivors from non-survivors in PALF. Patterns associated with LTx pre-transplant were more like those seen in
spontaneous survivors than in those who died. DBN-based analyses might lead to a better prediction of outcome in PALF,
and could also have more general utility in other complex diseases with an inflammatory etiology.

Introduction
Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a complex, catastrophic,
rapidly evolving clinical syndrome [1]. Like all complex diseases,
the clinical trajectory of PALF is dynamic and non-linear. Its
course reflects a complex interaction among the child’s clinical
condition, response to supportive care, disease severity, potential
for recovery, and availability of a suitable organ if liver
transplantation (LTx) is believed to be life-saving [2]. Yet, LTx
is irreversible and impacts both society, in terms of organ
allocation, as well as the individual patient and family coping
with life-long immunosuppression and monitoring. Identification
of patients likely to survive or die or whose condition would not
benefit from LTx is necessary to inform LTx decisions.
Outcomes in PALF vary both between and among diagnostic
categories, yet LTx occurs more commonly among those patients
with an indeterminate diagnosis [3]. Recent data suggest immune
or inflammatory dysregulation occurs in the setting of acute liver
failure (ALF). For example, patients with acute liver failure (ALF)
have increased risk for bacterial and fungal infections [4], aplastic
anemia [5,6], and impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity
[4]. Moreover, evidence of immune-inflammatory activation,
characterized by marked elevation of soluble interleukin-2
receptor alpha (sIL-2R a), was identified in PALF [7]. These
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e78202

observations led us to hypothesize that immune or inflammatory
dysregulation is present in PALF.
Acute inflammation elicits interrelated immune, inflammatory,
neuronal, and physiological responses that can lead to severe
organ dysfunction and death [8]. The complexity of the
inflammatory response has stymied attempts at therapeutic
modulation of acute inflammation. Computational modeling of
complex systems is emerging as an approach to address the
plethora of known and unknown interactions among biologic
pathways [9], including those pathways operant in inflammation
[10]. Recently, we used computational algorithms to assess
multiple circulating inflammatory mediators coupled to dynamic
network analyses to suggest both drivers and markers of
inflammation in the setting of experimental trauma/hemorrhage
in mice [11]. This methodology allowed us to identify unique
cytokine interactions between mice undergoing trauma/hemorrhage compared to those who underwent sham intravenous
cannulation procedure alone [11].
Our goal in the present study was to apply a similar
methodology to PALF. Identification of immune/inflammatory
networks will likely reflect dynamic changes in the inflammatory
response and could lead to opportunities for directed therapeutic
intervention, enhance liver transplant decisions, and improve
patient outcomes.
Materials and Methods
PALF participants
This was a cohort study conducted through the Pediatric Acute
Liver Failure Consortia (PALF; National Institutes of Health/
National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Disease:
5U01 DK072146). Patients less than 18 years of age were eligible
for enrollment into the PALF registry if they met the following
entry criteria: 1) no known evidence of chronic liver disease, 2)
biochemical evidence of acute liver injury, and 3) hepatic-based
coagulopathy (not corrected with vitamin K) defined as a
prothrombin time (PT)$15 seconds or international normalized
ratio (INR)$1.5 in the presence of clinical hepatic encephalopathy
(HE), or a PT$20 seconds or INR$2.0 regardless of the presence
or absence of HE. During the period of this study, the PALF study
group consisted of 22 pediatric sites: 19 centers in the United
States, one in Canada, and two in the United Kingdom. Patient
enrollment began in December 1999. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Boards from all of the participating
institutions, and the NIH provided a Certificate of Confidentiality
to the study (see Materials S1 for full list). Written informed consent
was obtained from the parents or guardians of the children in the
study.
After enrollment into the PALF cohort, demographic and
clinical data were recorded daily for up to seven days. Diagnostic
evaluation and medical management were under the direction of
the attending physician at each participating institution, and were
consistent with the standard of care at each site. A final diagnosis
for the cause of PALF was assigned by the primary physician at
each study site as summarized previously [1]. 21-day outcomes
were recorded as death without transplantation, LTx, or survival
without LTx. A single daily serum sample was scheduled to be
collected with the first morning blood draw following enrollment
and daily for up to seven days, or until death, LTx, or discharge
from hospital. The serum sample was divided into 250 mL or
500 mL aliquots, promptly frozen at -80uC at the enrollment site
and later batch-shipped to the research bio-repository long-term
storage. The frequency and volume of serum that could be
collected for research purposes was dependent upon patient
weight, hemoglobin, and the daily volume of blood required for
diagnosis and patient management. Given these patient safety
restrictions, research samples were not available at all potential
time points for all PALF cohort participants.
A study cohort for this analysis was selected from the PALF
cohort. We identified a convenience sample of participants to serve
as the study cohort. Participants in the study cohort were to have
at least 3 daily samples with at least 100 mL of serum. From those
participants, the study cohort was further prioritized to capture
those with the most samples available between study entry and
outcome, and to recapitulate the diversity of age, diagnosis and
outcome throughout the PALFSG as a whole.
Assays of inflammatory mediators
We chose chemokines, cytokines, and reactive nitrogen oxide
species that serve generally or specifically as biomarkers for various
phases of the complex inflammatory response (see Table S1) :
Cytokines and chemokines (eotaxin, granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interferon [IFN]-a2, IFNc, interleukin [IL]-1b, IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], IL-2,
soluble IL-2 receptor a chain [sIL-2ra], IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-cinducible protein of 10 kDa [IP-10; CXCL10], monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1; CCL2], monokine induced by cinterferon [MIG; CXCL9], macrophage inflammatory protein
[MIP]-1a, MIP-1b, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a) were
assayed using a LuminexTM 100 IS apparatus (LuminexTM,
Austin, TX) using specific beadsets (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The
nitric oxide reaction products NO2
2+NO32 were assayed using
the nitrate reductase method (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI).
Statistical analyses
Patients’ gender and coma grade at enrollment are reported as
percentages. Outcomes are reported at 21 days. Age at enrollment
is reported as medians (25th and 75th percentiles). Pearson chisquare tests were used to test differences in proportions between
those patients in this inflammatory study and those not in this
study, but in the PALF registry cohort. Wilcoxon Rank-sums tests
were used to test for differences in distributions of age between the
two groups. P-values less than 0.05 were used to determine
statistical significance.
Patient-Specific Principal Component Analysis [PCA]
This analysis identified subsets of mediators that most strongly
correlated with the inflammatory response trajectory of an
individual patient using at least 3 samples for each patient. A
PCA score was then calculated for each cytokine as detailed in
Materials S2, summarizing the relative degree to which that
cytokine contributed to the inflammatory response for that patient
over time. The PCA scores were used to group participants using
hierarchical clustering as described below. Resultant patient subgroups were then cross-correlated with clinical outcomes: spontaneous survivor (SS), non-survivor with native liver (NS), or
received LTx (LTx). This method was unbiased in that all the
patients’ data were subjected to PCA independent of outcome
groups.
Hierarchical clustering analysis
This analysis highlighted the natural variability, as well as any
overlap, in inflammatory mediators from among SS, NS, and LTx
PALF participants. The details of this analysis are provided in
Materials S2. The calculation is performed by using the Bioinformatics Toolbox in MatlabH 7.6.0, and the code for this algorithm

and an explanation of its use in the context of experimental
trauma/hemorrhagic shock has been made available publicly [11].
This method is unbiased, and so the segregation of post-PCA data
by hierarchical clustering was likewise unbiased.
Dynamic Bayesian Network analysis
This analysis delineated the connectivity among circulating
inflammatory mediators as a function of time, thereby describing a
possible biomarker signature as well suggesting possible mechanisms by which the progression of the inflammatory response
differs based on patient sub-group. In this analysis, time courses of
unprocessed cytokine measurements (e.g., measurements were not
converted to PCA or to fold change over baseline, or normalized
in any other way) from each experiment were used as input for a
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) inference algorithm, implemented in MatlabH essentially as described previously for gene
array data [12]. A number of leave-one-out inference procedures
were performed on the merged data to obtain a measure of the
robustness of inferred interactions. The details of this analysis are
provided in Materials S2.
Results
PALF participants
There were 986 participants enrolled in PALF at the time of this
analysis. Available samples in the bio-repository were dynamic in
that participants with at least 3 available samples would have
become available or unavailable depending upon new participant
enrollment and withdrawal of samples for other ancillary studies.
We identified 49 PALF participants that met criteria for our
convenience sample. Demographics of the 49 participants
included in this analysis are presented in Table 1. 216 serum
samples were analyzed in 49 participants. All participants had at
least 3 and not more than 7 samples for analysis. The median
number of samples per patient was 4 (25th and 75th percentiles
were 3 and 6, respectively). The number of participants with
samples tested was 18 with 3 samples, 12 with 4, 6 with 5, 7 with 6
and 6 with 7 samples analyzed. 15 participants had available
samples on each day from enrollment to outcome or over 7 days
from enrollment. For the remainder with at least one missing
sample, 3 participants had 4 missing samples, 4 participants had 3
missing samples, 12 participants had 2 missing samples, and 15
participants had only one missing sample.
Variability of circulating inflammatory mediators in PALF
participants
Plotting individual cytokine trajectories grouped by outcome did
not reveal any obvious patterns or characteristic properties. (See
Figs. S1, S2, S3). Hierarchical clustering was then used to
segregate the cytokine data based on similar dynamic patterns to
determine if participants with similar outcomes naturally clustered
together based on their cytokine values, but concluded that
unsupervised clustering of raw cytokine measurements was
incapable of predicting clinical outcomes for these participants
(see Materials S2). Indeed, the time courses of the 26 measured
mediators were highly variable (Fig. 1; Figs. S1, S2, S3), and
standard statistical analyses could not segregate among SS, NS, or
LTx PALF participants (data not shown).
Patient-Specific PCA separates some non-survivors from
survivors and transplanted participants
We next utilized PCA to determine those circulating inflammatory mediators that dominated the overall patient-specific,
time-dependent inflammatory profiles of the study cohort. We
then performed hierarchical clustering on these individual
inflammatory patterns and found that the participants segregated
naturally into seven clusters (Fig. 2A). The first two of these
clusters contained only survivors (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the
inflammatory signature common to the participants in those
clusters might be characteristic, and perhaps predictive, of
spontaneous survival. We note that the PCA and clustering
analyses are both unsupervised methods, and thus the algorithm
was blinded with regard to outcome groups. After the clustering
was performed, cluster assignments were cross-referenced to
outcomes.
Dynamic Bayesian Network analysis segregates PALF
patient sub-groups
The PCA/hierarchical clustering analysis suggested common
inflammatory signatures may be associated with clinical outcomes
in the study cohort. We hypothesized that these inflammatory
patterns could reflect dynamic inflammation networks that identify
key inflammatory mechanisms in PALF. We therefore utilized
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) inference to determine if such
networks could be discerned from the time courses of circulating
inflammatory mediators in PALF participants. Results of this
analysis on each of the three PALF sub-groups are shown in Fig. 3.
Though the data were segregated by outcome group before being
subjected to DBN inference, we note that the algorithm makes no
assumptions about the connectivity of the network in any of the
outcome groups. For SS: the DBN pattern suggested a network
regulated via switching between the chemokines MIG/CXCL9
and IP-10/CXCL10, each of which drives its own expression and
leads to the downstream production of eotaxin, sIL-2ra, MCP-1,

MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and nitric oxide. In contrast, for NS: the DBN
analysis suggested a primary network driven by the self-maintaining behavior of MIG/CXCL9, leading predominantly to the
production of IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide. IP-10/CXCL10 was
still present and driving eotaxin in this DBN, but without
increasing its own production. A separate network consisting of
MCP-1 driving IL-10 was also evident. For LTx: the DBN
suggested a network very similar to that of spontaneous survivors,
namely the apparent MIG/CXCL9 – IP10/CXCL10 switching
with self-sustaining behavior and downstream production of
eotaxin, sIL-2ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, and nitric oxide. To
support the idea that the differences between groups did not arise
by chance, we repeated the DBN analysis on a random grouping
of the data and observed that the networks contained no major
differences, with the core module of IP10/CXCL10 and MIG/
CXCL9 cross-regulation and self-feedback being retained in all
networks (Fig. S4)
Discussion
The search for biomarkers in liver diseases has been fraught
with difficulty. Putative biomarkers identified in small studies are
often not sufficiently disease-specific, not tied mechanistically to a
given disease, and non-reproducible in larger studies. Even those
that are reproducible are frequently limited in their value to the
most severe or advanced stages of disease [13–15]. Recent studies
have emphasized the need for studying multiple inflammatory
biomarkers combined with informatics/computational techniques
as a key part of the interpretation of biomarker data [16–19]. This
pilot study examines the use of novel analytic methods that may
account for the dynamic complexity of the inflammatory response
in PALF.
Analysis of raw circulating inflammatory mediator data in a
convenience sample of PALF participants demonstrated a high
degree of patient-to-patient variability. In contrast, when data
underwent patient-specific PCA followed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering in a blinded fashion, seven distinct patient clusters
were identified and some clusters contained only spontaneous
survivors and LTx. This suggests that dynamic aspects of
inflammation may be associated with patient-specific clinical
outcomes. Finally, using DBN inference, cytokine networks
associated with SS differed from those associated with NS. The
cytokine network associated with LTx had characteristics more
similar to SS than NS.
In a previous study on experimental trauma/hemorrhagic shock
in genetically identical mice, we observed a high degree of
variability in the raw circulating mediator data, but could identify
distinct principal inflammatory drivers in animals receiving
hemorrhagic shock from those subjected to sham cannulation
[11]. In the present study, we affirm that the inflammatory
response of a diverse cohort of PALF participants is highly variable
[20–22] and that PCA could segregate inflammation patterns
associated with different outcomes.
The inflammatory response can take two potential paths: (1)
resolvable inflammation, in which the initial inflammatory
response is harnessed by negative feedback that drives resolution,
healing, and regeneration; or (2) unresolvable inflammation, which
occurs when negative feedback is insufficient, a positive feedback
loop of inflammation goes unchecked, and inflammation begets
cellular damage and destruction which begets further inflammation [10,23–27]. Positive and negative inflammatory feedback with
regard to ultimate health status of the patient might be mapped
onto pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in some contexts, but
not in others. Furthermore, any given mediator could serve a proor anti-inflammatory role at a given time or under given
conditions. Thus, using data-driven models to suggest the time
and context-dependent role of cytokines may be more informative
than relying on an analysis with static, pre-assigned roles for
cytokines. In a prior study, our data suggested that IP-10/

CXCL10 initiates a low-level, resolvable inflammatory response in
mice subjected to minor trauma alone. In contrast, MIG/CXCL9
drives a more robust and potentially unresolvable inflammatory
response in the setting of the same minor trauma+hemorrhagic
shock [11].
Several studies have demonstrated that both MIG/CXCL9 and
IP-10/CXCL10 mRNA are elevated in experimental models of
liver failure [28,29], and circulating levels of both chemokines are
implicated in chronic hepatitis C [30]. Importantly, and supporting our hypothesis that IP-10/CXCL10 may drive a resolvable
inflammatory response in PALF, Bone-Larson et al demonstrated
that IP-10/CXCL10 is hepatoprotective in an experimental model
of acute liver injury [29]. Both MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/
CXCL10 are also associated with IFN-c signaling, a pathway
that also influences liver regeneration.
Based upon these preliminary studies, we hypothesized that if
IP-10/CXCL10 is stimulated initially, then this chemokine would
both drive its own production and suppress that of MIG/CXCL9
and lead to self-resolving inflammation. In contrast, if MIG/
CXCL9 is stimulated initially, then MIG/CXCL9 would drive its
own production while suppressing that of IP-10/CXCL10, in turn
leading to self-maintaining, or unresolvable inflammation. Based
on DBN analysis, we found what we suspect to be a pattern of
resolvable inflammation associated with SS and unresolvable
inflammation associated with NS in our selected PALF cohort.
Specifically, we find PALF SS and LTx participant’s exhibit
chemokines MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10, each of which
exhibits feedback behavior and each of which appears to
regulate the other. This chemokine switching network appears
to drive a diverse inflammatory response that includes eotaxin,
sIL-2ra, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and nitric oxide (in
spontaneous survivors) or eotaxin, sIL-2ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP1, and nitric oxide (LTx recipients). Accordingly, we interpret
the inflammation networks in PALF SS and LTx participants as
demonstrating the possibility of switching between inflammatory
responses driven by IP-10/CXCL10 vs. inflammation driven by
MIG/CXCL9, and ultimately manifesting in a pattern of
resolvable inflammation. In contrast, PALF NS participants
exhibited an inflammation network that suggests feedback
behavior for MIG/CXCL9 but not for IP-10/CXCL10, driving

the production of IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide and resulting in
unresolvable inflammation.
There are several limitations to our study. This was a
retrospective study, and the identified networks were not validated
in a separate cohort of participants. The study cohort, as well as
sampling time points, was heterogeneous, though the participants
in the study cohort were representative of the larger PALF Study
Group cohort, and the time frame of sampling was restricted to 7
days post-enrollment. Only a subset of inflammatory mediators
was assayed, and, importantly, damage-associated molecular
pattern molecules (e.g. HMGB1) were not assessed.
In conclusion, the present study suggests that the DBN-defined
inflammatory networks might serve as powerful, new biomarkers
for predicting outcomes in PALF, which represents a novel use of
DBN inference methodology. These findings will be validated in a
larger patient cohort with sampling time points extending to the
outcome of death, discharge, or LTx if that outcome was beyond
seven days. Despite a heterogeneous inflammatory response in
individual PALF participants, our studies suggest a network-based
analysis may have the potential to segregate spontaneous survivors
and non-survivors with LTx recipients having a biomarker pattern
more similar to spontaneous survivors than those of non-survivors.
Our data also leave open the possibility that these chemokinebased, feedback-driven inflammatory switching mechanisms might
actually mediate such outcomes. This consideration, in turn,
suggests that it might be possible to identify subsets of PALF
patients in whom specific immune-modulatory therapy might
improve the likelihood of spontaneous survival.
