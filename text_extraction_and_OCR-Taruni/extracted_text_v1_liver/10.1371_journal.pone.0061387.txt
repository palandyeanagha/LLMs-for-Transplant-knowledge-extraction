Abstract
Background and Objectives: Recent studies have supported a role for both newer and more established vitamin D
compounds in improving proteinuria, although systematic evaluation is lacking. Furthermore, concerns remain regarding
the influence of vitamin D on the progression of renal function. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in nondialysis patients and compared the use of newer versus established vitamin D compounds by performing a meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials.
Design: A literature search of PubMed (1975 to September, 2012), EMBASE.com (1966 to September, 2012) and Ovid EBM
Reviews (through September, 2012) was conducted.
Results: Eighteen studies were eligible for final inclusion; of these, six explored the effects of vitamin D on proteinuria,
twelve studied the effects of supplementation on renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of hypercalcemia.
Compared to the placebo or no interference, both the newer and established vitamin D sterols reduced proteinuria to a
similar extent (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.81). No decrease in the glomerular filter rate was observed (SMD, 20.10; 95%CI,
20.24 to 0.03), and the risk for dialysis initiation was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.54 to 4.03) with vitamin D treatment. Additionally, there
was an increased risk of hypercalcemia for patients treated with either newer or established vitamin D compounds as
compared with the controls (RR, 4.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 10.37). The head-to-head studies showed no differences in the effects
of either newer or established compounds on proteinuria or the risk of hypercalcemia. No serious adverse events were
associated with the administration of vitamin D.
Conclusions: Vitamin D therapy appears to decrease proteinuria and have no negative influence on renal function in nondialysis patients. But the occurrence of hypercalcemia should be evaluated when vitamin D is provided. No superiority for
newer versus established vitamin D analogue is found.

Introduction
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) imposes significant health and
economic burdens on both individuals and communities [1].
Microalbuminuria is one of the earliest clinical manifestations of
nephropathy and is associated with substantial risk for progressive
kidney disease. Additionally, albuminuria predicts cardiovascular
events, all-cause mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart
failure [2]. Recent data have shown that increased proteinuria and
decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) serve as independent
predictors of all-cause mortality [3,4]. Thus, reducing proteinuria
and protecting kidney function at the disease stages prior to
dialysis are pivotal for preventing long-term kidney loss and other
adverse events.
Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors can reduce proteinuria and delay kidney dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), but are unsuitable for those with advanced renal
dysfunction due to the potential for renal deterioration and
hyperkalemia. The exploration of other therapeutic modalities is
urgently needed for CKD treatment. Although animal experiments have revealed that vitamin D can reduce proteinuria [5],
the majority of existing clinical data have focused on the effect of
vitamin D on mineral metabolism and bone diseases related to
secondary hyperparathyroidism. Of the limited clinical studies that
have explored extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D, the VITAL trial
(selective vitamin D receptor activation with paricalcitol for the
reduction of albuminuria), a well-designed and relatively largescale study, has shown promising but borderline significant results
concerning albuminuria improvement [6]. In addition, it remains
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387

unclear whether vitamin D treatment may harm renal function.
Vitamin D therapy has been widely used in the management of
CKD, traditionally in the form of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2),
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), calcitriol (1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3)
and alfacalcidol (1a- hydroxyvitamin D3). However, the newer
vitamin D analogues, including paricalcitol, doxercalciferol, 22-
oxacalcitriol and falecalcitriol, play an increasingly important role
in CKD treatment based on the experimental results of similar or
better suppression of parathyroid hormone and possibly less
calcemic effect compared with established vitamin D sterols [7].
While it is still uncertain whether newer compounds are superior
to the established ones in terms of albuminuria improvement,
renal function protection, hypercalcemia and other side effects
reduction. The different forms of vitamin D compounds were
listed in Table 1.
Given the fact that vitamin D is generally deficient and
metabolically disordered in patients with CKD [8,9], supplementation of vitamin D may be significant throughout CKD evolution,
especially at early and moderate stages. To our knowledge, few
comprehensive meta-analyses and systematic reviews have explored the influence of vitamin D on proteinuria and the
progression of CKD in non-dialysis patients or compared
treatments between newer and more established sterols. In this
regard, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify these issues, and
we also evaluated hypercalcemia and other adverse events. The
protocol of this analysis is available in File S1 and the search
strategies are listed in File S2.
Design and Methods
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria
Data from randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that
included patients receiving vitamin D in the study group and
patients receiving placebo or no medications as controls were
eligible for analysis. RCTs that compared newer and established
vitamin D analogues were also included. Subjects who suffered
from CKD should have no need for dialysis or renal transplantation at baseline. We considered the parameters of albuminuria,
GFR, the risk of hypercalcemia and other adverse effects in these
trials. The exclusion criteria consisted of incomplete relevant
parameters required for our analysis, as unobtainable from the
respective author and unable to be analyzed by statistical methods.
No restriction was set for language, publishing year or country to
maximize the extent of the searches.
Data search strategies
We performed literature searches of PubMed (1975 to
September, 2012), EMBASE.com (1966 to September, 2012)
and OvidSP (through September, 2012) for the key words
‘‘vitamin d’’ or ‘‘vitamin d2’’ or ‘‘vitamin d3’’ or ‘‘calciferol’’ or
‘‘calcitriol’’ and ‘‘kidney disease’’ or ‘‘nephropathy’’ with the
limitation of ‘‘controlled clinical trial’’. Detailed data search
strategies are given in File S2. Google Scholar was searched as a
complementary measure for full-text articles. The EMBASE.com
database is composed of Embase (from 1974) and majority of data
from Medline (from 1966). OvidSP contains seven sub-databases
including the Cochrane Library. Abstracts presented at meetings
of the American Society of Nephrology, National Kidney
Foundation, World Congress of Nephrology, American Diabetes
Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes and
International Diabetes Federation in recent years were searched
for additional studies. We used the Endnote X4 program for
literature management and selection.
Data extracted
The following information was summarized by using a
predefined data collection form: title, the first author’s name,
country, mean age, year of publication, drug dosage, controls and
causes of CKD. For binary outcomes, the number of cases and
controls was recorded. For continuous data, the numbers, mean
values and standard deviations of changes from baseline in the
study group and the control group were recorded. If the 95%
confidence interval was provided instead of the standard deviation,
the standard deviation was calculated based on the equation
provided in Cochrane Handbook. If the baseline and final
standard deviations were given and the changes in the standard
deviations were unknown, the correlation coefficient method
advised by Follmann was used to calculate the values [10].
Two reviewers (Dr. LJX and Dr. XSW) screened the search
results based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The two
reviewers independently extracted useful data from the selected
trials. When it was considered desirable and potentially useful, we
contacted the investigators for additional information. DiscrepanTable 1. Vitamin D and derivatives.

cies between the two reviewers were arbitrated by Professor YBL.
Relevant missing data were sought by contacting the original
author of the respective study.
The following parameters were accumulated: 1) albuminuria
improvement (the numbers of patients who had a proteinuria
reduction after treatment were recorded, according to the urine
albumin/creatine ratio or 24-hour urine protein excretion); 2)
GFR changes (GFR was calculated according to the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, the Cockcroft-Gault
method, estimations of the continuous infusion of iothalamate, or
predictions of the creatinine clearance rate (CCR) in the original
trials, and differences in GFR changes were compared between
the study and control groups); 3) incidence of hypercalcemia
(hypercalcemia was defined as concentrations of serum calcium
above 2.54,2.80 mmol/L (10.2,11.2 mg/dL)); and 4) adverse
events (all adverse events except for hypercalcemia were summarized in our analysis).
Study quality assessment
We used Revman 5.1 software (the Cochrane Collaboration,
Copenhagen, Denmark) to evaluate the study quality. Two
reviewers (Dr. LJX and Dr. FFZ) conducted these assessments
independently, and disagreements were resolved through discussion between the two reviewers. The evaluation criteria consisted
of the following: 1) random sequence generation; 2) allocation
concealment; 3) blinding of participants and personnel; 4) blinding
of outcome assessment; 5) incomplete outcome data; 6) selective
reporting; and 7) other bias.
Statistical analysis
Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were presented to compare the measurement data
changes. SMD was used as a summary statistic in our analysis
because the data for GFR conformed to the normal distribution;
however, the measurement methods varied, and it was necessary
to standardize the results to a uniform scale before they could be
combined. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratios (RR)
and 95% CI. In our analysis, the numbers of patients with
proteinuria reduction, renal deterioration, hypercalcemia and
other events were considered dichotomous data. Heterogeneity
was analyzed using a x-squared test on n-1 degrees of freedom,
with a = 0.05 used for statistical significance and I2 for the degree
of heterogeneity. Values of I2 less than 25% indicated low
heterogeneity, values near 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity,
and those above 75% represented high heterogeneity. An I2
value.50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity.
Subgroup analyses were then conducted based on year of the
study, study participants, age of participants, design, interventions,
and others, and careful consideration was given to the appropriateness of the meta-analysis. If the I2 value was .25% or the
results of an analysis clearly differed from those of other studies, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the
outcomes.

Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger’s test.
Both random-effect and fixed-effect models were used to pool the
data, and the two models yielded mainly identical results in our
analysis. The results were presented from the random-effect
model. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software
(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).
Results
We identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4
abstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,
2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from
Embase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was
performed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were
removed, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual
screening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of
relevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were
reported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate
information as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors
regarding the incomplete or vague data available in their
published works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only
one provided additional information that we needed. Three fulltext articles were identified from the databases we listed above but
downloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published
studies [6,11–27] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows
the study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.
Trial characteristics
A total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with
CKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplantation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged
from 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials
explored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated
changes in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of
hypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two
other studies compared the effects of newer versus more
established vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients
(Table 2).
Study quality
Most trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random
sequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).
Allocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).
Blinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials
(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of
18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided
incompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was
found in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources
of bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to
declarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial
source of the funding.
Outcome measurement
Proteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of
vitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of
these studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other
two evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled
data indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis
patients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81). The RR associated with
the newer vitamin D sterol was 1.67 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.29) and
that for the established compound was 2.76 (95%CI, 1.60 to 4.74)
(Figure 2). The subgroup analysis showed no difference between
the newer vitamin D sterol and the established one (P = 0.14). We

also reviewed a study that compared the impact of the newer
vitamin D analogue versus the established compound on
proteinuria. To our regret, this original article did not provide
concrete data, although it suggested that there was no difference
between the newer compound and the established one [26].
GFR: Twelve RCTs (1124 patients) evaluated the effect of
vitamin D therapy on GFR. After treatment, the changes in GFR
were not different (20.10, 95%CI: 20.24 to 0.03) between the
study group and the control group. Advanced analysis indicated
that neither established analogues such as calcitriol and alfacalcidol (20.14, 95%CI 20.32 to 0.03) nor newer analogues such as
paricalcitol and doxercalciferol (20.03, 95%CI 20.33 to 0.26) led
to deteriorations in renal function. The subgroup analysis showed
no difference between the newer vitamin D sterol and the
established one (P = 0.23). No head-to-head study was obtained
from the database searches that compared the effect of newer
vitamin D analogues versus established compounds on GFR in
non-dialysis patients (Figure 3A).
Four RCTs (730 patients) listed the numbers of patients who
progressed to terminal renal failure and required dialysis. One of
these trials evaluated the established vitamin D sterol, and the
other three evaluated the newer compound. Neither the established compound (RR. 3.00; 95%CI, 0.81 to 11.05) nor the newer
compound (RR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.32 to 1.89) was indicated to
increase the risk of renal deterioration (pooled RR, 1.48; 95%CI,
0.54 to 4.03) (Figure 3B).
Incidence of hypercalcemia: Regarding the occurrence of
hypercalcemia, thirteen RCTs (1378 patients) compared the
newer vitamin D sterol or the established compound with placebo
treatment or no medication, and two RCTs compared the newer
compound with the established compound. The risk of hypercalcemia was clearly higher in patients given vitamin D therapy as
compared with those given the placebo or no medication (RR,
4.78; 95%CI, 2.20 to 10.37). The RR associated with the newer
vitamin D compounds was 6.16 (95%CI, 1.57 to 24.17), and that
associated with the established compounds was 3.90 (95%CI, 1.43
to 10.66). No difference was discovered between the newer
compounds and the established compounds based on the original
head-to-head studies (pooled RR, 1.56; 95%CI, 0.27 to 9.17)
(Figure 4).
Other events (a total of 9 RCTs, 1221 patients): The pooled
results showed no differences regarding the risk of death (Figure 5),
pre-mature withdrawal (Figure 6), adverse events (Figure 7A) or
serious adverse events (Figure 7B) in patients given vitamin D
therapy as compare to those given the placebo or no medication.
No superiority was found for either treatment with the newer
vitamin D compounds or the established compounds. The reasons
for patient withdrawal included serious adverse events, such as

progression to dialysis or cardiac events including congestive heart
failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure
secondary to heart failure and pericardial effusion, pneumonia,
stroke, and mortality, or loss of contact. Side effects that might
have been unrelated to vitamin D treatment included gastrointestinal disturbances, pseudogout, upper respiratory tract infection,
cough, constipation, urinary tract infection, paronychia, diarrhea,
and others. In addition, two subjects had slightly raised hepatase
levels and mild anaphylaxis potentially related to vitamin D
therapy (Table 3).
Heterogeneity and publication bias
Low to moderate heterogeneity was demonstrated in our
analysis. The index I2 value from RCTs analyzing proteinuria
was 39.9% (P = 0.14), that related to GFR was 21.4% (P = 0.23),
and that for hypercalcemia was very low (0.0%, P = 0.74).
However, the index I2 value from RCTs analyzing the risk for
premature withdrawal was 52.9% (P = 0.04), and we explored
potential reasons for this heterogeneity in the risk for premature
withdrawals by subgroup analysis. We found that year of the study
was a significant effect modifier and may have accounted for the
heterogeneity in the premature withdrawal analysis (Table 4).

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387

The sensitivity analysis of trials exploring proteinuria and
premature withdrawal showed a high level of robustness, and trials
evaluating GFR in relation to treatment with newer vitamin D
compounds showed a low level of sensitivity. The funnel plots and
sensitivity analysis results can be found in Figure S1 and Figure S2,
S3, S4 for detail. Publication bias was not detected for studies
concerning GFR and for those evaluating hypercalcemia (for
Egger’s test, P = 0.45 and 0.80, respectively; Figure S1). Studies
that evaluated proteinuria, mortality, premature withdrawal, and
adverse effects were inadequate for the assessment of publication
bias.
Discussion
We performed a meta-analysis of available published studies to
explore the effects of vitamin D therapy in non-dialysis patients
and drew the conclusion that both newer vitamin D analogues and
established compounds significantly reduced proteinuria in these
patients. Although the clinical practice guidelines of KDIGO
(Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) have recommended vitamin D supplementation in patients with CKD mainly
for treating mineral and bone disorders related to secondary
hyperparathyroidism, recent clinical studies and experimental
animal data have confirmed that the effects of vitamin D extend
beyond mineral metabolism [6,28–33].
Tian et al. reviewed the benefits of vitamin D therapy, which
include immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, vascular effects, regulation of the RAS and certain effects on glucose
metabolism [28]. In animal studies, vitamin D monotherapy
obtained an equivalent effect on proteinuria as compared to ARB
and double benefits when combined with ARB [5]. Furthermore,
in a large cohort evaluated for the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a stepwise rise in
the prevalence of albuminuria was reported with vitamin D
insufficiency [29]. All the above suggested a potential intrinsic
anti-proteinuric property of vitamin D.

Vitamin D in Non-Dialysis Patients
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387

With the development of dialysis techniques and kidney
transplant operations for patients with ESRD, patient lifespan
has been significantly extended, but quality of patient life has
declined and costs have sharply increased. Controlling proteinuria
at early stages and preserving residual renal function are no doubt
significant; however, it should be noted that in 1978, a study
published in the Lancet magazine reported that 18 subjects with
advanced CKD demonstrated deteriorated renal function after
vitamin D treatment [34]. But this conclusion was questioned due
to the small sample size and short study duration, and the result
was not supported by subsequent trials.
In our analysis, vitamin D therapy was not found to damage
renal function, although it was also clear that vitamin D failed to
improve GFR. This was surprising because decreases in albuminuria were not associated with kidney function improvement. One
potential reason for this disparity may have been differences
between trials in terms of study subjects. Furthermore, several risk
factors (with the exception of proteinuria) are shown to correlate
with the deterioration of renal function. Besides, studies have also

indicated that renal impairments occur in the absence of
albuminuria in some patients with diabetes, despite the classic
histological features of diabetic nephropathy [35–37]. Although
proteinuria improvement and renal function protection do not
occur in parallel after vitamin D therapy in our analysis, series of
studies [38–42] have invariably inferred that albuminuria reduction is important for future renal outcomes.
The development of hypercalcemia is a potential hazard related
to vitamin D therapy. Although negative results were reported in
specific RCTs, the pooled results indicated an increased probability of hypercalcemia after vitamin D therapy. This result is
consistent with other meta-analyses that evaluated patients at all
CKD stages [43], and these findings indicate that serum calcium
concentrations should be clinically monitored when CKD patients
are taking vitamin D supplements.
In this analysis, we obtained no evidence of superiority for either
the newer vitamin D compounds or the established compounds in
terms of their impact on proteinuria, renal function, hypercalcemia or other events.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to
evaluate randomized trials exploring the effects of vitamin D
compounds on renal function in non-dialysis-dependent CKD
patients. However, our analysis and, in some cases, the materials
contributing to our analysis have limitations. Most of the trials
evaluated were short-term, generally lasting no more than 2 years,
which means that clinical outcomes, such as all-cause death and
the occurrence of cardiovascular events, may not reflect the
intrinsic effect of vitamin D therapy. Furthermore, randomized
clinical trials investigating the effects of vitamin D on proteinuria
were limited in number, and publication bias, although inadequate
to be assessed in our analysis, may exist and could have affected
the results.

Vitamin D in Non-Dialysis Patients

In summary, vitamin D therapy appears to decrease proteinuria
and have no negative influence on renal function in non-dialysis
patients. Thus, this treatment appears to be safe for CKD
treatment, but the occurrence of hypercalcemia should be
evaluated when vitamin D is provided. Furthermore, no superiority for newer versus established vitamin D analogues is found in
non-dialysis patients, which implies that other factors such as
expense or availability should be the first consideration for patients
and practitioners.
