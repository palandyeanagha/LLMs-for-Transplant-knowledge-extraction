Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The immune-rich contexture of the
HCC microenvironment makes this tumour an appealing target for immune-based therapies. Here, we discuss how the
functional characteristics of the liver microenvironment can potentially be harnessed for the treatment of HCC. We will
review the evidence supporting a therapeutic role for vaccines, cell-based therapies and immune-checkpoint inhibitors and
discuss the potential for patient stratification in an attempt to overcome the series of failures that has characterised drug
development in this disease area.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prototypical
inflammation-driven cancer arising on the backdrop of liver
cirrhosis. Whilst the epidemiology of chronic liver disease
is changing from a largely hepatitis virus B (HBV) or C
(HCV) driven landscape to a predominantly metabolic one,
with non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) rapidly
increasing in prevalence [1], tumour-promoting inflammation remains the common denominator that characterises the
pathogenesis of HCC across aetiologies.
The high lethality of HCC, a cancer of increasing incidence [2], stems from late-stage presentation and high
prevalence of concomitant liver dysfunction [3]. Curative
approaches (liver resection, ablation) in early-stage HCC
are affected by high recurrence rates [4] and transplantation
is feasible only within rigorous oncological criteria [5]. As
cancer and liver dysfunction progress, loco-regional and
systemic therapy may improve patients’ survival. Whilst
significant survival benefit is now achievable with optimal
treatment sequencing [6], all patients within Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer intermediate and advanced stages will
inevitably die of HCC.
After decades of failures and scepticism over the
potential for immune-based therapies to produce clinically
meaningful disease-modulating effects, the systemic management of cancer has been recently revolutionised by the
advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI), a therapeutic class of monoclonal antibodies that can effectively
induce tumour immune-rejection by targeting key coinhibitory signals within the cancer-immunity interface.
Over the past decade, anti-cancer immunotherapy with
inhibitors of the programmed cell-death 1 receptor or ligand
1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and Cytotoxic T-cell antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
has swiftly become standard of care across a wide range of
previously untreatable malignancies including non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and many others. The
strong immune-mediated pathogenesis of HCC makes this
tumour particularly appealing for immune-based therapies.
However, the complex functional characteristics of the
HCC tumour microenvironment (TME) highlight the presence of multiple non-redundant mechanisms of cancer
immune-suppression, which synergise in defining a high
barrier of resistance to immunotherapy. By the time HCC is
diagnosed, the various functional segments of the host’s

immunity are strongly geared towards immune-suppression
by un-resolved pro-inflammatory stimuli that accompany
liver fibrogenesis through a process now recognised as
immuno-editing [7].
In the specific context of HCC, anti-tumour immune
reconstitution with ICPIs has produced initial enthusiasm
based on preliminary results from single-arm studies [8, 9],
suggesting evidence of anti-tumour activity. With immunotherapy rapidly expanding as a novel option in the treatment landscape of HCC [10], we discuss the rationale for the
development of immune-based therapies in liver cancer and
review the basic immune-biologic mechanism that underlie
the progression of HCC and might be exploited for therapy.
Molecular mechanisms of hepatic immune
tolerogenesis
Sitting at the functional junction between portal and arterial
inflow, the liver constitutes a primary anatomical site of
immune recognition, facilitated by the low pressure, low
flow sinusoidal architecture capable of exposing potential
pathogens to the largest reticulo-endothelial system present
in the human body [11].
To protect the liver parenchyma from unopposed tissue
injury, several mechanisms contribute to naturally prevent
unwanted immune responses generated from exposure to
microbial antigens and conserved molecular motifs known as
danger- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs/
PAMPs), making the liver a largely immune-suppressive
microenvironment. The functional heterogeneity of the liver
immune microenvironment is evidenced by the multifaceted
nature of stromal cells including liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver resident
macrophages or Kupffer cells (KCs) as well as numerous
functional segments of the adaptive immune response
including CD4+, CD8+ T-lymphocytes and NK cells [12].
LSECs are endowed with antigen-presenting capacity,
being able to activate antigen specific CD4+ T-cell
responses [13]. LSECs modulate immune cell recruitment
through specific integrins (αLβ2, α4β1, α4β7) that facilitate
capture, firm lymphocyte adhesion and subsequent chemotaxis mediated by pathways such as CXCL9-11/CXCR3,
CXCL16/CXCR6 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 [14]. In response
to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the prototypical PAMP molecule, the antigen-presentation capacity of LSECs is dampened by downregulation of constitutively expressed Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II, CD80 and
CD86 molecules [15]. Key driver of this immunetolerogenic state is the relative abundance of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), two
immune-suppressive mediators produced by KC and LSECs
in response to chronic LPS exposure.
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), another key
immunosuppressive cytokine involved in liver regeneration,
inflammation and fibrosis [16], is also abundant within the
liver immune microenvironment and through its complex
signalling and pleiotropic functional role exerts a tolerogenic effect [17].
HSCs heavily secrete TGF-β, which yields profibrogenic and anti-proliferative properties [18]. Activated
HSCs contribute to liver tolerogenesis by inhibiting lymphocyte infiltration, inducing PD-L1 expression and facilitate recruitment [19] and functional differentiation of
T-regs when naïve CD4+ cells are recruited to professional
DCs [20]. HSCs can also prevent the activation CD8+ Tcells through a CD54-mediated mechanism by reducing IL2/IL-2R T-cell signalling [21] and facilitate the generation
of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [22] suggesting their prominence as immune-regulatory cells despite the
fairly limited capacity of functioning as APCs [23].
Alongside LSECs and HSCs, KCs contribute to the liver
immune microenvironment as non-migratory liver resident
macrophages sitting at the sinusoidal interface with a high
phenotypic plasticity in response to danger signals [24].
KCs respond to damage via expression of a vast repertoire
of toll-like receptors, scavenger receptors as well as complement and Fc-gamma receptors [25]. In homoeostatic
conditions, KC-mediated antigen presentation promotes
tolerogenic immunity by attenuation of CD4+ T-cell
responses, and T-reg expansion [26]. In response to LPS,
KCs polarise the liver sinusoidal microenvironment towards
immune-suppression by IL-6 downregulation and IL-10
release [27]. Mechanistic evidence produced to date suggests tolerance to be a key trait in liver immune homoeostasis (Fig. 1) [28].
Immune-mediated mechanisms in the
pathogenesis and progression of HCC
T-cells
It has been long time recognised that increased Tlymphocyte infiltrate is associated with improved overall
and progression free survival in HCC [29]. However,
despite T-cell infiltration tumours ultimately progress and
metastasise as a result of the ‘exhaustion’ of proinflammatory T-cell populations and accumulation of regulatory T-lymphocytes [30–32]. Cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells
(CTLs) are a critical component of anti-tumour immunity in
HCC and harbinger of favourable prognosis [33]. CTLs
initiate T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated, antigen-dependent
cytotoxicity against tumours, being capable of directly
inducing cell death via membrane-bound FAS-ligand and
inhibit tumour proliferation via IFN-γ secretion [7]. CD4+
Immune-based therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma 3621

T-helper cells are an integral part of anti-tumour immunity:
when activated in the presence of dendritic cell derived
type-1 interferon and IL-12, they produce a number of proinflammatory (‘TH1’) cytokines, which promote CTL proliferation and thus anti-tumour immunity [34]. Overexpression of TH1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-1α, IL-1β) is
associated with favourable prognosis [35].
T-cell exhaustion is characterised by impaired proinflammatory responses upon stimulation, reduced cytokine production, impaired proliferation and reduced cytotoxicity. Such phenotype is hallmarked by over-expression
of co-inhibitory receptors including CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3
and TIM-3. Evidence of intra-tumoural and circulating of
exhausted CD8+ T-cells is documented as a poor prognostic trait in HCC [36, 37].
Exhaustion within the TME is multifactorial and dominated by a cytokine milieu rich in IL-10 and TGF-β that
prohibits activation of CTLs and TH1 CD4+ T-cells
[38, 39]. Single cell analysis of TCR sequences has
recently confirmed clonal expansion of exhausted CD8+ Tcell clusters in HCC, indicating that CTL clones expand
within the tumour after infiltration and become exhausted
[40]. Novel transcriptional regulators of T-cell exhaustion
are being increasingly appreciated including TOX, a transcription factor heavily overexpressed in CD8+ TILs that
suppresses effector and memory function [41].
The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is a key actionable driver of
immune-exhaustion in HCC, and works by suppression of
T-cell receptor signalling via the PI3K/AKT pathway,
ultimately inhibiting T-cell survival and growth [42, 43].
High expression of PD-1 [36] and PD-L1 is generally
associated with poor prognosis in HCC [44–46] where PD-1
over-expressing TILs can restore their effector function
following PD-1 blockade [47]. Alongside PD-1/PD-L1, a
growing number of inhibitory pathways has been identified
to target anti-tumour CTL function.
CTLA-4 is a well described inhibitory receptor, which is
upregulated after T-cell activation and is thought to act by
competitively antagonising CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory
molecules and by downstream inhibition of AKT [48].
TIM-3 is expressed on CD4+, CD8+ TILs and intratumoural T-regs in HCC, co-localising with its ligand
Galectin-9 expressed on APCs. TIM-3 expression leads to
reduced CTL capacity [49–51] and higher circulating TIM3 concentration is associated with HCC susceptibility in
HBV-carriers [52].
Other drivers of T-cell exhaustion in HCC include LAG3, associated to hypofunctional CD8+ responses in HCC
TILs, which can be reversed upon LAG-3 blockade [53]
and B and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), seen in >50%
of PD-1+ TILs in HCC and denoting particularly pronounced hypo-functionality [54] and T-cell exclusion [55].
Regulatory T-lymphocytes
Regulatory T-cells (T-reg) are CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3
+immune-suppressive T-cells whose accumulation in HCC
is associated with disease progression [56] and reduced

survival [31, 57]. They are recruited intratumorally via
CCL17/CCL22 secretion by tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) [58, 59]. In addition, T-reg differentiation is
promoted by the production of TGF-β, IL-10 and other
mediators including COX-2 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by stromal and tumour cells [60].
T-regs impair antigen presentation by down-regulating
DC expression of CD80 and CD86 [61]. They can directly
hamper the cytotoxic capacity of CTLs through the production of suppressive cytokines including TGF-β and
IL-10 and by competing for and antagonising the effect of
IL-2. T-regs can also directly lyse antigen presenting cells
via granzyme-mediated cytolysis and crucially express high
amounts of the inhibitory signalling molecules mentioned
above [62]. Circulating T-regs correlate negatively with
survival in HCC [63].
Other suppressive lymphocyte populations have been
characterised in the HCC TME.
TH2 CD4+ T-helper cells, generated when activation
occurs in the presence of IL-10 derived from intra-tumoural
myeloid cells, exert CTL-inhibitory functions [64]. IL-10 is
also produced by another regulatory T-cell population,
Tr1 cells. These are induced in HCC by interaction with
plasmacytoid dendritic cells via ligation of ICOS [65].
Increased expression of TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL10) is associated with disease progression and metastasis in
HCC [35] as a likely consequence of IL-4-mediated
recruitment of TAM, which in turn secrete TGF-β and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [35]. IL-17
producing TH17 subsets have also been reported in HCC.
TH17 intratumoural density leads to poor survival through
the fostering of angiogenesis [66].
Circulating TH17 cells in HCC can suppress autologous
anti-tumour CTL responses when co-cultured in vitro [67]
and are increased in more advanced disease [68].
NK cells
NK cells are innate lymphoid cells that constitute ~30% of
liver resident lymphocytes—in sharp contrast with the
lower frequency of peripheral blood NK cells (range
5–15%) [69]. NK cells represent a homogeneous population
identified by the abundance of specific cell surface receptors
(CD56, CD16). Liver resident NK cells (lrNK) are mostly
CD56bright CD16dim that reside in the thin-walled sinusoids
along Kupffer cells, NKT and T-cells in a CCR5 and
CXCR6 dependent manner [70, 71]. NK cell tolerance in
steady-state liver is ensured by the presence of inhibitory
receptors for self MHC-I molecules, mainly killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and CD94/NKG2A
[72]. Conventional circulating NK cells (CD56dim
CD16bright) are being recruited to the inflamed liver and,
along lrNK cells, are activated by cytokines such as IL-2,
IL-12, IL-18, IL-15 secreted by hepatocytes and Kupffer
cells [73]. Upon activation, NK cells operate rapidly,
without the requirement for antigen presentation, by producing cytokines (mainly IFN-γ, TNF-α), chemokines and
triggering target cell apoptosis via death-inducing molecules—the FAS receptor and the TNF-Related Apoptosis
Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)—and via the release of cytotoxic
granules [74].
NK cell activation relies on germ-line encoded stimulatory receptors triggered by self-ligands, viral antigens or
stress-induced ligands, rapidly induced in virus infected
cells and tumour cells [75]. The C-type lectin-like receptor
Natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) is a potent antitumour mediator expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T-cells, γδ
T-cells and invariant NKT cells [76]. Human NKG2D binds
to highly polymorphic ligands called MHC class-I chainrelated protein A and B, unique long 16 (UL-16)-binding
proteins. High level of NKG2D receptor and/or NKG2D
ligands have been reported in chronic liver diseases associated with metabolic disorders [77], HCV/HBV infection
[78, 79] and in HCC [80, 81].
Other stimulatory receptors include the natural cytotoxic
receptors (NCR) NKp46, NKp30 and NKp44; the FcɣRIII
(CD16) that mediates antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
against IgG-coated target cells, and co-stimulatory molecule
such as the DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1) triggered by adhesion molecules of the Nectin/Nectin-like
(Necl) family (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Necl also interact with
two inhibitory receptors CD96 on NK cells and the T-cell
immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) on NK and
CD8+ T-cells, which simultaneously prevents DNAM-1
co-stimulation, leading to reduced NK functionality [82].
Most Necl are overexpressed in HCC where high level of
Nectin-4 associates with poor prognosis [83].
Dysfunctional NK cells have been described in settings
of chronic inflammation such as NASH [84], viral hepatitis
[85] and in the TME [86]. Reduced membrane expression
of certain NKG2D ligands in HCC patients correlate with
disease progression and early recurrence [87, 88]. TGF-β
induces a suppressive environment in downregulating
NKG2D receptors and upregulating inhibitory receptors
such as TIGIT and CD96 on NK cells [89, 90] and CD94/
NKG2A on NK and T-cells [91]. In HCC patients, intratumoral NK cells with high level of CD96 were functionally
exhausted with reduced production of IFN-γ and TNFα and
associated with reduced shorter disease-free survival and
overall survival times [90].
Myeloid cells
The two main myeloid cell populations within the TME are
TAMs and MDSCs. MDSCs are a more immature myeloid
population found in both the peripheral circulation and

within tumours, whereas TAMs are tissue-resident only.
Endothelial and HSC production of CXCL12 promotes
intra-tumoural myeloid cell recruitment via chemokine
receptor CXCR4 [92]. Infiltrating MDSCs foster tumour
progression [93] and higher circulating MDSCs increase the
risk of HCC recurrence after ablative therapy [94]. MDSCs
deplete arginine in the TME through the production of
arginase, resulting in suppression of T-cell proliferation. In
addition, they promote T-reg expansion through the production of IL-10 and TGF-β and promote inhibitory signalling in effector T cells through surface expression of PDL1 [95].
TAMs are the predominant tumour-infiltrating leucocyte
population and their presence confers poor prognosis in
HCC [96]. High IL-10 secretion by MDSCs results in the
skewing of resident macrophages and infiltrating monocytes
to an immune-regulatory phenotype. They release growth
factors including TGF-β and VEGF to promote tumour
growth and development, promote cancer cell stemness
through activation of NF-κB and metastasis through the
production of matrix metalloproteinases [97]. TAMs can
also directly inhibit anti-tumour cytotoxic T-cell proliferation and promote regulatory CD4+ T-cell expansion via
surface expression of PD-L1, secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β
and through the production of nitric oxide and arginase in
the same manner as MDSCs.
Immune checkpoint inhibition in HCC
The systemic treatment of patients with HCC has traditionally been challenged by the intrinsic chemoresistance
[98] and concomitant liver dysfunction, a competing risk
factor for treatment-related toxicity and mortality [99]. The
mainstay of treatment for patients who are not candidates
for liver transplantation, resection or loco-regional therapies
is multi-targeted molecular therapy with sorafenib [100] or
lenvatinib [101], with regorafenib being an approved
second-line treatment option in sorafenib-progressors [102].
Whilst effective in improving survival, these therapies are
largely cytostatic and therapeutic resistance is a significant
limitation to long-term survivorship.
Targeted blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 as
forerunner molecular targets of cancer-related immune
exhaustion has rapidly extended to HCC based on the
promising results of ICPI therapy in multiple indications
(Table 1, Fig. 3).
CTLA-4 monotherapy
Therapeutic targeting of CTLA-4 has resulted in the first
demonstrable evidence of anti-tumour regression following
selective modulation of a T-cell co-inhibitory pathway in
melanoma [103]. Whilst characterised by low frequency of
anti-tumour responses, single-agent anti-CTLA-4 therapy
leads to long-term survivorship in ~20% of patients, providing evidence of long-lasting immune reconstitution
[104].
Tremelimumab, a fully human anti-CTLA-4 IgG2
monoclonal antibody was the first immune checkpoint
blocker to be tested in advanced HCC in a 21-patient cohort
of advanced, HCV-associated HCC patients. Response rates
were modest (17%), mirrored by a median time to progression (TTP) of 6.5 months [105]. Whilst lacking longterm survival data, the reported median overall survival
(OS) was 8.2 months with a 43% probability of survival at 1

year. In another open-label single-arm study, Duffy et al.
tested tremelimumab at 3.5 and 10 mg/kg scheduled as six
4-weekly induction infusions followed by 3-monthly
maintenance. During induction, at day 36, patients underwent sub-total tumour ablation with the intent to provoke
synergistic immunogenic cell death. Five out of 19 evaluable patients achieved a partial response, translating into a
TTP of 7.4 months and OS of 12.3 months [106]. Both
studies demonstrated evidence of anti-viral activity with
falling HCV RNA load and expansion of HCV-specific Tcell responses [105]. Incidence and severity of treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAE) were consistent with the
known mechanism of action of anti-CTLA-4 blockade in
other indications. Transaminitis >Grade 2 occurred in up to
45% of patients across studies being mostly transient and
not associated with overt liver functional decompensation
[105]. No unexpected or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
were documented. Unlike melanoma, anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy has not undergone extensive testing in the context
of large phase III studies leaving open questions around its
efficacy across diverse etiologies of chronic liver disease
and its ability to induce long-lasting anti-tumour control.
PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy
The clinical efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint
blockade resides in its ability to augment the effector
function of tumour-specific CD8+ T-cells [107], resulting
in tumour rejection. The favourable therapeutic index of
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and reproducible efficacy has broadened opportunities for therapy in patients with previously
untreatable malignancies (for instance B-RAF Wild Type
melanoma) or ineligible to traditional therapies (i.e.,
cisplatin-ineligible urothelial cancer). In HCC, concerns
over concomitant liver dysfunction and hepatotropic viral
infection led to the need for confirmatory studies verifying
the safety of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in this challenging
patient population.
CheckMate-040 is the landmark, multi-cohort, open
label, phase I/II study that has assessed the fully human

anti-PD-1 IgG4 antibody nivolumab in advanced HCC
patients for safety and efficacy. The phase I component of
the study assessed escalating doses of nivolumab in three
concurrent cohorts of patients with virus-uninfected, HBV,
HCV-infected advanced HCC starting from 0.1 mg mg/kg
and utilising a standard 3 + 3 design [8]. Adequate antiviral control was mandated in patients with HBV infection.
The trial completed dose escalation to 10 mg/kg every
2 weeks with no DLTs and no hepatitis flares. TRAEs were
dose-unrelated and included grade 3–4 events in 25% of
patients (12/48). Nivolumab was further tested at 3 mg/kg in
214 subjects with HCV (n = 50), HBV infection (n = 51)
and without viral hepatitis, further stratified in sorafenibnaïve/intolerant (n = 56) and sorafenib-progressors (n =
57). Objective response rates (ORRs) were 15 and 20%
across dose-escalation and expansion cohorts and the
median OS was 15 months (95% CI 9.6–20.2) in the doseescalation group. The follow-on phase III study
CheckMate-459 failed to show superiority of nivolumab
over sorafenib in improving OS as a first-line therapy for
unresectable HCC (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72–1.02; p =
0.0752) [108].
The humanised anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in
Keynote-224, a non-randomised phase II study of 104
patients with advanced HCC who had previously discontinued sorafenib due to progressive disease (80%) or
intolerance (20%). None of the 26 HCV-positive (25%) or
22 HBV-positive patients (21%) experienced worsening or
re-activation of hepatitis. TRAEs of grade 3–4 intensity
were seen in 26 patients (25%), the most frequent being
transaminitis in 6 (6%). The encouraging efficacy of pembrolizumab is demonstrated by the ORR achieved in 18
patients (17%), 77% of whom remained in response for over
9 months. Median PFS and OS were 4.9 months (95% CI
3.4–7.2) and 12.9 months (95% CI 9.7–15.5) and 1-year OS
rate was 54% (95% CI 44–63) [9]. Keynote-240 evaluated
pembrolizumab in pre-treated patients with advanced HCC
in a phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled design. In
total, 413 patients with Child-Pugh A, PS 0-1 advanced
HCC intolerant or progressors to sorafenib were randomised
2:1 to pembrolizumab (n = 278) or placebo (n = 135),
receiving treatment for up to 35 cycles or earlier interruption due to progression or unacceptable toxicity. Keynote240 confirmed the ORR observed in other single-agent PD1 studies (16.9%) with a median duration of response of
13.8 months (95% CI 12.7–23.6). Despite an improvement
in the two co-primary endpoints of OS (HR = 0.78, 95%CI:
0.61–0.99; p = 0.0238) and PFS (HR = 0.78, 95%CI:
0.61–0.99; p = 0.0209), the study failed to meet the prespecified threshold for statistical significance [109].
Amongst the reasons considered for the discrepancy
between predicted and observed effects of pembrolizumab
in this patient population is the rapidly changing landscape
of systemic treatment in HCC, with the advent of novel
therapies such as regorafenib and cabozantinib having
changed the expected survival probability of patients with
advanced HCC [110].
Other PD-1 inhibitors with less mature clinical data in
HCC include tislelizumab (BGB-A317) [111], camrelizumab (SHR-1210) [112] and cemiplimab (REGN2810)
[113]. Data around their safety and preliminary efficacy are
available mostly from dose-expansion cohorts of earlyphase clinical studies and confirm incidence and intensity of
treatment-related AEs that are in keeping with the
mechanism of action of the compounds. The experience
with camrelizumab, tested in an open-label study of 220
patients from 13 institutions in China is perhaps the most
mature, with evidence of ORR of 13.8% a median PFS of
2.6 months (95%CI 2.0–3.3) and 6-months OS rate of
74.7%. In a much smaller 26-patient cohort, cemiplimab
resulted in 5 PRs and 14 SDs. Tislelizumab was launched
into late-phase development with RATIONALE 301 study
after identification of the recommended phase 2 dose and is
currently the first study to explore non-inferiority against
sorafenib in a randomised controlled phase III study in
advanced HCC [114].
Clinical data on anti-PD-L1 monotherapy have been
presented as part of a phase I/II study evaluating the IgG1
monoclonal antibody durvalumab in an expansion cohort of
40 HCC patients with Child-Pugh Class A, 93% of whom
sorafenib experienced. The study has reported an ORR of
10%, a median OS of 13.2 months and a 56% 1-year survival rate, accompanied by a safety profile characterised by
a 20% incidence of G3-4 irAEs, most commonly transaminitis in up to 7% of patients [115].
Combination therapies
The evolving clinical experience in the use of PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitors has led to the expansion of combinations aimed at
improving ORR and leading to greater survival benefit
versus monotherapy. Mechanisms of synergy include
simultaneous targeting of multiple co-inhibitory receptors,
promotion of immunogenic cell death with local treatments
or radiotherapy and re-programming of the TME with targeted anti-cancer agents. The majority of these strategies
have been tested in the context of small, single-arm studies
in HCC, often in absence of pre-clinical models to guide
efficacy testing.
Dual immune checkpoint blockade
Convincing clinical evidence of synergy from CTLA-4/PD1 co-inhibition in melanoma [116], kidney cancer [117] and
NSCLC [118] has led to the understanding that concurrent
3628 D. J. Pinato et al.

targeting of multiple immune checkpoints leads to an
increased magnitude and depth of anti-tumour immune
responses across malignancies. The rationale behind dual
CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade is evident from the differential and
non-redundant immune-biologic role of the two pathways
within the cancer immunity cycle, where CTLA-4 is a
prominent driver of immune-suppression in tumour-antigen
presenting cells and T-regs, whereas PD-1/PD-L1 predominantly downregulates the effectiveness of the CD8 +
CTL response.
Clinically, the safety and early efficacy of three different
dosing schedules of ipilimumab and nivolumab were tested
in cohort 4 of the Checkmate-040 study. Advanced HCC
patients with Child-Pugh A class and prior sorafenib treatment were randomised to three arms: nivolumab 1 mg/kg +
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg or nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab
1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses followed by nivolumab maintenance (240 mg flat dose every 2 weeks) until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A third arm
evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every
6 weeks until discontinuation due to progression or toxicity.
Overall, incidence of treatment-related AEs was 37%, most
common being skin toxicity. The discontinuation rate for
toxicity was low at 5%. Analysis of efficacy revealed the
combination to yield a 31% ORR, which compares
favourably with the previous experience of nivolumab
monotherapy within the same study (14%) [119].
Durvalumab and tremelimumab have been tested in
combination at the dose of 20 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg respectively every 4 weeks followed by 20 mg/kg durvalumab
maintenance in a phase I/II study of 40 patients with
advanced HCC. In this study 70% of the patients had
received prior systemic treatment and 50% were hepatitisuninfected. The proportion of severe treatment-related AEs
was 20% and discontinuation rate was 7%. The ORR was
15%, with the entirety of confirmed responses seen in
uninfected patients. Disease-control rates at 16 weeks from
study commencement was 57% [120]. The encouraging
results from this study have led to the inception of the
HIMALAYA study, a randomised, multi-centre phase III
study that will compare durvalumab and tremelimumab
against durvalumab monotherapy or sorafenib as first-line
therapy for HCC.
NK cell-based therapies
To enhance NK cell activity, blockade of the inhibitory KIR
receptors using the anti-KIR antibody Lirilumab (IPH2102/
BMS-986015) is being evaluated in combination with
nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced solid
tumours including HCC (NCT01714739). Safety profile of
Lirilumab in monotherapy or combination showed no
DLTs, with the exception of increased infusion-related
reactions [121, 122].
Other inhibitory receptors shared by NK cells and T-cells
including TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3, BTLA and NKG2A have
been identified as novel checkpoint blockade [123] holding
promise in combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or
anti-CTLA-4 antibodies [88]. NKG2A blockade in animal
model of HCV infection led to enhanced NK and CD8+ Tcell functions promoting HCV clearance [124]. NKG2A
blockade combined with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade was
recently shown to enhance NK and T-cell anti-tumour
response [125, 126] in murine lymphoma tumour models
and in human in vitro experiments [125]. Preliminary
results of a phase II trial combining monalizumab, a
humanised anti-NKG2A antibody, and cetuximab, an antiEGFR in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients
showed a 31% objective response rate (NCT02643550).
These results will likely encourage trials in other types of
cancer including HCC where HLA-E ligands for NKG2A
have been evidenced [125]. Successful clinical translation
of these therapies to HCC requires a better understanding of
the regulation and function of these pathways.
Targeted therapies
Molecularly targeted therapies have played a pivotal role in
the medical management of HCC, with sorafenib having
solidly remained the first and for nearly a decade the only
drug therapy to demonstrate a significant OS benefit in
treatment-naïve Child-Pugh A HCC patients [100]. Pursuing combination therapy with ICPI and molecularly targeted
agents is not only justified by evidence of single-agent
activity but also by the complex bidirectional relationship
existing between angiogenesis and immunity [127]. Resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy is in fact at least in part
determined by an immune-suppressive microenvironment
characterised by higher T-reg infiltration and stronger PDL1 expression [128]. The expression of PD-L1 itself is
strongly placed under the transcriptional regulation of
hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha [129]. In HCC, sorafenib
therapy induces tumoural PD-L1 overexpression [130], and
pre-clinical evidence in mouse models suggests this to
correlate with T-reg accumulation and M2-macrophage
polarisation through hypoxia, drawing a translationally
appealing rationale for combination therapy [131]. Inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, and in particular VEGF aids
normalisation of the endothelial barrier by regulating key
adhesion molecules for immune cell homing to the tumour.
VEGF also inhibits DC maturation and accentuates PD-1
expression of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells highlighting
the potential for synergy between VEGF inhibition and
ICPI therapy [132].
Immune-based therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma 3629

An increasing number of studies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and anti-angiogenics is underway. On the basis of the
positive safety and efficacy data from GO30140 [133], the
combination of atezolizumab (1200 mg) co-administered 3-
weekly with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) (A + B) was the first
to reach efficacy in the phase III Imbrave 150 study (n =
501), the first to show superiority of combination immunotherapy in improving OS (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.79, p
= 0.0006), PFS (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47–0.76, P < 0.0001)
and ORR (27 vs 12%, p < 0.0001) versus sorafenib. The
favourable safety profile, with mainly asymptomatic toxicities (proteinuria/hypertension) comes as a great challenge
to standard of care and is likely to change the treatment
landscape of HCC [134].
Keynote-524, an open-label, phase Ib study of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with unresectable
HCC echoed these results demonstrating promising antitumour activity and acceptable safety, although with higher
rates of symptomatic toxicities. After a safety lead-in of 6
patients and an expansion of 24 patients previously
untreated for HCC, at median follow up of 9.7 months ORR
by RECIST criteria were 36.7% increasing to 50% when
modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were used. On the
basis of the promising initial results the protocol was
amended to allow for the recruitment of 100 patients to
study part 2 and led to breakthrough FDA approval of the
combination on the basis of ORR [135].
The phase Ib VEGF Liver 100 study (NCT03289533) of
the PD-L1 IgG1 antibody avelumab co-administered at the
dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with the VEGF receptor
kinase 1, 2, 3 inhibitor axitinib has demonstrated an ORR of
13.6% based on RECIST 1.1 and 31.8% when evaluated by
mRECIST criteria. Median PFS was 5.5 and 3.8 months
based on RECIST and mRECIST respectively. Despite
fairly high levels of grade 3 TKI-related toxicities including
hypertension (50%) and hand–foot syndrome (22.7%), no
grade >3 irAEs and no treatment related were reported
[136].
Loco-regional therapies
Loco-regional therapies including ablation and trans-arterial
chemoembolization (TACE) have traditionally played a
major role in the treatment of liver-confined HCC. Mounting evidence suggests loco-regional therapies to produce
quantifiable changes in immune cell subsets, leading to the
premise that the local ischaemic and cytotoxic effect provoked by thermal, radio-frequency ablation or chemoembolization of liver tumours might promote
immunogenic cell death [137]. The pilot study of tremelimumab combined with ablation/chemoembolisation is to
date the most comprehensive prospective study that has
looked at the synergistic effect between local and systemic
therapy [106]. In a subset of patients who experienced
clinical benefit, evidence of increased CD8+ infiltrate in
tumour biopsies collected post treatment gives a positive
although preliminary confirmation of the immunogenic
activity of the combination. The lack of a comparator arm
makes it impossible to disentangle the superadded effect of
CTLA-4 inhibition from that of local therapy. Equally, the
heterogeneity of ablative techniques used makes the clinical
outcomes difficult to generalise to the broader population of
patients with liver-confined HCC. A number of studies are
actively recruiting in the intermediate-stage HCC space,
with nivolumab, pembrolizumab being tested in combination with conventional (NCT03397654, NCT0314370),
DEB-TACE and yttrium-90 radioembolization. Preliminary
results of the PETAL clinical trial of pembrolizumab
administered 3-weekly after conventional TACE has shown
no evidence of synergistic toxicity with TACE [138].
Efficacy results of these early-phase clinical studies are
eagerly awaited given the failure of anti-angiogenic therapy
to promote clinically-significant improvements in long-term
anti-tumour control and survival in this patient population
[139].
Other immunotherapeutic approaches
Beyond ICPIs, a number of other immunotherapeutic
approaches have been studied over the years in primary
liver cancer. The existence of measurable, naturally occurring responses against TAA in peripheral blood of patients
with HCC has prompted the investigation of anti-tumour
vaccine studies against immunodominant peptides of oncofoetal proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), glypican-3
(GPC3), telomerase reverse transcriptase and many others
such as MAGE-A1, NY-ESO-1 [140].
A key barrier to the effective development of vaccines as
therapies for HCC stands in the co-existence of multiple
inhibitory mechanisms including enrichment of infiltrating
T-regs [140]. Whilst strategies including pre-conditioning
with low-dose cyclophosphamide (a T-reg depleting agent)
or stimulation with colony stimulating factors have been
attempted [141], these have been unsuccessful in producing
long-term, clinically meaningful anti-tumour responses. Ex
vivo stimulation of DCs aims to correct a key primary
mechanism of cancer immune evasion by promoting
effective antigen presentation and induce immunological
memory [142]. Results of DC-based vaccinations have
however been mixed in the clinic. Whilst capable of generating measurable anti-TAA responses [143], clinical
efficacy is limited to disease stabilisation with lowfrequency proportion of partial responses in most studies
[143–145]. Heterogeneity in DC vaccination manufacturing
and the need for dedicated facilities for apheresis and re3630 D. J. Pinato et al.

infusion of DCs makes this approach difficult to adopt in
absence of more convincing evidence of efficacy [146].
Adoptive cell transfer consists of the re-infusion of
autologous T cells following in vitro activation with exogenously supplemented cytokines. Infusion of autologous
T cells for 6 months following in vitro stimulation with
CD3 and IL-2 has been evaluated in a randomised controlled study of 76 patients. After a median follow-up period
of 4.4 years, adoptive T-cell immunotherapy decreased
recurrence probability by 18% [147]. Beneficial effects
from adoptive re-infusion of activated cytokine induced
killer cells, a mixed population of CD3+/CD56+ and
CD3+/CD56- T-cells and CD3-/CD56+ natural killer cells,
were confirmed in studies enroling patients who achieved
complete response following resection, ablation or percutaneous ethanol injection [148]. Combined infusion of
T cells and DCs has also been attempted, leading to
improvement in post-operative survival [149]. The positive
results from adoptive cellular immunotherapy and the evidence of TAA-specific responses in HCC have stimulated
research into chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, which
combine antigen-specificity with the potential to infuse a
fully active cytotoxic effector T-cell population. Whilst
initial pre-clinical evidence is promising [150, 151] concerns over toxicity warrants a careful clinical development
in patients with HCC [152].
Predictive biomarkers
The probability of achieving clinical benefit from ICPI
therapy is restricted to a fraction of patients with HCC.
High-throughput studies on tissue samples have identified
25% of patients to harbour transcriptomic hallmarks of a
pro-inflammatory response associated with features of
adaptive or exhausted immunity [153]. There is an acute
need to translate this knowledge into clinically available
predictive correlates of response and survival to spare
patients from potentially ineffective therapies characterised
by the risk of life-threatening immunotoxicity.
PD-L1 expression
Immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 has emerged a
putative predictor of response to PD-1/PD-L1-targeted
checkpoint inhibitors with variable predictive ability across
malignancies. Assessment of PD-L1 expression is challenged by clonal diversity of the antibodies used for
detection, varying methodology for scoring of tumour and
infiltrating cells and biologic heterogeneity of the sampled
tissue. In HCC evidence for a predictive role for PD-L1
staining has been elusive. In Keynote-224, evaluation of
PD-L1 expression by 22c3 PharmDx companion diagnostic
assay was restricted to fresh or archival tissue from 52 of
104 participants. Combined tumoural and stromal PD-L1
expression was associated with higher ORR (p = 0.021) and
PFS (p = 0.026) to pembrolizumab, whereas tumour cell
staining alone was not (p = 0.088 and 0.096, respectively)
[9]. In Checkmate 040, PD-L1 expression in tumour cells
was evaluated using the 28-8 PharmDx assay. In the
expansion cohort (n = 174), 9/34 patients with PD-L1 >1%
achieved an objective response (26%) compared with 26 out
of 140 (19%) with PD-L1 < 1% [8]. Analytical heterogeneity across PD-L1 assays is substantial [154], a factor
that might contribute to the poor performance of this
biomarker.
Tumour mutational burden (TMB)
Tumour mutational burden (TMB) measures the number of
somatic non-synonymous mutations per mega-base (Mut/
Mb) in the coding genome of tumour cell [155]. It is
believed that TMB-high tumours, mostly defined as those
harbouring >10 mut/Mb, are enriched in tumour neoantigens and therefore intrinsically immunogenic. TMB is an
emerging predictor of response across malignancies. However, compared with other tumours, HCC has median
number of 5 Mut/Mb [156–159], ranging from 0.5 to
10 Mut/Mb [156, 157]. Impairment of mismatch repair
mechanisms, which contribute to a hypermutated phenotype
is also infrequent in HCC [160]. Analyses of genomic
databases including a small fraction of ICPI recipients (n =
17) confirmed the low prevalence of TMB-high HCC
(median 4 Mut/Mb) and limited evidence for a predictive
role of TMB, highlighting the need for more comprehensive
evaluation of genomic and non-genomic predictors of outcome [161].
The gut microbiota as a source of biomarkers
Microbial proteins are able to prime T-cell responses
[162] and play a fundamental role in the induction,
training and function of the host immune system
[163, 164]. The gut microbiome determines resistance to
ICPI in a number of tumours treated with PD-1 blockade
[165–167]. The liver does not harbour a known intrinsic
microbiome but the gut microbiota plays a critical role in
liver inflammation, chronic fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and
HCC development via the gut–liver axis [168–170]. A
pilot study of 8 HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors
has revealed taxonomic diversity and enrichment in
20 species including Akkermansia and Ruminococcaceae
to predict for response [171] suggesting characteristic
alterations in the gut microbiota profile to have potential
as predictive biomarkers of clinical benefit in ICPIrecipients. The precise molecular mechanisms that may
Immune-based therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma 3631

facilitate anti-tumour immunity warrant further elucidation in larger cohorts.
Conclusions and future directions
With its robust immune/inflammatory pathogenesis, HCC
remains a strong candidate for the development of immunebased therapies. The rapid expansion of immunotherapy has
however been only partially successful. To date, cell-based
therapies remain promising but limited in widespread clinical application. ICPIs yield objective anti-tumour responses
but their effect in improving survival is still unproven. The
plethora of redundant immune-suppressive signals coupled
with the lack of robust biomarkers for stratification appear
key barriers to an effective deployment of immunotherapy.
Rationale selection of immunotherapeutic combinations
may yield a window of opportunity to improve outcomes
across the various stages of HCC.
