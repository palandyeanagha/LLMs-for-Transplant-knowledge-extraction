Abstract
Background and Aim There is a paucity of data on the clinical presentations and outcomes of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID19) in patients with underlying liver disease. We aimed to summarize the presentations and outcomes of COVID-19-positive
patients and compare with historical controls.
Methods Patients with known chronic liver disease who presented with superimposed COVID-19 (n = 28) between 22
April 2020 and 22 June 2020 were studied. Seventy-eight cirrhotic patients without COVID-19 were included
as historical controls for comparison.
Results A total of 28 COVID-19 patients (two without cirrhosis, one with compensated cirrhosis, sixteen with acute
decompensation [AD], and nine with acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF]) were included. The etiology of cirrhosis
was alcohol (n = 9), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 2), viral (n = 5), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 6). The clinical presentations included complications of cirrhosis in 12 (46.2%), respiratory
symptoms in 3 (11.5%), and combined complications of cirrhosis and respiratory symptoms in 11 (42.3%) patients.
The median hospital stay was 8 (7–12) days. The mortality rate in COVID-19 patients was 42.3% (11/26), as
compared with 23.1% (18/78) in the historical controls (p = 0.077). All COVID-19 patients with ACLF (9/9) died
compared with 53.3% (16/30) in ACLF of historical controls (p = 0.015). Mortality rate was higher in COVID-19
patients with compensated cirrhosis and AD as compared with historical controls 2/17 (11.8%) vs. 2/48 (4.2%),
though not statistically significant (p = 0.278). Requirement of mechanical ventilation independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio 13.68). Both non-cirrhotic patients presented with respiratory symptoms and recovered
uneventfully.
Conclusion COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, with worst survival rates in ACLF.
Mechanical ventilation is associated with a poor outcome.

Introduction
Since 30 January 2020, when India reported its first case of
Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the novel
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–Corona Virus 2 (SARSCoV-2), the total number of cases have increased to 4,40,462
as of 22 June 2020 [1]. Although the COVID-19 predominantly
presents as a respiratory illness in most patients, extrapulmonary
manifestations also have been described [2]. The tropism of the
virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors [3]
and its presence on the hepatic endothelial cells and
cholangiocytes [4] may predispose to direct hepatotoxic injury
[5].
Liver enzyme derangements are common, seen in 14% to
53% of COVID-19 cases [2]. The clinical consequences are
not well known in patients without liver disease since the
majority of these derangements are mild in nature and hence
clinically inconsequential [6]. However, their impact on patients with underlying liver diseases is beginning to emerge.
Evolving data from a global registry suggest a poor outcome
in patients with cirrhosis. Among these, 45% presented with
new decompensation and the mortality rate was 33%. In contrast, 303 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) without
cirrhosis fared better with a mortality rate of 8% [7].
Genetic variability across the world can potentially impact
the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which accounts for a
myriad of possible presentations and outcomes. However,
there is a paucity of data on the presentations and outcomes
of COVID-19 patients with underlying liver diseases from
different parts of the world. We report our experience of patients with liver disease and COVID-19.
Methods
Patient population
In this observation study, all consecutive patients with known
liver disease presenting between 22 April 2020 and 22 June 2020
were included. Patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 based on
oro-/naso-pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA)
positive result on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) as per the Indian Council of Medical Research
(ICMR) criteria [8]. Data were collected from a prospectively
maintained database of all patients from admission until endpoint
of the study (discharge or death or deadline of 22 June 2020).
We compared the results of COVID-19-positive cirrhosis
patients with age-, sex-, and severity-matched cirrhosis patients without COVID-19 (historical controls) from previously
published data from our center [9, 10].
Patient evaluation and treatment
All consecutive patients with liver disease presenting to the emergency services with either fever or respiratory symptoms or chest
X-ray showing infiltrates were tested for COVID-19 as per the
hospital policy. Patients who had no symptom or tested negative
initially were offered to retesting based on the development of
new respiratory symptoms or fever at the discretion of the
treating physician. Nasal and throat swabs were taken and
transported in a viral transport media (Hank’s balanced salt solution) and tested by RT-PCR. Patients with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia were offered broad-spectrum antibiotics,
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without ivermectin
Bullet points of the study highlights
What is already known?
Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has a high mortality in patients with comorbidities
such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. 
The effect and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with underlying cirrhosis is unclear.
What is new in this study?
Patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 have poor outcome as compared with those 
without COVID-19. 
The survival rates are worst among COVID patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure.
What are the future clinical and research implications of the study findings?
Future studies should assess the role of newer drugs in patients with cirrhosis.

according to the evolving consensus [11]. Complications of liver
disease including organ failures were managed according to the
standard guidelines [12].
Definitions
Abnormalities in the liver function tests (LFTs) were based on
our hospital cut-off values—bilirubin (> 1 mg/dL), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST > 40 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT >40 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP > 280 IU/L).
Cirrhosis was defined by the presence of a nodular outline of
liver on imaging and concomitant evidence of portal hypertension, such as a dilated portal vein and splenomegaly.
Patients with cirrhosis who had a current history of variceal
bleed, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or jaundice were labeled as having acute decompensation (AD). Acute-onchronic liver failure (ACLF) was defined according to the
European Association the Study of the Liver (EASL)–chronic
liver failure (CLIF) consortium definition—characterized by a
hepatic or extrahepatic insult in a patient with underlying
CLD and associated with prespecified organ failure [13].
The clinical presentations were defined as complications of
cirrhosis as mentioned above and as respiratory when the presentation was predominantly with cough, breathlessness, and
pneumonia. The hospital stay was counted onwards from the
date of COVID-19 diagnosis for cases diagnosed during their
hospitalization and from the date of admission for those who
presented with a positive test. The clinical severity of COVID19 was defined according to the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare (MOHFW) criteria as follows—mild disease
as patients with only upper respiratory tract symptoms without
any signs of breathlessness and hypoxia. Moderate severity
was defined as the presence of pneumonia with the respiratory
rate (RR) between 24 and 30/min and SpO2 between 90% and
94% on room air while the severe disease was defined by the
presence of pneumonia with RR > 30/min or SpO2 < 90% on
room air or severe respiratory distress [14].
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD), and skewed data were expressed as median
with interquartile range. Nominal data were expressed as frequency and percentage. Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U
test was used for comparing continuous data as appropriate.
The Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables as applicable. Univariate and multivariate
Cox-regression analysis was performed for analysis of predictors of in-hospital mortality. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistical software (Version 20.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Ethical clearance
In this retrospective analysis requirement of consent was
waived off. The study was approved by the institutional ethics
committee.
Results
A total of 750 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted during
the study period. Of these 28 (3.7%) patients had an underlying
liver disease- 26 patients had liver cirrhosis, one each had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and extrahepatic portal
venous obstruction (EHPVO). Among patients with cirrhosis,
one had compensated cirrhosis, 16 had AD, and 9 presented with
ACLF. The median age of patients was 48 (38–58) years, and 20
(71.4%) were males. The etiology of cirrhosis was alcoholrelated in 9 (34.6%), NAFLD in 2 (7.7%), hepatitis B virus
(HBV) in 3 (11.5%), hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 2 (7.7%), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in 4 (15.4%), and cryptogenic cirrhosis
in 6 (23.1%).
Presentations and outcomes
Patients without cirrhosis
Both non-cirrhotic patients, one with NAFLD and other with
EHPVO, presented with respiratory symptoms. None of the
two developed liver-related complications. The LFTs were normal at admission in both the patients. The patient with EHPVO
was pregnant at the time of admission and had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Both these patients recovered uneventfully
without the need for oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
Patients with compensated cirrhosis
One patient had NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis with
baseline Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CTP) score of 5, and a model
for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 9. His associated
comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary
artery disease (CAD). He presented with respiratory symptoms and developed ACLF (grade III) during his hospital stay
with respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failures. The patient succumbed to multiorgan failure on day 4 of hospital
admission. COVID-19 was severe in this patient.
Patients with AD
Sixteen patients had AD. The mean age was 48.6 ± 10.6 years,
and 12 (75%) were males. The clinical presentations included
primarily features of AD in 10 (62.5%), AD as well as respiratory complications in 5 (31.3%), and respiratory alone in
one (6.3%). Among the 10 patients presenting with AD, 8
Indian J Gastroenterol (May–June 2020) 39(3):285–291 287

had upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and 2 had ascites.
In the combined presentation, AD included 3 with UGIB and
2 with ascites, and in respiratory 4 had pneumonia and one
had upper respiratory tract infection. One patient presented
with pneumonia alone and during the hospital stay developed UGIB. Nine (56.3%) of these patients had a history
of DM. The causes of cirrhosis included alcohol in 6
(37.5%), HBV, HCV, and NAFLD in 1 (6.3%) each,
AIH in 2 (12.5%), and cryptogenic in 5 (31.3%). The
LFTs were as follows—bilirubin 1.4 ± 0.8 mg/dL, AST
50 (37–82) IU/L, ALT 29 (19–42) IU/L, ALP 102 (75–
299) IU/L, albumin 3.0 ± 0.8 g/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3 ± 0.2. The mean CTP and
MELD scores were 7.2 ± 1.6 and 12.1 ± 3.1, respectively.
At presentation deranged LFT values included bilirubin
(> 1 mg/dL) in 10 (62.5%), AST (> 40 IU/L) in 10
(62.5%), ALT (> 40 IU/L) in 4 (25%), ALP (> 280 IU/
L) in 4 (25%). Median hospital stay was 8 (6–17) days in
16 patients with AD. Of these, 15 (93.8%) recovered and
were discharged. One patient (6.3%) required invasive
mechanical ventilation and succumbed to illness after developing grade III ACLF (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and cerebral failure). Overall, COVID-19 severity
was mild in 14 (87.5%), and moderate and severe in 1
(6.3%) each.
Patients with ACLF
Nine patients had ACLF at presentation; the mean age was
47.4 ± 13.6 years, and 6 (67%) were males. Of these 9 patients, grade I, II, and III ACLF were present in 3 (33%), 2
(22.2%), and 4 (44.4%), respectively. The causes of cirrhosis
included alcohol in 3 (33%), HBV and AIH in 2 (22%) each,
and HCV and cryptogenic in one (11%) each. The clinical
presentations included complications of cirrhosis along with
respiratory complaints in 6 (67%), complications of cirrhosis
alone in 2 (22%), and only respiratory complaints in one
patient.
Three (33%) patients with ACLF had DM. The LFTs were
as follows—bilirubin 5.3 (3.4–18.4) mg/dL, AST 75 (61–140)
IU/L, ALT 37 (25–59) IU/L, ALP 174 (88–489) IU/L, albumin 2.8 ± 0.7 g/dL, and INR 2.6 ± 1.2.
The mean CTP, MELD score, and chronic liver failure–
consortium organ failure (CLIF-C OF) and CLIF-C ACLF
scores were 11.1 ± 0.9, 28.4 ± 7.7, 13.8 ± 2.7, and 58.0 ±
13.6, respectively. At presentation, deranged bilirubin and
AST were seen in all, ALT in 4 (44%) and alkaline phosphatase in 4 (44%). Of the 9 patients with ACLF, all died over a
median hospital stay of 7 (5–8) days. The cause of death was
acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan failure in
all 9 (100%) patients. Overall, COVID-19 was severe in 7
(77.8%), and mild and moderate in 1 (11.1%) patient each.
Comparison of characteristics between cirrhotic
patients with COVID-19 and historical controls
We compared COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis (n = 26) with
age-, sex-, and severity-matched historical controls (n = 78),
from a previously published data from our center (Table 1).
There was no difference in characteristics between the
COVID-19-positive cases and historical controls except platelet count and alkaline phosphatase, which were higher in historical controls.
Overall, the mortality rate was higher in cirrhosis patients
with COVID-19 (11/26 [42.3%] vs. 18/78 [23.1%]), though
the difference just fell short of statistical significance (p =
0.077). The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients presenting as ACLF was 100% (9/9), while that in historical controls
with ACLF was 53.3% (16/30) (p = 0.015). The mortality rate
among COVID-19 patients presenting as compensated cirrhosis and AD was 11.8% (2/17), compared with 4.2% (2/48)
among historical controls (p = 0.278). There were no differences between the prognostic scores of ACLF patients with
COVID-19 and historical controls—MELD (28.4 ± 7.7 vs.
30.9 ± 6.6, p = 0.347), and CLIF-C ACLF score (58.0 ± 13.6
vs. 50.8 ± 10.7, p = 0.107).
Predictors of mortality
On univariate analysis, the factors significant for outcome
among COVID-19 patients were total leukocyte count
(TLC), total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, CTP score, MELD
score, and requirement of invasive ventilation (Table 2). On
multivariate analysis only mechanical ventilation was independently associated with mortality HR, 13.680 (1.390–
134.582, P = 0.025) after adjusting for MELD, and TLC.
Use of COVID-19 specific drugs
Twenty-five patients received specific drugs for COVID-19:
HCQ 21 (84%), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 5
(20%), vitamin C 22 (88%), zinc 10 (40%), azithromycin 20
(80%), ivermectin 13 (52%), and methylprednisolone 5
(20%).
Discussion
In this analysis from a tertiary care center in India, we describe
the clinical presentations and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with underlying liver disease. Over 8 weeks, we included 28 patients with underlying liver disease presenting with
COVID-19. A higher number of patients reported in the latter
part of the study were in accordance with the increasing incidence of COVID-19 in India [15]. Overall, COVID-19 severity was mild in 15 (57.7%), moderate in 2 (7.7%), and severe

in 9 (34.6%). We observed that COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis presented with complications of cirrhosis in 12
(46.2%), respiratory symptoms in 3 (11.5%), and combined
complications of cirrhosis and respiratory symptoms in 11
(42.3%). The high rate of respiratory symptoms is expected
as SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via the respiratory route. Our
data suggest that cirrhosis patients presenting with respiratory
symptoms and recent onset of decompensation/deterioration
of underlying liver disease should be evaluated for SARSCoV-2 infection. Patients with cirrhosis and ACLF are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of impaired immune status. We observed patients with compensated cirrhosis deteriorate after COVID-19. Furthermore, none of ACLF
patients with concomitant COVID-19 survived in our study,
as compared with 47% survival rate in ACLF patients of historical control. The presence of pneumonia in more than 50%
of patients in the COVID-19 group could have led to a higher
proportion of patients developing AD and ACLF. On multivariate analysis, we found requirement of invasive ventilation
to be an independent predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients. The higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients could
possibly be because of extrahepatic organ failures especially
respiratory failure. The severity of lung injury and CLIF-C has
been associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients
with cirrhosis [16]. Pulmonary vascular changes including
capillary microthrombi are common in patients with
COVID-19 [17]. The exact mechanisms related to poor outcomes need exploration.
The outcome parameters in our study are similar to those
reported by a multicenter registry (dated 19 June 2020)—
(Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus) Under
Research Exclusion (SECURE)-CIRRHOSIS registry and
EASL supported COVID-Hep [7]. The registry reported the
outcome of 833 patients with CLD. Of the 303 patients with
CLD without cirrhosis, the requirement of invasive ventilation
was 18% and mortality was 8%. Among the 379 patients with
cirrhosis (alcohol 32%, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 20%, viral 18%, and alcohol and HCV combined 5%), decompensation occurred in 45%, the requirement of invasive ventilation
was 19%, and death occurred in 33%. Among the 151 liver
transplant (LT) patients, the requirement of invasive ventilation was 19% and death occurred in 19% of patients. These

results suggest that patients with cirrhosis are at a higher risk
of mortality post-COVID-19.
Infections are common in patients with ACLF and are associated with poor outcomes [9]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection
outcomes are similar to other acute precipitants, including bacterial infection in patients developing ACLF, is unclear. A recent
study reported poor outcomes in COVID-19-patients as compared with those with bacterial infection [16]. The definite management of ACLF is LT. The current society guidelines differ in
their opinion regarding LT in the current scenario. The American
Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommends not to postpone transplants as it is an essential medical
service while the EASL and Asian Pacific Association for the
Study of the Liver (APASL) recommend restricting transplants
to those with poor short-term prognosis [18]. The medical treatment options that have been tried for the management of
COVID-19 patients include drugs like hydroxychloroquine,
remdesivir, other antivirals, and plasma therapy. None of these
therapies has been shown to definitely improve the outcome.
Moreover, most of these have hepatic side effects. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for effective therapies to improve outcomes. We followed the standard recommendation for the management of all complications. For patients who presented with
UGIB, we delayed endoscopy and managed patients with vasoconstrictors like terlipressin and patients were started on carvedilol for secondary prophylaxis [19]. All the patients could be
managed medically without an increased risk of rebleeding.
We found that the proportion of patients with
COVID-19 with alcoholic etiology of CLD was less as
compared with our previous experience [20]. In the preCOVID era, the highest fraction of CLD patients admitted was due to alcohol etiology [9]. Lockdown was
implemented by the Indian government, and alcohol
was not available; this could be a reason, and another
possible reason could be the fact the borders of the
states were sealed, which would reduce the number of
patients reaching the hospital.
The derangement of LFTs at presentations has been reported in up to 50% of patients without liver disease [21]. The
exact significance of the rise in transaminases and its relation
to outcomes is unclear. The rise in liver enzymes could be
multifactorial due to drugs side effects, associated ischemic
hepatitis, and possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection per
se or the associated cytokine storm [2].
Limitations of the study include its descriptive nature. Due
to a small number of patients, we cannot rule out chances of
type II statistical errors. The comparison group was taken
from historical control admitted during different time frame.
The drug therapies varied as per the evolving guidelines and
treating team’s consensus. Our center is a tertiary care center;
the proportion of patients with advanced liver disease was
higher as compared with chronic hepatitis and compensated
cirrhosis. Our results need to be validated in larger sample size
before generalization.
In conclusion, COVID-19 in patients presenting as ACLF
is associated with a poor outcome. Overall, in cirrhotic patients, COVID-19 appears to confer higher mortality as compared with those without it. Mechanical ventilation is associated with a poor outcome. In the absence of definite therapies
available for COVID-19, it is imperative to prevent COVID19 infection in patients with cirrhosis.
