setting the stage for advancing clinical practice, knowledge, 
and research of MAFLD in adults, with specifc reference 
to special groups as necessary. The guidelines also seek to

stakeholders in the decision-making process by providing

Introduction
The Asia–Pacifc region with at least 55 countries is home 
to more than half of the world’s population and accounted 
for 62.6% of liver-related deaths in 2015 [1]. Though 
there are substantial disparities in rates of development 
within the political, economic, and educational spheres, 
the entire region is moving towards urbanisation, shifting 
from an agrarian diet towards increased consumption of 
energy dense, nutrient poor foods, a sedentary lifestyle, and 
reduced physical activity. Similar to other afuent nations, 
this change has led to an increase in prevalence of disorders 
related to poor metabolic health. As would be expected from 
this, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) 
has risen in prevalence to alarming levels, placing an enormous burden on individuals and health‐care systems [2]. 
This document presents the clinical practice guidelines of 
the Asian Pacifc Association for the Study of the Liver 
(APASL) on MAFLD. The authors performed a systematic 
review of the literature retrieved after an extensive PubMed 
search up to April 2020 on specifed domains of interest and 
translated this scientifc evidence into practice guidelines 
with recommendations to improve the assessment and management of patients with MAFLD.
These guidelines cover various aspects in the management of MAFLD including epidemiology, diagnosis, screening, assessment, and treatment. The statements in this document follow the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation approach (Table 1). 
The document was intended for practical use and for 
setting the stage for advancing knowledge and research of 
MAFLD in adults, with specifc reference to special groups 
whenever necessary. The final purpose was to improve 
patient care and awareness of MAFLD and to assist stakeholders in the decision-making process by providing evidence-based data. The guidelines take into consideration the 
burden of clinical management for the healthcare sector. A 
summary of all the recommendations is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Since it is expected that new evidence will 
emerge on the implications of adopting the MAFLD criteria, 
updates to these guidelines might be required in future.
Epidemiology
Emerging evidence based on several large population-based 
studies has demonstrated an exponential increase in MAFLD 
burden in the Asia–Pacifc region over the past three decades [1]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 
MAFLD prevalence from an Asian context and comprising>13,044,518 individuals suggested that the prevalence 
of MAFLD in this region is 29.62% (95% CI 28.13–31.15) 
[4]. Within the Asia–Pacifc region, MAFLD prevalence 
varies widely as would be predicted from tremendous variations in genetic background, nutrition, physical activity, 
lifestyle, and sedentary behavior. As expected, there is a bias 
in reported studies towards those that emanate from more 
afuent countries with more developed healthcare systems 
in the region [1].
Though there are no nationwide epidemiological surveys 
even within a single country such as China, there are substantial diferences according to regions and over time in the 
prevalence of MAFLD. For instance, MAFLD prevalence in 
the populations from Shanghai (East China) was estimated 
to have increased from 15% before 2005 to 38.17% in 2012 
[5, 6]. The prevalence in Xinxiang, Henan Province (Central 
China) was 29.85% in 2017 [7]. Similarly, in other regions of 
China, Chengdu (Southwest China) and Guangdong (South 
China), MAFLD prevalence rates were 12.5% and 17%, 
respectively [8, 9]. In Taiwan, the prevalence of MAFLD 
was estimated to be 11.4% in the general population [10] 
but was even higher in sub-populations such as the elderly 
(50.1%) [11] and among Taxi drivers, who typically have

inactive lifestyles (66.4%) [12]. In Hong Kong, a community 
proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based study 
suggested the prevalence of 28.8%; 19.3% in non-obese subjects, and 60.5% among the obese [13].
In the Far East, the community prevalence of MAFLD 
was found to be 23–26% while 27.3% of subjects undergoing routine health screening demonstrated fatty liver by 
abdominal ultrasonography in Japan and Korea, respectively 
[14, 15]. Notably, in Japan, the prevalence of MAFLD has 
increased from 12.6% before 1990 to 30.3% in 1998 [16].
In rural India, a region characterized by traditional lifestyles and diets, the prevalence of MAFLD is remarkably 
low (~9%), while it mimics other Asian country prevalence 
rates in urban populations (16–32%) [17–19]. A nationwide community ultrasound-based study from Bangladesh 
of 2782 participants observed that the overall prevalence 
of MAFLD was 33.86% with no diference between urban 
and rural populations suggesting that Bangladesh has one 
of the highest rates of MAFLD in South Asia [20]. A similar dramatic variation in MAFLD prevalence (5–30%) was 
observed in smaller reports from Singapore, Malaysia, Sri 
Lanka, and Indonesia [21–24]. Diferences in the prevalence 
of MAFLD was also observed among Asians of diferent 
ethnicities; for example, in multi-ethnic studies from Malaysia, the prevalence of MAFLD is consistently higher among 
ethnic Malays and Indians compared with ethnic Chinese; 
this ethnic predilection is observed as early as young adulthood [23, 25, 26].
Thus, while MAFLD rates are varied, there is a common 
trend to increasing prevalence with time. This has meant 
that the prevalence of MAFLD between the East and West is 
more similar than diferent and is beginning to approximate 
each other and in some cases, to exceed that in the West 
(e.g., in Pacifc Island nations). Given the high prevalence 
of viral hepatitis in the region and as previous diagnostic 
criteria are based on the exclusion of other liver diseases, it 
may result in under-reporting of the true burden of MAFLD. 
This further highlights the urgent need for “positive criteria” 
for disease diagnosis.
Few studies have examined the incidence of MAFLD 
in Asia. A recent meta-analysis (18 studies) suggested that 
the annual MAFLD incidence rate in Asian countries was 
50.9 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 44.8–57.4) [4]. 
In a population study in Hong Kong using paired MRS, 
13.5% (95% CI 10.6–16.3%) of the studied cohort developed MAFLD over an interval of 3–5 years, with an annual 
incidence of MAFLD estimated at 3.4%[27].
Defnition and diagnosis of MAFLD
Interest in fatty liver diseases not due to alcohol has risen 
dramatically, in large part driven by its increased global 
prevalence. However, this disease is highly heterogeneous 
and thus placing all patients with a diverse and diferential 
array of disease drivers under the acronym NAFLD can negatively impact clinical decision-making. Further, NAFLD is 
a diagnosis of exclusion rather than one of inclusion.
To address these issues, APASL endorses the proposal 
of a consensus panel of leading experts who proposed that 
a more appropriate nomenclature for the disease would be 
“metabolic associated fatty liver disease” or MAFLD [28]. 
The major beneft of this new nomenclature is a shift towards 
a diagnosis of inclusion based on the presence of metabolic 
dysfunction, the key driver of the disease. The new algorithm is developed from “positive criteria” regardless of 
alcohol consumption or other concomitant liver diseases 
(Fig. 1) [29]. In addition, this new nomenclature helps to 
identify a homogenous group of patients and will guide 
eforts for stratifcation of patients with MAFLD. As summarized in the paper, the diagnosis of MAFLD is based on 
the detection of liver steatosis (liver histology, non-invasive 
biomarkers or imaging) together with the presence of at 
least one of three criteria that includes overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or clinical evidence of

metabolic dysfunction, such as an increased waist circumference and an abnormal lipid or glycemic profle. Situations 
including cirrhosis cases where liver fat is no longer present 
are recognized as a special category within the new criteria. A recent study on a cohort of 13,083 patients from the 
NHANES III (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys) database showed that the MAFLD criteria are more 
practical and have higher ability for identifying at-high risk 
patients than the previous NAFLD criteria [30].
Diagnosis and impact of MAFLD in the setting 
of other liver disease
Since MAFLD is no longer a diagnosis of exclusion and is 
based on the presence of metabolic dysfunction, it is now 
possible to diagnose its coexistence with other liver diseases 
such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), chronic hepatitis B 
virus infection (CHB), and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (CHC), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary hemochromatosis, especially in Asian populations. Moreover, 
meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of MAFLD plus one 
and more other less frequent alternative causes of fatty liver

either at baseline or at follow-up, e.g., long-term use of steatogenic medications, HCV genotype 3 infection, or Wilson 
disease should also be diagnosed as mixed or dual etiology 
liver disease as the case may be (Table 2).
These individuals likely have a diferent natural history 
and response to therapy than those with liver disease of a 
“single” etiology [29]. Notably, MAFLD may accelerate the 
progression of liver disease in patients with ALD and CHB, 
and synergistically induce liver cirrhosis or even HCC development [32, 33]. Therefore, patients with MAFLD should 
be carefully evaluated for possible concurrent liver diseases 
such as ALD and viral hepatitis. Conversely, MAFLD and 
underlying metabolic dysfunction may increase the risk of 
metabolic and cardiovascular events in patients with other 
liver diseases.
MAFLD patients with ALD represent a large and 
important group that requires further investigation and 
characterisation with respect to natural history, outcomes 
and response to treatment. Meticulous history taking for 
lifetime and current alcohol intake through patient interview aid in diagnosis of dual etiology fatty liver disease. 
Recently, there has been mounting evidence against the 
so-called “safe limits” for alcohol intake in the setting of 
MAFLD [28, 34, 35], as even low alcohol intake is associated with an increased risk for cirrhosis and cancer, and 
decreased rates of improvement in steatohepatitis [28, 36, 
37]. The efect of alcohol intake on the progression of liver 
disease and outcomes likely has a dose–response with a 
synergistic negative efect in the presence of metabolic 
syndrome and the “cut-of” values of alcohol intake in 
MAFLD should be set lower than the apparent “threshold levels”. Therefore, patients with MAFLD should be 
advised to avoid alcohol and if that is not possible, to consume the lowest amount possible.

With the high prevalence rates of MAFLD and CHC, it is 
expected that these two disease entities will occur together 
and their concomitant existence is estimated to be approximately 38% [38]. MAFLD signifcantly impacts the entire 
natural course of CHC including progression of the liver 
disease, therapeutic responses, and the development of some 
extrahepatic complications [39–44]. Viral eradication by 
direct-acting anti-viral therapy or previously by interferon 
therapy was demonstrated to reduce insulin resistance, liver 
steatosis, and fbrosis in patients with CHC, especially in 
genotype 3 HCV infection [45, 46].
Although CHB infection is negatively associated with 
hepatic steatosis in some reports [47], the number of 
patients with coexisting CHB and MAFLD is growing 
rapidly [48]. Notably, MAFLD may accelerate the progression of liver disease in patients with CHB; a recent study 
from Thailand suggested that MAFLD was independently 
associated with increased risk of signifcant liver fbrosis 
(OR, 10.0; 95% CI 2.08–48.5) and advanced liver fbrosis 
(OR, 3.45; 95% CI 1.11–10.7) in CHB patients [49]. Similarly, another study demonstrated that MAFLD independently increased the risk of HCC development by 7.3‐fold 
(OR: 7.3, 95%CI 1.52–34.76) in patients with CHB[50].
MAFLD is becoming a major reason for persistently 
abnormal liver tests and poor outcomes in individuals with 
CHB and/or CHC infection after profound virological suppression or sustained virological response [51, 52]. Treatment of MAFLD in this group should be considered as for 
non-infected patients.

crest)>90 cm for males and>80 cm for females
Risk factors for MAFLD
MAFLD is a public health challenge in many parts of 
Asia–Pacific region due to socioeconomic changes and 
the rapid transition from undernutrition to overnutrition. 
In turn, excess energy intake relative to expenditure with 
nutritionally imbalanced and unhealthy diets contribute to 
an accumulation of triglyceride in adipose tissue and the 
liver. Risk factors for MAFLD in Asians are similar to that 
in Westerners (Table 3). However, Asians are more likely to 
have central fat deposition despite having a lower body mass 
index (BMI). In detailed metabolic studies, south Asians 
in the USA had higher insulin resistance (IR) compared to 
Caucasians in spite of having an equal or lower BMI [53]. 
Likewise, Asian-Indian men have greater liver fat content 
and higher IR than age- and BMI-matched European individuals [54, 55]. A greater waist circumference and visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT) has a more signifcant correlation 
with IR and MAFLD than a high BMI [56, 57]. Similarly, 
abdominal and visceral adiposity is greater among Asians 
compared with Caucasians and lower in Africans, for the 
same BMI [58–61]. Modifed cut-of points for BMI and 
waist circumference have thus been recommended for the 
Asian population [62, 63] (Table 4). Consistent with this 
phenotype, rates of T2DM are also markedly increased in 
Asian Indian populations [6, 64]. Even, non-obese and lean 
Asian people with MAFLD are at a high risk of metabolic 
syndrome and T2DM [65].
Although overweight/obesity is closely associated with 
the development and progression of MAFLD, subtle weight 
gain that has not led to overweight is an important determinant of incident metabolic disease and MAFLD. Within the 
MAFLD population, 19.2% of people are lean and 40.8% are 
non-obese, without diferences in the histological severity 
of disease between lean and obese patients [66, 67]. Up to 
one-third of patients with MAFLD and a normal BMI meet 
the criteria for metabolic syndrome [67].
Metabolic syndrome and its components also increase 
the risk of developing MAFLD. As would be expected from 
these data, the global prevalence of MAFLD among patients 
with T2DM is 55.5% and up to 10–20% have advanced fbrosis [68]. The bidirectional causal relationship of components 
of metabolic syndrome with MAFLD has been well established [69]. Thus, patients with MAFLD beneft from lifestyle intervention and weight loss [70] as well as assessment 
for, and treatment of, other components of the metabolic 
syndrome. Such an approach will reduce the risk of liver and 
non-liver related comorbidities, while screening for MAFLD 
by ultrasonography should be considered in at-risk populations including those with overweight/obesity, T2DM or 
metabolic syndrome.
A functional role for microbiota in MAFLD-pathogenesis 
is increasingly appreciated [71]. This is best illustrated by 
Should MAFLD be considered with other liver diseases?
Recommendations
• MAFLD can and frequently does coexist with other 
liver diseases (A1).
• MAFLD treatment and that of concomitant diseases 
should be as per the recommendations for each of the 
diseases (B1).

diferences in the impact of gut bacteria from obese and lean 
humans on the risk of fat accumulation in germ-free mice. 
Transplantation of fecal bacteria from obese adult humans 
led to a higher percentage of body fat in the mice compared 
to those from lean adults [72]. However, human data on the 
role of gut microbiota in MAFLD and its therapeutic use are 
in their early stage.
There is strong evidence in support of racial and socioeconomic-disparity-based diferences in gut microbiota. 
In humans, greater fecal bacterial diversity is seen in less 
afuent populations such as those from Bangladesh, when 
compared to urbanized European or American children 
[73]. Similarly, greater fecal bacterial diversity was noted 
in children from rural South Thailand compared to urbanized 
children from Singapore [74]. This diversity is obvious even 
within ethnic groups with a relatively narrow range of socioeconomic discrepancy. For example, a recent study compared pre-adolescents from three distinct Malaysian ethnic 
groups [Malays, Chinese and Orang Asli (indigenous)], with 
a relatively narrow range of socioeconomic discrepancy. 
The study demonstrated that the highest bacterial diversity 
was in indigenous children who are relatively economically 
deprived compared to their Chinese counterparts [75].
The role of factors such as genetics, epigenetics, and sarcopenia have also been recognized and are the subject of 
recent reviews [76–79]. Incorporation of genetic variant testing in routine clinical practice is not recommended currently 
due to the lack of certainty on cost-efectiveness and utility.
(CVD) followed by cancer and liver failure are the main causes 
of death in MAFLD. There is clear evidence for ethnic differences in prevalence of MAFLD, with highest prevalence 
among Latinos and least among African Americans, with Caucasian and Asian ethnicities having an intermediate prevalence 
[80–82]. In contrast, less is known regarding the consequences 
of hepatic steatosis, liver infammation, and fbrosis according to ethnicity. While data are scant, cross-sectional studies 
suggested that Asian subjects are more likely to have worse 
histologic injury. In a recent study, despite having a lower 
BMI than other groups, Asians (included patients of Korean, 
Filipino, Chinese and Indian origin) had more lobular infammation and higher grades of ballooning compared to other 
ethnicities (Caucasian, Hispanics and African Americans) 
[80]. In another report, Asians living in the US showed a trend 
toward an association with more severe steatosis and infammation compared to Caucasians [83]. If liver tests are used as 
a surrogate for hepatic infammation, a large cross-sectional 
multiethnic cohort from the United Kingdom suggested that 
the highest prevalence of abnormal liver tests is among Asians 
(Bangladeshi (18.4%), Pakistani (17.6%), and Indian (14.8%)), 
compared with Caucasians (13.5%), Africans (11.8%), and Caribbean islanders (10.2%). In a subsequent multivariate analysis, Bangladeshi ethnicity was an independent risk factor for 
MAFLD and for elevated liver tests [84]. Similarly, scant data 
are available regarding liver fbrosis. Asians tended to have a 
higher risk for fbrosis, while Africans were at lower risk compared to Caucasians. This, however, did not reach statistical 
signifcance possibly due to sample size limitations [80, 83]. 
Notably, these biopsy-based studies might be subject to selection bias. A population-based study in Hong Kong suggested 
that while MAFLD is prevalent and detected in about 25% of 
the population, the prevalence of advanced fbrosis is low [85].
In the Asia–pacifc region there is a paucity of data on 
MAFLD-HCC and is likely confounded by the higher prevalence of viral hepatitis, a major risk factor for HCC in Asia. 
Viral hepatitis increases the risk of oncogenic transformation, 
viral hepatitis can also contribute to HCC development even 
in the absence of serological clues of previous infection [86], 
which is most likely to occur in the context of CHB [86].
The available data suggest that 2% of all HCC in Japan 
was due to MAFLD; the median age of patients was 
72 years, and 62% were males [87]. Similarly, a large retrospective cohort study of 6,508 Japanese with MAFLD 
suggested that the rate of new HCC was 0.043% during a 
median follow-up of 5.6 years. In this study, 184 patients 
with signifcant fbrosis were identifed using the AST-toplatelet ratio index; 6/184 (3.26%) developed HCC during 
the follow-up period [88]. Similar trends have been noted 
from other countries in Asia. In South Korea, a study of 
329 patients has shown that the proportion with MAFLDrelated HCC rose from 3.8% in 2001–2005 to 12.2% in 
2006–2010; by contrast, HBV-related HCC declined from 
Natural history of MAFLD
Globally, 54.3% of deaths due to cirrhosis and 72.7% of 
deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurred in the 
Asia–Pacifc region in 2015[1]. However, the true burden of 
MAFLD in Asia is not fully understood. Cardiovascular disease 
Should the high‑risk population be screened for MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Screening for MAFLD by ultrasonography should be 
considered in at-risk populations such as patients with 
overweight/obesity, T2DM and metabolic syndrome 
(A1).
• Patients with MAFLD should be assessed for other 
components of metabolic syndrome and be treated 
accordingly (A1).
• Patients with MAFLD should receive advice and support for lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of 
events from metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and 
to resolve fatty liver disease (A1).

86.6% to 67.4% [89]. In India, despite the high prevalence 
of MAFLD and T2DM, there is a lack of data on the prevalence of MAFLD-HCC. A recent estimate suggested that 
a potential staggering 930,000 people in India might have 
MAFLD-HCC [90].
Notably, in a recent modelling study of eight countries, 
the MAFLD population in China is projected to increase 
by 29.1% to 314.58 million cases from 2016 to 2030 
[91]. Decompensated cirrhosis and liver-related deaths 
secondary to MAFLD are expected to double during the 
same period. Similarly, in another study looking at fbrosis progression among the MAFLD populations of Hong 
Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan [92]. Prevalent 
MAFLD cases were projected to increase from 6 to 20%, 
incident decompensated cirrhosis from 65 to 100% and 
incident cases of HCC from 65 to 85%, over the period 
2019–2030.
In regard to comparisons with other liver diseases, in a 
prospective cohort study, the yearly cumulative incidence 
of HCC was 2.6% in MAFLD-cirrhosis during a median 
follow-up of 3.2 years. This was comparable with a reported 
4% incidence in a CHC cirrhotic population over the same 
time period [93]. A recent multicentre study suggested that 
MAFLD-HCC is more often detected at a later tumor stage 
compared to HCV-HCC, and could arise in the absence 
of cirrhosis with a similar survival rate compared to HCV 
infection, after patient matching [94]. Another prospective cohort multi-centre study from Australia, the US, and 
Europe reported that patients with MAFLD and advanced 
fbrosis have lower rates of HCC and liver-related complications compared to those with HCV infection, but similar 
overall mortality [95]. Large prospective studies from Asia 
are required to corroborate these data.
Overall, these fgures are likely to be underestimated 
as a signifcant number will have had dual etiology liver 
disease with MAFLD and viral hepatitis or ALD but would 
have been identifed as viral hepatitis- or ALD-associated HCC. In addition, another important consideration 
is that the prevalence fgures of MAFLD-HCC may be 
an underestimate if cryptogenic cirrhosis attributable to 
MAFLD is considered. In a recent study of 105 patients 
with HCC, 29% were found to have cryptogenic cirrhosis; 
half of these had histological or clinical features consistent with MAFLD [96]. Similar observations have been 
reported from Asia. In a Japanese report, clinical features 
of MAFLD were more frequent in cryptogenic cirrhosis 
than with virus-related cirrhosis [97], while in India, two 
thirds of patients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis were ultimately diagnosed with MAFLD 
on their explants [98]. Thus, with current recommendations for abandoning the term “cryptogenic cirrhosis” to 
describe cirrhotic patients with low or undetectable levels of steatosis but who meet the diagnostic criteria for 
MAFLD, many would ft under the umbrella of “MAFLDrelated cirrhosis” [99].
Extrahepatic manifestations of MAFLD
MAFLD is one aspect of a multi-system disease and it is 
therefore not surprising that cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
is its most important complication, followed by cancer and 
others diseases including obstructive sleep apnea, chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), polycystic ovarian syndrome, and 
osteoporosis.
MAFLD is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis 
as evidenced by increased carotid intima media thickness, 
coronary artery calcifcation score, arterial stifness, and 
endothelial dysfunction [100]. In a longitudinal study of 
8020 subjects without subclinical carotid atherosclerosis at 
baseline, those with regression of MAFLD were less likely 
to develop subclinical carotid atherosclerosis compared to 
those with persistent MAFLD. Furthermore, the risk of 
developing subclinical carotid atherosclerosis was higher 
among subjects with more severe liver fbrosis [101]. Importantly, MAFLD is associated with an increased risk of fatal 
and/or non-fatal cardiovascular events and the risk is higher 
among patients with more severe liver disease [102, 103]. 
Furthermore, those with more severe fatty liver disease had a 
higher in-hospital and 3-year mortality following an episode 
of myocardial infarction [104]. Overall, CVD is the leading 
cause of mortality in patients with MAFLD and baseline 
liver fbrosis is the strongest predictor [105]. Therefore, 
patients with MAFLD should be evaluated for CVD risk.
Francque et al., have proposed an algorithm for screening MAFLD patients for cardiovascular disease. MAFLD 
patients with clinically active CVD or a history of a cardiovascular event should be under the care of a cardiologist. 
Otherwise, patients with more severe disease (i.e. steatohepatitis or signifcant fbrosis), T2DM, or increased risk of 
CVD should undergo further evaluation (e.g. electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and/or subclinical CVD screening, 
where available) and be considered for referral to a cardiologist. Patients who are negative on further evaluation can be 
re-evaluated every 2–3 years [106]. CVD risk can be estimated using risk scores (e.g. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular 
Disease Risk Estimator Plus, available at https://tools.acc.
org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/content/about/).
Similarly, a strong association between MAFLD and 
CKD has been established, independent of the presence of 
potential confounding factors such as obesity, T2DM, and 
hypertension [107]. An independent association between 
MAFLD and sarcopenia has also been suggested.
Dyslipidemia, if present, should be treated to reduce the 
risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. A study on 428 
MAFLD patients across four Asian countries found disproportionately low statin use compared with the prevalence 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 897
1 3
of dyslipidemia; 59% of patients who were not on a statin should have been on one, while the majority (74%) of 
patients who were on a statin were not treated to target [108]. 
A post hoc analysis of the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation study found statin therapy to 
not only be safe but it resulted in improved liver tests and 
reduced cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild to 
moderately abnormal liver tests,likely due to MAFLD [109].
A blood pressure target of<130/80 mmHg is appropriate 
for most patients and HbA1c level of≤6.5% is considered 
optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and cost-efective manner [110]. The types and choice of medications for treatment 
of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and T2DM are beyond the 
scope of this paper. However, newer medications for T2DM, 
i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (GLP-1a) and sodium 
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been 
shown to improve metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular 
outcomes and may be useful for treatment of steatohepatitis. Empaglifozin, for example, signifcantly reduced overall and cardiovascular-specifc morality and hospitalization 
for heart failure compared with placebo [111]. Likewise, 
liraglutide signifcantly reduces death from cerebro-cardiovascular causes compared with placebo [112]. Risk factor modifcation to target is typically undertaken in primary 
care; however, specialists treating patients with MAFLD 
should be encouraged to assess and undertake risk factor 
management as part of a holistic approach to patient care.
variable it can theoretically be used to monitor changes in 
hepatic steatosis over time, though this needs to be confrmed by studies using paired liver biopsies or other quantifable methods for assessing steatosis such as with MRS 
or MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). An interquartile range>30–40 dB/m has been associated with less 
reliable CAP measurements [116, 117] but its role requires 
further validation.
MRI-based techniques such as MRI-PDFF and protonMRS are considered the gold standard to quantify liver fat. In 
some clinical trials, a>30% relative reduction in liver fat fraction correlated with histological improvements in the activity 
score or resolution of steatohepatitis [118], though the same 
has not been reported in other studies [119], and the association is probably drug-specifc. Currently, liver fat fraction by 
MRI is often used in early phase clinical trials to determine 
potential benefts of the investigational drug treatment.
The fatty liver index (FLI) is a simple algorithm based on 
BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, and GGT for detecting fatty liver and may be used as an alternative method for the 
diagnosis of steatosis, particularly in large population studies 
[120]. Ultrasonographic Fatty Liver Indicator (US ‐FLI) is 
another scoring system used to rule out steatohepatitis. The 
score ranges from 2 to 8 based on ultrasonographic features, 
including the intensity of liver/kidney contrast [121].
Among the various histological features of MAFLD, the 
degree of liver fbrosis has the strongest correlation with 
future liver-related morbidity and mortality [122]. NITs of 
fbrosis can be classifed into simple fbrosis scores, specifc 
fbrosis biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers [123]. Simple fbrosis scores such as the aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) [124], Fibrosis-4 index 
(FIB-4) [125], and NAFLD fbrosis score (NFS) [126] only 
involve clinical and routine laboratory parameters and are 
inexpensive. Although the accuracy is modest, these scores 
have good negative predictive values to exclude advanced 
fbrosis and is the primary clinical utility of these scores 
[127, 128]. This is particularly important in primary care 
or resource poor settings where the pre-test probability of 
advanced fbrosis is low [129]. Individuals can be defned 
as being at low, intermediate, or high risk for advanced 
fbrosis for each score according to the following cut-ofs: 
APRI (0.5 and 1.5), FIB-4 (1.30 and 2.67), NFS (<-1.455 
and>0.67611). People with low fbrosis scores are also at 
low risk of developing hepatic complications [130]. Therefore, it is reasonable to use simple fbrosis scores as an initial assessment in primary care. A limitation of these scores 
is that they incorporate liver enzymes in the models. As 
patients with liver enzymes in the normal range can have the 
full spectrum of liver fbrosis stages, it remains a shortcoming. Furthermore, liver enzymes are sensitive to age, which 
can lead to false positive results [131].
How to manage the extra‑hepatic manifestations 
of MAFLD?
Recommendations
• MAFLD patients should be evaluated for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk, and referred to 
a cardiologist, if necessary (A1).
• Dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus 
should be identifed and treated accordingly to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease (A1).
Non‑invasive tests
The purpose of non-invasive tests (NITs) includes establishing a diagnosis of MAFLD, assessing disease severity, 
and monitoring disease progression and treatment response 
[113]. The detection of hepatic steatosis by histology or 
imaging is key to a diagnosis of MAFLD. In clinical practice, routine imaging such as abdominal ultrasonography is 
usually sufcient for the detection of hepatic steatosis [114]. 
Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement by 
vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) is more 
sensitive than ultrasonography [115]. As a continuous

In contrast, more specifc fbrosis markers are needed in 
specialist settings to guide the management of patients [132, 
133]. Among them, the enhanced liver fbrosis panel has been 
tested in multiple observational studies and clinical trials with 
good overall accuracy [134]. Another biomarker, called ProC3, refects the formation of type III collagen in hepatocytes. 
The ADAPT algorithm includes age, T2DM, Pro-C3, and 
platelet count and has an area under the receiver-operating 
characteristics curve of 0.87 for advanced fbrosis [135].
Liver stifness measurement (LSM) by VCTE is widely 
used in the Asia–Pacifc region, in part because of patient 
preference against biopsy. Although the success rate of 
VCTE is lower in obese subjects, the majority of MAFLD 
patients can achieve successful liver stifness measurement 
with the XL probe [136, 137], and the same cut-ofs can be 
used for both the M and XL probes if the probes are used 
according to the body habitus or guided by the automated 
probe selection tool [138]. The diagnostic performance for 
advanced hepatic fbrosis of shear wave elastography is similar to that of VCTE [139]. Although the quality criteria for 
fbrosis assessment is limited, shear wave elastography is an 
option for liver stifness measurement.
Non-obese MAFLD is more often described in Asia; 
commonly used fbrosis tests do not appear to be afected in 
this special group [140]. The combination of LSM and simple fbrosis scores has the advantage of improving the positive predictive value and reducing the proportion of patients 
with indeterminate results [141]. In head-to-head comparisons, magnetic resonance elastography has higher success 
rates and an even higher accuracy than VCTE, but its wider 
application is limited by cost and availability [142, 143].
On the other hand, there has not been any robust biomarker for steatohepatitis. Their development is in part limited by the substantial intra-and inter-observer variability 
in the assessment of histological lobular infammation and 
hepatocyte ballooning and the fact that infammation can 
resolve even over relatively short periods. Serum keratin-18 
fragments (also known as cytokeratin-18 fragments) refect 
hepatocyte apoptosis and were proposed as a steatohepatitis 
biomarker. However, subsequent studies suggested that its 
overall accuracy is modest [144]. In a recent multi-centre 
study, the combination of AST with CAP and liver stifness 
measurement by VCTE (the FAST score) achieved a c-statistic of 0.74–0.95 for the detection of fbrotic steatohepatitis 
(NAS score≥4 and fbrosis score≥2) [145].
• If available, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) 
measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) may be used as a more sensitive tool 
than ultrasonography. If imaging modalities are not 
available or feasible such as in very large epidemiological studies, serum biomarkers and scores such as 
the fatty liver index (FLI) may be used as an alternative method for the diagnosis of steatosis (B2).
• Magnetic resonance imaging-based techniques such 
as MRI-PDFF and proton-MRS are considered the 
gold standard to quantify liver fat but it is not recommended for routine clinical practice useful tool in 
early phase clinical trials (A1).
• There is no robust biomarker for steatohepatitis and 
liver biopsy remains the test of choice for assessment 
of steatohepatitis (A1).
• The exclusion of high risk of signifcant or advanced 
fbrosis is acceptable using non-invasive tools, liver 
stifness measurement by VCTE or shear wave elastography and blood biomarkers and scores of fbrosis 
or their sequential combination (A2).
• The confrmation of signifcant or advanced fbrosis 
by liver stifness measurement and/or serum biomarkers/scores is less accurate and would require further 
confrmation by liver biopsy as per the clinical context 
(B2).
How and what non‑invasive scores to use in MAFLD?
• Abdominal ultrasonography is the recommended frstline diagnostic modality for imaging of MAFLD and 
is usually sufcient for the detection of hepatic steatosis (A1).
Liver biopsy
With the development of NITs of hepatic steatosis and fbrosis, routine liver biopsy to assess the severity of MAFLD 
cannot be justifed. However, liver biopsy remains an important diagnostic test to rule out other liver diseases, especially 
when the clinical picture is atypical. Some examples of atypical features include very high aminotransferase level and 
the presence of severe hepatic steatosis in patients with no 
or little metabolic burden. Although non-invasive tests are 
sufcient to guide clinical management in the majority, some 
cases may fall into the grey zone when dual cut-ofs are 
used (i.e. low cut-of to rule out and high cut-of to rule in a 
certain fbrosis stage) [141], and others may have unreliable 
results (e.g. high interquartile range-to-median ratio in case 
of liver stifness measurement) [146]. In some patients, NITs 
results may not ft the clinical picture (e.g. normal fbrosis 
tests in patients with radiological features of cirrhosis and/
or thrombocytopaenia). Liver biopsy can be performed in 
such instances to clarify the situation.
MAFLD is common in patients with gallstones and morbid obesity [147, 148]. Because liver biopsy during laparoscopic or open surgery is safe, it is reasonable to ofer this 
procedure in patients at risk of MAFLD.

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 899

Finally, resolution of steatohepatitis and improvement 
in fbrosis remain key surrogate endpoints in phase 2b/3 
MAFLD trials. Achieving these short-term histological 
endpoints may allow drug approval under the United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s subpart H pathway 
[149]. Besides, liver biopsy is an important tool to enhance 
our understanding of MAFLD through not only careful histological assessment but also molecular and “omic” tools.
Pathological recommendations
The term non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was coined 
by Ludwig et al. to describe a cohort of patients with a liver 
disease that histologically mimicked alcoholic steatohepatitis in patients without a history of signifcant alcohol intake 
and has been in use [150] till recently [29].
The minimum required staining includes hematoxylin and 
eosin (for detection of morphological features), picrosirius 
red or Mallory’s stain (for the detection of fbrosis), and 
Perl’s staining (for the detection of hemosiderosis). Whenever possible and ethically approved, the storage of non-processed fresh frozen tissue for other kinds of staining such as 
lipid staining and research is advisable. Grading and staging 
of histological lesions in steatohepatitis was frst proposed 
by Brunt et al. Necroinfammation was graded as mild, 
moderate, or severe, based on the combination of steatosis, 
lobular and portal infammation, and hepatocyte ballooning (Table 5) [151]. In 2005, Kleiner et al. developed and 
validated a histological evaluation system that encompassed

When would liver biopsy be indicated in MAFLD?
Recommendations: Indications for liver biopsy in patients 
with suspected MAFLD (A1)
• Uncertain diagnosis and evaluation for dual etiologies.
• Non-invasive tests showing indeterminate or nonconcordant results.
• During cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery.
• Approved research

the spectrum of MAFLD and allowed for assessment of 
changes with therapy for the NASH Clinical Research Network (Table 5). The activity score (NAS) included only 
features of active injury and that are potentially reversible 
in the short term. The NAS was defned as the unweighted 
sum of scores for steatosis, lobular infammation, and ballooning. Cases with NAS of 0 to 2 were largely considered 
not-NASH, while most cases with scores≥5 were diagnosed 
as NASH. Cases with scores of 3 and 4 were divided almost 
evenly between the three diagnostic categories of NASH, 
borderline, and not-NASH. Importantly, the authors noted 
that the primary purpose of the NAS was to assess overall 
histological change and numeric values were not intended to 
replace the pathologist’s diagnosis of steatohepatitis [152].
In 2012, Bedossa et al. developed and validated an algorithm for categorization (subsequently called the fatty liver 
inhibition of progression or FLIP algorithm) and scoring 
(called the SAF score) for MAFLD (Table 5). NAFLD (now 
MAFLD) was defned as the presence of steatosis in>5% of 
hepatocytes and NASH by the addition of hepatocyte ballooning and lobular infammation of any degree. The SAF 
score summarized the main histological lesions. Lobular infammation was graded 0–2, unlike the NAS which 
graded lobular infammation 0 to 3. However, grade 2 of 
the SAF score does encompass grade 2 and 3 of the NAS. 
The authors also noted that they did not change the defnition of hepatocyte ballooning proposed by the NASH CRN, 
but added reference to the size and shape of hepatocytes 
for clarity. The activity score was the unweighted sum of 
lobular infammation and hepatocyte ballooning. Among 
the 204 patients with NAS 3 to 4, 116 (57%) had no steatohepatitis, whereas 88 (43%) had steatohepatitis. On the other 
hand, among the 249 patients with A ≥2, 230 (92%) had 
steatohepatitis, whereas all patients with A<2 did not have 
steatohepatitis. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation 
between activity score and the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. 
In other words, the activity score provided a more robust 
histological approach that clearly distinguished most patients 
with steatohepatitis and associated with transaminase levels. Moreover, the authors found no signifcant diferences 
in ALT and AST levels between patients with normal liver 
and patients with pure steatosis supporting the exclusion 
of steatosis as a marker of activity [153]. The NASH CRN 
system and FLIP algorithm and SAF score improved interobserver variability [154] and has been validated clinically 
[152, 155]. Further studies are needed to determine how 
the NAS relates to the SAF score. This will have important 
implications, particularly for studies of the natural history 
of MAFLD using previous histological data.
What is the recommended pathological reporting?
Recommendations
• A standardized reporting of histological lesions in 
MAFLD patients is important for the study of natural 
history, enrolment in clinical trials, and evaluation of 
response to treatment and comparison of data from 
diferent geographic locations (A1).
• Histological evaluation should include at least hematoxylin and eosin stains, and either Masson’s trichrome stain or picrosirius red stain (A1).
• Reporting should be standardised using either the FLIP 
algorithm and SAF score or the NASH CRN system for 
reporting of histological lesions in MAFLD (B1).
MAFLD‑related cirrhosis
At the outset, patients with cirrhosis, even if they are without 
signifcant hepatic steatosis, but meet the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD, should be considered as having MAFLDrelated cirrhosis. This is because multiple lines of evidence 
indicate that hepatic steatosis may diminish with progression 
to cirrhosis [156]. Equally important is that there is a substantial proportion of MAFLD patients with cirrhosis who 
were previously undiagnosed and present for the frst time 
with decompensated cirrhosis, variceal bleeding, or HCC.
Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by typical fndings on ultrasonography, but the diagnosis may be missed when this is 
obscured by liver fat. In this sense, assessment of MAFLD 
patients beyond ultrasonography is necessary. LSM provides 
a reliable assessment of the severity of liver fbrosis and can 
be used to diagnose cirrhosis in MAFLD patients in the correct clinical context [157].
Liver fbrosis is the most important predictor of mortality in MAFLD patients, with the highest risk among those 
with cirrhosis [158]. The spectrum from severe fbrosis to 
cirrhosis is a continuum in asymptomatic patients and distinguishing the two is often not possible on clinical grounds. 
Hence, the term “compensated advanced chronic liver disease” has been introduced. LSM <10 kPa in the absence 
of other known clinical signs rules out, whereas a LSM of 
10–15 kPa is suggestive, and>15 kPa is highly suggestive 
of compensated advanced chronic liver disease [159]. As 
mentioned previously, the same LSM cut-ofs can be used 
with the M probe or XL probe when probe choice is based 
on a computer recommendation or BMI [138].
MAFLD patients with liver stiffness measurement>15 kPa should be considered for surveillance for 
HCC [138], whereas those with LSM >20–25 kPa and/or 
thrombocytopenia are likely to have clinically signifcant 
portal hypertension and should undergo endoscopy for 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 901

variceal screening [159]. LSM is also useful for prognostication in patients with MAFLD, with mortality rate being 
higher with increasing LSM [160]. LSM may not be readily 
available in many places. In such settings, fbrosis scores 
can be a frst step to identify patients who are more likely 
to have severe liver fbrosis and for referral for LSM [161]. 
It is unclear whether MAFLD cirrhotics should be biopsied 
for activity assessment and further studies would be required 
to clarify this aspect.
monitoring clinically signifcant portal hypertension and 
is superior to liver biopsy for predicting complications in 
MAFLD patients, though it is invasive. Ultrasound is a safe 
technique for detecting morphological abnormalities associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The identifcation of porto-collateral circulation on ultrasound, computed 
tomography (CT), or MRI or the evidence of a reversal of 
fow within the portal system is a specifc and indicative 
measure of clinically signifcant portal hypertension and 
is associated with variceal development and growth [165]. 
Therefore, periodic screening by imaging methods is recommended in these patients. Notably, though by defnition 
all patients with gastroesophageal varices have signifcant 
portal hypertension, clinically signifcant portal hypertension is present in approximately 50%–60% of patients with 
cirrhosis but without gastroesophageal varices.[166–168].
The prognosis is worse in patients with cirrhosis and 
gastroesophageal varices compared to those without gastroesophageal varices. Therefore, patients with MAFLDcirrhosis should be screened for gastroesophageal varices 
according to Baveno VI Criteria.[169] A recent meta-analysis of 30 studies (8469 participants) suggested that Baveno 
VI criteria have high diagnostic accuracy as a triage test for 
screening for high-risk varices and varices in patients with 
compensated advanced chronic liver disease (sensitivity: 
0.90 (95% CI 0.85–0.93) [170]. The criteria have recently 
been validated in 224 Chinese patients with MAFLD related 
compensated cirrhosis [171].
Diagnosis of the existence and size of varices and the 
presence of red wale marks at esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
(EGD) is required before the treatment of varices. However, 
EGD and variceal treatment are invasive procedures associated with the risk of bleeding [172]. As a result, there has 
been research into noninvasive methods for determining the 
presence of high-risk varices (i.e. medium/large varices) in 
order to avoid using endoscopy as a screening tool. Currently, the use of noninvasive tests to diagnose gastroesophageal varices is not recommended as the discriminative 
accuracy is limited. However, the assessment of LSM by 
transient elastography is accepted as an accurate technique 
to rule out high-risk varices in patients with compensated 
cirrhosis as described in the previous section. Patients with 
LSM<20 kPa and platelet count>150,000/mm3
 have a very 
low probability (<5%) of having high-risk varices [173]. 
The use of EGD can be avoided in these patients. Those with 
LSM>20–25 kPa are considered to have clinically signifcant portal hypertension. In cirrhotic patients without clinically signifcant portal hypertension, or LSM value between 
10–15 kPa, monitoring of its onset is needed, although data 
on the specifc time interval for monitoring are lacking.
How to diagnose MAFLD‑cirrhosis?
Recommendations
• Patients with cirrhosis in the absence of typical histology who meet the following criteria should be considered as having MAFLD-related cirrhosis:
Past or present evidence of metabolic risk factors that 
meet the criteria to diagnose MAFLD, as described in 
Fig. 1, with at least one of the following:
(1) Documentation of MAFLD on a previous liver 
biopsy*.
(2) Historical documentation of steatosis by hepatic 
imaging* (B2).
*History of past alcohol intake should be considered as 
patients may have dual disease etiology with alcohol use 
disorder
Diagnosis and monitoring for clinically signifcant 
portal hypertension and varices
Classifcation of cirrhosis is based on prognostic staging: 
compensated and decompensated cirrhosis [162, 163]. Such 
classifcation depends on the presence or absence of clinically evident decompensating events such as ascites, variceal 
hemorrhage, encephalopathy, jaundice, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The initial sequelae of MAFLD-cirrhosis or liver cirrhosis 
in general is portal hypertension, which contributes to most 
of the complications seen in cirrhotic patients. In MAFLD, 
this process classically starts close to the central vein (zone 
3), where lipid droplet formation is most active [164]. Therefore, correctly monitoring for the development of clinically 
signifcant portal hypertension, defned by hepatic venous 
pressure gradient (HVPG) of 10 mm Hg is important. The 
measurement of HVPG is considered the gold standard for

Screening for HCC
Though hepatic steatosis associates with “risk factors for 
HCC” such as obesity, T2DM, and metabolic dysfunction, in the absence of cirrhosis the risk of HCC is low [156, 
174–176]. Therefore, till we have more validated prediction 
biomarkers or algorithms for non-cirrhotic patients at high 
risk of HCC, surveillance for HCC is only recommended in 
patients with MAFLD-related cirrhosis. Similarly, patients with 
LSM>15 kPa should be considered for surveillance for HCC.
Ultrasound is useful for HCC surveillance from the perspective of the safety, availability, and cost-efectiveness [177–182]. 
However, its sensitivity for detection of early stage HCC is 
reported to be only 47% [183], and simultaneous measurement of serum biomarker such as AFP is recommended [183, 
184]. In addition, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has been 
reported to be useful for the early detection of HCC, but is not 
widely available [185, 186]. When the ultrasound quality is 
inadequate due to obesity or excessive gas in the alimentary 
tract, or when confrmation is required, CT or MRI may be 
utilised as a surveillance modality [177–182]. Recently, nonenhanced MRI has been reported to have higher screening efcacy for HCC than ultrasonography in high-risk patients [187]. 
However, the availability and high cost are unsolved issues.
A randomized controlled trial showed that there is no signifcant diference in the detection rate of early HCC and in 
prognosis, when surveillance intervals are 3- or 6-monthly. 
The Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) group has shown that 
a 6-month surveillance interval has better rates of early HCC 
detection and prognosis than a 12-month interval [188]. Furthermore, 3-monthly surveillance led to a higher number of 
unnecessary recall procedures. Thus, based on the tumor volume doubling-time of HCC [189], a 6-month screening interval 
is recommended.
Treatment
Ideally, an efective therapy should not only reduce steatosis 
and liver injury, but also improve the metabolic sequelae and 
cardiovascular risk that is intimately linked to MAFLD. Hence, 
lifestyle modifcation including dietary change, weight loss, and 
structured exercise intervention remains the frst-line and cornerstone therapy for this condition.
Diet and lifestyle changes
Lifestyle intervention programmes and weight loss can achieve 
reductions in liver fat content, resolution of steatohepatitis and 
fbrosis and improve a patients’ quality of life in a dose-dependent manner. A recent study (n=293) showed an improvement in 
liver histology (steatohepatitis) in 58% of those achieving>5% 
and in 90% of those achieving weight loss of>10%, respectively; only the latter demonstrated an improvement in fbrosis 
stage (in 45%) [190]. Similarly, studies in Asian populations 
support the dose–response efect of weight loss with a 7–10% 
weight loss target;~40% of those with MAFLD have some 
improvement even with 3–5% weight reduction [191, 192].
The overall aim of lifestyle intervention should be for 
gradual weight loss (up to 1 kg/week) with a hypocaloric diet 
(500–1000 kcal defcit). There is no strong evidence to support 
a particular dietary approach for the resolution of MAFLD. 
A recent meta-analysis of controlled isocaloric feeding with 
constant dietary protein and varying ratios of carbohydrate to 
fat suggests that the diferences are too small, implying that “a 
calorie is a calorie” [193].
Patients with MAFLD tend to consume energy-dense foods 
rich in sugar-sweetened beverages and saturated fat and cholesterol, but defcient in micronutrients found in fresh fruit, fbre, 
green vegetables, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(n-3 PUFA) [194]. Therefore, dietary plans should encourage low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and Mediterranean-type diets. 
In particular, adopting a Mediterranean-type diet has been 
shown to reduce CVD as primary prevention [195] and aids 
in fat mobilization from specifc fat depots including hepatic, 
cardiac, and pancreatic fat deposits [196]. Isocaloric diets that 
are high in animal or plant protein were recently demonstrated 
to reduce hepatic steatosis and infammation in patients with 
T2DM [197]. However, the diferences between these diferent 
diet protocols on long-term outcomes is questionable [198]. 
A systematic review and meta-analysis showed a signifcantly 
decreased risk of MAFLD and liver fbrosis among regular coffee drinkers [199].
Weight loss and more importantly sustaining this efect is 
challenging. A multidisciplinary approach to management is 
pivotal to ensure motivation and continued participation in 
intervention programmes. Increasing clinic visit frequency 
[200] and utilising an internet-based approach for lifestyle 
changes [201] have been suggested to maximize the efcacy 
of weight loss in patients with MAFLD. Therefore, collaboration between diferent stakeholders, including government/
policy makers, physicians, patients association and researchers 
can efectively promote healthy lifestyles and beneft patients 
with MAFLD.
Exercise
The optimal exercise dose for hepatic beneft, including type, 
intensity, volume, and efect size without weight loss is still 
subject to debate. For the general adult population, physical 
activity guidelines recommend 30 min/day of moderate-intensity exercise for≥5 days/week or a total of≥150 min/week or 
vigorous-intensity exercise for≥20 min/day on≥3 days/week 
(≥75 min/week). Resistance exercise on 2–3 days/week and 
fexibility exercises>2 days/week are also recommended [202]. 
Specifc data in patients with MAFLD are relatively limited, 
while exercise intervention with histological improvement 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 903
1 3
overtime as the primary outcome is difcult to undertake. A 
recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that exercise can reduce hepatic steatosis independent of diet change 
[203]. Exercise and life style intervention were also found to 
be able to reduce liver stifness [204], HCC [205], and portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis and obesity [206] A 
randomized clinical trial that included 220 individuals showed 
that both vigorous and moderate exercise were equally efective 
in reducing intrahepatic triglycerides and the efect appeared 
to be largely mediated by weight loss [207]. In another study 
of an occupational health screening program that included 
233,676 subjects between 2002 and 2014, moderate-vigorous 
exercise was demonstrated to be benefcial in decreasing the 
risk of development of new fatty liver or improving resolution of existing fatty liver during 5 years’ follow-up [208]. In 
another study, a dose–response relationship between exercise 
volume and reduction in hepatic steatosis was demonstrated 
with higher responses observed in individuals exercising over 
250 min/week as compared to those exercising for less than 
150 min/week [209]. A recent systematic review suggested that 
both aerobic and resistance exercise reduces hepatic steatosis 
equally in MAFLD, while resistance exercise does this with less 
energy consumption. Thus, resistance exercise may be more 
feasible than aerobic exercise for MAFLD patients with poor 
ftness or for those who cannot tolerate or participate in aerobic 
exercise [210]. Overall, the selection of the type and duration 
of exercise must be based on patients’ preference and the likelihood of long-term adherence. Notably, combined diet/exercise 
strategies are more efective in normalisation of liver enzymes 
levels, reducing hepatic steatosis and for improving histology 
than either modality alone [211].
What are practical recommendations for lifestyle 
intervention in MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Lifestyle change towards a healthy diet and physical 
activity norms via structured programmes are recommended for MAFLD (C2).
• Patients without steatohepatitis or fbrosis should 
receive counselling for a healthy diet and physical 
activity and no pharmacotherapy for their liver disease (B2).
• Both overweight/obese and nonobese MAFLD can 
benefit from weight loss. In the former, a 7–10% 
weight loss is the target of most lifestyle interventions and results in improvement of liver enzymes and 
histology (B1).
• Dietary recommendations should consider energy 
restriction and exclusion of MAFLD-mediating components (processed food, food and beverages high in 
added fructose). A Mediterranean type diet is advisable (B1).
• Combined diet/exercise strategies are more efective 
in normalisation of liver enzymes levels and reducing 
liver fat and improving histology (B1).
• Both aerobic exercise and resistance training efectively reduce liver fat and should be tailored based 
on patient preferences to ensure long-term adherence. 
Resistance exercise may be more feasible than aerobic 
exercise for MAFLD patients with poor ftness (B2).
Bariatric and metabolic therapies (endoscopic 
approaches and surgery) for MAFLD
It is currently premature to consider foregut bariatric surgery 
as an established option to treat MAFLD [212]. Bariatric 
operations are traditionally ofered to patients with MAFLD 
only if they qualify because of other obesity-related comorbidities [213]. While not an indication per se, MAFLD is 
present in 65−90% of all patients who undergo weight loss 
surgery [214, 215]. Under these circumstances, numerous 
retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies 
have investigated the potential utility of bariatric surgery on 
MAFLD parameters. According to recent systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses [216–218], resolution of hepatic steatosis 
was demonstrated in>75% of patients. With respect to steatohepatitis, improvements in ballooning and lobular infammation are consistently observed [216]. Remarkably, regression of fbrosis has been reported in 16 of the 18 studies 
that investigated postoperative fbrosis scores on liver biopsy 
[216]. A recent prospective study also suggested resolution 
of steatohepatitis and fbrosis in liver biopsies from 84% and 
70.2% of patients 5 years later, respectivtely. Notably, the 
reduction in fbrosis commenced in the frst year and continued over the 5-year follow-up [219]. However, the lack 
of randomized controlled trials comparing bariatric surgery 
(and the various surgical procedures) with other interventions prevents defnitive assessment of the benefts and harms 
of this approach as a therapeutic option for MAFLD [214]. 
Patients with MAFLD-related cirrhosis merit special consideration as candidates for bariatric surgery because of their 
high perioperative risk with a reported operative mortality as 
high as 16.3% in patients with decompensated disease [220].
In light of the above evidence, bariatric surgery can be 
considered for MAFLD only if the following two criteria are 
met: (1) presence of other indications [e.g., BMI>35 kg/
m2
 [>30 kg/m2 in Asian people)] and (2) absence of liver 
cirrhosis or evidence of compensated cirrhosis without 
concomitant portal hypertension. The feasibility of weight

loss surgery for patients with MAFLD and BMI≤35 kg/m2
[≤30 kg/m2 in Asian people] is presently unclear and more 
results are needed to support this practice.
It is noteworthy that steatohepatitis and liver fbrosis 
have been reported as potential complications of jejunoileal 
bypass surgery [221]. Besides traditional bariatric operations, research in the feld of MAFLD has begun to focus on 
the potential utility of endoscopic bariatric and metabolic 
therapies (EBMT) including intragastric balloons (IGBs) 
and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) [222]. EMBT are 
safer and less invasive than bariatric surgery, ultimately representing an attractive option for patients with MAFLD who 
qualify because of other obesity-related comorbidities. IGBs 
have been shown to improve MAFLD-related parameters 
in short-term studies, whereas ESG may potentially lead to 
resolution of MAFLD in the long term [222]. However, the 
purported benefts of EMBT in MAFLD warrant further 
evaluation in randomized controlled trials.

patients with MAFLD in clinical practice
Evidence for current drug therapies
Several anti-diabetic medications are reported to be benefcial for patients with MAFLD [212, 223]. Belfort et al. 
conducted a RCT of pioglitazone and demonstrated that 
6-month treatment with pioglitazone improved hepatic steatosis, ballooning necrosis, and infammation in steatohepatitis patients with prediabetes or T2DM [224]. Furthermore, 
18-month treatment with pioglitazone signifcantly improved 
hepatic fbrosis in steatohepatitis patients with prediabetes or T2DM [225]. The benefcial efects of pioglitazone 
on hepatic histology has been reported in steatohepatitis 
patients with and without T2DM [226–229]. Weight gain, 
edema, the development of bladder cancer, and a decrease 
in bone mineral density are possible concerns with pioglitazone, and this therapy is not widely used [230, 231].
GLP-1a has been reported to improve hepatic histology 
including fbrosis in a RCT and meta-analyses [232–235]. 
GLP-1a also reduces body weight. However, GLP-1a causes 
gastrointestinal adverse efects including loss of appetite 
which can result in poor patient-reported outcomes [236]. 
SGLT2i has been reported to reduce hepatic fat content 
[237–239]. A pilot study on a small number of biopsyproven steatohepatitis patients showed signifcant improvements in steatosis, ballooning, and fbrosis, which remained 
signifcant when compared with a historical placebo [240]. 
The efects of SGLT2i on hepatic fbrosis require further 
studies. Metformin does not improve hepatic histology in 
patients with MAFLD [241–244]. However, metformin 
improves IR [241, 243, 244] and reduces the risk of HCC 
in patients with MAFLD, though the studies have not been 
What are the recommendations for bariatric (metabolic) 
surgery in MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Bariatric (metabolic) surgery reduces liver fat and 
improves the histological lesions of MAFLD, including fbrosis (B1).
• Due to the high risk of post-operative complications 
from bariatric (metabolic) surgery in patients with cirrhosis, the decision should be individualised (C1).

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 905

prospective or randomized [245, 246]. Importantly, both 
GLP-1a and SGLT2i have been shown to be benefcial in 
cardiovascular outcome in patients with T2DM.
Vitamin E has been reported to be efective in improving hepatic histology in patients with steatohepatitis [229, 
247–249]. However, several studies have failed to demonstrate its benefcial efects and level 1 evidence is thus lacking [243, 250–252]. Recently, a propensity score matching 
analysis demonstrated that vitamin E decreases the risk of 
death or transplant and hepatic decompensation in patients 
with metabolic steatohepatitis with bridging fbrosis or cirrhosis [253]. The development of prostate cancer is a possible concern of vitamin E [254].
Statins did not show any benefcial efects on hepatic histology [255]. However, statins reduced cardiovascular morbidity in patients with MAFLD [255, 256]. Thus, statins 
should be considered in all patients with MAFLD with 
hyperlipidemia. However, the treatment of hyperlipidemia 
in patients with MAFLD appears suboptimal. In a multicentre study, 58.9% of patients who were on a statin did not 
achieve their treatment target while 74.1% of patients who 
were not on statin should have been receiving therapy [257].
Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with antiinflammatory effects has been demonstrated in a metaanalysis to improve lobular infammation and NAS without 
afecting lipid profles. However, there was no signifcant 
improvement in other histological features, such as steatosis, 
ballooning or fbrosis [258].
Patients with MAFLD are at a high risk of hepatic fbrosis, HCC, cardiovascular events, and cancer. Thus, for any 
physician treating these patients, metabolic risk factor modifcation to improve long-term outcomes is an essential part 
of holistic management.
Monitoring progress and response to treatment
There is no accepted consensus on the optimal strategy for 
monitoring patients with MAFLD and their response to 
treatment [259]. Ideally, an optimal surveillance schedule 
should include routine biochemistry, assessment of comorbidities, and monitoring of hepatic fbrosis [260]. By taking 
into account that the severity of fbrosis is the main prognostic determinant in terms of both liver-related outcomes 
and mortality [261], those with advanced fbrosis merit 
the closest monitoring. Because patients with MAFLD are 
expected to progress at a mean of 0.12 (range: 0.07–0.18) 
fbrosis stage per year [262], the following schedule can be 
proposed as a general guidance (Fig. 2): (1) patients without 
fbrosis can be monitored at 2- or 3-year interval if there 
has been no worsening of concomitant metabolic risk factors; (2) patients with fbrosis should be monitored on an 
annual basis, and (3) patients with cirrhosis should undergo 
monitoring at 6-month intervals including surveillance for 
HCC. In selected patients at high risk of liver disease progression, monitoring should include a repeat liver biopsy 
every 5 years, unless they have established cirrhosis [260]. 
Notably, a recent study showed that while the prevalence 
and incidence of MAFLD in patients with T2DM are high, 
few patients progress to advanced fbrosis in 3 years [136].
Although liver histology remains the primary endpoint in 
clinical trials, its routine use over time for serial surveillance 
of fbrosis progression is unfeasible owing to its known limitations (cost, invasiveness, risk of complications, subjective 
interpretation). However, no easily applicable method for 
use in daily practice with a high predictive value for diferentiating diferent stages of liver fbrosis has been identifed. 
Monitoring of fbrosis progression in the clinic might rely 
on a combination of noninvasive scores (NFS, FIB-4 and 
ADAPT) and LSM [263, 264] although this strategy requires 
further validation. Growing evidence supports the utility 
of magnetic resonance elastography for the non-invasive 
detection of fbrosis in early-phase trials of MAFLD [265]. 
However, this technique is expensive and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use.
How to monitor the progress of treatment in MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Patients without fbrosis can be monitored at intervals 
of 2 or 3 years in the absence of worsening of metabolic risk factors using a combination of non-invasive 
scores and liver stifness mesaurment (C2).
• Patients with fibrosis should be monitored on an 
annual basis using a combination of non-invasive 
scores and liver stifness mesaurment (C2).
• Patients with cirrhosis should undergo monitoring at 
6-month intervals including surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (A2).
• In subgroup of patients at high risk of fbrosis progression, monitoring may include a repeated liver biopsy 
every 5 years’ follow-up, unless they have established 
cirrhosis (C2).

Patient‑reported outcomes in MAFLD
The multi-dimensional complexity of MAFLD management 
has highlighted the importance of understanding the disease 
from a patient perspective through Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO). This is particularly important as new drugs in 
development may have signifcant side efects, and economic 
and cost-efectiveness modelling are needed to identify the 
ideal target subpopulation for treatment.
Instruments assessing general health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) questionnaires such as the Short Form‐36 
(SF‐36), EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), the 
Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) and more 
recently, disease-specifc questionnaires such as CLDQNASH and NASH-CHECK have been validated in MAFLD 
[266–268]. These questionnaires have been translated into 
various languages and validated internationally. Other 
instruments looking more specifcally at fatigue and work 
productivity have also been applied to MAFLD [266].
Patients with MAFLD appear to have worse HRQoL, physical, mental as well as fatigue scores compared to other causes 
of chronic liver disease such as chronic viral Hepatitis B and 
C [269–271]. Demographics or metabolic comorbidities that 
have been associated with these low HRQoL scores include 
age, female gender, depression, smoking, T2DM, and BMI, 
although MAFLD by itself is an independent risk factor [272, 
273]. When referenced against the severity of liver disease, 
several studies using a variety of instruments have reported 
cirrhosis as an independent risk factor for lower HRQoL and 
physical health scores [269, 270, 272]. However, a European 
study which controlled for features of steatohepatitis found only 
lobular infammation, but not histologic ballooning or cirrhosis, 
to be associated with poorer HRQoL scores [273]. Regardless, 
there is a dearth of MAFLD PRO data in the Asian context 
and how cultural variation may nuance the PROs is not known.
Patient perspectives on quality of life, satisfaction, and 
compliance with lifestyle advice are critical to developing 
and evolving to a patient-centred approach to impact MAFLD 
outcomes. This is all the more important because of the integral role of lifestyle in disease pathogenesis. Studies in Asian 
populations evaluating the improvement of PROs and the 
trade-of thresholds for side efects during therapy are needed 
to better guide and strategize approaches to this disease.
• Patients with MAFLD appear to have worse HRQoL, 
physical, mental, and fatigue scores compared to 
patients with other causes of chronic liver disease 
such as hepatitis B and C (B2).
What is the role of patient reported outcomes 
in MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Patient perspectives on quality of life, satisfaction, and 
compliance are critical to developing a patient-centred 
approach to impact MAFLD outcomes (B2).
The pipeline of new treatments
The past few years have witnessed a steady increase in the 
number of drug targets for MAFLD as new information 
about its molecular pathogenesis unfolds. At the end of 
2019, it was estimated that there were 196 investigational 
candidate drugs for MAFLD in various stages of development [274]. The drugs that have so far progressed to phase 
3 development include obeticholic acid (OCA), elafbranor, 
selonsertib, cenicriviroc, resmetirom, and aramchol [275]. 
Several challenges remain for having a drug approved for 
MAFLD treatment. This includes the tremendous heterogeneity of the disease, and as well, performance bias or the 
Hawthorne efect where the placebo group provided with 
lifestyle and regular medical advice in a clinical trial setting 
impacts on histological and biochemical responses.
OCA is a farnesoid X receptor agonist whose potential 
actions include decreasing hepatic steatosis, infammation, 
and fbrosis and an increase of insulin sensitivity [276]. OCA 
is being tested at two diferent doses (10 mg/day and 25 mg/
day) in the ongoing phase 3 Randomized Global Phase 3 
Study to Evaluate the Impact on NASH with Fibrosis of 
Obeticholic Acid Treatment (REGENERATE) trial. This 
RCT is being conducted in ~ 2400 patients. The study has 
a dual primary endpoint consisting of resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of fbrosis and improvement of 
fbrosis by≥1 stage with no worsening of steatohepatitis. An 
interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial has shown that 
treatment with OCA 25 mg/day resulted in an improvement 
of fbrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis in 21.0% 
(p<0.001) of participants, whereas resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fbrosis was observed in 14.9% of 
patients (p=0.001) [275, 277]. The main adverse event of 
OCA was pruritus which occurred in 51% of patients in the 
25-mg group, 28% in the 10-mg group, and 19% in the placebo group. Notably, 9% of patients in the 25-mg group discontinued the drug because of pruritus. Over the 18-month 
trial duration, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis was observed 
in 3% (n=19) of patients in the 25-mg group, 1% (n=7) 
in the 10-mg group, and<1% (n=2) in the placebo group 
[277]. A caveat to the use of OCA is increases in serum lowdensity lipidprotein (LDL) and decreases in high-density 
lipidprotein (HDL), which may be partially countered by 
statin therapy [275, 278]. Although cirrhosis was an exclusion criterion for the REGENERATE trial [279], an ongoing 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 907
1 3
study (NCT03439254) is focusing on the dosing of OCA in 
patients with steatohepatitis and concomitant compensated 
cirrhosis. Recently, the FDA determined that the predicted 
beneft of OCA remains uncertain and did not warrant accelerated approval under subpart H.
Elafibranor, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor alpha/delta agonist (PPARα/δ) agonist was found 
to induce resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening 
of fbrosis in the GOLDEN Study 2b Trial [280]. The same 
endpoint is used as the primary outcome measure in the 
ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of elafbranor (RESOLVE-IT). 
Unfortunately, the study did not meet the predefned surrogate primary endpoint of steatohepatitis resolution without worsening of fbrosis, though the trial is ongoing. The 
study will also provide data on long-term outcomes including all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, and liver-related clinical 
endpoints.
Selonsertib, an inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating 
kinase-1 (ASK-1) showed promise in improving hepatic 
infammation and fbrosis in animal models and advanced to 
phase 3 (STELLAR-3 and -4) but was discontinued because 
it was not superior to placebo in both trials [281]. Cenicriviroc, a CCR2/CCR5 chemokine receptor blocker aims 
to reduce the drivers of infammation and fbrosis [282]. A 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study of cenicriviroc for the treatment of fbrosis in MAFLD 
(AURORA) is currently underway. The primary outcome is 
improvement of fbrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis. Resmetirom is a liver-directed, orally active, selective 
thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist designed to improve 
steatohepatitis by increasing hepatic fat metabolism and 
reducing lipotoxicity [283]. A phase 3 study in patients 
with advanced liver fbrosis, MAESTRO-NASH is ongoing 
with the primary endpoint being resolution of steatohepatitis 
after 1 year. Aramchol, a cholic-arachidic acid conjugate 
that inhibits stearoyl-CoA desaturase was initially produced 
for treatment of gallstones [284]. Aramchol 600 mg is currently being tested in a phase 3/4 study (ARMOR) to assess 
its efcacy and safety in subjects with steatohepatitis and 
fbrosis stages 2–3 who are overweight or obese and have 
prediabetes or T2DM. In addition to these phase 3 clinical 
trials, a number of early phase trials are underway. While 
target-based therapeutic agents are being developed based on 
new pathophysiological knowledge and the drug discovery 
pipeline in MAFLD has been promising, the results have 
been below expectations. A combination drug treatment 
strategy wherein several drivers of disease are simultaneously engaged could be more efective than targeting individual drivers, since redundancy is common in biological 
systems.
Future clinical trials should consider the mechanism of 
action of the drug, and as well better stratifcation of patients 
and standardization of lifestyle interventions, exercise, and 
diet between treatment arms. Further trials should consider 
innovative designs such as basket, adaptive or umbrella trials [28].
Special groups
Lean subjects with MAFLD often have visceral obesity, 
sarcopenia, and recent weight gain. They also have a higher 
prevalence of features of the metabolic syndrome compared to lean controls and can develop steatohepatitis and 
advanced fbrosis [285, 286]. A recent RCT from Hong 
Kong suggested that lifestyle intervention is efective in 
treating MAFLD even in non-obese patients. The amount 
of weight reduction needed to achieve remission was less 
than that for non-obese patients. By 6 years, non-obese 
patients remained more likely to maintain weight reduction 
and have ALT normalization [287]. Similar fndings were 
observed in a study from Turkey where 5% body weight 
loss induced MAFLD remission in both obese and lean 
patients with MAFLD [288]. Similarly, a small biopsy-based 
study revealed that 5% weight reduction is associated with 
improvement of steatohepatitis in non-obese patients, similar to that which is observed in obese patients [289]. Larger 
biopsy-based studies are required to confrm the fndings. 
Non-obese subjects are more likely than obese subjects to 
maintain weight reduction and normal liver enzymes in the 
long term [287]. Therefore, lifestyle intervention with regular exercise is efective in treating MAFLD and in improving 
overall ftness and metabolic co-morbidities irrespective of 
baseline BMI. A 3–5% weight reduction may be sufcient 
in lean MAFLD.
Pediatric MAFLD is the most common cause of liver 
disease in children and may represent a more severe phenotype that will beneft from early intervention. The management of MAFLD in children consists of treating the liver 
disease itself, but more importantly addressing the underlying obesity and the related comorbidities. The overall goal 
is to improve a child’s quality of life and reduce long-term 
metabolic, cardiovascular, and liver complications. Lifestyle changes (dietary interventions, physical activity, and 
nutritional and psychologic counselling) lead to signifcant 
improvements in BMI, aminotransferase levels, and hepatic 
steatosis in children with MAFLD [290]. While the efcacy of several medications including metformin, vitamin 
E, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and probiotics has 
been investigated in children, intensive lifestyle modifcation remains the only prevention and treatment strategy for 
pediatric MAFLD at this stage.

The Japan Study Group for MAFLD has performed a 
nationwide study and created a data mining-based prognostic algorithm for patients with MAFLD-related HCC [307]. 
The decision-tree revealed that the best profle comprised 
treatment with hepatectomy or radiofrequency ablation and 
a serum albumin level≥3.7 g/dL [307]. However, these need 
confrmation in other international cohorts.
What is the approach for management of special groups 
(non‑obese and pediatric) with MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Lifestyle intervention with regular exercise is efective 
in treating MAFLD and in improving overall ftness 
and metabolic co-morbidities irrespective of baseline 
BMI (B1).
• Lifestyle change (dietary interventions, physical activity, and nutritional and psychologic counselling) is the 
only prevention and treatment strategy for pediatric 
MAFLD, though benefcial efects on fbrosis are yet 
to be demonstrated. No efective and safe drug treatment for fbrosis in pediatric MAFLD has been proven 
(B1).
Management of MAFLD‑related HCC
The survival rate of patients with MAFLD-related HCC is 
similar to that from other etiologies [94, 291–294]. While 
a high prevalence of non-cirrhosis is a feature of MAFLDrelated HCC, patients with non-cirrhotic MAFLD-related 
HCC have a similar risk of mortality as cirrhotic patients 
with disease from other etiologies [94, 293–295]. Accordingly, metabolic risk factor modifcation signifcantly contributes to their optimum management.
High BMI is one of three criteria for MAFLD diagnosis and its negative impact on HCC-related mortality has 
been reported in western cohorts [296]. However, there is 
no association between high BMI and HCC-related mortality in Asian patients in a meta-analysis or in cohort studies [296–298]. The reason(s) for this discrepancy remain(s) 
unclear but sarcopenia could be a possible explanation. Sarcopenia is a prognostic factor for Asian patients with HCC 
[297, 299–305], while physical activity is reported to be 
associated with better survival in patients with HCC [306]. 
Thus, an important aspect of management is by considering 
body composition that includes body fat and skeletal muscle 
mass, when treating patients with HCC.
T2DM is another criteria for MAFLD in the context of 
hepatic steatosis. In this regard, an international cohort study 
demonstrated that metformin signifcantly reduced the risk 
of HCC in MAFLD patients with HbA1c levels above 7.0% 
[245]. A meta-analysis has also shown that metformin prolongs the survival of HCC patients with T2DM after the 
curative treatment of the cancer [246]. Thus, metformin may 
be a benefcial treatment along with life-style intervention, in 
MAFLD-related HCC patients with T2DM. Again, however, 
there are no prospective, randomized data to support this 
contention and thus no strong recommendation can be made.
What is the approach to management of MAFLD‑HCC?
Recommendations
• Control of diabetes and obesity could be benefcial in 
MAFLD-related HCC patients (B1).
• Metformin may be a benefcial treatment in MAFLDrelated HCC patients with T2DM (C2).
• Serum albumin level is a prognostic factor and 
nutritional therapy focusing on protein metabolism 
is important for the management of patients with 
MAFLD-related HCC (C2).
Liver transplantation for MAFLD
MAFLD has become an increasingly frequent indication for 
liver transplantation (LT) in the Asia–Pacifc region over the 
past decade, both as a sole etiologies or co-existing with other 
conditions [308–310]. With increasingly efective vaccination 
programs and anti-viral medication, it is likely that MAFLD 
will continue to increase as a LT indication. MAFLD transplant recipients are typically older, with a higher BMI and 
are more likely to have T2DM and hypertension than nonMAFLD recipients [311, 312]. Not surprisingly, MAFLD 
patients have a higher likelihood of underlying cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) which was up to 53% in one North American 
series of patients undergoing pre-LT coronary angiography 
[313]. Thus a careful CVD evaluation is mandatory as preexisting CVD along with age predicts post-LT cardiovascular 
events [314].
MAFLD patients have a 60% higher risk of developing a 
major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 30 days 
post-LT, and this predicts a lower post-LT survival [315]. Consequently, the United Network for Organ Sharing data suggests 
CVD-specifc mortality is increased in transplanted MAFLD 
patients relative to other etiologies, and relates to pre-existing 
risk factors for T2DM, renal impairment, and prior CVD 
[316]. MAFLD may also be associated with a pro-coagulant 
state with reports of an increased risk of portal vein thrombosis 
complicating transplantation [317, 318].

Hepatology International (2020) 14:889–919 909

Importantly, post-LT survival in MAFLD patients is equivalent to that from other etiologies, with 5-year overall survival 
rates of 73–79% [311, 319]. Infection (22–25%), and CVD 
(5–22%) were identifed as the commonest causes of post-LT 
death [311, 320]. Older age (> 60 years), female gender,higher 
MELD (> 23), and extremes of BMI (< 18.5 and > 40 kg/m2) 
were reported to predict post-LT death in the the European 
Liver Transplant Registry[311].
Recurrence of MAFLD in the graft is common, occurring 
in up to 90% of recipients [321]. A minority of patients have 
an accelerated disease course with graft cirrhosis developing 
in 2–4% of patients in less than a decade; however, death 
from graft cirrhosis is uncommon (0.2–3% of patients) [320, 
321]. Corticosteroids and calcineurin antagonists are wellestablished immunosuppressive regime in LT with known 
risks to exacerbate hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; hence the optimal regime in MAFLD recipients is 
unclear. Statins should be encouraged post-LT in those with 
dyslipidemia and/or pre-existing CVD and may be associated with a survival beneft [322].
used) for the non-invasive assessment of fbrosis. Patients 
with cirrhosis should be considered for surveillance for 
varices and HCC. Lifestyle intervention remains the cornerstone of management but it is expected that over the next 
decade, drug treatments will be approved and added to the 
armamentarium of therapeutic choices. Holistic patientcentred and multidisciplinary management approaches are 
required that focus on the amelioration of liver injury, treating the associated systemic metabolic dysfunction, while 
being aware of the importance of patient-reported outcomes.

What are the recommendations for liver transplantation 
in MAFLD?
Recommendations
• Post-transplant survival for MAFLD patients is equivalent to that of other liver diseases in appropriately 
selected patients. Liver transplantation should be 
considered for MAFLD patients with decompensated 
liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma (B1).
• Patients with MAFLD cirrhosis have a high prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and 
should be thoroughly evaluated prior to listing for 
transplantation (B1).
Conclusion
The APASL guidelines document for MAFLD (along with 
the criteria for diagnosis) is intended to provide assessment 
and management advice for the general as well as special 
populations with the disease. The burden of MAFLD is rapidly increasing in the Asia–Pacifc; in this region dual etiology disease particularly with viral hepatitis and alcohol is 
common. MAFLD is a leading cause of chronic liver disease 
and increasingly of HCC on the one hand and is a contributor to the various associated systemic complications such as 
T2DM, CVD, and CKD. Fibrosis is the major determinant 
of all the complications of MAFLD and liver biopsy remains 
the reference standard. However, various biomarkers and 
imaging modalities are available (and are being increasingly
