Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused significant mortality and has been 
declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The 
infection mainly presents as fever, cough, and breathing difficulty, 
and few patients develop very severe symptoms. The purpose of this 
review is to analyze the impact of the virus on the kidney. COVID-19 
infection causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is an independent risk 
factor for mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, direct viral damage, and immune-mediated damage play important roles in the pathogenesis. AKI in COVID-19 infection could be 
from the synergistic effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect 
and cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response. AKI caused 
in the viral infection has been analyzed from the available epidemiological studies. The proportion of patients developing AKI is significantly higher when they develop severe disease. Continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) is the most used blood purification technique when needed. The impact of COVID-19 infection on chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and renal transplant patients is also discussed 
in the manuscript. No vaccine has been developed against the 2019-
nCoV virus to date. The critical aspect of management is supportive 
care. Several investigative drugs have been studied, drugs approved 
for other indications have been used, and several clinical trials are 
underway across the globe. Recently remdesivir has received emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
in the USA for use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Prevention of the infection holds the key to management. The patients with 
underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
A series of pneumonia cases from unexplained etiology in 
Wuhan, China, since December 2019 has created the public 
health concern and resulted in the identification of the viral 
cause. The initial reports of this viral infection were traced to 
the Huanan seafood market, Wuhan, China, and the etiological agent was identified as coronavirus [1]. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 12, 2020 and has declared as 
public health emergency globally on January 30, 2020 [2]. The 
disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020 [3]. The International 
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated the etiological coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4]. The number of cases has been 
multiplying at an alarming rate globally, resulting in mortality, 
and WHO has declared COVID-19 as pandemic on March 11, 
2020 [5]. On May 2, 2020, there were 3.4 million confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 infection cases globally, and the number 
of reported deaths were 244,213 [6].
After SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome 
(MERS), COVID-19 is the third known zoonotic CoV infection, and all belong to the beta-CoV cluster [1]. There was no 
determination on the animal species carrying the nCoV. The 
preliminary studies showed that the nCoV is closely related to

the coronavirus isolated from bats, postulating the theory of 
possible transmission from bats to humans [1]. The genome 
homology sequence of SARS-nCoV and SARS-CoV was 
79.5%, and SARS-nCoV had high homology with bat CoV [7]. 
All the studies suggest the evidence strongly that the SARSnCoV might have originated from the bats, the intermediate 
host in transmission to humans yet to be ascertained. Ji et al 
have found that snakes are the wildlife repositories for the 
SARS-nCoV [8].
Various studies have reported the epidemiological data on 
SARS-nCoV. Most of the studies have shown that elderly patients are affected, higher male preponderance, and mortality is 
higher in the elderly with severe comorbid conditions [9]. The 
case fatality rate was estimated at 14-15%, depending on the 
case series described [9, 10]. The median incubation period is 
14 days, and the median time from the first symptom to death 
is less in the elderly [1]. Mode of transmission is through close 
contact with people who has an infection through respiratory 
droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes. Another 
possible mechanism is through infected surfaces and objects.
COVID-19 Infection and Incidence of Renal 
Failure
Epidemiological data revealed the severe illness rate of COVID-19 infection is as high as 25%, and even though the lungs 
are the main organs affected, the kidney is also one of the main 
organs affected in severe illness [11]. Acute kidney injury 
(AKI) was seen in 5-15% of the cases infected with SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, and had a higher mortality rate of 60-
90% as per the literature [12]. COVID-19 infection causes 
AKI and is an independent risk factor for mortality [13, 14]. 
It also impacts patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
patients on chronic replacement therapies, and patients with a 
kidney transplant. Mohamed et al [15] evaluated the contributing factors for developing AKI in 161 intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients. In this study incidence of AKI was 28%. Approximately 35% of the patients who developed AKI had a history 
of CKD stages 3 - 5. Twenty-eight percent of the patients with 
CKD stages 3 - 5 had no AKI [15].
Pathogenesis
After the SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, the S protein is 
cleaved and activated by transmembrane serine proteases family (TMPRSS), which allows the virus to release fusion peptide that aids in the membrane fusion [16].
Mechanism
AKI in COVID-19 infection could be from the synergistic 
effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokineinduced systemic inflammatory response. AKI is more pronounced in patients with severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those needing ICU admission. 
Other possible mechanisms of AKI could be from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to multiorgan failure and shock, and 
possible prerenal etiology from volume depletion secondary to 
decreased oral intake and high fever. Drug toxicity, hemodynamic insult, and contrast exposure can also play a role. The 
workup for AKI in COVID-19 infection should be similar to 
the other causes of AKI. Mohamed et al [15] discussed different etiologies of AKI in their study which include ischemic 
acute tubular injury, toxic acute tubular injury or combination 
of both, acute interstitial nephritis, de novo glomerular disease, 
pre-renal azotemia, and unspecified reasons. The contributing 
factors to different etiologies include hypotension, shock, rapid 
atrial fibrillation, prolonged volume depletion, rhabdomyolysis, toxic agents such as vancomycin, and iodinated contrast, 
overt proteinuria [15].
Direct viral damage
Prior studies have shown that positive SARS-CoV ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) polymerase gene fragments were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in kidney specimens of autopsy patients died from SARS [17]. MERS-CoV 
infections also have been shown to cause kidney epithelial cell 
damage by apoptosis mediated through receptors [18]. These 
studies suggest that the injury from coronavirus is a direct cytotoxic effect on kidney epithelial cells. Diao et al analyzed the 
kidney tissue in six patients on autopsy; immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
(NP) protein in the kidney tubule, possibly related to potential 
direct tubular injury from the virus [19]. The SARS-CoV-2 
RNA was detected in the urine of the patients by quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [20].
Role of ACE2 receptors
The normal human lung has type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells, which express ACE2 and is expressed in 83% of type 2 
cells. Men have a higher expression rate of ACE2 levels compared to women, and similarly, Asians express higher ACE2 
levels compared to white and African American populations 
[1]. The analysis by Xu et al found that ACE2 receptor expression in the kidney is no less than the lung on comparative 
analysis [16]. Podocytes and proximal convoluted tubule cells 
significantly co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS genes that are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. The kidney tissue expresses 
the ACE2 gene higher than that of lung tissue. The binding 
affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors is 10 - 20 times 
higher than SARS-CoV as described by Wrapp and colleagues 
[21].
Immune-mediated damage
The pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in COVID-19 infection and probable activation of T-cell response [9].

The possible occurrence of cytokine storm in severe cases is 
evidenced by the significantly higher cytokine levels. In the 
cytokine storm, the immune system damages healthy tissues 
rather than SARS-CoV-2 [16]. On the autopsies of six kidney 
tissues, the light microscopy revealed cluster of differentiation 
68 (CD68)+ macrophage infiltration of the tubulointerstitium 
and severe ATN. The tubules showed complement 5b-9 deposition in all six cases, but deposition in glomeruli and capillaries were seldom seen. Some CD8+ T lymphocyte cells and 
CD56+ (natural killer) cells were seen in kidney tissue [19].
COVID-19 Infection and AKI
Recently published studies in China showed that the incidence 
of AKI in patients infected with COVID-19 is around 3-15% 
[22, 23]. In patients with severe COVID-19 infection in ICU, 
the rates of AKI increased significantly to 14.5-50% [23, 24]. 
The variation in reporting the incidence of AKI depends on the 
number of patients, severity of infection, and reporting of AKI 
across the studies. The diagnosis of AKI based on kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) classification was 
summarized in Table 1 [25].
Cohort studies
Cheng and colleagues analyzed a large cohort of 710 patients 
for kidney disease with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 
Tongji Hospital from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020 
[22]. All the patients were above 18 years of age. Patients who 
have a history of renal transplant and on maintenance dialysis 
were excluded from the study. The baseline serum creatinine 
was elevated in 110 patients on admission.
The patients in the elevated serum creatinine group were 
elderly, had a higher percentage of males, and the days from 
onset of illness to hospital admission were shorter. These patients also had severe disease and co-morbidities compared to 
those with normal baseline serum creatinine. These patients 
had more pronounced AKI and higher rates of mechanical ventilation, and the hospital mortality rate was higher.
Patients with elevated serum creatinine also had leukocytosis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated 
partial thromboplastin time, and higher D-dimer levels. The 
patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine had a higher 
percentage of increased procalcitonin, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactic dehydrogenase levels.
Most of the AKI occurred within 7 days, but was much 
quicker and severe in elevated baseline serum creatinine group. 
Patients with normal baseline creatinine had later onset of AKI 
and recovered quickly. There was elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, high-grade proteinuria, and hematuria 
in elevated baseline serum creatinine patients along with significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
There was a significant gap between peak and baseline creatinine in the elevated serum creatinine group. Patients with 
elevated serum creatinine from baseline had worse outcomes 
compared to patients with normal baseline serum creatinine.
The study by Li et al [14] analyzed 59 cases of inpatients 
from multiple hospitals around Wuhan from January 21, 2020 
to February 7, 2020 with COVID-19 disease, and 28 patients 
were diagnosed with severe cases according to the Chinese 
Nation Health guidance. Three of the patients died in the severe cases [14]. Proteinuria was present in 63% of the patients, 
and many of them had detected protein on the first day of admission, suggesting the presence of prior renal impairment. 
BUN was elevated in 27% of the patients, and an also higher 
level of BUN was present in two patients who died. Serum 
creatinine was elevated in 19% of the patients, and the patients 
who died had extremely high levels. The density was reduced 
on the computed tomography (CT) images of the kidney suggestive of edema and inflammation.
In a study by Wang et al [26], the patients needing ICU 
admission had higher BUN and creatinine levels at hospital admission compared to non-ICU admission patients and overall 
patients in general. The BUN and creatinine levels continued 
to get worse in non-survivors until the death [26].
We summarized the finding from multiple studies including patient characteristics, co-morbidities, incidence of AKI in 
general as well as ICU/severely ill patients, number of patients 
requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mortality in 
Table 2 [9-11, 13, 19, 22-24, 26-32].
Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) in hospital
In the patients who developed AKI from COVID-19 infection, 
around 1.5-9% of them required RRT in the form of CRRT 
[26, 28]. The proportion of patients needing RRT increased to 
5.2-25% with severe infection [11, 27]. As per the international 
experts, in severe COVID-19 cases with hypoxemic respiraTable 1. Diagnosis of AKI Was Based on the KDIGO Classification

tory failure along with renal or liver dysfunction, ECMO with 
or without CRRT, can be used. CRRT is the most used blood 
purification modality in clinical practice, but for severe COVID-19 patients with sepsis and ARDS, hemoperfusion/plasma 
adsorption treatment can also be selected to clear more inflammatory mediators [33].
Recommendations on the care of hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 and kidney failure needing RRT from the 
American Society of Nephrology (ASN) was summarized below [34].
General measures
All the health care personnel should follow the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety guidelines during 
their interactions with the patients. All the health care personnel should work as a team to limit the exposure to the infection. Indications for RRT are similar to other patients with 
AKI, and providers with significant expertise should place 
dialysis catheters.
Patients in ICU
The patients should be cohorted in dedicated ICUs, if possible. The preferred dialysis modality is CRRT or slow, low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) if available. Intermittent hemodialysis 
(IHD) can also be performed if CRRT and SLED are not available. CRRT is preferred over IHD in the setting of isolation, as 
IHD needs one-on-one nursing support. The patients needing 
CRRT exceeds the machines available, prolonged intermittent 
treatments (e.g., 10 h instead of continuous) with higher flow 
rates (e.g., 40 - 50 mL/kg/h) and after terminal cleaning, can be 
used for another patient.
Patients in general hospital floors
The patients should be cohorted on the dedicated floor, if possible. Patients with active or suspected COVID-19 needing 
dialysis treatment should not be transported to a central acute 
dialysis unit. IHD should be provided with one-on-one nursing 
care if the patient is in negative pressure room. If all the COVID-19 patients are isolated on one floor, one dialysis nurse may 
be able to monitor two or three patients during IHD if video/ 
electronic monitoring is available. The nurse enters the room if 
the patient needs anything or to troubleshoot the machine. The 
peritoneal dialysis can be continued as automated peritoneal 
dialysis (APD) to limit the exposure of medical staff.
Care and disinfection of RRT equipment
The dialysis equipment should be cleaned with the disinfectant before removing it from the room. Hospital infection control and policy directs the proper disposable of RRT machine 
equipment. As per the hospital protocol, CRRT filters need to 
be changed every 72 h or longer.
Continuous venovenous hemofiltration, also known as 
CVVH or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are the preferred techniques. In the USA, continuous 
venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is the most common modality used. Volume overloaded patients can be treated using 
slow continuous ultra-filtration (SCUF) to keep fluid balance 
net negative [35].
Temporary dialysis catheters are recommended for the 
vascular access and the providers with significant expertise 
should place dialysis catheters. It is recommended to use 
double-layered protection for the personnel performing the 
procedure. Filters with high ultrafiltration coefficient and high 
molecular weight cut-off membrane with 8 - 10 nm membrane 
pore size are suggested [36]. This would help in clearing high 
molecular weight inflammatory mediators. However, albumin 
would need to be replaced as it can be removed concurrently. 
It is essential to assess the patient’s bleeding risk before choosing anti-coagulation. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection 
having high bleeding risk, it is recommended to avoid anticoagulation. In normal or hypercoagulable states, one can use 
heparin or citrate-based anticoagulation depending on hospital 
protocols. When using CRRT in combination with ECMO, anticoagulation is not needed as ECMO utilizes systemic heparinization [35].
It is essential to pay a very close attention to hemodynamics and volume status of patients with COVID-19 infection 
by using arterial and central venous pressure (CVP) monitors. 
Patients should have frequent renal panels checks every 4 - 6 
h and monitor strict input and output to maintain a net negative fluid balance in ARDS patients. In patients without ARDS, 
the volume status should be assessed to maintain in euvolemic 
state.
The patients should be monitored for recovery of kidney 
function on daily basis, and the RRT should be discontinued 
once the patient is non-oliguric, euvolemic and improved 
ventilation requirements. This should also be supported by 
improved laboratory findings without alarming electrolyte or 
acid-base imbalance.
Strategies to limit AKI
AKI was associated with increased in-hospital mortality, so the 
patient should be meticulously managed by providing hemodynamic support, avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), nephrotoxins, and contrast. Early institution 
of CRRT will improve the outcomes. Proteinuria and hematuria were also associated with in-hospital mortality, so close 
attention should be paid to urine analysis, both in-patient and 
out-patient settings.
AKI and mortality with COVID-19 infection
The experience from various published studies on patients infected with COVID-19 infection showed that AKI is associ-

ated with mortality. Shi et al analyzed 101 patients who died 
from COVID-19 infection showed that 23% had AKI and 11% 
of patient had underlying CKD. BUN and myoglogin levels 
were higher in patients who died within 3 days and median 
time from hospitalization to death is 4 days [37]. Cheng in his 
analysis showed that elevated baseline serum creatinine, elevated BUN, peak serum creatinine > 1.5, proteinuria, hematuria, AKI stages 2 and 3 are all associated with mortality after 
adjusting for confounding factors [22].
COVID-19 Infection and CKD
The impact of COVID-19 infection on CKD has not been reported. The incidence of known CKD patients varied from 0.7-
47.6%, depending upon the series described [27, 29]. There 
was increased mortality in patients described in one study [29]. 
The incidence of AKI was higher in patients with established 
CKD [22].
The studies analyzed the kidney function in patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 infection revealed the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria [14, 22]. A significant 
number of patients had proteinuria on the day of admission, 
which could be related to the cytotropic effects of the virus 
on the podocytes. Proteinuria may result from direct podocyte 
injury from an expression of ACE2 [16].
The patients who recovered from the COVID-19 infection 
with proteinuria and hematuria need to be followed closely for 
the resolution. The patients who have sustained AKI during the 
infection need to be monitored for CKD.
Renal Transplant and COVID Infection
The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has amassed great concern worldwide, but its influence on transplant recipients is 
unknown. Previously experienced coronavirus outbreaks have 
taught us that transplant recipients can be easily affected by 
these infections [38, 39]. With this being said, very little is 
known about the risk of the donor to receive transmission of 
the disease. Several factors concerning donor exposure like infectivity, incubation period, etc., can play an important role. 
Although there are no strict guidelines about donor restrictions, it would be advisable for potential donors to hold off 
on organ donation if suffering from a respiratory illness. The 
American Red Cross and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommend 28-day and 21-day period delay respectively for potential organ donors with a history 
of recent travel to high-risk areas or contact with a person with 
suspected or proven COIVD-19 [40, 41]. The ECDC recommends a 28-day delay after recovery from a confirmed infection. Michaels and colleagues recently well described possible 
risks associated with transplants in COVID-19-positive recipients [42]. Andrea et al from Italy described in their experience 
that in their institution, they have been limiting liver transplantation to the most urgent cases for the residents in the epidemic 
area [43].
A more liberal allocation policy is used for patients outside epidemic areas. However, all recipients are screened to 
avoid transplantation in SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. The 
internal board consistently reviews and updates the transplant 
list every 2 weeks according to the new insights on COVID-19. 
They continuously train their healthcare providers and screen 
them with nasopharyngeal swabs at frequent intervals. Providing timely information to patients and their caregivers to raise 
awareness and at the same time to avoid panic and confusion 
is important [43].
As per the review of the literature to the best of our knowledge, only one case of COVID-19 infection has been described 
in kidney transplant recipients of 12 years [44]. The patient 
was successfully managed initially with the cessation of all 
immunosuppression. He was given intravenous stress dose 
steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Once the patient improved clinically, immunosuppression was resumed gradually. 
The overall clinical characteristics, including the symptoms, 
radiological findings on lung imaging, and laboratory findings, 
were similar to those of other non-transplanted adult patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonia. This being the only case reported 
so far, it is difficult to say that it is not possible to see atypical 
findings or more severe presentations of COVID-19 disease in 
transplant recipients.
Healthcare providers should be aware of that the experimental drugs like remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir could 
cause drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors [42]. 
It is therefore recommended to use these drugs with extreme 
caution. Regarding the treatment of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection, there is not much information 
available to help guide therapy and immunosuppression regimens. For now, it would be recommended to use due diligence 
and tailor management and treatment options based on the patient’s clinical status, duration of transplant, and severity of 
illness. As the pandemic progresses, we now expect that we 
will have more information available for guidance.
Treatment
No vaccine has been developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
to date. The critical aspect of management is supportive care. 
Multiple treatments such as empiric antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and systemic corticosteroids have been used worldwide. 
Several investigative drugs have been studied, drugs approved 
for other indications have been used, and several clinical trials 
are underway all across the globe.
One of the most promising of these therapies is remdesivir. It inhibits viral replication by premature termination of 
RNA transcription, and has shown activity against beta coronaviruses and in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 [45]. It has 
received emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the USA for use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. It is recommended for 5 days in patients 
who are not on mechanical ventilation or ECMO, and recommended for 10 days in patients who are on mechanical ventilation or ECMO [46]. It is not recommended in patients with 
lower GFR (GFR < 30 mL/min) [47].
Others drug that has gained more attention was chloro-

quine, hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with 
azithromycin. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both have 
in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 [45]. They are both used 
in several countries for treating COVID-19 infection based on 
anecdotal data and in-vitro studies. There was a news report 
from China, where chloroquine increased viral clearance, decreased disease progression, and improved radiological findings [47, 48]. There was another clinical trial reported from 
France, which is a non-randomized open-label trial of 36 patients compared to hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin versus standard of care in 
the control group. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and 
azithromycin in six patients resulted in superior viral clearance 
compared with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy [49]. There 
was a recent study among 368 veterans, which found no benefit 
of hydroxychloroquine but associated with more risks due to its 
side effect profile [50]. These medications should be used with 
caution in patients with renal and hepatic impairment, and they 
can cause QT prolongation in the electrocardiogram.
Hydroxychloroquine use for pre and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently 
under investigation. Several clinical trials are planned in the 
USA to test the usage of hydroxychloroquine for treatment 
and prophylaxis for COVID-19. Clinicians are using different 
doses of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and treatment.
A recent clinical trial in China did not show the efficacy of 
lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of pneumonia for COVID-19 patients, but this trial was underpowered [30]. WHO 
launched a global mega trial called SOLIDARITY of four 
most promising coronavirus treatments (remdesivir; chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; ritonavir/lopinavir; ritonavir/
lopinavir and interferon beta) [51].
When antiretroviral medications for coronavirus treatment 
are used like lopinavir and ritonavir, dose adjustments to medications during CRRT are not needed, as they are 90% protein 
bound. Particular attention should be paid to the dosing of the 
drugs.
Other drugs are interferon beta, interferon alpha, mefloquine, favipiravir, darunavir, ribavirin, umifenovir, tocilizumab, and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMSPSS2) 
inhibitors. Support to therapies using vitamin A, B, C, D, E, 
thymosin alpha 1, thymopentin, Selenium, zinc and pyrithione combination have been used for treatment against SARSCOV-2 infection [47, 52].
Conclusions
COVID-19 infection is spreading rapidly and causing mortality daily worldwide. Unfortunately, knowledge about the novel 
virus is limited, and it causes a significant clinical threat to the 
general population and healthcare workers. Several countries 
have imposed strict regulations on the public to limit the spread 
of the virus. Many government agencies like CDC, FDA, and 
hospitals, public health systems are working every day in the 
USA to contain the spread of infection.
Studies have shown that there is the involvement of kidneys with COVID-19 infection and can be associated with 
high mortality. Health care providers should recognize this aspect early, and appropriate management should be instituted 
as soon as possible. The patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing 
COVID-19 infection.
There is limited understanding of the pathogenesis of the 
disease, virulence of the virus at this moment, so prevention 
is the critical aspect in the management. Several vaccines and 
promising treatments are undergoing clinical trials with the 
hope of finding a cure for this global crisis soon.
