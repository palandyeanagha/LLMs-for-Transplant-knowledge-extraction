Abstract
Accumulating evidence suggests that Th17 cells play a role in the development of chronic allograft injury in transplantation
of various organs. However, the influence of current immunosuppressants on Th17-associated immune responses has not
been fully investigated. We prospectively investigated the changes in Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) collected before and 1 and 3 months after KT in 26 patients and we investigated the suppressive effect of
tacrolimus on Th17 in vitro. In the early posttransplant period, the percentage of Th17 cells and the proportion of IL-17-
producing cells in the effector memory T cells (TEM) were significantly increased at 3 months after transplantation
compared with before transplantation (P,0.05), whereas Th1/Th2 cells and TEM cells were significantly decreased. The
degree of increase in Th17 during the early posttransplant period was significantly associated with allograft function at 1
year after transplantation (r = 0.4, P,0.05). In vitro, tacrolimus suppressed Th1 and Th2 cells in a concentration-dependent
manner, but did not suppress Th17 cells even at high concentration. This suggests that current immunosuppression based
on tacrolimus is inadequate to suppress Th17 cells in KTRs, and dysregulation of Th17 may be associated with the
progression of CAD.

Introduction
After kidney transplantation, alloimmune responses by CD4+ T
cell activation mediate most cases of allograft rejection [1].
Therefore, most immune suppressants have been developed to
downregulate the activation and differentiation of effector CD4+
T cells to prevent the generation of these alloimmune responses
[2,3]. The most widely used immunosuppressive protocol is
composed of tacrolimus (Tac), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and
steroids. In addition, induction therapy with basiliximab has been
used to suppress the robust T cell activation developed immediately after kidney transplantation.
The Tac-based immunosuppressive protocol has been shown to
be more effective in preventing the development of acute rejection
episodes and improving 1 year allograft survival than the
previously used regimen based on azathioprine and steroids [4].
During the early posttransplant period, in which most robust
immune reactions develop, most effector T cell subsets are
effectively suppressed by the current immunosuppressive protocol,
which may result in the significant improvement in short-term
clinical outcomes. In contrast, long-term allograft survival has not
improved significantly compared with that in the azathioprine era
[5,6].
Th17 is a third subset of effector T cells and is characterized by
the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 [7,8].
Ongoing studies have demonstrated that Th17 cells are involved
in the driving of immune processes previously thought to be
exclusively Th1 mediated [9,10,11,12]. In addition, accumulating
evidence suggests that Th17 cells may play a role in the
development of chronic allograft injury in various types of organ
transplantation [13,14,15,16,17]. However, the effect of Tac on
Th17-associated immune responses has not been fully investigated.
In this study, we prospectively and sequentially investigated the
changes in immune cell subsets, including Th17, in renal
transplant recipients during the early posttransplant period, during
which most significant changes in immune reactivity develop, and
evaluated the relationship of the change in Th17 cells with 1-year
allograft function. Second, we investigated the percentage of Th17
cells in another renal transplant recipient group with long-term
follow-up, comparing patients with normal allograft function and
those with chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). Third, we tested
the effect of Tac on each effector T cell subset in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Patients and clinical information
The patient population comprised of 26 living-donor renal
transplant recipients (RTRs). Second transplants, highly sensitized
patients and ABO-incompatible kidney transplants were excluded
from this study because they were treated with modified or
intensified immune suppressant protocols. For the included
patients, the initial immunosuppressant was Tac in combination
with MMF and prednisolone. Basiliximab was used as additional
induction therapy at 2 hours before transplantation and on day 4
after transplantation. The initial dose of Tac was 0.16 mg/kg per
day orally, and target trough levels were 8–12 ng/mL during the
first 3 months and 3–8 ng/mL afterward (Figure 1). Methylprednisolone (1 g/day) was administered by intravenous infusion on
the day of transplantation and was tapered to prednisolone at
30 mg/day on day 4 after transplantation. The initial dose of
MMF was 1.5 g/day and the dose was modified to minimize
adverse effects such as diarrhea or leukopenia. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected for the analysis before
the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, and at around 1
month and 3 months after transplantation.
We followed all RTRs for at least 1 year from transplantation.
We calculated the differences between the Th17 percentage before
transplantation and at 3 months post transplant, calling this
DTh17. We evaluated whether DTh17 had a significant association with the 1-year allograft function to investigate the clinical
impact of the changes in Th17 during the early post-transplant
period.
We enrolled another patient group who were being treated with
Tac (n = 16) with a long-term follow-up (9.5 years (5.1–13.1)) and
who showed stable allograft function without significant change
(.20% from baseline) and no acute rejection for at least the past 1
year. These patients comprised two groups that were matched for
age and post-transplant duration. One group, designated as the no
CAD group (n = 8), was comprised of 8 patients who have showed
favorable allograft function (MDRD eGFR higher than 60 mL/
min/1.73 m2
) since KT and have showed the change of eGFR
within 20% of the value at 1 year from KT. Another 8 patients
who have showed gradually deteriorated allograft function since
KT (decrease of eGFR more than 20% compared to the value at 1
year from KT) and MDRD eGFR at enrollment was lower than
60 mL/min/1.73 m2
. All patients in CAD group took at least 1
time of allograft biopsy during follow up and allograft tissue
showed chronic change (Interstitial fibrosis/Tubular atrophy score
(IF/TA) $2). We compared the proportion of Th1, Th2 and
Th17 cells in the CD4+ T cell populations of the two groups to
investigate the clinical impact of Th17 on chronic allograft injury.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(KC10SISI0235) of the Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, and we
obtained written informed consent from all patients and all
clinical investigations have been conducted according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Isolation of human cells
PBMC were prepared from heparinized blood by Ficoll–
Hypaque (GE Healthcare, PA) density-gradient centrifugation.
Cell cultures were performed as described previously [18]. In brief,
the cell suspension was adjusted to a concentration of 106
/ml in
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM Lglutamine. The cell suspension (1 mL) was dispensed into 24-well
multiwell plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). For cytokine detection at the single-cell level, PBMC were stimulated with 50 ng/mL
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 mg/mL ionomycin for 4 h.
Flow cytometric analysis
Flowcytometic study of PBMC was done within a few hours
after the sampling of peripheral blood as a fresh state. For analysis
of human intracellular cytokine production, PBMC were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 4 hours. For intracellular staining,
cells were stained with combinations of the following mAbs: CD4–
PE/Cy7 (RPA-T4, IgG1; BioLegend, San Diego, CA); CD45RA–
FITC (HI100, IgG2b, k; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and
CD25–APC (M-A251, IgG1, k; Pharmingen). Staining for
chemokine receptors was performed using the following mouse
mAbs (all produced by Pharmingen): anti-CCR4 (1G1, IgG1),
anti-CCR6 (11A9, IgG1) and anti-CCR7 (3D12, IgG2a, k). Cells
were washed, fixed, permeabilized and stained to detect intracellular cytokines with mAbs to IL-17 (PE, eBio64dec17, IgG1, k;
eBioscience, San Diego, CA); interferon (IFN)-c (FITC, 4S.B3,
IgG1, k; eBioscience); IL-4 (APC, MP4-25D2, IgG1, k;
eBioscience); IL-17 (FITC (eBio64DEC17, IgG1, k; eBioscience);
Foxp3 (FITC, PCH101, IgG2a, k; eBioscience) and IFN-c (PE,
B27, IgG1, k; Pharmingen). Appropriate isotype controls were
used for gate setting for cytokine expression. Cells were analyzed
on a FACS Calibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences).
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)
After incubation of PBMC for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin,
mRNA was extracted using RNAzol B (Biotex Laboratories,
Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Reverse transcription of 2 mg of total mRNA was performed at
42uC using the SuperscriptTM reverse transcription system (Takara,
Shiga, Japan). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a
20 mL final volume in capillary tubes in a LightCycler instrument

(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction mixture
contained 2 mL of LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master Mix for
SYBRH Green I (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 mM of each primer,
4 mM MgCl2 and 2 mL of template DNA. All capillaries were
sealed, centrifuged at 5006g for 5 s, and then amplified in a
LightCycler instrument with activation of polymerase (95uC for
10 min), followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95uC, 10 s at 60uC (b-actin)
or 57uC (IL-1beta, HMGB-1), and 10 s at 72uC. The temperature
transition rate was 20uC/s for all steps. The double-stranded PCR
product was measured during the 72uC extension step by detection
of fluorescence associated with the binding of SYBR Green I to the
product. Fluorescence curves were analyzed with LightCycler
software v. 3.0 (Roche Diagnostics). The LightCycler was used to
quantify IL-1beta and HMGB-1 mRNA. The relative expression
level of each sample was normalized to the endogenously expressed
housekeeping gene (b-actin). Melting curve analysis was performed
immediately after the amplification protocol under the following
conditions: 0 s (hold time) at 95uC, 15 s at 71uC, and 0 s (hold time)
at 95uC. The rate of temperature change was 20uC/s, except for
0.1uC/s in the final step. The crossing point (Cp) was defined as the
maximum of the second derivative from the fluorescence curve.
Negative controls were also included and contained all the elements
of the reaction mixture except template DNA. All samples were
processed in duplicate.

Th17 Cells during Early Post-Transplant Period
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e42011

Suppressive effect of TAC on Th0 or Th17 cells in vitro
Isolated PBMC cells (56105) from healthy people were
incubated under appropriate conditions to stimulate Th0 cells
for 48 h. Anti-CD3 (1 mg/mL) and anti-CD28 (1 mg/mL) were
used to differentiate Th0 cells. Anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml), anti-CD28
(1 mg/ml), IL-1b (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (20 ng/ml) and IL-23 (20 ng/
ml) were added to stimulate the differentiation of Th17 cells. For
analysis of the suppressive effect of Tac, PBMC from healthy
people and renal transplant recipients were preincubated for 1 h
in the presence of Tacrolimus and stimulated with Th0 or Th17-
polarizing condition for 48 h. Neutralizing antibodies to IFNgamma (2 mg/ml) and IL-4 (2 mg/ml) were added in some
experiments (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version
16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The comparison of values before
transplantation and at 1 month and 3 months after transplantation
was made using a paired t-test or one-way analysis of variance. For
categorical variables, chi-square frequency analysis was used. The

Results
Baseline characteristics of patient population
The age at transplantation was 42.8611.6 years. Eighteen patients
were male and eight female. The HLA mismatch number was
3.261.8 and all cases were first kidney transplants. Thirteen patients
(50.0%) were on hemodialysis and five patients (19.2%) on peritoneal
dialysis before transplantation and the duration of dialysis was
13.7618.8 months. Eight patients (30.8%) took preemptive transplantation. The most common cause of end-stage renal disease was
chronic glomerulonephritis (11 patients, 42.3%) followed by diabetes
mellitus (five patients, 19.2%), hypertension (five patients, 19.2%).
Eighteen cases (69.2%) were living-related donor transplants and
eight (30.8%) were living-unrelated donor transplants (Table 1).
Changes in lymphocytes and total CD4+ T cells at 1
month and 3 months after transplantation
As shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, there was a decrease in the
percentage of lymphocytes after transplantation (1 month:
60.0615.3%; 3 months: 64.1613.6%) compared with before
transplantation (70.5615.0%), but this did not reach statistical
significance (P.0.05) (Figure 2A). The percentage of CD4+ T cells
showed no significant change at 1 month (41.2%610.0%) and 3
months (43.7611.6%) after transplantation compared with before
transplantation (39.8613.2%, P.0.05) (Figure 2B).
Changes in Th1, Th2 and regulatory T cell subsets at 1
month and 3 months after transplantation
Before transplantation, 23.368.8% of CD4+ T cells were also
IFN-c+ (Th1). At 1 month after transplantation, this had not
changed significantly (19.869.6%, P = 0.111), but after 3 months,
it had significantly decreased to 17.969.1% (P = 0.02 vs. before
transplant) (Figure 2C). The percentage of IL-4+
/CD4+T cells
(Th2) was 3.661.8% before transplantation, and decreased
significantly to 2.461.2% at 1 month after transplantation
(P = 0.007) and 2.661.0% at 3 months after transplantation
(P = 0.04) (Figure 2D). The percentage of CD25+
FoxP3+/CD4+ T
cells (Treg) did not change at either 1 month (5.261.7%, P = 0.07)
or 3 months (5.962.1%, P = 0.484) after transplantation compared with before transplantation (6.562.6%) (Figure 2E). The
percentage of IL-17+
/CD4+ T cells (Th17) significantly increased
after transplantation. Before transplantation, it was 1.960.7% and
it increased to 2.261.0% (P = 0.04) at 1 month and 2.660.8% at 3
months (P = 0.008) after transplantation (Figure 2F).
Changes in Th17 and IL-17-related T cell subsets at 1
month and 3 months after transplantation
Before transplantation, the percentage of CCR7+CD45RA+/
CD4+ T cells (Tnaive/CD4+ T cells) was 34.1610.3% and this did
not change significantly at 1 month (32.3611.1%, P = 0.702) and
3 months (35.3612.3%, P = 0.594) after transplantation
(Figure 3A). CCR7+
CD45RA2/CD4+ T cell (TCM/CD4+ T cells)
also did not change significantly after transplantation (TCM:
42.469.8% before transplantation, 46.7612.2% at 1 month after
transplantation, P = 0.298, 46.969.9% at 3 months, P = 0.257)
(Figure 3C). In contrast, CCR72CD45RA2/CD4+ T cells (TEM/
CD4+ T cells) were significantly decreased after transplantation
(17.069.3% before transplantation, 14.867.5% at 1 month after
transplantation, P = 0.064, 10.965.0% at 3 months, P = 0.002)
(Figure 3E). The percentage of IL-17-producing cells in TCM and
Tnaive showed no significant change at 1 month (TCM: 7.065.7%,
P = 0.32; Tnaive: 1.860.9%, P = 0.15) and 3 months (TCM:
5.763.7%, P = 0.84; Tnaive: 1.7460.8%, P = 0.20) after transplantation compared with before transplantation (TCM: 5.764.2%,
Tnaive: 1.460.9%) (Figure 3B, 3D). The percentage of IL-17
producing cells in TEM was 4.263.2% before transplantation and
increased to 6.763.2% at 1 month (P = 0.021) and 3 months
(6.163.7%, P = 0.353) after transplantation (Figure 3F).
Change in expression of markers associated with the
development of Th17 cells at 1 month and 3 months
after transplantation
After PBMC were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, the
expression of mRNA for IL-1beta and HMGB1 was determined
using real-time polymerase chain reaction. As shown in Figure 4,
the expression of IL-1beta mRNA was not suppressed at 1 month
(1.560.9) and 3 months (2.461.6) after transplantation compared
with before transplantation (1.360.8) but rather showed a
tendency to increase (at 1 month, P = 0.612; at 3 months,
P = 0.09) (Figure 4A). The expression of HMGB1 mRNA also
showed a trend to increase at 1 month (1.260.8) and 3 months
Figure 4. Expression of IL-1beta, and HMGB1 associated with Th17 cell at 1 and 3 month after transplantation compared to before

PMA and ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop. PBMC from all groups were treated as described in Figure 1 and Materials and Methods. The
expression of IL-1beta (A), HMGB1(B) mRNA was measured using real-time PCR. Bars show the means.

(1.360.7) after transplantation compared with before transplant
(1.160.5) (at 1 month P = 0.60; at 3 months, P = 0.36) (Figure 4B).
Relationship of long-term allograft function with the
changes in immune cell subsets
Figure 5 shows the association between Th17 and allograft
function at 1 year after transplantation. It shows that the increase
of Th17 after transplantation is negatively correlated with allograft
function at 1 year post transplant (r= 0.45, P = 0.02) (Figure 5A).
In contrast, Th1 (r = 0.00, P = 0.86) and Th2 (r = 0.00, P = 0.50)
cells showed no significant correlation with allograft function 1
year post transplant. The median value of DTh17 was 1.08%
(21.06 to 3.26). The patients with DTh17.1.08 were designated
the DTh17-high group and those with DTh17,1.08 were the
DTh17-low group; comparison of the two groups showed that
allograft function was significantly poorer in DTh17-high patients
at 1 year post transplant (Figure 5B).
Comparison of Th17 cell levels in patients with and
without chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD)
In another cohort, which was at least 5 years after transplantation, we evaluated the proportion of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in the
CD4+ T cells and compared them in patients with and without
CAD. The serum creatinine (Scr) in the group without CAD (n = 8)
was 0.960.1 mg/dL and the MDRD eGFR was 73.368.7 mL/
min/1.73 m2
. In the group with CAD (n = 8), Scr was 1.860.3 mg/
dL (P,0.01 vs. patients without CAD) and MDRD eGFR was
37.0614.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P,0.01 vs. patients without CAD).
The duration of follow-up (9.661.9 years vs. 9.762.4 years,
P= 0.88) and age at sampling (50.3610.3 years vs. 48.9611.4 years,
P= 0.74) were matched between the two groups (Table 2). The
percentage of Th17 cells was significantly higher in the group with
CAD (3.161.3%) than in the group without CAD (1.960.7%)
(P,0.01) (Figure 5C). In contrast, Th1 (16.567.0% vs.
19.5610.5%, P= 0.38) and Th2 (1.861.0% vs. 1.761.4%,
P= 0.85) showed no significant differences between the groups.
Effects of Tac on Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subpopulations
of CD4+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of

We used flow cytometry to examine how Tac regulates in vitro
Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subpopulations of CD4+ T lymphocytes. PBMC were preincubated for 1 h in the presence of Tac
and stimulated with 1 mg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 48 h.
As shown in Figure 6A, the percentage of Th1 cells in the blood
was significantly lower by Tac. The values were 28.760.3 (antiCD3 and anti-CD28), 25.266.3% in the CD3, anti-CD28 and
Tac 0.1 ng/ml (P = 0.429 compared with anti-CD3 and antiCD28), 10.060.2% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 1 ng/ml
(P = 0.0001 compared with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28). As shown
in Figure 6B, the percentage of Th2 cells in the blood was
significantly lower in anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 cultured cells by
Tac. The values were 1.460.5 (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28),
0.360.1% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 0.1 ng/ml
(P = 0.03 compared with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28),
0.0960.05% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 1 ng/ml
(P = 0.03 compared with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28), and
0.0160.004% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 10 ng/ml
(P = 0.009 compared with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28). By contrast,
the frequency of Th17 cells did not differ significantly by Tac (antiCD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 0.1 ng/ml, 1.360.2%, anti-CD3, antiCD28 and Tac 1 ng/ml, 1.260.05%). The frequency of Treg cells
was also significantly lower in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 cultured
cells by Tac. The values were 36.265.8 (anti-CD3 and antiCD28), 31.368.4% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 0.1 ng/
ml (P = 0.09 compared with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28),
21.065.8% in the anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Tac 1 ng/ml
(P = 0.02 compared with the anti-CD3, anti-CD28). We tested
the effect of Tac on Th17 in early-post transplant recipients in
Th17 condition and Th17 was not suppressed in high doses of Tac
(Figure 7).

Discussion
This report is a prospective and sequential study investigating
the immunologic parameters in a group of living-related renal
allograft recipients who took Tac-based immune suppression.
Most effector T cell subsets were decreased after transplantation
because of the effect of the immune suppressant, but Th17 and IL17-producing effector memory T cells were not suppressed and
even showed a trend toward increasing after transplantation. This
suggests that current immune suppressant treatments are not
enough to suppress the alloimmune reaction, especially Th17-
related immune responses.
Most immunosuppressive drugs have been selected and
developed according to their ability to control T lymphocyte
activation [3]. Under triple therapy composed of Tac, MMF and
steroids, most T cell types can be efficiently suppressed. In
addition, induction therapy using basiliximab, an anti-CD25
monoclonal antibody, can successfully prevent the robust proliferation of T cells [3]. Tac is effective in preventing Th1- and Th2-
associated alloimmune responses, and addition of MMF can
suppress humoral responses that are associated with the Th2
pathway [19,20,21]. In this study, total lymphocytes and CD4+ T
cells did not show significant changes under immune suppressant
treatment, but effector T cells, especially Th1 and Th2 cells,
showed significant decreases at 1 month and 3 months after
transplantation, consistent with previous reports.
About the effect of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) on Th17
responses, only a small number of animal study has been
conducted. In heart transplant animal model, CNI could not
suppress Th-17 associated immune responses. [22]. The signature
cytokines of Th1 and Th2 are both required to reciprocally reduce
IL-17, while administration of antibody to either Th1 or Th2
cytokines increases IL-17 [23] As shown in previous reports, it is
possible that administration of Th1-targeted Tac may not affect
Th17 type T-cell responses, and rather increase Th17 reponses.
However, little is known regarding the effect of immune
suppressants on Th17-cell-mediated alloimmune responses in
human.
Usually, the intensity of immune suppression is highest and the
immune reaction to allograft most robust during the early
posttransplant period. Therefore, we investigated the change in
Th17 cells at 1 month and 3 months after transplantation
compared with before transplantation. In contrast to other effector
T cell subsets, the percentage of Th17 showed a gradual increase
after transplantation, although the clinical course of the recipients
was stable. In addition, even though the entire cohort of TEM
showed a significant decrease after transplantation, the proportion
of IL-17-producing cells in TEM cells significantly increased. This
suggests that the increase in Th17 cells resulted from an increase in
activated T cells, not of quiescent T cells.
We investigated the expression of markers associated with the
development of Th17 cells, including IL-1beta and HMGB1. It is
well known that IL-1beta plays an important role in the
development of Th17 [24], while HMGB1 is a potent inducer of
several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1beta and IL-6,
which are considered crucial mediators in the induction of Th17
cells [25]. Our in vitro study showed that HMGB1 and IL-1beta
expression was not suppressed after transplantation and even
showed a gradual increase. This is consistent with the increased
proportion of Th17 observed after transplantation by flowcytometry.
The clinical impact of Th17 cells in kidney transplantation has
not been fully investigated. However, many previous reports
suggested a role for Th17 in the progression of fibrosis in various
organs. Fibrosis is a major component of the progression of
chronic allograft injury in transplanted kidney
[22,26,27,28,29,30]. In kidney transplantation, Th17 cell infiltration hastens chronic rejection and fibrosis in allograft tissue by
promoting lymphoid neogenesis [31]. In our previous report, we
demonstrated that higher levels of infiltration of Th17 cells in renal
allograft tissue are associated with more severe inflammation and
chronic changes in the allograft tissue, and were significantly
associated with the progression of interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy [32].
To investigate its clinical impact, we further evaluated the
association between the changes in Th17 cells during the early
posttransplant period and allograft function at 1 year after
transplantation. The size of the change in Th17 was negatively
correlated with MDRD eGFR at 1 year after transplantation,
which suggests that chronic injury is more significant in patients
who showed a greater increase in Th17 during the early
posttransplant period. In addition, we investigated the significance
of Th17 in another group of kidney transplant recipients with
then stimulated for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop. The data are representative of three independent experiments. The
values are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. * P,0.05, ** P,0.01 vs anti-CD3+anti-CD28. Tac, Tacrolimus.

lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of early-post transplant recipients. We used flow cytometry to examine how Tacrolimus
regulates in vitro Th17 subpopulations of CD4+ T lymphocytes in Th17-
polarizing condition. PBMC from renal transplant recipients were
preincubated for 1 h in the presence of Tacrolimus and stimulated
with Th17-polarizing condition for 48 h. Anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml), anti-CD28
(1 mg/ml), IL-1b (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (20 ng/ml) and IL-23 (20 ng/ml) were
added to stimulate the differentiation of Th17 cells. Neutralizing
antibodies to IFN-gamma (2 mg/ml) and IL-4 (2 mg/ml) were added in
some experiments (R&D Systems). Flow cytometry of intracellular Th17
in CD4+ T cells stimulated in the presence of Th17-polarizing condition,
assessed after 48 h and then stimulated for 4 h with PMA and
ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop. The data are representative
of three independent experiments. The values are expressed as the
mean 6 SEM.

long-term follow-up. The CAD group showed a gradual deterioration in allograft function during follow-up, which suggests that
chronic allograft injury may cause the allograft dysfunction.
Interestingly, the proportion of Th17 cells was significantly
increased in patients with CAD. It is possible that a sustained
elevation in Th17 may be associated with the progression of
chronic allograft injury through the mechanisms of both fibrosis
and alloimmune reactions.
Finally, we tested the suppressive effect of Tac on Th1, Th2,
Treg and Th17 cells. In kidney transplantation, only one study has
shown that Tac can suppress Th17-related alloimmune responses
in vitro [33]. However, the PBMC in that study were sampled
from patients exposed to immune suppressants for a long time and
who showed a stable clinical course. In contrast, we sampled
peripheral blood from both healthy controls and kidney transplant
recipients within 3 months after transplantation, at which time the
most robust changes in immune response can develop. In healthy
controls, Tac showed a dose-dependent suppressive effect on Th1/
Th2. However, the suppressive effect of Tac on Th17 was not
significant even with high doses of Tac. In the study using PBMC
from recipients early post transplant, Th17 was not suppressed
with most doses of Tac, which suggests that the suppressive effect
of Tac on Th17 is inadequate. This is consistent with the results of
the in vivo study, in which Th17 cells were not suppressed and
even showed a tendency to increase, in spite of continued immune
suppression including Tac.
In conclusion, Tac-based immune suppression could not
suppress Th17 cell as well as other effector T cell subsets such
as Th1 or Th2. The non-suppression of Th17 may be associated
with the progression of chronic rejection even in stable renal
allograft recipients. The results of this study might indicate a need
to develop therapeutic options to suppress IL-17-producing
effector T cells in renal transplant recipients.
