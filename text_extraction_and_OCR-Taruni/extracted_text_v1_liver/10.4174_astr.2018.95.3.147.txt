INTRODUCTION
Cases of liver transplantation (LT) have increased slowly in 
Korea, but HCV recurrence in the allograft is nearly universal 
after LT [1]. In the absence of effective antiviral therapy, HCV 
recurrence leads to cirrhosis in 10%–25% of recipients at 5 years 
in the posttransplant period and a 25% reduction in long-term 
patient survival compared to other indications for LT, because 
recurrent HCV is a major cause of graft dysfunction, graft loss, 
and patient death [2,3].
Direct antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionized HCV 
treatment in liver transplant recipients. Before the era of DAA 
agents, IFN-based regimens were the only treatment option. 
SVR rates of IFN-based regimens were markedly lower in LT 
recipients than in nontransplant patients due to an inability 
to tolerate IFN-based regimens and ribavirin (RBV)-induced 
anemia [4]. Thus, the use of IFN-based regimens has restricted 
the application of LT [5]. However, achievement of sustained 
virological response (SVR) results in favorable clinical outcomes 
in LT recipients [6].

Purpose: The proportion of liver recipients with HCV is gradually increasing in Korea. Limited data are available regarding 
the efficacy of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) in liver transplant recipients in Asia. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety 
of DAAs in HCV-infected liver recipients in Korea. 
Methods: Forty HCV-infected patients from 2 centers received DAAs in the pretransplant or posttransplant period between 
May 2015 and November 2016. 
Results: DAA was administered in the pretransplant period in 6 patients and the posttransplant period in 34 patients. 
Dalastavir and asunaprevir (n = 2) and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and ribvarin (n = 4) were used in the pretransplant period. HCV 
RNA was not detected before liver transplantation in all patients. Sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 and 24 weeks 
after liver transplantation was 100%. In the posttransplant period, 33 of 34 patients received sofosfovir-based therapy. SVR 
at 12 weeks in those patients was 94%. Recurrent virologic relapse developed in 2 patients because of HCC recurrence or 
treatment failure. Adverse events included anemia (n = 2) and abdominal discomfort (n = 1). 
Conclusion: DAAs are an effective and well-tolerated treatment for HCV-infected recipients in Korea.

Since the introduction of DAA agents, multiple nonIFN regimens represent an important achievement in HCV 
treatment, with higher rates of HCV cure and fewer adverse 
events [7-11]. Three recent observational studies using 
sofosbuvir-based therapy reported 100% SVR12 rates after 
completion of therapy [10-12]. However, limited data are 
available on the efficacy and safety of DAAs in liver recipients 
in Asia. The outcome for liver transplant recipients in Korea 
may provide valuable insights into the safety and efficacy of 
these regimens in Asia. Therefore, we report the results of our 
2-center experience in Korea using DAAs for the treatment of 
HCV patients before and after LT.
METHODS
This is a retrospective observational study that included HCV 
infected recipients who received DAAs in the pretransplant 
or posttransplant setting at the Samsung Medical Center 
(n = 17) and Seoul National University Hospital (n = 23) 
between May 2015 and November 2016. Electronic medical 
records were reviewed for patient demographics, including 
sex, age, transplant type, ABO-incompatibility, coexistence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), coinfection with HBV, HCV 
genotype, hepatic steatosis of liver graft, ischemic time, HCV 
RNA estimated by quantitative real time polymerase chain 
reaction assay (in IU/mL), duration of treatment, interval 
between LT and treatment initiation, history of prior HCV 
treatment, and type of immunosuppressive therapy. AST, ALT, 
and total bilirubin were measured at baseline before treatment 
initiation and at the end of treatment. HCV RNA was checked 
before treatment initiation and at the end of treatment. 
All patients received tacrolimus and the goal therapeutic 
range for tacrolimus was 3 to 8 ng/mL. The study was approved 
and received an exemption from written consent by the 
Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center (SMC2017-06-132) and Seoul National University Hospital (H-1706-
184-863).
Effectiveness 
Serum HCV RNA levels were quantified with a lower limit of 
quantification of 12 IU/mL. HCV RNA levels were measured prior 
to treatment, at variable time points throughout treatment, at 
the end of treatment, and at various times within the 12 weeks 
following completion of therapy. The primary endpoint was 
the proportion of patients achieving an undetectable HCV RNA 
SVR12. The secondary endpoints were virologic relapse after 
treatment and the incidence of adverse events.
Safety
Safety data were collected prior to initiation of medications, 
during treatment, and up to 12 weeks after the completion of 
treatment. Adverse events, graft dysfunction, and graft and 
patient survival were recorded.
Statistical analysis
The primary end point of this study was the proportion 
of patients who achieved SVR12, which was defined as an 
undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion. 
The secondary end points included relapse after treatment and 
side effects. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM 
SPSS Statistics ver. 22.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 40 liver transplant recipients from two centers 
who were infected with HCV with genotypes 1, 2, or 3 were 
treated with DAA. Six patients were treated with DAAs in the 
pretransplant period for 12 weeks and 34 patients were treated 
with DAAs in the posttransplant period for 12 weeks (n = 30) 
or 24 weeks (n = 4).
For DAA treatment in the pretransplant period, the 
combination of daclatavir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) (n = 
2) and the combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) 
with RBV (n = 4) were used. Demographic and clinical data 
are summarized in Table 1. HCV RNA was not detected before 
liver transplantation and the SVR12 and SVR24 rates after liver 
transplantation were 100% and 100%, respectively. 
Ten patients received antiviral treatments before transplantation, in the patients who received DAAs after liver 
transplantation. Eight patients were treated with a combination 
of interferon and ribavirin and 2 patients received only 
interferon therapy. However, we did not have data for the 
response to antiviral therapies before transplantation. For DAA 
use in the posttransplant period, 1 patient was treated with the 
a combination of DCV and ASV and the remaining patients (n 
= 33) were treated with SOF-based therapy. The median time 
from liver transplantation to DAA use was 10.5 months (range, 
1–161 months) (Table 2). Of the 34 patients treated, 94% (32 of 
34) achieved SVR12 and SVR24. Of 21 HCC patients treated with 
DAA after liver transplantation, 3 patients (14.3%) developed 
HCC recurrence. When comparing baseline laboratory values 
and HCV RNA, patients in the posttransplant DAA group (n = 
34) showed a significant improvement in serum AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, and HCV RNA level (P < 0.05) (Table 3). HCV RNA was 
undetectable at the end of DAA treatments in 39 of 40 patients. 
One patient developed HCV relapse and the other patient 
experienced treatment failure. Two patients with genotype 
1b did not reach SVR12. One patient was treated with SOF/
LDV and achieved SVR at the end of treatment, but HCV RNA 
increased from 8 weeks after the end of treatment. The other 
patient was treated with a combination of SOF, DCV, and RBV,

but the level of HCV RNA was not decreased.
Biopsy-proven acute rejection developed in 2 patients, 
who responded to increased immunosuppression. Adverse 
events were anemia (n = 2) and abdominal discomfort (n = 
1). Patients with anemia received RBV. No patients developed 
graft failure in the last visits, but one patient died because of 
pneumonia.
DISCUSSION
Before the DAA era, treatment options for patients with 
recurrent HCV in the allograft were limited to pegylated IFN 
and RBV, which result in very low SVR rates (30%) and a high 
frequency of side effects, such as hemolysis, pancytopenia, 
depression, graft rejection, and hepatic decompensation [13,14].
Antiviral treatments in liver recipients prevented liver-related 
death or the need for retransplantation due to graft failure. 
Real-world studies have supported high SVR rates and excellent 
tolerability of DAA regimens in LT recipients with recurrent 
hepatitis C and mild to moderate fibrosis including combination 
regimens of SOF/LDV and SOF plus DCV [10-12,15,16].
In this report, we describe our experience of treating HCVinfected patients before and after liver transplantation in 
Korea with DAAs. Six patients were treated with DAAs for HCV 
management before liver transplantation. They bought DAAs 
directly from abroad. One month after liver transplantation, 
others received DAAs in the posttransplant period because their 
liver enzymes and HCV RNA were elevated or their pathologic 
results showed liver fibrosis related to HCV reactivation. We

observed a remarkable SVR12 of 100% for pretransplant use and 
SVR12 of 94% for post-transplant use. Our results are comparable 
to previously reported rates in practice [10-12]. The combination 
of DAAs was well tolerated with a low rate of adverse events. No 
patient stopped medications prematurely due to adverse events. 
Anemia was observed in 2 patients and abdominal discomfort 
was observed in 1 patient. Virologic relapse developed in two 
patients. One patient failed treatment after LT. HCV RNA was not 
detected at the end of treatment, but its levels increased when 
HCC recurrence was diagnosed 1 month after DAA treatment. 
The relationship between HCC recurrence and HCV reactivation 
is unclear. The other patient was treated with a combination of 
SOF, DCV, and RBV, but treatment response was poor because the 
HCV RNA could not reach an undetectable level. Thus, the patient 
received DAAs for only 8 weeks.
A decision regarding the optimal time to start antiviral 
therapy will be needed for every patient waitlisted for 
liver transplantation. It is worth considering the relative 
advantages of initiating antiviral therapy before versus after 
deceased donor liver transplantation in Western countries. 
Theoretically, the best way to prevent HCV recurrence after liver 
transplantation is by achieving SVR prior to transplantation [17]. 
Pretransplant DAA use may be beneficial in the living donor 
liver transplantation setting, as these are scheduled operations. 
In addition, DAA use in the pretransplant period in HCC 
patients who have the additional allocation points in Western 
countries may be advantageous for preventing HCV recurrence 
after transplantation.
Posttransplant HCV recurrence was inversely related 
to the number of days of undetectable HCV RNA before 
transplantation [17]. Six patients in the present study had an 
undetectable viral load for more than 1 month prior to liver 
transplantation. A previous study also reported that 96% of 
patients with an undetectable viral load for more than 4 weeks 
prior to LT achieved SVR, whereas 90% of patients with HCV 
recurrence after transplantation had an undetectable viral load 
for less than 4 weeks [18]. Our study also suggests that negative 
HCV RNA due to DAA treatment prior to liver transplantation 
predicts SVR after liver transplantation.
Evidence from clinical trials that incorporated RBV into 
the regimens supports the use of RBV when treating patients 
with recurrent hepatitis C after LT [9,19]. However, in the new 
DAA era, the role of RBV in the treatment of HCV infection 
among LT recipients is unclear. Because of hematologic 
abnormalities associated with RBV, a RBV-free regimen may 
be considered effective. Limited real-world experiences with 
SOF-based therapy without RBV suggest similar SVR rates to 
an RBV-containing regimen [10,11,15]. Avoidance of ribavirin 
is desirable given the reduction in renal perfusion after liver 
transplantation due to the use of calcineurin inhibitors and 
reduced hemoglobin levels.
Several limitations must be considered when interpreting the 
findings of the present study. First, because of the retrospective 
observational study design and small sample size, there is 
considerable heterogeneity in treatment regimens, including 
previous treatment experience, length of treatment, use of 
RBV, and time from LT to HCV treatment initiation. Second, we 
did not have pathologic information, including the degree of 
fibrosis, because not all patients were biopsied before or after 
DAA treatment. Third, considering the low number of cases 
exhibiting treatment failure and relapse, it is difficult to identify 
factors associated with treatment failure based on our results.
In conclusion, DAAs that included mainly SOF-based therapy achieved high rates of SVR12 and SVR24 in the HCVinfected liver recipients of genotypes 1, 2, and 3. DAAs were 
well tolerated in all patients. Because of its small sample size 
and retrospective design, this study needs to be validated in 
a well-designed prospective study with a homogenous patient 
population and a large sample size in Asia.
