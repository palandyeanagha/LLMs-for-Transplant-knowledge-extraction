Review Article
Context: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the 
world but with a striking geographical variation in incidence; most of the burden is in 
developing countries. This geographic variation in HCC incidence might be due to geographic differences in the prevalence of various etiological factors.
Evidence Acquisition: Here, we review the epidemiological evidence linking dietary 
exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and risk of HCC, possible interactions between AFB1 and 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or polymorphisms of genes involved in AFB1-related metabolism 
as well as DNA repair.
Results: Ecological, case-control and cohort studies that used various measures of aflatoxin exposure including dietary questionnaires, food surveys and biomarkers are summarized.
Conclusions: Taken together, the data suggest that dietary exposure to aflatoxins is an 
important contributor to the high incidence of HCC in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 
where almost 82% of the cases occur.

1. Context
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in women worldwide 
(1). Due to its poor prognosis, HCC is the third leading 
cause of cancer-related mortality. There is a striking geographical variation in the incidence of HCC and most of 
the burden is in developing countries, where over 80% of 
the cases occur (1). The regions of high incidence of HCC 
are Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Middle and Western Africa (1). The geographic variation in HCC incidence 
might be due to geographic differences in the prevalence 
of various etiological factors, particularly chronic infection with hepatitis B and/or C virus, and dietary exposure 
to aflatoxins (2). Chronic hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection prevalence ranges geographically from 0.2% to 20% 
(3). Approximately 45% of chronic HBV carriers live in 
highly endemic areas, such as Africa and the Asia-Pacific 
region where there is also a high incidence of HCC (3). 
Chronic HBV infection is believed to be responsible for 
55% of HCC cases worldwide and 89% in regions where 
the virus is endemic or hyperendemic (4, 5). Although 
chronic HBV infection is the major risk factor for HCC, 
other environmental exposures such as drinking alcohol, 
tobacco smoking and aflatoxins have also been suggested to increase risk (6). Aflatoxins are naturally occurring 
mycotoxins produced by only a few Aspergillus species of 
which A. flavus and A. parasiticus are the most important;

they live in hot and humidified conditions. Aflatoxins 
commonly contaminate foods such as peanuts, grain, legumes, and corn. They are carcinogenic in experimental 
animal models and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most potent 
hepatocacinogen (7). Once ingested, AFB1 is metabolized 
by the cytochrome P-450 system at the 8,9 -vinyl bond 
to produce an unstable reactive intermediate, AFB1-8,9-
epoxide (8). This intermediate can bind covalently to 
DNA (9), forming AFB1-guanine adducts, and to protein, 
forming AFB1-albumin and other protein adducts (10, 11). 
The formation of AFB1-guanine adducts in hepatic DNA 
is critical for the carcinogenic effects of AFB1 in animals 
resulting in mutations in key genes (12). Assessing liver 
tumor tissues from regions with high exposure, a specific 
missense mutation at codon 249 in P53, AGG to AGT, leading to a substitution of arginine for serine (R249S), was 
frequently observed (13-15). Knowledge of the metabolism and toxicology of AFB1 has been used to develop biomarkers of exposure to study its carcinogenic effects (16, 
17). These include measurement of aflatoxin metabolites 
in urine, DNA and protein adducts in blood and tissues 
and excised guanine adduct in urine. In addition to the 
formation of adducts, it is believed that AFB1 acts as a carcinogen by mechanisms that include the formation of reactive oxygen species leading to increased hepatic oxidative damage (18, 19). In our previously studies, we found 
that AFB1 exposure was positively associated with level 
of oxidative DNA damage in humans as measured by urinary 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2′-guanine (20) as well as urinary 
15-F2t-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation (21). Increased HCC risk was also associated with higher levels of 
these oxidative stress markers in prospective cohort (21). 
In the following, we review the epidemiological evidence 
linking dietary exposure to AFB1 and increased in risk of 
HCC, possible interactions between AFB1 and HBV or genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in AFB1-related 
metabolism as well as DNA repair. 
2. Evidence Acquisition
2.1. Ecological Studies of Dietary Exposure to Aflatoxins 
and HCC Incidence/Mortality
Many ecological studies of HCC used food frequency 
questionnaires combined with food sampling surveys 
of AFB1 contamination to estimate dietary intake at the 
population rather than individual level in different parts 
of the world (Table 1). A study in the early 1970s measured 
AFB1 levels in major diet components from different parts 
of Uganda over one year and found that the frequency of 
AFB1 contamination was particularly high in provinces 
with high HCC incidence (22). Similar associations were 
reported in Swaziland (23) and Thailand (24). Data from 
Kenya quantifying daily intake based on assumed intakes 
of AFB1 contaminated food found those with higher average intakes were residents in areas with an elevated 
incidence of HCC (25). Pooling these observations (22-25) 
confirmed higher HCC incidence with higher levels of 
AFB1 consumption (26). Other ecological studies that determined AFB1 ingestion levels by collecting “food from 
the plate” consistently found significant correlations 
between calculated ingested daily dose and adult male 
incidence of HCC in different parts of Swaziland (27) and 
other countries in Southeastern Africa (28). That AFB1 is a 
cause of HCC in the U.S. was also suggested by comparing 
age-standardized HCC mortality rates and past dietary 
exposure to AFB1 in the Southeastern, Northern and Western regions where there was considerable geographic 
variation in the occurrence of HCC (29). Although HBV infection is also prevalent in countries with higher AFB1 exposure, none of these cross sectional correlations of AFB1 
exposure and HCC risk was adjusted for prevalence of 
HBV infection (22-29). Examining levels of AFB1 in dietary 
samples over one year from 4 different geographic regions of Swaziland with a 5-fold range of HCC incidence, 
Peer et al. (30) reported HCC incidence was strongly associated with estimated levels of AFB1, while the proportion 
of HBV infection varied relatively little by geographic region. Similarly, when mortality rates were plotted against 
the estimated levels of exposure based on the regular collection and testing of sample foods consumed in Southern Guangxi, China over 6 years (1978-1984), a positive 
and almost perfectly linear relationship was observed 
between mean annual per capital consumption of AFB1 
and HCC mortality rate for 1982-1986 across the communities (31). 
Later studies monitored AFB1 exposure by measuring 
urinary excretion of AFB1 metabolites and released DNA 
adducts (32, 33). The first study measuring urinary AFB1-
DNA adducts in Kenya found a moderate degree of correlation between AFB1 exposure and HCC only when the 
study was limited to certain ethnic groups and no synergistic effect of exposure and HBV infection on HCC risk 
(32). Another cross-sectional study conducted throughout China did not find an association between urinary 
AFB1 metabolites and HCC mortality (33). However, urine 
samples were collected in 1983, while data on HCC mortality was between 1973 and 1975. Analysis of the relationship between levels of urinary AFB1 metabolites and HCC 
mortality will be valid only if exposure levels are stable 
over time. Despite of the lack of association in these two 
studies, our cross-sectional survey of 250 residents from 
8 areas of Taiwan with a 4-fold variation in HCC mortality found a positive association between urinary AFB1 
metabolites and mortality at the township level and the 
association was stronger in females with chronic HBV infection than in those uninfected (34). Overall, many ecological studies have found a significant association between dietary AFB1 intake, estimated from contaminated 
foods, and HCC incidence in different populations, while 
data on the cross-sectional relationship between urinary 
AFB1 markers and HCC incidence are discordant. There 
are some methodological issues that need to be consid-

Wu HC Role of Aflatoxins
ered in these ecological studies. First, many studies were 
conducted in high HBV endemic regions and did not consider the effect of HBV on HCC risk. Thus, it is uncertain 
how much of the association could be explained by HBV 
carrier state (33). Second, the reliability of data on HCC 
incidence, and prevalence of HBV is limited since cancer 
registries and HBV screening were not nation-wide in 
these areas (33). Third, the estimate of AFB1 exposure was 
based on sampling some particular foods in the market 
or from households; seasonal variation that might affect 
the levels of contamination was not considered. Moreover, measuring AFB1 intake by food analysis is subject to 
its highly erratic distribution in different foods (35). The 
lack of individual-level information is a limitation of ecological studies known as the “ecological fallacy” meaning 
an association observed between variables on an aggregate level does not necessarily represent the association 
that exists at the individual level. Thus, one cannot necessarily infer the same relationship from the group level 
to the individual level. However, ecological studies can be 
done quickly and inexpensively and have provided useful 
information on the association of AFB1 intake and HCC 
risk. 
2.2. Cases-Control Studies of Dietary Exposure to Aflatoxins and HCC Risk
Further studies confirming an etiological role for AFB1 
have mainly been conducted in Asia comparing levels of 
AFB1 exposure between HCC cases and controls (Table 2). 
Early case-controls studies estimated individual levels of 
dietary AFB1 consumption retrospectively from dietary 
questionnaires data (36-41). A study conducted in the 
Philippines compared dietary intakes of HCC cases with 
age- and sex-matched controls (36). By using dietary recall, the frequency and amounts of food items consumed 
were used to calculate units of AFB1 load per day. These 
calculations revealed that the mean AFB1 load of HCC cases was 4.5 times higher than that of controls. Although 
this study did not have HBV infection data, AFB1 and alcohol, when consumed concurrently, were found to act 
synergistically in the development of HCC in males (36). 
A similar case-control study carried out in Henan, China 
reported odds ratios (ORs) of 13.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.7-51.2) for peanut and peanut oil consumption 
and of 19.4 (95%CI= 3.7-103.0) for corn consumption (41). 
In contrast, based on questionnaire data, consumption 
of more food thought most likely to be contaminated 
with AFB1, such as peanuts, had a no significant positive 
association with risk of HCC in Hong Kong (37) and Taiwan (38, 40). 
Other case-control studies estimated AFB1 exposure using biomarkers (39, 42-46). In one study Thailand, two 
approaches were used to estimate exposure, intake estimated by consumption of possibly contaminated foods 
and measurement of AFB1-albumin adducts in serum 
(39). No increase in risk was found with AFB1 exposure by 
either measure. In a population-based case–control study 
conducted in Southern Guangxi, China, although levels 
of serum AFB1-lysine adduct were higher in cases than 
controls, there was no significant association with HCC 
risk (45). Another series of studies also in Gugngxi, China 
found a dose-response relationship between HCC risk 
and levels of AFB1-DNA adducts in leukocytes and AFB1-
exposure years, as measured by years living in a high AFB1 
exposure region (42-44, 47). Moreover, there was a strong 
synergistic interaction between AFB1 exposure and genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in the repair of 
DNA double strand breaks (i.e. XRCC3 (42) and XRCC7 (44)) 
or nucleotide excision repair (i.e. XPD (43) and XPC (47)). 
In summary, in case-control studies, dietary data generally do not show an increase in risk of HCC associated 
with ingestion of AFB1-contaminated foods, although 
conflicting data were reported. As mentioned above, dietary questionnaire data are inadequate to measure AFB1 
intake because the content of individual foods can vary 
widely due to geographic and seasonal variations. This 
method also suffers from severe recall bias. Thus, the 
weak association may result from the inadequacy of the 
questionnaire in measuring AFB1 exposure. Biomarkers 
of AFB1 exposure that measure adducts quantitate the biologically effective dose at the individual level. However, 
subjects were selected on the basis of disease status. It is 
unclear whether cancer status affects the formation of 
biomarkers, and the association of biomarkers and HCC 
risk. The advantages of case-control studies are their ability to assess the relationship of AFB1 exposure and HCC 
risk at the individual level, and to adjust for potential 
confounder such as HBV infection. Although the studies 
also suggest an interaction effect of AFB1 exposure and 
other risk factors, the conclusions are limited because of 
relatively small sizes. 
2.3. Cohort Studies of Dietary Exposure to Aflatoxins 
and HCC Risk
A more promising and valid approach to evaluating the 
role of AFB1 is through prospective studies, where levels 
of AFB1 biomarkers are measured in blood/urine specimens collected years before diagnosis. To date, three major cohort studies have used this study design to address 
the relationship of AFB1 exposure and HBV infection to 
HCC incidence (48-55). The first case-control study nested 
in a cohort of 18,244 men was conducted in Shanghai, 
People’s Republic of China (48, 49). After nearly 35,299 
person years of follow-up, cases (n = 22) were matched to 
controls for age and area of residence. The relative risk 
(RR) of HCC for the presence of AFB1 metabolites including unmetabolized aflatoxins, hydroxylated and demethylated metabolites, and AFB1-N7-guanine adducts, after 
adjusting for other factors including hepatitis B virus 
surface antigen status, was 3.8 (95% CI = 1.2-12.2). A strong 
interaction between AFB1 and HBV was also reported with 
an RR of 60.1 (6.4-561.8) although there were only 7 cases

and 2 controls who were both HBsAg positive and positive 
for the presence of AFB1 metabolites (48). A subsequent 
follow-up study from this cohort with a total of 50 cases 
showed that the presence of any urinary AFB1 biomarker 
significantly predicted liver cancer (RR = 5.0; 95% CI, 2.1-
11.8) (49). The synergistic interaction between AFB1 exposure and HBV infection on HCC risk was again observed 
(49). However, using a dietary questionnaire and food 
survey to assess individual AFB1 intake, no association 
was found (49). Our Cancer Screaning Project (CSP) cohort recruited resident of age of 30 to 65 living in several 
rural townships of Taiwan where HBV infection is hyperendemic (50, 53, 55, 56). Preliminary results from this prospective cohort, limited to resents living on the Penghu

Wu HC Role of Aflatoxins
Island who have the highest HCC mortality and AFB1 exposure in Taiwan, demonstrated a 5.5-fold increased risk 
of HCC with detectable AFB1-albumin adducts (50). The 
entire cohort includes 12,024 males and 13,594 females, 
and 56 of these individuals developed HCC during the 
first 3-4 years of follow-up and 230 HCC cases were identified after 12 years (53, 55). Analysis of urine and albumin 
samples banked 1 to 12 years before diagnosis gave a relative risk of 1.5 (95% CI = 1.0-2.6) for AFB1-albumin adducts 
and 1.8 (95%CI = 1.2-2.6) for AFB1 metabolites (55). In the 
recent larger study, we also observed a 4-fold increased 
risk of HCC for HBsAg negative individuals with higher 
urinary AFB1 metabolites. In the first smaller study, we reported a 111-fold increased risk of HCC among HBsAg carriers with high urinary AFB1 metabolites and 70-fold for 
detectable AFB1-albumin adducts compared with those 
with low/nondetectable levels and negative for HBsAg 
(53) In the later study, with a much larger sample size, 
the effect of combined AFB1 exposure and HBV infection 
is more consistent with an additive than a multiplicative 
model (55). To date, there are no other data on the longterm combined effect of AFB1 and HBV on HCC risk. 
Another study we conducted in Taiwan among 4841 
male government workers with chronic HBV infection 
provided additional evidence for the role of AFB1 intake 
in development of HCC (51, 52). With 5 years of follow up,

we observed a dose-response relationship between HCC 
and serum level of AFB1-albumin adducts (51) and urinary 
AFB1 metabolites (52) among those who had null geno-
types of GSTM1 and T1 but not among those who had nonnull genotypes. Consistent results were found in our CSP 
cohort when we restricted analysis to HBV carriers (56). 
In a cohort of Chinese men with chronic HBV followed 
for 10 years, the relative risk of HCC was significantly in-
creased in subjects with detectable afLatoxins M1 (AFM1) 
levels (54). This prospective cohort study demonstrated 
that detectable urinary AFM1 levels above 3.6ng/L were 
associated with increased risk of HCC in male HBsAg car-
riers with chronic hepatitis (54). No genotype data were 
available in this study (Table 3). 
3. Results
Overall, prospective studies have shown a strong asso-
ciation between biological markers of AFB1 exposure in 
serum or urine and risk of subsequent HCC. The interac-
tion between AFB1 exposure and HBV infection on HCC 
risk was replicated in different cohorts. However, ear-
lier studies including ours suggested a synergistic effect, 
while in our recently follow up, an additive interaction 
model was suggested. The primary reason for these dis-
crepant results may be the small sample sizes in earlier 
studies. Genetic variation in metabolic enzymes as well 
as DNA repair might play a role in the risk of AFB1-related 
HCC; however, no large scale study has comprehensively 
examined the effect of genotype on the association be-
tween AFB1 exposure and HCC risk. 
4. Conclusions
Many ecological studies of AFB1-contaminated foods 
consistently suggest a role for this carcinogen in HCC. 
Although earlier data from case-control studies are con-
flicting, strong evidence for an AFB1-HCC link was sub-
sequently provided by studies based on the detection 
of AFB1 markers in biospecimens collected years before 
diagnosis. All ecological studies of dietary AFB1 and HCC 
were conducted in regions where HBV infection is hyper-
endemic but only two studies examined the roles of AFB1 
exposure and HBV infection in explaining the geographic 
variation of HCC incidence. However, no attempt was 
made to evaluate a possible interactive effect between 
these two risk factors. Case-control studies also did not 
evaluate interactions. The development of biomarkers 
for measuring AFB1 metabolites and AFB1-DNA and albu-
min adducts resulted in more accurate and reliable quan-
tification of dietary AFB1 exposure. All cohort studies 
measuring biomarkers of AFB1 consistently demonstrat-
ed that high levels of exposure increased risk of develop-
ing HCC later in life. All cohort studies suggest an inter-
action effect between AFB1 and HBV infection. A striking 
multiplicative effect was suggested in the earlier cohort 
studies with small numbers of HCC cases and short-term

follow-up, including ours. In contrast, our more recent 
data suggested that the combined effect of AFB1 exposure 
and HBV infection is more consistent with an additive 
than a multiplicative model. A quantitative cancer risk 
assessment estimated that aflatoxin may play a causative 
role in 4.6–28.2% of all global HCC cases (57). Although the 
etiological role of AFB1 exposure on HCC has been investigated for 50 years, data on the interaction of hepatitis 
B/C virus infection, genetic susceptibility and life style 
are limited. National HBV vaccination programs have 
been conducted in many counties, particularly in regions 
where AFB1 exposure and HBV prevalence are high (58). 
This will likely increase the importance of understanding 
the burden of other HCC risk factors. While some casecontrols studies suggested an interaction effect of AFB1 
exposure and genetic susceptibility and/or alcohol consumption on HCC risk, additional large scale population 
studies are needed to fully understand the carcinogenic 
mechanism of AFB1.
