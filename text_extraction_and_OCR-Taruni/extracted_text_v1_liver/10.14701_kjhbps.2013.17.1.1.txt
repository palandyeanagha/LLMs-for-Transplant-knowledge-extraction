Living donor liver graft can be used for the first or second liver transplantation. The timing of retransplantation also 
should be stratified as 2 types according to the reoperation timing. Combination of these two classifications results 
in 6 types of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)-associated retransplantation. However, late retransplantation to 
LDLT might have not been performed in most LDLT programs, thus other 4 types of LDLT-associated retransplantation 
can be taken into account. The most typical type of LDLT-associated retransplantation might be early living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation. For early living donor-to-living donor retransplantation, its eligibility criteria might be 
similar to those of early living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation. For early deceased donor-to-living donor 
retransplantation, its indications are exactly the same to those for aforementioned living donor-to-living donor 
retransplantation. Late deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT has the same indication for ordinary late 
deceased donor retransplantation. (Korean J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg 2013;17:1-7)

INTRODUCTION
Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been settled as a main type of liver transplantation. However, in 
spite of a large number of LDLT, living donor liver retransplantation has been uncommon and rarely reported in 
literature. According to a registry maintained by the 
Japanese Liver Transplantation Society, 2249 transplants 
have been performed in 49 institutions throughout Japan 
until the end of 2002; there were 2226 LDLTs in 2164 
patients and 23 deceased donor liver transplants.1 These 
data indicate that retransplantation rate following LDLT 
was about 2.8% and most of them were living donor-to-living donor liver retransplantation. In the series of 
first 1000 LDLTs and 155 deceased donor liver transplants at Asan Medical Center, there were 11 patients who 
underwent LDLT-associated retransplantation (retransplantation from or to LDLT): Three patients received living 
donor-to-living donor retransplantation and 8 patients underwent deceased donor-to-living donor or living donor-to-deceased donor retranspantation.2
 This series shows 
1.1% of LDLT-associated retransplantaion rate. On the 
other hand, the reported rate of retransplantation from 
large-volume deceased donor liver transplant programs 
varied between 7% to 23%.3 In the University of 
California Los Angeles series of 3,200 liver transplants including 65 LDLTs, liver transplantation more than once 
was performed in 538 patients (20.2%) of overall 2,662 
patients.4
The basic reasons why LDLT-associated retransplantation has been performed in such a low incidence comparing with deceased donor transplants might as follows: 
first of all, it might be very low incidence of primary 
non-function after LDLT, which has been the most common cause of retransplantation following deceased donor 
transplant. North American multi-center study group reported that 11 (2.9%) living donor liver grafts failed as 
primary non-function in 385 recipients and 37 patients underwent retransplantation within first year mainly due to 
vascular thrombosis or primary non-function.5 In this re-

port, the type of reoperation might be living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation. The detailed clinical sequences of primary non-function following LDLT have 
been not fully understood yet. There were only one case 
report of living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation 
due to primary non-function of the first liver graft.6 The 
second reason for low incidence of LDLT-associated retransplantation might be progressive decrease of graft failure from technical faults of LDLT operation through advancement of surgical techniques and improvement of 
imaging studies for donor liver evaluation.7 By using various innovative techniques, the incidence of serious surgical complications after LDLT decreased significantly, by 
which the need for retransplantation were proportionately 
reduced.8 The third reason is definite shortage of available 
deceased or living donor for retransplantation.
In North America and Europe where deceased donor 
liver transplantation is the main type of liver transplantation, deceased donor liver graft could be available 
with a relatively short waiting time in high probability if 
an emergent retransplantation is required.5
 This implicates 
that LDLT is primarily used for first liver transplantation 
to cope with relative shortage of deceased donor organs, 
and there is very low probability performing living donor-to-living donor retransplantation. Furthermore, the 
overall case number of LDLT in these areas is much 
smaller that those of Asian countries. As a result, in North 
America and Europe, the experience of LDLT-associated 
liver retransplantation would be confined to living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation.
On the other hand, in Asian countries where deceased 
organ donors are in scarcity, retransplantation with either 
deceased donor or living donor liver graft has very low 
probability due to lack of donors. In this situation, serious 
posttransplant complication is directly related to patient 
death without chance of retransplantation. According to 
the AMC experience, the main causes of early graft failure were serious complications confined to the liver graft 
such as hepatic artery thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, 
hepatic outflow obstruction, massive hemorrhagic necrosis 
or unexplained severe graft dysfunction.9 Retransplantation might have been attempted to most of these seriously 
complicated recipients if deceased liver donors were 
available.
LDLT-associated retransplantation can be classified as 
three types according to the sequences of graft types 
(living donor-to-living donor, living donor-to-deceased 
donor and deceased donor-to-living donor) because different surgical techniques should be considered according to 
the different sequences. It also should be classified into 
two types according to reoperation timing - early and late 
- like in ordinary deceased donor liver retransplantation.
After applying these combinations, early retransplantation from LDLT to deceased donor transplantation 
might have been the most typical type in countries where 
deceased donor organs are available. It is also the simplest 
type of retransplantation because all structures belonging 
to the first liver grafts would be removed before formation 
of adhesion and new graft can be anastomosed to the recipient's native structures. On the other hand, late retransplantation to LDLT is the possible worst combination because severe adhesion, distorted structures and newly developed collateral veins would make the recipient operation very difficult or not possible. In practice, retransplantation using living donor liver graft has a limited indication only for life-saving purpose. The outcome of 
LDLT-associated retransplantation has not been reported 
yet in literature. Based on the Asan Medical Center experience with 11 cases of LDLT-associated retransplantation, 
1-year survival rate after retransplantation was about 60%, 
which is much lower than 91% following first LDLT in 
883 adult recipients.9
 The underlying cause of such lowering of survival rate might be inevitable miss of the optimal timing for retransplantation due to donor factors.
INCIDENCE AND INDICATIONS
It is presumed that only a small number of liver recipients have undergone LDLT-associated retransplantation 
worldwide to date. Living donor liver graft can be used 
for the first or second liver transplantation. The timing of 
retransplantation also should be stratified as 2 types according to the reoperation timing. Combination of these 
two classifications results in 6 types of LDLT-associated 
retransplantation. However, to our knowledge, late retransplantation to LDLT might have not been performed 
in most LDLT programs. Considering our experience on 
late deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT or 
deceased donor transplant, it does not seem to be reasonable or sometimes not feasible to dissect the heavy adhe-

sion around the initial partial liver graft, especially at the 
conglomerated hilar structures, to make them suitable for 
LDLT. Thus, other 4 types of LDLT-associated retransplantation can be taken into account.
The most typical type of LDLT-associated retransplantation might be early living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation. Any cause of early graft failure can be indicated for this type of retransplantation if a deceased donor organ is available: it includes primary non-function, 
early severe dysfunction or major surgical complications 
confined to the liver graft, which are much similar to 
those of deceased donor liver transplantation. Although 
the incidence of primary non-function following LDLT 
has been sporadically commented in literature, the actual 
incidence has been unknown so far after exclusion of the 
technical factors during learning curve.5,6,10 According to 
the Asan Medical Center experience, its incidence was 
definitely less than 1% if strict definition of primary 
non-function was applied. Severe initial dysfunction of the 
living donor liver graft was often associated with 
small-for-size graft, excessive venous congestion of the 
right lobe graft from hepatic outflow obstruction or portal 
flow steal syndrome. Serious hepatic artery-related complications including hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in 
2-5% at large-volume LDLT programs and became a 
leading cause of early graft failure following LDLT.11-13
Intractable biliary complication also can be an indication 
of retransplantation because its clinical course could be 
intractable and it occasionally induced life-threatening 
sepsis.14,15 If the general condition of a patient can endure 
the retransplantation procedure itself, there might be no 
absolute contraindication specific for this type of retransplantation. Thus, it shares the same retransplantation indication criteria with initial deceased donor liver transplantation.
For early living donor-to-living donor retransplantation, 
its eligibility criteria might be similar to those of early 
living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation, but technical feasibility should be considered first. The most important point is the availability of hepatic arterial blood 
flow source. A reliable arterial flow source other than the 
hepatic artery proper is the right gastroepiploic artery because it can be easily mobilized toward the hepatic hilum 
after detachment from the stomach and can be promptly 
enlarged to facilitate size-mismatching. The clinical significance of this artery was proven in its use for 
LDLT.11,16 If it is not possible to use this artery before 
reoperation, living donor retransplantation should not be 
attempted or fresh arterial vessel graft should be sought 
from deceased organ donors.
For early deceased donor-to-living donor retransplantation, its indications are exactly the same to those for 
aforementioned living donor-to-living donor retransplantation unless extensive hepatic artery thrombosis occurred. 
Hilar dissection of the failed whole liver graft is comparable to that of liver dissection during initial LDLT. If 
hepatic arterial thrombosis was the cause of graft failure, 
alternative arterial flow source such as right gastroepiploic 
artery should be searched first.
Late deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT 
has the same indication for ordinary late deceased donor 
retransplantation such as recurrence of hepatitis C cirrhosis or chronic rejection. This type of retransplantation 
is considered to carry an increased risk comparable to the 
repeated deceased donor retransplantation.17-20 As there is 
no short-cut to dissect heavy adhesions, the timing of deceased donor and recipient operations should be adequately adjusted not to make the cold preservation time 
too much prolonged.21,22
TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
LDLT-ASSOCIATED RETRANSPLANTATION
The difficulty of the recipient operation usually depends 
on the timing of retransplantation. Early emergency retransplantation such as reoperation within the first week 
does not require difficult dissection process because there 
is little adhesion around the liver graft. Retransplantation 
after an interim period such as 1-3 months would make 
adhesions from mild to severe degree. Although minute 
collateral vasculatures are not usually developed in the adhesion of this time, meticulous sharp dissection is mandatory to secure the dissection effectively. For late retransplantation after progression of viral hepatitis or 
chronic rejection, heavy adhesion and new development 
of portal venous collaterals would be encountered. Every 
adhesion should be cut sharply and every bleeding point 
should be strictly controlled during the dissection process. 
Blunt dissection of such adhesion should be avoided because it can induce massive uncontrollable bleeding from 

4 Korean J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 17, No. 1, February 2013
the widely dissected surface in the situation of portal 
hypertension. Except for early retransplantation, retransplantation operation usually takes much longer operation 
time for dissection than in the initial operation, so experience-based scheduling of donor and recipient operations 
is important not to prolong cold preservation time or living donor operation time.21,22
Early living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation
After the main operative wound for initial LDLT is 
opened, gentle blunt dissection with fingers would make 
the gelatinous or mild adhesion separate from the liver 
graft. Hepatic hilar structures should be manipulated gently, but the hepatic artery and common bile duct may not 
be suitable to reuse for deceased donor retransplantation. 
Retrohepatic inferior vena cava should be dissected further especially cephalad to enable deep secure clamping 
of the suprahepatic vena cava over the diaphragm because 
the hepatic vein cuffs are nearly absent. As the cephalad 
end of right hepatic vein orifice is located very close to 
the diaphragm, deep diaphragm clamping is mandatory to 
secure suprahepatic vena cava anastomosis.
In this type of retransplantation, the common hepatic 
artery may not be suitable for arterial anastomosis; adequate branch patch cannot be made because all branches 
other than previously anastomosed branch were ligated 
already. Blood outflow from the right gastroepiploic artery often appears to be too small to perfuse the whole 
liver graft reliably. Thus, arterial interposition graft should 
be taken into account. Infrarenal aortic jump graft has 
been preferred to supraceliac aortic graft.
After complete dissection of the old graft and inferior 
vena cava, the retransplantation procedure proceeds as 
routine like in deceased donor-to-deceased donor 
retransplantation. Piggyback technique with side-to-side or 
end-to-side cavocaval reconstruction is not recommended 
because the use of such methods did not seem to have 
no advantage when comparing with the standard technique.23-25 LDLT has often used duct-to-duct anastomosis, 
so the condition of recipient bile duct is usually not 
enough good to re-do duct anastomosis. Thus, Roux-en-Y 
choledochojejunostomy is highly recommended.26,27
Early living donor-to-living donor retransplantation
For this type of retransplantation, the type of second 
liver graft and hepatic arterial inflow source should be 
considered prudently. As this retransplantation is performed 
in a highly morbid situation, suboptimal donor graft such 
as graft size smaller than 40% of the recipient's standard 
liver volume should not be used considering the severity 
of pre-retransplant condition.28-30 Donor livers with variant 
liver anatomy such as variant portal vein or hepatic artery 
cannot be used.11,13,31,32 If a right lobe graft is used, hepatic venous congestion should be minimized through interposition reconstruction or concurrent procurement of the 
middle hepatic vein.33-36 Arterial flow source is another 
important point to be considered before this type of retransplantation because it is usually not feasible to use the 
proper hepatic arterial branch again even in the favorable 
situations with no hepatic artery thrombosis. Splenic artery is usually not suitable for arterial reconstruction of 
LDLT due to its limited length and diameter discrepancy. 
It is not preferred to use the cryopreserved vessel graft 
for arterial reconstruction due to a high risk of arterial 
thrombosis or potential pseudoaneurysm formation although 
successful outcomes have been sporadically reported.37-39 
Instead, fresh arterial graft from a deceased donor can be 
used like in primary LDLT for recipients with destructed 
hepatic artery. For such purpose, it is reasonable to procure the superior mesenteric artery graft from a deceased 
donor during procurement of iliac artery grafts because 
superior mesenteric artery has many small branches 
matching to right or left hepatic artery of the partial liver 
graft. Another reliable source of hepatic arterial flow is 
the right gastroepiploic artery. In practice, in such a situation requiring arterial blood flow source other than innate hepatic arteries, the right gastroepiploic artery has 
been the most preferable artery for LDLT because of its 
invariable anatomical location, size, and length. This artery often looks too small at a glance, but it can be rapidly 
dilated after clamping for a short time. As this artery is 
fed from the arterial arcades at the pancreatic head not 
to mention of the gastroduodenal artery, usual hepatic artery thrombosis without extension to the celiac axis usually does not have negative influence on its blood flow. 
These merits of the right gastroepiploic artery as a substitute source for hepatic arterial flow have led to use it 

Shin Hwang, et al. Liver retransplantation for adult recipients 5
for multiple or re-do arterial reconstruction in LDLT. 
Preoperative selective arteriography or three-demensional 
reconstruction of computed tomographic angiography can 
be used for its preoperative evaluation.40
For removal of the old graft and secure anastomosis of 
the hepatic vein, deep secure suprahepatic vena cava 
clamping over the diaphragm should be prepared like in 
deceased donor retransplantation. As prolonged vena cava 
clamping is often required, active venovenous bypass 
would be beneficial.
After complete dissection of the old graft and inferior 
vena cava, the retransplantation procedure proceeds as 
routine like in primary LDLT. Portal vein should be cut 
close the old liver graft across the anastomotic line, and 
then suture material should be removed. Similar principle 
would be applied to the hepatic vein orifice. After vena 
caval clamping, the liver parenchyma should be cut to 
leave some tissue at the hepatic vein orifice. After that, 
suture material should be removed to preserve the edge 
of hepatic vein orifice intact.
Technically, the use of a partial graft of same type is 
of advantage for intra-abdominal space occupation and 
hepatic vein reconstruction. The same stump of portal 
vein can be usable for portal vein reconstruction. Hepatic 
vein stump can be used like in primary LDLT. When using the right gastroepiploic artery for alternative hepatic 
arterial flow source, it is necessary to straighten the anastomosis site not to make a kinking deformity. To avoid 
accidental excessive tension at the arterial anastomosis 
site, it is necessary to transfix the artery to the surrounding structure such as gastric antrum before performing 
other procedure. The recipient bile duct which had been 
used for biliary reconstruction is not acceptable for 
duct-to-duct anastomosis, so Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is mandatory.
Early deceased donor-to-liver donor retransplantation
This type of retransplantation has been usually applied 
to primary non-function of the first deceased donor liver 
graft. Thus, all vascular structures should remain intact. 
In contrast, the cause of first graft failure is vascular complication such as hepatic artery thrombosis, portal vein 
stenosis or vena cava stensosis, such patient may not be 
indicated for this type of retransplantation. Any type of 
living donor liver graft can be implantable like a first 
LDLT, but right lobe graft is desirable due to stable settlement of the partial liver graft in the right subphrenic 
fossa. Hilar vascular structures and retrohepatic vena cava 
of the failed liver graft should be dissected like in primary 
LDLT. Vena cava and portal vein of the first graft should 
be left as interposition grafts. Hepatic artery of the first 
graft can be used as interposition graft, or other source 
of arterial blood flow such as gastroepiploic artery can be 
used alternatively. Since the retrohepatic inferior vena 
should be fully preserved, both supra- and infrahepatic 
anastomotic lines should be protected carefully. The portal 
vein of the first graft should be dissected, but this process 
is not difficult because the failed liver has nearly normal 
consistency and hilar structures are dissected already. It 
is not recommended to use the hepatic artery branch of 
the first graft,3 but there might be not worse than using 
other type of jump graft. Based on the AMC experience, 
this arterial interposition did not result in any arterial 
complication. Alternatively, the right gastroepiploic artery 
can be used as arterial flow source without interposition 
of deceased vessel graft. Duct-to-duct anastomosis is not 
feasible because the proximal portion of recipient bile 
duct had been already removed during first operation. 
There is no choice of biliary reconstruction other than 
hepaticojejunostomy.
Late living donor-to-liver donor retransplantation
It is almost not practical to perform this type of retransplantation because of heavy adhesion and distorted the hilar structures not permitting sufficient dissection.
Late living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation
Heavy adhesion and prominent venous collateral would 
be encountered during recipient operation. Piggyback 
technique may be not feasible and not recommended due 
to heavy adhesion around the retrohepatic inferior vena 
cava. Dissection of the main portal vein which had been 
once dissected would require meticulous sharp dissection. 
Common hepatic artery patch or aortic jump graft is used. 
There is no choice other than Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy.

Late deceased donor-to-liver donor retransplantation
This type of retransplantation is also a kind of least recommended type like late living donor-to-living donor 
retransplantation. Surgical technique would be similar to 
that of early deceased donor-to-living donor retransplantation, but the difficulty of hilar dissection varies depending on the patient conditions.
OUTCOME OF LDLT-ASSOCIATED 
RETRANSPLANTATION
Since LDLT-associated retransplantation has been performed in a small number of patients worldwide, its outcome cannot be assessed statistically unlike in deceased 
donor re-transplantation. Furthermore, LDLT itself indicates shortage of deceased donor organs, so optimal retransplantation timing might have been missed in patients 
with failing first liver graft. Considering the real situation 
of deceased organ shortage and limited availability of living donor, the outcome of LDLT-associated retransplantation might be naturally worse than that of deceased 
donor retransplantation. Although deceased donor retransplantation revealed higher morbidity and lower survival 
than primary transplantation, 1-year survival in adult recipients became about 70% in recent literature.17,41 Considering the disadvantageous situation of LDLT-associated retransplantation, the result of about 60% 1-year survival 
from the Asan Medical Center series is comparable to the 
result from deceased donor retransplantation. Late deceased donor retransplantation has been often performed 
for patients with hepatitis C virus infection, but this disease was associated with lower patient and graft survival 
compared with retransplantation for other causes.42 It may 
be reasonable to expect the similar outcome after LDLTassociated retransplantation in patients with viral hepatitis C.
