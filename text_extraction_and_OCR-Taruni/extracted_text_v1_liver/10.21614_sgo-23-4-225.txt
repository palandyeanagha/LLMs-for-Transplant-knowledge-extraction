ABSTRACT
The indications for liver transplantation in hepatobiliary malignancies have been carefully 
expanded, giving rise to a new era of “Transplant Oncology,” the fusion of transplantation 
medicine and oncology. Curative resection is the only curative therapy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Liver transplantation may achieve a complete resection with adequate negative 
margins in patients with locally advanced, unresectable disease due to bilateral invasion of 
second-order biliary radicals, portal vein and/or hepatic artery involvement, or insufficient hepatic
reserve. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach which consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, followed by liver transplantation, was introduced by the Mayo Clinic group for selected
patients with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. This treatment strategy has become
increasingly accepted in the U.S., with acceptable results. However, the definition of “unresectable
disease” is not universal and therefore, the true survival benefit of liver transplantation, over
extended liver resection combined with portal vein/hepatic arterial reconstruction, remains
unclear. This review describes the history current controversies and future directions that need to
be taken liver transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.

HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
FOR PERIHILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA FOR PERIHILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA
Complete removal of the tumor is critically important for cure of perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma. Liver transplantation may allow a histologically curative
resection with adequate negative margins in patients with locally advanced,
unresectable disease due to bilateral invasion of second-order biliary radicals,
portal vein and/or hepatic artery involvement, or insufficient hepatic reserve (1).
Since the late 1980s, liver transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
has been attempted with poor resultant. Pichlmayr et al. performed liver transplantation alone for patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, proven by

surgical exploration, and reported 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 60%, 21.4%, and 17.1%, respectively (2).
Iwatsuki et al. reported that the 1-, 3-, and 
5-year survival rates after liver transplantation were
59.3%, 36.2%, and 36.2%, respectively, and that liver
transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma was
unjustified given the 36% 5-year survival after liver
transplantation in patients with negative surgical 
margins and no nodal disease. The authors also 
mentioned that the role of liver transplantation for 
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma was limited because of 
the inefficient use of organs in the context of organ
shortages (3). Therefore, most programs have 
abandoned liver transplantation alone for cholangiocarcinoma because of these discouraging results.
In 2000, the Mayo Clinic group developed a protocol
using preoperative irradiation and chemotherapy for
patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Patients
initially received external-beam irradiation plus bolus
fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by brachytherapy with 
iridium and concomitant protracted venous infusion of
5-FU. 5-FU was then administered continuously
through an ambulatory infusion pump until liver transplantation. A total of 11 patients, out of the initial 19
patients who were enrolled onto the study, underwent
liver transplantation. The study outcomes were encouraging (4). In 2005, the Mayo Clinic group reported on 
a modified protocol after introducing a novel neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen for unresectable
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (5). Patient eligibility and
exclusion criteria for liver transplantation are described
in table 1. Thirty-eight patients underwent liver 
transplantation and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates
were 92%, 82%, and 82%, respectively. The authors
concluded that liver transplantation with neoadjuvant
chemoradiation achieved better survival with lower
recurrence rates than conventional resection and
should be considered as an alternative to resection 
for patients with localized, node-negative perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma (5). The multicenter retrospective
study in 2012 across 12 U.S. institutions with variable
neoadjuvant protocols also confirmed excellent 
outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed
by liver transplantation for patients with unresectable
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (6).
At present, only one prospective, randomized, 
multicenter study, comparing liver transplantation 
preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to 
conventional liver and bile duct resection for resectable
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Liver Resection Versus
Radio-chemotherapy-Transplantation for Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma [TRANSPHIL] study), is underway in France
(www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02232932). Here, an interventional group receives liver transplantation 
preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
(capecitabine; 800 mg/m2 twice a day for 5 weeks
and external radiotherapy; a total of 50 gray delivered
over 5 weeks). The control group receives conventional
liver and bile duct resection. The primary endpoint for
this study is overall survival at 5 years. The secondary
endpoint is recurrence-free survival at 3 years, as 
evaluated by CT scan and tumor markers. This study
should provide additional insights as to whether liver
transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is a
more effective treatment than liver resection in
patients who are candidates for resection.
CLINICAL GUIDELINES CLINICAL GUIDELINES
Liver transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is emerging concept, and there is wide
discrepancy in its applicability among currently 
available clinical guidelines. Patients need to be 
carefully selected to avoid futile transplants in the
face of critical organ shortage. Several proposed 
criteria are described below.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network
Guidelines
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
version 1.2018 states that liver transplantation is a potentially curative option for selected patients with lymph
node-negative, non-disseminated, locally advanced perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, and with either unresectable
disease with normal biliary and hepatic function, or with
underlying chronic liver disease precluding surgery.
Based on the United Network for Organ Sharing 
database, Becker et al. reported that the 5-year survival
rate was 45 % for patients with diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma transplanted between 1995 and 2005. They
advocated that the outcomes following liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma had improved during the
recent era of transplantation and that the factors 
contributing to improved outcomes included more precise staging, more restricted patient selection, and 
more effective adjuvant therapies (7). As previously 
mentioned, Darwish et al. reported the first multicenter
study to examine the effectiveness of combining preoperative chemoradiataion and liver transplantation 
for highly selected patients with locally advanced, 
unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Recurrencefree survival rates were 78%, 65% and 59% at 2, 5 and 10
years respectively. The outcomes were not only similar
to results from previous single-center series (5, 8) but
also similar to liver transplantation outcomes for
other malignant and non-malignant indications (6).
There are many reports advocating the efficacy of liver
transplantation for selected patients with perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma but these data are insufficient to
achieve commonly accepted criteria in the guidelines.
The panel encourages continuation of clinical research in
this area, and recommends referral to a transplant 
center if patient is a potential transplant candidate.
ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines
The ESMO clinical practice guidelines describe liver
transplantation in locally unresectable cases involving a
multidisciplinary approach including neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation.
However, this treatment has not become the standard
of care. In 2016, Mantel et al. reported the importance
of appropriate patient selection on liver transplantation
for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma outcomes using the
European Liver Transplant Registry. In this retrospective
study, patients who complied with the Mayo Clinic 
criteria (group A) showed a significantly better survival
compared to patients who did not meet the criteria
(group B). The 5-year survival rate was 59% for group A
versus 21% for group B (P = 0.001) (9). The ongoing
French phase III TRANSPHIL trial should help determine
whether this treatment should be the standard treatment for cholangiocarcinoma.
Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines
There is no statement about liver transplantation for
cholangiocarcinoma in the Japanese clinical practice
guidelines. Some Japanese hepatobiliary surgeons have
emphasized that most patients with early-stage, unresectable cancer (i.e., good candidates for transplantation according to the Mayo Clinic criteria) have
resectable tumors, and that extended resections for
such patients can produce favorable outcomes (10-13).
The guidelines state that biliary tract cancers with
metastases to the liver, lungs, bones, peritoneum, and
distant lymph nodes (para-aorta or extra-abdominal
lymph nodes) are contraindications for surgical resection; however, there is no consensus on criteria to
define locally unresectable disease (14).
RESECTABILILTY, TRANSPLANTABILITY, RESECTABILILTY, TRANSPLANTABILITY,
AND CURABILITY AND CURABILITY
As shown above, neoadjuvant therapy, followed by
liver transplantation, is reserved for a highly selected
group of patients (including those with tumors < 3 cm
in size and no lymph node involvement) with unresectable disease and patients with underlying 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (15). However, the 
definition of “unresectable disease” remains highly
problematic. Bismuth defined type IV lesions as unresectable (16). The Mayo Clinic criteria for unresectability
include bilateral segmental ductal extension, encasement
of the main portal vein and unilateral segmental ductal
extension with contralateral vascular encasement. On the
other hand, Nagino et al. reported on 73 patients with
Bismuth type IV tumors and/or who underwent 
combined vascular resection, and thereby met the unresectability criteria. Their 5-year survival rate was 60.4%,
similar to the survival for the transplant patients with de
novo cancer. Nagino et al. stated that transplants are
unnecessary in most patients in the Mayo series and
that surgical treatment for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma was evolving steadily, with expanded surgical indications, decreased mortality, and increased survival (10).
More recently, Ebata et al. reported outcomes of
patients with Bismuth type IV tumors who underwent
surgical resection. Of the 332 patients with type IV
tumors, 216 (65.1%) underwent surgical resection. The
Liver Transplantation for Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma in an Era of Transplant Oncology: Urgent Need for a Common Language in Resectability, Transplantability, and Curability

228 Surgery, Gastroenterology and Oncology, 23 (4), 2018
5-year survival rate of 53% of patients with pN0M0 
disease in their series was similar to that of patients
with de novo cancer who received liver transplantation.
They also insisted that most patients with early-stage
cancer, considered unresectable based on Mayo Clinic
criteria who were good candidates for transplantation,
had resectable tumors (17). This highlights the need of a
consensus for the definition of “unresectable disease”
before the role of liver transplantation for curative 
treatment of this disease can be determined.
Recently, in addition to the prospective trial in France,
the propriety of liver transplantation for patients with
resectable cholangiocarcinoma has been discussed in the
U.S. Ethun et al. evaluated the type of surgery (resection
versus liver transplantation) for patients with perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma using the database of the U.S.
Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium. They found
that resection for patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma that met criteria for liver transplantation 
(< 3 cm and lymph node-negative disease) resulted in 
significantly worse prognoses, compared to those who
received neoadjuvant therapy followed by liver transplantation for the same criteria with unresectable disease,
when performing intention-to-treat analyses (54% versus
29% at 5 years, P = 0.03) (18). (18). Rosen wrote in his 
editorial that neoadjuvant therapy and liver transplantation “should not be done in lieu of resection for
potentially resectable cholangiocarcinoma,” because
the benefit is too low to justify use of a deceased or 
living donor liver. In the study, the survival benefit of
neoadjuvant therapy and transplantation was only 14%
when only patients with non-primary sclerosing cholangitis were compared, well below the minimal benefit 
commonly applied to transplantation; 50 % survival at 5
years (19). Moreover, Nagino raised two issues in his 
editorial: i) The surgical outcomes of the resection group
in the study were poor compared to the reports from
Japan and Korea, and ii) Most tumors that met the Mayo
Clinic criteria for liver transplantation, i.e., early-stage 
but unresectable cancer, may become resectable by
exhausting all surgical options for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, such as extended hepatic resections including
trisectionectomies combined with major vascular resections, and hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (20). Whether
there would be a significant survival benefit with liver
transplantation over resection for resectable disease
remains unclear and it is of paramount importance to 
discuss resectability, transplantability, and, most importantly, curability in an international framework.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The indications of liver transplantation for perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma have been carefully expanded by
applying an aggressive multidisciplinary approach. This
evolution shed light on the ambiguity of “unresectable
disease,” and therefore, the true survival benefit of liver
transplantation remains unclear. Nonetheless, liver
transplantation may potentially change the landscape
of treatment for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and we
should hold broad, international discussions to establish 
a consensus on resectability, transplantability, and 
curability by integrating the growing body of evidence
in the context of transplant oncology (21).
In conclusion, although neoadjuvant therapy 
followed by liver transplantation for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma has proven to be a highly effective strategy for
cholangiocarcinoma, there is an urgent need to build a
common language for this surgically curable disease.
Once a consensus is reached among an international
group of experts, prospective studies of how to 
optimize oncological treatments will be worthwhile.
