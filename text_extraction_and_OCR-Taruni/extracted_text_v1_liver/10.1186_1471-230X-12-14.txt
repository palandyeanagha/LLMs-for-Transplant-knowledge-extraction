Abstract
Background: The aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), a tool with limited expense and
widespread availability, is a promising noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for detecting hepatic fibrosis. The
objective of this study was to systematically review the performance of the APRI in predicting significant fibrosis
and cirrhosis in hepatitis B-related fibrosis.
Methods: Areas under summary receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC), sensitivity and specificity were
used to examine the accuracy of the APRI for the diagnosis of hepatitis B-related significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression.
Results: Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis (n = 1,798). Prevalence of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis
were 53.1% and 13.5%, respectively. The summary AUCs of the APRI for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0.79
and 0.75, respectively. For significant fibrosis, an APRI threshold of 0.5 was 84% sensitive and 41% specific. At the
cutoff of 1.5, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 49% and 84%, respectively. For cirrhosis, an APRI
threshold of 1.0-1.5 was 54% sensitive and 78% specific. At the cutoff of 2.0, the summary sensitivity and specificity
were 28% and 87%, respectively. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the APRI accuracy for both significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis was affected by histological classification systems, but not influenced by the interval between
Biopsy & APRI or blind biopsy.
Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that APRI show limited value in identifying hepatitis B-related significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Background
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), with which more than
400 million people are infected over the world, causes a
worldwide health problem. It is the most common cause
of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide, eventually
progressing from fibrosis to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. It is well known that the exact staging of liver fibrosis is crucial for the therapeutic
decision and assessing of the prognosis of CHB patients.
Currently, liver biopsy, the gold standard, is limited by
invasiveness, complications, sampling error, variability in
pathological interpretation, and the reluctance of
patients to undergo repeated biopsies to monitor disease
progression [2,3], and 0.2-2% morbidity rate [4,5].
Because of these limitations, noninvasive measures have
been examined by numerous studies to grade liver fibrosis. The aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio
index (APRI) was first reported and used to identify
patients with HCV-related hepatic fibrosis by Wai and
his colleague in 2003 [6]. This index has the advantage
of including only 2 inexpensive laboratory tests, which
are performed routinely in all patients. The APRI has

shown great value in predicting HCV-related fibrosis. So
far, there have been several researches conducted to
assess the APRI for predicting the fibrosis stage of HBV
patients, and some of the existing researches are controversial. The objective of this study was to systematically
review the diagnostic accuracy of the APRI for the prediction of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis
B-related fibrosis.
Methods
Search Strategy
The objective of our search was to identify published
manuscripts of studies examining the APRI for the
prediction of HBV-related fibrosis. An electronic
search, without language limitations, was completed
on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) including the following
terms: APRI, AST, platelet, hepatitis B, AST-to-platelet ratio index, and fibrosis markers (01/2003-03/
2011). Additional studies were identified via a manual
search of the reference lists of relevant studies. Studies
were selected if they met the following inclusion
criteria:
(1) The study evaluated the performance of the APRI for
the prediction of fibrosis in HBV-infected patients. Studies
including patients with other causes of liver disease were
included if data for HBV-infected patients could be
extracted.
(2) Liver biopsy was used as the reference standard for
assessing fibrosis. According to METAVIR or comparable systems, they classified the fibrosis stages F ≥ 2, F ≥
4; the Ishak system was F ≥ 3, F ≥ 5.
(3) In order to calculate the indexes (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive
value) of each cut-off point, data could be extracted to
allow the construction of at least one 2 × 2 table of test
performance.
(4) The study included more than 40 patients. Smaller
studies were excluded because of poor reliability.
Data Abstraction
Two reviewers (JIN and LIN) independently evaluated
the study eligibility, graded quality, and extracted outcome data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
To assess the methodological quality of the studies
included in the meta-analysis, the Quality Assessment of
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies score was used [7,8].
The primary outcome was the identification of significant fibrosis, defined as METAVIR [9], Batts and Ludwig [10], or Scheuer [11] stages F2 through F4 or Ishak
stages F3 through F6 [12]. We also examined the identification of cirrhosis (METAVIR, Batts and Ludwig, or
Scheuer F4, or Ishak F5-6).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
For each test threshold and outcome, we tabulated the
data in 2 × 2 tables to count the sensitivity and specificity. In view of previous study’s primary thresholds of 0.5
and1.5 for significant fibrosis and 1.0-1.5 and 2.0 for cirrhosis, we examined the areas under summary receiver
operating characteristic (SROC) curves, the summary
sensitivities and specificities to provide the summary
measures of test performance across all tests and these
thresholds. We also calculated Q·
(which is defined by the
point where sensitivity and specificity is equal, and is the
best tool to reflect the diagnosis value)to assess the diagnostic accuracy and used Random effects meta-regression
[13] to examine the impact of the following factors on
identifying significant fibrosis: (a) interval between Biopsy
& APRI(≤ 1 week or other); (b) histopathological classification systems (METAVIR, or Scheuer, Ishak, Batts and
Ludwig); (c) blind biopsy (yes vs. no). All the data were
analyzed in the Meta-Disc software (version 1.4).
Results
Sixteen studies were identified that described the APRI
in patients with chronic hepatitis B (Figure 1). Ultimately, 7 studies were excluded for insufficient data
(n = 4) [14-17], duplication of data (n = 1) [18], small
sample size or any other cause of chronic liver disease
(n = 2) [19,20]. Thus, our final data set for the metaanalysis included 9 studies (Table 1) [21-29].
Characteristics of the Included Studies
Table 1 shows the main features of our eligible studies. A
total of 1,798 patients (median age, 34.6 years; 79.4%
male) were included. The overall prevalence of significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis were 53.1% (range, 21.7%-83%) and
13.5% (3.4%-40.2%), respectively. Regarding histological
classification systems, 5 studies used METAVIR score, 2
used Scheuer score, 1 used Ishak score, and 1 used Batts
and Ludwig score. According to the Quality Assessment
of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies scale, we can see that
seven studies met all 14 requirements of this scale, 1
study met 13, and 1 study met 12. The methodological
quality of the included studies was very good.
According to the meta-regression, the APRI accuracies
for detecting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were not
affected by the interval between Biopsy & APRI (P =
0.22, P = 0.42), or blind biopsy (P = 0.09, P = 0.57), and
were both influenced by histological classification systems (P = 0.01, P = 0.03),
Diagnostic Accuracy of the APRI for the Prediction of
Significant Fibrosis
Seven studies in 1,404 patients assessed the APRI for the
prediction of significant fibrosis. The average prevalence
of significant fibrosis in these studies was 53.1% (range,

21.7%-83%). For this outcome, the area under the SROC
curve was 0.79 (SE = 0.0243) and the Q·
index was 0.72
(SE = 0.0208) (Figure 2). The summary sensitivities and
specificities of the APRI at various thresholds for the
identification of significant fibrosis were listed in Table 2.
At the threshold of 0.5, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 84% (95% CI, 81%-88%) and 41% (36%-46%),
respectively. At the cutoff of 1.5, the summary sensitivity
and specificity were 49% (95% CI, 44%-53%) and 84%
(80%-88%), respectively. Based on these data, and assuming a 53.1% prevalence of significant fibrosis (as observed
in the included studies), the estimated PPV and NPV of
0.5 were 64% and 68%. At the 1.5 cutoff, the estimated
PPV and NPV were 80% and 57%, respectively.
Diagnostic Accuracy of the APRI for the Prediction of
Cirrhosis
Six studies in 1,012 patients assessed the APRI for the
prediction of cirrhosis. The average prevalence of
cirrhosis in these studies was 13.5% (range, 3.4%-40.2%).
For this outcome, the area under the SROC curve was
0.75 (SE = 0.0237) and the Q· index was 0.70 (SE =
0.0197) (Figure 3). At the threshold of 1.0-1.5, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 54% (95% CI, 48%-
60%) and 78% (75%-80%), respectively. At the cutoff of
2.0, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 28%
(95% CI, 21%-35%) and 87% (84%-89%), respectively.
Based on these data, and assuming a 13.5% prevalence
of cirrhosis (as observed in the included studies), the
estimated PPV and NPV of 1.0-1.5 were 39% and 86%,
respectively. At the 2.0 cutoff, the estimated PPV and
NPV were 36% and 82%, respectively.
Figures 4 and 5 show the funnel plot analysis to detect
the publication bias of each study for significant fibrosis
and cirrhosis, respectively. The shape of the funnel plot
seems to be asymmetrical, suggesting that publication
bias might affect the findings of our meta-analysis.

Discussion
Recently, the combination of FibroTest with FibroScan
has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for the
detection of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis [30]. However, the combination requires a complex instrument
and is costly. Instead, the APRI is based on routinely
performed, inexpensive laboratory parameters; it is
potentially the ideal tool. The APRI has been derived
and validated in HCV. In Wai and colleagues’ original
study [6], the AUC for HCV-related significant fibrosis
and cirrhosis in the training and validation cohorts were
0.80 to 0.88 and 0.89 to 0.94, respectively. Subsequently,

many researches supported this view [31-35]. A meta
analysis researched by Abdel Aziz M et al. pointed out,
in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (CHC), the
summary AUCs of the APRI for significant fibrosis and
cirrhosis were 0.76 [95% CI: 0.74-0.79] and 0.82 [95%CI:
0.79-0.86], respectively; an APRI threshold of 0.5 was
81% sensitive and 50% specific, at a 40% prevalence of
significant fibrosis, this threshold had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 80%. For cirrhosis, a threshold of
1.0 was 76% sensitive and 71% specific, at a 15% cirrhosis prevalence, the NPV of this threshold was 91%, the
major strength of the APRI is the exclusion of significant HCV-related fibrosis [36].
In contrast to HCV, Wai et al. [14] evaluated the accuracy of models (ALT, AST and APRI) from HCV in 218
HBV patients, which indicated that non-invasive markers
in predicting histology from CHC patients were unsuitable for CHB patients. Subsequent research demonstrated
that in contrast to APRI, ASPRI was accurate in predicting cirrhosis and has the potential to reduce the number
of liver biopsies in CHB patients when screening with
ASPRI [27]. However, W.G. Shin and colleagues’ study
indicated that of indirect markers, the APRI yielded the
best area (0.86) under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI: 0.82-0.91], the APRI may be the most
accurate and simple marker for predicting significant
fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B [24]. Lin CS and colleagues’
research supported this view [26]. Thus, the present
study conclusions are controversial. In our systematic
review, we summarize the diagnostic accuracy of the
APRI for the prediction of HBV-related fibrosis. In our
systematic review, we calculated summary sensitivities

and specificities at various thresholds to translate all
point estimates into clinical practice. The summary
AUROC of the APRI for the diagnosis of significant
fibrosis was 0.79. Moreover, the 0.5 threshold was 84%
sensitive and 41% specific. Assuming a 53.1% prevalence
of significant fibrosis, this translates into estimated PPV
and NPV of 64% and 68%, respectively. On the contrary,
a cutoff of 1.5 was less sensitive (49%) and more specific
(84%). Assuming a 53.1% prevalence of significant
fibrosis, this translates into estimated 80%PPV and 57%
NPV. With regard to cirrhosis, the summary AUROC
was 0.75. Moreover, the1.0-1.5 threshold was 54% sensitive and 78% specific. Assuming a 13.5% prevalence of
cirrhosis, this translates into estimated PPV and NPV of
39% and 86%, respectively. On the contrary, a cutoff of
2.0 was less sensitive (28%) and nearly specific (87%).
Assuming a 13.5% prevalence of cirrhosis, this translates
into estimated 36% PPV and 82% NPV. A diagnostic tool

is considered as good if the AUROC is greater than 80%,
excellent if the AUROC is greater than 90% and perfect if
the AUROC is 100%. According to these results, the
APRI may not be a good tool for predicting significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis B-related fibrosis and
can not reduce the number of liver biopsy.
A strength of our review is that meta-regression analyses have been used for exploring factors that may be
responsible for heterogeneity. We analyzed carefully
three indicators that might contribute to heterogeneity:
(a) the interval between Biopsy & APRI (≤ 1 week or
other); (b) blind biopsy (yes VS. no); (c) histological
classification systems (METAVIR, Scheuer, Ishak, Batts
and Ludwig). By meta-regression, we could see that for
both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, histological classification systems were found to provide heterogeneity to
summary test results. Previous research has shown that
the hypothesis of the liver biopsy is 80% - 90% accurate,
the AUC of medical tests cannot reach 0.9, and more
likely fluctuated from 0.75 to 0.9 [37]. To solve the problem, one of the ways is improving the quality of liver
biopsies.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only HBVinfected patients have been analyzed. Losing some
patients with mix infections (HBV/HCV, HBV/HIV and
HBV/NAFLD) suggest reduced accuracy. Secondly,
some of the studies reported APRI thresholds not
included in the original description (Table 2). For example, W.G.Shin et al. proposed that the 1.4 cutoff appears
promising (79% sensitive; 83% specific for significant
fibrosis) [24]. The number of studies is so small that we
have not focused on these thresholds. Finally, we have
chosen inclusions only by published manuscripts, so
bias in the selection of search channels may influence
the results to some extent.
In summary, our systematic review suggests that APRI
show limited value in identifying hepatitis B-related significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. The APRI is not an appropriate
choice for HBV patients to identify hepatitis B-related
fibrosis in regions with limited health care resources.
Future studies are necessary to identify high accuracy,
cost-effectiveness and widely available measures.
Conclusion
Our meta-analysis suggests that APRI show limited
value in identifying hepatitis B-related significant fibrosis
and cirrhosis.
