BACKGROUND: Teaching hospitals typically pioneer investment in new technology and cultivate workforce characteristics generally associated with better quality, but
the value of this extra investment is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Compare outcomes and costs between major teaching and non-teaching hospitals by closely
matching on patient characteristics.
DESIGN: Medicare patients at 339 major teaching hospitals (resident-to-bed (RTB) ratios ≥ 0.25); matched patient
controls from 2439 non-teaching hospitals (RTB ratios <
0.05).
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three thousand nine hundred
ninety pairs of patients (one from a major teaching hospital and one from a non-teaching hospital) admitted for
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 84,985 pairs admitted
for heart failure (HF), and 74,947 pairs admitted for pneumonia (PNA).
EXPOSURE: Treatment at major teaching hospitals versus non-teaching hospitals.
MAIN MEASURES: Thirty-day all-cause mortality,
readmissions, ICU utilization, costs, payments, and value
expressed as extra cost for a 1% improvement in survival.
KEY RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was lower in teaching than non-teaching hospitals (10.7% versus 12.0%,
difference = − 1.3%, P < 0.0001). The paired cost difference
(teaching − non-teaching) was $273 (P < 0.0001), yielding
$211 per 1% mortality improvement. For the quintile of
pairs with highest risk on admission, mortality differences
were larger (24.6% versus 27.6%, difference = − 3.0%, P <
0.0001), and paired cost difference = $1289 (P < 0.0001),
yielding $427 per 1% mortality improvement at 30 days.
Readmissions and ICU utilization were lower in teaching
hospitals (both P < 0.0001), but length of stay was longer
(5.5 versus 5.1 days, P < 0.0001). Finally, individual results for AMI, HF, and PNA showed similar findings as in
the combined results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare patients admitted for common medical conditions, as admission risk of mortality increased, the absolute mortality
benefit of treatment at teaching hospitals also increased,
though accompanied by marginally higher cost. Major
teaching hospitals appear to return good value for the
extra resources used.

INTRODUCTION
Studies have previously examined the relationship between
hospital teaching status and patient outcomes across a range of
medical conditions and surgical procedures.1–9 Understanding
the value of teaching hospitals is important, because they often
invest more than non-teaching hospitals in cutting-edge technology and workforce characteristics generally associated
with better quality, but typically, this comes with additional
cost.1 In order to better quantify the impact of this investment
in care for medical patients, we use new methods of multivariate matching10 that closely control for patient differences and
compare outcomes and costs on a national scale between
teaching and non-teaching hospitals among patients admitted
for three common and representative medical conditions that
rank among the 10 leading causes of hospitalization (acute
myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia).11
Matching ensures that comparisons between teaching and
non-teaching hospitals use pairs of similar patients who have

both comparable risk levels on admission and also have that
risk for comparable reasons, unlike in regression models
where two patients can have similar expected risk due to very
different comorbidities or risk factors. Through matching, we
can assess whether differences in patient outcomes vary significantly within particular subsets of patients or whether
outcomes systematically change as patient risk increases, a
concept we call risk synergy.12–14 By comparing costs and
outcomes, we can learn whether specific patient groups fare
better at major teaching or non-teaching hospitals and generate
essential data points for assessing comparative value (cost per
1% improvement in survival)—crucial for better referral of
patients to hospitals and for implementing value-based
payments.15
METHODS
This research study was approved by the Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board.
Patient Population
We were granted access via the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) Virtual Research Data Center
(VRDC) to administrative claims data for older Medicare
beneficiaries admitted to short-term acute care hospitals in
the USA for principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), or pneumonia (PNA)
between July 1, 2012, and November 30, 2014. The VRDC
hosted each patient’s beneficiary summary file and administrative claims (inpatient, outpatient, carrier/part B, and
hospice files). We excluded hospitalizations if the patient
was under 65.5 years old at admission, had evidence of
hospice care, or lacked fee-for-service Medicare in the 6
months prior to admission, the month of admission, or the
month after admission. If a patient had multiple qualifying
admissions during the study period, we randomly chose
one. After applying these restrictions, we randomly split
the sample to use 90% for matching, with the remaining
10% set aside to create baseline prognostic scores.16 Details of the sample construction, code lists, and sample
means are provided in Appendix Tables 1, 2, and 3.
Definitions
Hospital teaching status was defined using resident-to-bed
(RTB) ratios from the Medicare Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS).17 The focal group of major teaching hospitals was defined as having RTB ratios of 0.25 or
greater.18,19 The comparison group of non-teaching hospitals
was those with RTB ratios below 0.05.
Patient characteristics were defined using the index admission claim and a 6-month look-back in inpatient, outpatient,
carrier/part B, and hospice files. We also defined patient age at
admission, year of admission, sex, race, emergent admission
type, and encounters at dialysis facilities, skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory surgical centers, and intermediate care
facilities, or transfer from another hospital’s inpatient or emergency department immediately preceding admission to the
index hospital. Transferred patients’ outcomes were assigned
to the first hospital the patient encountered, either as an inpatient or via the emergency department. Comorbidities were
defined using methods adapted from CMS.20,21 We also defined 5 geographic regions based on the location of the hospital and estimated a propensity score for admission to a major
teaching hospital using all the matching covariates.22,23
To calculate patient risk on admission, we fit binary logistic
models predicting probability of 30-day death and ICU use
with the 10% sample reserved for risk modeling (see Appendix Tables 4, 5, and 6).24 We divided patients in each of the
three medical conditions into five quintiles of predicted 30-day
mortality. Predicted length of stay and predicted resourcebased hospitalization cost were also modeled with the 10%
sample using robust regression.25–27
Hospital bed size was defined using the total bed count from
HCRIS. We defined each hospital’s nurse-to-bed (NTB) ratio,
nurse mix, and technology level using the Medicare Provider
of Services file.14,28 Comprehensive cardiac technology was
defined as the availability of open-heart surgery and the presence of both a coronary care unit and a catheterization lab.21,29
Outcomes
The primary quality outcome was 30-day all-cause, alllocation mortality. We also studied all-cause, all-location readmission or death extending up to 30 days after discharge,
with patients who died in the hospital also counted as
readmissions. As a stability analysis, we calculated 30-day
post-discharge readmission rates in those that survived to
discharge. We also examined length of stay and ICU rate of
utilization.
We assessed hospital economic performance from the perspective of the health care system using 30-day resource
utilization–based cost,14,30,31 which represents resources consumed by the health care system in providing care, and acutecare payments tracked by CMS, which represent payments
made to the health care system by Medicare, patients, and
other primary payers. Resource utilization–based costs track
resources through a standardized national price index and do
not reflect prices charged to patients or payers. Thirty-day
resource costs counted index hospitalization costs plus costs
from emergency department, outpatient, or office visits within
30 days of admission, and all costs associated with
readmissions that began within 30 days of the index admission
date. See Appendix Table 8 for the costing algorithm.
Acute-care payments reflect the amount actually paid for
the hospitalization. We focused on two payment calculations.
The first was actual payment as tracked in the CMS claims,
which includes all payments made by CMS, the beneficiary,
and any other third-party payer. The second payment
Silber et al.: Outcomes at Major Teaching Versus Non-teaching Hospitals JGIM

calculation removes Medicare’s adjustments for geography,
disproportionate share hospital (DSH), and indirect medical
expenditure (IME) payments.32 See Appendix Table 8 for
details. As a stability analysis, we repeated all analyses of cost
and payment with alternate definitions that added post-acutecare payments.5
Defining Value
We defined value (sometimes referred to as incremental costeffectiveness) as the difference in resource utilization cost between major teaching and non-teaching matched pairs, divided
by the difference in 30-day mortality between major teaching
and non-teaching matched pairs (or Δ cost/Δ mortality). Neumann et al.33 suggest acceptable ratios between $100 and
$200,000 per life year saved in the USA. We then repeated
these value calculations adding post-acute-care payments. We
report value as the cost (or payment) increase associated with a
1% improvement in mortality if the ratio’s denominator was
defined (i.e., significantly different from zero); readers familiar
with the cost-per-life-saved metric can obtain it by multiplying
our estimate by 100. The 95% confidence interval for the value
ratio was derived using the jackknife.34
Statistical Methods
Matching Methodology. Matching of major teaching cases to
non-teaching controls was accomplished using the NetFlow
procedure in SAS.35 Patients were matched exactly for principal diagnosis category and quintile of 30-day mortality risk.
Within exact groups, we used near-exact matching36 with
refined balance10 to control for hospital region. We also used
refined balance to match patient demographics, admission
characteristics, and risk factors. Subject to the exact and refined balance constraints, we optimally formed the closest sets
of pairs between cases and controls by minimizing a
Mahalanobis distance37 between cases and controls, which
included all comorbidities, demographic, and admission characteristics, the risk scores, and a propensity score for admission to a major teaching hospital (see Appendix Tables 7a–7c).
The AMI and HF matches each included 68 covariates, while
the pneumonia match included 76 covariates.
Matching was performed first without viewing outcomes.38
We aimed to attain standardized differences in covariate
means below 0.1 standard deviations after matching, though
below 0.2 is a traditional standard.39,40 We also assessed
balance using 2-sample randomization tests, specifically the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for each continuous covariate and
Fisher’s exact test for each binary one, thereby comparing
the balance achieved by matching to the balance expected
from complete randomization.41
Comparing Outcomes. Outcomes were compared using
paired methods: for binary outcomes, McNemar’s test;42 for
continuous outcomes, M-statistics for matched pairs.26,43–45
We further compared outcomes between major teaching
patients and non-teaching controls within each risk quintile.
Trends across risk levels were assessed using the Mantel test
for trend for binary outcomes46 and robust regression for
continuous outcomes.26,27 Graphs of major-minusnonteaching outcome differences by risk level were produced
using the LOWESS procedure in SAS,47 using smoothed
pointwise 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals.48
RESULTS
Final Patient and Hospital Sample
The sample comprised 203,922 patients treated for AMI, HF,
or PNA at 339 major teaching hospitals and 1,049,037 patients
treated at 2533 non-teaching hospitals. All major teaching
hospitals and their patients were used in the match, while
2439 non-teaching hospitals (96.3%) were represented in the
match.
As expected, the structural features of teaching hospitals
differed from non-teaching hospitals in many ways, as seen in
Table 1, with more teaching hospitals with high-level cardiac
technology and higher nurse-to-bed ratios.
The Quality of the Patient Matches
To illustrate the quality of matching, Table 1 displays a few
details of the combined AMI, HF, and PNA matches. Not seen
in Table 1 are the 5 risk quintiles that were matched exactly
within pairs, and the complete list of 26 demographic covariates and 29 comorbid conditions that were matched. Before
matching, teaching hospital cases and non-teaching hospital
controls differed in many ways. For example, teaching hospital patients were admitted with higher rates of HF, higher rates
of chronic kidney disease, and higher rates of diabetes, while
non-teaching controls were more likely to be non-Hispanic
whites and have higher rates of COPD. After matching, all
clinical covariate standardized differences met the balance
criteria of 0.10 SDs or less. All covariates within the individual
AMI, HF, and PNA matches also met the balance criteria on
all covariates. Complete matching tables are displayed in
Appendix Tables 9–9c.
Outcome Results
Table 2 reports outcome results for the combined medical
match, as well as separately for AMI, HF, and PNA and within
the five quintiles of risk. The overall 30-day mortality rate for
the 3 medical conditions combined was 10.7% at major teaching hospitals, compared to 12.0% at non-teaching hospitals
(difference = − 1.3%, P < 0.0001). Major teaching hospitals
used the ICU less frequently than non-teaching hospitals
(19.9% vs. 22.4%, difference = − 2.5%, P < 0.0001). Length
of stay was longer at teaching hospitals (5.5 days vs. 5.1 days,
paired difference = 0.4, P < 0.0001), but 30-day readmission
or death was lower (30.4% vs. 32.3%, difference = − 1.9%, P
< 0.0001). A stability analysis examining 30-day readmission

in patients who survived to discharge displayed similar results,
except for the highest severity patients in quantile 5, where
teaching hospitals appeared to have higher readmissions than
non-teaching hospitals when ignoring differential death rates
(see Appendix Table 10). Thirty-day resource utilization costs
were $19,249 versus $18,944 (a paired difference of $273, P <
0.0001). Thirty-day total acute-care payments were $22,304
versus $17,141 (a paired difference of $5048, P < 0.0001);
however, after removing geography, DSH, and IME payments, 30-day acute-care payments were $17,902 versus
$16,207 (a paired difference of $1662, P < 0.0001). See
Appendix Tables 11–11c for other forms of payment calculations. Results for the individual medical conditions were
similar.
Differences in Outcomes and Costs Across
Patient Risk Levels
The last 6 columns of Table 2 report outcome differences for
the combined medical group by ascending risk quintiles (risk
synergy) and summary tests for trend. We found increasing
mortality reductions at major teaching hospitals with increasing risk on admission. There was no difference in mortality in
the lowest-risk quintile (2.5% vs. 2.6%, difference = − 0.1%, P
= 0.4670), but a large difference for the highest-risk quintile
(24.6% vs. 27.6%, difference = − 3.0%, P < 0.0001) (trend P =
0.0001), and a patient cost difference of $16,464 versus
$17,000 (paired difference = − $546, P < 0.0001) in the
lowest-risk quintile and a patient cost difference of $22,265
versus $20,901 (paired difference = $1289, P < 0.0001) in the
highest-risk quintile (trend P < 0.0001).
Figure 1a, b, and c display the relationship between escalating mean patient risk on admission in matched pairs on the
x-axis and the difference in 30-day mortality between the
matched pairs on the y-axis, and similarly, Figure 2a, b, and
c display the differences in cost. The central curve in each
figure shows the paired difference in outcome rate at the risk
level indicated on the x-axis, and the shaded region represents
the pointwise 95% confidence interval from the bootstrap.
Points below zero for the y-axis suggest lower mortality or
cost in the teaching hospital patients for a given risk level.
We also saw significant trends (in both directions) in all
outcomes between major teaching and non-teaching patients,
except for length of stay and ICU use. Notably, teaching
hospitals consistently used the ICU at lower rates than nonteaching hospitals.
Estimates of Comparative Value
Table 2 also provides estimates of the difference in cost for a
1% difference in mortality between major teaching and nonteaching hospitals, with associated 95% CIs. We also examine
value within risk quintile and again provide condition-specific
value estimates in Appendix Tables 12–12c.
Tracking price-standardized resource utilization costs, the
value estimate for combined medical conditions was $211 for

Value expressed as increased cost or payment at teaching hospitals per 1% reduction in mortality. Individual tables for AMI, HF, and PNA are provided in the Appendix. P value key is as follows: aP < 0.05, bP < 0.01, cP < 0.001, and dP < 0.0001. Non-significant differences have no letter. P values for binary overall outcomes and within strata were calculated using McNemar’s test. P values and estimates for
continuous overall outcomes and within strata were calculated using M-statistics. Value is well defined if there is a significant difference in mortality between groups. Otherwise in this table, values arereported as N.C. (not calculated). For all value estimates and confidence intervals reported, all 1000 jackknives concur in finding a statistically significant difference in mortality

a 1% reduction in mortality at the major teaching hospitals
compared to non-teaching hospitals, or equivalently $21,100
per life saved. Similar results were seen within the individual
medical conditions. For the lowest-risk patients, costs were
significantly lower at major teaching hospitals, but mortality
was not significantly different between hospital types. In the
highest-risk quintile, we found a value estimate of $427 per

post-acute-care costs from all sources displayed very similar
results (see Appendix Table 13 for both costs and payments).
Examining total acute-care payments, the overall payment
difference for the combined medical conditions was $5048
with an associated mortality reduction of − 1.3%, resulting in
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio point estimate of $3904
per 1% reduction in mortality. However, removing Medicare
payment adjustments for geography and DSH (which would
be paid to any hospital in the same location serving the same
population) and removing the indirect medical education adjustment (because payments to support medical education are
needed to supply future practicing physicians for both teaching and non-teaching hospitals), the payment difference was
$1662, translating to a value estimate of $1286 per 1% reduction in mortality. For the highest-risk patients, the value estimate using total payments was $2030. However, after removing geographic, IME, and DSH payments, the highest-risk
quintile had a value estimate of $809.
CONCLUSIONS
Risk Synergy is the phenomenon where increasing patient risk
on admission interacts with hospital type12–14 to influence
outcomes. In this study, as patients presented with poorer
health, they experienced increasing 30-day mortality benefit
of treatment at major teaching hospitals relative to nonteaching hospitals. A similar finding was observed in our
earlier work concerning different nursing environments14
and also was recently reported in a study by Burke et al.7
The present study builds on the work of Burke et al.5,7,8 by
examining concomitant costs, and value, showing increasing
differences in resource utilization costs between teaching and
non-teaching hospitals as risk increased, co-occurring with
increasing differences in mortality and better value. Major
teaching hospitals required fewer resources to treat low-risk
patients than non-teaching hospitals did, but as patient risk
increased, resource costs at major teaching hospitals increased
above those in non-teaching hospitals. In general, however,
costs were higher at major teaching hospitals, in part because
length of stay was consistently longer across risk levels, and
because of the higher resource utilization at teaching hospitals
in the highest risk patients compared to non-teaching
hospitals.
For the lowest-risk patients in the combined analysis, mortality was not different between hospital types, but cost was
typically lower at teaching hospitals. In the second-lowest risk
quintile, both mortality and cost were significantly lower at
teaching hospitals—a clear indication of accruing value at the
teaching hospitals. From the middle quintile to the highest-risk
quintile, we observed significantly lower mortality at the
teaching hospitals, but also higher costs. By the highest quintile of risk, there was a − 3.0% absolute difference in mortality
at major teaching hospitals, with an associated $1289 cost
increase. In our value calculation, that translates to about
$427 per 1% increase in survival.
While a more traditional value calculation of differences in
lives saved is useful to policymakers who want to know the
statistical cost for one life saved over a population, the information should be interpreted differently by patients. Patients
cannot pay $42,700 for a 100% reduction in their risk of death.
Rather, the individual patient may want to think about value as
the incremental cost for, say, a 1% absolute reduction in the
risk of death.
For both teaching and non-teaching hospitals, it appears that
as patient risk increased, resource utilization (cost) increased,
but payments were relatively stable. This could represent a
cross-subsidization that occurs between low- and high-risk
patients at both types of hospitals.
Overall, we found a − 1.3% absolute reduction in mortality
at major teaching hospitals (10.7% vs. 12.0%) compared to
non-teaching hospitals, consistent with a report by Burke
et al.,8 who found a similar difference in 30-day mortality in
national Medicare data with regression modeling. Our analysis
also examined resource costs and payments, and the cost-toquality trade-off along the continuum of patient risk. In so
doing, we found that even though resource costs and payments
increased at teaching hospitals relative to non-teaching hospitals as patient risk increased, the concomitantly increasing
quality benefit associated with lower mortality resulted in
good value. While other studies have compared quality and
cost between teaching and non-teaching hospitals,3,7–9 all such
studies fundamentally depend on the specifications of the
regression model to make an unbiased comparison between
hospital groups whose patients may differ substantially in
characteristics and risk. Using matching, we could assure that
risk subsets of our analysis compared similar patients with
similar diagnoses, thereby allowing us to better understand
differential outcomes across and within levels of risk.
Recent work by Burke et al.,5,7,8 and summarized in an
editorial on value by Khullar et al.,6 did not actually estimate
value between hospital types. Our study estimated value differences between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, by
summarizing the cost differences across a group of matched
pairs, and the mortality differences across the same patients
included in the matched pairs, and calculated value, again
using those same patients. The methods we described also
allowed us to place a confidence interval around all of these
quantities.
Our study has implications for practice and policy. Treatment capacity in major teaching hospitals is limited, and our
study shows that although complex, high-risk patients are
currently treated at both major and non-teaching hospitals,
major teaching hospitals provide superior outcomes for such
patients at only a slight fiscal premium, providing good value.
The health system could use this information to promote a
more optimal, efficient allocation of patients to academic
hospitals, based on both their own needs and the differential
capacity of facilities to address them. We also now provide a
Silber et al.: Outcomes at Major Teaching Versus Non-teaching Hospitals JGIM

quality context to differential payments, which is important
knowledge for setting reimbursement policy.
Our study is based on Medicare claims, with all of the
limitations associated with such administrative data, including
the possibility of confounders not measured in claims. Administrative data also lacks information on quality of life or nonmedical costs to patients that would have improved comparisons of cost-effectiveness.
In brief, for comparable patients, 30-day mortality was
lower at teaching hospitals for AMI, HF, and PNA, with larger
differences for high-risk patients. The cost of treating lowerrisk patients was lower at teaching hospitals, while higher-risk
patients accrued higher costs at teaching hospitals but had
significantly better outcomes, suggesting that extra resources
used at major teaching versus non-teaching hospitals represented good value.
