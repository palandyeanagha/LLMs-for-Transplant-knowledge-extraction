Abstract Patient survival after cardiac, liver, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is improving; however, this
survival is limited by substantial pretransplant and treatmentrelated toxicities. A major cause of morbidity and mortality
after transplant is chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the
majority of CKD after transplant is attributed to the use of
calcineurin inhibitors, various other conditions such as
thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome, and focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis have been described. Though
the immunosuppression used for each of the transplant types,
cardiac, liver and HSCT is similar, the risk factors for
developing CKD and the CKD severity described in patients
after transplant vary. As the indications for transplant and the
long-term survival improves for these children, so will the
burden of CKD. Nephrologists should be involved early in
the pretransplant workup of these patients. Transplant physicians and nephrologists will need to work together to identify
those patients at risk of developing CKD early to prevent its
development and progression to end-stage renal disease.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent and increasingly recognized complication of solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), increasing the
complexity of patient management and impacting survival.
The incidence of CKD after cardiac, liver, and HSCT varies
from 7–86% in pediatric patients, partly due to the lack of a
uniform definition of CKD after transplant (Table 1). Up to
16% of transplant survivors will develop end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) [1–19].
This review focuses on the epidemiology, risk factors,
and outcomes of children who develop CKD after liver,
cardiac, lung, heart–lung, and stem cell transplant.
Liver transplant
Epidemiology
The majority of studies of renal disease after liver transplantation has been done in adults, and the cumulative incidence of
CKD varies from 5% to 30% over 1–5 years after transplant
[20]. In a retrospective study of 117 pediatric liver transplant
patients who survived 3 years after transplant (median 7.6,
range 3–14.6 years), the prevalence of CKD, defined as a
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <70 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at
last follow-up was 32% [1]. In a 10-year follow-up study of
12 children undergoing a liver transplant in France, mild to
moderate CKD (mild = GFR 60–80 ml/min per 1.73 m2
;
moderate = GFR 20–60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
) developed in
six of seven patients. Early deterioration of renal function is
usually seen within the first year following transplant,
followed by a period of stabilization, then with progression
on long-term follow-up [2, 3]. In contrast, in a study of 50
pediatric liver transplant patients in Poland, CKD stages 2
and 3 as defined by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF/KDOQI) (Table 2)
developed at 1 year after transplant and remained stable after
3 years of follow-up [4]. In this study, GFR was calculated

using both diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)
plasma clearance and estimated using the Schwartz formula.
Little correlation was found between the two methods with
the Schwartz formula, consistently overestimating GFR [4].
Therefore, the prevalence of CKD is likely underestimated in
this patient population if estimated measures of GFR or
serum creatinine are used to define CKD.
Risk factors for developing CKD
Many patients will have renal disease at the time of liver
transplant secondary to hepatorenal syndrome and/or acute
tubular necrosis. In one study, renal histology pretransplant
revealed glomerulosclerosis and other mild glomerular
changes with mesangial matrix expansion, capillary-wall
changes, and mesangial immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and
IgM in the majority of cases despite normal serum
creatinines [21]. Ultrasonographic findings included
nephromegaly and increased echogenicity, which improved
in the majority of cases after transplant [22]. In pediatric
patients, there can be renal involvement from the primary
liver disease, as in patients with primary hyperoxaluria,
autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, Alagille’s
syndrome, and tyrosinemia (Table 3). Renal dysfunction in
patients with these disorders often improves after liver
transplant. However, the long-term affects of preexisting
renal disease on developing CKD after orthotopic liver
transplant has not been studied systematically in pediatric
patients. In contrast, in adult liver transplant patients who
develop acute renal failure during the peri- and postoperative periods, there is an increased risk for developing CKD
after transplant [23] and progression to CKD stage 5
requiring dialysis [24].
Other identified risk factors (Table 4) for CKD include
GFR <70 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 1 year after transplant and
cyclosporine use [1]. In this study, there was an inverse
relationship between hypertension at 1 year after transplant
and development of renal dysfunction. In addition, in adult
patients, preexisting diabetes, pre- and postoperative renal
failure, hypertension, age, female gender, and hepatitis C
infection increased the risk of CKD and ESRD [20]. Though
the majority of renal dysfunction after liver transplant is
attributed to the use of cyclosporine and/or tacrolimus, there
have been reports of other types of pathology present leading
to CKD. Studies have found preexisting renal disease such as
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and hepatitis-Crelated injury including membranoproliferative glomeruloneTable 2 National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes

phritis, unresolved hepatorenal syndrome, and diabetic
nephropathy on renal biopsy after liver transplant [25, 26].
Calcineurin inhibitors
The use of cyclosporine (CSA) and tacrolimus in managing
liver transplant patients has greatly improved outcomes.
However, the improvement in survival is associated with an
increased development of CKD. The manifestations of CSA
toxicity range from asymptomatic azotemia and proteinuria
to fulminant multiorgan failure [27]. In addition to the
commonly described striped fibrosis and arterial and
vascular lesions seen in patients on these medications,
thrombotic microangiopathy has also been described in as
many as 50% of patients after liver transplant [25]. These
lesions are typically characterized by mesangiolysis, thrombus formation within glomerular capillaries, and widening
of the subendothelial spaces. The nephrotoxic effects of
CSA correlate with drug serum levels and therapy duration.
CSA is also known to cause arteriolar injury, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis, as well as diffuse
expansion of the mesangial matrix [28, 29]. The hypothesized mechanisms behind this injury appears to be
vasoconstriction secondary to an imbalance between the
vasodilatory hormones such as prostaglandin E1 and
vasoconstrictive ones such as thromboxane A2 [30].
Increased synthesis of transforming growth factor (TGF)-
β1 by calcineurin inhibitors also contributes to the
development of CKD in patients after transplant, and
genetic polymorphisms in the TGF-β1 gene have been
associated with the development of ESRD after cardiac
transplant [31].
Reducing calcineurin inhibitor levels while adding
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with CKD 5
years after liver transplant resulted in renal function
improvements as measured by serum creatinine and
creatinine clearance after 24 months of combined therapy,
with only minor changes noted in immune function in these
patients. Decreases in microalbuminuria were also noted
[32]. Some authors have suggested that thrice-daily dosing
of cyclosporine leads to decreased nephrotoxicity and only
mild histopathologic changes in the kidney after 3 years of
follow-up [33]. The authors attribute their findings to more
constant trough blood levels and lower, less toxic, peak
levels as well as the use of a calcium-channel blockers to
manage their patients’ hypertension [33]. In a case series,
three children who underwent combined liver and kidney
transplant were switched to sirolimus because of prolonged
renal failure requiring dialysis and acute calcineurin
inhibitor toxicity on biopsy. All three demonstrated improved renal function with cessation of dialysis [34]. These
studies suggest that decreasing calcineurin inhibitor exposure by adding MMF or eliminating long-term exposure by
switching to sirolimus can have beneficial effects on renal
function in children after liver transplantation.
Cardiac transplantation
Epidemiology
Approximately 350 pediatric cardiac transplants are performed annually in the USA [7]. In a 2006 report from the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation,
the incidence of renal dysfunction (defined as an abnormal
serum creatinine) was 10% at 5 years after cardiac
transplant [6]. Sixty-three percent of patients had hypertension. After 8 years of follow-up, the percentage of patient
with renal dysfunction did not change, but 2% of patients
were on dialysis or had received a renal transplant. In
reports from single centers, the incidence of CKD at
approximately 10 years after cardiac transplant in pediatric
patients ranged from 7% to 54%; however, only a small
percentage of these patients progress to ESRD requiring
dialysis and/or renal transplantation [7–10]. Hypertension is
a more common finding, occurring in approximately 70%
of patients after transplant [7–10]. Some centers actually
report an improvement in kidney function in the first year
following cardiac transplant and stabilization thereafter [9].
In adult studies, there is an increased risk of mortality
associated with development of CKD [35, 36].
Risk factors for development of CKD after cardiac
transplant
A recent study of 2,032 pediatric cardiac transplant patients
transplanted between 1990 and 1999 identified pretransplant
dialysis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, African American
race, and previous transplant as risk factors for developing
CKD (defined in this study as a creatinine >2.5 mg/dl) [37].
Additional risk factors for developing ESRD included
pretransplant diabetes and intensive care unit stay or
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [37]. In the adult
population, several risk factors for CKD development have
been identified and include older age at transplant, pretransplant serum creatinine, preexisting diabetes, abnormal GFR
at 1 year after transplant, hypertension after transplant, and
cyclosporine immunosuppression within the first 6 months
after transplant [12, 35, 36, 38, 39]. Risk factors for
progression to ESRD include postoperative development of
hypertension and proteinuria of >1 g/24 h [13, 40].
Calcineurin inhibitors
Though the nephrotoxic effects of calcineurin inhibitors are
well known, data in the pediatric cardiac transplant
Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:879–888 881

population are conflicting. After 18 months of triple
immunosuppression including cyclosporine, patients’ GFR
remained stable, and renal biopsy specimens in four
patients did not show signs of cyclosporine toxicity [41].
Minor abnormalities in tubular function resulting in
hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia were reported. Similarly,
in a study of adult cardiac transplant patients treated with
cyclosporine for 5 years, GFR (measured by inulin
clearance) remained stable at 66 ml/min per 1.73 m2
, as
did tubular function. The only abnormalities noted were
hypertension and the presence of microalbuminuria. However, other studies of pediatric cardiac transplant patients
found an association between cyclosporine use within the
first 2 months after transplant and decreases in GFR years
after transplant [42]. High cyclosporine levels (>500 μg/L)
in the first 6 months after cardiac transplant were associated
with developing ESRD at anytime after cardiac transplant
[43]. In a pediatric study of 14 patients with progressive
decline in renal function over 2–5 years, inulin clearance
declined from 84 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 1 year to 49.8 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 at 5 years. Biopsies performed on 13
patients revealed chronic tubulointerstitial lesions of grade
II associated with acute changes of vacuolization of the
proximal tubules. Arteriolar lesions were also present,
along with focal glomerular scarring and fibrosis. Lesion
extent correlated with calcineurin therapy duration. After
reduction in calcineurin inhibitor dose by 50% and change
from azathioprine to MMF, a 67% improvement in GFR
(77 ml/min per 1.73 m2
) was noted 1 year after the change.
The authors suggest that this improvement may be related
to a decrease in preglomerular vasoconstriction [44]. In a
study of pediatric patients treated with tacrolimus after
transplant, 41% of patients had elevations in serum
creatinine of 1–2 mg/dl approximately 2–3 years after
transplant [45].
Heart–lung and lung transplantation
Epidemiology
The cumulative incidence of CKD, defined as a doubling of
serum creatinine, after lung or heart–lung transplantation
varies from 34% at 1 year after transplant to 53% by 5 years
after transplant [11]. ESRD occurs in 7.3–16% of patients
5 years after transplant [11–13]. The majority of patients,
51%, developed CKD stage 3 by 1 year posttransplant [12].
Risk factors for CKD after heart–lung and lung transplant
Risk factors identified for developing CKD in a study of
219 patients undergoing a lung or a heart–lung transplant
include cumulative periods of a diastolic blood pressure
>90 mmHg and serum creatinine value at 1 month
posttransplant [11]. In this same study, the authors found
that tacrolimus use in the first 6 months posttransplant
decreased the risk of CKD compared with those who
received cyclosporine alone. Other studies found GFR at 1
month to be a predictor of later CKD [12]. Development of
postoperative hypertension is associated with an increased
risk of ESRD after lung and heart–lung transplants [13].
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant
Epidemiology
The cumulative incidence of CKD varies from 13% to 60%
in adult studies [15–17] to as high as 62% in children [14].
CKD usually becomes apparent 6–12 months after HSCT,
although it has been described as early as 2 months and as
late as 10 years posttransplant. Though this section
discusses injury that occurs after HSCT, baseline or
pretransplant renal function can impact the results [46].
Therefore, baseline assessments not only of serum creatinine but also urinalyses and more formal estimations of
GFR are warranted. Accurate assessment of baseline renal
function can help guide later medication dosing.
There are three distinct clinical manifestations of renal
disease that can occur in the HSCT patient: thrombotic
microangiopathy (TMA), typically hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)-related
CKD, and nephrotic syndrome (NS). TMA syndromes
represent a spectrum of clinical diseases characterized by
systemic or intrarenal platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular fragmentation of erythrocytes.
Platelet aggregation can result in ischemia and organ injury.
When renal injury is predominant, a diagnosis of HUS is
usually rendered, whereas the presence of extensive
extrarenal manifestations leads to a diagnosis of thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (reviewed in [47]).
Histopathology of TMA after HSCT
Microscopic examination of kidney biopsy specimens from
patients with TMA-associated CKD demonstrates mesangiolysis and loss of endothelial cells with expansion of the
subendothelium and occlusion of capillary loops. On electron
micrographs, there is extensive widening of the space between
the glomerular basement membrane and the subendothelium,
with amorphous deposits that are not immune complexes.
Risk factors for HUS after HSCT
Though no clear relationships have been found to date for
the development of TMA after HSCT, a number of risk
882 Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:879–888

factors have been examined. In earlier studies, where HUS
was the primary diagnosis, risk factors identified were total
body irradiation (TBI) [14, 15, 48, 49] and calcineurin
inhibitor use [15, 27, 50–54]. However, in more recent
studies of TMA, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
grades 2–4, older age, and transplant from an unrelated
donor are the primary risk factors identified [55, 56]. Other
investigators identified sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,
matched unrelated donors or haploidentical donors, and
lymphoid malignancy as significant predictors of TMA
after HSCT in addition to the above risk factors [17, 57–
59]. However, in children who develop HUS after HSCT,
the presumptive risk factor in these studies was TBI used as
part of the conditioning regimen. For example, Tarbell et al.
studied 44 children (aged 3–15 years) with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or neuroblastoma (NB) who underwent HSCT [14]. Twenty-nine of these patients were alive
and in remission 3 months after HSCT and were evaluated
in the study. Eleven patients developed increases in blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and ten were anemic
and thrombocytopenic with evidence of hemolysis on
peripheral blood smear; they also had elevated lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In every patient except one,
the hemolytic process resolved, yet renal insufficiency
persisted. The pathologic findings of mesangiolysis with
intraglomerular capillary aneurysm formation in conjunction with laboratory abnormalities support the diagnosis of
HUS in these children. In another small study, Antignac
et al. described seven children referred to their nephrology
clinic with CKD approximately 5–10 months after TBI
followed by HSCT [48]. All seven children had leukemia,
and all received cyclophosphamide alone or with cytosine
arabinoside and vepeside, in addition to single-dose TBI as
part of their conditioning regimen. Three patients developed
CKD without hypertension, and four developed HUS with
severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
Of these, two of the four had normalization of their renal
function. Follow-up biopsies, however, showed extensive
scarring of the renal parenchyma but almost complete
resolution of the mesangiolysis. The glomeruli were globally
sclerotic, ischemic, or demonstrated mesangial hypercellularity. Thus, there was evidence of persistent and progressive
renal damage in these patients despite normalization of
serum creatinine and urinalysis. The occurrence of two
different clinical presentations, CKD without hypertension
and HUS with hypertension, but similar pathology in these
children supports the notion that this is a spectrum of disease
rather than distinct pathophysiologic processes.
GVHD-related CKD
GVHD-related CKD in this patient population is usually
defined as an elevated serum creatinine or an abnormal
GFR 6–12 months after transplant. The incidence of
GVHD-related CKD in children after HSCT varies from
11% to 41% [60–63]. In one recent study, the incidence of
CKD (GFR <70 ml/min per 1.73 m2
) changed over time,
with 41% of children having CKD at 1 year, 31% at
3 years, and only 11% 7 years after transplant [63]. In
approximately 19% of patients, hematuria and proteinuria
persisted up to 10 years after HSCT. Berg and Bolme
followed 44 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and severe
aplastic anemia (SAA) and found a significant decrease in
GFR 1–2 years after HSCT when compared with their
baseline GFR (ALL and AML groups) or with a healthy
control group despite serum creatinines that remained
within normal limits. An initial decrease in GFR was
followed by stabilization up to 5 years posttransplant [64].
This study supports the contention that serum creatinine is
not an accurate measure of kidney function. Serum
creatinine level and related estimating equations, routinely
used clinical measures to estimate kidney function, are
dependent on muscle mass and are influenced by age, race,
gender, and weight [65, 66]. Patients undergoing HSCT
may have large fluctuations in their nutritional status,
muscle mass, and weight that will influence GFR based
on estimation equations or serum creatinine levels. Proximal tubular dysfunction has also been described in 14–45%
of pediatric patients 1–2 years after HSCT, with initial
injury to the proximal tubules being nonspecific as reflected
by elevated urinary excretion of alpha-1 microglobulin and
beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (β-NAG) followed by more
specific damage manifested by decreases in phosphate
reabsorption [67].
Risk factors for GVHD-related CKD
The risk factors for GVHD-related CKD in children are
similar to those identified in adult studies. Kist-van Holthe
et al. also retrospectively identified risk factors for
developing both acute and chronic renal insufficiency in a
cohort of 142 children undergoing transplant over a period
of 5 years in the Netherlands [68]. All children received
allogeneic transplants. Ninety-one children received radiation, and 82 of these 91 received TBI. Twenty-five children
(18%) had CKD (defined as a GFR <85 ml/min per
1.73 m2
). These authors found no correlation between
radiation dose used and renal insufficiency at 1 year. In a
later study from the same group, only acute renal
insufficiency predicted the later development of CKD in
patients after HSCT [62]. These studies contradict others in
the literature that found TBI to be associated with renal
injury [60, 61, 69]. However, the doses used here (5–8 Gy
in a single fraction) were much lower than described
elsewhere. In a study of 92 pediatric HSCT patients by van
Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:879–888 883

Why et al., late renal insufficiency developed in 18 of 64
(28%) patients; in half of these patients, the renal disease
persisted for 3 months to 3 years [60]. Amphotericin B use,
cyclosporine, and TBI were associated with the later
development of CKD. In a large retrospective review of
1,635 children and adults, risk factors for developing CKD
after HSCT included acute renal failure and acute and
chronic GVHD [17]. In this study, TBI was not associated
with development of CKD.
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) after HSCT
Chronic GVHD may manifest itself in the kidney as NS
with or without renal insufficiency (reviewed in [70]).
Patients usually present with proteinuria, edema, and
hypoalbuminemia. The majority of these case reports
demonstrate membranous nephropathy (MN) with subepithelial deposits on biopsy; it is postulated that these
deposits are antigen/antibody complexes representing
GVHD in the kidney. However, cases of minimal-change
disease (MCD), which is thought to be a T-cell-mediated
process, have also been described [70]. Comparisons
between case reports of MN and MCD after HSCT found
that MN occurs in 61% of cases compared with 22% of
cases having MCD [71]. The majority of reported patients
with MN were slightly older males with a history of acute
and chronic GVHD. Both MCD and MN occur later after
transplant, at 8 and 14 months, respectively, and tend to occur
within 1–5 months of GVHD development and/or the tapering
of immunosuppression for their chronic GVHD. MN is more
difficult to treat, with only 27% of patients reportedly
achieving remission compared with 90% of patients with
MCD [71]. Others have reported cases of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, anti-nuclear-cytoplasmic-antibody
(ANCA)-related glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and IgA nephropathy [72–76] occurring after
HSCT. The development of each of these diseases seems to
be associated with chronic GVHD and/or immunosuppression tapering. Treatment with high-dose prednisone and/or
reinstitution of calcineurin inhibitors usually results in resolution of NS. Some physicians have used rituximab successfully
in patients with NS after HSCT, typically in cases of MN [77].
Management of CKD after liver, cardiac, lung,
and HSCT
Patients who develop CKD after liver, cardiac, lung, and
hematopoietic stem cell transplants are at increased risk of
mortality [18, 26, 78]. Transplant physicians and nephrologists should work together starting from the time prior to
transplant to monitor these patients closely. More accurate
measures of kidney function are needed, and baseline and
follow-up iohexol or iothalamate studies to measure GFR
may be indicated to identify patients with underlying CKD
prior to transplant and to allow early identification and
intervention in patients with mild changes in GFR
posttransplant. New markers to estimate GFR, such as
cystatin C, may be more informative in certain patient
populations than is serum creatinine. Cystatin C is a
cysteine protease inhibitor expressed by all nucleated cells
and is freely filtered by the glomerulus. Serum cystatin C
correlates well with measured GFR and more accurately
measures kidney function than does serum creatinine in the
elderly, cancer patients, diabetics, and renal transplant
recipients [79–83]. Normal ranges for cystatin C have been
validated in children. The normal reference range for
children older than 1 year is 0.7–1.38 mg/dl [84]. An
equation to estimate GFR based on cystatin C levels in
children has also been created: log (GFR) = 1.962 +
[1.123*log(1/cystatin C)] [85]. Urinalyses including a
microalbumin to creatinine ratio should also be part of the
pretransplant workup, and urinalyses should be monitored
closely following transplant.
Animal models of HSCT, and specifically of radiationinduced HUS, offer potential interventions for patients with
HUS after HSCT. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been used in rodent models of HSCTrelated renal injury. The use of captopril or enalapril at the
time of TBI in these animals resulted in less azotemia, lower
blood pressures, decreased proteinuria, and long-term preservation of renal function [86]. ACEI and angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) also help reduce inflammation and inflammatory markers and reduce circulating levels of TGF-β1 in
patients after transplant [87–90]. These agents have also been
shown to slow CKD progression and decrease proteinuria in
patients with renal disease from various causes [91, 92].
Hypertension management early after transplant is
important to prevent CKD development and progression
to ESRD in certain transplant populations. ARBs and
ACEIs have been shown to be effective and safe in
managing hypertension in cardiac transplant patients [93],
and ACEIs have been shown to stabilize renal function over
2 years of follow-up [94]. These drugs should be
considered as first-line agents to manage hypertension in
patients after transplant. In addition, hyperlipidemia management may be important to prevent CKD after transplant.
In a study of adult patients undergoing a cardiac transplant,
statin use was associated with a decreased risk of
development of CKD after transplant [78]. The difficult
decision is when to intervene (Fig. 1). Should patients be
started on these medications prior to transplant, at the first
signs of hypertension and microalbuminuria, or at some set
time point after transplant to help protect their kidneys?
These decisions need to be made on an individual basis and
will vary based on the type of transplant. Frequent
884 Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:879–888

discussions between the transplant physician and nephrologist are required to optimize the management of patients
with CKD after transplant.
In addition to the above medications, immunosuppression adjustment is important in managing the CKD that
develops after transplant, further supporting the need for
close collaboration between transplant physicians and
nephrologists. In two reported series of lung transplant
recipients, sirolimus was used to decrease and eventually
stop calcineurin inhibitors in patients with CKD after
transplant. Patients had a sustained improvement in kidney
function as reflected by a decrease in serum creatinine for
1–12 months [95, 96]. However, prior to changes in
immunosuppression, a kidney biopsy may be indicated to
define the etiology of the kidney injury and better tailor
therapy to prevent or slow disease progression.
Management of patients with ESRD after transplant
include the use of peritoneal and/or hemodialysis. Caring
for these patients also involves management of complications associated with ESRD, which include anemia, bone
disease, hypertension, and metabolic abnormalities. There
have been case series of patients undergoing renal transplantation successfully after cardiac, liver or HSCT; renal
transplantation is a viable option for patients with ESRD
after transplant and can improve outcomes [19, 97–101].
