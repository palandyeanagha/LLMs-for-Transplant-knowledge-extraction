The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative Wisteria foribunda 
agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) in predicting overall survival for patients with 
hepatitis B- and hepatitis C-related early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (ESHCC) after liver resection. 
Post-operative survival rates were compared according to WFA+-M2BP level and tumor stage. Six 
hundred and ten patients were identifed and 198 were removed after application of the exclusion 
criteria; the median follow-up time was 4.33 years, and cancer-related death occurred in 117 (28.4%) 
patients. Age (p=0.03), fbrosis grade (p=0.042), cancer stage (p=0.01), and WFA+-M2BP level 
(p=0.001) were identifed as independent risk factors for poor overall survival. The overall survival rates 
at 3 and 5 years for patients with WFA+-M2BP≤1.12 were 0.92 and 0.90, respectively, and 0.76 and 
0.61 for patients with WFA+-M2BP>1.12 (p<0.001). During the analysis of survival prediction, serum 
WFA+-M2BP level exhibited a higher log-likelihood and a lower AIC value compared to TNM stage (log 
likelihood: −638; AIC: 1279). Pre-operative serum WFA+-M2BP level provided important prognostic 
information after curative hepatic resection in our study.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high prevalence in the Asia 
Pacifc region where hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are frequent1
. In Taiwan, 
the disease is the leading cause of cancer mortality and afects 25/100,000 men and 10/100,000 women every 
year2
. Liver transplantation has been shown to be a curative surgical management that also addresses underlying 
cirrhosis3
, but hepatic resection remains the frst option for patients with adequate reserve liver functionality 
as a result of limited organ availability4
. Despite improvements in treatment strategies, HCC continues to present major challenges in management and its death rate remains high even afer curative hepatectomy. Several 
tumor markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3) and 
Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP), have been demonstrated to have prognostic value in HCC patients5
, 
and their elevation refects the progression of the disease. Yet the signifcance of these tumor markers is lower 
in patients with early stage HCC, and it could be challenging to employ these pretreatment tumor markers for 
forecasting the result of treatable early stage HCC.
Liver fbrosis is a common risk factor for the development of HCC, and the association of liver fbrosis with 
prognosis afer curative hepatectomy has been demonstrated in previous studies6,7
. Furthermore, approximately 
80% of HCC patients are associated with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infections and varying degrees of liver 
fbrosis and cirrhosis3
. Tus, assessment of the severity of liver fbrosis is essential when evaluating the prognosis of patients with HCC liver fbrosis, but it is ofen associated with signifcant costs and a risk of bleeding. 
Non-invasive and reliable methods are therefore urgently needed, and several modalities have been investigated. 
Serum Wisteria foribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) level has been recognized

as a novel biomarker for liver fbrosis and has been determined to be superior to other conventional markers in 
discrimination capability with respect to liver fbrosis8–11. Furthermore, WFA+-M2BP has been used as a predictor of HCC development in chronic hepatitis patients12. However, the association between it and prognosis 
in early stage HCC patients remains unknown. Since HBV and HCV infections are the most important causes 
of HCC and account for 80% of HCC cases globally3
, we aim to evaluate the clinical signifcance of pretreatment serum WFA+-M2BP level as it relates to liver fbrosis, focusing on patients with HBV- and HCV- related 
early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (ESHCC) who undergo liver resection. Tis information can be crucial in 
improving surgical options with respect to risks and potential benefts in this setting.
Results
Clinical characteristics. Six hundred and ten patients were identifed and 198 were removed afer application of the exclusion criteria; this lef a fnal cohort of 412 patients. Te clinical profle of the patient cohort 
is shown in Table 1. Te mean age was 63.1 years, and there was a male predominance (74.8%). Te number 
of cases of HBV HCC and HCV HCC were 240 (58.3%) and 172 (41.7%), respectively. Fibrosis stage based on 
the METAVIR score was F0 for 5 cases (1.2%), F1 for 50 cases (12.1%), F2 for 116 cases (28.2%), F3 for 94 cases 
(22.8%) and F4 for 147 cases (35.7%). Te median follow-up time was 4.33 years. Cancer-related death occurred 
in 117 (28.4%) patients, and 295 patients survived. Using the ROC curve, we determined the recommended 
cutof value of WFA+-M2BP was 1.12 with a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specifcity of 52.5%. Te AUC value was 
0.694 (95% CI: 0.647–0.738, p<0.0001). We further conducted subgroup analyses on HBV HCC and HCV HCC 
cohorts to determine the optimal cut-of values in predicting the overall survival. Te optimal cut-of values were 
1.12 (sensitivity: 71.4%, specifcity: 60.9%) and 2.26 (sensitivity: 62.3%, specifcity: 72.1%) for the HBV and HCV 
groups, respectively (Table 2). With the cut-of value of 1.12, patients were stratifed into a low WFA+-M2BP

group (n=175) and a high WFA+-M2BP group (n=237). Table 1 compares the clinical and laboratory parameters of the two groups. Te high WFA+-M2BP group was older and less frequently male and had a signifcantly 
higher proportion of patients with AFP>20ng/mL. It also had higher AST and ALT levels, and its platelet count 
and median follow-up time were lower.
Correlation between liver fbrosis and serum WFA+-M2BP level. Diagnostic test performance of 
WFA+-M2BP values in liver fbrosis is shown in Table 3. Te AUC values in predicting fbrosis stages ≥F2, ≥F3, 
and ≥F4 were 0.670 (95% CI: 0.622–0.715, p<0.0001), 0.697 (95% CI: 0.651–0.741, p<0.0001), and 0.705 (95% 
CI: 0.658–0.749, p<0.0001), respectively. Optimal cut-of values were 1.03 for ≥F2 (sensitivity: 67.2%, specifcity: 61.8%), 1.90 for ≥F3 (sensitivity: 43.2%, specifcity: 87.1%), and 2.45 for ≥F4 (sensitivity: 41.5%, specifcity: 
89.8%). In the subgroup analysis of 240 HBV HCC patients, AUCs were 0.637, 0.634, and 0.666 for ≥F2, ≥F3, 
and ≥F4, respectively. Te optimal cutof values that best predicted fbrosis stages ≥F2, ≥F3, and ≥F4 were 1.03, 
1.32, and 1.03, respectively. Whereas in the analysis of the HCV HCC cohort, AUCs were 0.698, 0.792, and 0.801 
for ≥F2, ≥F3, and ≥F4, respectively.
Prognostic value of WFA+-M2BP levels on overall survival after hepatic resection. Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) survival analysis showed a signifcant diference in the probability of survival across the diferent TNM 
stages (Fig. 1). Te estimated 3- and 5-year overall survival rates afer liver resection in patients with TNM stage 
I were 91% and 83% compared to 79% and 67% in patients with TNM stage II. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the overall survival rates were higher in the TNM stage I group than in the TNM stage II group 
(p=0.002). Te association between serum WFA+-M2BP levels and overall survival is shown in Fig. 2. Te 
estimated 3- and 5-year overall survival rates afer liver resection in patients with WFA+-M2BP levels ≤ 1.12 
were 92% and 90% compared to 76% and 61% in patients with WFA+-M2BP levels >1.12. KM analysis demonstrated a signifcantly lower survival rate in patients with WFA+-M2BP levels >1.12 (p<0.001). Te estimated 
median survival time and the 3- and 5-year survival rates based on TNM stage and serum WFA+-M2BP level are 
summarized in Table 4. We next performed univariate and multivariate analyses to determine factors associated 
with cancer-related death. In the univariate analysis, variables associated with cancer-related death were age (HR: 
1.029, p=0.003), fbrosis grade (HR: 1.209, p=0.015), pre-operative serum AFP level (HR: 1.308, p=0.026),

tumor stage (HR: 1.854, p=0.003) and pre-operative serum WFA+-M2BP level (HR: 3.178, p<0.001). Risk 
factors for cancer-related death were further analyzed in a multivariate regression model to identify the most 
important factors (Table 5). Based on the multivariate regression model, only age (HR: 1.022,p=0.031), fbrosis 
grade (HR: 1.217, p=0.042), cancer stage (HR: 1.726, p=0.01) and WFA+-M2BP level (HR: 2.290, p=0.001) 
were independently associated with overall survival in patients with ESHCC. During the analysis of survival prediction, serum WFA+-M2BP level had a higher log-likelihood and a lower AIC value compared to TNM stage 
(WFA+-M2BP: log likelihood=−639, AIC=1280; TNM stage: log likelihood=−648, AIC=1298).
Discussion
Te present analysis of serum WFA+-M2BP covered HCC of diferent etiologies: HBV and HCV. Overall, the 
diagnostic performance in distinguishing between the diferent stages of fbrosis was found to be unsatisfactory 
in the current study (AUC: ≥F2=0.670, ≥F3=0.697, and ≥F4=0.705). However, as the severity of fbrosis 
increased, specifcity climbed from 61.8% to 89.8%, suggesting that WFA+-M2BP could be employed to identify 
advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis. In the subgroup analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of WFA+-M2BP was inferior 
in the HBV HCC cohort when compared to the HCV HCC cohort. Tis suggested fbrosis progression may

vary according to the etiology of the liver disease. HBV-related fbrosis was reported to be associated with large 
regenerative nodules with thin septa; moreover, the background fbrosis ofen fuctuates during the course of the 
disease13,14. In contrast, HCV-associated fbrosis has a more insidious course and a slower fbrosis progression and 
is correlated with small nodules. Terefore, we should be aware that the optimal cutof values of WFA+-M2BP for 
fbrosis vary according to the etiology of the chronic liver disease. A low specifcity of 52.5% was reported for the 
WFA+-M2BP cutof value of 1.12 (Table 2) in predicting the overall survival. However, when we conducted subgroup analyses, the optimal cut-of values were 1.12 (sensitivity: 71.4%, specifcity: 60.9%) and 2.26 (sensitivity: 
62.3%, specifcity: 72.1%) for the HBV HCC and HCV HCC groups, respectively. Tese increases in specifcity 
suggested that the WFA+-M2BP cutof value for predicting the overall survival may difer depending on the 
etiology, and the low specifcity reported in the frst place may be a result of the diversity of the studied subjects 
included in the present investigation.
Te proportion of F4 in patients with WFA+-M2BP>1.12 was signifcantly higher than that in patients with 
WFA+-M2BP≤1.12 (46.4% vs. 21.1%, p<0.001). Te results were reasonable as WFA+-M2BP has been designated as a meaningful predictor for liver fbrosis in various etiologies of chronic liver disease8,9,15. Te elevation 
of serum WFA+-M2BP levels refects the production of glycoproteins by hepatocytes during the process of liver 
fbrosis or infammation. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the main cell type responsible for WFA+-M2BP secretion, and the interaction of M2BP with Mac-2 expressing Kupfer cells would further modulate the activation of 
HSCs16. Activated HSCs then markedly contribute to liver fbrosis and portal hypertension, and they also play 
an important part in liver carcinogenesis and metastasis17. Terefore, recent studies have suggested the importance of WFA+-M2BP in the development of HCC as a modulator of liver fbrosis and tumor cell microenvironment12,18. Serum WFA+-M2BP levels were notably higher in patients with early stage steatosis (Table 1, n=223; 
59.0%) in our results, and this suggested that WFA+-M2BP could be a potential marker of early stage liver injury 
as previously reported. Nishikawa et al. showed a signifcant correlation between CRP concentration and liver 
infammatory activity in their earlier study of patients with autoimmune hepatitis15. Ura et al. also reported that 
the WFA+-M2BP level was positively correlated with ALT, AFP and the activity grade, and their data suggested 
the serum WFA+-M2BP level may be infuenced not only by fbrosis but also by liver infammation since ALT 
and AFP elevations refect liver infammation or regeneration19.
HCC is diferent from other solid tumors because the presence of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis infuence 
overall survival and treatment outcome. Many staging systems have been established, but there is no consensus on 
the best classifcation to employ. Te TNM system proved to be the best for prognostic stratifcation and prognostic prediction in an earlier study of 234 HCC patients who underwent curative resection in China20. However, the 
Okuda, Barcelona and Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP) staging systems were more efective for predicting 
outcomes in patients who underwent non-surgical therapy21. When the tumors were stratifed according to different TNM stages in our cohort, there was a statistically signifcant diference in overall survival between stage I 
and stage II. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that patients with stage II disease had a 72.6% higher risk 
(HR: 1.726, 95% CI=1.142–2.609) for mortality compared with those with stage I disease. Tis suggests that early 
diagnosis and treatment are essential to enhance survival in HCC patients. Despite its ease of use and convenience in the surgical setting, TNM staging may not be sufcient to stage HCC since the system does not consider

residual liver function, which is ofen crucial for the prognosis of HCC patients22,23. In the comparative analysis of 
the TNM staging system and WFA+-M2BP serum levels conducted by the current study, both prognostic tools 
were individually important in the prediction of overall survival among the analyzed population and displayed 
comparative predictive performance.
In the past two decades, the use of interferon-based antiviral therapy has resulted in the beneft of reducing development of cirrhosis and HCC for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who achieved sustained 
virological response (SVR). Te addition of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has further improved the SVR rates 
of antiviral therapy to more than 90%, even for patients with cirrhosis24. A recent meta-analysis showed that 
CHC individuals with SVR have a considerably reduced risk for HCC incidence and liver-related mortality as 
compared to treatment failure25. Several studies have focused on evaluating treatment efcacy for the association between serum WFA+-M2BP levels and prognostic performance afer achieving SVR. Sato et al. showed 
a signifcantly higher incidence of HCC development afer SVR in patients with high serum WFA+-M2BP 
(p<0.001)26. Furthermore, Hasegawa et al. reported that the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (p=0.0008), 
WFA+-M2BP < 6.15 COI (p = 0.013), achievement of sustained virological response (p < 0.0001) and 
des-carboxy prothrombin <41 mAU/mL (p=0.0018) were signifcantly favorable factors associated with survival in HCV-related compensated liver cirrhosis27.
In the present analysis, the patients with WFA+-M2BP>1.12 were older in age with higher AST and ALT levels 
and lower platelet counts. Previous reports demonstrated that older HCC patients are more likely to present with cirrhosis than younger patients, and this might be attributed to aged patients having a longer liver disease duration and 
subsequently a higher risk of cirrhosis development28,29. Elevated AST and ALT levels in patients with WFA+-M2BP 
levels >1.12 refect the current liver damage and acute liver infammation. A low platelet count has been a common 
fnding associated with HCC patients, which may be explained by the pooling of platelets in an enlarged spleen secondary to cirrhosis-induced portal hypertension30. Besides liver function tests, tumor progression is another important aspect to consider in HCC patients with regard to prognosis. Recent advances in imaging modality, such as 
multidetector-row CT and MRI, along with the development of contrast media have led to early detection of hepatic 
nodules, including small HCC tumors in the context of cirrhosis. Several tumor markers, including AFP, AFP-L3 
and DCP, have been established specifcally for disease management in patients with HCC3,5,31,32. Te elevation 
of these markers ofen takes place when the size and number of HCC lesions increase or an invasion of the portal 
vein occurs31–35, thus refecting HCC progression. But it would be difcult to employ serum tumor marker levels to 
forecast outcomes before curative treatments as their levels could be low in patients with early-stage HCC. A few 
studies compared the diagnostic performances of conventional biomarkers with WFA+-M2BP in detecting ESHCC, 
and the results have been inconsistent. Chuaypen et al. reported on 150 pairs of matched cases and found that 
WFA+-M2BP was superior to AFP in diferentiating ESHCC from advanced fbrosis without HCC18. Furthermore, 
previous data from Yamasaki et al. also indicated a better diagnostic performance of WFA+-M2BP than that of 
AFP for predicting HCC development in long-term follow-up of patients with chronic HCC infections36. In contrast, the study by Hasegawa et al. demonstrated that hyaluronic acid had a higher prognostic performance than 
WFA+-M2BP and other biomarkers in predicting overall survival among HCV-related HCC patients27.
Another meaningful result from our study is that we identifed WFA+-M2BP level before curative hepatectomy 
as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with early HCC; this was done through univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, the signifcantly diferent survival rates among the two groups of WFA+-M2BP levels 
(≤1.12 and t>1.12) supported a signifcant association between the WFA+-M2BP values and the overall survival 
of early stage HCC patients. Unlike tumor markers mentioned earlier, serum WFA+-M2BP level was not correlated 
with tumor stage and size, hence it would be a better biomarker of disease progression and overall prognosis.
Furthermore, our analysis revealed that increasing age is another independent factor for poor overall survival. 
Tere are a few studies assessing the infuence of age on post-resection outcomes in HCC, and the results have 
been inconsistent. Kaibori et al.
37 reported on 12,587 patients in a Japanese nationwide study that indicated that 
elderly patients had signifcantly worse overall survival afer hepatectomy than young patients. In contrast, Su 
et al.
38 and Tan et al.39 both suggested older patients with adequate remnant liver reserves and good liver functionality should be considered for curative resection since age was not determined as an independent predictor 
for overall survival postoperatively. Liver functionality is a crucial factor afecting the prognosis of patients with 
HCC. However, parameters like bilirubin and albumin were not found to be signifcantly associated with overall 
survival in our univariate analysis. Tis might be attributed to our study design, which targeted on those patients 
with good liver functionality and mild fbrosis who could undergo curative resection in the frst place.
Tere are a few limitations to our study. First, this was a retrospective, single institution study, although studied patients were followed prospectively. Second, the current study was limited to early stage HCC patients, and 
the predictive and prognostic value of WFA+-M2BP in patients with more advanced HCC remained to be investigated. Furthermore, the association between the changes in WFA+-M2BP and fbrosis could not be measured 
as repeated liver biopsies were not performed during the follow-up period. Terefore, further prospective studies 
with greater sample sizes are necessary and our results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, in the 
current study we demonstrated that serum WFA+-M2BP level at diagnosis before surgery can be helpful for predicting the overall survival. In conclusion, our data suggest that evaluating WFA+-M2BP before curative surgery 
is an easy, noninvasive and useful apparatus not only for predicting the fbrosis stage in early-stage HCC, but also 
for estimating prognosis.
Methods
Study. Tis study was approved by the institutional review board of Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 
Taiwan (No. 120611 and No. 150815), and written informed consent for the use of their clinical specimens was 
obtained from all participants. Our institutional prospectively maintained database was reviewed to identify 
pathologically confrmed HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy with curative intent between April 2009

and January 2016. Te diagnosis of HCC was based on typical imaging with positive enhancement in the arterial phase followed by contrast washout in the delayed phase or histopathology by biopsy in cases with atypical 
enhancing patterns as reported in our previous study40. Exclusion criteria were stage III/IV HCC, lost to follow-up, concurrent presence of other types of cancer, non-cancer related death and non-B, non-C HCC. Disease 
stage was classifed on the basis of the 2010 staging system of the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) 
TNM criteria. Using the METAVIR score system, the severity of liver fbrosis was determined histopathologically 
in resected non-cancerous liver tissue on a scale of 0 to 441. In short, tissue samples were fxed in bufered formalin 
and embedded in parafn. Samples were subjected to standard techniques for hematoxylin and eosin and Masson 
trichrome staining. Blood samples were collected during the outpatient preoperative evaluation or on the day 
of admission. Clinical parameters of interest included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), liver function test and 
etiologic factors predisposing toward HCC. All study procedures were performed in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and regulations.
Measurement of WFA+-M2BP. Pretreatment serum levels of WFA+-M2BP were quantified by a 
lectin-Ab sandwich immunoassay using a commercially available kit (HISCL-800; sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan)8,9
, 
followed by adjustments during the automatic assay.
End points and statistical analysis. Time to event was defned as the interval from the defnite surgery 
to the date of cancer related death. Clinicopathological characteristics were compared by the Mann-Whitney U
test for medians and the chi-square test for proportions. Risk factors infuencing overall survival were analyzed 
by univariate and multivariate methods using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. A hazard ratio 
(HR) and its 95% confdence interval (CI) were determined for each independent risk factor. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to determine the optimal cut-of value for WFA+-M2BP based 
on the Youden index42. Te diagnostic performance of the cut-of value was expressed in terms of the diagnostic 
sensitivity, specifcity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were generated 
to compare the survival outcomes43, and a two-sided log rank test was used to test the diferences between the 
survival experiences regarding diferent cancer stages (I and II) and WFA+-M2BP levels44. Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors related to overall survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. 
Variables that reached statistical signifcance were further included in the multivariate analysis. Te prognostic 
performance among the studied population of a stage system or scoring system was statistically assessed using 
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and log likelihood. Te best model for predicting overall survival would 
be a model with a lower AIC value and a higher log likelihood value. Statistical analyses were performed using 
MedCalc for Windows (version 18.11.6, MedCalc Sofware bvba, Ostend, Belgium) and the statistical package 
SPSS for Windows (version 20.0.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA); a signifcance level of 5% was used throughout.
