Increased economic interdependence, social integration, and other aspects of globalization
are contributing to significant changes in hepatitis A epidemiology. Globally, the incidence of
hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is decreasing, the age at midpoint of population immunity
(AMPI) is increasing, and the proportion of symptomatic cases is increasing as the average age
at infection increases. In low-income countries, HAV remains endemic but improved water
and sanitation systems are reducing transmission rates among young children. In high-income
countries, most adults remain susceptible to HAV and foodborne outbreaks are becoming
more frequent. Middle-income countries have diverse epidemiological profiles, and they
play important roles in the global spread of HAV through international trade and travel.
Future changes in the epidemiology of hepatitis A will be heavily influenced by globalization
processes.
Globalization is a process characterized by
countries and people around the world becoming more interdependent and integrated
across economic, political, cultural, and other
domains. Evidence for globalization can be observed in the increasing rates of cross-border
trade, the growing complexity of international
supply chains, the rising pace of international
travel and migration, and the social and cultural
changes that are occurring as online communication makes it easy for people from different
parts of the world to interact. The globalization
of economic markets and sociocultural practices
is influencing human behaviors, altering the
ways people interact socially and with the environment, and modifying the ways people conceive of health and seek health services (Huynen
et al. 2005). For infectious diseases generally,
and for hepatitis A specifically, the globalization
of trade and travel are important drivers of epidemiological change (Suk et al. 2014; Semenza
et al. 2016).
This article summarizes the current epidemiology of hepatitis A in countries with different income levels and endemicity patterns,
describes the major socioeconomic and environmental changes that are contributing to
hepatitis A epidemiological transitions, examines the specific roles of international food
trade and international travel on hepatitis A
epidemiology, and uses globalization theory to
predict the changes that are likely to occur in
hepatitis A epidemiology over the next several
decades.

HEPATITIS A VIRUS (HAV) EPIDEMIOLOGY
Tens of millions of individuals worldwide contract HAV through fecal–oral transmission each
year, usually via ingestion of contaminated food
or water or through contact with an infectious
person (Rein et al. 2014). Young children who
are exposed to the virus usually have no symptoms of disease, but older children and adults
often experience several weeks of jaundice and a
lengthy convalescence, and they are at risk of
acute liver failure and death. Symptomatic hepatitis A patients typically miss several weeks of
work or school, and the costs of medical care can
be substantial (Berge et al. 2000). Globally, the
HAV incidence rate is decreasing and the average age at infection is increasing (Rein et al.
2014). However, there are major differences in
the profiles of countries with different socioeconomic profiles (Jacobsen 2009).
Low-income countries typically have high
HAV incidence rates. Surveillance for incident
hepatitis A cases can be difficult in high-incidence areas because the majority of cases occur
in young children who remain asymptomatic.
However, even asymptomatic infections confer
long-term immunity against HAV that can be
detected with serologic tests. Seroprevalence
studies in low-income countries typically show
that nearly 100% of older children and adults
have anti-HAV immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels
indicating prior infection with HAV and that
the majority of young children already have
serologic evidence of past infection (Jacobsen
2009). The age at midpoint of population immunity (AMPI) is the youngest age at which half
of the birth cohort has serologic evidence of prior exposure to HAV. In most sub-Saharan African countries and other very low-income areas,
the AMPI is less than 5 years (Jacobsen and
Wiersma 2010), which means that more than
half of preschool-aged children have already
contracted HAV and developed immunity as a
result of their infection. These prevalence statistics in children provide ample evidence of high
HAV incidence rates in low-income countries.
High-income countries usually have low or
very low HAV incidence rates, and seroprevalence studies typically show an AMPI that is in
middle adulthood. For example, in many Western and Northern European countries, the
AMPI is above 50 years, which means that
more than half of 50-year-olds and the vast majority of children and younger adults remain
susceptible to HAV infection (Kurkela et al.
2012; Carrillo-Santisteve et al. 2017). When a
large proportion of hepatitis A cases occur
among adolescents and adults, the case detection rate is usually fairly high because nearly all
infected individuals in these age groups develop
jaundice. A reasonable estimation of the annual
HAV incidence rate can be calculated from mandatory notifications of cases to public health authorities. When outbreaks occur and the incidence rate spikes, these situations often can be
detected soon after the first cases become symptomatic. Even outbreaks that spread through
childcare facilities usually can be detected, because caregivers who contract the virus from
asymptomatic infected children are likely to develop jaundice after the 15- to 50-day incubation period (Staes et al. 2000). However, the long
incubation period, averaging about 4 weeks,
means that it is often difficult for investigators
to identify the specific original source of HAV
outbreaks.
In middle-income countries in which incomes are rising, urbanization is occurring,
and nearly all members of the population (especially in urban areas) now have access to clean
water, the incidence of HAV is decreasing and
the median age at infection is rising. Significant
increases in the AMPI were observed between
1990 and 2005 in East Asia, Southeast Asia,
Eastern and Central Europe, Latin America,
and parts of the Middle East and North Africa
(Jacobsen and Wiersma 2010). Paradoxically, a
lower HAV incidence rate often initially causes
an increase in the number of hospitalizations
and deaths from hepatitis A in the population,
because older hepatitis A patients tend to be
much sicker than young children who become
infected. Mathematical models of HAV in uppermiddle-income countries, like Brazil, Mexico,
and Thailand, have found that a decrease from
an intermediate to a low overall incidence rate
may not have a significant impact on reducing
the rate of symptomatic disease for several deK.H. Jacobsen

cades, in the absence of vaccination, because the
proportion of symptomatic cases increases as
the overall incidence rate decreases (Van Effelterre et al. 2017a,b). However, these countries
are expected to eventually shift to the lowincidence, nonendemic profiles currently observed in high-income countries. This transition
has already occurred in many upper-middle-income countries.
RISK FACTORS FOR HAV
HAV incidence rates are decreasing in most
countries. Many high-income countries are
now nonendemic for HAV, many middle-income countries are shifting from intermediate
to low endemicity, and many low-income countries are shifting from very high to high or intermediate endemicity (Jacobsen and Koopman
2005). Several factors are influencing these
changes in HAV epidemiology.
One contributor is improved access to clean
drinking water sources and to sanitation and
hygiene facilities. The incidence of HAV decreases when everyone in a community has
access to a toilet and a handwashing facility,
especially food handlers, caregivers of young
children who are not yet toilet-trained, and others who are at elevated risk of playing a role in
the transmission of HAV within communities.
Meta-analysis has confirmed the association between higher rates of access to a safe drinking
water source and a lower HAV incidence rate
(Jacobsen and Koopman 2005). Hepatitis A
has an unusual risk profile because a lower incidence rate can raise the number of symptomatic
cases occurring in a population by postponing
the age at which the typical individual contracts
the virus. This characteristic of the disease
means that increased access to water and sanitation can initially increase the population burden from HAV (Mohd Hanafiah et al. 2011),
although the case numbers will decrease as continued infrastructure development further reduces the incidence rate.
Water and sanitation access do not adequately explain the differences in HAV endemicity
levels between countries with moderate or high
water-access rates. In these locations, economic
indicators such as the gross national income per
capita or the human development index (which
combines economic, education, and life expectancy data into one metric) appear to be better
predictors of HAV endemicity than water access
(Itani et al. 2014; Koroglu et al. 2017). This relationship between socioeconomic status and
HAV risk is also observed at the individual and
household levels, with higher incomes, higher
levels of education, smaller family sizes and less
crowding in the home, and other indicators of
higher socioeconomic status associated with a
reduced likelihood of exposure to HAV (Jacobsen and Koopman 2004). Thus, socioeconomic
development appears to be a factor in changing
HAV epidemiology trends in ways that extend
beyond environmental improvements.
Another set of factors relates to human demographics. One important driver of HAV epidemiology in middle-income countries appears
to be rural-to-urban migration (Van Effelterre
et al. 2017a). Rural areas tend to be poorer and
have less developed water and sanitation infrastructure, so they tend to have higher HAV incidence and prevalence rates (Jacobsen and
Koopman 2004). When a rural resident of a
middle-income country who is shedding HAV
as a result of acute infection travels to a city, that
infectious individual may infect many urban
residents who are susceptible to HAV, especially
if the rural resident is in the city to sell produce
or other food items.
A similar process may occur in higher-income countries as a result of refugee migration.
Child refugees originating in places with intermediate or high HAV endemicity who contract
HAV at the start of their journey or during their
travels may become contagious several weeks
later, after the family has relocated to a new
country. If the housing available to refugees is
substandard and residents do not have sufficient
access to hygiene facilities, one infected child
may spark an outbreak within the refugee community. Outbreaks have occurred recently in
several refugee camps in Europe that are hosting
people who have fled from the conflict in Syria,
including camps in Germany and Greece (Mellou et al. 2017; Michaelis et al. 2017). These
outbreaks have generally remained within the

refugee community, and vaccination strategies
have been successful at preventing spread to
other local populations (Mellou et al. 2017; Michaelis et al. 2017). However, it is possible for
migrants and other travelers to initiate chains of
local transmission of HAV in low-endemicity
countries.
An additional demographic process influencing HAV epidemiological patterns is population aging. In nations designated as “least developed countries,” young children who are not yet
toilet-trained account for up to 10% of the total
population; in high-income countries, this proportion is usually about 3% (UN DESA 2017). In
communities with a relatively large proportion
of young children in their populations, child-tochild transmission plays a key role in sustaining
endemic levels of hepatitis A. Countries with
older populations rarely have endemic HAV,
but they are vulnerable to outbreaks of hepatitis
A because a sizeable proportion of their residents remain susceptible to HAV.
Globalization may play a role in all of these
risk scenarios. In particular, economic globalization processes are enabling financial and infrastructural development in many parts of the
world and are driving increased rural-to-urban
and international migration and trade. For hepatitis A, international food trade and greater human mobility are critical components of the
epidemiological changes that are occurring
globally.
HAV AND INTERNATIONAL FOOD TRADE
In low-income countries, HAV is spread
through contaminated water, direct contact
with infectious individuals, and consumption
of contaminated foods. Because these transmission pathways all relate to water, sanitation, and
hygiene, it may be impossible to isolate the particular exposure responsible for causing a cluster
of hepatitis A cases. In high-income countries,
where safe drinking water is routinely available,
it is more feasible to identify the specific food
items that cause outbreaks. The two primary
food groups linked to outbreaks of hepatitis A
are produce and seafood (Greig and Ravel 2009),
including frozen berries, green onions, lettuce,
oysters, clams, and mussels (Acheson and Fiore
2004). The World Health Organization’s Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference
Group estimated that more than 90,000 people
worldwide died of hepatitis A disease in 2010
and that nearly 30,000 of those deaths could
be directly attributed to foodborne acquisition
of HAV (Kirk et al. 2015).
Although most foodborne outbreaks of hepatitis A are small, affecting only a few dozen or
several hundred people, these outbreaks can become widespread. In 1988, nearly 300,000 people in Shanghai contracted HAV by eating raw
clams, a popular delicacy that had been consumed by nearly one-third of the city’s residents
in the month before the outbreak began (Halliday et al. 1991). In 2003, more than 600 people
contracted HAV from a single restaurant in
Pennsylvania, in the United States, by eating
contaminated green onions that had been imported from Mexico (Wheeler et al. 2005).
International trade in foods is accelerating.
For example, in the United States, the proportion of consumed food that is imported from
other countries increased from 12% in 1990 to
20% in 2013; this proportion increased from
56% to 97% for fish and shellfish, from 31% to
49% for fruits and nuts, and from 4% to 20% for
vegetables (Jerardo 2016). The number of foodborne outbreaks in the United States rose steadily as the proportion of food that is imported
increased (Gould et al. 2017). Although not all
foodborne outbreaks of hepatitis A in high-income countries are caused by imported foods,
the risk of HAV contamination is elevated when
foods are procured from low- or middle-income
countries that are HAV-endemic.
Globalization is expected to increase the
number of foodborne outbreaks in high-income
countries, and there is already evidence of this
change occurring. For example, frozen berries
have caused numerous outbreaks of hepatitis
A in Europe. In one large outbreak that occurred
between January 2013 and August 2014, more
than 1100 people in Italy, Germany, Norway,
and 10 other European countries were hospitalized with hepatitis A disease. Some of the cases
were travelers to Italy, but most were people who
had not traveled outside of their home countries

in the months before they became ill. Molecular
characterization and trace-back investigations
linked the outbreak to Bulgarian blackberries
and Polish red currants that had been added to
mixed berry products (Severi et al. 2015). Bulgaria is classified as an upper-middle-income
country, unlike its high-income neighbors, and
the 86% rate of access to improved sanitation facilities in Bulgaria in 2015 was considerably lower than the 99% European average (UNICEF/
WHO 2015). The fruit products likely became
contaminated as a result of poor worker hygiene
or the spraying of produce with irrigation water
that contained raw sewage (Tavoschi et al. 2015).
At the same time that this large outbreak was
occurring, separate multicountry hepatitis A
outbreaks in other parts of Europe were linked
to strawberries imported from Egypt and Morocco (Gossner and Severi 2014). Foodborne outbreaks of HAV in other parts of the world have
also been reported with increasing frequency.
A multistate outbreak in the United States in
2013 was attributed to imported frozen pomegranate arils from Turkey, which is classified as
an upper middle-income country (Collier et al.
2014). Pomegranate seeds from Egypt were implicated in an HAV outbreak in Canada in 2012
(Swinkels et al. 2014). Hundreds of Australians
contracted HAV from imported sundried and
semidried tomatoes in 2009, and the same
strain also caused a tomato-borne outbreak in
the Netherlands in 2009–2010 (Donnan et al.
2012).
Preventing HAV cases caused by imported
foods requires improving food-processing practices in source countries. Globalization provides
opportunities to establish, strengthen, and enforce international food safety regulations and
to improve information sharing about hazards
(Käferstein et al. 1997). Strategies for reducing
the threat from foodborne infections usually require both exporting and importing countries to
be willing to invest resources in supporting enhanced food protections. Corporations involved
in international food production, manufacturing, and trade can also be incentivized to take
steps to better guarantee the quality and safety of
food products. Without improvements, many
residents of high- and middle-income countries
face an increasing risk of contracting HAV from
food products as global food trade accelerates.
HAV AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
Modern transportation networks and other developments stemming from the globalization of
human movement have enabled infectious diseases to spread more quickly across international borders (Gushulak and MacPherson 2000).
The number of international trips increased
from 25 million worldwide in 1950 to 278 million in 1980, 674 million in 2000, and 1186 million in 2015; this number is projected to reach
1.8 billion trips per year by 2030 (UNWTO
2016). These trips are distributed across the
globe. In 2015, about 51% of international destinations were European countries, 24% were in
the Asia-Pacific region, 16% were in the Americas, 5% were in Africa, and 5% were in the
Middle East (UNWTO 2016).
Hepatitis A is one of the vaccine-preventable
diseases that is most common among tourists
and other international travelers (Boggild et al.
2010). The majority of travel-associated hepatitis A cases occur when residents of high-income
countries (and some urban residents from middle-income countries) travel to places with higher levels of HAV endemicity. Unvaccinated travelers may contract the virus and then become ill
after they have returned to their home countries.
These imported viral infections may then be
transmitted within households, schools, workplaces, and other social networks, and those secondary cases may cause subsequent waves of
transmission. The accelerated rates of global
travel that are projected to occur in the coming
years could increase the number of travel-associated outbreaks in high-income and middleincome countries.
Hepatitis A vaccines can protect travelers
from nonendemic and low-endemicity countries who are likely to be exposed to HAV during
trips to HAV-endemic locations. An added benefit is that vaccinated travelers will not bring
HAV home and cause secondary cases in nontraveling contacts. Vaccination is typically recommended for high-risk populations from
high-income countries, including travelers to

higher endemicity areas as well as, in some
situations, immunocompromised individuals,
men who have sex with men, people who inject
drugs, and healthcare workers (ACIP 2006;
WHO 2012; Gossner et al. 2015). However,
too many travelers are unaware of the recommendations for hepatitis A vaccination or
choose to disregard advice from health professionals and other information sources. A study
of people from Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom who were traveling to HAV-endemic countries found that a large minority of travelers had
never been vaccinated against hepatitis A (Heywood et al. 2016). Hepatitis A vaccination rates
have also been found to be low among travelers
from Japan (Namikawa et al. 2010) and suboptimal among travelers from France, Italy, South
Korea, Spain, and the United States (Chin et al.
2016; Pedersini et al. 2016; Lammert et al. 2017).
Of the cases of hepatitis A in international
travelers reported between 2007 and 2011 to
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance network of
the International Society of Travel Medicine
(ISTM), which is operated in partnership with
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about half of the cases were
tourists engaging in leisure travel to India, Morocco, Egypt, Mexico, or other locations, about
10% were traveling for business, and about onethird were people visiting friends or relatives
(VFRs) in another country (Leder et al. 2013).
The VFR designation typically refers to foreignborn individuals and their children who return
to the migrants’ countries of origin to visit their
extended families (Barnett et al. 2010). The majority of people who resettle in a new country
move from a middle-income country to a highincome country (UN DESA 2016). Immigrants
from places with endemic HAV will have developed natural immunity to HAV as children following asymptomatic infection, and they may
not realize that their offspring who were born
and raised in nonendemic areas are vulnerable
to HAV and could become very ill from the virus. VFRs are significantly less likely than nonVFR travelers to be protected against HAV
through vaccination, and they are more likely
to report engaging in risky behaviors such as
drinking tap water and eating raw shellfish
(van Genderen et al. 2012). The risks of undervaccination of VFRs, especially children and adolescents, are apparent in travel health reports.
For example, more than half of hepatitis A cases
among returning international travelers living in
Quebec between 2004 and 2007 were VFRs, and
the majority of those cases were pediatric infections even though children accounted for only
about 10% of VFRs (Bui et al. 2011).
International tourism is a sizeable proportion of the global economy, generating more
than $1.2 trillion in spending each year
(UNWTO 2016). Nearly 40% of this spending
—about $500 billion—is expended in low- and
middle-income countries, and travel is an important part of the economic growth strategies
in many of these destinations. The proportion of
international travelers heading to a low- or middle-income country is expected to grow over the
coming decades (UNWTO 2016). As the proportion and number of travelers from higher-income countries who remain susceptible to HAV
increase, the number of international travelers
who contract HAV while abroad may increase.
HEPATITIS A PREDICTIONS FOR
A GLOBALIZING WORLD
A map showing the estimated AMPI for each
country worldwide in 2015 is presented in Figure 1. AMPI values derived from serological
studies are available for many countries in Europe (Carrillo-Santisteve et al. 2017) and the
Middle East (Koroglu et al. 2017) as well as for
Argentina (Yanez et al. 2014), Brazil (Ximenes
et al. 2014), China (Lu et al. 2009), Mexico (Lazcano-Ponce et al. 2013), South Korea (Lee et al.
2011), Thailand (Sa-nguanmoo et al. 2016), the
United States (Klevens et al. 2011), and several
other locations. For countries without recent
population-based surveys of hepatitis A seroprevalence rates by age, an estimated AMPI value was imputed based on the country’s human
development index and other socioeconomic
and environmental indicators. Limited data
availability means that there is uncertainty
about the assigned values for some countries,
especially in low- and middle-income areas.

However, regional trends are apparent. In many
low-income countries, HAV continues to be
highly endemic and most children contract the
virus before their fifth birthday. In many highincome countries, the HAV infection rate has
been so low for several decades that the AMPI
now exceeds 40 years of age. Middle-income
countries generally have an AMPI in middle
childhood or adolescence.
Most of the world’s lowest-income countries
are located in sub-Saharan Africa. Lower-middle-income countries are also scattered across
sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia,
and parts of Central America, Central Asia, the
Middle East, and Oceania (World Bank 2017).
Many of these low- and lower-middle-income
countries have high HAV incidence rates. Nearly
all adult residents of these countries became infected as very young children and developed lifelong immunity. However, the incidence rate is
decreasing in lower-middle-income regions and
may decrease in low-income areas during the
coming decades as the countries’ economies
and infrastructure develop. The Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) launched in 2000
spelled out a poverty-reduction strategy that
provided low-income countries and their partners with specific targets for improving population-level socioeconomic, environmental, and
health metrics. Between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of the world’s people living on less than
$1.25 per day dropped from 47% to 14%, while
access to an improved drinking water source
increased from 76% to 91% (United Nations
2015a). The Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) that will guide global development strategies between 2016 and 2030 promote further
reductions in poverty and increases in access to
water, sanitation, hygiene, vaccination, medication, clinical care, and other tools for health
(United Nations 2015b). The SDG targets for
water and sanitation may be especially important drivers of reduced HAV burden in lowerincome countries. Access to an improved sanitation facility only increased from 54% to 68%
between 1990 and 2015, and rural areas continue
to lag behind urban areas in both water and
sanitation access (United Nations 2015a).
Under the SDGs, access to utilities will increase
and disparities between regions are expected to
decrease.
As the HAV incidence rate decreases and a
larger pool of young children avoid exposure to
the virus, a growing number of children, adolescents, and young adults in lower-income countries will remain vulnerable to HAV into their
school years and beyond. This trend is already
being observed in some relatively wealthy urban

areas within lower-middle-income countries.
For example, a study of 3683 military recruits
from across India in 2010–2011 found that >7%
of these young adults remained susceptible to
HAV (Kotwal et al. 2014). There may also be
some small pockets of vulnerability to HAV
emerging in higher-income urban areas of lower-middle-income countries in West Africa
(Jacobsen 2014). This could indicate that an
HAV epidemiological transition is starting in
these regions. This shift toward a lower level of
endemicity will likely be gradual, in part because
HAV survives so well in water and soil (Sobsey
et al. 1986). As this transition occurs, the number of cases of symptomatic hepatitis A in these
countries is likely to increase.
At present, the lowest-income countries are
not major exporters of food, so they are playing a
limited role in trade-related HAV exportation.
As these countries’ economies grow, they may
become food exporters and play a greater role in
foodborne outbreaks of HAV in other world
regions. Low-income countries already receive
a sizeable number of international travelers, including tourists and heritage visitors as well as
business travelers, and the number of international guests will increase in the coming years. If
these travelers are not protected against HAV by
vaccination or prior infection, they are likely to
contract the virus and bring it home.
The world’s highest-income countries are
located primarily in Europe, North America,
and Australasia, and they are also found in parts
of the Middle East and East Asia, including Japan and the Republic of Korea (World Bank
2017). HAV is not endemic in these areas, and
because these countries have had very low incidence rates for several decades they have populations that are highly susceptible to hepatitis
A. The number and magnitude of outbreaks of
hepatitis A is likely to increase somewhat as a
result of globalization processes. Travel vaccines
prevent hepatitis A cases in international travelers and limit the number of secondary cases that
could occur among the contacts of infected travelers. However, most hepatitis A cases in highincome countries occur among people who have
not traveled internationally in the months before the onset of symptoms (Gossner et al. 2015;
CDC 2017). Few adults who live in high-income
countries have been vaccinated against HAV,
and a large proportion of older adults remain
susceptible to HAV (Jacobsen and Wiersma
2010). Outbreaks from imported foods can affect hundreds or thousands of people, and infected adults may miss many weeks of work and
require costly hospitalizations. Large, expensive
multicountry outbreaks of hepatitis A attributable to imported foods are occurring more frequently than they did in previous decades
(Gossner et al. 2015; Tavoschi et al. 2015). If
hepatitis A outbreaks become more common,
it may be helpful for economists to examine
the potential value of hepatitis A vaccination
for protecting members of the workforce in
high-income countries from the lengthy absences that could be caused by severe acute
hepatitis.
The world’s middle-income countries are
located in Central and South America, East
Asia, and parts of North Africa, the Middle
East, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Southern Africa, and Eastern Europe (World Bank 2017).
Middle-income countries have diverse patterns
for HAV, with even small differences in economic status linked to different HAV profiles.
The AMPI is shifting into adolescence and early
adulthood in many countries, but there are often
significant rural–urban and other differences
within subpopulations (Van Effelterre et al.
2017a,b). For example, there is an east-to-west
gradient of decreasing levels of HAV endemicity
in Turkey (Demiray et al. 2016) and a north-tosouth gradient of lowering risk in Brazil (Ximenes et al. 2014). Geographic differences in
risk have also been observed in other uppermiddle-income countries.
Middle-income countries are the places
where universal childhood vaccination is most
likely to be recommended, because there is still
a moderate risk of infectionfor residents through
contaminated food, water treatment system failures, intracountry travel to rural areas, and other
exposures, and the increasing AMPI means that
many of the people who contract HAV are old
enough to be at risk of acute liver failure. In upper-middle-income countries, universal childhood vaccination against hepatitis A is often

found to be a cost-effective public health intervention (Suwantika et al. 2013), in addition to
protecting vaccinated children and the adults in
their families from the direct and indirect household costs associated with infection. For example, cost-effectiveness analyses have suggested
that universal childhood vaccination would be
a good investment in countries as diverse as Brazil (Sartori et al. 2012), Indonesia (Suwantika
et al. 2014), and Mexico (Carlos et al. 2016).
Routine childhood vaccination against hepatitis
A has already been introduced in several middleincome countries (WHO 2017).
Middle-income countries play an important
role in the global epidemiology of HAV, and they
are likely to continue to play a key role in global transmission cycles. Many middle-income
countries are food exporters, and they are implicated in a growing number of foodborne outbreaks in higher-income countries. They also
are a common destination for international travelers, and the number of flights between highincome and middle-income countries is increasing. As middle-income countries’ economies
grow, they are likely to switch from being countries that are distributing HAV to other world
regions to being nonendemic countries that are
vulnerable to HAV outbreaks sparked by international trade and travel originating in lowerincome regions.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Pandemics of infectious diseases began occurring soon after global trade routes opened in the
16th century. By the early 1800s, widespread
cholera outbreaks were occurring in waves
(Lee and Dodgson 2000). Starting in 1851, a
series of International Sanitary Conferences
were convened to establish infectious disease
prevention regulations that would protect public
health while allowing international trade to continue (Huber 2006). The resulting International
Sanitary Regulations formed the foundation for
the International Health Regulations that guide
global communication about shared threats to
health today. Global trade is even more critical
for the economic security of countries around
the world today than it was when the original
international health treaties were negotiated.
Even when countries adopt nationalist policies
that seek to limit some aspects of international
commerce and migration, it would be impossible and unwise to attempt to block all food imports and stop all international travel (including travel by diplomats and other government
officials, military personnel, and other people
whose work is critical to national interests). In
a globalized world, pathogens easily spread between places and populations. No country will
be able to completely eliminate its risk from
hepatitis A while HAV remains endemic in
any part of the world.
Although the trends in hepatitis A epidemiology point to a steadily decreasing incidence
rate at the global level, the distribution of risk
is not uniform. The lowest-income countries
have a high incidence rate but a low disease burden. The highest-income countries have a very
low incidence rate, but the individuals who become infected have a high likelihood of requiring hospitalization and a risk of death from
acute liver failure. Middle-income countries
that are transitioning toward nonendemic status
may temporarily experience an increased burden from severe hepatitis as the age at infection
increases. The epidemiological changes in hepatitis A that occur in countries across the income
spectrum in the coming decades will be heavily
influenced by globalization processes.
