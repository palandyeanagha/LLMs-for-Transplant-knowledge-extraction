Abstract
Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)-10 promotes the proliferation and survival of murine hepatoblasts during early stages of
hepatogenesis through a Wnt-b-catenin dependent pathway. To determine the mechanism by which this occurs, we
expanded primary culture of hepatoblasts enriched for progenitor markers CD133 and CD49f from embryonic day (E) 12.5
fetal liver and an established tumor initiating stem cell line from Mat1a2/2 livers in media conditioned with recombinant (r)
FGF10 or rFGF7. FGF Receptor (R) activation resulted in the downstream activation of MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and b-catenin
pathways, as well as cellular proliferation. Additionally, increased levels of nuclear b-catenin phosphorylated at Serine-552 in
cultured primary hepatoblasts, Mat1a2/2 cells, and also in ex vivo embryonic liver explants indicate AKT-dependent
activation of b-catenin downstream of FGFR activation; conversely, the addition of AKT inhibitor Ly294002 completely
abrogated b-catenin activation. FGFR activation-induced cell proliferation and survival were also inhibited by the compound
ICG-001, a small molecule inhibitor of b-catenin-CREB Binding Protein (CBP) in hepatoblasts, further indicating a CBPdependent regulatory mechanism of b-catenin activity.
Conclusion: FGF signaling regulates the proliferation and survival of embryonic and transformed progenitor cells in part
through AKT-mediated activation of b-catenin and downstream interaction with the transcriptional co-activator CBP.

Introduction
Despite progress in characterizing the physiology of hepatic
progenitor/stem cells, numerous aspects of signaling pathways
regulating these progenitor/stem cells remain undefined. During
embryogenesis, hepatic bud formation is induced from the foregut
endoderm via instructive Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)
signaling from adjacent mesenchyme of the developing heart
and septum transversum [1–3]. At different stages of fetal and
postnatal life, the population of progenitor cells, termed hepatoblasts, which likely represent a heterogeneous mixture of precursor
cells, variably express genes specific to hepatocytes (Albumin,
Hnf4a), biliary epithelial cells (Cytokeratin-19) and putative stem/
progenitor cell markers (Epcam, Cd133 and Cd49f) [4–9]. Under
circumstances where liver regeneration via hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, there is evidence of FGF signaling activation
promoting the proliferation of epithelial progenitor cells in
response to liver injury [10]. Further elucidation of these pathways
could provide insight not only into repair mechanisms involving
progenitor cells, but also into the biology of liver tumors such as
hepatoblastoma, which are theorized to arise from clonal
expansion of malignantly transformed progenitor/stem cells
[11,12].
The Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family comprises 22
known ligands, which bind promiscuously and with variable
specificity to four tyrosine kinase-type FGF Receptors (R), encoded
by genes with multiple alternative splicing loci [13,14]. Notably
FGF7 and FGF10, two key ligands involved in epithelial
organogenesis and repair, exhibit greatest affinity for the
FGFR2IIIb isoform over other FGFR [15,16]. FGFR activation
is known to regulate the downstream mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and phospho-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50401

[13,14]. Calmont et al demonstrated that during the initial stages of
hepatogenesis, the FGF-mediated MAPK pathway regulates
endodermal cell specification with induction of hepatic genes,
such as Albumin, whereas PI3K pathway activation promotes liver
growth during early embryonic liver development [17].
The b-catenin pathway is an evolutionarily well-conserved
signaling pathway essential to normal cellular processes such as
proliferation, survival, and differentiation; it is also involved in selfrenewal of progenitor cell populations during embryogenesis,
tissue regeneration and repair [18–23]. The canonical pathway
involves binding of the Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) ligand to the
Frizzled receptor. Via a series of intermediate steps, b-catenin is
activated and released from the Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3b
(GSK3b)/Axin/Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) complex prior
to entry into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, b-catenin binds to
TCF/LEF transcription factors and regulates expression of various
downstream genes. Direct phosphorylation of b-catenin at Serine552 by AKT leads to expression of a series of anti-apoptotic and
cell survival genes [24,25].
b-catenin activity is also regulated through interaction with two
nuclear transcriptional co-activators: Cyclic AMP responsive
element binding protein (CBP) and its highly related paralog
p300. Both CBP and p300 are transcriptional co-activator proteins
that can acetylate histones and non-histone proteins such as bcatenin [26–29]. Both proteins regulate gene transcription through
protein-protein interactions with transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling complexes [30]. b-catenin interacts with CBP to
promote survival and proliferation of embryonic and somatic stem
cells, whereas its interaction with p300 promotes the initiation of
differentiation of stem cells [31,32]. CBP is also required for selfrenewal of hematopoietic stem cells, while p300 regulates
hematopoietic differentiation [33,34]. Additionally, TCF/b-catenin/CBP-mediated transcription decreases the rate of neuronal
progenitor cell differentiation, whereas b-catenin interaction with
p300 induces differentiation [35].
During early hepatogenesis around E10.5, Fgf10 is expressed by
mesenchymal cells within the adjacent septum transversum and
thereafter, by fetal hepatic stellate cells. FGF10 induces downstream activation of b-catenin in hepatoblasts likely through
FGFR2IIIb activation [36]. However, the mechanism by which
FGFR2IIIb activates b-catenin and regulates the survival of
hepatic progenitor/stem cells is not clear.
In the present study, we utilize in vitro culture techniques of
whole mount embryonic liver, primary hepatoblasts and tumor
initiating liver stem cells to characterize in greater detail the link
between FGFR signaling, b-catenin activation, and progenitor cell
proliferation.
Materials and Methods
Animal Use
C57BL6 wild-type (Jackson laboratories, Harbor, ME) mice
were bred, maintained at The Saban Research Institute (TSRI)
animal care facility, and handled in accordance with IACUC rules
and regulations of the TSRI at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
Cell Culture
The Mat1a2/2 cell line, originally described by Rountree et al
[37], was grown on standard tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences)
in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS,
Invitrogen), 100 units/100 mg/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA), 1 mg/ml Insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
1027 M Dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich) 6 250 ng/ml Fungizone (Gibco, added
only for primary culture) in a cell culture incubator maintained at
37uC and 5% CO2. Cells were trypsinized using 0.05% TrypsinEDTA (Gibco, Carlsbard, CA) and passaged every 3–4 days.
For serum starvation, cells were washed with sterile phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) twice and media was changed to DMEM
containing Dexamethasone and Nicotinamide minus serum or
insulin for 16 hours. FGF signaling was stimulated as described
previously by growing cells in human rFGF7 or rFGF10 (R &D
Systems) conditioned media at 250 ng/ml for 1 hour unless
otherwise described [36]. For loss-of-function analyses, we utilized
ICG-001, a small molecule inhibitor that specifically disrupts bcatenin’s interaction with CBP [38] and Ly294002, a PI3K-AKT
inhibitor, at the well-established dose of 10 mM concentration for
the indicated time in each experiment.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Embryonic livers were isolated from E12.5 C57BL6 wild-type
mouse embryos, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Poly
Sciences Inc., Warrington, PA) and embedded in paraffin blocks.
5 mm thick sections were used for immunofluorescence staining.
De-paraffinized and antigen-retrieved tissue sections were incubated with respective primary antibodies for 16 hours at 4uC after
blocking with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 10 minutes.
For detection, we used secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3,
Cy5, or FITC incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For
immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes
and washed in PBS for 5 minutes twice. The cells were
permeabilized with Tris-buffered saline-Triton X-100 (0.5%) for
10 minutes and then washed in PBS for 5 minutes twice. Nonspecific binding was reduced by blocking with 5% goat serum
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 minutes at room temperature. The cells
were then incubated with primary antibody for 16 hours at 4uC
(see Table S1). Signals were detected by adding secondary
antibody conjugated either with goat-anti-mouse Cy3/Cy5/FITC,
goat anti-rat Cy3, or goat anti-rabbit Cy3/Cy5 (1:200, Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Fluorescence
images were acquired using Leica DM5500B immunofluorescence
microscope using Leica Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF)
6000 software (Wetzlar, Germany). Phase contrast pictures were
acquired using Evos Advanced Microscopy Group (AMG)
transmitted light microscope coupled with Evos xl software
(AMG, Bothell, Washington, USA).
Isolation of Embryonic Hepatoblasts
Embryonic liver progenitor cells were isolated from E12.5
embryos of C57BL6 mice. Isolated livers were digested with
0.03% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM at 37uC for 30
minutes after which enzymatic activity was stopped using 10%
FBS. Digested liver cell suspensions were then passed through
70 mm sterile filters (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to obtain
single cell suspensions. Cells were spun down at 5006g for 5
minutes at 4uC. Cell depletion or selection was performed using
the Milteni immuno-magnetic beads (Milteni Biotech Inc.,
Auburn, CA) conjugated with respective antibodies according to
the manufacture’s protocol and protocols published previously
[37]. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold 16Magnetic Assisted
Cell Separation (MACS) buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA,
10 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM EDTA). CD45pos (positive) cells were
depleted and CD133pos or CD49fpos cells were selected according
to manufacturer protocol.
Cell viability was assessed by 0.4% Trypan blue (Gibco)
staining. Approximately 16105 or 2.56105 viable cells were
plated on Laminin-Poly-lysine coated culture slides or 3.5 cm
Laminin coated culture plates (BD Biosciences). Media was

changed the following day and every other day thereafter as
described above. All studies on primary cultured embryonic
hepatoblasts were carried out between 3–6 days after plating.
Purification of RNA and Gene Expression Analysis
26105 cells were plated on 6-cm tissue culture plates. Cells were
serum starved the following day for 16 hours in 0% FBS 6
rFGF7/10 conditioned media. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA purity was assessed by the 260/280 and 260/
230 nm absorbance ratio of 2 or greater. 1 mg of total RNA was
used for cDNA synthesis using the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA
synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Life Science, Hercules, CA). Analysis of
gene expression via Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RTPCR) was performed on Bio-Rad C1000 Thermal
cycler using Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and intron spanning gene specific primers (Table S2). Quantitative
Real-Time PCR (qPCR) was performed using cDNA using LightCycler Taqman Master (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
and probes from the Universal Probe Library (Roche Applied
Science) using intron spanning, gene specific primers. Relative
expression levels were calculated by D–D Ct method. Actin was
used to normalize the gene expression.
Cell Proliferation and BrdU Labeling Assay
36104 Mat1a2/2 cells were plated on an eight well culture slide
(BD Biosciences) and next day serum starved for 16 hours. Cells
were then treated with rFGF7/10 (0–250 ng/mL culture media)
for 48 hours, and total cell number was counted using a
hemocytometer. For BrdU (5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine) incorporation, 24 hours after plating, cells were serum starved for 16 hours
6 CBP inhibitor, ICG-001, or PI3K-AKT inhibitor, Ly294002,
and treated with rFGF7/10 and BrdU for 3 hours. In the case of
embryonic HPC, 16105 MACS-sorted CD133posCD49fpos
CD45neg (negative) cells were cultured for 3 days in eight-well
Laminin-poly-lysine coated culture slides. Cells were then serum
starved (0.5% serum, no insulin) for 6 hours in 6 ICG-001 and
treated with rFGF10/7 and BrdU for 3 hours. The cells were fixed
in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature, 2 N HCl for 30
minutes, and then washed twice in PBS. Cells were blocked with
5% goat serum for 45 minutes at room temperature and incubated
with anti-BrdU antibody for 16 hours at 4uC. The signals were
detected with Cy3 conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody.
BrdU positive cells were counted in 4–5 206 high power field
images using NIH Image J software and compared with control.
Western Blot Analysis
26105 Mat1a2/2 cells were plated on 6-cm tissue culture plate
and serum starved for 16 hours. FGF signaling was activated as
described above. Total protein lysates were prepared from cells
using Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
Sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Phenyl methyl
sulphonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), Phosphatase inhibitor (PhosStop, Roche Applied Science), and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclear proteins were isolated using NE-PER
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Scientific).
Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford’s protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using BSA as standard. Equal amounts
of protein were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE at 100 V and
transferred onto 0.4 m thick nitrocellulose membrane for 1.5 hours
at 200 mA. After blocking with 5% BSA or BLOTTO (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) prepared in Tris-buffered saline, Tween,
0.1%, (TBST) membranes were incubated with respective primary
antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 16 hours at 4uC.
Membranes were then washed in TBST for 10 minutes twice
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody. Primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in
Table S1. The signals were detected using HyGLO Quick spray
western blot detection reagent (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen,
NJ). The band intensity was measured by Quantity One gel
analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Liver Explant Culture
Embryonic livers from E12.5 embryos were collected, washed in
DMEM and cultured on Whatman Nucleopore Track-Etch
membranes (8 mm, Whatman Inc. Florham Park, NJ) for 3 days
in a cell culture incubator at 37uC 6 rFGF10 and 6 ICG-001.
Cultured livers were fixed in 4% PFA and paraffin blocks were
prepared. 5 mm sections were stained for anti-phospho-Serine-552
b-CATENIN as described earlier.
Statistical Analysis
ANOVA-Post hoc Fisher’s PLSD test was performed using
Statview software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to calculate
statistical significance. p,0.05 was considered as significant.
Results
FGF Signaling in E12.5 Murine Hepatoblasts
We previously showed that E12.5 murine hepatoblasts, which
exhibit FGF10-dependent b-catenin, also co-express Albumin,
Cytokeratin-19, and Fgfr2IIIb [36]. Herein, we first sought to
characterize histologically the hepatoblasts in E12.5 livers.
Previous studies have demonstrated that hepatic progenitor cells
express a variety of cell surface markers such as CD133 (also
known as Prominin) and CD49f (also known as Integrin alpha-6)
[4–9]. We observed co-expression of CD133 and CD49f
(Figure 1A) as well as co-expression of CD133 and CK19
(Figure 1B). We calculated that approximate 35% of cells were
CD133posCD49fpos. Similarly, 35% of cells were CD133posCK19- pos. We, therefore, extrapolated that approximately 35% of total
liver cells are CD133posCD49fposCD19pos. Notably, subsets of
CD133posCD49fpos cells also co-expressed FGFR1 or FGFR2
(Figure 1C, 1D).
To further evaluate the progenitor nature of embryonic
CD133pos CD49fposcells, we enriched for these cells using
Magnetic Assisted Cell Separation (MACS) methodology. We
first depleted CD45pos cells to remove hematopoietic cells from the
suspension of total liver cells given that the embryonic liver is a
major site for extra-medullary hematopoiesis during embryogenesis; CD45 depletion consistently resulted approximately in a 50%
reduction in total liver cells. We then positively selected the
remaining CD45 depleted cells for CD133 and CD49f. The final
cell suspensions were then plated onto Laminin-coated culture
dishes, where the cells grew in monolayered colonies of small
epithelioid-type cells. Beyond one week, however, many cells
began to lose their oval shape and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
ratio as well as their colony forming nature while becoming more
fibroblast-like morphologically (Figure 2A). RTPCR analysis of the
three-day cultured cells demonstrated expression of putative stem
cell markers Cd133, Cd49f, Sca-1, a-fetoprotein as well as coexpression of hepatocyte genes Albumin and Hepatocyte nuclear factor4a (Hnf4a), biliary epithelial gene Ck19, and a number of Fgf
receptors, particularly Fgfr1IIIb and Fgfr2IIIb, which are generally
expressed by epithelial cells (Figure 2B). Fgfr4, which encodes a
hepatocyte-specific receptor, was also expressed. Immunofluorescence-based co-localization of HNF4a and CK19 as well as panMechanism of Hepatic Progenitor Cell Survival

CYTOKERATIN (PCK) and ALBUMIN is consistent with
bipotentiality of expanded MACS-enriched cells after 6 days in
culture (Figure 2C, 2D). Cd45 expression was present at day zero
indicating some contamination of the plated cell population;
however, Cd45 was undetectable three days later possible due to
attrition of hematopoietic cells. At both zero and three days of
culture, we noted expression of Fgfr1IIIc and Fgfr2IIIc, which are
generally expressed by mesenchymally-derived cells. However,
even by six days of culture, there was no detectable expression of
mesenchymal marker DESMIN (Figure S1). All experiments with
primary putative hepatoblast culture were, hereafter, completed
within 6 days of plating in order to maximize epithelial progenitor
cell phenotype and minimize potential epithelial mesenchymal
transition.
We then proceeded with the assumption that our primary
embryonic liver cultures were sufficiently enriched with hepatoblasts for the purposes of this study. We further speculated that
these epithelially derived cells likely express Fgfr1IIIb and
Fgfr2IIIb, and, therefore, would proliferate in response to FGF7
or FGF10. We sought to determine the effect of dose escalation of
rFGF7 and rFGF10 on primary hepatoblasts in vitro. We observed
significant increases in proliferation index up to five-fold and sixfold with increasing concentrations of rFGF7 and rFGF10,
respectively, from 0 to 250 ng/mL (Figure 2E, p,0.001). There
was no evidence of inhibition across all doses with higher
concentrations.
FGF Signaling Activates Downstream AKT and ERK
Pathways and Promotes Cellular Proliferation in Mat1a2/
2 Tumor Initiating Cells
Given concerns of potential plasticity of our primary hepatoblasts in culture, we also chose to study FGF signaling activation in
an established and relatively stable tumor initiating stem cell line
derived from the livers of Mat1a2/2 mice in order to elucidate
differences and commonalities between the two cell culture
models. Rountree et al., previously expanded clones of single
CD133-expressing non-parenchymal cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from Mat1a2/2 livers. The
authors showed that these cells express Ck19, Albumin, Hnf4a, and
a-Fetoprotein in a manner consistent with bi-potential progenitor
cells. Furthermore, these cells could be passaged multiple times in
vitro and transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice where they
developed into small tumors of clonally expanded hepatic
epithelial stem cells [37]. To maintain our Mat1a2/2 cells as
phenotypically as a tumor initiating epithelial stem cell line, we
further enriched for CD133 and CD49f by MACS. By immunofluorescence staining, we then demonstrated co-expression of
ALBUMIN and pan-CYTOKERATIN (PCK), consistent with
the previously established bipotential nature of these cells
(Figure 3A). There was no observable expression of DESMIN
(Figure S1C). Plated Mat1a2/2 cells exhibited cuboidal, epitheliallike morphology in colonies. RTPCR gene expression analysis of
Mat1a2/2 cells revealed co-expression of hepatocyte specific genes
(Albumin and Hnf4a), biliary specific gene (Cytokeratin-19), and stem

cell/progenitor cell genes (Sca-1, Cd133, Cd49f, a-Fetoprotein). Cd45
and Fgfr4 were not detectable. Mat1a2/2 cells expressed IIIb and
IIIc isoforms of Fgfr1, Fgfr2, and Fgfr3, indicating potentially some
degree of epithelial mesenchymal transition at the gene expression
level (Figure 3B).
We then treated these cells with rFGF7 or rFGF10. In both
cases by qPCR, we observed a greater than 2-fold increase in
Fgfr2IIIb mRNA level after 30 minutes of stimulation (Figure 3C,
n = 3, p,0.01). Stimulation with rFGF7 increased the phosphorylation of FGFR, which recognizes all FGFR (120–130 kDa)

phosphorylated at Tyrosine 653/564 (Figure 3C). Given that both
FGF7 and FGF10 have much greater affinity for FGFR2IIIb than
any other FGFR including FGFR1IIIb [15,16], it is likely that the
observed phosphorylation and, therefore, activation is predominantly that of FGFR2IIIb. While total FGFR cannot be
determined, there was no appreciable increase in either FGFR1
or FGFR2 even though there was evidence of increased Fgfr2IIIb
expression. Downstream of FGFR activation by rFGF7, we
observed phosphorylation/activation of AKT (Serine 473) and
ERK1/2 (Tyrosine 204), two known downstream targets of
activated FGFR signaling, as well as b-CATENIN (Serine 552,
Figure 3D). Moreover, treatment with either rFGF for 48 hours
resulted in a significant 2- to 2.5-fold increase in proliferation of
Mat1a2/2 HPCs in culture (Figure 3E, p,0.001 and p,0.05).
FGF Signaling Induces AKT-dependent b-catenin
Activation in Both Mat1a2/2 Cells and Embryonic
Hepatoblasts
FGF10 signaling induces downstream b-catenin activation
leading to proliferation and enhanced survival of hepatoblasts
during hepatogenesis [36]. Given the role of PI3K signaling in
liver bud growth, [17] we sought to determine if PI3K activation
might play a role in the activation of b-catenin in hepatoblasts and
Mat1a2/2 cells downstream of FGFR activation. Accordingly, we
analyzed CD133posCD49fpos enriched hepatoblasts derived from
E12.5 liver and Mat1a2/2 cells histologically for nuclear bCATENIN phosphorylated at Serine 552 (pSer-552), the site of
AKT-dependent phosphorylation and transcriptional activation
[24]. In both cases, media supplementation with either rFGF7 or
rFGF10 resulted in 3- to 6-fold increases in the number of cells
positive for nuclear pSer-552 b-CATENIN (Figure 4A–D,
p,0.001, n = 3). Similarly, western blot analysis of the nuclear

extracts from Mat1a2/2 cells stimulated with rFGF10 demonstrated a ,3-fold increase in pSer552-b-CATENIN (Figure 4E–F).
The increase in pSer-552 b-CATENIN was not associated with an
increase in total b-CATENIN (Figure 3D). Co-treatment of
Mat1a2/2 cells with rFGF7/10 and AKT inhibitor LY294002
resulted in complete abrogation of pSer-552 b-CATENIN upregulation as well as BrdU incorporation (Figure 5A–B, p,0.001).
In vivo immuno-histologic analysis of E12.5 livers showed that
the majority of the pSer-552 b-CATENIN expressing cells are copositive for PCNA, CD133, CD49f and E-CADHERIN but not
DESMIN (Figure 6A–C and Figure S2B–C). Notably, however,
not all proliferating cells are pSer-552 b-CATENIN positive
indicating that other pathways are involved in parallel to promote
proliferation. AKT-dependent activation of b-catenin is also
observed in the proliferating cells at later stages (E18.5) of
embryonic liver development (Figure S2A). Similarly, ex vivo E12.5
liver explants cultured in the presence of rFGF10 demonstrated
increased levels of pSer-552 b-CATENIN and proliferation
(Figure 6Di–ii). These observations indicate that FGF signaling
promote proliferation of hepatoblasts partly through AKTdepended b-catenin activation.
FGFR Activation Promotes b-catenin-dependent Cell
Cycle Progression of Embryonic Hepatoblasts and
Mat1a2/2 Cells through a CBP Dependent Pathway
To determine the role of the co-activator CBP in FGFRmediated activation of b-catenin on cell cycle progression, BrdU
incorporation assays were performed on CD133posCD49fpos
enriched embryonic hepatoblasts and Mat1a2/2 cells. FGFR
activation by rFGF7 or rFGF10 for 3 hours resulted in nearly 3-
fold increase in BrdU positive cells in both cell types (Figure 7A–D,
n = 4, p,0.001). Co-treatment with ICG-001, an inhibitor of the
CBP/catenin interaction [38], completely abrogated BrdU incorporation and, hence, initiation of cell proliferation induced by
FGFR. FGFR activation by rFGF10 resulted in a 50% increase in
the expression of Survivin, a downstream anti-apoptotic gene target
of CBP-b-catenin co-activation [39], whereas ICG-001 cotreatment nearly completely blocked this effect (Figure 7E, p,
0.005 and p,0.05, respectively). We, therefore, conclude that
FGFR-mediated activation of b-catenin-CBP pathway promotes
the survival and proliferation of hepatoblasts and Mat1a2/2 tumor
initiating stem cells at least in part via an anti-apoptotic
mechanism.

Discussion
FGF signaling is required for normal hepatogenesis [1–3].
FGF1, FGF2, and FGF8, which are secreted by adjacent cardiac
mesenchyme, induce liver bud formation from the foregut
endoderm. Previous studies have shown that initiation of liver
bud growth is dependent on AKT pathway activation [17]. We
previously reported that FGF10, secreted by embryonic hepatic
stellate cells, promotes the proliferation and survival of hepatoblasts via activation of b-catenin pathway after the initial liver bud
formation [36]. In this study, we demonstrate that FGF7 and
FGF10, likely through FGFR2IIIb, induce downstream b-catenin
activation and its nuclear translocation in both post-liver bud
embryonic hepatoblasts and Mat1a2/2 tumor initiating stem cell
line via AKT-dependent phosphorylation of Serine-552. We also
show that FGF-induced proliferation of these hepatic progenitor/
stem cells is mediated in part through the interaction of b-catenin
with its co-activator CBP.
b-catenin activation is critical for normal hepatogenesis. Levels
of both nuclear as well as total b-catenin increase during early liver
development [19,40]. We previously showed evidence that
FGF10, secreted by embryonic hepatic stellate cells of the septum
transversum, induces proliferation of hepatoblasts via b-catenin
activation greatest around E12.5 [36]. In the current study, we
show that FGF-dependent proliferation is mediated in part via
AKT-dependent b-catenin activation in both hepatoblasts as well
as in Mat1a2/–derived tumor initiating liver stem cells similar to
that seen during liver bud formation [17]. He et al demonstrated
that AKT-dependent activation of b-catenin promotes selfrenewal of intestinal stem/progenitor cells [41]. Volckaert et al
showed that FGF10 directly activates AKT and subsequently bcatenin via its phosphorylation at Ser-552 in lung progenitor cells
to promote self-maintenance [42]. While our data do not exclude
the role of Wnt-dependent canonical stabilization of b-catenin in
progenitor cells through GSK-3b/Axin/APC complex, AKTmediated FGF-dependent activation of b-catenin clearly contributes to hepatic progenitor/stem cell self-maintenance and renewal
beyond the initial stages of hepatogenesis.
CBP/b-catenin interaction appears to be critical for the selfrenewal of a variety of tissue stem cells, making this complex an
intriguing therapeutic target for clinical disease. Emami et al
previously showed that ICG-001 selectively binds the N-terminus
of CBP, without binding to the highly homologous co-activator
p300, leading to inhibition of proliferation and induction of
apoptosis of a colon carcinoma cell line in part via decreased
expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin, an anti-apoptotic gene [38].
Teo et al showed that ICG-001 corrects defects in neuronal
differentiation associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease-associated Presenilin-1 mutations [35]. Henderson et al showed that
administration of ICG-001 prevents and can reverse bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis, in part via maintenance of the
alveolar epithelium [43]. In this study, we show that disruption of
the CBP-b-catenin interaction by ICG-001 at a previously
established, cytostatic dose inhibits FGF-induced proliferation of
embryonic hepatoblasts as well as Mat1a2/2 cells. It is conceivable
that FGF-induced b-catenin activation may regulate epithelial
progenitors during fibrogenic liver injury.
b-catenin pathway activation is critical for normal hepatogenesis. b-catenin pathway activation is also present in numerous
cancers including hepatoblastoma [11,18,44,45]. Transcriptional
interaction of b-catenin with its co-activators CBP and p300 must

be tightly regulated during liver development to control the
balance between proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. Future studies will need to address the potential role that
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser552 plays in
modulating CBP binding affinity. Taurin et al demonstrated in
Cos7 cells that phosphorylation of Ser675, within the C-terminal

region of b-catenin (amino acids 647–781) to which both CBP and
p300 bind, promotes its interaction with CBP and enhances the
proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [38,46,47]; the
authors did not examine the effects on the p300/b-catenin
interaction. Our findings demonstrate that b-catenin Ser552
phosphorylation regulates the proliferation and survival of
hepatoblasts and liver tumor initiating stem cells in a CBPdependent manner. Multiple kinase cascades can be integrated
into the modulation of b-catenin co-activator interactions to
control the critical decision between maintenance of potency and
initiation of differentiation [46]. It is likely that the interaction of
CBP-b-catenin versus p300-b-catenin is regulated via phosphorylation of multiple residues both within the co-activators and bcatenin thereby differentially regulating stem/progenitors versus
differentiated cells. Since the interaction of b-catenin with CBP
promotes proliferation and maintenance of potency, while its
interaction with p300 promotes the initiation of differentiation of
embryonic and cancer stem cells [31,48], b-catenin may bind
predominantly to CBP during early hepatogenesis to promote the
proliferation of hepatoblasts, while during the later stages of
hepatogenesis, it may preferentially partner with p300 to regulate
hepatocyte or biliary differentiation of hepatoblasts.
In conclusion, we show that FGF pathway-induced proliferation
of embryonic hepatoblasts and Mat1a2/2 liver cancer stem cells is
in part dependent on AKT-mediated b-catenin activation and
subsequent CBP/b-catenin driven transcription. Our observation
that embryonic hepatoblasts and Mat1a2/2 cells appear to be
regulated in a similar fashion suggests that the FGF-AKT- bcatenin/CBP pathway is mechanistically important and likely may
be conserved in other conditions of liver injury or malignancy.
Precise detailing of these pathways could lead to a better
understanding of the role of transcriptional co-activator regulation
of b-catenin activity and also facilitate the development of future
therapeutics either in the realm of stem/progenitor cell-based
therapies for liver diseases or chemotherapy for hepatic malignancies.
