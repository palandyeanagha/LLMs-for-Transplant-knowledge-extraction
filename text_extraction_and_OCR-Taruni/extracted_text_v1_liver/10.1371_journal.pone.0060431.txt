Abstract
Introduction: Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Prognostic factors
are largely derived from trials conducted prior to the modern era of antifungal and potent combination antiretroviral
therapies, immunosuppression, and transplantation. Data describing the clinical features and predictors of mortality in a
modern cohort are needed.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients at our institution diagnosed with cryptococcosis from
1996 through 2010. Data included demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes.
Results: We identified 302 individuals: 108 (36%) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, 84 (28%) organ transplant
recipients (OTRs), and 110 (36%) non-HIV, non-transplant (NHNT) patients including 39 with no identifiable
immunodeficiency. Mean age was 49 years, 203 (67%) were male and 170 (56%) were white. All-cause mortality at 90
days was 21%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, cryptococcemia (OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.54–10.22) and baseline
opening pressure .25 cmH2O (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.25–6.88) were associated with increased odds of mortality; HIV-positive
patients (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19–1.16) and OTRs (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.05) had lower odds of death compared to NHNT
patients.
Conclusions: Predictors of mortality from cryptococcosis in the modern period include cryptococcemia, high intracranial
pressure, and NHNT status while drug(s) used for induction and historical prognostic factors including organ failure
syndromes and hematologic malignancy were not associated with mortality.

Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic fungal infection
causing considerable morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients including individuals positive for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), organ transplant recipients
(OTRs), and other immunocompromised patients such as those
with sarcoidosis, immunoglobulin disorders, chronic glucocorticoid treatment, disorders characterized by dysfunction of cellmediated immunity, conditions requiring the use of anti-tumor
necrosis factor-a therapy and other disease-modifying agents, and
hematologic malignancy [1–5]. Occasionally, otherwise normal
individuals develop serious consequences of invasive disease. It is
estimated that approximately 1 million cases and 625,000 deaths
occur per year worldwide due to central nervous system (CNS)
cryptococcosis among HIV-infected individuals [6]. In comparison, there are few estimates of the burden of cryptococcal disease
among non-HIV-infected patients.
Prognostic factors, which inform treatment recommendations in
the clinical practice guidelines for management [7], are mostly
derived from results of trials conducted in an earlier era of
treatment and risk [8–11]. Since that time, medical and surgical
advancements have ushered in a period with a rapidly growing atrisk population of patients who frequently receive specific
immunosuppression. This new period includes the introduction
of triazole antifungal therapy, widespread use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), institution of steroid-sparing
immunosuppression including calcineurin inhibitors and biologic
agents, and expansion of both solid organ (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). For example, the clinical
features and outcomes of cryptococcosis that develop following
induction therapy with alemtuzumab and tacrolimus for prevenPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60431

tion of acute organ rejection may differ compared to patients from
an earlier period managed with a glucocorticoid-based regimen.
Few series have been published recently comparing groups of
patients according to immune status, but they are limited in scope
or number of patients [12–15]. More robust data on the
epidemiology and prognostic factors of cryptococcosis in the
current era are needed.
Herein we review cases of cryptococcosis occurring at our
institution from 1996–2010 with two specific aims: 1) to describe
the epidemiology of cryptococcosis at our center and 2) to
characterize prognostic factors associated with death.
Methods
Ethics statement
As the institution had routinely collected the data for patient
care and as analysis of the data posed minimal risk, this protocol
was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board for human
subjects with a waiver of informed consent.
We identified cases of cryptococcosis diagnosed antemortem at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1 January
1996 through 31 December 2010 by review of microbiology and
serology reports, International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision (ICD-9) codes, and outpatient Infectious Diseases clinic
records. The study start date was chosen to minimize confounding
in the associations with mortality due to untreated HIV infection
or other opportunistic infections by limiting the cohort to those
HIV-positive patients with the opportunity to receive cART. A
standardized case report form was used to collect data on age, sex,
race, site of involvement, underlying disease, clinical presentation,
length of symptoms, diagnostic laboratory and radiographic
results, medical treatment, interventions, and outcomes.
Definitions
A case was defined by a positive culture for Cryptococcus spp.
from blood, body fluid, tissue, or sputum, or a positive serum or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) assay with a
compatible clinical and/or radiographic presentation. Sites of
involvement were classified as follows: 1) central nervous system
(CNS), which included meningeal and parenchymal brain
involvement, included patients with infection of the CNS alone
and encompassed those with concomitant CNS and pulmonary
disease; 2) pulmonary, which included disease limited to the lungs,
pleura, and/or pleural fluid but not CNS; 3) blood, which involved
any isolation of Cryptococcus spp. in blood culture; and 4) other. To
determine that cryptococcosis was the etiology of pulmonary
disease, patients had to demonstrate a positive serum CrAg or
culture of blood, pleural fluid, lung tissue, or sputum with a
compatible abnormal chest radiograph with nodules, lobar
consolidation, interstitial pattern, or ARDS. In the presence of
concomitant CNS disease, patients had to demonstrate a
compatible abnormal chest radiograph, but no additional pulmonary sampling was required. A single patient may have more than
one site of involvement. For example, a patient with pulmonary
nodules and a positive blood culture and CSF CrAg was classified
as blood and CNS sites of involvement whereas a patient with
pulmonary nodules and a positive blood culture was classified as
pulmonary and blood sites. Time to diagnosis was defined by the
length of symptoms measured in days. It corresponded to the
number of days between symptom onset and meeting the case
definition.
Patients were categorized into the following 3 groups based
upon immune status: HIV-positive, OTRs, and NHNT patients.
Predisposing conditions were defined as follows: chronic steroid use
was the daily use of more than 5 mg prednisone equivalent for
.30 days preceding the date of diagnosis of cryptococcosis; renal
insufficiency/end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was either a glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) 15–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that persisted for
more than 90 days (renal insufficiency) or GFR ,15 mL/min/
1.73 m2 or dialysis within 90 days (ESRD) preceding the date of
diagnosis of cryptococcosis; cancer included hematologic malignancies and malignant solid tumors documented prior to the diagnosis
of cryptococcosis; and rheumatologic disease was the presence of
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or inflammatory myopathy. Patients with
no identifiable predisposing conditions who had negative testing
for CD4+ lymphocytopenia and immunoglobulin deficiency were
classified as having no underlying disease.
Antifungal therapy was classified according to drug(s) administered for induction, consolidation, and chronic suppression.
Induction was defined by the initial drug(s) given for $3 days.
Consolidation was defined as the therapy given following a
response to the induction regimen. Chronic suppression represented the ongoing maintenance antifungal therapy given to
patients without evidence of active disease. The duration of
antifungal therapy and the average daily dose were recorded.
The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Attributable mortality due to cryptococcosis was also determined. It
included patients who died without a response to therapy or died
of any acute event involving their site of infection. Follow up began
on the date of diagnosis and ended on the date of death or the date
of the last available record.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed, and differences in
characteristics across groups were analyzed by chi-square test or
analysis of variance techniques. Multivariable analyses for
prognostic factors associated with 90-day mortality were performed using stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The
criterion for entry into the model was significance at the a= 0.20
level while the criterion for remaining in the model was
significance at the a = 0.05 level. Odds ratios and corresponding
95% confidence intervals were calculated. Model fit was assessed
using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, and the
model fit the data well. All statistical tests were two-tailed and
utilized a 5% significance level. Analyses were performed using
SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North
Carolina).
Results
Patient characteristics
During the study period, there were 302 patients diagnosed with
cryptococcosis at UAB. One hundred eight (36%) were HIVpositive, 84 (28%) were OTRs, and 110 (36%) were NHNT
patients. Among approximately 200 viable cultures available for
subsequent testing, there were 2 isolates of C. gattii. The remaining
isolates were C. neoformans. As illustrated in Table 1, the mean time
to diagnosis among NHNT patients was 68 days, significantly
longer compared to HIV-positive (22) and OTRs (26) (p,0.001).
HIV-positive patients were significantly younger and composed of
a greater proportion of African-American men (all p,0.05),
features consistent with the epidemiology of patients in care for
HIV at our institution. They were more likely to present with
headache, altered mental status, and visual changes (all p,0.05) in
accordance with their greater proportion of CNS disease and
cryptococcemia compared to OTRs and NHNT patients, who, as
shown in Figure 1, more often demonstrated disease confined to

the lungs (all p,0.05). The distribution of OTRs delineated in
Table 1 reflects the activity of the transplant programs at our
institution. A higher proportion of an organ type does not equate
to risk of infection. Among patients with CNS disease, 38/95
(40%) HIV-positive patients demonstrated baseline opening
pressures .25 cmH2O compared with 11/50 (22%) OTRs and
13/55 (24%) NHNT patients (p,0.001).
Laboratory and radiographic findings
Median serum CrAg was 1:256 (IQR 1:16–1:2048) and median
CSF CrAg 1:256 (IQR 1:16–1:2048). Among those with CNS
disease, mean CSF cell count among NHNT patients was 201
per mm3
, significantly higher compared to HIV-positive patients
(65) and OTRs (91) (p = 0.026), while mean CSF glucose was
39 mg/dL, significantly lower than HIV-positive patients (46) and
OTRs (53) (p = 0.038). NHNT patients demonstrated the highest
mean CSF protein, 185 mg/dL, but it was not significantly
different compared to HIV-positive patients (133) and OTRs (108)
(p = 0.297). The proportion of patients with positive CSF cultures
was similar across groups, ranging from 82 to 86% (p = 0.722).
Among 169 patients with baseline head computed tomography
(CT), 151 (89%) had CNS cryptococcosis. Twenty-one (13%)
patients demonstrated hydrocephalus, 4 (2%) mass lesions, and
144 (85%) were normal. Two hundred eighty-two (93%) patients
had baseline plain chest radiographs of which 171 (59%) were
normal. Abnormalities included 34 (12%) patients with lobar
consolidation, 30 (11%) with a diffuse interstitial pattern, 26 (9%)
unilateral nodules, 14 (5%) bilateral nodules, 18 (6%) pleural
effusions, and 4 (1%) with cavitation. Ninety-six patients underwent chest CT demonstrating pulmonary nodules in 8/16 (50%)
HIV-positive patients, 22/32 (69%) OTRs, and 29/48 (60%)
NHNT patients. Cavitary lesions were noted in 3/16 (19%) HIVpositive patients, 4/32 (13%) OTRs, and 8/48 (17%) NHNT
patients.
Treatment and outcome
For induction therapy, 149 (49%) patients received a combination of either amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) or a lipid
formulation of amphotericin B (LFAmB) plus flucytosine (5-FC); of
these, 87 (58%) received combination therapy with AmBd plus 5-
FC and 62 (42%) with LFAmB plus 5-FC. Nineteen (6%) patients
received a combination of AmBd or LFAmB plus fluconazole.
Finally, 71 (24%) received fluconazole alone, among whom 54
(76%) had non-CNS disease. The remainder of the patients (30
[10%] with CNS disease and 33 [11%] with non-CNS disease)
received induction with an AmB product alone or no induction.
There was little variability in drugs used for consolidation and
chronic suppression: most patients received 200–400 mg average
daily dose of fluconazole. Comparative effectiveness of induction
regimens with combination therapy, as measured by 90-day
mortality, related to site of infection is presented in Table 2. For
patients with CNS disease, there was no significant difference in
outcomes. For patients with non-CNS disease, those receiving
fluconazole alone or in combination with either AmBd or LFAmB
for induction had the lowest mortality.
Prognostic factors
Among all patients, 90-day mortality was 21%. Among those
deaths with available data (n = 55), 42 (76%) were attributable to
cryptococcosis. At one year of follow up, among 71 deaths with
available data, 48 (68%) were attributable to cryptococcosis.
Mortality was highest in the NHNT group (27%), but this did not
reach statistical significance across groups (p = 0.190). The
Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in Figure 2. On
univariate analyses, prognostic factors positively associated with
90-day mortality included cancer (p = 0.018), fever (p = 0.031),
altered mental status (p = 0.001), positive blood cultures
(p,0?001), and high ($1:512) serum CrAg (p = 0.021). Demographic and clinical features negatively associated with 90-day
mortality were age ,50 (p = 0.020), presenting with headache
(p = 0.003) or cough (p = 0.047), and pulmonary site of infection
(p = 0.027).
In multivariable logistic regression analyses, cryptococcemia
(OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.54–10.22; p,0.001)and baseline opening
pressure .25 cmH2O (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.25–6.88; p = 0.013)
were associated with increased odds of mortality (Table 3).
Presenting with altered mental status (OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.98–
3.91; p = 0.057) was associated with higher odds of death, but the
association did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, age
,50 (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.92; p = 0.029) and headache (OR
0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.68; p = 0.003) were protective. Choice of
induction therapy, organ transplant type, and organ failure
syndromes were not significant prognostic factors and were not
retained in any of the multiple models evaluated (data not shown).
Finally, too few patients received any one specific biologic
immunosuppressive agent to permit meaningful comparisons
among drugs in that class. Therefore, no individual agent could
be shown to be associated with mortality in any of the multiple
models evaluated (data not shown).
Discussion
Our study is the largest single-site series of well-described,
contemporary cases of cryptococcosis in a heterogeneous population to address the prognostic factors associated with mortality. We
observed that patients with cryptococcemia, high intracranial
pressure, and altered mental status had increased odds of dying.
Patients who were under the age of 50 and those who presented
with headache had reduced odds of death. HIV-positive patients
and OTRs demonstrated decreased odds of mortality compared to
NHNT patients. We further documented significant differences in
clinical features across groups categorized by immune status. HIVFigure 1. Differential site of infection by host immune status

positive patients exhibited more CNS disease and positive blood
cultures than OTRs and NHNT patients. They were also more
likely to have elevated baseline opening pressure and high CSF
CrAg. NHNT patients exhibited greater CSF pleocytosis, protein
concentration, and hypoglycorrhachia, representing a more robust
inflammatory response compared to the other groups. Finally, we
identified 39 patients with no identifiable immunodeficiency with
cryptococcosis whose characterization and comparison to immunocompromised patients are intriguing and require much more
detailed analysis.
Prior to the global HIV pandemic, cryptococcosis was
recognized to be associated with dysfunction of cell-mediated
immunity, and subsequently, HIV-associated disease has been well
documented. The emerging prominent group of NHNT patients
has been far less studied. One substantial contribution of our work
involves the detailed description and analysis of that important
group in the modern era. The time to diagnosis among NHNT
patients was extremely prolonged, and it has been shown that
delays in diagnosis and treatment were associated with poor
outcomes [16]. Indeed, our results showed NHNT patients
demonstrated the highest mortality at both 90 days and one year.
This extended time to diagnosis possibly accounts for the higher
mortality at 90 days, but we suspect the differences in one-year
mortality are due to the NHNT patients’ other underlying
diseases. Considering the 71 immunocompromised NHNT
patients and excluding the 39 individuals with no identifiable
immunodeficiency, we found that 90-day mortality was 35% (25/
71), which approximated research settings in sub-Saharan Africa
(24–37%) [17], [18]. These findings were also consistent with
recent retrospective data from a smaller U.S. cohort that found
37% mortality among NHNT patients whose mean duration of
symptoms was longer than the comparator groups of HIV-positive
patients and OTRs [19]. Work from Taiwan also showed higher
mortality (30 vs. 5%, p = 0.029) and longer symptom duration
among HIV-negative patients with meningitis compared to HIVpositive patients [20]. That protracted time to diagnosis may lead
to additional morbidity. Stroke, blindness, deafness, neurologic
disability, and cognitive dysfunction, for example, may disproportionately affect NHNT patients due in part to delayed diagnosis
and treatment, a possibility that needs to be explored.
Our results examining other differences across patient groups
based upon immune status were generally in agreement with
recent studies with an important exception for the proportion of
patients with cryptococcemia. It has been shown by utilizing the
Prospective Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH) registry in North
America that 74/88 (84%) HIV-positive patients studied had CNS
disease [13]. Nearly the same proportion has been found in a
recent analysis of a cohort from the Southeast U.S., which
demonstrated that 74/86 (86%) HIV-positive patients examined
had CNS disease [19]. In studies from Thailand and Taiwan, it
has been shown that 137/149 (92%) and 10/10 (100%) HIVTable 2. Comparative effectiveness of induction with combination therapy, as measured by 90-day mortality, related to site of

Cryptococcosis: Predictors of Mortality

positive patients evaluated had CNS disease, respectively [14],
[21]. Pulmonary involvement was more common among OTRs
and NHNT patients in those studies, but there was no difference in
the proportion of positive blood cultures between HIV-positive
and HIV-negative patients. In contrast, our data showed
significantly more cryptococcemia among HIV-positive patients,
which is consistent with a comparison of 19 HIV-positive patients
to 53 HIV-negative patients in Taiwan that found significantly
more cryptococcemia in HIV-positive patients (53 vs. 21%,
p = 0.009) [20]. This finding was not trivial given that the
strongest association with 90-day mortality was a positive blood
culture. The size of our cohort and robust clinical microbiology
and mycology laboratory support at our institution may explain
how differences in the proportion of patients with cryptococcemia
emerged. With regard to other diagnostic findings including higher
CSF CrAg titer and elevated opening pressure among HIVinfected patients compared to OTRs and NHNT patients, our
results were consistent with published studies [14], [15], [19–21].
Taken together, the above observations underscore the importance of considering host factors in cryptococcosis as a critical step
in understanding prognostic factors associated with mortality.
In our data, the association of cryptococcemia with poorer
outcome is perhaps not surprising given its correlation with more
severe and/or disseminated disease [22–25]. The association
between high intracranial pressure, the aggressive management of
which is known to be crucial, and mortality is expected; however,
presenting with headache, a feature associated with elevated
pressure, was associated with lower odds of mortality. It was
possible patients sufficiently cognitively intact to complain of
headache suffered less severe disease than those who presented
with altered mental status incapable of such a complaint. The
results of our multivariable model were in agreement with prior
studies that showed altered mental status increased the odds of
dying while younger age was protective [2], [26–28].
Perhaps the most remarkable finding from our data involves the
clinical features and treatment factors that were not associated
with mortality. In studies from an earlier era, it has been shown
that organ failure syndromes, such as renal insufficiency and
cirrhosis, and hematologic malignancy predicted mortality among
306 HIV-negative patients from 15 U.S. medical centers
diagnosed with cryptococcosis from 1990–1996 [2]. It has
additionally been shown in an analysis of 52 patients in Taiwan
with cryptococcemia diagnosed from 1981–2001 that cirrhosis and
severity of sepsis were associated with 30-day mortality [23]. A
literature review of cryptococcosis in OTRs published through
1998 found that only renal failure on admission was predictive of
death among 172 patients [24]. Work in France evaluating 230
patients enrolled from 1997–2001 identified neurological signs and
symptoms, abnormal neuroimaging, and hematological malignancy as predictors of 90-day mortality [26], [27]. All patients in these
series were diagnosed prior to 2002. Neither organ failure
syndromes nor hematologic malignancy was retained in the
multiple models we tested, suggesting a diminished role in
predicting mortality and emphasizing differences between an
older and more contemporary period. It is possible that improved
medical and surgical care for these conditions including renal
replacement therapy, expansion of liver transplant programs and
refinements in surgical technique, utilization of nonmyeloablative
chemotherapy, and use of oral triazole antifungal prophylaxis all
combined to diminish the influence of these conditions on shortterm (90-day) mortality.
Finally, results of our multivariable analyses found no association between drug(s) used for induction and mortality, which is in
contrast to the study by Sun and colleagues in which patients who
received LFAmB had reduced odds of dying [29]. In that study
restricted to OTRs, 37/55 (67%) LFAmB recipients received
combination therapy with 5-FC, a significantly higher proportion
compared to 8/20 (40%) AmBd recipients (p = 0.033). Studies in
varied patient populations have shown a beneficial role for
combination therapy with 5-FC [8], [11], [24], [30], [31], whose
differential administration in that study may partially account for
the apparent benefit of LFAmB. Our data comparing 136 patients
with CNS disease who received a combination of AmBd plus 5-FC
or LFAmB plus 5-FC revealed similar mortality (20 vs. 25%;
p = 0.454) (Table 2).
The analysis of our large, heterogeneous modern cohort
provides advantages over prior studies, but the observational
design was limited principally by confounding by indication, and
results of some comparisons should be interpreted cautiously. For
example, patients with non-CNS disease who received fluconazole
alone had the lowest mortality, almost certainly reflecting less
severe disease rather than therapeutic superiority [7]. Clinicians’
perception of patients’ severity of illness may have led to
systematically different management, which could neither be
controlled for nor captured. Although we measured a number of
covariates, unmeasured variables remained. As a tertiary referral
center within the Southeast U.S., our medical center manages
patients with more complicated and co-morbid conditions,
representing a referral bias. These data also reflected the biases
of the clinicians at our institution, but limiting the cohort initially
to a single center increased internal validity. Another important
advantage of our study involved the employment of 90-day
mortality as the primary outcome rather than a surrogate
microbiologic endpoint, which may not directly translate into
patient-perceived benefit and harm.
Although significant attention has been justifiably focused on
the burden of HIV-associated cryptococcosis in sub-Saharan
Africa and much of the developing world, the present study
reinforces that cryptococcal infections continue to be associated
with substantial mortality among a contemporary group of
patients in the U.S. Our observations provide valuable insights
into the predictors of mortality and identify important differences
across groups based upon immune status. Moreover, they may
serve in refining management recommendations and for fostering
earlier recognition of cryptococcosis. Data analyzing predictors of
death and other important outcome measures such as neurologic
disability based on host immune status are needed.
