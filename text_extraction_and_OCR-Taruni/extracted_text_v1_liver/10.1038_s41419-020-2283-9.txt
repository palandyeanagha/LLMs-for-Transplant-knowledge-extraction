Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver disease and may progress to nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular determinants of this pathogenic
progression, however, remain largely undefined. Since liver tumorigenesis is driven by apoptosis, we examined the
effect of overt hepatocyte apoptosis in a mouse model of NASH using mice lacking myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), a
pro-survival member of the BCL-2 protein family. Hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout (Mcl1Δhep) mice and control
littermates were fed chow or FFC (high saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol) diet, which induces NASH, for 4 and
10 months. Thereafter, liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development were evaluated biochemically and
histologically. Mcl1Δhep mice fed with the FFC diet for 4 months displayed a marked increase in liver injury, hepatocyte
apoptosis, hepatocyte proliferation, macrophage-associated liver inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis in contrast to
chow-fed Mcl1Δhep and FFC diet-fed Mcl1-expressing littermates. After 10 months of feeding, 78% of FFC diet-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice developed liver tumors compared to 38% of chow-fed mice of the same genotype. Tumors in FFC dietfed Mcl1Δhep mice were characterized by cytologic atypia, altered liver architecture, immunopositivity for glutamine
synthetase, and histologically qualified as HCC. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that excessive hepatocyte
apoptosis exacerbates the NASH phenotype with enhancement of tumorigenesis in mice.
Introduction
Obesity-related co-morbidities including non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have paralleled the increasing
prevalence of obesity and are a major public health concern. NAFLD is currently the most common chronic liver
disease with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 25%1
.
NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions
ranging from steatosis to a more severe and progressive
disease termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH is characterized by hepatocyte injury and
apoptosis, hepatic infiltration by inflammatory cells and
varying degrees of fibrosis, and may culminate in liver
cirrhosis and/or the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)2
. Advanced fibrosis in particular has been
reported to be associated with a significantly increased
risk for HCC. For example, up to 13% of individuals with
NASH-related cirrhosis develop HCC over 3 years in
contrast to 0–3% of NAFLD cohort without cirrhosis
followed for a period of 10–20 years3
. Thus, cirrhosis is
associated with an increased risk but at the same time is
not required for HCC development in NAFLD. Congruently, up to 45–50% of patients with NAFLD-related
HCC develop the malignancy in the absence of cirrhosis3
.
The mechanisms of non-cirrhotic carcinogenesis in
NAFLD may or may not be different from that occurring
in cirrhotic liver. Recently, we identified central players in
the pathogenesis of NASH and NASH-driven liver cancer
development at the cellular and molecular level4,5
.

mechanisms underlying NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis is urgently needed.
Recent studies using various preclinical models have
clearly demonstrated that excessive hepatocyte apoptosis
can drive liver tumorigenesis6
. This has been well established in genetic mouse models in the context of dysregulated expression of BCL-2 family proteins, which
control the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Liverspecific deletion of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), an
anti-apoptotic protein, results in spontaneous hepatocyte
apoptosis, compensatory proliferation and eventually
HCC7,8
. Interestingly, in this mouse model, hepatocytes
display a high degree of genomic instability and HCC
develops in the absence of overt inflammation8
. Our
recent study also demonstrated that the risk for HCC
development tightly correlates with the magnitude of
hepatocyte apoptosis in early life of these transgenic
mice9
. In addition, perturbation of extrinsic apoptotic
pathway may also lead to increased hepatocyte apoptosis,
compensatory proliferation and HCC. Compound deletion of proteins involved in the death receptor signaling
cascade, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 and TNF
receptor-associated factor 2, in liver parenchymal cells
causes excessive hepatocyte apoptosis, compensatory
proliferation, and development of HCC10. Excessive
hepatocyte apoptosis in these mice is likely due to
simultaneous activation of caspase 8 and impaired activation of canonical NF-κB. In other mouse models, dysregulated physiological NF-κB activation in hepatocytes
due to ablation of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) or
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1
(TAK1) also results in excessive hepatocyte cell death and
eventual hepatocarcinogenesis11,12. Altogether, these
preclinical studies support the concept that aberrant
hepatocyte apoptosis may drive liver carcinogenesis.
Hepatocyte apoptosis is significantly increased in NASH
and correlates with disease severity13; however, whether
the proapoptotic environment of fatty liver is tumor
promoting has not been established. Therefore we asked:
Is apoptosis a driving factor in tumorigenesis in fatty liver
disease? To address this question we combined a model of
diet-induced NASH with a liver apoptosis-prone model,
i.e., hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout mice. We
observed that excessive hepatocyte apoptosis due to Mcl1
loss drives HCC development in fatty liver disease. Thus,
this study provides evidence that excessive hepatocyte
apoptosis is tumor promoting also in fatty liver disease
and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 is tumor suppressive
in mouse liver affected by NASH.
Materials and methods
Animals and experimental design
All animal experiments conformed to the relevant regulatory standards and were approved by the Cantonal
Veterinary Office (license ZH136/14). Conditional
hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout mice (homozygous
Mcl1flox/flox-Albumin-Cre referred to as Mcl1Δhep) and
control littermates (Mcl1flox/flox referred to as WT) on
C57BL/6 background were generated and genotyped as
previously described7
. Animals were housed under
temperature-controlled conditions, humidity, and a 12 h/
12 h light–dark circadian cycle. Mcl1Δhep and WT mice
used in the study were males, littermates and co-housed
in the same cages. At two months of age, mice were
placed on a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol (40%
calories from fat, 0.2% cholesterol, AIN-76A Western
Diet, TestDiet, St. Louis, MO) with exogenous glucose
plus fructose (42 g/L) added to the drinking water or
maintained on a standard chow and water for 4 and
10 months. The former diet was termed the FFC (high
saturated fat, high fructose, and high cholesterol) diet.
The FFC diet feeding in mice results in the development
of obesity, insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation,
and NASH with hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis, which
displays high fidelity to human NASH14–19. Of note, mice
had ad libitum access to food and water, and their food
and water intake was not recorded. At the end of the
feeding period, mice were sacrificed under general anesthesia, and blood and liver were harvested for further
analysis. Investigators were not blinded to the group
allocation during the experiment, data acquisition and
analyses.
Biochemical analysis
Serum AST and ALT activities were determined on a
Roche Modular System (Roche Diagnostics) with a commercially available automated colorimetric system at the
Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Zurich, using a Hitachi P-Modul (Roche). Triglyceride concentrations in mouse liver homogenates were measured
using EnzyChrome triglyceride assay kit (BioAssay Systems) as previously described by us20.
Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Sirius red
staining
For histological review, liver tissue was diced into sections, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then embedded in
paraffin. Tissue sections (2 μm) were prepared using a
microtome and placed on glass slides. Hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining was performed according to standard
techniques. For immunohistochemistry, paraformaldehydefixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue sections were deparaffinized, and hydrated. Incubation in Ventana buffer and
staining was performed on a NEXES immunohistochemistry robot (Ventana Instruments) using an IVIEW DAB
Detection Kit (Ventana) or on a Bond MAX (Leica).
Immunostainings were performed as described before9

dilution (Lab Vision, #RM-9106-S); cleaved caspase 3,
1:300 dilution (Cell Signaling Technology, #9661); F4/80,
1:50 dilution (BMA Biomedicals, #T-2006); glutamine
synthetase, 1:800 dilution (Abcam, #ab16802); collagen IV,
1:50 dilution (Cedarlane, #CL50451AP); GP73, 1:100 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-48011); and β-catenin,
1:25 dilution (Cell Signaling Technology, #9582). The tissue
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For virtual
microscopy and archiving, histological and immunohistochemical images were digitalized using a Nano Zoomer
C9600 Virtual Slide Light microscope scanner by Hamamatsu using NDP View Software. To quantify immunohistochemical staining for F4/80, five animals per group
and at least five random pictures of liver (20×) tissue per
animal were assessed by morphometry using color deconvolution and ImageJ software (NIH). To quantify immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase 3 and Ki67,
positively stained hepatocytes were counted in 20 random
microscopic fields (20×) in five animals per group. Liver
fibrosis was assessed using Sirius red staining on paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Redstained collagen fibers were quantified by digital image
analysis using ImageJ in five animals per group. Sudan red
staining (0.25% Sudan IV in ethanolic solution) was performed on frozen liver sections (5 μm) according to a
standard method and slides were scanned with a Nano
Zoomer (Hamamatsu, Japan).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA from liver tissue or liver tumors was isolated
with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).
Quantification of gene expression was performed by realtime polymerase chain reaction using SYBR green fluorescence on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche). Specific
primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Target gene
expression was calculated using ΔΔCt method. Expression was normalized to 18S expression levels, which were
stable across all experimental groups. All data represent
fold change over expression in Mcl1flox/flox (WT) mice fed
standard chow diet.
Immunoblot analysis
Liver tissue (~20 g for FFC-fed mice, ~10 g for chow-fed
mice) was homogenized in lysis buffer (T-PER reagent,
Roche, #11,697,498,001, containing Halt Protease and
Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail, Thermo
Fisher, #78442) followed by centrifugation at 15,000×g for
15 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Protein concentration
was determined by the Bradford assay method. Equal
amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated
overnight with primary antibodies: Mcl1 (Rockland Inc.,
#600–401–394S, 1:2500 dilution) and GAPDH (Millipore,
#3155980, 1:5000 dilution). Next day, membranes were
washed, incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (IR Dye 800Rb, LI-COR, #926–32213;
IR Dye 680Mo, LI-COR, #926–68072) and imaged using
ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). GAPDH was
used as a loading control. Densitometry-based quantification of the protein bands was performed using Image
Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Cytokine and chemokine protein array
Proteome Profiler Mouse Cytokine Array Kit (R&D
Systems) was used to assess protein levels in mouse liver
tissue. Liver tissue samples (~20 g for FFC-fed mice, ~10 g
for chow-fed mice) were homogenized according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentrations in
liver lysates were measured and adjusted to equal levels.
Four samples per group (representing four mice) were
pooled for the experiment. Protein array membranes were
incubated with liver lysates (200 µg of protein in 4 mL)
overnight and detection of the signal was performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Densitometrybased quantification was performed using Image Lab
software (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± SEM. The number of
mice used for analyses is listed in the figure legend. Fourmonths-long and 10-months-long mouse feeding studies
were carried out once. Statistical methods were not
applied to predetermine sample size; however, our animal
sample size is similar to those reported in previous animal
studies focused on NASH. No randomization method was
used to determine how animals were allocated to
experimental groups. No data were excluded from the
study. Differences between multiple groups were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Individual
group means were compared with Student’s unpaired
t-test in which p < 0.05 was the minimum requirement for
a statistically significant difference. Non-parametric data
(NAS and tumor incidence) were analyzed using
Mann–Whitney test. All analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 8 software (San Diego, CA).
Results
Hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 deficiency accentuates liver
injury in a murine model of diet-induced obesity with
NASH
To explore the role of hepatocyte apoptosis in obesityinduced NASH, hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout mice
(referred to as Mcl1Δhep) and control littermates (Mcl1flox/flox
referred to as WT) were placed on standard chow or highfat, high-fructose, high-cholesterol (FFC) diet for 4 months
(Fig. 1a). The FFC diet feeding is a well characterized
NASH model with features of obesity, insulin resistance,

adipose tissue inflammation, and steatohepatitis with
hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis, displaying high fidelity to human NASH14,16,19,21–23. To validate efficiency of
cre recombinase-mediated deletion, we assessed Mcl1 at
both mRNA and protein levels. Indeed, Mcl1 expression
was diminished in the livers of Mcl1Δhep mice
(Fig. 1b–d). Hepatic expression of other anti-apoptotic
proteins, Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, was not affected in chow-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice compared to control (WT) littermates
(Fig. 1d), suggesting that the loss of Mcl1 did not cause
compensatory expression of other pro-survival genes of
Bcl2 family.
In the current study, both WT and Mcl1Δhep mice on
the FFC diet developed a similar degree of obesity,
increased liver weight and steatosis compared to standard
chow-fed mice (Fig. 2a–c). FFC-diet induced hepatic
macrovesicular steatosis did not differ between WT and
Mcl1Δhep mice on the FFC diet, as assessed by histology,
Sudan red stain and biochemical quantification of neutral
triglycerides (Fig. 2c, h). Mcl1Δhep mice on FFC diet,
however, displayed increased liver injury as manifest by
substantially elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values compared to
WT FFC-fed animals (Fig. 2d, e). As hepatocyte apoptosis
is a prominent histopathologic feature of NASH13, we
next examined apoptosis in liver tissue samples using
immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase 3. As
expected, WT mice on the FFC diet demonstrated a significant increase in liver cleaved caspase 3-positive cells
compared to standard chow-fed animals (Fig. 2f, h).
Consistent with the elevated serum AST and ALT levels,
FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice displayed a marked increase in
cleaved caspase 3-positive cells compared to WT FFC-fed
mice (Fig. 2f, h, arrowheads). Congruent with our prior
studies, chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice also displayed spontaneous liver injury as evidenced by increased serum
transaminases and increased number of cleaved caspase
3-positive cells in the liver7,8
. Finally, liver histology of
FFC-fed mice was assessed by a pathologist using human
NAFLD activity score (NAS)24. Compared to FFC-fed WT
mice, FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice had a significantly higher
NAS, which was largely due to increased lobular inflammation and ballooning (Fig. 2g). These data collectively
suggest that Mcl1 deficiency in hepatocytes accentuates
liver injury and NAFLD severity in FFC diet-fed mice.
Hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout mice fed the FFC diet
display exacerbated macrophage-associated inflammation
and fibrosis
Inflammation in both murine and human NASH is
characterized by accumulation and activation of proinflammatory macrophages25,26. Therefore, we explored the
extent to which cells of this lineage accumulated in liver
after 4 months of feeding. Using immunohistochemistry

on liver tissue sections, we detected a substantial increase
in F4/80-positive cells in the FFC diet-fed Mcl1Δhep mice
compared to FFC-fed WT mice, suggesting a marked
accumulation of macrophages (Fig. 3a, b). Macrophage
activation was examined by measuring mRNA expression
of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor
(Tnf), interleukin (Il) 1b and 12b, and chemokines, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10) and chemokine
(C–C motif) ligands (Ccl), known to be secreted by activated macrophages. Indeed, hepatic mRNA levels of
cytokines Tnf and Il12b and chemokines Cxcl10, Ccl2,
Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5 were significantly increased in FFCfed Mcl1Δhep mice compared to FFC-fed WT mice
(Fig. 3c, d). In addition, we profiled 40 cytokines and
chemokines in the liver tissue at a post-transcriptional
level using a protein array (Suppl. Fig. 1). We found that
hepatic protein levels of cytokines and chemokines
showed similar trends as mRNA. Compared to other
experimental groups, the FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice had the
highest levels of Il1b, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl5 (Fig. 3e;
Suppl. Fig. 1). Thus, these observations extend the histologic assessment by NAS (Fig. 2g) and confirm that
hepatocyte Mcl1 deficiency promotes FFC diet-induced
hepatic accumulation and activation of macrophages in
the FFC model of NASH.
We next examined the effect of hepatocyte Mcl1 deficiency on the FFC diet-induced liver fibrosis. Sirius red
staining detecting collagen tissue deposition demonstrated the presence of chicken wire-like perisinusoidal
fibrosis in the liver of FFC diet-fed WT mice, which was
significantly increased in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice (Fig. 4a,
b). Consistent with the histological findings, increased
liver fibrogenesis in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice was evident
through upregulated mRNA levels of collagen 1a1, alpha
smooth muscle actin (Acta2) and osteopontin, markers of
activated hepatic stellate cells (Fig. 4c). Thus, Mcl1 deficiency in hepatocytes promotes FFC-diet induced liver
fibrogenesis, presumably by increasing liver injury and
consequently liver inflammation, as commonly seen in
chronic liver disease27,28. Of note, although it does not
indicate a causal relationship, in our cohort of mice, we
found that the degree of fibrosis strongly and positively
correlated with the magnitude of hepatocyte injury
(serum AST and ALT; Suppl. Fig. 2), suggesting that
hepatocyte injury is linked to liver fibrogenesis.
Hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout mice fed the FFC diet
exhibit increased hepatocyte proliferation
We have previously demonstrated that deletion of Mcl1
in hepatocytes results in greater hepatocyte proliferation
in two-month-old mice fed standard chow diet9
. Thus, we
examined whether FFC diet-induced hepatocyte apoptosis
was also linked to compensatory hepatocyte proliferation.
Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 revealed that FFC-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice displayed a significant increase in number
of Ki67-positive hepatocytes compared to both FFC-fed
WT mice and chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice (Fig. 5a, b).
Mcl1 deficiency in hepatocytes promotes tumor
development in mice fed the FFC diet
Another cohort of WT and Mcl1Δhep mice were fed a
standard chow or the FFC diet for 10 months (Fig. 1a). At
the time of sacrifice, FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice had significantly lower body weight compared to FFC-fed WT
mice (Fig. 6a), but the liver to body weight ratio was not
different (Fig. 6b). Similar to the 4-month feeding, FFCfed Mcl1Δhep mice had significantly increased serum
transaminases, ALT and AST, compared to FFC-fed WT
mice (Fig. 6c, d). Macroscopic examination of the livers
revealed that 8 of 21 chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice were
bearing tumors (incidence ~38%, Fig. 6e, f). The tumors in
chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice showed similar characteristics as
previously reported by us in detail8
. Advanced tumors
histologically qualified as HCC. Most strikingly, 14 of 18
FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice developed macroscopic liver
tumors (incidence ~78%, Fig. 6e, f), confirmed by histologic analyses. Interestingly, tumor lesions in FFC-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice differed from tumors in chow-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice8,29 in respect to their growth pattern
which frequently lacked distinct borders (Fig. 6g, left and
middle image) but often showed nodule-in-nodule
appearance (Fig. 6g, middle and right image). The
tumors in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice displayed cellular atypia, altered liver-architecture with broadening of liver cell
cords highlighted by collagen IV staining, and frequent
immunoreactivity for glutamine synthetase, nuclear

histologically qualified as HCC. In addition, these tumors
displayed increased positivity for cleaved caspase 3 and
were highly proliferative as indicated by increased
immunoreactivity for Ki67 (Fig. 6i). To gain insight into
tumor gene expression patterns, using qPCR we profiled
candidate genes identified as being dysregulated in liver
cancer30. We found several significant differences in
tumor gene expression between chow and FFC diet
(Fig. 6j). For example, the FFC diet feeding upregulated

proliferation-related genes (e.g., spindle checkpoint genes
Bub1 and Dlg7) in the liver tumors of Mcl1Δhep mice. On
the other hand, FFC diet feeding was associated with a
downregulation of hepatocyte markers Aldh2 and Apoc4.
These results suggest that the FFC diet feeding significantly affects both histologic features and transcriptome of liver tumors. Altogether, these data indicate
that combination of aberrant hepatocyte apoptosis and
fatty liver condition promotes hepatocarcinogenesis and
changes the quality of tumors.
Discussion

hepatocyte apoptosis in fatty liver disease promotes liver

tumorigenesis. The principal findings of this study indicate that in mice fed a NASH-inducing FFC diet, hepatocyte Mcl1 deficiency: (i) exacerbates liver injury,
inflammation and fibrosis; (ii) further increases compensatory hepatocyte proliferation; and (iii) promotes HCC
development. These findings are discussed in detail below.
To study NASH in vivo, we utilized a well-established
diet-induced mouse model of NASH14,22. This model
includes a diet high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and
addition of high-fructose syrup in the drinking water (thus
termed FFC diet) and was developed to replicate the
western fast food diet. This model displays a high fidelity
to the metabolic profile observed in humans with NASH,
including obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.
Importantly, FFC diet-induced NASH recapitulates key
features of human disease including hepatocyte neutral
lipid accumulation, hepatocyte injury and cell death, the
presence of ballooned hepatocytes, hepatic infiltration of
inflammatory cells, and liver fibrosis14,22. Similar to other
dietary NASH models, FFC-fed C57BL/6 mice do not
develop NASH-related HCC within the time frame of
12 months22.
Hepatocyte survival and cell death are tightly regulated
by proteins belonging to BCL-2 family. In particular, Mcl1
has been previously demonstrated to play a crucial role in
the regulation of hepatocyte survival and cell death.
Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Mcl1 in vivo leads to
spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis and compensatory
proliferation, both of which can be detected in 1-monthold to 4-month-old Mcl1Δhep mice7
. Excessive hepatocyte
apoptosis is also a pathologic hallmark of NASH and
magnitude of hepatocyte apoptosis correlates with NASH
severity, in particular with the degree of inflammatory
activity and fibrosis13. In the present study, Mcl1Δhep mice
placed on the NASH-inducing FFC diet for 4 months
displayed severe liver injury and excessive hepatocyte
apoptosis. These data underscore that Mcl1 is a critical
antiapoptotic factor in hepatocytes not only under steadystate conditions but especially when liver is challenged
with an additional proapoptotic insult such as westernlike diet. Our previous studies uncovered that hepatocyte
cell death in the FFC diet NASH model is mediated, at
least in part, via signaling cascade initiated by TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor as
FFC-fed mice lacking TRAIL, TRAIL receptor or caspase
8 (in hepatocytes) display attenuated liver injury and
hepatocyte apoptosis16,31,32. In hepatocytes, death
receptor-activated proapoptotic signaling converges on
mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway33. Therefore,
loss of mitochondrial antiapoptotic proteins, such as
Mcl1, would be anticipated to further facilitate apoptosis
as seen in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice. Moreover, liver
expression of TRAIL and TRAIL receptor is upregulated
in Mcl1Δhep mice9
, which may also accentuate FFCinduced hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of hepatocyte Mcl1. Along with Mcl1, Bcl-xL is another antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member maintaining hepatocyte
homeostasis and preventing spontaneous apoptosis34,35.
However, it is currently unknown whether deletion of BclxL in hepatocytes would affect progression of fatty liver
disease.
Whereas chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice were not particularly fibrosis-prone, Mcl1Δhep mice fed the FFC diet for
4 months displayed marked liver fibrosis. Albeit multiple
mechanisms may contribute to this observation, it is
likely that increased liver fibrogenesis was a sequela of
exacerbated liver injury and inflammation in FFC-fed
Mcl1Δhep mice. Consistent with our prior studies7,8
,
chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice did not develop overt inflammation at a cellular level. On the other hand, the FFC
diet elicits liver inflammation mediated primarily by
recruitment and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages16,22,23. It is likely that both infiltrating
monocyte-derived macrophages and hepatic stellate cells
contribute to liver fibrogenesis initiated by hepatocyte
cell death. For example, we have previously reported that
the engulfment of hepatocyte apoptotic bodies by stellate
cells is profibrogenic36. In addition, stressed and apoptotic hepatocytes also release chemokines (e.g., CCL2,
CXCL10), which serve as chemoattractants for
(see figure on previous page)

monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment to the
liver37–40. These liver recruited macrophages are considered proinflammatory and profibrogenic13. In the
current study, hepatocyte Mcl1 deficiency in fatty liver
markedly amplified macrophage-associated hepatic
inflammation, which likely, along with hepatocyte cell
death, contributed to increased hepatic stellate cell
activation and fibrogenesis in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice.
Excessive apoptosis may induce compensatory proliferation, which in turn can promote tumorigenesis41.
Indeed, Mcl1Δhep mice displayed not only increased
apoptosis but also increased hepatocyte proliferation, and
this was substantially increased by the FFC diet feeding for
4 months. Indeed, after 10 months of the FFC diet feeding,
we were able to detect tumor formation. We have previously observed that spontaneous chronic liver damage
in Mcl1Δhep results in HCC development in about 50% of
12-month-old mice8
. In the present study, the tumor
incidence in chow-fed Mcl1Δhep mice was 38%. Strikingly,
when Mcl1Δhep mice were fed the FFC diet for 10 month
the tumor incidence increased to 78%, while Mcl1-
expressing (WT) mice on FFC diet did not develop any
liver tumors. Similar to the FFC diet, other NASH models
based on western-like diets in C57BL/6 mouse strain do
not develop HCC in time period shorter than 12 months
unless an additional insult is included. This additional
insult can be a concurrent administration of hepatotoxic
chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, streptozotocin, or
diethylnitrosamine42,43. Altogether, these findings suggest
that fatty liver condition markedly promoted tumorigenesis in HCC susceptible liver.
We have observed qualitative differences between HCC
formed in chow-fed vs. FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice. The
tumors in FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice displayed a distinct
growth pattern which compared to chow-fed Mcl1Δhep
mice8,9 more frequently lacked defined borders, but more
often showed nodule-in-nodule appearance. It is conceivable that a proinflammatory microenvironment in
NASH liver plays a role in this distinct tumor pattern. The
FFC-fed Mcl1 knockout mice presented here also suggest
that factors that are hepatotoxic have additive effects. This
provides a useful model in which we can investigate the
additive effects of hepatotoxic factors in a controlled
manner, more closely simulating the clinical reality than
models built on individual causes of liver disease (e.g.,
NAFLD and simultaneous chronic viral hepatitis). The
concordance of the mouse model and the human disease
may increase the chance of obtaining meaningful results29,
such that FFC-fed Mcl1Δhep mice may provide a more
suitable preclinical model for a particular subtype of
human liver cancer compared to other diet-based4,5 or
genetically modified mouse models8,9
. However, future
mechanistic studies are warranted to fully uncover the
cellular and molecular mechanism behind this observation.
In summary, the current study provides novel evidence
that excessive hepatocyte apoptosis is a driving factor in
liver tumorigenesis. In particular, our findings extend
prior observations by demonstrating a tumor promoting
effect of hepatocyte apoptosis in the setting of fatty liver
disease. Our unique observations include an effect of
hepatocyte Mcl1 deficiency on liver injury, macrophageassociated inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. We propose that proapoptotic microenvironment in
NASH promotes hepatocarcinogenesis and that the antiapoptotic protein Mcl1 serves as a tumor suppressor in
fatty liver.
