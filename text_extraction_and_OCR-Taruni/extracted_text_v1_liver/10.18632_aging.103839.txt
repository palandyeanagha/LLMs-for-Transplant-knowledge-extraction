INTRODUCTION
In the last two decades there have been two largescale pandemics caused by coronaviruses, severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2]. At the end of 
2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), emerged in Wuhan and subsequently spread 
rapidly throughout the world [3, 4]. Due to 
accumulating evidence of continuous person-toperson transmission and a general susceptibility of 
humans to the virus [5–7], the World Health 
Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of 
international concern on January 30, 2020. As of May 
16, 2020, COVID-19 caused 309,713 deaths among 
over 4.5 million patients across more than 200 
countries, with a case-fatality rate of 6.8%. Although 
SARS-CoV-2 was found to predominantly infect the

ABSTRACT
During the COVID-19 outbreak, some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia also suffered from acute abdomen
requiring surgical treatment; however, there is no consensus for the treatment of such patients. In this study,
we retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with acute abdomen who underwent emergency surgery during the
COVID-19 outbreak. Among the 34 patients with acute abdomen, a total of six cases were found with COVID-19
pneumonia (clinical classification for COVID-19 pneumonia: all were the common type). On the premise of
similar demographics between both groups, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had worse indicators of liver
and coagulation function. Compared with acute abdomen patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19
pneumonia had a longer hospital stay, but there were no significant differences in postsurgical complications (P
= 0.58) or clinical outcomes (P = 0.56). In addition, an obvious resolution of lung inflammation after surgery was
observed in five COVID-19 patients (83.3%). No new COVID-19 cases occurred during the patients’ hospital
stays. Therefore, for the common type of COVID-19 pneumonia, emergency surgery could not only improve the
outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute abdomen, but also benefit the resolution of pulmonary
inflammation.

lower airways and cause life-threatening pneumonia
[8, 9], evidence has revealed that the digestive system 
might be another potential viral target [7, 10, 11]. 
Acute abdomen is defined as acute onset of abdominal 
pain which requires accurate diagnosis and treatment 
within a particular time limit to prevent mortality and 
morbidity [12]. During COVID-19 outbreaks, some 
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia also suffered from 
acute abdomen requiring immediate interventions [13]. 
However, previous studies have demonstrated that 
preoperative pneumonia is a significant risk factor for 
poor postsurgical outcomes [14, 15]. In addition, 
surgical treatment might increase medical staff exposure 
to SARS-CoV-2 [16, 17] and trigger excessive 
inflammation in the patient, resulting in worsening of 
COVID-19 pneumonia [18]. Therefore, an investigation 
of the impact of emergency surgery on patients with 
both acute abdomen and COVID-19 pneumonia is 
urgently needed.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of patients
Among the 34 patients with acute abdomen who 
underwent emergency surgery, six patients had COVID19, and the remaining 28 patients did not. The baseline 
characteristics of all patients are summarized in Table 1. 
No new infections were found in medical staff or 
patients throughout the hospitalization period.
Of the 28 patients who did not have COVID-19 
pneumonia (9 female and 19 male; mean age 55 years 
(range 17–87)), 12 (43%) patients were diagnosed with 
acute appendicitis, 10 (36%) with gastrointestinal 
perforation, 5 (18%) with intestinal obstruction and 1 
(4%) with bladder rupture. The typical abdominal CT 
appearance is shown in Figure 1. Comorbidities were 
found in 17 (61%) patients and included diabetes 
mellitus in 7 (25%), coronary heart disease in 7 (25%), 
hypertension in 6 (21.4%), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease in 2 (7.1%), chronic renal failure in 
1 (3.6%), chronic liver failure in 1 (3.6%), acute 
myeloid leukemia in 1 (3.6%), and rheumatoid arthritis 
in 1 (3.6%). Five (17.9%) patients were reported to 
have postoperative complications: one had intraabdominal infection, one had a wound infection, and
three had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
(MODS). All three patients with postoperative MODS 
had preoperative comorbidities (case 1: coronary heart 
disease and chronic renal failure; case 2: chronic liver 
failure; case 3: hypertension and coronary heart 
disease). In total, 25 (89.3%) patients were cured, and 
the remaining 3 patients died due to severe septic 
shock and MODS.
The detailed clinical characteristics of the six patients 
with both acute abdomen and COVID-19 pneumonia 
are shown in Table 2. Age of the six patients (4 
women and 2 men) ranged from 66 to 78 years. Three 
patients were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction, 
two with acute appendicitis, and one with gangrenous 
cholecystitis. The clinical classification of COVID-19 
pneumonia in all patients was the common type. Three 
patients had hypertension, and one had coronary heart 
disease. The most common clinical manifestations 
were abdominal pain and fever. Two (33.3%) patients 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and one 
patient tested positive for IgM-IgG antibodies; 
however, typical CT imaging manifestations of 
COVID-19 pneumonia were found in all six patients. 
Postoperative complications occurred in two patients: 
one had aspiration pneumonia and the other had 
MODS. All patients received antiviral therapy 
(ribavirin, 500 mg each time, twice times a day, 5-7 
days; arbidol, 200 mg each time, three times a day, 5-7 
days; Interferon α-2b, 5.0×105 IU, nebulized 
inhalation, twice times a day) and antibacterial 
therapy, and four patients received immunoglobulins 
(human immunoglobulin, 10g/d). Two patients with 
postoperative complications received mechanical 
ventilation and systematic corticosteroid treatment 
(methylprednisolone, 1–2 mg/kg.d, 3–5 days). In total, 
five patients were cured, and one patient died of 
postoperative MODS.
Emergency surgery could not only improve the 
outcomes of acute abdomen patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia, but also benefit the resolution of 
pulmonary inflammation
The baseline characteristics in patients with and 
without COVID-19 pneumonia are shown in Table 1. 
Differences in demographics, including age (P = 
0.12), sex (P = 0.17), diagnosis (P = 0.06) and 
comorbidities (P = 0.67), between both groups were 
not significant. However, patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia had higher ALT (70.7 ± 108.3 U/L vs. 
18.7 ± 7 U/L, P = 0.012), AST (72.7 ± 93.7 U/L vs. 
20.6 ± 13.7 U/L, P = 0.006), APTT (50.7 ± 10 s vs. 
36.1 ± 3.6 s, P < 0.001), and PT (16.9 ± 4.5 s vs. 14.1 
± 1.2 s, P = 0.006), and lower albumin (30 ± 10.8 g/L 
vs. 41.6 ± 6.5 g/L, P = 0.012) and hemoglobin (107.2 
± 26.8 g/L vs. 143.9 ± 17.4 g/L, P < 0.001) than 
patients who did not have COVID-19 pneumonia. In 
addition, although there were no significant 
differences, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had 
lower infection-related biomarkers, including WBC 
((10.4 ± 6.5)×109/L vs. (11.8 ± 3.8)×109/L, P = 0.49), 
lymphocyte ((0.7 ± 0.3)×109/L vs. (1.1 ± 0.7)×109/L, 
P = 0.26), neutrophil ((8.9 ± 5.9)×109/L vs. (10.1 ± 
3.5)×109/L, P = 0.51), CRP (82.6 ± 72.9 mg/L vs.

μg/L vs. 8.8 ± 8.7 μg/L, P = 0.16), than patients who 
did not have COVID-19 pneumonia.
The comparative data of postsurgical outcomes between 
the two groups are shown in Figure 2. Compared with 
patients who did not have COVID-19 pneumonia, 
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a longer 
hospital stay (19.3 ± 10 days vs. 10.4 ± 6.6 days, P = 
0.009), but no significant differences in postsurgical 
complications (P = 0.58) and clinical outcomes (P = 
0.56) were found between groups. Furthermore, the 
majority of worsening preoperative laboratory 
indicators, including ALT (P = 0.43), AST (P = 0.93), 
APTT (P = 0.1), PT (P = 0.14), albumin (P = 0.44) and 
hemoglobin (P = 0.06), had improved by the third 
postoperative day. As outlined in Figure 3, when 
compared with preoperative indicators, postoperative 
infection-related biomarkers also decreased, including 
WBCs ((10.4 ± 6.5)×109
/L vs. (5.4 ± 3.2)×109/L, P = 
0.19), neutrophils ((8.9 ± 5.9)×109

± 49.8 mg/L, P = 0.55) and PCT (3.4 ± 5.3 μg/L vs. 0.3 
± 0.2 μg/L, P = 0.29).
To remove the potential impact of age on the above 
results, we further compared the pre- and postsurgical 
differences between patients with COVID-19 and 
those without COVID-19 pneumonia (between 60 and 
80 years old). After age-matching between both 
groups, the majority of preoperative and postoperative 
results were consistent with the previous results. As

shown in Table 3, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia 
still had poor preoperative liver and coagulation 
function. However, the bulk of abnormal preoperative 
laboratory findings were significantly and rapidly 
corrected after surgical treatment (Figure 4). In 
addition, an obvious resolution of lung inflammation
was observed after surgery in five patients (83.3%) 
(Figure 5). These results indicated that COVID-19 
pneumonia is associated with poor liver function and 
coagulation function in acute abdomen patients with 
COVID-19 pneumonia. Nevertheless, emergency 
surgery could not only improve the outcomes of

COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute abdomen, 
but also benefit the resolution of pulmonary 
inflammation. 
DISCUSSION
Accurate diagnosis and appropriate intervention within 
a particular time limit is crucial to prevent deterioration 
and mortality in patients with acute abdomen [12]. 
Although previous studies revealed that preoperative 
pneumonia is significantly associated with worse
postoperative outcomes [14, 15], there is still no direct 
evidence suggesting that surgical treatment leads to 
adverse effects in acute abdomen patients with 
COVID-19 pneumonia. Using the data from 34 
patients with acute abdomen who underwent 
emergency surgery at our institute, the results of our 
study show that COVID-19 pneumonia is associated 
with poor liver function and coagulation function in 
acute abdomen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 
However, emergency surgery could not only improve 
the outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with 
acute abdomen, but also benefit the resolution of 
pulmonary inflammation.
COVID-19 might complicate the perioperative course of 
acute abdomen [13, 19]. The bulk of evidence revealed 
that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in stool specimens 
[7, 20] and that the viral receptor angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) was highly expressed in gastrointestinal 
epithelial cells [21, 22], this evidence supported the 
conclusion that the digestive system is a potential target of 
SARS-CoV-2. In addition, infection-related biomarkers 
(including peripheral blood lymphocytes and WBCs) tend 
to decrease in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [3, 4], 
while these indicators frequently increase in patients who 
only have acute abdomen. Blanco-Colino et al. also 
reported a case of suspected acute abdomen as an 
extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 [19]. All of 
these results demonstrated that COVID-19 likely interferes 
with the accurate diagnosis and clinical assessment of 
acute abdomen.

To better carry out emergency surgery during the 
outbreak, our hospital has developed a detailed 
management strategy for acute abdomen patients. For 
patients with stable vital signs and local involvement 
(such as acute appendicitis alone, acute cholecystitis 
alone, and incomplete ileus) not requiring emergency 
surgery, conservative treatment in the outpatient 
department can be considered. If conservative treatment 
fails, emergency surgery should be performed 
immediately. The goal of emergency surgery is to 
remove the patient's lesions rapidly and effectively 
while minimizing the operation time and limiting the 
medical staff’s exposure.
The indications for emergency surgery should be 
strictly managed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The 
possible reasons for opposing surgical interventions 
for acute abdomen accompanied with COVID-19 
pneumonia are as follows: 1) Surgical interventions on 
patients with COVID-19 may lead to contamination of 
the operating room and surgical equipment and risk 
transmission of the infection to healthcare providers 
and other patients in the hospital [17, 23]; 2) surgical 
treatment may trigger oxidative stress [24] and 
immunosuppression [25], which might hinder the 
clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the 
progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the 
scientific foundation of this theory is very weak. 
Jamali et al. reported that preoperative pneumonia only 
moderately increased the risk of mortality (OR= 1.2) 
in patients undergoing emergency surgery [14]. 
Moreover, an improvement of acute abdomen and 
pneumonia after surgery was observed in our study. A 
possible explanation for such results is that surgical 

www.aging-us.com 15778 AGING
treatment alleviated excessive inflammation and 
persistent immunosuppression caused by acute 
abdomen, which in turn contributed to clearance of the 
virus and resolution of lung inflammation. In addition, 
medical staff could effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 
infection through adherence to strict infection 
prevention and control protocols [16, 26]. No new 
infections were found in medical staff or patients 
throughout the hospitalization of patients with or 
without COVID-19 pneumonia in our study.

Current clinical observations have found that most 
COVID-19 patients have fever and acute abdomen 
patients often have fever. In our study, 5 patients 
(17.9%) presented with fever before emergency 
surgery. Some postoperative patients may present 
with fever, which may result from postoperative 
traumatic stress or residual abdominal infection. This 
makes it extremely difficult to identify the cause 
of fever and to identify COVID-19 in a timely 
manner. Elderly patients, especially those with 
pulmonary infections, are more susceptible to 
COVID-19 during the postoperative hospitalization 
period. Therefore, we monitored the patient's body 
temperature closely, and routine blood parameters, 
including PCT and CRP, were regularly retested. If 
necessary, a chest CT scan was performed again to 
monitor COVID-19 pneumonia progression. To 
ensure therapeutic efficacy, we streamlined treatments 
to reduce doctor-patient contact and avoid crossinfection.
This study had certain limitations that should be 
discussed. First, due to the lack of definite practical
guidance for patients with both acute abdomen and 
COVID-19 pneumonia, the indication and timing of the 
surgical treatment was decided empirically instead of 
being based on evidence. Second, this was a smallsample nonrandomized retrospective study without
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and as such, there 
were potential biases that could affect the comparison 
analysis. Third, the availability of clinical care and the 
diversity of COVID-19 management may limit the 
applicability of our results. However, to our knowledge, 
the results of our study provide the first evidence that 
emergency surgery could not only improve the 
outcomes of acute abdomen patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia, but also benefit the resolution of pulmonary 
inflammation. These results hopefully lead to a 
consensus on the treatment and management of acute 
abdomen patients with or without COVID-19 during the 
COVID-19 outbreak.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and patient cohort
We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with acute 
abdomen who underwent emergency surgery from 
February 2, 2020, to March 18, 2020, at the Union 
Hospital affiliated with Tongji Medical College, 
Huazhong University of Science and Technology. This 
study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of 
our college. All patients signed an informed consent 
document indicating their understanding of the 
procedure and its potential complications as well as 
their approval to participate in the research study. A 
flow diagram of the emergency surgery protocol for 
patients with acute abdomen during COVID-19 
outbreaks is presented in Figure 6.
Preoperative work-up 
After a detailed history and a complete physical 
examination, all patients with acute abdomen underwent 
routine laboratory testing (such as complete blood 
counts, serum biochemistry and tumor-marker 
screening) and imaging examination (such as chest Xray, abdominal ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography (CT)). Prior to admission, all patients also 
completed a detailed risk assessment for COVID-19, 
including typical clinical manifestation and contact 
history with suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 
patients within 14 days. CT lung imaging, quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
were also required for all patients to screen for potential 
infections. All suspected COVID-19 cases were treated 
as positive until confirmed. If emergency surgery was 
required, patients with positive indicators for infection 
must be taken directly to a designated COVID operation 
room through a predefined path. Due to the possible 
false negatives of test kits, all surgical procedures were 
carried out using a high level of protection, including
masks, eye protection, gloves, caps and protective 
clothing, for the entire duration of the procedure.
Postoperative work-up 
All patients who were not excluded from possibly 
having COVID-19 were transferred to the isolation 
ward and transitional ward after surgery according to 
the status of the preoperative screening results. Medical 
staff were required to adhere to strict prevention and 
infection control protocols in addition to routine 
universal precautions, and all patients were advised to 
wear a mask throughout hospitalization. Patients in the 
transitional ward underwent another round of RT-PCR 
for SARS-CoV-2. If the screening yielded negative 
results, the patient was transferred and treated in a 
single room of the general ward for three to five days 
prior to transfer to a shared room. If patients presented 
with pyrexia of unknown origin, typical respiratory 
symptoms or CT imaging manifestations indicating 
viral pneumonia, they were transferred to the

transitional ward to retest for SARS-CoV-2 infection by 
RT-PCR. If the screening yielded positive results, 
patients were transferred to the isolation ward for 
further treatment. After the remission of acute abdomen, 
patients in the isolation ward were advised to transfer to 
designated hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19.
Data collection
Primary data, including clinical characteristics, the 
laboratory and imaging examination results, evidence of 
COVID-19, treatments, and clinical outcomes, were 
identified from medical reports. Blood samples from all 
participants were obtained through peripheral 
venipuncture. The following thresholds were considered 
the normal range of indicators: creatinine, 58-110 
μmol/L; total bilirubin, 3-22 μmol/L; albumin, 35-50 g/L; 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 21-72 U/L; aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), 17-59 U/L; hemoglobin 
(HGB), 130-175 g/L; white blood cell (WBC) count, 
(3.5-9.5)×109/L; neutrophil count, (1.8-6.3)×109/L; 
lymphocyte count, (1.1-3.2)×109
/L; C-reaction protein 
(CRP), < 8 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), < 0.5 μg/L; Ddimer, < 0.5 mg/L; activated partial thromboplastin time 
(APTT), 28-43.5 s; and prothrombin time (PT), 11-16 s. 
We adopted the classification system of the New 
Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program 
(7th edition). According to this system, COVID-19 
pneumonia cases were divided into four groups: mild, 
moderate, severe and critically ill. The discharge 
requirements for patients who only had acute abdomen 
include 1) remission of acute abdomen and 2) negative 
SARS-CoV-2 results by RT-PCR. However, for acute 
abdomen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, obvious 
resolution of pulmonary inflammation and negative 
results by RT-PCR for two consecutive evaluation times 
were necessary for discharge.
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and diagrams of curves 
were drawn using Prism (version 6.0; GraphPad). Data 
are presented as numbers and percentages for 
categorical variables, and continuous data are expressed 
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences 
were considered significant at *p<0.05, **p <0.01 and 
***p <0.001. ns: no significance.
