Mice engrafted with components of a human immune system have become widely-used
models for studying aspects of human immunity and disease. However, a defined methodology to objectively measure and compare the quality of the human immune response in
different models is lacking. Here, by taking advantage of the highly immunogenic liveattenuated yellow fever virus vaccine YFV-17D, we provide an in-depth comparison of
immune responses in human vaccinees, conventional humanized mice, and second generation humanized mice. We demonstrate that selective expansion of human myeloid and
natural killer cells promotes transcriptomic responses akin to those of human vaccinees.
These enhanced transcriptomic profiles correlate with the development of an antigen-specific
cellular and humoral response to YFV-17D. Altogether, our approach provides a robust
scoring of the quality of the human immune response in humanized mice and highlights a
rational path towards developing better pre-clinical models for studying the human immune
response and disease.

Much has been learned about how the mammalian
immune system functions at steady state and during
infection using inbred mouse models. However, it has
become increasingly recognized that the mouse and human
immune systems differ in numerous important aspects1, thus
limiting the predictive value of studies in rodents for human
biology. Furthermore, the narrow host tropism of many important human-tropic pathogens precludes the use of conventional
mouse models for analyzing the interactions of such pathogens
with the mammalian immune system2. The direct study of
human immune responses is challenging as usually only peripheral blood, but not material from lymphoid organs or the site
of infection, is readily accessible. Immune responses to many
pathogens have been studied in patients, but interpreting such
clinical data is difficult as numerous parameters that could
influence measured immune response are often unknown. To
gain better control of these critical factors, immune responses to
live-attenuated vaccines, including yellow fever3, flu4, and
smallpox5, have been carefully characterized. These studies have
greatly contributed to our understanding of human immunity,
but intra- and inter-donor variability, previous and/or current
infections, age or microbiotic status still add significant complexity to the data and make analysis challenging.
Humanized mice have emerged as powerful tools for studying
a broad range of human(-tropic) pathogens. Mice engrafted with
components of a human hematolymphoid system or human
immune system (HIS) have been especially useful for dissecting
the interactions of human viruses with human immune cells6–10.
A variety of mouse strains (reviewed in ref. 11) well-suited for
engraftment of human hematolymphoid cells have been developed. These recipient strains are usually highly immunocompromised to facilitate engraftment of xenogeneic cells. Non-obese
diabetic (NOD) mice deficient for both the recombinase activating gene 1 (Rag1−/−) and the IL-2 receptor gamma chain
(IL2Rγnull) (NRG mice) are commonly used and do not develop
functional murine B, T, or natural killer (NK) cells12. NRG mice
are also deficient in hemolytic complement13 and harbor a
polymorphism in the gene encoding murine signal regulatory
protein α (SIRPα), which reduces phagocytic activity against
human cells14. Injection of irradiation-conditioned NRG mice
with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to de novo
hematopoiesis, resulting in stable engraftment of human hematolymphoid system components6,12,15.
Although there is evidence that the engrafted HIS in such mice
becomes activated upon microbial challenge, the quality of the
immune response in conventional models and in other refined
models (such as the bone marrow–liver–thymus, or BLT model)
remains weak or uncertain7,9,16–20. One of the major reasons is
the underrepresentation of critical human immune cell lineages in
these models, which are crucial for activating the adaptive
immune response. In particular, the scarcity of human dendritic
cells (DCs) as well as other myeloid lineages and NK cells,
decreases the functionality of the engrafted HIS. The small frequencies of these cell populations can be explained, in part, by the
limited biological cross-reactivity of the non-redundant cytokines
that promote lineage differentiation21. Consequently, several new
humanized mice models with significant reconstitution of myeloid and/or NK cell compartments have been recently developed
(hereon referred to as second-generation humanized mouse
models). Indeed, exogenous administration of human interleukin
(IL) 15 or an IL15/IL15 receptor (R) fusion protein significantly
increases human NK cell numbers22. Similarly, injection of
recombinant cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GMCSF), macrophage colony stimulating
factor (MCSF), IL3 or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3LG),
or their expression in engineered xenorecipient strains results in
increased frequencies of erythro-myeloid lineage cells15,23–25.
However, knowledge of how the human immune response in any
of these novel models compares to those observed in humans
remains limited.
To address this need, we devised an experimental pipeline
allowing us to quantitatively assess immunity in humanized mice
and compare to host responses in humans. By probing the cellular, humoral, and transcriptomic response to a highly immunogenic common standard, the yellow fever virus vaccine YFV17D26, we provide here the first comprehensive comparison of
the human immune response in conventional, second-generation
humanized mice and human vaccinees. Our results highlight that
selective expansion of myeloid and NK cells in humanized mice
induces transcriptomic responses to YFV-17D infection akin to
those of human vaccinees. The more human-like transcriptomic
responses, lacking in conventional models, correlated with the
development of antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity
to YFV-17D in humanized mice more robustly engrafted with
human NK and various myeloid cells. Altogether, our work
demonstrates a robust approach for the quantitative measurement of immunity in humanized mice, for more objective model
cross-comparison and consequently, for the rational development
of better pre-clinical humanized models.
Results
Conventional humanized mice mount limited immunity to
YFV-17D. YFV-17D is one of the most potent vaccines ever
developed, and single vaccination usually results in protection for
at least 10 years26. Existing data on the immune response to YFV17D in human vaccinees could thus serve as a valuable comparator to systematically assess the functionality of a transplanted
HIS. In contrast to the transient or even undetectable viremia
observed in human vaccinees3,5, YFV-17D RNA rapidly
reached a plateau and persisted in the blood of NRG-HIS mice for
at least 22 days, suggesting the engrafted HIS cannot effectively
clear infection (Fig. 1a) despite an absence of significant mortality
(Supplementary Figure 1a). In YFV-17D-infected conventional NRG-HIS mice, we noticed an overall increase in peripheral CD3+ T cells upon YFV-17D infection (Fig. 1b) without
any changes in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells (Supplementary
Figure 1b). In contrast to reports in patients, the frequencies of
human CD8+ T cells expressing HLA-DR and CD38—two
markers to track virus-activated cells within the bulk CD8+ T cell
population in the peripheral blood of human vaccinees5—did not
change in the blood (Fig. 1c) or spleen (Supplementary Figure 1c)
of these mice. Downregulation of CCR7 and CD45RA on a subset
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was detectable in the blood and
spleen of NRG-HIS mice upon YFV-17D infection (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Figure 1c), indicating that the engrafted HIS
responded to the infection. However, this activation did not
correlate with better control of viral replication in the periphery
(Fig. 1a). To enable tracking of antigen-specific T cells responses,
we infected humanized NRG mice expressing transgenically
HLA-A2*0201 (NRG-A2-HIS) and quantified YFV-specific CD8
+ T cells in the blood and spleen of NRG-A2-HIS mice using an
HLA-A2:YFV NS4B (amino acids 214–222, LLWNGPMAV)
tetramer3. Unlike previous studies characterizing virus-specific
CD8+ T cell responses to HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue virus,
or adenovirus9,17,19,27, we did not detect any A2:LLWNGPMAVspecific T cells in either the blood or spleen over the course of
infection, indicating that YFV-17D-specific cells are poorly
primed in NRG-A2-HIS mice (Supplementary Figure 1d). These
data indicate that while NRG-HIS mice have utility as a challenge
model6, they require further refinements to better model human
immune responses.

Next, we examined the expression of four genes (MDA5/IFIH1,
STAT1, IRF7, RSAD2), all reported to be upregulated in PBMCs
of human vaccinees following vaccination28, in the human
PBMCs of NRG-HIS mice following YFV-17D infection. Since
we expected the anti-viral response in NRG-HIS to be low, we
aimed at determining the cumulative median expression of these
four anti-viral genes by RT-qPCR using human-specific primers.
Our data revealed that the cumulative median expression of these
four genes significantly increased at day 11 post infection relative
to pre-infection levels (day 0) (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Figure 1e).
Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we then performed an
unbiased quantification of differentially expressed genes in
human PBMCs of NRG-HIS mice on day 11 post YFV-17D
infection. Notably, only four genes were significantly differentially
expressed (DE) (HSP90AA1, HIST1H4C, LRRFIP1, and UGDHAS1) (Fig. 2b–d; Supplementary Data 1), highlighting the limited
and variable transcriptomic response of human PBMCs in NRGHIS mice. Altogether, our results indicate that NRG-HIS develop
an extremely limited human immune response to YFV-17D.
Enhanced human myeloid and NK cell reconstitution in HIS
mice. Impaired immune function in conventional NRG-mice
(reviewed in ref.29) can likely be attributed in part to low frequencies of critical immune cell subsets, such as myeloid and NK
cells, compared to humans (Fig. 3a) where the myeloid compartment represents 50–80% of peripheral leukocytes. Since DCs
and NK cells are key effectors of the innate immune response and
critical in the activation of an adaptive response, we hypothesized
that selective expansion of these cell subsets in humanized mice
could promote an enhanced human immune response.
Receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3, or fetal liver kinase2 (Flk2), is a cell surface receptor broadly expressed on early
hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. Consequently,
myeloid cell development is severely impaired in Flk2-deficient
mice (Flk2−/−)30,31. However, in xenorecipient mouse strains
commonly used for human hematopoietic engraftment12,32–34,
murine myelopoiesis is largely unaffected. Thus, the majority of
myeloid cells are still of murine origin and putatively interfere with
priming of human-specific adaptive immune responses upon
infection with (human-tropic) pathogens.
Despite the recent generation of humanized mouse models
harboring a Flk2 deletion25,35, the influence of this on the human
immune response in humanized mice has not yet been described
nor directly compared to immunity in humans. Therefore, as a
proof-of-concept, we aimed to quantitatively evaluate the impact
of this enhancement on the cellular and transcriptomic response
to YFV-17D infection through cross-comparison with other
humanized mouse models and human clinical data.
We thus generated Flk2−/− mice on the NRG background,
yielding NRGF mice. While previous work relied on repeated
injections of recombinant Flt3LG24,25, we chose a vectored
delivery approach, constructing a replication-incompetent

adenoviral system for sustained and stable production of human
Flt3LG (AdV-Flt3LG) in HEK293T cells in vitro (Supplementary
Figure 2a) and NRG mice in vivo (Supplementary Figure 2b).
Following injection of NRG-HIS and NRGF-HIS mice with AdVFlt3LG (NRG-HIS/Flt3LG or NRGF-Flt3LG, respectively) or with
AdV-Fluc (NRG-HIS/Fluc or NRGF-HIS/Fluc, respectively)
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figure 2c, d), we observed a significant
expansion of CD33+ myeloid cells, CD33+ CD11c+ (conventional) DCs (cDCs), and CD123+ BDCA2+ plasmacytoid DCs
(pDCs) in the spleen and/or bone marrow of NRG-HIS/Flt3LG
mice (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figure 2e, f; Supplementary
Figure 3). Likewise, frequencies of CD56+ CD3− NK cells and
CD66+ granulocytes increased in the spleen and bone marrow of
NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figure 3).
Moreover, several cellular lineages commonly under-represented
in conventional humanized mice, including cDCs, monocytes,
macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells and CD3+ CD56+ T cells
(which include NK T cells and γδ T cells), were expanded in the
peripheral blood (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Figure 2g; Supplementary Figure 3). Some of these human lineages were also more
prevalent in NRG-HIS/Flt3LG mice than in NRG-HIS/Fluc mice
but with greater variability across cohorts (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Figure 2f, g; Supplementary Figure 3). Importantly, the
frequencies of various murine myeloid subsets, including cDC,
pDC, and monocytes, remained largely constant in the spleen and
bone marrow of NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice but were increased in
NRG-HIS/Fltl3LG mice (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Figure 2h;
Supplementary Figure 3), consistent with the fact that human
Flt3LG is biologically cross-reactive and stimulates murine
myeloid precursor cells36.

ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis37,38 of the transcriptomic profiles of our different mouse models (following
replicate analysis) showed that the total set of upregulated GO
terms of NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice was enriched for immunerelated GO terms (17% of total upregulated GO terms) in contrast
to NRG-HIS (0%) and NRGF-HIS/Fluc mice (5%) (Fig. 4d;
Supplementary Figure 5). In NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice, we identified upregulated GO terms related to IFN signaling, antigen
presentation, and cytokine production, consistent with previous
findings in humans28,39. Moreover, we observed an enrichment in
GO terms related to the regulation of B and T cell-mediated
immunity, providing additional evidence for a more comprehensive immune response to YFV17D in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG
mice. In contrast, 20% of the immune-related GO terms were
significantly downregulated in NRG-HIS mice, further underscoring the limited functionality of the HIS in this model. A
KEGG pathway40,41 enrichment analysis also confirmed the
ability of NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice to mount an enhanced transcriptional response. Among the top five upregulated KEGG
pathways identified in each mouse model, immune-related
pathways were only found in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice (Fig. 4e).
These pathways, related to antigen presentation and NK cell
activity, were consistent with our findings as well as with previous
ex vivo and in vivo human studies28,39,42,43.
Human-like transcriptomic responses in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG
mice. Two studies have previously delineated the transcriptomic
response to YFV-17D in human vaccinees28,44. Specifically, these
studies identified sets of genes differentially regulated in PBMCs
upon YFV vaccination. Hence, we utilized these valuable datasets
as a reference to quantitatively evaluate how similar transcriptomic responses were in our different humanized mouse
models in comparison to humans. We re-analyzed three datasets
(hereon referred to as the Lausanne, Montreal, and Emory
cohorts) derived from two independent studies28,44 and sorted
the list of differentially regulated genes (padj ≤ 0.1) at day 7 post
vaccination for each human cohort. From these three lists of
genes, we then generated a global human dataset of genes differentially expressed upon YFV-17D vaccination using two distinct methods: an unbiased method and a double selection
method, i.e., composed of genes found in at least one cohort, or in
at least two cohorts respectively. Using these two distinct human
reference datasets, we computed a Spearman rho correlation
index (see Methods for details) for each humanized mouse model
(NRG-HIS, NRGF-HIS/Fluc, and NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG; day 11 post
vaccination) relative to human vaccinees, at varying padj thresholds (from 0.01 to 0.1 with 0.01 increments) for differentially
expressed genes. Correlation indexes were referred to as rU and rD
for the unbiased and double selection method respectively (see
Methods for details), for a given padj threshold. We chose to use
the correlation index value derived from gene sets constructed
with an padj threshold of 0.05 as our definitive rU and rD
correlation indexes (referred to as rU,q=0.05 and rD,q=0.05; see
Methods for details). Independent of the method or padj threshold
used, NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG always displayed the highest correlation
index in comparison to the two other models (NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG
rU,q=0.05 = 0.075 and rD,q=0.05 = 0.157 Fig. 5; Supplementary
Table 1). When limiting the analysis to differentially expressed
genes at padj ≤ 0.01, the rU and rD correlation indexes of the three
mouse cohorts displayed the highest differences, with notably rD
for NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG reaching up to 0.188 (versus 0.0967 and
0.036 for NRG-HIS and NRGF-HIS/Fluc, respectively). Altogether, this analysis demonstrates the superiority of our NRGFHIS/Flt3LG mice over conventional humanized mice for modeling the human transcriptomic response to YFV-17D infection.
Moreover, our approach provides a valuable and relevant methodology for an accurate and objective scoring of human immunity in humanized mouse models.
Increased control of viral infection in NRGF-HIS/Flt3L mice.
Next, we assessed how increased correlation index between
human vaccinees and NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice related to viral
control (Fig. 6a). While YFV-17D vaccinees are briefly viremic
after vaccination3,5,44,45, conventional NRG-HIS mice fail to clear
the infection (Fig. 1a). Although viremia persisted in NRG-HIS/
Flt3LG mice similarly to NRG-HIS mice, viremia in NRGF-HIS/
Flt3L mice did not statistically differ from the baseline RNA copy
number over time (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Figure 6a). This
enhanced control of viral infection correlated with a better survival rate of NRGF-HIS mice (75% versus 50% in NRG-HIS mice
survival) over the course of infection (Supplementary Figure 6b).
Of note, the observed mortality among the NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG
mice cohort (2 out of 8 mice) was not due to lower Flt3LG
expression (Supplementary Figure 6c). Five out of the six surviving NRG-HIS/Flt3LG mice, but none of the NRGF-HIS/Flt3L
mice, developed significant graft versus host disease (GVHD) by
day 20 following infection (Supplementary Figure 6b), which was
likely due to the priming of allogeneic T cell responses by the
Flt3LG-expanded murine DCs activated by YFV-17D.
The pro-inflammatory cytokine CXCL10 (or IP-10) is one of
the most significantly induced cytokines following YFV-17D
infection in humans28,46. Consistent with these observations, IP10 serum levels did increase in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice following
infection (Fig. 6c). Several other pro-inflammatory cytokines,
including MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-18, were also elevated in NRGHIS/Flt3LG versus NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice at specific time
points (Supplementary Figure 6d). As these increased cytokine
levels did not correlate with an enhanced human immune
response in the NRG-HIS/Flt3LG mice, they likely reflected the
severe GVHD conditions in NRG-HIS/Flt3LG. Other cytokines,
such as IFNγ, IL-23, and GM-CSF, were detected at similar levels
in both mouse models (Supplementary Figure 6e).
Although an increase in peripheral CD3+ T cells was observed
in both NRG-HIS/Flt3LG and NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice,

frequencies of CD8+T cells increased in the periphery of only the
latter over time (Supplementary Figure 7a, b). These CD8+
T cells upregulated HLA-DR+ and CD38+ T cells, as previously
reported in human vaccinees5 (Fig. 6d). This distinct phenotypic
change of CD8+ T cells and enhanced control of peripheral viral
replication in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice also correlated with higher
frequencies of multiple myeloid and NK cell subsets in different
tissues (Supplementary Figure 7c–e).
YFV-specific immunity in HLA-expressing NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG
mice. Since NRGF-HS/Flt3LG mice did control YFV-17D
infection, we analyzed the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response to
ascertain its similarity to that of human vaccinees3,5. We intercrossed NRG-A2 mice with NRGF mice, yielding NRGF mice
expressing HLA-A2*0201 (NFA2 mice). NFA2-HIS mice were
then injected with either Adv-Fluc or Adv-Flt3LG 5 days prior to
YFV-17D infection (Fig. 7a). Consistent with our previous findings in NRG-HIS/Flt3LG and NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice (Fig. 6b),
viral replication was better controlled in NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice
compared to NFA2-HIS/Fluc mice over time (Fig. 7b). Serum
viremia in NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice peaked between days 5 and 10
post infection with the infection ultimately cleared by day 20
(Fig. 7b). These kinetics mimic those observed in human

Fig. 5 Human-like transcriptomic response to YFV-17D infection in NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG. Differentially expressed genes from PBMCs of three YFV-17D human
vaccinee cohorts (Lausanne, n = 11; Montreal, n = 15; Emory, n = 25) were used to generate two global human transcriptomic datasets: an unbiased dataset
(all differentially expressed genes (padj ≤ 0.1) found in at least one cohort) and an double-selection dataset (all differentially expressed genes (padj ≤ 0.1)
found in at least two cohorts). For a given human global dataset (unbiased, left; double selection, right) and padj threshold (starting at padj ≤ 0.1 with 0.01
increment), the Spearman rho correlation index was computed for each humanized mouse model transcriptomic dataset (NRG-HIS, NRGF-HIS/Fluc, and
NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG) and plotted as function of the padj threshold. The Spearman rho correlation index for the unbiased and double selection method are
respectively referred as rU and rD. The definitive correlation indexes for the unbiased and double selection method, referred as rU and rD at padj = 0.05 (rU,
q=0.05 and rD,q=0.05) respectively, are indicated on each graph and for each humanized mouse model. See Methods for more details

vaccinees with detectable viremia3,5,47. Lower viremia correlated
with better survival of the NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice (75% versus
30%) over the 3 weeks of infection (Supplementary Figure 8a).
Neither cohort developed GVHD. We also found no correlation
between survival and differential human Flt3LG concentration in
the serum of surviving versus non-surviving NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG
mice (Supplementary Figure 8b).
YFV NS4B-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells were readily detectable in
the blood of infected NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice but not NFA2-HIS/
Fluc mice (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Figure 8c). Viremia and the
frequencies of YFV-specific CD8+ T cells followed similar
kinetics in the peripheral blood, suggesting an important role
for CD8+ T cells in YFV-17D infection control and clearance as
previously demonstrated in human vaccinees47. Consistent with
previously reported YFV-specific CD8+ T cell phenotypes from
human vaccines3, a significant fraction of YFV NS4B-tetramer+
CD8+ T cells proliferated, as indicated by their Ki67 expression,
and acquired an HLA-DR+/CD38+ effector phenotype
(Supplementary Figure 8d, e). In contrast, NS4B-tetramer
negative CD8+ T cells did not demonstrate upregulated Ki-67
expression upon YFV-17D infection (Supplementary Figure 8f).
Although the frequency of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
statistically decreased to background levels in the blood of
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, YFV-specific CD8+ T cells were
readily detectable in the spleen by day 20 post infection but
were not detectable in the spleen of NFA2-HIS/Fluc mice
(Fig. 7d, Supplementary Figure 8g). Absolute cell count and
phenotyping of splenic YFV-specific CD8+ T cells showed that
these cells mostly expressed HLA-DR and CD38 at day 20 post
infection (Supplementary Figure 8g–i). They also did not show
preferential expression of Ki67, suggesting a switch toward a
memory phenotype. Future studies will be aimed at accurately
delineating the different phenotypes of these antigen-specific
cells.
Given the important correlation between the induction of a T
cell-specific response and the clearance of YFV-17D infection in
the periphery, we conducted a T cell depletion experiment. Prior
to YFV-17D infection and 5 days post infection, NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG mice were treated with anti-CD4 (α-CD4) or anti-CD8
(α-CD8) antibodies (n = 4 per group), which have previously
been used to deplete CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, in
humanized mice7,9 (Supplementary Figure 9a). Peripheral CD4+
and CD8+ T cells were efficiently depleted in α-CD4 and α-CD8-
treated NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 9b), prior to infection. In the spleen, where T cells are
more abundant than in the peripheral blood, we observed a more
than ten-fold reduction in the number of CD4+ T cells in αCD4-treated mice and a more than 1000-fold reduction in the
number of CD8+ T cells in α-CD8-treated mice (Supplementary
Figure 9c). Importantly, the counts of myeloid cell populations
were unaffected in either condition (Supplementary Figure 9d).
Upon T cell depletion, only α-CD8-treated mice exhibited
significant mortality upon infection (50% survival) (Supplementary Figure 9e). However, both α-CD4-treated and α-CD8-treated
mice were unable to clear viral infection in the periphery
(Supplementary Figure 9f). Thus, these results suggest that both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important for controlling infection
in peripheral blood and that CD8+ T cells are likely early
regulators of such control. Additionally, these results are further
evidence that the clearance of YFV-17D infection in NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG mice is human-, and not murine-, mediated.
Seroconversion in human vaccinees is the hallmark of YFV17D potent immunogenicity48. Hence, determined whether the
enhanced control of infection and T cell-specific response were
also associated with an improved humoral immune response. We
assessed YFV-specific antibody concentrations in the sera of
NFA2-HIS/Fluc (n = 4) and NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG (n = 4) mice over
6-weeks following infection. We detected a significant increase in

YFV-specific IgM and IgG in the serum of the four NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG mice at day 40 post infection (Fig. 7e, f; Supplementary
Figure 10a). In contrast, YFV-specific antibodies were not
detected in the serum of NFA2-HIS/Fluc mice during the first
30 days following infection, and none of these mice survived till
the final experimental end-point (day 40 post infection). Notably,
we found a strong negative correlation between viremia level and
YFV-specific IgG concentration in the blood of NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG mice but not in NFA2-HIS/Fluc mice (Fig. 7g, h).
Consistently, the serum of three NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice at day
40 post infection neutralized YFV-17D in vitro (median
neutralizing titer: 1:33) (Fig. 7i). NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice also
displayed a significantly enhanced frequency of multiple B cell
subpopulations at day 20 post infection in comparison to NFA2-
HIS/Fluc mice (Supplementary Figure 10b, c). Specifically,
frequencies of follicular B cells, transitional B cells, classswitched memory B cells, or plasmablasts were higher in
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, suggesting these subpopulations proliferate and differentiate better in response to YFV-17D infection
in this model.
Enhanced YFV-17D immunity associates with superior HIS
complexity. Finally, we employed Seq-Well49, a recently developed platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq
(scRNA-Seq), to delineate at the greatest possible resolution the
cellular composition of the engrafted HIS that correlated with a
superior human immune response to YFV-17D. We isolated
splenocytes from two NRG-HIS mice and two NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG
mice at 6-weeks post YFV-17D infection and sorted these cells by
human CD45 (hCD45) or human CD33 (hCD33) expression (see
also Supplementary Note 1).
We ran parallel Seq-Well arrays for each sorted population,
enabling both unbiased characterization of the relative abundances of all lymphocytes, as well as a deeper examination of the
cellular diversity within the myeloid compartment. First, we
examined the cell types identified in hCD45+single cells in
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG (Fig. 8a) compared to NRG-HIS (Fig. 8b)
mice. NFA2-HIS/Fl3LG splenic CD45+ cells showed a higher
diversity of well-resolved subpopulations of activated and
differentiated cytotoxic lymphocytes, T cells expressing known
activation and memory markers (CD27, CCR7, STAT1, CD40LG),
and regulatory T cells (distinguished by high expression of
FOXP3 and CTLA4). The abundance of myeloid and NK cells
within the hCD45+ samples was significantly higher in NFA2-
HIS/Flt3LG mice, and we were unable to resolve a distinct cluster
of myeloid cells from the NRG-HIS populations when clustered
alone.
To compare more directly the myeloid compartments between
the NRG-HIS mice and the NFA2-HIS mice, we combined both
hCD33+ and hCD45+ samples from either the NFA2-HIS mice
(Fig. 8c) or NRG-HIS mice (Fig. 8d) and computationally gated
out all T cells and B cells by expression of TCR- or BCR-related
genes (full list in Methods section). In NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice,
we identified six distinct clusters of cell types corresponding to
subpopulations of NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, cDCs,
pDCs, and cross-presenting DCs (full cluster-defining genes in
Supplementary Data 2). We also directly compared the expression of the top subpopulation-defining genes in NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG non-T, non-B single cells (Fig. 8e) with the corresponding
single cell gate in NRG-HIS mice (Fig. 8f). This analysis
revealed significant up-regulation of a broad range of myeloid
and NK cell functional and activation markers (such as HLADRA, CD83, and CD40 for cDCs, and CCL5, GNLY, GZMA,
PRF1, and CD226 for NK cells) in NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice over
NRG-HIS mice.
When analyzed alone, hCD45+ NRG-HIS single cells did not
yield a distinct subpopulation that could be annotated as a
myeloid type cluster. However, when these cells were clustered in
concert with abundant myeloid cell types from the NFA2-HIS
mice, we could resolve these cells distinctly. Through this
analysis, we confirmed superior frequencies of DCs, NK cells
and NKT cells in NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice in comparison to
NRG-HIS mice (Fig. 9a, b).
Finally, we tested differential expression between hCD45+
single cells in both mouse models over a curated list of lineage
and cell-type relevant genes (Fig. 9c, d). This analysis revealed
significantly higher expression of functional markers of activated
NK and T cells (such as NKG7, PRF1, and GZMA), as well as
higher abundance of functional mature myeloid cells (notably via
ITGAM, ITGAX, CD14, or CD83) in NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice.
Altogether, these data provide an in-depth view of the cellular
composition of the HIS in conventional and second-generation
humanized mice. They also highlight the enhanced engraftment
and functionality of the myeloid and NK cell compartment in
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, which is likely critical in promoting an
enhanced transcriptomic, cellular, and humoral response to YFV17D. A more complete description of our experimental design
and our scRNA-seq data can be found in Supplementary Note 1,
associated with Supplementary Figure 10d, Supplementary
Figure 11, Supplementary Figure 12, and Supplementary Data 3.
Discussion
Understanding the pathogenesis and immune responses elicited
by human-tropic pathogens presents considerable challenges.
Over the past decades, humanized mice have proven susceptible
to a large number of human-tropic pathogens6,8,17,27,50,51 and
have emerged as valuable platforms to model human-specific
infectious processes in vivo. Despite the fact that multiple studies
have reported that humanized mice can develop immunological
features resembling those of humans, commonly used humanized
mouse models still mount an imperfect human immune
response7,9,16,52, and it remains incompletely defined how specific
refinements of xenorecipient strains and/or humanization protocols impact immunity. To guide a more directed approach to
improving future generations of humanized mice, objective
metrics are needed to facilitate direct comparisons with clinical
data. YFV-17D is a highly potent human vaccine that induces a
strong, polyfunctional immune response3,28,44 as well as longlasting protective immunity (reviewed in ref. 26). The human
immune response to YFV-17D has been intensively studied in the
peripheral blood of human vaccinees3,5,28,44, and transcriptomic
signatures in human PBMCs following YFV-17D immunogenicity have been delineated28,44. These features highlight YFV-17D
human immunity as a powerful comparator for evaluating
immune responses in humanized mice.
Here, we provide a comprehensive and quantitative comparison of human clinical data with equivalent data sets from conventional and exemplary second-generation humanized mouse
models. By probing the specific cellular, humoral, and transcriptomic response to YFV-17D in different humanized mouse
models, we examined how a correlation index, built to reflect the
degree of overlap between the transcriptome of a given humanized mouse model and that of human vaccinees upon YFV-17D
infection, associated with the induction of YFV-specific immunity
and viral clearance within a given model.
Despite high levels of human engraftment, the human immune
response to YFV-17D in NRG-HIS mice was weak and associated
with a low correlation index. In contrast, enhancement of the NK
and myeloid cell compartments in NRGF-HIS associated with a
significantly higher correlation index in comparison to

conventional humanized mice, which translated into the induction of a specific cellular and humoral response against YFV-17D.
Hence, our study shows that the transcriptomic correlation index
represents a powerful and accurate proxy for assessing the quality
of the human immune response in these—and importantly, other
—models.
Numerous alternative humanization strategies have been realized in e.g., so-called BLT or MISTRG models17,23. The experimental pipeline and data sets provided here will undoubtedly be a
valuable resource to objectively evaluate these strategies in comparison to others, as well as for the rational development of
advanced humanized mice models and improved modeling of
human disease in vivo. Refinement strategies could include the
expression of additional human orthologs of non-redundant
cytokines, which exhibit limited biological cross-reactivity in
order to foster development of other underrepresented human
immune cell types. Currently, most studies employ naive, i.e.,
antigen-inexperienced, mice, which does not take into account
how immunological history shapes immunity. Thus, exposing
mice to multiple other vaccines prior to yellow fever vaccination
or infection with another pathogen may be a valuable approach to
further enhance immunity. Co-engraftment of NFA2 or other
xenorecipient strains with additional HSC donor-matched human
tissues, such as liver, thymus, and/or lymph nodes, could also
significantly augment the immune response. Such coengraftments could enhance T and B cell selection, intrahepatic T cell priming53 as well as liver-mediated secretion of
key human-immune components54. Finally, engraftment of
second-generation humanized mice with a human-like microbiome represents another valuable approach to enhance immunity as recently suggested55.
Taken together, our study demonstrates that correlation of
transcriptomic signatures provide a relevant and valuable path
toward the rational refinement of humanized mouse models.
Such an approach opens avenues for more accurate characterization of human–pathogen interaction events in vivo, for the
development of innovative immunotherapy and vaccine strategies, as well as for the modeling of relevant (patho-) physiological
processes and auto-immune diseases.

Adenovirus constructs. Adenoviral constructs encoding for the firefly luciferase
(Fluc) or Flt3LG were created using the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, Fluc and human Flt3LG cDNA coding sequence were cloned following
restriction digest (KpnI-XhoI and KpnI-EcorV, respectively) into pShuttle TREpAdEasy, leading pShuttle TRE-pAdEasy-Fluc and pShuttle TRE-pAdEasy-Flt3LG,
respectively. Recombinant pShuttle-CMV plasmids were linearized with PmeI and
ligated to pAdEasy by homologous recombination followed by electroporation into
BJ5183 cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Recombinant pShuttlepAdEasy constructs were identified by PacI restriction analysis. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Generation of recombinant adenoviruses. Adenoviral stocks were generated as
previously described56. Briefly, adenoviral constructs were transfected into HEK293
cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using the calciumphosphate method. Transfected cultures were maintained until cells exhibited full
cytopathic effect (CPE), then harvested and freeze-thawed. Supernatants were
serially passaged two more times with harvest at full CPE and freeze thaw was then
performed. For virus purification, cell pellets were resuspended in 0.01 M sodium
phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and lysed in 5% sodium-deoxycholate, followed by DNase
I digestion. Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant was layered onto a
1.2–1.46 g ml−1 CsCl gradient, then spun at 95,389g on a Beckman Optima 100KUltra centrifuge using an SW28 spinning-bucket rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA). Adenovirus bands were isolated and further purified on a second CsCl
gradient using an SW41Ti spinning-bucket rotor. Resulting purified adenoviral
bands were isolated using a 18.5G needle and twice-dialysed against 4% sucrose.
Adenovirus concentrations were measured by reading the OD260 on a FLUOstar
Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Adenovirus stocks were
aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.
Isolation of human CD34+ HSC. All experiments were performed with authorization from the Institutional Review Board and the IACUC at Princeton University. Human fetal livers (16–22 weeks of gestational age) were procured from
Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), Inc. (Alameda, CA). Fetal liver was
homogenized and incubated in digestion medium (HBSS) with 0.1% collagenase IV
(Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), 40 mM HEPES, 2 M CaCl2, and 2 U/ml
DNAse I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 30 min at 37 °C. Human CD34+ HSC
were isolated using a CD34+ HSC isolation kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer’ protocol.
Purification of human CD34+ cells were assessed by quantifying by flow cytometry
using an anti-human CD34+-FITC antibody (dilution 1/100, clone 581, BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Expression of human CD90, CD38, CD45RA was
assessed among the CD34+ population.
Construction of NRGF and NFA2 mice. NRG-Flk2−/− mice were generated by
backcrossing mice harboring a Flk2 null allele (Flt3tm1Irl, kindly provided by Ihor
Lemishka, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY) for 10 generations to NOD Rag1−/−
IL2Rgnull mice (NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1MomIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory, catalog number 007799). At each generation, the presence of each mutant
allele was confirmed with allele-specific primers. Resultant NRG-Flk2+/− were
intercrossed to produce NRG-Flk2−/− mice. NRG-HLA-A2*0201 were generated by
intercrossing NSG-A2*0201 (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgtmlWjl/Sz Tg(HLA-A2.1)1Eng/
Sz)7,9 with NRG mice. The absence of the SCID mutation and the presence of the
Rag1, IL2Rγ null alleles and the A2 transgene was determined by PCR. To generated
NRG-Flk2−/− HLA-A*0201 (NFA2) mice, NRGF and NRG-A2 mice were intercrossed. NRG, NRG-A2, NRGF, and NFA2 mice were maintained at the Laboratory
Animal Resource Center at Princeton University.
All animal experiments described in this study were performed in accordance
with protocols (number 1930) that were reviewed and approved by the Institutional

were injected intrahepatically 4–6 h after irradiation. Male and female mice
transplanted with CD34+ HSC derived from various human donors were used in
this study.
Mouse injections and blood collections. 4–8-month-old NRG-HIS, NRGF-HIS,
and NFA2-HIS were infected through intravenous injection in the tail with 1010
recombinant AdV-Flt3LG or 1011 recombinant AdV-Fluc particles and/or with 106
YFV-17D p.f.u., resuspended in 200 µl of PBS. For experiments involving preinjection of AdV-Fluc or AdV-Flt3LG prior YFV-17D infection, YFV-17D infection was always performed 5 days following AdV-injection. 200 µl of blood were
collected through submandibular bleeding at the indicated time-points. Serum was
separated from blood cells by centrifugation (10 min, 3500 rpm at room temperature) for further quantification of serum viremia. For assessment of immune
cell expansion and time course experiments, all the infected humanized
mice displayed a level of peripheral humanization ranging from 40 to 60% human
CD45+ out of total CD45+ cells. For assessment of the YFV-17D transcriptomic
signature, all humanized mice displayed level of peripheral humanization ranging
from 50 to 80% human CD45+ out of total CD45+ cells.
Monitoring of clinical symptoms and manifestations. Clinical manifestations of
disease were monitored daily and signs of clinical disease progression recorded
through weight and clinical scoring. All mice succumbing to YFV-17D infection
developed severe weight loss and displayed several signs of disease such as posture
hunched, trembling, appearance with ruffled fur and rear leg paralysis (at later
stage of disease). GVHD was determined by the presence of the following clinical
symptoms: severe hair loss on a significant portion of the body (with visible naked
skin), skin rash, and skin inflammation.
Quantification of human FLT3LG concentration in mouse serum. Human
Flt3LG concentrations were measured using an in-house sandwich ELISA. A rabbit
polyclonal capture (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibody was coated overnight
into a 96 well-plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a concentration of
1:500. Following incubation with a blocking-buffer (SuperBlock™ Blocking Buffer;
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), mouse serums were incubated at multiple
dilution (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000). Captured human Flt3LG was then detected using a
biotin-conjugated rabbit polyclonal detection antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA) and a streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibody. A soluble recombinant human Flt3LG (initial concentration: 100 ng/ml) was used to determine a standard concentration curve.
Optical density signals at 450 nm were then assessed using a TriStar Multimode
Microplate reader (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad,
Germany).
Quantification of YFV-specific antibodies in mouse serum. Relative concentration of human YFV-17D-specific IgM and IgG was measured by homemade
sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). 5000 YFV-17D infectious particles were coated overnight in a 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Following incubation with a blocking-buffer (SuperBlock™
Blocking Buffer; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), mouse serums were
incubated at 1:20 and 1:40 dilution. A serum sample from an anonymous human
vaccinee was diluted from 1:10 to 1:160 in a two-fold dilution manner, and used as
a positive control. Captured IgG and IgM were then detected using anti-human
IgG (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Clone HP6017) or IgM (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Clone HP6083) horse peroxidase antibodies.

Optical density signals at 450 nm were then assessed using a TriStar Multimode
Microplate reader (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad,
Germany).
YFV-17D infectious clone and in vitro transcription. pACNR-YFV-17D lowcopy number backbone (kindly provided by Charles Rice, The Rockefeller University, NY) was transformed and amplified using low recombination NEB 5-alpha
high efficiency competent Escherichia coli (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA). Transformed bacteria were incubated in LB+ 50 μg/ml Ampicillin (SigmaAldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) overnight at 30 °C under shaking at 205 rpm.
Plasmid cDNA was purified using E.Z.N.A. Endonuclease free Maxiprep Kit
(Omega, Norcross, GA, USA), ethanol precipitated and linearized using Afl-II
restriction enzyme. Following concentration of linearized DNA by ethanol precipitation, viral RNA was transcribed from 1 µg of linear template using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Electroporation and production of YFV-17D stocks. Huh-7.5 cells were washed
twice with Opti-MEM Gluta-Max-1 reduced serum media (Life Technologies,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and resuspended at a concentration of 1.5 × 107
cells/ml in Opti-MEM. 2 µg of viral RNA was mixed with 0.4 ml of cell suspension
and immediately pulsed in a 2 mm cuvette using a BTX ElectroSquare Porator
ECM 830 (860 V, 99 µs, five pulses) (BTX, Holliston, MA, USA). Electroporated
cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and series of 3 consecutive
electroporations (for a total 6 µg for 1.8 × 107 cells) were then dripped into 25 ml
(P150 culture dish) of media. At 24 h post electroporation, media was changed and
replaced by low-serum concentration DMEM (1% FBS). Virus was collected at 48
and 72 h post electroporation. At 72 h post electroporation, virus was polled and
concentrated 40–100-fold using a Millipore 10,000 MWCO spin filter columns
(Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) on the last day of collection (3000g, 20
min). Viral titer was then assessed using a plaque forming unit assay.
Titration of viral stocks and YFV-17D in vitro infections. To determine the viral
titer of the YFV-17D stock, 2.5 × 105 Huh7.5 cells were seeded per well in 6-well
plates 24 h post infection. Serial dilution from 10−3 to 10−12 of the viral stocks
were prepared, and 2 ml of each dilution were incubated with Huh7.5 for 6 h at
37 °C. At 6 h post infection, media were replaced by a fresh methocell solution
(DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% Methylcellulose). Four days post infection, cells were
washed with PBS, fixed with 100% ethanol for 25 min and stained with 0.1% (w/
vol) crystal violet. The number of plaques (plaque forming unit, p.f.u.) for each
dilution was then determined.
Organ collection and isolation of immune cells. Blood (200 µl) was collected
through submandibular bleeding and transferred into EDTA capillary collection
tubes (Microvette 600 K3E, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Cells were separated
from plasma through centrifugation, and red blood cells were lysed with 1× lysis
buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. Following lysis and quenching with 10% (v/v) FBS DMEM
media, blood cells were then washed twice with a 1% (v/v) FBS–PBS solution before
staining. At the indicated endpoints, mice were euthanized via exsanguination
under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. To generate splenocyte single cell suspensions,
spleens were collected and individually placed in 15 ml of serum-free DMEM.
Spleens were then transferred in a 6 cm dish, dissociated using a razor blade and
digested (0.1% collagenase, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany; 40 mM HEPES;
2 mM CaCl2; 2 U/ml DNase1, HBSS, Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following quenching with 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM media,
splenocytes were strained through a 100 µm cell strainer and washed with 10%
(v/v) FBS-DMEM twice. Splenocytes were then centrifuged and lysed with 1× lysis
buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed twice with a 1% (v/v) FBS–PBS
solution and counted prior to staining. For bone marrow-derived cell isolation,
femurs and tibiae of the mice were flushed with PBS (Life Technologies, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a 10 cm dish. Cells were then centrifuged and lysed with 1×
lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 10 min at
room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed twice with a 1% (v/v)
FBS–PBS solution and counted prior to staining.
YFV-17D single-step RT-quantitative real time PCR. Viral RNA was isolated
from mouse serum using the ZR Viral RNA Kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was quantified using singlestep RT-quantitative real-time PCR (SuperScript® III Platinum® One-Step qRTPCR Kit, Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with primers and
TaqMan probes targeting a conserved region of the 5′UTR of the 17D genome.
Single-step RT-qPCR was accomplished in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) using the following thermal cycling: 52 °C for 15 min,
denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s,
annealing at 55 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 20 s. A cDNA sequence
coding for the 5′UTR was in vitro transcribed and used as standard for the absolute
quantification of viral RNA. The primers used are as follow: YFV-17D sense 1,
GCTAATTGAGGTGCATTGGTCTGC; YFV-17D sense 2, GCTAATTGAGG
TGTATTGGTCTGC; YFV-17D antisense 1, CTGCTAATCGCTCAACGAACG;
YFV-17D antisense 2, CTGCTAATCGCTCAAAGAACG, YFV-17D probe, FAMATCGAGTTGCTAGGCAATAAACAC-BHQ.
Antibody staining and flow-cytometry analysis. 2–4 × 106 PBMCs, splenocytes,
or bone marrow cells of human or murine origins were isolated as described above
and stained for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark with the appropriate antibody cocktail.
Following washing (1% (v/v) FBS in PBS), cells were fixed with fixation buffer (1%
(v/v) FBS, 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Flowcytometric
analysis was performed using an LSRII Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar,
Ashland, OR). Chimerism of all humanized mice model was assessed prior each
experiment by quantifying the following human populations: Human CD45+,
human CD45+ murine CD45−; T-cells, CD45+ CD3+; CD4+ T cells, CD45+
CD3+ CD4+; CD8+ T cells, CD45+ CD3+ CD8+; CD45+ CD16+ leukocytes;

CD14+; Macrophages, CD45+ CD3− CD19− (CD56−) CD68+.
For B-cell phenotyping, human bone marrow-derived CD19+ were analyzed
for their expression of CD20, CD24, CD38, CD27, CD138, IgD, IgG and IgM. Subpopulations were qualified as follow: naive B-cells, CD19+ IgD+ CD27−; nonclassed switched memory B-cells (NCS memB), CD19+ IgD+ CD27+; Classswitched memory B-cells (CS memB), CD19+ IgD− CD27+ CD20+ IgM−;

Flow cytometry fluorophor compensation for antibodies was performed using
AbC™ Anti-Mouse Bead Kit (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Foster City, CA, USA).
Counting beads were added to each sample prior flow-cytometry analysis
(AccuCheck Counting Beads, Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Foster City, CA, USA).
Detection and characterization of YFV-specific CD8+ T cells. PBMCs and
splenocytes were isolated and purified as described above. 2–4 × 106 PBMCs or
splenocytes were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a purified
recombinant Fc protein (Human BD Fc blockTM; BD Biosciences San Jose, CA,
USA; 1/10 dilution) in order to prevent tetramer non-specific binding to Fc
receptor. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a HLAA*02:01 APC-conjugated tetramer (MBL International, Woburn, MA, USA; 1/10
dilution) specific for the NS4B 214–222 derived epitope (LLWNGPMAV)44. Cells
were then incubated with the appropriate antibody cocktail optimized for CD8+
T-cell phenotyping and fixed as described above. Flow cytometry fluorophore
compensation were performed as described above. Counting beads were added to
each sample prior flow-cytometry analysis (AccuCheck Counting Beads, Life
Technologies, Invitrogen, Foster City, CA, USA) and were used to determine the
absolute number of YFV-specific CD8+ T cell (also referred NS4B/A2+ CD8+
T cells) per 100 µl of blood. Absolute count of splenic YFV-17D-specific CD8+
T cells were determined by reporting the number of total splenocytes and YFV17D-specific CD8+ T cells processed by flow cytometry with the total count of
splenocytes determined following tissue digestion. Number of events collected per
mouse and for a given tissue to determine the absolute count of YFV-17D-specific
CD8+ T cells ranged from 5 to 10 and from 100 to 700, in the blood and spleen,
respectively. YFV-17D-specific CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry for
the expression of HLA-DR, CD38, and Ki-67.
T cell depletion experiment. NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG were injected with 100 µg of antiCD4 or anti-CD8α (clone OKT-4 and OKT-8 respectively, BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH, USA) or not. Injections of 100 µg of antibody per mouse (intraperitoneal
route) were performed for three consecutive days prior YFV-17D infection and
three days post Adv-Flt3LG injection. A fourth antibody injection was performed
5 days post YFV-17D infection. At the day of infection, effective T-cell depletion
was verified in the blood of animals by flow cytometry using antibodies targeting
the following marker: human CD45+, mouse CD45+, human CD3+, human

CD4+, and human CD8+. Weight and survival of the animals were monitored
over a 20-day course of infection. Animals who survived the course of infection
were sacrificed at day 20 post infection, and serum was collected to determine
presence or absence of viral infection clearance in periphery. At the time of
sacrifice, T cell count was determined in the blood and spleen of animals to control
T cell depletion in mice treated with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8α. Additionally, the
absolute counts of several myeloid cell populations (human cDCs, pDCs, monocytes, macrophages) and NK cells in the spleen were determined to ensure the
specificity of the T-cell depletion.
Cytokine quantification. Cytokine quantification was realized using the
LEGENDplexTM multi-analyte flow assay kit (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA).
Sera from humanized mice were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
customized pre-mixed beads and detection antibodies specific for a panel of 13
human cytokines (IL-23, IL-12, IFNγ, TNFα, MCP-1, IL1β, IP-10, IL6, IFNβ, GMCSF, IFNα2, IL18, IL33). Samples were then incubated for 30 min with SA-PE
(Biolegend), wash and resulting fluorescent signals were analyzed on a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Analyte
concentration was determined using LEGENDplexTM software (Biolegend, San
Diego, CA, USA).
Bioluminescence imaging. NRG-HIS or NRGF-HIS were injected with 1011 AdVFluc particles. Ten days after injection, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and
injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 mg luciferin (Caliper Lifesciences, Waltham,
MA, USA). Bioluminescence was quantified using an IVIS Lumina II platform
(Caliper Lifesciences, Waltham, MA, USA).
Isolation of human CD45+ and RNA extraction. To isolate human CD45+ cells,
humanized mice were bled prior and following infection and total blood were
collected. Cells were centrifuged and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells
were then washed, counted, and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml
in a 2% (v/v) FBS–1 mM EDTA-PBS solution. Human CD45+ cells were then
isolated using a human CD45+ cells enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Purification of human CD45+ cells was assessed by quantifying by flow cytometry
human and murine CD45+ frequencies prior and after purification. Following
enrichment, human CD45+ were spined and resuspended in RLT lysis buffer
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cellular RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. For the
transcriptomic experiments, mice were assembled as cohorts of 4–5 animals displaying humanization levels ranging between 50 and 80%. Following lysis and prior
to cell resuspension in a 2% FBS–1 mM EDTA-PBS solution, blood samples of
members of each cohort were pooled together, leading to one sample per cohort
and time point (day 0 and day 11). Cohorts were assembled so the average
humanization across cohorts differed only by ±5% between cohorts.
Gene expression quantification by one-step RT-qPCR. Following cellular RNA
isolation from human CD45+ cells (as described above), human MDA-5, STAT1,
MX1, IRF7 and RSAD2 expression were quantified by one-step RT-qPCR using an
iTaq Universal SYBR One-step kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Expression was
then normalized to the expression of human GAPDH. Primer sequences are as
follows: MDA-5 sense, ACCAAATACAGGAGCCATGC; MDA-5 antisense,
ACACGTTCTTTGCGATTTCC; STAT1 sense, TGGGTTTGACAAGGTTCTT;
STAT1 antisense, TATGCAGTGCCACGGAAAG; MX1 sense, GTTTCCGAA

YFV-17D neutralization assay using mouse serum. Sera isolated from NFA2-
NRGF-HIS/Flt3LG mice and identified by ELISA as containing YFV-specific
antibodies following YFV-17D infection were employed for a neutralization assay.
For each mouse, sera isolated prior (day 0) and after infection (day 40) were diluted
at 1:20 and 1:40 in media containing YFV-17D viral particles (produced as
described above). The number of viral particles per condition was determined as to
reach a final m.o.i of 0.004 (200 p.f.u.). Viral particles and serum mixtures were
incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and mixtures were used to infect naive
Huh7.5 cells. As controls, we infected cells with cell culture media containing YFV17D particles but no serum (also pre-incubated for 1 h at room temperature), or
with media containing no viral particles and no serum. At 6 h post infection, media
were replaced by a fresh methocell solution (DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (w/v)
Methylcellulose). Four days post infection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with
100% (v/v) ethanol for 25 min and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet. The
percentage of infection inhibition was determined by counting and comparing the
number of infectious plaques between the pre-infection serum and the postinfection serum condition, for each mouse and each given dilution.
cDNA library generation and RNA-sequencing. The poly-A-containing RNA
transcripts in the humanized mice total RNA samples were converted to cDNA and
amplified following the Smart-seq2 method57. Sequencing libraries were made
from the amplified cDNA samples using the Nextera kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA), assigning a unique barcode to each of the libraries to be sequenced together.
The cDNA samples and libraries were examined on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) DNA HS chips for size distribution, and
quantified by Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The majority of the cDNA fragments in each sample were between 1 and 3
kb, indicating good transcript integrity. The RNA-seq libraries from each experiment (i.e., one for each mouse strain, NRG-HIS and NRGF-HIS mice) were pooled
together in equal amounts and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid
Flowcell as single-end 75nt reads following the standard protocol. Sequencing
depth was of 10–30 million reads per sample (7–10 samples were loaded on a single
flow cell). Raw sequencing reads were filtered by Illumina HiSeq Control Software
and only Pass-Filter (PF) reads were used for further analysis.
RNA-Sequencing data analysis. In the Galaxy platform58 through Princeton
University, single-end short reads were mapped to the human reference (version
GRCh38) and the murine reference (version GRCm38) using TopHat and Bowtie 2
with default parameters and read groups specified. Only counts from uniquely
mapped reads were used in the DESeq 2 analyses.
Counts were generated by htseq-count59 version 0.6.1galaxy1 run on a Galaxy
installation, downloaded, and read into R60 version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21) using scripts
run in RStudio version 0.99.48961. The htseq count data was loaded into R and the
DESeq2 (Galaxy Version 2.11.38) utilized62, capturing factors for cohort, day, and
batch, with the sampling day as the experimental design. We set up the
experimental design for the contrast we were interested in (day 0 versus day 11)
and normalized log2 transformed transcript counts within DESeq2. Differential
gene expression were determined for each group of mice (NRG-HIS, NRGF-HIS/
Flt3LG or NRGF-HIS/Fluc) using the standard DESeq2 filters and
nbinomWaldTest. Results were extracted from the DESeq2 analysis and annotated
using Bioconductor’s AnnotationDbi (version 1.32.3) and org.Hs.eg.db packages
(version 3.2.3). Differential gene expression was considered as significant when
padj ≤ 0.05. Results are available in Supplementary Data 1.
Gene set enrichment analysis was performed in R using the package Generally
Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE)63. Briefly, the GAGE method was called
with the regularized log2 fold change values, and with the go.sets.hs37,38 or kegg.
sets.hs40,41 database. Same.dir was set to true (since we were interested in wholesale up- or down-regulated shifts). The top five resulting KEGG pathways (qvalue ≤ 0.06) were then identified.
Human vaccinees datasets and measure of correlation index. For the Emory
cohort (n = 25 vaccinees, two independent trials of respectively 15 and 10 human
vaccinees28), micro array data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
under series accession no. GSE13485. For the Lausanne and Montreal cohorts (n =
11 and n = 25 vaccinees respectively44), data were downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus under series accession no. GSE13699. For the three cohorts,
micro array raw data at day 0 and day 7 post vaccination were downloaded and we
employed GEO2R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/) to determine the set
of differentially regulated genes at day 7 post vaccination. For the Emory cohort, we
identified a set of 193 genes with padj ≤ 0.1 differentially regulated at day 7 post
vaccination. For the Lausanne and Montreal cohort, we identified a set of 2674 and
12930 genes with padj ≤ 0.1 differentially regulated at day 7 post vaccination,
respectively.
To establish our correlation index, we decided to focus on gene expression foldchange (FC) as the compared variable, as it is adimensional and can therefore be
compared across experiments using different expression measurement
methodologies
We first sought to establish a global human dataset of genes that could be used
to measure similarity with humanized mice in a relevant fashion. To do so, we used
two methods. In the first one (unbiased), the gene set included all genes that had
been statistically determined to be differentially expressed (for a defined
Benjamini–Holmes-adjusted p-value threshold of q equal or lower than 0.1) in at
least one of the three human cohorts. This method has the merit of being the most
unbiased, as it uses no other criteria than statistical relevance. However, it is
sensitive to false positives (that can occur somewhat frequently in transcriptome
analyses, especially concerning low-expression genes). Moreover, when
constructing the gene dataset that way, a disproportionate fraction of it was actually
determined by the Montreal human cohort, as this cohort displayed the highest
number of differentially regulated genes. To compensate for the over-weight of the
Montreal cohort in our dataset, we therefore also used a double selection method,
where we only selected genes that had been statistically determined to be
differentially expressed (for a defined Benjamini–Holmes-adjusted p-value
threshold of q equal or lower than 0.1) in two or more of the three human cohorts.
This method ensures the biological relevance of the genes selected in the set
construction as they have been detected in more than one cohort, but at the cost of
omitting potentially relevant candidates that were only detected in only one cohort.
For both methods, after elimination of duplicates, we averaged the fold-changes
of the genes in the set across all three human cohorts, therefore building two

adjusted-p-value-dependent reference vectors: the “unbiased” vector Uq and the
“double selection” vector Dq.
Finally, the Spearman rho correlation statistics to those reference vectors were
computed for each humanized mouse cohort to build our correlation index. For a
mouse cohort M, the “unbiased” value vector MU,q was first built as follows:
MU;q ¼ FCg ; g in unbiased gene set n o
The values in MU,q and Uq were ranked to obtain the vectors rgMU,q and rgUq,
and the
unbiased correlation index rM,U,q (simply referred to as rU in the Results
section) was then computed as follows:
rM;U;q ¼ covðrgMU;qrgUqÞ=ðσrgMU;qσrgUqÞ
The double selection correlation index rM,D,q (simply referred to as rD in the
Results section) was computed in a similar fashion for a mouse cohort M.
It is important to note that the correlation index is dependent on the adjusted pvalue threshold selected when building the reference vectors Uq and Dq. As this
threshold is raised, more genes will be included in building the index, thus affecting
the whole process leading to the computing of our correlation indexes. To address
that question, we built several versions of our reference vectors Uq and Dq using
different adjusted p-value thresholds (from 0.01 to 0.1 by 0.01 increments) and
computed rM,U,q and rM,D,q for each of them. Based on the shapes of the rM,U,q = f
(q) and rM,D,q = f(q) curves, which all show a steady, linear decline with no sharp
discontinuity between q = 0.02 and q = 0.08, we chose to use the correlation index
value derived from gene sets constructed with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05
as our definitive correlation indexes. For a mouse cohort M, the unbiased
correlation index to human cohorts rM,U is therefore:
rM;U ¼ rM;U;q; q ¼ 0:05ðsimply referred to asrU;q¼0:05in the Results sectionÞ
And the double selection index rM,D:
rM;D ¼ rM;D;q; q ¼ 0:05ðsimply referred to asrD;q¼0:05in the Results sectionÞ
Protein–protein interaction network representation. Network coordinates and
protein–protein interactions were downloaded via the STRING biological database64 and rendered using the open source software platform for network data
integration Cytoscape V3.4.065.
scRNA-Seq. Human CD45+ and human CD33+ populations from the spleens of
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice and NRG-HIS mice were FACS-sorted and loaded onto
prepared Seq-Well arrays, as previously described. Briefly, 10,000 single cells were
loaded onto one array containing 86,000 barcoded mRNA capture beads. Cells and
beads were co-confined in microwells on the array, and a polycarbonate membrane
sealed individual wells to allow for isolated single-cell lysis and transcript hybridization prior to bead recovery for reverse transcription. Next, each library was
treated with Exonuclease I to remove excess primers, and PCR amplification was
performed using KAPA Hifi PCR Mastermix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) to generate final cDNA libraries. Libraries were then constructed using the
Nextera XT DNA tagmentation method (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Tagmented and amplified libraries were subsequently purified and sequenced using an
Illumina 75 cycle NextSeq500/550v2 kit (read 1: 20 12 bp barcode, 8 bp UMI; read
2: 50). Detailed procedures for scRNA-Seq data alignment and analysis are available in the Methods section.
ScRNA-sequencing library generation. Frozen splenocytes from NFA2-HIS/
Flt3LG and NRG-HIS mice were thawed and stained with antibodies for antihuman CD33 or CD45, and calcein green as a positive viability marker. Cell
populations that were either anti-human CD33+ or anti-human CD45+ and
calcein green positive were sorted into RPMI + 10% FBS. Single cells from each
sort gate and each animal were loaded onto prepared Seq-Well arrays, as previously
described49. Briefly, 10,000 single cells from each sort gate were loaded onto one
array containing 86,000 barcoded mRNA capture beads. Cells and beads were coconfined in microwells on the array, and a polycarbonate membrane sealed individual wells to allow for isolated single-cell lysis and transcript hybridization prior
to bead recovery for reverse transcription. Next, each library was treated with
Exonuclease I to remove excess primers, and PCR amplification with KAPA Hifi
PCR Mastermix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to generate final cDNA
libraries. Libraries were then constructed using the Nextera XT DNA tagmentation
method (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Tagmented and amplified libraries were
subsequently purified and sequenced using an Illumina 75 cycle NextSeq500/550v2
kit (30 bp PE reads).
ScRNA-Seq alignment and analysis. The reads were aligned as described in
ref. 66. Briefly, for each NextSeq sequencing run, raw sequencing data was converted to demultiplexed FASTQ files using bcl2fastq2 based on Nextera N700
indices corresponding to individual samples/arrays. Reads were then aligned
simultaneously to both mm10 and hg19 genomes using the Galaxy portal maintained by the Broad Institute for Drop-Seq alignment using standard settings of the
STAR aligner. Individual reads were tagged according to the 12-bp barcode
sequenced and the 8-bp UMI contained in Read 1 of each fragment. Following
alignment, reads were binned onto 12-bp cell barcodes and collapsed by their 8-bp
UMI. Digital gene expression matrices for each sample were obtained from quality
filtered and mapped reads. UMI-collapsed data was utilized as input into R for
further analysis.
We first compared the alignment quality between NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice
and NRG-HIS mice in each sorting condition. We confirmed equivalent
sequencing depth and sample input quality between NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG and
NRG-HIS mice by observing the total transcripts/single cell detected for the
mouse single cells that contaminated our sorted populations. However, we
observed overall lower quality among single cells that align to human genomes
in the NRG-HIS mice compared to NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, which cannot be
attributed to differences in sequencing depth. We next merged UMI matrices
across all genes detected in any hCD45+ sample (2 from NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG, 2
from NRG-HIS mice), and eliminated cells with fewer than 300 UMI detected
and fewer than 300 unique genes detected (n = 1297 across 2 NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG
mice, n = 457 across 2 NRG-HIS mice). We next partitioned the matrix into cells
originating from NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice or NRG-HIS mice, and completed all
clustering and cell calling analyses in parallel. To complete dimensionality
reduction and data visualization methods, we first identified the top variable
genes by including all genes with an average normalized and scaled expression
value greater than 0.32 and dispersion greater than 0.6. Principal Components
Analysis was performed over the list of variable genes and all cells (for each
experimental group individually). We determined the top significant principal
components using a permutation method as previously described67. Significant
principal components were used for tSNE plotting, with perplexity of 40. We
used FindClusters, a clustering algorithm in the R package Seurat 1.4.0.1 (https://
github.com/satijalab/seurat) to identify significant clusters. 10 clusters were
found for NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, and 6 clusters were found for NRG-HIS mice,
using equivalent parameters. No cluster was attributed to any single mouse. To
identify genes that defined each cluster, we performed a likelihood ratio test
implemented in Seurat. Top marker genes were used to classify cell clusters into
cell types based on existing biological knowledge.
To better understand diversity within the non-T cell, non-B cell compartment
of each humanized mouse type, we merged both hCD45+ and hCD33+ arrays for
NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice, and separately merged hCD45+ and hCD33+ arrays
from NRG-HIS mice. We eliminated low quality cells with the same parameters as
above, and eliminated any cell with expression of the following genes: CD3E,
CD3G, CD3D, TRAC*, TRBC*, CD79A, CD79B, IGKC, IGLC*, MSA41, CD19 (*
indicates any number), to gate out any T or B cells. We applied the same protocol
as above to identify variable genes, identify significant principal components,
calculate a tSNE representation, find significant cell clusters, and annotate cell
clusters by identifying biologically meaningful defining genes. Genes that define
each of these non-T, non-B cell clusters in the NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice were
compared directly to the expression of these genes in the NRG-HIS non T, non B
cells. Gene differential expression was calculated using a likelihood ratio test for
zero inflated data, implemented in Seurat, with original description described68.
To directly compare the abundance of each cell type by annotation in each
humanized mouse dataset, we took all hCD45+ samples and merged their UMI
matrices. We analyzed this data as described above, and calculated the frequency of
each cell type within either NRG-HIS mice or NFA2-HIS/Flt3LG mice.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using either a nonparametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test69 or a parametric Student’ t test
(GraphPad Prism software V6.0) when appropriate and as indicated in each figure
legend. A two-way ANOVA test was performed for multiple comparison
(GraphPad Prism software V6.0). *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.
Information related to the statistical analysis performed for RNA-seq and singlecell RNA seq experiments can be found in the related sections above.
