Abstract. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare 
primary malignant liver tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. Recently its incidence has increased, however, little 
attention has been directed to factors related to its molecular 
carcinogenesis, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes 
and cell cycle-related proteins. ICC is generally characterized 
by strong proliferation, invasion and early metastasis. These 
biological behaviors of ICC, with respect to the genetic and 
molecular aspects, remain to be clarified. In this study, we 
performed a proteomic analysis to identify the proteomic 
alterations associated with carcinogenesis of ICC. Protein 
expression profiles of sixteen cases of ICC were compared 
with those of adjacent non-involved bile duct tissue. Among 
the 151 protein spots that showed a statistically significant 
expression difference (P<0.05), there were 50 spots with 
significantly increased intensity (3-fold increase) and 17 spots 
with decreased intensity (3-fold decrease) in cancerous tissues. 
Of these, increased expression of fatty acid-binding protein 
5 (FABP5) was further confirmed by western blot analysis 
and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical 
analysis of FABP5 expression in tumor specimens obtained 
from 43 patients with mass-forming (MF) type ICC showed a 
positive correlation of FABP5 immunoreactivity with tumor 
size (P=0.047), lymph node metastasis (P=0.013), angioinvasion (P=0.032) and staging (P=0.007). In addition, silencing 
FABP5 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed 
cell proliferation and invasiveness in HuCCT1 cells, and 
conversely, overexpression of FABP5 in FABP5-negative 
Hep3B cells increased cell proliferation and invasiveness. 
Our study shows that FABP5 is significantly overexpressed 
in ICC combined lymph node metastasis and is involved in 
cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Our data suggest that 
FABP5 may be associated with tumor progression in ICC.
Introduction
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most 
common type of primary liver cancer. It arises from the 
second or more distal branches of intrahepatic bile ducts. 
Although ICC accounts for only 5-15% of primary liver 
malignancies, its incidence and cancer-related mortality 
continues to rise. The causes for this increasing incidence 
remain unknown and may be related to predisposing genetic 
and environmental factors (1). Surgical resection has been 
shown to improve long-term survival of patients with ICC, 
but the resectibility rate for this cancer is low and the 
outcome even after resection still remains disappointing. The 
reasons are likely that early diagnosis of ICC is difficult and 
currently no effective treatment in the advanced stages of the 
disease is available (2,3). Clinicopathologic factors such as 
tumor size, differentiation, gross type, cancer-free margin, 
vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis have been 
reported to be significant prognositic factors (3,4). Despite 
the recent advances in disease detection and treatment, the 
predicted outcome for ICC remains dismal, partly because 
of limited knowledge of the molecular processes involved in 
pathogenesis and failure to detect the disease in the early 
stages. Therefore, it is critical to identify biomarkers that 
enable early diagnosis, provide insight into pathogenesis of 
the disease, and develop more effective treatment options.
Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are members of the 
intracellular lipid-binding protein family and are abundantly 
expressed 14-15-kDa proteins that reversibly bind intracellular hydrophobic ligands (5,6). These proteins are thought

invasion in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

to be involved in the uptake and intracellular transport of fatty 
acids. In addition, they play many roles in gene regulation, 
cell signaling, cell growth and differentiation (7). FABP5, 
also known as psoriasis-associated fatty acid-binding protein 
(PA-FABP), epidermal or cutaneous fatty acid-binding protein 
(E- or C-FABP) was originally isolated from psoriatic skin 
samples (8). It was later found to be expressed in many other 
tissues, including mammary gland (9). Several recent studies 
have reported that FABP5 was very strongly expressed in 
pancreas, bladder and prostate cancers (10-12), indicating that 
FABP5 may also play a role in malignant progression in these 
tissues. Although the precise role of FABP5 in these tissues 
is not clear, it is likely to be involved in binding and transporting intracellular fatty acids, some of which are signaling 
molecules reported to be involved in the regulation of gene 
expression (13,14).
In the current study, we analyzed differential expression 
profiles of human ICC and normal tissue specimens, examined 
the expression of FABP5 protein in clinical ICC specimens, 
and assessed the relationship between FABP5 expression 
pattern and known clinicopathological variables. In addition, 
we investigated the effect of stable overexpression and knockdown of FABP5 on cancer cell proliferation and invasion to 
determine whether FABP5 contributes to carcinogenesis of 
cholangiocarcinoma. We report that FABP5 is significantly 
overexpressed in ICC, and associated with tumor size, lymph 
node metastasis, angio-invasion and TNM (tumor, node and 
metastasis) staging. Moreover, FABP5 expression promotes 
cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
Materials and methods
Patients and tissue samples. Pairs of cancerous and normal 
tissues diagnosed by a pathologist were collected from 
sixteen patients with MF type ICC who underwent radical 
or palliative surgical procedures at Gyeongsang National 
University Hospital (GNUH) during the period 2006-
2009. The clinical data collected included age, gender, 
differentiation, operation type and TNM stage. None of the 
patients received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
Informed patient consent was obtained for all of the cases. 
The use of the tissue samples for this project was approved 
by the GNUH Institutional Review Board. Cancerous lesions 
and the corresponding normal bile duct tissues were excised 
during surgery and stored at -70˚C for proteomic analysis and 
further study.
Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
(2-DE). Tissue samples (150-200 mg) were homogenized on 
ice in 1 ml homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) 
containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged, followed 
by TCA precipitation. The protein precipitate was resuspended 
in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM Tris-base, 
100 mM DTT and 2% (w/v) ampholyte) and the protein 
concentration was measured using Bradford method with 
Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal 
amounts of protein extracts of each tissue samples (50 µg 
for silver-stained gels or up to 0.5 mg for Coomassie-stained 
gels) were subjected to isoelectric focusing (pH 4.0 to 7.0) and 
sequentially a gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5-17.5%) 
electrophoresis as previously described (15).
Protein visualization and image analysis. Separated twodimensional gels were fixed and then pretreated in a solution 
of 0.02% sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate. After washing 
twice with deionized water, the gels were impregnated in a 
solution of 0.2% silver nitrate and 0.075% (v/v) formaldehyde, 
transferred to a developing solution [0.06% (v/v) formaldehyde, 
2% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.0004% sodium sulfoxide]. For 
Coomassie staining, the gels were fixed and rinsed twice in 2% 
phosphoric acid. The gels were placed in equilibration (18% 
ethanol, 2% phosphoric acid and 15% ammonium sulfate) 
followed by overnight staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue 
G-250 solution. The gels were scanned using a high resolution 
scanner (GS-800 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) and analyzed using PDQuest™ version 8.0. software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The intensity of each spot was 
quantified by calculating the spot volume after normalization 
of the gel image.
In-gel digestion. Selected protein spots were excised from 
2-DE gels that had been stained with Coomassie blue G-250. 
Gel pieces first were destained with water/acetonitrile (1:1 
v/v) then dehydrated in acetonitrile followed by rehydration 
in 10 mM DTT/0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min 
at 56˚C. After cooling the tubes to room temperature and 
removing the liquid, 55 mM iodoacetamide in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate was added and the tubes were incubated for 
30 min at room temperature in the dark. The iodoacetamide 
solution was removed and the gel particles were washed with 
0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile and then dried 
in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried gel pieces were incubated 
in freshly prepared digestion buffer containing 50 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mM CaCl2, and 12.5 ng/µl trypsin 
overnight at 37˚C. The supernatant was then collected and the 
digested peptides extracted three times in 5% formic acid/
acetonitrile (1:1 v/v).
Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightmass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database search. 
The digested peptides were redissolved in a solution containing 
water, acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid (93:5:2 by volume) 
and sonicated for 5 min in a bath sonicator. Target preparation 
was carried out by the ‘solution phase nitrocellulose method’ 
described by Landry et al (16). Briefly, a saturated solution 
of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA; ~40 mg/ml) and 
nitrocellulose solution (20 mg/ml) were prepared separately 
in acetone and mixed with 2-propanol at a ratio of 2:1:1, 
respectively. Internal calibrants (50-200 fmole each), des-Argbradykinin (monoisotopic mass = 904.4681), and neurotensin 
(monoisotopic mass = 1672.9715) were added to the mixture. 
The matrix solution was mixed with the sample at a 1:1 
ratio, and 1 µl of mixed sample was spotted onto a MALDI 
plate. The dried spots were analyzed with a Voyager-DE 
STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA). The identity of the proteins was assigned by 
comparing the observed mass fingerprint with the predicted 
mass fingerprint of proteins in the SWISS-Prot and NCBI 
databases using the MS-Fit search program (17).

Western blot analysis. Lysates (40 µg) from ICC and its 
corresponding normal bile duct tissues from 16 patients were 
separated by on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated 
proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBST solution 
(Tris-buffed saline, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 
and 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% skim milk. After blocking, 
the membranes were washed in TBST twice for 10 min each 
and incubated with anti-FABP5 rabbit polyclonal antibody for 
1 h at room temperature. After additional washes with TBST, 
the membranes were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG 
(1:10,000) for 1 h. After final washes, proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce, 
Rockford, IL). β-actin was used as a loading control in the 
stripped blot.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
tissue blocks from 43 patients with MF-ICC were collected, 
sectioned at 4 µm and mounted on slides. The slides were 
deparaffinized and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series, and 
pretreated with 10 mM sodium citrate. Immunostaining was 
performed with a rabbit polyclonal FABP5 antibody (1:500) 
using an LSAB kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Antigen 
retrieval was facilitated by microwaving the tissue for 15 min, 
and the staining procedure was carried out according to the 
standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex system previously 
described (18). Immunohistochemical staining was interpretated and categorized by an arbitrary semi-quantitative scale 
as 0 (negative staining), +1 (0~20% positive), +2 (20~40% 
positive), or +3 (>40% positive) by pathologists. The staining 
intensity was also simply categorized into ‘weak’ (0 to +1) 
and ‘strong’ (+2 to +3) groups. Tumor size, degree of differentiation, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, perineural 
invasion and multiplicity were included in the clinicopathological information (Table III).
Cell culture and transfection. HuCCT1 cell line was purchased 
from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, 
Japan). HuCCT1 cells were cultured with RPMI-1640, 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X penicillin/streptomycin at 
37˚C in 5% CO2 incubator. Human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B 
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 
1X antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
and 95% air at 37˚C. Human FABP5 cDNA was cloned into 
pcDNA3.1 using standard RT-PCR procedures. The empty 
vector was used as a control for possible effects caused by 
the transfected plasmid. The constructs were transfected 
into Hep3B cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and 
stable FABP5-expressing cell lines were selected by G418 
(2 mg/ml).
Short-hairpin RNA-mediated FABP5-gene silencing. The 
MISSION shRNA bacterial glycerol stock containing 5 
anti-FABP5 shRNA sequences and the SHC002 shRNA 
Control were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The shRNA 
constructs were transfected into HuCCT1 cells using a 
reagent (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Stable shRNA-expressing cell 
lines were established and selected by puromycin (2 µg/ml). 
Results from shRNA TRCN0000059720 are presented in 
this report.
Proliferation assay and invasion assay. For proliferation 
assay, cells were placed in a 6-well plate at a concentration 
of 1x105 cells/well. After incubation for 1-3 days, the viable 
cells were counted with a hemocytometer after trypan blue 
staining. Invasion assays were performed on 24-well transwells (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with polycarbonate 
filters (8 µm pore size). The transwells for invation assays 
were coated with a uniform layer of BD Matrigel™ Basement 
Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). 
The stable cell lines were resuspended in RPMI-1640 or 
DMEM containing 10% FBS and seeded into the upper wells 
(1x105 cells/well) and incubated at 37˚C for 24 h. Invaded 
cells were fixed in 4% PFA, stained with DAPI, and counted 
under the fluorescent microscope at x100 magnification for 
5 random fields.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by the 
Chi-squared test using the SPSS program (version 11.0). All 
P-values were based on a two-tailed statistical analysis, and 
P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Proteomic analysis of ICC. We analyzed the proteomic 
profiles of the ICC tissue and corresponding normal bile duct 
tissues from 16 patients to establish a tumor specific protein 
expression profile. The upregulated or downregulated protein 
expressions between the ICC tissue samples and their healthy 
counterparts were evaluated using PDQuest™ software. By 
making comparison with PDQuest software quantification, 
the 151 protein spots that showed a statistically meaningful 
expression difference (P<0.05) were selected. The spots that 
showed more than a 3-fold increase or decrease of intensity 
were defined as being the up- or downregulated proteins, 
respectively. According to this definition, among the 67 
candidate protein spots, 50 proteins were upregulated and 17 
proteins were downregulated in ICC tissue compared to the 
non-cancerous bile duct tissue. The protein spots were identified using MALDI-TOF-MS and the MS-FIT search program. 
The identities of the proteins were confirmed by comprehensively comparing the corresponding experimental value of 
isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight (MW), the number 
of matched peptides, and the sequence coverage to known 
proteins in the SWISS-PROT and NCBI databases. The lists 
of proteins that were found to be up- or downregulated in ICC 
tissue are shown in Tables I and II, respectively.
Verification of FABP5 expression in ICC tissue specimens 
by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Among 
the identified proteins, the spot 6010 showed markedly 
increased intensity in all of investigated patients with an 
average increase of 4.49-fold (Fig. 1A). Statistical analysis of 
the spots confirmed that spot 6010 was significantly upregulated (P=0.0125) and subsequently identified as FABP5 by 
MALDI-TOF-MS, with a molecular mass of 15.2 kDa and 
a pI 6.6. The sequence coverage of protein isolated from 
peptide mass matching in the program was 43.7% (Table I).

Expression levels of FABP5 were also examined by 
western blot analysis in paired ICC and normal bile duct 
tissues obtained from 16 patients. Nine representative 
samples of western blotting for FABP5 expression are 
shown in Fig. 1B. Western blot analysis of FABP5 expression in the same sample as those used for 2-DE confirmed 
that FABP5 was highly expressed in ICC samples, while the 
normal bile duct from the same patients showed undetectable FABP5 levels. As shown in Fig. 1C, the upregulation 
ratio of FABP5 in ICC to normal bile duct tissues was about 
5-fold. We next compared expression of FABP5 in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis 
revealed that all five cholangiocarcinoma cell lines highly 
expressed FABP5.

FABP5 was primarily observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in both cancerous and non-cancerous tissues (Fig. 2). 
Immunohistochemical staining was interpretated and categorized by an arbitrary semi-quantitative scale as 0 (negative 
staining), +1 (0~20% positive), +2 (20~40% positive), and +3 
(>40% positive) by pathologists. All normal bile ducts stained 
weakly for FABP5 (0 or +1), while the strong staining intensity 
was verified in ICC (+1 to +3).
Correlation between FABP5 expression and clinicopathological variables. In order to investigate the clinical 
significance of FABP5 expression, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on tissue sections from a larger 
population of ICC patients. A total of 43 patients with MF 
type ICC who underwent several types of major hepatectomy 
and lymph node dissection, either alone or in conjunction 
with extrahepatic bile duct resection were enrolled in this 
study. There were 33 men and 10 women with a mean age 
of 63.21 years (range, 47-80 years). If the tumor seemed 
to invade adjacent organs grossly in the operative field, 
combined resection was performed to achieve negative resection margins. Clinical data and outcome of the patients were 
collected from medical records retrospectively. The results of 
the study revealed weak FABP5 staining (0 or +1) in 18 of the 
43 cases, which were classified as the weak positive group. 
The remaining 25 cases exhibited strong FABP5 staining and 
were classified as the strong positive group (+2 or +3). The 
expression levels of FABP5 were compared with the clinical 
and pathological characteristics of each case of MF type 
ICC, including size, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, 
vascular invasion, perineural invasion, multiplicity and stage 
(Table III). All eight patients with lymph node metastasis 
showed strong staining intensity against FABP5. Univariate 
analysis revealed that tumor size (P=0.047), lymph node 
metastasis (P=0.013), angio-invasion (P=0.032), and staging 
(P=0.007) significantly correlated with expression levels of 
FABP5.

Effect of FABP5 on the proliferation and invasion of ICC 
cells. Suppression of FABP5 expression in oral squamous cell 
carcinoma has been reported to inhibit proliferation and invasion (19). Therefore, we first investigated whether FABP5 was 
critical for the proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma cells. We 
used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to silence the expression of 
FABP5. HuCCT1 cells were transfected with control shRNA 
or FABP5 specific shRNA plasmid. After puromycin (2 µg/ml) 
selection, western blot analysis confirmed that FABP5-shRNA 
clones (named FABP5-KD #2, FABP5-KD #8, FABP5-KD 
#11) showed an almost complete silence of FABP5 expression compared to control shRNA clones (Fig. 3A). Depletion 
of FABP5 expression significantly (P<0.01) inhibited the cell 
proliferation rate of HuCCT1 cells without significant increase

using FABP5-specific shRNA. (B) The cell proliferation rate was determined by cell count using trypan blue exclusion assay. The growth curve revealed that 
downregulation of FABP5 reduced the proliferation of HuCCT1 cells. (C) Matrigel invasion assay of HuCCT1 cell clones stably transfected with FABP5-
specific shRNA or empty vector control. A total of 1x105 cells were plated on the upper chamber of transwell filters (8 µm pore) occluded by a thin layer of 
Matrigel basement membrane matrix. After 24 h, the invasive cells that were able to invade into the lower surface of the filter were fixed, stained with DAPI 
and counted under the fluorescent microscope. The graph contains data from three independent experiments (right panel).

of dead cells (Fig. 3B). To examine the effects of FABP5 
depletion on tumor cell invasion in FABP5-depleting HuCCT1 
clones, we then performed in vitro invasion assay. FABP5 
depletion caused a significant reduction in the invasiveness of 
FABP5-depleted HuCCT1 cells (Fig. 3C).
To confirm the enhancing effects of FABP5 on cell proliferation and invasion, we also examined the effects of the 
FABP5 overexpression on the FABP5-negative hepatoma cell 
line Hep3B by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the 
FABP5 protein. After G418 (2 mg/ml) selection, the expression 
of FABP5 in selected clones (named FABP5 #1, FABP5 #2, 
FABP5 #3) was determined by western blotting (Fig. 4A). Cell 
proliferation rate, counted by trypan blue assay (Fig. 4B) and 
Matrigel invasion assays (Fig. 4C) of FABP5 overexpressing 
cell clones were significantly increased compared to the 
control vector expressing clones. Taking these results together, 
the expression of FABP5 seems to be involved in the increased 
cell proliferation and invasion of ICC cells.
Discussion
Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving cumulative 
genetic and epigenetic alterations such as the activation of 
oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (1). 
Recent extensive molecular studies of cholangiocarcinoma 
demonstrated that numerous molecular modifications, 
including dysregulation of cell growth and survival pathways, aberrant gene expression, invasion and metastasis, and 
tumor microenvironment play important roles in multistep 
cholangiocarcinogenesis (20). ICC is a good model for the 
study of multistep carcinogenesis because of the progress 
from hyperplasia to dysplasia, and finally to adenocarcinoma (21).
To gain a comprehensive understanding of cellular function, the logical method of analysis is proteomics, in which the 
global protein expression patterns in a cell, tissue, or organism 
can be analyzed. In general, proteomics deal with the largescale determination of gene and cell function directly at the 
protein level. Many proteomic studies investigating HCC have 
been done already, but only a few studies using ICC tissues 
or cell lines have been published (22,23). In this study, we 
obtained the protein profiles of the normal bile duct and ICC 
tissues. By comparing these profiles, we obtained 67 proteins 
that showed differential expressions (more than a 3-fold 
increased or decreased, P<0.05) in the ICC tissues (Tables I 
and II). Fifty proteins, including FABP5, proapoptotic caspase 
adapter protein (PACAP), metastasin, protein kinase C epsilon 
(PKCε), calgizzarin, target of methylation-induced silencing 
1 (TMS1), calgranulin C and maspin, were upregulated in the 
ICC tissues, while 17 proteins, including heat shock protein β-3 
(HspB3), glyoxalase domain-containing protein 4 (GLOD4), 
glutathione peroxidase 1, T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon 
(TCP-1ε), ketohexokinase and transaldolase, were downregulated. Among the set of differentially expressed proteins, we 
identified several proteins previously described as proteins 
that are involved in ICC progression or differentially expressed 
by ICC. Three proteins, FABP5, TMS1 and ketohexokinase 
in ICC were newly identified in this study. Subsequently, we 
focused on FABP5, which have previously been reported 
as upregulated protein in other cancers. FABP5 was barely 
detectable in normal bile duct tissues. However, the expression 
was increased in ICC when the rate of increase in ICC was 
more evident in western blotting (Fig. 1). Furthermore, our 
results were validated by immunohistochemical staining of 43 
tumor sections. These results showed that the expression of 
FABP5 was suitably visible in the inflammatory bile duct, and 
was greatly increased in many ICC tissues (Fig. 2).
Comparative analysis of the clinicopathological characteristics of carcinomas with weak FABP5 staining (0 or +1) 
and those with strong FABP5 staining (2+ or +3) indicated 
that tumors with strong FABP5 expression were significantly 
associated with tumor size (P=0.047), lymph node metastasis 
(P=0.013), angioinvasion (P=0.032) and staging (P=0.007) 
(Table 3). Lymph node metastasis is a negative prognostic 
factor in patients with ICC (3). Analysis of prognostic factors 
after surgical resection demonstrated that mixed type of 
mass-forming (MF) and periductal-infiltrating (PI) ICC, 
lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion were important predictive factors related to poor survival (3). Another 
study revealed that lymph node metastasis was closely associated with negative prognostic factors including MF or PI 
type, poorly or undifferentiated tumors, vascular invasion, 
and perineural invasion (4). In the current study, all of the 43 
enrolled patients had MF type ICC and underwent standard 
lymph node dissection, and lymph node metastasis was found 
in eight cases (18.6%). Cancerous tissues from all patients 
with lymph node metastasis exhibited strong staining for 
FABP5. Our results demonstrated that increased expression 
of FABP5 is significantly correlated with known factors of 
poor prognosis and poor outcome.
FABPs are 14-to-15 kDa proteins of 126-134 amino acids 
in length, and are designated according to the tissue from 
which they were first isolated or identified, such as liver FABP 
(L-FABP), heart FABP (H-FABP), adipose FABP (A-FABP) 
and epidermal FABP (E-FABP or FABP5). Among them, 
E-FABP, also known as psoriasis-associated (PA)-FABP, 
keratinocyte FABP, was originally isolated from psoriatic skin 
samples (8). It is a small (15.2 kDa) cytoplasmic protein and has 
binding activity typical of the FABP family of proteins in that 
it has a high affinity for long-chain fatty acids. Several recent 
studies have implicated FABP5 in tumorigenesis. Adamson 
et al demonstrated that FABP5 was increased in prostatic 
carcinoma cells, and that suppression of FABP5 expression 
inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) (12). FABP5 contributes to metastasis by upregulating 
the expression of the VEGF gene, which is one of the most 
potent stimulators of angiogenesis (24). In addition to prostatic 
carcinoma, a recent study reported that FABP5 may also play a 
role in the malignant progression of pancreatic carcinoma, and 
that overexpression of FABP5 in chemo-resistant pancreatic 
cancer cell lines enhances intracellular compartmentation or 
removal of cytotoxic drugs (10). Another proteomic study 
using human HCC cell lines revealed increased expression of 
FABP5 in HCC tissues compared with normal hepatocytes 
(25). A more recent study reported that suppression of FABP5 
expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma inhibited cell 
proliferation and invasion (19). To elucidate the biological 
significance of elevated levels of FABP5, studies utilizing 
siRNA-mediated silencing of FABP5 were performed. We 
showed that FABP5 is highly expressed in ICC cells and 

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 28: 1283-1292, 2012 1291
is involved in the enhanced cell proliferation and invasion 
through experiments that used both FABP5 downregulation 
and upregulation. The shRNA-mediated silencing of FABP5 
in HuCCT1 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation 
and invasion (Fig. 3). On the contrary, Hep3B cells stably 
expressing FABP5 showed increased invasion and proliferation abilities of cancer cell (Fig. 4). Although the precise role of 
FABP5 in carcinogenesis is not clear, it is likely to be involved 
in the binding and transport of intracellular fatty acids, some 
of which may be signaling molecules involved in carcinogenesis (26). Intracellular fatty acids (FAs) are bound by FABPs, 
which are important carriers of the intracellular FAs. Elevated 
expression of FABPs may result in the increased mobilization 
of FAs, and thus enhance FA signaling activity.
FAs, especially polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), such as 
arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid, can act as signaling 
molecules recognized by the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (27). PPAR family members 
are nuclear receptors known to regulate the transcription of 
many genes involved in lipid metabolism (28). Of the three 
PPAR isotypes (PPARα, PPAR β/δ and PPARγ), PPARβ/δ is 
known to be a downstream gene of Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
pathway and it has been shown to promote human cholangiocarcioma cell growth (29). It was demonstrated that the 
positive feedback loop between PPARβ/δ and prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) played an important role in cholangiocarcinoma cell growth in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. 
Activation of PPARβ/δ has also been shown to increase the 
expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the production 
of COX-2-derived PGE2, resulting in subsequent activation of PPARβ/δ through cPLA2a phosphorylation-induced 
AA release (30,31). In turn, cPLA2a-derived AA activates 
PPARβ/δ in the nucleus. This positive feedback loop is likely 
important for increased E-FABP expression in cholangiocarcinoma.
In conclusion, the current study showed that the expression of FABP5 was significantly increased in ICC with lymph 
node metastasis, vascular invasion, and large tumor size and 
it can regulate proliferation and invasion in cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro. This finding suggests a potential role of 
FABP5 in tumor progression. We propose that FABP5 may 
serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic 
target for ICC.
