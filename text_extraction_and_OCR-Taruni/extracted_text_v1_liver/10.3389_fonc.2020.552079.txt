Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of the Children’s Oncology
Group (COG) risk stratification system to the Children’s Hepatic tumor International
Collaboration (CHIC) risk stratification system for predicting the prognosis of Chinese
children with hepatoblastoma (HB).
Methods: Clinicopathological data of 86 patients diagnosed with HB between January
2014 and December 2017 were retrieved. The study endpoints were the 1- and 3-year
overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed to evaluate the
predictive value.
Results: The 1-, 3-year OS and DFS of the 86 patients were 86.0%, 76.3%, and 74.4%,
54.0%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that age at diagnosis had a significant
role in prognosis for both OS and DFS, along with PRETEXT staging and metastasis at
diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed that metastasis at diagnosis (HR 3.628, 95% CI
1.404-9.378, P=0.008), PRETEXT staging system (HR 2.176, 95% CI 1.230-3.849,
P=0.008) and age at diagnosis (HR 2.268, 95% CI 1.033-4.982, P=0.041) were
independent factors for OS. For DFS, the independent factors were the PRETEXT
staging system (HR 2.241, 95% CI 1.533-3.277, P<0.001) and age at diagnosis (HR
1.792, 95% CI 1.018-3.154, P=0.043). Both COG and CHIC risk stratification systems
could effectively predict the prognosis of children with HB for OS. For DFS, the CHIC risk
stratification system was more effective. In addition, the CHIC risk stratification system had
a higher c-index (OS 0.743, DFS 0.730), compared to the COG risk stratification system
(OS 0.726, DFS 0.594).

INTRODUCTION
HB is a rare childhood tumor with an annual incidence of 1.5
cases per million children, occurring predominantly in the first 2
years of life (1). Its overall survival in the past three decades has
increased from ~30% to ~70% (2, 3); largely contributed due to
improvement in imaging technology, surgical methods, timely
surgeries, and chemotherapy prescription (4–6). However,
milestone developments for the risk stratification of HB still
lag behind more common pediatric cancers (7).
In the past decades, four separate cooperative multicenter
trial groups have performed systematic treatment studies in HB,
namely, the International Childhood Liver Tumor Strategy
Group (SIOPEL); the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), and
its legacy groups the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) and the
Pediatric Oncology Group (POG); the German Society for
Pediatric Oncology and Haematology (GPOH); and the
Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumors (JPLT) (8).
After accumulating and analyzing large amounts of data, these
organizations proposed that the small cell undifferentiated (SCU)
histology and low serum AFP at diagnosis could be associated
with adverse outcomes in survival (9, 10) and have been
constantly investigating novel prognostic factors (11–14).
However, as the stratification criteria used in each group are
different, it is not possible to compare the prognosis of each
group clearly.
The small number of patients and the use of multiple different
staging systems in the four main trial groups hindered the
comparative evaluation of treatment outcomes in the pediatric
HB trial. To solve this problem, CHIC has established a new
international risk-stratified staging system by analyzing the
database that includes comprehensive data from 1605 children
treated in eight multicenter HB trials over 25 years (15). The new
risk-stratified staging system—the Children’s Hepatic tumors
International Collaboration—Hepatoblastoma Stratification
(CHIC-HS) is shown as stratification trees based on four
clinically familiar PRETEXT groups. CHIC-HS has not only
confirmed the prognostic importance of factors such as
metastatic disease, low AFP concentration (≤100 ng/ml), and
PRETEXT group, that were originally proposed but also
suggested additional new prognostic factors and more detailed
grouping criteria (7).
This study aimed to compare the prognostic ability of the
COG risk stratification system (Table S1) and the CHIC risk
stratification system for prognosticating the survival of Chinese
children with HB (Figure S1).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Ethics Statement
The research was approved by the institutional review board
(IRB) of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC;
Guangzhou, China), the IRB number is B2019-232-01, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patients’ parents involved
in the study. All the original data was deposited on http://www.
researchdata.org.cn (RDD number RDDA2020001362).
Patients
Patients who were diagnosed as HB from January 2014 to
December 2017 at the SYSUCC and the First Affiliated
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) were
identified from our prospective database.
Patients who met all of the following criteria were included in
the study analyses: 1) newly diagnosed patients; 2) age less than
18 years old; 3) histologic confirmation of HB. Since the current
study aimed to analyze the prognostic factors for long-term
survival, we excluded patients who died <30 days following
surgery or died of chemotherapy side effects.
At the time of initial diagnosis, all the parameters mentioned
by risk-stratified staging system were recorded and evaluated as
possible predictors of survivals including age, alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP), metastatic disease (M), macrovascular involvement of all
hepatic veins (V), or portal bifurcation (P), contiguous
extrahepatic tumor (E), multifocal tumor (F), and spontaneous
rupture (R), tumor size and pathological pattern. Tumor size and
VPEFRM were judged by contrast abdominal computed
tomography (CT), abdominal ultrasound scan and intraoperative
conditions. In general, P1 and P2 were defined as P+, V1, V2, and
V3 were defined as V+ (16). None of the patients underwent
liver transplantation.
Chemotherapy
According to the COG risk stratification system, the chemotherapy
regimens of each group were different. Chemotherapy was not
performed in the very low-risk group. The C5V(cisplatin, 5-FU,
vincristine) chemotherapy regimen was used in the low-risk
group for a total of four to six courses. Forty-five patients were
defined as intermediate risk, of whom 30 patients were treated
with the C5V(cisplatin, 5-FU, vincristine)/PLADO(cisplatin,
doxorubicin) chemotherapy regimen, eight patients were
treated with the PLADO(cisplatin, doxorubicin) chemotherapy
regimen, and seven patients were treated with the C5VD
(cisplatin, 5-FU, vincristine, doxorubicin) chemotherapy
Huang et al. CHIC for Hepatoblastoma in China
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 2 November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 552079

regimen for a total of six to eight courses. The C5VD (cisplatin,
5-FU, vincristine, doxorubicin)/IIV (ifosfamide, irinotecan,
vincristine) chemotherapy regimen was used in the high-risk
group for a total of eight courses (Tables S2, S3). Alphafetoprotein (AFP) was assessed before each course of
chemotherapy and tumor efficacy (17) was evaluated every two
courses (CT or MR assessment).
Follow-Up
After the end of treatment, patients were followed-up with a
comprehensive review included alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
complete blood routine, biochemical routine, electrocardiogram,
echocardiography, chest and CT abdomen and so on. In the first
year, patients were followed every 3 months based on assessment
of their alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, complete blood and
biochemical (liver and kidney function and electrolytes) routine
tests, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram.
Abdominal CT and echocardiogram were reviewed every 6
months. Patients were re-examined every 6 months from the
second year and every year from the third year. When a metastasis
was suspected, a chest CT scan, bone scintigraphy, positron
emission tomography (PET), and biopsy (if necessary) were
performed to confirm the metastasis and/or recurrence. The last
follow-up date for patients who were still alive was August 2019.
Causes of death and sites of recurrence were determined from
death certificates, medical interviews, and radiological findings.
The study endpoints were overall survival (OS), defined as the time
period from the date of initial diagnosis until death or last followup, and disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time period from
the date of initial diagnosis until occurrence of an event
(recurrence, progressive disease, death, or diagnosis of a second
malignant neoplasm) or last contact, whichever occurred first.
Statistical Analyses
The statistical analyses except C-index analyses were performed
using the SPSS software, version 19.0 (SPSS Company, Chicago,
Illinois, USA). The OS and DFS were calculated by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The
prognostic varieties in predicting OS and DFS were assessed by
multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. All
covariates that had clinical significance were included in a
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results were given
as mean ± S.D. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a significant
difference was considered for P < 0.05. The concordance index
method (c-index) was used to rank the different risk-stratified
staging systems according to their capacity of discriminating
patients according to the outcome. The c-index was calculated
using R with the rms package (18) of Dr. Frank Harrell.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 100 patients who were diagnosed as HB were identified
during that period. Based on our inclusion criteria, 14 patients
were excluded from this study, of whom two died during the
perioperative period (2%, 2/100), three died while on
chemotherapy (3%,3/100), and nine who were lost in follow-up
(9%, 9/100). The patients’ baseline characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. A total of 86 patients were included in
the study, comprising of 54 (62.8%) male and 32 (37.2%) female,
with a median age at diagnosis of 26.94 months (range: 0.9–139.6
months). AFP was elevated (>100 ng/ml or age-specific upper
limit) in 84 (97.7%) patients. Based on the results of the imaging
studies, patients were classified using the PRETEXT staging
system and judged whether they had distant metastases and
VPEFR. 22 (25.6%) patients had distant metastasis and 44
(51.2%) were positive for VPEFR at diagnosis. Fetal histology
(n=29) was the most common pathological subtype in our
patients on postoperative pathological results. All patients were
classified using the COG risk group and CHIC risk group. Using
the COG risk stratification system, 3 (3.5%) patients were
considered as having very low-risk, 5 (5.8%) as low-risk, 45
(52.3%) as intermediate-risk, and 33 (38.4%) as high-risk. Using
the CHIC risk stratification system, five (5.8%) patients were
considered as having very low risk, 13 (15.1%) as low risk, 38
(44.2%) as intermediate risk, and 33 (38.4) as high risk.

Univariate Analysis of Prognostic Factors
All factors listed in Table 2 were included in univariate analysis
(Table 2), of which, age at diagnosis (OS P=0.029, DFS P=0.027),
PRETEXT staging (OS P<0.001, DFS P<0.001), and metastasis at
diagnosis (OS P<0.001, DFS P=0.007) were identified as
significant prognostic factors for OS and DFS. For OS, the 3-
year OS of patients younger than 36 months, aged from 36
months to 96 months and older than 96 months were 83.4%,
67.6%, and 50.0%, respectively. The 3-year OS of the PRETEXT
stage I, II, III, and IV were 87.5%, 91.4%, 71.4%, and 52.0%. The
3-year OS of M (+) and M (-) were 44.4% and 87.4%. For DFS,
the 3-year DFS of patients from different age groups were 64.7%,
35.9%, and 50.0%, respectively. The 3-year DFS of the PRETEXT
stage I, II, III, and IV were 87.5%, 71.6%, 42.9%, and 20.0%. The
3-year DFS of M (+) and M (-) were 29.2% and 63.0%.
Multivariate Analysis of Prognostic Factors
Multivariate analysis showed that metastasis at diagnosis (HR
3.628, 95% CI 1.404-9.378, P=0.008), PRETEXT staging (HR
2.176, 95% CI 1.230-3.849, P=0.008) and age at diagnosis
(HR 2.268, 95% CI 1.033-4.982, P=0.041) were independent
prognostic factors for OS (Table 3). However, AFP at
diagnosis, VPEFR and histological subtype were not (P>0.05)
for OS. For DFS, multivariate analysis showed that PRETEXT
staging (HR 2.241, 95% CI 1.533-3.277, P<0.001) and age at
diagnosis (HR 1.792, 95% CI 1.018-3.154, P=0.043) were
independent prognostic factors. However, metastasis at
diagnosis, AFP at diagnosis, VPEFR and histological subtype
were not (P>0.05) for DFS (Table 3).
Survival
The median follow-up period was 33.9 months (range 2.4–57.0
months). The 1-, 3-year OS of the 86 investigated patients were
86.0%, 76.3%, respectively (Figure 1A). The median OS was 33.9
months. The 1-, 3-year DFS were 74.4%, 54.0%, respectively
(Figure 1B). The median DFS was 26.6 months.
There was a statistically significant difference between
patients with very low-risk, low-risk, intermediate-risk and
high-risk based on the COG risk stratification system for OS
(P<0.001, Figure 1C). But statistically significant differences
were not observed between patients using the COG risk
stratification system for DFS (P = 0.123, Figure 1D). There
was a statistically significant difference between patients with
very low-risk, low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk using the
CHIC risk stratification system for both OS (P<0.001, Figure 1E)
and DFS (P = 0.001, Figure 1F).
The prognostic value of the COG and CHIC risk stratification
system was compared by means of Harrell’s concordance index.
The CHIC risk stratification system had a higher c-index (OS
0.740, DFS 0.660) compared to the COG risk stratification
system (OS 0.730, DFS 0.600).
DISCUSSION
Based on the proposal of CHIC risk stratification system (7), we
compared the accuracy of the COG risk stratification system to
the CHIC risk stratification system for predicting the prognosis
of Chinese children with HB. First of all, our results showed that
the 1-, 3-year OS of children with HB were 86.0%, 76.3%, and
74.4%, 54.0% in DFS, respectively. What’s more, our study
indicated that age at diagnosis played a significant role in
prognosis for both OS and DFS, along with the PRETEXT
staging and metastasis at diagnosis. Above all, our results
revealed that compared to the COG risk stratification system
we used, the CHIC risk stratification system was better to predict
the survival in children with HB, especially for DFS.
With the use of adjuvant and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,
the 1-, 3-year OS and DFS were 86.0%, 76.3%, and 74.4%, 54.0%
in our cohort, respectively. The literature on the treatment
outcome of children with HB is inadequate. Chinese Children’s

Cancer Group (19) (CCCG) reported 6-year OS of standard risk
and high risk groups were 90.3% ± 2.9% and 67.6 ± 7.0%. Liu
et al. (20) revealed 5-year OS and DFS of children with HB in
Hong Kong were 77.6% ± 5.5% and 69.2% ± 6.1%, respectively.
Qiao et al. (21) showed the 5-year OS and EFS rates were 63.4%
and 57.1%. Recent clinical trials initiated by four major
organizations generally reported that the 3-year OS was above
80% (22). The SIOPEL-4 (23) results suggested that 3-year OS of
children with high-risk HB was 83% and EFS was 76%. The
JPLT-2 (24, 25) study of 279 patients indicated the 3-, 5-year OS
were 82.4%, 80.9%, and 69.9%, 62.4% in DFS, respectively.
Results of the GPOH (26) Study HB99 showed the 5-year OS
was 58% for high risk patients and 94% for standard risk patients.
Similarly, our study also showed unsatisfactory results that
the 3-year OS and DFS were 54.0%, 41.0% for the COG high-risk
group, and 52.1%, 33.5% for the CHIC high-risk group. The
survival of patients in high risk group was gloomy, especially in
DFS. First of all, due to economic and medical limitations, all
high-risk patients had not undergone liver transplantation. Some
data suggested that the overall long-term outcome of primary
liver transplantation for HB was excellent (27). Secondly, the
chemotherapy regimen-C5VD/IIV for high-risk patients in this

study was derived from a clinical trial, which was terminated in
advance due to poor efficacy. In other words, our treatment of
high-risk patients had failed. In addition, the lack of molecular
variables at first diagnosis affected our judgment of prognosis.
Therefore, it’s necessary to seek more effective treatment to
improve the survival of patients in high-risk groups.
Compared to the COG risk stratification system, the CHIC risk
stratification system excluded pathologic subtypes and included
age at diagnosis to form stratification trees based on four clinically
familiar PRETEXT groups. Over the past 10 years, four major
organizations have been devoted to exploring effective prognostic
factors in children with HB (23, 24, 26–29). In 2013, based on a
database involving 1605 HB cases treated between 1988 and 2008
from eight completed HB trials, CHIC identified novel prognostic
factors for HB (15). Advanced PRETEXT group, macrovascular
venous or portal involvement, contiguous extrahepatic disease,
primary tumor multifocality, and tumor rupture significantly
increased risk for EFS-event. Higher age (≥8 years), low AFP
(<100 ng/ml) and metastatic disease significantly increased risk for
OS-event. Recently, CHIC stressed that risk of an event for
children with HB increased with increasing age at diagnosis
(30). In China, several results about the prognostic factors of
children with HB have appeared recently. Qiao et al. (21, 31)
presented AFP <100 or >1000 (ng/ml), multifocality, vascular
invasion, metastases, and PRETEXT stage were associated with
poor prognosis. Another multicentric study demonstrated that
female, age over 5 years, PRETEXT III, PRETEXT IV, incomplete
surgical resection, and with metastasis had poorer prognosis (19).
Our findings confirmed that age at diagnosis played a significant
role in prognosis for both OS and DFS, along with the PRETEXT
staging and metastasis at diagnosis. Although AFP at diagnosis,
VPEFR, and histological subtype did not show statistical
differences in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, but
we cannot deny that these were acknowledged factors associated
with prognosis. In our cohort, only 2 (2.3%) patients had low AFP
(≤100 ng/ml) at diagnosis and no one was confirmed to be SCU
histologic subtype. The absence of the above cases may be the
reason for the non-statistical difference in AFP at diagnosis and
pathological type.
Our results showed that both COG and CHIC risk
stratification systems could effectively predict the prognosis of
children with HB for OS. For DFS, the CHIC risk stratification
system was effective, but the COG risk stratification system was
not. In addition, the CHIC risk stratification system had a higher
c-index (OS 0.743, DFS 0.730), compared to the COG risk
stratification system (OS 0.726, DFS 0.594). Yoon et al. (32)
provided supporting evidence of utility of the CHIC risk
stratification system by providing good prognostic value of its
variables. The study from Hong Kong also demonstrated the
CHIC risk stratification system was effective to classify different
risk groups for predicting the prognosis (20). However, the
results clearly indicated that both the COG and CHIC risk
stratification system did not had good efficacy to distinguish
between the prognosis of very low-risk group and low-risk group.
Therefore, the risk stratification system more suitable for
children with HB in China needs further development.
Our results confirmed good prognostic value of age at
diagnosis, the PRETEXT staging and metastasis at diagnosis.
More importantly, our study validated the feasibility of the risk
stratification system proposed by CHIC and its application to
Chinese children with HB. Although retrospective, the data we
have presented were based on a relatively long duration of followups (median, 33.9 months) from the children who were diagnosed
as HB from January 2014 to December 2017.We also used
sensitive and specific imaging technologies and histological
confirmation in order for us to provide a valid base to evaluate
the prognostic value of the risk stratifications. However, there were
some limitations in the present study that should be commented.
Firstly, it is a single-institution study of a fairly homogenous
population. Due to the rarity of HB, the inadequate number of
cases may be difficult to define several prognostic factors, such as
AFP at diagnosis. Secondly, patients with intermediate-risk, were
offered different chemotherapy regimens which might have
contributed to the differences in patients’ prognosis. Thirdly, our
study did not analyze the effect of molecular variables which would
be potential prognostic factors alternative to clinical factors in the
future. Several prognostic markers have been reported in
associated with HB (22, 33). Sumazin et al. demonstrated high
NFE2L2 activity and high expression of LIN28B, HMGA2, SALL4
were associated with poor prognosis and marked high‐risk group
(34). Another research indicated that the four novel tumor
suppressor candidates including GPR180, MST1R, OCIAD2,
and PARP6 were potentially useful molecular markers for
predicting poor prognosis in HB patients (35). In the future
studies, we should try to include genetic mutation in the
prognostic correlation analysis.
CONCLUSION
In this cohort of Chinese children with HB, age at diagnosis
showed a significant association with patient outcome, along
with the PRETEXT staging and metastasis at diagnosis.
Compared to the COG risk stratification system, the CHIC risk
