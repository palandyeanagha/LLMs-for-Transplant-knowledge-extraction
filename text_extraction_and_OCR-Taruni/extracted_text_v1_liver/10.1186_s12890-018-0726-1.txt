Abstract
Background: We explored the hypothesized importance of early knowledge of microbiological etiology in patients
with pleural infection, including comorbidity and treatment factors in the outcome analyses.
Methods: Data from the medical records of a large cohort of 437 consecutive patients in 9 hospitals in EastDenmark were included retrospectively.
Results: Microbiology, co-morbidity, therapy and outcome are described in detail. Patient groups with
microbiology negative and known bacterial etiology had a similar 30-day and 90-day mortality. There were no
differences in initial antibiotic treatment regimens, antibiotic treatment duration, rate of intra-pleural fibrinolysis
treatment, surgical referral rate, and ICU admittance rate. Patients with microbiology negative etiology were
younger (60.8 vs 64.3 years) and fewer had predisposing risk factors (59% vs 71%), but pleural drainage was more
often delayed (49% vs 36%). Mortality was similar in patients treated with either of the two nationally
recommended initial antibiotic regimens. However, higher 90-day mortality (22.5% vs 9.7%), disease severity (31.5%
vs 6.2%), and ICU admittance rate (21.3% vs 2.9%) was observed in a sub-group with initial broad-spectrum
treatment compared to patients receiving the nationally recommended initial treatments, irrespective of knowledge
of etiology. Several factors correlated independently to 90-day mortality, including age, predisposing risk factors,
surgical referral (Odds-Ratios > 1), drainage delay and intra-pleural fibrinolysis (ORs < 1).
Conclusions: No difference was found between patients with microbiology negative and known bacterial etiology
regarding outcome or treatment parameters. Treatment factors and predisposing factors independently relating to
mortality were found in the cohort. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initially used for treatment of patients with
more severe illness and poorer outcome.

Background
Pleural bacterial infection is most often a complication to
pneumonia, but with an increased morbidity and mortality. Recommended treatment consists of antibiotics and
pleural drainage. Surgical therapy with thoracoscopy and
debridement or decortication may be needed in a minority
of patients to obtain clinical stabilization and treatment
success [1]. An adequate initial antibiotic regimen takes
into account the locally expected spectrum of bacterial
etiology and the antibiotic susceptibility, but this specific
information may not be present in up to 47% of cases with
microbiology negative etiology due to recent outpatient
antibiotic treatment or due to delayed in-hospital sampling [2–4]. An antibiotic treatment duration of 3–6 weeks
has been recommended for pleural infection [1]. In observational studies, the presence of underlying diseases, predisposing risk factors, and treatment factors have been
associated with outcome [1, 4]. In randomized controlled
trials, treatment factors such as active pleural drain irrigation or intra-pleural treatment with a fibrinolytic agent
plus DNase without routine use of active drain irrigation
correlated to outcome [5, 6]. With a limited number of patients included at individual participating centers and not
including all consecutive patients in trials, the possibility
of patient selection bias cannot be excluded [6].
The aim of the study was to investigate whether patients without verified bacterial etiology differed from
patients with known etiology with regard to outcome in
a large cohort of consecutive patients with pleural infection. In addition, the role of predisposing risk factors,
initial antibiotic treatment regimens and other treatment
factors was investigated.
Methods
Study population
All consecutive adult patients (n = 437) admitted with
pleural infection at nine hospitals in Eastern Denmark
without an in-house thoracic surgery department in a
3.5 year period (2008–2011) were included in the Danish
Pleural Empyema Project, geographically covering a population of 1.96 million adults (36% of the Danish population). No patients with pleural infection were admitted
directly to the only tertiary hospital with in-house thoracic
surgery in the region, as patients could only be referred
from satellite hospitals as the actual practice of patient visitation. Patients were identified using three complementary strategies in order to include all patients and to
counteract selection: combining the trial related prospective collection of microbiological samples with the databases of the departments of clinical microbiology,
combined with the ICD-10 codes DJ860 and DJ869 in the
hospital codes of diagnosis at discharge. Microbiological
data was routinely collected and included microscopy, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility. The intention in the
study protocol was prospectively to obtain samples from
all relevant patients in the participating centers and to
freeze samples for later possible bacterial identification by
PCR-technology. Successful freeze samples were obtained
from 72 patients of the cohort, thus adding microbiological information to few poly-microbial samples.
Clinical data included symptoms, history of predisposing risk factors, clinical findings, radiology, biochemical
findings, treatment before and after hospital admission,
timing of and type of therapy, length of hospital stay
(LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admittance, and
all-cause mortality at day 30 and at day 90.
Two patients who were not treated with antibiotics, according to the patient’s wish or by order of the attending
physician, were excluded from the study. Six patients had
missing data on antibiotic treatment and were excluded.
One medical record was missing. Thirteen cases of
pleural infection with attempted but unsuccessful thoracocentesis sampling and with no other positive microbiological sample were included in the analysis of the
whole cohort, but were not included in statistical analyses regarding knowledge of etiology. The 13 patients
with no successful pleural sample for microbiology had a
trend to higher 90 day mortality (29% vs 11.7%, p =
0.054) but did not differ significantly in length of antibiotic treatment, proportion of nosocomial infection,
pre-admission antibiotic treatment, predisposing risk
factor or 30 day mortality (all p > 0.19), when compared
to the rest of the cohort. Length of hospital stay was
shorter (7.6 vs 17 days).
Definitions
Nosocomial or hospital associated infection was defined
according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (CDC) [7].
Severe illness
Hypotension with systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg,
heart rate > 150 beats/min, nasal oxygen-flow above 4 L/
min, other abnormities of severe sepsis, or need for ICU
treatment.
Intra-pleural fibrinolytic treatment
The national guideline at the time from the Danish Society of Pulmonary Medicine (which had BTS guidelines as
a reference) mentioned the possibility of 3 days treatment
with either streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator
(t-PA). Treatment did not include DNase for any patients,
as the study-period was prior to 2012, when superiority of
the combination tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) plus
DNase compared to placebo was demonstrated, with a
similar but non-significant difference with t-PA alone
compared to placebo [6].

Predisposing risk factors or conditions
Alcoholism (ethanol intake > 50 g/day), cancer within
the recent 5 years, hematologic malignancy, severe liver
or renal disease, COPD, immune-deficiency, HIV, diabetes, aspiration tendency caused by neurologic disease,
active or treated rheumatologic disease.
Pleural drainage
The techniques and drain types and sizes used and the
type of medical persons performing the pleural drainage
varied between the 9 participating centers, and at the individual center varied during the time of the day or
weekends. The chosen drain size presumably varied according to the treating physician’s judgement of the individual patients need, though the national guideline
suggested using a minimum 10–14 F drain. According
to the national guideline, flushing of the drain with
minimum 100 ml saline twice daily was recommended.
Delay in thoracocentesis and in pleural drainage
Number of days from detection of pleural effusion on
chest X-ray or CT-scan.
Antibiotic regimens
In the study period, the national and regional Danish recommendations for initial treatment regimens for pleural infection (which were adopted from and inspired by the
current 2003 and 2010 BTS guidelines) were cefuroxime
+/− metronidazole (CEFU) or penicillin/aminopenicillin
+/− metronidazole (PENI), in accordance with the national
clinical microbiological findings and antibiotic susceptibility. We defined broad-spectrum treatment (BROAD) as
these initial antibiotic regimens with further antibiotics
added (most often a quinolone or a macrolide), or the use
of other broad-spectrum regimens (most often meropenem
or piperacillin/tazobactam). Each case was categorized according to the predominant antibiotic treatment (given >
50% of the time) during the first 3 days of treatment.
Bacterial etiology sub-groups
Cases were categorized as streptococci, Staphylococcus
aureus, mixed infection, anaerobes only, enterobacteriaceae, other bacterial etiology, or microbiology negative
etiology. This subgroup division was chosen according
to our earlier publications [3, 4] and was included in the
estimation and decision on sample size of the study.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 7 ®
(StatSoft, Tulsa OK, USA), R-statistics (www.r-project.org),
SPSS (ver 23, IBM Cooperation) or Statcalc (EpiInfo 7.2,
CDC, Atlanta GA, USA). T-test or Mann-Whitney U test
was used for continuous data. Chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis
test was used for categorical data, backward logistic
regression for multivariate outcome analyses. The individual parameters were chosen from the clinically relevant factors in the univariate analyses (from biological plausible
importance and earlier publications) and the planned number of included parameters in the model according to the
estimations of sample size, and estimated outcome frequency in the study design. Interaction analyses were performed as parts of the analyses. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
The main results focus on differences in outcome or
other important variables between cases with microbiology negative etiology and cases with known etiology,
and are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
For the whole cohort (n = 429), mean age was 62.6 years
(SD 14.8), 11.6% of the patients were severely ill (see Definitions) at admittance, with 6.6% admitted to the ICU.
Length of ICU stay was median 6 days (range 1–25). The
infection was hospital associated in 14% of cases, and 43%
of the patients were treated with antibiotics before hospital admittance. Antibiotic treatment was started before
thoracocentesis in 77.8% of the cases. Median duration of
antibiotic treatment after hospital admission was 35 days.
Intra-pleural fibrinolysis treatment was given to 30.2% of
patients. Median length of hospital stay was 17 days (IQR
= 11–25), 30-day mortality was 8.7%, 90-day mortality was
13% and the surgical referral rate was 11.7%.
The categorized bacterial etiology sub-groups consisted of pleural effusions with streptococci (23%),
Staphylococcus aureus (3.7%, all were MSSA), mixed infection (11%, mostly including anaerobes), anaerobes
only (1.8%), enterobacteriaceae (1.8%), other bacterial
etiology (8.2%), and microbiology negative (51%).
Among the 437 consecutive patients with pleural infection, a categorized initial antibiotic regimen was administered to 200 with microbiology negative bacterial
etiology, to 216 with known etiology, and to 13 with no
successfully obtained pleural samples (Tables 1 and 2).
The remaining eight patients could not fulfill the criteria
of initial antibiotic regimen sub-groups.
Descriptives and demographics
Patients with microbiology negative etiology were marginally younger (60.8 vs 64.3 years, p = 0.02), were more
often treated with antibiotics prior to thoracocentesis
(89.1% vs 76.4%, p < 0.001), and fewer had pre-defined
risk factors (59% vs 71%, p < 0.01) compared to patients
with known etiology, but had similar length of hospital
stay (16 vs 18 days, p = 0.22) (Table 1).
The other recorded severity factors did not differ significantly between patients with microbiology negative
and known bacterial etiology: The proportions of patients with severe disease, with nosocomial infection, or

the proportion treated with antibiotics before hospital
admission were comparable (all p > 0.21) (Table 1).
For the whole cohort, patients with broad-spectrum
initial treatment regimens were more often severely ill
(31.5% vs 6.2%) and more frequently admitted to the
ICU (21.3% vs 2.9%) than patients treated with the nationally recommended initial regimens PENI or CEFU,
all p < 0.0001 (Table 2). This was also demonstrated separately in each patient sub-category of microbiology
negative or known etiology, all p < 0.001 (Table 1).
Therapy
The nationally recommended initial antibiotic regimens
PENI (29%) or CEFU (50%) dominated over broad
spectrum therapy (21%), and the distribution of these
three regimens were similar in patients with known and
microbiology negative etiology, (Tables 1 and 2). Patients
with microbiology negative and known etiology had a
comparable median duration of antibiotic therapy (35 vs
38 days, p = 0.30), proportion of intrapleural fibrinolytic
treatment (30% vs 34%, p = 0.43), and a similar proportion
of surgical referral (14.3% vs 14.8%, p = 0.88) (Table 1). Patients with microbiology negative etiology had a longer
delay until thoracocentesis (median 2.5 days vs 1 day, p <
0.01) and more often a delay in drainage > 2 days (49% vs
36%, p = 0.02).
Outcome
The length of hospital stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, 90-day
mortality, need for surgical referral, or ICU-admittance did
not differ between patients with microbiology negative and
known etiology (all p > 0.20) (Table 1).
In the univariate analyses, 30-day and 90-day mortality
did not differ significantly between the six microbiological sub-groups of known etiology (7.9% vs 6.3% vs
0% vs 12.5% vs 12.5% vs 8.3% p = 0.85; 9.9% vs 18.8% vs
12.5% vs 14.6% vs 25% vs 19.4% p = 0.65). When including microbiologic sub-groups in a logistic regression
model (203 cases with known etiology) with age, predisposing risk factor status, nosocomial status, pleural drain
delay > 2 days, and intra-pleural fibrinolysis, the microbiologic sub-group parameter was not independently
correlated to 30-day or 90-day mortality (p = 0.63 and, p
= 0.90, respectively).
Comparing patients treated with the two recommended initial therapy regimens (PENI group vs CEFU
group), there were no significant differences in LOS,
30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, surgical referral, or
ICU admittance, neither in the whole cohort or separately in patients with microbiology negative or known
etiology (all p > 0.11) (Tables 1 and 2).
Patients treated with a broad-spectrum initial regimen
trended to have a higher 30-day (14.6% vs 6.8%, p =
0.06), and had a higher 90-day mortality (22.5% vs 9.7%,
p < 0.01) compared to patients receiving PENI or CEFU,
in the whole cohort (Table 2) and separately in the
group with microbiology negative etiology, with a similar
trend not reaching statistical significance in the group
with known etiology (Table 1).
In univariate analyses, 30-day and 90-day mortality in
the whole cohort (the actual direction and size of
odds-ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI)
are presented in Table 3) correlated to mean age (71 vs
61.3 years and 72 vs 61.7 years, respectively; both p <
0.001), pre-disposing risk factors (OR = 4.4 [1.5–12.7]
and 5.7 [2.2–14.5], both p < 0.003), intra-pleural fibrinolysis (OR = 0.17 [0.05–0.58] and 0.35 [0.16–0.72], both
p < 0.006). In addition, the 90-day mortality correlated to
nosocomial infection (OR = 2.3 [1.16–4.5], p = 0.01),
pleural drainage delay > 2 days (OR = 0.40 [0.20–0.83], p
< 0.02), but did not reach significantly correlation to referral for surgery (OR = 2.0 [0.97–4.2], p = 0.055).
The multivariate outcome analyses included age, predisposing risk factors, nosocomial infection, pleural
drainage delay > 2 days, intra-pleural fibrinolysis, and referral to surgery in the model (direction and size of ORs
and CIs are presented in Table 3). The 30-day mortality
correlated independently to age (OR = 1.06 [1.03–1.10],
p < 0.0001), intra-pleural fibrinolysis (OR = 0.19 [0.04–
0.54], p = 0.007), predisposing risk factors (OR = 3.3
[1.3–11.9], p = 0.03), and pleural drainage delay (OR =
0.33 [0.16–0.92], p = 0.04). The 90-day mortality correlated independently to age (OR = 1.06 [1.04–1.09], p <
0.0001), predisposing risk factors (OR = 4.2 [1.7–12.6], p =
0.004), referral to surgery (OR = 3.1 [1.2–7.3], p = 0.01) with
ORs > 1, and pleural drainage delay (OR = 0.33 [0.15–0.68],
p = 0.005), intra-pleural fibrinolysis (OR = 0.35 [0.14–0.77],
p = 0.01) with OR < 1. (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, there were 200 or more patients with pleural
infection in each of the two etiology groups, and the bacterial findings were similar to recent European studies [1].
The more severe illness and poorer outcome in the group
of patients initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics
most probably reflects clinical decisions based on the severity of the condition at admission to hospital. But because
the rate of fibrinolysis or the rate of referral to surgery were
not significantly different in this broad-spectrum group, the
detrimental outcome may rather be due to a systemic sepsis
effect of the disease.
By definition, change in antibiotic treatment within a
few days according to results of susceptibility testing is
not an option in cases with microbiology negative etiology and this may theoretically affect outcome. In our
study, patients with microbiology negative etiology were
more often treated with antibiotics before thoracocentesis, and the effect of antibiotics before microbiological
Meyer et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018) 18:160 Page 5 of 8

sampling may account for this fact. In clinical practice,
the physician’s motivation for swift pleural drainage may
also depend on the presumed effusion volume and of
disease severity in the individual patient; apart from the
possible delay caused by lack in recognition of the condition. The slightly younger age, lower rate of predisposing risk factors (underlying diseases), and the trend
towards fewer nosocomial infections in patients with
microbiology negative etiology could bias prognosis towards a better outcome. On the other hand, the delay in
initiating pleural drainage theoretically could result in a
poorer outcome. Even though all other medical and surgical treatment measures and severity measures in this
study were similar between patients with known and
microbiology negative etiology, we were pleased to find
that all outcome measures were comparable in the two
groups. Thus, we could not confirm a hypothesized difference in outcome according to whether etiology was
known or microbiologically negative.
In the literature, not many large studies (with more
than 150 patients) have been published regarding pleural
infection in adults, and, to our knowledge, none focused
on the correlation between knowledge of etiology and
clinical outcome. Compared to a large randomized controlled British study (MIST-1) [8] of intra-pleural
streptokinase treatment in 430 patients with pleural infection, the patients in our cohort were of similar age
(62.5 vs 60.5 years) and had similar outcomes with regard to 3 month’s mortality (13% vs 15%), referral rate
for surgery (11.7% vs 15%), and LOS (17 day vs
12.5 days). In the MIST-1 trial, disease severity or outcome was not reported according to microbiology negative or known etiology, and a direct comparison to our
cohort is therefore not possible [8]. The randomized
MIST-2 trial cohort with 193 included patients reported
a similar age (59 vs 62.5 years) and referral rate for surgery (16% vs 11.7%), but a lower 3 month’s mortality (8%
vs 13%) and a similar length of hospital stay (20 vs
17 days) [6]. In the MIST-2 trial, outcomes were reported according to the four intra-pleural treatment
randomization arms and were not categorized or reported according to knowledge of etiology [6]. A Danish
study of 158 patients from a 9 year period just prior to
our study period reported only cases of verified etiology.
Compared to the present study, patients had similar age
(63 years vs 62.5), a higher mortality (27% vs 13%), a
longer hospital stay (29 days vs 17 days), a higher
ICU-admittance rate (17% vs 6.6%) and more referrals to
surgery (34% vs 11.7%) [4]. Further publications with
large cohorts of patients with pleural empyema were not
found for possible comparison with our study regarding
the main question of disease severity or outcome according to knowledge of etiology.
The outcome analyses in our study demonstrated
independent correlations between mortality and high
age, referral to surgery, predisposing risk factors
(OR > 1), and delayed pleural drainage more than
2 days, and intra-pleural fibrinolysis (OR < 1). Because the treatment factors were not randomized in
this retrospective study, the causal relations will be
rather hypothetical, despite controlling for factors included in the multivariate analysis. One can expect,
that the attending physicians have judged the need
for and the possibility of some interventions (f.ex.
intentional or unintentional delay in drainage, referral for surgery, or intra-pleural fibrinolysis) differently according to disease acuteness, disease severity,
the frailness of the patient, and the sufficient or the
insufficient improvement in the individual patient.
Also, lack of timely recognition of the condition may
be a factor in some cases.
Regarding a possible improvement in outcome using
initial treatment with early thoracoscopic debridement, a
few small studies have demonstrated promising results
of reduced length of hospital stay compared to initial
treatment with pleural drainage [9, 10]. Larger and better powered randomized trials are needed in order to
clarify the potential role of early pleural debridement in
the adult population. However, early thoracoscopic debridement was not a therapeutic option in our hospitals.

In analogy with PSI, CURB-65, SOFA and other prognostic scores in pneumonia, the RAPID-score (renal
failure, age, non-purulence, (hospital acquired) infection source, dietary factors (=low albumin)) was recently developed as a prognostic score in patients with
pleural infection and includes 5 non-interventional factors [11]. The renal parameter used (blood urea nitrogen) was not routinely assessed at admission to our
hospitals, and thus, the RAPID-score could not be evaluated in our cohort. In our study-cohort, we did find
association of mortality to the available RAPID parameters age and nosocomial infection, but we did not separate out renal insufficiency or malnutrition as
individual factors (from the predisposing factors) in our
multi-variate analyses. Recently, the RAPID-score was
validated in a not very typical study-cohort of all ages
with a large number of Staphylococcus aureus infections (40%) and nosocomial infections (41%) among
187 culture-positive patients, assessing stratified mortality risk at 3 months, but also at 1 year, 3 year and
5 year [12]. The stratification power was more pronounced at 3 months and in the sub-group of patients
treated with invasive surgery [12].
The main strengths of our study are the sample size
and the completeness of the cohort using several
strategies for patient inclusion. Although we used the
databases of clinical microbiology and the national
clinical diagnosis register, and attempted prospective
inclusion, we cannot rule out the possibility of missing cases due to mislabeling in the national clinical
diagnosis register in culture-negative cases of pleural
infection. Our study has inborn limitations (including
some missing data) due to the predominantly retrospective mode of data collection.
As the occurrence of the time-dependent covariates
(f.ex. delayed drainage > 2 days, referral to surgery) are
possible always in the surviving sub-group but may only
be possible in some patients in the dying group (if the
intended intervention is not delayed before the outcome
of death), the immortal time bias is a possible limitation
in the logistic regression mortality analysis. Among the
56 dying patients in our cohort with four patients dying
within 2 days, two were drained and the two others were
left to palliative care without drainage. The referral to
surgery factor was not documented as an unfulfilled
intention in the medical charts in any of the dying patients, but missing documentation cannot be ruled out.
Thus, we suggest that the covariate delayed drainage >
2 days did not suffer from immortal time bias of clinical
importance. A potential shortcoming of the analysis in
our database is that the possible immortal time bias
could not be estimated for the covariate referral to surgery, and therefore effect estimates of referral to surgery
should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusion
This study adds outcome results, clinical data and treatment information regarding the serious and often complicated condition of pleural infection from a large patient
cohort. Comparing patients with microbiology negative
and known bacterial etiology, no differences were found
in observed mortalities, in underlying disease severity, initial antibiotic treatment type, total treatment duration, or
in the rate of surgical referral. Thus, lack of data on etiology and antibiotic susceptibility in many of the patients
did not signal a change in outcome in a geographical area
with expectedly well-functioning health-care facilities and
limited problems of antibiotic resistance, though the limitations of a retrospective design precludes from conclusions on causation.
