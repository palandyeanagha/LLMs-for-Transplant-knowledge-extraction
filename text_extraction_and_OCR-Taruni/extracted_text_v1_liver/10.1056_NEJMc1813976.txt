The authors reply: Caputo and colleagues agree 
with us that short-acting benzodiazepines are 
the cornerstone for treating patients with the 
alcohol withdrawal syndrome. They suggest that 
we ought to have included sodium oxybate (the 
sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyric acid [GHB]) 
among the alternative therapies. Sodium oxybate 
is approved for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in Italy and Austria and for the 
treatment of narcolepsy in the United States.1 In 
addition to space constraints, we did not include 
sodium oxybate among the potential alternative 
treatments, mainly because of its potential for 
abuse and its adverse-effect profile.2 In addition 
to the references cited by Caputo and colleagues, 
a recent article published after our manuscript 
went to press reported pooled data from 3436 
patients with alcohol dependence and a pharmacovigilance database involving more than 260,000 
patients with alcohol dependence who had been 
treated with sodium oxybate with very few adverse side effects and only a few cases of abuse.1
In a review article published 20 years ago in the 
Journal, another Italian researcher argued for the 
inclusion of GHB as a potential treatment for 
the alcohol withdrawal syndrome and for relapse 
prevention.3 We believe that benzodiazepines are 
the drug of choice and that sodium oxybate could 
be considered, at best, as an option for treatment when other established medications are 
not appropriate.
Rathi and colleagues share their perspective 
on the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. This is a 
matter that we did not discuss in our article 
because we believed it was beyond its scope. We 
agree with Rathi and colleagues that there is a 
need for exploration of new therapies beyond 
glucocorticoids and pentoxifylline, given that, as 
we noted in our article, patients with alcoholic 
hepatitis have a poor prognosis and very few 
patients will eventually benefit from liver transplantation.

Antibody-Mediated Rejection of Solid-Organ Allografts
To the Editor: The comprehensive review article by Loupy and Lefaucheur (Sept. 20 issue)1
 on 
antibody-mediated rejection describes major advances in understanding the pathophysiological 
process and diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection, but successful treatment is still limited 
to the acute forms of antibody-mediated rejection.2
 Allograft loss eventually occurs in the majority of patients in whom true pathogenic donorspecific anti-HLA antibodies develop.3
 This is 
frustrating for both clinicians and patients because even treatments administered at early stages 
of the disease are not effective. It is quite obvious 
that the best strategy to minimize the risk of 
donor-specific antibodies is to improve the level 
of HLA matching between the donor and recipient.4
 This point was omitted in the article.
Recent studies suggest that molecular HLA 
eplet matching could reduce the risk of the development of donor-specific antibodies.5
 Since class 
II rather than class I donor-specific antibodies 
are associated with chronic antibody-mediated 
rejection, this strategy to achieve HLA class II 
molecular matching appears to be feasible. The

To the Editor: In the review article by Loupy 
and Lefaucheur, the assertion that antibodies are 
a major cause of acute and chronic rejection of 
solid-organ allografts is not substantiated. Aside 
from rare cases of hyperacute or accelerated rejection in HLA-sensitized patients,1
 a causal relationship between antibodies and rejection has not 
been established.
“Antibody-mediated rejection,” as described by 
Loupy and Lefaucheur, occurs more commonly 
in association with or after cellular rejection 
than in isolation.2 It is frequently diagnosed in 
the absence of circulating donor-specific antiHLA antibodies or evidence of antibody binding 
to graft tissue. The histologic criteria used to 
infer the presence of antibodies, including C4d, 
are not specific. In a study of heart transplantation, even when antibody binding was detected 
histologically, it was associated with graft dysfunction in fewer than 5% of patients.3
 Antibody-targeting therapies do not reverse “antibodymediated rejection,” and in anecdotal cases in 
which improvement was observed, the effect of 
therapy on nonhumoral immunity could not 
be ruled out. Finally, in studies in animals, the 
absence of antibodies has not been shown to 
prevent lesions associated with “antibody-mediated rejection.”4
 Therefore, the term “antibodymediated rejection” should be used with caution 
until scientific causation is established. Mislabeling could misguide scientific investigations and 
trigger unwarranted interventions.

The authors reply: In reply to Cruzado: our 
review article focused on recent insights regarding the diagnosis and clinical presentation of 
antibody-mediated rejection and the resulting 
clinically actionable biomarkers for monitoring 
and therapeutic follow-up of patients who receive 
transplants. The potential for new allocation 
policies aimed at reducing the incidence of allograft rejection, including HLA matching at the 
eplet level, is an interesting but complex subject 
that would require a dedicated overall review to 
be fully addressed. Moreover, the feasibility of 
such precise HLA matching in the time-sensitive, 
real-world setting of current allocation logistics 
remains to be developed.
We strongly disagree with the comments by 
Lakkis et al., since antibody-mediated rejection 
exists as a clinical entity primarily caused by 
circulating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies. 
Although anti-HLA antibodies have been linked 
to a spectrum of pathogenicity, robust data from 
numerous clinical and basic studies published in 
the past three decades provide support for the

causality of anti-HLA antibodies in antibodymediated rejection.1
 Many criteria for evidence of 
causation as applied to antibody-mediated rejection have been met, including the strength of the 
effect size, consistency and reproducibility, specificity, a strong biologic gradient, a dose-dependent effect, additional biologic plausibility, and 
experimental models in animals that indicate 
causation (Table 1).2
In our review article, the definition of antibody-mediated rejection in kidney, lung, heart, 
liver, and pancreas transplantation was consistent with that used by the Banff classification of 
kidney allograft rejection and the classification 
of the International Society for Heart and Lung 
Transplantation. Beyond providing a standardized nomenclature, these classifications base the 
diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection on a 
combination of several markers (antibodies, pathological and immunochemical features, and 
gene expression) that are directly derived from 
the evidence described above. Regarding the 
comment on antibody-negative antibody-mediated rejection, these phenotypes are far less 
frequent in clinical practice than those related 
to HLA antibodies3
 and do not rule out the 
presence of other non-HLA pathogenic antibodies.4
 Finally, the experience of clinicians 
who treat patients with antibody-mediated rejection as well as results published in the recent 
literature are not in line with the assertion by 
Lakkis and colleagues regarding an “anecdotal” 
efficacy of antibody-targeting therapies. These 
findings indicate that more than two thirds of 
patients with active antibody-mediated rejection 
after kidney transplantation have had a response 
to antibody-targeting treatment leading to allograft survival.3,5
Criterion Evidence
Strength of effect size 
and reproducibility
Strength of association and independence of effect have been reproduced with consis‑
tency in studies, including large meta-analyses.
Specificity Complement-dependent cross-matching that avoids cytotoxic donor-specific anti-HLA 
antibodies has dramatically reduced the occurrence of acute antibody-mediated re‑
jection and nearly eliminated hyperacute rejection.
Capillary deposition of complement fraction C4d has a high specificity for antibody ac‑
tivation of complement.
Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies are associated with basement-membrane injuries in 
peritubular and glomerular capillaries that are lesions of chronic humoral rejection.
Experimental evidence Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies have been detected in tissue eluates from rejected 
kidneys.
Passive transfer of complement-activating antibodies causes C4d deposition and anti‑
body-mediated rejection.
Passive transfer of non–complement-activating antibodies does not cause C4d deposi‑
tion and antibody-mediated rejection.
Models in animals show that donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies mediate allograft vas‑
cular lesions with natural killer cells if T cells are lacking.
Temporality Preexisting donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies correlate with the occurrence of antibodymediated rejection soon after transplantation.
The appearance of new-onset donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies precedes acute and 
chronic antibody-mediated rejection.
Studies involving cynomolgus monkeys have shown the sequence from donor-specific 
anti-HLA antibodies to acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection.
Biologic gradient Complement-activating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (C1q, C3d, C4d, and IgG3 
subclass) correlate with antibody-mediated rejection, disease activity, and outcome.
Models in animals have shown that antibody-mediated rejection is reproducibly induced 
by passive transfer of complement-activating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies 
with a dose-dependent effect.
Coherence and analogy Similar associations between donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies and antibody-mediated 
rejection have been shown in kidney, lung, heart, and pancreas composite tissue 
transplantation and liver transplantation.
