Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. Several
nutraceuticals have shown interesting clinical results in HF prevention as well as in the treatment of the early stages of the disease, alone
or in combination with pharmacological therapy. The aim of the present expert opinion position paper is to summarise the available clinical
evidence on the role of phytochemicals in HF prevention and/or treatment that might be considered in those patients not treated optimally as
well as in those with low therapy adherence. The level of evidence and the strength of recommendation of particular HF treatment options
were weighed up and graded according to predefined scales. A systematic search strategy was developed to identify trials in PubMed (January
1970 to June 2019). The terms ‘nutraceuticals’, ‘dietary supplements’, ‘herbal drug’ and ‘heart failure’ or ‘left verntricular dysfunction’ were
used in the literature search. The experts discussed and agreed on the recommendation levels. Available clinical trials reported that the intake
of some nutraceuticals (hawthorn, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, D-ribose, carnosine, vitamin D, probiotics, n-3 PUFA and beet nitrates) might

stroke volume and cardiac output in HF patients, with minimal or no side effects. Those benefits tended to be greater in earlier HF stages.
Available clinical evidence supports the usefulness of supplementation with some nutraceuticals to improve HF management in addition to

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) prevalence in the USA is about 5 million individuals(1), while it affects more than 23 million individuals worldwide(2). HF is the main factor responsible for hospitalisation and
disability in the elderly and is the cause of one in nine deaths in
the USA(3). Consequently, HF imposes a great problem to the
healthcare system, amounting to more than $39 billion annually
in the USA(3). In Europe, the prevalence and incidence of HF, and
related costs, are quite similar(4,5). Even though there have
been relevant improvements in HF prevention and treatment,
quality of life (QoL) is often impaired and mortality rates are
greater than 10 % per year, reaching 20–50 % in more advanced
disease(6).
HF is attributed mainly to four underlying conditions: hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and valvular
heart disease(1,2); however, genetic causes, particularly in dilated
cardiomyopathy, also play an immense role(7). Still, HF could
be partly prevented by improving lifestyle, while an improvement in lifestyle is also suggested when HF has already been
diagnosed(8,9). Therapeutic lifestyle changes include adherence
to a Mediterranean diet, a reduced-Na diet or Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as well as exercise training(10,11),
which are able to reduce the risk of developing HF and improve
endothelial function, exercise capacity and QoL in HF patients(12).
In particular, the DASH diet can protect against HF risk by as
much as 29 %(13). Moreover, weight loss, moderation of alcohol
consumption and increased aerobic exercise are recommended
measures(14).
In recent years, epidemiological studies and clinical trials
have investigated the possibility that some dietary supplements
and phytochemicals (overall referred to as natural products or
nutraceuticals) can contribute to the improvement of HF-related
symptoms (Fig. 1).
The aim of this position paper is to provide, for the first time,
physicians and nutrition experts with a practical tool presenting
the scientific evidence on efficacy and safety of nutraceuticals,
eventually supporting their use as further HF symptoms improvers, as an add-on to optimal pharmacological treatment.
Methods
A systematic search strategy was developed to identify randomised clinical trials (RCT) and their meta-analyses in Medline/
PubMed (January 1970 to June 2019). The terms ‘nutraceuticals’,
‘dietary supplements’, ‘herbal drug’ and ‘heart failure’ were
incorporated into an electronic search strategy. The experts discussed and agreed on the recommended levels. For each
selected nutraceutical, a short description of the mechanism of
action is reported, followed by the clinically observed effects
and the most relevant tolerability notes.
The level of evidence of nutraceuticals tested on HF patients
has been weighed up and graded according to predefined
scales, as outlined in Table 1. Due to the fact of the limited data
the experts did not decide to evaluate each selected nutraceutical with the class of the evidence. The experts of the writing
and reviewing panels completed declaration of interest forms
where real or potential sources of conflicts of interest might
be perceived.
Nutraceuticals
Coenzyme Q10
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an organic molecule, which is composed of a lipophilic core (benzoquinone) and an isoprenoid
side chain; it was identified in 1940 and isolated for the first time
from beef heart mitochondria by Frederick Crane of Wisconsin
(USA), in 1957(15). CoQ10 (10 refers to the number of isoprene
repeats) is synthesised endogenously, starting from tyrosine
and acetylcoenzyme A; it is universally present in the cells of
the body, particularly concentrated in the mitochondria, in both
reduced form (ubiquinol) and oxidised form (ubiquinone). The
level of CoQ10 is highest in organs with high rates of metabolism
such as the heart, kidney and liver (114, 66·5 and 54·9 μg/g tissue,
respectively), where it functions as an energy transfer molecule(16). The overall body content of CoQ10 is only about
500–1500 mg and decreases with age. It is naturally contained
in oily fish (such as salmon and tuna), organ meats (such as liver
and heart) and whole grains, but it can be consumed also as a
dietary supplement(17).
By functioning as a reducing equivalent transfer agent
between cytochromes in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain, CoQ10 play a crucial role in oxidative phosphorylation
(i.e. ATP biosynthesis). CoQ10 is also the only lipid-soluble antioxidant that slows lipid peroxidation in the circulation (by maintaining the reduced state of α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid)(18).
Other functions of CoQ10 include stabilisation of Ca-dependent
channels, cell signalling and cell growth through local regulation
of cytosolic redox intermediates such as reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)(19). Since CoQ10 is
an essential cofactor for ATP biosynthesis, it is not surprising that
the highest concentration, compared with other tissues, is
focused in myocardial mitochondria(16). Thus, it has been proposed that CoQ10 deficiency could play an aetiopathogenic role
in the development and progression of HF.
CoQ10 bioavailability is extremely variable depending on
dosage, particle size, formulation, the release method and the
156 A. F. G. Cicero et al.
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422420000049 Published online by Cambridge University Press

mode of administration (for example with or without water,
before or after meals)(20). In particular, ubiquinol (the reduced
form) seems to be the most available form of CoQ10, especially
if conveyed through micelles, liposomes, nano-emulsions, polymeric or solid lipid nanoparticles, solid and aqueous dispersions,
or nanostructured lipid carriers supplemented in the fed
state(21,22). However, because of its hydrophobicity and large
molecular weight, absorption of dietary CoQ10 is slow and limited. The time taken to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax)
is about 6 h, with an elimination half-life of about 33 h. The reference intervals for plasma CoQ10 range from 0·40 to 1·91 μmol/l
in healthy adults(23,24). Finally, in a recent paper by L ´opez-Lluch
et al.(25), the level of bioavailability of seven different formulations of CoQ10 was measured over 48 h after ingestion of 100
mg. The two best absorbable formulations were soft-gel capsules
containing ubiquinone or ubiquinol. The increase in plasma levels (at 4 and 8 h) was higher after intake of 100 mg ubiquinone
when compared with all other formulations(25).
Clinical evidence. The lowest levels of myocardial CoQ10 have
been observed in patients of New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class IV and the highest levels in patients of NYHA
class I(26,27). The Q-SYMBIO trial (Q10-SYMptoms, BIomarker
status [Brain-Natriuretic Peptide], and long-term Outcome
[hospitalizations/mortality])(28) was a multicentre, randomised
placebo-controlled trial, which assessed the impact of the daily
intake of CoQ10 on total mortality and not just on the surrogate
endpoints. A group of 420 patients, with moderate or severe HF
for a period of 2 years, were treated with 300 mg of CoQ10
(ubiquinone) (n 202) or placebo (n 218). At the end of treatments they benefited from a significant reduction in major
adverse cardiac events (15 % of the patients in the CoQ10 group
v. 26 % in the placebo group; hazard ratio (HR) 0·50; 95 % CI 0·32,
0·80; P = 0·003), cardiovascular mortality (9 v. 16 %; P = 0·026),
all-cause mortality (10 v. 18 %; P = 0·018) and incidence of hospital stays for HF (P = 0·033)(28). A recent meta-analysis of
fourteen RCT including 2149 patients has shown that administration of CoQ10 reduces mortality risk (pooled risk ratio = 0·69;
95 % CI 0·50, 0·95; P = 0·02; I
2 = 0 %) and helped in improving
exercise capacity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0·62;
95 % CI 0·02, 0·30; P = 0·04; I
2 = 54 %) compared with placebo.
Moreover, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) also
improved in CoQ10-treated subjects compared with controls
(SMD 0·62; 95 % CI 0·02, 1·12; P = 0·04; I
2 = 75 %)(29), partially
in contrast with what was reported in a previous meta-analysis
including fewer studies(30).

The heterogeneity of results obtained on EF may therefore be
partly explained by many factors such as the diversity of CoQ10
supplemented through different pharmaceutical forms and
dosages (CoQ10 plasma concentrations are very variable and
were reported in few RCT)(31-33), diversity of HF grade of patients
enrolled (NYHA I–IV), duration of treatment and co-treatment
with conventional therapies. In particular, it has been suggested
that blood CoQ10 concentrations should be >2 μg/ml to improve
EF in subjects with more severe HF(34). Moreover, it seems that
the CoQ10 effect on LVEF could be more relevant in patients
untreated with statins and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (þ6·7 %) compared with the subgroup of patients
treated with these drugs (þ1·2 %)(35). Finally, CoQ10 lowers
the need for inotropic drugs and reduces the appearance of
ventricular arrhythmias after surgery in the prevention of complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery(36) (Table 2).
Based on the available studies, CoQ10 has a high safety profile and at doses ranging from 60 to 600 mg/d does not cause
clinically relevant adverse events(37,38).
Expert opinion. Available meta-analyses support that supplementation with CoQ10 (especially with doses ≥200 mg/d) can
be of benefit in patients with chronic HF, in particular in early
stage of HF, and might effect a reduction of major adverse
cardiac events and total mortality.
Hawthorn flavonoid fraction
Hawthorn extract from Crataegus monogyna and oxyacantha is
a flavonoid-rich herbal remedy with known anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, inotropic and coronary vasodilator effects(39). The
most studied dry ethanol (45 %) extract of hawtorn leaves with
flowers is WS 1442 (drug:extract ratio 4–6·6:1) which contains
17·3–20·1 % oligomeric procyanidins and several flavonoids,
including hyperoside, vitexin-rhamnoside, rutin and vitexin as
well as triterpenoids and phenol carboxylic acids(40). In vitro
experiments with human myocardial tissue demonstrated a
positive inotropic effect of hawthorn with a concentrationdependent increase of myocardial contractility accompanied
by a transient rise in intracellular Ca(41). The effect is probably
mediated by cyclic AMP-independent inhibition of Na-KATPase and is accompanied by an improved energy turnover
of myocytes(42,43); however, in contrast to cardiac glycosides,
hawthorn prolongs the potential action and the refractory
period, thus possessing pronounced anti-arrhythmic properties
which have been especially evaluated in animal models(44).
Hawthorn extract WS 1442 has also been shown to raise
endothelial Ca levels by inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
reticulum Ca2þ-ATPase (SERCA) and activation of the inositol
trisphosphate (IP3) pathway, protecting against thrombininduced vascular barrier dysfunction and subsequent oedema
formation(45).

Clinical evidence. The Survival and Prognosis: Investigation of
Crataegus Extract WS 1442 in congestive heart failure (SPICE)
trial has investigated the effect of 900 mg/d of WS 1442 on
mortality and hospitalisation rate in NYHA class II–III HF with
reduced EF (HFrEF) patients, in a 24-month, randomised,
placebo-controlled trial. A total of 2681 patients (WS 1442:
n 1338; placebo: n 1343) were randomised and the primary endpoint was time till the first cardiac event. The authors showed
that there was an insignificant trend towards cardiac mortality
reduction with WS 1442 (11 % at month 24; HR 0·89; 95 % CI
0·73, 1·09; P = 0·269). However, in the subgroup with LVEF
≥25 %, WS 1442 reduced sudden cardiac death by 41 % (HR
0·59; 95 % CI 0·37, 0·94) at month 24; P = 0·025). Current data
suggest that WS 1442 can potentially reduce the incidence of
sudden cardiac death, at least in patients with less compromised
LV function(46,47).
Some meta-analyses of RCT investigated the efficacy of hawthorn extract on different HF parameters. One investigated the
effects of hawthorn supplementation (900 and 1800 mg/d
groups) on maximum workload; the results showed a statistically
significant increase over placebo by a weighted mean difference
(WMD) of 5·4 (95 % CI 0·7, 10·0) W (P = 0·024). Moreover, at the
end of the treatment phase, the treatment group differences
compared with placebo for score change (four ‘typical’ HF symptoms, i.e. general capability, lassitude, early fatigability and
effort dyspnoea) v. baseline were both significant for WS 1442
doses 900 mg/d (P = 0·04) and 1800 mg/d (P = 0·004)(48). A
Cochrane meta-analysis of RCT concluded that treatment with
hawthorn compared with placebo was more beneficial for the
physiological outcome of maximal workload (WMD = 5·35
(95 % CI 0·71, 10·00) W; P<0·02; n 380), exercise tolerance
(WMD = 122·76 (95 % CI 32·74, 212·78) W × min; n 98) and
the pressure–heart rate product, an index of cardiac oxygen consumption (WMD = –19·22 (95 % CI –30·46, –7·98) mmHg/min;
n 264). Furthermore, shortness of breath and fatigue were also
significantly improved (WMD = –5·47, 95 % CI –8·68, –2·26;
n 239)(49). These results were confirmed by a more recent
meta-analysis of RCT that evaluated the data of >600 patients
treated with quantified Crataegus extract or placebo; the subjects of the active group showed improvements in physiological
outcome parameters, in particular in maximal workload, LVEF
and pressure–heart rate product increase (PHRPI) at 50 W ergometric exercise. Moreover, the results on LVEF were independent from baseline data, while maximal workload and PHRPI
were demonstrated to be related to baseline severity. Typical
symptoms of HF patients, like reduced exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnoea, weakness, fatigue and palpitations, were
improved more with active treatment and in subjects with more
severe symptoms at baseline(50) (Table 3).
The recommended daily dose of hawthorn extract is
320–900 mg (and active daily doses 160–1800 mg) to be taken
in two or three doses per d. Adverse events reported were mild,
transient and infrequent and in general comparable with
placebo, including mild rash, headache, sweating, dizziness
and gastrointestinal symptoms(51).
Expert opinion. According to clinical evidence, Crataegus
extracts have proven benefits regarding functional capacity,
symptom control and health-related QoL in both HFrEF and
HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). However, further studies are
required, as a large proportion of the positive data has been
obtained in patients not pharmacologically treated with the current standards of HF management.
n-3 PUFA
Accumulating evidence suggests that supplementation with n-3
PUFA could exert some positive effects in HF patients, especially
during the early stages of the disease. Among the possible mechanisms of action that might be responsible for this is the possible

role of the fatty acids EPA and DHA that have a direct action on
the mitochondrial membrane, modifying its structure and function(52-54). In particular, dietary supplementation with DHA at a
clinically relevant dose increases DHA incorporation into phospholipids of the mitochondrial membrane and decreases the
susceptibility of isolated cardiac mitochondria to undergo mitochondrial permeability transition induced by Ca2þ and stress(55).
DHA could in fact decrease viscosity of the membrane and a
greater ease of movement of membrane proteins(56,57).
Clinical evidence. In the meta-analysis of seven prospective
epidemiological studies involving 176 441 subjects with 5480
incident cases of HF, the pooled relative risk for HF comparing
the highest with the lowest category of fish intake was 0·85 (95 %
CI 0·73, 0·99; P = 0·04); the corresponding value for marine n-3
PUFA was 0·86 (95 % CI 0·74, 1·00; P = 0·05)(58). In the large
GISSI-HF trial the investigators enrolled patients with chronic
HF of NYHA class II–IV, irrespective of cause and LVEF, and randomly assigned them to 1 g n-3 PUFA daily (n 3494) or placebo
(n 3481). Of the patients, 27 % (955) died from any cause in the
n-3 PUFA group and 1014 (29 %) in the placebo group (HR 0·91;
95 % CI 0·833, 0·998; P = 0·041). It was also reported that 57 % of
patients (1981) in the n-3 PUFA group and 2053 (59 %) in the
placebo group died or were admitted to hospital for cardiovascular reasons (HR 0·92; 99 % CI 0·849, 0·999; P = 0·009). In
absolute terms, fifty-six patients needed to be treated for a
median duration of 3·9 years to avoid one death or forty-four
to avoid one event like death or admission to hospital for cardiovascular reasons(59). In the same trial, baseline LVEF increased
with n-3 PUFA by 8·1 % at 1 year, 11·1 % at 2 years, and
11·5 % at 3 years v. 6·3 % at 1 year, 8·2 % at 2 years, and
9·9 % at 3 years in the placebo group (P = 0·005)(60). A metaanalysis of RCT also highlighted a significant reduction in cardiac
death in the active group compared with control, in particular in
subgroup analysis with EPAþDHA dosages >1 g/d (12·9–29·1 %
lower risks; P<0·05)(61). Based on these data it seems that the
effect of n-3 PUFA on HF seems to be dose- and time-related(62).
A further trial enrolled >200 patients with ischaemic HF or
dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class I–III on optimal medical
treatment, who were divided into two groups: the first one
received supplementation with 1000 mg of n-3 PUFA for
14 weeks while the second group took a placebo. At the end
of the 14 weeks, the results showed a reduction in end-diastolic
and end-systolic LV dimensions by 2·5%(P = 0·047) and 3·7 %
(P = 0·01), an improvement of LVEF by 3·6%(P = 0·021) and a
reduction of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels by 34·6 %
(P = 0·001) compared with placebo(63). Then, more recently,
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, treatment
with 2 g/d of n-3 PUFA, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in
thirty-one patients with ischaemic HF was shown to improve
LVEF (by 4·7 v. 1·7 %), E:E’ ratio (early ventricular filling (E)
to early annular mitral (E’) velocities; decreased by –9·47 v.
–2·1 %), ST2 levels (decreased by –4·5 v. –2·4 %), flow-mediated
dilation (increased by 44 v. 11 %) and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hsCRP) levels (decreased by –6·1 v. 4·3 %) (P<0·05 for
all)(64). These results confirm those from previous investigations
suggesting beneficial effects of EPA/DHA on haemodynamics,
LV indices and inflammation(65,66). Of course, the prognostic significance of these changes has yet to be clarified (Table 2).
Based on the available evidence, the 2016 guidelines of the
European Society of Cardiology suggest that PUFA supplementation may be considered in symptomatic HF patients to reduce
the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation and cardiovascular
death(67).
n-3 PUFA are well tolerated beyond some mild gastrointestinal adverse events(68). However, even in the recently published
REDUCE-IT trial(69) that demonstrated a statistically significant
absolute risk reduction of 4·8 % in its primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke,
coronary revascularisation, or unstable angina), the use of highdose (2 × 2 g) highly purified EPA was associated with increased
incidence of atrial fibrillation.
Expert opinion. The available evidence supports the supplementation of EPA and DHA to improve HF prognosis, especially
in patients after myocardial infarction.
Levo-carnitine (L-carnitine)
L-Carnitine, a chemical analogue of choline, is a hydrophilic
quaternary amine and is involved in several physiological activities such as lipid metabolism and mitochondrial defence. In particular, it plays an important role in lipid metabolism by acting as
an obligatory cofactor for the oxidation of fatty acids and facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to
the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation(70). In agreement with
the ‘energy starvation’ hypothesis, suggesting that insufficient
ATP supply (in addition to increased oxidation, inflammation
and fibrosis) underlies the contractile dysfunction presenting
in HF(71), it seems that L-carnitine might improve energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes and contribute to the improvement of
clinical symptoms and cardiac function. Furthermore, L-carnitine
exerts cardioprotective effects through the reduction of oxidative
stress(72) and cardiac fibrosis(73,74).
Clinical evidence. A meta-analysis of seventeen RCT enrolling
1625 HF subjects showed a considerable improvement in overall
cardiac function (evaluated in term of decreased NYHA class)
(OR 3·47 (95 % CI 2·49, 4·82); P<0·01), LVEF (WMD = 4·1 (95 %
CI 2·34, 5·93) %; P = 0·01), stroke volume (WMD = 8·20 (95 % CI
6·41, 10·01) ml; P = 0·01), cardiac output (WMD = 0·9 (95 % CI
0·76, 1·01) litres/min; P<0·01) and ratio of the early (E) to late
(A) ventricular filling velocities (E/A) (WMD = 0·2 (95 % CI
0·11, 0·35); P<0·01). In addition, treatment with L-carnitine also
resulted in significant decreases in serum levels of BNP
(WMD = –124·6 (95 % CI −220·49, −28·71) pg/ml; P = 0·01),
serum levels of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) (WMD = –510·4 (95 % CI −785·42, −235·30) pg/ml;
P<0·01), LV end-systolic diameter (WMD = –4·1 (95 % CI
−6·57, −1·55) mm; P<0·01), LV end-diastolic diameter
(WMD = –4·8 (95 % CI −7·08, −2·49) mm; P<0·01) and LV
end-systolic volume (WMD = –20·2 (95 % CI –35·6, –4·7) ml;
P<0·01). No significant differences were reported in all-cause mortality, 6-min walk, and adverse events between L-carnitine and
control groups(75). These results were obtained with L-carnitine
160 A. F. G. Cicero et al.

doses ranging from 1·5 to 6 g/d and follow-up length ranging from
7 d to 3 years. In a further meta-analysis of ten RCT enrolling
925 patients, L-carnitine consumption was associated with significant reductions in serum CRP (–0·60 mg/l (5·71 nmol/l); 95 % CI
–0·87, –0·32 mg/l) and TNF-α concentrations (–0·36 (95 % CI
–0·56, –0·15) pg/ml)(76). Then, L-carnitine supplementation could
have a mild but significant impact on body weight(77) and plasma
level of lipoprotein (a)(78). The prognostic importance and clinical
relevance of these data still need to be clarified (Table 2).
L-Carnitine is in general well tolerated; dry mouth, rash and
mild gastrointestinal problems could infrequently occur.
Expert opinion. L-Carnitine treatment might be effective for
congestive HF patients as an adjuvant to conventional therapy,
improving clinical symptoms and cardiac function, decreasing
serum levels of BNP and NT-proBNP. Further research is required
to more accurately assess the clinical relevance of L-carnitine
administration for supporting HF care.
Thiamine (vitamin B1)
Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential water-soluble vitamin
required for cellular energy production. Thiamine pyrophosphate
is the key coenzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway for
transketolation of glucose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate(79).
Thiamine pyrophosphate is needed for the functioning of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (converting pyruvate to acetyl CoA)
and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (converting α-ketoglutarate
to succinate) in the Krebs cycle, thus being essential for ATP
metabolism(80). In general, the recommended daily allowance of
thiamine for adults is about 1·2 mg for men and 1 mg for women(81).
Deficiency of thiamine is far more common in underdeveloped
and developing countries (in particular in individuals with chronic
alcohol use, patients on total parenteral nutrition or who have
undergone weight loss surgery) due to high incidence of poor
nutritional status(82). Direct impairment of myocardial energy production has been proposed as a possible basis for the development
of the HF state seen in beriberi, the disease related to chronic
dietary deficiency of thiamine(83).
Clinical evidence. Multiple studies have shown that thiamine
deficiency is more prevalent in HF patients than in the general
population. In a meta-analysis of nine observational studies,
the incidence of thiamine deficiency in patients with HF has
been reported to be 2·5 times higher compared with that of control subjects without HF (OR 2·53, 95 % CI 1·65, 3·87). The incidence of thiamine deficiency has ranged from 3 to 91 % in
various studies conducted in both in-patient and out-patient
settings(84). The main mechanisms for thiamine deficiency in
HF are the reduction of thiamine intake and its poor absorption
due to cardiac cachexia and splanchnic congestion; however, a
main cause could be the increased urinary excretion determined
by the treatment with high doses of loop diuretics(85). In a crosssectional prospective observational analysis on thirty-two
male NYHA II HF patients on prolonged diuretic therapy, sixteen
patients received 300 mg/d of thiamine for 28 d: a 13·5 % increase
of LVEF was observed in thiamine recipients (P = 0·021)
when compared with control(86). Shimon et al.(87) randomised
thirty hospitalised HF patients secondary to myocardial ischaemia
and administered intravenous thiamine for 7 d or placebo in a
double-blind manner followed by 6 weeks of oral thiamine at
200 mg/d in all patients. At the end of complete treatment patients
experienced a 22 % increase in LVEF as compared with the baseline value (P<0·01). Similar results were obtained in a small RCT
carried out of nine symptomatic patients with HF with an increase
in LVEF from 29·5 to 32·8%(P = 0·024) after supplementation
with oral thiamine at 300 mg/d for 28 d(88). However, a recent
RCT (fifty-two patients with HF and LVEF <40 % treated with
300 mg/d of thiamine or placebo for a period of 1 month) showed
no significant difference in either systolic or diastolic echocardiographic parameters and dyspnoea between the two groups, even if
patients in the thiamine group showed a significant improvement
in peripheral oedema (34·6 v. 3·8 %; P = 0·005)(89). In this study,
however, the proportion of patients who were on furosemide
was incredibly low (ten out of fifty-two). Second, spironolactone
was prescribed to most (twenty-two out of twenty-six) patients
in the thiamine group, which may have caused a decrease in
the incidence of thiamine deficiency in this cohort of patients(90).
In general, at dosages between 25 and 300 mg/d, thiamine
is confirmed to have an excellent profile of safety.
Expert opinion. Given the small sample size and inherent
limitations of the available studies, long-term RCT with large
samples are needed to confirm or not the positive effects of thiamine in patients with HF(79).
Cocoa and dark chocolate
Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is a rich source of polyphenols, generally varying from 12 to 18 % of dry weight depending on variety, growing region and processing operations of the beans(91).
Among polyphenols, cocoa is particularly rich in flavonoids, in
particular flavanols that are present as aglycones both in the
monomeric and polymerised form. Among the monomeric flavanols the flavan-3-ols (37 % of total monomeric flavanols form),
with (–)-epicatechin occurring in the largest quantities, represent
35 % of the total content of phenolic compounds in cocoa beans
(reaching concentrations of 16·5 mg/g dry weight in Costa Rica
cacao)(92). A rich source of cocoa polyphenols is dark chocolate,
even if the treatment of cocoa beans through fermentation, roasting, drying and alkalisation processes is the cause of a significant
loss of polyphenol content and of the antioxidant, metabolic and
vascular effects. Therefore, the concentration of polyphenols in
the cocoa bean is significantly different from that of cocoa
powder and chocolate(93). The mechanisms of action through
which cocoa polyphenols could act on HF have not been
yet fully clarified – the most reliable hypotheses concern the
improvement of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator
responses, mediated by increase in NO synthesis, suppression
of endothelin-1 synthesis and reduction of NT-proBNP(94,95).
Clinical evidence. In a prospective cohort study of 31 917
Swedish men aged 45–79 years, moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a lower rate of HF hospitalisation or
death: the multivariable-adjusted rate ratio was 0·88 (95 % CI
0·78, 0·99) for those consuming 1–3 servings per month,
Nutraceutical support in heart failure 161
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422420000049 Published online by Cambridge University Press

0·83 (95 % CI 0·72, 0·94) for those consuming 1–2 servings per
week, 0·82 (95 % CI 0·68, 0·99) for those consuming 3–6 servings
per week, and 1·10 (95 % CI 0·84, 1·45) for those consuming
≥1 serving per d (P = 0·001)(96). However, a higher than moderate intake was not associated with a decreased risk. This effect
may be attributable to the high energy content of commercially
available chocolate, and therefore the risk to increase weight
gain. However, in the large Physicians’ Health Study, the association between chocolate consumption and incident HF was
stronger in lean than in overweight/obese subjects(97), making
the interpretation of this relationship more complex, however,
on the other hand supporting in a way the obesity paradox
hypothesis(98). In a recent small RCT, thirty-two patients with
chronic HF, stable on guideline-directed medical therapy, were
randomised to consume 50 g/d of high-flavanol dark chocolate
(HFDC; 1064 mg of flavanols/d) or low-flavanol dark chocolate
(LFDC; 88 mg of flavanols per d) for 4 weeks and then crossed
over to consume the alternative dark chocolate for a further
4 weeks. At the end of treatment with HFDC, plasma NTproBNP level was significantly reduced compared with baseline
(−44 (SD 69) %), and and in the follow-up (−41 (SD 77) %) values,
but also compared with LFDC (−33 (SD 72) %) treated patients.
HFDC also significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure compared with the values after LFDC (−6·7 (SD 10·1) mmHg)(99). In
addition, it was recently shown that flavanol-rich chocolate also
improves vascular function in patients with congestive HF(100).
Dark chocolate consumption in patients with HF was also related
to an improvement in maximum work (W) (P = 0·026), with no
changes with placebo. In addition, a significant increase in protein levels was observed for liver kinase B1 (LKB1), adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPAR-γ
coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) and in their active forms (phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1) as well as in citrate synthase(101).
However, the prognostic significance of these changes has yet
to be clarified (Table 3).
Cocoa is usually very well tolerated, both as functional food
and as a dietary supplement (flavanols). The main risk with commercial chocolate is the increase in body weight, if consumption
is not quantitatively controlled.
Expert opinion. More data are needed due to study limitations
and inconsistency: the incidence of HF in epidemiological studies was often reported as a cumulative incidence in years without
knowing the HF-free survival curves; although the results suggest that chocolate consumption may play a role in preventing
HF, it is still unclear how much chocolate consumption is needed
to achieve this and whether the effect is linked to preventing or
only delaying the development of HF. Finally, it is difficult to
evaluate the risk of HF following consumption of different types
of chocolate or different amounts of energy intake.
L-Carnosine
L-Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide produced primarily in the liver (from β-alanine, through carnosine synthase)
and stored especially in the skeletal muscle and in the heart(102).
The rate-limiting step in the synthesis of L-carnosine is represented by the tissue concentration of β-alanine (produced as a
result of uracil hepatic metabolism), and the oral administration
of β-alanine has been shown to increase the levels of L-carnosine
in the heart(103). However, the intake of β-alanine at the active
dose of 800 mg at a single time can give ‘pins and needles’
paraesthesia that can last 1 h, during the peak of plasma
β-alanine(104). L-Carnosine should exert a positive effect on HF
patients through different mechanisms of action: the antioxidant
and peroxyl radical-trapping ability at physiological concentrations due to its imidazole ring(105), the prevention of hydroxylradicals production via chemical Fenton catalysis by Fe and Cu
chelation(106), as well as the inhibition of the fragmentation
and inactivation of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase by peroxyl
radicals(107). The antioxidant properties of histidine derivatives
have also been supposed to be responsible for the cardioprotective effect against ischaemia–reperfusion injury demonstrated in vitro(108). Moreover, L-carnosine plays a sensitising
action in cardiac contraction, probably related to an upregulation of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum(109).
This effect could lead to a procontractile action(110), potentially
useful in HF patients.
Clinical evidence. In an RCT, the effect of the oral administration of 500 mg of L-carnosine for 6 months on QoL and exercise
performance has been tested in fifty patients with stable HF and
impaired LV function. Patients who received orodispersible
L-carnosine experienced an improvement in 6-min walking test
(6MWT) distance (P = 0·014) and an improvement in selfperceived QoL (assessed with a visual analogue scale score;
P = 0·039) between baseline and follow-up. In addition, in an
L-carnosine group compared with controls, at the end of
6 months of treatment the authors showed an improvement in
peak VO2 (P<0·0001), VO2 at anaerobic threshold, 6MWT, peak
exercise workload and self-perceived QoL assessed by the
EuroQoL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D test) and the
visual analogue scale score(111). A potential alternative to direct
L-carnosine administration could be supplementation with magnesium orotate, which seems also to be clinically useful in
HF(112). The orotate is in fact a precursor of uridine, a pyrimidine
nucleoside used from cardiac tissue as a source of β-alanine and
subsequently of L-carnosine. A placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects following the administration of magnesium
orotate (6 g/d for 1 month, 3 g/d for 11 months) in patients with
severe congestive HF, reported a survival rate of 75·7 % in
patients treated with magnesium orotate, compared with
51·5 % survival for those treated with placebo (P<0·05)(113).
Orotate can be considered as a ‘delayed release’ form of
β-alanine, which can be better tolerated than β-alanine itself,
probably because the evolution of β-alanine proceeds gradually
after orotate intake. Consequently, the intake of orotates or
orotic acid could be a strategy for boosting the level of carnosine
in the body and in the heart tissues(114). Timed-release β-alanine
preparations may also be employed to prevent the above-cited
paraesthesia(115), but this formulation has not yet been tested in
HF patients (Table 2).
Carnosine is overall usually well tolerated, and no specific
concerns have been raised till now as regards its use as a dietary
supplement
162 A. F. G. Cicero et al.

Expert opinion. Given the small sample size and inherent
limitations of the available studies, long-term RCT with large
samples are needed to confirm or not the positive effects of
L-carnosine in patients with HF.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D (vitD; commonly referred to as D2 and D3, respectively, ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol) is a collection of fatsoluble steroids, obtained via endogenous production or from
dietary intake, with the latter accounting for nearly 10–20 % of
our total supply(116). Cholecalciferol is produced from its precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol, in the skin, after exposure to the UVB
spectrum of sunlight. In its original state, vitamin D3 is inactive
and requires two separate hydroxylation reactions (the first in
the liver and the second in the kidney) to become biologically
active (calcitriol). Calcitriol exerts its effects via the vitD receptor
and it is responsible for the regulation of gene transcription and
protein synthesis, with the known effect on Ca homeostasis and
bone metabolism(117). Nevertheless, in recent years, the biological influence of vitD has been significantly expanded beyond
just Ca regulation. VitD receptor has been isolated from a
number of different tissues not traditionally involved in Ca
homeostasis, such as the myocardium(118) and fibroblasts(119).
Despite emerging evidence supporting a pathophysiological
relationship between vitD and HF, the exact mechanism by
which vitD deficiency leads to poor clinical outcome has not
been clearly established. One of the hypotheses is the relationship between the heart and kidney: these two organs are interrelated and the impairment of one system can induce
pathological processes within the other, thus accelerating the
progressive failure of both. This interrelationship serves as
the pathophysiological basis of the clinical entity called cardiorenal syndrome(120). The progression of cardiorenal syndrome
involves the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system overactivation, as well as systemic
inflammation, which could alter electrolyte and fluid regulation, cause endothelial dysfunction, and both LV remodelling
and fibrosis along with renal fibrosis and failure(121,122).
These changes set up a vicious cycle, resulting in further systemic dysfunction until organ failure occurs. VitD is particularly
low in individuals with cardiorenal syndrome, probably due to
reduced α-1-hydroxylase activity and the depletion of vitDbinding proteins secondary to proteinuria(123). Similarly, with
those HF patients, they are also associated with increased
cardiovascular events(124). In a study of patients with diabetic
nephropathy, paricalcitol supplementation significantly reduces
proteinuria(125), a known predictor of cardiovascular events(126,127).
VitD deficiency in HF patients could also be linked to an overactivation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system(128), and to
increased production and release of inflammatory cytokines,
which can have a direct negative effect on the myocardium or
indirectly affect other vital organs, causing myocardial apoptosis,
hypertrophy, fibrosis, LV remodelling, negative ionotropic
effects(129-131), increased renal fibrosis and renal failure(132,133).
In vitro studies suggest that vitD suppresses proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 and up-regulates anti-inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-10(134), while the lack of vitD is associated
with increased myocardial matrix metalloproteinase expression,
increased collagen deposition and fibrosis(135,136).
Clinical evidence. Many observational studies have suggested
a possible relationship between vitD status and prevalence, incidence and severity of HF(137,138). In a North-American study carried out on 8351 participants, individuals in the lowest tertile
were approximately twice as likely to have HF compared with
those in the highest tertile (OR 2·1; 95 % CI 1·2, 3·6)(139).
Similar results were confirmed in the larger Intermountain
Heart Collaboration Study in a cohort of 41 504 patients(140).
In the German Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health
Study with 3299 patients referred for coronary angiography, a
significant negative correlation was observed between serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and NT-proBNP concentration
(r –0·2; P<0·001) and mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was
positively correlated with LVEF and negatively correlated with
NYHA functional class(141). 25(OH)D levels were negatively
associated with N-terminal pro-A-type natriuretic peptide in
NYHA II–IV patients(142). In addition, individuals with a serum
25(OH)D concentration <10·0 ng/ml (<25·0 nmol/l) had significantly larger LV volumes compared with those with a serum
25(OH)D concentration >10·0 ng/ml (>25·0 nmol/l), and mean
fractional shortening was significantly lower in those with a
serum 25(OH)D concentration <10·0 ng/ml (<25·0 nmol/l)
(31·6 v. 37·1 %; P<0·05)(143). In general, mean serum 25(OH)D
concentration is usually lower in patients with HF compared
with controls(144-146). VitD status may be related to physical functioning in HF: there seems to be a negative correlation between
cardiopulmonary stress test performance and serum 25(OH)D
concentration ≤ 9·0 ng/ml (≤ 22·5 nmol/l) compared with those
with levels ≥10·0 ng/ml (≥ 25·0 nmol/l)(147). A significant positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration,
6MWT distance (r 0·4; P<0·05)(148) and maximal oxygen uptake
during cardiopulmonary stress testing was observed in HF
patients(149). VitD status may also be related to prognosis in
HF: in the above-cited Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular
Health Study (patients were followed-up for a median of
7·7 years), individuals with severe vitD deficiency (serum
25(OH)D concentration <10·0 ng/ml (<25·0 nmol/l)) were
approximately four times more likely to die from HF than
those with a serum 25(OH)D concentration in the optimal range
(>30·0 ng/ml (>75·0 nmol/l)) (HR 4·1; 95 % CI 1·8, 9·6). Even
patients waiting for heart transplantation in the highest
25(OH)D tertile were approximately twice as likely to survive
in comparison with those in the lowest tertile (HR 0·4; 95 % CI
0·3, 0·5)(150).
In an RCT, 123 patients with HF treated with vitD (2000 IU/d)
þ Ca (500 mg/d) for 9 months experienced significantly
increased IL-10 and reduction of TNF-α compared with placebo
(administered with at Ca 500 mg/d only)(151). In paediatric HF
patients, daily vitD supplementation with 1000 IU of cholecalciferol resulted in significant improvement in LV end diastolic and
systolic diameters, LVEF and myocardial performance index,
together with reductions in inflammatory cytokines(152). VitD supplementation (between 800 and 1000 IU/d) in HF patients with
low 25(OH)D levels was associated with a significant reduction
in mortality, independent of the baseline 25(OH)D levels(153).
Nutraceutical support in heart failure 163
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422420000049 Published online by Cambridge University Press

However, supplementation with a very high dosage (100 000 IU/
week) was not associated with improvement of 6MWT distance
after 20 weeks of treatment, despite a significant reduction in
BNP levels(154), probably because in this study the obtained serum
25(OH)D levels were not optimised.
In general, vitD supplementation is believed to be safe
because it rarely raises serum vitD levels to the toxic range even
after repeated intravenous ingestion of extremely high doses of
synthetic vitD. However, prolonged consumption of vitD supplementation may induce hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria and
hyperphosphataemia, which are considered the initial signs of
vitD intoxication(155). Use of thiazide diuretics in combination
with Ca and vitD supplements may cause hypercalcaemia in
the elderly or those with compromised renal function or
hyperparathyroidism(156).
Expert opinion. It seems that vitD might be useful in the supporting HF therapy and improve prognosis. However, largescale randomised, multicentre clinical trials are still needed
before routine vitD supplementation can be recommended as
part of clinical care of HF patients. VitD should be supplemented
in vitD-deficient subjects, and especially in those with heart
diseases.
Magnesium
Mg plays a role in many enzymic processes, contributing to stable cardiovascular haemodynamics and electrophysiological
functioning: it is an important component in mitochondrial
function, modulating cellular K permeability and affecting Ca
uptake and its distribution(157,158). In respect of other electrolyte
alterations, the pathophysiology of hypomagnesaemia (serum
Mg <1·5 mg/dl (0·62 mmol/l)) remains less studied even if is
not infrequently observed in HF patients: the prevalence is
about 7 % of well-compensated ambulatory subjects to 52 % in
more advanced HF patients who are aggressively treated with
diuretics(159). To date, it is rather clear that the effective correction
of Mg disturbances is favourable in HF subjects, in particular in
preventing potentially life-threatining arrhythmias(160). In HF,
Mg depletion stems from several factors such as reduced dietary
intake, altered distribution of the ion, renal losses, oedematous
states (involving the intestinal mucosa that might interfere with
the absorption of microelements), respiratory alkalosis and
excessive catecholamine release(161). Moreover, diuretics produce
most of renal Mg loss, especially in the volume-expanded setting
of HF and in associated hyperaldosteronism and it has been
demonstrated that K depletion inhibits the renal reabsorption of
Mg, leading to hypermagnesiuria and hypomagnesaemia(162).
Hypomagnesaemia seems to have vasoconstrictor properties
due to the inhibition of PG-induced relaxation and to the enhancement of the activity of the vasoconstrictor neurohormones
through alterations in Ca uptake. In HF patients, the presence
of adequate total-body Mg stores has been associated with a
reduction in the risk of arrhythmias, digitalis toxicity and haemodynamic abnormalities(160).
Clinical evidence. Most of the evidence supporting Mg supplementation in HF patients comes from observational data. Small
RCT carried out in HF patients have underlined that Mg supplementation improves LVEF(163) and heart rate variability(164). On
the other hand, observational studies have linked low
serum Mg to more adverse CVD risk factor profiles(165-167) and
greater risk of CVD events(168). In the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) study, participants in the lowest quintile
of Mg levels were at 2·5 times greater risk of incident HF after
adjustment for demographic factors, and with additional adjustment for behaviours and CVD risk factors(169). HF worsening secondary to very severe hypomagnesaemia has been described,
and, in some cases, Mg supplementation determines the reversal
of HF(170). Overall, among patients with HF, low serum Mg has
been associated with increased all-cause mortality(171). The
British Heart Regional Study (a prospective study of 3523 men
aged 60–79 years with no prevalent HF or myocardial infarction
followed up for a mean period of 15 years) showed that serum
Mg was inversely related to risk of incident HF (after adjustment
for conventional CVD risk factors and incident myocardial
infarction). In addition, the benefit of high serum Mg on HF risk
was most evident in men with electrocardiogram evidence of
ischaemia (HR 0·29; 95 % CI 0·13, 0·68; P<0·05)(172). However,
a meta-analysis of seven eligible prospective studies did not
observe a clear correlation between hypomagnesaemia and HF,
if not in elderly HF patients with reduced LVEF(173). However,
in the Jackson Heart Study cohort, Mg intake <2·3 mg/kg was
related to increased risk of subsequent HF hospitalisations(174),
and, in a more recent study, Mg deficiency independently predicted poor QoL and earlier cardiac event-free survival in HF
patients(175). Finally, a recent meta-analysis showed a clear and
significant link between Mg supplementation and reduction of
inflammation(176).
Low serum Mg seems to be associated with an increased risk
of incident atrial fibrillation(177,178) that is closely related with
HF(179,180). In particular, many studies have highlighted the correlation between serum Mg deficiency and atrial fibrillation risk
after cardiac surgery: in that setting, Mg is sometimes used prophylactically to prevent atrial fibrillation events(181-183). In addition, Mg is believed to be linked to CVD risk through a broad
range of physiological roles; low serum concentrations have
been associated with impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin
action, elevated blood pressure, chronic inflammation, impaired
vasomotor tone and peripheral blood flow, and electrocardiogram abnormalities(184). A recent meta-analysis of forty prospective cohort studies totalling more than 1 million participants has
shown that increasing dietary Mg intake is associated with a
reduced risk of stroke, HF, diabetes, and all-cause mortality,
but not CHD or total CVD(185).
Mild diarrhoea, stomach upset, nausea and heartbeat are the
most common dose-dependent side effects after the use of Mg.
Mg toxicity rarely occurs except in patients with renal dysfunction: severe kidney failure and heart block are the two relative
contraindications(186).
Expert opinion. The available data suggest that we should avoid
hypomangnesaemia in patients with HF. However, the prognostic significance of serum Mg concentration in HF patients as well
as clinical relevance of its supplementation still needs to be
investigated. Additional work is needed to elucidate whether
164 A. F. G. Cicero et al.

the association between HF and Mg deficiency is causal and to
clarify the specific mechanisms that underlie the association.
Beetroot and inorganic nitrates
NO is not only an endothelium-derived relaxing factor, but is
also a key cellular signalling molecule with pleiotropic effects
in many tissues. For example, in skeletal muscle NO helps to
modulate contractile function, through the nitrosation or
S-nitrosylation of various proteins(187). In addition, during concentric activity, NO significantly increases the rate of force development, maximal shortening velocity, and maximal power of
both single muscle fibres and isolated muscles via the activation
of the classic NO soluble guanyl cyclase-cycle GMP (NO-sGCcGMP) pathway(188). In failing cardiac muscle, however, the
increased production of reactive oxygen species leads to more
rapid destruction of NO, and hence reduced NO-sGC-cGMP
signalling, which in turn is thought to contribute to reduced contractility in HF(189). It is possible therefore that NO bioavailability
is diminished in the skeletal muscles of patients with HF, thus
contributing to their reduced muscle function(188). It is also well
established that HF leads to endothelial dysfunction in various
tissues, including skeletal muscle, as a result of reduced NO
production via endothelial NO synthase(190). Emerging evidence
suggests that supplementation of dietary inorganic nitrate
(NO3
−) has beneficial effects on vascular health, blood pressure,
exercise capacity and oxygen metabolism though targeted NO
production(191). After ingestion, NO3
− is reduced to bioactive
NO2
− by bacteria found in the oral cavity. NO2− is then taken
up by the plasma from the digestive system and can be converted
to NO, particularly under hypoxic or acidic conditions(192), which
can occur in HF and during exercise. Inorganic nitrates slowly
produce NO and determine more mild but sustained vasodilation while organic nitrates rapidly release relatively large
amounts of NO(193,194), with potentially adverse effects on myocardial functionality in HF patients(195). Compared with placebo,
either a single, acute dose or 1 week of daily dosing of beetroot
juice (BRJ) significantly increased plasma NO2
− similarly, by 138
and 129 % compared with placebo, respectively(196).
Clinical evidence. In some RCT, BRJ has been shown to
increase time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise and
to reduce oxygen consumption (VO2) during submaximal exercise (i.e. reduce oxygen cost at a given submaximal work
rate)(197-199). These results were obtained not only in healthy individuals but also in HF patients. In these latter subjects, a single
dose of BRJ (12·9 mmol NO3
–
) was shown to increase total work
performed and cardiac output compared with placebo, while
decreasing systemic vascular resistance and reducing aortic augmentation index during a maximal exercise test(200). In healthy
older adults, BRJ supplementation has been shown to improve
VO2 kinetics(201). Daily supplementation with BRJ containing
11·2 mmol of NO3
– increased NO production and muscle function with an improvement of physical exercise in HF patients(202).
In another RCT, 1 week of daily dosing with BRJ containing
6·1 mmol NO3
– significantly improved submaximal aerobic
endurance (þ24 %; P = 0·02 compared with placebo) and
blood pressure (P<0·001) in elderly patients with HFpEF(203).
Acute dietary NO3
– intake was also related to an increase of
VO2 peak and improved physical performances in HFrEF
patients(204). BRJ may have positive effects combined with an
aerobic exercise training regimen in HFrEF patients, even if data
are still limited and inconsistent(205). BRJ has also been shown to
improve exercise capacity and oxygen metabolism in older
patients with peripheral arterial disease(206). Data on EF and hard
outcomes are still lacking; however, a meta-analysis of RCT
including 1248 patients showed that BRJ is associated with significant reductions in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure:
–3·55 (95 % CI –4·5, –2·5) mmHg; diastolic blood pressure:
–1·3 (95 % CI –1·9 to –0·7) mmHg) compared with controls, thus
reducing the afterload. The mean difference of SBP was larger
between BRJ-supplemented and control groups in the longer
than in the shorter (≥14 compared with <14 d) study durations
(–5·1 compared with –2·7 mmHg) and the highest compared
with the lowest (500 compared with 70 and 140 ml/d) doses
of BRJ (–4·8 compared with –2·4 mmHg)(207). Long-term effects
on EF and hard outcomes are lacking (Table 3).
In general, BRJ supplementation seems to be tolerable and
safe after short-term administration. However, most available
clinical trials are short term (<30 d). Long-term data are lacking.
Expert opinion. Taking into account relatively limited data,
mainly short term, on the possible administration of beetroot
and NO3
– in HF patients it is difficult to draw any recommendations of its usefulness. Therefore, large-scale randomised, multicentre clinical trials are still needed.
D-Ribose
D-Ribose is a pentose carbohydrate that plays many physiological roles. Myocardial ATP levels are important to maintain cell
integrity and function: ATP has a key role in the interaction
between Ca and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (important for ventricular relaxation)(208). In fact, deficient ATP levels are found in
IHD and HF(209) and can be responsible for diastolic dysfunction
and a non-compliant ventricle. Exogenous supplementation
with D-ribose enhances the regeneration of ATP levels by
bypassing rate-limiting, slow enzymic steps in glycolysis through
the pentose phosphate pathway(210,211). In an experimental
model of ischaemic injury, supplementation with D-ribose might
quickly increase immediately the levels of ATP, improving diastolic dysfunction and substantially shortening the lengthy time
recovery that normally occurs following ischaemia(212).
Clinical evidence. Preliminary results in HF patients confirm
what was observed in experimental models: in a prospective
feasibility study, D-ribose improved diastolic dysfunction, selfperceived QoL and physical function(213), while in a pilot trial
D-ribose improved ventilatory efficiency(214). In an RCT, the
effects of the administration of 5 g daily of D-ribose for 6 weeks
were evaluated in patients with NYHA II–IV. At the end of the
treatment, the results showed an improvement of tissue
Doppler velocity (E’) (in 75 % of the patients) what was also
maintained in the follow-up visit at 9 weeks (i.e. 3 weeks after
the treatment with D-ribose was stopped). In addition, half of
the patients achieved an improvement in their ratio of E:E'(215).
Nutraceutical support in heart failure 165
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422420000049 Published online by Cambridge University Press

At least part of these effects could be related to the anti-ischaemic
properties of D-ribose: supplementation with this pentose carbohydrate enabled patients with stable coronary artery disease to
exercise longer without developing angina or electrocardiographic changes(216). Moreover, improvement in heamodynamic
parameters has also been recorded perioperatively, in patients
undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass(217) and in individuals following aortic valve replacement(218) (Table 2).
Side effects were negligible.
Expert opinion. D-Ribose might offer an energetic benefit in
patients with ischaemic CVD, including HF (particularly; with
the improvement of diastolic dysfunction). Even if the preliminary data are encouraging, clinical studies conducted to date
are still few, small and relatively short.
Probiotics
Recent clinical and preclinical studies underline the key role of
intestinal microbiota in cardiovascular health and in HF prognosis in particular(219). Intestinal eubiosis is important in regulation
of the function of the intestinal barrier, together with mucosal
immunity, Na and water homeostasis and the functionality of
tight junctions. In particular, subjects with HF manifest gastrointestinal disorders of absorption, motility, tissue perfusion and
oedema, which determine alterations of the intestinal bacterial
flora that in long term are responsible for an increase in translocation of endotoxins in the blood, an increase in preload and
afterload and an aggravation of the clinical picture(220,221).
Clinical evidence. A strong correlation appears to exist
between HF severity and the severity of intestinal dysbiosis,
measured through the serum levels of trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO), an amine produced by the metabolism of choline
and phosphatidylcholine from intestinal microbiota (especially
from opportunistic/pathogenic micro-organisms)(222). It is hypothesised that vascular remodelling and progressive coronary atherogenesis may occur in the context of high levels of TMAO(223).
The aetiopathogenetic mechanism is not clear yet; however, it
is evident that there is a direct proportionality between the blood
levels of TMAO and an increase in intestinal oedema, inflammatory metabolites and cardiac and vascular remodelling(224). In a
recent prospective study, the potential pathophysiological role
of intestinal microbiota in HF and its relationship to mortality
from all causes was examined; in particular, the authors studied
(in 720 subjects and for a duration of 5 years of follow-up) the role
of TMAO, measured through fasting blood samples. The study
found that the highest TMAO levels were reported in patients with
HF (mean TMAO levels: 5·0 μM) compared with healthy subjects
(mean TMAO levels: 3·5 μM; P<0·001), with a risk of mortality
increased by 3·4 times(225). Finally, it has been shown that elevated
TMAO levels modify lipid metabolism through changes in the
functionality of reverse cholesterol transport, sterol metabolism
and modification of the quality and quantity of bile acids(226,227).
An RCT conducted in patients with NYHA class II or III and
LVEF <50 %, treated for 3 months with a preparation containing
1000 mg/d of probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii), evaluated
the efficacy of this supplementation on haemodynamic
parameters. At the end of 3 months of treatment, the group treated
with probiotics benefited from a significant reduction in uric
acid levels (–1·08 mg/dl (–64·24 μmol/l), P = 0·014 v. placebo:
–0·01 mg/dl (–0·59 μmol/l), P = 0·930), total cholesterol
(–7·63 mg/dl (–0·20 mmol/l), P = 0·010 v. placebo: –2·02 mg/dl
(–0·05 mmol/l), P = 0·603), hsCRP (–0·23 mg/dl (–2·3 mg/l),
P = 0·116 v. placebo: þ0·44 mg/dl (þ4·4 mg/l), P = 0·011),
improvement in LVEF (þ6·6 %, P = 0·005 v. placebo: þ4·2 %,
P = 0·173) and of the left atrial diameter (–0·29 cm, P = 0·044 v.
placebo: þ0·2 cm, P = 0·079)(228). Preclinical data have shown
results comparable with Lactobacillus rhamnosus(229). A recent
study by Maier et al.(230) showed that about one-quarter of nonantibiotic drugs are able to inhibit the growth of at least one main
strain of intestinal bacterial flora. Among the cardiovascular
drugs, the most interesting ones appear to be Ca antagonists
and numerous anti-arrhythmics. Therefore, the microbiome
dysbiosis–drug interaction in HF patients is particularly evident
compared with the general population and so greater attention
should be paid to possible alterations and new aetiopathogenetic
mechanisms caused to the microbiome(225). The ongoing GutHeart trial has randomised 150 patients with stable HF and a
LVEF<40 % to receive the antibiotic rifaximin, the probiotic yeast
S. boulardii (ATCC 74012) or no treatment in a 1:1:1 fashion. The
primary endpoint is EF at 3 months. The outcomes of the trial will
shed some light into the possible therapeutic avenues in the future
targeting the gut microbiome (Table 2).
In general, supplementation with probiotics in cardiovascular
prevention has proved to be safe and free of any relevant side
effects.
Expert opinion. Some probiotic strains (in particular lactobacilli,
bifidobacterial, in addition to S. boulardii) could be applied as an
adjuvant to conventional therapy in HF treatment. Further longterm clinical trials (including the results from the Gut-Heart trial)
are necessary to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes.
Iron
Fe deficiency is defined in the general population as serum ferritin <30 ng/ml and transferrin saturation below 20 %; however,
different cut-off values are used in the presence of inflammatory
co-morbidities (ferritin is an acute-phase protein that increases
during inflammation) such as inflammatory bowel disease
(ferritin <100 ng/ml), chronic kidney disease (ferritin <500 ng/ml
plus transferrin <30 %) and chronic kidney disease (transferrin
<100 ng/ml or<100–299 ng/ml plus transferrin<20 %) to diagnose
Fe deficiency(231). The burdening prevalence of this co-morbid
condition is illustrated by the findings of such deficit in 30–50 %
in chronic stable disease(232,233) and –80 % in acute HF(234,235).
Furthermore, Fe deficiency independently predicts more severe
symptomatic burden, higher morbidity, as noted by markedly
increased hospitalisations and readmission rates, and mortality(236),
which underscores its importance in HF. Fe deficiency in HF
patients (as in the general population) may be due to either
reduced Fe intake, increased Fe body losses and/or impaired Fe
absorption(237). Briefly, anaemia is often the result of compromised
Fe stores and/or impaired transportation. In addition to Fe
166 A. F. G. Cicero et al.
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422420000049 Published online by Cambridge University Press

deficiency, multiple other factors can contribute to anaemia,
including inflammation, renal dysfunction and haemodilution(238).
Clinical evidence. A small study noted that Fe intake was
markedly decreased in HF patients, aggravating with increased
disease severity(239). However, the Iron Repletion effects ON
Oxygen UpTake in Heart Failure (IRONOUT HF) multicentre
double-blind RCT, that included 255 patients with symptomatic
Fe deficiency and HFrEF treated for 16 weeks with oral intake of
150 mg twice daily of Fe polysaccharide or placebo, found no
significant differences between groups regarding natriuretic
peptide levels, symptomatic score, 6MWT or peak VO2. This
RCT also does not support a role for oral Fe in Fe deficiency
in HFrEF patients(240). Today, no trial has formally tested the role
of oral Fe in patients with HF and mid-range EF (HFmrEF) or HF
with HFpEF. According to 2016 European Society of Cardiology
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic
HF, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose should be considered in
symptomatic patients with HFrEF and Fe deficiency (serum ferritin <100 μg/l, or ferritin between 100 and 299 μg/l and transferrin
saturation <20 %) in order to alleviate HF symptoms, and
improve exercise capacity and QoL(61). While intravenous Fe administration in stable symptomatic (NYHA II–III) chronic HFrEF
is supported by several clinical trials, no convincing evidence is
available regarding oral Fe supplementation(241).
Whether low bioavailability due to intestinal wall oedema,
adverse events and subsequent low rates of adherence, and polypharmacy hinder the benefits of oral Fe in these subpopulations
is currently unknown. Moreover, oral Fe supplementation is
often associated with multiple unwanted events, particularly gastrointestinal adverse effects(242), which outweigh the null benefit
of such dietary supplement in HFrEF.
Expert opinion. The authors of this Position Paper support the
recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines as for potential
Fe supplementation in HFrEF patients. Further studies are necessary as for potential benefits of oral supplementation and in
other types of HF (HFpEF and HFmrEF).
Vitamin C
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) protects against oxidative stress by
reducing levels of free oxygen radicals and inhibiting LDL oxidation and oxidative cell damage(243). In addition, it is responsible to
improve arterial stiffness and immune function, and to reduce
inflammatory markers responsible for systemic inflammation(244).
Clinical evidence. Vitamin C is contained mostly in fruits and
vegetables and some(245,246), but not all the studies(247) have
underlined that a diet high in fruit and vegetables, rich in antioxidants, is associated with a reduced risk of HF. Moreover, only a
few studies have examined the association between plasma
vitamin C levels and incidence of HF, suggesting a positive correlation between elevated plasma vitamin C levels and reduction
of the HF risk(248). In a prospective study including 3919 men
aged 60–79 years with no HF at baseline and followed up for
a mean period of 11 years, a higher plasma vitamin C level
was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident HF in
both men with and without previous myocardial infarction after
adjustment for lifestyle characteristics, diabetes mellitus, blood
lipids, blood pressure and heart rate (HR 0·81 (95 % CI 0·70,
0·93) and 0·75 (95 % CI 0·59, 0·97) for 1 SD increase in log vitamin
C, respectively)(249). In a recent study, 200 HF patients completed
a 3 d food diary to determine vitamin C intake: 39 % of patients
had vitamin C deficiency that was associated with an hsCRP level
higher than 3 mg/l in the hierarchical logistic regression (OR
2·40; 95 % CI 1·13, 5·10; P = 0·023). In addition, both vitamin
C deficiency and hsCRP level higher than 3 mg/l predicted
shorter cardiac event-free survival in hierarchical Cox regression
and produced a 2·3-fold higher risk for cardiac events (P = 0·002)
in moderation analysis. Higher levels of hsCRP predicted shorter
cardiac event-free survival only in patients with vitamin C deficiency (P = 0·027), but not in those with vitamin C adequacy(250).
In addition, a meta-analysis of forty-four RCT showed a significant positive effect of vitamin C on endothelial function (SMD
0·50, 95 % CI 0·34, 0·66; P<0·001), in particular in the HF subgroup (SMD 0·48; 95 % CI 0·08, 0·88; P<0·02)(251). A possible
mechanism of correlation between plasma vitamin C levels
and its beneficial effects may be related to the arterial dilation
mediated by the modulation of NO release(252). However, the
association between vitamin C and HF seems to involve plasma
vitamin C rather than dietary vitamin C, as reported also by the
European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk
study(253).
In general, supplementation with vitamin C at dosages between
500 mg and 3 g/d is considered safe and well tolerated(254).
Expert opinion. Taking into account the available data in HF
settings, no recommendation can be given on the potential usefulness of vitamin C supplementation. To date no study has also
directly investigated the impact of chronic vitamin C supplementation on HF incidence or prognosis.
Vitamin E
Preclinical models suggest that oxidative stress characterised by
the excessive production of reactive oxygen species and reduction of antioxidant defence capacity may play an important role
in the pathophysiology of HF(255). Vitamin E includes eight distinct chemical entities: α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherol and α-, β-,
γ- and δ-tocotrienol. The most studied is α-tocopherol, while
other forms are poorly understood(256). Vitamin E can protect
against oxidative stress by reducing levels of free oxygen radicals
and inhibiting LDL oxidation and oxidative cell damage(240). In
addition, lipid-lowering activity has been documented through
PPAR (PPAR-α, PPAR-β and PPAR-γ) activation and HMG-CoA
reductase inhibition(257).
Clinical evidence. In clinical trials, vitamin E (at doses between
50 and 200 mg) showed an improvement of endothelial function
(reducing the serum levels of hsCRP, advanced glycation endproducts, metalloproteinases and cell adhesion molecules)
and arterial stiffness (improving pulse wave velocity, pulse volume and augmentation index)(258,259). The Physician’s Health
Study II and the Women’s Health Study reported no association
between vitamin E supplements and HF in a primary prevention
Nutraceutical support in heart failure 167

population(260,261) while other studies reported increased risk of
HF with vitamin E supplements in those with CVD(262,263), raising
concern about the use of vitamin E supplements. In addition, a
prospective study of 3919 men aged 60–79 years with no prevalent HF followed up for a mean period of 11 years highlighted
that high intake of dietary vitamin E may be associated with
increased HF risk(249). The reason for an increased risk of HF
esepcially in older men(264) is still unclear, but it may be related
to the fact that α-tocopherol may become a pro-oxidant in a preexisting environment with increased oxidative stress, thereby
depressing myocardial function. Moreover, α-tocopherol may
suppress other fat-soluble antioxidants, such as γ-tocopherol
(more powerful antioxidant than α-tocopherol), disrupting the
natural balance of antioxidant systems and increasing vulnerability to oxidative damage(265). In contrast to dietary vitamin E, no
association was observed between plasma vitamin E and risk
of HF(266) – it is well established that plasma concentrations of
vitamin E increase with the amount of total plasma lipids(267),
and particularly with LDL-cholesterol, the principal carrier of
tocopherol in the circulation. Thus, vitamin E absorption may
be influenced by factors other than diet and seems to be an unreliable marker of dietary vitamin E (α-tocopherol) intake. This
may explain the differences in association between dietary
and plasma vitamin E and HF.
No specific concern has been raised for vitamin E supplementation in the range of the reccomended daily allowance.
Expert opinion. Available epidemiological data and results from
RCT do not suggest any benefits from the supplementation of
vitamin E in prevention or as an adjuvant to conventional
therapy in HF.
Other minerals and vitamins
Emerging evidence suggests a pathophysiological role of Zn and
Cu dyshomeostasis in HF, including promotion of adverse
remodelling and clinical deterioration.
Copper. Cu is a redox-active metal, implicated as an enzymic
cofactor in various processes including antioxidant defence
mechanisms (Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, caeruloplasmin),
cellular respiration (cytochrome c oxidase), Fe transport (caeruloplasmin), and cross-linking of collagen and elastin (proteinlysine-6-oxidase)(268).
Zinc. Zn, the second most abundant trace element in the body, is
involved in gene expression, cell growth and differentiation as a
catalytic and structural cofactor. It is implicated in the antioxidant
defence and regulation of various metalloproteases (for example, angiotensin-converting enzyme, matrix metalloproteinases,
and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase) associated with the healing
process, playing a pivotal role in counteracting stress-induced
detrimental changes(269). In a study carried out on 125 HF
patients and twenty-one healthy volunteers, serum Cu levels
were significantly higher in HFpEF individuals compared with
control (P<0·05). Additionally, serum Cu in patients with LVEF
<40 % was significantly higher compared with both controls
(P<0·001) and HFpEF patients (P = 0·003). Serum Zn was
significantly lower in acute HF (P<0·001) and HF (P = 0·039)
compared with control. Serum Cu was increased both in acute
chronic HF and correlated with LV systolic and diastolic function.
Serum Zn, in contrast, was decreased both in acute HF and
chronic HF and independently predicted by clinical status and
LV diastolic function(270).
Selenium. Severe Se deficiency is an accepted cause of reversible HF, a condition known as Keshan disease(271). A number of
studies have suggested an association between less severe Se
deficiency or suboptimal Se status and HF; the majority suggest
that patients with HF tend to have lower circulating levels when
compared with individuals free from the condition. De Lorgeril
et al.(272) observed a significant positive correlation between
blood Se concentration and bicycle exercise stress test maximal
oxygen uptake in twenty-one patients with HF (r 0·9; P = 0·0005),
suggesting an association between Se status and physical
functioning in HF. In addition, in the study by Alehagen et al.(273)
regarding healthy elderly Swedish municipality members, cardiovascular mortality was higher in the subgroup with the lower Se
concentrations <65 μg/l in comparison with those having an
Se concentration >85 μg/l. A 5-year prospective randomised
double-blind placebo-controlled trial among Swedish citizens
aged 70 to 88 years was performed in 443 participants given combined supplementation of Se and CoQ10 or a placebo. During a
follow-up time of 5·2 years a significant reduction in cardiovascular
mortality was found in the active treatment group v. the placebo
group (5·9 v. 12·6 %; P = 0·015). NT-proBNP levels were significantly lower in the active group compared with the placebo group
(mean values: 214 v. 302 ng/l at 48 months; P = 0·014). In echocardiography a significant better cardiac function score was found in
the active supplementation compared with the placebo group
(P = 0·03)(274).
In summary, patients with HF tend to have lower circulating
levels of Se and Zn and higher levels of Cu, when compared with
healthy individuals; however, the prognostic importance and
clinical relevance still need to be investigated(275,276).
Riboflavin and pyridoxine. Riboflavin and pyridoxine levels
were measured in 100 patients admitted to a hospital with HF,
and fifty age- and sex-matched controls. The percentage of individuals with evidence of riboflavin deficiency (erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient >1·2) was significantly
higher in patients with HF compared with controls (27·0 v.
2·2 %; P<0·001). At the same time, the percentage of patients
with pyridoxine deficiency (plasma pyridoxine concentration
<4·9 ng/ml (<20 nmol/l)) was also significantly higher in
patients with HF (38·0 v. 19·0 %; P = 0·02)(277). The clinical relevance of these findings has yet to be clarified.
Vitamin B12. Observational studies investigating vitamin B12
status in the setting of HF have demonstrated conflicting
results. Some authors suggest no correlation between LVEF and
vitamin B12 or folate concentration, in 349 patients undergoing
coronary angiography and left ventriculography(278,279). In a
larger study carried out on 987 HF patients, vitamin B12 levels
were weakly negatively correlated with LVEF (r –0·1;
P = 0·015) and weakly positively correlated with NT-proBNP

(r 0·1; P = 0·004). In addition, mean serum vitamin B12 concentration increased significantly with increasing NYHA class. No
relationship was observed between folate status and markers
of HF severity(280). An open study without placebo control
by Andersson et al.(281) evaluated treatment with pyridoxine
(3 mg/d), folate (0·8 mg/d) and vitamin B12 (0·5 mg/d) for
6 weeks in fourteen elderly patients with HF. Treatment was
associated with a significant increase in mean plasma folate concentration, but this was not associated with any significant
change in levels of NT-proBNP. However, a significant decrease
in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate was observed
(95·8 to 90·2 mmHg and 75·0 to 70·0 beats per min, respectively;
P<0·05 for both)(281). Further studies are still necessary in HF
settings.
Discussion and future directions
In the times of a huge number of supplements and natural products available on the market, it is necessary and critical to present
data only for those that have any evidence-based medical data
on efficacy and safety in different conditions, such as lipid disorders(282,283), hypertension(284), the metabolic syndrome(285)
and CVD, including its complication – HF. Only then, remembering that nutraceuticals might be considered only as an addition to
optimal therapy, we will avoid overusing these, very often useless preparations; on the other hand, we might help in optimising
the applied pharmacotherapy.
Based on the available data it was suggested that a low intake
of some nutraceuticals, vitamins and minerals has been associated with an increased risk of developing HF, and supplementation with some nutraceuticals has been reported to improve
different parameters related to HF, even on top of guidelinedriven conventional treatment. Nutraceutical components with
a potential impact on HF have not yet been deeply investigated.
For instance, amino acids (AA) are important constituents of
muscle proteins and exert many activities as regulators of both
myocardium protein turnover(286,287) and energy metabolism(288).
The heart’s reliance on AA increases during HF because of
high myocardium anabolic activity and cardiomyocyte energy
shortage(289). Thus, it has been supposed that the lack of AA
intake or absorption could further impair myocardium metabolism in HF patients. In a study involving forty-one patients
with clinically stable HF (NYHA class II to IV), compared with
controls, HF patients had reduced arterial AA levels, of which
both their number and reduced rates were associated with
HF severity. Arterial aspartic acid correlated with stroke volume
index (r 0·626; P<0·0001) and cardiac index (r 0·424;
P = 0·0028). The content of arterial aspartic acid (μmol/l) multiplied by the cardiac index was associated with LVEF (r 0·377;
P = 0·0076). All NYHA groups had adequate protein intake
(≥1·1 g/kg per d) and inadequate energy intake (kJ < resting
energy expenditure (REE) × 1·3) was found only in class IV
patients. The study showed that HF patients had reduced
arterial AA levels directly related to clinical disease severity
and LV dysfunction(290). However, no intervention trial, similarly
to other studies with nutraceuticals in HF settings, has yet demonstrated that AA supplementation could have a positive impact
on HF.
It has also to be investigated if a combination of nutraceuticals
could exert a more relevant impact on HF-related parameters
compared with supplementation with a single dietary factor.
To date, two studies have measured the effect of a combination
multivitamin–multimineral supplement on patients with HF. In
the first study, forty-one patients (LVEF ≤40 %) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft were randomised to receive a nutritional
supplement containing vitamins, minerals, CoQ10 (150 mg/dose)
and carnitine (3 g/dose) or placebo. Treatment with the nutritional
supplement was associated with a significant fall in mean LV enddiastolic volume (170·5 ml to 158·9 ml; P<0·05)(291). Witte et al.(163)
observed similar results in a trial involving thirty-three HF subjects
randomised to receive a multivitamin–multimineral supplement
containing coenzyme Q10 (150 mg/dose) or placebo. After 1 year
of treatment, serum levels of folate and vitamin B12 increased
significantly in the micronutrient group. This was associated with
a significant increase in mean LVEF (25·6 to 30·9 %; P<0·05) and a
significant increase in mean QoL HF-related tool score (64·4 to
73·9 %; P<0·05), suggesting a significant QoL improvement(163).
Both studies were, however, very small, and so it cannot be concluded that this approach would be a positive suggestion. In fact,
this is another main limitation of available data on nutraceutical
application in HF patients (relatively small studies, mainly with
short-term follow-up), so in most of the cases it is impossible to
draw any reliable recommendations.
In conclusion, a growing body of clinical evidence suggests
that the intake of adequate dosages of some nutraceuticals (hawthorn extract, CoQ10, L-carnitine, D-ribose, carnosine, vitD, probiotics, n-3 PUFA and beet nitrates) might be associated with
improvements in self-perceived QoL and/or functional parameters such as EF, stroke volume and cardiac output in HF patients,
with minimal or no side effects. Those benefits tended to be
greater in earlier HF stages. Efficacy on at least one major
cardiovascular event is documented in larger RCT for CoQ10
(Q-SYMBIO trial, 2 years, 420 patients), hawthorn (SPICE trial, 1
year, 2681 patients), n-3 PUFA (GISSI-HF, 3·9 years; 6975 patients).
For the rest of the above-mentioned nutraceuticals, we still
require longer studies and data on their efficacy from the
Cardiovascular Outcome Trial. In no case can the use of nutraceuticals be substituted for the consolidated pharmacological treatment
of HF.
