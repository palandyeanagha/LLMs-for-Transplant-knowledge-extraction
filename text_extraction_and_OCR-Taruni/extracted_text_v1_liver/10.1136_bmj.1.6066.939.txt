Sex-related differences among 100 patients with alcoholic
liver disease
MARSHA Y MORGAN, SHEILA SHERLOCK
Bri'tish Medical J7ournal, 1977, 1, 939-941
Summary
During 1975 we studied 100 patients-77 men and 23
women-who had a history of alcohol abuse and disturbed liver function test results. On presentation the
women were less likely to be suspected of alcohol abuse
(9; 38%) than the men (59; 77%). Although the quantity
of alcohol consumed and length of history of alcohol
abuse were similar for men and women, the incidence
of chronic advanced liver disease was higher among
women (86%) than among men (65%). Women, however,
were less likely to have developed primary liver cell
cancer. Overall the women had a higher incidence of
other alcohol-related disorders and were less likely to
stop abusing alcohol (2; 9%) than were their male
counterparts (22; 29%). Women seem to be more susceptible to alcohol-related disease.
Introduction
In 1945 Spain' reported that women with alcoholic cirrhosis
died younger than men, and that death among women was
usually secondary to hepatocellular failure, whereas in men it
was related to portal hypertension. Since then few studies of
alcohol-related liver disease have taken into account sex
differences. 2-6 We therefore studied the drinking patterns,
presentation, clinical picture, and prognosis in men and women
seen at The Royal Free Hospital, London, (RFH) during 1975
who had a history of alcohol abuse and disturbed liver function
test results.
Patients and methods
The medical unit at RFH has a special interest in hepatology, and
the hospital, by virtue of its geographical situation, draws a fairly

high percentage of its patients from the upper social classes. Both
these factors affected the characteristics of the population in this
study.
During 1975 516 patients with liver disease were admitted to the
medical unit. All were interviewed and 100 were identified as alcohol
abusers, drinking regularly above 100 g of ethanol per kg body weight
per day. This level of consumption, if sustained, carries the risk of
physical complications.2 Socioeconomic circumstances and drinking
habits were recorded, social class being defined by occupation7 and
highest class achieved. Married women were classed according to their
husband's occupations. A family history of alcoholism was sought.
The age of onset of regular drinking and of regular heavy drinking was
recorded, and so far as possible the type and amount of beverage
consumed per day were assessed. Patients were judged to be physically
dependent on alcohol if they gave a history of tremor after a period of
abstinence, which was relieved by alcohol, and of episodes of amnesia.
The occurrence of episodes of delirium tremens-characterised by
disorientation, delusions, visual hallucinations, and fear and accompanied by restlessness, hyperactivity, and possibly epileptiform fitswere noted. Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed in all patients
except three.
While in hospital patients were forcefully and repeatedly warned
of the dangers of alcohol abuse. After discharge these warnings were
repeated at regular outpatient attendances. Blood ethanol concentrations were a valuable guide to continuing alcohol abuse.8 All patients
were referred to their general practitioners and when necessary to
social services. Alcoholics Anonymous was discussed. Only 9'0, of the
patients were thought to require consultant psychiatric help at the
start of the study. Patients alive at the end of the year were reviewed.
Data were analysed using the 2 x 2( test, Fisher's exact probability
test, or the Mann-Whitney U test.10
Results
The 100 patients (77 men and 23 woman) who were identified as
alcohol abusers accounted for 19 4>, of the total admissions for liver
disease. In 690 alcohol abuse had been suspected at first presentation
whether at RFH or elsewhere. Women were less likely to be suspected
of alcohol abuse (9; 38",) than men (59; 770o) (P < 0 001). Two case
histories of women patients illustrate this point.

alcohol abuse. (A percutaneous liver biopsy was reported as micronodular
cirrhosis, probably biliary in origin, with ascending cholangitis and severe
fatty change.) At laparotomy the gall bladder contained a single stone and
was removed. An operative cholangiogram showed normal ducts.
In January 1975 she was readmitted with anorexia, weight loss of 20 kg,
and return of jaundice. She deteriorated rapidly and was transferred to the
RFH. She had gross hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. The liver biopsy
report from 1974 was reviewed and interpreted as cirrhosis with severe
alcoholic hepatitis. She admitted that she had been drinking three-quarters
of a bottle of sherry per day for the last seven years, but emphasised that
previously she had never been questioned concerning alcohol intake.
CASE 2
For two years a 57-year-old woman doctor married to a general practitioner
had suffered recurring bouts of anorexia, nausea, and shivering. She had
seen seven consultant physicians and each had diagnosed only depression.
She had received electric convulsion therapy. In July 1974 while on holiday
she became extremely tremulous and had a grand mal fit, presumably
secondary to alcohol withdrawal. Her husband became suspicious of her
alcohol intake and sent her to a new general practitioner, who found
hepatomegaly. He referred her to the RFH, where in January 1975 a liver
biopsy showed severe alcoholic hepatitis. She and her husband refused
further help, preferring to cope with the problem together.
Of the patients, 49 men (64%0) and 16 women (69',',) were married
or remarried; 18"% of both sexes were divorced-a rate of divorce no
higher than that of the country as a whole. 9 In Great Britain 25 of the
population are of social Classes I or II9-the professional and higher
managerial classes. Many of the patients in this study were of social
class I or II-40 (52"%) men and 13 (58"',) women. Of both sexes
200/ worked in the hotel and catering trade, but "business executives"
comprised the highest percentage of the male patients (35; 46°,) and
"housewives" the highest percentage of the female admissions (12;
52'Y,,). Half of the men and 670) of the women had a positive family
history of alcohol abuse.
Patients of both sexes began to abuse alcohol at a similar agethe mean age for men was 29-2 years (range 17-57 years), and for
women 33 years (range 14-63 years). Women of the higher social
classes tended to start drinking at a later age. The amount of alcohol
consumed/kg body weight/day was difficult to assess but all the
patients had been drinking over 100 g ethanol daily for at least three
years. The pattern of abuse was similar, usually constant imbibing,
only two men being "binge" drinkers. Although the quantity consumed was similar, the beverages favoured differed between the
sexes. Fifty-nine of the men (77))/)) and 16 (70)%.) of the women drank
predominantly spirits (gin, vodka, whisky, brandy). Fourteen of
the men (180))) drank beer only compared with only one of the
women (40),), while five (7(yo) of the men drank fortified wines (sherry
and martini) compared with six (26o%) of the women. Overall, 2°, of
the group drank wine exclusively. In both sexes cheaper beverages
were favoured by those in the lower social classes.
The mean age at presentation for the men-47 3 years (range 23-74
years)-was not statistically different from that of the women47 9 years (range 16-72 years). Similarly the mean length of history of
alcohol abuse among the men-20 4 years (range 3-52 years) did not
differ statistically from that among the women-16 8 years (range
3-40 years).
The commonest mode of presentation was a raised aspartate transaminase (AST) concentration with or without hepatomegaly (table
I). Among the men this was often found during a routine medical
insurance examination. Thirty per cent of women presented with
hepatocellular failure (jaundice, ascites, peripheral oedema). Seven
male patients (9 0) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding but in only
one patient was this from oesophageal varices.
Although results of liver function tests for all patients were abnormal,
biopsy findings were normal for nine men (120))) (table II). Sixty per

cent of the group had cirrhosis with or without alcoholic hepatitis.
The women showed a higher incidence of more severe liver disease;
86", had hepatitis with or without cirrhosis as compared with 650,,
of the men. Five of the 41 men with cirrhosis (12"/,) developed
primary liver cell cancer. Three of these patients had stopped drinking
alcohol four, five, and seven years previously. None of the women
developed primary liver cell cancer.
Physical dependency on alcohol was noted among 65)S, of patients
of both sexes. Twenty per cent of the patients gave a history of
delirium tremens. There was no relation between the length of history
of alcohol abuse and dependency, nor between the severity of the liver
lesion and dependency. Overall, there was a higher incidence of
other alcohol-related disorders among women, although none of the
women developed peptic ulceration or tuberculosis (table III).
Peripheral neuropathy and peptic ulceration were associated with
more advanced liver disease but pancreatitis was not.
At the end of the year 10 men (13%,) and five women (220))) had
died. There was no common mode of death. All these patients had
cirrhosis with or without hepatitis, and two of the men had primary
liver cell cancer. The mean ages at death for men and women59 3 years and 46-8 years respectively-and the length of history of
alcohol abuse were similar.'0 Seventy-six patients were continuing to abuse alcohol at the end of the year. The women were significantly less likely to stop drinking (2; 9%) than were the men (22;
290/ ) (P < 0 05). Patients with cirrhosis were more likely to stop
drinking than were patients with less advanced liver disease (P < 0-005).
Discussion
More patients are being referred with alcoholic liver disease.
Ten years ago about 30-40 patients were admitted each year to
our unit with alcohol-related liver disease.4 Last year 100 such
patients were admitted. This reflects the increased incidence
of alcohol abuse in Great Britain in recent years, and its role
as a major cause of liver damage.
The male: female ratio of alcoholics agrees with that given
by Glatt"5 for alcoholics in Great Britain. Women are less likely
to be suspected of alcohol abuse, even if they develop withdrawal symptoms in hospital. There are several reasons for this.
Because of social stigma a woman is less likely to admit to
alcohol abuse. She also has much greater opportunities to
"cover up." If she drinks at home alone during the day her
family are often unaware of her problem, as she has usually
"sobered up" by the time they arrive home in the evening. The
family of the female alcoholic may therefore deny her alcoholism
to her doctors, an attitude rarely encountered in the relativies of
male alcoholics. Finally, doctors have a much lower index of
suspicion for alcohol abuse in women and are often repeatedly
"taken in" by the highly plausible female alcoholic. This is well
illustrated by the case histories cited. The divorce rate was the
same for men and women and similar to that of the whole
country. This is at variance with Glatt's findings,"' who noted

that the husbands of alcoholic women were more likely to leave
their wives than were the wives of alcoholic men to leave their
husbands. This is of great importance because it means that a
high percentage of our patients have a degree of background
stability.
The high incidence of patients in the higher social classes
is in part a feature of population selection because of the location
of the RFH in Hampstead, London. Men in the higher social
classes also often undertake private medical insurance examinations so that there is a high "pick-up" rate of asymptomatic
alcoholics from this group. The high incidence of a positive
family history accords with that found in many other series.
Nylander, 2 for example, showed that sons of alcoholics have a
much higher incidence of alcoholism than other men of the
same age. Differences in the type of beverage consumed reflect
social conventions. Women generally do not drink beer but
favour fortified wines, gin, or vodka. Men prefer beer, whisky,
or brandy. Cost also determines the beverage chosen, and
availability is important. Many women who would previously
not have visited an off-licence will quite happily buy alcohol
from the supermarket with the family shopping.
The length of history and the age at presentation were
similar for both sexes. Women presented with more established
disease, which suggests that they develop cirrhosis after a
shorter period of alcohol abuse. Caroli and Pequignot,' found
that women developed cirrhosis at a lower level of alcohol intake
than men. Wilkinson et al3 in Melbourne found alcoholic
cirrhosis twice as often in women. The women had a shorter
history of alcohol abuse and this suggested that they were
more susceptible to alcoholic liver damage.
Of the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, five of the men but
none of the women developed primary liver cell cancer. Lee13
found that the incidence of primary liver cell cancer was highest
among patients who had given up alcohol and who had developed
a coarsely nodular cirrhosis. He suggested that women often
continued drinking until death and so the cirrhosis remained
micronodular. This explained their low risk of developing
primary liver cell cancer. In our series three of the five men who
developed this tumour had given up alcohol several years ago.
In contrast to the findings of Wilkinson et al,'4 and of Brunt4
there was a much higher incidence of other alcohol-related
disorders among women. The female alcoholic appears more
susceptible not only to liver damage but also to other types of
alcohol-related physical injury.
The age at death and the mortality rates were similar for
both sexes, confirming the results of Powell and Klatskin,5 and
Brunt.4 Others have shown that women die from alcoholic
liver disease at a younger age than men.1 6 Women alcoholics
are generally regarded as more difficult to treat than men, and
this is supported by the significantly higher number who
continued to abuse alcohol. Many of these women were bored
and lonely housewives without a career, who return after discharge from hospital to an environment in which they are
largely unsupervised. Efforts must be made to find these women
employment, if only voluntary, to take them out of their home
environment.
Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to
alcohol-related diseases, particularly liver disease. Their
condition is less easily diagnosed and more difficult to treat.
Early diagnosis of alcoholism is of utmost importance. More
vigilance and a higher degree of suspicion of possible alcohol
abuse among female patients is needed.

compared to see how effectively they reduced concentrations of halothane in the atmosphere. All five systems
reduced halothane levels significantly, the combination
of an active system and semiclosed circuitry being the
most effective. All obvious leaks from equipment were
controlled in this study, but normally such leaks contribute significantly to atmospheric pollution. Some of
the benefits of a scavenging system may be lost if
gases can still escape through leaks.
Introduction
Various epidemiological studies have suggested an association
between atmospheric pollution by anaesthetic gases and vapours
and toxic effects in operating theatre staff.1-4 Volatile and
gaseous agents are an integral part of general anaesthesia, and
waste gases escape into the atmosphere of the operating area.
