Abstract
Background: Fluid boluses are administered to septic shock patients with the purpose of increasing cardiac output
as a means to restore tissue perfusion. Unfortunately, fluid therapy has a narrow therapeutic index, and therefore,
several approaches to increase safety have been proposed. Fluid responsiveness (FR) assessment might predict
which patients will effectively increase cardiac output after a fluid bolus (FR+), thus preventing potentially harmful
fluid administration in non-fluid responsive (FR−) patients. However, there are scarce data on the impact of
assessing FR on major outcomes.
The recent ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial included systematic per-protocol assessment of FR. We performed a post hoc
analysis of the study dataset with the aim of exploring the relationship between FR status at baseline, attainment of
specific targets, and clinically relevant outcomes.
Methods: ANDROMEDA-SHOCK compared the effect of peripheral perfusion- vs. lactate-targeted resuscitation on
28-day mortality. FR was assessed before each fluid bolus and periodically thereafter. FR+ and FR− subgroups,
independent of the original randomization, were compared for fluid administration, achievement of resuscitation
targets, vasoactive agents use, and major outcomes such as organ dysfunction and support, length of stay, and 28-
day mortality.
Results: FR could be determined in 348 patients at baseline. Two hundred and forty-two patients (70%) were
categorized as fluid responders. Both groups achieved comparable successful resuscitation targets, although nonfluid responders received less resuscitation fluids (0 [0–500] vs. 1500 [1000–2500] mL; p 0.0001), exhibited less
positive fluid balances, but received more vasopressor testing. No difference in clinically relevant outcomes
between FR+ and FR− patients was found, including 24-h SOFA score (9 [5–12] vs. 8 [5–11], p = 0.4), need for MV
(78% vs. 72%, p = 0.16), need for RRT (18% vs. 21%, p = 0.7), ICU-LOS (6 [3–11] vs. 6 [3–16] days, p = 0.2), and 28-day
mortality (40% vs. 36%, p = 0.5). Only thirteen patients remained fluid responsive along the intervention period.
Conclusions: Systematic assessment allowed determination of fluid responsiveness status in more than 80% of
patients with early septic shock. Fluid boluses could be stopped in non-fluid responsive patients without any
negative impact on clinical relevant outcomes. Our results suggest that fluid resuscitation might be safely guided
by FR assessment in septic shock patients.

Keywords: Septic shock, Fluid responsiveness, Fluid overload, Early resuscitation,
Background
Fluid administration is the first line therapy to reverse sepsisinduced tissue hypoperfusion [1, 2]. For this purpose, fluids
are administered either as fluid loading at the emergency department [2], or later as fluid challenges during advanced intensive care unit (ICU)-based resuscitation [3]. However, as
any other drug, fluids have a narrow therapeutic index. Insufficient fluid resuscitation may lead to progressive tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction [4], while excess fluids
could induce detrimental fluid overload [5–8].
Fluid responsiveness (FR) is a physiologic cardiovascular
condition where an increase in preload induced by a fluid
bolus leads to an increase in cardiac output (CO) by more
than 10–15% [9–11]. In non-fluid responsive (FR−) patients, fluid administration does not significantly increase
CO and may contribute to congestion and fluid overload.
The rationale to assess FR is then to try to optimize fluid
resuscitation in critically ill patients by focusing fluid boluses in FR+ hypoperfused patients and by preventing
harmful fluid administration in FR− patients.
Multiple tests have been described to assess FR at the
bedside [12–15]. They allow to determine the position of
the patient’s heart on its systolic function curve. By applying
the appropriate tests, FR can be assessed in a wide variety
of clinical settings [16–18]. However, despite their relative
simplicity, lack of cost, and side effects, the use of FR tests
has not completely permeated into routine clinical practice
[19, 20]. Moreover, recent major septic shock studies did
not include systematic assessment of FR as part of the research protocols [21–25]. Only a few small pilot sepsis
studies have tested the impact of FR assessment on major
outcomes without conclusive results [26–29]. Indeed, a
major problem is that despite a relatively sound physiological background, the concept of FR has not yet demonstrated its usefulness to improve the quality or safety of
fluid administration during septic shock resuscitation.
ANDROMEDA-SHOCK is the first major study that
incorporated systematic per-protocol assessment of FR
[30] and thus provides the opportunity to get insight
into the potential clinical relevance of this monitoring.
We performed a post hoc analysis of the study dataset
with the aim of exploring the relationship between FR
status at baseline, fluid administration, attainment of
specific targets, and clinically relevant outcomes.
Materials and methods
The complete protocol, statistical analysis, and main results of the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial have been
previously published [30–32]. Institutional review boards
at each participating center approved the study. Informed consent was obtained directly from the patients
or the surrogates.
The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial was a prospective,
multicenter, parallel-group randomized control trial conducted in 5 Latin-American countries from March 2017
to March 2018, including a total of 424 patients with
septic shock. Its main objective was to evaluate the impact on 28-day mortality of a peripheral perfusion
(PPTR)- vs. lactate level-targeted resuscitation (LTR)
over an 8-h intervention period. Eligible patients were
included within a time frame of 4 h after the diagnosis
[28], and they were subjected to a sequential and stepwise resuscitation algorithm aiming to normalize capillary refill time (CRT, < 3 s) vs. to normalize arterial
lactate levels (< 2 mmol/L or at least, 20% decrease every
2 h).
The goal of fluid resuscitation in the ANDROMEDASHOCK trial was to restore tissue perfusion as represented by CRT or lactate targets. Fluid responsiveness
was assessed before each fluid bolus and periodically
during the 8-h intervention period. Specific tests were
selected according to the particular clinical context and
local preferences [31]. A decision algorithm was proposed to guide FR assessment in complex cases (Additional file 1). Only tests with a validated cutoff for a 10–
15% increase in CO after a fluid challenge were allowed
[13, 14, 17, 33, 34]. A detailed description of each used
test including its cutoffs is presented in Additional file 2.
Obligatory CO assessment was not part of the protocol,
and thus, prediction of FR status was based on previously reported cutoffs for each test.
Fluid resuscitation was indicated and focused on perfusion target achievement. As a general principle, fluid
boluses were administered only to patients in a FR+ status as part of protocolized resuscitation aimed at achieving the specific allocated target.
Fluid resuscitation was avoided in patients with a demonstrated FR− status. In these patients, further resuscitation when required was performed applying non-fluidrelated steps of the protocol [31]. Whatever the FR status, further fluid boluses were not administered when
perfusion targets were achieved in each group.
The first resuscitation step for FR+ patients in the
PPTR group was to administer a fluid bolus of 500 mL
of crystalloids every 30 min until normalizing CRT. Status of FR and central venous pressure (CVP) were
Kattan et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:23 Page 2 of 9

reassessed after each fluid bolus, and fluids were stopped
before achieving the target if the patient turned FR− or
if CVP increased ≥ 5 mmHg. In the LTR group, lactate
was measured every 2 h and further fluid resuscitation
was decided depending on target achievement. During
the 2-h time intervals, 500-mL fluid boluses were repeatedly administered every 30 min, provided that the patient did not become FR− or the CVP safety limit was
not reached in the meantime.
If patients did not achieve the perfusion target for
whatever reason during the fluid resuscitation step, the
next protocol interventions were vasopressor or inodilator tests as previously reported [30]. All interventions
had predefined safety limits [31, 35], including fluid administration in patients in whom FR could not be
determined.
Data collection and statistical analysis
Data for this study were obtained from the original
ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial database. Patients were
categorized according to FR status at baseline into three
groups: FR+, FR−, and non-assessable. Only patients in
whom FR could be determined were considered for further analysis.
The main outcome was 28-day mortality, while clinically relevant secondary outcomes were daily sequential
organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores [35], need of
mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement
therapy (RRT), MV days, and ICU and hospital length of
stay (LOS), among others [30].
Demographic and clinical data, including age, comorbidities (Charlson score), severity scores, source, and
hemodynamic and perfusion variables, were registered at
baseline. All protocol-related procedures and monitoring
were recorded during the 8-h intervention period, including repeated FR assessment, resuscitation and total
fluids, and fluid balances. FR was assessed before any
fluid bolus, but also at predefined intervals during the
intervention period.
After discarding normal distribution, non-parametric
tests were selected to determine differences between
groups. Descriptive statistics are shown as median [interquartile range] or percentage (%) accordingly. MannWhitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, Fisher’s exact,
and Z-proportion tests, with Bonferroni’s post hoc correction, were used when appropriate. Data was analyzed
with Minitab v17 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) and
Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Softwares, La Joya, CA)
softwares. Two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Fluid responsiveness was unavailable in 76 patients at
baseline, and this increased to 104 at 8 h. The group of
patients categorized as with unavailable FR status over
time (0 to 8 h) was the sum of early deaths and patients in whom it could be not determined mainly because of technical reasons. FR could be determined in
348 of 424 patients (82%) at randomization time. Of
this sample, 242 (70%) patients were categorized as
fluid responders. These FR+ patients had received a
pre-protocol fluid loading of 26.7 [17–40] vs. 26.8
[20–38] mL/kg (p = 0.8) in FR− patients. Baseline
demographic and severity characteristics of groups are
shown in Table 1. A description of the whole population including the group of patients in whom FR
could not be determined is shown in
Additional file 3.
Evolution of perfusion-related parameters during the
intervention period for each group is presented in Additional file 4. No difference in clinically relevant outcomes between FR+ and FR− patients at baseline was
observed, including 24-h SOFA score (9 [5–12] vs. 8 [5–
11], p = 0.4), need for MV (78% vs. 72%, p = 0.16), MV
days (4 [2–10] vs. 5 [2–14], p = 0.2), need for RRT (18%
vs. 21%, p = 0.7), ICU-LOS (6 [3–11] vs. 6 [3–16] days,
p = 0.2), hospital LOS (13 [5–39] vs. 16 [8–28] days, p =
0.2), and 28-day mortality (40% vs. 36%, p = 0.5).
Achievement of resuscitation targets was comparable
between FR+ and FR− subgroups at 2 and 8 h, but the
trend was significantly higher for FR+ (Fig. 1). Use of
fluids and vasoactive drugs during the study protocol is
shown in Table 2. Fluid responders received significantly
more fluids and completed the intervention period, with
a more positive fluid balance. No statistically significant
difference was found in norepinephrine requirements.
On the other hand, more patients in the FR− group
underwent a vasopressor or an inodilator test. Fluid balance (2056 [1012–3746] vs. 1650 [550–2560] mL; p =
0.02) was also significantly more positive at 24 h in the
FR+ group.
Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were mechanically ventilated at the start of the protocol (77%). Different tests were used for the assessment of FR as
depicted in Table 3. The most commonly used techniques in mechanically ventilated patients were pulse
pressure variation (PPV) [36], and passive leg raising
(PLR) with pulse pressure (PLR-PP) [14, 16] or velocity
time integral (PLR-VTI). In non-ventilated patients, the
most frequently used tests were PLR-PP and PLR-VTI.
Fluid responsiveness results for each test are shown in
Additional file 5.
Most patients evolved into a fluid-unresponsive state
during the 8-h intervention period (Fig. 2). Of note, less
than 15% of patients became FR+ at any time point in
the FR− group, and only 13 patients that were FR+ at
baseline maintained this status at the end of the intervention period.

Discussion
Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (a)
fluid responsiveness status could be determined in 82%
of early septic shock patients by using diverse tests depending on the clinical context; (b) 30% of patients were
already non-fluid responsive before starting ICUbased resuscitation; and (c) despite receiving less
fluids, non-fluid responders at baseline resolved hypoperfusion in a similar proportion than FR+ patients
by following other steps of the protocol with no difference in clinically relevant outcomes. Our results do
not support a clear benefit of FR assessment on
major outcomes but suggest that withholding fluid
boluses in FR− patients appears to be safe.
Fluid overload has been associated with increased
mortality and morbidity in patients with septic shock.
Therefore, several strategies to deliver fluid resuscitation in a more physiologic, rational, and restrictive
way are being tested in ongoing trials [25, 37].
Among these strategies, early use of vasopressor
support [24, 38], and selecting more flow-sensitive
and rapid-response targets [30], could be promising.
Systematic assessment of FR might aid in preventing
unnecessary fluid administration in FR− patients.
However, one major concern could be the potential
harm of restricting fluids during septic shock resuscitation. The 30% of patients who were FR− at baseline
received around 1000 mL less fluids than FR+ patients
during the first 2 h and 1500 mL less during the overall 8-h intervention period. Remarkably, they achieved
resuscitation targets in the same proportion as FR+
patients, and exhibited comparable mortality and
organ dysfunction improvement. Thus, these data suggest that stopping fluid resuscitation in FR− patients
appears to be safe. Nevertheless, FR− patients were
more frequently subjected to a protocolized vasopressor test to increase mean arterial pressure target in
previously hypertensive patients, and/or to inodilators
aimed at resolving hypoperfusion instead of insisting
on fluid administration.

Although there is an extensive literature on the fluid
responsiveness concept and background physiology, as
well as on assessment techniques, the use of FR tests is
not considered as a standard of care, nor has been included in recent septic shock trials. There are many possible explanations for this fact. First, some of these
techniques are time-consuming, operator-dependent,
not universally applicable, and with many inherent limitations. Second, there is a gray zone around the published cutoff values that somehow turns decision-making
on further fluid resuscitation uncertain and complex [9].
Third, there are many misconceptions on the subject,
particularly the erroneous idea that turning patients into
a fluid-unresponsive state, which by definition is physiologically abnormal, is a valid objective. Therefore, the
use of FR assessment could paradoxically lead to a potential fluid overload instead of preventing it. Fourth, the
relevance of FR assessment for guiding therapy or the
impact on major outcomes has not been demonstrated.
Only 4 small randomized controlled studies including a
total of 365 septic patients [26–29, 39] compared fluid
responsiveness-guided resuscitation to standard techniques, and found no significant difference in major or
secondary outcomes. However, the studies involved
highly heterogeneous cohorts of patients and settings,
and were probably underpowered to detect real differences. In this sense, although this study did not demonstrate outcome differences, it supports the idea that
restricting fluid boluses in FR− septic shock patients appears at least to be safe. Future appropriately powered
studies, and eventually with a randomized controlled design, should determine the definitive role of systematic
FR assessment in septic shock resuscitation strategies.
The behavior of FR status during the 8-h intervention
period in our cohort is intriguing. The effect of fluid boluses on CO and fluid responsiveness is thought to be

Kattan et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:23 Page 6 of 9

transient based on previous pharmacodynamic studies
[40]. This has been attributed to capillary leakage or
blood redistribution from stressed to unstressed volumes
[3, 9]. In our study, we did not assess CO systematically,
but found that the FR+ status disappeared in almost all
patients after receiving a median of only 1500 mL during
the intervention period. We do not have an explanation
for this finding, but the fact that only 40% of the initial
FR+ patients were still fluid responsive 2 h after inclusion reinforces the idea that FR should be periodically
reassessed when performing an active septic shock resuscitation [41]. On the other hand, it is unclear why so
many patients exhibited a FR− state so early during resuscitation. Pre-ICU fluid loading might be responsible
for this observation, but the amount of fluids received
was within the limits of current recommendations. Unfortunately, the diastolic and systolic cardiac functions
were not systematically evaluated whereby we cannot
rule out the presence of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction or even previous cardiomyopathy.
This study presents several limitations. First, it has the
inherent limitations of a post hoc analysis, so conclusions should be considered only as hypothesisgenerating. Second, the use of some techniques might be
criticized. PPV was used in one third of the patients,
which is far more than expected considering the numerous limitations of this method [12]. On the other hand
and despite current recommendations [42], PLR-PP was
used more frequently than PLR-VTI to assess FR in
spontaneous breathing patients. This could be also criticized since the changes in pulse pressure during PLR
have a low sensitivity although good specificity to assess
FR [9]. Indeed, a positive test (increase in PP during
PLR) is reliable for detecting a FR+ state, but a negative
test is not. Some centers preferred to start with PLR-PP
which is much faster and easier to be applied on a 24/7
basis especially in resource-constrained settings. Anyway, the fact that the proportion of FR+ versus FR− was
relatively comparable whatever the test used tends to
support its use (Additional file 5). In addition, a recent
retrospective study including 491 patients showed that
changes in CO can be roughly predicted by increases in
PP [43]. Third, our protocol did not mandate advanced
hemodynamic monitoring, and therefore, data on cardiac
output or stroke volume are lacking. Therefore, we acknowledge that classifying patients according to FR status might have some inherent bias since it was not
confirmed by direct CO measurement or an effective
fluid challenge in most of the patients. However, direct
measurements of CO are not always available in clinical
practice [43] and this is one of the general limitations of
FR assessment techniques. Fourth, FR could not be determined in 18% of the patients, mainly because of logistic reasons. Fifth, we cannot support the external validity
of our results, since only centers with experience in FR
assessment were included. Sixth, we did not assess criteria of fluid overload. So, we cannot ensure that
restricting fluid boluses in FR− patients prevented this
complication. Despite all these limitations, it is encouraging that systematic assessment of FR was feasible in a
context of mostly public hospitals in medium-income
countries, and at least, this allowed to safely avoid potentially harmful fluid resuscitation in almost one third
of septic shock patients.
Conclusions
Systematic assessment allowed determination of fluid responsiveness status in more than 80% of patients with
early septic shock. Fluid boluses could be stopped in
non-fluid responsive patients without any negative impact on clinical relevant outcomes. Our results suggest
that fluid resuscitation might be safely guided by FR assessment in septic shock patients.
