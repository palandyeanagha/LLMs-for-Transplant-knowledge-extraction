Abstract
Purpose The Phase 3 ENDEAVOUR study evaluated revusiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic targeting
hepatic transthyretin (TTR) production, for treating cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR)
amyloidosis.
Methods Patients with hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous daily revusiran
500 mg (n = 140) or placebo (n = 66) for 5 days over a week followed by weekly doses. Co-primary endpoints were 6-min walk
test distance and serum TTR reduction.
Results Revusiran treatment was stopped after a median of 6.71 months; the study Sponsor prematurely discontinued dosing due
to an observed mortality imbalance between treatment arms. Eighteen (12.9%) patients on revusiran and 2 (3.0%) on placebo
died during the on-treatment period. Most deaths in both treatment arms were adjudicated as cardiovascular due to heart failure
(HF), consistent with the natural history of the disease. A post hoc safety investigation of patients treated with revusiran found
that, at baseline, a greater proportion of those who died were ≥ 75 years and showed clinical evidence of more advanced HF
compared with those who were alive throughout treatment. Revusiran pharmacokinetic exposures and TTR lowering did not
show meaningful differences between patients who died and who were alive. Revusiran did not deleteriously affect echocardiographic parameters, cardiac biomarkers, or frequency of cardiovascular and HF hospitalization events.
Conclusions Causes for the observed mortality imbalance associated with revusiran were thoroughly investigated and no clear
causative mechanism could be identified. Although the results suggest similar progression of cardiac parameters in both treatment
arms, a role for revusiran cannot be excluded.

Introduction
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis)
is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening disease caused
by misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein that deposits
as amyloid fibrils in multiple organs [1–3]. In hereditary
TTR-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene cause abnormal amyloid proteins to accumulate in tissues including nerves,
heart, and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a multisystem disease with a heterogeneous clinical presentation
[1, 4–6]. Indeed, the majority of patients with hATTR
amyloidosis exhibit a mixed phenotype that includes
cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy [7–10]. Wild-type
(wt) ATTR-mediated amyloidosis is a non-hereditary
type of ATTR amyloidosis, with predominant manifestations of cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF) [11].
In patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy,
TTR amyloid infiltrates the myocardium leading to heart wall
thickening that impairs both diastolic and systolic function
[12]. These patients typically present clinically with progressive symptoms of HF and cardiac arrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation [11–13]. Worsening cardiac function is
also reflected in increases in cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters including longitudinal strain, impairment in ambulatory function, and reduced quality of life
[12, 14]. The presence of cardiac disease in hATTR amyloidosis is associated with poor outcomes, with a median survival
of 3.4 years after diagnosis [15–18]. Death usually occurs
from progressive HF [19].
Revusiran is an RNA interference (RNAi) investigational
therapeutic that was in clinical development for the treatment
of hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy [20]. The drug
comprises a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against a
region of the human TTR mRNA common to wt and documented genetic variants, conjugated to a triantennary Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand that delivers it to the
liver, the primary site of TTR production [20, 21]. Revusiran
is a first-generation GalNAc conjugate based on standard template chemistry. Owing to metabolic stability limitations,
revusiran was dosed weekly at relatively high dosages.
Revusiran was previously studied in a Phase 1 study
in healthy volunteers [20] and a Phase 2 study with an
open-label extension (OLE) in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy [22]. The Phase 3
ENDEAVOUR study was a multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of revusiran in patients with
hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. During the
study, the Sponsor requested that the independent datamonitoring committee (DMC) for the ENDEAVOUR
study assess the benefit–risk profile of revusiran based
on investigators’ concerns about new-onset or worsening
peripheral neuropathy in some participants in the concurrently running Phase 2 OLE [23]. Although the
DMC did not identify any concerns with regard to peripheral neuropathy in the ENDEAVOUR study, an imbalance in mortality in the revusiran arm compared with
placebo was observed. As a result, the Sponsor made
the decision to discontinue revusiran dosing in all ongoing revusiran studies including the Phase 2 OLE.
Here, we present data from the terminated
ENDEAVOUR study.
Methods
Study Oversight
This study was approved by central and local institutional
review boards or ethics committees and performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and
the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human
Use. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. A DMC, comprising a cardiologist,
hepatologist, and statistician, reviewed all pertinent benefit–
risk data and an independent clinical adjudication committee
performed blinded adjudication of the causes of hospitalization and death.
Study Design
ENDEAVOUR was a multicenter, international, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study carried out at
47 sites in 9 countries (UK, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy,
Germany, USA, Belgium, Canada) between December 2014
and March 2017 (NCT02319005). Patients were randomized
(2:1) to receive subcutaneous revusiran (500 mg) or placebo
(normal saline 0.9% for subcutaneous administration) daily
for 5 days during the first week, a dose on Day 7, and a once
weekly dose for the remaining study duration. Treatment
groups were stratified at randomization for New York Heart
Association (NYHA) HF classification (I and II vs. III), TTR
mutation (V122I versus other TTR mutations), and 6-min
walk test distance (6MWT) (≤ 325 m vs. > 325 m).
Patients
Eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, with a documented
TTR mutation and amyloid deposits confirmed by Congo red
(or equivalent) staining or by 99m-technetium scintigraphy
(Grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake; centrally confirmed). In patients
with monoclonal gammopathy, TTR deposition was required
to be confirmed by immunohistochemistry or mass
spectrometry.
358 Cardiovasc Drugs Ther (2020) 34:357–370

Patients had a medical history of HF with at least 1 prior
hospitalization for HF or clinical evidence of HF that required
or was requiring diuretic treatment or was associated with
elevated cardiac biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide
[BNP] > 100 pg/ml or N-terminal prohormone of BNP [NTproBNP] > 400 pg/ml). Further eligibility criteria included evidence of cardiac involvement by echocardiogram (interventricular septum thickness ≥ 12 mm) or endomyocardial biopsy
demonstrating amyloid deposition, Karnofsky performance
status ≥ 50%, 6MWT ≥ 150 m, polyneuropathy disability
score < 3, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN), albumin >
3 g/dl and total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
. Patients with
cardiomyopathy not related to hATTR amyloidosis, NYHA
class IV, uncontrolled hypertension, or ischemic heart disease
were excluded, as were patients with prior or planned heart or
liver transplant during the study. Patients taking TTR stabilizers completed a 14-day wash-out prior to the start of study
drug administration.
Changes to Study Design
During the study, a review of unblinded data by an independent DMC observed an imbalance in mortality in the revusiran
arm compared with placebo. Dosing was discontinued and the
study was terminated; all patients remaining on-study at the
time of study termination were asked to consent to a safety
follow-up period. The safety follow-up period included a
modified early termination (mET) visit and 2 follow-up visits
approximately 30 and 90 days after the mET visit. The second
follow-up visit was considered the end of study visit.
Assessments carried out in these visits are summarized in
Supplementary Fig. 1. Venous lactate and pyruvate measurements from local laboratories were collected only during the
mET and subsequent follow-up visits. For purposes of the
analyses described in this manuscript, mortality and hospitalization data were considered safety endpoints.
Study Endpoints
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change in 6MWT (m)
from baseline to 18 months and the percentage reduction in
serum TTR levels over 18 months. Cardiovascular (CV) mortality, CV hospitalization, and all-cause mortality were originally planned as secondary efficacy endpoints, but have been
moved to safety endpoints as noted above. Echocardiographic
parameters, cardiac biomarkers (troponin I and T and NTproBNP), HF hospitalization, and 99m-technetium scintigraphy and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were
collected as exploratory efficacy endpoints. Not all planned
efficacy endpoints were analyzed due to limited data as a
result of early study termination.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments, including adverse events (AEs), clinical
laboratory testing, urinalysis, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examination, and antidrug antibodies, were
evaluated throughout the study. AEs were coded according to
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 17.1.
The analysis of safety included all events throughout the study
including the safety follow-up period.
Hospitalization and mortality events were collected
throughout the treatment and follow-up period. A blinded,
independent adjudication committee classified whether all
mortality and hospitalization events through the time of database lock were of CV or non-CV origin according to a
prespecified charter.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Based on previous studies, the plasma concentration of
revusiran reached maximum concentration (Cmax) at approximately 2.5 h (Tmax) after subcutaneous injection
[20]. Accordingly, revusiran plasma levels were measured
2.5 h ± 1 h post dose on Day 0, Month 6, and Month 12
using a validated liquid chromatography, high-resolution
accurate-mass mass spectrometry method.
Pharmacodynamic Assessments
Serum TTR levels were measured at baseline, and at Months
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Total serum TTR was quantified using
a custom-developed, validated, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Efficacy Assessments
6MWT was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and
18 months. Cardiac structure and function were assessed
by echocardiogram with Doppler at baseline and every
6 months thereafter. Echocardiograms were obtained at
the study sites according to a prespecified protocol and
underwent blinded assessment in a cardiac imaging core
laboratory. 99m-Technetium scintigraphy and CMR with
late gadolinium enhancement were also obtained at selected sites in a subset of patients. CMR was obtained from
all patients except those with contraindications (i.e., pacemakers, defibrillators, inadequate renal function, or gadolinium allergy).
Cardiac biomarkers were analyzed at a central laboratory:
serum NT-proBNP and troponin T by electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland); troponin I by chemiluminescence assay (Siemens Healthineers,
Erlangen, Germany).
Cardiovasc Drugs Ther (2020) 34:357–370 359

Statistical Analysis
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined
as all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose
of study drug or placebo, was used for efficacy analyses. The safety population comprised all patients who
received at least 1 dose of study drug or placebo (analyzed as treated) and was used for safety analyses. As
there were no differences in randomization and treatment with respect to study drug administration, the
mITT and safety populations were the same.
Planned statistical tests and subgroup analyses for
co-primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints could
not be performed due to premature discontinuation of
dosing and study termination. As a result, hypothesisgenerating analyses were performed to examine changes between treatment arms for co-primary parameters
(6MWT and TTR), key secondary parameters (death
and hospitalizations), and key exploratory parameters
(echo and cardiac biomarkers). One-way analysis of
variance (i.e., Kruskal–Wallis test) was performed to
compare distributions of Cmax between groups (died
versus alive) at each visit and across 3 renal function
groups.
Descriptive statistics were generated for any continuous data. Time from first dose to first event (mortality
and/or hospitalization) analyses used the Kaplan–Meier
method. These event analyses were summarized for 2
time periods, on-treatment and on-study. The ontreatment period was defined as the time from first dose
of study drug to November 4, 2016 (approximately
30 days after notification to the study sites to discontinue
dosing). The on-study period was defined as the time
from the first dose of study drug through the latest day
on-study. Exposure-adjusted mortality and/or hospitalization rates were calculated as total number of events divided by total person-years of exposure. Descriptive statistics
of key cardiac and echocardiogram parameters were examined in a subset of patients with complete (nonmissing) data at baseline and each post-baseline visit up
to and including Month 6 to understand trends over time.
To further understand factors associated with mortality,
patients were compared by outcome (died versus alive)
within the revusiran arm. Comparisons of baseline disease
characteristics and trends in cardiac biomarkers and echo
parameters using all data until Month 6 were also examined. In addition, TTR knockdown over time was compared by outcome within the revusiran arm. Plasma
revusiran Cmax was also summarized by outcome (died
or alive while on-treatment), visit (baseline, Month
6, and Month 12), and renal function (eGFR: 30 to
< 60, 60 to < 90, and ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2
).
Results
Patient Demographics and Disposition
The study was fully enrolled prior to discontinuation. All 206
patients who were enrolled and randomized in the study
(revusiran: n = 140; placebo: n = 66) received at least 1 dose
of study drug (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, 115 patients in
the revusiran arm and 64 patients in the placebo arm were onstudy at the time of dosing discontinuation. The mET visit at
the end of the safety follow-up period was completed by
92 patients in the revusiran arm and 51 patients in the placebo
arm. Owing to the early study termination, the median duration of revusiran treatment was 6.71 months (range
2.11–16.32) and median number of doses of revusiran received was 33.5 doses (range 13–76). There were 36
(25.7%) patients with ≥ 9 months and 16 (11.4%) patients
with ≥ 12 months of exposure to revusiran.
Most patients were male and either white or black/African
American with a median age of 69 years. Demographics were
generally balanced between treatment arms. While age was
balanced between treatment arms, 30.7% of patients treated
with revusiran were age ≥ 75 years compared with 18.2% of
patients on the placebo arm (Table 1).
Baseline disease characteristics were balanced between
treatment arms and demonstrated significant clinical HF.
Cardiac amyloidosis severity, distribution of ATTR mutations,
and renal function were well balanced between arms. All patients had a history of HF with 8.3%, 60.7%, and 31.1% of
patients NYHA classification I, II, or III, respectively. Overall,
24.8% of patients reported medical history of peripheral neuropathy (Table 1). Median (range) troponin I levels were
0.13 μg/l (0–1.66), and median (range) NT-proBNP levels
were 2511 pg/ml (51–32,470). Mean ± standard deviation intraventricular septum wall thickness was 18.3 ± 2.6 mm, average peak longitudinal strain was −10.8 ± 3.5%, and left ventricular ejection fraction was 52.8 ± 11.5%.
Safety and Tolerability
As noted above, the study was prematurely discontinued due
to an imbalance of deaths observed in the revusiran group (18
patients, 12.9%) compared with the placebo group (2 patients,
3.0%) during the on-treatment period (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The
majority of deaths in both groups were CV events, and most
were categorized as HF (Supplementary Table 1). In addition,
there were 2 CV deaths categorized as sudden cardiac death,
with 1 occurring in each treatment arm. Over the course of the
study, including the safety follow-up period, deaths were reported in 23 patients (16.4%) in the revusiran group and
7 patients (10.6%) in the placebo group (Table 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 3). Three of the deaths in the revusiran

group (2 due to cardiac failure and 1 due to congestive cardiac
failure) were considered possibly related to the study drug by
the investigator. The exposure-adjusted CV mortality rates
were 0.168 and 0.042 per person-year in the revusiran and
placebo arms, respectively.
To understand factors associated with mortality, additional
analyses were performed to compare patients in the revusiran
arm who died and those who were alive at the end of the ontreatment period. Demographic and disease characteristics at
baseline showed that a higher percentage of patients in the
revusiran arm who died on-treatment were ≥ 75 years of age,
were categorized as NYHA class III, had a shorter mean
6MWT distance, had lower mean eGFR, had lower mean
cardiac output, and had higher median NT-proBNP and troponin I than those patients who were alive throughout the ontreatment period (Table 4). Mean values of cardiac biomarkers
and echocardiographic assessment indicated more abnormal
values at baseline in patients who died versus patients who
were alive. In patients who died, NT-proBNP and global longitudinal strain showed more worsening through Month 6
compared with patients who were alive (Table 5).
Data on CVand all-cause mortality and hospitalizations are
shown in Table 2. When cardiac serious AEs (SAEs) that
resulted in hospitalization were compared during the ontreatment period, both the proportion of patients who reported
at least 1 CV hospitalization (revusiran: 35.0%; placebo:
31.8%) (Table 2) and the median time to first CV hospitalization (revusiran: 12.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI)
8.8, not reached]; placebo: 12.4 months [95% CI 9.8, not
reached]) (Fig. 2) were similar between the 2 treatment groups
(hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.1 [0.7, 1.8]). The majority of CV
hospitalizations on-treatment in both groups were categorized
as HF (revusiran: 41 of 49 events [83.7%]; placebo: 13 of 21
events [61.9%]). Time to first HF hospitalization by treatment
group demonstrated a trend similar to that observed for CV
hospitalizations, with a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.6 (0.8, 2.9)
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). Exposure-adjusted CV hospitalization
rates per person-years were 0.786 in the revusiran group and
0.797 in the placebo group. The rate of all-cause hospitalization was 47.9% in the revusiran group and 36.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.4 [0.9, 2.2]).
The composite analysis of potentially competing clinical
events, time to CV mortality, or first HF hospitalization ontreatment had a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.5 (0.8, 2.7)
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
During the study, including the safety follow-up period
(Table 3), 97.1% of patients in the revusiran group and
93.9% of patients in the placebo group reported AEs. A higher
proportion of patients in the revusiran group compared with
placebo reported severe AEs (39.3% and 28.8%, respectively), SAEs (59.3% and 51.5%), and AEs that led to discontinuation of treatment (14.3% and 1.5%) or withdrawal from the
trial (6.4% and 0%). In both treatment groups, SAEs of
cardiac failure and cardiac failure acute were reported in ≥
10% of patients (Table 3). AEs that led to discontinuation of
revusiran in ≥ 2 patients were cardiac failure (3.6%) and cardiac failure acute, cardiogenic shock, and cachexia (1.4%
each). The frequency of cardiac SAEs (40.0% and 37.9% in
revusiran and placebo groups, respectively) and cardiac AEs
(58.6% and 54.5%) were balanced between the revusiran and
placebo arms (Table 3) with the AEs in both arms being similar in nature.
As patients with HF often have concomitant hepatic or renal
impairment, additional analyses assessed hepatic and renal
events. More patients in the revusiran group (34.3%) had hepatic events than in the placebo group (13.6%) (Table 3). Of
these, the majority of patients had hepatic events that
corresponded to laboratory abnormalities and were considered

Similarly, more patients in the revusiran group (22.1%)
had renal events than in placebo (10.6%) (Table 3). The
majority of patients had renal events that were considered
mild or moderate in severity. Serious renal events were reported in 6 (4.3%) patients in the revusiran group and 3
(4.5%) patients in the placebo group. In both groups, the
patients had medical conditions or factors that contributed
to these events, including concomitant worsening of endstage HF, multisystem organ failure with infected pleural
effusion and cardiac cachexia, concurrent hypotension or
hypovolemia, and acute diverticulitis with diarrhea and volume overload.

Peripheral neuropathy events (20.0% and 12.1%, in
revusiran and placebo arms, respectively) and serious peripheral neuropathy events (5.0% and 0%) were reported more
frequently in the revusiran group than the placebo group
(Table 3). Most patients in both groups had events that were
mild or moderate in severity. Three (2.1%) patients in the
revusiran group and 1 (1.5%) patient in the placebo group
had peripheral neuropathy events that were considered severe.
Events of myopathy were reported in 2.9% and 7.6% in the
revusiran and placebo arms, respectively, and lactic acidosis
events were reported in 10.7% and 6.1% in the revusiran and
placebo arms, respectively. All events were mild or moderate
in severity. Blood lactate levels were only measured during the
follow-up period and showed elevations in both arms, with
most elevations being < 2 × ULN (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Throughout the study and safety follow-up period, measurements of anion gap were similar between the revusiran and
placebo groups (data not shown).

Pharmacokinetics
Mean plasma revusiran Cmax increased slightly from
baseline to Month 6 and appeared to have achieved
steady state by Month 6 with no further increase at
Month 12 (Supplementary Table 2). Mean Cmax values
appeared to be similar in patients who died and those
who were alive during treatment considering the large
overlap of the standard deviations at both baseline and
at Month 6 (p > 0.13).
There were no apparent differences in revusiran Cmax
between patients with mild (eGFR: 30 and < 60 ml/min/
1.73 m2
) or moderate (eGFR: 60 to < 90 ml/min/
1.73 m2
) renal impairment when compared with patients
with normal (eGFR: ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2
) renal function at Weeks 0, 26, and 52 (p > 0.20) (Supplementary
Fig. 6). It is important to note the high degree of
interpatient variability, the small numbers of patients
with normal renal function at all time points, and the
small number of patients with Cmax and eGFR data at Month 12.
Pharmacodynamics
Revusiran resulted in a mean > 80% reduction of serum
TTR which was apparent from Month 1 and maintained
through Month 15 (Supplementary Fig. 7). The mean
maximum ± standard error of the mean (SEM) serum
TTR reduction was 89.5 ± 0.589% relative to baseline.
Values of mean maximum TTR knockdown (92.0% and
89.1%) were similar in patients who died and those who
were alive. Following discontinuation of dosing, mean
serum TTR levels returned to near baseline within
90 days.
Efficacy
Given the limited duration of exposure due to early termination of the study only descriptive analyses of key efficacy
parameters are presented.
In both treatment arms, patients declined in 6MWT at
6 months compared with baseline. The mean change from

11.8; n = 41).
Change over time from baseline to Month 6 in key echocardiogram parameters and cardiac biomarker data were similar between treatment arms and showed no clinically meaningful improvement in the revusiran arm compared with placebo (Supplementary Table 3).
Analyses of the secondary endpoints of death and hospitalizations are described above in safety results. Planned statistical tests could not be performed for 99m-technetium scintigraphy and CMR imaging due to limited data.
Discussion
The Phase 3 ENDEAVOUR study was designed to investigate
the effect of revusiran, a first-generation GalNAc–siRNA conjugate targeting TTR, in patients with hATTR amyloidosis
with cardiomyopathy, a debilitating condition with an average
life expectancy of a median 3.4 years from diagnosis. The
study population comprised predominantly older patients with
advanced clinical HF. Dosing in the trial was stopped after a
median follow-up of 6.71 months in patients treated with
revusiran due to an imbalance in mortality observed between
the treatment arms. The deaths on-study were predominantly
CV due to HF, consistent with the natural history of the disease, and most were considered unrelated to study treatment
by the investigator at the time of the event prior to discontinuation of dosing in the trial. An extensive analysis of safety
was performed in an effort to understand the cause of the
mortality imbalance.
Comparing the placebo-controlled data, baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the 2 treatment arms
were balanced, except for a greater proportion of patients over
the age of 75 years in the revusiran arm compared with placebo. However, differences in the age distribution do not appear to fully explain the observed difference in the mortality
rate. Surprisingly, the imbalance in deaths, primarily CV due
to HF, was not paralleled by the expected increase in CV
hospitalizations, and key echocardiographic parameters and
cardiac biomarkers progressed at a similar rate over time in
the 2 treatment arms. With respect to AEs, compared with
placebo, patients on revusiran reported an increased incidence

of peripheral neuropathy, hepatic events that were primarily
laboratory elevations, and renal events (Table 3).
We also analyzed patient characteristics by outcome and
found that in the revusiran arm deaths occurred in an at-risk
group of patients with baseline clinical, echocardiographic,
and biomarker evidence of disease that was more advanced
than that of the patients on-treatment who were alive.
However, there were similar at-risk patients in the placebo
arm. Finally, patients who died had similar revusiran pharmacokinetic exposures and pharmacodynamic responses as those
who did not.
A clear causative mechanism could not therefore be
identified for the mortality imbalance. Short- and longterm rat and non-human primate chronic toxicology
studies (of up to 2 years’ duration) did not reveal any
corresponding toxicities to those observed in the
ENDEAVOUR study [25] (data on file). However, the
combination of an increase in deaths in the revusiran
arm and other notable imbalances in AEs (peripheral
neuropathy, hepatic, and renal events) suggests that
drug-mediated toxicity may have been a factor in the
outcome.
In light of the negative ENDEAVOUR outcome, and notwithstanding the similarities in revusiran-mediated TTR reductions between those who died on drug versus those who
did not, an important question arises regarding the safety of
TTR-lowering approaches in hATTR amyloidosis. However,
the safety and efficacy of TTR lowering as a therapeutic strategy have been validated by another therapy that reduces TTR
levels using double-stranded RNAi (patisiran) [9], which has
recently been approved for the treatment of patients with
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The pivotal Phase
3 trial of patisiran (APOLLO) included a prespecified subpopulation of patients with evidence of cardiac involvement,
which comprised a majority (56%) of the overall study population [26]. In the APOLLO study, TTR reduction was associated with an acceptable safety profile in both the overall
study population [9] and the prespecified cardiac subpopulation [26]. Importantly, the exposure-adjusted mortality rate
was lower for patisiran versus placebo, and in post hoc analysis of safety data a reduction in event rates in the patisiran
arm compared with placebo was observed for both any hospitalization and/or all-cause death as well as cardiac hospitalizations and/or all-cause death [26]. Collectively, these data
suggest the potential benefit of an siRNA targeting TTR for
treating cardiac manifestations of this disease; additional studies are, however, needed.
Accordingly, another GalNAc–siRNA conjugate targeting
TTR, vutrisiran (ALN-TTRsc02), will be used to further explore the benefit–risk profile of RNAi therapeutics across the
full spectrum of ATTR amyloidosis, including patients with
hereditary and wt cardiomyopathy. Compared with revusiran,
which is a first-generation (standard template chemistry)
GalNAc–siRNA conjugate, and thus prone to rapid in vivo
nuclease-mediated degradation, vutrisiran is a secondgeneration compound (enhanced stabilization chemistry
[ESC]), with far greater metabolic stability leading to significantly augmented potency and durability [27]. As such, the
exposure to revusiran, given at 500-mg weekly doses in the
ENDEAVOUR study, was 28 g of siRNA in the first year,
whereas vutrisiran achieves the same degree of TTR reduction
at 25 mg every 3 months (100 mg annually), equating to a
280-fold lowered drug exposure. For ESC GalNAc–siRNA
conjugates, lowered exposures are expected to lead to more
favorable safety results [25]. Consistent with this, several ESC
GalNAc–siRNA compounds are in, or have recently completed, Phase 3 studies without similar findings to those seen with
revusiran. Importantly, this group of ESC GalNAc–siRNA
conjugates sharing significant structural and chemical similarities includes inclisiran, administered at 300 mg every
6 months. Inclisiran has shown encouraging safety and
efficacy data in early development [28, 29] and is currently approaching the end of Phase 3 studies with the
program fully enrolled. The population evaluated in the
inclisiran studies is composed of patients with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic CV disease
(ASCVD) or ASCVD risk who would be expected to
be prone to cardiac events. To date, with over 3000
patients enrolled, with 2750 patient-years of exposure
to inclisiran, safety is encouraging [30], which in turn
suggests favorable cardiac tolerability for ESC GalNAc–
siRNA conjugates.
Conclusions
Following a thorough investigation, a clear causative mechanism for the mortality imbalance observed between treatment
arms on the Phase 3 ENDEAVOUR study could not be identified. However, it is possible that revusiran may have contributed to the finding and further development of this compound
has been discontinued. Data from the Phase 3 APOLLO study
of patisiran support the therapeutic hypothesis of TTR reduction as a potential approach for treatment of cardiomyopathy
in hATTR amyloidosis. Further studies are planned to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of both patisiran and ESC
siRNA–GalNAc conjugates with enhanced metabolic stability
in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.
