Abstract
Background: HCC is diagnosed in approximately half a million people per year, worldwide. Staging is a more complex issue
than in most other cancer entities and, mainly due to unique geographic characteristics of the disease, no universally
accepted staging system exists to date. Focusing on survival rates we analyzed demographic, etiological, clinical, laboratory
and tumor characteristics of HCC-patients in our institution and applied the common staging systems. Furthermore we
aimed at identifying the most suitable of the current staging systems for predicting survival.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Overall, 405 patients with HCC were identified from an electronic medical record
database. The following seven staging systems were applied and ranked according to their ability to predict survival by
using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the concordance-index (c-index): BCLC, CLIP, GETCH, JIS, Okuda, TNM and
Child-Pugh. Separately, every single variable of each staging system was tested for prognostic meaning in uni- and
multivariate analysis. Alcoholic cirrhosis (44.4%) was the leading etiological factor followed by viral hepatitis C (18.8%).
Median survival was 18.1 months (95%-CI: 15.2–22.2). Ascites, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, number of tumor nodes
and the BCLC tumor extension remained independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Overall, all of the tested
staging systems showed a reasonable discriminatory ability. CLIP (closely followed by JIS) was the top-ranked score in terms
of prognostic capability with the best values of the AIC and c-index (AIC 2286, c-index 0.71), surpassing other established
staging systems like BCLC (AIC 2343, c-index 0.66). The unidimensional scores TNM (AIC 2342, c-index 0.64) and Child-Pugh
(AIC 2369, c-index 0.63) performed in an inferior fashion.
Conclusions/Significance: Compared with six other staging systems, the CLIP-score was identified as the most suitable
staging system for predicting prognosis in a large German cohort of predominantly non-surgical HCC-patients.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
cancer worldwide [1], with the highest incidence in Asian and
developing countries [2]. Still, especially when considering its
rising incidence in the western world due to viral hepatitis and
alcohol-induced cirrhosis [3], HCC is an important health issue in
these geographic regions, as well. It is an aggressive tumor making
it the third most common cause of cancer related death worldwide
[4]. In approximately 80–90% of all HCC-cases, liver cirrhosis
forms the underlying precancerosis that favors tumor development. Tumor-staging, prognosis-estimation and choosing of
treatment options for HCC patients is a more complex issue than
in most other cancer-entities. This is due to the fact that the extent
of liver dysfunction has a major impact on survival, sometimes
more than the tumor itself. This is why the Child-Pugh score,
although not being an HCC staging system in its actual sense, has
been used to stratify HCC patients as well. Nevertheless,
traditional uni-dimensional classifications like the TNM-system
[5] or the Child-Pugh-score [6], exclusively taking into account
tumor stage or liver dysfunction, respectively, do not account for
the complexity of HCC in cirrhosis. As a consequence, multidimensional staging systems which include both the extension of
tumor and liver function parameters (sometimes plus general
health variables) have been developed: Okuda [7], Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) [8], Cancer of the Liver Italian
Program (CLIP) [9], Groupe d’Etude et de Traitement du
Carcinome He´patocellulaire (GETCH) [10] and Japan Integrated
Staging (JIS) [11] [For details, see supporting information
tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8]. It has been claimed, that
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e45066

linking staging with treatment decisions is mandatory [12]. The
only staging system currently providing this linkage is BCLC.
Therefore, BCLC has been endorsed as the recommended staging
system by American and European medical societies [13,14].
Despite this, BCLC has been criticized for being too algorithmic.
In various studies it has performed in an inferior fashion especially
when applied to non-surgical patients [15] and in some studies
even when applied to surgical patients [16].
After all, it remains unclear which of the established staging
systems should be preferred for a patient diagnosed with HCC. A
precise answer to this question would facilitate not only clinical
management of the individual patient but risk stratification in
clinical studies, as well. This is a critical issue since a rising number
of clinical studies can be noted due to the advent of effective
systemic treatment options [17]. It has been suggested, that the
consistent use of validated staging systems could help improving
the overall grim prognosis of HCC [18]. Nevertheless, efforts to
construct a universally applicable staging system are doomed to
fail because this approach would neglect the unique geographic
characteristics of HCC, including epidemiological and etiological
parameters. Therefore, a more region-oriented approach seems
necessary, with validation of the established staging systems within
the context of the specific geographic disease background.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to compare the ability of seven
established staging systems to predict survival for patients in a
large western HCC population. The validation of the staging
systems was preceded by a precise retrospective characterization of
the study population in order to ensure proper interpretation of
the validation data. Additionally, this analysis was designed to
identify the most relevant single prognostic variables incorporated
in the staging systems.
Patients and Methods
Patients
In this retrospective study, we identified HCC- patients treated
at the Department of Medicine II of Munich’s University Hospital
between January 1998 and March 2009. The research study was
approved by the ethics committee of the University of Munich and
the need for written informed consent was waived, because the
data were analyzed retrospectively and anonymously. Histological
or radiological (AASLD radiologic criteria [19]) confirmation of
diagnosis was mandatory for inclusion. Baseline was defined as
time of primary diagnosis of HCC, and certain baseline
examinations including laboratory and imaging studies were
required for inclusion in the study. Patients were excluded when
showing too fragmentary documentation of the data (.4
parameters missing) or whenever the survival status was unknown.
In total, 550 consecutive patients with HCC were identified, of
these 145 had to be excluded because of lacking data, leaving a
study population of 405 patients.
Data Collection
Patients were identified from a data base collection in our
institution, by using the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) code 150.0 for primary liver cancer. Clinical, tumor related
and laboratory data needed to stage patients in all seven staging
systems were retrieved from our electronic medical records.
Additionally, a wide range of other parameters was compiled in
order to further characterize our HCC-collective. The following
data were collected: Age, sex, date of initial diagnosis, date of
initial therapy, survival status, date of death, end of observation,
liver cirrhosis, etiology, mode of therapy, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group status (ECOG), Karnofsky-index, histology,
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), portal vein thrombosis,
portal hypertension, tumor extension, tumor burden (./,50% of
liver), number of tumor nodes, macroscopic vascular invasion,
distant metastasis, lymph node involvement, BCLC tumor features
([1]: singular ,2 cm, [2]: 3 nodules #3 cm or 1 nodule 2- #5 cm,
[3]: multilocular, [4]: Portal invasion, N1, M1). Furthermore, the
following laboratory parameters were retrieved in order to be able
to calculate all tested staging systems: AFP, bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, Quick and albumin.
In those cases without histology, the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis
was made dependent on typical clinical signs of portal hypertension or on unequivocal radiological signs. Portal hypertension was
diagnosed, if an elevated hepatic vein pressure above 10 mm/Hg,
esophageal varices, splenomegaly or a platelet count below
100.000/ml were noted. Classification of ascites was performed
according to the Child-Pugh score. Ascites detected by imaging
but not visible on physical examination was termed mild, while the
ascites was classified as ‘‘massive’’, if clinically visible. Whenever
exact classification of HE was missing in medical records, clinical
signs of HE like tiredness, confusion and coma were used to
retrospectively classify the respective HE grades I–IV [20].
Whenever medical records did not include exact documentation
of Karnofsky performance (KPS) and Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG), these classifications

were retrospectively estimated on the basis of the available data on
the general health status of the patient. For patients with exact
documentation of either KPS or ECOG, the missing score was
deducted on the basis of the following estimation [21]: ECOG
0 = KPS 100%, ECOG 1 = KPS 80%–90%, ECOG 2 = KPS
60%–70%, ECOG 3 = KPS 40%–50% and ECOG 4 = KPS
10%–30%.
All treatment decisions were based on an interdisciplinary
tumor composed of hepatologists, (interventional-) radiologists,
oncologists and surgeons. Although the advent of staging systems
including treatment recommendations according to specific stages
like BCLC has had an impact on these boards, treatment
allocation to date remains an individual approach.
All baseline tumor parameters necessary to characterize the
HCC-cohort and to calculate the staging systems were obtained by

reviewing radiology and pathology reports, respectively. When in
doubt concerning certain tumor measurements a radiologist (C.Z.)
with 8 years experience in abdominal CT and MRI reevaluated
the baseline images. Regional lymph node involvement was
assumed when suspect lymph nodes (.1 cm in diameter) were
detected on MRI and CT, respectively. Information on survival
was retrieved from the clinical records, whenever possible. In all
other cases the primary care physician was contacted via telephone
or fax.
Staging Systems
Out of 405, 365 patients showed sufficient data to perform
stratification according to Child-Pugh-score, 395 patients according to TNM, 373 patients according to Okuda, 352 patients
according to CLIP, 341 patients according to BCLC, 358 patients
according to JIS, and 304 patients according to GETCH. 290
Patients could be classified by all staging systems. In order to keep
the numbers of patients with incomplete data as small as possible
this cohort was enlarged to 354 patients by substituting missing
values for laboratory parameters by the median (Bilirubin 1, Quick
2, AFP 11, Albumin 16, and AP 42 values). Ranking of scores was
done for both cohorts of 290 and 354 patients, respectively. There
were no substantial differences found, thus only values for the 354
patients are reported.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analysis SAS-Software [SAS V9.2, SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC] was used. p,0.05 indicated statistical significance,
with a p,0.0001 the parameter was considered to be of high
statistical significance.
Univariate analysis
For univariate analysis overall survival was estimated by using
the Kaplan-Meier method from the date of primary diagnosis of
HCC to the date of death or last follow-up. Survival curves were
compared using the log-rank test. Additionally to the p-value
medians of survival time and 95% confidence intervals for the
different strata are given. Both, single parameters and the whole
scores were analysed concerning their prognostic significance. For
Kaplan-Meier-analysis of continuous variables, one or more cutoff values are necessary; therefore, laboratory values were divided
into quartiles.
Multivariate analysis
While the univariate analysis was performed for all the patients
showing the individual parameter, multivariate analysis relates
only to the cohort of n = 354 patients who could be classified in all
staging systems as described above. This number reflects those
patients who could be classified in all staging systems. In order to
keep the numbers of patients with incomplete data as small as
possible, for calculating the scores and for multivariate analysis
missing values for laboratory parameters were substituted by the
median. In those parameters showing significance in univariate
analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression model was
conducted in order to examine their independent prognostic
relevance. To avoid arbitrary cut-off values in this model
laboratory values were taken as base two logarithms and used as
continuous variables.
Ranking
Ranking of staging systems was achieved by the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) [22] derived from the Cox model
and concordance- index (c-index) [23]. AIC is a measure of
relative goodness-of-fit and thus provides a means for comparing
models, a lower AIC value indicating a better model fit.
Calculating the c-index requires no model assumptions, it
represents the proportion of concordance in all possible pairs of
patients meaning that the patient with the better prognostic score
has the longer survival time. A score with a c-index of 0.5 is not
better than chance, a c-index of 1 indicates perfect prediction. Cindices together with 95% confidence intervals were calculated
using the SAS macro [24]. In cases with disconcordant values of
AIC and c-index, the AIC-value was favoured.
Results
Etiological factors
The etiological factors for HCC are reported in table 1. The
sole leading etiological factor was alcohol abuse in 180 (44.4%)
patients. Chronic viral hepatitis C or B were found in 100 patients
(24.7%), with HCV being more frequent than HBV (76 (18.8%)
and 24 (5.9%), respectively). In 14.8% of all cases no etiological
factor could be identified, therefore these cases were classified as
‘‘cryptogenic’’. 23 (5.7%) patients had other established, yet less
common HCC etiologies. In 52 patients (10.3%) a combination of
2 etiological factors had contributed to HCC-development. The
most frequent combination (21 patients (5.2%)) comprised the two
most common single factors alcohol and HCV. When taking into

account the cases of combined etiology, alcohol was noted in 212
(52.3%) and viral hepatitis in 138 (34.1%) cases.
Demographic and clinical data
Diagnosis of HCC was based on histology in 52.1% of patients.
The most relevant clinical and demographic data of the patient
population are depicted in table 2. With 335 patients the majority
of patients were male (82.3%). The median age of all patients was
63.4 years (range 27.8–84.8). With 64.1 years (range 27.8–84.8)
(female) vs. 63.3 years (28.0–84.6) (male), the age at time of
primary diagnosis showed no relevant difference between both
sexes. Liver cirrhosis as an underlying condition for HCC
development was present in 338 patients (83.7%). As a
consequence of liver cirrhosis 247 (63.7%) patients showed signs
of portal hypertension at time of HCC diagnosis. Ascites was not
present in the majority of patients (66.5%), the same was true for
hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (77.4% without HE). Liver function
was compensated (no cirrhosis or Child A cirrhosis) in more than
half of the patients (53.7%), only 43 patients (13.4%) had ChildPugh C end stage liver disease. Consistently, most of the patients
were in a good or fairly good general condition at time of HCCdiagnosis, with 334 (92.6%) presenting with an ECOG of 0–1.
Laboratory parameters
The results of the evaluation of baseline laboratory parameters
that are part of some of the tested staging systems are summarized
in table 3. While AFP (40.5 ng/ml), aP (142 U/l) and bilirubin
(1.3 mg/dl) showed elevated median values, Quick (75%) and
albumin (3.8 g/dl) were within normal range. All 5 parameters
provided prognostic information in univariate analysis (table 4).
Tumor related data
Tumor related data are summarized in table 5. 156 (38.5%) of
all patients had a single tumor node, however only 4.7% of all
patients had a single tumor smaller than 2 cm. On the other side,
only 12.6% of all cases showed a tumor burden that involved more
than 50% of the liver. One third of all patients (33.8%) had more
than 3 tumor nodes. In contrast, tumor features related to a more
advanced local involvement like distant metastasis, lymph-node

involvement and macroscopic vascular invasion were present in
the minority of cases (6.4%, 28.2% and 20.1%, respectively).
Therapy
Table 6 depicts the treatment modalities of the HCC patients,
focusing on the primary mode of therapy. In total, only 24% of all
patients received a potentially curative treatment option (resection,
OLT and local ablation) as primary mode of therapy. The
remaining 76% of patients received either palliative treatment
modalities (n = 261) or were offered best supportive care (n = 47).
TACE was by far the most frequent mode of primary therapy,
more than half of the patients received this radiological
intervention (215 patients; 53.1%). Local ablation was performed
in 53 patients (13.1%). This treatment group included 14 patients
receiving an unmated RFA, while 37 patients received a TACE
session closely prior to the RFA, 2 patients were treated with PEI.
In 47 cases (11.6%), no specific tumor therapy could be offered
due to advanced tumor stage and/or liver insufficiency, respectively. 42 patients (10.4%) received a surgical resection following
diagnosis of HCC, making this procedure the third most common
initial mode of tumor directed therapy. Details concerning the
distribution of patients according to the different staging systems in
each treatment option and the change of treatment options over
the past decade are shown in the supporting information
tables S9, S10. Additionally, the prognosis of HCC patients
according to the treatment modalities is shown in figure S1.
Survival analysis and prognostic factors
Median duration of follow-up was 14 months (range 0.2–113.1).
By the end of follow-up in September 2009, 273/405 (67.4%) of
the patients had died. Overall median survival was 18.1 months
(95% CI: 15.2–22.2). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates
were 63%, 29% and 17%, respectively (figure 1).
The following 16 parameters were associated with a significant
impact on overall survival in univariate analysis: Clinical parameters
(table 2): liver cirrhosis (p = 0.0417), ascites (p,0.0001), ECOG
(p,0.0001), portal hypertension (p = 0.031), portal vein thrombosis (p,0.0001). Laboratory parameters (table 4): AFP
(p,0.0001), bilirubin (p,0.0001), alkaline phosphatase
(p,0.0001), Quick (p = 0.0215), albumin (p,0.0001). Tumor
related parameters (table 5): BCLC-tumor extension (p,0.0001),
number of tumor nodes (p,0.0001), tumor burden (p,0.0001),
macroscopic vascular invasion (p,0.0001), lymph node involvement (p = 0.0436), distant metastasis (p,0.0001).
In multivariate analysis three laboratory parameters (AFP,
bilirubin and aP), one clinical (ascites) and two tumor-related
parameter (BCLC-tumor extension and number of tumor nodes),
respectively remained significant predictors of survival (table 7).
Staging systems
Patient stratification and estimated median survival time
according to the 7 staging systems are depicted in table 8. The
majority of all patients were stratified to intermediate stages of the
staging systems, the only exception being Okuda, which assigned
over 50% of patients in the early stage I. None of the staging
systems stratified the majority of patients into its respective

advanced stage. When looking at the individual staging system as a
whole, each showed a statistically significant association with
prognosis. Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 show the Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis stratified according to the 7 staging systems. The
discriminatory ability of the staging systems was analyzed as well.
All of the different strata in the Okuda, BCLC, GETCH, ChildPugh and TNM-score characterized distinct survival groups
(figures 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8). The same was true for the CLIPScore, except for its very early stage (CLIP 0 vs. CLIP 1:
p = 0.262). 1- and 3-year survival with CLIP-score 1 was 80% and
40%, a CLIP-score of 2 had 1- and 3-year survival rates of 61%
and 19% and a CLIP score of 3 was associated with a 1- and a 3-
year survival of 40% und 13%, respectively. With a CLIP-score
$4, 11% lived after 1 and only 5% after 3 years (figure 5).

Analysis of the JIS-score revealed a lack of discriminatory ability
between the early subcategories JIS 0 vs. JIS 1 (p = 0.233) and JIS
1 vs. JIS 2 (p = 0.391). Of note, patients without cirrhosis showed
no difference in survival when compared to Child-A cirrhotic
patients (p = 0.459).
Comparison of the established staging systems
Further statistical analysis was performed in order to identify the
staging system with the best predictive ability for survival. As
shown in tables 9 and 10, ranking of the established staging
systems based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and cindex resulted in identification of CLIP (AIC 2286, c-index 0.71)
as the superior score for the examined HCC-cohort. Although

confidence intervals of the c-index of CLIP and the other staging
systems except for GETCH and Child-Pugh overlapped, there was
a clear tendency towards a confirmation of the AIC results. JIS
performed almost as well as CLIP, showing an AIC and c-index of
2293 and 0.70, respectively. The least suitable score was the unidimensional Child-Pugh-score (AIC 2369, c-index 0.63).

Discussion
Characterization of study cohort
The performance of HCC staging systems always needs to be
interpreted within the specific context of the examined study
population. Therefore, an extensive characterization of the HCCcollective, going beyond the parameters needed for the staging
systems, preceded the validation process in our study. The
majority of patients were male (82.3%), and the median age of
all patients was 63.4 years (range 27.8–84.8). These findings, as
well as the fact that HCC predominantly arose in a cirrhotic liver
(83.7%) are in line with most European HCC studies. In these
studies, alcohol and HCV respectively have repeatedly been
identified as the two leading etiologic factors for HCC in Europe
[25,26]. In our cohort of German HCC patients chronic alcohol
abuse was the most frequent single risk factor (44%) followed by
HCV (18.8%) supporting the data from a large study on
epidemiology of HCC in southern Germany [27]. Over 40% of
all HCC patients worldwide are Chinese [28]. Chinese HCC
patients predominantly have an underlying HBV-infection and
tend to be significantly younger than western patients due to
transmission of the virus in younger years and its higher capability
to promote tumor development in non-cirrhotic livers [29,30].
Considering these major differences in epidemiology, it becomes
clear why results of a staging system validation study in one
geographic region cannot be automatically transferred to another.
This comprehension is becoming increasingly acknowledged by
investigators.
Many recent validation studies applied the staging systems to
more selected groups of patients [15,16], while our study included
the whole range of tumor stages and their corresponding treatment
options, from potentially curative treatment modalities (24%) to
best supportive care (11.6%). The majority of patients were in a
good or fairly good condition (92.6% ECOG 0–1) at time of
diagnosis, which, despite the overall dismal prognosis, is a frequent
finding in HCC [15]. TACE is considered the most widely-used
palliative treatment option [31] and indeed was the primary mode
of therapy in 53.1% of our patients, reflecting the common finding
that most HCCs are detected in rather advanced stages [9]. In
contrast to many other solid tumors, this is not so much related to
distant metastasis (here only 6.4%) but more to locally advanced
tumors as well as to the consequences of cirrhosis. The complex
interplay of the tumor and the frequently underlying liver disease
ultimately limits the range of applicable treatment options. In the
literature about 30% of western HCC patients are reported to
have potentially curable disease at time of diagnosis [32]. The
slightly lower proportion in our cohort (24%) can be explained by
the tertiary referral status of our center.
Survival and prognostic factors
Overall median survival was 18.1 months and 5-year overall
survival rate was 17%. Our survival data are comparable to
another recent study from southern Germany, which showed an
overall median survival of 19 months in a group that included
more resectable HCC patients [27]. Reported survival rates for
HCC vary significantly dependent on the examined study
population. The broad range from 8 months in a largely nonsurgical [26] and up to 64 months in a resectable group of patients
[16] can in part be explained by the different degree of selection.
Another reason for different survival data might be the bias of
comparing different time periods. There is data suggesting that
survival of HCC patients has improved over the past 3–4 decades,
with five-year survival rates in the United States of approximately
4% in 1973 and 11.8% in 2001 [18]. This improvement might be
attributed to better treatment options and surveillance programs,
resulting in earlier detection of HCC [18].
Identification of prognostic factors within a given study
population is the basis on which all staging systems have been
developed. In the present study, a broad range of clinical,
laboratory and tumor parameters showed statistical significance in
univariate analysis. However, in multivariate analysis only aP,
bilirubin, ascites, AFP, number of tumor nodes and BCLC-tumor
extension remained strong predictors of survival. AFP, which is

included only in 2 of the 7 examined staging systems (CLIP and
GETCH), has repeatedly been identified as an independent
prognostic factor in different settings [9,33–34]. The current data
emphasize the importance of AFP for prognostification in general
and its exceptional role in screening, early detection and
monitoring treatment is emphasized in a number of guidelines
[35]. Except for TNM, bilirubin is included in all of the tested
staging systems, underlining its outstanding prognostic relevance.
In a large review of the literature, including a total of 23.968
patients from 72 studies bilirubin has been found to be under the
six most important prognostic parameters [36]. Alkaline phosphatase (aP) is a less common prognostic marker of HCC. Of the
currently tested staging systems, GETCH is the only one
containing this parameter, nevertheless aP was identified as an
independent prognostic factor, confirming the observations of
Huitzil-Melendez et al. [15], which have been made in the context
of an advanced HCC-collective. Ascites is included in the ChildPugh, Okuda, BCLC, CLIP and JIS-scores. Therefore its
significance in our multivariate analysis came as no surprise and
is supported by many other studies showing its prognostic
importance [37]. The tumor parameters included in the BCLCscore (‘‘BCLC tumor features’’) and the number of tumor nodes
remained significant in multivariate analysis. Tumor parameters
included in other staging systems, for example differentiating
between tumor extension to more or less than 50% (part of the
Okuda-score), are obviously not differentiated enough to bear an

independent prognostic information. Altogether, the identification
of three liver- as well as three tumor-related parameters as
prognostic factors once again strengthens the need for a twodimensional staging system including both categories. Some
studies [16,36] noted an independent prognostic meaning of the
‘‘general health status’’. However, the consideration of this
parameter in an ideal staging system as a ‘‘third dimension’’ as
in BCLC (ECOG) and GETCH (Karnofsky) is not supported by
our data.
Validation and ranking of staging systems
A clear recommendation which staging system to choose for
HCC patients, is of great importance for clinical decisions as well
as planning of interventional studies [18]. There have been a
number of studies to date focusing on the evaluation of staging
systems [15,16]. Although initially developed in different and
inhomogeneous patient cohorts, some of the studies demonstrated
a surprisingly good performance of the staging systems even in
selected groups of HCC patients [16]. In our study, all of the tested
staging systems and even the one-dimensional Child-Pugh and
TNM showed a prognostic meaning (p,0.0001) when applied to
the 405 HCC patients. On the one side, this is a sign of the
excellent quality of the selected staging systems in general; on the
other side this frequent observation underscores the basic problem
with staging of HCC: With none of the scores totally failing and
none standing out at first sight, more sophisticated measures are
needed to identify the most suitable score. First of all, stratification
of patients into the respective subcategories yielded further
information in terms of discriminatory ability. All of the
subcategories had distinct survival except for the early stages of
CLIP (0 vs. 1) and JIS (0 vs. 1 and 1 vs. 2), an observation most
likely a result of the underrepresentation of surgical patients in our
cohort and not of a failure of these scores themselves, especially
when considering the fact that CLIP (7 strata) and JIS (6 strata)
represent the two most refined scores in terms of number of
defined subgroups. In a study applying CLIP to surgical patients,
the early stages in fact defined distinct survival groups [16]. An
answer to the question which staging system should be preferred in
a given HCC cohort cannot be obtained by simply comparing the
performance of their respective strata. Established statistical
methods to measure and compare the prognostic capability of a
staging system are the AIC and c-index, respectively [22,23]. AIC
[38] and c-index [15] have been used in comparative HCCstaging system evaluation studies before, but to our knowledge, this
is the first validation study to use both tools. The AIC as well as the
c-index, provide information of the predictive accuracy of a
staging system that exceed the information which can be derived
by simply looking at the number of distinct strata of a staging
system. The interpretation of c-index for instance is the probability
that for a randomly chosen pair of patients the one with the higher
prediction time is the one who survives longer. Thus the maximum
achievable value for c is 1 regardless of the number of classes. The
AIC is considered the most relevant reference for the comparison
of different staging systems [38], which is why the current study
considered it as the benchmark-test. When applied to our study
cohort, both AIC and c-index consistently ranked CLIP as the
superior score. However, the c-index of the CLIP score did show a
non-overlapping confidence interval only with the inferior ChildPugh and GETCH-sore. Nevertheless, there was a clear tendency
to consistency with the AIC-results. This confirms the result of
several validation studies from different geographic regions that
ranked CLIP at number one [39]. Especially in patients
undergoing nonsurgical therapy, CLIP seems to be the best
staging system [15,40]. CLIP was developed in a non-selected
patient population, but had an emphasis on non-surgical patients
[9], therefore it is known to have weaknesses in discriminating very
early stages. Nevertheless, in some studies focusing on surgical
patients it has also shown superior performance compared to other
staging systems including BCLC [38]. Three out of six of the
presently identified prognostic factors are included in the CLIP
score (AFP, ascites and bilirubin), which might be an explanation
for its superiority. On the other hand, BCLC also has three of the
six parameters included (bilirubin, ascites and BCLC-tumor
features) but demonstrated poorer values with regard to AIC
and c-index. Although recommended by EASL and AASLD
[13,14] and obviously with good prognostic capability concerning
the early stages [34], this is not the first time the BCLC staging
system has performed in an inferior fashion in non-selected and
especially in intermediate to advanced HCC patients [15]. The
main advantage of BCLC over CLIP is its treatment algorithm, a
tool that might simply be added to a revised CLIP as well to
improve its practicability. With regard to AIC and c-index, JIS was
consistently ranked at number 2 with only negligible differences
when compared to CLIP. The good performance of this score,
initially developed in Japan, is supported by previous studies
[16,41]; to our knowledge this is the first time it is being evaluated
in a European HCC patient population. The least successful (with
the highest AIC and lowest c-index) was the uni-dimensional
Child-Pugh-score, which is lacking any tumor related parameter.
Limitations
There are some potential limitations of this study. First, the
retrospective fashion of the data collection resulted in a lack of

data in some cases. Especially parameters like ECOG and HE are
subject to interpretation and are more easily obtained in a
prospective study. We tried to control this problem by applying
standardized methods of obtaining these data. Furthermore, the
good quality of our clinical database helped to retrieve all the
necessary data, even retrospectively. Because of the clinical
significance of the parameters needed for calculation of the scores,
these values were available for most of the patients at time of
diagnosis despite the retrospective character of this study. Second,
relatively few patients were in the very early and early stages,
limiting the value of our data for surgical cohorts and probably
underestimating the prognostic capability of the TNM system,
which is traditionally strong in surgical HCC patients. Finally, due
to major differences in epidemiology as well as clinical and tumor
parameters, applicability of our results obtained in a western HCC
cohort to other geographic regions (i.e. Asia) is limited.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results indicate that in non-selected western
HCC patients the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program-score
(CLIP) (closely followed by JIS) is the best performing staging
system among the seven currently used prognostic models.
