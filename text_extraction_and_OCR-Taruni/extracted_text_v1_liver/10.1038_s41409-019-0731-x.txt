Abstract
Graft-versus-host disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. First-line treatment is based on the use of high doses of corticosteroids. Unfortunately, second-line treatment
for both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, remains a challenge. Ruxolitinib has been shown as an effective and
safe treatment option for these patients. Seventy-nine patients received ruxolitinib and were evaluated in this retrospective
and multicenter study. Twenty-three patients received ruxolitinib for refractory acute graft-versus-host disease after a median
of 3 (range 1–5) previous lines of therapy. Overall response rate was 69.5% (16/23) which was obtained after a median of
2 weeks of treatment, and 21.7% (5/23) reached complete remission. Fifty-six patients were evaluated for refractory chronic
graft-versus-host disease. The median number of previous lines of therapy was 3 (range 1–10). Overall response rate was
57.1% (32/56) with 3.5% (2/56) obtaining complete remission after a median of 4 weeks. Tapering of corticosteroids was
possible in both acute (17/23, 73%) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (32/56, 57.1%) groups. Overall survival was 47%
(CI: 23–67%) at 6 months for patients with aGVHD (62 vs 28% in responders vs non-responders) and 81% (CI: 63–89%) at
1 year for patients with cGVHD (83 vs 76% in responders vs non-responders). Ruxolitinib in the real life setting is an
effective and safe treatment option for GVHD, with an ORR of 69.5% and 57.1% for refractory acute and chronic graftversus-host disease, respectively, in heavily pretreated patients.
Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the main cause of
morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT). Despite the use of standard
prophylaxis 35–50% and 35–70% of HSCT recipients will
develop acute (aGVHD) [1] and chronic GVHD (cGVHD)
[2], respectively.
First-line systemic treatment consists of high doses of
corticosteroids. Unfortunately, more than 50% of the
patients will not respond adequately, thus requiring secondline treatment [3]. This subgroup of patients has an especially poor prognosis, with a significantly higher risk of

treatment-related mortality [4]. Until recently, there were no
approved therapies for GVHD treatment [5].
Ruxolitinib is an orally administered selective Janus
Kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of
myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera [6–9]. JAK inhibitors
relieve symptoms related to an excess of proinflammatory
cytokines in these patients [10, 11]. Due to the key role of
JAK-STAT pathways on T cells activation, JAK inhibitors
may reduce GVHD by inhibiting donor T-cell expansion
and inflammatory cytokine production, regulatory T-cell
(Treg) function and viability. Based on this background,
Spoerl et al. [12] and Zeiser et al. [13] have reported the
effectiveness of ruxolitinib to control GVHD in both mice
and humans.
Several approaches have been evaluated as recue
therapy within the second-line treatment. The difficulty in
grading the severity (consequence of the high heterogeneity of the manifestations) and the treatment responses, as well as the sequential or concomitant treatment
with several immunosuppressive drugs, makes it difficult
to evaluate the effectiveness of any approach. In this
context, the German group [13] has published data from a
retrospective study in which 95 patients with moderatesevere GVHD refractory to steroids were treated with
ruxolitinib. The overall response rates (ORR) were 44/54
(81%) and 35/41 (85%) for aGVHD and cGVHD
respectively, with rates of up to 46% of complete
responses (CR) in aGVHD. To assess long-term follow-up
results, they collected data in a second analysis [14] from
the same patients. Ongoing ORR was 22/54 (41%) and 10/
41 (24%) after a median follow-up of 19 and 24 months
for aGVHD and cGVHD groups. The 1-year overall survival (OS) was 62.4% (CI: 49.4–75.4%) and 92.7% (CI:
84.7–100%), respectively. Other authors, such as Khoury
et al. [15], reported the outcomes of 19 patients with
cGVHD who received salvage therapy with ruxolitinib.
They described early partial responses (PR) in 18 out of
19 patients as well as a sustained steroid-sparing effect in
17 out of 19 patients.
On May 24, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration
approved ruxolitinib (JAKAFI, Incyte Corporation) for
steroid-refractory aGVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12
years and older [5]. Approval was based on Study INCB
18424-271 (NCT02953678), an open-label, single-arm,
multicenter study of ruxolitinib that enrolled 49 patients
with steroid-refractory aGVHD grades 2–4 (Mount Sinai
Acute GVHD International Consortium criteria). Ruxolitinib was administered at 5 mg twice daily, and the dose
could be increased to 10 mg twice daily. The trial’s primary
endpoints were day-28 ORR. The median response duration
was 16 days (95% CI: 9, 83), and the median time from
day-28 response to either death or need for new therapy for
aGVHD was 173 days (95% CI 66, NE).
In addition, Novartis Inc is running two large phase III
trials of ruxolitinib vs best standard of care in steroidrefractory aGVHD and cGVHD. They are open-label studies in period of recruiting. However clinical data and
outcomes are not available yet.
With this background, we analyzed the use of ruxolitinib
in the treatment of GVHD within the Spanish Group of
Hematopoietic Transplant and Cell Therapy (GETH) centers. Our data add evidence to the information available so
far, on this new therapeutic strategy.
Methods
Study population
Between October 2015 to July 2017, 79 patients who
underwent an HSCT and developed GVHD resistant to
steroids received ruxolitinib. They were evaluated in this
retrospective, observational, and multicenter study using
data collected from 13 Spanish centers, including seven
pediatric patients (<14 years). Off-label treatment with
ruxolitinib and data analysis were approved by the Clinical
Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario
Ramón y Cajal, Spain.
The median age was 51 years (range, 0–73). The most
frequent underlying diseases were: acute myeloid leukemia
(38%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16.5%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (15.2%). The majority of patients
received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (57%).
Patient baseline characteristics of the entire population are
shown in Table 1. Of note, 53% and 55% of patients with
aGVHD or cGVHD, respectively, have received three or
more lines or prior therapy.
The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki and received approval by
an independent Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent for collection data was obtained and
signed from each patient after being treated with ruxolitinib.
Confidentiality of data collection was preserved following
local regulations (Organic Law 15/1999 of December 13,
Protection of Personal Data [LOPD]). Likewise, Law 14/
2007 on Biomedical Research was respected.
Inclusion criteria and treatment plan
Patients undergoing HSCT in GETH centers with steroidrefractory GVHD treated with ruxolitinib were included in
the analysis. Refractoriness of aGVHD was defined as
“progression within 3–5 days of starting treatment or an
incomplete response by 7–14 days. Refractory cGVHD was
defined as “cGVHD of sustained severity during the last full
month during which the patients had received the equivalent
642 V. Escamilla Gómez et al.

of prednisone 0.5 mg/kg or more per day or 1 mg/kg or
more every other day”.
The severity of the disease was evaluated according to
the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry criteria
for aGVHD [16] and according to the international consensus of National Institutes of Health (NIH) for cGVHD
[17]. Patients were scored for their best response at any time
after starting ruxolitinib. Treatment responses were considered when patients achieved CR or PR. Other types of
responses were considered treatment failure.
Regarding aGVHD, CR was defined as the absence of
symptoms related to the GVHD. The PR as improvement of
at least one category of the severity of aGVHD in one organ
without deterioration in any other. Treatment failure was
defined as the lack of improvement of GVHD, deterioration
in any organ, appearance of new symptomatology associated with GVHD or the need to start a new treatment for
the control of the disease.
Regarding cGVHD, response assessment was performed
following NIH criteria [18]. CR was defined as resolution of
all manifestations related to cGVHD in a specific organ; PR
as improvement in score from baseline reflecting genuine
clinical benefit; and treatment failure as criteria for

progression defined in NIH consensus. Discontinuation of
ruxolitinib due to toxicity was not considered treatment
failure. Histologic GVHD grading was performed on the
basis of histopathology according to a published staging
system for histology and clinical grading according to criteria for aGVHD or cGVHD [19].
Study design
This is a retrospective, observational and multicenter study.
Safety and efficacy data were analyzed in patients who have
already been treated with ruxolitinib in the clinical practice
under a compassionate use. The study did not imply a
change in the therapeutic action or additional tests. The
information source was patient´s clinical history in all cases.
The study was performed within the hospital setting, with
the participation of Departments of Hematology belonging
to the Spanish Group of Hematopoietic Transplant and Cell
Therapy (GETH) distributed throughout the national
territory. Data were collected in a specific Electronic Case
Report Form especially designed for the study.
Statistics
Results were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS PASW18). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. OS was calculated in our
study at one year with Stata/IC 15.0 program. Given that the
objective of the study was merely descriptive, and therefore,
there was not hypothesis to be confirmed, the sample estimation prior to the study was not necessary.
Results
Ruxolitinib in aGVHD
Twenty-three patients received ruxolitinib for refractory
aGVHD. All patients had grades 2–4 aGVHD and 20
patients (87%) had grades 3–4; the median number of
previous lines of therapy was 3 (range 1–5). ORR was
69.5% (16/23) which was obtained after a median of
2 weeks of treatment (range: 0.5–4 weeks), and 21.7% (5/
23) reached CR. Median follow-up was 78 days (range:
4–913). The median dose of ruxolitinib was 20 mg/day
divided in two doses. Remarkably, we found no differences
in treatment responses depending on the organs involved
(Table 2). More specifically, 66.7% of patients with gastrointestinal GVHD did respond, 19% obtaining CR. The
use of ruxolitinib allowed to taper steroids doses in 17/23 of
patients (73.7%). Globally, overall survival at 6 months was
47% (CI: 23–67%) (Fig. 1a). Overall survival (OS) at
6 months in responders vs non-responders was 62% vs
28%, respectively (Fig. 1b).
Ruxolitinib in cGVHD
Fifty-six patients were evaluated for refractory cGVHD. All
patients had moderate (28/57, 50%) to severe (28/57, 50%)
cGVHD. The median number of previous lines of therapy
was 3 (range 1–10). ORR was 57.1% (32/56) with 3.5%
(2/56) obtaining CR which was obtained at a median of
4 weeks of treatment (range: 1–24 weeks). Median followup was 181 days (range: 15–560). The median dose administrated was 20 mg daily divided in two doses. Again, no
differences were found upon analyzing response rate by
organs involved. Remarkably, ORR in patients with
sclerotic changes was 56%, for those with lung involvement
61.5% and for those with gut involvement 56.3%.
Responses for lung involvement were evaluated according
to NIH scoring/staging/response assessment as part of
standard clinical practice. Thirty-two patients (59.2%) could

63–89) (Fig. 2a). OS at 1 year in responders vs nonresponders was 83% vs 76%, respectively (Fig. 2b).
Toxicities, relapse, and mortality
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was observed both in
aGVHD and chronic subgroups of patients while on treatment with ruxolitinib. Regarding aGVHD, CMV reactivation occurred in 12/23 (52.2%) patients, while in the
cGVHD subgroup, it was observed in 11/56 (19.6%)
patients. Nevertheless, when we analyzed CMV reactivation
before ruxolitinib treatment was started, the incidence was
similar or even higher: among patients with aGVHD: 12/23
(52.2%); and among patients with cGHVD: 15/56 (26%),
indicating that ruxolitinib may not exert a significant
increase in the risk of CMV reactivation. Monitoring by
plasma CMV PCR was performed in all recipients and
CMV reactivations were treated according to clinical practice. Since these data were retrospectively collected in different centers, there was not a uniform algorithm. Globally,
it was defined as 2 confirmed PCR CMV tested above 600
copies. Those patients with confirmed reactivation received
valgancyclovir (foscarnet in case of severy neutropenia)
according to current recommendations.
Overall, 26 patients (32.9%) interrupted ruxolitinib due
to: lack of response (14), cytopenias (three patients had
thrombocytopenia, three anemia, three had both); infections
(1); and other causes (2).
Regarding drug-related toxicities, only three patients
discontinued ruxolitinib (Table 3). Causes for discontinuation in these patients were fungal infection, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic impairment. For 16 patients, it was
sufficient with temporary suspension or dose reduction.
Relapse of the underlying malignancy was only observed
in one non ruxolitinib-responsive patient.
Globally, 18 patients (22.8%) died: 10/23 patients
(43.5%) within the aGVHD and 8/56 patients (14.3%)
within the cGVHD subgroup. Causes of death were:
infections (10), refractory GVHD (6) and other causes (2).
We also analyzed bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and LHD levels before ruxolitinib was started. However, we did not find any biomarkers that could predict
treatment responses. Median bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,

Discussion
The development of novel approaches for the treatment of
relapsed or refractory GVHD is an unmet medical need. In
the current study, ORR among patients with aGVHD was
69.5% (16/23) with 21.7% (5/23) patients obtaining CR.
Among patients with refractory cGVHD, ORR was 57.1%
(32/56) with 3.5% (2/56) obtaining CR. It is worth mentioning that, in the current study, the response rate reached
56% for cGVHD with skin involvement and sclerotic features, which is promising considering the limited therapeutic options for these patients [20]. Similarly, lung
involvement is one of the most severe features of cGVHD.
We observed a response rate of 61% among these patients.
Other studies using extracorporeal photopheresis have
observed a response rate in the range of 33–63% [21]. In
addition, considering that ruxolitinib is administrated orally,
there might be some concerns regarding its absorption and
biodistribution. Noteworthy, ORR reached 67 and 56%
among patients with gastrointestinal aGVHD and cGVHD,
respectively. Considering the retrospective nature of the
study, we did not set a specific time point post ruxolitinib
for GVHD assessment, but we based our analysis on the
time of best response. The lack of a standardized time point
to assess ORR is a limitation and could be considered a flaw
in the methodology. Nevertheless, taking into account the
median time to best response for aGVHD by day 14 and
considering that late responses occurred up to day 27, our
data does well represent the ORR occurring by day +28,
which is currently considered the gold standard regarding
the timing for aGVHD evaluation.
The German group [13] has reported data from a retrospective study in which 95 patients with moderate-severe
GVHD refractory to steroids were treated with ruxolitinib.
The ORR were 81% (44/54) and 85% (35/41) for aGVHD
and cGVHD respectively, with rates of up to 46% (25/54)
of CR in aGVHD and 7.3% (3/41) in cGVHD. OS rates at
6 months were 79% and 97%, respectively. Tapering of
corticosteroids was possible in both aGVHD (17/23, 73%)
and cGVHD (32/56, 57.1%) groups. In the current study,
the median number of prior lines of treatment was 3 (1–5)
among patients with aGVHD, and 3 (1–10) for patients with
cGVHD. Accordingly, the response rates previously
described were obtained in heavily pretreated patients, both
in the current study as well as in the study by Zeiser et al.,
although ORR and CR rates were higher in the German
study. Ongoing prospective randomized trials are required
to confirm these data, although in both studies, the response
rate is remarkable as compared with other approaches [22–
32] and, furthermore, the toxicity profile was manageable in
this fragile population.
The study led by Khoury et al. [15], reported outcomes
of 19 patients with steroid-resistant cGVHD who received
salvage ruxolitnib therapy. In their analysis they described
early PR in 18 out of 19 patients. Of importance, they
remark the reduction to physiologic doses or discontinuation of prednisone in ~90% of patients.
Recently, Incyte Corporation has announced positive
results from its ongoing pivotal Phase 2 REACH1 trial for
aGVHD. The study showed an ORR of 55% (n = 39/71) at
day 28, and the best ORR at any time was 73% (n = 52/71),
thus corroborating our findings. The most common treatment adverse events described were anemia (61%), thrombocytopenia (61%), and neutropenia (56%).
In the current study, the safety profile was satisfactory,
with the most frequent side effects consisting of cytopenias
and CMV reactivation. According to our data, CMV reactivation was observed in both aGVHD (52.2%) and chronic
(19.6%) GVHD during the treatment. However, the analysis
of CMV reactivation before starting ruxolitinib was even
higher, suggesting that treatment with ruxolitinib might not
increase the risk of CMV reactivation as suggested in other
studies. Therefore, CMV copy numbers should be monitored as a standard procedure according to current guidelines for clinical practice in this heavily pretreated group of
patients in order to administer preemptive treatment if
required, not just because of an increased risk of

reactivation related to the drug but because of patients
characteristics.
Concerning other toxicities related to the treatment, we
found cytopenias as the most frequent event. It is known
that JAK–STAT pathways are essential for cytokinemediated hematopoiesis [12]; that is the reason why
thrombocytopenia and anemia are one of the major adverse
effects of ruxolitinib that have been observed in other studies in myelofibrosis. In our study, only three patients discontinued ruxolitinib due to drug-related toxicities,
indicating that the drug shows an excellent toxicity profile.
It is also worth mentioning that a higher immunosuppression might lead to a potential increased risk of
relapse of the underlying malignancy [33]. In our study, we
did not observe any relapse among ruxolitinib-responsive
patients. The only relapse observed in our series was seen in
a patient who did not respond to ruxolitinib. Overall, the
frequency of relapse was very low (1.2%) in comparison
with other studies using other immunosuppressive drugs.
In summary, ruxolitinib in the real life setting has been
shown as an effective and safe treatment option for GVHD
patients, with an ORR of 69.5% and 57.1% for refractory
aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively, among heavily pretreated patients. It is therefore a reasonable alternative to
consider for the treatment of steroid-refractory aGVHD and
cGVHD. Its effectiveness has been shown both in the
improvement of GVHD as well as in the probability to spare
the doses of steroids.
