Abstract
Introduction: Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) increases morbidity in septic patients and, therefore, factors
contributing to SAD should be further characterized. One possible mechanism might be the impairment of
cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR) by sepsis, leading to cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion in these
haemodynamically unstable patients. Therefore, the present study investigates the relationship between the
incidence of SAD and the status of AR during sepsis.
Methods: Cerebral blood flow velocity was measured using transcranial Doppler sonography and was correlated
with the invasive arterial blood pressure curve to calculate the index of AR Mx (Mx>0.3 indicates impaired AR). Mx
was measured daily during the first 4 days of sepsis. Diagnosis of a SAD was performed using the confusion
assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and, furthermore the predominant brain electrical activity in
electroencephalogram (EEG) both at day 4 after reduction of sedation to RASS >-2.
Results: 30 critically ill adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (APACHE II 32 ± 6) were included. AR was
impaired at day 1 in 60%, day 2 in 59%, day 3 in 41% and day 4 in 46% of patients; SAD detected by CAM-ICU was
present in 76 % of patients. Impaired AR at day 1 was associated with the incidence of SAD at day 4 (p = 0.035).
Conclusions: AR is impaired in the great majority of patients with severe sepsis during the first two days. Impaired
AR is associated with SAD, suggesting that dysfunction of AR is one of the trigger mechanisms contributing to the
development of SAD.

Introduction
Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis commonly
develop neurological deficits as part of multi organ failure.
A frequent form of central nervous system dysfunction is
sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) that can be observed in
septic patients [1]. According to the American Psychiatric
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition
(DSM-IV), delirium can be defined as a rapidly evolving
medical condition caused by a combination of disturbance
of consciousness and change in cognition or confusion
that is not accounted for by pre-existing dementia. Most
importantly, SAD could be associated with increased
morbidity [2].
Beside the inflammatory pathway many other mechanisms have been discussed that might cause SAD, such as
microvascular dysfunction [3-6]. Laboratory and clinical
investigations have revealed that cerebral perfusion is
reduced during sepsis and cerebrovascular autoregulation
(AR) may be impaired [7,8]. All ICU patients who die
from septic shock have been shown to have ischemic
brain lesions and furthermore, cerebral haemorrhage has
been found in 26% of patients on neuropathologic examination after the patients died [9]. To maintain adequate
brain function and neuronal integrity, cerebral blood
flow (CBF) under physiologic circumstances is autoregulated within a wide range of cerebral perfusion pressure.

When AR is disturbed, low cerebral perfusion pressures
can lead to global cerebral ischaemia, while high cerebral
perfusion pressures can cause haemorrhage and brain
oedema. Both conditions may lead to neuronal damage
that can potentially trigger SAD. In a small investigation
of 16 patients impaired AR 48 hours after the onset of
sepsis was found to be associated with SAD [10]. However, this study did not analyse the early time course
after the onset of sepsis, measured AR once, and included
only a few patients. Therefore, in the present study investigation of the status of AR began within 24 hours after
the first signs of sepsis became obvious in 30 patients,
the measurements were continued for four days, and the
results tested for correlation with the occurrence of SAD.
Materials and methods
Following ethical care committee approval of RhinelandPalatinate (approval number: 837.435.08) and written
informed consent from legal surrogates, 30 adult
patients were included in the study. All patients had
clinical diagnoses of severe sepsis or septic shock as
defined by the international sepsis definition conference
[11]. Exclusion criteria were pre-existing neurological or
psychiatric diseases, intracranial infection, traumatic
brain injury and pregnancy. Patient recruitment and
first measurements were done within the first 24 hours
after the diagnosis of sepsis was made.
Patient management was performed according to the
international guidelines for management of severe sepsis
and septic shock [12]. In all patients, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)
score was evaluated at day 1 and the Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) - score was evaluated daily.
All patients included were sedated and ventilated at
the ICU. Sedation was performed using propofol and
sufentanil to achieve a target Richmond Agitation and
Sedation Scale (RASS) score of -3 to 0. Mandatory ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/Kg predicted body
weight was performed. Ventilator frequency was adapted
to maintain arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
(paCO2) between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa (35 and 50 mmHg).
Inspiratory oxygen fraction and positive end expiratory
pressure were individually adjusted to achieve an arterial
partial pressure of oxygen (paO2) > 9.0 kPa (70 mmHg).
After stabilisation of the cardiopulmonary condition
sedation was reduced and ventilation was switched to an
assisted spontaneous breathing mode aiming for the
same ventilatory settings. Invasive arterial blood pressure and the haemodynamic monitoring were measured
by pulse contour analysis using a PiCCO®-Catheter
(Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany).
According to the local sepsis treatment protocol, saline
solution was used to reach a global end-diastolic volume
index of 650 to 800 ml/m2
, norepinephrine was used to
reach a mean arterial blood pressure > 65 mmHg, dobutamine was used to reach a target cardiac index > 3.5 l/
min/m2 and a central venous oxygen saturation > 70 %.
Serum lactate level was measured to monitor adequate
sepsis treatment.
Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and cerebrovascular
autoregulation
Measurement of the dynamic AR was performed daily for
the first four days using transcranial Doppler (TCD)
ultrasound. Cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) in
both middle cerebral arteries were measured using 2-
MHz TCD-probes (Doppler Box®, DWL, Sipplingen,
Germany). The probes were positioned over the temporal
bone window above the zygomatic arch and were fixed
with a special frame (DiaMon®, DWL). This procedure
ensured that the angle and the individual depth of insonation were constant during the daily investigation.
The index of AR was calculated using the software ICM
+ (Cambridge Enterprise, University of Cambridge, UK).
Spontaneous variations in CBFV and arterial blood pressure were measured over a 60-minute period, digitized
and then processed calculating the time-averaged values
using waveform time integration for 6-s intervals. The
index of cerebrovascular autoregulation (Mx) was calculated as a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between 30 samples of mean CBFV and mean arterial pressure (MAP)
[13]. Positive association between variations in blood pressure and CBFV (positive values of Mx) indicates passive
dependence of cerebral blood flow, and therefore impaired
AR. Negative or zero values of Mx imply active cerebrovascular responses to changes in blood pressure and
therefore preserved AR. The accepted cutoff level to discriminate between intact and impaired AR was 0.3 and
values above 0.3 indicated impaired AR [14]. Mx was calculated for both brain hemispheres and the mean of both
values over the time of measurement was used for the analysis. This method needs no further manipulation, such as
changes of vasopressor dosing or thigh cuff deflating,
which potentially lead to further complications.
Delirium as a clinical diagnosis was assessed using the
confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)
[2,4]. The CAM-ICU is a validated examination score to
diagnose delirium in mechanically ventilated patients [15].
The CAM-ICU was assessed at day 4 during measurement
of AR when sedative medication was temporarily reduced,
to reach a RASS score greater than -2. In addition, electrophysiological evidence compatible with the diagnosis of
delirium was gathered using electroencephalography
(EEG) (Trex, XLTEK™, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The
EEG was recorded at day 4 after reduction of sedation
(RASS score -2 to 0) with 16 surface electrodes placed
according to the international 10/20-system for standardised placement and impedance level below 5 kΩ. EEGs

were evaluated and interpreted by an EEG board-certified
neurologist. All EEGs were classified by severity based on
the predominant waveform from grade I to IV with I° =
theta-delta-rhythm, II° = delta rhythm, III° = triphasic
waveforms, and IV° = burst-suppression (modified as previously reported [16]).
Laboratory analysis
For assessment of the severity of inflammation, serum
concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured daily. Furthermore, serum
concentrations of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and
S100 were determined daily.
Statistical analysis
Physiological data were expressed as the mean ± SD or
the median (minimum, maximum) for nonparametric
data. The primary endpoint of the present study was to
investigate the association between the status of AR at
day 1 and SAD at day 4. A power analysis calculated a
need for 20 patients, which was increased to 30 because
of the expected inhomogeneous distribution of the incidence of SAD. Data on AR and SAD were dichotomized
in intact/impaired AR and SAD/non-SAD and then analysed using the Fisher exact test for the primary target
(association between AR and SAD), and the KendallTau-c test to compare the diagnosis of SAD using either
CAM-ICU or EEG. To investigate whether other factors
correlate with SAD, analysis of variance (ANOVA) correlations between AR, APACHE II scores, age and
serum markers were performed and furthermore, spearman-Rho-correlations between Mx and serum markers
and paCO2 by day (SPSS, version 19, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Thirty patients, five with severe sepsis and twenty-five with
septic shock, APACHE II score of 32 ± 6, with a mean age
of 64 ± 17 years were included in the study (Table 1). All
patients required cardiovascular support and were sedated
throughout the investigation using propofol and sufentanil. One patient died at day 2. Physiological data are represented in Table 2.
Cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR)
Of the 30 patients, 25 (83%) showed an impaired AR with
an Mx > 0.3 during the first four days, 18/30 (60 %) at day
1, 17/29 (59%) at day 2, 12/29 (41%) at day 3 and 11/24
(46%) at day 4. The highest level of Mx was on the first
day with a median of 0.42 (0.05, 0.96) followed by a
decrease with a median of 0.30 (-0.53, 0.97) between day 2
and day 3 (Figure 1, Table 2).
Sepsis-associated delirium and association with AR
Diagnosis of SAD using the clinical CAM-ICU at day 4
was performed in 23/29 (76%) patients. EEG could be performed in 18/30 (60%) patients. Of these, 17 patients
showed an EEG pattern which is typical for delirium (two
with I°, twelve with II°, one with III°, and two patients with
IV°). There was no association between the clinical diagnosis of delirium based on CAM-ICU and the EEG (P =
0.799). The status of AR at day 1 and the incidence of
SAD using the CAM-ICU at day 4 showed an association
(P = 0.035) (Figure 2), while there was no association
between AR and the SAD detected with EEG. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between age and the
occurrence of SAD, while no correlations with APACHE
II scores, or maximal serum levels of CRP, PCT, NSE or
S100 (Table 3) were found.
Serum markers
Markers of inflammation correlated at day 2 with the
Mx. The maximal serum concentration of S100 during
the investigation correlated with the incidence of SAD
(-0.401, P = 0.028). The serum level of NSE, the severity
of illness assessed by the APACHE II and paCO2 did
not correlate with Mx or SAD (Table 4).
Discussion
The present study revealed the following main findings:
AR was impaired in most of the patients at day 1 followed by recovery during the following days. SAD
(CAM-ICU) was detected in 22/29 patients at day 4,
which was associated with an impaired AR at day 1.
Further minor findings were: the index of AR Mx correlated weakly at day 2 with inflammatory parameters but
not with markers of brain damage (NSE, S100). Nevertheless, the marker S100 was elevated in the patients with
SAD. There was no correlation between the diagnosis of
delirium using CAM-ICU compared to the EEG. Results
from the present study therefore, suggest that impairment of AR and SAD is common in ICU patients, and
impaired AR might be causative to trigger SAD.
Cerebrovascular autoregulation
In the present study the TCD-derived index of AR Mx
was used for the assessment of the status of AR; this
index has been already calculated for many different clinical conditions: in traumatic brain injury, in carotid artery
disease, in vasospasm, in volunteers, and in sepsis [10,17].
Mx was furthermore compared to many other accepted
tests for assessment of AR: static rate of AR, leg-cuff
release, transient hyperaemic response test, autoregulation index, and phase-shift between slow blood pressure
and CBFV fluctuations [18]. Measurement of the index
Mx need no further manipulation with potential side

effects, and therefore, was used in the present study. The
index of AR Mx was measured on a daily basis during
the first 4 days after the onset of sepsis, showing an
increased index Mx and, thereby, a disturbed AR during
the first 2 days of sepsis followed by a recovery of AR
during the next two days. This time course with initial
impaired AR followed by a recovery was also observed in
patients with intracranial lesions [19]. The question of
whether the disturbance of AR is a clinical sign of critically ill patients in general, or a typical problem of septic
patients, cannot be answered by the present study.
Nevertheless, the finding that AR is disturbed in septic
patients is of clinical relevance, because in patients with
impaired AR, the cerebral perfusion pressure has to be
closely controlled to avoid cerebral ischaemia due to low
cerebral perfusion pressures or haemorrhage, and brain
oedema with high cerebral perfusion pressures.
Therefore, the findings of the present study suggest a
tightly controlled cerebral perfusion pressure in septic
patients during the first 2 days.
Sepsis-associated delirium
SAD occurs in many septic patients and may be a risk
factor for morbidity [2]. This is in line with the results of
the present study where 77 % of all patients developed
SAD. To assess SAD, several methods can be used. The
CAM-ICU is the most popular, however, it can only be
applied during interruption of the sedative medication
and with RASS score > -2 [15]. Assessment of delirium
using EEG has been successfully performed in 69 septic
patients who were awake [16]. However, in the present
study the results for the diagnosis of SAD using the
CAM-ICU and the EEG did not correlate. Possibly the
individual sedation during the recording of EEG was not

comparable between the two studies, as in the present
study patients were sedated, while in the former study
the patients were awake. Propofol can dose-dependently
affect the EEG directly by an increase of slow waves.
However, it is also possible that the EEG changes during
sepsis do not reflect the clinical signs of SAD. This suggests that the validity of EEG to detect the occurrence of
SAD in slightly sedated patients should be prospectively
evaluated in a larger series of patients using a more standardised sedation. In conclusion, the diagnosis of SAD is
defined by mental changes and a clinical method to
detect these psychiatric changes is therefore, recommended for ICU patients, especially the CAM-ICU [15].
Association of AR and SAD
Disturbed AR may lead to global brain ischaemia due to
hypotension in the absence of adequate regulatory compensation. This ischaemia may be a trigger for brain
dysfunction like SAD. In the present study an association between impaired AR at day 1 and SAD at day 4
was shown. An investigation including 10 patients with
pathological EEG results and sepsis showed intact CO2
reactivity [20] and therefore, assumed that no correlation between SAD and cerebrovascular haemodynamic
exists. However, the CO2-dependent autoregulation of
CBF is much more resistant towards influences compared to the blood pressure-dependent CBF autoregulation, which was tested in the present study. This might
explain why the CO2 reactivity study showed no
impaired vasomotor reactivity, while in the present
study the MAP-dependent AR was impaired in patients
with SAD. On the other hand, in 16 septic patients the
index Mx was measured once during the first 48 hours
after stabilisation and disturbance of AR was correlated
with the diagnosis of SAD (CAM-ICU) [10]. In another
study the cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide

was impaired in 14 patients with sepsis and disturbance
of consciousness compared with a control group [21].
This association between AR and SAD was confirmed in
the present study, investigating 30 septic patients over a
period of 4 days. Patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock showed an association between impaired AR and
SAD. Therefore, impaired AR might be an influencing
factor for the development of SAD in these patients.
These results suggest that fluctuations in blood pressure,
which regularly occur during the first days of sepsis, in
combination with the impaired AR might result in
global brain hypo- or hyperperfusion and cause SAD.
This assumption cannot be verified using the presented
data but the detected association between impaired AR
and SAD further supports the need for trials investigating whether a tight control of arterial blood pressure,
avoiding hypo- and hypertension during the first days of
sepsis, could reduce the incidence of SAD.
Serum markers
Levels of CRP and PCT, validated markers of inflammation, correlated only at day 2 with the index of AR Mx.
Possibly, disturbance of AR is fostered by the underlying
inflammation caused by endothelial dysfunction due to
endotoxins from bacteria, or cytokines like ICAM-1
from the immune response [22,23]. The peak of CRP
and PCT after onset of infection may be delayed and
represents the severity of inflammation mainly at day 2.
This would explain why the correlation of Mx with CRP
and PCT could be found only at day 2.
Limitations of the study
The sedation management with propofol in combination
with sufentanil did not influence AR in patients under
general anaesthesia and after head injury [24-26]. It is
therefore, unlikely that the sedative regime affected AR
during this investigation.
To minimize any bias the same technical equipment
was always used. TCD is an operator-dependent tool
because of the dependency of the angle of insonation.
However, for the assessment of AR only the relation of
changes in CBFV in correspondence to changes in MAP
was used rather than the absolute values of CBFV.
The levels of paCO2 in the present study were in the
upper normal range and increased from 43 ± 9 mmHg
at day 1 to 48 ± 9 mmHg at day 4, and might have
influenced the AR [27]. This was tolerated because of
the benefit of spontaneous breathing for the patient.
However, the influence of this increase in paCO2 on the
present results should be acceptable as high paCO2
further impairs AR. Therefore, the observed recovery of
AR until day 4 should be even more pronounced if
paCO2 was held constant during the investigation.
Another possible influencing factor is hyperthermia,
because an increase of core temperature above 40°C
leads to impairment of AR [28]. However, in the present
study the temperature was between 34.2 and 39.4°C
(mean 37.2 °C) throughout the measurement and therefore, should not be a relevant influencing factor.
Conclusions
The present study showed that AR is impaired in the
majority of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
during the first 2 days. Furthermore, SAD was frequently diagnosed in these patients (76% of all

investigated patients). Impairment of AR was associated
with the occurrence of SAD, suggesting that AR is one
of the factors contributing to SAD. This should be
taken into account for the treatment of these patients.
Key messages
• Cerebrovascular AR is impaired in 83% of patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock
• Among patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock, 76% have sepsis-associated delirium
• Impaired cerebrovascular AR possibly triggers sepsis-associated delirium
• Possibly, mean arterial blood pressure should be
tightly controlled during the first 2 days in septic
patients
