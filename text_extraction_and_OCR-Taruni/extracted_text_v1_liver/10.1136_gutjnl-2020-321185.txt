Abstract
Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 
has become a global pandemic. Risk of transmission 
may occur during endoscopy and the goal is to prevent 
infection among healthcare professionals while 
providing essential services to patients. Asia was the 
first continent to have a COVID-19 outbreak, and this 
position statement of the Asian Pacific Society for 
Digestive Endoscopy shares our successful experience 
in maintaining safe and high-quality endoscopy practice 
at a time when resources are limited. Sixteen experts 
from key societies of digestive endoscopy in Asia 
were invited to develop position statements, including 
patient triage and risk assessment before endoscopy, 
resource prioritisation and allocation, regular monitoring 
of personal protective equipment, infection control 
measures, protective device training and implementation 
of a strategy for stepwise resumption of endoscopy 
services after control of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Introduction
In the past 3 months, a new coronavirus of 
SARS-CoV-2, leading to coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19), has been rapidly disseminated 
throughout Asia.1
 The World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic on 11 
March 2020, and by 24 March 2020 the number of 
confirmed COVID-19 cases had increased to more 
than 372000 globally.2
 A cohort study on 1099 
patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan showed 
that typical clinical symptoms included cough and 
sputum, sore throat, fever, fatigue, and shortness 
of breath.3
 More than 40% of patients had contact 
history and 56.2% had no raised temperature. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms are not uncommon 
and 5% of patients had nausea or vomiting and 
3.8–10.1% had diarrhoea.4
 The overall mortality 
was 1.4%, and for those with severe disease the 
mortality was 22.4%.3 5 6
Although there are no data on whether endoscopy 
is an aerosol-generating procedure, positive insufflation during endoscopic procedures could pose a 
risk of generating aerosol and increase the risk of 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Healthcare providers 
of endoscopy therefore are facing tremendous risk 
during the pandemic of COVID-19 as the spread is 
mainly through direct contact or aerosol droplets, 
and endoscopy procedures require a short physical 
distance between patients and personnel. A study 
performed during the SARS outbreak in 2003 
showed that droplets from infected patients could 
reach people located two metres or more from the 
source.7
 In addition, experience from the SARS 
epidemics demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in stool samples and intestinal biopsy samples.8
Recently, it has been confirmed that COVID-19 can 
be found in the oral cavity and faecal samples of 
infected individuals.9–12
To date, joint new guidance on the practice 
of endoscopy has been posted by the American 
College of Gastroenterology and the British Society 
of Gastroenterology.13 14 Contrary to western countries, Asia has already accumulated substantial 
experience in combating the COVID-19 outbreak; 
some regions have shown their ability to prevent 
outbreaks and maintain a high-quality endoscopy 
service without subjecting patients and staff to 
undue health hazards.
The Asian Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE) gathered experts to develop a position paper on the practice of endoscopy during the 
COVID-9 pandemic. The current position statements represent expert opinion and also our experience in combating this outbreak at a time when the 
supply of personal protective equipment is limited. 
Our objective is to provide recommendations for 
endoscopy centres on management and preventive 
measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. APSDE 
emphasises that risk management protocols should 
be developed according to healthcare priorities and 
available resources of individual centres. These 
statements should be considered as a framework 
of good clinical practice rather than a medicolegal 
reference.

Statements
Statement 1. Strategies to triage and assess risk of patients 
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 before endoscopy are 
essential
During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients should be screened, 
triaged and risk stratified before the arrangement of endoscopy 
(figure 1). WHO defined a confirmed case of COVID-19 as a 
person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, 
irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.2
 A probable case is 
defined as a suspected case for whom testing for COVID-19 is 
inconclusive.2 A suspected case is defined based on the following 
three criteria: (1) patients with acute respiratory illness with no 
other aetiology and a history of travel to, or resident in, countries reporting local transmission of COVID-19 during 14 days 
before symptom onset; (2) patients with acute respiratory illness 
who have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case of 
COVID-19 in the past 14 days before symptom onset and (3) 
patients with severe acute respiratory infection requiring hospitalisation and with no other cause that fully explains the clinical 
presentation.2
Before arrival at endoscopy centres, all patients need to 
undergo prescreening and the following information should be 
collected to the best of the ability of each centre: (1) fever of more 
than 37.5 C (F); (2) travel history (T); (3) occupational exposure 
(O); (4) contact history (C); (5) clustering (C) (FTOCC).15 The 
travel history should include all recent travels to countries with a 
high incidence of COVID-19 within the past 14 days. The occupational exposure should include those working as healthcare 
providers and research laboratory staff handling specimens of 
COVID-19. The contact history should trace those who have 
had recent close contact with patients with COVID-19 in the past 
14 days and those who had contacts who had recently travelled 
to high-risk countries. The clustering represents two or more 
COVID-19 positive patients with a history of close contact. Any 
of the positive criteria for FTOCC should be regarded as a clinically suspected case, and COVID-19 testing should be conducted 
before any endoscopic procedure. For all suspected, probable 
or confirmed cases, the clinical indication for endoscopy should 
be reviewed, and only those with emergency or life-threatening 
conditions should receive endoscopy (see statement 3).
Statement 2. Deferment of elective endoscopies should be 
considered until further notice during the COVID-19 outbreak
A report from Hong Kong, based on experience with SARS, 
showed that the risk of infection is 5% for physicians, 4% for 
nurses and 8% for healthcare assistants.16 The authors emphasised the importance of practising strict isolation, infection

control measures and adherence to use of personal protective 
equipment. Most Asian countries adopted a policy of suppression to reduce the epidemic of COVID-19 through case identification, contact tracing and hospitalisation, and had vigorous 
strategies for population-wide social distancing.17 According 
to the prediction model of the Imperial College COVID-19 
response team, a suppression policy can significantly reduce 
mortality and the stress on hospital care capacity.17 However, it 
will require sustainability until a vaccine is available.
We recommend deferring all elective endoscopies during the 
COVID-19 outbreak until the pandemic is over. This strategy 
helps to preserve the surge capacity for hospitals to manage a 
massive number of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID19.15 16 18 Moreover, this will safeguard the potential transmission of COVID-19 between patients and to healthcare providers, 
especially at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.16 18 It 
will also allow time for healthcare providers at the endoscopy 
centre to receive appropriate education and training on infection 
control measures. A retrospective case series from Iran reported 
on four surgical patients who developed severe complications 
after elective surgery in the first few weeks of COVID-19. All 
showed either clinical signs or tested positive for COVID-19, 
and three out of four patients died.19 The endoscopy centre 
should keep a record of patients with deferred endoscopy 
appointments and rearrange their appointments according to 
the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak. Table 1 shows the 
list of elective procedures that could be deferred until further 
notice.
For patients who require semi-urgent endoscopic procedures, 
clinicians should decide case by case on the need and indications, 
and those indicated should be performed as urgent endoscopic 
procedures (table 1).
Statement 3. Urgent endoscopies should be performed 
by strategically assigned staff to minimise concomitant 
exposure
During the COVID-19 outbreak, recommended indications for 
urgent endoscopy are limited to acute gastrointestinal bleeding, 
biliary sepsis, gastrointestinal obstruction requiring stenting or 
dilatation, management of gastrointestinal perforations and 
leakage, foreign body retrieval and establishment of access for 
enteral nutrition (table 1). Where urgent endoscopies are necessary, we recommend keeping the number of staff to a minimum, 
with preferably one experienced endoscopist and two nurses 
for each endoscopy room. Ample time should be allowed for 
infection control measures before and after endoscopy. The 
same team of endoscopy staff should serve the same room for 
the whole session.

Medical Instrumentation; PPE, personal protective equipment. Image

Statement 4. Resource reallocation for staff and medical 
equipment is recommended to prepare for a surge in 
healthcare demand
The hospital system will undergo major stress due to a surge 
in the demand for the management of suspected and confirmed 
cases of COVID-19. As a result, endoscopy centres should 
rationalise and prioritise the allocation of resources, including 
endoscopists, nurses, healthcare providers and medical equipment.20 All healthcare providers working at the endoscopy centre 
should receive appropriate education and training on infection 
control measures, including hand hygiene and use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE).21 22 The endoscopy centre should 
arrange designated gown up and gown down areas. The supply 
of medical equipment, especially PPE, will be limited during the 
pandemic.
Statement 5. Regular monitoring of supply and use of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary to adjust 
endoscopy service and uphold morale of staff
The use of medical supplies should be carefully planned. Administrators of the endoscopy centre should regularly communicate 
with the hospital administration about the supply and logistics 
of medical equipment and PPE. The stock and use of consumables, PPE and other equipment should be monitored daily to 
allow better planning of service and to avoid inadequate supply 
of PPE, which may jeopardise safety and morale of staff. Conservation of PPE is critical and only essential personnel should be 
present during procedures (table 2).
Statement 6. Healthcare workers should practise standard 
infection control for endoscopy
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be transmitted indirectly 
through contaminated surfaces and fomites, and survival of virus 
on surfaces can last for hours to days.23 Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 
survival has been reported in confined public spaces, including 
restrooms, elevators and door knobs.24 All endoscopists, nurses 
and healthcare providers should receive training on infection 
control and appropriate use of PPE during endoscopy.21 22 25 26
Standard hand hygiene procedures before and after each case 
should be practised. Ethanol (62–71%concentration), 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.1–0.5%sodium hypochlorite are commonly 
used as disinfectants and can reduce the concentrations of coronavirus within 1min of exposure time.27 Effective hand hygiene 
decreases the risk of transmission and was proved to be beneficial 
during SARS.28 Universal hand washing and the use of alcoholbased hand rubs on entering and leaving endoscopy rooms are 
highly recommended.
We recommend the use of PPE according to risk stratification 
(table 2). The definition of a suspected, probable and confirmed 
case is listed by WHO.2
 For patients defined as suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19, enhanced PPE should be practised 
during endoscopy, including the use of a N95 mask; isolation 
gown with water resistance; head cover; eye protection and face 
shield.25 26 29 The procedure should be conducted in negative 
pressure room when available (see statement 9).
For patients who are FTOCC negative and not suspected to 
have COVID-19, healthcare providers should perform endoscopy with PPE, including a face mask; isolation gown with water 
resistance; eye protection. As endoscopy may be an aerosolgenerating procedure, endoscopists should be allowed to select 
the most appropriate PPE for the procedure. Interactions with 
patients, including informed consent and checking vital signs, 
should be performed while maintaining some distance, and with 
rigorous hand washing before and after interactions.
Statement 7. Healthcare workers should receive adequate 
training on gowning and removal of PPE
Many health workers, including endoscopists, nurses, healthcare workers and anaesthetists, work in endoscopy suites, with 
different types of procedures being performed daily. There is 
a certain risk of exposing staff to respiratory, oropharyngeal 
and faecal secretions. Furthermore, aggressive suctioning and 
multiple catheter exchange via endoscope working channels may 
expose staffs to splashes of secretion.30 Microorganisms have 
been detected on the walls of endoscopy suite and postoperative recovery areas.31 During the SARS epidemic, 21% of people 
affected were healthcare workers.32 The grouping of many 
patients and healthcare workers at endoscopy can put them at risk 
of human to human transmission. For patients with COVID-19 
who require endoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia, 
anaesthesis should be conducted by a designated team while 
other members of the endoscopy team should stay outside the 
room. The anaesthetic procedure should be performed with 
all healthcare providers in full PPE.33 Biopsy samples obtained 
from the infected person can also be a source of infection as 
active viral replication was identified during the SARS pandemic 
in 2003.8
 Hence, all specimen from patients with COVID-19 
should be handled with extra precaution and with appropriate 
protective equipment. Training should be provided for all staff 
for PPE gowning and downing. Figure 2 illustrates the typical 
PPE used in our unit in Hong Kong.
Statement 8. Extra precaution is recommended during 
colonoscopies as prolonged faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 
can occur
Although the risk of faecal transmission for SARS-Cov-2 is not 
clear, it remains plausible as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected 
in the stool of patients with and without symptoms, and viral 
shedding occurs.9–12 It may also persist despite negative results 
in the respiratory tract. This can result in viral transmission via 
aerosolisation and faecal-oral route of contamination.34 A recent 
study showed that there is prolonged presence of SARS-Cov-2 
viral RNA in faecal samples for up to 47 days after onset of 
the first symptoms.35 As endoscopes are often affected by gut 
flora, this could pose a risk to endoscopists, nursing staff and 
other endoscopy staff and could also be a vector for potential

transmission to other patients.36 37 Therefore, it is important for 
staff performing colonoscopies to aware of this potential risk, 
and colonoscopy should be considered a high-risk procedure 
and careful decontamination procedures vigilantly performed 
(see statement 10).
Statement 9. Endoscopies should be performed in a 
negative pressure room when available with strict isolation 
precautions in suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19
For suspected, probable and confirmed COVID-19 cases, ideally 
we recommend performance of endoscopy in a negative pressure 
room. As most endoscopy units may not have a negative pressure room, the procedure can be performed in a venue outside 
the endoscopy centre, with negative pressure in the operation 
theatre, for example, or in a room with better ventilation. In 
the endoscopy centre, it is important to keep all patients at an 
appropriate distance from each other (two metres is recommended) while considering each facility’s situation and capacity. 
Care givers or relatives of patients are strictly prohibited from 
entering the endoscopy department except in special circumstances in which patients require specific assistance.
Statement 10. Disinfection policy for endoscopy rooms and 
reprocessing of instruments should be enhanced
The standard of disinfection and reprocessing of endoscopy 
instruments should be practised according to American Society 
for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines.25 26 Each endoscopy department 
should have a detailed plan for cases of non-COVID-19 and 
suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Standard room disinfection 
should be conducted at the end of the session in rooms where 
non-COVID or low-risk patients had endoscopy. For patients 
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who require emergency 
endoscopy, the endoscopic procedure should be performed at 
the end of the session and the room should be cleaned after these 
procedures with staff using appropriate PPE. The disinfection 
and reprocessing of the endoscope and instruments used for a 
patient with COVID-19 will be similar to those used in standard practice.25 26 All disposable devices used for a patient with 
COVID-19 should not be re-used. If treatment of patients with 
COVID-19 is performed in negative pressure rooms, a delay of 
30min is recommended before a new patient enters the room. 
Although no cases of endoscope-related COVID-19 transmission 
have been reported, this risk exists, especially in view of previous 
experience with hepatitis B and C viruses. It is likely that current 
endoscope disinfection techniques are sufficient.
Statement 11. Stepwise resumption of elective endoscopy 
services should be guided by control of COVID-19 in the local 
community, availability of manpower and equipment supply
With steady increase in the number of confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 among different countries and cities worldwide, it 
is difficult to determine the most appropriate time to resume 
regular service at endoscopy centres. The Imperial College 
COVID-19 response team predicted that suppression strategies 
will need adaptive triggering once rebound occurs.17 It is likely 
that most countries will adopt a time-bound approach in the 
resumption of partial or full service depending on the following 
factors: (1) the number and epidemic curve of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases; (2) the availability of medical equipment, 
including appropriate PPE; and (3) the accumulated volume of 
postponed endoscopy cases. Some non-urgent procedures are of 
higher priority for resumption and may need to be performed, 
such as cancer evaluations and evaluation of significant symptoms. We recommend that endoscopy centres resume an elective endoscopy service in a stepwise manner in phases (table 3). 
For example, in the initial phase the daily volume of endoscopic 
procedures should be 50% of the normal capacity. The situation may also change with a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases, 
limitation of PPE and other medical supplies, and fatigue or 
limitation of healthcare providers. The administrators of endoscopy centres should have close and regular communication with 
the hospital management team and closely monitor the outbreak 
for any rapid change in plan to keep a sustainable and effective 
endoscopy service.
