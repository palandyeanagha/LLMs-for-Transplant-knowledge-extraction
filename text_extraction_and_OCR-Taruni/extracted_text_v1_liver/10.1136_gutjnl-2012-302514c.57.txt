Introduction In selected patients, liver transplantation (LT) is
considered a curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). With the application of strict eligibility criteria the risk of
tumour recurrence can be minimised but never entirely eliminated.
Historically, HCC recurrence is associated with a poor prognosis;
however the new and evolving systemic therapies may improve
outcomes. Hence, there may be a potential beneficial role for early
diagnosis. Although, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement is
commonly employed in HCC surveillance in at-risk patients, its role
following LT for HCC is not clearly defined. Therefore, we have
explored (1) the utility of AFP as a biomarker for tumour recurrence
following LT in patients with HCC and (2) the influence of liver
disease aetiology on its diagnostic performance.
Methods The clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and
outcomes of 302 patients with HCC who underwent LT between
January 1999 and July 2011 at our institution were reviewed. Serum
AFP levels following LTwere analysed and the area under a receiveroperator characteristic curve (AUC) calculated to assess the
performance of AFP as a diagnostic test for HCC recurrence.
Results Recurrent HCC was observed in 13% of patients during the
follow-up period. Recurrence was associated with higher pre-LT AFP
(98 ng/ml vs 11.5 ng/ml, p>0.001), vascular invasion in the liver
explant, and greater tumour size. Following LT, the median time
from initial rise in serum AFP to the diagnosis of recurrence was
16 weeks. In our cohort, AFP was an effective predictor of HCC
recurrence (AUC 0.843) and using a cut-off value of $10 ng/ml was
an excellent exclusion test (negative predictive value 0.94).
Furthermore, its performance was superior in patients with AFPsecreting tumours at LT, in comparison to those with non-secreting
tumours (AUC 0.892 vs 0.710). Patients with chronic hepatitis C
(CHC), in comparison to non-infected patients, were younger
(56 years vs 60 years, p¼0.887) and had a lower MELD score (13 vs
10 ng/ml, p¼0.002) but higher serum AFP (21 ng/ml vs 10 ng/ml) at
LT. However, there was no difference in recurrence rates between
groups. In patients with CHC, AFP was an inferior predictor of
HCC recurrence, in comparison non-CHC patients (AUC 0.769 vs
0.887).
Conclusion We, therefore, conclude that serum AFP measurement is
a potentially useful surveillance investigation for tumour recurrence
post-LT for HCC particularly in patients without CHC.

Introduction Several small studies have suggested that split liver
transplant (SLT) recipients have an increased frequency of
peri-operative acute kidney injury (AKI). However, given that
hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury may play a role in the pathogenesis of peri-transplant AKI, the optimal donor selection of split
liver transplantation could have a favourable impact on renal
outcomes. Our aim was to compare renal outcomes in SLT recipients
with matched full-size liver transplant (FSLT) controls.
Methods Single-centre study of 72 patients who received a SLT for
chronic liver disease 01/2007e06/2011. 72 FSLT (Donation after
Brain Death) controls were matched by propensity-risk-score.
Definitions: AKI, peak creatinine $2 times baseline; chronic kidney
disease (CKD), MDRD4 eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
.
Results SLT recipients and FSLT controls were well matched on
confounders. Split liver grafts had a younger donor age (p<0.001),
longer cold ischaemic time (p¼0.026) but similar warm ischaemic
time (p¼0.213). There was no difference in the intra-operative red
cell concentrate requirements between the groups (p¼0.460).
During the immediate post-operative period, the median peak AST
was 1156 U/L for SLT recipients and 1124 U/L for FSLT controls
(p¼0.960). The frequency of re-laparotomy for bleeding (p¼0.310),
primary non-function (p¼1.000), sepsis (p¼0.643) and biliary
complications were comparable (p¼1.000). Estimated 3-year patient
survival was 90.0% and 91.8% for SLT recipients and controls,
respectively (log-rank p¼0.400). Peri-operative and long-term
renal outcomes are outlined in Abstract PTU-057 table 1. There
was no difference between the two groups, with the exception of
renal replacement therapy; SLT recipients were less likely to require
peri-operative renal replacement therapy than FSLT controls
(p¼0.048).
Abstract PTU-057 Table 1 Post transplant renal outcomes in SLT
recipients and FSLT controls
SLT FSLT p Value
Peri-operative renal function
Median peak creatinine (mmol/l) 113 116 0.585
Median change in creatinine from baseline (%) +27 +43.6 0.653
AKI (%) 29.2 34.7 0.475
Renal replacement therapy (%) 11.1 23.6 0.048
Long-term renal function
Mean 1-month eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2
) 83 81 0.773
3-year cumulative incidence of CKD (%) 32.5 28.7 0.534
Conclusion SLT recipients are less likely to require peri-operative
renal replacement therapy than well matched FSLT recipients.
Higher graft quality and/or smaller graft volume may have a
beneficial renal-sparing effect.

Introduction Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common indication
for liver transplantation (LT) but recidivism is a significant concern.
There is a need for careful assessment and support prior to LT, with
monitoring for ongoing alcohol use an important aspect of care for
patients on the waiting list (WL).
Methods Patients listed for LT in the UK are required to sign a
contract committing them to lifelong abstinence from alcohol.
