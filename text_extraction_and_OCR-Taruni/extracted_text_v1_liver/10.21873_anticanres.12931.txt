Abstract. Background/Aim: Approximately 10% of patients
are unable to synthesize CA 19.9 (Lewis-negative), and these
results are erroneously considered false-negatives. The aim
of this study was to confirm that CA 19.9 cannot be detected
by immunoassays in Lewis-negative patients. Materials and
Methods: CA 19.9 levels were measured by immunological
assays and Lewis phenotype was determined by the
haemagglutination reaction. Results: Patients with Lewis
phenotype (a+b–) or (a–b+) had significantly higher CA
19.9 levels than Lewis-negative patients with active cancer
(p<0.001), no-evidence of disease (NED) patients (p<0.001)
or patients with benign disease (p<0.001). Ninenty-four
percent of patients (33/35) with undetectable CA 19.9 had a
Lewis-negative phenotype. Additionally, 94.7% (34/36) of
patients with Lewis-negative phenotypes had undetectable
CA 19.9 serum levels. Conclusion: Patients with
undetectable CA 19.9 serum levels tend to be Lewis-negative,
and CA 19.9 is not useful in diagnosis or follow-up.
Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA 19.9), or monosialylated
Lewis is a sialyl-LewisA blood group antigen (Lea
) (1) that
is clinically used as a tumour marker (TM), primarily in
patients with gastrointestinal cancer, especially pancreatic or
cholangiocarcinoma (2-7). However, this TM is not specific
to gastrointestinal malignancies, as increased levels have
been observed in other tumours, such as ovarian mucinous
carcinoma, endometrial cancer or lung cancer (8-10).
Likewise, false-positive CA 19.9 results may be observed in
certain benign diseases that are mainly associated with
hepatobiliary-pancreatic diseases (e.g., pancreatitis, renal
failure, and mucinous cysts) (2, 11-14).
CA 19.9 is a TM that is suggested to help in the diagnosis
of pancreatic cancer, primarily in patients with jaundice, as
well as in therapy monitoring. The sensitivity of CA 19.9 in
pancreatic cancer is approximately 70-90% and is related to
tumour stage and the Le phenotype (2, 15-17). There are three
Le blood phenotypes, depending on the presence or absence
of the Le antigenic epitopes, Lea and Leb: Le(a–b–), Le(a–b+)
and Le(a+b–) (15). Patients with the Le(a–b–) phenotype
(10% of patients) are unable to synthesize CA 19.9 and, as a
result, are being erroneously considered TM-negative when
pancreatic cancer or other malignancies are present (falsenegatives) (18). Likewise, the use of CA 19.9 in the followup will be also erroneously interpreted in these Lewis-negative
patients, because it will be always negative independently of
the patient’s condition. The early identification of Lewisnegative patients will improve the use of this marker, avoiding
false-negative results and increasing sensitivity in those that
are able to release it.
The aims of this study were: i) Confirm that CA 19.9
cannot be detected in Le(a–b–) patients, independently of the
pathology studied and whether the tumour isbenign or
malignant. ii) Evaluate the possible relationship between the
CA 19.9 serum levels determined by immunological assays
and Le phenotypes. iii) evaluate CA 19.9 serum levels in
serial dilutions and confirm that the relationship with the Le
phenotype is not modified.
Materials and Methods
The study included 42 patients with benign diseases, 28 patients
with cancer, but no evidence of disease (NED) after radical
treatment, and 53 patients who had active cancer. Patients with
benign diseases included 10 patients with pancreatic diseases, 7 with
gynaecological diseases, 6 with pulmonary diseases, 3 with
gastrointestinal diseases, 3 with liver diseases, and 13 with other

benign diseases. Patients with NED included 8 patients with gastric
cancer, 8 patients with endometrial cancer, 4 with intestinal cancer,
4 with pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma, one with lung
cancer and 3 with other types of cancer. NED was confirmed at least
12 months after sample determination. Patients with active cancer
included 19 patients with pancreatic cancer (11 stage IV, 8 stage
III),10 with lung cancer (7 stage IV, 3 stage III), 4 with gastric
cancer (stage IV), 4 with intestinal cancer (stage II-III), 3 with
endometrial cancer (stage II) and 13 with other types of cancer (11
stage IV, 2 stage III).
Blood samples, were collected by venous puncture in plasma
EDTA K3 tube and serum gel separator tubes. After centrifugation,
serum samples were taken for routine biochemistry evaluation of
CA19.9, which was performed routinely using the autoanalyzer
Elecsys 411® (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), considering
37 U/ml as the cut-off level. One aliquot of serum was preserved at
-20°C for future experiments. Once the patients were randomly
selected, the plasma sample was used to study the Le phenotype by
a haemagglutination reaction using anti-Lewisa and anti-Lewisb
monoclonal antibodies (Sanquin Plesmanlaan, Amsterdam,
Netherlands). Patients were classified into Le phenotype groups:
Le(a–b–), Le(a–b+) and Le(a+b–).
Clinical data, including diagnosis, type of cancer, stage of cancer,
presence of effusion and analytical information (creatinine, total
bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase and carcinoembryonic antigen) were
registered in all of the patients included in our study. In addition, we
collected the CA 19.9 results retrospectively in (serial determination)
28 Le(a–b–) patients, 47 Le(a–b+) patients and 18 Le(a+b–) patients.
Patients with cancer were classified according to the TNM
classification (19). This protocol was approved by the Ethical
Committee of the Hospital Clinic. The laboratory has a total quality
management system and was certified with ISO 9001:2015 standards
by AENOR (Asociacion Española de Normalización y Certificación,
Spain).
Statistical methods. The Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney
test were used to compare the CA 19.9 levels between the Le
phenotype groups. Box-plot graphs were also generated. Statistical
significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. Statistical
analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20
(SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
CA 19.9 results obtained in the different groups of patients
are shown in Table I. Abnormal CA 19.9 serum levels
(>37 U/ml) were found in 33 of the 123 (26.8%) patients,

including 4 patients with benign diseases, 4 NED patients
and 25 patients with active cancer. Significantly higher CA
19.9 concentrations were observed in patients with active
cancer ((median (interquartile range); 28(4-220) U/ml) than
in those patients with NED (6(1-21) U/ml) or in those with
benign diseases (5(0-24) U/ml) (p<0.001).
The Lewis phenotype was Le(a–b–) in 36 (29.3%) patients,
Le(a–b+) in 63 (51.2%) patients and Le(a+b–) in the
remaining 24 (19.5%) patients. Patients with Le(a+b–) had
significantly higher concentrations of CA 19.9 (median
(interquartile range); 53(28-114) U/ml) compared to those
with Le(a–b+) (10(5-67) U/ml) (p<0.0001), and both had
higher levels than the Le(a–b–) group (p<0.001). A Box-plot
between the CA 19.9 concentration and Lewis phenotype is
depicted in Figure 1. Similar results were observed when
patients were subdivided according to the Le phenotype and
tumour stage; significantly higher CA 19.9 levels were found
in active cancer than in benign or NED in both Le(a-b+) and
Le(a+b-) (NED) (p<0.001) (Figure 2). Interestingly, there is
a trend towards higher CA 19.9 serum levels in Le(a+b–)
patients than in patients with the Le(a–b+) phenotype, but this
finding was only significant in patients with non-active
cancer (benign and NED) (p=0.003) and not in patients with
active cancer (p=0.153) (Table II, Figure 2).These differences
were not due to bilirubin concentrations, since they were
similar in the Le(a–b+)(median (interquartile range); 0.7 (0.2-
2.3) mg/dl) and Le(a+b–) (0.6(0.3-0.8) mg/dl) groups.
Table III shows the CA 19.9 distribution according to the
Lewis phenotype. Interestingly 94.3% of patients with
undetectable CA 19.9 (33 out of 35) had a Lewis-negative
phenotype. Ninety-six percent of patients with detectable CA
19.9 levels had Le(a–b+) or Le(a+b–) phenotypes. In other
words, 94.4% of patients with, Le(a–b–) patients had
undetectable or very low CA 19.9 serum levels, and only 2
(5.5%) patients had slightly high serum levels and advanced
biliary tract tumours (41 and 91 U/ml).
Similar results were obtained when serial dilutions of CA
19.9 serum samples were evaluated in 93patients as shown
in Table IV. Serial CA 19.9 determinations were performed
in 28Le(a–b–) patients (median 5, range=2-19
determinations) and in 26 (92.8%) of them CA 19.9 was
undetectable. In contrast, CA 19.9 was always detectable in
65 of 67 (97%) patients with positive Le phenotype,
including 47Le(a–b+) patients and 18 patients with the
Le(a+b–) phenotype (Table IV).
Discussion
CA 19.9 has been suggested to help in diagnosis and therapy
monitoring of gastrointestinal tumours, primarily of
pancreatic cancer (2-5, 8-10). The sensitivity of this marker
is high, even at the early stages, and differences according
to tumour extension are quantitative. However, in the group

of patients negative for CA 19.9, there were several patients
that were unable to synthesize this antigen, namely, those
with the Le(a–b–) phenotype (15, 18, 20-22). These results
were confirmed in our study, and a clear relationship
between the CA 19.9 serum levels and the Le phenotype or
tumour stage was observed. However, in our study, CA 19.9
serum levels were significantly higher in Le(a+b–) than in
those with Le(a–b+) in both active cancer and other

conditions, independent of the most common source of false
positive results, namely, bilirubin concentrations. These
unpublished data, should be confirmed in a study examining
a large number of patients.
The absence of CA 19.9 release or synthesis in Lenegative patients implies that in CA 19.9-negative patients
suspected to have cancer, the Le phenotype should be
determined to avoid misinterpretations. However, the
majority of laboratories do not determine the Le phenotype
in routine samples, since it increases costs and delays and
because clinicians will often only suggest cancer when the
CA 19.9 is abnormally high. Our data clearly showed that
94.3% (33/35) of patients with undetectable CA 19.9 levels
had the Le(a–b–) phenotype. Likewise, 91.7%of patients
(33/36) with the Le(a–b–) phenotype had undetectable CA
19.9 serum levels, and 1 patient (2.8%) had levels of this
antigen that were near the analytical sensitivity. In summary,
our results clearly suggest that undetectable CA 19.9 serum
levels in patients suspicious of having pancreatic cancer
should be evaluated carefully because the possibility of the
Le(a–b–) phenotype is notably high.
Determination of CA 19.9 levels in serial serum samples
confirmed the initial results indicating that ninety-three
percent of patients (27/29) had undetectable CA 19.9 serum
levels, and 96% (26/27) of them were Le negative. Likewise,
CA 19.9 levels in 26 of 28 patients with the Le-negative
phenotype were always undetectable. These data raise the
question whether it is necessary to perform serial CA 19.9
determinations in patients with undetectable levels when they
are always negative, independently of tumour activity. If
10%-15% of the subjects are Le-negative and do not
synthesize CA 19.9, its determination and use as a marker to
follow-up these patients is meaningless. In 2015, 6713
analyses of CA 19.9 levels were performed in our laboratory,
and in 9.13% of them CA 19.9 was not detected. Exclusion
of these patients from follow-up will decrease cost, increase
efficiency, and avoid misinterpretations.
It is surprising that 2 Le-negative patients with active
pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma had detectable CA
19.9 serum levels (41 and 91 U/ml). We repeated the Le
phenotype evaluation, which was confirmed. It is interesting
to observe that serial determinations of CA 19.9 in these
patients showed that the changes in the levels of this tumour
marker did not relate to tumour evolution. Hamada et al. (17)
also detected CA 19.9 in a small number of patients who
genetically lacked the Lewis enzyme. Several studies
explained this paradox with the hypothesis that Lewisnegative patients can release a part of the protein, and certain
antibodies used in the enzymatic immunoassay might detect
them (23, 24). Another hypothesis would be that CA 19.9
positivity may derive from a cross-reaction of the antibodies
used for CA 19.9 determination, as has been previously
reported (25, 26). To reduce interference of cross-reactions
within CA 19.9 analysis, serial dilutions of antigens or
antibodies were performed, and these CA 19.9 levels were
not demonstrated to be non-specific.
To conclude, CA 19.9 levels were related to the Lewis
phenotype and status of the disease. Lewis-negative patients
had undetectable levels of CA 19.9 in 91.7% of the cases in
a serial determination, suggesting that this TM is not useful
in diagnosis and follow-up of this group of patients. This
result suggests that CA 19.9 analysis is meaningless in
Lewis-negative patients with benign disease or cancer.
