Prognostic limitations of the Eurotransplant-donor
risk index in liver transplantation

Abstract
Background: Liver transplantation is the only life-saving therapeutic option for end-stage liver disease. Progressive
donor organ shortage and declining donor organ quality justify the evaluation of the leverage of the Donor-Risk-Index,
which was recently adjusted to the Eurotransplant community’s requirements (ET-DRI). We analysed the prognostic
value of the ET-DRI for the prediction of outcome after liver transplantation in our center within the Eurotransplant
community.
Results: 291 consecutive adult liver transplants were analysed in a single centre study with ongoing data
collection. Determination of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was performed to
calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of the Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index (ET-DRI) for the
prediction of 3-month and 1-year mortality, as well as 3-month and 1-year graft survival. Cut-off values were
determined with the best Youden-index. The ET-DRI is unable to predict 3-month mortality (AUROC: 0.477) and
3-month graft survival (AUROC: 0.524) with acceptable sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness (54% and 56.3%,
respectively). Logistic regression confirmed this finding (p = 0.573 and p = 0.163, respectively). Determined cut-off
values of the ET-DRI for these predictions had no significant influence on long-term patient and graft survival
(p = 0.230 and p = 0.083, respectively; Kaplan-Meier analysis with Log-Rank test).
Conclusions: The ET-DRI should not be used for donor organ allocation policies without further evaluation, e.g. in
combination with relevant recipient variables. Robust and objective prognostic scores for donor organ allocation
purposes are desperately needed to balance equity and utility in donor organ allocation.

Background
Expansion of the organ donor pool by using grafts with
reduced quality has become reality in transplant centers
around the world due to increasing donor organ shortage and raising numbers of patients on the waiting lists.
This has led to an increased awareness of the associated
risks for patient and graft survival [1-16]. Thus, a series
of attempts to develop objective scores for the assessment of donor liver quality with significant influence on
patient and/or graft survival have been made [1,2,4-9].
In the transplant literature there is a current debate on
the criteria for statistical validation of prognostic scores
in liver transplantation that may be relevant for fair and
just allocation rules that balance equity and utility
[10,12,13,17,18]. Astonishingly, there is still a high heterogeneity of statistical approaches to the validation of
prognostic scores even though Jacob et al. published as
early as 2005 uniform quality criteria for the design, validation and reporting of prognostic scores in liver transplantation more than eight years ago [18]. Last year we
have reported from our centre that the Donor-RiskIndex is not applicable to our patients for the prediction
of three month mortality, three month patient survival,
three month graft survival as well as the necessity of
acute retransplantation within thirty days [13]. In contrast Blok et al. claimed in the same year that they were
able to validate the value of the DRI for the prediction
of three month, one year and three years graft survival
in the Eurotransplant region [3]. In this study as well as
in earlier studies the authors could not demonstrate

areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) greater than 0.700 for these predictions
[3,4,7,13]. This raises the fundamental question: What
are the criteria for a robustly validated prognostic model?
A relevant body of scientific literature in the biostatistical world agrees on the outstanding value of the
receiver operating curve analysis for the determination
of the value of clinical prognostic scores [18-22]. Therefore, we present in this paper a validation study on the
recently published Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index
(ET-DRI) and evaluate its value for prognostic decision
making in the cohort of our center.
This study is a timely contribution to the urgently
needed debate on prognostic models in liver transplantation with potential impact on donor organ allocation
policies. The recent liver transplant scandals in Germany
revolve around waiting list manipulations that affected
donor organ allocation directly and undermined public
trust in current donor organ policies [23].
Results
ET-DRI score
The variables’ frequencies, range and percentages used
in the ET-DRI of our study population are summarized
in Table 1. The mean ET-DRI in this cohort was 1.79
(median 1.70, range: 1.14 - 3.79).
Major results of the analyses of the ET-DRI’s predictive capabilities for the study endpoints are summarized
in Table 2.
Prediction of 3-month mortality
With an AUROC of 0.477 (95%-CI: 0.390-0.564) the ETDRI failed to predict 3-month mortality after liver transplantation in our study population (see Figure 1). This
result could be confirmed by binary logistic regression
(p = 0.692). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test
did show that the model fit of the logistic regression
model was adequate (p = 0.542). Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis above versus below the calculated cut-off level
of the ET-DRI for the prediction of 3-month mortality
(2.06) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172,
Log Rank; see Figure 2).
Prediction of 1-year mortality
Further, the ET-DRI did not reach a relevant AUROC
for the prediction of 1-year mortality (AUROC 0.492)
(see Table 2). A well fitted binary logistic regression
model (p = 0.262, Hosmer-Lemeshow test) revealed no
statistically significant influence of the ET-DRI values on
1-year mortality (p = 0.573). The calculated cut-off level
for this prediction is identical to the cut off for the prediction of 3-month mortality. Therefore, it is no surprise
that the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis above versus
below this cut-off level did also not reach statistical significance (p = 0.230, Log Rank; see Figure 2).
Prediction of 3-month graft survival
With an AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601) the ETDRI failed to predict 3-month graft survival after liver
transplantation in our study population (see Figure 3).
Further, investigation of the ET-DRI as a risk factor for
3-month graft loss with a well fitted binary logistic regression model (p = 0.491, Hosmer-Lemeshow test)
remained insignificant (p = 0.475). Kaplan-Meier analysis
of graft survival above versus below the determined cutoff level for the prediction of 3-month graft survival did
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.655, Log Rank;
see Figure 4).
Prediction of 1-year graft survival
Applied to our data the ET-DRI is not able to predict
1-year graft survival as shown by ROC-curve analysis results (AUROC = 0.540; 95%CI: 0.473-0.607). In binary
logistic regression, which was performed with adequate
model goodness of fit (p = 0.631, Hosmer-Lemeshow
test), the ET-DRI was no statistically significant risk factor for graft loss within one year after transplantation
(p = 0.163). Kaplan-Meier analysis of graft survival above
versus below the determined cut-off level (1.84) did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.083, Log Rank).

Power calculation and sample size
Since the focus of this paper is prognostic estimation rather than hypothesis testing, strictly speaking power
calculations are not directly relevant. The rationale for a
sufficient sample size in the presented study is the fact
that all 95%-CIs of the AUROCs are sufficiently narrow to
exclude 0.700, the nominal criterion value for utility [20].
Discussion
The ET-DRI was originally developed with thousands of
patients transplanted in the Eurotransplant region including many transplant centers and the authors claimed
that the ET-DRI is of prognostic relevance for graft survival after liver transplantation [5]. We believe that the
fundamental discrepancy to our results and interpretation can be related to the fact that the ET-DRI as
shown by Braat et al. cannot reach a c-index above 0.700
for the prediction of graft survival in thousands of liver
transplant recipients [5]. This finding could be confirmed in our study with AUROCs <0.700.
Braat et al. [5] used the previously published DRI [7]
which was developed in the United States and they
attempted to tailor and adapt the DRI to the donor
population in the Eurotransplant region. The goal of our
study was to test the ET-DRI as a prognostic model in
our centre with current MELD-based liver allocation
rules. Braat et al. used a dataset of recipients who were
transplanted in the vast majority of cases outside
MELD-based organ allocation between 2003 and 2007.
MELD-based liver allocation was introduced in Germany
in December 2006 [5]. Braat et al. claimed in their paper
which was published in 2012 that the ET-DRI should be
used for liver allocation in the future [5]. We therefore
believe that our analysis of the ET-DRI with a current
cohort is fully justified in order to assess the potential
merit of the ET-DRI for the future. Braat and colleagues
clearly stated quite righteously that Eurotransplant is divided into different regions; i.e. for Austria, Belgium/
Luxembourg, Croatia, the Netherlands and Slovenia
each country is considered as one region, whereas
Germany is divided into seven regions. Therefore the
term allocation is divided into local (transplant center is
in the procurement area), regional (transplantation and
procurement area within the same country, or region in
Germany), and national or extra-regional (anywhere in
Eurotransplant, but outside the region) [5]. Interestingly,
the ET-DRI calculation formula as shown by Braat et al.
does not contain a criterion for local share. Our analysis
of the influence of local versus regional versus national
share on transplant outcome did not show a significant
impact of local share on outcomes in our cohort
(p < 0.05; Chi2
).
Currently, Avolio et al. have claimed that ROC-curve
analysis is not the adequate measure to assess the value
of prognostic models for graft or patient survival, especially if they include donor organ variables. Additionally,
they postulated that it would be preferable to use timedependent ROC-curve analysis [17]. This notion is an
expansion of the current thinking as expressed in the
majority of recent bio-statistical publications [18-21].
Sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC-curve are
often used to measure the ability of survival models to
predict future risk [18-21]. Estimation of these parameters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are

time-dependent. Furthermore, censoring affects their estimation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or
coefficients of survival regression models [22]. In the
presented study only relatively short time windows
have been investigated. Therefore, application of timedependent ROC-curve analysis is in our view not
justified.
There is currently no objective score for the assessment of donor organ quality available that would be able
to predict short-term patient and graft survival with acceptable overall correctness ((sensitivity + specificity)/2).
It appears safe to assume that extended donor criteria
organs with extreme properties would affect graft survival negatively in the short-term and lead to initial graft
non-function which is known to be associated with increased patient mortality [1,2,4-9,14,15]. Current prognostic scores for donor organ quality are unable to
demonstrate significant statistical influences on shortterm graft survival as robust prognostic tools
[1,2,4-10,12-15]. We believe that these currently available scores may have missed potentially critical parameters and/or combinations of donor organ variables and/
or their interaction that may be critical for a robust
prognostic score to predict short-term graft survival with
acceptable overall correctness. The design of many prognostic scores in the medical literature, including the ETDRI has failed so far to assess multivariable co-linearity
of the influences of variables on the target output variable (e.g. graft survival) [5,18,26].
Hanley and McNeil have shown that c is identical to a
widely used measure of diagnostic discrimination, the
AUROC in ROC-curve analysis [20,21]. A value of c of
0.5 indicates random prediction and a value of 1 indicates
n=231 (79.4%)
n=60 (20.6%)
Figure 2 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month mortality (2.06) shows
that this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term survival (p = 0.172; Log Rank). The curve clearly demonstrates that the
ET-DRI has no influence on long-term survival and limited influence on survival within the first 90 days.

graft survival after liver transplantation with the ET-DRI
(AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601, SD 0.039).

perfect prediction. A model having c greater than roughly
0.7 has some utility in predicting the responses of individual subjects [21]. The c-index 0.624 which was published
before for the prediction of graft survival with the ET-DRI
in a large Eurotransplant cohort [5] appears therefore as a
measure of limited utility of this score.
This study is limited by the relatively small number of
enrolled patients (n = 291). However, none of the 95%
CIs included a relevant AUROC >0.700. Moreover, organ
procurement from donors after cardiac death is a relevant factor of the original population, in which the ETDRI was created [5]. Unfortunately we were not able to
include this specific donor group, because liver donation
after cardiac death is not applied in Germany. Thus, the
results of this analysis may be confounded by the absence of these cases.
Taken together we believe that the ET-DRI or any
other donor risk score should not be used for donor
organ allocation rules without adequate criticism of its
methodological limitations. The transplant community
desperately needs a debate on the power and limitations
of prognostic scores in liver transplantation which
should lead to a consensus. In our opinion Jacob et al.
have made a reasonable proposal for the quality assessment of prognostic models for liver transplantation [18].
The application of a previously developed score to a
new dataset premises that the characteristics of both reference and study populations should result in overlapping
or at least should present similar patterns [17]. This expectation is met with our study population which is a subset of the Eurotransplant population which was used by
Braat and colleagues [5].
We believe that the reasons for our findings which
somehow contrast the previously published findings [5]
are maybe due to a strong center bias. This notion is
likely because our population constitutes a subpopulation of the one that was investigated by Braat et al. [5].
Further, the fact that at least two transplant centers
within the Eurotransplant region are known to believe
that rescue allocated organs do not affect outcome after
of liver transplantation [27,28] and the fact that the percentage of accepted rescue allocated livers for transplantation differs widely within the Eurotransplant
region may contribute to this center bias. In our center
the percentage of rescue allocated livers was comparatively low (18.2%) while approximately 30% of livers in
the Eurotransplant region are transplanted after rescue
allocation [27].
Another critical aspect in donor organ assessment is
the histological diagnostics. Not all donor livers are biopsied. Moreover, the frequency of biopsies is completely dependent on the indication to perform a
histological examination. This subjective and irregular
indication is the responsibility of the explant surgeon or
the accepting transplant center. Recently, two studies described the importance of steatosis as a donor risk factor
n=191 (65.6%)
n=100 (34.4%)
Figure 4 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month graft survival (1.95)
shows that this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term graft survival (p = 0.655; Log Rank). The curve clearly
demonstrates that the ET-DRI has no influence on long-term graft survival.
Reichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 5 of 8

[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should
be added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk
donor. However, objective evaluation of the range of
steatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is
not standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].
We believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may enable the design of more powerful and robust donor risk
scores.
We believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and
ET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact
that graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for
transplantation are not documented and evaluated in
these scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and address this shortcoming immediately, especially on the
background of the current liver transplant scandals in
Germany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a relevant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant centers regard their graft acceptance policy as their
potential advantage in a highly competitive area for a
very scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ shortage. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially
unwanted transparency by the proponents of transplantation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate
robust prognostic scores that include donor organ quality. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious
difficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on
prognosis after transplantation objectively.
The balance of equity and utility in donor organ allocation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk prediction models are available and their head to head
comparisons would benefit from standardized reporting
and formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It
was claimed previously and in a different context that
outcome selection and optimism biases may affect literature on prognostic scores in medicine [26].
We would like to propose joint efforts to develop a robust and objective donor risk score in an international
collaboration that should include the available large
data-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the
time has come for a consensus on the reporting of the
reasons for declined organ offers and on quality standards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis
and validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable
scientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific
journals should make uniform requirements mandatory
for the reporting of prognostic scores.
Conclusion
The results of this current study clearly show that the
ET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our
center within the Eurotransplant community for the prediction of patient or graft survival. On the background
of a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ
allocation which weighs urgency against prediction of
success of liver transplantation must be the aim of future
research in this field.
Patients and methods
Ethics statement
As an observational retrospective study, according to the
Professional Code of the German Medical Association
(article B.III. § 15.1), neither informed consent nor approval of the ethics committee was needed for this
study.
Patients
291 consecutive liver transplants were included to
analyze the model’s accuracy and applicability for this
dataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotransplant community. Included were 20 (6.9%) split liver
transplants, 30 (10.3%) acute re-transplants (retransplantation within 30 days after the previous transplant) and
25 (8.6%) chronic retransplants (primary transplantation
n = 235, secondary transplantation n = 48, tertiary transplantation n = 6, quaternary transplantation n = 1) in a
total of 257 patients (median age: 49.6 years, range: 18–
69 years; males n = 177 (64.4%), females n = 114 (35.6%),
ratio males/females: 1.8). All transplants were performed
in our centre between the 01/01/2007 and the 12/31/
2010. The post-transplant observational period ended on
the 12/31/2011. Indications leading to liver transplantation as well as the most probable leading causes of
death in our cohort are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.
Study end-points
Primary study endpoints were 3-month and 1-year patient mortality and 3-month and 1-year graft survival.
(Graft survival and failure free survival (FFS) are synonyms that describe the time period from date of transplantation until the date of retransplantation or recipient
death).
Statistical analysis
For the primary study endpoints ROC-curve analysis was
performed to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and
overall model correctness of the ET-DRI as a predictive
model. AUROCS larger than 0.7 indicate a clinically
useful prognostic model [18-22]. The respective cut-off
values of the potential prognostic models were determined with the best Youden index (Youden index =
sensitivity + specificity – 1) [24]. If possible, the HosmerLemeshow Chi2
-statistic goodness-of-fit test was applied
to assess model calibration of the binary logistic regression models. These statistics suggest good fit when the
associated p-values are greater than 0.05 [21,25]. Survival
analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
The statistical influence of the determined cut-off values
on patient and graft survival was analyzed with the Log
Reichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 6 of 8
http://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18

Rank test. Binary logistic regression was performed as
additional test to determine the influence of the ET-DRI
on study end-points. For all statistical tests a p-value
<0.05 was defined as significant. The SPSS statistics software version 20.0 (IBM, Somers, NY, USA) was used to
perform statistical analysis.
Calculation of the ET-DRI
The ET-DRI was calculated as described before with this
formula [5]:
ET-DRI = exp[0.960((0.154 if 40 ≤ age < 50) + (0.274If
50 ≤ age < 60) + (0.424 if 60 ≤ age < 70) + (0.501 if 70 ≤
age) + (0.079 if COD = anoxia) + (0.145 if COD = cerebrovascular accident) + (0.184 if COD = other) + (0.411
if DCD) + (0.422 if partial/split) + (0.105 if regional
share) + (0.244 if national share)) + (0.010 × (cold ischemia
time − 8 h)) +0.06((latest lab GGT (U/L)- 50)/100) +
(0.180 if rescue offer)].
Regional share was defined by Braat et al. as allocation
within Germany and national share as allocation within
Eurotransplant land [5].
Data collection
This is a single centre analysis complemented by ongoing data collection.
Setting
The setting of the study is a university hospital in
Germany within the Eurotransplant community.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Included were all consecutive liver transplants performed in adult recipients (minimum age 18 years). Excluded were all combined transplants (e.g. combined
liver and kidney transplantation) and living-related organ
