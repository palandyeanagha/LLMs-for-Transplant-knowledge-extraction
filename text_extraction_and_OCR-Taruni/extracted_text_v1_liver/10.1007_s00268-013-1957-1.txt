Abstract
Background The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) with macroscopic vascular invasion is extremely
poor even after hepatic resection. We aimed to clarify the
efficacy of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAI) for HCC with vascular invasion.
Methods A total of 73 HCC patients with macroscopic
vascular invasion were divided into two groups: 38 with
hepatectomy with HAI (HAI group) and 35 with hepatectomy alone (non-HAI group). From 1997 to 2007, HAI was
performed via an implanted injection port. The treatment
comprised three courses of weekly infusion of HAI, which
comprised cisplatin (10 mg daily on days 1–5) followed by
5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 250 mg daily on days 1–5) infusion.
From 2007, cisplatin (60 mg/m2
), 5-FU (600 mg/m2), and
a mixture of mitomycin C (3 mg/m2
) and degradable starch
microspheres were administered for two courses.
Results Overall, 92 % of patients completed adjuvant HAI.
In the HAI and non-HAI groups, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 33.1 % and 11.8 %, respectively
(p = 0.029), and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were
46.7 % and 32.7 %, respectively (p = 0.318). Among the
patients with Vp3/4 or Vv3 (n = 32) in the HAI group, the
3-year DFS and OS rates were 33.7 % and 56.8 %, respectively (p = 0.049). Those in the non-HAI group were 8.3 %
and 12.0 %, respectively (p = 0.023). Cox proportional
multivariate analysis for DFS revealed that HAI was an
independent favorable prognostic factor in all 73 patients
(hazard ratio 0.536; p = 0.029).
Conclusions Adjuvant HAI for HCC patients with vascular invasion might reduce the risk of recurrence.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy
worldwide [1]. Hepatectomy achieves favorable outcomes
in well-selected candidates and is still considered one of
the most potentially curative treatments for HCC [2].
Unfortunately, the long-term survival after hepatectomy is
unsatisfactory because of the high incidence of tumor
recurrence, especially intrahepatic tumors [3]. After curative hepatic resection for HCC, the recurrence rates at 2
and 5 years are approximately 50 % to 60 % and 80 %,
respectively [4–6]. The prognosis remains extremely poor
in those with advanced HCC with distinct vascular invasion, such as tumor thrombosis of the first branch or trunk
of the portal vein or inferior vena cava [7, 8]. Portal vein
tumor thrombosis (PVTT) can cause widespread dissemination of tumor cells via the portal tract as well as liver
dysfunction and portal vein hypertension. In turn, this can
lead to intractable ascites, variceal rupture, hepatic
encephalopathy, and/or death [9]. The risks of PVTT with
intrahepatic dissemination after local ablation therapy—
e.g., ethanol injection therapy, microwave coagulation
therapy, radiofrequency ablation—for small HCCs adjacent to the main or sectional portal vein were recently

reported [10]. However, even with the removal of a macroscopic PVTT, there may still be microscopic tumor
thrombi, which can be the source of a recurrence. Thus, an
effective adjuvant therapy is required to prevent tumor
recurrence after hepatic resection treatments for patients
with vascular invasion.
Recent advances in implantable drug delivery systems
have facilitated repeated hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAI). Several studies report that intraarterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with low-dose cisplatin [7, 11, 12] or 5-FU
and systemic interferon (IFNa) [13] are the most effective
combinations for unresectable HCCs with PVTT. However,
there is little convincing evidence indicating that adjuvant
therapy reduces the risk of recurrence after hepatic resection.
Furthermore, no standard regimen has been established.
In the present study, we assessed the efficacy and feasibility of intraarterial cisplatin/5-FU combination therapy
for surgically resected HCCs with massive vascular invasion. We identified patients subsets who would most likely
benefit from adjuvant HAI.
Methods
From April 1997 to March 2011, a total of 539 patients
underwent hepatic resection for HCC at Kumamoto University Hospital. Among them, the 77 patients who underwent resection of HCC with macroscopic vascular invasion
(CVp2 or CVv2) and without distant metastasis were
enrolled in this study. The invasion sites of portal venous
invasion (Vp) and hepatic venous invasion (Vv) were defined
as follows: Vp2, second-order branches of the portal vein;
Vp3, first-order branches of the portal vein; Vp4, main trunk
or opposite the first branch of the portal vein; Vv2, main
trunk of the hepatic vein; Vv3, inferior vena cava. Portal or
hepatic venous invasion was diagnosed based on the findings
of preoperative imaging studies, such as dynamic computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
CT angiography. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by
histopathological examinations of the resected specimens.
The entry criteria of HAI group were as follows: no
recurrence confirmed 1 month after hepatic resection;
appropriate liver function reserve; good performance status;
sufficient recovery from the operation. Four patients died
because of postoperative complications (liver failure 2; acute
respiratory distress syndrome 1; intraabdominal infection 1)
and were excluded from analysis. The remaining 73 patients
were reviewed retrospectively. In all, 38 patients treated with
hepatic resection and HAI were allocated to the HAI group.
During the same period, 35 patients who underwent hepatic
resection without HAI therapy by the same surgical team were
allocated to the non-HAI group. The reasons why patients did
not receive HAI were as follows: early recurrence (n = 10),
disapproval of the therapy (n = 10), advanced age (n = 4),
co-morbidities (n = 7), poor performance status (n = 4).
Patients diagnosed with multiple and hypervascular
tumor recurrence in the remnant liver on CT angiography
1 month after hepatic resection (n = 10) were treated with
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using cisplatin
suspended in Lipiodol with a gelatin sponge instead of HAI
according to our treatment strategy [14]. This study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and the ethical guidelines for clinical studies of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Surgical technique
All patients underwent hepatic resection performed by two
senior liver surgeons. The operative procedure was determined beforehand on the basis of the liver function reserve,
the extent of the main and satellite tumors, and portal or
venous invasion. Parenchymal dissection was performed
using an ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA; Valley Lab,
Boulder, CO, USA) and bipolar forceps with intermittent
clamping of the portal triad. After 2005, we preferred a
precoagulation technique using a dissecting sealer (Valley
Lab) or the VIO soft coagulation system (ERBE, Elektromedizin GmbH, Tu¨bingen, Germany) [15]. For the patients
with Vp4, the PVTT was removed using the ‘‘peeling off’’
technique [16]. In brief, the portal venotomy was placed
after adequate vascular control of the portal flow was
established. The PVTT was dissected from the portal
venous wall and removed via the opening. Macroscopic
residual PVTTs intruding into tiny branches were extracted
meticulously. A multiperforated drain was placed in the
abdominal cavity at the end of the procedure.
HAI treatment
From 1997 to 2007, patients with HCCs were treated by
arterial infusion of a chemotherapeutic agent via a subcutaneously implanted injection port (old protocol). In principle, a hepatic arterial catheter was placed 2 to 3 weeks
after the operation via the femoral artery. Celiac angiography was performed according to the Seldinger technique.
A 4For 5F heparin-coated catheter was introduced into the
proper or common hepatic artery. The gastroduodenal and
right gastric arteries were occluded using a steel coil to
prevent gastroduodenal injury caused by anticancer agents.
After the catheter was connected to the injection port, the
device was implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the right
lower quadrant to avoid catheter kinks. One course consisted of cisplatin administration (10 mg daily on days 1–5)
and subsequent infusion of 5-FU (250 mg daily on days
1–5). After confirming a lack of recurrence in the remnant

liver by CT angiography 4 weeks after surgery, HAI was
started and repeated for 3 courses. The injection port was
removed 1 week after the end of HAI with confirmation of
a lack of recurrence.
From 2007, patients with HCC were treated without an
injection port (new protocol). Briefly, a 4F or 5F heparincoated catheter was introduced into the proper hepatic artery.
Cisplatin (60 mg/m2
) dissolved in 100 ml saline for 10 min
followed by 5-FU (600 mg/m2
) in 100 ml saline for 10 min
were injected into the proper and more distant hepatic
arteries, respectively. Then, mitomycin C (3 mg/m2
) dissolved in 3 to 5 ml of saline mixed with 3 to 5 ml of
degradable starch microspheres (DSMs) (Spherex; Yakult,
Tokyo, Japan) was administered. This procedure was repeated twice at 4 weeks after surgery with a 1-month interval.
Follow-up
The follow-up program included serum a-fetoprotein
(AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or
antagonists-II (PIVKA-II) assays every 1 to 2 months.
Imaging follow-up was performed using transabdominal
ultrasonography (US) examination or computed tomography (CT) every 3 to 4 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed when deemed necessary. During
follow-up, if recurrence was recognized the patient was
treated with a second hepatectomy, TACE, radiofrequency
ablation, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.
Data collection
Information on 15 variables was collected for each patient
as potential risk factors for recurrence and predictors of
survival. The extents of vascular involvement and tumor
differentiation were confirmed in the resected specimen.
Segmentectomy of C3 was defined as a major hepatic
resection. Others were defined as minor hepatic resections.
The continuous variables of age, indocyanine green
retention at 15 min (ICG-R15), main tumor size, and serum
AFP and PIVKA-II levels were categorized by cutoff
values according to their median values: 64 years, 10 %,
60 mm, 70.2 ng/ml, and 697 IU/ml, respectively.
Statistical analyses
Student’s t test, the v2 test,or Fisher’s exact test was used
where appropriate to compare the clinical and histologic
parameters between the two groups. The cumulative survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan–Meier
method. Survival curves were statistically compared using
the log-rank test. Univariate analysis of the data from all
cases was performed. Variables that exhibited statistical
significance in the univariate analysis were subsequently
included in the multivariate analysis, which was performed
using Cox proportional hazard analysis. For all tests, the
level of significance was set at p\0.05.
Results
The clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients
are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The mean age was
significantly lower in the HAI group than in the non-HAI
group. The rate of poor differentiation was significantly
higher in the HAI group than in the non-HAI group.
However, there were no significant differences between the

HAI and non-HAI groups with respect to any other variable. The surgical parameters including operative procedure, operative duration, and blood infusion rates, were
comparable between the two groups.
Compliance and side effects of chemotherapy
and hepatic resection
A total of 35 patients (92 %) completed HAI after hepatic
resection. The side effects of adjuvant HAI (according to
CTCAE v4.0) are shown in Table 3 .HAI was stopped
because of tumor recurrence, grade 4 neutropenia, and
therapy refusal in one patient each. No lethal side effects of
HAI were observed. Five patients (13 %) experienced
grade 3/4 adverse events. Three patients had grade 3
vomiting, and three had severe neutropenia (one with grade
4, two with grade 3). One patient (4.1 %) developed a
hepatic arterial occlusion caused by the implanted catheter.
Among all 73 patients, postoperative complications
occurred in 21 (28.7 %): significant pleural effusion or
ascites in 7, bile leakage in 3, surgical-site infection in 3,
liver failure in 2, abdominal abscess in 2, intraabdominal
bleeding in 1, duodenal ulcer in 1, wound dehiscence in 1,
and cholangitis in 1.
Tumor recurrence
At a median follow-up of 25 months (range 3–149 months),
23 (60.5 %) and 29 (82.8 %) patients in the HAI and nonHAI groups, respectively, developed tumor recurrence. The
rate of recurrence in the remnant liver in the HAI group was
31.5 %, which was significantly lower than 68.5 % in the
non-HAI group (p = 0.001). Extrahepatic recurrence rates
were not significantly different between the two groups
(p = 0.360). In all, 45 patients—20 (52.6 %) in the HAI
group and 25 (71.4 %) in the non-HAI group—developed
recurrence within 2 years after hepatic resection, but the
recurrence rates within 2 years were similar between the two
groups (p = 0.098).
Disease-free and overall survival
There was no significant difference in recurrence or survival
rates between the patients who received HAI according to the
old (n = 25) and new (n = 13) protocols: 3-year diseasefree survival (DFS) 55.0 % vs. 50.0 %; 3-year overall survival (OS), 53.0 % vs. 54.2 %). Both the 3- and 5-year DFS
rates were 33.1 % for patients treated with HAI and 11.8 %
for patients in the non-HAI group. The HAI group achieved
significantly better outcomes than the non-HAI group
(p = 0.029) (Fig. 1a). The 3- and 5-year OS rates were
56.2 % and 46.7 % in the HAI group and 37.4 % and 32.7 %
in the non-HAI group, respectively (p = 0.318) (Fig. 1b).
Univariate analysis for DFS and OS was performed for the
73 patients with macroscopic vascular invasion. Tumor size,
number of tumors, International Union Against Cancer stage
(UICC, 7th edition), and HAI were recognized as potential
prognostic factors for DFS (Table 4). AFP, tumor size, and
the degree of vascular invasion were recognized as potential
prognostic factors for OS (Table 5). Multivariate analysis
revealed that the number of tumors [hazard ratio (HR) and
95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.246 (1.158–4.359)] and
HAI [HR and 95 % CI): 0.536 (0.306–0.940)] were

independent factors for DFS (Table 6). Only tumor size of
C60 mm was an independent prognostic factor for OS in the
multivariate analysis ratio [HR and 95 % CI: 2.296
(1.106–4.767); p = 0.025].
On the other hand, among the limited patients with Vp3/4
or Vv3 (n = 32), the 3-year DFS and OS rates were 33.7 %
and 56.8 % in the HAI group and 8.3 % and 12.0 % in the
non-HAI group, respectively (Fig. 2). The HAI group had
significantly better DFS and OS than the non-HAI group
(p = 0.023 and 0.049, respectively). However, among
patients with Vp2 or Vv2, the 3-year DFS and OS rates were
32.6 % and 57.0 % in the HAI group and 13.7 % and 52.0 %
in the non-HAI group, respectively. There were no significant differences between these two groups.

relatively favorable 5-year survival rates (4.0–28.5 %) and
median survival times (6–14 months), the recurrence rates
are extremely high [20–24]. Portal venous invasion is the
most significant risk factor for the early postoperative
recurrence of HCC [25]. Therefore, other novel strategies
to prevent recurrence are required. At present, combined
treatment consisting of hepatic resection and TACE or HAI
shows the most promising results. The 5-year survival rate
and median survival time for TACE followed by hepatic
resection are 42 % and 31 months, respectively [26]. For
hepatic resection followed by HAI, these numbers are
36 % and 22 months. respectively [11].
Accordingly, in 1997 we initially started the protocol of
arterial infusion of cisplatin (total 150 mg) followed by
5-FU (total 3750 mg). The rationale behind this treatment
regimen is that cisplatin and 5-FU have an antitumor effect.
Moreover, cisplatin has a synergistic effect as a modulator
for 5-FU, and cisplatin and 5-FU can be administered at
low doses to reduce adverse reactions. The treatment
duration of our protocol—three courses of low-dose cisplatin plus 5-FU—is shorter than that reported in the literature. However, it may be sufficient to reduce the risk of
recurrence because of the favorable prognosis of our
treatment. The 3-year DFS and OS were 55.0 % and
53.0 %, respectively, which are comparable to those
reported in the literature [27–29]. Nevertheless, one patient
developed hepatic arterial occlusion caused by the
implanted catheter.
Based on this experience, in 2007 we initiated a new
protocol without an injection port: two rounds of one-shot
HAI consisting of cisplatin (60 mg/mm2 per 10 min), 5-FU
(60 mg/mm2 per 10 min) followed by mitomycin-C (3 mg/
mm2
) with DSM. In the new protocol, we used arterial
administration using DSM and mitomycin-C. DSM is a
micro-embolic material made from potato starch,
45 ± 7 9 10-6 mm in diameter, that induces transient
occlusion of small arteries for 1 h [30]. Co-administration
of an anticancer drug with DSM reduces drug dilution
because of hepatic arterial flow and enhances drug retention in tumors better than with a single bolus injection [30].
We adopted DSM rather than permanent embolic materials
to decrease the damage to the remnant liver during the
early postoperative period (4–8 weeks after surgery).
A retrospective case–control study of 127 HCC patients
demonstrated that adjuvant chemolipiodolization following
hepatic resection is an independent prognostic factor for
2-year recurrence-free survival [HR and 95 % CI: 0.55
(0.34–0.90); p = 0.02] compared to hepatic resection alone
[3]. However, the ratio of vascular involvement patients in
that study was only 19 % [3]. In a randomized controlled
manner, 126 HCC patients with PVTT were divided into
control and TACE groups [27]. The control group underwent surgery and PVTT removal, and the TACE group
underwent the same procedure combined with postoperative adjuvant TACE. The median survival time of
13 months and a 5-year survival rate of 21.5 % in the
TACE group were significantly greater than the corresponding values of 9 months and 8.5 % in the control
group [27]. The treatment was started 3 to 4 weeks after
surgery and was repeated once every 1 to 2 months for two
to five courses (mean 1.8). This postoperative adjuvant
TACE resulted in significantly greater OS. The starting
point and total course of adjuvant therapy were similar to
those of our new protocol during the late period (beginning
at 4 weeks for a total of two courses).
Despite the greater number of patients with poorly differentiated HCCs, which is associated with an extremely
high recurrence rate [31], the HAI group exhibited significantly better DFS than the non-HAI group. Furthermore,
multivariate analysis revealed that the application of HAI is
an independent favorable prognostic factor for DFS
(Fig. 1a, Table 6). On the other hand, analysis of all
patients revealed comparable extrahepatic recurrence rates
in the two groups and that HAI was not a favorable
prognostic factor for OS. Therefore, some systemic chemotherapy in addition to the HAI therapy might be
required to reduce the risk of extrahepatic recurrence,
ultimately increasing the OS. Because intrahepatic metastases after hepatic resection are reported to occur usually
within 2 years postoperatively [32, 33] and PVTT often
causes extensive intrahepatic metastasis of the tumor
through the portal tract, the primary objective of adjuvant
HAI is to reduce the risk of intrahepatic metastasis via the
portal vein rather than multicentric recurrence [34]. Our
results did not indicate any obvious differences between
the two groups with respect to the recurrence rate within
2 years. However, the overall recurrence rate of the remnant liver in the HAI group was 31.5 %, which was significantly lower than the 68.5 % in the non-HAI group
(p = 0.001).
In our analysis, the HAI group demonstrated significantly better DFS and OS than the non-HAI group in the
limited Vp3/4 or Vv3 patients (Fig. 2) but not in the Vp2 or
Vv2 patients. There is little information regarding recurrence or long-term survival with respect to the degree of
tumor thrombi. Vp2 or Vv2 patients may not have widespread dissemination of tumor cells via the portal or
hepatic vein. Furthermore, the extent of resected liver is
limited, and the removal of tumor thrombi is easier and
more complete than in Vp3/4 and Vv3 patients. In fact,
operating time, blood loss, and the frequency of blood
transfusion were significantly smaller in Vp2 and Vv2
patients (data not shown).
PVTT with multinodular or diffuse recurrence (i.e.,
intrahepatic dissemination) of HCC after thermal ablation
is one of the most serious problems resulting in a poor

prognosis [10]. In this study, seven patients exhibited this
recurrence pattern according to the histopathologic examinations of the resected specimens, and five patients
underwent adjuvant HAI. The 5-year OS and DFS rates of
these five patients were 80 % and 40 %, respectively,
suggesting that hepatic resection followed by adjuvant HAI
is also useful for PVTT with intrahepatic dissemination if
the recurrence site is localized in the liver.
We applied mono- or bi-sectionectomy or (extended)
hemi-hepatectomy in 42 (93.3 %) HCC patients with grade
Vp2 or Vv2. Tumor thrombi might be completely removed
by performing surgery alone in such cases. Among the nine
patients with Vp3/4 (32.1 %), we applied the peeling-off
technique for those with massive PVTTs beyond the
bifurcation or into other sectors. This method is reported to
have no disadvantages regarding curability compared to an
en bloc technique [15]. The favorable 3-year DFS (32.4 %)
and OS (58.3 %) rates of these nine patients may demonstrate the efficacy of the peeling-off technique for patients
with grade Vp3/4.
Multivariate analysis revealed that adjuvant HAI was
one of the independent favorable prognostic factors for
DFS. However, the main limitation of this study is that it
was not a randomized prospective study. Therefore, some
confounders might have affected the results. The patients
diagnosed with early recurrence (within 1 month) were
analyzed as the non-HAI group because we aimed to
investigate the advantages of adjuvant HAI in patients with
resectable HCC and if HAI could be completed within 1 to
2 months. However, with the entry criteria used for the
non-HAI group (early recurrence, advanced age, co-morbidities, poor performance), there is clearly a selection bias
with less favorable prognostic factors in these patients.
Conclusions
Adjuvant HAI for HCC patients with macroscopic vascular
invasion, especially patients with Vp3/4 or Vv3, might
reduce the risk of recurrence without serious complications. However, a prospective randomized study is required
to confirm our findings.
