Abstract
Objectives: To investigate whether T-cell activation and exhaustion is linked to HCV- and HIV disease parameters in HIV/
HCV infected individuals, we studied T-cell characteristics in HIV/HCV coinfected patients and controls.
Methods: 14 HIV/HCV coinfected, 19 HCV monoinfected, 10 HIV monoinfected patients and 15 healthy controls were
included in this cross-sectional study. Differences in expression of activation and exhaustion markers (HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1,
Tim-3 and Fas) and phenotypic markers on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were analysed by flow cytometry and were related to HCV
disease parameters (HCV-viremia, ALT and liver fibrosis).
Results: Frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were higher in HIV/HCV-coinfected compared to healthy controls
and HCV or HIV mono-infected individuals. Coinfected patients also showed high expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1
and death receptor Fas. In contrast, the exhaustion marker Tim-3 was only elevated in HIV-monoinfected patients. T-cell
activation and exhaustion were correlated with HCV-RNA, suggesting that viral antigen influences T-cell activation and
exhaustion. Interestingly, increased percentages of effector CD8+ T-cells were found in patients with severe (F3–F4) liver
fibrosis compared to those with no to minimal fibrosis (F0–F2).
Conclusions: HIV/HCV coinfected patients display a high level of T-cell activation and exhaustion in the peripheral blood.
Our data suggest that T-cell activation and exhaustion are influenced by the level of HCV viremia. Furthermore, high
percentages of cytotoxic/effector CD8+ T-cells are associated with liver fibrosis in both HCV monoinfected and HIV/HCV
coinfected patients.

Introduction
Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
relatively common in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients
because of shared routes of viral transmission. [1] HIV/HCVcoinfection is associated with an accelerated course of HCV
disease progression and increased HCV viral loads compared to
HCV-monoinfection, even when HIV is effectively treated.[1–3]
Several factors may contribute to this poor prognosis in coinfected
patients. Reduced HCV-specific T cell responses have been
demonstrated in coinfected patients in the chronic stage of HCV
infection, but these studies were limited by either analyzing data of
interferon-c producing cells only [4] or by describing a rather
heterogeneous study population including untreated HIV as well
as patients on antiretroviral treatment.[4–6] A recent study,
investigating the production of interferon-c (IFN-c) and tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), found similar HCV-specific T-cell
responses in HIV-HCV co-infected patients on antiretroviral
treatment compared to HCV monoinfected individuals. [7] Other
factors possibly contributing to disease progression in HIV/HCVcoinfection include reduced CD4+ T-cell help in elimination of
infected hepatocytes and direct or indirect cytopathic effects of
HIV. [8] Increased immune activation has also been proposed as
one of the underlying mechanisms of poor clinical outcome of
HCV infection in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. [9].
Next to generalised T cell activation, chronic viral infection is
associated with loss of effector and proliferative functions of CD8+
T cells, leading to ineffective viral control. [10] Among other
markers of this so-called immune exhaustion, an important
function of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) has been
reported in both HIV and HCV infection and blockage of PD-1
has proved to restore immune function in chronic infection.[10–
12] Furthermore, dual expression of exhaustion markers Tim-3
and PD-1 on HCV-specific T cells was shown to be correlated
with disease progression in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. [13].
We have previously shown increased expression of the death
receptor Fas (CD95) on peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in
chronic HCV infected patients. [14] This could be a sign of

immune activation in these patients similar to the observations of
increased immune activation in HIV-patients on effective
HAART. [15,16] However, little is known about the additive
effect of co-infection with HCV on immune activation in HIVinfected individuals on HAART. A few studies have examined Tcell activation and exhaustion in HIV/HCV co-infection, most of
them either lacking a HIV-positive control group or being
performed on frozen samples. [5,17,18] To study the contributions
of HIV and HCV on T cell activation and exhaustion, we used
freshly obtained blood to characterize T-cell phenotypes, activation and exhaustion in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared
to control groups of healthy individuals, HCV-monoinfected and
HIV-monoinfected patients. Additionally, we investigated correlations of T-cell phenotype with HCV disease parameters including
stage of liver fibrosis, level of HCV viremia, level of alanine
transaminase (ALT) to unravel the contributions of these factors to
immune activation.
In the present study we demonstrate that T cell activation and
exhaustion are increased in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection
compared to control groups. In addition, T-cell activation and
exhaustion are correlated with the level of HCV-RNA, suggesting
that viral antigen drives T cell activation and exhaustion.
Methods
Ethics Statement
Informed consent was obtained in writing from all patients in
accordance with the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and in
accordance with the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice
(6th revision, 2008). The medical ethics committee for research in
humans (METC) of the University Medical Center Utrecht, The
Netherlands, approved the protocol of this study.
Patients
A total of 58 subjects, including 19 chronic HCV monoinfected
patients, 10 HIV-1 monoinfected patients, 14 HIV/HCV
coinfected patients and 15 healthy controls were included in this
study. All patients were recruited from the Infectious Diseases
outpatient clinic or from the Gastroenterology outpatient clinic of
the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU). All patients were
negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). None of the
patients received treatment for HCV at the time of inclusion or
within 12 months before. All HIV-infected patients were on highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), resulting in CD4-counts
.200/mL and undetectable HIV viral load (,50 copies/mL).
Patients with other diseases possibly interfering with their immune
system (e.g. liver disease from non-viral causes, auto-immune
disease, malignity or any other severe systemic diseases) were
excluded from the study, as well as patients with known prior or
present alcohol abuse. In the HCV-monoinfected and the HIV/
HCV-coinfected group, liver fibrosis was assessed using transient
elastography (FibroscanH (FS), www.echosens.com, Paris, France).
Classification of fibrosis was done using the METAVIR scoring
system with F0–F2 being no to mild fibrosis (cut-off ,9.5 kPa) and
METAVIR F3–F4 being sever fibrosis to cirrhosis (cut-off
.9.5 kPa). In patients with recent assessment of fibrosis by liver
biopsy (,1 year before inclusion), or known cirrhosis, no fibroscan
was required. Levels of HCV-RNA and HIV viral load were
measured with COBASH AmpliPrep/COBASH TaqMan Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR; lower limit of detection 15 IU/mL
for HCV and 50 copies/ml for HIV). Blood from anonymous
healthy controls was requested from the bloodbank Mini Donor
Dienst of the UMC Utrecht and was tested negative for hepatitis
B, hepatitis C and HIV. All patients and healthy controls were
between 18 and 65 years old.
Processing of Blood for Isolation of PBMCs and Analysis
with Flow Cytometry
From all patients whole blood was collected by vena puncture in
sodium heparin tubes (approximately 27 mL) for PBMCs. Within
8 hours, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
isolated by standard density centrifugation using Ficoll Hypaque.
Per patient, 5 million freshly isolated PBMCs were washed twice
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and directly stained for
markers of T-cell phenotype, activation and exhaustion. The
following antibodies were used: anti-CD3 (label: V500; provided
by: BD horizon; clone: SP34-2), CD4 (eFluor780; eBioscience;
RPA-T4 and PE-Cy7; BioLegend; L3T4), CD8 (PB, BioLegend;
RPA-T8 and eFluor780; eBioscience; RPA-T8), CD27
(eFluor780; eBioscience; O323); CD38 (R-PE; Invitrogen;
HIT2); CD45RO (APC; BioLegend; UCHL1); CD95 (APC; BP
Pharmigen; DX2); PD-1 (PerCP/Cy5.5; BioLegend; EH12.2H7);
Tim3 (PE, BioLegend; F38-2E2). Cells were incubated with the
antibodies for 20 minutes at 4uC. After washing with PBS/0.5%
bovine serum albumin, cells were fixed with Cellfix (BD) and
directly analysed by flow cytometry. As an additional marker for
effector T-cells, we analysed intracellular perforin expression. To
this end, freshly isolated PBMCs were, directly after staining of
surface markers, permeabilized and lysed (FACS permeabilizing
solution 2 and FACS lysis solution; BD). After permeabilization,
cells were incubated with anti-perforin (FITC; dG9; BD). After
washing, cells were fixed with Cellfix (BD) and directly analysed on
an LSR II FACS machine (BD). Per sample, 100.000 events were
acquired. This resulted in exclusion of 2 healthy controls, 4 HCVmonoinfected and 2 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients for the
perforin-staining.
Statistical Analysis
Medians were compared with Mann Whitney test or, in case of
multiple groups, with one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test. Two-way ANOVA was used for
comparing medians with two independent variables. Fisher’s
exact tests were used to test relation of categorical variables.
Dependence of variables was tested using Spearman’s one-tailed
correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM
SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM) and GraphPad
Prism 5 for Windows version 5.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc).
Results
Patient Characteristics
Peripheral blood was drawn from a total of 58 subjects,
consisting of 14 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, 19 HCV-monoinfected patients, 10 HIV-monoinfected patients and 15 uninfected healthy controls. Characteristics of the different patient
groups are shown in table 1. None of the patients received
treatment for HCV at the time of inclusion. However, eight out of
nineteen HCV monoinfected patients (42%) and three out of
thirteen HIV/HCV coinfected patients (21%) had a history of
ineffective HCV treatment more than 1 year before inclusion,
while all others were treatment-naı¨ve (p = 0.07). All HIV-infected
patients (both monoinfected and HCV-coinfected) were on
HAART at the time of this study, resulting in CD4+ T-cell counts
above 200 cells/mm3 and HIV-RNA ,50 copies/mL. Median
duration of HAART was 8 years in the monoinfected and 13 years
in the coinfected group (p = 0.35). As expected, the ALT value was
lower in HIV mono-infected patients (30 IU/L) compared to the
T-Cell Activation and Exhaustion in HIV/HCV

HCV-infected patients (65 IU/L; p,0.05), but ALT levels were
similar between HIV/HCV coinfected (65 IU/L) and HCV
monoinfected patients (69 IU/L; p = 0.92). There was a trend
towards higher level of HCV-viremia in coinfected patients (1.9e6
IU/mL) compared to HCV monoinfected patients (4.5e5 IU/mL;
p = 0.07) (table 1).
HIV/HCV Coinfection is Associated with Increased T-cell
Activation and PD-1 Expression
To study T-cell activation and exhaustion in HIV/HCVcoinfected patients, we measured expression of activation markers
CD38 and HLA-DR [19], exhaustion markers Programmed
Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and
mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and death receptor Fas (CD95) in
coinfected patients, HIV- or HCV-monoinfected patients and
uninfected healthy controls. Gating strategy and representative
plots of a healthy control, HCV-monoinfected, HIV-monoinfected
and HIV/HCV-coinfected patient are shown in figure 1A–E.
Frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, defined by
CD38/HLA-DR double positivity, were higher in HIV/HCVcoinfected patients (median 1.9% and 5.6% respectively) compared to healthy controls (medians 0.8%; p,0.001 and 1.7%;
p,0.01). Coinfected patients also displayed higher CD4+ T-cell
activation (1.9%) in comparison to HCV- or HIV-monoinfected
patients (1.4%, p,0.01 and 1.2%, p,0.01) (Fig. 2A). Expression
of the T-cell exhaustion marker PD-1 was higher on CD4+ T-cells
of coinfected patients (13.2%) in comparison with HIV-monoinfected patients (7.8%; p,0.05) and healthy controls (5.5%;
p,0.001). A similar pattern of PD-1 expression was observed in
CD8+ T cells (HIV/HCV: 13.3%, healthy controls: 8.1%, HCV:
10.3%, HIV 9.5%; not significant) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Tim-3
expression was not significantly increased in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. In contrast, HIV-monoinfected patients depicted
significantly higher levels of Tim3 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(1.9% and 2.8%) compared to HIV/HCV coinfected patients
(0.8%; p,0.05 and 1.1%; p,0.01) and healthy controls (0.6%;
p,0.01 and 0.6%; p,0.001) (fig 2C). Numbers of PD-1 and Tim3 dual positive T cells were too low for reliable analysis.
Furthermore, with high activation and exhaustion in HIV/
HCV coinfected patients compared to healthy controls, a higher
susceptibility to apoptosis was expected. [20] Indeed, expression of
the death receptor Fas on CD4+ T-cells of coinfected patients
(median 71%) was significantly increased compared to healthy
controls (40%, p,0.001) and HIV-infected controls (60%;
p,0.05). However, in coinfected patients Fas-expression on
CD4+ T-cells (71%) did not differ in comparison to HCV
monoinfected controls (63%). On CD8+ T-cells, there were no
significant differences of Fas expression in coinfected patients
(36%) compared to HCV or HIV monoinfected patients (31% and
43%) or healthy controls (16%) (Fig. 2B).
T-cell Activation and Exhaustion are Linked to Level of
HCV-RNA in HIV-HCV Co-infection
To elucidate which clinical parameters may contribute to T-cell
activation and exhaustion, we investigated correlations of ALT
and HCV viremia with expression of HLA-DR/CD38, PD-1,
Tim-3, and Fas.
Within all HCV-infected patients, HCV-RNA correlated
positively with T cell activation (CD8: r = 0.37, p,0.05; CD4:
r = 0.28, p = 0.08) as well as with expression of the exhaustion

exhaustion as well as level of HCV-viremia were similar in patients
with F0–F2 fibrosis or F3–F4 fibrosis (table 2). Lastly, a history of
failed HCV-treatment was not associated with differences in T-cell
activation or exhaustion.
HCV and HIV are Associated with Differences in Memory
and Effector Phenotype of CD8+ T-cells
Chronic viral infections are shown to coincide with changes in
T-cell memory and effector phenotype. [21] Therefore, we
examined whether HIV/HCV-coinfection drives changes in
memory and effector phenotype of CD8+ T-cells, by studying
percentages of naı¨ve (CD45RO2CD27+
), central memory
(CD45RO+
CD27+), effector memory (CD45RO2CD27+) and
effector (CD45RO2CD272) CD8+ T-cells. Representative plots
of a healthy control, an HCV monoinfected patient and an HIV/
HCV coinfected patient are shown in figure 3A.
Mean percentages of T-cell phenotypes in patients compared to
healthy controls are depicted as pie graphs in figure 3B. Due to the
small percentages of effector T-cells, changes in these subsets are
more apparent when depicted as relative increase compared to
healthy controls (Fig. 3C). HIV/HCV coinfected patients showed
significantly higher frequencies of central memory CD8+ T-cells
compared to healthy controls (15.1% versus 11.8% p,0.05). The
increase of effector CD8+ T-cells was significant in HCV and HIV
monoinfection but not in HIV/HCV coinfection (Fig. 3B–C).
There was no correlation with levels of HCV-RNA or ALT with
memory and effector phenotype.
Liver Fibrosis is Associated with Increased Frequencies of
Effector CD8+ T-cells
As T-cell mediated killing of infected hepatocytes is essential in
liver fibrogenesis, [22] we investigated whether liver fibrosis was
associated with differences in T-cell effector phenotype. Indeed,
we found increased effector CD8+ T-cell frequencies in patients
with F3–F4 liver fibrosis in both HCV monoinfected patients
(median 41.3% versus 21.7% in patients with F0–F2 liver fibrosis)
and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (33.2% versus 25.0%; p,0.01)
(Fig. 3D). This finding was further confirmed by a positive
correlation of percentages effector CD8+ T cells with Fibroscanscore (r = 0,57; p = 0.0019) (data not shown). Additional analysis of
intracellular perforin expression within CD8+ T-cells, as an
indicator of effector T-cells with a potency to kill, revealed slightly
higher frequencies of perforin-positive CD8+ T-cells in mono- and
coinfected patients with severe fibrosis, albeit not significant
(p = 0.54; data not shown). However, frequencies of perforinpositive CD8+ T-cells correlated strongly with effector phenotype
(r = 0.48; p,0.001; Fig. 3E). Altogether, these data suggest a role
for perforin-positive/effector phenotype CD8+ T-cells in liver
fibrosis.
Discussion
HIV/HCV-coinfection is associated with faster HCV disease
progression than HCV-monoinfection. [3] The underlying pathogenic mechanisms for poor clinical outcome in HCV/HIV
coinfection remain unclear although various mechanisms have
been suggested, including increased immune activation. [9,23]
The present study confirms that HIV/HCV coinfected patients on
HAART indeed have higher levels of T-cell activation as indicated
by CD38/HLA-DR expression. In addition, we show that these Tcells are also high in expression of PD-1 and Fas, both linked to Tcell exhaustion and apoptosis. [24,25] Furthermore, this study
shows correlations of concentration between HCV-RNA and
markers for T-cell activation and exhaustion, suggesting a role for
HCV viremia in influencing T-cell activation and exhaustion in
this group of patients.
Recently, it has become clear that HIV-infected patients on
antiretroviral treatment still display slightly increased T-cell
activation, [26,27] despite its initial decrease upon start of
antiretroviral treatment. [28] Interestingly, we observed higher
T-cell activation in HIV/HCV coinfected patients compared to
HIV-monoinfected patients despite longer history of HAART in
coinfected patients. [29] Various underlying mechanisms contributing to T-cell activation in those patients have been proposed in
literature, of which the concept of microbial translocation is
a currently widely accepted model. [16] As we show that the level
of T-cell activation correlates with HCV-RNA, we hypothesize
that this concomitant viral infection may well contribute to the
observed increase of T-cell activation in HIV-infected individuals.
Indeed, in a cohort of HCV monoinfected patients [30] we have
previously observed a decrease in CD4 and CD8+ T cell activation
after 4 weeks of IFN-a/ribavirin treatment in the subset of patients
with rapid viral response (HCV-RNA ,50 IU/mL at week 4 of
therapy), whereas there was no change in T cell activation in
patients without rapid viral response (unpublished data). Since
immune activation is thought to play an important role in longterm morbidity and mortality, [31] it can be hypothesized that
coinfection with HCV may contribute to long-term extrahepatic
morbidity in HIV-infected individuals through increased immune
activation. Indeed, a recent study observed a higher prevalence of
subclinical carotid plaque formation in HIV-patients coinfected
with HCV compared to HIV-monoinfected patients. [32]
However, a prospective study is required to examine whether
increased peripheral T-cell activation in HCV-monoinfected and
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is indeed associated with mortality
and long-term morbidity.

T-Cell Activation and Exhaustion in HIV/HCV
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e59302

In this study, T cell exhaustion, measured by PD-1 expression,
correlated with HCV-RNA in HCV monoinfected and HIV/
HCV coinfected patients. This is in line with a rather old study
showing a correlation between HCV viral load and decreased T
cell function in HCV-monoinfection, but at that time a role for
PD-1 was in T cell exhaustion was not yet discovered. [33] Thus,
to our knowledge, we are the first to show increased T cell
exhaustion indicated by PD-1 expression is linked to HCV
viremia. Based on a study evaluating T cell exhaustion upon
LCMV-infection in C57BL/6 mice, [34] it can be hypothesised
that high level of viremia contributes to increased exhaustion,
although it can also be reasoned that T cell exhaustion by itself
may lead to higher antigen levels through decreased viral control.
[11] In contrast, Tim-3 was lower in HIV-HCV coinfected
patients compared to HIV-monoinfected controls. This finding is
supported by data from a recent study by Vali et al., in which Tim3/PD-1 on total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell pools were highest in
HIV-monoinfected patients in comparison with HIV-HCV
coinfected and HCV monoinfected patients. [13] Although not
significant, our data support the observation by Vali et al. that Tim3 expression is increased in HCV-infected patients in comparison
to healthy controls. [13] It must be noted that age and gender of
healthy volunteers were not characterised do to the anonymous
service of the blood bank.
One possible explanation for decreased Tim-3 expression in
HIV-HCV coinfected patients compared to HIV-monoinfected
patients could be decreased activity of T-bet, a transcription factor
classically associated with Th1 phenotype [35] but recently also

T-Cell Activation and Exhaustion in HIV/HCV

shown to induce Tim-3 and repress PD-1 expression. [36,37]
Persistent antigen exposure was shown to lead to downregulation
of T-bet. [37] This suggests that downregulation of T-bet due to
persistent HCV antigen may be involved in decreased Tim-3
expression and increased PD-1 expression, as we observed in the
present study, next to decreased Th1/Th2 ratio, observed by
others, [38] associated with coinfection of HCV in HAARTtreated HIV patients.
A second interesting observation in our cross-sectional study is
the high level of effector CD8+ T-cells in HCV monoinfected and
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with severe fibrosis. Few other
studies investigate changes of memory and effector T-cell memory
and effector compartments in HIV/HCV-coinfection.
[5,17,18,39] However, these studies did not compare to HCVor HIV mono-infected controls or were heterogeneous in terms of
HIV treatment, including both patients treated with HAART and
patients with untreated HIV, [5,17,18,39] which may result in
HIV-antigen driven differences in memory and effector phenotype. To our knowledge, no studies relating these T-cell
phenotypes to fibrosis progression have been published. Our data
suggests that effector T-cells might play a role in liver fibrosis since
it has been shown that similar T-cell populations are present in
blood as well as in the liver of HCV infected patients. [40] Killing
of infected hepatocytes by intrahepatic cytotoxic T-cells may be
perforin-dependent [41] and apoptosis of hepatocytes has a strong
profibrotic effect through activation of hepatic stellate cells. [42]
We therefore postulate that high frequencies of effector CD8+ Tcells may contribute to liver fibrosis by killing infected hepatocytes
which in turn activate hepatic stellate cells and promote
fibrogenesis. Alternatively, it may be hypothesized that increased
percentages in the peripheral blood would reflect an actual
decrease at the site of infection due to compartmentalization.
However, it has recently been shown that CD27 expression by
intrahepatic lymphocytes is reflected by CD27 expression in the
peripheral blood. [43] Examination of effector T cell phenotypes
in liver biopsies in patients with minimal or severe fibrosis are
needed to provide a definite conclusion.
The design of the present study was distinctive for several
reasons. First, all stainings for activation and exhaustion markers
were performed on freshly isolated PBMCs, thereby eliminating
any influence of cryopreservation on expression of activation and
exhaustion markers and T-cell phenotype which hampers other
studies. [44,45]. Albeit our sample size is somewhat smaller than
other studies, we believe that our data closely reflect the actual
phenotype of T-cells in the peripheral blood. Furthermore,
patients with no or minimal fibrosis as well as patients with severe
fibrosis were included enabling us to investigate whether
phenotypic differences are correlated to HCV disease progression.
The HIV-infected groups were homogenous, including only
patients on successful antiretroviral therapy (HIV not detectable,
CD4.200). The frequency of HCV treatment experienced
patients was higher in the HCV-monoinfected group in comparison to the HIV/HCV-coinfected group, but a minimum of 1 year
interferon free period was required before inclusion and no late
effects of interferon are known from literature.
The present study is hampered by the fact that we did not
investigate antigen-specific T-cells, we cannot be sure whether our
findings with respect to T-cell memory subsets, activation and
exhaustion are directly influencing HCV-specific T-cell responses.
However, various previous studies have convincingly proved that
PD-1 and Tim-3 expression suppress HCV-specific immune
responses and thereby contribute to viral persistence in HCV.
[46] Furthermore, liver infiltrates are largely composed of HCVnonspecific T cells, suggesting that disease progression may well be
affected by non-specific activation. [40,47,48].
From the present study we conclude that T-cells in HIV/HCVcoinfected patients show increased activation and exhaustion
surface markers compared to healthy controls as well as to HIV- or
HCV (co)infected patients. This suggests that HIV and HCV have
a complementary role on T-cell activation in HIV/HCV
coinfection. This could at least partly be explained by the level
of antigen, since T cell activation and exhaustion correlated with
the level of HCV viremia. Furthermore, liver fibrosis is associated
with increased frequencies of effector CD8+ T-cells, based on
extracellular surface markers and intracellular perforin expression,
suggesting that these effector CD8+ T-cells may contribute to liver
fibrosis in a perforin dependent manner.
