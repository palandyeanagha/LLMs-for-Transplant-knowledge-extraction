Abstract
Background: Bone is one of the major target tissues for Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I). Low doses of IGF-I were
able to improve liver-associated osteopenia. In the present work, a model of partial IGF-I deficiency was used in
order to provide insight into the mechanisms of the beneficial actions of IGF-I replacement therapy in bone.
Methods: Several proteins involved in osteoblastic/osteocyte and osteoclastic differentiation and activity were
studied in the three experimental groups: control (CO) group (wild type mice, Igf +/+, n = 10), heterozygous
Igf +/− group with partial IGF-I deficiency (Hz, n = 10), and heterozygous Igf +/− mice treated with IGF-I for 10 days
(Hz + IGF-I, n = 10).
Results: Data in this paper confirm that the simple partial IGF-I deficiency is responsible for osteopenia, determined
by densitometry and histopathology. These findings are associated with a reduced gene expression of
osteoprotegerin, sclerostin, calcitonin receptor (CTR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 and RUNX2. IGF-I
replacement therapy normalized CTR gene expression and reduced markers of osteoclastic activity.
Conclusions: Low doses of IGF-I constituted a real replacement therapy that normalized IGF-I serum levels
improving the expression of most of these proteins closely involved in bone-forming, and reducing bone
resorption by mechanisms related to osteoprotegerin, RANKL and PTH receptor.

Background
Bone is one of the major target organs for insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I) [1-4], an anabolic hormone
produced mainly by the liver upon growth hormone
(GH) stimulation [5-7]. Liver cirrhosis is associated
with osteopenia and low levels of IGF-I [8-10], constituting a well established condition of IGF-I deficiency
[11,12]. In advanced liver cirrhosis, IGF-I serum levels
decrease as a result of diminished hepatocellular biosynthetic function and progressive loss of GH receptors on hepatocytes [13,14].
However, the pathogenesis of osteopenia in liver cirrhosis is not fully understood, although malabsorption,
malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, reduced levels of sexual
hormones and alcohol toxicity appear to be some of the
factors involved in altered bone metabolism [15-19].
Several years ago, our team showed that low doses of
IGF-I were able to correct osteopenia associated to experimental cirrhosis [20], suggesting a role for IGF-I deficiency
in the genesis of osteopenia and the possible therapeutic
effect of IGF-I in this condition. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the beneficial actions of IGF-I replacement therapy on bone are not entirely known yet.
In order to gain more insight into the mechanisms
underlying the osteopenia related to low levels of IGF-I,
we appealed to an animal model of “IGF-I partial deficiency” recently characterized and proposed as a more

suitable animal model to mimic recognizable syndromes
associated to human conditions of IGF-I deficiency [21].
Three experimental groups were included in the present
study: control (CO) group (wild type mice Igf +/+ treated
with vehicle for 10 days), Hz (heterozygous group, Igf +/−
mice with partial IGF-I deficiency treated with vehicle for
10 days) and Hz + IGF-I group (heterozygous Igf +/− mice
treated with 2 μg/100 g body weight/day, for 10 days).
The aim of the present work was to study the effect
of low doses of IGF-I on bone in this animal model, by
determining the following parameters: 1) bone weight,
morphometry, densitometry and cortical thickness in
histological preparations; 2) gene expression of IGF-I, and
GH and IGF-I receptors in bone; 3) gene and protein
expression of key molecules involved in osteocyte or osteoblastic differentiation and activity, such as osteoprotegerin
(OPG), sclerostin (SOST), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5), runt-related transcription factor 2
(RUNX2), calcitonin receptor (CTR) [22-25]; 4) gene and
protein expressions related to osteoclastic activity or inhibition, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4
(IGFBP-4), parathormone receptor-1 (PTHR1), receptor
activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) [26-30]. In
addition, both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels as well as
serum parameters of osteoblastic or osteoclastic activities
were also assessed in the three experimental groups.
Methods
Animals and experimental design
Experimental model was established and characterized as
previously reported [21]. Briefly, IGF-I heterozygous mice
were obtained by crossing transgenic mice, line 129SV and
Igf1tm1Arge [31]. Animals were housed in cages placed
in a room with a 12 hours light/12 hours dark cycle, and
constant humidity (50-55%) and temperature (20–22°C).
Food (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, Harlan
Laboratories, Spain) and water were given ad libitum.
All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with The Guiding Principles for Research Involving
Animals and approved by the Bioethical Committee from
the University CEU San Pablo (Madrid, Spain).
For genotyping of mice by PCR analysis (Applied
Biosystems, 2720 Thermal Cycler, Spain), DNA was extracted from a piece of tail and specific primers were used
to identify both Igf1 and Neo genes (Extract-N-Amp TM
Tissue PCR KIT, Sigma, USA).
Three groups of male mice 20 days old were included
in the experimental protocol: control group of wild type
animals Igf +/+ (CO), Igf +/− animals with heterozygous IGFI expression (Hz), and Igf +/− animals with heterozygous
IGF-I expression, which were subcutaneously treated with
IGF-I (2 μg/100 g body weight/day, for 10 days). Both
control and heterozygote groups received vehicle (succinate
buffer, subcutaneously) in parallel, n = 10 each group.
On the 11st day (the day after the last IGF-I injection),
blood was obtained from submandibular vein and thereafter animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Femurs
and tibias were carefully dissected out and weighted
(Denver Instrument, Germany). Samples from right tibia
were processed for histological examination. Samples from
left femur were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid
N2 and stored at −80°C until analysis of gene expressions.
Densitometry and bone morphometric studies were performed in the right femur. Serum was stored at −20°C.
Analytical methods in serum
Alkaline phosphatase and glucose was determined in serum
by routine laboratory methods using an autoanalyzer
(Hitachi-Cobas Integra 400 plus, Roche Diagnostics, Spain).
Serum levels of Osteocalcine, Osteoprotegerin and Leptin
were assessed by Luminex (X-Map Technology), using
specific commercial assay systems following protocol
instructions (Millipore, USA). IGF-I (Mediagnost, Germany)
and IGFBP-3 (Bionova, Spain) levels were determined in
serum by ELISA.
Morphological, immunohistochemical and densitometry
parameters on bone
Cortical thickness and histopathological evaluation
Histopathological analyses were carried out in tibias,
which were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS
solution for 24 hours. Once they were properly fixed,
they were included in ethanol 70%. For demineralization,
it was used EDTA 5% in movement. Finally, the samples
were embedded in paraffin using the automatic equipment
(Leica TP 1020, Leica, Switzerland). Longitudinal sections
(4 μm-thick, Reichert-Jung 2030 Biocut Microtome, Leica,
Switzerland) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Morphometrical measurements (cortical thickness) were made
by two observers at three points of diaphysis from each
section using a light microscope (Leica, Switzerland). The
arithmetical mean was used as final measure.
Immunohistochemistry analyses and images processing
Immunohischemical studies were performed in order to
spatially localize the related molecules within the cortical
diaphysis. Samples were deparaffinized with HEMO-De
(Scientific Safety Slovents, USA) and rehydrated in ethanol
and PBS. Next, they were incubated with 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide (Merck, Spain) in PBS for 30 min for inhibition
of endogen peroxidase. Retrieval of antigen was induced
with pepsin (Zymed, USA). Consecutive sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with different rabbit antibodies:
rabbit Anti-IGF-I (1:50, Abcam, UK), rabbit Anti-IGF-IR
(1:50, Abcam, UK), mouse Anti-GHR (1:50, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA), rabbit Anti-RANKL (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA), rabbit Anti-RANKL (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), rabbit Anti-OPG (1:500,

Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), rabbit Anti-CTR (1:100,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), rabbit Anti-PTHR1
(1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), goat Anti-SOST
(1:20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), to analyzed the
osteoblatic and osteoclastic activity. After washing, slides
were incubated for twenty minutes at room temperature
with the biotin anti-rabbit/mouse complex (Histostain®-SP
Broad Spectrum, Zymed, USA), except those labeled with
SOST antibody that were developed with biotin anti goat
IgG (Abcam, UK). Then, staining was performed incubating
with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase conjugated for ten
minutes and diaminobenzidine (Sigma, USA), as chromogenic substrate for up to 5 minutes. Finally, samples stained
with hematoxilin and covered with DEPEX medium.
Digital images of tibia sections were captured using
Leica DFC345 FX® and a Leica DFC 425 camera (Leica,
Switzerland). Three regions per sample were measured
to evaluate immunohistochemical changes by using an
image analysis Software (Leica MMAF 1.4 MetaMorph),
which reported mean values of optical density (O.D.) for
each sample.
Morphological parameters and densitometry of bone
Femur length was measured from the major trochanter to
the end of the distal epiphysis. All measurements were
performed with a precision caliper, Vernier® (±0.005 mm).
Bone density from whole right femur was determined by
Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry using PIXIMus I equipment (Lunar, USA) and thus expressed as the amount of
mineralized tissue in the area scanned (g/cm2
).
Gene expression studies
Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and
quantitative real time (qPCR) PCRs
Left femur was cryopreserved in RNAlater (Qiagen-Izasa,
Spain) after extracting bone marrow by NaCl 0.9% perfusion of medullary cavity with a syringe to exclude any interference of these cells on the PCR results. Then, they were
homogenized with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, UK) by
Tissue Lyser LT (Qiagen-Izasa, Spain) and RNA was extracted and further purified using the QIAGEN RNeasy
Mini Kit including digestion with RNase-free DNase,
following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was
checked by the A260:A280 ratio and with the Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). Purified RNA was
then converted to cDNA by using the RNA-to-DNA EcoDryTM Premix (Clonetech Labs, USA) for qPCR assays.
Quantitative real time PCR assays were performed in
a 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems
Hispania, Spain).The thermal profile consisted on an
initial 5 min melting step at 95°C followed by 40 cycles
at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 60 s.
We used specific Taqman® probes for IGF-I
(Mm00439560_m1), IGFBP-4 (Mm00494922_m1), IGFBP-5
(Mm00516037_m1), GHR, (Mm004390093_m1), IGF-IR
(Mm00802831_m1), and gene expression related to
osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity such as, CTR
(Mm00432271_m1), SOST (Mm00470479_m1), PTHR1
(Mm00441046_m1), Runx2 (Mm00501584_m1), RANKL
(Mm 00441908_m1), and OPG (Mm00435452_m1), supplied by Applied Byosistems.
The relative mRNA levels of the genes of interest
were normalized to 18S expression using the simplified
comparative threshold cycle delta, cycle threshold
(CT) method [2-(ΔCT gene of interest - ΔCT 18S)].
Statistical analysis
All data represent mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed on SPSS 17 (Statistical Package for Social
Sciences, USA). Significance was estimated by the
U-Mann–Whitney test or, when appropriated, by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Correlation between IGF-I
and weight was analyzed by Spearman test. Differences
were considered significant at a level of p < 0.05.
Results
Normalization of IGF-I serum levels with low doses of
this hormone
Accordingly to previous data [21], heterozygous (Hz)
animals showed significantly lower levels of serum IGF-I
serum as compared to control group (Hz: 372.65 ± 23.52
vs CO: 891.93 ± 60.51 ng/mL, p < 0.01). Interestingly, low
doses of IGF-I were able to restore normal circulating levels
of IGF-I (Hz + IGF-I: 869.42 ± 101.22 ng/mL, p < 0.01),
p = n.s. vs CO, p < 0.01 vs Hz), acting as a real replacement therapy (Figure 1A).
In addition, IGF-I deficient animals (Hz) showed a significant lower IGFBP-3 serum levels (CO: 3,395.54 ± 298.78;
Hz: 1,498.22 ± 201.54 ng/mL, p < 0.05) that IGF-I therapy
normalized (Hz + IGF-I: 2,597.37 ± 389.05 ng/mL, p = n.s.
vs CO). A direct and significant correlation between IGF-I
and IGFBP-3 serum levels was found (Spearman Rho,
r = 0.735, p < 0.01): Figure 1B.
Of interest, these low doses of IGF-1 did not induce
hypoglycemia (CO: 151.14 ± 5.73 vs Hz + IGF-I: 143.82 ±
16.71, p = n.s.) or any other remarkable side effect.
Effects of IGF-I replacement therapy on body weight, and
bone morphometry and densitometry
In accordance with reported findings [21], a significant
diminution of body weight was found in animals with
partial IGF-I deficiency (Hz group) as compared to
control group. Interestingly, exogenous administration
of low doses of IGF-I were able to normalize body
weight in IGF-I deficient mice (data not shown). A significant and direct correlation between body weight and
IGF-I circulating levels was observed (r = 0.851, p < 0.01):
Figure 1C.

Table 1 (upper side) summarizes femur weight and
morphometric data. At the end of the study, femur
weight was reduced in IGF-I deficient animals as compared with controls, but not in those treated with IGF-I
(Hz + IGF-I, p = n.s. vs CO). Femur length, transversal
diameter and surface (mm2
) were reduced but did not
reach statistical significance as compared to controls.
However, IGF-I deficient group showed significantly
lower bone mineral density as compared with controls
(by 60%) (CO: 0.044 ± 0.005, Hz: 0.026 ± 0.001 g/cm2
,
p < 0.05), that IGF-I replacement therapy was able to
prevent to a significant extent (up to 88%) (0.039 ± 0.006,
p < 0.05 vs Hz) (see Figure 2A).
In addition, as it is showed in Figure 2B, cortical
bone thickness was significantly lower in IGF-I deficient animals as compared with controls (p < 0.05), and
IGF-I therapy induced a complete prevention of this
decrease (p < 0.05 vs Hz, p = n.s. vs CO).

Effects of IGF-I replacement therapy on serum parameters
Table 1 (lower side) also summarizes serum levels alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin and leptin.
Although no significant differences were found in any of
these serum parameters between the three experimental
groups, in this series of young mice (31 days old), trends
are consistent with reported results in the present study:
increases in osteoblastic activity and reductions in osteoclastic activation.
Gene expression of IGF-I, and GH and IGF-I receptors in bone
Accordingly to previous data [21], bone gene expression
of IGF-I was significantly reduced in animals with partial IGF-I deficiency (CO: 1.00 ± 0.13; Hz: 0.30 ± 0.15
relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 vs CO). The exogenous
administration of IGF-I did not modulate IGF-I gene
expression in these animals with systemic IGF-I gene
disruption (Hz + IGF-I: 0.50 ± 0.17 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 vs CO, p = n.s. vs Hz).

Gene expression of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in bone
showed similar values in control and Hz groups, (CO:
1.00 ± 0.40; Hz: 0.92 ± 0.55 relative mRNA expression).
However, IGF-I replacement therapy significantly reduced
this value (Hz + IGF-I: 0.37 ± 0.15 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 vs CO and Hz groups). Consistently, the
administration of IGF-I significantly reduced the protein
expression of IGF-IR (CO: 0.42 ± 0.09; Hz: 0.41 ± 0.06;
Hz + IGF-I: 0.31 ± 0.08 O.D., p < 0.05 vs CO and Hz groups).
On the other hand, both groups of IGF-I deficient
animals expressed significant lower levels of GHR gene
expression (Hz: 0.18 ± 0.09, Hz + IGF-I: 0.29 ± 0.12 relative
mRNA expression, p = n.s. Hz vs Hz + IGF-I) compared
to controls (CO: 1.00 ± 0.17 relative mRNA expression,
p < 0.05 CO vs both heterozygous groups).
Gene and protein expressions of molecules involved in
osteoblastic, osteocyte or osteoclastic differentiation
and activities
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is secreted by osteoblasts and
inhibits bone resorption reducing both osteoclastic differentiation and activity [32,33]. Partial IGF-I deficiency was
associated with a significant reduction of OPG gene expression (Figure 3A left panel) that the exogenous administration of IGF-I partially restored (CO: 1.00 ± 0.35, Hz:
0.13 ± 0.08, Hz + IGF-I: 0.38 ± 0.06 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 Hz vs CO, p < 0.05 Hz vs Hz + IGF-I, p = n.s.
CO vs Hz + IGF-I). Immunohistochemistry analyses of
OPG showed similar findings: Figure 3A (right panel).
In addition, sclerostin gene expression (SOST), the most
reliable marker of osteocytes, was significantly diminished
in Hz group as compared to control (CO: 1.00 ± 0.28, Hz:
0.19 ± 0.05 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05) and IGF-I
therapy normalized its expression (Hz + IGF-I: 0.84 ± 0.29
relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 vs Hz, p = n.s. vs CO).
Similar data were found in the immunohistochemistry
study of sclerostin: Figure 3B (right panel).
On the other hand, gene and protein expressions of calcitonin receptor, hormone that promotes osteoblastic activity
and bone mineralization [34], were significantly lower in Hz
group as compared to controls (see Figure 4A). Regarding
gene expression (left 4A panel), we observed significantly
lower levels in heterozygous group (CO: 1.00 ± 0.15, Hz:
0.56 ± 0.06 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 CO vs Hz),
while no significant differences were found between control
and heterozygous mice treated with IGF-I replacement
therapy (Hz + IGF-I: 1.06 ± 0.57 relative mRNA expression).
Consistently, immunohistochemistry analyses (right 4A
panel) showed that calcitonin receptor was significantly
decreased in untreated heterozygous group compared to
control animals (p < 0.05 CO vs Hz) whereas no statistical
differences were found in heterozygous treated mice.

a promoter of bone differentiation and formation [23].
Partial IGF-I deficiency was associated to a significant
reduction of RUNX2 gene expression (CO: 1.00 ± 0.28, Hz:
0.15 ± 0.07 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05) that
IGF-I therapy was able to correct partially (Hz + IGF-I:
0.35 ± 0.15 relative mRNA expression, p = n.s. vs control
group): Figure 4B.
In addition, as compared to controls, both IGF-I deficient
groups showed a lower expression of IGFBP-5, a binding
protein that promotes bone IGF-I activities [27,32,33,35],
that the exogenous administration of IGF-I did not
modulate (CO: 1.00 ± 0.23, Hz: 0,39 ± 0.15, Hz + IGF-I:
0.48 ± 0.13 relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 both groups
vs CO): Figure 4C.
Gene expression of RANKL in untreated heterozygous
group was increased as compared to control group (CO:
1.00 ± 0.42, Hz: 2.35 ± 1.40 relative mRNA expression).
IGF-I exogenous administration was able to reduce its expression (Hz + IGF-I: 0.29 ± 0.14 relative mRNA expression
(Figure 5A, left panel). Accordingly, protein expression
was significantly higher in partial IGF-1 deficient animals (p < 0.05) and the replacement therapy was able
to normalize it (p < 0.05 vs Hz group): Figure 5A.
Partial IGF-I deficiency was also associated to an increase
of PTH receptor (PTHR1), although without reaching
statistical significance (CO: 1.00 ± 0.30, Hz: 1.45 ± 0.50 relative mRNA expression). Interestingly, IGF-I replacement
therapy was able to reduce its gene (Hz + IGF-I: 0.55 ±
0.25 relative mRNA expression) and protein expressions
(see Figure 5B).
Finally, IGFBP-4 is an IGF-I binding protein that inhibits
IGF-I actions in bone [26]. In the present study, IGF-I deficient mice showed a tendency to decrease IGFBP-4 gene
expression in bone (CO: 1.00 ± 0.25, Hz: 0.65 ± 0.31 relative
mRNA expression), that IGF-I therapy made even greater
reaching statistical significance (Hz + IGF-I: 0.33 ± 0.05
relative mRNA expression, p < 0.05 vs CO): Figure 5C.
Discussion
In the last years, IGF-I treatment is being either tested in or
proposed for a wide range of pathological circumstances, as
Laron syndrome, chronic liver disease, intrauterine growth
restriction, insulin resistance and diabetes, neurological disorders (Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)
and stroke, cystic fibrosis, wound healing, burns, etc. [36-48].
However, in our opinion, only those states correlating with
low levels of IGF-I may benefit from a real replacement
therapy, thus avoiding potential adverse effects [49].
Data in this work provide evidences that the simple
partial IGF-I deficiency is associated with decreased
bone weight, cortical thickness and densitometry and
that these bone deficits can be corrected by a short-term
course of IGF-I at low doses, without hypoglycemia or
any other adverse effects.

This study fits in a series of works to elucidate the
mechanisms of the beneficial actions of IGF-I therapy in
liver cirrhosis [13,14,39,50-57], a condition of IGF-I
deficiency [11,12]. In cirrhotic patients, prevalence of
osteopenia is significantly higher than in age-matched
normal population [15]. Consequently, these patients
are exposed to an increased risk of bone fractures, which
are a source of morbidity in advanced stages of the disease
and after liver transplantation [15,58]. The pathogenesis of
osteopenia in chronic liver disease is not fully understood,
since many factors have been involved (malabsorption,
malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, reduced level of sexual
hormones or alcoholic toxicity) [15-20].
In order to distinguish the involvement of all these
factors, we resorted to an animal model of partial, and
systemic, IGF-I deficiency [21], where the mechanism
responsible for osteopenia has to be exclusively the
partial IGF-I deficiency. In this sense, for this protocol,
mice of 20 days old were chosen in order to study from
early ages the consequence of the single IGF-1 deficiency
on bone, since, as previously reported, the significant reduction of IGF-1 circulating levels are persistent along
the life in this experimental model [21].
First of all, in the animal model used in this work, IGF-I
serum levels and bone IGF-I gene expression were found
reduced in heterozygous mice associated to diminished
bone weights, densitometry values and cortical thickness
(see Table 1 and Figure 2B). These results demonstrated
that the only partial IGF-I deficiency is responsible for
osteopenia. These changes in bone are similar to those
previously described in rats with liver cirrhosis induced
by CCl4 exposure [20]. This conclusion about the role

of IGF-I in this bone disturbance is reinforced since IGF-I
replacement therapy (at the same doses used in cirrhotic
animals) is able to reverse it.
Previously, we described that the malnutrition occurring in cirrhotic rats had a greater impact on striated
muscle and fat than on bone [20]. Results in this work
confirm that the IGF-I deficiency seems to be a relevant
causal factor of osteopenia in cirrhosis by the decreased
biosynthetic capability of the liver.
On the one hand, results in this and previous studies
[20] suggest that osteopenia is the consequence of an
increase of bone resorption. In untreated cirrhotic rats a
significant increase in urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline cross-links indicated a enhanced bone resorption
and osteoclastic activity, that IGF-I replacement therapy
was able to normalize [20]. These findings were in agreement with in vitro studies using bone tissue cultures in
which IGF-I was reported to both inhibit osteoclasts and
interfere with osteoblast-derived factors that stimulate
existing osteoclasts [59]. However, in those days, the mechanisms responsible were not fully ascertained.
One of the most relevant findings in this manuscript is
the significant hypoexpression of osteoprotegerin (OPG)
in IGF-I deficient mice, and its improvement by the exogenous administration of IGF-I (Figure 3A). OPG is a
protein produced by osteoblasts that inhibits osteoclastic differentiation [60-62], thus preventing their differentiation by standing at the binding site of RANKL
with its receptor [60,62]. Moreover, IGF-I deficient mice
overexpressed RANKL while IGF-I replacement therapy
normalizes its expression (Figure 5A). In addition, PTH
and its receptor are involved in osteoclastic differentiation
and activity [35,63]. In the present study, it was found that
IGF-I exogenous administration reduced PTHR1 expression (Figure 5B). All these mechanisms, that may explain a
reduction on bone resorption, are summarized in Figure 6.
On the other hand, the partial IGF-I deficiency was
linked to a decrease of the following gene expressions:
CTR, SOST, and IGFBP-5, all of them closely related,
through distinct mechanisms, to the promotion of the
osteoblastic activity or osteoclastic inhibition [39,60]. This
outcome is consistent with previous data [64,65], where
osteocyte PTH receptor 1 activation was shown sufficient
to decrease SOST expression. Additionally, partial IGF-I
deficiency was associated with bone hypoexpression of the
RUNX2 gene, a marker of early osteoblastogenesis [58,61].
Interestingly, exogenous administration of IGF-I improved calcitonin receptor, SOST and RUNX2 expressions.
IGFBP-5 has been described as an IGF-I carrier protein that
promotes its actions in bone [27,32,33,35] and, although
IGF-I replacement therapy did not module its hypoexpression, it could also be involved in the reduction of
bone mass observed in these heterozygous mice. However,
IGFBP-4 competes with IGF-I in its receptor and inhibits
in vitro osteoblastic activity [26,35]. In the present study,
IGF-I replacement therapy induced a significant decrease
of IGFBP-4 gene expression, suggesting that this inhibitory mechanism may be contributing to the increase in
bone mass described in this paper.
These findings are consistent with the known effects
of IGF-I on bone both in vivo [3,66-68] and in vitro,
where IGF-I enhances bone collagen and matrix synthesis
and stimulates the replication of cells from the osteoblast
lineage [66,68].

attenuate the decrease in bone weight and densitometry
observed in Hz mice, restoring both densitometry values
and histopathological parameters (cortical thickness),
suggesting an increased bone-forming activity in the
tibia in Hz + IGF-I mice as compared with Hz group.
Accordingly, the exogenous administration of IGF-I, at
low doses, normalized the calcitonin receptor, OPG and
SOST gene expressions, while it reduced IGFBP-4 gene
expression, a carrier protein that, as stated before, inhibits
IGF-I activities in bone [27,32,33,35].
Conclusion
In conclusion, partial IGF-I deficiency alone is responsible
for osteopenia, characterized by reduced bone mass
determined by densitometry and histology, associated
with a reduced expression of several proteins involved
in osteoblastic/osteocyte activity (OPG, SOST, CTR,
IGFBP-5 and RUNX2) and with an overexpression of
proteins promoting osteoclastic actions, providing at
least two mechanisms possibly contributing to the observed reduction on bone mass in Hz mice. Low doses
of IGF-I constitute an effective replacement therapy
that normalizes IGF-I serum levels and modulate the
expression of most of these proteins, increasing boneformation and reducing bone resorption.
