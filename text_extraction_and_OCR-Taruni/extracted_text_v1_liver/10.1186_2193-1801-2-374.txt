Abstract
Background: Hypersplenism is a common complication in cirrhotic patients, and liver transplantation would be
one of the effective treatments. However, detailed dynamics, especially over a long term, are not fully understood.
We investigated the long-term dynamics of hematological data and spleen volumes, as well as their correlation in
cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation.
Patients and methods: We studied 53 cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation at our institute and
followed for more than 1 year. Hematological data were collected from medical records, while spleen volumes
were determined by CT volumetry at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 postoperative months (POM).
Results: (1) Platelet (Plt) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were gradually increased up to 18 and 10 POM, respectively, in
contrast with white blood cells (WBC), which remained mostly unchanged from pretransplantation levels. (2) Spleen
volume was sharply decreased in the first POM, then showed a slower but steady decline up to 48 POM. (3) Spleen
volume was significantly correlated with hematological data, though the levels were generally weak (Plt: r = 0.433,
p < 0.001; Hb: r = 0.233, p < 0.001; WBC: r = 0.217, p = 0.001). (4) Spleen volume was strongly correlated with all
hematological parameters in HBV patients (Plt: r = 0.617, p < 0.0001; Hb: r = 0.401, p < 0.001; WBC: r = 0.387, p < 0.001), in
contrast with that in other etiologies, which had generally weak correlations though some were statistically significant.
Conclusions: We investigated the long-term dynamics of hematological data and spleen volume in cirrhotic
patients after liver transplantation. Unique dynamics and correlations between them were found among the
different etiologies investigated.

Introduction
Hypersplenism and pancytopenia are common complications in patients with liver cirrhosis, which occasionally induce life-threatening complications or loss of quality of life
(QOL) from bleeding, infection, or anemic symptoms. The
incidence of hypersplenism among cirrhotic patients varies
from 15–70% (Yanaga et al. 1989; Mutchnik et al. 1980).
Among the various hematological conditions in these
patients, thrombocytopenia is well-studied, though its
mechanism remains a matter of debate even in the recent days. Traditionally, sequestration of platelets by the
spleen has been proposed as the main mechanism, other
mechanisms such as reduced thrombopoietin or decreased survival time of platelet have been recently
considered to contribute to these mechanisms (Pradella
et al. 2011; Witters et al. 2008). Nevertheless, it has not
been well elucidated to what extent hypersplenism and
splenic sequestration contribute to the mechanism of
thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients.

For rescuing patients from these disorders, direct removal of spleen by splenectomy (Puttini et al. 1979; Soper
& Rikkers 1982), volume reduction of spleen by partial
splenic embolization (Stiegler et al. 1998; Sangro et al.
1993; Herrero et al. 1997), or portal decompression by
transjuglar intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (Alvarez et al.
1996; Pursnani et al. 1997) are performed as the effective
methods in these days. However, some controversial reports have noted that thrombocytopenia may persist even
after splenectomy or partial decompression (Pradella et al.
2011; Sanyal et al. 1996; Gschwantler et al. 1999).
Liver transplantation can also be an effective treatment by replacing cirrhotic liver with normal one
and thereby reducing portal hypertension and consequently diminishing splenomegaly. In fact, some reports
have noted that thrombopoiesis occurred soon after liver
transplantation (Yanaga et al. 1989; Stiegler et al. 1998;
Borel Rinkes et al. 1991; Peck-Radosavljevic et al. 2000)
and spleen volumes were significantly lowered at 1-2 postoperative months as compared with the preoperative levels
(Yanaga et al. 1989).
In those studies, platelet dynamics were observed for
only very short periods (14 days to 2 months), and data
for long-term dynamics are scarce. Moreover, finding regarding white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells
(RBC) in cirrhotic patients are particularly lacking and
found only in older studies (Holzbach et al. 1964).
In the present study, we investigated the long-term dynamics of hematological data and spleen volume after
liver transplantation that is not known well in cirrhotic
patients. In addition, we also analyzed the differences in
dynamics among different etiologies.
Patients and methods
Patients
We performed liver transplantation for 84 cirrhotic patients between 2003 and 2011 at our institution. Among
them, following patients were excluded; 10 who died
within one year, 3 who were followed for less than 1 year
after transplantation, 7 who were treated with IFN which
affects hematological data, 5 who underwent splenectomy,
6 for whom we were unable to measure precise spleen volume because artifacts caused by splenic arterial coiling. Finally, 53 patients were included in this study and their
background data are shown in Table 1. Among these, patients were divided into 4 groups based on etiologies;
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Primary
Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC), and others (5 Primary Screlosing
Cholangitis (PSC), 5 cholestatic except PBC or PSC, 3
Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH), 1 Wilson’s disease, and 1
undetermined etiology) classified as nonBnonC (NBNC)
because of the small numbers of each etiology. And among
them, 27 patients reached 5 years for follow-up time, so we
also did the long-term analysis in these patients. Median
follow up times were 76 months in 27 patients in longterm analysis and 60 months in all 53 patients in this study,
and follow up period in each subgroup was included in
Table 1.
Hematological data and spleen volumes
White blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin (Hb) levels,
and platelet (Plt) counts were picked up from medical records in preoperatively, every postoperative month until 12
postoperative months (POM), and then every 3 months
until 60 POM. Finally, data at 1253 time points were collected from 53 patients.
Spleen volume was determined based on digital data
of follow-up computed tomography (CT) in preoperatively, 1, 3, 6, 12 POM and then annually until 60 POM
and collected retrospectively. They were approximated
as the sum of truncated polygonal pyramids from 5-mm
thin slices using Aquilion multislice CT system (Toshiba
Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Thus, CT data at 278
time points were collected from 40 patients.

Statistical analysis
For comparisons of data that consisted of continuous
numbers among the groups, Student’s t-test was applied. To analyze correlations between spleen volume and
hematological data, linear regression analysis was applied.
p < 0.05 in each analysis was considered as statistically significance. For linear regression analysis, correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the impact of the correlations.
All analyses were done with SPSS 16.0 J software (SPSS
Japan, Tokyo, Japan).
Results
Short-term (1 year) and long-term (5 years) dynamics of
hematological data for each hematological subset
The short-term dynamics of WBC were shown in Figure 1a.
Those counts increased to peak at 1 POM, though the
changes were not statistically significant as compared
with baseline levels. Thereafter, they significantly decreased to 4 POM and reached a plateau, and this trend
remained unchanged in long-term analysis (Figure 1b).
In contrast, Hb levels increased more slowly up to 10
POM, then reached a plateau and remained there for
the long terms (Figure 2a, 2c). Platelet counts were significantly increased at 2 POM, and then slightly decreased
(Figure 3a), after which they seemed to increase gradually,
though the statistical impact was relatively small. Platelet
levels at 18 POM and later were significantly higher only
when compared to the baselines (Figure 3c). These data
showed that hematological parameters reached a plateau
faster than expected, though some differences were seen
among the various etiologies.
Short-term (1 year) and long-term (5 years) dynamics of
hematological data among different etiologies
Figure 1b shows the short-term dynamics of WBC counts
among different etiologies. Those in HBV patients sharply
increased at 1 POM as compared with baseline, then significantly decreased at 4 POM and reached a plateau. In
contrast, those for NBNC patients significantly decreased
at 4 POM as compared with baseline and reached a

plateau. As for PBC and HCV, there were no significant
changes in the short-term period. Over the long-term,
those trends were unchanged except in HBV patients, in
whose WBC levels at 48 POM were higher as compared
to 12 POM (Figure 1d). Hb levels were higher at 2 POM
in HCV patients, and 3 POM in NBNC patients as compared with baselines then both reached a plateau thereafter (Figure 2b, 2d). In PBC patients, that was higher at
2 POM as compared with baseline, and continued to
gradually rise with the level at 12 POM, which was significantly higher as compared with that at 2 POM, and
after which they reached a plateau. In HBV patients, Hb
level increased more slowly, with that at 5 POM higher
than that of the baseline, and gradually rising until level
at 11 POM which was significantly higher than that at 5
POM after which they reached a plateau (Figure 2b, 2d).
As for platelet counts, patients with viral hepatitis (HBV
and HCV) showed sharply increased levels up to 3 POM
and until reaching a plateau, which was in contrast to
non-viral patients (PBC and NBNC) whose levels were
generally unchanged (Figure 3b and 3d).
These data showed that dynamics of each hematological
parameter varied among the different etiologies of liver cirrhosis after liver transplantation.
Dynamics of spleen volume after liver transplantation in
cirrhotic patients
After liver transplantation, theoretically hypersplenism is
expected to be cured because of resigning from liver fibrosis. We next analyzed the dynamics of spleen volume
after liver transplantation in all patients and among the
different etiologies.
Spleen volumes showed a slow, but steady and significant
decrease at least until 48 POM (Figure 4a). The differences
regarding dynamics among the different etiologies are
shown in Figure 4b. In viral patients, spleen volumes

showed a steady decrease over the long term, while in patients with PBC, a sharp decline was seen at 1 POM then a
slower decrease occurred up to 24 POM. In contrast, there
were no significant changes within 60 months after liver
transplantation in the NBNC patients.
These findings show that spleen volumes generally had
a steady and significant decrease in our cirrhotic patients
after liver transplantation except in those with NBNC.
Correlations between spleen volume and hematological
data in all patients and among different etiologies
Figure 5 shows correlations among hematological data
and spleen volume. Significant correlations were seen between spleen volume and each hematological data point,
though the correlations were generally weak (Plt: r = 0.433,
p < 0.001; Figure 5a, Hb: r = 0.233, p < 0.001; Figure 5b,
WBC: r = 0.217, p = 0.001; Figure 5c).
Analysis in each etiology, relatively strong correlations
were seen in HBV patients, with the correlations between
platelets and spleen volumes the strongest (Plt: r = 0.617,
p < 0.001; Figure 6a, Hb: r = 0.401, p < 0.001; Figure 6b,
WBC: r = 0.387, p < 0.001; Figure 6c, respectively). In
other etiologies, the correlations were generally weak
or not significant (Figure 6d-6i, 6k, 6l) except that between
Plt level and spleen volume in NBNC (r = 0.660, p < 0.001,
Figure 6j).
These results suggest that changes in spleen volume
were significantly correlated with those of hematological
data, though the correlations were generally weak. Therefore, there may be some independent and undefined mechanisms other than hypersplenism related to the changes
in hematological data during the progression of cirrhosis
and recovery after liver transplantation (Peck-Radosavljevic
et al. 2000).
Discussion
The reduction in number of hematological cells in cirrhotic patients has already been shown to recover after
liver transplantation in the previous studies by others
(Yanaga et al. 1989; Stiegler et al. 1998; Borel Rinkes
et al. 1991; Peck-Radosavljevic et al. 2000). However, those
studies focused on the relatively short-term dynamics of

platelets, while those over a long term and for red and
white blood cells have not been well understood. Recently, Ohira, et.al. reported fine and detailed investigation of the correlations between spleen volume and all
three hematological parameters, though even this report
investigated up to 6 months after liver transplantation
(Ohira et al. 2009).
In the present study, we studied the dynamics of
hematological data and spleen volume in 53 patients
with cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation without a splenectomy. Each hematological parameter showed
different dynamics with platelet and WBC showing faster
increases with peak levels reached at 1, and 2 POM, respectively (Figures 1a, 1c and 3a, 3c). Thereafter, WBC
level soon returned to the baseline (Figure 1a and 1c),
whereas platelets only slightly decreased and then rose
again slowly until 18 POM (Figure 3a, 3c). The dynamics
of Hb were slower as recovery continued for about 1 year
and then reached a plateau (Figure 2a, 2c).
Over the long term dynamics, spleen volume showed a
slow, but steady and statistically significant decrease
until at least 48 POM (Figure 4a) as compared with the

long-term dynamics of hematological data which showed
nearly no changes in the later phase (Figures 1c, 2c and
3c). Spleen volume and each hematological parameter
were significantly correlated with each other, though the
correlations were generally low (Figure 5a, 5b and 5c).
These findings suggest hypersplenism to be one of
the main causes of pancytopenia in cirrhotic patients,
though its impact is smaller than expected. Thus, other
independent mechanisms might also contribute for this
disease formation.
Regarding platelets, relatively large numbers of candidates have been investigated in the previous studies. The
most studied factor is thrombopoietin, a cytokine produced by the liver that regulates megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production (Pradella et al. 2011;
Witters et al. 2008). Adinolfi, et al showed that hepatic fibrosis and altered production of thrombopoietin are central players in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in
patients with chronic viral hepatitis without splenomegaly (Adinolfi et al. 2001). Moreover, thrombopoietin has
been shown to rapidly increase after liver transplantation
(Peck-Radosavljevic et al. 2000). However, those studies
presented relatively short-term data, and the long-term
effects of this cytokine remain largely unknown.
In addition to the platelet production, decreased
platelet survival time may be a mechanism related to
thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients (Pradella et al.
2011; Witters et al. 2008). Thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic
patients has been reported to have a remarkable homology
with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as the reticulated platelet proportion (proportion of young platelets)
and glycocalicin index (marker of platelet production) were
significantly higher in both diseases as compared with
healthy controls (Witters et al. 2008; Kajihara et al. 2003;
Kajihara et al. 2007). Pradella et al. showed plateletassociated antibodies and anti-platelet antibodies were
significantly higher in HCV-positive patients as compared to other etiologies of cirrhosis (Pradella et al.
2011). In this study, the correlation between platelet level
and spleen volume was relatively weak (p = 0.364, Figure 6f )
in HCV. Thus, in addition to spleen sequestration, decreased survival may be one of the likely mechanisms for
thrombocytopenia in HCV-positive cirrhotic patients,
though direct evidence for platelet related antibodies was
not investigated in this study.
In contrast to the other etiologies investigated, the correlation between spleen volume and platelet count in HBV
patients was strong (p = 0.617, Figure 6c). Thus, splenic sequestration was considered to be the main mechanism, in
contrast with PBC patients, in whom spleen volume was
relatively large though the correlation between spleen volume and platelet count were weak, and NBNC patients, in
whom the correlation was high, while spleen volumes was
generally unchanged. Our study revealed these varing
dynamics among the different etiologies even when only
the correlation between platelet count and spleen volume
were investigated.
As for WBC and Hb levels in cirrhotic patients, information was much more scant. Sequestration of RBC in
the spleen was shown to occur according to portal pressure and spleen size in an old study. Jiao et al. reported
that erythrocyte creatine, which is considered to be a
marker of destruction of erythrocytes, showed good correlations with spleen size and reticulocytes (Jiao et al.
2001). Therefore, erythrocytes may be supposed to be correlated with spleen volume better than other hematological
parameters.
In our study, Hb was shown to increase slower than
the other hematological parameters, thus the impact of
spleen volume, which showed a steady decrease, might
be supposed to affect the erythrocyte count to a larger
degree than other parameters. On the other hand, an
unknown mechanism might also exist because Hb level
reached a plateau at 10 POM (Figure 2a and 2c), and the
correlation between Hb and spleen volume was relatively
weak (Figure 5b). As for WBC, data are quite rare. In
the present study, WBC were increased at 1 POM and
then decreased to the baseline or lower, while correlation
between spleen volume and WBC was much weaker as
compared to other parameters (Figure 5c).
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the long-term dynamics of
hematological parameters and spleen volume in cirrhotic
patients after liver transplantation. Each hematological parameter increased in the early postoperative period, and
thereafter, though each generally reached a plateau in the
later phase. In contrast in spleen volume, a steady reduction was found up to 48 POM. Hematological data and
spleen volume were significantly correlated with each
other, though their correlations were generally weak. Furthermore, these dynamics were very different among the
etiologies for cirrhosis investigated. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to investigate long-term
dynamics after liver transplantation. From these findings,
we intend to further investigate the detailed mechanisms
of these differences among etiologies, as well as discrepancies between hematological data and spleen volume.
