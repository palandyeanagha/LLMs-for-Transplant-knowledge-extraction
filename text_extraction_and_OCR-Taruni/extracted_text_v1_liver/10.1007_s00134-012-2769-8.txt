Abstract Objective: To provide
an update to the ‘‘Surviving Sepsis
Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic
Shock,’’ last published in 2008.
Design: A consensus committee of
68 international experts representing
30 international organizations was
convened. Nominal groups were
assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members
attending the conference). A formal
conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and
enforced throughout. The entire
guidelines process was conducted
independent of any industry funding.
A stand-alone meeting was held for
all subgroup heads, co- and vicechairs, and selected individuals.
Teleconferences and electronic-based
discussion among subgroups and
among the entire committee served as
an integral part of the development.
Methods: The authors were advised
to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) system to guide assessment
of quality of evidence from high
(A) to very low (D) and to determine
the strength of recommendations as
strong (1) or weak (2). The potential
drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of lowquality evidence were emphasized.
Recommendations were classified
into three groups: (1) those directly
targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill
patient and considered high priority in
severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations. Results: Key
recommendations and suggestions,
listed by category, include: early
quantitative resuscitation of the septic
patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before
antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging
studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection
(UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within
1 h of the recognition of septic shock
(1B) and severe sepsis without septic
shock (1C) as the goal of therapy;
reassessment of antimicrobial therapy
daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control
with attention to the balance of risks
and benefits of the chosen method
within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial
fluid resuscitation with crystalloid
(1B) and consideration of the addition
of albumin in patients who continue
to require substantial amounts of
crystalloid to maintain adequate mean
arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B);
initial fluid challenge in patients with
sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion
and suspicion of hypovolemia to
achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of
crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may
be needed in some patients (1C); fluid
challenge technique continued as long
as hemodynamic improvement is
based on either dynamic or static
variables (UG); norepinephrine as the
first-choice vasopressor to maintain
mean arterial pressure C65 mmHg
(1B); epinephrine when an additional
agent is needed to maintain adequate
blood pressure (2B); vasopressin
(0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean
arterial pressure to target or to
decrease norepinephrine dose but
should not be used as the initial
vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not
recommended except in highly
selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added
to vasopressor in the presence of
(a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling
pressures and low cardiac output, or
(b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion
despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean
arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of
intravenous hydrocortisone in adult
septic shock patients if adequate fluid
resuscitation and vasopressor therapy
are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of
7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue
hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary
artery disease, or acute hemorrhage
166

(1B); low tidal volume (1A) and
limitation of inspiratory plateau
pressure (1B) for acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of
positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather
than lower level of PEEP for patients
with sepsis-induced moderate or
severe ARDS (2C); recruitment
maneuvers in sepsis patients with
severe refractory hypoxemia due to
ARDS (2C); prone positioning in
sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a
PaO2/FiO2 ratio of B100 mm Hg in
facilities that have experience with
such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated
patients unless contraindicated (1B);
a conservative fluid strategy for
patients with established ARDS who
do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning
and sedation (1A); minimizing use of
either intermittent bolus sedation or
continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B);
avoidance of neuromuscular blockers
if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of
neuromuscular blocker (no longer
than 48 h) for patients with early
ARDS and a PaO2/FIO2\150 mm Hg
(2C); a protocolized approach to
blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two
consecutive blood glucose levels are
[180 mg/dL, targeting an upper
blood glucose B180 mg/dL (1A);
equivalency of continuous venovenous hemofiltration or intermittent
hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for
deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of
stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent
upper gastrointestinal bleeding in
patients with bleeding risk factors
(1B); oral or enteral (if necessary)
feedings, as tolerated, rather than
either complete fasting or provision
of only intravenous glucose within
the first 48 h after a diagnosis of
severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and
addressing goals of care, including
treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as
feasible, but within 72 h of intensive
care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric
severe sepsis include: therapy with
face mask oxygen, high flow nasal
cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal
continuous PEEP in the presence of
respiratory distress and hypoxemia
(2C), use of physical examination
therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock
associated with hypovolemia, the use
of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a
bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or
albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min
(2C); more common use of inotropes
and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with
elevated systemic vascular resistance
(2C); and use of hydrocortisone only
in children with suspected or proven
‘‘absolute’’’ adrenal insufficiency
(2C). Conclusions: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of
international experts regarding many
level 1 recommendations for the best
care of patients with severe sepsis.
Although a significant number of
aspects of care have relatively weak
support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute
management of sepsis and septic
shock are the foundation of improved
outcomes for this important group of
critically ill patients.

Sepsis bundles
Sepsis is a systemic, deleterious host response to infection
leading to severe sepsis (acute organ dysfunction secondary to documented or suspected infection) and septic
shock (severe sepsis plus hypotension not reversed with
fluid resuscitation). Severe sepsis and septic shock are
major healthcare problems, affecting millions of people
around the world each year, killing one in four (and often
more), and increasing in incidence [1–5]. Similar to
polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke, the
speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the
initial hours after severe sepsis develops are likely to
influence outcome.
The recommendations in this document are intended to
provide guidance for the clinician caring for a patient with
severe sepsis or septic shock. Recommendations from
these guidelines cannot replace the clinician’s decisionmaking capability when he or she is presented with a
patient’s unique set of clinical variables. Most of these
recommendations are appropriate for the severe sepsis
patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU
settings. In fact, the committee believes that the greatest
outcome improvement can be made through education
and process change for those caring for severe sepsis
patients in the non-ICU setting and across the spectrum of
acute care. Resource limitations in some institutions and
countries may prevent physicians from accomplishing
particular recommendations. Thus, these recommendations are intended to be best practice (the committee
considers this a goal for clinical practice) and not created
to represent standard of care. The Surviving Sepsis
Campaign (SSC) Guidelines Committee hopes that over
time, particularly through education programs and formal
167

audit and feedback performance improvement initiatives,
the guidelines will influence bedside healthcare practitioner behavior that will reduce the burden of sepsis
worldwide.
Methodology
Definitions
Sepsis is defined as the presence (probable or documented)
of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection. Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus sepsis-induced
organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (Tables 1, 2) [6].
Throughout this manuscript and the performance improvement bundles, which are included, a distinction is made
between definitions and therapeutic targets or thresholds.
Sepsis-induced hypotension is defined as a systolic blood
pressure (SBP)\90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP)
\70 mmHg or a SBP decrease[40 mmHg or less than two
standard deviations below normal for age in the absence of
other causes of hypotension. An example of a therapeutic
target or typical threshold for the reversal of hypotension is
seen in the sepsis bundles for the use of vasopressors. In the
bundles, the MAP threshold is C65 mmHg. The use of definition versusthreshold will be evident throughout this article.
Septic shock is defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Sepsis-induced
tissue hypoperfusion is defined as infection-induced hypotension, elevated lactate, or oliguria.
History of the guidelines
These clinical practice guidelines are a revision of the 2008
SSC guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and
septic shock [7]. The initial SSC guidelines were published
in 2004 [8] and incorporated the evidence available through
the end of 2003. The 2008 publication analyzed evidence
available through the end of 2007. The most current iteration
is based on updated literature search incorporated into the
evolving manuscript through fall 2012.
Selection and organization of committee members
The selection of committee members was based on interest
and expertise in specific aspects of sepsis. Co-chairs and
executive committee members were appointed by the
Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of
Intensive Care Medicine governing bodies. Each sponsoring organization appointed a representative who had sepsis
expertise. Additional committee members were appointed
by the co-chairs and executive committee to create continuity with the previous committees’ membership as well as
to address content needs for the development process. Four
clinicians with experience in the GRADE process application (referred to in this document as GRADE group or
Evidence-Based Medicine [EBM] group) took part in the
guidelines development.
The guidelines development process began with
appointment of group heads and assignment of committee
members to groups according to their specific expertise.
Each group was responsible for drafting the initial update to
the 2008 edition in their assigned area (with major additional
elements of information incorporated into the evolving
manuscript through year-end 2011 and early 2012).
With input from the EBM group, an initial group meeting was held to establish procedures for literature review and
development of tables for evidence analysis. Committees
and their subgroups continued work via phone and the
Internet. Several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key
individuals occurred at major international meetings
(nominal groups), with work continuing via teleconferences
and electronic-based discussions among subgroups and
members of the entire committee. Ultimately, a meeting of
all group heads, executive committee members, and other
key committee members was held to finalize the draft document for submission to reviewers.
Search techniques
A separate literature search was performed for each clearly
defined question. The committee chairs worked with subgroup heads to identify pertinent search terms that were to
include, at a minimum, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock,
and sepsis syndrome crossed against the subgroup’s general
topic area, as well as appropriate key words of the specific
question posed. All questions used in the previous guidelines publications were searched, as were pertinent new
questions generated by general topic-related searches or
recent trials. The authors were specifically asked to look for
existing meta-analyses related to their question and search a
minimum of one general database (i.e., MEDLINE, EMBASE) and the Cochrane Library [both The Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of
Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)]. Other
databases were optional (ACP Journal Club, EvidenceBased Medicine Journal, Cochrane Registry of Controlled
Clinical Trials, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry (http://www.controlled-trials.com/
isrctn/) or metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.
controlled-trials.com/mrct/). Where appropriate, available
evidence was summarized in the form of evidence tables.
Grading of recommendations
We advised the authors to follow the principles of the
GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of
168

evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the
strength of recommendations (Tables 3, 4) [9–11]. The SSC
Steering Committee and individual authors collaborated
with GRADE representatives to apply the system during the
SSC guidelines revision process. The members of the
GRADE group were directly involved, either in person or
via e-mail, in all discussions and deliberations among the
guidelines committee members as to grading decisions.
The GRADE system is based on a sequential assessment of the quality of evidence, followed by assessment
of the balance between the benefits and risks, burden, and
cost, leading to development and grading of a management recommendation. Keeping the rating of quality of
evidence and strength of recommendation explicitly separate constitutes a crucial and defining feature of the
GRADE approach. This system classifies quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), low (grade
C), or very low (grade D). Randomized trials begin as
high-quality evidence but may be downgraded due to
limitations in implementation, inconsistency, or imprecision of the results, indirectness of the evidence, and
possible reporting bias (Table 3). Examples of indirectness of the evidence include population studied,
interventions used, outcomes measured, and how these
relate to the question of interest. Well-done observational
(nonrandomized) studies begin as low-quality evidence,
but the quality level may be upgraded on the basis of a
large magnitude of effect. An example of this is the
quality of evidence for early administration of antibiotics.

The GRADE system classifies recommendations as
strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2). The factors influencing
this determination are presented in Table 4. The assignment
of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence.
The committee assessed whether the desirable effects of
adherence would outweigh the undesirable effects, and the
strength of a recommendation reflects the group’s degree of
confidence in that assessment. Thus, a strong recommendation in favor of an intervention reflects the panel’s opinion
that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation
(beneficial health outcomes; lesser burden on staff and
patients; and cost savings) will clearly outweigh the undesirable effects (harm to health; more burden on staff and
patients; and greater costs). The potential drawbacks of
making strong recommendations in the presence of lowquality evidence were taken into account. A weak recommendation in favor of an intervention indicates the judgment
that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation
probably will outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel
is not confident about these tradeoffs—either because some
of the evidence is low quality (and thus uncertainty remains
regarding the benefits and risks) or the benefits and downsides are closely balanced. A strong recommendation is
worded as ‘‘we recommend’’ and a weak recommendation
as ‘‘we suggest.’’
Throughout the document are a number of statements
that either follow graded recommendations or are listed as
stand-alone numbered statements followed by ‘‘ungraded’’
in parentheses (UG). In the opinion of the committee,
these recommendations were not conducive for the
GRADE process.
The implications of calling a recommendation strong
are that most well-informed patients would accept that
intervention and that most clinicians should use it in most
situations. Circumstances may exist in which a strong
recommendation cannot or should not be followed for an
individual because of that patient’s preferences or clinical
characteristics that make the recommendation less applicable. A strong recommendation does not automatically
imply standard of care. For example, the strong recommendation for administering antibiotics within 1 h of the
diagnosis of severe sepsis, as well as the recommendation
for achieving a central venous pressure (CVP) of
8 mmHg and a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)
of 70 % in the first 6 h of resuscitation of sepsis-induced
tissue hypoperfusion, although deemed desirable, are not
yet standards of care as verified by practice data.
Significant education of committee members on the
GRADE approach built on the process conducted during
2008 efforts. Several members of the committee were
trained in the use of GRADEpro software, allowing more
formal use of the GRADE system [12]. Rules were distributed concerning assessing the body of evidence, and
GRADE representatives were available for advice
throughout the process. Subgroups agreed electronically
on draft proposals that were then presented for general
discussion among subgroup heads, the SSC Steering
Committee (two co-chairs, two co-vice chairs, and an atlarge committee member), and several selected key
committee members who met in July 2011 in Chicago.
The results of that discussion were incorporated into the
next version of recommendations and again discussed
with the whole group using electronic mail. Draft recommendations were distributed to the entire committee
Table 3 Determination of the quality of evidence
Underlying methodology
A (high) RCTs
B (moderate) downgraded RCTs or upgraded observational studies
C (low) well-done observational studies with control RCTs
D (very low) downgraded controlled studies or expert opinion
based on other evidence
Factors that may decrease the strength of evidence
1. Poor quality of planning and implementation of available RCTs,
suggesting high likelihood of bias
2. Inconsistency of results, including problems with subgroup
analyses
3. Indirectness of evidence (differing population, intervention,
control, outcomes, comparison)
4. Imprecision of results
5. High likelihood of reporting bias
Main factors that may increase the strength of evidence
1. Large magnitude of effect (direct evidence, relative risk[2
with no plausible confounders)
2. Very large magnitude of effect with relative risk [5 and no
threats to validity (by two levels)
3. Dose–response gradient
RCT randomized controlled trial
Table 4 Factors determining strong versus weak recommendation
What should be considered Recommended process
High or moderate evidence (is
there high or moderate quality
evidence?)
The higher the quality of
evidence, the more likely a
strong recommendation.
Certainty about the balance of
benefits versus harms and
burdens (is there certainty?)
The larger the difference
between the desirable and
undesirable consequences and
the certainty around that
difference, the more likely a
strong recommendation. The
smaller the net benefit and the
lower the certainty for that
benefit, the more likely a weak
recommendation
Certainty in or similar values (is
there certainty or similarity?)
The more certainty or similarity
in values and preferences, the
more likely a strong
recommendation
Resource implications (are
resources worth expected
benefits?)
The lower the cost of an
intervention compared to the
alternative and other costs
related to the decision–i.e.,
fewer resources consumed—
the more likely a strong
recommendation

and finalized during an additional nominal group meeting
in Berlin in October 2011. Deliberations and decisions
were then recirculated to the entire committee for
approval. At the discretion of the chairs and following
discussion, competing proposals for wording of recommendations or assigning strength of evidence were
resolved by formal voting within subgroups and at nominal group meetings. The manuscript was edited for style
and form by the writing committee with final approval by
subgroup heads and then by the entire committee. To
satisfy peer review during the final stages of manuscript
approval for publication, several recommendations were
edited with approval of the SSC executive committee
group head for that recommendation and the EBM lead.
Conflict of interest policy
Since the inception of the SSC guidelines in 2004, no
members of the committee represented industry; there
was no industry input into guidelines development; and
no industry representatives were present at any of the
meetings. Industry awareness or comment on the recommendations was not allowed. No member of the
guidelines committee received honoraria for any role in
the 2004, 2008, or 2012 guidelines process.
A detailed description of the disclosure process and all
author disclosures appear in Supplemental Digital Content 1
in the supplemental materials to this document. Appendix 2
shows a flowchart of the COI disclosure process. Committee
members who were judged to have either financial or nonfinancial/academic competing interests were recused during
the closed discussion session and voting session on that
topic. Full disclosure and transparency of all committee
members’ potential conflicts were sought.
On initial review, 68 financial conflict of interest
(COI) disclosures and 54 non-financial disclosures were
submitted by committee members. Declared COI disclosures from 19 members were determined by the COI
subcommittee to be not relevant to the guidelines content
process. Nine who were determined to have COI (financial and non-financial) were adjudicated by group
reassignment and requirement to adhere to SSC COI
policy regarding discussion or voting at any committee
meetings where content germane to their COI was discussed. Nine were judged as having conflicts that could
not be resolved solely by reassignment. One of these
individuals was asked to step down from the committee.
The other eight were assigned to the groups in which they
had the least COI. They were required to work within
their group with full disclosure when a topic for which
they had relevant COI was discussed, and they were not
allowed to serve as group head. At the time of final
approval of the document, an update of the COI statement
was required. No additional COI issues were reported that
required further adjudication.
Management of severe sepsis
Initial resuscitation and infection issues (Table 5)
A. Initial resuscitation
1. We recommend the protocolized, quantitative resuscitation of patients with sepsis- induced tissue
hypoperfusion (defined in this document as hypotension persisting after initial fluid challenge or blood
lactate concentration C4 mmol/L). This protocol
should be initiated as soon as hypoperfusion is recognized and should not be delayed pending ICU
admission. During the first 6 h of resuscitation, the
goals of initial resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should include all of the following as a part
of a treatment protocol (grade 1C):
(a) CVP 8–12 mmHg
(b) MAP C65 mmHg
(c) Urine output C0.5 mL kg h-1
(d) Superior vena cava oxygenation saturation (ScvO2)
or mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) 70 or
65 %, respectively.
2. We suggest targeting resuscitation to normalize lactate
in patients with elevated lactate levels as a marker of
tissue hypoperfusion (grade 2C).
Rationale. In a randomized, controlled, single-center
study, early quantitative resuscitation improved survival
for emergency department patients presenting with septic
shock [13]. Resuscitation targeting the physiologic goals
expressed in recommendation 1 (above) for the initial 6-h
period was associated with a 15.9 % absolute reduction in
28-day mortality rate. This strategy, termed early goaldirected therapy, was evaluated in a multicenter trial of
314 patients with severe sepsis in eight Chinese centers
[14]. This trial reported a 17.7 % absolute reduction in
28-day mortality (survival rates, 75.2 vs. 57.5 %,
P = 0.001). A large number of other observational studies using similar forms of early quantitative resuscitation
in comparable patient populations have shown significant
mortality reduction compared to the institutions’ historical controls (Supplemental Digital Content 2). Phase III
of the SSC activities, the international performance
improvement program, showed that the mortality of septic
patients presenting with both hypotension and lactate
C4 mmol/L was 46.1 %, similar to the 46.6 % mortality
found in the first trial cited above [15]. As part of performance improvement programs, some hospitals have
lowered the lactate threshold for triggering quantitative
resuscitation in the patient with severe sepsis, but these
thresholds have not been subjected to randomized trials.
The consensus panel judged use of CVP and SvO2 targets
to be recommended physiologic targets for resuscitation.
Although there are limitations to CVP as a marker of
intravascular volume status and response to fluids, a low
CVP generally can be relied upon as supporting positive
171

response to fluid loading. Either intermittent or continuous
measurements of oxygen saturation were judged to be
acceptable. During the first 6 h of resuscitation, if ScvO2 less
than 70 % or SvO2 equivalent of less than 65 % persists with
what is judged to be adequate intravascular volume repletion in the presence of persisting tissue hypoperfusion, then
dobutamine infusion (to a maximum of 20 lg kg-1 min-1
)
or transfusion of packed red blood cells to achieve a
hematocrit of greater than or equal to 30 % in attempts to
achieve the ScvO2 or SvO2 goal are options. The strong
recommendation for achieving a CVP of 8 mmHg and an
ScvO2 of 70 % in the first 6 h of resuscitation of sepsisinduced tissue hypoperfusion, although deemed desirable,
are not yet the standard of care as verified by practice data.
The publication of the initial results of the international SSC
performance improvement program demonstrated that
adherence to CVP and ScvO2 targets for initial resuscitation
was low [15].
Table 5 Recommendations: initial resuscitation and infection issues
A. Initial resuscitation
1. Protocolized, quantitative resuscitation of patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion (defined in this document as hypotension
persisting after initial fluid challenge or blood lactate concentration C4 mmol/L). Goals during the first 6 h of resuscitation:
(a) Central venous pressure 8–12 mmHg
(b) Mean arterial pressure (MAP) C 65 mmHg
(c) Urine output C 0.5 mL kg-1 h
(d) Central venous (superior vena cava) or mixed venous oxygen saturation 70 or 65 %, respectively (grade 1C)
2. In patients with elevated lactate levels targeting resuscitation to normalize lactate as rapidly as possible (grade 2C)
B. Screening for sepsis and performance improvement
1. Routine screening of potentially infected seriously ill patients for severe sepsis to allow earlier implementation of therapy (grade 1C)
2. Hospital-based performance improvement efforts in severe sepsis (UG)
C. Diagnosis
1. Cultures as clinically appropriate before antimicrobial therapy if no significant delay ([45 min) in the start of antimicrobial(s) (grade
1C). At least 2 sets of blood cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) be obtained before antimicrobial therapy with at least 1 drawn
percutaneously and 1 drawn through each vascular access device, unless the device was recently (\48 h) inserted (grade 1C)
2. Use of the 1,3 b-D-glucan assay (grade 2B), mannan and anti-mannan antibody assays (2C), if available and invasive candidiasis is in
differential diagnosis of cause of infection.
3. Imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG)
D. Antimicrobial therapy
1. Administration of effective intravenous antimicrobials within the first hour of recognition of septic shock (grade 1B) and severe sepsis
without septic shock (grade 1C) as the goal of therapy
2a. Initial empiric anti-infective therapy of one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens (bacterial and/or fungal or
viral) and that penetrate in adequate concentrations into tissues presumed to be the source of sepsis (grade 1B)
2b. Antimicrobial regimen should be reassessed daily for potential deescalation (grade 1B)
3. Use of low procalcitonin levels or similar biomarkers to assist the clinician in the discontinuation of empiric antibiotics in patients who
initially appeared septic, but have no subsequent evidence of infection (grade 2C)
4a. Combination empirical therapy for neutropenic patients with severe sepsis (grade 2B) and for patients with difficult to treat,
multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens such as Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. (grade 2B). For patients with severe infections
associated with respiratory failure and septic shock, combination therapy with an extended spectrum beta-lactam and either an
aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone is for P. aeruginosa bacteremia (grade 2B). A combination of beta-lactam and macrolide for
patients with septic shock from bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (grade 2B)
4b. Empiric combination therapy should not be administered for more than 3–5 days. De-escalation to the most appropriate single
therapy should be performed as soon as the susceptibility profile is known (grade 2B)
5. Duration of therapy typically 7–10 days; longer courses may be appropriate in patients who have a slow clinical response, undrainable
foci of infection, bacteremia with S. aureus; some fungal and viral infections or immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia (grade
2C)
6. Antiviral therapy initiated as early as possible in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock of viral origin (grade 2C)
7. Antimicrobial agents should not be used in patients with severe inflammatory states determined to be of noninfectious cause (UG)
E. Source control
1. A specific anatomical diagnosis of infection requiring consideration for emergent source control be sought and diagnosed or excluded
as rapidly as possible, and intervention be undertaken for source control within the first 12 h after the diagnosis is made, if feasible
(grade 1C)
2. When infected peripancreatic necrosis is identified as a potential source of infection, definitive intervention is best delayed until
adequate demarcation of viable and nonviable tissues has occurred (grade 2B)
3. When source control in a severely septic patient is required, the effective intervention associated with the least physiologic insult
should be used (e.g., percutaneous rather than surgical drainage of an abscess) (UG)
4. If intravascular access devices are a possible source of severe sepsis or septic shock, they should be removed promptly after other
vascular access has been established (UG)
F. Infection prevention
1a. Selective oral decontamination and selective digestive decontamination should be introduced and investigated as a method to reduce
the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia; This infection control measure can then be instituted in health care settings and
regions where this methodology is found to be effective (grade 2B)
1b. Oral chlorhexidine gluconate be used as a form of oropharyngeal decontamination to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated
pneumonia in ICU patients with severe sepsis (grade 2B)
172

In mechanically ventilated patients or those with known
preexisting decreased ventricular compliance, a higher target
CVP of 12–15 mmHg should be achieved to account for the
impediment in filling [16]. Similar consideration may be
warranted in circumstances of increased abdominal pressure
[17]. Elevated CVP may also be seen with preexisting clinically significant pulmonary artery hypertension, making use
of this variable untenable for judging intravascular volume
status. Although the cause of tachycardia in septic patients
may be multifactorial, a decrease in elevated pulse rate with
fluid resuscitation is often a useful marker of improving
intravascular filling. Published observational studies have
demonstrated an association between good clinical outcome
in septic shock and MAP C65 mmHg as well as ScvO2
C70 % (measured in the superior vena cava, either intermittently or continuously) [18]. Many studies support the
value of early protocolized resuscitation in severe sepsis and
sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion [19–24]. Studies of
patients with shock indicate that SvO2 runs 5–7 % lower than
ScvO2 [25]. While the committee recognized the controversy
surrounding resuscitation targets, an early quantitative
resuscitation protocol using CVP and venous blood gases
can be readily established in both emergency department and
ICU settings [26]. Recognized limitations to static ventricular filling pressure estimates exist as surrogates for fluid
resuscitation [27, 28], but measurement of CVP is currently
the most readily obtainable target for fluid resuscitation.
Targeting dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness during
resuscitation, including flow and possibly volumetric indices
and microcirculatory changes, may have advantages [29–
32]. Available technologies allow measurement of flow at
the bedside [33, 34]; however, the efficacy of these monitoring techniques to influence clinical outcomes from early
sepsis resuscitation remains incomplete and requires further
study before endorsement.
The global prevalence of severe sepsis patients initially
presenting with either hypotension with lactate C4 mmol/L,
hypotension alone, or lactate C4 mmol/L alone, is reported
as 16.6, 49.5, and 5.4 %, respectively [15]. The mortality
rate is high in septic patients with both hypotension and
lactate C4 mmol/L (46.1 %) [15], and is also increased in
severely septic patients with hypotension alone (36.7 %)
and lactate C4 mmol/L alone (30 %) [15]. If ScvO2 is not
available, lactate normalization may be a feasible option in
the patient with severe sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion.
ScvO2 and lactate normalization may also be used as a
combined endpoint when both are available. Two multicenter randomized trials evaluated a resuscitation strategy
that included lactate reduction as a single target or a target
combined with ScvO2 normalization [35, 36]. The first trial
reported that early quantitative resuscitation based on lactate
clearance (decrease by at least 10 %) was noninferior to
early quantitative resuscitation based on achieving ScvO2 of
70 % or more [35]. The intention-to-treat group contained
300, but the number of patients actually requiring either
ScvO2 normalization or lactate clearance was small
(n = 30). The second trial included 348 patients with lactate
levels C3 mmol/L [36]. The strategy in this trial was based
on a greater than or equal to 20 % decrease in lactate levels
per 2 h of the first 8 h in addition to ScvO2 target achievement, and was associated with a 9.6 % absolute reduction in
mortality (P = 0.067; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61; 95 % CI,
0.43–0.87; P = 0.006).
B. Screening for sepsis and performance improvement
1. We recommend routine screening of potentially
infected seriously ill patients for severe sepsis to
increase the early identification of sepsis and allow
implementation of early sepsis therapy (grade 1C).
Rationale. The early identification of sepsis and implementation of early evidence-based therapies have been
documented to improve outcomes and decrease sepsisrelated mortality [15]. Reducing the time to diagnosis of
severe sepsis is thought to be a critical component of
reducing mortality from sepsis-related multiple organ
dysfunction [35]. Lack of early recognition is a major
obstacle to sepsis bundle initiation. Sepsis screening tools
have been developed to monitor ICU patients [37–41],
and their implementation has been associated with
decreased sepsis-related mortality [15].
2. Performance improvement efforts in severe sepsis
should be used to improve patient outcomes (UG).
Rationale. Performance improvement efforts in sepsis
have been associated with improved patient outcomes [19,
42–46]. Improvement in care through increasing compliance with sepsis quality indicators is the goal of a severe
sepsis performance improvement program [47]. Sepsis
management requires a multidisciplinary team (physicians,
nurses, pharmacy, respiratory, dieticians, and administration) and multispecialty collaboration (medicine, surgery,
and emergency medicine) to maximize the chance for success. Evaluation of process change requires consistent
education, protocol development and implementation, data
collection, measurement of indicators, and feedback to
facilitate the continuous performance improvement.
Ongoing educational sessions provide feedback on indicator compliance and can help identify areas for
additional improvement efforts. In addition to traditional
continuing medical education efforts to introduce guidelines into clinical practice, knowledge translation efforts
have recently been introduced as a means to promote the
use of high-quality evidence in changing behavior [48].
Protocol implementation associated with education and
performance feedback has been shown to change clinician behavior and is associated with improved outcomes
and cost effectiveness in severe sepsis [19, 23, 24, 49]. In
partnership with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, phase III of the SSC targeted the implementation of
173

a core set (‘‘bundle’’) of recommendations in hospital
environments where change in behavior and clinical
impact were measured [50]. The SSC guidelines and
bundles can be used as the basis of a sepsis performance
improvement program.
Application of the SSC sepsis bundles led to sustained,
continuous quality improvement in sepsis care and was
associated with reduced mortality [15]. Analysis of the data
from nearly 32,000 patient charts gathered from 239 hospitals in 17 countries through September 2011 as part of phase
III of the campaign informed the revision of the bundles in
conjunction with the 2012 guidelines. As a result, for the
2012 version, the management bundle was dropped and the
resuscitation bundle was broken into two parts and modified
as shown in Fig. 1. For performance improvement quality
indicators, resuscitation target thresholds are not considered.
However, recommended targets from the guidelines are
included with the bundles for reference purposes.
C. Diagnosis
1. We recommend obtaining appropriate cultures before
antimicrobial therapy is initiated if such cultures do
not cause significant delay ([45 min) in the start of
antimicrobial(s) administration (grade 1C). To optimize identification of causative organisms, we
recommend obtaining at least two sets of blood cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) before
antimicrobial therapy, with at least one drawn percutaneously and one drawn through each vascular access
device, unless the device was recently (\48 h) inserted. These blood cultures can be drawn at the same
time if they are obtained from different sites. Cultures
of other sites (preferably quantitative where appropriate), such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds,
respiratory secretions, or other body fluids that may be
the source of infection, should also be obtained before
antimicrobial therapy if doing so does not cause significant delay in antibiotic administration (grade 1C).
Rationale. Although sampling should not delay timely
administration of antimicrobial agents in patients with
severe sepsis (e.g., lumbar puncture in suspected meningitis), obtaining appropriate cultures before administration of
antimicrobials is essential to confirm infection and the
responsible pathogens, and to allow de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy after receipt of the susceptibility profile.
Samples can be refrigerated or frozen if processing cannot
be performed immediately. Because rapid sterilization of
blood cultures can occur within a few hours after the first
antimicrobial dose, obtaining those cultures before therapy
is essential if the causative organism is to be identified. Two
or more blood cultures are recommended [51]. In patients
with indwelling catheters (for more than 48 h), at least one
blood culture should be drawn through each lumen of each
vascular access device (if feasible, especially for vascular
devices with signs of inflammation, catheter dysfunction, or
indicators of thrombus formation). Obtaining blood cultures
peripherally and through a vascular access device is an
important strategy. If the same organism is recovered from
both cultures, the likelihood that the organism is causing the
severe sepsis is enhanced.
In addition, if equivalent volumes of blood drawn for
culture and the vascular access device is positive much
earlier than the peripheral blood culture (i.e., more than 2 h
earlier), the data support the concept that the vascular access
device is the source of the infection [36, 51, 52]. Quantitative
cultures of catheter and peripheral blood may also be useful
for determining whether the catheter is the source of infection. The volume of blood drawn with the culture tube should
be C10 mL [53]. Quantitative (or semiquantitative) cultures
of respiratory tract secretions are often recommended for the
diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [54],
but their diagnostic value remains unclear [55].
The Gram stain can be useful, in particular for respiratory tract specimens, to determine if inflammatory cells are
present (greater than five polymorphonuclear leukocytes/
high-powered field and less than 10 squamous cells/lowpowered field) and if culture results will be informative of
lower respiratory pathogens. Rapid influenza antigen testing
during periods of increased influenza activity in the community is also recommended. A focused history can provide
vital information about potential risk factors for infection
and likely pathogens at specific tissue sites. The potential
role of biomarkers for diagnosis of infection in patients
presenting with severe sepsis remains undefined. The utility
of procalcitonin levels or other biomarkers (such as
C-reactive protein) to discriminate the acute inflammatory
pattern of sepsis from other causes of generalized inflammation (e.g., postoperative, other forms of shock) has not
been demonstrated. No recommendation can be given for
the use of these markers to distinguish between severe
infection and other acute inflammatory states [56–58].
In the near future, rapid, non-culture-based diagnostic
methods (polymerase chain reaction, mass spectroscopy,
microarrays) might be helpful for a quicker identification of
pathogens and major antimicrobial resistance determinants
[59]. These methodologies could be particularly useful for
difficult-to-culture pathogens or in clinical situations where
empiric antimicrobial agents have been administered before
culture samples were been obtained. Clinical experience
remains limited, and more clinical studies are needed before
recommending these non-culture molecular methods as a
replacement for standard blood culture methods [60, 61].
2. We suggest the use of the 1,3 b-D-glucan assay (grade
2B), mannan and anti-mannan antibody assays (grade
2C), when invasive candidiasis is in the differential
diagnosis of infection.
Rationale. The diagnosis of systemic fungal infection
(usually candidiasis) in the critically ill patient can be
174

challenging, and rapid diagnostic methodologies, such as
antigen and antibody detection assays, can be helpful in
detecting candidiasis in the ICU patient. These suggested
tests have shown positive results significantly earlier than
standard culture methods [62–67], but false-positive
reactions can occur with colonization alone, and their
diagnostic utility in managing fungal infection in the ICU
needs additional study [65].
3. We recommend that imaging studies be performed
promptly in attempts to confirm a potential source of
infection. Potential sources of infection should be sampled as they are identified and in consideration of patient
risk for transport and invasive procedures (e.g., careful
coordination and aggressive monitoring if the decision is
made to transport for a computed tomography-guided
needle aspiration). Bedside studies, such as ultrasound,
may avoid patient transport (UG).
Rationale. Diagnostic studies may identify a source of
infection that requires removal of a foreign body or drainage
to maximize the likelihood of a satisfactory response to
therapy. Even in the most organized and well-staffed
healthcare facilities, however, transport of patients can be
dangerous, as can be placing patients in outside-unit imaging
devices that are difficult to access and monitor. Balancing
risk and benefit is therefore mandatory in those settings.
D. Antimicrobial therapy
1. The administration of effective intravenous antimicrobials within the first hour of recognition of septic
shock (grade 1B) and severe sepsis without septic
shock (grade 1C) should be the goal of therapy.
Remark: Although the weight of the evidence supports
prompt administration of antibiotics following the
recognition of severe sepsis and septic shock, the
feasibility with which clinicians may achieve this ideal
state has not been scientifically evaluated.
Rationale. Establishing vascular access and initiating
aggressive fluid resuscitation are the first priorities when
managing patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
Prompt infusion of antimicrobial agents should also be a
priority and may require additional vascular access ports
[68, 69]. In the presence of septic shock, each hour delay
in achieving administration of effective antibiotics is
associated with a measurable increase in mortality in a
number of studies [15, 68, 70–72]. Overall, the preponderance of data support giving antibiotics as soon as
possible in patients with severe sepsis with or without
septic shock [15, 68, 70–77]. The administration of antimicrobial agents with a spectrum of activity likely to treat
the responsible pathogen(s) effectively within 1 h of the
diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock. Practical
considerations, for example challenges with clinicians’
early identification of patients or operational complexities
in the drug delivery chain, represent unstudied variables
that may impact achieving this goal. Future trials should
endeavor to provide an evidence base in this regard. This
should be the target goal when managing patients with
septic shock, whether they are located within the hospital
ward, the emergency department, or the ICU. The strong
recommendation for administering antibiotics within 1 h
of the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock,
SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN CARE BUNDLES
TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 3 HOURS:
1) Measure lactate level
2) Obtain blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics
3) Administer broad spectrum antibiotics
4) Administer 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L
TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 6 HOURS:
5) Apply vasopressors (for hypotension that does not respond to initial fluid 
resuscitation) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg
6) In the event of persistent arterial hypotension despite volume resuscitation (septic 
shock) or initial lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL):
- Measure central venous pressure (CVP)*
- Measure central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)*
7) Remeasure lactate if initial lactate was elevated*
*Targets for quantitative resuscitation included in the guidelines are CVP of ≥8 mm Hg, 
ScvO2 of ≥ 70%, and normalization of lactate.

175

although judged to be desirable, is not yet the standard of
care as verified by published practice data [15].
If antimicrobial agents cannot be mixed and delivered
promptly from the pharmacy, establishing a supply of
premixed antibiotics for such urgent situations is an
appropriate strategy for ensuring prompt administration.
Many antibiotics will not remain stable if premixed in a
solution. This risk must be taken into consideration in
institutions that rely on premixed solutions for rapid
availability of antibiotics. In choosing the antimicrobial
regimen, clinicians should be aware that some antimicrobial agents have the advantage of bolus administration,
while others require a lengthy infusion. Thus, if vascular
access is limited and many different agents must be
infused, bolus drugs may offer an advantage.
2a. We recommend that initial empiric anti-infective therapy include one or more drugs that have activity against
all likely pathogens (bacterial and/or fungal or viral)
and that penetrate in adequate concentrations into the
tissues presumed to be the source of sepsis (grade 1B).
Rationale. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy
depends on complex issues related to the patient’s history,
including drug intolerances, recent receipt of antibiotics
(previous 3 months), underlying disease, the clinical syndrome, and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in the
community and hospital, and that previously have been
documented to colonize or infect the patient. The most
common pathogens that cause septic shock in hospitalized
patients are Gram-positive bacteria, followed by Gramnegative and mixed bacterial microorganisms. Candidiasis,
toxic shock syndromes, and an array of uncommon pathogens should be considered in selected patients. An especially
wide range of potential pathogens exists for neutropenic
patients. Recently used anti-infective agents should generally be avoided. When choosing empirical therapy,
clinicians should be cognizant of the virulence and growing
prevalence of oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams
and carbapenem among Gram-negative bacilli in some
communities and healthcare settings. Within regions in
which the prevalence of such drug-resistant organisms is
significant, empiric therapy adequate to cover these pathogens is warranted.
Clinicians should also consider whether candidemia is
a likely pathogen when choosing initial therapy. When
deemed warranted, the selection of empirical antifungal
therapy (e.g., an echinocandin, triazoles such as fluconazole, or a formulation of amphotericin B) should be
tailored to the local pattern of the most prevalent Candida
species and any recent exposure to antifungal drugs [78].
Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
guidelines recommend either fluconazole or an echinocandin. Empiric use of an echinocandin is preferred in
most patients with severe illness, especially in those
patients who have recently been treated with antifungal
agents, or if Candida glabrata infection is suspected from
earlier culture data. Knowledge of local resistance patterns to antifungal agents should guide drug selection
until fungal susceptibility test results, if available, are
performed. Risk factors for candidemia, such as immunosuppressed or neutropenic state, prior intense antibiotic
therapy, or colonization in multiple sites, should also be
considered when choosing initial therapy.
Because patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have
little margin for error in the choice of therapy, the initial
selection of antimicrobial therapy should be broad enough
to cover all likely pathogens. Antibiotic choices should be
guided by local prevalence patterns of bacterial pathogens
and susceptibility data. Ample evidence exists that failure to
initiate appropriate therapy (i.e., therapy with activity
against the pathogen that is subsequently identified as the
causative agent) correlates with increased morbidity and
mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [68,
71, 79, 80]. Recent exposure to antimicrobials (within last
3 months) should be considered in the choice of an empiric
antibacterial regimen. Patients with severe sepsis or septic
shock warrant broad-spectrum therapy until the causative
organism and its antimicrobial susceptibilities are defined.
Although a global restriction of antibiotics is an important
strategy to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance and to reduce cost, it is not an appropriate strategy in
the initial therapy for this patient population. However, as
soon as the causative pathogen has been identified, deescalation should be performed by selecting the most
appropriate antimicrobial agent that covers the pathogen
and is safe and cost-effective. Collaboration with antimicrobial stewardship programs, where they exist, is
encouraged to ensure appropriate choices and rapid availability of effective antimicrobials for treating septic
patients. All patients should receive a full loading dose of
each agent. Patients with sepsis often have abnormal and
vacillating renal or hepatic function, or may have abnormally high volumes of distribution due to aggressive fluid
resuscitation, requiring dose adjustment. Drug serum concentration monitoring can be useful in an ICU setting for
those drugs that can be measured promptly. Significant
expertise is required to ensure that serum concentrations
maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity [81, 82].
2b. The antimicrobial regimen should be reassessed daily
for potential de-escalation to prevent the development of resistance, to reduce toxicity, and to reduce
costs (grade 1B).
Rationale. Once the causative pathogen has been identified, the most appropriate antimicrobial agent that
covers the pathogen and is safe and cost-effective should
be selected. On occasion, continued use of specific
combinations of antimicrobials might be indicated even
after susceptibility testing is available (e.g., Pseudomonas
spp. only susceptible to aminoglycosides; enterococcal
176

endocarditis; Acinetobacterspp. infections susceptible only
to polymyxins). Decisions on definitive antibiotic choices
should be based on the type of pathogen, patient characteristics, and favored hospital treatment regimens.
Narrowing the spectrum of antimicrobial coverage and
reducing the duration of antimicrobial therapy will reduce
the likelihood that the patient will develop superinfection
with other pathogenic or resistant organisms, such as
Candida species, Clostridium difficile, or vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium. However, the desire to
minimize superinfections and other complications should
not take precedence over giving an adequate course of
therapy to cure the infection that caused the severe sepsis
or septic shock.
3. We suggest the use of low procalcitonin levels or
similar biomarkers to assist the clinician in the discontinuation of empiric antibiotics in patients who
appeared septic, but have no subsequent evidence of
infection (grade 2C).
Rationale. This suggestion is predicated on the preponderance of the published literature relating to the use of
procalcitonin as a tool to discontinue unnecessary antimicrobials [58, 83]. However, clinical experience with this
strategy is limited and the potential for harm remains a
concern [83]. No evidence demonstrates that this practice
reduces the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance or the risk
of antibiotic-related diarrhea from C. difficile. One recent
study failed to show any benefit of daily procalcitonin
measurement in early antibiotic therapy or survival [84].
4a. Empiric therapy should attempt to provide antimicrobial activity against the most likely pathogens
based upon each patient’s presenting illness and local
patterns of infection. We suggest combination empiric
therapy for neutropenic patients with severe sepsis
(grade 2B) and for patients with difficult-to- treat,
multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens such as Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. (grade 2B). For
selected patients with severe infections associated with
respiratory failure and septic shock, combination therapy with an extended spectrum beta-lactam and either
an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone is suggested for
P. aeruginosa bacteremia (grade 2B). Similarly, a more
complex combination of beta-lactam and a macrolide is
suggested for patients with septic shock from bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (grade 2B).
Rationale. Complex combinations might be needed in
settings where highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens are
prevalent, with such regimens incorporating carbapenems, colistin, rifampin, or other agents. However, a recent
controlled trial suggested that adding a fluoroquinolone to
a carbapenem as empiric therapy did not improve outcome in a population at low risk for infection with
resistant microorganisms [85].
4b. We suggest that combination therapy, when used
empirically in patients with severe sepsis, should not
be administered for longer than 3–5 days. De-escalation to the most appropriate single-agent therapy
should be performed as soon as the susceptibility
profile is known (grade 2B). Exceptions would
include aminoglycoside monotherapy, which should
be generally avoided, particularly for P. aeruginosa
sepsis, and for selected forms of endocarditis, where
prolonged courses of combinations of antibiotics are
warranted.
Rationale. A propensity-matched analysis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis, along with additional
observational studies, have demonstrated that combination therapy produces a superior clinical outcome in
severely ill, septic patients with a high risk of death [86–
90]. In light of the increasing frequency of resistance to
antimicrobial agents in many parts of the world, broadspectrum coverage generally requires the initial use of
combinations of antimicrobial agents. Combination therapy used in this context connotes at least two different
classes of antibiotics (usually a beta-lactam agent with a
macrolide, fluoroquinolone, or aminoglycoside for select
patients). A controlled trial suggested, however, that
when using a carbapenem as empiric therapy in a population at low risk for infection with resistant
microorganisms, the addition of a fluoroquinolone does
not improve outcomes of patients [85]. A number of other
recent observational studies and some small, prospective
trials support initial combination therapy for selected
patients with specific pathogens (e.g., pneumococcal
sepsis, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens)
[91–93], but evidence from adequately powered, randomized clinical trials is not available to support
combination over monotherapy other than in septic
patients at high risk of death. In some clinical scenarios,
combination therapies are biologically plausible and are
likely clinically useful even if evidence has not demonstrated improved clinical outcome [89, 90, 94, 95].
Combination therapy for suspected or known Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other multiresistant Gram-negative
pathogens, pending susceptibility results, increases the
likelihood that at least 1 drug is effective against that
strain and positively affects outcome [88, 96].
5. We suggest that the duration of therapy typically be
7–10 days if clinically indicated; longer courses may
be appropriate in patients who have a slow clinical
response, undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with
S. aureus; some fungal and viral infections, or immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia (grade 2C).
Rationale. Although patient factors may influence the
length of antibiotic therapy, in general, a duration of 7–10
days (in the absence of source control issues) is adequate.
177

Thus, decisions to continue, narrow, or stop antimicrobial
therapy must be made on the basis of clinician judgment
and clinical information. Clinicians should be cognizant
of blood cultures being negative in a significant percentage of cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, despite the
fact that many of these cases are very likely caused by
bacteria or fungi. Clinicians should be cognizant that
blood cultures will be negative in a significant percentage
of cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, despite many of
these cases are very likely caused by bacteria or fungi.
6. We suggest that antiviral therapy be initiated as early
as possible in patients with severe sepsis or septic
shock of viral origin (grade 2C).
Rationale. Recommendations for antiviral treatment
include the use of: a) early antiviral treatment of suspected or confirmed influenza among persons with severe
influenza (e.g., those who have severe, complicated, or
progressive illness or who require hospitalization); b)
early antiviral treatment of suspected or confirmed influenza among persons at higher risk for influenza
complications; and c) therapy with a neuraminidase
inhibitor (oseltamivir or zanamivir) for persons with
influenza caused by 2009 H1N1 virus, influenza A
(H3N2) virus, or influenza B virus, or when the influenza
virus type or influenza A virus subtype is unknown [97,
98]. Susceptibility to antivirals is highly variable in a
rapidly evolving virus such as influenza, and therapeutic
decisions must be guided by updated information
regarding the most active, strain-specific, antiviral agents
during influenza epidemics [99, 100].
The role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpesviruses as significant pathogens in septic patients,
especially those not known to be severely immunocompromised, remains unclear. Active CMV viremia is
common (15–35 %) in critically ill patients; the presence
of CMV in the bloodstream has been repeatedly found to
be a poor prognostic indicator [101, 102]. What is not
known is whether CMV simply is a marker of disease
severity or if the virus actually contributes to organ injury
and death in septic patients [103]. No treatment recommendations can be given based on the current level of
evidence. In those patients with severe primary or generalized varicella-zoster virus infections, and in rare
patients with disseminated herpes simplex infections,
antiviral agents such as acyclovir can be highly effective
when initiated early in the course of infection [104].
7. We recommend that antimicrobial agents not be used
in patients with severe inflammatory states determined
to be of noninfectious cause (UG).
Rationale. When infection is found not to be present,
antimicrobial therapy should be stopped promptly to
minimize the likelihood that the patient will become
infected with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen or will
develop a drug-related adverse effect. Although it is
important to stop unnecessary antibiotics early, clinicians
should be cognizant that blood cultures will be negative in
more than 50 % of cases of severe sepsis or septic shock
if the patients are receiving empiric antimicrobial therapy;
yet many of these cases are very likely caused by bacteria
or fungi. Thus, the decisions to continue, narrow, or stop
antimicrobial therapy must be made on the basis of clinician judgment and clinical information.
E. Source control
1. We recommend that a specific anatomical diagnosis of
infection requiring consideration for emergent source
control (e.g., necrotizing soft tissue infection, peritonitis,
cholangitis, intestinal infarction) be sought and diagnosed
or excluded as rapidly as possible, and intervention be
undertaken for source control within the first 12 h after
the diagnosis is made, if feasible (grade 1C).
2. We suggest that when infected peripancreatic necrosis is
identified as a potential source of infection, definitive
intervention is best delayed until adequate demarcation
of viable and nonviable tissues has occurred (grade 2B).
3. When source control in a severely septic patient is
required, the effective intervention associated with the
least physiologic insult should be used (e.g., percutaneous rather than surgical drainage of an abscess) (UG).
4. If intravascular access devices are a possible source of
severe sepsis or septic shock, they should be removed
promptly after other vascular access has been established (UG).
Rationale. The principles of source control in the
management of sepsis include a rapid diagnosis of the
specific site of infection and identification of a focus of
infection amenable to source control measures (specifically the drainage of an abscess, debridement of infected
necrotic tissue, removal of a potentially infected device,
and definitive control of a source of ongoing microbial
contamination) [105]. Foci of infection readily amenable
to source control measures include an intra-abdominal
abscess or gastrointestinal perforation, cholangitis or
pyelonephritis, intestinal ischemia or necrotizing soft
tissue infection, and other deep space infection, such as an
empyema or septic arthritis. Such infectious foci should
be controlled as soon as possible following successful
initial resuscitation [106–108], and intravascular access
devices that are potentially the source of severe sepsis or
septic shock should be removed promptly after establishing other sites for vascular access [109, 110].
An RCT comparing early to delayed surgical intervention for peripancreatic necrosis showed better
outcomes with a delayed approach [111]. Moreover, a
randomized surgical study found that a minimally
178

invasive, step-up approach was better tolerated by
patients and had a lower mortality than open necrosectomy in necrotizing pancreatitis [112], although areas of
uncertainty exist, such as definitive documentation of
infection and appropriate length of delay. The selection of
optimal source control methods must weigh the benefits
and risks of the specific intervention as well as risks of
transfer [113]. Source control interventions may cause
further complications, such as bleeding, fistulas, or inadvertent organ injury. Surgical intervention should be
considered when other interventional approaches are
inadequate or when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite
radiologic evaluation. Specific clinical situations require
consideration of available choices, the patient’s preferences, and the clinician’s expertise.
F. Infection prevention
1. We suggest that selective oral decontamination (SOD)
and selective digestive decontamination (SDD) should
be introduced and investigated as a method to reduce
the incidence of VAP; this infection control measure
can then be instituted in healthcare settings and regions
where this methodology is found to be effective (grade
2B).
2. We suggest oral chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) be
used as a form of oropharyngeal decontamination to
reduce the risk of VAP in ICU patients with severe
sepsis (grade 2B).
Rationale. Careful infection control practices (e.g., hand
washing, expert nursing care, catheter care, barrier precautions, airway management, elevation of the head of the
bed, subglottic suctioning) should be instituted during the
care of septic patients as reviewed in the nursing considerations for the SSC [114]. The role of SDD with
systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis and its variants (e.g.,
SOD, CHG) has been a contentious issue ever since the
concept was first developed more than 30 years ago. The
notion of limiting the acquisition of opportunistic, often
multiresistant, healthcare-associated microorganisms has
its appeal by promoting ‘‘colonization resistance’’ from
the resident microbiome existing along mucosal surfaces
of the alimentary tract. However, the efficacy of SDD, its
safety, propensity to prevent or promote antibiotic resistance, and cost-effectiveness remain debatable despite a
number of favorable meta-analyses and controlled clinical
trials [115]. The data indicate an overall reduction in VAP
but no consistent improvement in mortality, except in
selected populations in some studies. Most studies do not
specifically address the efficacy of SDD in patients who
present with sepsis, but some do [116–118].
Oral CHG is relatively easy to administer, decreases
risk of nosocomial infection, and reduces the potential
concern over promotion of antimicrobial resistance by
SDD regimens. This remains a subject of considerable
debate, despite the recent evidence that the incidence of
antimicrobial resistance does not change appreciably with
current SDD regimens [119–121]. The grade 2B was
designated for both SOD and CHG as it was felt that risk
was lower with CHG and the measure better accepted
despite less published literature than with SOD.

Hemodynamic support and adjunctive therapy
(Table 6)
G. Fluid therapy of severe sepsis
1. We recommend crystalloids be used as the initial fluid
of choice in the resuscitation of severe sepsis and
septic shock (grade 1B).
2. We recommend against the use of hydroxyethyl
starches (HES) for fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis
and septic shock (grade 1B). (This recommendation is
based on the results of the VISEP [128], CRYSTMAS
[122], 6S [123], and CHEST [124] trials. The results of
the recently completed CRYSTAL trial were not
considered.)
3. We suggest the use of albumin in the fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock when patients
require substantial amounts of crystalloids (grade 2C).
Rationale. The absence of any clear benefit following
the administration of colloid solutions compared to
crystalloid solutions, together with the expense associated
with colloid solutions, supports a high-grade recommendation for the use of crystalloid solutions in the initial
resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock.
Three recent multicenter RCTs evaluating 6 % HES
130/0.4 solutions (tetra starches) have been published.
The CRYSTMAS study demonstrated no difference in
mortality with HES versus 0.9 % normal saline (31 vs.
25.3 %, P = 0.37) in the resuscitation of septic shock
patients; however, the study was underpowered to detect
the 6 % difference in absolute mortality observed [122].
In a sicker patient cohort, a Scandinavian multicenter
study in septic patients (6S Trial Group) showed
increased mortality rates with 6 % HES 130/0.42 fluid
resuscitation compared to Ringer’s acetate (51 vs. 43 %.
P = 0.03) [123]. The CHEST study, conducted in a heterogenous population of patients admitted to intensive
care (HES vs. isotonic saline, n = 7000 critically ill
patients), showed no difference in 90-day mortality
between resuscitation with 6 % HES with a molecular
weight of 130 kD/0.40 and isotonic saline (18 vs. 17 %,
179

P = 0.26); the need for renal replacement therapy was
higher in the HES group [7.0 vs. 5.8 %; relative risk (RR),
1.21; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.45;
P = 0.04] [124]. A meta-analysis of 56 randomized trials
found no overall difference in mortality between crystalloids and artificial colloids (modified gelatins, HES,
dextran) when used for initial fluid resuscitation [125].
Information from 3 randomized trials (n = 704 patients
with severe sepsis/septic shock) did not show survival
benefit with use of heta-, hexa-, or pentastarches compared to other fluids (RR, 1.15; 95 % CI, 0.95–1.39;
random effect; I2 = 0 %) [126–128]. However, these
solutions increased substantially the risk of acute kidney
injury (RR, 1.60; 95 % CI, 1.26–2.04; I2 = 0 %) [126–
128]. The evidence of harm observed in the 6S and
CHEST studies and the meta-analysis supports a highlevel recommendation advising against the use of HES
solutions in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock,
particularly since other options for fluid resuscitation
exist. The CRYSTAL trial, another large prospective
clinical trial comparing crystalloids and colloids, was
recently completed and will provide additional insight
into HES fluid resuscitation.
The SAFE study indicated that albumin administration
was safe and equally as effective as 0.9 % saline [129]. A
meta-analysis aggregated data from 17 randomized trials
(n = 1977) of albumin versus other fluid solutions in
patients with severe sepsis/septic shock [130]; 279 deaths
occurred among 961 albumin-treated patients versus 343
deaths among 1,016 patients treated with other fluids, thus
favoring albumin [odds ratio (OR), 0.82; 95 % CI,
0.67–1.00; I2 = 0 %]. When albumin-treated patients
were compared with those receiving crystalloids (7 trials,
n = 1441), the OR of dying was significantly reduced for
albumin-treated patients (OR, 0.78; 95 % CI, 0.62–0.99;
I
2 = 0 %). A multicenter randomized trial (n = 794) in
patients with septic shock compared intravenous albumin
(20 g, 20 %) every 8 h for 3 days to intravenous saline
solution [130]; albumin therapy was associated with
2.2 % absolute reduction in 28-day mortality (from 26.3
Table 6 Recommendations: hemodynamic support and adjunctive therapy
G. Fluid therapy of severe sepsis
1. Crystalloids as the initial fluid of choice in the resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock (grade 1B).
2. Against the use of hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock (grade 1B).
3. Albumin in the fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock when patients require substantial amounts of crystalloids (grade
2C).
4. Initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion with suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30
mL/kg of crystalloids (a portion of this may be albumin equivalent). More rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be
needed in some patients (grade 1C).
5. Fluid challenge technique be applied wherein fluid administration is continued as long as there is hemodynamic improvement either
based on dynamic (e.g., change in pulse pressure, stroke volume variation) or static (eg, arterial pressure, heart rate) variables (UG).
H. Vasopressors
1. Vasopressor therapy initially to target a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg (grade 1C).
2. Norepinephrine as the first choice vasopressor (grade 1B).
3. Epinephrine (added to and potentially substituted for norepinephrine) when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood
pressure (grade 2B).
4. Vasopressin 0.03 units/minute can be added to norepinephrine (NE) with intent of either raising MAP or decreasing NE dosage (UG).
5. Low dose vasopressin is not recommended as the single initial vasopressor for treatment of sepsis-induced hypotension and
vasopressin doses higher than 0.03-0.04 units/minute should be reserved for salvage therapy (failure to achieve adequate MAP with
other vasopressor agents) (UG).
6. Dopamine as an alternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in highly selected patients (eg, patients with low risk of
tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia) (grade 2C).
7. Phenylephrine is not recommended in the treatment of septic shock except in circumstances where (a) norepinephrine is associated
with serious arrhythmias, (b) cardiac output is known to be high and blood pressure persistently low or (c) as salvage therapy when
combined inotrope/vasopressor drugs and low dose vasopressin have failed to achieve MAP target (grade 1C).
8. Low-dose dopamine should not be used for renal protection (grade 1A).
9. All patients requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as practical if resources are available (UG).
I. Inotropic therapy
1. A trial of dobutamine infusion up to 20 micrograms/kg/min be administered or added to vasopressor (if in use) in the presence of
(a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of
hypoperfusion, despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate MAP (grade 1C).
2. Not using a strategy to increase cardiac index to predetermined supranormal levels (grade 1B).
J. Corticosteroids
1. Not using intravenous hydrocortisone to treat adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are
able to restore hemodynamic stability (see goals for Initial Resuscitation). In case this is not achievable, we suggest intravenous
hydrocortisone alone at a dose of 200 mg per day (grade 2C).
2. Not using the ACTH stimulation test to identify adults with septic shock who should receive hydrocortisone (grade 2B).
3. In treated patients hydrocortisone tapered when vasopressors are no longer required (grade 2D).
4. Corticosteroids not be administered for the treatment of sepsis in the absence of shock (grade 1D).
5. When hydrocortisone is given, use continuous flow (grade 2D).
180

to 24.1 %), but did not achieve statistical significance.
These data support a low-level recommendation regarding
the use of albumin in patients with sepsis and septic shock
(personal communication from J.P. Mira and as presented
at the 32nd International ISICEM Congress 2012, Brussels and the 25th ESICM Annual Congress 2012, Lisbon).
4. We recommend an initial fluid challenge in patients
with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion with suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/
kg of crystalloids (a portion of this may be albumin
equivalent). More rapid administration and greater
amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (see
Initial Resuscitation recommendations) (grade 1C).
5. We recommend that a fluid challenge technique be
applied wherein fluid administration is continued as long
as there is hemodynamic improvement either based on
dynamic (e.g., change in pulse pressure, stroke volume
variation) or static (e.g., arterial pressure, heart rate)
variables (UG).
Rationale. Dynamic tests to assess patients’ responsiveness to fluid replacement have become very popular in
recent years in the ICU [131]. These tests are based on
monitoring changes in stroke volume during mechanical
ventilation or after passive leg raising in spontaneously
breathing patients. A systematic review (29 trials, n = 685
critically ill patients) looked at the association between
stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and/or
stroke volume variation and the change in stroke volume/
cardiac index after a fluid or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) challenge [132]. The diagnostic OR of fluid
responsiveness was 59.86 (14 trials, 95 % CI,
23.88–150.05) and 27.34 (5 trials, 95 % CI, 3.46–55.53) for
the pulse pressure variation and the stroke volume variation,
respectively. Utility of pulse pressure variation and stroke
volume variation is limited in the presence of atrial fibrillation, spontaneous breathing, and low pressure support
breathing. These techniques generally require sedation.
H. Vasopressors
1. We recommend that vasopressor therapy initially target a MAP of 65 mmHg (grade 1C).
Rationale. Vasopressor therapy is required to sustain
life and maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening
hypotension, even when hypovolemia has not yet been
resolved. Below a threshold MAP, autoregulation in
critical vascular beds can be lost, and perfusion can
become linearly dependent on pressure. Thus, some
patients may require vasopressor therapy to achieve a
minimal perfusion pressure and maintain adequate flow
[133, 134]. The titration of norepinephrine to a MAP as
low as 65 mmHg has been shown to preserve tissue
perfusion [134]. Note that the consensus definition of
sepsis-induced hypotension for use of MAP in the diagnosis of severe sepsis is different (MAP \70 mmHg)
from the evidence-based target of 65 mmHg used in this
recommendation. In any case, the optimal MAP should be
individualized as it may be higher in patients with atherosclerosis and/or previous hypertension than in young
patients without cardiovascular comorbidity. For example, a MAP of 65 mmHg might be too low in a patient
with severe uncontrolled hypertension; in a young, previously normotensive patient, a lower MAP might be
adequate. Supplementing endpoints, such as blood pressure, with assessment of regional and global perfusion,
such as blood lactate concentrations, skin perfusion,
mental status, and urine output, is important. Adequate
fluid resuscitation is a fundamental aspect of the hemodynamic management of patients with septic shock and
should ideally be achieved before vasopressors and inotropes are used; however, using vasopressors early as an
emergency measure in patients with severe shock is frequently necessary, as when diastolic blood pressure is
too low. When that occurs, great effort should be
directed to weaning vasopressors with continuing fluid
resuscitation.
2. We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice
vasopressor (grade 1B).
3. We suggest epinephrine (added to and potentially
substituted for norepinephrine) when an additional
agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure
(grade 2B).
4. Vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) can be added to
norepinephrine with the intent of raising MAP to target
or decreasing norepinephrine dosage (UG).
5. Low-dose vasopressin is not recommended as the
single initial vasopressor for treatment of sepsisinduced hypotension, and vasopressin doses higher
than 0.03–0.04 U/min should be reserved for salvage
therapy (failure to achieve an adequate MAP with
other vasopressor agents) (UG).
6. We suggest dopamine as an alternative vasopressor
agent to norepinephrine only in highly selected
patients (e.g., patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia) (grade 2C).
7. Phenylephrine is not recommended in the treatment of
septic shock except in the following circumstances:
(a) norepinephrine is associated with serious arrhythmias, (b) cardiac output is known to be high and blood
pressure persistently low, or (c) as salvage therapy
when combined inotrope/vasopressor drugs and lowdose vasopressin have failed to achieve the MAP
target (grade 1C).
Rationale. The physiologic effects of vasopressor and
combined inotrope/vasopressors selection in septic shock
are set out in an extensive number of literature entries
[135–147]. Table 7 depicts a GRADEpro Summary of
181

Evidence Table comparing dopamine and norepinephrine
in the treatment of septic shock. Dopamine increases
MAP and cardiac output, primarily due to an increase in
stroke volume and heart rate. Norepinephrine increases
MAP due to its vasoconstrictive effects, with little change
in heart rate and less increase in stroke volume compared
with dopamine. Norepinephrine is more potent than
dopamine and may be more effective at reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may be
particularly useful in patients with compromised systolic
function but causes more tachycardia and may be more
arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine [148]. It may also
influence the endocrine response via the hypothalamic
pituitary axis and have immunosuppressive effects.
However, information from five randomized trials
(n = 1,993 patients with septic shock) comparing norepinephrine to dopamine does not support the routine use
of dopamine in the management of septic shock [136, 149–
152]. Indeed, the relative risk of short-term mortality was
0.91 (95 % CI, 0.84–1.00; fixed effect; I2 = 0 %) in favor of
norepinephrine. A recent meta-analysis showed dopamine
was associated with an increased risk [RR, 1.10 (1.01–1.20);
P = 0.035]; in the two trials that reported arrhythmias, these
were more frequent with dopamine than with norepinephrine
[RR, 2.34 (1.46–3.77); P = 0.001] [153].
Although some human and animal studies suggest epinephrine has deleterious effects on splanchnic circulation
and produces hyperlactatemia, no clinical evidence shows
that epinephrine results in worse outcomes, and it should be
the first alternative to norepinephrine. Indeed, information
from 4 randomized trials (n = 540) comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine found no evidence for differences in
the risk of dying (RR, 0.96; CI, 0.77–1.21; fixed effect;
I
2 = 0 %) [142, 147, 154, 155]. Epinephrine may increase
aerobic lactate production via stimulation of skeletal muscles’ b2-adrenergic receptors and thus may prevent the use
of lactate clearance to guide resuscitation. With its almost
pure a-adrenergic effects, phenylephrine is the adrenergic
agent least likely to produce tachycardia, but it may
decrease stroke volume and is therefore not recommended
for use in the treatment of septic shock except in circumstances where norepinephrine is: (a) associated with serious
arrhythmias, or (b) cardiac output is known to be high, or
(c) as salvage therapy when other vasopressor agents have
failed to achieve target MAP [156]. Vasopressin levels in
septic shock have been reported to be lower than anticipated
for a shock state [157]. Low doses of vasopressin may be
effective in raising blood pressure in patients, refractory to
other vasopressors and may have other potential physiologic
benefits [158–163]. Terlipressin has similar effects but is
long acting [164]. Studies show that vasopressin concentrations are elevated in early septic shock, but decrease to
normal range in the majority of patients between 24 and
48 h as shock continues [165]. This has been called relative

vasopressin deficiency because in the presence of hypotension, vasopressin would be expected to be elevated. The
significance of this finding is unknown. The VASST trial, a
randomized, controlled trial comparing norepinephrine
alone to norepinephrine plus vasopressin at 0.03 U/min,
showed no difference in outcome in the intent-to-treat
population [166]. An a priori defined subgroup analysis
demonstrated that survival among patients receiving
\15 lg/min norepinephrine at the time of randomization
was better with the addition of vasopressin; however, the
pretrial rationale for this stratification was based on
exploring potential benefit in the population requiring
C15 lg/min norepinephrine. Higher doses of vasopressin
have been associated with cardiac, digital, and splanchnic
ischemia and should be reserved for situations where
alternative vasopressors have failed [167]. Information
from 7 trials (n = 963 patients with septic shock) comparing norepinephrine with vasopressin (or terlipressin) does
not support the routine use of vasopressin or its analog terlipressin [93, 95, 97, 99, 159, 161, 164, 166, 168–170].
Indeed, the relative risk of dying was 1.12 (95 % CI,
0.96–1.30; fixed effects; I2 = 0 %). However, the risk of
supraventricular arrhythmias was increased with norepinephrine (RR, 7.25; 95 % CI, 2.30–22.90; fixed effect;
I
2 = 0 %). Cardiac output measurement targeting maintenance of a normal or elevated flow is desirable when these
pure vasopressors are instituted.
8. We recommend that low-dose dopamine not be used
for renal protection (grade 1A).
Rationale. A large randomized trial and meta-analysis
comparing low-dose dopamine to placebo found no difference in either primary outcomes (peak serum
creatinine, need for renal replacement, urine output, time
to recovery of normal renal function) or secondary outcomes (survival to either ICU or hospital discharge, ICU
stay, hospital stay, arrhythmias) [171, 172]. Thus, the
available data do not support administration of low doses
of dopamine solely to maintain renal function.
9. We recommend that all patients requiring vasopressors
have an arterial catheter placed as soon as practical if
resources are available (UG).
Rationale. In shock states, estimation of blood pressure
using a cuff is commonly inaccurate; use of an arterial cannula
provides a more appropriate and reproducible measurement
of arterial pressure. These catheters also allow continuous
analysis so that decisions regarding therapy can be based on
immediate and reproducible blood pressure information.
I. Inotropic therapy
1. We recommend that a trial of dobutamine infusion up
to 20 lg kg-1 min-1 be administered or added to
vasopressor (if in use) in the presence of: (a) myocardial
dysfunction, as suggested by elevated cardiac filling
pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of
hypoperfusion, despite achieving adequate intravascular
volume and adequate MAP (grade 1C).
2. We recommend against the use of a strategy to
increase cardiac index to predetermined supranormal
levels (grade 1B).
Rationale. Dobutamine is the first choice inotrope for
patients with measured or suspected low cardiac output in
the presence of adequate left ventricular filling pressure
(or clinical assessment of adequate fluid resuscitation) and
adequate MAP. Septic patients who remain hypotensive
after fluid resuscitation may have low, normal, or
increased cardiac outputs. Therefore, treatment with a
combined inotrope/vasopressor, such as norepinephrine or
epinephrine, is recommended if cardiac output is not
measured. When the capability exists for monitoring
cardiac output in addition to blood pressure, a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, may be used separately to
target specific levels of MAP and cardiac output. Large
prospective clinical trials, which included critically ill
ICU patients who had severe sepsis, failed to demonstrate
benefit from increasing oxygen delivery to supranormal
targets by use of dobutamine [173, 174]. These studies did
not specifically target patients with severe sepsis and did
not target the first 6 h of resuscitation. If evidence of
tissue hypoperfusion persists despite adequate intravascular volume and adequate MAP, a viable alternative
(other than reversing underlying insult) is to add inotropic
therapy.
J. Corticosteroids
1. We suggest not using intravenous hydrocortisone as a
treatment of adult septic shock patients if adequate
fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to
restore hemodynamic stability (see goals for Initial
Resuscitation). If this is not achievable, we suggest
intravenous hydrocortisone alone at a dose of 200 mg
per day (grade 2C).
Rationale. The response of septic shock patients to fluid
and vasopressor therapy seems to be an important factor
in selection of patients for optional hydrocortisone therapy. One French multicenter RCT of patients in
vasopressor-unresponsive septic shock (hypotension
despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for more than
60 min) showed significant shock reversal and reduction
of mortality rate in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency [defined as postadrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) cortisol increase B9 lg/dL] [175]. Two smaller
RCTs also showed significant effects on shock reversal
with steroid therapy [176, 177]. In contrast, a large,
183

European multicenter trial (CORTICUS) that enrolled
patients without sustained shock and had a lower risk of
death than the French trial failed to show a mortality
benefit with steroid therapy [178]. Unlike the French trial
that only enrolled shock patients with blood pressure
unresponsive to vasopressor therapy, the CORTICUS
study included patients with septic shock regardless of
how the blood pressure responded to vasopressors; the
study baseline (placebo) 28-day mortality rate was 61 and
31 %, respectively. The use of the ACTH test (responders
and nonresponders) did not predict the faster resolution of
shock. In recent years, several systematic reviews have
examined the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in septic
shock with contradictory results: Annane et al. [179]
analyzed the results of 12 studies and calculated a significant reduction in 28-day mortality with prolonged
low-dose steroid treatment in adult septic shock patients
(RR, 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.72–0.97; P = 0.02). In parallel,
Sligl and colleagues [180] used a similar technique, but
only identified eight studies for their meta-analysis, six of
which had a high-level RCT design with low risk of bias
[181]. In contrast to the aforementioned review, this
analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in
mortality (RR, 1.00; 95 % CI, 0.84–1.18). Both reviews,
however, confirmed the improved shock reversal by using
low-dose hydrocortisone [180, 181]. A recent review on
the use of steroids in adult septic shock underlined the
importance of selection of studies for systematic analysis
[181] and identified only 6 high-level RCTs as adequate
for systematic review [175–178, 182, 183]. When only
these six studies are analyzed, we found that in ‘‘low risk’’
patients from three studies (i.e., those with a placebo
mortality rate of less than 50 %, which represents the
majority of all patients), hydrocortisone failed to show
any benefit on outcome (RR 1.06). The minority of patients
from the remaining three studies, who had a placebo mortality of greater than 60 %, showed a nonsignificant trend to
lower mortality by using hydrocortisone. See Supplemental
Digital Content 4, Summary of Evidence Table.
2. We suggest not using the ACTH stimulation test to
identify the subset of adults with septic shock who
should receive hydrocortisone (grade 2B).
Rationale. In one study, the observation of a potential
interaction between steroid use and ACTH test was not
statistically significant [175]. Furthermore, no evidence of
this distinction was observed between responders and
nonresponders in a recent multicenter trial [178]. Random
cortisol levels may still be useful for absolute adrenal
insufficiency; however, for septic shock patients who
suffer from relative adrenal insufficiency (no adequate
stress response), random cortisol levels have not been
demonstrated to be useful. Cortisol immunoassays may
over- or underestimate the actual cortisol level, affecting
the assignment of patients to responders or nonresponders
[184]. Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is
now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction
for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis [185, 186]. Moreover, a subanalysis of the
CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate
before application of low-dose steroids was associated
with an increased 28-day mortality rate [187]. An inappropriately low random cortisol level (\18 lg/dL) in a
patient with shock would be considered an indication for
steroid therapy along traditional adrenal insufficiency
guidelines.
3. We suggest that clinicians taper the treated patient
from steroid therapy when vasopressors are no longer
required (grade 2D).
Rationale. There has been no comparative study
between a fixed-duration and clinically guided regimen or
between tapering and abrupt cessation of steroids. Three
RCTs used a fixed-duration protocol for treatment [175,
177, 178], and therapy was decreased after shock resolution in two RCTs [176, 182]. In four studies, steroids
were tapered over several days [176–178, 182], and steroids were withdrawn abruptly in two RCTs [175, 183].
One crossover study showed hemodynamic and immunologic rebound effects after abrupt cessation of
corticosteroids [188]. Furthermore, a study revealed that
there is no difference in outcome of septic shock patients
if low-dose hydrocortisone is used for 3 or 7 days; hence,
no recommendation can be given with regard to the
optimal duration of hydrocortisone therapy [189].
4. We recommend that corticosteroids not be administered for the treatment of sepsis in the absence of
shock (grade 1D).
Rationale. Steroids may be indicated in the presence of
a history of steroid therapy or adrenal dysfunction, but
whether low-dose steroids have a preventive potency in
reducing the incidence of severe sepsis and septic shock
in critically ill patients cannot be answered. A preliminary
study of stress-dose level steroids in community-acquired
pneumonia showed improved outcome measures in a
small population [190], and a recent confirmatory RCT
revealed reduced hospital length of stay without affecting
mortality [191].
5. When low-dose hydrocortisone is given, we suggest
using continuous infusion rather than repetitive bolus
injections (grade 2D).
Rationale. Several randomized trials on the use of lowdose hydrocortisone in septic shock patients revealed a
significant increase of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia
[175] as side effects. A small prospective study demonstrated that repetitive bolus application of hydrocortisone
leads to a significant increase in blood glucose; this peak
184

effect was not detectable during continuous infusion.
Furthermore, considerable inter-individual variability was
seen in this blood glucose peak after the hydrocortisone
bolus [192]. Although an association of hyperglycemia
and hypernatremia with patient outcome measures could
not be shown, good practice includes strategies for
avoidance and/or detection of these side effects.
Supportive therapy of severe sepsis (Table 8)
K. Blood product administration
1. Once tissue hypoperfusion has resolved and in the
absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or
ischemic coronary artery disease, we recommend that
red blood cell transfusion occur when the hemoglobin
concentration decreases to\7.0 g/dL to target a hemoglobin concentration of 7.0–9.0 g/dL in adults (grade
1B).
Rationale. Although the optimum hemoglobin concentration for patients with severe sepsis has not been
specifically investigated, the Transfusion Requirements in
Critical Care trial suggested that a hemoglobin level of
7–9 g/dL, compared with 10–12 g/dL, was not associated
with increased mortality in critically ill adults [193]. No
significant differences in 30-day mortality rates were
observed between treatment groups in the subgroup of
patients with severe infections and septic shock (22.8 and
29.7 %, respectively; P = 0.36),
Although less applicable to septic patients, results of a
randomized trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
with cardiopulmonary bypass support a restrictive transfusion strategy using a threshold hematocrit of \24 %
(hemoglobin & 8 g/dL) as equivalent to a transfusion
threshold of hematocrit of \30 % (hemoglobin & 10 g/
dL) [194]. Red blood cell transfusion in septic patients
increases oxygen delivery but does not usually increase
oxygen consumption [195–197]. The transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL contrasts with early goal-directed
resuscitation protocols that use a target hematocrit of
30 % in patients with low ScvO2 during the first 6 h of
resuscitation of septic shock [13].
2. We recommend not using erythropoietin as a specific
treatment of anemia associated with severe sepsis
(grade 1B).
Rationale. No specific information regarding erythropoietin use in septic patients is available, but clinical trials
of erythropoietin administration in critically ill patients
show some decrease in red cell transfusion requirement
with no effect on clinical outcome [198, 199]. The effect
of erythropoietin in severe sepsis and septic shock would
not be expected to be more beneficial than in other critical
conditions. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
may have coexisting conditions that meet indications for
the use of erythropoietin.
3. We suggest that fresh frozen plasma not be used to
correct laboratory clotting abnormalities in the absence
of bleeding or planned invasive procedures (grade 2D).
Rationale. Although clinical studies have not assessed
the impact of transfusion of fresh frozen plasma on outcomes in critically ill patients, professional organizations
have recommended it for coagulopathy when there is a
documented deficiency of coagulation factors (increased
prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, or partial thromboplastin time) and the presence of active
bleeding or before surgical or invasive procedures [200–
203]. In addition, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma
usually fails to correct the prothrombin time in nonbleeding patients with mild abnormalities [204, 205]. No
studies suggest that correction of more severe coagulation
abnormalities benefits patients who are not bleeding.
4. We recommend against antithrombin administration
for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock
(grade 1B).
Rationale. A phase III clinical trial of high-dose antithrombin did not demonstrate any beneficial effect on
28-day all-cause mortality in adults with severe sepsis and
septic shock. High-dose antithrombin was associated with
an increased risk of bleeding when administered with
heparin [206]. Although a post hoc subgroup analysis of
patients with severe sepsis and high risk of death showed
better survival in patients receiving antithrombin, this
agent cannot be recommended until further clinical trials
are performed [207].
5. In patients with severe sepsis, we suggest that platelets
be administered prophylactically when counts are
B10,000/mm3 (10 9 109
/L) in the absence of apparent
bleeding, as well when counts are B20,000/mm3
(20 9 109/L) if the patient has a significant risk of
bleeding. Higher platelet counts [C50,000/mm3
(50 9 109/L)] are advised for active bleeding, surgery,
or invasive procedures (grade 2D).
Rationale. Guidelines for transfusion of platelets are
derived from consensus opinion and experience in
patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
Patients with severe sepsis are likely to have some limitation of platelet production similar to that in
chemotherapy-treated patients, but they also are likely to
have increased platelet consumption. Recommendations
take into account the etiology of thrombocytopenia,
platelet dysfunction, risk of bleeding, and presence of
185

Table 8 Recommendations: other supportive therapy of severe sepsis
K. Blood product administration
1. Once tissue hypoperfusion has resolved and in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe
hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or ischemic heart disease, we recommend that red blood cell transfusion occur only when hemoglobin
concentration decreases to \7.0 g/dL to target a hemoglobin concentration of 7.0–9.0 g/dL in adults (grade 1B).
2. Not using erythropoietin as a specific treatment of anemia associated with severe sepsis (grade 1B).
3. Fresh frozen plasma not be used to correct laboratory clotting abnormalities in the absence of bleeding or planned invasive procedures
(grade 2D).
4. Not using antithrombin for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock (grade 1B).
5. In patients with severe sepsis, administer platelets prophylactically when counts are B10,000/mm3 (10 9 109
/L) in the absence of
apparent bleeding. We suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion when counts are B20,000/mm3 (20 9 109/L) if the patient has a
significant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts (C50,000/mm3 [50 9 109
/L]) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or invasive
procedures (grade 2D).
L. Immunoglobulins
1. Not using intravenous immunoglobulins in adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (grade 2B).
M. Selenium
1. Not using intravenous selenium for the treatment of severe sepsis (grade 2C).
N. History of Recommendations Regarding Use of Recombinant Activated Protein C (rhAPC)
A history of the evolution of SSC recommendations as to rhAPC (no longer available) is provided.
O. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
1. Target a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg).
2. Plateau pressures be measured in patients with ARDS and initial upper limit goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung
be B30 cm H2O (grade 1B).
3. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) be applied to avoid alveolar collapse at end expiration (atelectotrauma) (grade 1B).
4. Strategies based on higher rather than lower levels of PEEP be used for patients with sepsis- induced moderate or severe ARDS (grade
2C).
5. Recruitment maneuvers be used in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia (grade 2C).
6. Prone positioning be used in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio B100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience
with such practices (grade 2B).
7. That mechanically ventilated sepsis patients be maintained with the head of the bed elevated to 30–45 degrees to limit aspiration risk
and to prevent the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (grade 1B).
8. That noninvasive mask ventilation (NIV) be used in that minority of sepsis-induced ARDS patients in whom the benefits of NIV have
been carefully considered and are thought to outweigh the risks (grade 2B).
9. That a weaning protocol be in place and that mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis undergo spontaneous breathing trials
regularly to evaluate the ability to discontinue mechanical ventilation when they satisfy the following criteria: a) arousable; b)
hemodynamically stable (without vasopressor agents); c) no new potentially serious conditions; d) low ventilatory and end-expiratory
pressure requirements; and e) low FIo2 requirements which can be met safely delivered with a face mask or nasal cannula. If the
spontaneous breathing trial is successful, consideration should be given for extubation (grade 1A).
10. Against the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter for patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (grade 1A).
11. A conservative rather than liberal fluid strategy for patients with established sepsis-induced ARDS who do not have evidence of
tissue hypoperfusion (grade 1C).
12. In the absence of specific indications such as bronchospasm, not using beta 2-agonists for treatment of sepsis- induced ARDS. (Grade
1B).
P. Sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade in sepsis
1. Continuous or intermittent sedation be minimized in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients, targeting specific titration endpoints
(grade 1B).
2. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) be avoided if possible in the septic patient without ARDS due to the risk of prolonged
neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation. If NMBAs must be maintained, either intermittent bolus as required or continuous
infusion with train-of-four monitoring of the depth of blockade should be used (grade 1C).
3. A short course of NMBA of not greater than 48 hours for patients with early sepsis-induced ARDS and a PaO2/FIO2\150 mm Hg
(grade 2C).
Q. Glucose control
1. A protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU patients with severe sepsis commencing insulin dosing when 2
consecutive blood glucose levels are[180 mg/dL. This protocolized approach should target an upper blood glucose B180 mg/dL
rather than an upper target blood glucose B110 mg/dL (grade 1A).
2. blood glucose values be monitored every 1–2 hrs until glucose values and insulin infusion rates are stable and then every 4 hrs
thereafter (grade 1C).
3. glucose levels obtained with point-of-care testing of capillary blood be interpreted with caution, as such measurements may not
accurately estimate arterial blood or plasma glucose values (UG).
R. Renal replacement therapy
1. Continuous renal replacement therapies and intermittent hemodialysis are equivalent in patients with severe sepsis and acute renal
failure (grade 2B).
2. Use continuous therapies to facilitate management of fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable septic patients (grade 2D).
186

concomitant disorders [200, 202, 203, 208, 209]. Factors
that may increase the bleeding risk and indicate the need
for a higher platelet count are frequently present in
patients with severe sepsis. Sepsis itself is considered to
be a risk factor for bleeding in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Other factors considered
to increase the risk of bleeding in patients with severe
sepsis include temperature higher than 38 C, recent
minor hemorrhage, rapid decrease in platelet count, and
other coagulation abnormalities [203, 208, 209].
L. Immunoglobulins
1. We suggest not using intravenous immunoglobulins
in adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock
(grade 2B).
Rationale. One larger multicenter RCT (n = 624) [210]
in adult patients and one large multinational RCT in
infants with neonatal sepsis (n = 3,493) [211] found no
benefit for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). (For
more on this trial, see ‘‘Pediatric considerations in severe
sepsis’’.). A meta-analysis by the Cochrane collaboration,
which did not include this most recent RCT, identified 10
polyclonal IVIG trials (n = 1,430) and seven trials on
immunoglobulin (Ig) M-enriched polyclonal IVIG
(n = 528) [212]. Compared with placebo, IVIG resulted
in a significant reduction in mortality (RR, 0.81 and 95 %
CI, 0.70–0.93; and RR, 0.66 and 95 % CI, 0.51–0.85,
respectively). Also the subgroup of IgM-enriched IVIGs
(n = 7 trials) showed a significant reduction in mortality
rates compared with placebo (RR, 0.66; 95 % CI,
0.51–0.85). Trials with low risk of bias showed no
reduction in mortality with polyclonal IVIG (RR, 0.97;
95 % CI, 0.81–1.15; five trials, n = 945). Three of these
trials [210, 213, 214] used standard polyclonal IVIG and
two IgM-enriched IVIG [215, 216].
These findings are in accordance with those of 2 older
meta-analyses [217, 218] from other Cochrane authors.
One systematic review [217] included a total of 21 trials
and showed a relative risk of death of 0.77 with immunoglobulin treatment (95 % CI, 0.68–0.88); however, the
results of only high-quality trials (total of 763 patients)
showed a relative risk of 1.02 (95 % CI, 0.84–1.24).
Similarly, Laupland et al. [218] found a significant
reduction in mortality with the use of IVIG treatment
(OR, 0.66; 95 % CI, 0.53–0.83; P\0.005). When only
high-quality studies were pooled, the OR for mortality
was 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.71–1.3; P = 0.78). Two metaanalyses, which used less strict criteria to identify sources
Table 8 continued
S. Bicarbonate therapy
1. Not using sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients
with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with pH C7.15 (grade 2B).
T. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
1. Patients with severe sepsis receive daily pharmacoprophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) (grade 1B). This should be
accomplished with daily subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (grade 1B versus twice daily UFH, grade 2C versus
three times daily UFH). If creatinine clearance is \30 mL/min, use dalteparin (grade 1A) or another form of LMWH that has a low
degree of renal metabolism (grade 2C) or UFH (grade 1A).
2. Patients with severe sepsis be treated with a combination of pharmacologic therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression devices
whenever possible (grade 2C).
3. Septic patients who have a contraindication for heparin use (eg, thrombocytopenia, severe coagulopathy, active bleeding, recent
intracerebral hemorrhage) not receive pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 1B), but receive mechanical prophylactic treatment, such as
graduated compression stockings or intermittent compression devices (grade 2C), unless contraindicated. When the risk decreases start
pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 2C).
U. Stress ulcer prophylaxis
1. Stress ulcer prophylaxis using H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor be given to patients with severe sepsis/septic shock who have
bleeding risk factors (grade 1B).
2. When stress ulcer prophylaxis is used, proton pump inhibitors rather than H2RA (grade 2D)
3. Patients without risk factors do not receive prophylaxis (grade 2B).
V. Nutrition
1. Administer oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous
glucose within the first 48 hours after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (grade 2C).
2. Avoid mandatory full caloric feeding in the first week but rather suggest low dose feeding (e.g., up to 500 calories per day), advancing
only as tolerated (grade 2B).
3. Use intravenous glucose and enteral nutrition rather than total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alone or parenteral nutrition in conjunction
with enteral feeding in the first 7 days after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (grade 2B).
4. Use nutrition with no specific immunomodulating supplementation rather than nutrition providing specific immunomodulating
supplementation in patients with severe sepsis (grade 2C).
W. Setting goals of care
1. Discuss goals of care and prognosis with patients and families (grade 1B).
2. Incorporate goals of care into treatment and end-of-life care planning, utilizing palliative care principles where appropriate (grade 1B).
3. Address goals of care as early as feasible, but no later than within 72 hours of ICU admission (grade 2C).
187

of bias or did not state their criteria for the assessment of
study quality, found significant improvement in patient
mortality with IVIG treatment [219, 220]. In contrast to
the most recent Cochrane review, Kreymann et al. [219]
classified five studies that investigated IgM-enriched
preparation as high-quality studies, combining studies in
adults and neonates, and found an OR for mortality of 0.5
(95 % CI, 0.34–0.73).
Most IVIG studies are small, some have methodological flaws; the only large study (n = 624) showed no
effect [210]. Subgroup effects between IgM-enriched and
nonenriched formulations reveal substantial heterogeneity. In addition, indirectness and publication bias were
considered in grading this recommendation. The lowquality evidence led to the grading as a weak recommendation. The statistical information that comes from
the high-quality trials does not support a beneficial effect
of polyclonal IVIG. We encourage conducting large
multicenter studies to further evaluate the effectiveness of
other polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations given
intravenously in patients with severe sepsis.
M. Selenium
1. We suggest not using intravenous selenium to treat
severe sepsis (grade 2C).
Rationale. Selenium was administered in the hope that it
could correct the known reduction of selenium concentration in sepsis patients and provide a pharmacologic effect
through an antioxidant defense. Although some randomized
controlled trials are available, the evidence on the use of
intravenous selenium is still very weak. Only one large
clinical trial has examined the effect on mortality rates, and
no significant impact was reported on the intent-to-treat
population with severe systemic inflammatory response
syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock (OR, 0.66; 95 % CI,
0.39–1.10; P = 0.109) [221]. Overall, there was a trend
toward a concentration-dependent reduction in mortality; no
differences in secondary outcomes or adverse events were
detected. Finally, no comment on standardization of sepsis
management was included in this study, which recruited 249
patients over a period of 6 years (1999–2004) [221].
A French RCT in a small population revealed no effect
on primary (shock reversal) or secondary (days on
mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality) endpoints [222].
Another small RCT revealed less early VAP in the selenium
group (P = 0.04), but no difference in late VAP or secondary outcomes such as ICU or hospital mortality [223].
This is in accordance with 2 RCTs that resulted in reduced
number of infectious episodes [224] or increase in glutathione peroxidase concentrations [225]; neither study,
however, showed a beneficial effect on secondary outcome
measures (renal replacement, ICU mortality) [224, 225].
A more recent large RCT tried to determine if the
addition of relatively low doses of supplemental selenium
(glutamine was also tested in a two-factorial design) to
parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients reduces
infections and improves outcome [226]. Selenium supplementation did not significantly affect the development of a
new infection (OR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.57–1.15), and the
6-month mortality rate was not unaffected (OR, 0.89; 95 %
CI, 0.62–1.29). In addition, length of stay, days of antibiotic
use, and modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
score were not significantly affected by selenium [227].
In addition to the lack of evidence, the questions of
optimal dosing and application mode remain unanswered.
Reported high-dose regimens have involved a loading dose
followed by an infusion, while animal trials suggest that
bolus dosing could be more effective [227]; this, however,
has not been tested in humans. These unsolved problems
require additional trials, and we encourage conducting large
multicenter studies to further evaluate the effectiveness of
intravenous selenium in patients with severe sepsis. This
recommendation does not exclude the use of low-dose
selenium as part of the standard minerals and oligo-elements used during total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
N. History of recommendations regarding use
of recombinant activated protein C
Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) was
approved for use in adult patients in a number of countries
in 2001 following the Recombinant Human Activated
Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis
(PROWESS) trial, which enrolled 1,690 severe sepsis
patients and showed a significant reduction in mortality
(24.7 %) with rhAPC compared with placebo (30.8 %,
P = 0.005) [228]. The 2004 SSC guidelines recommended use of rhAPC in line with the product labeling
instructions required by the US and European regulatory
authorities with a grade B quality of evidence [7, 8].
By the time of publication of the 2008 SSC guidelines,
additional studies of rhAPC in severe sepsis (as required
by regulatory agencies) had shown it ineffective in less
severely ill patients with severe sepsis as well as in
children [229, 230]. The 2008 SSC recommendations
reflected these findings, and the strength of the rhAPC
recommendation was downgraded to a suggestion for use
in adult patients with a clinical assessment of high risk of
death, most of whom will have Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores C25 or
multiple organ failure (grade 2C; quality of evidence was
also downgraded from 2004, from B to C) [7]. The 2008
guidelines also recommended against use of rhAPC in
low-risk adult patients, most of whom will have APACHE
II scores B20 or single organ failures (grade 1A), and
against use in all pediatric patients (grade 1B).
The results of the PROWESS SHOCK trial (1,696
patients) were released in late 2011, showing no benefit of
rhAPC in patients with septic shock (mortality 26.4 % for
188

rhAPC, 24.2 % placebo) with a relative risk of 1.09 and a
P value of 0.31 [231]. The drug was withdrawn from the
market and is no longer available, negating any need for
an SSC recommendation regarding its use.
O. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute
respiratory distress syndrome
1. We recommend that clinicians target a tidal volume of
6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsisinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
(grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg).
2. We recommend that plateau pressures be measured in
patients with ARDS and that the initial upper limit
goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung
be B 30 cmH2O (grade 1B).
Rationale. Of note, studies used to determine recommendations in this section enrolled patients using criteria
from the American-European Consensus Criteria Definition for Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and ARDS [232]. For this
document, we have used the updated Berlin definition and
used the terms mild, moderate, and severe ARDS (PaO2/
FIO2 B300, B200, and B100 mm Hg, respectively) for
the syndromes previously known as ALI and ARDS [233].
Several multicenter randomized trials have been performed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate the
effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation
of tidal volume [234–238]. These studies showed differing
results that may have been caused by differences in airway
pressures in the treatment and control groups [233, 234,
239]. Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in
patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy for
established ARDS [240, 241].
The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited
strategy showed an absolute 9 % decrease in all-cause
mortality in patients with ARDS ventilated with tidal
volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), and aiming for a plateau
pressure B30 cm H2O [233]. The use of lung-protective
strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clinical
trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice
of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may
require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure
achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the
thoracoabdominal compartment, and the vigor of the
patient’s breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high obligate minute ventilations, or short
stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate
with tidal volumes[6 mL/kg PBW as long as the plateau
pressure can be maintained B30 cm H2O [242, 243]. The
validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient’s
effort, as those who are actively breathing generate higher
transalveolar pressures for a given plateau pressure than
patients who are passively inflated. Conversely, patients
with very stiff chest walls may require plateau pressures
[30 cmH2O to meet vital clinical objectives. A retrospective study suggested that tidal volumes should be
lowered even with plateau pressures B30 cmH2O [244] as
lower plateau pressures were associated with decreased
in-hospital mortality [245].
High tidal volumes that are coupled with high plateau
pressures should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should
use as a starting point the objective of reducing tidal
volume over 1–2 h from its initial value toward the goal
of a ‘‘low’’ tidal volume (&6 mL/kg PBW) achieved in
conjunction with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure
B30 cmH2O. If the plateau pressure remains[30 cmH2O
after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal
volume may be reduced further to as low as 4 mL/kg
PBW per protocol. (Appendix 3 provides ARDSNet
ventilator management and formulas to calculate PBW.)
Using volume- and pressure-limited ventilation may lead
to hypercapnia with maximum tolerated set respiratory
rates. In such cases, hypercapnia that is otherwise not
contraindicated (e.g., high intracranial pressure) and
appears to be tolerated should be allowed. Sodium
bicarbonate or tromethamine (THAM) infusion may be
considered in selected patients to facilitate use of limited
ventilator conditions that result in permissive hypercapnia
[246, 247].
A number of observational trials in mechanically
ventilated patients have demonstrated a decreased risk of
developing ARDS when smaller trial volumes are used
[248–251]. Accordingly, high tidal volumes and plateau
pressures should be avoided in mechanically ventilated
patients at risk for developing ARDS, including those
with sepsis.
No single mode of ventilation (pressure control, volume control) has consistently been shown to be
advantageous when compared with any other that respects
the same principles of lung protection.
3. We recommend that PEEP be applied to avoid alveolar
collapse at end expiration (atelectotrauma) (grade 1B).
4. We suggest strategies based on higher rather than
lower levels of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced
moderate to severe ARDS (grade 2C).
Rationale. Raising PEEP in ARDS keeps lung units
open to participate in gas exchange. This will increase
PaO2 when PEEP is applied through either an endotracheal tube or a face mask [252–254]. In animal
experiments, avoidance of end-expiratory alveolar collapse helps minimize ventilator-induced lung injury when
relatively high plateau pressures are in use. Three large
multicenter trials using higher versus lower levels of
PEEP in conjunction with low tidal volumes did not
uncover benefit or harm [255–257]. A meta-analysis using
individual patient data showed no benefit in all patients
189

with ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe
ARDS (Pao2/FIo2 ratio B200 mm Hg) had decreased
mortality with the use of higher PEEP, whereas those with
mild ARDS did not [258]. Two options are recommended
for PEEP titration. One option is to titrate PEEP (and tidal
volume) according to bedside measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the
best compliance, reflecting a favorable balance of lung
recruitment and overdistension [259]. The second option
is to titrate PEEP based on severity of oxygenation deficit
and guided by the FIo2 required to maintain adequate
oxygenation [234, 255, 256]. A PEEP[5 cm H20 is usually
required to avoid lung collapse [260]. The ARDSNet
standard PEEP strategy is shown in Appendix 3. The higher
PEEP strategy recommended for ARDS is shown in
Appendix 4 and comes from the ALVEOLI trial [257].
5. We suggest recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients
with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (grade
2C).
6. We suggest prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS
patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio B100 mmHg in facilities
that have experience with such practices (grade 2B).
Rationale. Many strategies exist for treating refractory
hypoxemia in patients with severe ARDS [261]. Temporarily raising transpulmonary pressure may facilitate
opening atelectatic alveoli to permit gas exchange [260],
but could also overdistend aerated lung units leading to
ventilator-induced lung injury and temporary hypotension. The application of transient sustained use of
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appears to
improve oxygenation in patients initially, but these effects
can be transient [262]. Although selected patients with
severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment maneuvers in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP, little
evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS patients
[262]. Blood pressure and oxygenation should be monitored and recruitment maneuvers discontinued if
deterioration in these variables is observed.
Several small studies and one large study in patients
with hypoxemic respiratory failure or ARDS have shown
that most patients respond to the prone position with
improved oxygenation [263–266]. None of the individual
trials of prone positioning in patients with ARDS or
hypoxemic respiratory failure demonstrated a mortality benefit [267–270]. One meta-analysis suggested potential
benefits for prone positioning in patients with profound hypoxemia and PaO2/FiO2 ratio B100 mmHg, but not in those
with less severe hypoxemia [270]. Prone positioning may be
associated with potentially life-threatening complications,
including accidental dislodging of the endotracheal and chest
tubes; these complications occur more frequently in patients
in the prone compared with supine position [270].
Other methods to treat refractory hypoxemia, including
high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, airway pressure
release ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [271], may be considered as rescue therapies in centers
with expertise and experience with their use [261, 271–274].
Inhaled nitric oxide does not improve mortality rates in
patients with ARDS and should not be routinely used [275].
7. We recommend that mechanically ventilated sepsis
patients be maintained with the head of the bed elevated between 30 and 45 degrees to limit aspiration
risk and to prevent the development of VAP
(grade 1B).
Rationale. The semi-recumbent position has been
demonstrated to decrease the incidence of VAP [276].
Enteral feeding increased the risk of developing VAP; 50 %
of the patients who were fed enterally in the supine position
developed VAP compared with 9 % of those fed in the semirecumbent position [276]. However, the bed position was
monitored only once a day, and patients who did not achieve
the desired bed elevation were not included in the analysis
[276]. One study did not show a difference in incidence of
VAP between patients maintained in supine and semirecumbent positions [277]; patients assigned to the semirecumbent group did not consistently achieve the desired
head of the bed elevation, and the head of bed elevation in
the supine group approached that of the semi-recumbent
group by day 7 [277]. When necessary, patients may be laid
flat for procedures, hemodynamic measurements, and during episodes of hypotension. Patients should not be fed
enterally while supine.
8. We suggest that noninvasive mask ventilation (NIV) be
used in that minority of sepsis-induced ARDS patients in
whom the benefits of NIV have been carefully considered and are thought to outweigh the risks (grade 2B).
Rationale. Obviating the need for airway intubation
confers multiple advantages: better communication, lower
incidence of infection, and reduced requirements for
sedation. Two RCTs in patients with acute respiratory
failure demonstrated improved outcome with the use of
NIV when it can be used successfully [278, 279].
Unfortunately, only a small percentage of sepsis patients
with life-threatening hypoxemia can be managed in this
way [280, 281].
NIV should be considered in patients with sepsisinduced ARDS if they are responsive to relatively low levels
of pressure support and PEEP with stable hemodynamics,
can be made comfortable, and are easily arousable; if they
are able to protect the airway and spontaneously clear the
airway of secretions; and if they are anticipated to recover
rapidly from the precipitating insult [280, 281]. A low
threshold for airway intubation should be maintained.
9. We recommend that a weaning protocol be in place
and that mechanically ventilated patients with severe
sepsis undergo spontaneous breathing trials regularly
190

to evaluate the ability to discontinue mechanical ventilation when they satisfy the following criteria:
(a) arousable; (b) hemodynamically stable (without
vasopressor agents); (c) no new potentially serious
conditions; (d) low ventilatory and end-expiratory
pressure requirements; and (e) low FiO2 requirements
which can be safely delivered with a face mask or nasal
cannula. If the spontaneous breathing trial is successful,
extubation should be considered (grade 1A).
Rationale. Spontaneous breathing trial options include a
low level of pressure support, CPAP (&5 cmH2O), or a
use of a T-piece. Studies demonstrated that daily spontaneous breathing trials in appropriately selected patients
reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation [282, 283].
These breathing trials should be conducted in conjunction
with a spontaneous awakening trial [284]. Successful
completion of spontaneous breathing trials leads to a high
likelihood of successful early discontinuation of
mechanical ventilation.
10. We recommend against the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter for patients with sepsisinduced ARDS (grade 1A).
Rationale. Although insertion of a pulmonary artery
(PA) catheter may provide useful information on a
patient’s volume status and cardiac function, these benefits may be confounded by differences in the
interpretation of results [285–287], lack of correlation of
PA occlusion pressures with clinical response [288], and
an absence of a proven strategy to use catheter results to
improve patient outcomes [173]. Two multicenter randomized trials, one in patients with shock or ARDS [289]
and the other in those with only ARDS [290], failed to
show benefit with the routine use of PA catheters in
ARDS. In addition, other studies in different types of
critically ill patients have failed to show definitive benefit
with routine use of the PA catheter [291–293]. Wellselected patients remain appropriate candidates for PA
catheter insertion only when the answers to important
management decisions depend on information solely
obtainable from direct measurements made within the PA
[292, 294].
11. We recommend a conservative fluid strategy for
patients with established sepsis-induced ARDS who do
not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (grade 1C).
Rationale. Mechanisms for the development of pulmonary edema in patients with ARDS include increased
capillary permeability, increased hydrostatic pressure, and
decreased oncotic pressure [295]. Small prospective
studies in patients with critical illness and ARDS
have suggested that low weight gain is associated with
improved oxygenation [296] and fewer days of mechanical
ventilation [297, 298]. A fluid-conservative strategy to
minimize fluid infusion and weight gain in patients with
ARDS, based on either a central venous catheter (CVP
\4 mmHg) or a PA catheter (pulmonary artery wedge
pressure\8 mmHg), along with clinical variables to guide
treatment, led to fewer days of mechanical ventilation and
reduced length of ICU stay without altering the incidence of
renal failure or mortality rates [299]. This strategy was only
used in patients with established ARDS, some of whom had
shock present during the ICU stay, and active attempts to
reduce fluid volume were conducted only outside periods of
shock.
12. In the absence of specific indications such as bronchospasm, we recommend against the use of
b2-agonists for treatment of patients with sepsisinduced ARDS (grade 1B).
Rationale. Patients with sepsis-induced ARDS often
develop increased vascular permeability. Preclinical and
early clinical data suggest that b-adrenergic agonists may
speed resorption of alveolar edema [300]. Two randomized clinical trials studied the effect of b-agonists in
patients with ARDS [301, 302]. In one, a comparison of
aerosolized albuterol and placebo in 282 patients with
ARDS, the trial was stopped for futility [301]. Patients
receiving albuterol had higher heart rates on day 2, and a
trend was detected toward decreased ventilator-free days
(days alive and off the ventilator). The rates of death
before discharge were 23.0 % in the albuterol group
versus 17.7 % in placebo-treated patients. More than half
of the patients enrolled in this trial had pulmonary or
nonpulmonary sepsis as the cause of the ARDS [301].
The use of intravenous salbutamol was tested in the
BALTI-2 trial [302]. Three hundred twenty-six patients
with ARDS, 251 of whom had pulmonary or nonpulmonary sepsis as cause, were randomized to intravenous
salbutatmol, 15 lg/kg of ideal body weight, or placebo
for up to 7 days. Patients treated with salbutamol had
increased 28-day mortality rates (34 vs. 23 %; RR, 1.4;
95 % CI, 1.03–2.08) leading to early termination of the
trial [302].
b2-agonists may have specific indications, such as
treatment of bronchospasm and hyperkalemia. In the
absence of these conditions, we recommend against the
routine use of b-agonists, either in intravenous or aerosolized form, for the treatment of patients with sepsisinduced ARDS.
P. Sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade
in sepsis
1. We recommend that either continuous or intermittent
sedation be minimized in mechanically ventilated sepsis
patients, targeting specific titration endpoints (grade 1B).
191

Rationale. A growing body of evidence indicates that
limiting the use of sedation in critically ill ventilated
patients can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation
and ICU and hospital lengths of stay [303–305]. While
studies limiting sedation have been performed in a wide
range of critically ill patients, there is little reason to
assume that septic patients will not derive benefit from
this approach [305]. The use of protocols for sedation is
one method to limit sedation use, and a randomized,
controlled clinical trial found that protocolized sedation
compared with usual care reduced duration of mechanical
ventilation, lengths of stay, and tracheostomy rates [305].
Avoidance of sedation is another strategy. A recent
observational study of 250 critically ill patients suggests
that deep sedation is common in mechanically ventilated
patients [306]. A randomized, controlled clinical trial
found that patients treated with intravenous morphine
boluses preferentially, had significantly more days without ventilation, shorter stay in ICU and hospital, than
patients who received sedation (propofol and midazolam)
in addition to morphine [307]. However, agitated delirium
was more frequently detected in the intervention group.
Although not specifically studied in patients with sepsis,
the administration of intermittent sedation, daily sedative
interruption, and systematic titration to a predefined
endpoint have been demonstrated to decrease the duration
of mechanical ventilation [284, 305, 308, 309]. Patients
receiving neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) must
be individually assessed regarding discontinuation of
sedative drugs because the neuromuscular blockade must
first be reversed. The use of intermittent vs. continuous
methods for the delivery of sedation in critically ill
patients has been examined in an observational study of
mechanically ventilated patients that showed that patients
receiving continuous sedation had significantly longer
durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital
lengths of stay [310].
Clinical trials have evaluated daily interruption of
continuous sedative infusions. A prospective, randomized
controlled trial in 128 mechanically ventilated adults
receiving continuous intravenous sedation demonstrated
that a daily interruption in the continuous sedative infusion until the patient was awake decreased the duration of
mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay [310].
Although the patients did receive continuous sedative
infusions in this study, the daily interruption and awakening allowed for titration of sedation, in effect making
the dosing intermittent. In addition, a paired spontaneous
awakening trial combined with a spontaneous breathing
trial decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation,
length of ICU and hospital stay, and 1-year mortality
[284]. More recently, a multicenter randomized trial
compared protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption in 423 critically ill
mechanically ventilated medical and surgical patients
[311]. There were no differences in duration of
mechanical ventilation or lengths of stay between the
groups; and daily interruption was associated with higher
daily opioid and benzodiazepines doses, as well as higher
nurse workload. Additionally, a randomized prospective
blinded observational study demonstrated that although
myocardial ischemia is common in critically ill ventilated
patients, daily sedative interruption is not associated with
an increased occurrence of myocardial ischemia [312].
Regardless of sedation approach, early physical rehabilitation should be a goal [313].
2. We recommend that NMBAs be avoided if possible in
the septic patient without ARDS due to the risk of
prolonged neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation. If NMBAs must be maintained, either
intermittent bolus as required or continuous infusion
with train-of-four monitoring of the depth of blockade
should be used (grade 1C).
3. We suggest a short course of an NMBA (B48 h) for
patients with early, sepsis-induced ARDS and PaO2/
FIO2\150 mm Hg (grade 2C).
Rationale. Although NMBAs are often administered to
critically ill patients, their role in the ICU is not well defined.
No evidence exists that neuromuscular blockade in this
patient population reduces mortality or major morbidity. In
addition, no studies have been published that specifically
address the use of NMBAs in septic patients.
The most common indication for NMBA use in the
ICU is to facilitate mechanical ventilation [314]. When
appropriately used, these agents may improve chest wall
compliance, prevent respiratory dyssynchrony, and
reduce peak airway pressures [315]. Muscle paralysis may
also reduce oxygen consumption by decreasing the work
of breathing and respiratory muscle blood flow [316].
However, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial
in patients with severe sepsis demonstrated that oxygen
delivery, oxygen consumption, and gastric intramucosal
pH were not improved during deep neuromuscular
blockade [317].
A recent randomized clinical trial of continuous
infusions of cisatracurium in patients with early ARDS
and a PaO2/FIO2\150 mm Hg showed improved adjusted survival rates and more organ failure-free days
without an increased risk in ICU-acquired weakness
compared with placebo-treated patients [318]. The
investigators used a high fixed dose of cisatracurium
without train-of-four monitoring, and half of the patients
in the placebo group received at least a single dose of
NMBA. Whether another NMBA would have similar
effects is unknown. Although many of the patients
enrolled into this trial appeared to meet sepsis criteria, it
is not clear whether similar results would occur in sepsis
patients. A GRADEpro Summary of Evidence Table
regarding use of NMBA in ARDS appears in Supplemental Digital Content 5.
192

An association between NMBA use and myopathies
and neuropathies has been suggested by case studies and
prospective observational studies in the critical care
population [315, 319–322], but the mechanisms by which
NMBAs produce or contribute to myopathies and neuropathies in these patients are unknown. Although no
studies are specific to the septic patient population, it
seems clinically prudent, based on existing knowledge,
that NMBAs not be administered unless there is a clear
indication for neuromuscular blockade that cannot be
safely achieved with appropriate sedation and analgesia
[315].
Only one prospective RCT has compared peripheral
nerve stimulation and standard clinical assessment in ICU
patients [323]. Rudis et al. randomized 77 critically ill
ICU patients requiring neuromuscular blockade to receive
dosing of vecuronium based on train-of-four stimulation
or on clinical assessment (control group). The peripheral
nerve stimulation group received less drug and recovered
neuromuscular function and spontaneous ventilation faster than the control group. Nonrandomized observational
studies have suggested that peripheral nerve monitoring
reduces or has no effect on clinical recovery from
NMBAs in the ICU [324, 325].
Benefits to neuromuscular monitoring, including faster
recovery of neuromuscular function and shorter intubation times, appear to exist. A potential for cost savings
(reduced total dose of NMBAs and shorter intubation
times) also may exist, although this has not been studied
formally.
Q. Glucose control
1. We recommend a protocolized approach to blood
glucose management in ICU patients with severe
sepsis, commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are [180 mg/dL. This
approach should target an upper blood glucose level
B180 mg/dL rather than an upper target blood glucose
B110 mg/dL (grade 1A).
2. We recommend blood glucose values be monitored
every 1–2 h until glucose values and insulin infusion
rates are stable, then every 4 h thereafter (grade 1C).
3. We recommend that glucose levels obtained with
point-of-care testing of capillary blood be interpreted
with caution, as such measurements may not accurately estimate arterial blood or plasma glucose values
(UG).
Rationale. One large RCT single center trial in a predominantly cardiac surgical ICU demonstrated a
reduction in ICU mortality with intensive intravenous
insulin (Leuven protocol) targeting blood glucose to
80–110 mg/dL [326]. A second randomized trial of
intensive insulin therapy using the Leuven protocol
enrolled medical ICU patients with an anticipated ICU
length of stay of more than 3 days in three medical ICUs
and overall mortality was not reduced [327].
Since these studies [326, 327] and the previous Surviving Sepsis Guidelines [7] appeared, several RCTs
[128, 328–332] and meta-analyses [333– 337] of intensive
insulin therapy have been performed. The RCTs studied
mixed populations of surgical and medical ICU patients
[128, 328–332] and found that intensive insulin therapy
did not significantly decrease mortality [128, 328–332],
whereas the NICE-SUGAR trial demonstrated an
increased mortality [331]. All studies [128, 326–332]
reported a much higher incidence of severe hypoglycemia
(glucose B40 mg/dL) (6–29 %) with intensive insulin
therapy. Several meta-analyses confirmed that intensive
insulin therapy was not associated with a mortality benefit
in surgical, medical, or mixed ICU patients [333, 335,
337]. The meta-analysis by Griesdale and colleagues
[334], using between-trial comparisons driven mainly by
the 2001 study by van den Berghe et al. [326], found that
intensive insulin therapy was beneficial in surgical ICU
patients [risk ratio 0.63 (0.44–0.9)], whereas the metaanalysis by Friedrich et al. [336], using within-trial
comparisons, showed no benefit for surgical patients in
mixed medical-surgical ICUs [risk ratio 0.99 (0.82–1.11)]
and no subgroup of surgical patients who benefited from
intensive insulin therapy. Interestingly, the RCTs that
reported [326, 337] compared intensive insulin therapy to
high controls (180–200 mg/dL) [OR 0.89 (0.73–1.09)],
whereas those that did not demonstrate benefit [330–332]
compared intensive therapy to moderate controls
(108–180 mg/dL) [OR 1.14 (1.02 to -1.26)]. See Supplemental Digital Content 6 for details.
The trigger to start an insulin protocol for blood glucose levels [180 mg/dL with an upper target blood
glucose level \180 mg/dL derives from the NICESUGAR study [331], which used these values for initiating and stopping therapy. The NICE-SUGAR trial is the
largest, most compelling study to date on glucose control
in ICU patients given its inclusion of multiple ICUs and
hospitals and a general patient population. Several medical organizations, including the American Association of
Clinical Endocrinologists, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American College of
Physicians, and Society of Critical Care Medicine, have
published consensus statements for glycemic control of
hospitalized patients [338–341]. These statements usually
targeted glucose levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL. As
there is no evidence that targets between 140 and 180 mg/
dL are different from targets of 110–140 mg/dL, the
recommendations use an upper target blood glucose
B180 mg/dL without a lower target other than hypoglycemia. Treatment should avoid hyperglycemia ([180 mg/
dL), hypoglycemia, and wide swings in glucose levels.
The continuation of insulin infusions, especially with the
cessation of nutrition, has been identified as a risk factor
for hypoglycemia [332]. Balanced nutrition may be
193

associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia [342].
Several studies have suggested that the variability in
glucose levels over time is an important determinant of
mortality [343–345]. Hyperglycemia and glucose variability seem to be unassociated with increased mortality
rates in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients
[346, 347].
Several factors may affect the accuracy and reproducibility of point-of-care testing of blood capillary blood
glucose, including the type and model of the device used,
user expertise, and patient factors, including hematocrit
(false elevation with anemia), PaO2, and drugs [348].
Plasma glucose values by capillary point-of-care testing
have been found to be inaccurate with frequent false
elevations [349] over the range of glucose levels [350],
but especially in the hypoglycemic [349, 351] and
hyperglycemic ranges [351] and in hypotensive patients
[352] or patients receiving catecholamines [353]. A
review of 12 published insulin infusion protocols for
critically ill patients showed wide variability in dose
recommendations and variable glucose control [354]. This
lack of consensus about optimal dosing of intravenous
insulin may reflect variability in patient factors (severity
of illness, surgical vs medical settings), or practice patterns (e.g., approaches to feeding, intravenous dextrose)
in the environments in which these protocols were
developed and tested. Alternatively, some protocols may
be more effective than others, conclusion supported by
the wide variability in hypoglycemia rates reported with
protocols [128, 326–333]. Thus, the use of established
insulin protocols is important not only for clinical care but
also for the conduct of clinical trials to avoid hypoglycemia, adverse events, and premature termination of trials
before the efficacy signal, if any, can be determined.
Several studies have suggested that computer-based
algorithms result in tighter glycemic control with a
reduced risk of hypoglycemia [355, 356]. Further study of
validated, safe, and effective protocols for controlling
blood glucose concentrations and variability in the severe
sepsis population is needed.
R. Renal replacement therapy
1. We suggest that continuous renal replacement therapies and intermittent hemodialysis are equivalent in
patients with severe sepsis and acute renal failure
because they achieve similar short-term survival rates
(grade 2B).
2. We suggest the use of continuous therapies to facilitate
management of fluid balance in hemodynamically
unstable septic patients (grade 2D).
Rationale. Although numerous nonrandomized studies
have reported a nonsignificant trend toward improved
survival using continuous methods [357–364], two metaanalyses [365, 366] reported the absence of significant
difference in hospital mortality between patients who
receive continuous and intermittent renal replacement
therapies. This absence of apparent benefit of one
modality over the other persists even when the analysis
is restricted to RCT studies [366]. To date, five prospective RCTs have been published [367–371]; four
found no significant difference in mortality [367–371],
whereas one found significantly higher mortality in the
continuous treatment group [367], but imbalanced randomization had led to a higher baseline severity of
illness in this group. When a multivariable model was
used to adjust for severity of illness, no difference in
mortality was apparent between the groups [367]. Most
studies comparing modes of renal replacement in the
critically ill have included a small number of patients
and some major weaknesses (i.e., randomization failure,
modifications of therapeutic protocol during the study
period, combination of different types of continuous
renal replacement therapies, small number of heterogeneous groups of enrollees). The most recent and largest
RCT [371] enrolled 360 patients and found no significant
difference in survival between the continuous and
intermittent groups. Moreover, no evidence supports the
use of continuous therapies in sepsis independent of
renal replacement needs.
No evidence supports a better tolerance with continuous treatments regarding the hemodynamic tolerance of
each method. Two prospective studies [369, 372] have
reported a better hemodynamic tolerance with continuous
treatment, with no improvement in regional perfusion
[372] and no survival benefit [369]. Four other prospective studies did not find any significant difference in MAP
or drop in systolic pressure between the two methods
[368, 370, 371, 373]. Two studies reported a significant
improvement in goal achievement with continuous
methods [367, 369] regarding fluid balance management.
In summary, the evidence is insufficient to draw strong
conclusions regarding the mode of replacement therapy
for acute renal failure in septic patients.
The effect of dose of continuous renal replacement on
outcomes in patients with acute renal failure has shown
mixed results [374, 375]. None of these trials was conducted specifically in patients with sepsis. Although the
weight of evidence suggests that higher doses of renal
replacement may be associated with improved outcomes,
these results may not be generalizable. Two large multicenter randomized trials comparing the dose of renal
replacement (Acute Renal Failure Trial Network in the
United States and RENAL Renal Replacement Therapy
Study in Australia and New Zealand) failed to show
benefit of more aggressive renal replacement dosing [376,
377]. A typical dose for continuous renal replacement
therapy would be 20–25 mL kg-1 h-1 of effluent
generation.
194

S. Bicarbonate therapy
1. We recommend against the use of sodium bicarbonate
therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics
or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with
hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with pH C7.15
(grade 2B).
Rationale. Although bicarbonate therapy may be useful
in limiting tidal volume in ARDS in some situations of
permissive hypercapnia (see ‘‘Mechanical ventilation’’
of ARDS), no evidence supports the use of bicarbonate
therapy in the treatment of hypoperfusion-induced lactic
acidemia associated with sepsis. Two blinded, crossover
RCTs that compared equimolar saline and bicarbonate
in patients with lactic acidosis failed to reveal any difference in hemodynamic variables or vasopressor
requirements [378, 379]. The number of patients with
\7.15 pH in these studies was small. Bicarbonate
administration has been associated with sodium and
fluid overload, an increase in lactate and PCO2, and a
decrease in serum ionized calcium, but the relevance of
these variables to outcome is uncertain. The effect of
bicarbonate administration on hemodynamics and
vasopressor requirements at lower pH, as well as the
effect on clinical outcomes at any pH, is unknown. No
studies have examined the effect of bicarbonate
administration on outcomes.
T. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
1. We recommend that patients with severe sepsis receive
daily pharmacoprophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) (grade 1B). We recommend that this
be accomplished with daily subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (grade 1B versus
unfractionated heparin [UFH] twice daily and grade
2C versus UFH given thrice daily). If creatinine
clearance is \30 mL/min we recommend use of dalteparin (grade 1A) or another form of LMWH that has
a low degree of renal metabolism (grade 2C) or UFH
(grade 1A).
2. We suggest that patients with severe sepsis be treated
with a combination of pharmacologic therapy and
intermittent pneumatic compression devices whenever
possible (grade 2C).
3. We recommend that septic patients who have a
contraindication to heparin use (e.g., thrombocytopenia, severe coagulopathy, active bleeding, recent
intracerebral hemorrhage) not receive pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 1B). Rather we suggest they receive
mechanical prophylactic treatment, such as graduated
compression stockings or intermittent compression
devices (grade 2C), unless contraindicated. When the
risk decreases, we suggest starting pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 2C).
Rationale. ICU patients are at risk for deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) [380]. It is logical that patients with
severe sepsis would be at a similar or higher risk than the
general ICU population. The consequences of VTE in the
setting of sepsis (increased risk of potentially fatal pulmonary emboli in an already hemodynamically
compromised patient) are dire. Therefore, prevention of
VTE is highly desirable, especially if it can be done safely
and effectively.
Prophylaxis is generally effective. In particular, nine
placebo-controlled RCTs of VTE prophylaxis have been
conducted in general populations of acutely ill patients
[381–389]. All trials showed reduction in DVT or pulmonary embolism, a benefit that is also supported by
meta-analyses [390, 391]. Thus, the evidence strongly
supports the value of VTE prophylaxis (grade 1A). The
prevalence of infection/sepsis was 17 % in those studies
in which this could be ascertained. One study investigated
only ICU patients only, and 52 % of those enrolled had
infection/sepsis. The need to extrapolate from general,
acutely ill patients to critically ill patients to septic
patients downgrades the evidence. That the effect is
pronounced and the data are robust somewhat mitigate
against the extrapolation, leading to a grade B determination. Because the patient’s risk of administration is
small, the gravity of not administering may be great, and
the cost is low, the strength of the recommendation is
strong [1].
Deciding how to provide prophylaxis is decidedly
more difficult. The Canadian Critical Care Trials Group
compared UFH (5000 IU twice daily) to LMWH (dalteparin, 5000 IU once per day and a second placebo
injection to ensure parallel-group equivalence) [392]. No
statistically significant difference in asymptomatic DVTs
was found between the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.92;
95 % CI, 0.68–1.23; P = 0.57), but the proportion of
patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism on CT scan,
high-probability ventilation perfusion scan, or autopsy
was significantly lower in the LMWH group (hazard ratio,
0.51; 95 % CI, 0.30–0.88; P = 0.01).The study did not
account for the use of other forms of LMWH. These data
suggest that LMWH (dalteparin) is the treatment of
choice over UFH administered twice daily in critically ill
patients. Also, because the study included septic patients,
the evidence supporting the use of dalteparin over twice
daily UFH in critically ill, and perhaps septic, patients is
strong. Similarly, a meta-analysis of acutely ill, general
medical patients comparing UFH twice and thrice daily
demonstrated that the latter regimen was more effective at
preventing VTE, but twice daily dosing produced less
bleeding [393]. Both critically ill and septic patients were
included in these analyses, but their numbers are unclear.
Nonetheless, the quality of evidence supporting the use of
three times daily, as opposed to twice daily, UFH dosing
in preventing VTE in acutely ill medical patients is high
(A). However, comparing LMWH to twice daily UFH, or
195

twice daily UFH to three times daily UFH, in sepsis
requires extrapolation, downgrading the data. No data
exist on direct comparison of LMWH to UFH administered three times daily, nor are there any studies directly
comparing twice daily and thrice daily UFH dosing in
septic or critically ill patients. Therefore, it is not possible
to state that LMWH is superior to three times daily UFH
or that three times daily dosing is superior to twice daily
administration in sepsis. This downgrades the quality of
the evidence and therefore the recommendation.
Douketis et al. [394] conducted a study of 120 critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (creatinine
clearance \30 mL/min) who received VTE prophylaxis
with dalteparin 5,000 IU daily for between 4 and 14 days
and had at least one trough anti-factor Xa level measured.
None of the patients had bio-accumulation (trough antifactor Xa level lower than 0.06 IU/mL). The incidence of
major bleeding was somewhat higher than in trials of
other agents, but most other studies did not involve critically ill patients, in whom the bleeding risk is higher.
Further, bleeding did not correlate with detectable trough
levels [394]. Therefore, we recommend that dalteparin
can be administered to critically ill patients with acute
renal failure (A). Data on other LMWHs are lacking.
Consequently, these forms should probably be avoided or,
if used, anti-factor Xa levels should be monitored (grade
2C). UFH is not renally cleared and is safe (grade 1A).
Mechanical methods (intermittent compression
devices and graduated compression stockings) are recommended when anticoagulation is contraindicated [395–
397]. A meta-analysis of 11 studies, including six RCTs,
published in the Cochrane Library concluded that the
combination of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis was superior to either modality alone in preventing
DVT and was better than compression alone in preventing
pulmonary embolism [398]. This analysis did not focus on
sepsis or critically ill patients but included studies of
prophylaxis after orthopedic, pelvic, and cardiac surgery.
In addition, the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis varied,
including UFH, LMWH, aspirin, and warfarin. Nonetheless, the minimal risk associated with compression
devices lead us to recommend combination therapy in
most cases. In very-high-risk patients, LMWH is preferred over UFH [392, 399–401]. Patients receiving
heparin should be monitored for development of heparininduced thrombocytopenia. These recommendations are
consistent with those developed by the American College
of Chest Physicians [402].
U. Stress ulcer prophylaxis
1. We recommend that stress ulcer prophylaxis using H2
blocker or proton pump inhibitor be given to patients
with severe sepsis/septic shock who have bleeding risk
factors (grade 1B).
2. When stress ulcer prophylaxis is used, we suggest the
use of proton pump inhibitors rather than H2 receptor
antagonists (H2RA) (grade 2C).
3. We suggest that patients without risk factors should
not receive prophylaxis (grade 2B).
Rationale. Although no study has been performed specifically in patients with severe sepsis, trials confirming
the benefit of stress ulcer prophylaxis in reducing upper
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in general ICU populations
included 20–25 % of patients with sepsis [403–406]. This
benefit should be applicable to patients with severe sepsis
and septic shock. In addition, the risk factors for GI
bleeding (e.g., coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation for at
least 48 h, possibly hypotension) are frequently present in
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [407, 408].
Patients without these risk factors are unlikely (0.2 %;
95 % CI, 0.02–0.5) to have clinically important bleeding
[407].
Both old and new meta-analyses show prophylaxisinduced reduction in clinically significant upper GI
bleeding, which we consider significant even in the
absence of proven mortality benefit [409–411]. The benefit of prevention of upper GI bleeding must be weighed
against the potential (unproven) effect of increased
stomach pH on a greater incidence of VAP and C. difficile
infection [409, 412, 413]. (See Supplemental Digital
Content 6, 7 and 8, Summary of Evidence Tables for
effects of treatments on specific outcomes.) In an
exploratory hypothesis, we considered (as did the authors
of the meta-analysis) [411] the possibility of less benefit
and more harm in prophylaxis among patients receiving
enteral nutrition but decided to provide one recommendation while lowering the quality of evidence. The
balance of benefits and risks may thus depend on the
individual patient’s characteristics as well as on the local
epidemiology of VAP and C. difficile infections. The
rationale for considering only suppression of acid production (and not sucralfate) is based on the study of 1,200
patients by Cook et al. [414] comparing H2 blockers and
sucralfate. More recent meta-analyses provide low-quality
evidence suggesting more effective GI bleeding protection with the use of proton pump inhibitors than with
H2RA [415–417]. Patients should be periodically evaluated for the continued need for prophylaxis.
V. Nutrition
1. We suggest administering oral or enteral (if necessary)
feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete
fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within
the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic
shock (grade 2C).
2. We suggest avoiding mandatory full caloric feeding in
the first week, but rather suggest low dose feeding
196

(e.g., up to 500 kcal per day), advancing only as
tolerated (grade 2B).
3. We suggest using intravenous glucose and enteral
nutrition rather than TPN alone or parenteral nutrition
in conjunction with enteral feeding in the first 7 days
after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (grade
2B).
4. We suggest using nutrition with no specific immunomodulating supplementation in patients with severe
sepsis (grade 2C).
Rationale. Early enteral nutrition has theoretical
advantages in the integrity of gut mucosa and prevention
of bacterial translocation and organ dysfunction, but also
concerning is the risk of ischemia, mainly in hemodynamically unstable patients.
Unfortunately, no clinical trial has specifically
addressed early feeding in septic patients. Studies on
different subpopulations of critically ill patients, mostly
surgical patients, are not consistent, with great variability
in the intervention and control groups; all are of low
methodological quality [418–427] and none was individually powered for mortality, with very low mortality
rates [418–420, 423, 426]. Authors of previously published meta-analyses of optimal nutrition strategies for the
critically ill all reported that the studies they included had
high heterogeneity and low quality [418–430]. Although
no consistent effect on mortality was observed, there was
evidence of benefit from some early enteral feeding on
secondary outcomes, such as reduced incidence of
infectious complications [418, 422, 426, 427–430],
reduced length of mechanical ventilation [421, 427], and
reduced ICU [421, 427] and hospital stays [428]. No
evidence of harm was demonstrated in any of those
studies. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to issue a
strong recommendation, but the suggestion of benefit and
absence of harm supports a suggestion that some enteral
feeding is warranted.
Studies comparing full caloric early enteral feeding to
lower targets in the critically ill have produced inconclusive results. In four studies, no effect on mortality was
seen [431–434]; one reported fewer infectious complications [431], and the others reported increased diarrhea and
gastric residuals [433, 434] and increased incidence of
infectious complications with full caloric feeding [432].
In another study, mortality was greater with higher
feeding, but differences in feeding strategies were modest
and the sample size was small [435]. Therefore, evidence
is insufficient to support an early target of full caloric
intake and, indeed, some possibility of harm exists.
Underfeeding (60–70 % of target) or trophic feeding
(upper limit of 500 kcal) is probably a better nutritional
strategy in the first week of severe sepsis/septic shock.
This upper limit for trophic feeding is a somewhat arbitrary number, but based in part on the fact that the two
recent studies used a range of 240–480 kcal [433, 434].
Underfeeding/trophic feeding strategies did not exclude
advancing diet as tolerated in those who improved
quickly.
Some form of parenteral nutrition has been compared
to alternative feeding strategies (e.g., fasting or enteral
nutrition) in well over 50 studies, although only one
exclusively studied sepsis [436], and eight meta-analyses
have been published [429, 437–443]. Two of the metaanalyses summarize comparisons of parenteral nutrition
versus fasting or intravenous glucose [437, 438], and 6
look at parenteral versus enteral nutrition [429, 439–443],
two of which attempted to explore the effect of early
enteral nutrition [441, 442]. Recently, a study much larger
than most earlier nutrition trials compared ICU patients
randomized to early use of parenteral nutrition to augment
enteral feeding versus enteral feeding with only late initiation of parenteral nutrition if necessary [444].
No direct evidence supports the benefits or harm of
parenteral nutrition in the first 48 h in sepsis. Rather, the
evidence is generated predominantly from surgical, burn,
and trauma patients. None of the meta-analyses reports a
mortality benefit with parenteral nutrition, except one
suggesting parenteral nutrition may be better than late
introduction of enteral nutrition [442]. Several suggested
that parenteral nutrition had higher infectious complications compared both to fasting or intravenous glucose and
to enteral nutrition [429, 431, 438, 439, 442]. Enteral
feeding was associated with a higher rate of enteral
complications (e.g., diarrhea) than parenteral nutrition
[438]. The use of parenteral nutrition to supplement enteral feeding was also analyzed by Dhaliwal et al. [440],
who also reported no benefit. The trial by Casaer et al.
[444] reported that early initiation of parenteral nutrition
led to longer hospital and ICU stays, longer duration of
organ support, and higher incidence of ICU-acquired
infection. One-fifth of patients had sepsis and there was
no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects across
subgroups, including the sepsis subjects. Therefore, no
studies suggest the superiority of TPN over enteral alone
in the first 24 h. In fact, there is a suggestion that enteral
nutrition may in fact be superior to TPN vis a vis infectious complications and possibly requirement for
intensive care and organ support.
Immune system function can be modified through
alterations in the supply of certain nutrients, such as
arginine, glutamine, or omega-3 fatty acids. Numerous
studies have assessed whether use of these agents as
nutritional supplements can affect the course of critical
illness, but few specifically addressed their early use in
sepsis. Four meta-analyses evaluated immune-enhancing
nutrition and found no difference in mortality, neither in
surgical nor medical patients [445–448]. However, they
analyzed all studies together, regardless of the immunocomponent used, which could have compromised their
conclusions. Other individual studies analyzed diets with
a mix of arginine, glutamine, antioxidants, and/or omega197

3 with negative results [449, 450] including a small study
in septic patients showing a non-significant increase in
ICU mortality [451, 452].
Arginine. Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis,
which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of
microcirculatory regulation, and enhanced production of
superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine supplementation could lead to unwanted vasodilation and
hypotension [452, 453]. Human trials of L-arginine supplementation have generally been small and reported
variable effects on mortality [454–457]. The only study in
septic patients showed improved survival, but had limitations in study design [455]. Other studies suggested no
benefit [449, 454, 455] or possible harm [455] in the
subgroup of septic patients. Some authors found
improvement in secondary outcomes in septic patients,
such as reduced infectious complications [454, 455] and
length of hospital stay [454], but the relevance of these
findings in the face of potential harm is unclear.
Glutamine. Glutamine levels are also reduced during
critical illness. Exogenous supplementation can improve
gut mucosal atrophy and permeability, possibly leading to
reduced bacterial translocation. Other potential benefits
are enhanced immune cell function, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production, and higher levels of
glutathione and antioxidative capacity [452, 453]. However, the clinical significance of these findings is not
clearly established.
Although a previous meta-analysis showed mortality
reduction [428], four other meta-analyses did not [458–
462]. Other small studies not included in those metaanalyses had similar results [463, 464]. Three recent welldesigned studies also failed to show a mortality benefit in
the primary analyses [227, 465, 466], but again, none
focused specifically on septic patients. Two small studies
on septic patients showed no benefit in mortality rates
[467, 468] but a significant reduction in infectious complications [467] and a faster recovery of organ
dysfunction [468]. Some previous individual studies and
meta-analyses showed positive secondary outcomes, such
as reduction in infectious morbidity [461, 462, 465] and
organ dysfunction [462]. Beneficial effects were found
mostly in trials using parenteral rather than enteral glutamine. However, recent and well-sized studies could not
demonstrate a reduction of infectious complications [227]
or organ dysfunction [465, 466], even with parenteral
glutamine. An ongoing trial (REDOXS) of 1,200 patients
will test both enteral and parenteral glutamine and antioxidant supplementation in critically ill, mechanically
ventilated patients [469]. Although no clear benefit could
be demonstrated in clinical trials with supplemental glutamine, there is no sign of harm.
The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) are eicosanoid precursors. The prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes
produced from EPA/GLA are less potent than their
arachidonic acid-derived equivalents, reducing the proinflammatory impact on the immune response [452, 453].
Three early studies were summarized in a meta-analysis
that reported a significant mortality reduction, increased
ventilator-free days, and reduced risk of new organ dysfunction [470]. However, only one study was in septic
patients [471], none was individually powered for mortality [472, 473], and all three used a diet with high
omega-6 lipid content in the control group, which is not
the usual standard of care in the critically ill. The authors
who first reported reduced mortality in sepsis [471] conducted a follow-up multicenter study and again found
improvement in nonmortality outcomes, though notably
with no demonstrable effect on mortality [474]. Other
studies using enteral [475–477] or parenteral [478–480]
fish oil failed to confirm these findings in general critical
illness or acute lung injury. Thus, no large, reproducible
findings suggest a clear benefit in the use of immunomodulating nutritional supplements in sepsis, though
larger trials are ongoing.
W. Setting goals of care
1. We recommend that goals of care and prognosis be
discussed with patients and families (grade 1B).
2. We recommend that the goals of care be incorporated
into treatment and end-of-life care planning, utilizing
palliative care principles where appropriate (grade 1B).
3. We suggest that goals of care be addressed as early as
feasible, but no later than within 72 h of ICU admission
(grade 2C).
Rationale. The majority of ICU patients receive full
support with aggressive, life-sustaining treatments. Many
patients with multiple organ system failure or severe neurologic injuries will not survive or will have a poor quality of
life. Decisions to provide less-aggressive life-sustaining
treatments or to withdraw life-sustaining treatments in these
patients may be in the patient’s best interest and may be what
patients and their families desire [481]. Physicians have
different end-of-life practices based on their region of
practice, culture, and religion [482]. Although the outcome
of intensive care treatment in critically ill patients may be
difficult to prognosticate accurately, establishing realistic
treatment goals is important in promoting patient-centered
care in the ICU [483]. Models for structuring initiatives to
enhance care in the ICU highlight the importance of incorporating goals of care along with the prognosis into
treatment plans [484]. Additionally, discussing the prognosis for achieving the goals of care and level of certainty of
prognosis has been identified as an important component of
surrogate decision-making in the ICU [485, 486]. However,
variations exist in the use of advanced care planning and
integration of palliative and end-of-life care in the ICU,
which can lead to conflicts that may threaten overall quality
198

of care [487, 488]. The use of proactive family care conferences to identify advanced directives and treatment
goals within 72 h of ICU admission promotes communication and understanding between the patient’s family and
the care team; improves family satisfaction; decreases
stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives;
facilitates end-of-life decision making; and shortens
length of stay for patients who die in the ICU [489–494].
Clinical practice guidelines for support of the ICU patient
and family promote: early and repeated care conferencing
to reduce family stress and improve consistency in communication; open flexible visitation; family presence
during clinical rounds and resuscitation; and attention to
cultural and spiritual support [495]. Additionally, the
integration of advanced care planning and palliative care
focused on pain management, symptom control, and
family support has been shown to improve symptom
management and patient comfort, and to improve family
communication [484, 490, 496].
Pediatric considerations in severe sepsis (Table 9)
While sepsis in children is a major cause of death in
industrialized countries with state-of-the-art ICUs, the
overall mortality from severe sepsis is much lower than
that in adults, estimated at about 2–10 % [497–499]. The
hospital mortality rate for severe sepsis is 2 % in previously healthy children and 8 % in chronically ill children
in the US [497]. Definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic
shock, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure syndromes
are similar to adult definitions but depend on age-specific
heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count
cutoff values [500, 501]. This document provides recommendations only for term newborns and children in the
industrialized resource-rich setting with full access to
mechanical ventilation ICUs.
A. Initial resuscitation
1. We suggest starting with oxygen administered by face
mask or, if needed and available, high-flow nasal
cannula oxygen or nasopharyngeal CPAP for respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Peripheral intravenous
access or intraosseous access can be used for fluid
resuscitation and inotrope infusion when a central line
is not available. If mechanical ventilation is required,
then cardiovascular instability during intubation is less
likely after appropriate cardiovascular resuscitation
(grade 2C).
Rationale. Due to low functional residual capacity,
young infants and neonates with severe sepsis may
require early intubation; however, during intubation and
mechanical ventilation, increased intrathoracic pressure
can reduce venous return and lead to worsening shock if
the patient is not volume loaded. In those who desaturate
despite administration of face mask oxygen, high-flow
nasal cannula oxygen or nasopharyngeal CPAP can be
used to increase functional residual capacity and reduce
the work of breathing, allowing for establishment of
intravenous or intraosseous access for fluid resuscitation
and peripheral inotrope delivery [502, 503]. Drugs used
for sedation have important side effects in these patients.
For example, etomidate is associated with increased
mortality in children with meningococcal sepsis because
of adrenal suppression effect [504, 505]. Because
attainment of central access is more difficult in children
than adults, reliance on peripheral or intraosseous access
can be substituted until and unless central access is
available.
2. We suggest that the initial therapeutic endpoints of
resuscitation of septic shock be capillary refill of B2 s,
normal blood pressure for age, normal pulses with no
differential between peripheral and central pulses,
warm extremities, urine output [1 mL kg-1 h-1
, and
normal mental status. Thereafter, ScvO2 saturation
greater than or equal to 70 % and cardiac index
between 3.3 and 6.0 L min-1 m-2 should be targeted
(grade 2C).
Rationale. Adult guidelines recommend lactate clearance as well, but children commonly have normal lactate
levels with septic shock. Because of the many modalities
used to measure ScvO2 and cardiac index, the specific
choice is left to the practitioner’s discretion [506–512].
3. We recommend following the American College of
Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines for the management of septic shock
(grade 1C).
Rationale. The recommended guidelines are summarized in Fig. 2 [510–512].
4. We recommend evaluating for and reversing pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or endocrine emergencies
in patients with refractory shock (grade 1C).
Rationale. Endocrine emergencies include hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism. In select patients, intraabdominal hypertension may also need to be considered
[513–515].
199

Table 9 Recommendations: special considerations in pediatrics
A. Initial resuscitation
1. For respiratory distress and hypoxemia start with face mask oxygen or if needed and available, high flow nasal cannula oxygen or nasopharyngeal CPAP
(NP CPAP). For improved circulation, peripheral intravenous access or intraosseus access can be used for fluid resuscitation and inotrope infusion when
a central line is not available. If mechanical ventilation is required then cardiovascular instability during intubation is less likely after appropriate
cardiovascular resuscitation (grade 2C).
2. Initial therapeutic end points of resuscitation of septic shock: capillary refill of B2 s, normal blood pressure for age, normal pulses with no differential
between peripheral and central pulses, warm extremities, urine output [1 mL kg-1 h-1
, and normal mental status. ScvO2 saturation C70% and
cardiac index between 3.3 and 6.0 L/min/m2 should be targeted thereafter (grade 2C).
3. Follow American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Life Support ( ACCM-PALS) guidelines for the management of septic shock (grade 1C).
4. Evaluate for and reverse pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or endocrine emergencies in patients with refractory shock (grade 1C).
B. Antibiotics and source control
1. Empiric antibiotics be administered within 1 hr of the identification of severe sepsis. Blood cultures should be obtained before administering antibiotics
when possible but this should not delay administration of antibiotics. The empiric drug choice should be changed as epidemic and endemic ecologies
dictate (eg H1N1, MRSA, chloroquine resistant malaria, penicillin-resistant pneumococci,recent ICU stay, neutropenia) (grade 1D).
2. Clindamycin and anti-toxin therapies for toxic shock syndromes with refractory hypotension (grade 2D).
3. Early and aggressive source control (grade 1D).
4. Clostridium difficile colitis should be treated with enteral antibiotics if tolerated. Oral vancomycin is preferred for severe disease (grade 1A).
C. Fluid resuscitation
1. In the industrialized world with access to inotropes and mechanical ventilation, initial resuscitation of hypovolemic shock begins with infusion of
isotonic crystalloids or albumin with boluses of up to 20 mL/kg crystalloids (or albumin equivalent ) over 5–10 minutes, titrated to reversing
hypotension, increasing urine output, and attaining normal capillary refill, peripheral pulses, and level of consciousness without inducing hepatomegaly
or rales. If hepatomegaly or rales exist then inotropic support should be implemented, not fluid resuscitation. In non-hypotensive children with severe
hemolytic anemia (severe malaria or sickle cell crises) blood transfusion is considered superior to crystalloid or albumin bolusing (grade 2C).
D. Inotropes/vasopressors/vasodilators
1. Begin peripheral inotropic support until central venous access can be attained in children who are not responsive to fluid resuscitation (grade 2C).
2. Patients with low cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance states with normal blood pressure be given vasodilator therapies in addition to
inotropes (grade 2C).
E. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
1. Consider ECMO for refractory pediatric septic shock and respiratory failure (grade 2C).
F. Corticosteroids
1. Timely hydrocortisone therapy in children with fluid refractory, catecholamine resistant shock and suspected or proven absolute (classic) adrenal
insufficiency (grade 1 A) .
G. Protein C and activated protein concentrate
No recommendation as no longer available
H. Blood products and plasma therapies
1. Similar hemoglobin targets in children as in adults. During resuscitation of low superior vena cava oxygen saturation shock (\70 %), hemoglobin levels
of 10 g/dL are targeted. After stabilization and recovery from shock and hypoxemia then a lower target[7.0 g/dL can be considered reasonable (grade
1B).
2. Similar platelet transfusion targets in children as in adults (grade 2C).
3. Use plasma therapies in children to correct sepsis-induced thrombotic purpura disorders, including progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation,
secondary thrombotic microangiopathy, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (grade 2C).
I. Mechanical ventilation
1. Lung-protective strategies during mechanical ventilation (grade 2C).
J. Sedation/analgesia/drug toxicities
1. We recommend use of sedation with a sedation goal in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis (grade 1D).
2. Monitor drug toxicity labs because drug metabolism is reduced during severe sepsis, putting children at greater risk of adverse drug-related events
(grade 1C).
K. Glycemic control
1. Control hyperglycemia using a similar target as in adults B180 mg/dL. Glucose infusion should accompany insulin therapy in newborns and children
because some hyperglycemic children make no insulin whereas others are insulin resistant (grade 2C).
L. Diuretics and renal replacement therapy
1. Use diuretics to reverse fluid overload when shock has resolved, and if unsuccessful then continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) or intermittent
dialysis to prevent[10 % total body weight fluid overload (grade 2C).
M. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis
No recommendation on the use of DVT prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe sepsis.
N. Stress ulcer (SU) prophylaxis
No recommendation on the use of SU prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe sepsis
O. Nutrition
1. Enteral nutrition given to children who can be fed enterally, and parenteral feeding in those who cannot (grade 2C).
200

B. Antibiotics and source control
1. We recommend that empiric antimicrobials be administered within 1 h of the identification of severe sepsis.
Blood cultures should be obtained before administering
antibiotics when possible, but this should not delay initiation of antibiotics. The empiric drug choice should be
changed as epidemic and endemic ecologies dictate (e.g.,
H1N1, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, chloroquineresistant malaria, penicillin-resistant pneumococci,
recent ICU stay, neutropenia) (grade 1D).
Rationale. Vascular access and blood drawing is
more difficult in newborns and children. Antimicrobials can be given intramuscularly or orally (if
tolerated) until intravenous line access is available
[516–519].

2. We suggest the use of clindamycin and antitoxin
therapies for toxic shock syndromes with refractory
hypotension (grade 2D).
Rationale. Children are more prone to toxic shock than
adults because of their lack of circulating antibodies to
toxins. Children with severe sepsis and erythroderma and
suspected toxic shock should be treated with clindamycin
to reduce toxin production. The role of IVIG in toxic
shock syndrome is unclear, but it may be considered in
refractory toxic shock syndrome [520–527].
3. We recommend early and aggressive infection source
control (grade 1D).
Rationale. De´bridement and source control is paramount in severe sepsis and septic shock. Conditions
requiring de´bridement or drainage include necrotizing
pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, gangrenous myonecrosis, empyema, and abscesses. Perforated viscus requires
repair and peritoneal washout. Delay in use of an appropriate antibiotic, inadequate source control, and failure to
remove infected devices are associated with increased
mortality in a synergistic manner [528–538].
4. C. difficile colitis should be treated with enteral
antibiotics if tolerated. Oral vancomycin is preferred
for severe disease (grade 1A).
Rationale. In adults, metronidazole is a first choice;
however, response to treatment with C. difficile can be
best with enteral vancomycin. In very severe cases where
diverting ileostomy or colectomy is performed, parenteral
treatment should be considered until clinical improvement
is ascertained [539–541].
C. Fluid resuscitation
1. In the industrialized world with access to inotropes and
mechanical ventilation, we suggest that initial resuscitation of hypovolemic shock begin with infusion of
isotonic crystalloids or albumin, with boluses of up to
20 mL/kg for crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over
5–10 min. These should be titrated to reversing
hypotension, increasing urine output, and attaining
normal capillary refill, peripheral pulses and level of
consciousness without inducing hepatomegaly or rales.
If hepatomegaly or rales develop, inotropic support
should be implemented, not fluid resuscitation. In
children with severe hemolytic anemia (severe malaria
or sickle cell crises) who are not hypotensive, blood
transfusion is considered superior to crystalloid or
albumin bolusing (grade 2C).
Rationale. Three RCTs compared the use of colloid to
crystalloid resuscitation in children with hypovolemic
dengue shock with near 100 % survival in all treatment
arms [542–544]. In the industrialized world, two beforeand-after studies observed tenfold reductions in mortality
when children with purpura/meningococcal septic shock
were treated with fluid boluses, inotropes, and mechanical
ventilation in the community emergency department [545,
546]. In one randomized trial, septic shock mortality was
reduced (40–12 %) when increased fluid boluses, blood,
and inotropes were given to attain a ScvO2 monitoring
goal of greater than 70 % [511]. A quality improvement
study achieved a reduction in severe sepsis mortality
(from 4.0 to 2.4 %) with the delivery of fluid boluses and
antibiotics in the first hour in a pediatric emergency
department to reverse clinical signs of shock [547].
Children normally have a lower blood pressure than
adults, and a fall in blood pressure can be prevented by
vasoconstriction and increasing heart rate. Therefore,
blood pressure alone is not a reliable endpoint for
assessing the adequacy of resuscitation. However, once
hypotension occurs, cardiovascular collapse may soon
follow. Thus, fluid resuscitation is recommended for both
normotensive and hypotensive children in hypovolemic
shock [542–554]. Because hepatomegaly and/or rales
occur in children who are fluid overloaded, these findings
can be helpful signs of hypervolemia. In the absence of
these signs, large fluid deficits can exist, and initial
volume resuscitation can require 40–60 mL/kg or more;
however, if these signs are present, then fluid administration should be ceased and diuretics should be given.
Inotrope infusions and mechanical ventilation are commonly required for children with fluid refractory shock.
D. Inotropes/vasopressors/vasodilators
1. We suggest beginning peripheral inotropic support
until central venous access can be attained in children
who are not responsive to fluid resuscitation (grade
2C).
Rationale. Cohort studies show that delay in the use of
inotropic therapies is associated with major increases in
mortality risk [553, 554]. This delay is often related to
difficulty in attaining central access. In the initial resuscitation phase, inotrope/vasopressor therapy may be
required to sustain perfusion pressure, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. Children with severe
sepsis can present with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance, high cardiac output and low
systemic vascular resistance, or low cardiac output and
202

low systemic vascular resistance shock [555]. A child
may move from one hemodynamic state to another.
Vasopressor or inotrope therapy should be used according
to the hemodynamic state [555]. Dopamine-refractory
shock may reverse with epinephrine or norepinephrine
infusion. In the case of extremely low systemic vascular
resistance despite the use of norepinephrine, the use of
vasopressin and terlipressin has been described in a
number of case reports, yet evidence to support this in
pediatric sepsis, as well as safety data, are still lacking.
Indeed, two RCTs showed no benefit in outcome with use
of vasopressin or terlipressin in children [556–559].
Interestingly, while vasopressin levels are reduced in
adults with septic shock, such levels seem to vary
extensively in children. When vasopressors are used for
refractory hypotension, the addition of inotropes is commonly needed to maintain adequate cardiac output [510,
511, 555].
2. We suggest that patients with low cardiac output and
elevated systemic vascular resistance states with
normal blood pressure be given vasodilator therapies
in addition to inotropes (grade 2C).
Rationale. The choice of vasoactive agent is initially
determined by the clinical examination; however, for the
child with invasive monitoring in place and demonstration
of a persistent low cardiac output state with high systemic
vascular resistance and normal blood pressure despite
fluid resuscitation and inotropic support, vasodilator
therapy can reverse shock. Type III phosphodiesterase
inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone, enoximone) and the
calcium sensitizer levosimendan can be helpful because
they overcome receptor desensitization. Other important
vasodilators include nitrosovasodilators, prostacyclin, and
fenoldopam. In two RCTs, pentoxifylline reduced mortality from severe sepsis in newborns [510, 560–569].
E. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
1. We suggest ECMO in children with refractory septic
shock or with refractory respiratory failure associated
with sepsis (grade 2C).
Rationale. ECMO may be used to support children and
neonates with septic shock or sepsis-associated respiratory failure [570, 571]. The survival of septic patients
supported with ECMO is 73 % for newborns and 39 %
for older children, and is highest in those receiving
venovenous ECMO [572]. Forty-one percent of children
with a diagnosis of sepsis requiring ECMO for respiratory
failure survive to hospital discharge [573]. Venoarterial
ECMO is useful in children with refractory septic shock
[574], with one center reporting 74 % survival to hospital
discharge using central cannulation via sternotomy [575].
ECMO has been used successfully in critically ill H1N1
pediatric patients with refractory respiratory failure [576,
577].
F. Corticosteroids
1. We suggest timely hydrocortisone therapy in children
with fluid-refractory, catecholamine-resistant shock
and suspected or proven absolute (classic) adrenal
insufficiency (grade 1A).
Rationale. Approximately 25 % of children with septic
shock have absolute adrenal insufficiency. Patients at risk
for absolute adrenal insufficiency include children with
severe septic shock and purpura, those who have previously received steroid therapies for chronic illness, and
children with pituitary or adrenal abnormalities. Initial
treatment is hydrocortisone infusion given at stress doses
(50 mg/m2
/24 h); however, infusions up to 50 mg kg-1
day-1 may be required to reverse shock in the short term.
Death from absolute adrenal insufficiency and septic
shock occurs within 8 h of presentation. Obtaining a
serum cortisol level at the time empiric hydrocortisone is
administered may be helpful [578–583].
G. Protein C and activated protein concentrate
See ‘‘History of recommendations regarding use of
recombinant activated protein C’’.
H. Blood products and plasma therapies
1. We suggest similar hemoglobin targets in children as
in adults. During resuscitation of low superior vena
cava oxygen saturation shock (\70 %), hemoglobin
levels of 10 g/dL are targeted. After stabilization and
recovery from shock and hypoxemia, then a lower target
[7.0 g/dL can be considered reasonable (grade 1B).
Rationale. The optimal hemoglobin for a critically ill
child with severe sepsis is not known. A recent multicenter trial reported no difference in mortality in
hemodynamically stable critically ill children managed
with a transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL compared with
those managed with a transfusion threshold of 9.5 g/dL;
however, the severe sepsis subgroup had an increase in
nosocomial sepsis and lacked clear evidence of equivalence in outcomes with the restrictive strategy [584, 585].
Blood transfusion is recommended by the World Health
Organization for severe anemia, hemoglobin value\5 g/
dL, and acidosis. A RCT of early goal-directed therapy for
203

pediatric septic shock using the threshold hemoglobin of
10 g/dL for patients with a SvcO2 saturation less than 70 % in
the first 72 h of pediatric ICU admission showed improved
survival in the multimodal intervention arm [511].
2. We suggest similar platelet transfusion targets in
children as in adults (grade 2C).
3. We suggest the use of plasma therapies in children to
correct sepsis-induced thrombotic purpura disorders,
including progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation, secondary thrombotic microangiopathy, and
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (grade 2C).
Rationale. We give plasma to reverse thrombotic microangiopathies in children with thrombocytopenia-associated
multiple organ failure and progressive purpura because
fresh frozen plasma contains protein C, antithrombin III,
and other anticoagulant proteins. Rapid resuscitation of
shock reverses most disseminated intravascular coagulation; however, purpura progresses in some children in part
due to critical consumption of antithrombotic proteins (e.g.,
protein C, antithrombin III, ADAMTS 13). Plasma is
infused with the goal of correcting prolonged prothrombin/
partial thromboplastin times and halting purpura. Large
volumes of plasma require concomitant use of diuretics,
continuous renal replacement therapy, or plasma exchange
to prevent greater than 10 % fluid overload [586–611].
I. Mechanical ventilation
1. We suggest providing lung-protective strategies during
mechanical ventilation (grade 2C).
Rationale. Some patients with ARDS will require
increased PEEP to attain functional residual capacity and
maintain oxygenation, and peak pressures above
30–35 cmH2O to attain effective tidal volumes of 6–8 mL/kg
with adequate CO2 removal. In these patients, physicians
generally transition from conventional pressure control ventilation to pressure release ventilation (airway pressure release
ventilation) or to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
These modes maintain oxygenation with higher mean airway
pressures using an ‘‘open’’ lung ventilation strategy. To be
effective, these modes can require a mean airway pressure
5 cmH2O higher than that used with conventional ventilation.
This can reduce venous return leading to greater need for fluid
resuscitation and vasopressor requirements [612–616].
J. Sedation/analgesia/drug toxicities
1. We recommend use of sedation with a sedation goal in
critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis
(grade 1D).
Rationale. Although there are no data supporting any
particular drugs or regimens, propofol should not be used
for long-term sedation in children younger than 3 years
because of the reported association with fatal metabolic
acidosis. The use of etomidate and/or dexmedetomidine
during septic shock should be discouraged, or at least
considered carefully, because these drugs inhibit the
adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system,
respectively, both of which are needed for hemodynamic
stability [617–620].
2. We recommend monitoring drug toxicity labs because
drug metabolism is reduced during severe sepsis,
putting children at greater risk of adverse drug-related
events (grade 1C).
Rationale. Children with severe sepsis have reduced
drug metabolism [621].
K. Glycemic control
1. We suggest controlling hyperglycemia using a similar
target as in adults (B180 mg/dL). Glucose infusion
should accompany insulin therapy in newborns and
children (grade 2C).
Rationale. In general, infants are at risk for developing
hypoglycemia when they depend on intravenous fluids.
This means that a glucose intake of 4–6 mg kg-1 min-1
or maintenance fluid intake with dextrose 10 % normal
saline containing solution is advised (6–8 mg kg-1 min-1
in newborns). Associations have been reported between
hyperglycemia and an increased risk of death and longer
length of stay. A retrospective pediatric ICU study
reported associations of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia,
and glucose variability with increased length of stay and
mortality rates. An RCT of strict glycemic control compared to moderate control using insulin in a pediatric ICU
population found a reduction in mortality with an increase
in hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy should only be conducted with frequent glucose monitoring in view of the
risks for hypoglycemia which can be greater in newborns
and children due to a) relative lack of glycogen stores and
muscle mass for gluconeogenesis, and b) the heterogeneity of the population with some excreting no
endogenous insulin and others demonstrating high insulin
levels and insulin resistance [622–628].
L. Diuretics and renal replacement therapy
1. We suggest the use of diuretics to reverse fluid overload when shock has resolved and if unsuccessful, then
continuous venovenous hemofiltration or intermittent
204

dialysis to prevent greater than 10 % total body weight
fluid overload (grade 2C).
Rationale. A retrospective study of children with
meningococcemia showed an associated mortality risk
when children received too little or too much fluid
resuscitation [549, 553]. A retrospective study of 113
critically ill children with multiple-organ dysfunction
syndrome reported that patients with less fluid overload
before continuous venovenous hemofiltration had better
survival [629–631],
M. DVT prophylaxis
1. We make no graded recommendations on the use of
DVT prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe
sepsis.
Rationale. Most DVTs in young children are associated
with central venous catheters. Heparin-bonded catheters
may decrease the risk of catheter-associated DVT. No
data exist on the efficacy of UFH or LMWH prophylaxis
to prevent catheter-related DVT in children in the ICU
[632, 633].
N. Stress ulcer prophylaxis
1. We make no graded recommendations on stress ulcer
prophylaxis.
Rationale. Studies have shown that clinically important
GI bleeding in children occurs at rates similar to those of
adults. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is commonly used in
children who are mechanically ventilated, usually with H2
blockers or proton pump inhibitors, although Its effect is
not known [634, 635].
O. Nutrition
1. Enteral nutrition should be used in children who can
tolerate it, parenteral feeding in those who cannot
(grade 2C).
Rationale. Dextrose 10 % (always with sodium-containing solution in children) at maintenance rate provides
the glucose delivery requirements for newborns and
children [636]. Patients with sepsis have increased glucose delivery needs which can be met by this regimen.
Specific measurement of caloric requirements are thought
to be best attained using a metabolic cart as they are
generally less in the critically ill child than in the healthy
child.
Summary and future directions
Although this document is static, the optimum treatment
of severe sepsis and septic shock is a dynamic and
evolving process. Additional evidence that has appeared
since the publication of the 2008 guidelines allows more
certainty with which we make severe sepsis recommendations; however, further programmatic clinical research
in sepsis is essential to optimize these evidence-based
medicine recommendations.
New interventions will be proven and established
interventions may need modification. This publication
represents an ongoing process. The SSC and the consensus committee members are committed to updating the
guidelines regularly as new interventions are tested and
results published.
