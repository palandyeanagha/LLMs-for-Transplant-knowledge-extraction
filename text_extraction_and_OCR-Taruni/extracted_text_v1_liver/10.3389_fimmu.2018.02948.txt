Acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ALF and ACLF), though distinct clinical entities,
are considered syndromes of innate immune dysfunction. Patients with ALF and ACLF
display evidence of a pro-inflammatory state with local liver inflammation, features of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and vascular endothelial dysfunction
that drive progression to multi-organ failure. In an apparent paradox, these patients
are concurrently immunosuppressed, exhibiting acquired immune defects that render
them highly susceptible to infections. This paradigm of tissue injury succeeded by
immunosuppression is seen in other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, which
share poor outcomes and infective complications that account for high morbidity and
mortality. Monocyte and macrophage dysfunction are central to disease progression of
ALF and ACLF. Activation of liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) by pathogen and
damage associated molecular patterns leads to the recruitment of innate effector cells
to the injured liver. Early monocyte infiltration may contribute to local tissue destruction
during the propagation phase and results in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
that drive SIRS. In the hepatic microenvironment, recruited monocytes mature into
macrophages following local reprogramming so as to promote resolution responses in a
drive to maintain tissue integrity. Intra-hepatic events may affect circulating monocytes
through spill over of soluble mediators and exposure to apoptotic cell debris during
passage through the liver. Hence, peripheral monocytes show numerous acquired
defects in acute liver failure syndromes that impair their anti-microbial programmes and
contribute to enhanced susceptibility to sepsis. This review will highlight the cellular
and molecular mechanisms by which monocytes and macrophages contribute to the
pathophysiology of ALF and ACLF, considering both hepatic inflammation and systemic
immunosuppression. We identify areas for further research and potential targets for
immune-based therapies to treat these devastating conditions.

INTRODUCTION
The liver is a unique innate immune environment and exerts
crucial immune surveillance functions during homeostasis (1, 2).
It has a dual blood supply, thus it is constantly exposed to
circulating antigens, pathogens, pathogen-associated toxins, and
danger signals which reach the liver from the gastrointestinal
tract, via the portal vein, or from the systemic circulation via
arterial blood (3). Hence, it is an important line of defense and
plays a central role in regulating tolerogenic and inflammatory
responses (1, 2). For such purposes, the liver shows a high
degree of vascularization, slow blood flow through the sinusoidal
system and highly permeable fenestrated endothelia allowing
direct access to liver immune cells from the blood stream
(1, 2). The liver houses an abundant population of tissueresident macrophages, as intrasinusoidal Kupffer cells (KC),
which function as the dominant phagocytes in the liver and
compose over 80% of the body’s macrophages in states of health.
It also contains other myeloid [neutrophils and dendritic cells
(DCs)] and lymphoid [T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NK
T cells] cells that shape innate and adaptive immune responses
(2, 4). They are organized in a manner designed to maximize
screening for both systemic and gut-derived pathogens, thereby
avoiding their systemic spread (5).
While macrophages contribute during the maintenance of
homeostasis, they are equally relevant in responses to liver
injury, playing key roles in the initiation and progression of
liver diseases (1, 2). During injury, the liver macrophage pool is
augmented by recruitment of bone-marrow derived monocytes
which mature in situ into macrophages and contribute to
the development and resolution of hepatic inflammation.
Macrophage-mediated inflammation may also give rise to
systemic consequences. This is perhaps best typified by the
conditions of acute liver failure (ALF) and acute-on-chronic
liver failure (ACLF), which are characterized by local hepatic
inflammation complicated by a systemic inflammation and
subsequent systemic immunosuppression. Patients therefore
experience symptoms of liver decompensation, accompanied
by a systemic inflammatory response that involves endothelial
dysfunction and may progress to multi-organ failure along with
susceptibility to secondary infections. In this review, we will
consider how monocytes and macrophages contribute to the
initiation and propagation of local liver inflammation in ALF and
ACLF; how they drive systemic immune dysfunction and what
immunotherapeutic strategies could be used to target their role.
THE CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF ALF AND
ACLF
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare condition in which
coagulopathy, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy arise in the
context of an acute hepatic injury and the absence of chronic
liver disease (CLD) (6). Various sub-categorizations of ALF have
been proposed which use the interval between the development
of jaundice and emergence of hepatic encephalopathy to
differentiate patients with rapidly progressive “hyperacute”
disease from those with a more indolent (“subacute”) clinical
course in whom the outcome is generally poorer. In the UK
and USA, acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) overdose is the
commonest cause of ALF and is characterized by the rapid
progression of symptoms over a few days (6). In many other
parts of the world acute viral hepatitis is the dominant cause of
ALF (7). Idiosyncratic drug reactions, hepatic ischemic insults,
autoimmune hepatitis, and seronegative disease account for a
significant minority of cases and tend to run a slower clinical
course (Table 1). A common feature which is shared by all these
conditions is hepatocellular loss of a magnitude and at a rate
which exceeds the liver’s regenerative capacity. Hepatocyte death
results in synthetic “loss of function” features such as jaundice
and coagulopathy. Significantly, this overwhelming cell death
also provokes a robust innate immune response which drives
many of the other clinical features of ALF, as will be discussed
below.
Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), in contrast, occurs
in patients with pre-existing liver disease. The exact definition
of ACLF has been debated in the community, with the
Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL),

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD),
The European Association for the Study of the Liverchronic liver failure (EASL-CLIF) consortium and the World
Gastroenterology Organization (WGO), all having formalized
definitions within the last decade. The WGO working party
definition, published in 2014, states: “ACLF is a syndrome in
patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously
diagnosed cirrhosis which is characterized by acute hepatic
decompensation resulting in liver failure (jaundice + prolonged
international normalized ratio) and one or more extrahepatic
organ failure that is associated with increased mortality within
a period of 28 days and up to 3 months from onset” (8). Key
features of this definition are the presence of chronic liver disease
and occurrence of acute hepatic dysfunction with synthetic
failure that progresses to cause extrahepatic organ failure. The
EASL-CLIF definition is important in its distinction that the
CLD must be cirrhosis. This more selective population, of
patients developing ACLF in the context of cirrhosis, is the best
characterized, with much of the evidence base coming from
studies that use the EASL-CLIF definition.
Typical events that precipitate ACLF are infections,
gastrointestinal bleeds, viral reactivation, and superimposed
drug, viral, or ischaemic insults (9, 10) (Table 1). Patients with
ACLF experience a high mortality compared to those with
uncomplicated decompensation of chronic liver disease and, as
would be expected, mortality increases with the severity of extra
hepatic organ failure. The 28 day and 90 day mortality from an
acute decompensation of cirrhosis are 5 and 14% respectively,
whereas for ACLF they range from 22–78 to 41–79% depending
on the grade (11).
In both ALF and ACLF, infections are key drivers or
life-threatening complicating factors in these syndromes.
Discounting the etiological hepatotropic viruses, bacterial
infections are the primary microbial clinical issue in liver
failure. In ALF bacterial infection occurs in up to a third of
patients (12) and is late-onset (>5 days since hospital admission)
and predominantly related to gram positive organisms (13).
This is postulated to be a consequence of ALF-associated
immunosuppression and the invasive nature of critical care
support predisposing to nosocomial infections. By contrast,
patients with ACLF can suffer from mainly gram negative
bacterial infection (14) as a cause for their deterioration,
potentiated by high levels of bacterial translocation from the gut,
but are also at further risk of secondary nosocomial sepsis during
hospital episodes for similar reasons as ALF patients.
MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES IN
THE INITIATION OF HEPATIC
INFLAMMATION: SENSING DAMPS AND
PAMPS
The innate immune system is primed to respond to invading
pathogens, through recognition of unique microbial molecular
motifs, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) (15). PAMPs are recognized via pattern-recognition
receptors (PRRs), in a process called structural feature
recognition. However, innate immune-mediated inflammation
also occurs in the absence of infection. Termed sterile
inflammation, this state is induced by release of host-derived
products, called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
during tissue damage (2, 15). DAMPs, which are normally
sequestered inside cells, interact with PRRs on immune cells and
initiate an inflammatory response (4). In the liver, well described
DAMPs include the high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1)
protein, IL-1α, IL-33, ATP, S100-calcium-binding-proteinA8/A9 (S100A8/9), mitochondrial DNA, histone-associated
DNA, purines, heat-shock proteins, and bile acids (2, 3, 15–24).
Their activity is mediated through PRRs expressed on liver
immune cells such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs), purinergic
receptors and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products
(RAGE) (2, 15). Ligation of DAMPs to their receptors results
in activation of immune cells, which shifts them toward a
pro-inflammatory phenotype, thus initiating an inflammatory
signal through cytokine and chemokine release, which in turn
amplify and sustain the inflammatory response (25).
Liver inflammation can be initiated by various DAMPs and
PAMPs and is a major component of the immunopathology of
a variety of liver diseases including ALF, ACLF, liver cirrhosis,
alcoholic liver disease (ALD), liver fibrosis and cancer (2, 15).
As described above, ALF is characterized by massive, rapid
hepatocyte death which can occur by either necrotic or apoptotic
pathways (26, 27). The result of hepatocyte necrosis is the
release of DAMPs (25). Liver-resident KCs highly express various
DAMP receptors (e.g., P2X7, TLR4, TLR9 and RAGE) thus
mediate the initial response to injury (25). After acetaminophen
overdose, oxidative stress and direct mitochondrial damage are
induced in hepatocytes, which consequently release DAMPs
that can be recognized by KCs (Figure 1). In turn, activated
KCs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and chemokines (e.g., CCL2) that amplify
the pro-inflammatory signal and increase the recruitment of
bone-marrow derived cells into the liver, mainly neutrophils
and monocytes, thereby enhancing the inflammatory process
(2, 15). The sustained KC-released cytokines can also recruit
other inflammatory cell subsets, such as eosinophils, DCs, and T
cells. While the specific roles of these cell are not fully investigated
in ALF, they have been implicated in drug-induced liver injury
(2, 15). In ACLF, with a reduced baseline hepatic reserve and
longstanding circulatory dysfunction, the initiating event may
be lower volume hepatocyte death, which nonetheless causes
release of DAMPs and incitement of inflammation (Figure 1).
Alternatively, systemic infection may lead to development of
ACLF in which inflammation is triggered by an enhanced
systemic exposure to PAMPs (10, 28).
In experimental models of ALF and ACLF and in patients
with both conditions, a number of DAMPs have been implicated
in disease pathogenesis. HMGB-1, perhaps one of the best
characterized DAMPs, is a highly conserved chromatin binding
protein that is usually located in the cell nucleus (29). During
necrotic cell death HMGB-1, along with other nuclear contents,
is passively released as cell membrane integrity fails. Released
into the local tissue environment and the circulation, HMGB-1
signals through TLR-4 and RAGE receptor on KCs to upregulate
NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (20).
HMGB-1 in a hyper-acetylated form may also be released by

FIGURE 1 | Monocytes and macrophages in the immunopathology of acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. (Left) Different causes lead to development of acute
(bottom) and acute-on-chronic (top) liver failure. A major component of the immunopathology of both syndromes is liver inflammation initiated by release of various
DAMPs and DAMPs/PAMPs, respectively. (Right) During these syndromes, there is a reciprocal interaction of the immune responses between the liver and systemic
circulation throughout the different phases. Initiation phase: Kupffer cells become activated after recognition of PAMPs/DAMPs and initiate a pro-inflammatory
response. Propagation phase: Bone-marrow derived monocytes are recruited to the liver and differentiate into inflammatory macrophages, expanding the
macrophage pool and promoting tissue destruction. During the propagation phase, innate immune activation is self-perpetuating with recruitment of effector cells
driving further cytokine and chemokine production; their release to systemic circulation provokes SIRS. These macrophage-derived mediators contribute to vascular
endothelial dysfunction and microcirculatory disturbances, resulting in extra-hepatic organ dysfunction. In parallel to SIRS, a CARS develops that is due to release of
anti-inflammatory mediators from the liver. Resolution/tissue-repair phase: In response to anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators and efferocytosis of apoptotic cells,
macrophages undergo functional reprogramming toward a pro-restorative phenotype, favoring resolution, and tissue recovery. “Spill over” of anti-inflammatory
mediators from the liver to systemic circulation enhances CARS and causes monocyte functional reprogramming toward a pro-restorative phenotype, eventually
leading to relative immunosuppression that predisposes susceptibility to infectious complications. CARS, compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome; CD,

activated monocytes and macrophages. In human paracetamolinduced ALF, HMGB-1 has been shown to be an early biomarker,
predicting which patients at presentation will go on to develop
acute liver injury (30). High levels of total and acetylated
HMGB-1 are also correlated with worse prognosis in patients
with ALF (31). Evidence from experimental models suggest
HMGB-1 is of mechanistic importance in the pathogenesis
of ALF, not merely an epiphenomenon. HMGB-1 neutralizing
antibodies are shown to ameliorate injury and reduce bacterial
translocation in murine models of paracetamol-induced ALF
(21, 32). In patients with hepatitis B related ACLF, HMGB1 has been shown to be significantly elevated compared with
CLD patients, however does not have prognostic value in these
patients (33, 34).
Histones are other nuclear structural proteins that when
released in an uncontrolled manner during necrotic cell death
can act as DAMPs to initiate inflammation. In a study of a
cohort of ALF patients predominantly with acute viral hepatitis,
extracellular histones were shown to be elevated and correlate
with disease severity and outcome (35). In hepatitis B related

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
ACLF levels of extracellular histones were significantly elevated
compared with patients with CLD and correlated with clinical
evidence of systemic inflammation, severity, and patient outcome
(36). Histones act to initiate inflammation through the TLR2 and
TLR4 receptors and are shown to activate the nod-like receptor
family pyrin-domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in
immune cells, a signaling pathway leading to IL-1β production.
Extracellular histones are directly toxic to endothelial cells and
have been linked to the propagation of tissue injury and systemic
endothelial dysfunction in sepsis (37). Animal studies and ex vivo
human work has shown that targeted anti-histone treatments
can reduce monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine production and
reduce the severity of ALF (24). Other DAMPs associated with
initiation of inflammation in ALF/ACLF include the extracellular
ATP signaling via the purinergic P2X7 receptor, extracellular
DNA signaling through TLR9, and cyclophilin A (10, 15, 23, 25,
38, 39), as summarized in (Table 1).
PAMPs and DAMPs can collectively contribute to local
and systemic inflammation in a variety of liver diseases (25,
40). Several pathologies, including ALF and ACLF, straddle
the border between sterile and pathogen-induced inflammation
which although are conceptually distinct, largely overlap at a
functional level (4). For example, in ALD ethanol-induced liver
damage results in released of various DAMPs; however, ethanol
exposure also increases intestinal permeability and results in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leakage, a bacterial-derived PAMP,
from commensal intestinal flora to the blood supply to the liver
(4, 41). LPS binds to and activates KCs that in turn produce
inflammatory cytokines and promote hepatocyte damage (4, 41).
In addition, the innate immune system has evolved to use
shared PRRs to detect both sterile and infectious insults. Bacterial
constituents, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or free bacterial
DNA may stimulate the innate immune system via the same
PRRs that are used by DAMPs. For instance, TLR4 can be
activated by both LPS and HMGB-1 (37, 39). Bacterial infection
is one of the commonest precipitating factors in ACLF, and
even in the absence of overt sepsis, ACLF may be initiated by
events that increase bacterial translocation from the gut into
the portal circulation. Taken together, although some forms
of sterile liver injury may in fact respond solely to DAMP
release, many of these can be complicated by a response to
PAMPs.
MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL
INFLAMMATION IN LIVER FAILURE
SYNDROMES: RECRUITMENT AND
FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
Liver Macrophage Plasticity
Macrophages are characterized by their broad diversity and
plasticity; in response to injury or infection, they secrete
pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen/nitrogen
species that aid their antimicrobial responses (42, 43). During
homeostatic conditions, local micro-environmental cues
induce macrophages to adopt phenotypes linked with tissue
repair and remodeling (42, 43). Based on their differentiation
status, macrophages were traditionally categorized into proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory/wound-healing
(M2) (42, 44). However, extensive transcriptomic analyses of
human MoMFs, cultured with different stimuli (e.g., cytokines,
fatty acids, or lipopolysaccharides), revealed a spectrum of
macrophage activation states that are not adequately described
by the M1/M2 dichotomy (45). Firstly, the signals received
by macrophages in their local microenvironment are diverse
and temporally and spatially dynamic (42, 43). Secondly,
macrophages not only respond with diverse phenotypes but
can also reversibly switch from one type to another (46, 47).
A newly proposed way of looking at macrophage polarization
is to consider a multidimensional model including the source
of macrophages, their specific microenvironments with local
signals and a collection of macrophage markers (42, 43).
The liver contains the largest proportion of macrophages
among all solid organs in the body (48, 49). Macrophages
are a key cellular component of the liver; studies in mouse
livers estimate that every 100 hepatocytes are accompanied by
20–40 macrophages (1). Due to their inherent plasticity, liver
macrophages flexibly respond to differential environments and
adopt to the educative signals arising from parenchymal and
other immune cells within the liver (50, 51). Hence, they execute
diverse functions during liver inflammation, ranging from tissuedestructive to resolution and pro-restorative roles (47). Liver
macrophages secrete high levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen
species and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and
therefore can regulate both innate and adaptive immune
responses. They influence the different phases following liver
injury by promoting the clearance of cell debris, extracellular
matrix remodeling, tissue regeneration, and inflammatory
resolution (2). In line with the multidimensional macrophage
model (42, 43), macrophages isolated from injured murine livers
express inflammatory (M1-like) and pro-restorative (M2-like)
markers simultaneously (52, 53) while can rapidly change their
phenotype depending on the local hepatic micro-environmental
milieu (54, 55).
Monocyte Recruitment Into the Liver
Following Acute Injury
A prominent feature of acute liver injury is the increased
numbers of hepatic macrophages (56–59). Following injury,
the macrophage pool of the liver is expanded due to the
infiltration of bone marrow derived CCR2+ Ly6Chigh monocytes
which develop into MoMFs (56–59). The CCR2/CCL2 axis
is crucial for their recruitment to the liver. Dambach et al.
first showed that CCL2 is highly secreted in the mouse
liver after APAP overdose while latter work, with several
liver injury models applied in CCR2−/− mice, confirmed the
importance of CCR2 for monocyte recruitment to the liver (58–
61). CCR5 has also been described as crucial for monocyte
recruitment in experimental APAP toxicity (62). Human data
show that serum and liver tissue CCL2 levels are increased in
acetaminophen-induced ALF (AALF) patients who also have
increased numbers of S100A8/9+ newly infiltrating monocytes
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2948

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
or MoMFs, in necrosis areas within their livers (63). Of
note, these patients show increased CCR2 expression in their
intermediate, but not classical/non-classical, monocytes (63).
The anti-inflammatory liver micro-environment (e.g., CCL2,
IL-10, and TGF-β) in human AALF implicates these cells in
pro-restorative responses (63). However, the severity of AALF
patients correlates inversely with blood monocyte numbers and
directly with serum CCL2 levels, suggesting that patients with
poorer outcomes recruited more monocytes to the liver (63).
In accordance, Mossanen et al. show that CCR2+ cells are
increased in the liver of AALF patients and express inflammatory
markers, such as S100A9, thus implicating them in propagation
of injury (53). Taken together, liver-recruited monocytes play
dual roles during liver injury; depending on the disease stage,
they can perpetuate inflammation but also promote resolution of
inflammation (64).
In situ Development of Liver
Monocyte-Derived Macrophages
Liver MoMFs form a developmentally, phenotypically and
functionally distinct subset of macrophages compared to liverresident KCs (65). Numerous human and mouse studies
suggest a potential immune-regulatory role for MoMFs during
liver injury. Liver MoMFs are CX3CR1+, derive from blood
Ly6Chigh monocytes while following their infiltration they
undergo a maturation process toward Ly6Clow MoMFs (52, 65)
(Figure 2A). These initially inflammatory CCR2high CX3CR1low
monocytes form ring-like structures around injured areas where
they differentiate in situ into CCR2low CX3CR1high cells,
that in turn guide resolution and tissue-repair (8, 29, 66).
This maturation process into pro-restorative macrophages is
suggested to be driven by the ingestion of cellular debris
and augmented by secreted growth factors and cytokines [e.g.,
macrophage colony-stimulating-factor-1 (CSF1), IL-4, and IL10] (52, 58, 66, 67). Both resident and infiltrating macrophage
populations proliferate in the liver and this expands their
numbers during inflammatory conditions (67). Following APAP
hepatotoxicity, there is a massive expansion of liver macrophages
at 12 h post APAP in mice, that is mainly due to recruitment
of MoMFs rather than proliferation of KCs (57, 59, 65).
Of note, mouse liver MoMFs are characterized by a gene
expression profile that is distinct to circulating Ly6Chigh
monocytes and liver-resident KCs (52, 65). In support of this,
increased numbers of newly-infiltrating (S100A8/9+CD68+)
macrophages are detected in the liver of AALF patients
(53, 63).
In addition to resident KCs, MoMFs apparently contribute
to the resolution and tissue-repair processes, as their depletion
at different stages of liver injury highlights their critical
immune-regulatory roles (68). In both mouse and human ALF,
liver-infiltrating MoMFs exhibit a largely anti-inflammatory
phenotype and transcriptional signature indicative of a prorestorative, wound-healing, and regenerative functions (63–66).
For instance, mature (CX3CR1high Ly6Clow) liver MoMFs highly
secrete mediators involved in extracellular matrix remodeling,
angiogenesis and hepatocyte regeneration (52, 53, 58). This
pro-restorative phenotype may be induced by local microenvironmental cues, including CSF1 and secretory leukocyte
protease inhibitor (SLPI), that are secreted in the liver of APAPmice and patients with AALF (64, 66, 67). In keeping with their
role in resolving inflammation, two recent studies described that
MoMFs regulate neutrophil survival and clearance in APAP liver
injury, that is apparently mediated through Mer-Tyrosine-Kinase
(MerTK) (66, 69). Recently, Kubes et al. described the infiltration
of macrophages from the peritoneal cavity to the liver. Using
the thermal and carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver
injury models, they identified a subset of GATA6-expressing
peritoneal macrophages as a third population responding to
injury (70). These GATA6+ peritoneal macrophages migrate
directly through the liver visceral endothelium, and not the
vasculature, and aid tissue healing and regeneration processes
(70). It remains unclear if this mechanism is restricted to subcapsular liver lesions in close proximity to the peritoneal cavity.
These findings may extend to other models of liver injury,
and this new paradigm of avascular macrophage recruitment
has opened new avenues for research and potential therapeutic
applications (70).
Kupffer Cell Depletion Following Acute
Injury
Mouse liver-resident KCs have an F4/80high CD11b+ expression
profile in contrast to MoMFs which are F4/80+ CD11bhigh cells
(57, 65, 67, 71) (Figure 2A). Owing to their non-monocytic
origin, KCs are CX3CR1neg while their expression of other
surface markers overlaps with other phagocytes (72, 73). Recent
lineage-tracing and transcriptional analyses revealed that KCs
express the prototypical markers C-type-lectin-domain-family4-member-F (Clec4F+) and T-cell-immunoglobulin-and-mucindomain-containing-4 (Tim4+) (51, 65, 73, 74) (Figure 2A). The
heterogeneity of human liver macrophages is less characterized.
There are currently no lineage-specific markers to clearly
distinguish human KCs from MoMFs (1, 75). CD68 and
CD14 are used as macrophage markers but are commonly
expressed by both subsets (1, 53, 76). Most human studies
have stained liver tissue of AALF and ACLF patients for CD68
and the pro-inflammatory marker S100A8/9 to discriminate
the circulation-derived S100A8/9+ MoMFs from resident KCs
(53, 63, 64, 66, 77).
Following liver damage in acute liver failure, the absolute
number of KCs decreases whereas the liver-recruited monocytes
and MoMFs significantly increase as described above (52, 53, 57,
59, 60, 65, 66). In murine models KC depletion occurs at 24–
48 h post APAP but full recovery takes place by 120 h, through
self-renewal (52, 60, 65). These findings concur with human
data showing increased proliferative activity (Ki67+CD68+)
of resident macrophages in AALF patients (63). Of note,
recent studies revealed that infiltrating bone marrow derived
monocytes can replace the KC population, if KCs are completely
ablated (54, 74, 78, 79). Following KC depletion in mice,
using clodronate-loaded liposomes (CLL), monocytes are able
to repopulate the KC and DC populations, giving rise to the
full liver myeloid cell heterogeneity within weeks. However,

these observations were made in models involving extensive
experimental KC depletion (79). In contrast, after KC depletion
in APAP injury, KC repopulation relies on self-renewal rather
than contribution from monocytes (65). Additional studies
have shown that the replacement of KCs by monocytes can
result in self-renewing macrophages with similar functional and
transcriptional profiles to yolk-sac derived KCs (54, 74). Thus,
MoMFs are plastic and are influenced by local signals received
within the hepatic microenvironment as they repopulate the KC
niche (54, 74).
Kupffer Cells Are Pivotal for Antimicrobial
Defense
The liver is essential for antimicrobial defense and macrophages
play a fundamental role in this (3). KCs are highly effective
phagocytes that not only recognize, ingest, and degrade cellular
debris but also clear foreign material and pathogens (1, 75, 80,
81). Regardless their origin, steady-state KCs are a homogeneous
macrophage population with a specific transcriptional program
defined by their unique liver niche (54). KCs are exclusively
located intravascularly, seeded along the hepatic sinusoidal
endothelial cells (HSECs), whereas monocytes and MoMFs
can be located extravascularly (58, 70). This optimal location
underscores their crucial role in ensuring liver homeostasis by
constantly clearing blood-borne pathogens, associated toxins
(e.g., LPS) and cellular debris (3). Accordingly, KCs are fully
equipped with high expression of Fc (e.g., CD64), scavenger (e.g.,
CD163), complement, or PRR (e.g., TLR4, TLR9) receptors so
they exert antimicrobial responses (1, 75, 82).
Following intravenous injection of E. coli bacteria in mice
more than 60% of them become trapped in the liver after
10 min, and this proportion can rise to more than 80% in
6 h. Also, intravascular administration of fluorescent-labeled
latex microbeads leads to rapid uptake by liver phagocytes
with minimal uptake by circulating immune cells or other
tissue compartments (e.g., spleen, lung) (67, 79). Mouse
experimental studies utilizing flow cytometry and intravital
confocal microscopy show that steady-state KCs are the
dominant phagocyte in the liver, characterized by enhanced
uptake of pH-sensitive E. coli bioparticles or GFP-expressing
E. coli, compared to liver MoMFs and neutrophils (67, 79).
However, phagocyte depletion by using CLL in mice revealed
that newly-arrived, immature KCs have a reduced phagocytic
uptake of E. coli for at least 1 month after CCL administration,
suggesting a window of hepatic phagocytic dysfunction during
the KC maturation process in the liver (79).
KCs can also cooperate with platelets and other nonparenchymal cells (e.g., HSECs or neutrophils) in order to
promote pathogen clearance. For example, aggregation of
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2948

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
patrolling platelets with KCs facilitates bacterial recognition
and clearance during B. cereus and S. aureus systemic
infections in mice, thus conferring protection against sepsis
(83). However, recognition and scavenging of bacteria by
KCs does not necessarily translate into bacterial clearance.
Another recent study has highlighted that KCs can serve
as a potential reservoir for S. aureus, showing that a small
proportion of S. aureus overcomes the antimicrobial defense
of KCs and replicates within their phagolysosomes, thereby
efficiently evading from recruited neutrophils (84). Over time,
KCs lyse and release bacteria into the circulation, enabling
dissemination to other organs (84). Similarly, KCs were
not able to eliminate intracellular bacteria L. monocytogenes
infection in mice (16). Instead, L. monocytogenes induced
KC death by necroptosis which triggered the release of
hepatocyte-derived danger signals, such as IL-33, and led
to monocyte recruitment to the liver; MoMFs ultimately
eliminate bacteria and restore homeostasis (16). Work by
Sierro et al. recently described an additional liver-resident
macrophage population, occupying the hepatic capsule, that
is pivotal for the liver antimicrobial defense (73). These liver
capsular macrophages (LCMs) are replenished from circulating
monocytes at the steady state unlike the embryonically derived
KCs. LCMs play a key role in immune surveillance, by
sensing peritoneal pathogens and promoting the recruitment of
neutrophils toward the capsule to control intrahepatic bacterial
dissemination (73).
The depletion of KCs during acute liver injury is likely to
have functional and clinical significance in ALF and ACLF.
Given that KCs, as the dominant intravascular phagocyte, are
responsible for removing live bacterial and microbial products
from the circulation and exerting a tolerogenic effect in steady
state, their depletion may permit enhanced systemic exposure to
DAMPs and persisting bacteraemia. This is an area where further
research is required, to define the mechanism of KC depletion
and functional significance of the resulting phagocytic defect.
Liver Macrophages: Drivers of Injury or
Promoters of Repair?
The role of liver macrophages in acute liver injury has been
controversial. The experimental model of APAP injury in mice
is the best explored example, with detailed characterization
of macrophage subsets. Initially, KC activation was thought
to exacerbate APAP hepatotoxicity in mice (85). However, it
is now well-established that KCs are largely depleted after
APAP overdose and MoMFs represent the largest macrophage
population in the liver (52, 53, 57, 59, 65, 66). The first
experiments using gadolinium chloride, a potent KC inactivator,
noted protective effects against APAP toxicity, however latter
work applying KC depletion prior to APAP demonstrated a
beneficial role of KCs (85, 86). Others, by using CLL to
deplete most tissue macrophages, showed that macrophage
inhibition had a detrimental effect on liver injury (59, 87). Also,
mice deficient for NADPH oxidase, an enzyme required for
KC oxidative burst, were not protected against APAP injury
suggesting that KC-derived oxidant stress is not involved in the
injurious APAP process (88).
The role of liver-infiltrating monocytes and their macrophage
descendants in acute liver injury has been an area of intense
research the last years. Initial studies applying APAP-induced
liver injury in CCR2-deficient (CCR2−/−) and anti-CCR2 treated
mice found increased liver inflammation and delayed tissue
regeneration, suggesting that monocytes are crucial for recovery
from APAP injury (57, 60). Lack of recruitment of CCR2high
CX3CR1low monocytes also results in persistent accumulation
of necrotic cells up to 48 h post injury, indicating them crucial
for tissue-repair processes (58). Others by using the CCl4-
induced acute liver injury model found that blood monocyte
depletion with CCL resulted in comparable ALT levels at 24 h
after CCl4 administration, proposing that recruited monocytes
do not contribute to the early stages of injury (59). This
group further demonstrated that CCR2−/− mice exhibited
comparable liver injury at 24 and 48 h following CCl4 injection,
although liver monocyte numbers were decreased (59). In
contrast, others support the idea that monocytes and MoMFs
exacerbate liver inflammation. Studies using single-dose CCl4
models of acute liver injury and MCP1-deficient (MCP1−/−)
or CCR2−/− animals suggested that CCL2-recruited CCR2+
monocytes contribute to induction of early injury, showing
reduced liver injury at 24 h but comparable levels at 48 h (61,
89). In line with this, two recent studies showed that CCR2+
monocytes infiltrate sites of liver injury as early as 8–12 h
following insult (53, 58). Using the APAP experimental model,
Mossanen et al. found that CCR2−/− mice had reduced ALT
levels and necrosis at 12 h after injury (53). Pharmacological
inhibition of monocyte infiltration using a CCR2 antagonist early
after APAP dose resulted in reduced ALT levels and necrosis
at 12 h following injury, but equivalent injury at 24 and 48 h,
supporting the data from the CCl4 model (53). Furthermore,
this study revealed that the newly-infiltrated (Ly6Chigh) MoMFs
exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype, as reflected by their
cytokine expression (e.g., TNF-α or IL-1β) profile (53). These
results suggest that liver monocytes and MoMFs can produce
both pro-inflammatory and repair-associated cytokines, however
their function clearly depends on the phase (propagation vs.
resolution) of liver injury (53, 90). It is important to note the
contradictory evidence on the roles of macrophages in ALF.
This may be explained by their functional plasticity during
the phases (initiation, propagation, and resolution) of liver
inflammation (1, 55, 75, 91). These inconsistencies can also
be attributed to the hard distinction of macrophage subsets,
especially under inflammatory stress, and the different sensitivity
of macrophages to the various experimental depletion techniques
applied.
MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES AND
THE SYSTEMIC IMMUNOPATHOLOGY OF
LIVER FAILURE SYNDROMES
Systemic Inflammation
Development of SIRS and CARS in Liver Failure
The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is the
constellation of clinical signs, suggestive of immune activation
and the presence of inflammation. It is defined by the presence
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2948

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
of any two or more of: fever or hypothermia, tachycardia,
tachyopnoea, and white cell response, either leukocytosis,
leucopaenia or >10% immature neutrophils (92). SIRS is
no longer included in the most recent “Sepsis-3” definition
of sepsis, as it was proved to have poor sensitivity and
specificity for the identification of patients with infection
(93). The lack of specificity is in part because patients with
conditions of sterile inflammation like ALF, in which there
is a robust innate immune response and high circulating
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, can exhibit positive SIRS
criteria without infection (12). SIRS remains a useful clinical
definition for studies investigating immune activation, albeit
offering poor discrimination between sterile and sepsis-driven
inflammation.
SIRS in ALF is driven by pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion
of liver immune cells and is closely associated with the
development of extra-hepatic organ dysfunction and adverse
outcomes (44). In parallel to the pro-inflammatory response
to acute tissue injury, a compensatory anti-inflammatory
response syndrome (CARS) develops, as anti-inflammatory
cytokines and mediators are concomitantly released from liver
macrophages during the initial stages of liver injury (41, 42,
45). CARS is a counter-regulatory, homeostatic mechanism
aimed at preventing overwhelming inflammation. Excessive
SIRS activation is also hallmark of ACLF. Inflammatory
responses in ACLF are imbalanced, ranging from an initial
SIRS to subsequent development of a long-lasting CARS (16,
50, 54, 58, 59). ACLF patients are also characterized by
high circulating levels of both pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines (22, 50, 63). SIRS and CARS are
believed to exert modulatory effects on immune cell effector
function in ALF/ACLF, such as monocytes and macrophages,
thus contributing to immune dysregulation and defective
immune responses to microbial cues (16, 22), as discussed
below.
Systemic Immuneparesis
Systemic Immunosuppression in ALF
ALF is a multisystem disorder and immune dysfunction is
central to the pathogenesis. Here, the massive hepatic infiltration
by myeloid cells is contrasted by immune cell depletion and
dysregulation in the systemic circulation (63, 64). From a clinical
perspective, it is widely accepted that although the precipitating
event of ALF is overwhelming hepatocyte death, mortality
occurs due to the profound activation of SIRS and its attendant
complications of multi-organ failure, immune dysfunction and
recurrent sepsis (12, 94–96). SIRS is driven by pro-inflammatory
(e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) cytokine secretion from liver immune
cells and is closely associated with the development of extrahepatic organ dysfunction and adverse outcome in ALF (96).
In parallel to the pro-inflammatory response to liver injury,
CARS develops as anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators (e.g.,
IL-10, SLPI) are concomitantly released from liver macrophages
during the initial stages of liver injury (64, 94, 97). Elevated
levels of circulating anti-inflammatory cytokines detected in
early stages of ALF, such as IL-10, predict poor patient
outcome (64, 94, 97). ALF shares striking similarities with
systemic sepsis and septic shock with regards to the features
of systemic inflammation, multi-organ failure and peripheral
immunosuppression, thus may share pathological mechanisms
(94, 98). Immunosuppression is considered the predominant
driving force for mortality in those patients while accumulating
evidence shows that sepsis causes major defects in innate and
adaptive immunity, leading to compromised host antimicrobial
defense (99, 100). “Septic” monocytes show reduced HLA-DR
expression and diminished ability to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12) in response to TLR
agonists, findings consistent with endotoxin tolerance (99,
100). In contrast, anti-inflammatory mediator (e.g., IL-10)
secretion is unaltered or even augmented (99, 100), and
these characteristics may account for the increased patient
susceptibility to infections in sepsis (101). Of note, sepsis
is one of the most important causes of mortality in ALF
patients (12).
In line with these notions, we have provided evidence of
peripheral immunosuppression in patients with ALF, also
termed “immuneparesis,” showing major functional defects in
both innate and adaptive arms of immunity (64, 77, 102, 103).
A hallmark of ALF is that monocytes are functionally impaired
and hyporesponsive to microbial challenge (64, 77, 102).
Detailed phenotypic characterization of circulating monocytes
ex vivo in ALF patients revealed an immunosuppressive
phenotype, typified by reduced HLA-DR expression but
increased CD163, Tie-2, and MerTK expression (64, 66, 77)
(Figure 3). Additionally, ALF monocytes show increased
expression of tissue (CCR2, CCR5) and lymph-node (CCR7)
homing receptors (64, 66, 77). Functional analyses show that
ALF monocytes produce less pro-inflammatory (e.g., IFN-γ,
TNF-a, IL-6) cytokines after microbial challenge, through NF-kB
pathway inhibition, but have enhanced anti-inflammatory
(e.g., SLPI) mediator secretion (64, 66, 77, 104) (Figure 3).
Furthermore, monocytes in ALF patients have impaired E. coli
bacteria uptake and enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells
(64, 66, 77, 104).
In support of these findings, we showed that MerTK
expression by monocytes/macrophages indicates pro-restorative
yet immunosuppressive functions in liver failure syndromes
(66, 77). MerTK, a tyrosine-kinase receptor mainly expressed
by monocytes/macrophages, is a negative regulator of proinflammatory TLR signaling pathway (43). We have shown that
MerTK+ monocytes in ALF secrete reduced pro-inflammatory
cytokines after microbial challenge (66, 77). Furthermore,
transcriptional analyses of MerTK+ monocytes in ALF revealed
marked reductions in a number of immune-regulatory pathways,
including antigen-processing (e.g., HLA-DRA), TLR and NF-κB
signaling (e.g., NFKBIA, NFKBIZ, TLR4), phagocytosis/PRR
receptors (e.g., FCGR2A/C, FCGR3A/B), and cytokines (e.g.,
TNF) (66). These cells have an M2-like skewed profile (e.g.,
CD163), active MerTK/cytokine down-stream signaling (e.g.,
IRF3, JAK3) with concomitant down-regulation in cell activation
related genes (e.g., NLRP3) (66) (Figure 3). These transcriptomic
profile of monocytes is consistent with the impaired monocyte
antimicrobial responses (cytokines, phagocytosis) described
ex vivo in ALF (64, 66, 77, 104). In addition, MerTK+

FIGURE 3 | Characteristics of human pro-restorative monocytes and macrophages in acute liver failure syndromes. The schematic summarizes the phenotypic and
functional characteristics of (Left) steady-state inflammatory and (Right) pro-restorative monocytes and macrophages described in acute liver failure syndromes,

monocytes possess enhanced trans-endothelial migratory
characteristics which enable them to accumulate in diverse sites
of inflammation, so they are found in the liver, lymph nodes, and
circulation of patients with ALF (66, 77).
The systemic and hepatic micro-environmental milieu is
a critical determinant of monocyte and liver macrophage
function during ALF. For instance, in vitro incubation of
healthy monocytes in the presence of ALF patient derived
plasma or liver homogenates induces similar to ex vivo
monocyte characteristics, described above (55, 64, 66). This
work suggests that anti-inflammatory/regenerative mediators
(e.g., IL-10, SLPI) that are produced in the inflamed liver, and
which serve to dampen pro-inflammatory responses and limit
the extent of injury, are of sufficient magnitude to spill-over
into the systemic circulation where they reprogram circulating
monocytes into an immunosuppressive state (55, 64). This
functional impairment renders monocytes less able to respond
to secondary infectious stimuli, hence compromises host antimicrobial defense mechanisms and may account for the increased
susceptibility to infections and poor outcomes from sepsis
encountered in ALF patients (63, 64, 102, 105). It is therefore
of great importance to understand in more detail the underlying
mechanisms of monocyte suppression in ALF, so that novel
immune-based therapies can be developed (55, 106).
Systemic Immunosuppression in ACLF
Immune dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of ACLF
and is postulated to account for its infectious complications
and their negative impact on patient survival (28, 77, 107).
Immune dysfunction in ACLF is multifactorial. From a
pathophysiological perspective, ACLF is a dynamic, multisystem
process that involves several defects/abnormalities in cellular
and soluble components of the immune system (108, 109). These
defects eventually lead to a state of acquired immunodeficiency
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2948

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
(108, 109), impairing the host’s antimicrobial responses and thus
conferring an increased susceptibility to infections (110, 111).
Cellular components involve functionally reprogrammed
innate and adaptive immune cells; soluble components
include albumin, cytokines, coagulation factors, and the
complement system (77, 104, 108, 109). Limitations in the
available rodent models of ACLF mean most results are
obtained from clinical studies in liver failure patients (10).
ACLF’s complexity is highlighted by various impairments in
different tissue compartments; circulation, gut, peritoneum,
liver, and the reticuloendothelial (RES) system, as reviewed
with more details elsewhere (108, 109). For instance, increased
bacterial translocation of gut-derived organisms to the portal
and lymphatic circulations is observed in CLD and ACLF
patients, as a consequence of diverse changes; e.g., altered gut
microbiota composition and increased intestinal permeability
(112). This phenomenon is of pathological significance in
ACLF, given that gut-derived PAMPs can perpetually stimulate
the immune system (112). Furthermore, pathogen clearance
mediated by the RES is reduced proportionally to liver
dysfunction severity while reduced hepatic synthesis of innate
antimicrobial proteins, such as albumin and complement, thus
contributing to decreased bactericidal capacity of phagocytic
cells (108, 109).
Inflammatory responses in ACLF are also imbalanced, ranging
from initial SIRS activation to subsequent CARS development
(77, 104, 107–109). ACLF patients are characterized by
upregulated circulating levels of both pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines (11, 28, 77). SIRS and CARS are believed
to exert crucial modulatory effects on immune cell effector
function in ACLF, such as monocytes/macrophages, resulting in
defective immune responses to microbial cues (28, 107). This
may explain the dynamic immunosuppressive state differences
between patients with stable cirrhosis, acute decompensation
and ACLF (77, 104, 108, 109). Work from our group has welldescribed the monocyte and macrophage dysfunction in ACLF
patients (77, 104, 111, 113). The main defects include reduced
pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to microbial challenge and
impaired antigen-presentation capabilities due to reduced HLADR expression (77, 111, 113, 114). These attenuated innate
responses are considered a state of refractoriness due to recurrent
PAMP exposure and physiological adaptation to counter-regulate
inflammatory responses, however this favors development of
secondary infections and is associated with increased mortality
(77, 108).
In a clinical study led by O’Brien et al. the immunosuppressive
lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that inhibits TLR4
protein expression, was detected at increased levels in plasma
derived from patients with ACLF (115). PGE2 was shown
to inhibit macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines in
response to LPS and decrease macrophage bacterial killing
(115). We have revealed another mechanism explaining
immuneparesis in ACLF, that involves the activation of
MerTK on monocytes/macrophages in the circulation and
tissue sites of inflammation in these patients (77). MerTK
overexpression conferred a decreased ex vivo response to LPS
and closely correlated to levels of immunosuppression, SIRS
activation, and disease severity scores in ACLF (77). This
study proposed MerTK antagonism as a therapeutic strategy
to restore innate responses at later stages of ACLF where
prolonged CARS predisposes to infectious complications (77).
In the same context, we recently demonstrated an expansion
of mononuclear CD14+HLA-DR− myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (M-MDSCs) in the systemic circulation of ACLF patients
(104). M-MDSCs in ACLF are highly immunosuppressive: they
decrease T cell proliferation, produce less TNF-α following TLR
stimulation and have a reduced E. coli bacteria phagocytosis
(104). M-MDSCs are of great pathological significance in
ACLF; given they impair both innate and adaptive responses
to microbial agents, they can contribute to the increased
frequency of infections encountered in these patients (104).
Interestingly, patients with ACLF have a very high shortterm occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections (9, 10).
Together, these findings suggest that monocyte/macrophage
immunosuppression in ACLF develops in parallel to SIRS
and this could explain the high risk of nosocomial infections
encountered in ACLF patients (77, 108). It is also hypothesized
that this immunosuppression might be a regulatory mechanism
to limit the monocyte and macrophage responses to elevated
amounts of various stimuli (PAMPs, DAMPs, soluble proteins,
cytokines and chemokines) (104, 116, 117). However, there
is currently no evidence to support this, and future studies
are needed to investigate whether the development of
systemic inflammation and immunosuppression are related in
ACLF (10).
IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO
TREAT LIVER FAILURE
Targeting Liver Macrophages:
Opportunities and Challenges
Liver macrophages are central to the pathogenesis of ALF
and ACLF driving the initiation, propagation, and resolution
of injury and related inflammation. Therefore, they are an
attractive target for developing new therapeutic approaches
to treat such conditions. First, central pathways regulating
their recruitment (chemokines), responses to injurious, or
infectious insults (e.g., PRRs, DAMPs, PAMPs, inflammasome
activation) and differentiation (effector cytokines, polarization
markers) are well-conserved between mice and humans,
thus allowing translation from animal experimental models
to human diseases (2). Second, a number of drugs with
good safety profile approved for liver disease patients (e.g.,
albumin, glucocorticoids, N-acetylcysteine), including those with
ALF/ACLF, are shown to exert great immune-modulatory effects
on macrophages (108, 118). Third, the high scavenging capacity
of liver macrophages allows their preferential targeting using
drug carrier materials (hard-shell microbubbles, liposomes,
and polymers) (119). Finally, macrophage-related biomarkers
may allow patient selection with favored positive responses
(55, 75); increased circulating levels of soluble forms of
scavenger receptor CD163 (sCD163) and mannose receptor
(sMR) detected in ALF/ACLF patients are proposed as surrogate

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
markers of macrophage activation and predict mortality
(120, 121).
However, the development and application of macrophagedirected therapies to treat liver diseases may face some challenges
(2). First, animal models may exhibit quite opposing functions
of macrophage subsets depending on the various applied
experimental conditions (55, 75). Thus, for any interventions
the optimal dosing, timing, subset-specific targeting in relation
to the disease stage must be considered. Second, animal
models are not fully representative of the mechanistic spectrum
of human diseases but reflect only certain aspects of their
pathogenesis. For instance, they develop much more rapidly than
human diseases which may affect the macrophage adaptations
in response to injury. Mice also bear few immunological
differences; for example, the murine liver is largely enriched
in NKT cells (122). Furthermore, there is greater heterogeneity
in patients compared to inbred mouse strains with respect to
intrinsic (genetics, sex, age) or extrinsic (microbiota, infections,
medications) factors that might influence macrophages. Third,
macrophage heterogeneity and their context-specific functions
are currently better understood in the mouse rather than the
human liver (1). Currently, there is limited access to liver tissue
at the various stages of diseases, while technical difficulties
in isolating different macrophage populations hamper the
detailed characterization of liver macrophage subsets in humans.
Despite these challenges, our detailed understanding of the
pathways involved in initial liver injury recognition by resident
KCs, amplification of responses by monocyte recruitment
to the liver and their context-specific differentiation into
diverse liver macrophage subsets have offered exciting platforms
for developing novel macrophage-directed immunotherapeutic
strategies.
Inhibition of Kupffer Cell Activation
At the early phases of ALF and ACLF, immune therapies could
be targeted at restricting the profound innate immune activation.
The initial recognition of liver injury, that is mainly mediated by
resident KCs, triggers inflammatory cascades whose activation
can be modulated by several approaches (Figure 2B). For
instance, the early communication of cellular distress or death
from hepatocytes with KCs is through DAMP/PAMP interactions
with PRRs and NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome
activation, so these can be clear targets for immunotherapy.
Inhibition of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 have been shown to
ameliorate liver injury in murine models of APAP hepatotoxicity
(19, 123, 124). Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of the purinergic
receptor P2X7, which acts upstream of the inflammasome and
is activated by ATP, has revealed protective effects against
APAP injury (38). Another strategy would be to target
released DAMPs such as HMGB-1 and histones. Interestingly,
HMGB-1 neutralizing antibodies are shown to ameliorate liver
injury and reduce bacterial translocation in murine models of
paracetamol-induced ALF (21, 32). Further evidence from a
rat model of ACLF suggests that blocking HMGB-1 reduces
hepatic apoptosis, hepatic inflammatory response and SIRS,
thus alleviating inflammation and SIRS in ACLF (125). Hence,
pharmacological HMGB-1 blockade in the early stage of human
ALF (initiation phase) or ACLF (AD phase) might prevent organ
failure so translation of HMGB-1 inhibitors to clinical trials is a
potential therapeutic approach (108). Another DAMP, histones,
initiate inflammation via TLR2/TLR4 and activation of the
inflammasome; animal and human studies showed that targeted
anti-histone treatments reduce monocyte pro-inflammatory
cytokine production and reduce severity of ALF (36). In the
same context, novel drugs targeting inflammasome activation
may dampen hepatic pro-inflammatory processes (126).
Increased bacterial translocation, a major contributor to
immune dysfunction in ACLF (112), is paralleled by increased
gut-derived PAMPs that perpetually stimulate the hepatic innate
immune system, magnifying further liver injury (108). Therefore,
influencing the gut barrier or the gut microbiome using
probiotics or antibiotics could potentially alleviate the pathogenic
KC activation (127). Antibiotic agents are widely used drugs
for treatment of the infectious complications in ACLF patients
(108) while an ongoing study from our group is evaluating
the non-absorptive antibiotic Rifaximin that may beneficially
influence the gut microbiota to decrease pathologic bacterial
translocation. Such therapeutic strategies aimed to limit initial
innate immune activation would be most effective if administered
very early in disease onset, while levels of DAMPs/PAMPs are
high and prior to the propagation phase of liver injury (55).
However, this is challenging from a clinical perspective, as the
time window for these therapies to be effective is likely to be
short. Furthermore, a degree of immune activation is required
for resolution of injury, as this initial step leads to recruitment of
monocytes and expansion of macrophages at sites of injury, that
is associated with effective efferocytosis, pro-restorative functions
and facilitation of tissue regeneration (55).
Inhibition of Monocyte Recruitment to the
Liver
Inflammatory monocytes amplify and perpetuate inflammation
in liver diseases. Their recruitment to the liver is driven by
chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in animal models
and patients, with the CCL2–CCR2 and CCL5/CCR5 as the
most prominent pathways in ALF and ACLF (53, 57–59, 77).
Many available pharmacological strategies can interfere with
this signaling including inhibition of chemokines with small
molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies against chemokines
or receptors and receptor antagonists preventing chemokine
binding (128) (Figure 2B). For example, the CCR2/CCR5
inhibitor cenicriviroc (CVC) has been recently tested in a
randomized, double-blind, phase 2b study including a large
cohort of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
and liver fibrosis (129). CVC was previously found to block
monocyte recruitment to the liver and exert anti-fibrotic
effects in experimental models of liver and kidney fibrosis
(130). This trial revealed that after 1 year CVC treatment,
twice as many subjects achieved improvement in fibrosis and
no worsening of steatohepatitis, compared with the placebo
(129). CVC might also bear therapeutic potential in ALF
or ACLF; Mossanen et al. recently showed that the early
pharmacological inhibition of either chemokine CCL2 (by
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2948

Triantafyllou et al. Monocytes/Macrophages in Acute Liver Failure
the inhibitor, mNOX-E36) or CCR2 (by the CCR2/CCR5
inhibitor, CVC) reduced monocyte infiltration and indices of
liver injury in murine APAP-induced ALF (53). Importantly,
neither the early nor the continuous inhibition of CCR2
hindered repair processes during resolution from injury. Various
other CCR2, CCL2, or CCR2/CCR5 inhibitors are currently
developed and tested in other inflammatory/metabolic diseases
(e.g., type 2 diabetes), clinical trials are needed though to
define their efficacy in liver diseases (128). One important
finding from the NASH trial was the excellent safety profile
of CVC, supporting that inhibiting inflammatory monocytes
might not affect essential macrophage immune responses
and antimicrobial defense, in a chronic liver disease at
least (129).
Promotion of Macrophage Polarization and
Differentiation
Macrophages exert key functions in liver injury and therefore
there is a theoretical concern that targeting them or inhibiting
their recruitment could prove counterproductive. Rather, a
therapeutic approach utilizing key mediators to promote
an early switch in macrophage function to favor a prorestorative phenotype and thereby accelerate resolution of
injury and hepatocyte regeneration should be considered (55)
(Figure 2B). Steroids are well-known to promote macrophage
anti-inflammatory/resolution responses and therefore their
administration might be beneficial in the early phases of liver
failure (118). A retrospective analysis of ALF patients did not
show an overall survival benefit while transplant-free survival
was slightly higher in the steroid-treated group. However, the
overall numbers of treated patients in this study were low
and steroids were administrated before the onset of ALF in
half of the cohort (131). Thus, steroid efficacy in ALF, and
their use in ACLF patients (108), is still under debate. As the
timing of their administration appears crucial, a prospective
trial is suggested to evaluate the steroid effects in the early
pro-inflammatory phase of ACLF, so as to limit the initial
hepatic inflammation and subsequent SIRS. Steroid usage in
the later phases of ACLF, where anti-inflammation prevails, is
likely to be detrimental as it may increase predisposition to
infection (108).
In contrast to chemokine strategies that reduce
monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the liver, there are
alternative therapeutic strategies that intentionally cause the
opposite, namely augment the macrophage numbers and
functions (75) (Figure 2B). Immune dysfunction is common
in liver failure syndromes, rendering the patients susceptible
to infectious complications. Thus, the effects of hematopoietic
growth factors so as to restore immune functions are currently
being investigated (132). For instance, granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), produced by macrophages and
other immune cells, is shown to reduce disease severity scores,
septic episodes and increase survival in a study using G-CSF
supplementary for 28 days in the treatment of patients with
ACLF (133). This effect may be mediated through mobilization
of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells into the liver (133).
Furthermore, G-CSF has been shown to improve impaired
phagocytosis and bacterial killing by neutrophils in vitro and
in vivo in patients with ALF (134, 135). However, its effects
on macrophages are not described. In a similar fashion, the
role and therapeutic potential of CSF1 was recently examined
in ALF (67). In patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF,
low serum CSF1 levels correlated with increased mortality.
Exogenous administration of CSF1, in the form of a crystallisable
fragment (Fc), promoted hepatic macrophage accumulation
in mice (67). CSF1-Fc increased the proliferation of liverresident KCs and the recruitment of monocytes, promoting
their differentiation, which was associated with indicators of
increased innate immunity in mice after partial hepatectomy
or APAP-induced injury with resident KCs as the main
effector cells (67). Thus, patients with impaired macrophage
functions such as ALF and ACLF, might benefit from such
approach.
Finally, the high scavenging capacity of liver macrophages,
especially that of resident KCs, allows their preferential targeting
using drug carrier materials such as hard-shell microbubbles,
liposomes, and polymers (119). Upon systemic administration
in mice, 15–50% of these three prototypic drug delivery systems
can be found in the liver, and KCs are the main cellular target
for such carriers (119). If particles are functionally endowed
with the sugar moiety mannose, the targeting specificity for
KCs that carry the mannose scavenging receptor (CD206) can
be significantly increased (119). In a proof-of-concept study
involving systemic S. aureus infection in mice, the liposomal
administration of the antibiotic vancomycin efficiently targeted
KCs and aided the elimination of a reservoir of S. aureus
residing within KCs (84). Similarly, the macrophage-targeted
delivery of dexamethasone has been shown to reduce fibrosis in
mice (136). Taken together, such immunotherapeutic strategies
ideally would be able to target liver macrophages without
causing a concomitant immunosuppressive effect on circulating
monocytes and should allow monocyte-derived macrophage
recruitment to sites of tissue inflammation or infection (55).
Future studies in mice and humans will provide a better
understanding of monocyte and macrophage plasticity in the
liver and will hopefully lead to the development of novel
therapeutic targets for use in ALF, ACLF, and other inflammatory
conditions.
The apparently contradictory aims of some of the described
macrophage-targeted approaches highlights the challenges
in developing immunotherapeutic strategies for ALF and
ACLF. There is an inherent tension between the local hepatic
environment, in which promotion of anti-inflammatory
programmes is desirable to resolve inflammation and restore
tissue integrity, and the systemic immune environment in
which enhanced anti-microbial immunity is required. Cellular
and humoral components of the response to liver injury, such
as MerTK± macrophages and SLPI, which are important in
local tissue repair have also been shown to be key drivers of
systemic immunosuppression (64, 66, 77, 106). While current
experimental tools and models are unable to resolve this
paradox, it is hoped that with greater understanding of the
inflammation-resolution pathways and the mechanisms of

peripheral immuneparesis, macrophage and monocyte targeted
approaches could be developed.
CONCLUSION
The last two decades have seen a great progression in our
understanding of acute liver failure syndromes as inflammatory,
immune-mediated conditions. The recognition of ACLF as a
condition distinct from decompensated chronic liver disease has
enhanced interest, research and understanding. In both ALF
and ACLF, monocytes and macrophages play a key role in
disease pathogenesis; driving local inflammation, tissue repair,
and systemic complications. As research reveals greater levels
of complexity and diversity of myeloid cell function in acute
liver failure syndromes, both the challenges and opportunities
of developing targeted immunotherapy are brought into
focus.
