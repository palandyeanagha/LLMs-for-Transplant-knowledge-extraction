Abstract Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with 5-year survival rates <15%. Selected patients present
with localized but unresectable disease and are candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The purpose of
this study was to evaluate a multi-institutional experience with liver transplantation for this malignancy. Two hundred
eighty patients with cholangiocarcinoma treated with OLT from 1987 to 2005 were identified in The United Network
for Organ Sharing database. Patient and allograft survivals were calculated and the potential prognostic value of
multiple clinicopathologic variables was assessed. At a median follow-up interval of 452 days (range: 0–6,166 days),
1- and 5-year patient survivals were 74 and 38%, respectively, with 49 actual 5-year survivors and 21 actual 10-year
survivors. Posttransplant 1- and 5-year allograft survivals were 69 and 36%, respectively. Study variables associated
with improved survivals included diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma pre-OLT [5-year overall survival (OS): 68 vs. 20%
for patients with incidental diagnoses at the time of OLT, p<0.001] and OLT after 1993 (5-year OS: 45 vs. 30% pre1994, p<0.01). In contrast, the diagnosis of concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis did not impact survivals (5-year
OS: 41 vs. 50% without primary sclerosing cholangitis, p=0.402). Selected cholangiocarcinoma patients treated with
OLT experience a survival benefit. Diagnosis of cancer prior to OLT allows for better staging and pre-OLT therapy that may
translate into improved outcomes. These data support the continued development of multimodality cholangiocarcinoma
treatment protocols that include OLT.

Introduction
Cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon, but aggressive,
malignancy of the biliary tract. Unlike many other cancers,
its incidence in the USA and worldwide is increasing.
Between 1973 and 1997, the incidence increased by almost
10%, as did the mortality rate from the disease.1,2 Although
no specific etiologic factor can be found in most patients,
there is an association between long-standing biliary
inflammation [as in the case of primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC)] and development of cholangiocarcinoma.3 In the population of patients with PSC, the
prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma ranges from 5 to 15%.4
Results of nonsurgical therapies for cholangiocarcinoma
have been disappointing, with the majority of patients
surviving less than 1 year after diagnosis.5 In cases where
complete resection is possible, 5-year patient survivals
between 27 and 48% have been reported.2 However, due to
patient age, tumor location, distant disease, and/or underlying liver disease, candidacy for complete resection is
more often the exception than the rule.2 In selected cases of
cholangiocarcinoma that are early-stage, but anatomically
not resectable, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has
been investigated as a treatment modality.6–8

Early experience with OLT in cholangiocarcinoma was
disappointing, with reported 5-year survivals ranging from
18 to 25%.9–11 However, more recent single-center reports
indicate that 5-year patient survivals of over 80% can be
achieved when liver transplantation is combined with
neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy in patients with
early-stage disease (stage I/II).12,13 Given these recent
favorable results, the aim of this study was to examine
overall trends in outcomes following OLT for cholangiocarcinoma using the multi-institutional United Network for
Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network (UNOS/OPTN) patient database.
Materials and Methods
The UNOS/OPTN database encompassing 71,224 liver
transplants from 1987 to 2005 was used for data collection.
Analysis of this data set identified 280 patients who had a
diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma at listing (n=102) or at
discharge (n=245) (67 patients were included in both
groups). To determine allograft survival rates, data were
collected on first OLTs (n=280) and subsequent retransplants (n=22) received by these patients, yielding a total of
302 analyzed transplants in 280 study patients.
Of the 280 patients analyzed, 101 patients (36%) were
transplanted prior to 1994, before a standard system for
listing pretransplant and posttransplant oncologic diagnoses
was routinely utilized in the database. For these 101
patients, there was an overall treatment diagnosis listed as
“cholangiocarcinoma,” but knowledge of the presence of
cholangiocarcinoma prior to transplant vs. incidentally
found cholangiocarcinoma could not be confirmed. The
remaining 179 patients (64%), transplanted after 1993, had
clearly defined listing diagnoses in the UNOS database and,
therefore, the analyses concerning indication for transplant
were limited to these patients.
Examined study variables included recipient age, race,
gender, indication for transplant, pretransplant clinical status,
ABO blood group, allograft type, date of transplant, patient
and allograft survivals, and cause of allograft failure or death
(cancer-related vs. other cause). Kaplan–Meier curves were
used to calculate survivals and log-rank tests were used to
determine the influence of study variables on outcomes. A p
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographics
Of the 280 patients who underwent liver transplantation for
cholangiocarcinoma between April 1987 and December
2005, 64.3% were male. The most common race was
Caucasian (86.8%), followed by African-American (4.6%)
and Asian (2.2%). The median age of recipients was 48
years (range: 18–73 years). The recipient ABO blood group
distribution was as follows: O, 128 patients; A, 107
patients; B, 37 patients; and AB, 8 patients.
Preoperative Status/Allograft Type
The median waitlist time for first-transplant recipients was
58 days (range: 0–3,147 days). One hundred and seventyseven patients were transplanted before the model for endstage liver disease (MELD) score was utilized for waitlist
ranking. For the remaining 103 patients, the median lab
MELD score was 14 (range: 6–47). At transplant, 35
patients (12.5%) were listed as status 1. One-hundred and
four patients (37%) were hospitalized immediately prior
to transplant. Of these patients, 37 were in the intensive
care unit and 14 patients were requiring ventilator support.
At time of transplant, the median serum creatinine was
0.9 mg/dL (range: 0.1–13 mg/dL), the median serum total
bilirubin was 2.6 mg/dL (range: 0.2–53.7 mg/dL), and the
median serum alanine aminotransferase was 70.5 U/L
(range: 2–7,891 U/L). Two-hundred fifty-four recipients
(91%) received whole cadaveric allografts, 21 patients (7%)
received allografts from living donors, and 5 patients (2%)
received reduced or split cadaveric allografts.
Indication for OLT
One hundred and two of the 179 patients (57%) with
complete pretransplant oncologic diagnosis data had a preOLT listing diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. For 38 of
these 102 patients with known cholangiocarcinoma, PSC
was listed as a concomitant pre-OLT diagnosis. The
remaining 64 patients with known pre-OLT cholangiocarcinoma were not reported to have PSC. Seventy-seven
patients (43%) transplanted after 1993 had an incidental
diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma at the time of transplantation. The indications for OLT in these patients included
PSC with liver failure in 31 (40%), other malignancy in
8 (11%), and nonmalignant, non-PSC-related liver failure in
38 (49%).
Patient Survivals
Twelve patients died within 30 days of primary transplant, yielding a 30-day mortality rate of 4.0%. At a
median patient follow-up interval of 452 days (range: 0–
6,166 days), 1- and 5-year patient survivals for all 280
study patients were 74% and 38%, respectively. There
were 49 actual 5-year survivors and 21 actual 10-year
survivors.

Patient Survivals: Impact of Demographic and Clinical
Variables
Age, race, gender, and blood group had no impact on
patient survivals. Allograft type and status 1 listing also had
no impact on survivals. Clinical variables that were
significant predictors of worse survival included inpatient
hospitalization prior to transplant (p=0.006), ICU admission prior to transplant (p<0.001), serum creatinine
≥1.5 mg/dL (p<0.001), and serum bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dL
(p=0.015) (Table 1).
Patient Survivals Stratified by Indication
When stratified by indication for transplant, there were
differences in patient survival. Those patients transplanted
prior to 1994, without specific oncologic listing diagnoses
in the database, had 1- and 5-year survivals of 67 and 30%,
respectively. Patients transplanted from 1994 to 2005 with a
listing diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of
PSC had 1- and 5-year survivals of 90 and 79%,
respectively. Patients with known cholangiocarcinoma in
the absence of PSC had 1- and 5-year survivals of 90 and
64%, respectively. Those with known PSC but an incidental
finding of cholangiocarcinoma had 1- and 5-year survivals
of 79 and 18%, respectively, and those with no known PSC
or cholangiocarcinoma at listing had 1- and 5-year survivals
of 82 and 30%, respectively.
Patients could therefore be stratified into a historical
group, transplanted prior to 1994 with cholangiocarcinoma
listed as the overall diagnosis (n=101), those transplanted
from 1994 to 2005 with known cholangiocarcinoma (n=
102), and those transplanted from 1994 to 2005 with an
incidental diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (n=77). When
comparing survivals between these groups, the historic
group and the incidental cholangiocarcinoma group had
similar 5-year survivals (30 vs. 20%, respectively, p=
0.646). However, patients with known cholangiocarcinoma
prior to OLT experienced an improved 5-year survival rate
of 68% (compared with historic survivals, p<0.001;
compared with incidental diagnosis, p<0.001) (Fig. 1).
Patient Survivals Stratified by PSC Status
Of the 179 patients with a defined listing diagnosis, 69
(39%) patients were listed with a diagnosis of PSC. The 5-

year survival rate in patients with PSC was 41%, compared
to 50% in patients without PSC (p=0.402).
Patient Survivals Stratified by Cause of Death
Of the 128 patients who died more than 30 days post-OLT,
the cause of death was known in 114 of these 128 cases
(89%). Of these, 55 patients died from locally recurrent (19
patients) or metastatic disease (36 patients), 24 patients died
from infection, 13 patients died from allograft failure, and
22 patients died from other causes. Patients who died from
recurrent disease had 1- and 5-year survival rates of 76 and
17%, respectively, with a median survival of 601 days
compared with 1-year, 5-year, and median survivals of
44%, 3%, and 322 days for those who died from noncancer causes (p<0.005) (Fig. 2).
Patient Survival after Retransplant
Twenty patients underwent one retransplant after their
initial transplant for cholangiocarcinoma, and two patients
were transplanted a third time. Two patients died within 30
days of retransplant. Median survival after retransplant was
479 days. One- and 3-year patient survivals after retransplant were 50 and 37%, respectively. Comparing patient
outcomes for those requiring retransplant (median survival:
595 days) to those not requiring retransplant (median
survival: 1,069), overall survivals were statistically similar
(p=0.407).
Era of Transplantation
For the 101 UNOS-listed patients transplanted prior to
1994, the 5-year survival rate was 30% and the median
survival time was 587 days. For the 179 patients with
complete diagnostic data for cholangiocarcinoma transplanted between 1995 and 2005, the 5-year survival rate
was 45% and the median survival time was 1,413 days (p<
0.01) (Fig. 3). Dividing this group by era (1994–2000 vs.
2001–2005), no survival improvement was observed. The
66 patients transplanted from 1994–2000 experienced a 3-
year survival rate of 58% and the median survival time was
1,367 days. The 3-year and median survivals for the 113
patients transplanted from 2001–2005 were 60% and 1,242
days, respectively (p=0.569).
Allograft Survivals
At a median graft follow-up interval of 390 days (range: 0–
6,166 days), 1- and 5-year allograft survivals were 69 and
36%, respectively. Twenty patients required retransplant,
including two patients who received a third allograft. Time
to first retransplant ranged from 4 to 2,673 days, with a

median of 44 days. The indication for retransplant was
available in 9 of these 22 cases. Vascular thrombosis was
the cause of allograft failure in six cases, whereas primary
nonfunction was the cause in three cases, one of which was
a second retransplant.
Discussion
Cholangiocarcinoma presents significant challenges to the
hepatobiliary surgeon, the medical oncologist, and the
radiation oncologist. The disease is often diagnosed at a
stage or in a location that precludes complete resection. In
addition, concomitant PSC is often considered a contraindication to resection due to the high likelihood of multifocal
disease, clinically significant underlying liver dysfunction,
and the high risk of recurrence following resection.2 Based
on these factors, liver transplantation has been used to treat
patients with local disease.
Recent single-center studies have reported favorable
outcomes in selected patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The largest such series is from the Mayo Clinic.8
Eligibility for their protocol is limited to patients with
unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma or hilar cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of PSC. Operative exploration was
used to rigorously confirm that patients were stage I or II,
without nodal or other metastases, prior to OLT. The
treatment included neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by a staging laparotomy in all patients. Of the 106
patients initially enrolled to this protocol, 11 patients died
or had evidence of disease spread before neoadjuvant
treatment was completed, and one was transplanted
elsewhere. An additional 18 patients experienced disease
progression diagnosed at laparotomy and were, therefore,
excluded from the study. Of the remaining 87 patients, 65
transplants have been reported to date. In these 65 patients,
1- and 5-year survivals were 91 and 76%, respectively, with
a median follow up interval of 18 months.8
In addition to the Mayo Clinic experience, there are two
registry-based reports that have examined outcomes in
patients transplanted for cholangiocarcinoma. In 2000,
Pascher et al. reported on patients treated with OLT for
cholangiocarcinoma recorded in the European Liver Transplant Registry and found a 5-year patient survival of 29%.14
Likewise, a report from the Cincinnati Transplant Registry
of 207 patients with cholangiocarcinoma who received liver
transplants between 1968 and 1997 found a 5-year patient
survival of 23%.15 Since this report, there have been no
US-based multicenter studies that have assessed more
recent outcomes data.
Our analysis of 280 patients identified an overall 5-year
patient survival of 38%, and a 60% 3-year survival rate in
patients transplanted after 2000. In addition, 21 patients had
actual survivals of greater than 10 years. The apparent
improvement in overall outcomes over time may be related
to several factors. These factors include improved staging,
improved patient selection, and possibly more effective
adjuvant therapies. With regard to staging, several groups
have reported that nodal or other extrahepatic involvement
and/or advanced disease stage (stage III or IV) are
independent predictors of adverse outcomes following
OLT.8,16,17 Likewise, the favorable outcomes reported by
the Mayo Clinic reflect the strict inclusion of patients with
early-stage disease.12,13,18 Combined, these findings support the use of a multimodality oncologic approach to
patients with early-stage (stage I or II), but unresectable,
cholangiocarcinoma that includes liver transplantation as
part of a protocol-based treatment plan.
For the more recent cohort, who had complete data
regarding the setting and timing of the cholangiocarcinoma
diagnosis, several important clinical observations were
made. Patients who were incidentally found to have
cholangiocarcinoma had a significantly worse prognosis
following transplant. The 5-year survival rate for patients
with known cholangiocarcinoma was 68%, and the median
survival time was not reached. In contrast, patients with
incidental cholangiocarcinoma found in the explanted liver
experienced 5-year survivals of only 20%, with a median
survival time of only 640 days.
The prognostic value of the timing of cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis (pre-OLT vs. incidental at the time of OLT)
was stronger than the presence or absence of PSC. Patients
with PSC and known cholangiocarcinoma experienced
higher survival rates compared to PSC patients with
incidentally found cholangiocarcinoma. Likewise, patients
without PSC were more likely to survive if their cholangiocarcinoma was identified prior to OLT.
The prognostic impact of cholangiocarcinoma developing in the setting of PSC is controversial. In this clinical
situation, cholangiocarcinoma may be difficult to diagnose
and is often an incidental finding during transplantation.19
A review of the Canadian experience with incidental
cholangiocarcinoma reported good short-term survivals,
but this benefit was lost after the second year posttransplant.20 Other single-center studies have found no
difference in prognosis.8,15,18
These observations can be explained in several ways.
First, independent of PSC status, patients with known
cholangiocarcinoma may undergo additional staging studies
to confirm the absence of metastases prior to OLT listing
(i.e., selection bias). Patients with incidental cholangiocarcinoma may harbor undetected distant disease, have a
higher stage at the time of transplant, and have a concomitant
poorer prognosis. Second, only the patients with known
cholangiocarcinoma can benefit from pre-OLT cancer
therapies. The UNOS/OPTN database does not record the
J Gastrointest Surg (2008) 12:117–122 121

presence or absence of pre-OLT chemoradiotherapy for
cholangiocarcinoma, so direct evidence of its efficacy cannot
be determined from this analysis.
Conclusions
This multi-institutional analysis of the US experience with
liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma determined that
outcomes following OLT for cholangiocarcinoma have
improved over time with a 5-year survival rate of 45%
during the most recent era of transplantation. Compared to
outcomes in similar patients treated with medical therapy
alone, patients with known cholangiocarcinoma that presents
at an early, but unresectable, stage appear to benefit from
OLT. However, patients incidentally found to have cholangiocarcinoma at the time of transplant, independent of the
presence or absence of PSC, have a poorer prognosis.
