Abstract The development of image-guided percutaneous techniques for local tumour ablation has been one of
the major advances in the treatment of liver malignancies.
Among these methods, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is
currently established as the primary ablative modality at
most institutions. RFA is accepted as the best therapeutic
choice for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when liver transplantation or surgical resection are not suitable options [1, 2]. In addition, RFA is
considered a viable alternate to surgery (1) for inoperable
patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease, especially
from colorectal cancer, and (2) for patients deemed ineligible for surgical resection because of extent and location
of the disease or concurrent medical conditions [3]. These
guidelines were written to be used in quality-improvement
programs to assess RFA of HCC and liver metastases. The
most important processes of care are (1) patient selection,
(2) performing the procedure, and (3) monitoring the
patient. The outcome measures or indicators for these
processes are indications, success rates, and complication
rates.
Definitions
Ablative Margin
This is the region ablated beyond the borders of the tumour
to achieve complete tumour destruction. Ideally, it should
measure 0.5–1.0 cm wide.
Complete Ablation
This is the nonenhancing area, including the tumour and the
ablative margin, on contrast-enhanced imaging modalities.
Complications
Complications can be stratified on the basis of outcome by
using the society of interventional radiology (SIR) standard
table. Major complications result in admission to a hospital
for therapy (for outpatient procedures), an unplanned
increase in the level of care, prolonged hospitalization,
permanent adverse sequelae, or death. Minor complications
result in no sequelae, and they may require nominal therapy or a short hospital stay for observation (generally
overnight). Major and minor complications and side effects
should be reported on the basis of the number of ablation
sessions on a per-session basis.
Electrode (Radiofrequency Applicator)
One or multiple electrodes are inserted directly into the
tumour to deliver RF energy current. Electrodes can be
monopolar or bipolar, and they can have different designs
(multitined expandable, internally cooled, perfused).

– Monopolar Electrode This has a single active electrode
applicator, with current dissipated at one or several
return grounding pads.
– Bipolar Electrode This consists in two electrode
applicators or in a single array containing both the
active and return electrodes.
– Multitined Expandable Electrode This has multiple
electrode tines that expand from a larger needle cannula.
– Internally Cooled Electrode This electrode has an
internal lumen that is perfused by saline without
coming into direct contact with patient body tissue.
– Perfused Electrode The tip of the electrode has small
apertures that allow the fluid (usually saline) to come in
contact with the tissue.
Heat-Sink Effect
This is convective cooling by adjacent blood vessels, usually C3 mm, when ablated tissues are heated. It can negatively affect the results of RFA because it can potentially
remove heat before complete tumour ablation is achieved.
Hydro/Gas Dissection
This is the instillation of liquid (dextrose 5%, sterile water)
or gas (air, carbon dioxide) between the area of ablation and
the structure vulnerable to heating damage (usually the
bowel).
Incomplete Ablation
This is the presence of residual unablated tumour, which is
seen as peripheral irregular enhancement at imaging. It
often grows in a scattered, nodular, or eccentric pattern.
Local Tumour Progression
This is the appearance at follow-up of foci of untreated
disease in tumours that were previously considered to be
completely ablated.
Overall Survival
This is the time from inclusion in the study to death.
Patients who are alive at the end of follow-up are censored.
Radiofrequency Ablation
This is coagulation induction from all electromagnetic
energy sources with frequencies \30 MHz. For tumour
ablation purposes, the frequency is usually in the range of
375 to 500 kHz.
Technical Success
This is considered when treatment of the tumour was performed according to protocol and complete tumour coverage
is assessed either during or immediately after the procedure.
Transient Hyperechoic Zone
This is the transient ([30–90 min) zone of increased echogenicity seen at US within and surrounding a tumour
during and immediatelyafter RFA.
Indications
HCC
RFA is the therapy of choice in very early and early
HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) classification (Table 1) when patients are not
candidates for either liver resection or transplantation.
Patients are required to have a single tumour smaller or
as many as three nodules \3 cm each, no evidence of
vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, performance
status test of 0, and liver cirrhosis in Child-Pugh class A
or B.
Liver Metastases
Primary Tumour Histotype
RFA is generally indicated for nonsurgical patients with
colorectal cancer oligometastases isolated to the liver.
Selected patients with limited hepatic and pulmonary
colorectal metastatic disease, however, may qualify for
percutaneous treatment if extrahepatic disease is deemed
curable. In patients with hepatic metastases from other
primary cancers, promising initial results have been
reported in the treatment of breast and endocrine tumours.
Number of Lesions
The number of lesions should not be considered an absolute contraindication to RFA if successful treatment of all
metastatic deposits can be accomplished. Nevertheless,
most centres preferentially treat patients with B5 lesions.
Tumour Size
The target tumour should not exceed 3 cm at its longest
axis to achieve best rates of complete ablation using most
of the currently available devices.

Tumour Location
Pretreatment imaging must carefully define the location of
each lesion with respect to surrounding structures as follows:
– Lesions located on the surface of the liver can be
considered for RFA, although their treatment requires
adequate expertise and may be associated with a higher
risk of complications.
– Thermal ablation of superficial lesions that are adjacent to
any part of the gastrointestinal tract must be avoided
because of the risk of thermal injury of the gastric or bowel
wall. The colon appears to be at greater risk than the
stomach or small bowel for thermally mediated perforation. Gastric complications are rare, most likely owing to
the relatively greater wall thickness of the stomach or the
rarity of surgical adhesions along the gastrohepatic
ligament. Mobility of the small bowel may also provide
the bowel with greater protection compared with the
relatively fixed colon. The use of special techniques, such
as intraperitoneal injection of dextrose to displace the
bowel, can be considered in such instances.
– Treatment of lesions adjacent to the hepatic hilum
increases the risk of thermal injury of the biliary tract.
This tumour location represents a relative contraindication to RFA. In experienced hands, thermal ablation
of tumours located near the gallbladder has been shown
to be feasible, although associated in most cases with
self-limited iatrogenic cholecystitis.
– Thermal ablation of lesions adjacent to hepatic vessels
is possible because flowing blood usually protects the
vascular wall from thermal injury. In this case, however,
the risk of incomplete treatment of the neoplastic tissue
close to the vessel may increase due to heat loss by
convection.
Physician Credentialing
Before treatment, all patients with liver tumours who are
considered for RFA should undergo a thorough clinical
evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, including an
interventional radiologist, a hepatologist, an oncologist, a
surgeon, and an anesthesiologist. The core of physiological
knowledge required for the interventional radiologist
includes understanding liver anatomy, liver tumour diagnosis, and radiologic and non radiologic treatment options.
Imaging Guidance and Monitoring
Targeting of the lesion can be performed with ultrasound,
computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The guidance system is chosen largely on
the basis of tumour visibility, operator preference, and
local availability of dedicated equipment, such as CT
fluoroscopy or open MRI systems. The transient hyperechoic zone that is seen on ultrasound within and surrounding a tumour during and immediately after RFA can
be used as an approximate guide to the extent of tumour
destruction. It is not sufficient to evaluate immediate
treatment effectiveness, and follow-up imaging is mandatory. MRI currently is the only imaging modality with
validated techniques for real-time temperature monitoring.
Anesthesiology Care
Thermal ablation is usually performed with the patient
under intravenous sedation or general anaesthesia with
standard cardiac, pressure, and oxygen monitoring. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (Appendix)
can be used to assess patient physical status before RFA.
Patients with BASA III score can be treated.
Posttreatment Assessment and Follow-Up
Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are recognized as the standard modalities with which to assess treatment outcome. CT
and MRI results obtained 4–6 weeks after treatment show
successful ablation as a nonenhancing area with or without
a peripheral enhancing rim. The enhancing rim that may be
observed along the periphery of the ablation zone appears to
be a relatively concentric, symmetric, and uniform process
in an area with smooth inner margins. This transient finding
represents a benign physiologic response to thermal injury
(reactive hyperemia initially and fibrosis and giant cell
reaction subsequently). Benign periablational enhancement must be differentiated from irregular peripheral

enhancement due to residual tumour that occurs at the
treatment margin. Compared with benign periablational
enhancement, residual unablated tumour often grows in
scattered, nodular, or eccentric patterns. Contrast-enhanced
ultrasound can be performed after the end of the procedure
and may allow initial evaluation of treatment effects.
Later follow-up imaging studies should be aimed at
detecting local tumour progression, development of new
hepatic lesions, or emergence of extrahepatic disease. A
recommended follow-up protocol includes CT or MRI
studies at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment and at
6-month intervals thereafter for the next 3 years.
Contraindications
Contraindications for RFA are as follows:
1. tumour located\1 cm from the main biliary duct (due
to risk of delayed stenosis of the main biliary tract);
2. intrahepatic bile duct dilation;
3. anterior exophytic location of the tumour (due to the
risk of tumour seeding);
4. bilioenteric anastomosis; and
5. untreatable/unmanageable coagulopathy.
Clinical Results: HCC
Technique Effectiveness
RFA yields satisfactory local tumour control in treating
small HCCs, with a complete ablation rate on imaging of
approximately 90% in tumours [3 cm [4–8]. Histological
data from explanted liver specimens in patients who have
undergone RFA showed that tumour size and presence of
large (B3 mm) abutting vessels significantly affect local
treatment effect. Complete tumour necrosis was pathologically shown in 83% of tumours \3 cm and 88% of
tumours located in a nonperivascular space [9]. Comparison with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in five randomized trials [4–8] showed that RFA has a higher local
anticancer effect than PEI, thus leading to better local
control of the disease (Table 2). Consequently there is no
room per PEI in HCC amenable to RFA.
Survival
Five randomized trials compared RFA with PEI for local
ablation of early-stage HCC (Table 2). The two European
trials failed to show a statistically significant difference in
overall survival between patients who received RFA
compared with those receiving PEI [4, 8]. However, survival advantages were identified in three Asian studies
[5–7]. These data were recently pooled in two independent meta-analysis, and the survival benefit of patients
with small HCCs who received RFA was confirmed [10,
11]. Therefore, RFA is the preferred percutaneous treatment for patients with early-stage HCC on the basis of
more consistent local tumour control and better survival
outcomes.
Recently, the long-term survival outcomes of RFAtreated patients were reported (Table 3) [12–17]. In
patients who underwent RFA, survival depended on the
severity of underlying cirrhosis and tumour stage. Patients
in Child-Pugh class A with early stage HCC had a 5-year

survival rate of 61 to 77%, whereas patients with a single

Clinical Results: Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
Technique Effectiveness
Many studies have investigated the use of RFA in the
treatment of limited colorectal cancer hepatic metastatic
disease in patients who were excluded from surgery. Two
early studies reported rates of complete response that did
not exceed 60–70% [18, 19]. Subsequently, owing to the
advances in RFA technique and probably to the treatment
of smaller tumours, reported rates of successful local
tumour control after RFA treatment increased substantially.
In two series, RFA allowed eradication of 91% of 100
metastases and 97% of 74 metastases, respectively [20, 21].
Survival
Recently, data on long-term survival of nonsurgical patients
with hepatic colorectal metastases who underwent RFA
have been reported (Table 4) [22–28]. In particular, in three
series including patients with B5, each B5 cm, the 5-year
survival rate ranged 24–44% at 5 years [22, 23, 26]. When
RFA was performed in patients with small (\4 cm) solitary
hepatic colorectal metastases, a 40% 5-year survival rate
was demonstrated [29]. These figures are substantially
higher than those obtained with any chemotherapy regimens and provide indirect evidence that RFA therapy
improves survival in patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease. This conclusion is supported by the interim
analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing chemotherapy plus RFA versus chemotherapy alone in colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver [30].
Complications
Early major complications associated with RFA occur in
2.2–3.1% of patients and include intraperitoneal bleeding,
liver abscess, intestinal perforation, pneumothorax and
haemothorax, bile duct stenosis, and tumour seeding
(0.5%); the procedure mortality rate is 0.1–0.5% (Table 5).
The minor complication rate ranges from 5% to 8.9%. The
most common causes of death are sepsis, hepatic failure,
colon perforation, and portal vein thrombosis, whereas the
most common complications are intraperitoneal bleeding,
hepatic abscess, bile duct injury, hepatic decompensation,
and grounding pad burns. Minor complications and side

effects are usually transient and self-limiting [31–33]. An
uncommon late complication of RFA can be tumour
seeding along the needle track. In patients with HCC,
tumour seeding occurred in 8 (0.5%) of 1,610 cases in a
multicentre survey [31] and in 1 (0.5%) of 187 cases in a
single-institution series [12]. Lesions with subcapsular
location and an invasive tumoural pattern, as shown by a
poor differentiation degree, seem to be at higher risk for
such a complication [34].
