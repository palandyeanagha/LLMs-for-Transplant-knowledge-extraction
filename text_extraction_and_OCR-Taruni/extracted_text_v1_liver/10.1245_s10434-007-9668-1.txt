Treatment strategies for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer have changed dramatically in the last
decade. Patients with colorectal cancer metastases
confined to the liver have always been a fascinating
group to consider biologically and for local regional
treatment strategies. In the late 1980s through the
1990s, resection was performed for a select subset of
patients who had resectable disease. However, a high
proportion of patients had bilobar unresectable disease and were treated with either 5-fluorouracil–
based systemic chemotherapy or with implanted hepatic arterial infusion pumps. The advent of the new
millennium was associated with the availability of
several new cytotoxic and biologic agents active in
colorectal cancer. These agents have completely
changed the approach to the treatment of patients
with colorectal cancer liver metastases and thus have
increased the complexity of the decision-making
process in these patients.
In this issue of the Annals of Surgical Oncology,
Mulier and colleagues have written a thorough and
thoughtful treatise on the role of surgical therapy for
colorectal cancer liver metastases. Starting in the mid1990s, radiofrequency ablation was used to treat patients with unresectable primary or secondary hepatic
malignancies in an attempt to completely eradicate
the measurable disease. In some patients, radiofrequency ablation was the only local tumor treatment,
and in others, some lesions were resected while others
underwent concomitant thermal destruction. The
putative end point in the use of radiofrequency ablation was to increase the proportion of hepatic malignancy patients treated with curative intent. Studies on
the use of radiofrequency ablation for unresectable
primary and metastatic liver tumors performed in the
1990s led to approval of this treatment modality by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2001.
It is important to emphasize that radiofrequency
ablation was approved as a treatment for unresectable hepatic malignancies. Unfortunately, this thermal ablation modality has now been applied in the
treatment of both resectable and unresectable disease
without the benefit of a randomized clinical trial
demonstrating survival equivalence. The absence of
such a clinical trial has led Mulier et al. to suggest
that it may be time to perform such a study to evaluate the outcomes in patients undergoing resection
versus radiofrequency ablation of otherwise resectable colorectal cancer metastases.
I enjoy a bit of controversy and debate as much as
anyone, and the article by Mulier et al. should stimulate some lively discussion. Ruefully, I will state
openly that I do not think it is time for a randomized
clinical trial comparing resection versus radiofrequency ablation in colorectal cancer liver metastases.
I have been involved in preclinical and clinical research studies that use radiofrequency ablation to
treat primary and secondary hepatic malignancies
since the mid-1990s. I have learned a great deal about
the indications, risks, and limitations of this thermal
tumor-destruction device. As a result, I now use
radiofrequency ablation much less frequently in patients I treat for malignant hepatic tumors. Specifically in patients with colorectal cancer liver
metastases, I now use radiofrequency ablation only to
destroy one or two small tumors contralateral to the

larger tumors that are resected. This involves <10%
of the patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases
that I have treated in the past 2 years.
The reason why I believe such a prospective, randomized study would be problematic and possibly
even ethically tenuous relates to a number of factors.
First, the definition of what a resectable lesion is can
vary dramatically from center to center on the basis
of the experience and aggressiveness of the surgical
team. Second, thermal ablation techniques are particularly ineffective for tumors >5 cm in diameter,
and this would immediately exclude patients with
larger metastatic lesions. Mulier has suggested that
only lesions <3 cm in diameter should be included in
the proposed study, but the treatment failure rate
after radiofrequency ablation of even these smaller
tumors is higher than local recurrence rates after
definitive resection. Third, many of the colorectal
cancer patients we now treat have undergone many
cycles of systemic chemotherapy, leading to downsizing of their malignant hepatic lesions. An excellent
response to systemic chemotherapy has increased our
willingness to treat the remaining metastatic disease
aggressively. Resection of the entire area of preexisting tumor is more oncologically sound than
attempting thermal destruction of a frequently illdefined region in the liver. Fourth, surgical resection
of colorectal cancer liver metastases when performed
in high-volume centers is associated with very low
surgical mortality and morbidity rates. It is unlikely
that the complication rate associated with a major
liver resection will ever be as low as that associated
with a radiofrequency ablation, but the trade-off of
definitive removal of the malignant disease compared
with the uncertainty of complete destruction with the
thermal ablation device is an important consideration
with a value that is difficult to measure. Even in the
most fastidious hands, and when performed using
intraoperative ultrasonography for placement of the
radiofrequency needle electrodes, incomplete
destruction of the tumor with recurrence at the
margins occurs at a higher rate than local recurrence
along a margin-negative resection line. Of much
greater concern is the fact that when radiofrequency
ablation is performed transcutaneously with computed tomography or ultrasound guidance, the rate
of incomplete tumor destruction can range from 10%
to >40%, as reported in the radiology literature. This
is a wholly unacceptable rate of treatment failure and
is associated with factors that include of imprecise
radiofrequency needle electrode placement, variable
tumor tissue density, tumor blood flow, and influence
of blood flow in adjacent large hepatic vessels.
Were these authors recommending a trial of
resection versus radiofrequency ablation for earlystage hepatocellular cancer, it would be much easier
to endorse such a study. All of us involved in hepatobiliary tumor surgery recognize the increased risk
associated with tumor resection in the cirrhotic liver.
The reported lower complication rates of radiofrequency ablation of small hepatocellular cancers
compared with the high risk for morbidity and
mortality after resection in these patients with coexistent chronic liver injury makes such a study a more
attractive option. In this case, equivalent survival
associated with a far lower complication rate in patients with cirrhosis would be an important finding.
However, I do not think that a noninferiority trial
with a difference in 5-year survival of <10% would
be acceptable in colorectal cancer metastasis. A 10%
reduction in survival rate with radiofrequency ablation of colorectal cancer liver metastases for resectable lesions would potentially mean that thousands of
patients annually would receive inadequate treatment
and could die of recurrent malignant disease as a
result. Attempting to justify such a trial on the basis
of ‘‘evidence-based medicine’’ is ethically dubious at
best. Radiofrequency tumor ablation devices are
imperfect, and until improvements in this technology
are made that assure complete tumor destruction
despite tumor density, vascularity, and proximity to
major intrahepatic blood vessels in >98% of the
treated tumors, thermal tumor destruction will be
associated with higher rates of local treatment failure
compared with resection. Even if the devices evolve
and improve, it is difficult to account in a clinical trial
for the training and experience of treating physicians
with optimal and appropriate placement of the
radiofrequency needle electrodes. Imaging accuracy
and—once again—the experience of the treating
physician with real-time imaging modalities adds yet
another level of complexity.
My greatest fear is that should a seemingly welldesigned, carefully performed, and thoroughly analyzed clinical trial comparing transcutaneous radiofrequency ablation with resection for colorectal
cancer liver metastases be performed, it would open
the floodgates (sadly, already partially opened) to the
occasional practitioner of thermal tumor ablation.
Oncologic principles would be abased, and the outcome of patients in the real world outside the tight
control and constraints of a clinical trial would be
compromised. I already see an alarming number of
patients with initially resectable hepatic metastases
referred to me after failure of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. Unfortunately, some of these

patients have resectable recurrent disease, and they
ultimately die of it. It is impossible to know the
proportion who would have survived in the long term
had they undergone resection, but I dont think we
can justify this experiment. It is not yet time for a
randomized clinical trial comparing resection with
radiofrequency ablation for respectable colorectal
cancer liver metastases. Let the debate begin.
