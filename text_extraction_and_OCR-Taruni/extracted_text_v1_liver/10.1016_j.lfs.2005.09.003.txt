Abstract:
Many review papers have been published on mushrooms of the genus Amanita, as these are well known to both 
scientific and lay audiences, probably due to the toxic and/or hallucinogenic properties of some species. This 
article aims to supplement the content of previous reviews by categorizing all of the natural products isolated
from any species in the genus Amanita. These compounds are subdivided into six major structural types, and 
references are provided for all species that have been examined chemically.
Keywords: Amanita; Mushrooms; Chemical structural classes

Introduction
Some of the morphological characteristics of the genus Amanita include white spore prints, gills free from the 
stem, and the presence of a universal veil (Lincoff, 1981). Species of this genus are found commonly 
throughout the world, and this includes mushrooms known to possess either toxic and/or hallucinogenic 
properties. Historical evidence suggests that at least three Roman emperors and a Pope may have been among 
the victims of mushroom poisoning (Block et al., 1955). Even in modern times, it has been estimated that nearly 
90% of reported cases of lethal poisonings caused by the consumption of mushrooms, especially in Central 
Europe and North America, are due to two of the most poisonous species of this genus, the notorious death cap 
(A. phalloides) and destroying angel (A. virosa) (Wieland, 1968). Another important species of this genus, A. 
muscaria, also known commonly as ‗fly agaric,‘ is one of the more beautiful and widely recognized 
mushrooms, due to its blood-red color and pyramidal, white patches (Lincoff, 1981). Consumption of A. 
muscaria for ceremonial and/or recreational purposes probably predates recorded history, due to its 
hallucinogenic effects, and there are many interesting descriptions of its use among Siberian tribesmen 
(Schultes, 1969). Idealized representations of this species permeate popular culture. Besides the well-known 
example of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (Carroll, 2000), A. muscaria can be found in the background of 
many children's cartoons and as a major ‗obstacle' in video games (e.g., the Smurfs and Super Mario Bros., 
respectively) besides numerous other depictions on album covers, greeting cards, t-shirts, etc. In short, 
mushrooms from this genus are heavily investigated scientifically and extremely well known conceptually; in 
many ways, they have become an integral part of human society.
The number of species of Amanita has been approximated at 900–1000, and new species are being discovered 
continuously, including recent examples in the last 2 years (Sanmee et al., 2003, Yang, 2003 and Yang et al., 

2004). However, a search of the literature suggests that only 17 identified species of Amanita have been 
screened chemically, which resulted in the description of more than 70 compounds, representing six major 
structural classes. The broad familiarity of this genus, coupled with the diverse chemical components isolated 
from it, especially the deadly toxins, have drawn the attention of chemists and mycologists. Quite a few reviews 
have been written on various aspects of Amanita, such as the chemotaxonomy (Beutler and Der Marderosian, 
1981), the history and use of the hallucinogenic properties (Schultes, 1969), and a recent review specifically on 
A. muscaria (Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 2003). However, to the best of our knowledge, a review on the 
chemistry of compounds isolated from mushrooms of the genus Amanita has not been prepared.
Chemical investigation of Amanita toxins can be traced to 1899 (Schlesinger and Ford, 1907), and qualitative 
and quantitative analyses of Amanita toxins using chromatographic methods were reported about a half of a 
century later (Block et al., 1955 and Dubash and Teare, 1946). Yet, as evidenced by the references cited in the 
following sections, detailed structural analyses of compounds isolated from Amanita species, especially the 
peptides, only became achievable several decades later, probably due to recent advances in modern 
spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques. Broadly, the structures of the compounds reported from Amanita to 
date can be subdivided into the following six categories: peptides, amavadin, isoxazoles, simple amino acids 
and related derivatives, sterols, and ceramides.
Discussion
Peptides
Recent reviews have discussed the occurrence, chemistry and toxicology of peptides from Amanita (Fig. 1; 
amatoxins, phallotoxins and virotoxins) (Karlson-Stiber and Persson, 2003 and Vetter, 1998), especially those 
occurring in A. phalloides, which was one of the earliest identified toxic mushrooms, as one bite of this 
mushroom can kill an adult (Wieland, 1968). Interestingly, the toxicity of A. phalloides is relatively slow, 
emerging 10–15 h post-consumption, which may account for the grave consequences, since the toxins have 
been absorbed thoroughly in the body by then (Block et al., 1955). In addition, several other Amanita species, 
including A. bisporigera, A. verna, and A. virosa, have been found to produce toxic peptides as well (Preston et 
al., 1975, Seeger and Stijve, 1979 and Yocum and Simons, 1977).

Fig. 1. Representative structures of amatoxins, phallotoxins, and virotoxins.
These peptides, considered the major toxins from Amanita, can be classified into three groups: amatoxins, 
phallotoxins and virotoxins (Fig. 1). The phallotoxins and virotoxins act relatively quickly, inducing death in 
mice and rats often within 1–2 h. Conversely, the amatoxins are relatively slow-acting poisons, having a lethal 
interval of at least 15 h post-consumption. However, as amatoxins are 10–20 times more toxic than phallotoxins 
and virotoxins, it has been concluded that amatoxins are probably responsible for fatal human poisonings 
(Wieland and Faulstich, 1978). In fact, since phallotoxins and virotoxins do not exert any acute toxicity after 
ingestion, their effects in human poisoning may be negligible (Karlson-Stiber and Persson, 2003 and Wieland, 
1983). Virotoxins were the most recently described peptides from Amanita (Faulstich et al., 1980), and to date, 
they have only been found in A. virosa. Conversely, amatoxins and phallotoxins have been observed even in 
other genera, including Clitocybe, Galerina and Lepiota species, and the relative differences in toxin content of 
these have been discussed (Klan, 1993 and Koppel, 1993).
Structurally, all three types of peptides are characterized as cyclopeptides containing a sulfur-linked tryptophan 
unit and some unusual hydroxylated amino acids. The amatoxins and phallotoxins are octapeptides and 
heptapeptides, respectively. These two groups of peptides have been investigated thoroughly, owing to the 

novelty of being some of the earliest identified toxins. For example, more than 40 derivatives of amatoxin have 
been synthesized (Wieland, 1983), and the structure–activity relationships for some of these have been explored 
(Shoham et al., 1984, Shoham et al., 1989 and Wieland et al., 1983). Structurally related to the phallotoxins, the 
virotoxins are heptapeptides also. The conformation of viroisin, a representative of this class, was investigated 
by 2D NMR (Bhaskaran and Yu, 1994). All proton signals were assigned completely, and interproton distances 
were determined from ROESY studies. It has been proposed that the virotoxins are derived biosynthetically 
from the phallotoxins or from a common precursor molecule (Wieland, 1983).
Amavadin
Amavadin (Fig. 2) is a pale blue vanadium complex isolated originally from A. muscaria (Bayer and Kneifel, 
1972 and Kneifel and Bayer, 1973). In general, metal accumulation may be a means for organisms to protect 
against toxicity arising from an excess of metal in soil. However, the concentration of vanadium in some 
Amanita species is unusually high, often several hundred times more than those found in plants (Berry et al., 
1999).
Fig. 2. Structure of amavadin.
The structure of amavadin includes a vanadium atom at the center, existing as an eight-coordinate and 
containing a 1:2 complex of V(IV):N-hydroxyimino-2,2′-dipropionic acid. This unique structure has garnered 
enormous interests from chemists, and its structure has been reviewed repeatedly (Crans et al., 2004, Harben et 
al., 1997, Kneifel and Bayer, 1986 and Koch et al., 1987). A recent X-ray crystallographic study confirmed this 
novel structure (Berry et al., 1999), and another report, which utilized comprehensive spectroscopic 
experiments, including 1H, 13C-NMR, COSY, NOE, and CD, showed that amavadin consists of nearly an 
equimolar mixture of the d- and l-isomers of [V(S,S-HIDPA)2]
2− (Armstrong et al., 2000).
Isoxazoles
Although not very complex structurally, this class of compounds is important pharmacologically, because these 
CNS-active constituents are responsible for the hallucinogenic effect of A. muscaria (Fig. 3). Ibotenic acid and 
muscimol, both of which were identified nearly simultaneously by several groups in the mid-1960s, are the two 

best known representatives (Eugster and Takemoto, 1967, Good et al., 1965, Mueller and Eugster, 1965, 
Takemoto and Nakajima, 1964 and Takemoto et al., 1964). These two compounds have been reported largely 
from A. muscaria and A. pantherina (Benedict et al., 1966 and Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 2003), although 
at least one study noted their presence in A. cothurnata and A. gemmata (Chilton and Ott, 1976). Ibotenic acid 
acts as an excitatory amino acid at glutamate receptors, and muscimol is a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
receptor agonist. Their hallucinogenic effects have been discussed in recent review articles (Halpern, 2004 and 
Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 2003). Chemotoxomic studies have been completed on a large number of 
Amanita species, and the purification and analysis of isoxazoles using gas chromatographic methods were 
reviewed (Beutler and Der Marderosian, 1981). In addition, numerous studies to synthesize structurally related 
analogues have been conducted, and most of this research has been reviewed recently (Michelot and MelendezHowell, 2003). Even today, 40 years after their initial description, recent studies continue to explore this 
interesting class of compounds, especially with respect to their effects in the brain (Shirakawa and Ichitani, 
2004).

Simple amino acid derivatives and polyketides
Most low molecular weight compounds fall into this category, generally having molecular weights below 200 
a.m.u. (Fig. 4). These structures include triple bond-containing compounds, chlorinated compounds, 
cyclopropyl-containing compounds, tryptophan-containing compounds, and polyketide-derived pigments 
(Chilton and Drehmel, 2001). Most of these are considered as pigments, along with the above-mentioned 
amavadin, and their structures have been reviewed earlier (Gill, 1994 and Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 
2003). The most studied pigment is muscarufin, which is responsible for the bright color of A. muscaria
(Musso, 1982).

a sterol isolated from A. pantherina and A. virgineoides (Yaoita et al., 1999).
Ceramides
Several ceramides were isolated via an investigation of mushrooms from five different genera, including A. 
pantherina (Fig. 6) (Yaoita et al., 2002). Among the series of isolated compounds, three were from this species, 
and these structures were elucidated via spectrometric and spectroscopic data, including HRMS and 2D NMR. 
This class of compounds can be described as having a polyketide-like moiety that is linked through a secondary 
amine to an oxygenated aliphatic chain of variable length, and they appear to be the most recently described 
structural class reported from Amanita species.

Conclusion
Table 1 summarizes the chemistry of Amanita by providing the scientific names of those species that have been 
investigated, the number and type of compounds isolated from each species, and references for the description 
of the isolation and/or structure elucidation studies and pertinent review papers. These data reveal that the 
majority of compounds come from A. phalloides, A. virosa, A. muscaria, and A. pantherina, a result that is not 
surprising given the toxic and/or hallucinogenic properties of these species. Thus, it is recognized that this 
analysis does not represent the full chemical composition of the entire genus, Amanita. Typically, other, less 
well-known species, have been screened only to analyze for the known toxins. Therefore, given the large 
number of species of Amanita, these data suggest that this genus is under explored and ripe for future 
investigations, especially from the viewpoint of chemistry.
