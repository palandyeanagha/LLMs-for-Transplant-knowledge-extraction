Summary
An 85-year-old man presented with a pale appearance 
and generalised pruritic papules. Laboratory 
investigations disclosed eosinophilia, autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, mixed hyperbilirubinaemia, 
cholestasis and elevated serum IgG4 levels. Abdominal 
sonography and CT showed progressive dilatation 
of biliary trees, with diffuse pancreatic enlargement 
and a subtle capsule-like low-density rim around the 
pancreatic head and body. Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography found no stone-related biliary 
obstruction, while endoscopic transpapillary biopsy 
demonstrated chronic inflammation only. Nevertheless, 
the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease with coexisting 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia was presumed. 
The clinical picture and laboratory abnormalities 
improved after administration of moderate dose of 
methylprednisolone.
Background 
IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-organ, 
fibro-inflammatory disease with various presentations. Here, we describe a case of IgG4-RD involving 
pancreas, biliary trees and skin, which initially came 
to clinical attention due to eosinophilia, elevated 
IgE and itchy skin rashes, mimicking an allergic 
reaction. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) 
was noted during survey. To the best of our knowledge, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and AIHA has 
rarely been reported in the literature. This case 
is of great value in showing the heterogeneity of 
IgG4-RD.
Case presentation
An 85-year-old male veteran was referred to the 
Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology department of a tertiary referral centre for progressive, 
generalised pruritic reddish rashes in the neck, 
trunk and limbs for 6months; there were lethargy, 
poor appetite and 8kg of body weight loss. Antihistamines and topical glucocorticoids from dermatological clinics could only result in partial relief. 
One month before coming to our department, he 
was admitted in this hospital for the treatment of a 
community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin. 
Microbiological cultures failed to yield micro-organisms, but eosinophilia was present, which 
persisted despite a therapeutic trial of mebendazole; 
no parasites were identified. On admission, physical examination showed pale conjunctivae, mildly 
icteric sclera and erythematous maculopapules in 
the neck, limbs and trunk with excoriations; bilateral neck small lymphadenopathies were noted. 
Eight months earlier, he had an adenocarcinoma of 
the sigmoid colon, pTisN0M0, which was resected 
through a laparoscopic low anterior resection, and 
up to the present hospitalisation, no evidence of 
recurrence has been detected. Otherwise, he gave 
no pertinent travel, family, allergy or medication 
histories contributing to the present manifestations.
Investigations
Laboratory investigations showed marked eosinophilia (3501/μL), high IgE (6095.9 IU/mL), haemoglobin of 6.4g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume 
of 128.6 fL, reticulocytosis, serum aspartate transaminase of 80U/L without simultaneous elevation 
of alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) of 1193U/L, mixed hyperbilirubinaemia 
(total/direct bilirubin of 2.59/1.52mg/dL), undetectable haptoglobin with a positive direct Coombs’ 
test and absence of parasites/ova in stool; a diagnosis of AIHA and thrombocytopenia without 
disseminated intravascular coagulation was made. 
Immunological investigations revealed low C3 and 
C4, but absence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), 
anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) and antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). There were high 
titres of lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgM anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein-I antibodies but low 
titres of IgG anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies. Strangely, there was no overt thrombosis. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated erythroid 
hyperplasia. Thorough surveys failed to show 
evidence of infections or malignancies. Because 
serum alkaline phosphatase (324U/L) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (147U/L) were discrepantly 
high together with a mixed hyperbilirubinaemia 
per AIHA, abdominal sonography was carried 
out. Cholelithiasis with dilatation of common bile 
duct (CBD) as well as bilateral intrahepatic ducts 
was demonstrated. Contrast-enhanced CT further 
showed diffuse pancreatic enlargement, a subtle 
capsule-like low-density rim around the pancreatic head and body, and thickening of CBD walls 
(figures 1 and 2). Amylase (218U/L) and lipase 
(127U/L) were only mildly elevated. However, high 
serum IgG4 level (266mg/dL) with increased IgG4/
IgG ratio (10.9%) were noted. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed 
dilatation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile 
ducts without definite intraductular filling defects 
(figure 3A). Because of the abnormal hepatobiliary

Findings that shed new light on the possible pathogenesis of a disease or an adverse effect
biochemistries and cholelithiasis, an endoscopic papillotomy and 
balloon dilation were done to relieve the obstruction. However, 
there was no stone yielded after irrigations. Instead, a fibrosis 
of the distal CBD was demonstrated, which was presumed to be 
relevant to IgG4-related cholangitis (figure 3B). An endoscopic 
transpapillary biopsy showed duodenal tissue with chronic 
inflammation and scattered infiltration of IgG4-bearing plasma 
cells.
Differential diagnosis
An allergic reaction first came to our mind as newly noted skin 
rashes accompanied by eosinophilia and elevated IgE developed. 
However, the patient did not have recent alternation in medications, food or housing environment; there was no parasite 
nor conceivable improvement of symptoms after antihelminth. 
Bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial and other microbial cultures 
failed to demonstrate any aetiology. Bone marrow biopsy to find 
the cause of AIHA/thrombocytopenia and high LDH did not 
reveal any haematological malignancies. There was also no 
other solid tumour. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus 
based on thrombocytopenia, AIHA, hypocomplementemia and 
antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) was equivocal because of 
the senility onset and absence of ANA/anti-dsDNA antibodies. 
There was also no evidence to support ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). On the contrary, as abdominal CT showed the subtle 
but specific radiological signs for IgG4-related pancreatitis and 
related cholangitis with biliary stricture, IgG4-RD was suspected. 
Serum IgG4 levels and IgG4:IgG ratio were high even after 7 
days of systemic glucocorticoid treatment. ERCP confirmed dilatation of biliary tracts and fibrosis of the distal CBD. Although

Findings that shed new light on the possible pathogenesis of a disease or an adverse effect
the biopsy failed showing adequate amounts of IgG4-positive 
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, storiform fibrosis or obliterative 
phlebitis, IgG4-related cholangitis was still presumed because 
there were IgG4-related pancreatitis and fibrosis of the distal 
CBD without intraductular stones. Furthermore, the biopsy was 
done after glucocorticoid therapy, which might have inhibited 
the active inflammation by a large part. On the other hand, it 
is difficult to get deep tissues for confirming the diagnosis by 
an endoscopic transpapillary biopsy.1 2 Also, the eosinophilia 
with skin involvement is otherwise unexplainable. We did not 
perform skin biopsy as the rashes ameliorated after prescription of glucocorticoids and no new eruptions suitable for biopsy 
developed.
Treatment
Intravenous methylprednisolone 125mg/day for 2days and then 
62.5mg/day for 9days were given with close monitoring of the 
eosinophilia and AIHA. This was then followed by a switch to 
prednisolone 10mg/day after IgG4-RD had been diagnosed 
and AIHA been recovered. There was no blood transfusion 
throughout the course. The prednisolone dose was gradually 
reduced to 5mg every other day 6 months thereafter.
Outcome and follow-up
The rash, eosinophilia and hyperbilirubinaemia alleviated on 
discharge. One month later, the haemoglobin level returned 
from 8.5g/dL to 12.1g/dL and steadily increased to 14.6g/dL 
as of date. Abdominal sonography demonstrated no more dilatation of biliary tracts 3 months later. Serum IgG4 and biliary 
enzymes normalised 6 months later; APA and LA became negative. The patient reported improvement of appetite, a better 
well-being and experienced a 6kg weight gain with a body mass 
index of 20.8kg/m2
.
Discussion
IgG4-RD is characterised by tumefactive and fibro-inflammatory 
involvement of multiple organs or tissues with lymphoplasmacytic 
cells, and is most frequently seen in middle-aged to elderly men. 
Along with dense infiltrates of IgG4-bearing plasma cells, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis are distinctive histological 
features in the involved tissue. However, the clinical presentations 
are heterogeneous, non-specific and subacute. Our patient has 
fatigue and weight loss with moderate eosinophilia and elevated 
IgE, which are all common features of IgG4-RD.3
 These manifestations can also be present in a broad spectrum of diseases and hence 
do not suffice as clear guides. It was not until the CT demonstration 
of a classic autoimmune pancreatitis with probable sclerosing cholangitis that we realised IgG4-RD is the correct diagnosis. Erythematous papules, typically involving head and neck but have also been 
described on the trunk and limbs, are also common findings.4
 Had 
we suspected IgG4-RD earlier, a skin biopsy might have revealed 
the correct diagnosis. Nevertheless, a good and rapid response to 
glucocorticoid treatment supports our diagnosis.
The pancreas is one of the most vulnerable organs in IgG4-
RD. According to the international consensus diagnostic criteria 
proposed in 2011, the diagnosis can be made by a combination 
of parenchymal and ductal imaging, serum IgG4 levels, pancreatic histology, extrapancreatic disease and glucocorticoid responsiveness.5
 The pancreatitis itself causes little abdominal pain, but 
may lead to secondary diabetes mellitus in half of all cases due 
to chronic inflammation. The most common presentation is 
obstructive jaundice due to concomitant IgG4-related sclerosing 
cholangitis, which can be classified according to cholangiographic 
features. Our patient presented with type 1 stricture localised to 
the CBD, which is most frequently associated with autoimmune 
pancreatitis.6
Patients with IgG4-RD are known to have autoantibodies of 
unknown clinical significances; ANA and rheumatoid factor present 
in 16%–50%and 20% of patients, respectively. Hypocomplementemia, as in this particular patient, presents in 21% of cases with 
IgG4-RD.7 8 The mechanisms underlying their association remain 
ambiguous, as IgG4 cannot bind complement effectively, and has 
a negligible ability to activate the classical complement pathway as 
compared with other IgG subclasses. Indeed, the coexistence with 
AIHA, which is largely dependent on antibody-complement activation, has rarely been described in the literature. AIHA has been 
reported associated with one case of IgG4-related pancreatitis, one 
case of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC), two cases of 
IgG4-related pancreatitis and IgG4-SC, one case of IgG4-related 
lung disease and one case of IgG4-related lymphadenopathy.9–14
All these patients share a favourable prognosis of both conditions 
after glucocorticoid treatment. In addition to AIHA, IgG4-RD 
coexists with immune-complex-mediated vasculitides including 
hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, cryoglobulinaemic 
vasculitis and AAV.15–18 These associations may be attributable to 
activation of IgG1 and IgG3, as high immunohistochemical reactivity of IgG4 in vessels may facilitate prominent deposition of all 
subclasses of IgG, or IgG4 synergy may result in other secondary 
autoantibodies to induce inflammation.16 19 Further researches are 
needed to elucidate the mechanism of antibody-complement activation in IgG4-RD.
The patient received surgery for colorectal cancer before he 
developed IgG4-RD. Interestingly, a recent retrospective study, 
showing that a history of malignancy is 2.5 times more likely in 
patients with IgG4-RD than in general population, has suggested 
that malignant neoplasm may be a predisposing factor to IgG4-RD 
but not vice versa.20
Thus, we emphasise the heterogeneity of IgG4-RD and wish to 
raise the awareness of IgG4-RD on encountering various arrays 
of clinical manifestations. Careful multidisciplinary correlations 
among clinical, pathological and often radiological findings are 
crucial for reaching the correct diagnosis, particularly when the 
initial presentations are non-specific, as seen in this particular case.
Learning points
► IgG4-RD can present with skin rash, eosinophilia and high 
IgE, mimicking allergy.
► A diagnosis of IgG4-RD depends on a high index of clinical 
suspicion supported by pathological and radiological 
evidence.
► IgG4-RD is rarely associated with autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia; glucocorticoid is effective for both diseases in 
combination.
