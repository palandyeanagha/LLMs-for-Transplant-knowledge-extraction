Introduction
Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas, in which development of fibrosis and loss of pancreatic
parenchyma may lead to impaired endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. Chronic pancreatitis is most frequently caused
by alcohol and smoking, with idiopathic, genetic predisposition
and autoimmunity as less frequent causes [1–3].
Pain is the most frequent and dominant symptom and has a
highly variable clinical presentation, differing in chronicity and
severity [4]. Pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis is mulSuccess of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and ERCP in

ABSTRACT
Background and study aims Pain is the most frequent
and dominant symptom of chronic pancreatitis. Currently,
these patients are treated using a step-up approach, including analgesics and lifestyle adjustments, endoscopic, and
eventually surgical treatment. Extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy (ESWL) is indicated after failure of the first step
in patients with symptomatic intraductal stones larger
than 5 mm in the head or body of the pancreas. To assess
the complete ductal clearance rate and pain relief after
ESWL in patients with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis
with pancreatic duct stones, a systematic review and
meta-analysis was performed.
Patients and methods A systematic literature search
from January 2000 to December 2018 was performed in
PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for studies on
ductal clearance rate of ESWL in patients with symptomatic
chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic duct stones.
Results After screening 486 studies, 22 studies with 3868
patients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing ESWL for
pancreatic duct stones were included. The pooled proportion of patients with complete ductal clearance was 69.8 %
(95% CI 63.8–75.5). The pooled proportion of complete absence of pain during follow-up was 64.2 % (95 % CI 57.5–
70.6). Complete stone fragmentation was 86.3 % (95 % CI
76.0–94.0). Post-procedural pancreatitis and cholangitis
occurred in 4.0 % (95 % CI 2.5–5.8) and 0.5% (95 % CI 0.2–
0.9), respectively.
Conclusion Treatment with ESWL results in complete ductal clearance rate in a majority of patients, resulting in absence of pain during follow up in over half of patients with
symptomatic chronic pancreatitis caused by obstructing
pancreatic duct stones.

tifactorial, but poorly understood. Intraductal stones and/or
strictures may lead to pancreatic ductal and pancreatic parenchymal hypertension, causing pain [5]. More recently, activation of intrapancreatic nociceptors, hypertrophy, and inflammation of intrapancreatic nerves and abnormal pain processing
in the central nervous system have also been implicated [6].
For management of pain in chronic pancreatitis, a step-wise
treatment is advocated, starting with lifestyle modifications,
analgesics, plus, in selected patients, endoscopic therapy and/
or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) [7–9] with surgical decompression of the pancreatic duct as a last step (Supplementary Fig. 1). Endoscopic therapy and/or ESWL is indicated in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis with an obstructed main pancreatic duct (PD) in the head/body of the
pancreas [8–10] (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary
Fig. 3, ▶Video 1, ▶Video 2). Hypothetically, (endoscopic) PD
drainage causes decompression of the duct, with a decrease in
intraductal pressure and subsequent relief of pain as a result.
For clearance of one or multiple radiopaque obstructive intraductal stones ≥ 5mm located in the head/body of the pancreas,
patients should be treated with ESWL, whereas endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is indicated for
stones that are radiolucent or smaller than 5mm. Use of endoscopic therapy after ESWL has to be restricted to patients with
PD strictures and no spontaneous clearance of the intraductal
stones after adequate fragmentation by ESWL [8, 11]. Clinical
response to endoscopic therapy and/or ESWL should be evaluated 6 to 8 weeks after the procedure. If insufficient, surgical
options have to be considered [9].
Recently, retrospective and prospective cohort studies have
been published evaluating the efficacy and safety of ESWL in
patients with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis. Therefore, the
aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of
ductal clearance and pain relief from ESWL in treatment of patients with chronic pancreatitis with obstructing PD stones.
Patients and methods
Study selection
PRISMA guidelines reporting on meta-analyses and systematic
reviews of observation studies were applied. A systematic literature search from January 2000 to December 2018 was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for studies on ductal clearance rate of ESWL in patients with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis with PD stones. Only full-text articles
written in English were considered eligible. Search terms used
were “lithotripsy,” “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy,”
“stones,” “pancreas,” and “chronic pancreatitis” restricted to title, abstract, and keywords. Independent reviewers (NvH and
JV) screened each title and abstract for eligibility. Duplicate references were excluded. Discrepancies were solved through
discussion and consensus, and in case of any doubt resolved
with the senior author (JvH). Next, the eligibility of full text articles was assessed similarly. References of included articles
were checked manually for studies that had not been identified
in the primary search. Inclusion criteria were consecutive series
of patients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing ESWL for
symptomatic PD stones, reporting of complete ductal clearance, and availability of a full article written in English. Exclusion criteria were studies with fewer than five patients and reviews, editorials, abstracts, letters, animal studies, or studies
in children. The cut-off for minimum cohort size was arbitrarily
chosen.
Video 1 A 50 year-old male patient with chronic calcifying
pancreatitis and continuous pain had previously undergone
ESWL with stone fragmentation. ERCP followed with pancreatic
sphincterotomy and fragmented stone extraction is shown with
a standard balloon catheter.
Video 2 A 60 year-old woman with chronic calcifying pancreatitis and continuous pain had previously undergone ESWL with
partial stone fragmentation. The patient had already a previous
pancreatic sphincterotomy and stone extraction was performed
with a basket catheter, introduced along the guidewire, in the
pancreatic duct. The catheter is flushed with saline during manipulation to facilitate fragment evacuation.

Data extraction
The following variables were extracted, when available: study
design, publication year, country of origin, number of patients
undergoing ESWL, stone size (mean), complete stone fragmentation rate, complete stone fragmentation rate after first session, complete ductal clearance, complete ductal clearance
after first session, number of session required for complete
ductal clearance (mean), complications, follow-up time, pain
relief, complete pain relief, partial pain relief, quality of life,
exocrine insufficiency, and endocrine insufficiency.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was complete ductal clearance rate.
Complete ductal clearance was defined as the ability to retrieve
at least 90 % of all pancreatic duct stones with ESWL, including
additional ERCP when applied. Secondary outcomes were patients being completely pain free after ESWL, complete ductal
clearance after the first ESWL session, stone fragmentation
rate, stone fragmentation rate after the first ESWL session,
post-procedural pancreatitis rate, post-procedural cholangitis
rate, and exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Stone fragmentation was defined as the rupture of stones by ESWL.
Methodological quality assessment
All included studies were assessed for quality using The Oxford
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence checklist. The Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies was used to evaluate any risk of bias [12]. Any
doubt regarding the methodological quality assessment was
discussed by two independent reviewers (NvH and JV).
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed variables were reported as means ± standard deviation (SD), non-normally distributed variables as medians and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical data were reported as proportions. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statistic (I2 value of ≥ 50 % represented significant heterogeneity) [13]. Considering the variability of
methods and populations in the included studies, a random effects model was used for analyses. Pooled proportions were calculated and presented as percentages with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Funnel plots of complete ductal clearance as
our primary outcome were created to identify possible publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding retrospective studies and by excluding all studies in which postESWL ERCP was not performed. Analyses were performed with
MedCalc version 18.5 (MedCalc Software).
Results
Study selection
The initial search contained 486 articles (Supplementary
Fig. 4). After removal of 109 duplicates, 377 studies remained
of which 342 were excluded based on title and abstract. After
full text review, 22 eligible articles with 3868 patients undergoing ESWL for pancreatic duct stones were included. Cross-reference did not reveal any studies missed with the initial search.
No studies were excluded as a result of inadequate methodological quality (Supplemental Table 1). An overview of study
characteristics can be found in ▶Table 1.
Complete ductal clearance
All studies reported on complete ductal clearance (▶Table 2).
Meta-analysis of pooled proportions revealed complete ductal
clearance in 69.8 % (95 % CI 63.8–75.5), as shown in ▶Fig. 1a.
However, the test for heterogeneity did reveal a P < 0.001 with
a corresponding I2 of 92.6 % (95 % CI 90.1 to 94.5). ▶Fig. 1b represents publication bias for complete ductal clearance. As only
two studies assessed complete ductal clearance after first ESWL
session [14, 15], pooled analysis was not performed. Reported
proportions of patients with complete ductal clearance after
the first ESWL session were 60.2 % [14] and 68 % [15].
Pain relief
Pain intensity was heterogeneously reported among the respective studies (▶Table 2). Pain intensity was measured using
the Visal Analogue Scale (VAS) in four studies [14, 16–18]. The
3-point Likert-Scale was used in three studies to define pain intensity [14, 19, 20]. The 4-grade Pain-Scale was used in two
studies as a measure of pain intensity [21, 22]. One of the authors [23] used the 5-point Likert-Scale to define pain intensity.
In another study [24], a combination of the Visual Analogue
Scale and the duration and frequency of the pain attacks was
used to define pain intensity. One author [25] used the number
of hospital admissions for pain during the follow-up period to
define pain intensity. The proportion of patients being completely pain free following ESWL was reported in 6 studies [16, 17,
19, 20, 23, 24], showing a pooled proportion of 64.2% (95 % CI
57.5–70.6) (▶Fig. 2). The test for heterogeneity revealed P =
0.014 with a corresponding I2 of 64.8% (95 % CI 15.3–85.4). As
the definition of partial pain relief was either highly heterogeneous or not defined amongst the respective studies, pooled
proportion analysis was not performed on this outcome.
Complete stone fragmentation
A total of 12 studies including 1531 patients assessed complete
stone fragmentation by ESWL [15, 18–20, 22, 24, 26–31]. The
pooled proportion of patients in whom complete stone fragmentation was achieved was 86.3 % (95 % CI 76.0–94.0) as
shown in ▶Fig. 3. As with complete ductal clearance, the studies showed a significant heterogeneity with P < 0.001 and corresponding I2 of 95.9 % (95 % CI 94.2–97.1). As only three studies assessed complete fragmentation rate after first ESWL session [18, 19, 32], pooled analysis was not performed regarding
this outcome.
Complications
Pancreatitis as a complication following either ESWL or additional ERCP was reported in 15 studies [14, 15, 18–20, 23, 25,
26, 28, 29, 31–35] (Supplementary Table 2). In two studies it
was unclear whether there was any overlap in patients with a
post-ESWL and a post-ERCP pancreatitis, therefore these studies were excluded from the pooled proportion analysis [21, 22].

The pooled proportion of pancreatitis was 4.0 % (95 % CI 2.5–
5.8) (Supplementary Fig. 5). The studies showed a significant
heterogeneity with P < 0.001 and corresponding I2 of 69.1%
(95% CI 47.5–81.9). A total of 16 studies reported on cholangitis as a complication [14, 15, 18–23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35].
The pooled proportion of cholangitis was 0.5 % (95 % CI 0.2–
0.9) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The studies did not show significant heterogeneity with a P-value of 0.055 and corresponding
I
2 of 39.1% (95% CI 0.0–66.4).
Exocrine deficiency
In total, 10 studies reported on exocrine function following
ESWL treatment [14, 17, 19–22, 24–26, 28] (▶Table 3). Four
studies measured exocrine function following ESWL using the
N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-para-aminobenzoic acid (BT-PABA) test
[21, 22, 26, 28]. Two studies used fecal elastase to define exocrine deficiency [14, 24]; one of them [14] only measured fecal
elastase-1 in case of self-reported diarrhea or steatorrhea. Fecal
chymotrypsin was used in two studies as a measure of exocrine
deficiency [24, 26]. Two studies [19, 24] used self-reported
steatorrhea as a measure for exocrine deficiency, whereas a
third study [17] combined this self-reported measure with the
amount of pancreatic enzymes required to relieve symptoms.
Another study [25] defined exocrine insufficiency as clinical
steatorrhea that improved with more than 1 month of treatment with pancreatic enzyme substitution. In the final study
[20], it was unknown how exocrine deficiency was defined.
Endocrine deficiency
In total, 10 studies reported on endocrine function following
ESWL treatment [14, 17, 19–22, 24–26, 28] (▶Table 3). One
study [26] reported on patients requiring antidiabetic treatment after ESWL. Another [25] reported on patients requiring
oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin for more than one month.
Two of the studies [19, 14] used self-reported diabetes as a
measure for endocrine deficiency. Three [17, 24, 28] measured
blood glucose, HbA1c, and the required dose of hypoglycemic
agents to define endocrine deficiency. Another study [24] further defined endocrine deficiency as a fasting blood glucose
level > 126mg/dL and an HbA1c > 6.0 %. One author [20] defined endocrine insufficiency as ‘patients with diabetes following ESWL, whereas two other authors [21, 22] additionally referred to the American Diabetes Association.
Quality of life
Quality of life was heterogeneously reported among the respective studies [14, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24], therefore, no pooled analysis could be performed for this outcome. Three of the studies used a scale ranging from 1–10 [17, 19, 20], whereas the
two others used a 1–5 scale [23] and a European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC-QLQ) questionnaire with a scale ranging from 0–100 [24], respectively. One
study [14] did not report a numeric score but a description of
daily activities obtained through telephonic interviews.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding all studies in
which post-ESWL ERCP was not performed (▶Table 1). A total
of 12 studies with 1284 (33.2 %) patients were included in the
sensitivity analysis. Complete ductal clearance was reached in
71.4% (95 % CI 61.3–80.5) patients undergoing ESWL with
ERCP. Complete pain relief was described in three of the 12
studies with 706 patients. The proportion of patients being
completely pain free at follow up after ESWL with ERCP was

Post-procedural pancreatitis was described in eight studies
with 374 patients and occurred in 3.8 % (95 % CI 1.8–6.6). Cholangitis was described in eight studies with 446 patients and occurred in 1.0 % (95 % CI 0.19–2.3). A second sensitivity analysis
was performed after excluding all retrospective studies (▶Table 1). A total of eight studies with 650 (17.1 %) patients were
included in the sensitivity analysis. Complete ductal clearance
was reached in 63.5 % (95 % CI 51.7–74.5) of the 636 patients
undergoing ESWL. Complete pain relief was described in four
of eight prospective studies with 314 patients. The proportion
of patients being completely pain free after ESWL was 62.5 %
(95% CI 48.9–75.1). Stone fragmentation rate was reported in
three of eight prospective studies with 285 patients. Complete
stone fragmentation rate was 92.7 % (95 % CI 58.1–97.5). Postprocedural pancreatitis was described in five studies with 418
patients and occurred in 3.1 % (95 % CI 1.7–5.0). Cholangitis
was described in six studies with 546 patients and occurred in
0.2% (95% CI 0.00–0.79).

Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis on ESWL for pancreatic duct stones in patients with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis reported a pooled complete ductal clearance of 70 %. Complete stone fragmentation was reached in 86 %, with 64 % being
completely pain free at follow-up. Post-procedural pancreatitis
and cholangitis occurred in 4.0 % and 0.5 %, respectively, with
no mortality reported. Sensitivity analysis only including prospective studies reported similar results, with improvement in
complete stone fragmentation rate (93 % versus 86 %).
Pain is the most frequent symptom in patients with chronic
pancreatitis. Currently, a step-up treatment approach is used,
including lifestyle modifications and analgesics, endoscopic,
and finally surgical treatment [7, 8]. Treatment goals include
pain management, management and prevention of complications (e. g. recurrent flares of cysts), and correction of pancreatic insufficiency.
Conventional endoscopy for the removal of obstructive PD
stones with sphincterotomy and basket or balloon extraction,
allows for stone extraction in a minority of patients. Conventional endoscopy is regularly limited by factors such as stone
size, stone location, and previous gastric surgery [29, 36]. In addition, stone extraction may not be possible if the stone is embedded in the ductal system or when strictures are present
[37]. Two retrospective studies reported a 9 % ductal clearance
rate after conventional endoscopy in 1041 patients with chronic pancreatitis [27, 29], whereas a survey of 125 hospitals reported a 14 % ductal clearance rate in 1834 patients with chronic pancreatitis [38].
As an alternative, initial stone fragmentation by ESWL was
introduced [23]. ESWL is indicated for patients with one or multiple radiopaque obstructive intraductal stones larger than 5
mm located in the head/body of the pancreas, whereas stones
that are radiolucent or smaller than 5mm should be treated
with ERCP only [8]. ESWL is contraindicated in patients with
non-correctable coagulation disorders, pregnancy, and presence in the shockwave path of bone, calcified vessels, or lung

tissue [8]. Specific precautions should be taken for patients
with implantable defibrillators and pacemakers [39].
A previous meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of ESWL
reported complete ductal clearance in 70.7 % of the pooled patients comparable to the current study, with complete pain relief in 53 % [10]. Post-procedural pancreatitis was reported in
4.2 %, whereas post-procedural cholangitis was not reported.
As almost 75 % (20/27) of the included studies was published
more than 10 years ago with almost 50 % (13/27) published before the year 2000, the current study provides an important update on the results of ESWL for PD stones.
Factors associated with more ESWL sessions required for
complete stone fragmentation are larger stones [40], multiple
stones [41] or stones associated with main pancreatic duct
strictures [24]. Multicenter surveys have suggested that stone
fragmentation is less frequently successful in low-volume centers, while the type of lithotripsy has been controversial
[29, 36,38]. Factors associated with successful ductal clearance
after ESWL are solitary stones [19, 21, 24, 42, 43], stones located in the pancreatic head [19], stones with lower density at
CT scan (< 820.5 HU) [21], pancreatic stenting prior to ESWL
[14, 44] and pre-ESWL administration of secretin [44].

Original article

Endoscopic therapy after ESWL should be restricted to patients with PD strictures or patients with no spontaneous stone
clearance after adequate fragmentation with ESWL [8]. The addition of endoscopic therapy to ESWL provided no additional
benefit in two studies. Only one randomized controlled trial
(RCT) has been published, which showed that combining systematic endoscopy with ESWL adds to the cost of patient care,
without improving the outcome of pancreatic pain [11]. This
systematic review found similar results.
Intraductal lithotripsy techniques, including laser lithotripsy
(LL) and electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), can be attempted
either after failure of ESWL or before in an experimental setting. Literature on these lithotripsy techniques in PD stones is
scarce, with only one systematic review published showing
complete ductal clearance in 43–100 % and adverse events in
0 % to 13.5 % [45]. Large, prospective studies are needed to
prove efficiency and safety of these techniques and to compare
outcomes with ESWL.
In case of technical or clinical failure of endoscopic therapy,
surgical options should be considered [8]. Especially in earlystage chronic pancreatitis, physicians differ in the application
of surgical treatment [46]. Currently, multiple RCTs have been
published comparing endoscopy with surgery in late-stage
chronic pancreatitis. Two recent RCTs on endoscopy versus surgery in late-stage chronic pancreatitis suggested that for pain
relief, surgery was superior to endoscopic therapy [47, 48].
The results of both trials, however, should be interpreted with
caution. In the first trial [47], pain relief was reached in 15 %
versus 34 % treated with endoscopy versus surgery, respectively, showing that neither of these treatment options was entirely
satisfactory. The applied endoscopic therapy was suboptimal,
as neither ESWL nor cumulative stenting were used. In addition,
different surgical procedures were performed [47]. In the second trial, only 39 patients were included; all of them had advanced chronic pancreatitis and most were opioid-dependent
[48]. In both trials, only patients with late-stage chronic pancreatitis were included, and therefore the results of the trials
cannot been extrapolated to all patients with chronic pancreatitis, especially not to patients with early-stage chronic pancreatitis.
Therefore, the timing of surgical intervention remains matter of debate [49]. Whether early surgery for chronic pancreatitis improves pain control and pancreatic function compared
with the current step-up practice should be evaluated in a large
multicenter RCT and validated afterwards. A recently published
multicenter RCT showed that early surgery compared with an
endoscopy-first approach resulted in lower pain scores when
integrated over 18 months. In addition, the total number of interventions was lower in the early surgery group (median, 1 vs
3; P < .001), altough complications, mortality, pancreatic function and quality of life were comparable [50]. However, further
research is needed to assess persistence of differences over
time and to replicate the study findings. Despite these results,
early surgery strategy may not be easily generalized as most patients and their refering physicians would prefer a non-invasive
procedure as first step management.
This study has several limitations. First, each of the included
studies were observational with several retrospective studies,
potentially leading to selection bias. Furthermore, multiple outcomes were heterogeneously defined among the included
studies. For example, meta-analysis on complete ductal clearance revealed an I2 of 92.6 %. Variation between studies regarding this outcome might be caused by heterogeneity in study
protocol, for example, rather than by chance alone. Therefore,
the results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, due to heterogeneity, improvement in quality of life and in endocrine and exocrine insufficiency could not
be quantified. In addition, there was a lack of objective means
of determining ‘complete ductal clearance’ and ‘complete
stone fragmentation’, which explains the significant heterogeneity (I2 > 90 %) among the studies. Furthermore, no consensus
existed amongst the studies in the grading of gastrointestinal
procedure-related complications. As a result, we chose to only
report post-procedural pancreatitis and cholangitis. Furthermore, studies were performed in different countries with different patient demographics, various etiologies for chronic pancreatitis and stone formation. Baseline characteristics were not
available for all the included studies, and therefore no comparison could be performed. Finally, indications of endoscopic
therapy following ESWL were not clearly described in multiple
studies. The strength of this study is the extensive, detailed
overview of the effects of ESWL for PD stones regarding multiple outcomes and of the heterogeneity that exists in current literature.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis suggests that treatment with ESWL results
in complete ductal clearance in 70 % of patients, resulting in absence of pain in over half of patients with symptomatic chronic
pancreatitis caused by obstructing pancreatic duct stones.
Therefore, ESWL should still be adhered to as a first alternative
to conventional endoscopic techniques as long as there are no
convincing data about EHL or laser lithotripsy. The available literature, however, is heterogeneous and therefore pragmatic
multicenter RCTs in experienced centers are required. In addition, the application of LL and EHL as alternative techniques
should be further explored in larger, prospective studies.
