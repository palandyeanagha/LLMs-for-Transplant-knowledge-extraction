Abstract
Introduction: Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement with bedside ultrasound has been shown in
many studies to accurately detect high intracranial pressure (ICP). The accuracy of point-in-time ONSD
measurement in the presence of ongoing fluctuation of ICP between high and normal is not known. Recent
laboratory investigation suggests that reversal of optic nerve sheath distension may be impaired following bouts of
intracranial hypertension. Our objective was to compare the accuracy of ONSD measurement in the setting of
fluctuating versus stable ICP.
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of data from prospective study comparing ONSD to invasive ICP. Patients
with invasive ICP monitors in the ICU underwent ONSD measurement with simultaneous blinded recording of ICP
from the invasive monitor. Three measurements were made in each eye. Significant acute ICP fluctuation (SAIF) was
defined in two different ways; as the presence of ICP both above and below 20 mmHg within a cluster of six
measurements (Definition 1) and as a magnitude of fluctuation >10 mmHg within the cluster (Definition 2). The
accuracy of point-in-time ONSD measurements for the detection of concurrent ICP >20 mmHg within clusters
fulfilling a specific definition of SAIF was compared to the accuracy of ONSD measurements within clusters not
fulfilling the particular definition by comparison of independent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
Results: A total of 613 concurrent ONSD-ICP measurements in 109 clusters were made in 73 patients. Twentythree (21%) clusters fulfilled SAIF Definition 1 and 17 (16%) SAIF Definition 2. For Definition 1, the difference in the
area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curves for groups with and without fluctuation was 0.10 (P = 0.0001). There
was a fall in the specificity from 98% (95% CI 96 to 99%) to 74% (63 to 83%) and in the positive predictive value
from 89% (80 to 95%) to 76% (66 to 84%) with fluctuation. For Definition 2, also, there was a significant difference
between the AUC of ROC curves of groups with fluctuation-magnitude >10 mmHg and those with fluctuationmagnitude 5 to 10 mmHg (0.06, P = 0.04) as well as <5 mmHg (0.07, P = 0.01).
Conclusions: Specificity and PPV of ONSD for ICP >20 mmHg are substantially decreased in patients
demonstrating acute fluctuation of ICP between high and normal. This may be because of delayed reversal of
nerve sheath distension.

Introduction
Several clinical studies have now demonstrated that
measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD)
using optic nerve ultrasound (ONUS) may be an accurate and non-invasive bedside tool for the detection of
raised intracranial pressure (ICP), typically defined as
being >20 or >25 mmHg, when compared to the gold
standard of invasive ICP monitoring using intraparenchymal and intraventricular catheters [1-9]. The optic
nerve sheath (ONS) is a continuation of the dura, and a
significant increase in ICP is transmitted through the
subarachnoid space to the ONS as well as the optic
nerve head. The eventual distension of the optic nerve
head as a result of the transmitted pressure results in
papilledema. Papilledema, however, is not a sensitive
marker of raised ICP and can take several days to
develop [10]. In vitro studies suggest that the retrobulbar ONS, on the other hand, may undergo sonographically detectable distension seconds after the
development of intracranial hypertension [11,12].
While several studies in the literature have compared
the accuracy of ONSD measurement to invasive ICP
measurement, there are several unresolved issues that
likely need to be addressed before this technique can
find more widespread clinical acceptance and use. It
may be particularly important to understand the conditions under which ONUS may provide misleading
results. The optimal ONSD cut-off for the detection of
ICP >20 to 25 mmHg, the confounding effect of retrobulbar hypoechoic artifact, inter-observer variability and
the applicability to specific clinical situations are all a
matter of debate. Another important and unanswered
question is whether ONUS remains accurate in the setting of acutely fluctuating ICP. Since acute fluctuations
in ICP between high and normal are common in
patients with acute brain injury, particularly in patients
with ongoing treatment measures, (such as cerebrospinal
fluid removal and the administration of Mannitol), the
accuracy of point-in-time ONSD measurement for the
detection of true point-in-time intracranial hypertension
when ICP ranges between high and low within a short
time interval is an issue of significant clinical relevance.
The accuracy of ONSD measurement under these circumstances would be heavily dependent on the in vivo
ability of the ONS to, first, distend immediately following an increase in ICP and then rapidly reverse distension after the ICP drops to normal levels. This issue has
not so far been addressed in any published clinical studies. More recently, in vitro studies using ONS models
have suggested that the ONS may remain distended for
a significant period of time following a simulation of
raised ICP in the subarachnoid space, even after the
reduction of applied pressure to the “normal” range of
ICP [13]. While this persistence of ONS distension was
primarily observed following elevation of simulated ICP
to very high levels (>45 to 55 mmHg) [13], the impact
of a possible lag in reversal of ONS distension on the
clinical diagnostic accuracy of ONUS is not known.
The recently published ONUS ICP (Optic Nerve
Ultrasound for the Detection of Raised Intracranial Pressure) trial was a prospective blinded single-center study
conducted at our institution to determine the accuracy
of ONSD measurement for the detection of intracranial
hypertension in a heterogeneous neuro-ICU population
[7]. We conducted post hoc analysis of data obtained
from this study, to compare the accuracy of ONSD measurement in the setting of stable ICP during the period
of evaluation versus in the setting of significant acute
ICP fluctuation (SAIF).
Materials and methods
Approval was obtained from the institutional review
board of the University of Michigan (HUM00038460)
for the retrospective analysis of data from the database
of the ONUS ICP study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients admitted to the neurointensive care unit
between November 2008 and May 2011 who had an
external ventricular drain (EVD) or intraparenchymal
ICP monitor in place and were judged by the treating
clinician to be at risk for the development of raised
intracranial pressure were enrolled in the ONUS ICP
study. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, known
orbital injury and pre-existing optic nerve pathology.
Enrollment in ONUS ICP was based on informed consent and investigator availability.
ONSD and invasive ICP measurement protocol
Blinded ONSD measurements paired with simultaneous
measurement of intracranial pressure via invasive monitoring were performed at enrollment and intermittently
during the course of the patients’ stay in the ICU, based
on investigator availability. Most ONSD measurements
were performed by a single investigator with three years’
experience performing ONUS in a clinical setting (VR),
some were performed by a second investigator with two
months’ experience performing ONUS (JF). The sonographer was blinded to the simultaneous invasive ICP
measurement. The bedside monitor was turned away
from the sonographer and toward the bedside nurse
who recorded the invasive ICP while the ONSD measurement was being performed. The sonographer was,
however, not blinded to the patient’s diagnosis or clinical history. All EVDs were transduced to the monitor
for the duration of each ONSD measurement.

During each evaluation with ONUS, (referred to henceforth as a “measurement cluster”), at least three measurements were attempted from each eye. While each
individual ONSD measurement within the measurement
cluster was being performed, the minimum and maximum ICP observed on the monitor during the course of
the individual measurement was recorded by the bedside
nurse and the mean of these two numbers was taken as
the corresponding individual invasive ICP measurement.
The total time taken to obtain each measurement cluster, that is, six attempted individual measurements, was
recorded. Means of the six attempted individual ONSD
measurements and of the six attempted individual invasive measurements in each cluster were also recorded;
however, individual ONSD measurements were directly
correlated to the corresponding individual invasive ICP
measurements for assessment of accuracy of ONUS.
The use of each of these individual measurements as
individual data points for comparison was specifically
performed since the primary purpose of this study was
to assess the ability of ONSD to change rapidly in reaction to rapidly changing ICP. The presence of widely
varying ICP measurements within the cluster of six
measurements performed over a significant duration of
time means that the most valid comparison to assess
the ability of ONSD to keep up with changing ICP was
between individual ONSD and ICP measurements
within clusters; the mean of the six ONSD measurements would not accurately reflect the ability of a pointin-time ONSD measurement to identify point-in-time
intracranial hypertension. Sample clusters are shown in
Table 1 (Additional file 1).
All ONUS scans were performed using a point-of-care
Sonosite™ M-Turbo (SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA)
ultrasound machine with a 13-6 MHz linear-array probe
and a high resolution optimization setting. The probe
was placed on the superior and lateral aspect of the
orbit against the upper eyelid with the eye closed and
angled slightly caudally and medially until the optic
nerve was visualized as a linear hypoechoic structure
with clearly defined margins posterior to the globe. The
probe was always placed gently on the closed eyelid and
never in direct contact with the cornea or sclera, to
avoid corneal abrasions. Contact with the eye was gentle
at all times. Probes and settings specifically approved by
the FDA for ocular imaging are recommended. All
images were obtained in a transverse/axial plane for uniformity. The ONSD was measured 3 mm behind the
retina. In our experience, a major source of error during
ONSD measurement is the linear hypoechoic artifact
frequently seen posterior to the globe that might be
confused with, or partially overlapping, the actual optic
nerve sheath. Emphasis was placed on using careful
angulation of the transducer during real-time imaging to
clearly demarcate the margins of the optic nerve sheath
distinct from linear hypoechoic artifact. Images were
reviewed off-line while still blinded and the image discarded if the margins of the optic nerve sheath were not
sharply defined, there was suspicion of overlap with
hypoechoic artifact, or the image was otherwise suboptimal.
All EVDs were Bactiseal™ (Codman & Shurtleff Inc.,
Raynham, MA, USA) antimicrobial coated external ventricular drainage catheters; intraparenchymal probes
were Codman™ MicroSensor (Codman & Shurtleff Inc.)
probes.
Definitions of SAIF and study groups
We defined significant acute ICP fluctuation (SAIF) in
two different ways. In SAIF Definition 1, an ONSD measurement was considered to have been performed in the
setting of SAIF when it was part of a measurement cluster in which individual invasive ICP measurements both
above and below 20 mmHg were recorded among the
six attempted measurements. The purpose of this definition was to capture fluctuation between “high” and “normal” within the period of measurement. To confirm that
this definition did in fact result in two groups of measurements performed in settings with significant differences in the magnitude of ICP fluctuation (that is, to
account for situations in which the ICP may have simply
fluctuated in a narrow range around 20 mmHg), we
compared the median magnitudes of ICP fluctuation
(defined as highest minus the lowest recorded individual
invasive ICP measurement within each cluster of measurements) in the two groups and analyzed for a statistically significant difference. Individual ONSD
measurements were divided into two groups. ONSD
Group 1 consisted of all individual ONSD measurements within those ONSD measurement clusters that
fulfilled Definition 1 of SAIF, while ONSD Group 2 consisted of all individual ONSD measurements from those
ONSD measurement clusters that did not fulfill the definition. The overall accuracy of each individual ONSD
measurement for the detection of corresponding invasive ICP measurement >20 mmHg was compared
between Groups 1 and 2 by comparing the results of
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
performed for each group.
In SAIF Definition 2, an ONSD measurement was
considered to have been performed in the setting of
SAIF when it was part of a measurement cluster in
which the magnitude of ICP fluctuation (defined, as stated earlier, as the highest minus the lowest recorded
individual invasive ICP measurement within each cluster
of measurements) was >10 mmHg. This definition,
therefore, focused on the magnitude of fluctuation over
the presence of both high and “normal” within a short

period of time. We compared the accuracy of ONSD
measurement for the detection of corresponding ICP
>20 mmHg between the group of ONSD measurements
fulfilling SAIF Definition 2 (Group 1) to the accuracy
ONSD measurements performed within clusters in
which the magnitude of ICP fluctuation was <5 mmHg
(Group 2) and 5 to 10 mmHg (Group 3). This again
was done through comparison of the results of ROC
curve analysis performed for each group.
Samples of measurement clusters with and without
fluctuation per SAIF Definitions 1 and 2 are shown in
Table 1 (Additional file 1).
Effect of ICP spikes and fluctuation within a four-hour
period prior to the measurements
In addition to the primary analysis of the effect of SAIF
on the accuracy of ONSD measurement, we also studied
the effect of spikes in ICP, as well as ICP fluctuation,
over a longer (several hours) period prior to study measurements on the accuracy of ONSD measurement. We
reviewed the ICP recordings in the patients’ medical
records for a four-hour period preceding concurrent
ONSD and invasive ICP measurement. All ICP spikes to
>30 mmHg that persisted for at least five minutes, the
lowest ICP in this period and the highest ICP in this
period were recorded. The accuracy of ONSD measurements performed within four hours of an ICP elevations
to >30 mmHg was compared to the accuracy of ONSD
measurements without any preceding spike using independent ROC curves. We separately looked at the range
of ICP measurements (highest-lowest recorded ICP)
within a four-hour period preceding ONSD measurements. The accuracy of ONSD measurements performed
with preceding four-hour ICP ranges of <10 mmHg and
>10 mmHg was then compared.
Statistical analysis
The D’Agostino Pearson test was used to determine if a
variable (such as age and time taken to complete concurrent ONSD and ICP measurements) demonstrated
normal distribution. Mean with standard deviation and
range was calculated for variables with normal distribution and median with interquartile range (IQR) calculated for variables with non-normal distribution. An
ROC curve was constructed for each designated group
of ONSD measurements, as well the population as a
whole, for the ability of ONSD to detect ICP >20
mmHg. The AUC for each ROC curve with 95% CI and
standard error (SE) was determined, along with the Pvalue of the AUC being 0.5. We constructed ROC
curves for ONSD measurements within clusters fulfilling
SAIF Definition 1 (Group 1- ICP both above and under
20 mmHg in the same cluster) and compared the AUC
for this ROC curve with the AUC of the ROC curve for
all ONSD measurements within clusters not fulfilling
SAIF Definition 1 (Group 2) for a statistically significant
difference (P <0.05). We then constructed an ROC
curve for ONSD measurements within clusters fulfilling
SAIF Definition 2 (Group 1) and compared the AUC for
this ROC curve with the AUC of the ROC curve for all
ONSD measurements within clusters with magnitude <5
mmHg (Group 2) and separately for 5 to 10 mmHg
(Group 3). A similar analysis was then performed for
designated groups of ONSD measurements for the analysis of accuracy in the setting of ICP spikes and fluctuation in the four-hour period preceding the ONSD
measurement.
The optimal ONSD cut-off to detect ICP >20 mmHg
was determined from each ROC curve. We then calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of each cutoff, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), for the
detection of ICP >20 mmHg by invasive monitoring. P
<0.05 was also used as the threshold for statistical significance for all the other statistical calculation performed.
Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc for
Windows, version 11.6.0.0 (MedCalc software, Mariakerke, Belgium).
Results
A total of 613 ONSD measurements (in 109 measurement clusters) performed in 73 patients from the ONUS
ICP database were included in the analysis. This
included 65 patients enrolled in the original ONUS ICP
clinical trial [7] and 8 patients who were subsequently
prospectively enrolled into the ONUS ICP database following publication of the original study. Overall, 660
measurements were initially performed, of which 47
were discarded following off-line analysis while still
blinded, leaving 613 measurements for inclusion in the
study. Mean age of the population was 53 + 15 years
(range 18 to 90 years). There were 46 women (63%) and
27 men (37%). VR performed 598 (97%) of the measurements while JF performed 18 (3%) of the measurements.
The median time taken to complete each cluster of
ONSD measurements was 10 minutes (IQR 7 to 14
minutes). Invasive ICP >45 mmHg was seen in one
measurement cluster with SAIF and in two measurement clusters without SAIF.
Diagnostic accuracy of ONSD when acute ICP fluctuation
present: Definition 1
Overall, 23/109 (21%) measurement clusters had SAIF
per Definition 1. There were 158 ONSD measurements
in Group 1 (SAIF Definition 1 present) and 455 measurements in Group 2 (SAIF Definition 1 absent). There
was a significant difference (P <0.0001) in the median
magnitude of ICP fluctuation (highest to lowest invasive

ICP within each group of six measurements) between
ONSD measurement clusters in Group 1 (12 mmHg,
IQR 8 to 19 mmHg) and Group 2 (3 mmHg, IQR 1 to 5
mmHg). Of note, there was a significant difference in
the median time taken to complete each measurement
cluster between Group 1 (14 minutes, IQR 8 to 19 minutes) and Group 2 (8 minutes, IQR 6 to 11 minutes), P
= 0.0024.
ROC analysis in Group 1, depicted in Table 2 (Additional file 2) and Figure 1a, revealed AUC = 0.89 (0.83
to 0.94, SE 0.026), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001. Optimal
ONSD for detection of ICP >20 mmHg was >0.48 cm.
Sensitivity was 94% (95% CI 87 to 98%), Specificity was
74% (63 to 83%), PPV 76% (66 to 84%) and NPV 94%
(85 to 98%). In Group 2, depicted in Table 2 (Additional
file 2) and Figure 1b, AUC was 0.99 (0.98 to 1.00, SE
0.0026), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001, optimal ONSD was
>0.48 cm. Sensitivity was 96% (89 to 99%). Specificity
was 98% (96 to 99%), PPV 89% (80 to 95%) and NPV
99% (98 to 100%).
The difference between AUCs of the ROC curves constructed for Groups 1 and 2 was 0.10 (P = 0.0001).
Diagnostic accuracy of ONSD when acute ICP fluctuation
present: Definition 2
Seventeen of 109 (16%) measurement clusters had SAIF
per Definition 2. There were 119 ONSD measurements
within clusters with a magnitude of ICP fluctuation >10
mmHg (Group 1, SAIF Definition 2 fulfilled), 142 measurements within clusters with a magnitude of fluctuation 5 to 10 mmHg (Group 2, SAIF Definition 2 not
fulfilled) and 352 measurements within clusters with a
magnitude of fluctuation <5 mmHg (Group 3, SAIF
Definition 2 not fulfilled). There was a significant difference (P <0.0001) in the proportion of clusters with
recorded individual invasive ICPs both above and below
20 mmHg within the cluster between clusters fulfilling
Definition 2 (13/17, 76%) and clusters that did not fulfill
Definition 2 (10/92, 11%).
For Definition 2, ROC analysis in Group 1 (Magnitude
of fluctuation >10 mmHg), depicted in Table 2 (Additional file 2) and Figure 2a, revealed AUC = 0.92 (0.85
to .96, SE 0.027), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001. Optimal
ONSD for detection of ICP >20 mmHg was >0.50 cm.
Sensitivity was 87% (75 to 95%). Specificity was 89% (79
to 96%), PPV was 87% (75 to 95%) and NPV 89% (79 to
96%). When using a >0.48 cm cut-off, Sensitivity was
91% (80 to 97%), Specificity was 83% (72 to 91%), PPV
was 82% (70 to 91%) and NPV was 92% (81 to 97%). In
Group 2 (Magnitude of fluctuation 5 to 10 mmHg),
depicted in Table 2 (Additional file 2) and Figure 2b,
AUC was 0.98 (0.94 to 1.00, SE 0.01), P (AUC = 0.5)
<0.0001 and optimal ONSD >0.48 cm. Sensitivity was
98% (88 to 100%), Specificity was 93% (86 to 97%), PPV
86% (73 to 94%) and NPV 99% (94 to 100%). In Group
3 (Magnitude of fluctuation <5 mmHg), depicted in
Table 2 (Additional file 2) and Figure 2c, AUC was 0.99
(0.98 to 1.00, SE 0.004), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001 and
optimal ONSD >0.48 cm. Sensitivity was 98% (89 to
100%), Specificity was 96% (93 to 98%), PPV was 79%
(67 to 88%) and NPV 100% (98 to 100%). The differences between AUCs of the ROC curves of Groups 1
and 3 (difference = 0.07, P = 0.01) and Groups 1 and 2
(difference = 0.06, P = 0.04) attained statistical

clusters in which acute fluctuation was present as per SAIF Definition 1, while the ROC curve in figure 1B represents measurements within
clusters which did not fulfill SAIF Definition 1.

significance while the difference between the AUCs of
the ROC curves of the two groups that did not fulfill
Definition 2, Groups 2 and 3, did not (0.01, P = 0.35).
Effect of ICP spikes prior to measurement
Overall, 14 of 109 (13%) measurement clusters were
performed within four hours of an ICP spike to >30
mmHg. Analysis of the ROC curve for the measurements within these clusters revealed AUC = 0.97 (0.90
to 1.00, SE = 0.02), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001. Optimal
ONSD for detection of ICP >20 mmHg was >0.49 cm,
Sensitivity was 96% (86 to 100%), Specificity was 93%
(77 to 99%), PPV was 96% (86 to 100%) and NPV was
93% (77 to 99%). Overall 95 of 109 (87%) measurement
clusters did not have an ICP spike to >30 mmHg in the
four-hour period preceding measurement. Analysis of
the ROC curve for these measurements revealed AUC =
0.97 (0.95 to 0.98, SE = 0.009), P (AUC = 0.5) <0.0001.
Optimal ONSD for detection of ICP >20 mmHg was
>0.48 cm, Sensitivity was 95% (88 to 98%), Specificity
was 94% (91 to 96%), PPV was 77% (68 to 84%) and
NPV 99% (97 to 100%). There was no difference
between the AUCs of the ROC curves of these two
curves, suggesting that the presence of ICP spike to >30
mmHg in a four-hour period prior to measurement did
not substantially impact accuracy.
Effect of four-hour ICP fluctuation
The magnitude of ICP fluctuation seen during a fourhour period prior to measurement was >10 mmHg for
314 measurements, performed in 51 of 109 (47%) measurement clusters. The ROC curve for these measurements revealed AUC = 0.95 (0.92 to 0.97, SE = 0.01), P
(AUC = 0 5) <0.0001. Optimal ONSD for detection of
ICP >20 mmHg was >0.47 cm, Sensitivity was 95% (90
to 98%), Specificity was 87% (81 to 92%), PPV was 85%
(78 to 90%) and NPV was 96% (91 to 98%). The
magnitude of ICP fluctuation seen during a four-hour
period prior to measurement was <10 mmHg for 299
measurements, performed in 58 of 109 (53%) measurement clusters. The ROC curve for these measurements
revealed AUC = 1.00 (0.98 to 1.00, SE = 0.002), P (AUC
= 0.5) <0.0001. Optimal ONSD for detection of ICP >20
mmHg was >0.48 cm, Sensitivity was 100% (75 to
100%), Specificity was 99% (98 to 100%), PPV was 87%
(58 to 99%) and NPV was 100% (99 to 100%). The difference between the AUCs of the ROC curves for the
>10 mmHg fluctuation group and the <10 mmHg fluctuation group was 0.05 and attained statistical significance (P = 0.0002). The ability to compare these two
groups/ROCs was limited by the fact that very few clusters (only 3 of 58) with a <10 mmHg magnitude of ICP
fluctuation contained individual ICP measurements >20
mmHg. There were no recorded ICP measurements >20
mmHg following a four-hour magnitude of ICP fluctuations <5 mmHg.
Diagnostic accuracy: all measurements
For the population of all ONSD measurements, ROC
analysis (Additional file 2: Table 2 and Figure 3)
revealed AUC = 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, SE 0.007), P
(AUC = 0.5) <0.0001. Optimal ONSD for detection of
ICP >20 mmHg was >0.48 cm, Sensitivity was 95% (90
to 98%), Specificity was 93% (91 to 96%), PPV was 82%
(75 to 87%) and NPV was 98% (97 to 99%).
Illustrative case description: delayed reversal of ONS
distension
Figures 4, 5 and 6 depict serial ONUS examinations in a
patient (not included in the ONUS ICP study) in whom
diminished accuracy of ONSD was seen immediately
following treatment. A 66-year-old man developed
hemorrhage along the EVD following elective resection
of a cerebellar mass. He subsequently demonstrated

clusters in which ICP fluctuation>10mmHg was present. Figure 2B represents the ROC for measurements within clusters in which ICP fluctuation
was 5-10mmHg. Figure 2C represents the ROC of measurements within clusters in which ICP fluctuation was <5mmHg.

neurological improvement and the EVD was removed
after several days. Two days later he became poorly
responsive on the general ward, requiring transfer to the
ICU and endotracheal intubation for airway protection.
CT revealed only mild temporal horn enlargement and
ONUS was performed to non-invasively assess for the
presence of intracranial hypertension. This revealed an
ONSD of 0.55 cm (Figure 4), suggestive of significant
intracranial hypertension. An EVD was then placed at
the bedside with very high opening pressure (ICP >50
mmHg). Twenty minutes after EVD placement with
continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage, ONUS was
repeated, revealing an ONSD of 0.53 cm (Figure 5),
again suggestive of raised ICP, despite the measured ICP
being only 10 mmHg at this time. When the procedure
was repeated four hours later, the ONSD had fallen to
0.40 cm (Figure 6), suggestive of resolution of intracranial hypertension, with the corresponding ICP being 13
mmHg.
Discussion
The use of ONSD measurement using point-of-care
ultrasound for the detection of raised ICP has generated
considerable interest, with several studies suggesting a
good correlation with the gold standard of invasive ICP
monitoring [1-9]. Our study, which includes the largest
group of patients (excluding normal controls) in a single
study of ONSD to date in the literature, addresses an
important potential limitation of ONUS: a possible
reduction in diagnostic accuracy in the presence of
SAIF. Acute and ongoing ICP fluctuation was seen in
about a fifth (16 to 21% depending on the definition
used) of all ONUS evaluations in our study, suggesting
that this is a fairly common phenomenon and that a
decrease in accuracy of the technique in this setting
may, in fact, have clinical impact. The fact that 21% of
clusters had ICP readings both >20 mmHg and <20
mmHg, and the median 12 mmHg magnitude of ICP
fluctuation seen within these clusters, performed over a
median duration of 14 minutes, confirms the necessity
for the use of individual point-in-time ONSD measurements within clusters as individual data points for comparison with the corresponding individual point-in-time
invasive ICP measurements.
In our study, point-in-time ONSD measurement was
less accurate for the identification of point-in-time ICP
elevation (>20 mmHg) when acute fluctuation was present using two different definitions of SAIF. When the
ONSD cut-off for detection of ICP >20 mmHg was kept
consistent at >0.48 cm, there was, predominantly, a substantial reduction in the specificity (98% to 74%) and
PPV (89% to 76%) when using SAIF Definition 1 (which
identified fluctuation between high and “normal” ICP)
and a reduction primarily in specificity (96% with a
magnitude of fluctuation <5 mmHg to 83% with magnitude of fluctuation >10 mmHg) when using SAIF Definition 2 (which identified a greater absolute magnitude
of ICP fluctuation). The implication of this finding is
that an ONS that appears to be distended may be less
likely to represent a true ICP elevation (decreased PPV)
or that fewer true-normal ICPs are correctly identified
(decreased specificity) when the ICP is acutely fluctuating. The fact that an apparently distended ONS on
sonography is less likely to correlate with high ICP as in
the setting of acute fluctuation does raise the possibility
that a delay in reversibility of ONS distension may be at
least partly responsible. This may be particularly problematic when using ONUS to assess the early response to
treatment, as illustrated in the patient described (Figures
4, 5, 6), in which the ONSD continued to suggest significantly elevated ICP even after the ICP had reverted
from >50 mmHg to normal with treatment. Of note,
while the in vitro study of Hansen et al. detected a
delay in reversibility of ONS distension only after ICP
elevation to >45 mmHg [13], we found a diminished
accuracy of ONSD measurement in the setting of SAIF
despite the presence of very few recorded ICP readings
>45 mmHg, in clusters with and without SAIF. In addition, the presence of an ICP spike to >30 mmHg in a
four-hour period prior to measurement did not diminish
the accuracy of ONSD measurement in our study, while
fluctuation between high and normal during the period
of measurement (SAIF Definition 1) clearly did. This
may suggest that ICP spikes more remote from the time

of ICP >20 mmHg- all measurements.

of measurement may be less consequential to accuracy
than transient spikes occurring more proximate to, or
particularly during, the period of measurement. It is also
possible that the decreased accuracy of ONUS in the
setting of fluctuation may have primarily been from factors other than a delay in reversibility of ONS distension. In our study, measurement clusters with SAIF took
significantly longer to complete than clusters without.
This may reflect greater technical difficulty with clearly
defining the margins of the ONS on greyscale imaging
when ICP and, therefore, the ONSD are actively changing, which may thereby result in diminished accuracy
in the presence of SAIF. Our analysis of the effect of
ICP fluctuation in a four-hour period prior to measurement did suggest diminished accuracy when the fourhour range of fluctuation was >10 mmHg; however, our
ability to perform an accurate statistical analysis of the
effect of a greater preceding time period of fluctuation
was limited by the fact that ICP elevations to >20
mmHg were quite uncommon when the four-hour
range of ICP fluctuation was <10 mmHg.
When using ONUS to assess for the presence of high
ICP immediately after treatment, or in other situations
where SAIF is likely, performing serial measurements
may be useful, especially since ONS distension will
almost certainly reverse over time (assuming this is an
important cause of the diminished accuracy with fluctuation). It must also be noted that in most clinical
situations where there is a high suspicion for the presence of acute intracranial hypertension requiring treatment, an invasive ICP monitor is likely to be placed.
Most importantly, however, similar to any other imaging

days after removal of an EVD. Scan performed prior to placement of new EVD. The ocular globe is the hypoechoic structure in the upper part
of the images and the ONS the linear hypoechoic structure behind the globe. Caliper A identifies a point 3 mm behind the retina while Caliper

or diagnostic modality used in the ICU, the ONSD must
never be used in isolation to make clinical decisions and
must always be used in conjunction with all other available clinical data.
There are specific limitations to our study. This study
was a retrospective and not a pre-planned analysis. All
the data used for analysis were, however, prospectively
collected with blinding of invasive ICP. Our study was
not primarily directed at studying the phenomenon of
delayed reversibility of ONS distension; rather, this is
merely one possible explanation for our study’s findings
related to the actual primary hypothesis- that accuracy
of ONUS is diminished when ICP acutely fluctuates.
Since our primary stated objective was to analyze the
effect of acute fluctuation on accuracy, our definitions
of SAIF did not specifically address patients with high
ICP being treated, but included all patients with significant fluctuation in either direction. The fact that the
specificity and PPV of ONSD were particularly diminished with ICP fluctuation, while the sensitivity and
NPV showed only a mild decrease, is suggestive of, but
certainly not conclusive evidence for, a problem with
reversibility of ONSD distension. Prospective studies
with serial ONSD measurement following acute lowering of ICP are required to more specifically address the
questions of both the magnitude of inaccuracy following
treatment as well as the likely duration of impaired
reversal of ONS distension in vivo. The available documentation did not permit us to reliably determine the
likely proximate etiologies of ICP fluctuation in our
study. The presence of a confounding variable responsible for the diminished accuracy of ONSD in patients

in Figure 4. The ocular globe is the hypoechoic structure in the upper part of the images and the ONS the linear hypoechoic structure behind
the globe. Caliper A identifies a point 3 mm behind the retina while Caliper B measures the ONSD. ONSD is 0.53 cm, suggestive of continued
intracranial hypertension. Simultaneously recorded ICP from EVD was only 10 mmHg.

with SAIF cannot be excluded. The optimal ONSD cutoff for the detection of ICP >20 mmHg overall was significantly lower than the optimal ONSD cutoff proposed
by some authors [1,3,5], but similar to that proposed by
others [2]. We have previously postulated that the lower
optimal ONSD cutoff may be a result of differences in
measurement technique and of decreased contamination
with retrobulbar hypoechoic artifact [7].
Conclusions
The specificity and PPV of ONSD measurement for the
detection of raised ICP are substantially decreased in
the presence of significant acute ICP fluctuation.
Delayed reversal of ONS distension is one possible
explanation for this finding.
Key messages
• Optic nerve sheath distension on bedside ultrasound imaging is less predictive of intracranial
hypertension when intracranial pressure is acutely
fluctuating between high and normal.
• Delayed reversal of optic nerve sheath distension is
one possible explanation for this decrease in positive
predictive value.
