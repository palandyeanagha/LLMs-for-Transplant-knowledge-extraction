Introduction
!
This report is divided into a first paper that deals
with the underlying physical principles [1] and
this second paper that covers the most important clinical applications. Both the technology
and the clinical applications are developing
rapidly. This set of Guidelines, which provides a
snapshot of the state of the art, will therefore no
doubt soon need refreshing.
Two main forms of elastography have become
established in clinical practice, though other
important implementations are to be expected
as the field matures. In the first, known as quasistatic or strain elastography (SE), the tissue deformation produced (which is the strain) by an external palpation with the probe or by endogenous
stress such as cardiovascular movements, is assessed by following the way the speckle in the image
moves, usually with a tracking algorithm working
on the radio-frequency data, much as is used to
apply motion correction to the liver for Contrast
Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) [2]. The data can
then be used to form an image that is coded in colour or grey-scale to show the pattern of strain,
which is inversely related to tissue stiffness and
can be assessed subjectively. Usually the sign of
the strain (i. e. whether the tissue expands or contracts along a given direction) is ignored but in a
variant of this approach, the sign of the strain is
displayed; this method has been used in echocardiography and for the gut. These images are semiquantitative and do not directly depict the elasticity (i. e. the stress/strain ratio, or Young’s modulus);
there are technical reasons for this, mainly the difficulty of measuring the amount of stress within
the tissue that is due to the force applied at the surface. However, regions of interest (ROIs) can be
drawn over target areas in the screen and over an
adjacent reference region, if a reference normal tissue can be found that is likely to be experiencing
the same stress as the target region, and the ratio
calculated to provide a semi-quantitative analysis.

Abstract
!
The clinical part of these Guidelines and Recommendations produced under the auspices of the
European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in
Medicine and Biology EFSUMB assesses the clinically used applications of all forms of elastography,
stressing the evidence from meta-analyses and giving practical advice for their uses and interpretation. Diffuse liver disease forms the largest section,
reflecting the wide experience with transient and
shear wave elastography . Then follow the breast,
thyroid, gastro-intestinal tract, endoscopic elastography, the prostate and the musculo-skeletal system using strain and shear wave elastography as
appropriate. The document is intended to form a
reference and to guide clinical users in a practical
way.

The second form that is currently implemented is shear wave
elastography (SWE). Shear waves may not be familiar to clinical
readers but they frequently occur in human soft tissues. They
have similarities with the ultrasonic waves used for conventional ultrasound imaging, both being mechanical waves that are
conducted by soft tissue, but there are also key differences.
Shear waves are transverse (i. e. the particle movement is across
the direction of travel, as occurs in the ripples of a water surface
when it is disturbed); they are rapidly attenuated by tissue; they
travel much more slowly (between 1 and 10 m/s) and they are
not supported by liquids of low viscosity. Their speed is closely
related to Young’s modulus of elasticity and there is a simplified
formula for converting, with some assumptions, between cs (the
shear wave speed) and E (Young’s modulus). Shear waves are
produced by any mechanical disturbance and occur naturally
from muscular movements (voluntary, cardiac etc.) as well as
being induced by the ultrasound systems used to measure their
speed. The methods are described in greater detail in Part 1 of
these Recommendations [1] and are only briefly summarized
here.
In one system developed for liver fibrosis assessment, known as
transient elastography (TE), a mechanical piston concentrically
mounted with a single-element ultrasound transducer is used to
apply a light push to the skin over an intercostal space. The travel
of the resulting shear wave into the liver along the direction of
the ultrasound beam is used to measure its speed in a manner
similar to M-mode.
A useful way to generate shear waves is to use acoustic radiation
force: tiny displacements in soft tissue set up shear waves that
travel sideways away from the “pushing” ultrasound beam.
Though the amplitude of the resulting shear waves is minute
(a few microns’ displacement), they can be detected by conventional ultrasound using tracking algorithms. An acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) may be employed to generate a
shear-wave pulse, allowing its speed to be measured locally
with good spatial resolution.
Shear wave speed measurement elastography comes in three flavours [1]: in one, a small measurement box (usually 5x10 mm) is
set up within the tissue and readings of the shear wave speed are
made. This modality may be considered as point SWE (pSWE). In
a second, this is extended to sequential multiple pushing and
measurement points, so that a single static SWE image may be
built up and displayed as a colour-coded map of the shear wave
speed (2D-SWE), which is quantitative (an ROI gives the readouts). In a third, which requires specialised hardware for ultrafast
ultrasound imaging a real time imaging at approximately 1 frame
per second is possible within a sensitive box. The quantitative nature of shear wave elastography is an advantage and the fact that
the system displaces the tissue is expected to improve consistency since the operator does not need to move the transducer.
A final form of elastography that is currently available also uses
ARFI but any shear wave generated is ignored and instead the
amplitude of the displacement generated in the vicinity of the
pushing beam’s focus is displayed and used as a surrogate for
the inverse of Young’s modulus. Such displacement lasts only
milliseconds and an image must be built slowly from multiple
positions of the pushing focus, producing a qualitative static elastogram. As with SWE the fact that the system moves the tissue
is expected to improve consistency. The localised nature of the
applied force should also improve the relationship between displacement and elasticity compared with applying the force at the
surface, as well as improve contrast and spatial resolution.
A figure of merit is provided by many elastography scanners to
reject poor quality image data, and an onscreen display may allow the rejection threshold to be set and provide visual feedback
to assist the acquisition of better images. Poor quality may result
from noise (for example, if the tissue under study is too deep) and
uncertainty in the tracking of the displacements. Elastographic
artefacts are common and need to be learned and recognised.
Cysts produce patterns that depend on the particular scanner
used.
In practice, elastography forms an extension of conventional ultrasonography, much in the same way as Doppler is integrated
into clinical practice. It is unhelpful to compare elastography
with conventional ultrasonography: more usefully, it forms a natural extension that easily integrates with conventional scanning.
The combination is often much more powerful than either alone.
A practical problem that remains unresolved is the different colour scales and even scale directions that are used; whether stiffer
tissue is coded as blue or red and whether it is placed at the top or
bottom of the scale all remain to be standardised, though at least
the colour scale is a user-choice on most systems. The situation is
reminiscent of the controversy over whether the B-mode display
should be black-on-white or, as eventually emerged as standard,
white-on-black that plagued the early days of ultrasonography. It
is an indication that the subject is not yet mature but also that
there is much undiscovered potential in an exciting new field.
A general finding is that experience is needed to obtain reproducible elasticity readings. This is best evidenced for transient elastography. It has been shown that better results are obtained
when users have performed 500 previous studies [3]. For strain
elastography the rate and distance over which the probe is
moved are critical to obtaining the best possible elastograms, although the trend is for systems to become increasingly tolerant
to the motion used and whether any external motion is required
at all. For all elastographic methods, the fact that tissue becomes
stiffer as it is stressed (“compressed”) is an important factor:
prestress can result in misleadingly high stiffness readings, especially in superficial tissues.
More detailed information of the physical basis, technical characteristics and artefacts of each method are more extensively reported in the part 1 of these Recommendations [1].
Liver
!
Background
The assessment of fibrosis in chronic liver diseases is pivotal for
prognosis and guiding management, including whether to start
antiviral treatment. Liver biopsy is considered the “gold-standard” for fibrosis assessment and stage classification [4] and can
also grade necro-inflammatory activity, but it has limitations. It
is invasive, with potential complications that are severe in up to
1 % of cases [5, 6]. The specimen represents roughly only 1/50 000
of the liver volume, and there is interobserver variability at microscopic evaluation [7]. Therefore, non-invasive methods for
liver fibrosis assessment have been an intense field of research,
including elastographic methods using ultrasound.
A difficulty with liver elastography is the proliferation of different
methods which are likely not equivalent. This means that cut-off
values are system-specific and cannot readily be compared across
machines. Currently, transient elastography is the best-studied
and further results with other methods are awaited.

Patient-dependent factors can influence the results [8]. These
confounders include changes that increase the liver’s volume,
such as congestive heart failure [9], exacerbations of acute hepatitis associated with transaminase flares [10] and feeding [3] all
of which make the liver stiffer. Patients should be fasted for liver
studies [11]. In addition, extrahepatic cholestasis [12] and the use
of beta-blockers [13] increase the readings, as does held inspiration, so that transiently stopping breathing in a neutral position is
optimal for measurements. The left lobe of liver is often reported
to be stiffer than the right, when both lobes could be assessed
[14, 15] and assessments should also avoid the stiffer capsule and
large vessels [16].
Transient elastography
Transient elastography (TE) is performed using the FibroScan®
(Echosens, Paris, France). The method is described in part 1 [1].
Clinical applications
TE is the first ultrasound-based elastographic technique for the
liver, introduced in 2003, and has the largest body of evidence
by far. It was initially evaluated in patients with chronic hepatitis
C and later in other chronic hepatopathies [17 – 19].
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, liver stiffness (LS) values
greater than 6.8 – 7.6 kPa in chronic viral hepatitis patients signify a high probability of significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) on biopsy.
The cut-off values for predicting cirrhosis (F = 4) range between
11.0 and 13.6 kPa. Studies show that TE is not accurate enough
to distinguish between contiguous stages of fibrosis, but can differentiate absence and mild fibrosis from significant fibrosis and
cirrhosis, which is more critical for decisions regarding treatment
[17 – 19]. The use of TE in chronic hepatitis C has been endorsed
in the recommendations for the management of viral hepatitis by
the European Association for the Study of the Liver [20].
In chronic hepatitis B, ALT flares are not uncommon and since
acute inflammation is an independent factor affecting LS measurements, it has been suggested that cut-off values should be
adapted to the ALT level [21]. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis in hepatitis B virus patients [22] found considerable mean
AUROCs for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2) and cirrhosis
(F4), namely of 0.859 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.857 –
0.860), and 0.929 (95 % CI, 0.928 – 0.929), respectively.
Comparable results have been reported in non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH). Wong
[23] compared TE with liver biopsy in 246 consecutive NAFLD patients and revealed 91 % sensitivity and 75 % specificity for predicting severe fibrosis (F≥ 3), using a cut-off value of 7.9 kPa. Steatosis
does not seem to hamper LS measurements [24 – 26] as it does not
change the speed of shear waves, although it can attenuate them.
LS measurements can be difficult in obese patients and here the
new “XL” probe increases the success rate [26, 27]. A meta-analysis
in recurrent hepatitis C post-transplantation demonstrated 98 %
sensitivity and 84 % specificity for LS using TE for predicting cirrhosis [28].
TE has also been used in assessing many other diffuse liver diseases, with good results, summarised in Wong and Chan [23].
TE has been studied for predicting complications of cirrhosis,
such as portal hypertension and mortality. The AUROCs for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous
pressure gradient ≥ 12 mmHg), were 0.94 – 0.99 for cut-offs ranging from 13.6 to 21 kPa [29, 30]. For predicting grade 2 or 3 oesophageal varices, TE cut-off values from 19.8 to 47.5 kPa, with
AUROCs of 0.72 – 0.78 are proposed [31 – 33]. This wide spread
in values makes TE inappropriate for selecting patients for endoscopy. More recent studies that investigated the possible role of
measurements of TE in the spleen, performed with the assistance
of conventional ultrasonography to select the measurement site,
showed better correlation with portal pressure (r = 0.89) in patients with cirrhosis than liver assessment with TE [34]. Splenic
assessment also produced high AUROC values (0.966) for the
identification of patients with portal hypertension (hepatic
venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mmHg) [34], and TE seems to be
more precise than Doppler ultrasound [35].
In a prospective study, 1457 patients with chronic hepatitis C underwent liver biopsy, TE and serologic markers of fibrosis and were
followed-up for 5 years; 77 patients died and 16 received liver
transplantation. Patients with histological METAVIR F3 / F4 fibrosis
had a significantly reduced 5-year survival as compared to those
with F0–F2 fibrosis. The results for TE were more accurate than
liver biopsy in predicting prognosis: those with TE > 9.5 kPa, had a
significantly reduced 5-year survival [36].
Two prospective studies evaluating the risk of HCC development
over three years in 866 hepatitis C virus [37] and 1130 hepatitis B
virus patients [38] reported that the risk of developing HCC paralleled the increase of liver stiffness values, not only separating patients with or without cirrhosis, but also grouping patients in different risk classes within those with already established cirrhosis.
TE has been tested to screen for subjects with significant fibrosis.
In a study on 1190 subjects older than 45 from a general community-based population attending for a medical check-up, 89 (7.5 %)
had LS measurements > 8 kPa. Though liver biochemistry was normal, a cause of chronic liver disease was found in 43 % [39].
Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of TE measurements are
excellent (ICC 0.98 for both) in non-obese subjects [40]. TE values
are higher in males.
Practical points
TE is performed with self-standing dedicated equipment with
specific probes through an intercostal approach. It can therefore
be used in numerous settings ranging from primary to tertiary
care centers, outreach drug users facilities, jails and dispensaries.
The examination procedure is standardized and a standardized
reporting sheet, including all relevant information to judge on
the quality of the examination, is available [41].
Recommendations
▶ TE can be used to assess the severity of liver fibrosis in patients
with chronic viral hepatitis, provided that confounding factors
are taken into account, and especially to distinguish patients
with nil/mild fibrosis from those with significant fibrosis and
to identify those with cirrhosis.
▶ TE is useful for assessement of liver fibrosis in patients with
NAFLD, alcoholic liver diseases, and in patients co-infected
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C
virus. Other types of chronic liver disease might also be investigated, but the evidence is more limited.
▶ TE is useful for assessement of liver fibrosis in patients with
post-transplant recurrence of chronic hepatitis C.
▶ TE has some value for predicting the occurrence of complications of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, HCC and liverassociated mortality. It cannot replace upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy for identifying patient with varices.

Pitfalls and limitations
In a study on more than 13,000 LS measurements with the standard probe, failure occurred in 3.1 % and results were unreliable in
15.8 % of cases, both associated with BMI > 30 kg/m2, age > 52 years,
and type 2 diabetes [3]. In another study, the technical failure rate
with the standard probe correlated with the BMI; there was a failure rate of 7 % for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, 19 % for BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and 59 %
for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 [26]; however, the failure rate when using the
XL-probe decreased to negligible levels (0.7, 0, and 4.9 %, respectively) [26].
TE cannot be performed in patients with perihepatic ascites.
Shear wave speed measurement
Shear wave speed measurement elastography is available on several systems (see Part 1 for details [1]).
Clinical applications
As with TE, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) shear wave
speed quantification was at first used and validated in patients
with chronic hepatitis C. Cut-offs of 1.21 – 1.34 m/s predict significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), (AUROC 0.85 – 0.89) [42, 43], while for cirrhosis, ARFI cut-offs range between 1.55 and 2 m/s (AUROC
0.89 – 0.93) [42 – 44]. The accuracy of ARFI for the assessment of
liver fibrosis is similar to TE [42, 45, 46]. ARFI shows promising
results in patients with NAFLD and NASH [47, 48] and post-transplantation [49].
In a recent meta-analysis by Friedrich-Rust et al. of 518 patients
with chronic liver disease [50], the AUROC was 0.87 for predicting significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), 0.91 for severe fibrosis (F ≥ 3) and
0.93 for cirrhosis. Interobserver variability was reported to be
good in healthy subjects [16] and in patients with chronic liver
disease (ICC = 0.87) [15] when measurements are taken appropriately in the right lobe. ARFI allows measurements at different
sites and a comparison of the two lobes of the liver showed a
trend toward higher values on the left [14, 15, 51]. However, results on the right were more accurate compared to conventional
percutaneous liver biopsy [51].
2D-SWE using the Aixplorer® system is reported in two studies in
133 and 121 patients with chronic hepatitis C (with 29 % and
100 % of patients having biopsy as gold standard) [52, 53]. The
AUROCs were similar in the two studies (0.95 and 0.98 for F ≥ 2,
0.96 and 0.96 for F ≥ 3, 0.97 and 0.98 for F = 4 respectively in the
French and Italian studies) and better than those for TE, also performed in all patients. Interoperator and day-by-day intraoperator reproducibility are good in healthy subjects [54].
Practical points
The patient should be fasted. Shear wave speed measurements
are performed intercostally in the right liver with conventional
curved arrays. The probe is aligned along an intercostal space.
In 2D-SWE, if the signal is weak or unstable, the penetration mode
can be activated and pressure can be applied to open the intercostal space – contrary to the general recommendation, this does not
increase the liver’s stiffness as the intervening tissues prevent distortion of the liver surface. Once the 2D-SWE signal has stabilized
(after 3 to 4 seconds), an image can be acquired and LS can be
measured using an elasticity box which should be paced to avoid
the superficial parts of the liver and discrete structures in the liver.
The recommended depth is between 3 and 7 cm.
Recommendations
▶ pSWE and 2D-SWE can be used to assess the severity of liver
fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, especially
with hepatitis C. The weight of evidence that is available varies
between different shear wave methodologies and for different
brands of scanners using the same methodology.
▶ pSWE with ARFI is promising for liver fibrosis assessment in
patients with NAFLD, and post-transplant patients.
Pitfalls and limitations
As with TE, elevated aminotransferase levels are associated with
higher LS values on ARFI [55, 56]; whether this is true also for
2D-SWE is not yet known but, since these enzyme flares probably
reflect liver inflammation, it would be expected to be a general
effect.
Little information is still available about the performance of
pSWE, and particularly of 2D-SWE in non-viral chronic liver disease.
Better correlation of ARFI LS measurements with histological liver
fibrosis has been reported when using quality indicators: interquartile range< 30 % and success rate> 60 % [57]. Shear wave methods (pSWE and 2D-SWE) can be utilized in patients with ascites.
Strain elastography
All the major manufacturers have strain elastography incorporated at least in their high-end systems but only one, Hitachi, has
been widely used for the liver. Results from this system therefore
are the main focus of this section, but this should not be taken to
imply that others are not recommended: it merely reflects current experience.
Clinical applications
Different scores for semi-quantitative interpretation of strain
elastography have been proposed: the German Elasticity Score
[58], the Japanese Elasticity Score [59] and the Liver Fibrosis Index (LF Index) [60]. All are based on visual assessments of the
spatial patterns of strain imaging within the ROI. However, the
evidence with this approach is still too limited to allow recommendation for its clinical use, at least in European patients.
Elastography for focal liver lesions
Elastography (strain elastography, 2D-SWE, pSWE) have been
studied recently to characterise focal liver lesions, to differentiate
between benign and malignant masses [61–64]. Promising results
were reported, but more research is needed, especially in comparison to CEUS, before recommendations on its use in clinical practice can be made. At present, elastography cannot be recommended for distinguishing benign from malignant liver lesions.
Breast
!
Background
In the breast, elastography has found application in focal diseases, relying on the known high stiffness of most cancers compared with both the normal breast and with benign lesions.
Both strain and shear wave methods have been evaluated and
the main thrust has been to improve the differentiation between
breast imaging reporting system (BI-RADS) 3 lesions (which
need follow-up) and to a lesser extent to improve the management of BI-RADS 4a lesions by reclassifying them as 3 or 4b.

Strain elastography
Strain elastography is initially based on visual inspection of the
stiffness map using the Tsukuba criteria in which the amount of
stiff tissue in and around the lesion is assessed [65]. This five-point
scale scores the lesion according to the extent of stiff tissue relative
to the background, with a score of 1 for a lesion not stiffer than surrounding tissue, 2 and 3 to lesions with increasing proportions
that are stiffer and 4 given to a lesion that is stiffer throughout;
5 indicates that the stiffness extends beyond the margins of the
mass seen on B-mode.
The best cut-off point for discriminating benign from malignant
masses falls at the 3 – 4 boundary and the addition of elastography
to B-mode evaluation has been shown to improve the accuracy of
BI-RADS classification [66 – 68]. In practice, the elastogram with
strain elastography takes up to a few seconds to settle to a reproducible image. Most systems offer a quality estimator. A sequence
stored in the cine loop should be reviewed slowly and the most
reproducible frame(s) selected. Regions of interest can then be
placed to cover the whole lesion and in the adjacent fat (ideally at
the same depth) to allow calculation of the fat/lesion ratio.
A series of 370 consecutive patients with breast lesions smaller
than 2 cm (39 % malignant) were studied with strain elastography using histology as the reference. The B-mode BI-RADS accuracy was improved, with sensitivity and specificity changing
from 90.3 % and 68.3 % to 83.9 % and 87.8 % respectively by the addition of elastography [69]. In a series of 193 lesions and using
the 3:4 cut-off, Schaefer et al. found that the sensitivity was
96.9 %, and the specificity was 76 % and recommended that strain
elastography could be used as a complement to B-mode scoring
but not alone, mainly because there were two cancers with Tsukuba score of 1 [70]. In a study of 200 histologically proven lesions (116 malignant), Fischer et al. found that the strain ratio
was more sensitive and specific than either B-mode ultrasound
or mammography, with values of 95 % and 74 % respectively
when using a lesion/fat cut-off ratio of 2.27 [71].
An important feature is that cancers appear larger on the elasticity
image than on B-mode [65, 72, 73]. This may result from local invasion by the cancer that is not always obvious on B-mode. The
elastographic size correlates better with the actual size of the cancer at surgery and an elastography:grey scale width ratio above 1
had an overall sensitivity of 98.6 % and an overall specificity of
87.4 % in a multicentre series of 578 patients with biopsy proof
[74]. The quantification of elastography using strain and width ratios can increase sensitivity at the expense of specificity.
Two recent meta-analyses on strain imaging have been reported.
In the analysis by Gong et al. [75] 212 English language papers
were found and 23 were suitable for detailed analysis. Most
used the 5-point Tsukuba scale. The overall mean sensitivity and
specificity for the diagnosis of malignant breast lesions were 0.83
(95 % CI, 0.814 – 0.853) and 0.84 (95 % CI, 0.829 – 0.854) with a
summary ROC of 0.93. The analysis by Sadigh et al. [76] identified
over 3 000 citations of which 12 were suitable for further analysis, including over 2 000 breast lesions. Both the strain ratio and
the relative size (length ratio) were evaluated. The cut-off point
for strain ratio varied from 4.5 to 0.5 in different studies. Summary test operator sensitivity was 88 % (95 % credible interval [CrI],
84 – 91 %), and specificity was 83 % (CrI, 78 – 88 %) for strain ratio
and 98 % (CrI 93 – 99 %) and 72 % (CrI 31 – 96 %) for length ratio.
The elastographic appearance of breast cysts depends on the
techniques used [2, 77 – 79], but whatever the technique SE appears to be accurate in establishing that the content is liquid.
Shear Wave Elastography (2D-SWE)
The colour (or optionally a grey-scale) overlay indicates the shear
wave speed (or the converted kPa values) and ROIs can be placed
on the stiffest part of a lesion and on adjacent fat to obtain quantitative read outs as well as ratios. Cancers tend to be stiff and also
more heterogeneous than benign lesions and often the stiffness
seems to be most marked at and around the periphery of the
mass.
When the elasticity cannot be estimated, the colour display is
switched off so that the underlying B-mode image (usually black)
is revealed [1]. This should not be mistaken for a low value that
signifies a soft region. Reasons for the absence of shear wave signals include situations where the system cannot measure the
stiffness because the tissue is not vibrated enough and when the
amplitude of the shear wave is too low and is lost in noise [80].
Biological conditions where the shear wave cannot be imaged
are also encountered, such as when the speed of the shear wave
speed is too high to be captured, (e. g. in extremely stiff cancers),
and when the interrogating beam cannot penetrate, e. g. in regions that are shadowed-out, typically in the deeper parts of scirrhous cancers [1]. A practical rule is that the stiffest part of the
mass or surroundings is definitive. As with strain elastography,
genuinely soft cancers do occur, albeit rarely: these appear as
soft masses rather than as a void in the colour layer.
Cysts deserve special mention: non-viscous fluids do not support
shear waves and so they appear as colour voids, usually seen as
black regions where the anechoic B-mode layer shows. However,
when the fluid is viscous, shear wave signals may be seen as soft
regions.
A series of report on the impact of 2D-SWE on the classification
of breast masses [81, 82], including a large prospective study of
around 1 000 patients [83], testify to its value in reclassifying BIRADS 3 and 4a masses. In this study, reclassifying BI-RADS 3 lesions as 4a and thus precipitating biopsy while reclassifying BIRADS 4a masses as 3 and thus avoiding biopsy, would have improved specificity over conventional ultrasound from 61.1 % to
78.5 % without impairing sensitivity in 650 lesions. This was
achieved by using a cut-off value of maximum shear wave speed
of 5 m/s (80 kPa).
The same study also included an analysis of reproducibility, which
was very high. Intraclass correlation for 2D-SWE diameter was almost perfect (ICC ≥ 0.94). Intraobserver reliability for maximum
and mean elasticity were almost perfect (ICC = 0.84 and 0.87) and
substantial for ratio of lesion-to-fat elasticity (ICC = 0.77). Interobserver agreement was moderate for 2D-SWE homogeneity
(κ = 0.57), substantial for qualitative colour assessment of maximum elasticity (κ = 0.66), fair for B-mode mass margins (κ = 0.38),
and moderate for B-mode mass shape (κ = 0.58), orientation
(κ = 0.53), and BI-RADS assessment (κ = 0.59) [84].
Additional 2D-SWE features support the potential to downgrade
BI-RADS 3 lesions, as described by the BE-1 study group [85].
These results indicate that 2D-SWE can complement conventional US to improve diagnostic performance by reducing unnecessary initial short-term follow-up of BI-RADS 3 breast lesions,
when the 2D-SWE findings are benign, especially when maximal
elasticity is ≤ 20kPa.
Quantitative SWE with ARFI can be used for characterising breast
masses. In a series of 161 masses with 43 malignancies, using a
shear wave speed cut off of 3.6 m/s, a sensitivity of 91 % and a specificity of 80.6 % were achieved [86].

Practical points
No particular patient preparation is required and the elastography estimate is a seamless part of the standard examination. The
patient is examined in the standard position with the appropriate
arm elevated. Conventional linear arrays are utilized, as for
standard grey scale examinations.
Elasticity box: placement and sizing of the box is important. It
should cover the lesion together with sufficient surrounding
breast tissue to allow comparison between the two regions. Elastography works best when the lesion is surrounded by breast
tissue. If it lies close to the skin or the rib cage, the results may
be unreliable. Similarly, lesions larger than the ultrasound fieldof-view may give unreliable results and in this case, comparisons
with the surrounding fat are impossible. Briefly, lesions that are
too large or too deep may not allow good quality elastograms to
be obtained [87].
The main use of elastography in the breast is as an adjunct to conventional ultrasound to improve the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and several studies attest to the value
of strain elastography in refining the BI-RADS score [76, 88, 89].
The technique is easy to learn and reproducibility is better than
with B-mode US.
The addition of elastography to conventional ultrasound assessment of breast masses is endorsed in the forthcoming ACR
BI-RADS Ultrasound lexicon (personal communication, EB Mendelson, 2012) and can be recommended provided the user has
adequate experience with the system being used. Elastography
should be used as an adjunct to conventional high quality ultrasound and it fits smoothly into the standard examination protocol. Clinical concern over missing any cancer suggests that it
should not be relied upon on its own to downgrade a lesion that
would otherwise be sent for biopsy (BI-RADS 4a or higher) but
that it can help by upgrading a mass of low suspicion that would
otherwise be followed-up (BI-RADS 3), and thus sent for biopsy.
In practice, users find that such changes in management are
uncommon and elastography is more usually used to increase
confidence when the findings concur with the standard ultrasound findings. It is also useful for confirming that a lesion is a
cyst when the contents are echogenic.
Limitations and artefacts
The pattern of cysts has been mentioned; this may be considered
as an useful artefact since they highlight the cystic nature of the
lesion [79].
Not all cancers are stiff and not all stiff lesions are cancers, so regarding elastography as a tool that provides clear cut-off values is
unsafe. In vitro measurements of the stiffness of breast masses
show overlap, with a few fibroadenomas that are stiff and some
soft cancers [90, 91]. Fibrous tissue is often surprisingly soft but
sometimes is stiff. The elastographic findings should be considered as an associate feature of conventional ultrasound and considering clinical background.
Pre-stress with the probe should be avoided as this increases the
stiffness of all tissues.
In SWE, a failure to capture the shear wave may occur [80]. Care
must be taken to distinguish absence of the colour layer from the
colours that indicate a low shear wave speed. The appearance of
cysts containing viscous fluid that may give signals has also been
mentioned. The push pulses sometimes “breakthrough” and produce spaced vertical bands, most marked near the skin. They are
obviously artefacts and should not cause diagnostic confusion.
Recommendations for all forms of elastography
▶ To increase diagnostic confidence in the benign or malignant
nature of a lesion.
▶ To re-grade benign-appearing lesions that are stiff and consider
them for biopsy.
Thyroid
!
Background
Thyroid nodules are frequently detected with ultrasound and are
especially common in parts of the world with a poor iodine supply [92]. Conventional ultrasonography is very sensitive to thyroid nodules but cannot reliably differentiate the few that are malignant from the very common benign nodules [93, 94].
Methods
A classical feature of malignancy is a hard or firm consistency upon
palpation. However, this assessment is subjective and depends on
the experience of the examiner. Small and deep nodules and those
in a multinodular goitre cannot be palpated reliably. With the
introduction of elastography, reproducible assessment of tissue
consistency has become available.
Both strain and shear wave elastography methods have been
used in the thyroid.
For strain elastography, classifications using 4 or 5 visual categorical scores, either colour-coded or in grey-scale have been
proposed. The best evaluated differentiates between completely
or predominantly soft nodules as a benign sign and a completely
or predominantly hard nodule as a sign of malignancy [95]. The
strain ratio between a lesion and adjacent healthy thyroid tissue
has also been proposed to differentiate benign from malignant
lesions [96].
Two quantitative shear wave elastography methods have been
evaluated to date: pSWE and 2D-SWE.
Clinical applications
Strain elastography
Most published studies have used strain elastography. A recent
meta-analysis including 639 nodules reported a mean sensitivity
of 92 % and a specificity of 90 % for the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules [97]. However, the patient population was highly selected with a 24 % prevalence of malignancy and many patients
were sent to surgery, which, though good as a standard, does
not reflect typical clinical practice. In addition, the results were
challenged by a recent study that reports no additional value of
strain elastography to experienced B-mode ultrasound [98].
Two recent studies [96, 99] with 309 and 97 patients respectively,
used strain values and ratios to determine thyroid nodule stiffness. All patients were referred to surgery. Vorlander et al.
utilized a proprietary absolute measurement of strain value,
which ranged from 1.0 (max soft) to 0.1 (max hard) and reported
a negative predictive value (NPV) for malignancy of 100 % using a
strain ratio cut-off of > 0.31 and a positive predictive value (PPV)
of 42 % using a cut-off of < 0.15 [96]. Cantisani et al. reported a
sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 97.3 %, 91.7 %, 87.8 % and
98.2 % for the prediction of malignancy using a strain ratio ≥ 2 (ratio of lesion strain to surrounding parenchyma). Elastography
was more sensitive and specific than all conventional ultrasound
features.
Another study compared strain elastography based on four point
scores and the strain ratios between the nodule and the surroundCosgrove D et al. EFSUMB Guidelines and… Ultraschall in Med 2013; 34: 238–253

ing thyroid at the same depth [100]. The diagnostic accuracy of the
strain ratio evaluation was slightly higher (0.88 vs. 0.79, p < 0.001)
than that of the elastography score, with a higher specificity.
Another prospective study [101] evaluated strain elastography in
51 patients with small single solid nodules of 3 – 10 mm submitted to surgical resection. A five-point scale based on that
developed for the breast was used [65]; with a cut-off at 3/4, a
sensitivity of 91 %, specificity of 89 %, PPV 94 % and NPV 85 % for
the diagnosis of malignant nodules was found. Thus, strain elastography seems to have a potential even in small nodules.
However, additional studies, including only a few follicular carcinomas, revealed inconclusive data on the value of elastography.
Most malignant nodules missed by elastography were follicular
carcinomas which can be soft and difficult to differentiate from
benign nodules [97]. Strain elastography was evaluated in 102
patients with indeterminate cytology who went to surgery [102].
Histology revealed 64 follicular adenomas, 32 follicular variants of
papillary thyroid cancer, 4 follicular carcinomas and two hyperplastic nodules. In this selected population, strain elastography
(4-point scale) only reached a PPV of 34 % and a NPV of 50 %. Conversely, Cantisani et al [103] reported a study including 140
nodules with indeterminate cytology in which elastography with
a strain ratio > 2.05 achieved sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV and
accuracy of 87.5 %, 92 %, 94.8 %, 81.4 %, 89.8 %, respectively.
Shear wave elastography (pSWE and 2D-SWE)
Shear wave speed is reported to be higher in malignant nodules
than benign nodules in three studies using 2D-SWE, mainly investigating patients submitted to surgery [104 – 106] so that accuracy values in a more typical population remain to be confirmed.
ARFI with point shear wave speed quantification (pSWE) was
evaluated and compared to strain elastography in two studies
[107, 108]. As with strain elastography, malignant lesions were
significantly stiffer than benign lesions. One of these studies
compared diagnostic accuracy of strain elastography using a
4-point visual scale and pSWE shear wave speed measurement
and showed no statistically significant difference between the
two methods (AUROC for the diagnosis of malignancy 0.74 for SE
and 0.69 for pSWE, p = ns) [107].
Elastography might be useful in multinodular goitre to select
nodules for fine needle aspiration biopsy, but there is no data
available at present.
Practical points
Elastography of thyroid lesions can be performed using either SE
or SWE with many high-end systems using linear transducers. No
patient preparation is required.
Recommendations
▶ Elastography is an additional tool for thyroid lesion differentiation.
▶ Based on expert opinion, elastography may be used to guide
follow up of lesions negative for malignancy at FNA.
Limitations
Intralesional calcifications are common and may bias the stiffness of the lesion, as has been shown for peripheral calcifications
[109 – 111].
Strain elastography should be interpreted with caution in extensive cystic areas since this may cause artefacts.
Elastography shows high sensitivity, specificity and NPV for the
diagnosis of papillary carcinoma: however, the evaluations were
performed in highly specialised centres with high incidences of
carcinoma.
Gastrointestinal tract
!
Introduction
B-mode US of the layered structure of the gastrointestinal (GI)
wall usually shows five distinct layers [112]. Elastography may
also show the layered structure of the GI wall, but these do not
always correspond to the B-mode layers. A special method, Strain
Rate Imaging (SRI), which shows the sign of the strain, is used to
assess contractility of the GI walls [113]. Furthermore, strain
elastography is used to assess the hardness of focal lesions of the
GI tract.
Gastrointestinal wall pathology
A major clinical challenge in Crohn’s disease is to evaluate whether
a stenosis is caused by inflammation or fibrosis, since the latter
requires surgical intervention while an inflammatory stricture
requires medical treatment. Strain elastography has been tested
in this setting and helps the distinction between these two conditions, since fibrotic stenoses appear stiff and inflammatory
stenoses soft [114]. Furthermore, patients with active Crohn’s
disease have a higher strain ratio between the inflamed and normal regions than patients in remission [115] and than patients
with active ulcerative colitis. In a study on inflammatory bowel
disease, the findings on elastography were significantly correlated
with the endoscopic findings [116].
Gastrointestinal motility
Gastric contractions and peristaltic waves can be visualised and
monitored by ultrasonography and the method is sometimes
used in patients with dyspepsia [117, 118]. Assessment of the
relative strain of the muscle layers of the gastric wall is feasible
and allows detailed mapping of strain distribution [113, 119]
and SRI can distinguish the contractile activity of the longitudinal from the circular muscle layers that cannot be appreciated on B-mode. SRI has been evaluated in vitro [120, 121]
and in vivo to monitor response to drug intervention [122]). In
patients with functional dyspepsia, SRI demonstrated that subgroups of dyspepsia could be selected on the basis of strain
measurements of the gastric wall [118].
Practical points
Strain imaging of the GI tract is normally performed with linear
transducers. SE can be performed with many high-end ultrasound scanners. Conversely, SRI is only available with specifically
dedicated software currently provided by one manufacturer.
Limitations
Shadowing by bowel gas precludes a complete overview of all
bowel segments using transabdominal ultrasound. Peristalsis
poses a major challenge to strain imaging of the bowel; it impairs
image quality and reduces the accuracy of semi-quantitative
elastographic measurements. More studies are needed to establish the role of strain imaging in the evaluation of GI pathology
and motility.

Recommended uses and indications
Elastography is indicated for:
▶ Characterising bowel wall lesions and possibly discerning the
active phase of inflammation from fibrotic stenosis using
strain elastography.
▶ Evaluation of gastric contractility and GI wall strain using SRI.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography
!
Introduction
EUS elastography is a method for the in vivo characterisation of
hardness of pancreatic lesions [123 – 125], lymph nodes [126,
127] and gastrointestinal wall layers (especially in the anorectum
[128]). Though the technology needs further refinement, initial reports demonstrate proof-of-principle for the evaluation and staging of subepithelial and epithelial gastrointestinal tumours; however, its clinical significance is not yet established [129, 130].
Methods
Only strain elastography is currently available and it can be used
with longitudinal and radial echo-endoscopes, the former having
the advantage that suspicious regions can be biopsied under
direct visualisation. The area to be evaluated is defined by a ROI
in a similar way to colour Doppler. The necessary pressure can be
applied by manipulating the probe, though very little additional
pressure is required as the forces from the pulsation of adjacent
vessels are usually sufficient. The elasticity box must be sufficiently large to encompass the lesion and enough surrounding
normal tissue for comparison, ideally containing equal amounts
of each. Comparing two different tissues within the elasticity
box (e. g. a focal pancreatic lesion and adjacent pancreatic
parenchyma) allows calculation of the strain ratio [131]. New
technical developments allow for averaging over several frames
to calculate the mean histogram value, which corresponds to
overall strain within a selected area in the elasticity box [132,
133].
Interpretation
Strain elastography allows assessment and visualization of relative
stiffness differences [1]. Interobserver reliability was substantial
for qualitative elastographic characterization of solid pancreatic
lesions (kappa values 0.72 – 0.785) [123, 124, 134]. More conflicting results were obtained for lymph nodes: in one study, interobserver agreement proved to be moderate for general elastographic impression and for strain ratio (kappa 0.58 and 0.59,
respectively), but not for a defined scoring system (kappa 0.35)
[135]. A multicentre study, however, reported substantial interobserver agreement with this scoring system (kappa 0.66) [123].
Limitations and artefacts
A number of technical factors specific for EUS may adversely influence elastographic assessment in clinical practice. The small
size and penetration depth of EUS transducers limits the applicability of endoscopic ultrasound elastography for characterising
large and deep-seated lesions. If the ROI is too small to adequately represent the tissue surrounding the lesion or if there is size
discrepancy between the lesion and the surrounding tissue,
assessment of relative stiffness differences between the lesion
and surrounding normal tissue may be impaired [124]. Moreover,
the reproducibility of elastography may be reduced in several
anatomical sites in which the effects of physiological movement
are too weak or too strong (heart, large arterial vessels) or in
which compression with the transducer is difficult (left adrenal
gland, spleen, or parts of the liver). Interposition of large vessels,
cystic lesions and dilated ducts between the target lesion and the
transducer may impair strain assessments.
The utility of EUS elastography for discrimination of malignant
lesions or infiltrations from benign disease may be hampered by
tumor necrosis (which is soft), by fibrosis (e. g. of lymph nodes
pancreatitis, and by mucinous or semi-solid content of cystic lesions [123].
Clinical applications
Pancreas
Anatomical considerations and image interpretation
The pancreas is of uniform intermediate stiffness but, with
advancing age, it may become heterogeneous. Embryologically
the pancreas develops from two primordia, the dorsal and
ventral anlages. The latter can be hypoechoic and may be confused with focal inflammation or a tumour. Elastography has
proven to be particularly helpful because the tissue properties
are similar in the two parts of a healthy pancreas [136].
Practical advice
The elastography patterns have been described in healthy subjects (n = 20), in diffuse chronic pancreatitis (n = 20) and in focal
pancreatic lesions (n = 33) [126]. All malignant pancreatic
tumours and serous cystadenomas showed a honeycomb pattern
of mid hardness, and were well delineated against healthy parenchyma. However, this pattern was also observed in half of the
chronic pancreatitis patients, so that the specificity of the
method in this study was only about 60 %. The reason for this is
the similar fibrotic structure producing similar mechanical properties in cancer and chronic pancreatitis [126].
In acute pancreatitis, necrosis appears as softer tissue compared
to tumours. Whether elastography can help in the diagnosis of
pancreatic fibrosis remains to be evaluated. Elastography does
not contribute to the early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma in
chronic pancreatitis [123, 137].
EUS Elastography is helpful in diagnosis of early autoimmune
pancreatitis due to the unique appearance of universal stiff tissue
in this disease [137].
For the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant focal pancreatic masses, qualitative [123, 126] and semi-quantitative SE
approaches [125, 133, 134, 138, 139] have been used, both showing high overall accuracy. Two multicentre studies showed a high
sensitivity (over 90 %), but lower specificity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of benign versus malignant focal pancreatic masses [124, 134]. Two meta-analyses published recently
have indicated excellent values of EUS elastography for differentiation of focal pancreatic masses, with high sensitivity but lower
specificity [140, 141].
Computer-aided diagnosis techniques might improve the accuracy for the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic masses, the
most used being artificial neural networks [125, 133]. However,
there is expert consensus and evidence in the literature that
strain elastography cannot replace cytopathological diagnosis of
focal pancreatic disease at present, mainly because of its limited
specificity. However, when EUS-FNA is negative, a suspicious
finding on elastography can influence further clinical decisions.
Recent observations suggest that percutaneous elastography
(ARFI) may be used in differentiation of pancreatic lesions [142].

Recommendations
▶ EUS elastography is useful as a complementary tool for the
characterisation of focal pancreatic lesions.
▶ When there is strong clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer,
but the biopsy is inconclusive or negative, a hard focal lesion
on elastography and/or suggestive endoscopic CEUS (hypovascular lesion) [143] should guide clinical management by indicating repeat EUS-FNA or direct referral to surgery.
▶ EUS elastography cannot be currently recommended for
differentiating advanced chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic
carcinoma due to their similar tissue stiffness in a large proportion of cases.
Lymph nodes
Reliable classification of benign and malignant lymph nodes is
important for prognosis and selection of appropriate therapy for
many cancers, e. g. oesophageal, stomach, bronchial, and pancreatic [144]. Endosonographic B-mode for detecting malignant
lymph nodes varies in accuracy between 50 – 100 % [145]. Strain
elastography has the potential to add value to B-mode US, particularly by better targeting lymph nodes or nodal invasion for
biopsy [124, 130, 132, 146]. A meta-analysis calculated a sensitivity of 88 % and a specificity of 85 % of EUS elastography for differentiating between benign and malignant lymph nodes [147].
Nevertheless, a recent study with pathological confirmation for
each lymph node yielded lower values of sensitivity (55 – 59 %),
with a better specificity (82 – 85 %) compared with the performance of standard EUS criteria [127].
Recommendations
▶ Complementing established B-mode criteria EUS strain elastography is useful as an additional tool for discrimination of
benign and malignant lymph nodes.
▶ EUS elastography may be used for identifying the most suspicious lymph node and/or harder lymph node regions suspicious for malignant invasion that should be targeted for EUS
fine needle aspiration biopsy.
Prostate
!
Introduction
The screening standard for prostate abnormalities has been the
combination of digital rectal examination and the serum prostate
specific antigen (PSA) level. However, PSA screening leads to a
substantial number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with no
or indolent cancer who do not need immediate treatment [148]
and has a high false negative rate (17 – 21 %) [149]. Saturation
biopsy (up to 40) can rule out prostate cancer, but has many limitations, including cost and morbidity, and over-diagnosis of microscopic tumor foci [150].
Two different prostate transrectal ultrasound approaches can be
used to identify stiff prostate tissue: strain and shear wave elastography, as described in part 1 [1].
Strain elastography
Hypoechoic stiff lesions of the prostate are suspicious for malignancy [151]. Slight compressions are induced using the transrectal probe. The use of an inflatable balloon has been suggested
to improve standardization of compression applications. The
quality index helps ensure appropriate speed and pressure. The
elastography box should cover the entire gland and the surrounding tissues, but avoid the bladder. Semi-quantitative
information can be derived by measuring the strain ratio
between two regions of interest (usually one considered as
normal and the other abnormal).
By stepwise scanning of the prostate from base to apex, strain
elastography allows detection of stiff regions, and provides stiffness comparisons between lesions and the adjacent prostate
tissue. Most studies report a significant improvement in prostate
cancer identification with strain elastography, including guidance for targeted biopsies [152 – 155]. However, there are still
some controversies and one recent study reported its inability
to differentiate prostate cancer from chronic prostatitis [156].
The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive
predictive value, and accuracy for identifying cancer indexlesions for focal therapy were 58.8 %, 43.3 %, 54.1 %, 48.1 %, and
51.6 %, respectively [157]. Though improvement in biopsy
guidance is reported in many studies [155, 158, 159], others did
not confirm this result [160].
Shear-wave elastography
Unlike strain elastography, SWE requires no compression on the
rectal wall [161]. Optimised settings include maximising penetration and setting up an appropriate scale. As of 2012, only 2DSWE with Aixplorer system is available for transrectal shear wave
speed measurement. The image can cover half the gland in transverse section, so each side of the prostate is scanned separately
from base to apex for review and measurements of elastography
values. For each plane, the transducer is maintained in a steady
position until the image stabilises. Hypoechoic stiff lesions are
suspicious for malignancy. The ratio between the mean elasticity
values of two regions can be calculated.
In young healthy subjects the entire prostate exhibits a uniform
soft appearance with low stiffness values [162, 163]. In benign
prostate hyperplasia, the peripheral zone remains soft and homogeneous, while the central and transition zones become heterogeneous and hard, particularly when there are calcifications. Typical
benign peripheral lesions are as soft as the surrounding normal
parenchyma, while cancers are stiffer [162, 163]. The best cut-off
stiffness value to maximize the negative predictive value for malignant lesions was found to be 35 and 37 kPa in two studies with
2D-SWE [159, 160], providing the best performance of with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 63 %, 91 %, 69.4 %, and 91 %. The
SWE ratio provided more discriminatory values as it takes into account the increased stiffness of the peripheral zone from calcification and chronic prostatitis. The best ratio between the nodule
and the adjacent peripheral gland for benign and malignant lesions
was 1.5 ± 0.9 and 4.0 ± 1.9 respectively (p < 0.002) [162].
Practical advice
No specific patient preparation is required for either technique.
Elastography imaging is conducted after conventional prostate
transrectal ultrasound examination.
Clinical potential
Several studies indicate that elastography provides useful additional information to conventional transrectal ultrasound for
prostate cancer detection. Applications that have been more extensively investigated include characterisation of abnormal areas,
detection of lesions not seen with any previous imaging technique and biopsy targeting.

Practical points
Transrectal Ultrasound Elastography USE is performed with endocavitary probes using a variety of configurations for 2D-SWE or SE.
Limitations and artefacts
Both techniques suffer from intrinsic limitations: not all cancers
are stiff and not all stiff lesions are cancers (particularly in the
presence of calcifications and fibrosis). The transrectal technique carries an intrinsic risk of inadvertently applying excess
precompression because of the end-fire arrangement of the
transducer.
Limitations of strain elastography include the non-uniform force
over the gland, intra- and inter-operator dependency.
2D-SWE has additional limitations such as a slower frame rate
and the small elasticity box which only allows interrogation of
half the gland at a time.
Recommendations
▶ To identify suspicious target regions for biopsy and increase
the positive biopsy rate.
Musculoskeletal
!
Background
Disease alters the biomechanical properties of muscles and
tendons. US elastography has been employed for research in biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system since the early 90 s
[164], however, the technique has only recently been applied in
clinical practice.
Methods
Both strain and SWE elastography can be used to assess musculotendinous structures, but most of the available evidence refers to
the use of strain elastography [165, 166].
Clinical applications
The Achilles tendon has been the most studied musculoskeletal
structure with strain elastography. Based on three prospective
studies examining 50, 80 and 25 asymptomatic subjects using
strain elastography, the Achilles tendons are usually hard (87 –
93 %) or may contain soft areas or stripes parallel to the long axis
of the tendon, [167 – 169]. Alterations in strain elastograms of
asymptomatic Achilles tendons mainly occur in the mid-portion,
they do not always correspond to changes on conventional US
and their nature is not yet clarified: they may correspond to early
abnormalities or be false positive findings [167 – 169]. The reproducibility of strain elastography for the normal Achilles tendon
has been found to be good to excellent using a qualitative twoor three-level scale [167, 168] and poor (variation 29–37 %) using
semi-quantitative measurements (strain ratio) [167]. In symptomatic chronic Achilles tendinopathy, the tendons usually contain
large, well-delineated soft regions, corresponding to areas of
mucoid degeneration and partial ruptures, whereas in surgically
repaired Achilles tendon ruptures, regions of increased stiffness
may be a consequence of tendon healing [168, 169]. The overall
correlation between US and strain elastography findings in
symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy has been reported to be
good [168, 169]. The clinical value of method in managing
patients with tendinopathy has not yet been examined. However,
in a recent cadaveric study, elastography detected histologically
verified tendon degeneration in all 14 Achilles tendon segments,
whereas B-mode ultrasound could detect only 85.7 %, suggesting
that elastography might be able to detect signs of histopathological degeneration of Achilles tendinosis more sensitively than
B-mode [172]. There is no published data on the clinical use of
shear wave elastography for the Achilles tendon.
Strain elastography of normal relaxed muscle shows an inhomogeneous pattern of intermediate or high stiffness with a few scattered soft areas mainly around muscle borders [173, 174].
The clinical value of strain elastography in muscle spasticity has
been evaluated in three studies including small numbers of patients with cerebral spasticity (7, 15 and 17 patients). The studies
showed that the combination of strain elastography with clinical
scale assessments can diagnose muscle stiffness changes and
monitor the effect of rehabilitation therapy [174 – 176].
Recommendations
▶ Strain elastography can be used as a supplementary tool to
conventional US scanning to increase the diagnostic confidence in diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy.
▶ Strain elastography can be used to depict stiffness changes in
congenital muscle spasticity.
Practical points
To minimize intra-observer variation and avoid transient temporal
fluctuations in the Achilles tendon, the scoring or the measurements should be based on examination of entire cine-loops rather
than on single static images. It is recommended to store several (at
least 3) compression-relaxation cycles and then select the best
elastograms for evaluation. The probe should be perpendicular to
the tissue to avoid anisotropy, as the B-mode appearance influences the quality of the elastograms. Overlapping images should be
acquired when examining the length of the Achilles tendon, to
allow for stiffness artefacts at the ends of each elastogram.
In the cases of the Achilles tendon, where there is little overlying
subcutaneous fat, and when a minimum depth from the skin is
needed to place the ROI, gel pads or probe adaptors can be
employed. The use of stand-off devices for strain elastography of
the Achilles tendon has been shown not to influence the elastogram [171], as opposed to the inclusion of gel within the ROI,
which should be avoided, as it increases the scatter of the relative
stiffness values and may mask minimal differences in tendon
stiffness [165].
Artefacts
Artefacts encountered in strain elastography of the muscles and
tendons include fluctuant changes within the Achilles tendon
and at muscle borders, possibly due to stress and strain concentration between tendon fibres as well as at the borders the
Achilles tendon in axial elastograms because of varying contact
with the skin.
Future perspectives
!
As befits a new method, elastography is being used in new applications which as yet lack sufficient strength of evidence to justify
their inclusion in these Recommendations, though their exclusion should not be taken as implying that they may not prove to
be of clinical value once more experience is gained. The topics
below are an incomplete list of those that are of clinical interest
but whose clinical value is still to be confirmed.

Elastography of superficial lymph nodes, for example in the neck
or inguinal regions, is a promising application, where an increase
in stiffness would be expected in malignancy but might also
occur in inflamed nodes [177, 178].
Intraoperative elastography has been applied to the brain to
guide the surgeon to stiffer regions that represent tumours and
improve the precision of their resection [179, 180].
Elastography of the uterine cervix to assess the softening that
precedes normal dilatation before delivery is potentially important. Premature delivery is a major cause of fetal death, which
could be reduced if a simple and reliable means of identifying
premature softening could be developed [181].
Testicular tumours are harder than the surrounding gland on
palpation and this might be a useful application of elastography
to aid the distinction between the commoner malignancies and
the rarer less invasive tumours such as Leydig cell tumours,
which can be managed with tissue-sparing surgery [182].
Anal incontinence, most commonly an obstetrical injury, leads to
scarring which is stiffer than the normal sphincter muscles; a
preliminary report focusses on the presurgical findings, with
promising results [128] whereas postoperative evaluation was
disappointing [183]. Elastography has been used in rectal and
anal carcinomas where it improves the discrimination between
adenoma and cancer [129] and the differentiation of T2 and T3
stages of rectal cancer. Although this improved differentiation has
so far not been evaluated, it seems convincing because inflammatory changes appear softer than the usually harder tumours.
Perineal ultrasound is an effective method for imaging perianal
inflammatory lesions (e. g. in Crohn's disease) but is too rarely
used. Generally speaking, acute inflammatory lesions are softer
and chronic lesions harder in comparison to the surrounding tissue [184].
Arterial and plaque stiffness has been studied in preliminary
investigations [135, 185, 186] and might form a clinically useful
way to assess vulnerable plaque.
Promising results have been reported on the clinical use of SE for
tendon disease such as for common extensor origin tendons in
order to depict tendon and fascia involvement in lateral epicondylitis [187], for plantar fascia where stiffness changes with age
and disease [188] and for trigger finger, where there is increased
stiffness of the flexor tendon which decreases after steroid injections [189]. Preliminary studies also show the potential use of
strain elastography in localising myofascial trigger points to inject with botulin toxin [190] and for diagnosing and monitoring
of inflammatory myopathies by showing changes in muscle stiffness in correlation with elevated serum markers [173]. Preliminary data are available on stiffness measurements and shear wave
velocities of normal muscle and tendon using shear wave techniques [175, 191].
Other applications will no doubt emerge as more experience is
gathered.
