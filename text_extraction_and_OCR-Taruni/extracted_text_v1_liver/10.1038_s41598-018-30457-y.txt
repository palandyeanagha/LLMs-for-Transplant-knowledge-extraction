Fibrosis, resulted from the imbalance of fbrogenesis and fbrolysis, is a key readout of disease 
progression in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and refects mortality risk. Non-invasive biomarkers 
capable of diagnosing fbrosis stages and monitoring fbrosis changes in NASH patients are urgently 
needed. This study is to evaluate collagen formation and degradation biomarkers, refective of 
fbrogenesis or fbrolysis, in patients with biopsy proven NASH. Collagen formation biomarker PRO-C3 
and PRO-C6 levels were signifcantly higher in patients with advanced fbrosis stage 3–4 than those 
with fbrosis stage 0–2. Elevated PRO-C3 levels were also associated with severe lobular infammation 
and ballooning, but not with steatosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identifed PRO-C3 and 
PRO-C6 to be independently related to fbrosis stage. PRO-C3 showed similar performance to identify 
patients with advanced fbrosis in discovery and validation cohorts. Furthermore, in a longitudinal 
study cohort with paired biopsies, mean PRO-C3 increased with worsening of fbrosis and decreased 
with fbrosis improvement. The results suggest that PRO-C3 may be a potentially useful biomarker in 
identifying patients with advanced fbrosis and active fbrogenesis, as well as in assessing changes in 
fbrosis over time. It is worthy of further evaluation to confrm its diagnostic value and clinical utility.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) afects over a quarter of adults in North America1
. It has two principal 
phenotypes: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH 
is increasing in prevalence as an etiology for end-stage liver disease and also hepatocellular carcinoma, and is 
anticipated to increase the need for liver transplantation2
, particularly as there is no currently approved therapy 
for NASH.
A key component of the assessment of NASH is the determination of the extent of liver fbrosis, which has 
been linked to the risk of mortality and liver-related clinical outcomes3,4
. NASH patients with fbrosis stage 2 or 
greater, especially those with advanced fbrosis (stage 3–4), are at increased risk of death3
. A major barrier to identify this subset of patients is the need for a liver biopsy to defne the presence of NASH with moderate-advanced 
fbrosis (stage 2–3). Liver biopsies are invasive and occasionally associated with severe morbidity5
. Moreover, 
interpretation of liver biopsy sections is limited by sampling variability and both intra- and inter-observer variability in assessment6,7
. Tese carry the potential harm to patients and are also a barrier to recruitment to clinical 
trials. Tere is thus an urgent need to develop non-invasive tools for the assessment of the liver fbrosis in those 
with suspected NAFLD.
Few non-invasive biomarkers indirectly associated with fbrosis stages in NASH, such as FIB-4, aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), have been 
extensively studied8–11. Recently, there has been growing interest in interrogating the biomarkers that directly

refect the process of fbrogenesis and fbrolysis to fully understand the dynamic nature of fbrosis. N-terminal 
pro-peptide of type III collagen (PIIINP) has been reported as a biomarker of tissue repair and liver fbrosis in a 
number of liver diseases12–15. However, a number of diferent PIIINP assays have been used in these studies and 
the antibodies used in these assays are not specifc to the epitope at the cleavage site, thus the measured PIIINP 
may not truly refect the levels of the cleaved pro-peptide. Te quantifcation of circulating collagen fragments 
with unique epitopes released during collagen formation and degradation may have value in determining the 
extent and direction of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. A number of collagen fragments refecting collagen formation, including PRO-C3 (N-terminal pro-collagen III peptide), PRO-C5 (C-terminal pro-peptide of 
type V collagen), PRO-C6 (C-terminal pro-peptide of type VI collagen) and basement membrane biomarker 
P4NP7S (7 S domain of type IV collagen), and those representing collagen degradation including C3M (Matrix 
Metalloprotease (MMP) degradation fragment of collagen III) and C4M (MMP degradation fragment of collagen 
IV), have been evaluated in preclinical models and patients16–18. Unlike the case of PIIINP, the PRO-C3 assay 
developed by Nordic Bioscience uses an antibody specifcally recognizing the neo-epitope at the cleavage site, 
therefore PRO-C3 may be more refective of the synthesis of type III collagen and fbrogenesis19. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who had higher baseline PRO-C3 levels (≥20.2ng/ml) showed progression (worsening) of fbrosis while those with lower PRO-C3 did not progress19,20. Further, PRO-C3, PRO-C5 and C4M have 
also been correlated with hepatic venous pressure gradient which is an invasive diagnostic and prognostic marker 
in cirrhosis for portal hypertension21,22. However, these collagen fragments have not been evaluated in patients 
with NASH.
Te current study represents an initial assessment of a panel of collagen neo-epitope biomarkers (PRO-C3, 
P4NP7S, PRO-C5, PRO-C6, C3M, and C4M) to determine their relationship to fbrosis stage in a population of 
subjects with NAFLD and the full spectrum of fbrosis. Te study included both a cross-sectional cohort and a 
longitudinal cohort with blood samples obtained at the time of liver biopsy.
Results
Characteristics of the study population for cross sectional analysis. Twenty-three patients with 
simple steatosis (NAFL) and 141 patients with NASH were included in this study as a discovery cohort. Te 
NASH cohort had fbrosis stages from F0 to F4 (Table 1) and NAS from 1–7. Te study cohort had a mean age of 
53.2 years and comprised mostly of females (67.7%). Clinical characteristics, including albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and platelets, were 
available for a majority of the patients. Patients with F3-4 fbrosis tended to be older, had lower albumin and 
platelets, higher bilirubin, ALP and AST. However, there was no diference in ALT among the groups.
Serum collagen fragment levels and association with histological scores in NAFLD. In this 
cohort of NAFLD patients, PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 levels were correlated to each other (R=0.57, p<0.0001)), 
while the levels of C3M, C4M, P4NP7S and PRO-C5 were highly correlated with each other (Figure S1). All collagen biomarkers showed signifcant association with fbrosis stages (Table 2) with p<0.0001 for both PRO-C3 and 
PRO-C6. In particular, PRO-C3 levels were signifcantly higher in patients with F3 or F4 than those with F0-F2 
(Fig. 1a). In addition, PRO-C3 levels were also signifcantly higher in patients with severe lobular infammation 
or hepatocellular ballooning degeneration (Fig. 1b). However, PRO-C3 levels were not associated with steatosis 
grade (Fig. 1c). Although PRO-C6 levels were signifcantly associated with fbrosis stages, it was only signifcantly 
higher in patients with F3-4 when compared to those with F0 or F2, but not with F1 due to variability in the latter 
group (Fig. 1d). Unlike PRO-C3, PRO-C6 had no correlation with lobular infammation or ballooning although 
they both showed no association with or steatosis (Figure S2a–c). Median PRO-C3 levels in F3-4 (23.6ng/ml)

higher than that in F0-2 (7.3ng/ml). Neither PRO-C3 nor PRO-C6 was able to diferentiate F4 from F3. Higher 
levels of C4M, C3M and P4NP7S were only observed when comparing F3-4 with F0 or F2, but not with F1 possibly due to greater variability in the F1 group (Figure S3). PRO-C5 did not show consistent elevation in F3 and F4. 
None of the collagen biomarkers showed signifcant diference between F2 and F0-1.

Performance of serum collagen fragments to discriminate fbrosis stages in NAFLD. Univariate 
analysis demonstrated that high levels of all measured collagen biomarkers were risk factors for advanced fbrosis 
(F3-4) (Table 3). However, in multivariate analysis adjusting for available clinical characteristics, among collagen fragments only PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 remained signifcantly and independently related to advanced fbrosis 
(Table 3). Tey were further evaluated by performing Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis 
(Table S1 and Figure S4). PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 had the highest AUROC (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve) (0.74 for PRO-C3 and 0.73 for PRO-C6) to diferentiate F3-4 from F0-2. Combination of PRO-C3 
and PRO-C6 only slightly improved performance to identify F3-4 (AUROC 0.77). A cutof of 20.9 ng/ml for 
PRO-C3 was obtained to discriminate advanced fbrosis using ROC Youden index, which is very close to the 
cutof (20.2ng/ml) reported in patients with hepatitis C19. By applying the cutof of ≥20.9ng/ml in this NAFLD 
cohort, PRO-C3 could identify patients with advanced fbrosis (F3-4) with sensitivity of 57% and specifcity of 
84%, and identify patients with signifcant fbrosis (F2-4) with sensitivity of 46% and specifcity of 90%.
Te performance of PRO-C3 and PRO-6 to identify patients with advanced fbrosis was further validated in 
an independent cohort. Te baseline data set from a longitudinal cohort of 41 patients with baseline fbrosis stage 
from 1–3 was used for an independent validation (Table S2). In this cohort, only PRO-C3 levels were signifcantly 
associated with fbrosis stages (Table S3). Te AUROC of PRO-C3 to discriminate patients with advanced fbrosis 
from those with F1-2 was approximately 0.75 (Figure S5), which is very similar to the AUROC in the discovery 
cohort (Table S1). Similar to the performance in the discovery cohort, the cutof of 20.9ng/ml identifed in the 
discovery cohort can identify patients with advanced fbrosis in the validation cohort with a sensitivity of 57% 
and specifcity of 79%.
We further explored the performance of simple scores such as FIB-4 in this cohort. FIB-4 data were only 
available in a subset of patients (n=96). In this sub-cohort, FIB-4 and PRO-C3 levels were moderately correlated 
(Spearman correlation with R2=0.29, p<0.0001) (Figure S6). FIB-4 had an AUROC of 0.82 to discriminate 
patients with advanced fbrosis from those with F0-2. PRO-C3 had AUROC of 0.74, which is very similar to the 
performance in the whole cohort.
Association of longitudinal changes of PRO-C3 with changes in fbrosis stage. A longitudinal 
cohort of 41 patients with baseline and follow up biopsies were identifed to explore whether the collagen biomarkers are related to fbrosis progression/regression. Te patients were followed up for an average of 3.5 years 
ranging from 1–10 years. Te status of fbrosis stages of these patients at baseline and follow up visits are shown in 
Table 4. Nine patients had progression/worsening (≥1 stage increase in fbrosis), ffeen patients had regression/
improvement (≤1 stage decrease in fbrosis) and sixteen patients had no change. Baseline clinical characteristics 
and average follow up durations were not signifcantly diferent among the three groups (Table 5). Among all 
collagen biomarkers measured, only PRO-C3 levels were signifcantly higher in patients with advanced fbrosis 
(F3) at both baseline and follow up visits (Table S3, Figure S7).
We evaluated whether the changes of collagen biomarkers were associated with changes in fbrosis stage. Te 
mean percent change of PRO-C3 in the group showing improvement (or regression) in fbrosis was approximately −20%, which is signifcantly lower than that in the groups with stable (25%) or worsening (64%) fbrosis 
(Fig. 2a). Te changes of PRO-C3 for individual patients by fbrosis stage change are shown in Fig. 2b. For the 
patients with improvement in fbrosis, 9 out of 15 patients (60%) had a decrease of PRO-C3 by more than 15% 
(an arbitrary cutof based on the reported 10% inter-assay variability)23. Interestingly, 8 out of the 9 patients with 
≥15% decrease of PRO-C3 in the fbrosis improvement/regression group had baseline PRO-C3 levels greater

the group with stable fbrosis than that with improved fbrosis (Figure S8).
Discussion
To our knowledge, the current study represents the frst to assess the diagnostic performance of circulating collagen fragments refective of fbrogenesis or fbrolysis to determine the fbrosis stage in patients with NAFLD. 
Elevated PRO-C3 levels were signifcantly associated with advanced fbrosis stage in both discovery and validation cohort. In addition, higher PRO-C3 levels were associated with higher grade of lobular infammation and 
ballooning, suggesting that PRO-C3 levels may be refective of active disease. Furthermore, decrease of PRO-C3 
over time was associated with improvement (or regression) in fbrosis.
A ROC curve is an established method for evaluating the clinical validity of a biomarker. In this study, 
AUROC for PRO-C3 was approximately 0.74, which is much lower than the AUROCs reported for transient 
elastography and Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)24 and is also lower than FIB-4 in a sub-cohort in this 
study. However, the relevance of ROC is linked to the accuracy of the reference standard (which in this case is 
liver biopsy) and its interpretation. Even in excellent hands, liver biopsy can misclassify fbrosis stage in up to 20% 
of subjects6,7
. In addition, ROC weigh false positives and false negatives equally and do not provide information 
on the predictive values needed when used clinically. Furthermore, unlike elastography which measures liver 
stifness, PRO-C3 measures active collagen formation refective of fbrogenesis, but not exactly the fbrosis area 
in the liver. Tis may be one of the reasons to explain the lower performance of PRO-C3 than MRE in identifying fbrosis measured by histology. Te cutof of ≥20.9 ng/ml for PRO-C3 derived from ROC analysis had low 
sensitivity (57%) and moderate specifcity (79%), suggesting that nearly 40% of the cases with advanced fbrosis 
would be missed while nearly 20% of the cases may be misclassifed. Te modest performance of PRO-C3 in discriminating advanced fbrosis suggest that PRO-C3 as a single marker is sub-optimal for diagnosing static fbrosis 
stages. However, a combination of PRO-C3 with other biomarkers refecting underlying pathophysiology of the 
disease may improve the diagnostic performance. Again, our data suggest that PRO-C3 may be more valuable for 
identifying patients with active fbrogenesis than diagnosing static disease stages.
Some patients with advanced fbrosis may have less active disease with old scars, and thus may have low levels 
of PRO-C3. Tis may explain the normal levels of PRO-C3 in some F3-4 patients. One would predict that such 
patients would have a lower risk of fbrosis progression if PRO-C3 levels stay low. Tis is supported by the data 
that patients with chronic hepatitis C having higher PRO-C3 demonstrated a higher rate of fbrosis progression 
than those having lower PRO-C319. Interestingly, for patients showing improvement in fbrosis in the longitudinal 
cohort, PRO-C3 decreased over time in those with higher baseline PRO-C3 levels (>16ng/ml), suggesting that

fbrosis in patients with active tissue remodeling (as refected by higher PRO-C3 levels), would regress if PRO-C3 
levels were decreased, possibly resulting from the removal or reduction of the insults causing tissue injury. If there 
were repetitive insults, persistent tissue remodeling as refected by sustained elevation of PRO-C3, would lead to 
fbrosis progression over time. Although in this small study cohort, both stable and progressive fbrosis groups 
had an increase in mean PRO-C3, it is possible some patients in the stable group may progress if the follow up 
time were extended. Although FIB-4 had better diagnostic performance for fbrosis staging, change in FIB-4 at 
follow up had no correlation with changes in fbrosis stages in this study cohort (data not shown), indicating that 
PRO-C3 may be a more sensitive biomarker to monitor disease progression/regression.
One patient who showed marked decrease of PRO-C3 (from 71 to 9.8 ng/ml) (Fig. 2b) in the fbrosis progression group also had a decrease in ALT (from 160 to 47U/L) and AST (from 132 to 51 U/L). Tis patient 
progressed from F1 to F3 and had only grade 1 steatosis, infammation and ballooning at baseline and follow-up. 
Te duration between baseline and follow up biopsies was approximately four years. It is not known how long 
PRO-C3 and ALT had remained elevated afer baseline visit and when they started to decline. It is possible that 
the patient may have progressed to F3 and stayed stable before the follow up visit. Unfortunately serum samples were not available between baseline and follow up to evaluate the kinetics for PRO-C3 change. We cannot 
exclude the possibility that this particular patient may have acute liver injury on top of NASH to drive the disease 
progression.
One key consideration in the assessment of any biomarker is the biological plausibility of its relationship to the 
pathological or physiological condition it measures. Te use of collagen fragments for the assessment of fbrotic 
disorders is now well established16,18,19,22,23,25,26. Type III collagen, one of the main components in interstitial 
matrix, is secreted by fbroblasts and other mesenchymal cells, playing an important role in infammation-fbrosis 
associated pathologies in tissue injury27. PIIINP, measured by a number of assays, has been reported as a marker 
of tissue repair and liver fbrosis in some liver diseases12–15. PIIINP is also a component of Enhanced Liver Fibrosis 
(ELF), a calculated index consisting of PIIINP, hyaluronic acid and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 
1(TIMP 1)28. ELF has demonstrated variable performance (AUROC 0.76–0.9) in identifying NASH patients with 
advanced fbrosis10,15,29. Tanwar et al. reported that PIIINP levels measured in ELF test were signifcantly elevated 
in a cohort of NAFLD patients with advanced fbrosis compared to those with F0-2, and had an AUROC of 0.85 
to distinguish simple steatosis vs NASH or F3-415, however, the study did not specifcally compare F0-2 vs F3-4 in 
NASH patients. It is worthwhile to compare the performance of PIIINP and PRO-C3 in future studies. It should 
be pointed out that diferent assays, such as ELISA30,31, radioimmunoassay (RIA)12,13 and immunoassays using 
magnetic particle separation technique15,32,33, or automated ADVIA Centaur immunoassay34, have been used to 
measure serum “PIIINP” in reported studies. It has been demonstrated that there are almost two fold diference 
in the measured levels of PIIINP when UniQ RIA assay, which has been widely used, was compared with the 
new ADVIA Centaur immunoassay which has been tested as a component in ELF test by Siemens Healthcare 
Diagnostic34. It is almost impossible to evaluate PIIINP levels across studies due to the lack of standardized assay. 
PIIINP antibodies employed in these assays were not disclosed and may not be specifc to the pro-peptide cleavage site, thus the measured PIIINP may not truly refect cleaved pro-peptide. Te PRO-C3 assay uses an antibody 
specifcally recognizing the neo-epitope that is exposed upon cleavage, therefore PRO-C3 may be more refective 
of the synthesis of type III collagen and fbrogenesis19. It is interesting also to note that, in the our cross sectional 
cohort, PRO-C3 levels were signifcantly related to lobular infammation and hepatocellular ballooning providing 
more evidence to the concept that disease activity and fbrogenesis are biologically related.
PRO-C6, which is the C-terminal pro-peptide of collagen VI and is highly expressed in adipose tissue, is a 
newly identifed adipokine called endotrophin35. Endotrophin has been shown to promote adipose tissue fbrosis36.

Tis is the frst study showing the correlation of PRO-C6 with PRO-C3 and liver fbrosis. Although the association with fbrosis was not signifcant in the small validation cohort, a trend of higher PRO-C6 was observed in F3 
(p=0.07, table S3). It is possible that the association of PRO-C6 with liver fbrosis is indirect and is attributed to 
the link of adipose fbrosis and liver damage37.
Tere are at least two specifc contexts of application where PRO-C3 could be used: to identify patients with 
active fbrogenesis and advanced fbrosis (stage 3 and 4); to monitor the changes in fbrosis stage over time. Te 
small data set presented in this analysis demonstrates that changes in PRO-C3 may distinguish between those 
who regressed versus those who progressed. But the failure to separate those with stable disease from those who 
progressed may be due to the small sample size and heterogeneous baseline fbrosis stages, hence the need for 
continued eforts to optimize the use of this and other biomarkers for this purpose.
Tere are several limitations for this study. One major limitation is that this is a retrospective analysis of samples collected over a long period of time (up to 10 years). Even though the samples were stored in −80 °C, the stability of the biomarkers over this long period has not been tested. Te baseline visits from longitudinal cohort was 
used to validate the performance of PRO-C3, and this cohort is enriched with patients with F1-2 stages, which is 
not an ideal validation cohort. Unfortunately, metabolic parameters (such as HbA1c, insulin resistance, triglyceride) that are high risk factors for NASH development were only tested in less than 20% of the patients at the time 
of biopsy and sample collection. Terefore we were not able to include these parameters in multivariate analysis. 
Te longitudinal study cohort is very small and has heterogeneous baseline fbrosis stages and follow up duration, 
which limits further analysis. Majority of the patients in the stable fbrosis group had F1-2 at baseline and there 
was no F3 patient in the worsening group, which may lead to bias in analysis. Te patients were enrolled as part 
of a study on the natural history of NAFLD, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility of potential confounding 
factors, such as comorbidities, medications, and diurnal or day to day changes that may afect the analysis.
In summary, the current study is the frst to evaluate the association of collagen fragments with fbrosis stage 
in those with NAFLD. Te data indicate that PRO-C3 may have potential utility to identify patients with active 
fbrogenesis and to monitor fbrosis changes in patient care or clinical trial. While much further work is needed 
before the clinical utility of PRO-C3 is established for NAFLD, the current studies are encouraging and provide 
a strong rationale for future studies to further validate PRO-C3 as a biomarker to diagnose and monitor liver 
fbrosis.
Materials and Methods
Tis work represents an analysis of plasma samples obtained on the day of liver biopsies performed for the assessment of suspected or known NAFLD. Tese samples were obtained as part of a study on the natural history of 
NAFLD and with the aim to also evaluate circulating factors associated with changes in disease phenotype over 
time. Te study was carried out in accordance with approved guidelines by the Institutional Review Boards at 
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU IRB 1960) and all subjects provided informed consent.
Study Populations. Two sets of subjects were studied as part of the project. Te cross-sectional set included 
individuals with known or suspected NAFLD who were undergoing a standard of care liver biopsy to assess their 
liver histology and whose biopsy demonstrated the presence of NAFLD. Tis cohort was used as discovery cohort 
to evaluate the performance of biomarkers to diferentiate fbrosis stages. A second independent longitudinal set 
included a group of individuals, on whom baseline liver biopsy and samples were available, who underwent a 
follow up liver biopsy for assessment of disease progression as part of standard of care. Baseline values from this 
cohort were used as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the performance of PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 to 
identify advanced fbrosis.
Case Defnitions. NAFLD was confrmed by histology in all cases. Te nonalcoholic nature of the liver 
disease was assessed clinically from a history of consumption of alcohol below the thresholds commonly used 
(≤20 gm/day for women and ≤30 gm/day for men)38. Subjects were classifed to have either NAFL (simple steatosis or steatosis with minimal infammation) or NASH. For purposes of this analysis, both borderline and 
defnite steatohepatitis were considered as steatohepatitis. Te disease activity was scored using the NASH CRN 
NAFLD activity score (NAS)39. Te fbrosis stage 0–4 was also classifed using the NASH CRN fbrosis staging 
system. Te sub-stages of stage 1 were combined as a single stage. All biopsies were read by hepato-pathologists 
(Michael Idowu and Melissa J Contos) who were masked to the results of the fbrosis markers. Where there were 
inconsistencies in the reading of a biopsy sample, both pathologists consulted with each other to give a common 
consensus opinion.
Sample collection and analysis. Serum samples collected on the day of the liver biopsy (before the procedure) were stored at −80 °C within 1–2hours of blood collection until laboratory analysis. Sample analysis was 
performed by Nordic Biosciences (Denmark) without access to any clinical or histological information associated 
with any sample using previously published immunoassays21–23,25. Te inter-assay (plate-to-plate consistency) 
and intra-assay (repeat testing of the same sample) variabilities for these biomarkers were up to 12% and 5%, 
respectively21.
Data collection and statistical analysis. Clinical data were extracted from medical records and stored 
in a de-identifed data set in an electronic spreadsheet. Metabolic parameters including glucose, triglyceride, 
LDL and HDL were not tested for most of the patients at the visit for biopsy, therefore, were not available for the 
analysis. Te histology was scored and entered in to a separate spreadsheet. A third spreadsheet with identifers 
connecting each sample identifer to a given subject was maintained in a secure HIPAA-compliant institutional 
server behind appropriate frewalls. Te clinical, histological and laboratory data were merged and sent to the

statisticians with only a study ID number for each sample. Data analysis was performed by the statistician and 
fully reviewed by the investigators.
Te non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare the biomarker levels across fbrosis stages, the grade 
of steatosis, lobular infammation and ballooning. An overall AUC (Area under curve) was constructed. In addition, the performance of PRO-C3 to distinguish F0-2 vs F3-4 was assessed using ROC Youden cutof of 20.9ng/ml 
and was further validated in an independent cohort.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, assessing available clinical parameters and collagen 
fragment concentrations, were generated to relate to advanced fbrosis stage (Stage 3–4). Variable selection in 
multivariable model was conducted using forward stepwise selection and best prediction criteria, as determined 
by leave one out cross validation.
Complete case methods were used in all statistical assessments (missing data were not imputed). For the 
multivariable model, variables with at least 140 non-missing values were included. As a result, across all variables 
used in the model, there were 136 subjects with complete cases, compared to 164 subjects in the overall data set. 
Data were log transformed prior to logistic modeling, when appropriate. Statistical analyses were conducted using 
SAS 9.2 and R 3.2.2.
For the longitudinal cohort, pairwise comparisons were performed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test.
