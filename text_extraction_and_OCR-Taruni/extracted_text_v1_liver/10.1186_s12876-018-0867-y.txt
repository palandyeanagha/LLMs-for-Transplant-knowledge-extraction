Multivisceral IgG4-related disease
presenting as recurrent massive
gastrointestinal bleeding: a case
report and literature review
Xuexue Deng, Ronghua Fang* , Jianshu Zhang and Rongqiong Li
Abstract
Background: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly recognized autoimmune systemic disorder characterized by
elevated levels of serum IgG4 and abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasmacytes in the affected organs. The
liver, biliary system and pancreas are the most commonly affected organs. However, involvement of the digestive
tract is very rare. To date, only a few cases of isolated gastric IgG4-RD have been reported.
Case presentation: We present a case of IgG4-RD of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas and duodenum, which was
clinically misinterpreted and thereafter over-treated. A 52-year-old male presented with obstructive jaundice for 3
years, melena for 5 months and hematemesis for 10 days. Three years prior, the patient had undergone biopsies of
pancreatic lesions, liver lesions, cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy. Histopathology showed chronic
inflammatory changes. Endoscopy at admission revealed a duodenal ulcer with active bleeding. Despite medical
management, the patient presented with repeated gastrointestinal bleeding. Upon evaluation, serum IgG4 levels were
found to be elevated. Histopathology of the duodenal ulcer biopsy and repeated examination of the gallbladder and
pancreatic and liver biopsies confirmed IgG4 positive plasma cell infiltration. A definitive diagnosis of IgG4-RD was
made and steroid administration was initiated. At last follow up, 11 months to-the-day after initiating steroid
treatment, the patient was asymptomatic.
Conclusions: Notably, IgG4-RD of multiple digestive organs is still very rare. As a systemic disease, it is characterized
by the infiltration of IgG4-bearing plasma cells and raised IgG4 levels. Histopathology findings remain the diagnostic
gold standard for this disorder.

Background
IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a relatively recently
recognized chronic multi-organ autoimmune disease of
unknown origin with a tendency to develop lesions at
multiple sites throughout the body [1]. It is known to
affect various organs including the bile duct, pancreas,
gallbladder, liver, lungs and salivary glands. It is characterized by elevated IgG4 levels in the serum and the affected
tissues, lymphoproliferative infiltration and sclerotic fibrosis [2, 3]. Other typical features are occlusive phlebitis and
rising IgG4-plasma cells levels [4, 5]. Clinically, it mimics
malignancy in some patients, especially those with liver
and pancreatic lesions and is often thought to necessitate
surgical resection, sometimes leading to over-treatment
[6, 7]. To date, only a few isolated cases of digestive
IgG4-RD have been reported.
Case presentation
A 52-year-old male from southwest China presented
with obstructive jaundice for 3 years, melena for
5 months and hematemesis for 10 days. The patient had
been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 4 years,
which was treated with metformin. The patient was a

chronic tobacco (10 cigarettes per day) and alcohol consumer over the previous 20 years but had quit smoking and
drinking for the past 3 years. Three years prior to admission
to our hospital, he developed obstructive jaundice, which
was investigated with abdominal computed tomography
(CT) and revealed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver
and pancreatic head mass. He underwent cholecystectomy,
choledochojejunostomy and biopsies from the liver and
pancreatic lesions. Histopathology revealed chronic cholecystitis with lymphocytic, plasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltration of the gallbladder, liver and pancreatic parenchyma.
The physical examination was unremarkable (height −
165 cm, weight – 50 kg). Laboratory tests revealed
hemoglobin levels of 75 g/L, a platelet count of 80 × 109
/L,
30.0 g/L albumin levels, and serum potassium levels of
3.20 mmol/L (Table 1). The fecal occult blood was positive.
On the day of admission, the patient developed repeated painless hematemesis of about 2100 mL, which
was associated with hypotension and tachycardia. He
was resuscitated with intravenous, blood and norepinephrine infusions. Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin
levels of 47.5 g/L, platelet count levels of 38 × 109 L and

patient again developed hematemesis of about 500 mL,
for which he was treated with somatostatin, terlipressin
and pantoprazole infusion. Sengstaken-Blakemore tube
were placed to hemostasis by compression and tube
feeding hemostatic medicine. After 4 days of medical
intervention, the patient’s gastrointestinal bleeding gradually stopped. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a
duodenal ulcer (A1 stage) with active bleeding, gastric
mucosal erosions and esophageal varices (mild). Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen
with three-dimensional reconstruction exposed multiple
nodular dense shadows with dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in the tail region (Fig. 1d). Images of the
liver showed numerous hypodense nodules with mild
contrast enhancement, ascites and intrahepatic bile duct
dilatation (Fig. 1a). Additionally, there were multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament
around the abdominal aorta (Fig. 1b) and mesenteric
lymph nodes with bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1c). In

portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure was performed
under local anesthesia and regional portal hypertension,
splenic vein and portal vein obstruction were detected.
Subsequently, the patient re-bleed both 14 days and
20 days after admission, about 600 mL and 400 mL,
respectively. The patient was treated with somatostatin, pantoprazole infusion and blood transfusion.
Gastroscopy identified an ulcer (1.5 cm × 1.2 cm) in
the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb that was not
actively bleeding (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). Pathological examination of the ulcer biopsy verified a moderate degree
of chronic mucosal inflammation.
When investigating the recurrent bleeds, serum
IgG4(0.035–1.500 g/L)and IgG(8~ 15.5 g/L)were found
to be 29.200 g/L and 24.50 g/ L respectively and IgG4
disease was suspected (Table 1). The patient’s prior surgical pathology specimens were retrieved for IgG4 immunohistochemical examination. Immunohistochemical
staining revealed increased IgG-positive and IgG4-positive plasma cells in the liver lesions (IgG4 positive cells
30–60/ high power field (HPF); Fig. 3b), pancreas (IgG4
positive cells 30–80/HPF; Fig. 3d) and gallbladder (IgG4
positive cells 30–80/HPF; Fig. 3f). Staining of the duodenum ulcer biopsy also showed more than 100
IgG4-positive cells per HPF (Fig. 3h). Based on these
findings, a definitive diagnosis of IgG4-RD was made.
The patient was administered 40 mg/d prednisone
intravenously for 7 days without any side effects
followed by oral prednisolone 40 mg/d for 1 week.
Laboratory tests indicated a reduction in the serum
IgG4 levels 8 days after initiating prednisone but the
liver function continued to be impaired (Table 1). As the
patient improved symptomatically, he was discharged on
a regime of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil.
Since discharge until the time of writing, during the 11
monthly visits since starting steroid therapy, laboratory tests
indicate significant improvements in the patient’s serum
IgG4 subtype, liver function and hemogram tests (Table 1).
Discussion and conclusions
IgG4-RD was first described in patients with sclerosing
cholangitis, known as autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)
type I. Subsequently, IgG4-RD was found to affect other
organs [6]. At present IgG4-RD is believed to be a systemic disease and diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD [8, 9]
include: (1) single or multiple organs with diffuse or localized swelling, masses, nodules and/or hypertrophic lesions; (2) elevated serum IgG4 levels (≥135 mg/dL); and
(3) histopathologic features that include marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis, with
IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration (IgG4/IgG positive cell ratio of 40% and IgG4-positive plasma cells
exceeding 10/HPF). Diagnosis of IgG4-related is confirmed when all of the following are fulfilled: (1), (2)
and (3). Diagnosis is likely if criteria (1) + (3) are fulfilled, possible if (1) + (2) are fulfilled and unlikely if
only (1) presents.
Notably, the biliary tract and pancreas are the organs
most frequently affected by IgG4-RD [10]. Few studies
have reported isolated cases of IgG4-RD in other digestive organs, such as in the esophagus, stomach, liver or
duodenum [7].
A recent review of IgG4-RD cases reporting on gastrointestinal lesions showed that most patients present with
multiple organ disease involvement, including the stomach, duodenum, liver, bile duct, esophagus, jejunum,
lymph nodes and pancreas (Table 2). Six patients presented with obstructive jaundice as the main clinical
manifestation [11–16] and others presented with varied
clinical symptoms [17–28]. Gastrointestinal bleeding was
not reported in any of the studies. Our patient had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal
ulcer. The ulcer failed to heal with standard treatment.
Serum IgG4 was elevated in most of the cases reviewed,
similar to our case, though was normal in three reports
[11, 13, 17] and was not reported in two cases [11, 18].
The diagnosis of IgG4-RD was based on a combination
of features that include clinical parameters, serology, immunohistochemistry, imaging and histopathology. In the
present case, the diagnosis of IgG4-RD was initially
missed in the histological analysis of the liver and pancreatic biopsy and gallbladder samples. When IgG4-RD
was suspected based on the clinical and laboratory findings, IgG4 immunostaining was undertaken and the
IgG4-RD diagnosis was confirmed. In our literature review, there were eight patients treated through surgery,
10 patients by corticosteroids, two were given corticosteroids after surgery, and in two patient studies, the treatment course was not reported (Table 2). Our patient
responded partially to steroid therapy and required other
immunosuppressive agents for a complete and successful
response.
IgG4-RD can affect multiple gastrointestinal organs
simultaneously or over different time periods. The clinical manifestations can mimic malignancy or other benign diseases such as portal hypertension, acid peptic
disease. A high index of suspicion is required to make
an accurate diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical
interventions.
