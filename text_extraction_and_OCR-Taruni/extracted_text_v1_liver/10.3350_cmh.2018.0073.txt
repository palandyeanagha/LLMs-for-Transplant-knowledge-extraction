Background/Aims: To investigate whether serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2-binding protein 
(WFA+-M2BP) can predict the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative 
resection. 
Methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who underwent curative resection for HCC between 2004 and 2015 
were eligible for the study. Recurrence was sub-classified as early (<2 years) or late (≥2 years).
Results: A total of 170 patients with CHB were selected. During the follow-up period (median, 22.6 months), 64 
(37.6%) patients developed recurrence. In multivariate analyses, WFA+
-M2BP level was an independent predictor of 
overall (hazard ratio [HR]=1.490), early (HR=1.667), and late recurrence (HR=1.416), together with male sex, des-gamma 
carboxyprothrombin level, maximal tumor size, portal vein invasion, and satellite nodules (all P<0.05). However, WFA+-
M2BP level was not predictive of grade B-C posthepatectomy liver failure. The cutoff value that maximized the sum of 
sensitivity (30.2%) and specificity (90.6%) was 2.14 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve=0.632, P=0.010). 
Patients with a WFA+-M2BP level >2.14 experienced recurrence more frequently than those with a WFA+-M2BP level 
≤2.14 (P=0.011 by log-rank test), and had poorer postoperative outcomes than those with a WFA+-M2BP level ≤2.14 in 
terms of overall recurrence (56.0 vs. 34.5%, P=0.047) and early recurrence (52.0 vs. 20.7%, P=0.001). 
Conclusions: WFA+
-M2BP level is an independent predictive factor of HBV-related HCC recurrence after curative 
resection. Further studies should investigate incorporation of WFA+-M2BP level into tailored postoperative surveillance 
strategies for patients with CHB. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:33-44)

Introduction
If hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is detected in an early stage 
during surveillance, hepatic resection is strongly recommended for 
non-cirrhotic patients and is considered the mainstay of treatment 
in cirrhotic patients with well-preserved liver function.1
 Although 
recent advances in the selection of candidates for resection, optimization of surgical techniques, and perioperative management 
have improved the postoperative outcomes of patients with HCC, 
recurrence remains the main cause of an unsatisfactory long-term 
prognosis after HCC resection.2
 Thus, identification of risk factors 
for recurrence after curative resection is of paramount importance.
Postoperative recurrence can be divided into early (<2 years) 
and late (≥2 years) recurrence, which have different underlying 
mechanisms.3
 Advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis is a risk factor 
for late recurrence, as it contributes to multicentric recurrence in 
the remnant liver.4
 In addition, advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis 
is closely correlated with short-term poor postoperative outcomes 
such as postoperative mortality or complications (e.g., liver failure 
and hepatic decompensation).5,6 Thus, preoperative assessment of 
the fibrotic burden can improve long-term outcomes by enabling 
selection of patients who will benefit from curative resection. Alternatively, other treatment modalities, such as liver transplantation, can be recommended to patients at greater risk for postoperative recurrence after curative resection.
Efforts have been made to expand the role of noninvasive surrogates for liver biopsy into the surgical setting, beyond simple 
assessment of the fibrotic burden. Indeed, preoperative liver stiffness values determined by transient elastography are reportedly 
predictive of the risk of the development of hepatic insufficiency, 
recurrence, and survival after curative HCC resection.7-9 Recently, 
a glycan-based immunoassay has been introduced; the assay targets Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2 binding 
protein (WFA+
-M2BP) as a noninvasive biomarker of liver fibrosis 
and predictor of HCC.10,11 Although a recent Japanese study found 
that WFA+
-M2BP was predictive of recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage HCC who underwent curative resection,12
the clinical role of WFA+
-M2BP in surgical settings is still unclear.
Therefore, we conducted this single-center, retrospective cohort 
study to investigate the longitudinal prognostic performance of 
WFA+
-M2BP in predicting HCC recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC who underwent curative resection. 
Patients and Methods
Patients
Between 2004 and 2015, 492 patients who underwent curative 
resection for HBV-related HCC were considered eligible. Chronic 
hepatitis B (CHB) was defined as persistence of serum HBV surface antigen for >6 months. The exclusion criteria were no or an 
insufficient stored serum sample for WFA+
-M2BP assays, serum 
sample collected after resection, insufficient clinical data for statistical analysis, positive resection margin for HCC, co-infection 
with hepatitis C virus or HIV, and alcohol ingestion of >40 g/day 
for >5 years. 
This study was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital. Given its retrospective nature, written informed consent for clinical data was 
not required.
WFA+-M2BP assay
Serum WFA+-M2BP was quantified preoperatively through a 
lectin-Ab sandwich immunoassay using a fully automated immunoanalyzer (HISCL-2000i; Sysmex Co, Hyogo, Japan).13 For WFA+
-
M2BP assays, the remaining serum samples after HBV DNA quantification during the study period which have been stored at 
–70°C, were used. Measured levels of analyte conjugated with 
Wisteria floribunda agglutinin were indexed using the following 
equation:
Cutoff index (COI)=([WFA1+
-M2BP]sample–[WFA1+-M2BP]NC)/
Study Highlights
Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+
-M2BP) level is an independent predictive factor of hepatitis B virus-related posthepatectomy carcinoma recurrence after curative resection. However, we found that WFA+
-M2BP level was not predictive of grade B-C posthepatecomy liver failure or major complications. Patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels >2.14 were at significantly higher risk of overall recurrence and early recurrence than patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels ≤2.14. Further studies are needed to confirm whether current strategies used to select optimal 
candidates for resection can be optimized according to preoperative WFA+
-M2BP values.

([WFA1+-M2BP]PC)–[WFA1+-M2BP]NC
Where [WFA1+-M2BP]sample is the serum WFA+-M2BP level, PC is 
the positive control, and NC is the negative control. The positive 
control was supplied as a calibration solution preliminarily standardized to yield a COI of 1.0.
Preoperative work-up, surgery, and follow-up
Diagnosis of HCC was based on the guidelines proposed by the 
Korea Liver Cancer Study Group.14 Preoperative HCC staging was 
assessed using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging 
system.15 During follow-up, antiviral therapy was administered in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Korean Association for the 
Study of the Liver.16
As described in our previous study,7 all resections were performed by four experienced surgeons (DH Han, GH Choi, KS Kim, 
and JS Choi). The type and extent of resections were determined 
according to tumor size, location, and liver reserve function estimated by the Child-Pugh score and indocyanine green retention 
rate at 15 minutes (ICG R15). Liver resection was defined as minor 
when two or fewer liver segments were resected, whereas major 
hepatectomy was defined as the resection of three or more liver 
segments. Intraoperative ultrasonography was performed routinely to determine tumor location and extent and to exclude the 
presence of additional lesions in the residual liver. Curative resection was defined as a negative pathological surgical margin and 
the absence of residual tumor. After discharge, patients were followed up every 3 months with tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein 
[AFP] and des-gamma carboxy prothrombin [DCP]) and imaging 
studies, including abdominal computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging.
Definition of outcomes 
Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) was defined and graded by 
the recommendations of the International Study Group of Liver 
Surgery (ISGLS).17 PHLF is defined as an increased international 
normalized ratio (INR) and hyperbilirubinemia on or after postoperative day 5. Grade A PHLF does not require deviations from regular clinical management, whereas grades B and C PHLF require 
noninvasive (grade B) or invasive treatment (grade C). If the INR 
or serum bilirubin concentration is increased preoperatively, PHLF 
is defined as an increasing serum bilirubin concentration on or after postoperative day 5 (compared to the values of the previous 
day). Postoperative complications were categorized according to 
the modified Clavien-Dindo classification (Supplementary Table 1).18
A major complication was defined as grade 3 or above. Recurrence was diagnosed based on the combined findings of the clinical examinations and sub-classified as early (<2 years) or late (≥2 
years) recurrence.3
Histological assessment of tumor and non-tumor 
liver tissue
As described in our previous study,7 a histological evaluation of 
the extracted liver specimens was performed by one experienced 
pathologist (YN Park) who was blinded to the patients’ clinical information. Gross tumor classification, tumor size and number, 
vascular invasion, satellite nodule, and Edmondson-Steiner grade 
were determined. Liver fibrosis was evaluated semiquantitatively 
in non-cancerous tissues according to the Batts system.19 Fibrosis 
was staged on a 0–4 scale: F0, no fibrosis; F1, portal fibrosis 
without septa; F2, portal fibrosis and a few septa; F3, numerous 
septa without cirrhosis; and F4, cirrhosis.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) or n 
(%), as appropriate. Differences among continuous and categorical variables were examined using Student’s t-tests (or MannWhitney tests) and chi-square tests (or Fisher’s exact tests), respectively. 
For longitudinal analysis, patients were followed up until the 
date of HCC recurrence or the last visit. Cumulative HCC recurrence rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared using log-rank tests. To identify independent risk factors for recurrence, univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were performed. In analyses of predictors of early recurrence (<2 years), the analytic population included patients without recurrence during the study period, patients with recurrence 
after 2 years who were considered to not have had recurrence until the time of recurrence and censored at the same time, and patients with recurrence within 2 years. In analyses of predictors of 
late recurrence (≥2 years), the analytic population included patients without recurrence, only if their follow-up period was more 
than 2 years, and patients with recurrence irrespective of followup time. To identify independent risk factors for developing grade 
B-C PHLF, univariate and multivariate binary regression analyses 
were performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95%

confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. 
The diagnostic performance of WFA+
-M2BP was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area 
under ROC curve (AUC). In addition, the cutoff values for predicting recurrence that maximized the sum of sensitivity (Se) and 
specificity (Sp) (Cutoffse+sp), the cutoff values that showed positive 
predictive value (PPV) >80% (Cutoffhigh-risk), and the cutoff values 
that showed negative predictive value (NVP) >80% (Cutofflow-risk) 
were also calculated. All statistical analyses were performed using 
SPSS software (v20.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value 
<0.05 in two-tailed tests was considered to indicate statistical 
significance.
Results
Baseline characteristics
After excluding 322 patients according to the exclusion criteria, 
170 patients with HBV-related HCC were selected for statistical 
analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of 
the study population before curative resection are summarized in 
Table 1. The median age of the entire cohort (132 males and 38 
females) was 55 years. Most patients had well-preserved liver 
function of Child-Pugh class A (n=168, 98.8%).
The median AFP, DCP, ICG R15, and WFA+
-M2BP levels were 
13.0 ng/mL, 44 mAU/mL, 8.4%, and 1.02 COI, respectively. HCC 
in BCLC stage 0 and A were identified in 41 (24.1%) and 122 
(71.8%) patients, respectively. Of the patients, 126 (74.1%) were 
receiving antiviral therapy at the time of resection.
Perioperative outcomes and pathological 
information
Perioperative outcomes and pathological information are summarized in Table 2. A total of 51 (30.0%) patients underwent major hepatectomy. Most patients received open surgery (n=113, 
66.5%). The median amount of blood loss was 250 mL and blood

transfusion was required in 12 (7.1%) patients. Grade B-C PHLF 
developed in eight (4.8%) patients. Seven (4.1%) patients experienced major postoperative complications; the most common was 
pleural effusion (n=4). In addition, bile leakage, ascites, and an 
umbilical incisional hernia developed in one patient each. 
The median maximal tumor size was 2.4 cm, and 18 (10.6%) 
patients had multiple tumors. Portal vein invasion, microscopic 
vascular invasion, and satellite nodules were identified in 15 
(8.9%), 78 (46.2%), and 12 (7.1%) patients, respectively. Regarding non-tumor pathology, 99 (58.2%) patients had F4 fibrosis. 
The WFA+
-M2BP level was significantly higher in patients with F4 
than those with F0–3 fibrosis (median 1.18 [IQR 0.79–1.86] vs. 
0.91 [0.67–1.31]; P=0.045).
Comparison between patients with and without HCC 
recurrence
During the follow-up period (median 22.6 [IQR 13.3–61.0] 
months), HCC recurred in 64 (37.6%) patients. The cumulative incidence of HCC recurrence at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 15.8%, 
25.3%, 30.0%, 32.9%, and 34.1%, respectively (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). The most common site of recurrence was the liver (n=58, 
90.6%).
A comparison of baseline characteristics between patients who 
developed recurrence and those who did not is shown in Table 3. 
Patients who developed recurrence had a higher HBV-DNA level 
(median 2.92 vs. 2.16 log10IU/mL), higher WFA+
-M2BP level (median 1.22 vs. 0.91, COI), higher blood loss (median 330 vs. 250 
mL), greater maximal tumor size (median 2.6 vs. 2.2 cm), and 
higher proportions of portal vein invasion (17.5 vs. 3.8%), microscopic vascular invasion (58.7 vs. 38.7%), and satellite nodules 
(12.9 vs. 3.8%) than patients who did not experience recurrence 
(all P<0.05).
Independent predictors of overall, early, and late 
recurrence
Among the 64 patients with recurrence, 43 (67.2%) experienced early recurrence and 21 (32.8%) experienced late recurrence. We evaluated independent predictors of overall, early, and 
late recurrence (Table 4).
In univariate analyses, male sex, AFP level, DCP level, WFA+
-
M2BP level, maximal tumor size, multiple tumors, portal vein invasion, microscopic vascular invasion, and the presence of satellite nodules were significantly predictive of overall, early, and late 
recurrence (all P<0.05), with the exception of borderline significance between multiple tumors and early recurrence (P=0.051). In 
multivariate analyses, WFA+
-M2BP was an independent predictor 
of overall, early, and late recurrence (HR=1.490, 1.667, and 1.416, 
respectively; all P<0.05), together with other factors such as male 
sex, DCP, maximal tumor size, portal vein invasion, and satellite 
nodules.
Independent predictor of grade B-C PHLF
Univariate analyses identified aspartate aminotransferase level 
and major hepatectomy as significantly predictive of grade B-C 
PHLF (all P<0.05). In subsequent multivariate analyses, major 
hepatectomy was the only independent predictor of grade B-C 
PHLF (HR=4.254, 95% CI 1.824–9.919; P=0.001) (Supplementary 
Table 2). 
Optimal cutoff values of WFA+-M2BP to predict 
recurrence
Considering the median follow-up period (22.6 months), cutoff 
values for predicting 2-year recurrence in the whole study population and several subgroups were calculated based on ROC curve 
analyses (Table 5).
The WFA+
-M2BP cutoff value that maximized the sum of sensitivity (30.2%) and specificity (90.6%) was 2.14 COI (AUC=0.632, 
P=0.010). Patients with a WFA+-M2BP level >2.14 COI had a significantly higher cumulative recurrence rate than those with a 
WFA+
-M2BP level ≤2.14 COI (P=0.011 by log-rank test) (Fig. 1). 
The cumulative incidences of HCC recurrence at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 
years in patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels >2.14 COI were 32.0%, 
52.0%, 56.0%, 56.0%, and 56.0%, respectively, whereas those 
in patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels ≤2.14 COI were 13.1%, 
20.7%, 25.5%, 29.0%, and 30.0%, respectively. Using cutoff values for low and high risks of recurrence of 0.57 COI (negative predictive value 89.4) and 3.88 (PPV 89.9%), respectively (Table 5), 
only 1 (6.2%) of 16 patients with a low risk of recurrence experienced recurrence, whereas 5 (83.3%) of 6 patients with a high 
risk of recurrence experienced recurrence.
In patients with histological cirrhosis (n=99, 58.2%), the cutoff 
value of WFA+
-M2BP that maximized the sum of sensitivity 
(88.9%) and specificity (50.0%) was 0.94 COI (AUC=0.720, 
P=0.001), compared to 2.31 COI (sensitivity 45.5% and specificity 
97.5%, AUC=0.706, P=0.038) in patients who had undergone 
major hepatectomy (n=51, 30.0%).

Postoperative outcomes according to WFA+-M2BP 
cutoff value
Postoperative outcomes according to preoperative WFA+-M2BP 
value are shown in Table 6. Patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels 
>2.14 (n=25, 14.7%) had a significantly higher risk of overall recurrence (56.0% vs. 34.5%) and early recurrence (52.0% vs. 
20.7%) than patients with WFA+
-M2BP levels ≤2.14 (all P<0.05). 
Although the risk of late recurrence was higher in patients with 
WFA+
-M2BP levels >2.14 compared to those with WFA+-M2BP 
levels ≤2.14, the association was of marginal significance 
(P=0.072). The risks of grade B-C PHLF and major complications 
were statistically similar (all P>0.05) (Table 6).
Discussion
Serum levels of WFA+
-M2BP may be useful as a marker of the 
degree of liver fibrosis. WFA+
-M2BP is secreted by hepatic stellate 
cells and enhances synthesis of Mac-2 by Kupffer cells, which renders hepatic stellate cells fibrogenic.20 WFA+
-M2BP is a “doughnut-shaped” glycoprotein, changes in the N-glycan structure of 
which mirror the extent of liver fibrosis.21 Automated rapid assays 
for these changes have been developed for noninvasive assessment of fibrotic burden. Indeed, the diagnostic accuracy of WFA+
-
M2BP for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis has been demonstrated in patients with CHB, chronic hepatitis C, non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, and biliary atresia.21-26 In addition, WFA+
-M2BP 
levels are predictive of the risk of development of HBV- and HCVrelated HCC.11,23
Our study has several strengths. First, because the significant

correlation between fibrotic burden assessed using WFA+-M2BP 
and the risk of HCC development was confirmed in previous studies,11,23 the ability of WFA+
-M2BP to predict the risk of HCC recurrence due to remnant fibrotic liver after curative resection should 
be investigated. Although serum levels of WFA+
-M2BP measured 
at the time of curative resection are reportedly an independent 
predictor of HCC recurrence and survival in patients undergoing 
curative resection of HCC,12 most of the patients in the study had 
HCV-related HCC (68.8%).11 Because the natural course of disease 
and the antiviral treatment strategy for HCV and HBV differ, it is 
important to validate the role of WFA+
-M2BP in patients with 
HBV-related HCC undergoing resection. The recent reports that 
WFA+
-M2BP levels are lower in patients with CHB than in those 
with CHC22,27 also support the need for validation of WFA+
-M2BP 
in patients with HBV-related HCC. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first report to focus on the prognostic value of WFA+
-
M2BP for HBV-related HCC recurrence and survival in patients undergoing curative resection.
Second, we comprehensively investigated the role of WFA+
-
M2BP in predicting overall, early, and late recurrence as well as 
PHLF; the results suggested that WFA+
-M2BP is predictive of all 
types of recurrence. Although early recurrence is generally associated with tumor factors, not those of the background liver,28
WFA+
-M2BP levels were independently associated with the risk of 
early recurrence in our study, together with several tumor factors 
such as AFP, DCP, maximal tumor size, portal vein invasion, and 
the presence of satellite nodules. However, the ability of WFA+
-
M2BP levels to predict early recurrence warrants further investigation.
Third, fibrosis stage (F0–3 vs. F4) was not predictive of recurrence in this study. This may be because the overall sample size 
was not sufficient to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of histological stage in terms of recurrence. In addition, more than half of 
the patients had histological cirrhosis (58.2%). These factors 
might cause spectrum bias and potentially false-negative results.
Also, it can be postulated that the linear expression of WFA+
-
M2BP with using the best cutoff values to predict recurrence 
might be better in predicting recurrence than histological information with step-wise crude expression. Furthermore, previous studies have reported other surrogates for liver fibrosis (such as transient elastography) to be predictive of HCC recurrence after 
curative resection in patients with CHB,7,29 not histologic fibrosis 
stage.29 However, because the predictive accuracy of histological 
stage has been reported,4,28 our results warrant further investigation.
Fourth, we determined the optimal cutoff level of WFA+
-M2BP 
for predicting overall recurrence. This value (2.14) stratified subgroups with different risks of overall recurrence. Interestingly, our 
cutoff was lower than that of a previous study involving patients 
with HCV-related HCC undergoing curative resection (vs. 3.0).12
This is likely because over half of the study population had F4 
stage fibrosis, and because HBV-related cirrhosis tends to be macronodular, leading to a lesser fibrotic burden than HCV-related 
cirrhosis. A lower cutoff WFA+
-M2BP level in patients with HBV 
has been reported by others.27 In addition, a lower fibrotic burden 
in each fibrosis stage among patients with HBV-related chronic 
liver disease has been reported by previous studies of other surrogates for liver fibrosis (e.g., transient elastography).30 We also proposed clinically relevant cutoff values to enable identification of 
low- and high-risk patients. Only 6.2% of low-risk patients experienced recurrence, compared to >80% of high-risk patients. 
These cutoff values might facilitate development of improved follow-up and management strategies.
This study also had several weaknesses. First, due to the insufficient sample size, a binary risk stratification of the study population using the calculated cutoff values was adopted. However, because a certain proportion of patients experienced recurrence of 
HCC despite a WFA+
-M2BP level lower than the cutoff value, fuTable 6. Postoperative outcomes according to preoperative WFA+

ture large-scale studies should involve multi-stage detailed risk 
stratification. Second, the effect of WFA+
-M2BP levels at the time 
of resection on overall survival could not be investigated because 
of the relatively short follow-up period (median, 22.6 months) and 
low mortality rate (n=17, 10.0%). Further studies with long-term 
follow-up are required to resolve this issue. Third, because this 
was a retrospective study and more than half of the participants 
were excluded, which might have caused selection bias, the results should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the distribution of each fibrosis stage was skewed (F1 in 1 [0.6%] patient, F2 
in 25 [14.7%] patients, F3 in 45 [26.5%] patients, and F4 in 99 
[58.2%] patients), which might resulted in the statistically nonsignificant prognostic value of F4 vs. F0–3. Probably due to the 
similar reason, fibrosis grade as an ordinal variable and different 
binary stratification such as F3–4 vs. F0–2 were significant neither. Finally, noninvasive surrogates for liver fibrosis, including 
WFA+
-M2BP level, can predict the risk of developing PHLF after 
curative resection.31,32 However, we could not demonstrate that 
WFA+
-M2BP was predictive of grade B-C PHLF in patients with 
HBV-related HCC undergoing curative resection. Major hepatectomy was the only independent predictor of grade B-C PHLF in this 
study. 
In conclusion, our findings indicate a significant association between WFA+
-M2BP level and the risk of HBV-related HCC recurrence after curative resection in this population. However, it 
should be validated in further studies whether current strategies 
to select optimal candidates for resection and to evaluate the risk 
of postoperative recurrence can be optimized according to preoperative WFA+
-M2BP values.
