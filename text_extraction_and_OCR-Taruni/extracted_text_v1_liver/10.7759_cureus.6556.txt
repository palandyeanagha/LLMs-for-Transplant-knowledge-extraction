Abstract
Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a transient left ventricular wall
dysfunction that is often triggered by physical or emotional stressors. Although TTS is a rare disease with a
prevalence of only 0.5% to 0.9% in the general population, it is often misdiagnosed as acute coronary
syndrome. A diagnosis of TTS can be made using Mayo diagnostic criteria. The initial management of TTS
includes dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
or aldosterone receptor blockers, and statins. Treatment is usually provided for up to three months and has a
good safety profile. For TTS with complications such as cardiogenic shock, management depends on left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). In patients without LVOTO, inotropic agents can be used to
maintain pressure, while inotropic agents are contraindicated in patients with LVOTO. In TTS with
thromboembolism, heparin should be started, and patients should be bridged to warfarin for up to three
months to prevent systemic emboli. Our comprehensive review discussed the management in detail, derived
from the most recent literature from observational studies, systematic review, and meta-analyses.

Introduction And Background
Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also commonly known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning
syndrome, is characterized by transient left ventricular (LV) wall dysfunction triggered by physical or
emotional factors with similar presentation features as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [1]. TTS accounts for
0.02% of the inpatient admission in the United States [2]. The prevalence of TTS in the general population,
mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is estimated to be 0.5% to 0.9%, with a
higher prevalence in women in their sixth decade of life. Indeed, 2% to 3% of STEMI presentations in
women turn out to be TTS every year [2-4].
As the clinical presentation of TTS is often indistinguishable from ACS, it is a diagnosis of exclusion once
true ACS is ruled out with coronary angiography. According to Luscher and Templin et al., TTS and ACS
commonly present with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion [1,5]. However, most cases of TTS have an
identifiable risk factor of physical or emotional stress that can differentiate it from ACS. To date, there is no
noninvasive test that can confirm the diagnosis of TTS. The definitive diagnostic tool to differentiate TTS
from ACS is coronary angiogram. Furthermore, an LV angiogram has classic features which include apical
rounding, followed by basal and mid-ventricular contraction. Upon establishing the diagnosis, continuous
telemetry monitoring and repeated echocardiograms are essential to identify complications of TTS. Some of
the complications of severe TTS that can affect ionotropic function include acute heart failure, LV outflow
tract obstruction (LVOTO), cardiogenic shock, and the presence of LV thrombus. Other complications of TTS
can include rhythm abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, atrioventricular block,
and cardiac arrest [5]. Our review discusses current management approaches for TTS during the acute and
long-term phases of the disease.

PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
Our review of TTS is divided into a short discussion about diagnosis and an extended discussion about
management. The extended discussion is divided into TTS with and without complications.
Diagnosis of TTS
The diagnosis of TTS should be based on differentials in patients with ACS symptoms such as chest pain or
dyspnea on exertion with positive cardiac biomarkers, including troponin, particularly when
echocardiographic and clinical manifestations do not fit the pattern of ACS [21]. A careful history review of
physical or emotional stressors should be taken. However, TTS can present without any inciting emotional
or physical stressors. A diagnosis of TTS is met if the patient meets all four Mayo Clinic criteria; these can be
helpful in its diagnosis (Table 2) [22-23].
Mayo Criteria
1
Transient regional LV wall dysfunction (dyskinesia, hypokinesia, and akinesia) with deficits extending beyond a single epicardial contribution;
with a rare exception of focal and global type
2 New ST elevation or T-wave inversion on EKG or troponin elevation
3 Absence of angiographic evidence of plaque or coronary obstruction
4 Absence of myocarditis or pheochromocytoma
TABLE 2: Mayo diagnostic criteria
LV, left ventricular; EKG, electrocardiogram
[22-23]
A diagnosis of TTS should also be considered if wall motion defects do not correlate with an obstructed
coronary artery. The exception is a percentage of patients that have concurrent obstructed coronary artery
disease (CAD) and TTS; per the International Takotsubo Registry, this subset included 15.3% of TTS cases
[5]. Thus, a diagnosis of TTS that includes an electrocardiogram and troponin results can resemble ACS.

Diagnostic Imaging
Coronary angiogram is useful for diagnosing TTS. Serial LV systolic function assessment can be done with
serial echocardiograms, a one-time assessment with coronary ventriculography, and then cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging. It is imperative to suspect TTS during the evaluation of ACS. The approach detailed in
Figure 2 should be considered for TTS diagnosis during the evaluation of ACS.

Detection of wall defects on echocardiography or LV ventriculography suggests a review of the following
wall defect patterns (Table 3) [5,24-26].

Location Wall motion abnormality
Apical
The most common type of pattern of wall defect found in the TTS International Takotsubo Registry. There is significant LV systolic
apical ballooning with mid/apical hypokinesia and often basal hyperkinesia.
MidventricularThe second most common pattern of wall defect found in the International Takotsubo Registry. There is LV hypokinesia/wall defect
only in LV mid-ventricular region with apical sparing.
Basal
The third most common type of pattern of wall defect found in the International Takotsubo Registry. There is basal hypokinesia of LV
with sparing of mid-ventricular and apical region.
Focal
The fourth most common type of pattern of wall defect found in International Takotsubo Registry. In this type, isolated anterolateral
segment dysfunction of LV is found.
Global In rare circumstances, TTS patients can have global hypokinesia.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
Cardiac magnetic resonance can highlight the absence of late gadolinium enhancement in TTS as compared
to the presence of late gadolinium enhancement seen in transmural or subendocardial regions in myocardial
infarction [25].
Management
General Management
The management of TTS is generally conservative and focused on emotional or physical stress relief.
However, in some cases, acute complications such as heart failure and shock develop, and intensive
management is required. The management of heart failure and shock is similar to that in the general
guidelines of their management in non-TTS cases except in the presence of LVOTO. In cases of LVOTO,
caution should be taken in preventing volume depletion or with vasodilatory medications. Generally, the
duration of treatment of TTS ranges from three months to one year depending on expert opinion. In a study
by Fazio et al., it was found that TTS treatment of more than three months did not add any significant
change to survival and should be avoided [16].
The management of TTS is divided into TTS without complications and TTS with complications. These
complications include hypotension and cardiogenic shock with heart failure or LVOTO, cardiac arrhythmias,
and thromboembolism.
TTS without Complications
After a comprehensive assessment, if patients are hemodynamically stable with no other signs of
complications such as acute heart failure, arrhythmia, or thromboembolism, they should be admitted to
cardiology for further monitoring. In a study by Yeyehd et al., the acute and post-discharge management of
TTS with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) including aspirin and clopidogrel, anticoagulation such as low
molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux, beta-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and psychological stress relief management helped to lower
inpatient mortality and recurrence of TTS [8]. Furthermore, a study by Yeyehd et al. indicated that DAPT
should be discontinued at discharge if TTS is certain [8]. A further review also revealed a study by Dias et al.
indicating that single antiplatelet therapy or DAPT are independently helpful in lowering major adverse
cardiovascular events/complications in TTS patients [19]. In a study by Templin et al. ACE/ARBs were
associated with improved survival at one-year follow-up in patients with and without heart failure in TTS
[5]. A study by Regnante et al. showed that the use of ACE inhibitors before the onset of TTS prevented
cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and death [15]. A meta-analysis by Santoro et al. reviewed three-year
follow-up data and concluded that aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE/ARBs do not reduce the recurrence
of TTS [13].
TTS with Complications - Hypotension and Cardiogenic Shock
2020 Sattar et al. Cureus 12(1): e6556. DOI 10.7759/cureus.6556 6 of 9

For TTS patients with hypotension or shock, continuous monitoring of clinical parameters such as vital
signs, mental status, urine output, and renal function should be done along with telemonitoring. Up to 5%-
10% of patients with TTS can develop cardiogenic shock [5,27]. A variety of factors are associated with
cardiogenic shock in TTS, including physical triggers, young age, and low LV ejection fraction. Mortality is
higher in TTS with shock by roughly 10-fold [28,29]. A clinical discordance is found between shock and
systolic function of the left or right ventricle. This discordance can be due to the presence of LVOTO [30-33].
An urgent echocardiogram should be done in TTS with cardiogenic shock to look for LVOTO and to rule out
the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve or mitral regurgitation [31,33].
The management of hypotension or cardiogenic shock can be further divided into cases with and without
LVOTO as follows.
Cardiogenic shock without LVOTO: In patients with hypotension without pulmonary congestion, cautious
fluid resuscitation can be performed, even in patients with or without LVOTO. In patients with LV systolic
dysfunction but without LVOTO, a trial of inotropic agents such as dopamine or dobutamine can serve as a
temporary measure; however, an inotropic agent can cause mild LVOTO in these patients [34]. In moderate
to severe LVOTO, pressor/inotropic agents are contraindicated. Patients with persistent hypotension or any
signs of end-organ damage should be closely monitoring with pulmonary catheterization/wedge pressure
and intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP). This subset of patients requires vasopressors.
Cardiogenic shock with LVOTO: In patients with cardiogenic shock with moderate to severe LVOTO,
inotropic agents should not be used because they can increase the degree of obstruction [31,34]. In a study by
Ansari et al., it was reported that inotropes such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine, and
dopamine should be avoided in TTS, and that catecholamine excess can increase 30-day and long-term
mortality in TTS [9]. Only Marfella et al. reported that alpha-adrenergic stimulation by alpha-lipoic therapy
could increase sympathetic stimulation of the heart and show improvement of cardiac defects on 123Imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy at a 12-month follow-up in TTS patients [7].
The recommended treatment of TTS with moderate to severe LVOTO is similar to hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. The management of this subset of patients includes fluid resuscitation in the absence of
pulmonary congestion [22,31]. The use of beta-blockers also plays a role in the relief of obstruction. A casecontrol study by Santoro et al. suggested that intravenous administration of esmolol at admission, followed
by daily bisoprolol can improve LVOTO gradient and relieve obstruction [10].
In TTS with severe LVOTO, alpha agonists such as phenylephrine can help in a closely monitored setting by
increasing afterload. However, phenylephrine should be used with caution as it can cause coronary
vasospasm. Patients with severe/persistent hypotension not responsive to fluid resuscitation or initial
measure with an intra-aortic balloon pump should be closely monitored. As IABPs can decrease afterload,
this effect should be monitored closely [32,34]. A further literature review showed several case reports that
demonstrated the efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a life-saving alternative treatment
for circulatory support in TTS patients with cardiogenic shock [35-37].
TTS with Complications - Heart Failure
Acute heart failure (HF) in TTS is managed the same way as HF from any other illness: by oxygen, respiratory
support as needed, and preload and afterload reduction. The exception to the regular management is that
preload and afterload reduction therapies should be avoided in cases with LVOTO. In TTS patients with HF
without LVOTO, the standard cocktail of medications for HF can be prescribed. This includes diuretics, ACE
inhibitors, or ARBs [22]. Beta-blockers do not lower mortality in HF due to TTS. In an observational study of
2,672 patients by Isogai et al., beta-blockers were unable to lower 30-day in-patient mortality in 423 patients
[12]. A beneficial effect of beta-blockers is a low incidence of cardiac rupture in TTS treated with betablocker, as reported by Kumar et al. [14]. A meta-analysis by Singh et al. concluded that ACE inhibitors
prevent the recurrence of TTS, while beta-blockers do not [20].
The recommended duration of treatment is not well known, but in general, treatment with HF medication is
four weeks until systolic function improves. A Mayo clinic study failed to show any survival benefits of ACE
inhibitors and beta-blockers in TTS patients [38]. An observation study by Abanador-Kamper et al. reviewed
all the treatment regimens for TTS patients and concluded that the benefits of heart failure cocktail
medications and antithrombotic therapy is highest during the first two months of TTS, with a low side effect
profile, high survival, and early recovery [11]. A case series study by Santoro et al. concluded that the use of
levosimendan can improve the LV ejection fraction and has a good safety profile [18].
TTS with Complications - Thromboembolism
Ventricular thrombus is found in 1.3% of the 1,750 TTS patients in the International Takotsubo Registry [5].
The risk of LV thrombus should be evaluated by echocardiography in TTS patients with severe LV
dysfunction. There are no clear guidelines for anticoagulation to prevent LV thrombus, but some reports
have shown that 10 days of anticoagulation can reduce the incidence of LV thrombus in TTS patients. In
2020 Sattar et al. Cureus 12(1): e6556. DOI 10.7759/cureus.6556 7 of 9

patients with severe LV dysfunction and/or with LV thrombus, anticoagulation for three months until
resolution of LV dysfunction to prevent systemic embolization is preferred [22-23]. A systematic review by
de Gregorio found that early anticoagulation is beneficial in TTS in patients with or without
thromboembolism [17]. This is also supported by an observational study by Santoro et al. that found that
early heparin administration followed by warfarin for three months prevented stroke in TTS patients with
and without LV thrombus [6].
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reviewed the most recent observational studies and clinical trials to summarize the
management of TTS. The initial management should include optimal medical therapy with antiplatelet
medications, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE/ARBs. Pressor medications are contraindicated in TTS with
LVOTO. In TTS with thromboembolism, heparin with warfarin should be continued for at least three
months.
