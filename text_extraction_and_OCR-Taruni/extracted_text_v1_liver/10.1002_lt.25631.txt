Abstract
Background Postoperative atrial fibrillation/flutter (POAF) is the most common perioperative 
arrhythmia and may be particularly problematic after liver transplant (LT). This study 
is a single-center, retrospective analysis of POAF to determine its incidence 
following LT, identify risk factors, assess its impact on clinical outcomes, and 
summarize management strategies.

Methods
The records of all patients who underwent LT between 2010 and 2018 were 
reviewed. Extracted data included pre-LT demographics and cardiac evaluation, inhospital post-LT cardiac events, early and late complications, and survival.
Results
Among 1011 patients, the incidence of post-LT POAF was 10.1%. Using binary 
logistic regression, pre-LT history of atrial fibrillation was the strongest predictor of 
POAF (Odds Ratio (OR) 6.7, Confidence Interval (CI) 2.0-22.6, p<0.001), followed by 
history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 2.5, CI 1.1-5.8, p=0.03). Cardiac stress 
testing abnormality and CAD on cardiac catheterization were also associated with 
higher risk. Median time to POAF onset after LT was 3 days, with 72% resolving
within 48 hours. POAF patients had greater hospital length of stay, death during the 
LT admission, and 90-day and 1-year mortality. POAF was an independent risk 
factor for post-LT mortality (OR 2.0, CI 1.3-3.0, p<0.01). Amiodarone was 
administered to 73% of POAF patients with no evidence of increased serum alanine 
aminotransferase levels.
Conclusion
POAF occurred in 10.1% of post-LT patients, with early onset and rapid resolution in 
most affected patients. POAF patients, however, had significant morbidity and
mortality, suggesting that POAF is an important marker for worse early and late postLT outcomes.

Background
Postoperative atrial fibrillation/flutter (POAF) is the most common 
perioperative arrhythmia (1). It occurs in 0.4-26% of non-cardiothoracic surgeries (2). 
Contemporary studies suggest that the presence of POAF is associated with higher 
in-hospital mortality and morbidity, as well as higher risk for stroke (3). Risk factors 
for developing POAF include older age, history of previous cardiac arrhythmias, 
presence of structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and type of surgery 
performed (1, 4). POAF most commonly develops between postoperative days 1 and 
4, and it is generally self-limited with good response to intervention (1).
Liver transplant (LT) patients are theoretically at high risk of developing POAF 
given the presence of increased sympathetic flow, perioperative hemodynamic 
changes, and frequent use of vasopressors following surgery (2). In the immediate 
post-LT period, atrial fibrillation (AF) is particularly problematic as it can result in 
elevated central venous pressure and poor graft venous outflow (5). In addition, 
there has been a substantial increase in the number of LTs in older patients (>65 
years) over the past decade (6). Since aging is an independent risk factor for the 
development of AF, an increase in the incidence of POAF post-LT is expected (7). 
Data regarding POAF following LT are scarce (8, 9). 
The aims of this retrospective study in patients who underwent LT at a single, 
high-volume center were to 1) determine the incidence of new-onset POAF; 2) 
identify intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with the development of POAF;
3) assess post-transplant clinical outcomes including hospital length of stay, 
readmission and early and late mortality; and 4) summarize the management of 
POAF, including the use of amiodarone in the setting of recent LT.

Methods
Study design and participants
This study reviewed all patients who underwent LT between January 1, 2010
and August 31, 2018 at Indiana University Hospital. Patients were surveyed for the 
development of AF and/or atrial flutter (AFL) post-LT. Data were combined for both 
AF and AFL since both arrhythmias frequently coexist in the same patient, and share 
similar risk factors and management strategies (10-12). POAF was defined as 
development of AF or AFL at any point postoperatively during the initial LT 
hospitalization in a patient who had no evidence of AF or AFL on preoperative 
electrocardiogram (ECG), regardless of history of pre-existing AF or AFL. Charts 
were independently reviewed by two investigators. Transplant and cardiology staff 
notes were reviewed for mention of AF or AFL. Presence of AF or AFL was
confirmed by ECG and telemetry strips.
Demographic, clinical and outcome variables
Collected data included demographics (age, gender, race, body mass index, 
etiology of cirrhosis) and cardiac risk factors (pre-existing AF or AFL, hypertension, 
diabetes, personal history of coronary artery disease [CAD], family history of CAD, 
smoking history and pack-years). Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score 
and CHA
2DS2
-VASc score were calculated based on data collected prior to LT. 
Techniques for organ procurement, transplantation and immunosuppression have 
been reported previously by this center(13-15). All patients in this study received 
antibody-based immunosuppression induction with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All 
patients were also initiated on tacrolimus therapy in a delayed fashion on post-

transplant day 2-4. Further adjustments to the immunosuppressive therapy were 
generally delayed until outpatient management by a transplant hepatologist.
Additional data were collected on preoperative and postoperative invasive and 
non-invasive testing modalities including coronary angiography, and stress and 
resting echocardiograms. All LT candidates at this center underwent extensive 
cardiac testing prior to listing for LT and this protocol and its results have been 
published previously(16). Patients were evaluated and listed for LT according to 
protocols established by our center and by the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS). Patients with active AF or AFL were not listed for transplant. Furthermore, any patient who developed AF or AFL while on the transplant list was made inactive 
until the arrhythmia was controlled through medications or ablation. 
Length of hospital stay was calculated from the immediate postoperative 
transplant period until the date of discharge. Hospital readmission was recorded for 
any admission to the hospital within 90 days of the date of hospital discharge. Graft 
failure was defined as either the need for retransplantation or death from primary 
graft failure. Death follow-up was obtained by reviewing medical records, newspaper 
obituaries and death certificates, and by conducting phone interviews by social 
workers when necessary. A thorough cause of death analysis was completed for all 
patient deaths within 1 year of transplant. Long-term patient survival was analyzed 
using Cox regression analysis. Data regarding clinical management of AF and AFL 
were collected and interventions included the use of intravenous rate-control 
(esmolol, metoprolol, diltiazem) and antiarrhythmic (amiodarone, ibutilide) 
medications, and electrical cardioversion. The use of vasopressors (epinephrine, 
norepinephrine, phenylephrine) and inotropes (dobutamine, dopamine) at the time of 
POAF onset was also recorded.

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are a sensitive marker for drug 
toxicity in the transplant liver graft(17). To assess the potential toxicity of 
amiodarone to the newly transplanted liver, serum ALT levels were recorded daily in 
the immediate post-LT period (10 days) and then on days 14 and 30. ALT levels for 
patients who received amiodarone were compared to patients that did not.
Statistical analysis
Standard statistical testing was utilized for continuous and categorical 
variables, as indicated. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Binary logistic 
regression and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for the 
occurrence of POAF and for patient survival analysis, respectively, using a direct 
entry technique. Co-variates were retained in the final models if the p-value for any
variable was <0.10. Statistical testing was performed on SPSS software (IBM SPSS 
Statistics Version 25 IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Use of center data 
for retrospective analysis has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional 
Review Board (Indiana University School of Medicine, study number 
1011003619A010). The study protocol for this research conformed to the Declaration 
of Helsinki.

(26%), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (24%). Twenty percent of patients had 
hepatocellular carcinoma at transplant. Regarding common cardiac risk factors, 2% 
had any prior history of AF or AFL, 30% were diabetic, 36% with hypertension, 50% 
with any history of tobacco use, 7% had a personal history of CAD and 37% with 
immediate family history of heart disease.
In this cohort, 102 (10.1%) patients had POAF, of which 8 (8%) had pre-
existing history of AF or AFL. There were 7 patients with AFL only, compared to 83 
with AF only, and 12 with both. All 7 (100%) patients with AFL only were alive at 1-
year, compared to 64/83 (77%) in the AF only group and 10/12 (83%) in the AF and 
AFL group (p=0.33). 
Bivariate analysis revealed that factors associated with POAF included higher MELD 
(p=0.01), older age (p<0.001), diabetes (p<0.01), history of AF or AFL (p<0.001) and 
history of CAD (p<0.001)(Table 1). The POAF and non-POAF groups did not differ 
with regard to diagnosis of hepatitis C or alcoholic liver disease, the presence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma, or if the transplant was a primary transplant or a re-do 
transplant. The POAF group had a higher incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease compared to the non-POAF group (33% versus 22%, p=0.01).
A binary logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the predictors of
POAF after LT (Table 2). Pre-LT history of AF or AFL was the strongest predictor of 
POAF (Odds Ratio (OR) 6.7, Confidence Interval (CI) 2.0-22.6, p<0.001), followed by 
history of CAD (OR 2.5, CI 1.1-5.8, p=0.03).
A review of pre-transplant cardiac testing is summarized in Table 3. Results 
were available for 95% of patients (95% and 92% for non-POAF and POAF patients, 
respectively). Cardiac stress test was normal in 66% of patients with POAF and 80% 
with no POAF (p=0.03). Similarly, 5-13% POAF patients had abnormalities on stress

testing in contrast to 3-10% of non-POAF patients (p=0.03). There were 69% of all 
patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, with POAF patients more likely to 
meet indication for this test (81% POAF versus 68% non-POAF, p<0.01). Patients 
with POAF had a higher incidence of documented non-obstructive or obstructive 
CAD on cardiac catheterization (29% and 13%, respectively) as compared to 
patients with no POAF(23% and 6%, respectively, p<0.01).
Clinical outcomes 
Post-LT clinical outcomes, survival and cause of death analysis are 
summarized in Table 4. Compared to patients with no POAF, the POAF group had a 
longer average length of stay (18 days in POAF and 9 days in non-POAF, p<0.001) 
and a higher frequency of post-LT stay ≥ 30 days (30% POAF and 8% in non-POAF, 
p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients readmitted 
within 90 days from discharge (53% POAF versus 49% non-POAF, respectively, 
p=0.49). Patients with POAF had an 11% mortality rate during the transplant 
admission (compared to 3% non-POAF, p<0.001). Ninety-day and 1-year mortality 
rates in POAF group were 12% and 21% and were significantly higher than non-
POAF group (4% and 6%, respectively, p<0.001 for both). 
There were a total of 151 patient deaths during the study period (15% of 
total), a rate of 14% (n=125) in the non-POAF group compared to 25% (n=26) for 
POAF patients (p<0.01). Transplant-related complications, which included graft 
failure, were the most common cause of death (19%). Patients with POAF had a 
significantly higher rate of graft failure at 1 year, as compared to non-POAF group 
(non-POAF 6% and POAF 22%; p<0.001). Cox regression demonstrated that POAF 
was an independent risk factor for post-LT mortality (OR 2.0, CI 1.3-3.0, p<0.01) and

showed an 8-year patient survival difference of 82% (non-POAF) versus 64% 
(POAF) (p<0.001) (Figure 1).
POAF group: timing, management and clinical outcomes
A subgroup analysis of patients with POAF is summarized in Table 5. The 
median time post-LT to onset of first POAF episode was 3 days (range 0-45 days; 
interquartile range 2-6 days; mean 7 days (SE 1.0)). Eighty percent of patients had 
their first episode of POAF within 7 days of LT. Seventy-two percent of POAF 
resolved within 48 hours after onset, with a median time to resolution of 1 day (range 0-28 days; mean 2.7 days (SE 0.6)). Norepinephrine and vasopressin were the most 
commonly identified vasopressors being infused at the time of onset of POAF (38% 
and 35%, respectively). During the LT hospitalization, 38% had a documented 
recurrence of POAF after resolution of initial POAF episode, while no patients (0%) 
had evidence of POAF at the time of discharge. It is noted that 13% of patients with 
POAF died during the initial LT hospitalization, and 2 patients had documented 
unresolved AF or AFL prior to death. A total of 42% of patients had a follow-up ECG 
within 90 days following discharge, with 24% of patients having recurrence of AF or 
AFL at that time. It is not known if the follow-up ECG was performed for symptoms or 
as surveillance. 
All POAF patients received standard inpatient treatment including rate control 
and maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers and/or beta-blockers. Only 
74 of the 102 patients with POAF (72%) received intravenous amiodarone. Common 
discharge cardiac medications for these patients included oral amiodarone, beta-
blockers, and calcium channel blockers, though a large majority of POAF patients 
were not discharged on any of these medications. The median CHA

score for POAF patients was 2 (range 0-4; mean 1.7 (SE 0.1)). A total of 27% of 
POAF patients were discharged from the LT hospitalization on anticoagulation. 
Serum electrolytes levels were monitored within 12 hours of the onset of 
POAF and included highest serum potassium (4.2 mEq/L (SE 0.06)), lowest serum 
potassium (3.9 mEq/L (SE 0.05)), and serum magnesium (2.0 mEq/L (SE 0.03)). 
Similarly, the highest and lowest central venous pressures within 12 hours of POAF 
onset were obtained and were 11 mmHg (SE 0.9) and 4 mmHg (SE 0.5), 
respectively. 
Amiodarone toxicity
To assess the risk of amiodarone toxicity in post-LT POAF patients, serum 
ALT levels were compared between POAF patients who received intravenous 
amiodarone for treatment of POAF (n=74) and those who did not (n=28). There were 
no differences between the groups for peak ALT levels at all time points in the first 
30 days post-transplant. These results suggest that the risk of amiodarone therapy to 
the newly transplanted liver graft is negligible(Figure 2). 
Discussion
The incidence of POAF in the cohort presented in this study was 10.1%. This 
finding is similar to the incidence reported in a recent meta-analysis, where POAF 
was found to occur in 9% of post-LT patients (5). A recent systematic review 
explored the incidence and risk factors for POAF following general surgery (4). The 
incidence of POAF was reported to be 11% following abdominal surgeries. Risk 
factors identified for development of POAF included increased age and history of 
CAD. These results were consistent with our findings. In addition, results from the

preoperative cardiac workup showed that the incidence of POAF was higher in 
patients whose pre-transplant cardiac findings were suggestive of ischemia on stress 
test (p=0.03) and/or higher degree of coronary stenosis on cardiac catheterization 
(p<0.01). 
In this study, we identified independent risk factors for POAF on multivariate 
analysis that were similar to well-established risk factors for development of AF in 
the general population such as age and diabetes (18). Interestingly, the incidence of 
POAF was significantly higher in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (33% 
vs. 22%, p=0.01). This finding can be explained by the fact that AF and non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease share multiple risk factors for their development, such as obesity 
and insulin resistance(19). It is also worth mentioning that compared to patients <50 
years of age, the incidence of POAF was 4.5 and 8 times higher in patient ≥50 years 
and ≥60 years, respectively. Since older patients are increasingly undergoing LT, the 
incidence of POAF is expected to increase (6). Among risk factors unique to LT 
patients, a higher MELD score was associated with an increased incidence of POAF. 
In a study conducted by Xia et al., it was found that patients with a higher MELD 
score had a more complicated perioperative course, increased preoperative 
comorbidities and higher vasopressors requirements (20). In our study, a higher 
MELD was associated with increased risk of POAF after adjusting for preoperative 
comorbidities and risk factors. Huang et al. showed that liver disease was an 
independent risk factor for the development of AF(21). These authors hypothesized 
that inflammatory and neurohormonal changes that occur with liver disease could 
contribute to the pathogenesis of AF. In addition, MELD was shown to be a strong 
predictor of new-onset AF, and higher scores were associated with increased risk of 
AF. These findings were also consistent with those of our study.

Pre-existing AF was reported in 2% of our cohort. In previous studies, 
Vannucci et al. reported the prevalence of AF in patients undergoing LT to be 2.5%,
while Bargehr et al. found it to be 4.5%(8, 22). On the other hand, the prevalence of 
AF in the general population was reported to be 0.4-1% (23, 24). It was previously 
reported that the presence of cirrhosis could confer protection against AF due to 
associated decreased cardiac myocyte sensitivity to catecholamines, and to the 
accumulation of toxins with antiarrhythmic and/or anti-inflammatory properties that 
are otherwise cleared by a normally functioning liver (25, 26). However, and as 
mentioned earlier, newer studies suggest that the presence of liver disease could 
predispose to AF and confer an additional risk for its development (21). 
POAF was significantly associated with worse outcomes in our study. 
Mortality rates at 90 days and 1 year were significantly worse when comparing the 
POAF and non-POAF groups (90-day mortality: 12% vs 4% and 1-year mortality: 
21% vs 6%; p<0.001 for both). Similarly, Xia et al. found a significant increase in 
mortality rates at 1, 3 and 6 months in patients with POAF as compared to controls 
(1%, 20% and 24% for POAF group vs. 4%, 8% and 12% for non-POAF group; 
p ≤ 0.001 for all). Furthermore, these authors report a significantly decreased survival 
for LT patients with POAF when followed over a period of 7 years (9). This finding 
was consistent with the results of our survival analysis. Cox regression showed an 
absolute 18% decrease in 8-year survival in POAF as compared to non-POAF group 
(p<0.001). The rate of graft failure at 1 year was significantly higher in the POAF 
versus the non-POAF group (22% vs. 6%, p<0.001). Similar findings were reported 
by Xia et al. at 1, 3 and 6 months following LT (17%, 25% and 28% for POAF group
vs. 7%, 11% and 15% for non‐POAF group; p ≤ 0.001 for all) (9).

Another adverse outcome associated with POAF observed in our study 
included a longer duration of hospital stay as compared to non-POAF. Similar 
findings were also previously reported (27). A previous study showed that POAF was 
associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit readmission following LT(28).
Our study analyzed the overall rate of readmission to the hospital, including but not 
limited to the intensive care unit, and showed that POAF was not associated with a 
higher readmission rate within 90 days of discharge. POAF can be associated with 
hemodynamic derangements, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies and 
ischemic cardiac or cerebrovascular events (2). In our study, most POAF episodes 
were either self-limited or resolved with treatment. Therefore, increased mortality 
observed in POAF group was unlikely to be a direct complication of AF or AFL. 
However, development of POAF could reflect an overall poor physiologic status, and 
may be interpreted as a predictive or prognostic factor for cardiovascular 
complications rather than a causal factor(29). 
The precise mechanisms for development of POAF following abdominal 
surgeries are not fully understood (30). One proposed mechanism suggests that the 
presence of derangements such as hypothermia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and 
bleeding, as well as pain and hemodynamic derangements from surgery, can lead to 
myocardial injury and increased activation of the sympathetic system. These 
derangements, in addition to electrolyte disturbances (especially potassium and 
magnesium) and systemic inflammation, may predispose to POAF (2, 31). This
proposed mechanism could provide insight into the pathophysiology of POAF and 
help to guide the physician in clinical management. As such, it is important to treat 
the aforementioned possible underlying factors when treating POAF. Recent studies 
also demonstrated decreased incidence of POAF with administration of antioxidants

(e.g. vitamin C, statins, N-acetylcysteine) during the perioperative period (32-34). 
These findings could lend support to the hypothesis that systemic inflammation 
following surgery contributes to development of POAF. 
Most pharmacologic strategies for treating POAF have been studied for 
cardiothoracic surgeries, and there are no concrete guidelines for treatment of POAF 
in non-cardiothoracic surgeries (34). A large systematic review showed that the use 
of beta-blockers, on the day of or following a major non-cardiac surgery, was 
associated with a decreased 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with 2 or more 
Revised Cardiac Risk Index factors (35). The use of prophylactic beta-blockers has 
been studied following cardiac surgeries and was shown to decrease the rate of 
POAF (36). Some studies have shown that use of prophylactic amiodarone (oral or 
intravenous) decreased the incidence of POAF at the expense of increased risk of 
bradycardia and hypotension, particularly with intravenous doses of amiodarone 
exceeding 1 gram per day(36, 37) . 
Hepatotoxicity is a well-established side effect of amiodarone. Acute liver 
toxicity from intravenous amiodarone was reported to be 13% in a prior study (38). 
However, our study showed no difference in daily ALT levels when used as a marker 
of toxicity between patients who received amiodarone for treatment of POAF and
those who did not. Data regarding the safety and efficacy of either rate-control or 
anti-arrhythmic agents for the treatment of POAF post-LT and their long-term 
morbidity and mortality outcomes are still lacking. 
A large study evaluated perioperative risk of stroke in patients with POAF 
following non-cardiothoracic surgeries. It was found that patients with POAF had 
cumulative rates of stroke of 1.5% (95% CI: 1.2%–1.8%) compared to 0.4% in non-
POAF patients (95% CI: 0.3%–0. 4%) (3). Initiating antithrombotic therapy should be

considered if the initial episode of AF does not resolve within 24-48 hours of onset,
or if the patient has had recurrent AF during that hospitalization (39). If any of these 
2 criteria is met, antithrombotic therapy would be indicated in patients with CHA

VASc score ≥2. However, this complex decision should be weighed against the risk 
of bleeding. The decision to anticoagulate should directly involve the surgeon and 
should be clearly discussed and communicated with the patient and their family(1). 
Limitations: 
This is a retrospective study and is subject to the limitations of this study 
design. The study was performed in a highly-selective population since patients 
deemed high-risk for LT were generally denied listing. Furthermore, our study only 
investigated the preoperative risk factors which were associated with the 
development of POAF and intra- or postoperative risk factors were not considered.
The association between POAF and immunosuppressive agents was not assessed
in this study as all patients were on a standardized immunosuppression protocol.
Only patients in the intensive care unit or patients on the general ward with cardiac 
risk factors or symptoms were continuously monitored on telemetry following LT 
surgery. Therefore, incomplete records of self-limiting or asymptomatic occurrence of 
POAF cannot be excluded. 
Conclusion
This study showed that POAF is common following LT and is associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality. Early aggressive treatment of POAF may improve 
post-LT outcomes. We believe that more prospective studies are needed to further

understand the association of POAF with postoperative outcomes and to establish 
targeted treatment strategies, particularly in LT patients.
