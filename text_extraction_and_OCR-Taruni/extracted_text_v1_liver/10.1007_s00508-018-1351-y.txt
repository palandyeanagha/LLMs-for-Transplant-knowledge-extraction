Summary
Background Non-malignant portal vein thrombosis
(PVT) is common in patients with advanced liver disease. Anticoagulation (AC) increases the chances of
recanalization and may improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis.
Aim We retrospectively assessed the course of nonmalignant PVT in patients receiving AC.

ferase [ALT]), severity of disease (ascites) and synthesis function (albumin) as well as AC, rates of PVT
regression/progression and AC-associated complications were documented.
Results Among 122 patients with PVT, 51 patients
with non-malignant PVT (27 incomplete, 24 complete) were included, 12 patients (25%) received longterm AC therapy (≥9 months) as compared to 36 patients without long-term AC. We observed a trend
towards higher regression rates with long-term AC of
58% (vs. 28% without AC; p= 0.08) and lower progression rates of 25% (vs. 42% without AC; p= 0.15).
In the subgroup of patients with decompensation
prior to PVT diagnosis (n= 39), long-term AC (n= 10,
25.6%) resulted in a significantly higher rate of PVT
regression/resolution (70% vs. 24%, p= 0.031). Interestingly, AST/ALT tended to decrease (–19%/–16%)
and the proportion of patients with ascites became
lower (–33%) with long-term AC (without AC: ±0%).
Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in
albumin levels (+9%/+3.6 g/dl) when compared to patients without long-term AC (–2%/–0.8 g/dl; p= 0.04).
Additionally, 10 patients were treated with direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) for splanchnic vein thrombosis. Importantly, there were no AC-associated bleeding events in patients with conventional AC and
one bleeding event in patients with DOAC treatment
(10%).
Conclusion Our findings support anticoagulation in
patients with non-malignant PVT, since AC seems safe
and associated with superior PVT regression rates and
might also decrease hepatic injury and improve liver
synthesis.

Study highlights
● Long-term anticoagulation (AC) in patients with portal vein thrombosis is recommended by international
guidelines to improve recanalization rates.
● In this study, long-term AC was associated with
a trend towards higher portal vein thrombosis (PVT)
regression rates, which attained statistical significance in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
● Furthermore, long-term AC was associated with significant improvements in hepatic synthesis function
(albumin).
● In patients with liver cirrhosis AC appears to be safe,
as no AC-associated bleeding events occurred in patients with conventional AC and only one bleeding
event in DOAC patients.
Introduction
Cirrhosis can develop from virtually all forms of
chronic liver disease with alcoholic liver disease and
chronic viral hepatitis being the most common etiologies in developed countries [1]. Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding,
mainly from esophageal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy [2, 3]. In contrast to the dogma of
auto-anticoagulation in cirrhosis, venous thrombosis
is more common in patients with cirrhosis than in the
general population [4, 5]. There is a 7.3-fold increased
risk of developing portal vein thrombosis (PVT) with
cirrhosis. This represents a severe complication in
patients with liver cirrhosis that may lead to intestinal infarction and preclude the option for orthotopic
liver transplantation [6, 7]. The prevalence of PVT is
up to 23.3% in liver transplantation candidates without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the yearly
incidence of non-malignant PVT is estimated to be
between 7–11% in patients with cirrhosis.
Although partial PVT in patients with cirrhosis may
resolve spontaneously [8, 9], the majority of patients
(48–70%) show progression of PVT within 2 years [8,
10]. Thus, anticoagulation with low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) has
been used for treatment of cirrhotic PVT with reported
recanalization rates of 55–75% [10–14] when given for
about 6 months. Since PVT might recur in up to 38%
of cirrhotic patients when anticoagulation is stopped
early after PVT resolution [9, 13], long-term anticoagulation has been suggested by recent European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines
[15], particularly in liver transplantation candidates.
Since PVT can cause portal hypertension-related
bleeding and anticoagulation may further increase the
risk of bleeding events, the safety of anticoagulation
therapy needs to be specifically addressed in patients
with cirrhosis; however, in previous studies the incidence and severity of bleeding events related to anticoagulation with LMWH or VKA was low [10–14].
Next to the efficacy of anticoagulation to prevent
and resolve PVT, there are experimental data supporting a beneficial impact on liver synthesis function and
fibrosis [16]. In a prospective clinical trial, the administration of prophylactic LMWH did not only prevent
PVT in liver transplantation candidates but also decreased hepatic decompensation and improved survival [17].
Thus, this study aimed to assess (i) regression rates
of non-malignant PVT with and without anticoagulation and (ii) the evolution of hepatic inflammation
and liver function in patients with PVT. Furthermore
(iii) we provide a summary of the existing literature
on this topic.
Patients and methods
Study design and inclusion of subjects
This study was a retrospective analysis on the efficacy
of anticoagulation for regression of PVT and its impact on hepatic inflammation and liver function. The
specific inclusion criteria for this study were patients
aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of cirrhosis and concomitant PVT. We excluded patients with malignant
PVT and patients without sufficient clinical information at the time of PVT diagnosis and on the clinical
course thereafter. Furthermore, data on direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) used in a small cohort of patients for treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis are
reported.
Clinical and radiological parameters
Clinical data was collected from patients’ medical
records. Radiological images by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
sonography were reviewed by a second expert radiologist in case PVT diagnosis or extension of thrombus
was unclear. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities were recorded at PVT diagnosis. In addition,
we longitudinally assessed the use of anticoagulation
therapy with LMWH or phenprocoumon. The course
of PVT was recorded as (i) regression, (ii) stable or
(iii) progression. Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy
were graded according to the Child-Pugh score at PVT
diagnosis and at follow-up. Moreover, bleeding events
during follow-up were recorded.
Laboratory parameters
Serum levels of creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, and
liver enzymes were recorded at PVT diagnosis and at
follow-up. Furthermore, prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were assessed at
both time points (baseline and follow-up) and Model
for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh
scores were calculated.

Definitions, time points and groups
Patient data were assessed at baseline and at last
follow-up (as defined by the last available imaging).
For analysis, patients were devided into groups two
times: (1) patients receiving early anticoagulation vs.
patients not receiving anticoagulation/delayed start
of anticoagulation and (2) patients receiving longterm anticoagulation vs. no anticoagulation/shortterm anticoagulation. Long-term anticoagulation was
defined as at least 9 months and until the end of
follow-up. Major bleeding was defined according to
the recent Baveno V consensus workshop [18]: active
bleeding at endoscopy after the start of a specific drug
treatment, with a drop of ≥3 g/dl of hemoglobin or
bleeding requiring blood transfusion with an adjusted
blood transfusion requirement index (ABRI) ≥0.75 at
any time point.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics 23 (SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) and/or
GraphPad Prism (version 6.00, GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA, USA). Continuous variables were reported
as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile
range). Categorical variables were reported as number (proportion) of patients with/without the certain
characteristic. The clinical course of PVT was described by calculating the proportion of patients that
showed (i) regression, (ii) stable PVT and (iii) progression of PVT. We used the parametric Student’s t-test
for group comparisons if applicable. Otherwise, nonparametric tests were used (e. g. Wilcoxon MannWhitney U-test). Group comparisons of categorical
variables were performed using either Pearson’s χ2-test
or Fisher’s exact test. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patients’ characteristics
We identified a total of 122 patients diagnosed with
PVT at our center, whereby 71 patients had to be
excluded due to underlying malignancies. Thus,
51 patients with non-malignant PVT were included in
this analysis (Fig. 1). The majority of patients were
male (62.7%) with a mean age of 52.9 ± 12.5 years.
The main etiology of liver disease was alcohol abuse
in 24 patients (47.1%). Non-selective beta-blockers
(NSBB) were used by 22 patients (43.1%) and most
were on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (n= 45,
88.2%). Patients were followed for a median time of
44.1 (14.0–79.1) months. Anticoagulation treatment
(n= 16 patients) was maintained for a median time of
12.0 (8.7–29.0) months (Table 1).
Clinical presentation at PVT diagnosis
At PVT diagnosis, 14 patients (27.5%) had compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh stage A), while 37 patients
had decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh stage B:
n= 19, 37.3%; Child-Pugh stage C: n= 18, 35.3%). The

mean MELD score was 13.6 ± 6.5 points. Most patients
had esophageal varices (n= 39, 76.5%) and 21 patients
(41.2%) presented with a history of variceal bleeding.
Two thirds of patients (n= 34, 66.7%) showed ascites
at the time of PVT diagnosis, while overt hepatic encephalopathy was less common (n= 7, 13.7%). Half of
patients (n = 27, 52.9%) showed incomplete PVT and
n= 24 patients (47.1%) had complete PVT (Table 1).
Early anticoagulation and regression rates of PVT
Following endoscopic evaluation, n= 12 patients
(23.5%) were started with early (<10 days after PVT
diagnosis) anticoagulation (Fig. 1). This decision to
start early anticoagulation was at the discretion of
the treating physician. In the group of patients being
started with anticoagulation the proportion of female
patients was higher (p= 0.04) and more patients without anticoagulation were taking NSBB (p= 0.03). The
other baseline characteristics of patients receiving
vs. not receiving early anticoagulation did not differ.
Anticoagulation was initially achieved with LMWH
and followed by oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon (target INR levels 1.5–2.0).
When comparing PVT regression rates of patients
with (n= 12) and without (n= 39) early AC, we found
higher PVT regression rates (42% vs. 31%) and a lower
rate of PVT progression (25% vs. 38%); however this
result did not attain statistical significance (p= 0.67).
Long-term anticoagulation and outcome of PVT
While three patients (5.9%) died early during followup and were excluded from further analysis, in four
patients (8.3%) anticoagulation was stopped and in
four other patients anticoagulation was started during follow-up. Finally, 12 patients (25.0%) were kept
on long-term anticoagulation therapy (AC, Fig. 1). Patients receiving long-term AC showed a trend towards
higher PVT regression rates (58% vs. 28% in patients
receiving vs. not receiving long-term AC; p= 0.08).
Long-term anticoagulation and outcome of PVT in
patients with decompensated cirrhosis
In total, 39 patients experienced decompensation of
liver disease (history of or current ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding) prior to PVT diagnosis. In this subgroup, a quarter of patients (n= 10,
25.6%) received long-term anticoagulation which resulted in a significantly higher rate of PVT regression
when compared to patients without long-term anticoagulation (70% vs. 24%, p= 0.031; Table 2).
Effects of anticoagulation on serum transaminases
At PVT diagnosis, median levels of AST (35 [IQR:33] vs.
34 [IQR:36] IU/ml; p= 0.74) and ALT (34 [IQR:25] vs.
24 [IQR:23] IU/ml; p= 0.33) were similar in patients
who subsequently received and in those who did not
receive long-term AC (Fig. 2a, b). During long-term
AC, liver enzymes decreased to median values of AST:
32 (IQR:24) IU/ml (–19%) and ALT: 26 (IQR:19) IU/ml
(–16%) but increased without AC to AST: 47 (IQR:41)
IU/ml (+17%) and ALT: 29 (IQR:25) IU/ml (+3%). However, the differences in the change of AST/ALT between patients with versus without long-term AC did
not attain significance (AST: p= 0.43; ALT: p= 0.15).
Impact of anticoagulation on ascites control and
liver synthetic function

ascites at time of PVT diagnosis, ascites control was

When assessing album levels as a marker of liver
synthesis, there was no difference in albumin levels between patients with and without subsequent
AC: 31.1 (IQR:13.6) vs. 35.1 (IQR:8.7) g/dl (p= 0.79)
at the time of PVT diagnosis. However, after longterm AC, serum albumin levels increased to 43.8
(IQR:14.5) g/dl, while albumin levels remained unchanged in patients without AC during follow-up:
32.2 (IQR:10.5) g/dl. Importantly, albumin levels significantly improved in patients receiving long-term
AC when compared to patients without long-term AC
(+9% or +3.6 g/dl vs. –2% or –0.8 g/dl; p= 0.04; Fig. 2d).
Safety of anticoagulation in patients with nonmalignant PVT
At baseline, 20 patients reported a history of variceal
bleeding, 4 patients (33.3%) in the long-term AC group
and 16 patients (44.4%) in the without long-term AC
group (p= 0.50). In total, 16 bleeding episodes were
registered in 8 patients (15.7%) within the study period
and 2 patients (2.4%) died because of variceal bleeding
(Table 3). Importantly, no bleeding episodes occurred
in patients receiving AC (p= 0.045).

aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tended to decrease with long-term anticoagulation (–19%, –16%), AST/ALT increased in patients without anticoagulation (+17%, +3%). c While the proportion of patients
with ascites decreased with long-term anticoagulation (from
9 to 5 patients, –33%), the number of patients with ascites
remained unchanged without anticoagulation. d Serum albumin levels increased with long-term anticoagulation (+3.6 g/dl,
+9%) but remained stable in patients without anticoagulation
(–0.8 g/dl, –2%)
and had a non-cirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis (70%). More detailed baseline characteristics can
be found in Table 4. While 4 patients (40%) were
treated with edoxaban (3 patients: 30mg once daily;
1 patient: 60mg once daily), 3 patients (30%) received
apixaban (5mg twice daily), 2 patients (20%) rivaroxaban (10mg once daily) and 1 patient (10%) dabigatran
(110mg twice daily). The majority of patients were
switched to DOACs in the setting of chronic PVT
with cavernous transformation in order to prevent
progression/extension of splanchnic vein thrombosis and potentially to improve splanchnic, intestinal
and hepatic microcirculation. In this setting AC therapy can of course not recanalize PVT and treatment
response can only be measured as non-progression
of PVT. Therefore, comparison of treatment success
between DOAC patients and patients treated with
conventional AC was not performed. Median follow-up on DOAC treatment was 9.2 (IQR: 5.4–13-7)
months. One bleeding event (i.e. bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy) occurred during DOAC
treatment.
Review of the literature on the course of PVT and
efficacy of anticoagulation
Of the studies eight (five prospective cohort studies,
one prospective randomized cohort study and two
retrospective cohort studies) were identified that reported the outcome of PVT and data on the efficacy
and safety of anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients with non-malignant PVT [8–14, 19] (Table 5).
Most studies used either LMWH (mostly nadroparin
or enoxaparin) or VKA (mostly after starting AC with
LMWH first). The reported PVT resolution rates
ranged from 42.1% to 82% and were consistantly
higher with anticoagulation [11, 14]. The incidence
of bleeding was low and the severity of the bleeding
events reported was mild or moderate [10, 12, 14, 19].
A VKA therapy was usually adapted to reach an INR
between 2–3 [11, 14].

Discussion
In our series of patients with non-malignant PVT,
anticoagulation resulted in a trend towards higher
regression rates and a decreased risk of PVT progression. While the risk of PVT progression could not be
completely abolished by the use of anticoagulation,
we observed beneficial impacts on hepatic inflammation and liver function: Interestingly, in patients
with long-term anticoagulation, the levels of transaminases (AST/ALT) decreased numerically and albumin
as a parameter of liver synthesis function increased
significantly. Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis including patients with previously decompensated liver
disease, we observed statistically significant higher
PVT regression rates with long-term anticoagulation.
This is especially important as patients with decompensated cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing
complications and there is a pronounced need for
successful treatment of PVT [20–22]. Importantly,
the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was not
increased with anticoagulation and even in patients
presenting with previous variceal bleeding at PVT
diagnosis no re-bleeding occurred during follow-up.
It can be concluded that AC in cirrhotic patients
even with previous variceal bleeding can be started
safely after endoscopic exclusion of potential highrisk bleeding sites. In our clinic, if high-risk varices
are present at screening, anticoagulation therapy is
started after appropriate treatment of varices (verified
hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy or endoscopic band ligation).
The observed PVT regression rate in our patient
series was 58% when anticoagulation was given as
long-term treatment. This finding is consistent with
previous studies reporting regression/resolution rates
ranging from 42.1% [11] up to 82% [14]. While the
proportion of patients achieving regression of PVT on
anticoagulation was numerically higher in the whole
cohort and statistically significantly higher in patients
with decompensated liver disease, the low number of
patients with compensated liver disease treated with
anticoagulation (n= 2) limited the statistical power of
our analysis in the whole cohort, and thus, the difference in resolution/recanalization rate did not attain statistical significance. Nevertheless, the numerically higher PVT regression/resolution rates with anticoagulation represent a clinically relevant effect size
and anticoagulation should be offered to all patients
with PVT in the absence of absolute contraindications
(such as active gastrointestinal bleeding or a history
of intracranial bleeding).
While bleeding rates and severe bleeding events
were not consistently reported across all studies,
bleedings were usually mild and variceal bleeding
was rare [10, 11, 13, 14]. In our study, no bleeding
occurred in patients receiving conventional AC. In
patients treated with DOACs one bleeding episode
occurred; however, bleeding was controlled endoscopically (with argon plasma coagulation) and treatment could be restarted. This is in line with the
results of another study, in which the authors did not
observe an increased bleeding risk in patients with
cirrhosis receiving novel direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban or apixaban), when compared to LMWH/
phenprocoumon [23].
The safety of anticoagulation in patients with PVT
could also be explained by potential beneficial effects
on intrahepatic vascular resistance, which were recently described in an experimental study in cirrhotic
rats treated with enoxaparin [16]. Interestingly, longterm administration of enoxaparin reduced portal
pressure by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation
(dynamic component of portal hypertension), decreasing liver fibrosis (structural component of portal
hypertension) and by prevention of intrasinusoidal
microthrombosis [16].
We found a decrease in serum transaminases with
long-term anticoagulation, as both AST and ALT levels dropped (by –19% and –16%, respectively) while
AST/ALT increased without long-term anticoagulation
(+17%/+3%). This suggests that the beneficial effects
of enoxaparin described in the experimental study by
Cerini et al. [16] might also lead to a decrease in hepatic necroinflammation in cirrhotic patients with PVT.
Most interestingly, long-term anticoagulation was also
associated with a better control of ascites during follow-up, as four out of nine patients with ascites at
PVT diagnosis achieved control of ascites, while the
number of patients with ascites remained stable in
patients without long-term AC. In addition, we also
found a significant increase in serum albumin under long-term anticoagulation (+3.6 g/dl /+9%) while
serum albumin levels were almost unchanged in patients without long-term anticoagulation.
Our findings indicate that anticoagulation therapy
leads to improvements in liver dysfunction and is
in line with a previous study showing a decrease in
hepatic decompensation with LMWH [17]. In line
with our subgroup analysis, in the latter study, all patients were already decompensated at start of LMWH
(Child-Pugh B7-C10 was an inclusion criterion) and
no patients had PVT at inclusion. The study was
designed to assess if prophylactic LMWH can prevent PVT, which was the case, but the even more
interesting findings were the delay in hepatic decompensation during enoxaparin treatment (11.7% vs.
59.6% in the control group) and increased survival
rate in the enoxaparin treated group [17].
While the study by Villa et al. [17] and our findings in this retrospective analysis would both suggest
a clinical benefit of anticoagulation on liver dysfunction in cirrhosis, these effects have to be confirmed
in larger prospective studies in patients with cirrhosis
with and without PVT. The monitoring of traditional
anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis represents
a clinical challenge [24, 25] and while DOACs seem

to be attractive alternative options, their efficacy and
safety in cirrhosis has yet to be evaluated [26].
In conclusion, our findings support the use of AC
in patients with non-malignant PVT, since AC is not
only safe and associated with superior PVT regression/
resolution rates, but might also decrease hepatic inflammation and improve liver synthesis.
