Abstract
Background: The premature infant gut has low individual but high inter-individual microbial diversity compared
with adults. Based on prior 16S rRNA gene surveys, many species from this environment are expected to be similar
to those previously detected in the human microbiota. However, the level of genomic novelty and metabolic
variation of strains found in the infant gut remains relatively unexplored.
Results: To study the stability and function of early microbial colonizers of the premature infant gut, nine stool
samples were taken during the third week of life of a premature male infant delivered via Caesarean section.
Metagenomic sequences were assembled and binned into near-complete and partial genomes, enabling
strain-level genomic analysis of the microbial community.
We reconstructed eleven near-complete and six partial bacterial genomes representative of the key members of the
microbial community. Twelve of these genomes share >90% putative ortholog amino acid identity with reference
genomes. Manual curation of the assembly of one particularly novel genome resulted in the first essentially
complete genome sequence (in three pieces, the order of which could not be determined due to a repeat) for
Varibaculum cambriense (strain Dora), a medically relevant species that has been implicated in abscess formation.
During the period studied, the microbial community undergoes a compositional shift, in which obligate anaerobes
(fermenters) overtake Escherichia coli as the most abundant species. Other species remain stable, probably due to
their ability to either respire anaerobically or grow by fermentation, and their capacity to tolerate fluctuating levels
of oxygen. Metabolic predictions for V. cambriense suggest that, like other members of the microbial community,
this organism is able to process various sugar substrates and make use of multiple different electron acceptors
during anaerobic respiration. Genome comparisons within the family Actinomycetaceae reveal important differences
related to respiratory metabolism and motility.

Conclusions: Genome-based analysis provided direct insight into strain-specific potential for anaerobic respiration
and yielded the first genome for the genus Varibaculum. Importantly, comparison of these de novo assembled
genomes with closely related isolate genomes supported the accuracy of the metagenomic methodology. Over a
one-week period, the early gut microbial community transitioned to a community with a higher representation of
obligate anaerobes, emphasizing both taxonomic and metabolic instability during colonization.

Background
The human adult microbiota consists of 10-fold more
cells than the human body (the majority reside in the gut)
and 100-fold more genes than the human genome [1-3].
The gut microbiota are involved in host nutrient acquisition [4], regulation and development of the host immune
system [5,6], and the modulation of host gene expression
[7]. All of these influences have the potential to seriously
affect human health. Aberrations in gut microbiota
membership and community structure, termed microbial
dysbiosis, have been associated with obesity [8] and diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease [9], both type 1 and
type 2 diabetes [10,11], and necrotizing enterocolitis in
premature infants [12-14]. Although previous studies have
focused on gut colonization [15,16], few have shown the
process in a high-resolution manner [17,18]. Thus, much
is still not known about the diversity, metabolic potential,
or roles of early gut colonizers.
Although the gut microbiota of infants is characterized
by high levels of inter-individual diversity (beta diversity),
community composition begins to look like that of adults
within the first year of life [15]. In comparison with both
adults and infants, premature infants have especially low
individual diversity (alpha diversity), making them ideal
subjects for high-resolution (species or strain-level) community genomics approaches [17,18]. Continued study of
microbial colonization in the gut of premature infants may
yield further insights into the details of this process and the
implications of disease-associated microbial dysbiosis.
Community genomics, the use of genomes sequenced
from natural microbial communities to understand the
structure and metabolism of the community, has been
successful in environments with varying levels of diversity [17-24]. Recently, this approach has been applied to
the human microbiome, where the genomes of abundant
bacterial species were assembled from a premature infant
[17] and, most recently, where increased sequencing depth
allowed for genomes to be assembled for both highabundance and low-abundance members of the microbial
community found in the gut of another premature infant
(including genomes for members that make up less than
0.05% of the microbial community) [18]. Both of these
studies involved analysis of strain-level variation within
the human gut microbiome. In human adults, a draft genome of Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli O104:H4 was assembled from metagenome data taken from individuals
involved in an outbreak, providing strain-level resolution
of this pathogen [25]. Strain-level analysis of microbial
communities contrasts strongly with 16S rRNA-based fingerprinting methods that characterize communities with
phylum to genus-level resolution. This is primarily due to
the added benefit of being able to directly determine the
metabolic potential of strains in a particular community
(which need not have been previously studied), and to identify metabolic variation between strains that may have highly
similar or even identical 16S rRNA gene sequences [26]. In
general, the study of infants enables development of an understanding of microbial colonization in humans, and can
provide genomes for biologically and medically relevant,
and oftentimes novel, species directly from their source environments (without the bias of isolation or cell sorting, or
single cell manipulation and genome amplification steps).
Here, we investigate gut colonization in a relatively
healthy premature infant during the third week of life with
the objectives of comparing genomic novelty between the
natural consortia and isolate strains, recovery and analysis
of genomes from previously uncharacterized community members, and metabolic analysis of the microbial
community. This period of early gut colonization was
targeted for intensive sample collection because it is
believed that aberrant colonization near this time can
contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis
(which was not observed in this infant). Our approach
involves reconstructing complete and near-complete
genomes from DNA extracted from fecal samples to
enable prediction of the roles of specific species and
strains in the community. Time series abundance analysis is a key component of the approach because shifts
in community composition can be detected, and also
because organism abundance patterns greatly increase
the accuracy with which assembled fragments can be
assigned to specific organisms (binning; [18]). We show
that, even in the human gut, where many species can be
represented by reference genomes, there are organisms
with genomic potential not represented by reference sequences. Specifically, we report the first genome for the

genus Varibaculum, a genus that has been implicated in
human abscess formation, but that has not been associated with the human gut [27].
Methods
Patient, samples, and sequencing
We studied the colonization of the gut of a male (birth
weight 1,205 g) born via Caesarean section during the
31st week of pregnancy to a mother with chronic hypertension and superimposed pre-eclampsia. The patient
was born at Comer Children’s Hospital at the University
of Chicago. He was administered total parenteral nutrition
(TPN) soon after admission, but started bolus nasogastric
feeding on his second day of life (DOL). The patient was
weaned from TPN as he began increasing feeds with
fortified breast milk. TPN was discontinued on DOL 6.
The patient reached full feeds on DOL 8, continuing to
be fed on fortified breast milk. The patient was never
intubated but did briefly receive supplemental oxygen.
He received antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) only
during the first 48 hours of life. Stool samples were collected on the following days of life: 14, 15, 18, 19, and
20. Samples were collected twice daily, except for DOL
14, and stored at −80°C. The patient was discharged in
good health on DOL 53.
Microbial DNA was extracted from frozen fecal samples
using the QIAamp DNA Stool mini-Kit (Qiagen) with
modifications [28]. DNA was sequenced on an Illumina
HiSeq2000 sequencer for 101 cycles from each DNA fragment end using the TruSeq SBS sequencing kit (version 2).
Sequencing data were handled with pipeline 1.7 according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
The protocol for sample collection and processing was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University
of Chicago (IRB #15895A). All samples were collected with
the consent of the infant’s mother.
Metagenome assembly, binning, and annotation
Environmental shotgun DNA sequences for all samples
were processed and assembled as previously described [18].
Sequences were quality trimmed and human DNA was
filtered out prior to assembly. Sequences from all samples
were co-assembled in a multistep, iterative approach, in
which optimal parameters (coverage and k-mer length) for
assembly of genomes from specific populations or groups
of populations were selected. Velvet [29] was used to
assemble the data and the resulting assembly was subjected to quality controls that detect mis-assemblies based
on regions of zero insert coverage.
All scaffolds longer than 400 bp were annotated by
first predicting open reading frames (ORFs) using the
metagenome implementation of Prodigal [30] and then
searching translated ORFs against the UniProt UniRef90
database [31] using USEARCH [32] with an E-value
threshold of 0.001. The coverage of each scaffold was
determined by mapping reads using BowTie [33] with the
parameters -best and -e 200. Coverage was calculated as
the total number of sequence bases mapped to a scaffold
divided by the length of the scaffold.
Clustering of scaffolds into genome bins was conducted
as previously described [18]. Specifically, the Databionic
implementation of an emergent self-organizing map
(ESOM; [34]) was used to cluster scaffolds longer than 400
base pairs (bp) based on their time series abundance patterns (after first breaking scaffolds into 1.5 kbp fragments)
(Additional file 1). This allowed us to bin scaffolds into
near-complete and partial genomes. Genome bins were
assessed in part by coloring fragments clustered on the
ESOM based on the best BLAST [35] hit of each scaffold
against the NCBI NT database [36] (Additional file 2:
Figure S1). Bins were manually extracted by contouring
fields on the ESOM. Genome completeness was determined by comparing the length of each putative genome with the most closely related reference genome
and by searching for 26 universal single copy marker
genes (Additional file 3 and [37]).
Manual curation of microbial genome bins
Each genome bin was evaluated based on its size, coverage,
and the presence of single copy genes. Single copy genes
were used to estimate genome completeness and to determine whether multiple genomes were being clustered
into a single bin. Incomplete bins may be the result of
several factors: (i) low coverage can prevent an entire
genome from being assembled; (ii) sequence variation
can cause genomic regions unique to strains to assemble
separately, sometimes generating very small contigs that
cannot be binned; (iii) strain-specific genomic regions will
be binned separately from shared regions if the time series
abundance patterns of the strains differ; and (iv) inherent
noise in coverage calculations can result in scaffolds representing a genome being placed in separate bins. Bins with
similar taxonomic affiliations were evaluated to determine
whether their scaffolds were split into different bins owing
to strain variation or noise in coverage calculations. Such
bins were subsequently combined into a single genome
bin if they did not contain redundant single copy genes.
Other bins with similar taxonomic affiliations but with
overall different time series abundance patterns were
considered to be the result of strain variation.
The genome assembled and binned for V. cambriense
was reassembled and manually curated. This involved
analyzing the read mapping for the entire metagenome
assembly and capturing the reads (along with their pairs)
that mapped to scaffolds in the V. cambriense bin. These
reads were then used in several Velvet assemblies, in which
the parameters for k-mer length and expected coverage
were altered. Genome size was estimated based on the size
Brown et al. Microbiome 2013, 1:30 Page 3 of 19
http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/30

of the bin and used to evaluate the Velvet assemblies. The
best assembly based on expected length and N50 was
checked for mis-assemblies (scaffolds were split at regions
with zero insert coverage) and then manually curated.
The genome for V. cambriense was manually curated
using a suite of in-house scripts designed to extend
scaffolds by recruiting paired-reads that extend from
existing scaffolds. These paired-reads were assembled
independently using Velvet. Their resulting contigs were
compared with existing scaffolds, based on their sequence
similarity determined by BLAST. Regions of high similarity between the newly assembled contigs and existing scaffolds oftentimes reveal scaffolds that could be combined
with one another [18].
Open reading frames for the manually curated V.
cambriense genome were annotated using an in-house
pipeline that includes BLAST-based homology searches
against the NCBI NR [36], KEGG [38], UniRef90, and
COG [39] databases, in addition to HMM-based functional domain recognition searches using InterProScan
[40]. Metabolic analysis of the functional predictions
for the V. cambriense genome was completed using
Pathway Tools [41] and KEGG [42] (Additional file 4 and
Additional file 5).
Plasmid and phage genomes
Plasmid genomes were identified by searching for potentially
circular scaffolds by computing the Needleman-Wunsch
[43] global alignment for the first and last 100 bp of the scaffold. Scaffolds with high overlap identity were further analyzed by searching those scaffolds for genes indicative of
plasmids (such as plasmid replication and maintenance proteins). Putative phage fragments were identified by searching
for phage-related genes (such as the capsid or tail fibers)
on unbinned scaffolds and on scaffolds binned along
with a genome. Phage scaffolds binned with bacterial
genomes have significantly higher coverage than the
bacterial-associated scaffolds.
Plasmids were associated with individual species in the
community by comparing the abundance patterns of
each plasmid with each species and by leveraging plasmid
phylogenetic annotations. To narrow down the list of
possible host organisms for each plasmid, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated on the abundance
pattern of each plasmid compared with each bacterial species. Putative phage fragments were associated with species
based on initial ESOM binning, searching for integration
sites in reconstructed genomes, and by comparing the
relative abundance patterns of phage with bacterial species
(assisted by the Pearson correlation coefficient).
Plasmid novelty and diversity were determined by
building a phylogenetic tree of plasmid replication proteins. Sequences representative of closely related plasmid
replication proteins were acquired by searching the NCBI
NR database using BLAST. The amino acid sequences
were aligned using MUSCLE [44] and a phylogenetic
tree was reconstructed using FastTree2 [45] with the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid evolution
and by assuming a single rate of evolution for each site
(known as the “CAT” approximation) [46]. Local support
values were calculated with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
[47] and the tree was formatted using FigTree [48].
Coverage and abundance calculations
Coverage was calculated for each scaffold based on mapped
reads. Absolute abundance, average coverage, and relative
abundance were calculated for reconstructed genomes at
each time point, in order to represent changes in microbial
community structure (Additional file 2: Tables S2-5).
Genome coverage was calculated as the number of bases
mapped to the genome divided by the total length of the
genome. Relative abundance was calculated for a genome
by taking the average coverage of the genome and normalizing it by the sum of the average coverage values for all
genomes. Thus, relative abundance is the abundance of a
genome taken as a percent of the total abundance of all genomes. Absolute abundance was calculated for each genome by dividing the total number of sequence bases that
mapped to the genome by the total number of bases associated with reads used in the assembly. Rank abundance
was calculated from the relative abundance of each genome from the combined read mapping of the time
points in each phase of community colonization (phases
were defined after observing community abundance patterns across the time series). Plots of relative abundance
were created using the R plot function [49].
Microbial community composition based on EMIRGE 16S
rRNA genes
EMIRGE [50] was used to reconstruct 16S rRNA gene
sequences from the metagenomic data (Additional file 6).
The closest relatives of each sequence were found by
searching a TaxCollector [51] version of the Ribosomal
Database Project (RDP) database [52] and the GreenGenes
[53] database using BLAST. Reconstructed 16S rRNA
gene sequences were connected with genomes based on
several criteria. First, paired-end sequences were used
to link scaffolds carrying fragments of 16S rRNA gene
sequences to genome scaffolds. Then, coverage and
taxonomic information, from both marker genes and for
the genome overall, were used to refine associations
when paired-read connections were inconclusive. More
16S rRNA gene sequences were reconstructed by
EMIRGE than could be represented by genome bins;
thus, a subset of low-abundance 16S rRNA gene sequences were assumed to be either incorrectly reconstructed or from very rare community members, and
thus were disregarded during further analyses.
Brown et al. Microbiome 2013, 1:30 Page 4 of 19
http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/30

Reconstructed 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned
along with sequences from their closest relatives and
additional species previously reported to be in the infant
gut. Sequences were aligned with PyNAST [54] using the
GreenGenes [53] alignment of operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) classified at 97% sequence similarity as a template.
FastTree2 was used to construct the phylogenetic tree using
the generalized time-reversible model for nucleotide evolution [55] and the CAT approximation. Local support values
were calculated with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. The
tree was rooted with the 16S rRNA gene sequence for
Halobacterium salinarum and formatted using FigTree.
Comparison of genomes with reference genomes
Each complete, near-complete, and partial bacterial and
plasmid genome was compared to the genome of its closest
sequenced relative. Both complete and draft genomes from
NCBI were used in the comparison. The most closely
related bacterial genomes were determined using reconstructed 16S rRNA gene sequences, ribosomal protein L5,
ribosomal protein S15, and hits to other protein sequences
in UniRef90. Aligning reconstructed plasmid genomes to
all available sequenced plasmid genomes identified their
most closely related relatives. Once selected, each genome
was compared to its reference genome. The shared amino
acid identity between each reconstructed and reference
genome was calculated as the average amino acid identity
of reciprocal best USEARCH hits between the two genomes (putative orthologs).
Evaluating community oxygen tolerance and
respiration capability
Community oxygen tolerance and respiration capacity
were evaluated based on the presence of specific genes in
the metagenome. To assess the oxygen utilization capacity
of the community, all predicted ORFs were searched
for cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome bd oxidase, and
heme-copper cytochrome oxidase genes based on assignments from UniRef90. To evaluate the potential for
the community to use various terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration, UniRef90 annotations were
searched for the presence of fumarate, trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), nitrate,
nitrite, and nitric oxide reductase genes. To confirm the
annotations for these genes in the V. cambriense genome,
a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with the amino acid
sequences of the putative catalytic subunits for the nitrate
reductase and DMSO reductase genes. The tree was
reconstructed using MEGA5 [56] to produce a maximumlikelihood phylogeny calculated with 100 bootstrap replicates based on the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino
acid evolution. All positions containing alignment gaps and
missing data were eliminated based on pairwise sequence
comparisons (pairwise deletion option).
Analysis of Human Microbiome Project data
The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) [57] hosts
QIIME [58] output files for the HMP 16S rRNA Clinical
Production Phase I and the HMP 454 Clinical Production
Pilot studies (NCBI SRA projects SRP002395 and
SRP002012, respectively), which together consist of over
5,700 samples. The 16S rRNA gene variable region 3 to 5
(V35) was sequenced for all samples and the 16S variable
region 1 to 3 (V13) was sequenced for a subset of 2,911
samples. The OTU abundance matrices were downloaded
for each dataset (V35 and V13) and the abundance of each
OTU was calculated as a percent of total reads for each
sample. These tables were used to evaluate the relative
abundance of Varibaculum across samples and body sites
in the HMP data collected for healthy human adults.
Comparative genomics
Although there are no previously sequenced genomes for
any member of the genus Varibaculum, several complete
and draft genomes are available for members of the family
Actinomycetaceae. These genomes, along with the genomes
reconstructed from the microbial community of this
premature infant, were used in a comparative analysis.
Each genome was annotated by finding reciprocal best
USEARCH hits between each genome and a subset of
the KEGG database containing only prokaryotic protein
sequences with KOs (with a minimum bit score of 40 and
maximum E-value of 0.01). Metabolic functional potential
was compared across genomes by identifying gene sequences associated with specific metabolic functions in
each genome (see Additional file 7 for a complete list of
these proteins and their associations). These findings were
visualized by normalizing the number of genes identified
for each function and then using the R pheatmap library
to produce a heatmap clustered using the complete linkage method on a Euclidean distance matrix.
Results
Metagenome sequencing, assembly, binning,
and annotation
The nine samples collected on days of life 14 through
20 from the infant in our study resulted in 35 gigabase
pairs (Gbp) of paired-end Illumina DNA sequences with
a length of 101 nucleotides. Filtering out human DNA
and quality trimming resulted in 27.8 Gbp of Illumina
reads with an average length of 93 bp. The iterative
metagenome assembly method used resulted in 89.29%
of high quality reads being assembled into 12,184 scaffolds
longer than 400 bp (40.8 megabase pairs (Mbp), N50:
13,265 bp, longest scaffold: 608,611 bp). From the scaffolds larger than 400 bp, 46,156 ORFs were predicted
(average amino acid length: 254), 94.4% of which had a
match to the UniRef90 database with an E-value less
than or equal to 0.001.

Scaffolds were clustered based on their time series
abundance patterns using an ESOM, resulting in 25 bins
(Figure 1, Additional file 2: Table S1 and Additional file 1).
These bins represent complete, near-complete, and partial bacterial, plasmid, and viral genomes (Table 1 and
Additional file 2: Table S1) and 85.98% of high quality
sequencing reads. Six complete (circular) plasmids were
assembled along with five putative phage fragments
(Table 1 and Additional file 2: Table S4). Plasmid and
phage fragments account for only 0.27% and 0.23% of the
total sequence data, respectively; however, they account
for the majority of the community in terms of relative

abundance (41.7% and 16.6%; Table 1 and Additional file 2:
Table S4).
Microbial genome identification and curation
Well-defined genomes were binned for Clostridium
butyricum, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus,
Streptococcus sp., and Varibaculum cambriense. However, some bins were not clearly delineated owing to
the low abundance of the associated species (at the
limits of sequencing detection), similar abundance
patterns between species, or coverage miscalculations
due to strain variation. This was the case for the bins
of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Clostridium bartlettii, two
Escherichia coli strains, Leuconostoc sp., Negativicoccus
succinicivorans, Propionibacterium sp., Staphylococcus sp.,
Streptococcus parasanguinis, Veillonella dispar, and two
additional Veillonella species. Manual curation of these
bins resulted in near-complete and partial genome reconstructions for these species, and revealed strainresolved genomic novelty within the E. coli population
(Table 1 and [59]).
We evaluated the completeness of each genome using
a list of 26 single copy marker genes (Additional file 3
and [37]), revealing that the genomes for Actinomyces
urogenitalis, Clostridium bartlettii, Clostridium butyricum,
Enterococcus faecalis, Negativicoccus succinicivorans,
Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus parasanguinis,
Varibaculum cambriense, and Veillonella dispar (9 out
of the 17 total genomes) are near-complete (over 75%
of marker genes could be identified) (Table 1).

The genome for Varibaculum cambriense was reassembled and manually curated. Before reassembly, the
genome was represented by 35 scaffolds with a total
length of 2.25 Mbp and an N50 of 240,417 bp. Following
reassembly and manual curation, the genome was assembled into three scaffolds, each terminated by a repeat sequence corresponding to a transposase gene. The
three scaffolds include completely assembled 16S rRNA
and 23S rRNA genes, a total length of 2.28 Mbp, an N50
of 1,648,569 bp, and 105-fold coverage. The V. cambriense
genome has a GC-content of 52.5%. Approximately 70%
of ORFs could be assigned to a putative function. All three
scaffolds are connected to each other but their order cannot be determined; thus, all connections are resolved and
we consider this genome to be essentially complete.
Furthermore, all of the single copy marker genes used
to assess genome completeness could be identified along
with all 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase genes in the
V. cambriense genome (Additional file 3).
The assembled E. coli plasmid has the highest copy number of any assembled plasmid, phage, or bacterial member
of the community (Table 1 and Additional file 2: Table S4).
The plasmid contains a replication protein distinct
from other Enterobacteriaceae plasmids, suggesting
that it is novel (Additional file 2: Figure S3). The largest plasmid (47.63 kbp) is associated with Veillonella
sp. - species A, and also contains a novel replication
protein (Additional file 2: Figure S3), indicating that this
plasmid has not been previously studied. Two plasmids are
related to known Staphylococcus plasmids and are highly
correlated with one another (Pearson coefficient = 0.89),
although they are not closely related to one another (based
on their replication proteins; Additional file 2: Figure S3).
Based on the annotations and abundance patterns for these
plasmids, their host is the Staphylococcus sp., for which
we reconstructed a near-complete genome (Pearson
coefficients of 0.45 and 0.62). Additionally, a complete
plasmid genome was assembled and associated with S.
parasanguinis (based on protein annotations and time
series abundance patterns; Pearson coefficient = 0.99).
Phylogenetic placement of EMIRGE-based 16S rRNA genes
EMIRGE reconstructed 77 candidate 16S rRNA gene
sequences, 14 of which could be associated with reconstructed genomes (Table 2 and Additional file 6). The
discrepancy between the number of EMIRGE sequences
and genomes suggests that EMIRGE is overestimating the
number of OTUs. Genes constructed by EMIRGE that
could not be assigned to genomes were related to Shigella
(probably represented by binned E. coli genomes),
Okadaella, Buttiauxella, Brevibacterium, and Citrobacter.
Of these, low-abundance ORFs from the community could
be assigned to the genus Brevibacterium at greater than
90% amino acid identity, and to Citrobacter, but at less than
90% amino acid identity, suggesting the possible presence
of these genera in low abundance in the community.
EMIRGE sequences that were not connected with bins
were not analyzed further.
The 16S rRNA gene sequences reconstructed with
EMIRGE were used to build a phylogenetic tree to classify
organisms in the community (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
The tree shows that many of the reconstructed genomes
are very closely related to sequenced genomes, based on
their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The tree highlights the
lack of reference genomes for Varibaculum, although
there are numerous 16S rRNA gene sequences from isolates and from clone libraries. Phylogenetic placement of
the EMIRGE sequence for bin 20 confirms that this genome is from a member of the species V. cambriense
(99.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity).
Comparison of reconstructed genomes to reference genomes
The 25 ESOM bins represent the genomes of 17 unique
organisms from the microbial community. Of the nine
reconstructed near-complete genomes, seven share over
90% ortholog amino acid identity with reference strains,
while five share over 95% ortholog amino acid identity
(with at least 60% of ORFs being defined as orthologs)
(Table 2). Despite this high-level of similarity, 14% of the
ORFs predicted for near-complete reconstructed genomes
do not have orthologs within their most closely related
reference genomes. At the extreme, 57% of the predicted
ORFs for Negativicoccus succinicivorans are not orthologous with genes found in the most closely related reference genome (Table 2). Although the level of genomic
divergence observed here does not fall outside of the
range previously observed [60], this finding underscores
the importance of genome reconstructions, as opposed to
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, for inferring microbial
metabolic potential. Of particular note, the genome for
V. cambriense has an average ortholog amino acid sequence identity of 54% with the genome of its closest
sequenced relative, Mobiluncus mulieris (Table 2).
Evidence for the importance of anaerobic metabolism
and oxygen tolerance
Several genomes encode cytochrome bd oxidase (Table 3
and Figure 2), a high oxygen affinity enzyme indicative of
an ability to grow in the presence of low levels of oxygen,
either by providing protection from reactive oxygen species
or by using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor during
respiration [61,62]. The presence of fumarate, TMAO,
DMSO, nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide reductase genes
supports the notion that members of the community are
capable of using several terminal electron acceptors to respire anaerobically (Table 3, Figure 2, and Additional file 2:
Figure S4). E. coli was the only organism found to encode heme-copper cytochrome oxidase genes, indicating

its ability to use oxygen as an electron acceptor when
present. To further assess the oxygen utilization capacity
of the community, all binned and unbinned ORFs were
searched for cytochrome c oxidase genes, which would indicate aerobic, or possibly aero-tolerant metabolism [62],
but none were found. Taken together, we conclude that all
organisms in the community are either obligate or facultative anaerobes (Table 3 and Figure 2).
Microbial abundance and community shifts
Escherichia coli - strain A accounts for the greatest percentage of high quality sequence data and Propionibacterium sp.
accounts for the least amount (33.45% and 0.03%, respectively; Additional file 2: Table S2). Species abundance
patterns over the third week of life defined two phases of
microbial community composition (Figures 3 and 4). The
first phase is observed during DOL 14 to DOL 15, whereas
the second covers DOL 18 to DOL 20. The first phase is
defined by a dominant E. coli strain (a facultative anaerobe),
and the second phase is dominated by obligate anaerobes
(Streptococcus anginosus, Clostridium butyricum, and
Veillonella dispar). Early in the second phase (first time
point on DOL 18) there is a significant increase in the
relative abundance of Streptococcus anginosus, followed by
a stable abundance afterwards. This is followed by a spike
in the abundance of Clostridium butyricum observed on
the second time point taken on DOL 18, after which the
relative abundance immediately decreases. There is no
apparent clinical variable (for example, change in diet
or medication) that accounts for the shift between phase
one and phase two. The distinct difference in community
composition between theses phases corresponds with a
shift towards fermentation-based metabolism in the
successors of initially dominant E. coli.
V. cambriense is nearly undetectable during the first time
point (0.15%) and remains at a low abundance throughout
the time series (always ≤3%).
It is interesting to note that Streptococcus, Escherichia,
Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Enterococcus dominate the
microbial community and that, similar to observations in
other premature infants, no Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium,
or Lactobacillus were observed throughout the time
series [17,18,63].
Metabolism of V. cambriense based on genomic analysis
V. cambriense (strain Dora) (Table 3) became the focus
of further analysis for several reasons, including (i) the
lack of reference genomes available for Varibaculum
(Table 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S2), (ii) the availability
of a new, essentially complete genome (Table 1), and (iii)
the fact that members of this genus are medically relevant
and drastically understudied in the human gut [27,64,65].

Further, Varibaculum have never been studied in the
human gut at a species (or genome) level of resolution.
Finally, there is some metabolic information in Bergey’s
Manual of Systematic Bacteriology for cultured strains
of V. cambriense [66].
V. cambriense cell wall and motility
Genome analysis shows that genes involved in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway are missing, confirming
that V. cambriense does not have a Gram-negative cell envelope. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway containing
Figure 2 Metabolic analysis of reconstructed community and isolate genomes. Genomes reconstructed from the microbial community
were compared with each other and with the genomes of cultured isolates previously sequenced for members of the family Actinomycetaceae.
Each genome was annotated with KEGG and the genes that matched specific metabolic features were counted (Additional file 7). The number of
genes identified for each group was normalized across genomes to facilitate coloring and clustering. The number of genes identified for each
feature in each genome is presented on the heatmap.

meso-diaminopimelate is complete. However, the β-lactam
resistance pathway for peptidoglycan synthesis is incomplete, suggesting sensitivity to β-lactam antibiotics.
No genes for flagella, pili, or chemotaxis were identified,
indicating that this strain, like cultured members of this
species, is not motile.
V. cambriense transporters and resistance
Twenty different sugar transport ORFs were identified,
indicating that V. cambriense has the ability to use many
different types of sugars. A putative sialic acid transporter
is present, along with genes required for metabolizing
N-acetylneuraminate (discussed later), suggesting that
this abundant component of both human and non-human
cell-surface glycoproteins, human breast milk glycans, and
intestinal mucins can be used as a nutrient. Additionally,
a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter, a putative phosphotransferase IIA system, a sodium-galactoside symporter,
and multiple sugar transport system permease genes were
identified. No acetate transporter was found, although
several pathways were identified for converting pyruvate
into acetate for the bidirectional conversion between
acetyl-CoA and acetate. Complete KEGG modules suggest
that V. cambriense can transport ribose, phosphate, nickel,
lipopolysaccharides, and fructose.
Although no complete antibiotic resistance pathways
were identified, a drug resistance transporter (EmrB/QacA
subfamily) and a methicillin resistance protein are coded

for in the genome. V. cambriense has various resistance
mechanisms, including an arsenate resistance pathway,
the pathway for glycine betaine biosynthesis (a compound
capable of protecting against osmotic stress; [67]), and
a P-type ATPase for translocating copper and silver
(suggesting Cu2+ tolerance).
The genome contains the enzyme trehalose synthase,
which is necessary for trehalose synthesis from β-maltose.
The enzymes for synthesizing trehalose from glycogen were
also identified, but not the enzymes for degrading trehalose. Trehalose has several biological roles, including that
of structural component [68] and stress protector [69]. The
pathway for ppGpp is also encoded by the genome; this
pathway is known for its role in regulating responses to nutrient or energy starvation and environmental stresses [70].
V. cambriense nutrient sources
Based on the genome,V. cambriense is able to use acetoacetate, ammonia, arabinose, ethanol, fructose, glucose, glycerol,
glycogen, lactose, mannose, melibiose, ribose, sialic acid,
starch, sucrose, and xylose as nutrient sources. It is interesting to note that cultured representatives of V. cambriense
have not been shown to use either starch or xylose [66].
Fructose, glucose, glycerol, glycogen, lactose, mannose,
melibiose, starch, sucrose, and xylose can all be directed to glycolysis, for which the complete pathway

reconstructions from the shotgun-sequenced microbial community. The colonization process is broken into two distinct phases defined by the
dominance of either (a) facultative anaerobes during phase one or (b) obligate anaerobes during phase two.

was identified. Unlike other members of the community,
including A. urogenitalis (the other Actinomycetaceae),
V. cambriense does not have the enzymes for the
Entner-Doudoroff pathway (Figure 2).
The genome encodes several neuraminidases (also known
as sialidases), suggesting that V. cambriense is able to cleave
various sialic acid species from host-derived substrates.
Sialic acids are found terminally bound to cell-surface
glycoproteins, human breast milk glycans, and mucins,
but are only accessible by microbes once they have
been cleaved from their substrate [71-73]. The genome
also contains a sialic acid transporter and the enzymes
necessary for converting the predominant form of sialic
acid found in humans, N-acetylneuraminate, to D-fructose6-phosphate, which can in turn be fed into glycolysis. Thus,
unlike many bacterial species, V. cambriense is probably
able both to liberate sialic acids and to make use of them as
a nutrient source. However, the genes for the pathway that
converts N-acetylneuraminate to CMP-N-acetylneuraminate
are not present, making it unlikely that V. cambriense can
coat its outer membrane with sialic acids as other species do
to evade the host immune system [74].
The pathway for degrading N-acetylglucosamine, a
derivative of glucose that is found in chitin, fungal, and
prokaryote cell walls, was identified. A near-complete
pathway was identified for converting myo-inositol
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, acetyl-CoA, and CO2
(while reducing two NAD+ to NADH). However, no
pathways for butyrate or cellulose metabolism could be
found, nor genes involved in mucin protein degradation,
nor evidence for CO2 fixation (no evidence could be found
for the presence of pyruvate formate-lyase).
V. cambriense pentose phosphate pathway
The V. cambriense genome is missing both glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase,
primary components of the oxidative branch of the pentose
phosphate pathway. However, as is expected for a facultative anaerobe, the non-oxidative pathway is complete. The
presence of a gluconate transporter and ribose transport
system suggests that the pentose phosphate pathway could
use these precursors to produce D-glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate, which in turn could enter the methylerythritol
phosphate pathway and create isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (fundamental units
of isoprenoid biosynthesis), and geranyl diphosphate
(a crucial precursor of menaquinone biosynthesis). Likewise, D-fructose-6-phosphate produced in the pentose
phosphate pathway can be fed into glycolysis or can participate in the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
a necessary precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan. Another
branch from D-erythrose-4-phosphate in the pentose
phosphate pathway could lead to the biosynthesis of
chorismate, an important biochemical intermediate.
Overall, these pathways indicate the sources of several
key metabolic precursors.
V. cambriense fermentation and degradation reactions
The presence of lactate dehydrogenase suggests that pyruvate produced from glycolysis can be fermented to lactate;
however, consistent with isolate metabolic data, no pathways were found to consume lactate [66]. We identified
that the α, β, and γ subunits of pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC: 1.2.7.1) are successively encoded on the V.
cambriense genome (the δ subunit could not be identified).
This enzyme uses an oxidized ferredoxin to ferment
pyruvate and produce H+
, CO2, and acetyl-CoA, which
can subsequently be converted into either acetate or
ethanol. Although the directionality of ethanol interconversion is difficult to infer from protein sequences
alone, it is possible that the reverse of the ethanol
fermentation reaction can occur without additional enzymes, resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA from
ethanol with a gain of two NADH. Additionally, the
pathway for acetoacetate degradation through the
intermediate acetoacetyl-CoA, which has a net yield of
one molecule of acetyl-CoA, also exists. In E. coli, acetoacetate can function as a total source of carbon and
energy through this pathway [75], and this may be the
case for V. cambriense.
V. cambriense tricarboxylic acid cycle
There is strong evidence for a tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle and respiratory capacity in the V. cambriense
genome. Two of the three components of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex are encoded by the genome
(the E1 component could not be identified). If functional,
V. cambriense could convert pyruvate into acetyl-CoA
(which could be used in the TCA cycle) using either this
enzyme or pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The
genome encodes the enzymes for converting acetylCoA into succinate. The TCA cycle can then continue
by converting succinate into fumarate using succinate
dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase (EC: 1.3.99.1). Four
subunits are required for this enzyme, but only three
were identified (the iron-sulfur subunit, flavoprotein
subunit, and cytochrome b556 subunit are co-localized
on the genome). No evidence could be found for the
membrane anchor subunit, which may be due to the presence of a small scaffolding gap in this region of the genome, or may indicate the existence of a divergent form of
this enzyme. The presence of fumarate lyase provides a
way for fumarate to be converted into malate, thus continuing the cycle. The form of malate dehydrogenase
that converts malate into oxaloacetate by reducing NAD+
to NADH and H+ is present, but not the form of the enzyme that uses a quinone. Taken together, V. cambriense
encodes a complete TCA cycle.
Brown et al. Microbiome 2013, 1:30 Page 14 of 19
http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/30

V. cambriense anaerobic respiration
Several components of an anaerobic respiratory chain were
identified. The large and small subunits of the hydrogenase
enzyme (containing iron-sulfur clusters, EC: 1.12.99.6) and
all 14 subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (EC: 1.6.5.3)
were identified, indicating that both hydrogen acquired
from the environment and NADH produced by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and substrate degradation reactions
(ethanol degradation, for example) can be used as electron
donors during anaerobic respiration.
Identification of fumarate reductase (EC: 1.3.99.1),
nitrate reductase (EC: 1.7.99.4), and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) reductase (EC: 1.8.5.3), suggests that fumarate,
nitrate, and DMSO can all be used as terminal electron acceptors. Phylogenetic analysis of the nitrate reductase and
DMSO reductase catalytic subunits supports the functional
roles of these genes (Additional file 2: Figure S4). Furthermore, owing to the presence of a TAT signal sequence in
the V. cambriense nitrate reductase, the active site is located
on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, as is common
in Archaea [76]. Also, the five signature residues suggested as being involved in nitrite and nitrate binding
are conserved [76]. We also identified genes encoding
a nitrate-nitrite transporter, but no other reactions that
produce or consume nitrate or nitrite (the organism
does not fix nitrogen, for example). No reactions for
forming DMSO, or transporters for DMSO could be
identified. The nitrite resulting from nitrate reduction
could be further reduced by several other community
members, several of which have the capacity to further
reduce nitric oxide to nitrous oxide (Escherichia coli - strain
A, Staphylococcus sp., Veillonella dispar, and Veillonella
sp. - species A), although no species is predicted to be able
to reduce nitrous oxide (Table 3).
As is common in gram-positive bacteria, V. cambriense
does not have the genes required for the formation of
ubiquinones. However, a near-complete pathway is present
for the biosynthesis of menaquinones, electron mediators
essential during fumarate, DMSO, and nitrate reduction
[77]. All subunits of the F-type H+
-transporting ATPase
were identified, indicating that V. cambriense is able to
produce ATP from the generated proton gradient.
As noted,V. cambriense is not capable of aerobic respiration. However, both subunits of the cytochrome bd complex were identified. This cytochrome along with cysteine
synthase and superoxide dismutase (also identified) can
protect against oxidative stress and contribute to limited
oxygen tolerance [61,78]. Consistent with cultured strains,
no evidence was found for catalase production [27,66].
Other metabolic pathways found in V. cambriense
The genome contains complete amino acid biosynthesis
and degradation pathways and all 20 aminoacyl tRNA
synthetase genes. Complete pathways were found for
riboflavin (vitamin B2) and vitamin K2 biosynthesis.
The pathway for the synthesis of folate (vitamin B6) is
incomplete; however, some crucial and unique enzymes to
the pathway were identified, suggesting that this organism
may also be able to synthesize this vitamin (approximately
30% of ORFs do not have a predicted function and could
be responsible for this and other pathways). The combination of these functions indicates that V. cambriense
may exist symbiotically with its human host under
certain conditions.
Abundance of Varibaculum in the healthy adult
human microbiota
We searched data from the HMP, surveying the V35 region
of the 16S rRNA gene in order to assess the abundance and
distribution of Varibaculum in the human microbiota
(Additional file 2: Figure S5) [57]. Out of the 5,000 samples
taken from 235 healthy human subjects, only 90 had hits
for Varibaculum (0% oral, 0.31% stool, 1.42% nasal, 3.92%
skin, and 10.56% vaginal samples encompassing 24.68% of
subjects). In only 29 of these (from 25 different individuals)
was the relative abundance of Varibaculum greater than
0.05%, while this genus never represented more than 2.5%
of any sample. On average, the most abundant organism in
communities studied by the HMP represent 14.42% of
the total community (standard deviation of 14.11%), and
in communities with Varibaculum, the most abundant organism represented 20.48% (standard deviation 10.96%).
Varibaculum was most abundant in samples from the antecubital fossa (skin) and the vagina. Only one stool sample
had hits for Varibaculum, where it represented only 0.02%
relative abundance. Although Varibaculum is not uncommon, it is never a dominant community member in the
large, healthy, adult population surveyed by the HMP.
Comparative genomics of V. cambriense
Comparing the genome for V. cambriense with available
genomes for members of the family Actinomycetaceae
revealed few unique genes, most of which are phageassociated or are not annotated. Several of these unique
genes corresponded with folate, butanoate, and benzoate
metabolism (among other pathways), but no complete
pathways could be established from this set. However,
there is considerable metabolic variation within the
Actinomycetaceae (Figure 2). Only members of the genus
Mobiluncus are motile, encoding genes for both flagella and
chemotaxis. Nitrate reductase is common in the family, but
not encoded by Actinomyces coleocanis, Actinomyces
graevenitzii, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, some strains
of Mobiluncus curtisii, nor Mobiluncus mulieris, while
nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase are found
only in the Actinomyces. DMSO reductase is found
only in Mobiluncus curtisii, Actinomyces urogenitalis,
Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and V. cambriense. Taken
Brown et al. Microbiome 2013, 1:30 Page 15 of 19
http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/30

together, the Actinomycetaceae rely on several different terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration.
Although genes were identified for riboflavin biosynthesis
in V. cambriense, these genes are not common in the
Actinomycetaceae. Several species of Actinomyces and
members of the microbial community of the premature
infant in our study (but not the A. urogenitalis genome
reconstructed from the community) encode the genes
for trehalose biosynthesis, suggesting a possible interrelationship between these species and V. cambriense,
which only encodes the genes for trehalose degradation
(Figure 2). In the Actinomycetaceae, pyruvate-ferredoxin
oxidoreductase, mentioned previously for its importance
in converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, is found only in
V. cambriense and members of Mobiluncus. Neuraminidases, which are required for cleaving sialic acids from
glycoproteins, human breast milk glycans, and intestinal
mucins, are distributed throughout the Actinomycetaceae.
However, most members of the family are missing
transporters for sialic acids, although the presence of
the enzymes for their degradation suggests that a currently
uncharacterized transporter exists for these species
(Additional file 5). Members of the Actinomycetaceae
and the microbial community in the gut of this infant
engage in diverse metabolisms. Clustering based on select metabolic characters shows that V. cambriense is
more metabolically similar to other Actinomycetaceae
than to other members identified in the gut of this infant, despite significant metabolic overlap among community members (Figure 2).
Discussion
Genome reconstructions facilitated prediction of the
metabolic roles of individual bacterial members in the
context of their community. Applied to the gut microbiome of a premature male infant, the time series
abundance information also provided by this method
revealed strain-specific dynamics during the third week
of life. Comparison of reconstructed genomes to the
genomes of isolate strains revealed genomic novelty,
even among members of this relatively simple microbial community. However, overall similarities between
most reconstructed and reference genomes validated
the de novo genome binning strategy.
Metabolic analysis revealed a community consisting
of facultative anaerobes and obligate (fermentative) anaerobes. The facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli was
initially dominant in the time series, but was replaced
by obligate anaerobes (Streptococcus anginosus and
Clostridium butyricum) during a switch to a community
dominated by fermentation-based metabolism. This shift
emphasizes the instability of the infant gut in terms of
both membership and metabolism, and could be the result
of several factors previously observed in the human gut.
For example, dominance of species from the family
Enterobacteriaceae (including E. coli) has been associated
with either high oxygen levels or the availability of nitrate
(a natural byproduct of the host immune response) [79].
Thus, this shift could be the result of decreased availability
of either nitrate or oxygen, either of which could be depleted by E. coli during respiration. Decreased inflammation could also decrease available nitrate and decrease the
competitive advantage of E. coli over obligate fermenters
[80]. In terms of the gut environment, succession during
early life is driven by the presence of oxygen [81], and replacement of E. coli with obligate fermenters is suggestive
of a decrease in oxygen; however, we cannot rule out the
hypothesis that this shift in relative abundance is stochastic. Regardless of the mechanism, this represents a dramatic shift in community composition with the potential
to affect host metabolism.
Although the abundance of S. anginosus and E. coli
appeared to equilibrate by the end of the time series, the
drop in abundance of C. butyricum after its initial spike
suggests a potential competition between the two obligate
anaerobes. Interestingly, S. anginosus and C. butyricum
have different clinical presentations. S. anginosus is
commonly observed in association with abscess formation [82], while C. butyricum is usually considered a
beneficial, butyrate-producing commensal [83]. In this
case, the microbe more likely to be beneficial in the gut environment is outcompeted.
To explore the potential role of a species not commonly
observed or previously characterized from the human gut,
we manually curated and metabolically analyzed the genome of Varibaculum cambriense (strain Dora), resulting
in the first genomic sampling of a member of the genus
Varibaculum. Strains of V. cambriense isolated from
human cerebral and skin abscesses, intrauterine contraceptive devices, and the human vagina have been used to show
that it is an anaerobic, catalase-negative, gram-positive,
diphtheroid-shaped bacterium [27,66]. However, genome
analysis revealed additional insight into the metabolic
potential of this organism and informed which substrates V.
cambriense may use for anaerobic respiration. V. cambriense
is metabolically similar to common gut inhabitants, and
is predicted to use various carbon sources, respire anaerobically (using fumarate, nitrate, and DMSO), and produce
lactate during fermentation.
Several community members (including V. cambriense)
are predicted to use myo-inositol as a nutrient source.
This is interesting because myo-inositol plays a role in
eukaryotic cell messaging and is found in breast milk
and infant formula, although it is generally not found
in solutions used for intravenous feeding [84]. Inositol has
been shown to benefit premature infants with respiratory
ailments [85], suggesting that microbial degradation of this
compound would decrease its health benefits. In contrast,
Brown et al. Microbiome 2013, 1:30 Page 16 of 19
http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/30

the potential for V. cambriense to produce essential vitamins suggests a beneficial contribution by this organism to its human host.
Although this infant was fed fortified breast milk
(an abundant source of glycan-bound sialic acids)
during the time period studied, only V. cambriense,
Streptococcus sp., and Streptococcus parasanguinis, all
low-abundance members of the gut community, have
neuraminidases (enzymes that cleave sialic acids) and
enzymes for sialic acid degradation. Although the E. coli
genome does not encode a neuraminidase, it has a sialic acid transporter and degradation machinery. Thus,
low-abundance community members may be making
sialic acids available to E. coli. It has been shown that
some pathogenic species incapable of accessing bound
sialic acids are able to make use of sialic acids cleaved by
commensal organisms to promote their own growth [86].
The ability of V. cambriense to degrade, but not produce,
trehalose suggests a possible dependency on other members of the microbial community able to produce this disaccharide. Furthering community interrelationships, nitrite
produced by V. cambriense during anaerobic respiration
can by further utilized by community members capable
of nitrite and nitric oxide reduction.
Conclusions
This study underlines the higher resolution insight that
can be obtained using genome-centric metagenomic
approaches. Strain-resolved community dynamics revealed two phases in colonization during the third
week of life of a premature infant. The phases were distinguishable based on the dominance of either respiratory or fermentation-based metabolism. Comparison
of V. cambriense with other members of the microbial
community revealed similarities with traditional gut inhabitants, while comparisons with other members of the
family Actinomycetaceae illustrate how the metabolic diversity of this family could mislead species-level functional
analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of
reconstructed genomes enabled strain-specific metabolic
potential to be determined for the microbial community,
and suggested potential community interdependencies.
