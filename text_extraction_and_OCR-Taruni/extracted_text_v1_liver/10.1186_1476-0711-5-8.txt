Abstract
The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that can cause both acute and chronic liver disease in
humans. Approximately 350–400 million people are affected worldwide and up to one million
deaths occur annually from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. When cirrhosis and liver failure
develop, the definitive treatment of choice remains orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the
past, an unacceptable HBV recurrence rate with a high rate of graft loss was noted. The use of
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) has resulted in improved patient and graft survival rates. The
addition of the nucleoside analog Lamivudine (LAM) to HBIG has improved these survival curves
to an even greater degree. Prolonged use of LAM will almost invariably lead to the development of
viral mutations resistant to the drug. There are now several other nucleoside and nucleotide
analogs (Adefovir, Entecavir, Tenofovir, and Truvada) available for the clinician to utilize against
these resistant strains. It should be possible to prevent recurrence in most, if not all, posttransplant patients and also to significantly reduce viral loads with normalization of transaminases
in those who have developed recurrent infection. The antiviral regimen should be robust and
minimize the risk of breakthrough mutations. A prudent approach may be the implication of
combination antiviral therapy. This review summarizes the efficacy of previous regimens utilized to
prevent and treat recurrent HBV following OLT. Particular attention will be paid to the newer
nucleoside and nucleotide analogs and the direction for future strategies to treat HBV in the post
transplant setting.
Introduction
The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that can cause
both acute and chronic liver disease in humans. Approximately 350–400 million people are affected worldwide
and up to one million deaths occur annually from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. [1,2] The use of nucleoside analogs has been shown to prevent liver failure as
well as prolonging transplant free survival in patients with
chronic hepatitis. [3-7] However, if cirrhosis and liver failure develops, the definitive treatment of choice remains
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The current estimates suggest that 5–10% of liver transplants performed
in the United States are for HBV disease. [8] An unacceptable recurrence rate with an extremely high rate of graft
loss was noted initially and HBV infection was actually
considered to be a relative contraindication to OLT. [9-11]
Fortunately, the use of HBIG resulted in markedly
improved patient and graft survival rates. The addition of

the nucleoside analog Lamivudine (LAM) to Hepatitis B
Immunoglobulin (HBIG) has improved these survival
curves to an even greater degree (greater than 80% five
year survival rate) while also enabling the treatment team
to consider discontinuation of the costly HBIG preparation. [12]
In the pre-transplant setting prolonged use of LAM will
almost invariably lead to the development of viral mutations resistant to the drug. Furthermore, prolonged therapy with LAM in the post-transplant setting could also
lead to the development of LAM-resistant mutants.
Indeed, there have now been several reports of these
mutations developing following OLT. [13-22] This raises
the question of how to treat these LAM-resistant patients
in the post-transplant period. Fortunately, there are other
nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (Adefovir, Entecavir,
Tenofovir, and Truvada) available now or in the near
future for the clinician.
It should be possible to prevent recurrence in most, if not
all, post-transplant patients and also to significantly
reduce viral loads with normalization of transaminases in
those who have developed recurrent infection. The antiviral regimen should be robust and minimize the risk of
breakthrough mutations. A prudent approach may be the
implication of combination antiviral therapy.
The purpose of this review is to summarize the efficacy of
previous regimens utilized to treat recurrent HBV following OLT. Particular attention will be paid to the newer
nucleoside and nucleotide analogs and the direction for
future strategies to treat HBV in the post transplant setting.
Prevention of HBV recurrence
Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG)
HBIG first became available for use in 1975. This agent
provides a means of passive immunity for the patient. In
principle, polyvalent anti-HBs antibodies will bind to and
neutralize circulating virions and prevent subsequent graft
infection. Anti-HBs also undergoes endocytosis by hepatocytes and binds to HBsAg within cells already infected,
thereby decreasing HBsAg secretion. The first large study
demonstrating the efficacy of long term HBIG came from
the EUROHEP study group in 1993. Three hundred seventy-two patients transplanted for HBV-related liver failure were observed. The risk of HBV recurrence was 75 ±
6% among the 67 patients given no immunoprophylaxis,
74 ± 5 percent among the 83 treated for two months, and
36 ± 4 percent among the 209 treated for six months or
longer (P < 0.001). Improved patient survival (75 versus
45 percent) at three years was also noted among those
patients receiving passive prophylaxis with HBIG. Multivariate analysis revealed that long-term administration of
HBIG was associated with a relative risk reduction of 3.3
for the development of recurrent HBV. [23] These findings
have now been confirmed in multiple studies and the
median rate of recurrent HBV in patients receiving longterm HBIG is approximately 20% over one to two years.
[24-33]
There are several drawbacks to the use of HBIG. First is its
cost. Most regimens currently in use in the United States
range from $80,000 to $200,000 for the first year. These
costs also include the cumbersome IV infusion sets and
monitoring of the patient during administration. [29] The
supply of HBIG is limited. Significant side effects have
been noted with the infusion including headaches, flushing and chest pain. [24]. Lastly, the development of escape
mutants can be seen reducing the efficacy of HBIG. These
escape mutants are typically due to mutation in the HBsAg
at the "a" determinant loop. [34] The trend has been
toward lower doses given intramuscularly.
In the past, the use of monoclonal antibody to the HBV
surface antigen led to an unacceptable rate of breakthrough infections. [35,36] However, a recent study by
Galun et. al. [37] showed promising results using a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies in a phase I clinical
study. Patients developed a rapid and significant decrease
in HBV-DNA levels. Future studies are warranted, but this
preliminary data suggests that monoclonal antibody preparations could replace the current polyclonal HBIG.
Lamivudine (LAM)
Lamivudine (LAM) was the first nucleoside analog to be
approved for the use of chronic HBV. Its mechanism of
action is the inhibition of the DNA polymerase of the
virus and suppression of HBV replication. [38,39] LAM
has also been shown to be safe in patients with decompensated liver disease; it is well tolerated and achieves a
rapid loss of HBV DNA in the serum. LAM is preferred
over the use of the Interferons which are contraindicated
in patients with advanced cirrhosis. [3-7]
In the pre-transplant setting, the drug has been shown to
be potent. Undetectable HBV DNA can be achieved in
most patients within 2–3 months. [3,6,7,13,40-47]. Furthermore, histologic improvement may be seen in 49–
56% of patients after receiving one year of therapy.
[34,48-51] Yao showed that the use of LAM could also
improve the Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score by more
than or equal to three points in 60% of patients receiving
the drug and even reduce the necessity for OLTx. [7]
The major drawback to the use of LAM is the development
of resistance to the drug caused by mutations in the
reverse transcriptase gene. The most common mutations
occur in Domain C of the HBV polymerase at the tyrosinemethionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) locus. Other

mutations can occur at Domain B in conjunction with the
YMDD mutations. [52] Liaw showed that the cumulative
rates of LAM resistance were 14%, 38%, 49%, 66% and
69%, one, two, three, four, and five years after initial therapy respectively. [53] Other studies have showed similar
rates of resistance with resistance rates of 24% and 70%
after one and four years of therapy respectively. [50,51,54]
In an attempt to lower the cost, and avoid the side effects
and cumbersome administration of HBIG, multiple studies have examined the use of LAM prior to and following
transplant to prevent HBV recurrence. Perillo et. al. conducted the largest multicenter study in North America in
which 77 liver transplant candidates were treated with
LAM (100 mg daily) without the adjunctive use of HBIG.
Treatment was initiated prior to and after transplantation.
Forty-seven eventually underwent liver transplantation.
Re-infection with HBV occurred at a rate of 40% over the
subsequent three years and HBV-DNA polymerase
mutants were detected in 15 (21%) of the transplanted
patients. [6] Other studies with LAM monotherapy have
also been disappointing with high rates of HBV recurrence
ranging from 23–50% of patients. [41,43,55-57] The high
rates of recurrence were due to the expected emergence of
escape mutations in the YMDD locus. For this reason,
LAM prophylactic monotherapy has been abandoned in
favor of combination therapy with HBIG.
Lamivudine and Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin combination 
therapy
In contrast to monotherapy, LAM in combination with
HBIG has been potent in preventing the recurrence of
HBV in the post-transplant setting. Indeed, following the
results of several studies, the standard of care has become
administration of LAM in the pre-transplant setting (ideally, at least four weeks prior to transplantation) followed
by the combination of LAM and HBIG in the post-transplant setting. [58] HBV recurrence rates are usually less
than 10% one to two years following transplantation. Furthermore, HBV DNA levels by PCR are also typically undetectable. [13,40,42,59-66]
These favorable response rates are likely secondary to the
additive effects of LAM with the HBIG. Another added
benefit of combination therapy is that HBIG can be
administered in reduced amounts thus reducing costs and
increasing availability of HBIG. [13,40] Some have argued
that HBIG could even be stopped at some point after
transplantation. This issue represents an impending controversy that requires further investigation before a robust
recommendation can be made, although our center often
discontinues HBIG at some point following OLT depending upon the individual patient, serologic studies and
viral load.
Adefovir (ADV)
It is now well known that a significant number of patients
can develop LAM resistant strains of HBV while receiving
this drug in the pre-transplant setting. Furthermore, an
increasing number of patients may become primarily
infected with a LAM resistant HBV mutant. In this setting,
the use of LAM for prevention of recurrent HBV in the post
transplant setting is of limited value. Adefovir dipivoxil
(ADV) is an orally available prodrug of Adefovir- a nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate that has been
shown to have activity against both wild type and LAMresistant HBV. Improvement in histology, LFT's and viral
DNA levels have been seen with the use of this drug. [67-
69]. The drug is very well tolerated and the only significant side effect is risk of increased nephrotoxicity after 20
or more weeks of use. [70]
Several large studies have shown the utility of ADV in the
pre and post liver transplantation setting. The largest
study by Schiff et. al. showed that among patients with
LAM-resistant HBV and who were pre-OLT, 81% achieved
undetectable serum HBV DNA. Furthermore, serum ALT,
Albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time normalized in
76%, 81%, 50% and 83% of these pre-OLT patients
respectively. Furthermore, the Child-Pugh-Turcotte score
improved in over 90% of cohorts. Unlike the use of LAM,
no resistance to ADV was identified after 48 weeks of therapy in this population. [71] Many patients came off the
transplant list because of reversal of the decompensated
state.
Another study describing the use of prophylactic ADV was
from Lo et. al. They describe 16 patients who had developed YMDD mutations while on the waiting list for OLT.
Eleven patients received ADV for a median of 20 days
(range 8–271 days) before transplantation while 5
patients started the drug at the time of OLT. The median
follow-up period after OLT was 21.1 months (range 4.4–
68.9 months). One patient died of a cause unrelated to
HBV 12.2 months after transplantation. Fifteen patients
(94%) were alive with the original graft. Pre-OLT HBV
DNA levels at the time of breakthrough were available in
15 patients ranging from 2 × 103 – 4.69 × 109 copies/mL
(median 1.42 × 107). Lo's cohort was divided in half: eight
patients received HBIG (in addition to ADV and LAM) for
a median of 24 months whereas the other 8 patients
received prophylaxis with ADV and LAM alone. All 16
patients cleared the HBV DNA and had no evidence of
recurrence; furthermore, all remained HBeAg negative.
The graft survival was 94% at a median follow up of 21
months. Lo concludes that add-on ADV plus LAM should
be the "preferred approach in those patients who have
already developed resistance to lamivudine so as to avoid
the emergence of multiresistant viral strains." [72]

Previous studies reported a low rate of ADV resistanceoccurring in less than 2% of patients after 96 weeks.
[66,68,73,74] However, the emergence of ADV resistant
HBV mutants is now considered to be clinically significant
over time when given as monotherapy; resistance has
been reported in 18% of patients after 4 years of therapy
and 22% after 2 years of therapy. [75-77].
It is expected that the development of ADV mutations will
similarly become a problem in the post-transplant setting.
Villenueve recently reported the first case of a patient who
developed sequential selection of LAM and ADV resistant
strains of HBV in a liver transplantation patient. [20] The
patient was a 52 year old Cambodian who was initially
HBV DNA negative and HBsAg positive. He was given prophylactic HBIG alone in the peritransplant setting without
any nucleoside analogs. Virologic breakthrough with LAM
resistance mutations in L180M and M204V followed 20
months later. ADV was added to LAM and after reduction
in DNA levels, LAM was discontinued and ADV was continued alone. A subsequent reversion to wild type took
place. A second virologic breakthrough occurred after
nearly two years of ADV monotherapy with the selection
of the resistance mutation N236T of the D domain of the
HBV polymerase. [20] Xiong et. al. had recently described
this mutation in 2/124 patients receiving chronic ADV
therapy for two years. [74] LAM was reintroduced with
ADV after which the patient developed undetectable levels
of the virus.
Both the Schiff and Lo study suggest that ADV provides
safe and effective prophylaxis in those patients with LAM
resistant HBV infection.
An area for future investigation is whether the use of ADV
in combination with LAM should be utilized. There are
several potential benefits with combination therapy. The
chance for breakthrough mutations to either LAM or ADV
is significantly less when the agents are used in combination. [72,77,78] Snow et. al. observed a patient population of 467 patients with LAM-resistant HBV. He reported
that resistance to ADV was only seen in those who
stopped LAM. [78] Fung et. al. studied all HBV patients in
a tertiary care center receiving ADV. He found that none of
the patients receiving combination therapy (LAM + ADV)
developed ADV resistance; among those who had
switched to ADV monotherapy after combination therapy, 5 of 18 patients (28%) developed resistance. [77]
Another potential benefit of combination therapy would
be to eliminate the need for HBIG with its economic cost
and potential toxic side effects (see discussion above).
Note that in Lo's study, all eight patients who did not
receive HBIG remained alive with normal chemistries at a
median follow up of 15.1 months (range 4.4– 26). Furthermore, there was no histologic evidence of recurrence.
Six of these eight had spontaneous HBsAg seroconversion.
Although, two of the eight remained HBsAg positive, both
had undetectable DNA levels with normal LFT's. The possibility of a viral breakthrough with resistance to both
LAM and ADV should be low given the relatively low frequency of ADV resistance and lack of cross-resistance to
LAM when given in combination. [72] The duration of
HBIG therapy remains a contentious issue; to suggest its
elimination altogether is controversial and worthy of further investigation.
Treatment of HBV recurrence
Lamivudine
Prior to combination HBIG/LAM, graft infection was frequently seen. As described above, this was due to the high
recurrence rates in patients who received HBIG or LAM as
monotherapy alone or in those who received no prophylaxis at all. De Novo HBV is also seen in the post transplant setting. Fortunately, LAM is very effective in treating
HBV infection of the graft and remains the first line agent.
Perillo performed a large multicenter center of 52 HBVDNA positive patients. After one year of treatment, LAM
resulted in a 68% loss of HBV serum DNA with an 11%
HBeAg seroconversion. [79] Other studies have shown
similar improvements with HBV-DNA negativity ranging
from 75 to 100%, although HBeAg serum conversion is
generally less than 30%. [59,80,81] This low rate of serum
conversion is consistent with prior reports in the nontransplanted population. [67]
Unfortunately, breakthrough is seen just as in the nontransplanted population in up to 50% of patients within
the first one to two years following transplantation
[59,79-81]. It should be expected that with even longer
follow up the development of LAM resistant mutants
should approach 70%. Continuation of LAM for graft
infection that develops while receiving prophylaxis with
LAM ± HBIG is not indicated. Furthermore, the use of
LAM as a primary treatment agent is ineffective for de
novo graft infection with a LAM resistant mutant. In these
scenarios, ADV should be initiated, although Tenofovir or
Truvada may ultimately replace ADV pending future studies.
Adefovir
The beneficial effects of ADV in the chronic HBV population suggested that ADV may be helpful for the development of LAM-resistant mutants in the transplanted
population receiving prophylactic combination therapy
or in the development of de novo LAM-resistant HBV
infection. Schiff et. al. performed a large multicenter study
investigating the utility of Adefovir examined two cohorts
with LAM-resistant HBV infection. The beneficial results
seen in the pre-OLT cohort described above (see Preven-

Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2006, 5:8 http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/8

tion Section) were also found in the post-OLT population.
One hundred ninety-six patients were followed for a
median of 56.1 weeks. After 24 and 48 weeks of therapy
with ADV, a 3.1 and 3.4 drop in log PCR DNA levels was
seen. In addition, 34% achieved undetectable serum HBV
DNA levels. Serum ALT, albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time normalized in 49%, 76%, 75% and 20%
of these patients respectively. A 93% one year survival was
seen. [71] Several studies and case reports have confirmed
the efficacy of ADV in the setting LAM-resistant graft infection whether it be the development of a mutant while on
prophylactic therapy or de novo LAM-resistant HBV graft
infection. (See Table 1.) Multiple studies have shown that
there is a low rate of HBeAg seroconversion when Adefovir is used for patients with chronic Hepatitis B. [67] This
observation is also found in the post transplant infected
patients.
ADV is thus both an effective and safe drug to treat graft
infection and prevent clinical deterioration of patients
affected with the development LAM resistant HBV graft de
novo infection or for LAM-resistant breakthrough
mutants. (See Table 1)
Neff's study [19] described a total of 14 patients who had
the development of LAM resistant mutants. Nine patients
were switched from LAM to ADV. The other 5 patients
were treated with Tenofovir. Of the patients given ADV,
one died during follow-up. Of the 8 alive, all but one had
reductions in HBV DNA.
Toniutto's study [22] describes one patient who developed de novo HBV graft infection. 3 months after treatment of LAM, LAM resistance developed. The patient was
given two months of ADV plus LAM with HBsAg seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA levels. Therapy was
stopped thereafter and the patient remains HBV negative
13 months later.
None of these studies and case reports described any significant nephrotoxicity with the use of ADV. In post-OLT
patients, there are multiple factors, in particular the use of
calcineurin inhibitors, that contribute to renal dysfunction. Some patients did develop a rise in serum creatinine
which was easily treated with reduced frequency dosing of
ADV.
Entecavir and Tenofovir
Although ADV is generally well tolerated, there does exist
a risk of nephrotoxicity with this agent. Furthermore, as
described above, there exists the possibility of N263T and
other ADV resistant mutants. In these cases, it may be
desirable to use either Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate or
Entecavir.
Entecavir is a carboxylic analogue of guanosine and is the
most recently FDA approved drug for the treatment of

chronic Hepatitis B. Like Adefovir, it has been shown to be
a potent antiviral agent for the wild type and LAM-resistant forms of chronic HBV. [84-86] It is expected that Entecavir will be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of
recurrent HBV following liver transplantation. The first
reports of Entecavir's use in this setting are now being
reported. [87]
Tenofovir is currently only approved for use in HIV positive patients but has been to be effective for LAM resistant
mutants and for those patients who have failed prior ADV
and LAM. It is a nucleotide analogue and acts as a reverse
transcriptase inhibitor. [88-90] Several case reports have
now been reported in which Tenofovir produced a well
tolerated, successful antiviral response in patients before
and after OLT.
Taltavull describe a 54 year old male who developed
YMDD mutations while receiving LAM therapy. ADV produced a suboptimal response: DNA levels were still positive after 8 months of therapy. His clinical status
continued to decline with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and worsening of CPT status. Tenofovir was then added
and produced a rapid dramatic decline in DNA levels to
undetectable levels 4 weeks after treatment. He continued
on this treatment up to OLT after which time he received
only HBIG, LAM and ADV. [91] The patient's outcome
remained excellent 21 months following OLT.
In 2004, Neff et. al. [21] reported the successful use of
Tenofovir in patients who developed the Lam resistance
following OLT. From June, 1998 through December,
2003, 25 patients transplanted for HBV were managed on
chronic LAM therapy. Sixteen patients (64%) developed
resistance to LAM between 10–85 months (median 26)
following OLT. Eight of these patients were administered
Tenofovir at a dose of 300 mg/day 1–66 months after the
development of resistance. Therapy was continued for
14–26 (median 19.3) months. All 8 patients experienced
DNA suppression with 7 having undetectable viral loads.
Creatinine clearance was not impaired nor was any other
adverse event reported. Both the Taltavull and Neff study
suggest that Tenofovir is a safe and effective therapy for
those patients who develop LAM-resistant mutants after
OLT. It also stands to reason that the use of Truvada
(Emtricitabine and Tenofovir) will also be useful in this
setting; although, like Tenofovir, it is not yet FDA
approved for this use.
Conclusion
The Hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus that can cause both
acute and chronic liver disease in humans. If cirrhosis and
liver failure develops, the definitive treatment of choice
remains orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the
past, recurrence of HBV was common following OLTleading to unacceptable rates of graft loss and increased
morbidity and mortality.
With the advent of new antiviral therapy, it should be possible to prevent recurrence in most, if not all, post-transplant patients. Ideally, the antiviral regimen should be
robust and prevent breakthrough mutations. In decompensated cirrhotic patients, the use of combination therapy has the advantage of reducing the risk of escape
mutations. A prudent approach in preventing recurrence
may be the implication of combination antiviral therapy
in the post-transplant setting as well. This remains an
unanswered question. As discussed above, most studies
using combination therapy have been small; although
favorable results are seen.
Fortunately, for those who have already developed recurrent disease, newer agents, either alone or in combination, are able to achieve significant reductions in the HBV
DNA level and normalization of transaminases.
A pending controversy is the duration of HBIG therapy.
While the use of HBIG infusions is universally accepted as
advantageous in the perioperative setting, the use of combination oral agents may make it possible to stop this
costly therapy after a short period of time or avoid it
entirely. This remains a contentious issue that requires
further studies before a definitive recommendation can be
made.
