INTRODUCTION
Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB) is the most
serious complication of portal hypertension and represents
the leading cause of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. The
patients who survive the initial episode of GEVB have a risk
of recurrent bleeding approaching 80% at 2 yr (1). Failure
to control bleeding and early rebleeding are the most important prognostic factors influencing the 6-week outcome of
these patients (2). Rebleeding is associated with an increased
risk of exsanguinations, development of liver failure, encephalopathy, and sepsis which contribute to mortality (3). Over
the past two decades, many new treatment modalities have
been introduced to improve the management of variceal bleeding, including endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and
variceal ligation (EVL), and new vasoactive agents such as
terlipressin and somatostatin (4). Among them, EIS has been
replaced almost universally by EVL, because EVL eradicates
varices and provides a lower variceal rebleeding rate with fewer
secondary effects than EIS does (5). However, the rebleeding
rate following endoscopic treatment is still high; at around
25-50% (6). It is therefore important to define how to further reduce the rebleeding rate.
Bacterial infections are frequently associated with upper
gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients (7). Bacterial
infections are more common in cirrhotic patients with acute
GEVB than those admitted to hospital with other forms of
decompensation, such as encephalopathy (8). Infection may
favour variceal bleeding by increasing sinusoidal pressure and
altering hemostasis (9). In fact, endotoxemia secondary to
bacterial infection may be the critical trigger for variceal bleeding as it produces a wide series of effects that may predispose
the cirrhotic patient to bleeding (10). A recent randomized
controlled clinical trial has documented the value of quinolone
use in preventing rebleeding (6). Prophylactic quinolone can
thus further reduce the rebleeding rate in cirrhotic patients
with GEVB. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics can
lead to antibiotic resistance with potentially disastrous consequences. It is necessary to prove the benefit of other antibiotics including third generation cephalosporins in preventChung-Hwan Jun, Chang-Hwan Park,

Antibiotic Prophylaxis Using Third Generation Cephalosporins Can
Reduce the Risk of Early Rebleeding in the First Acute 
Gastroesophageal Variceal Hemorrhage: A Prospective Randomized
Study
Bacterial infection may be a critical trigger for variceal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis
can prevent rebleeding in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding
(GEVB). The aim of the study was to compare prophylactic third generation cephalosporins with on-demand antibiotics for the prevention of gastroesophageal variceal
rebleeding. In a prospective trial, patients with the first acute GEVB were randomly
assigned to receive prophylactic antibiotics (intravenous cefotaxime 2 g q 8 hr for 7
days, prophylactic antibiotics group) or to receive the same antibiotics only when
infection became evident (on-demand group). Sixty-two patients in the prophylactic
group and 58 patients in the on-demand group were included for analysis. Antibiotic
prophylaxis decreased infection (3.2% vs. 15.5%, p=0.026). The actuarial rebleeding rate in the prophylactic group was significantly lower than that in the on-demand
group (33.9% vs. 62.1%, p=0.004). The difference of rebleeding rate was mostly
due to early rebleeding within 6 weeks (4.8% vs. 20.7%, p=0.012). On multivariate
analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis (relative hazard: 0.248, 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.067-0.919, p=0.037) and bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.901, 95% CI: 1.053-
14.448, p=0.042) were two independent determinants of early rebleeding. In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis using third generation cephalosporins can prevent
bacterial infection and early rebleeding in patients with the first acute GEVB.

ing rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with GEVB. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to compare prophylactic third generation cephalosporins with on-demand antibiotics for the
prevention of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients 
From June 2000 to December 2004, all patients with cirrhosis admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding via our
hospital emergency room underwent endoscopy within 12
hr of admission. Male or female patients aged over 18 yr were
eligible for inclusion in the study after fulfilling the following criteria: 1) diagnosis of cirrhosis on the basis of previous
liver biopsy or clinical, biochemical, and radiologic findings
of hepatic failure and portal hypertension; 2) bleeding from
esophageal varices or gastric varices; and 3) no signs of infection at admission. The severity of cirrhosis was classified according to Child-Pugh’s score (11). GEVB was diagnosed when
the emergency endoscopy showed any of the following signs:
1) active bleeding from esophageal varices or gastric varices;
2) stigmata of recent hemorrhage over varices (adherent blood
clots); or 3) when there was no other cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding but fresh blood was found in the stomach.
Possible complications of endoscopic treatment were discussed
with the patients and their relatives, and written informed
consent was obtained before entry into the trial. 
Patients were excluded from the study if they met the following criteria. First, the patient had a past history of GEVB,
or surgical or endoscopic treatment of gastroesophageal varices.
Second, the patient received antibiotics within the last 2 weeks.
Third, the patient had a terminal illness of any major organ
system, or non hepatic malignancy. Forth, the patient had any
other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was based on liver biopsy or two coincidental imaging studies as well as one imaging study associated with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) more than
400 ng/mL (12). The Ethics Committee of Chonnam National University Hospital approved the treatment protocol.
Randomization 
Randomization was performed at the time of the therapeutic endoscopy by an investigator after patients met clinical
and laboratory entry criteria, lacked exclusions, and gave written informed consent for entry into this study. The allocation
of patients to treatment was done by drawing sequentially
numbered envelopes, each containing a previously determined,
randomly selected assignment based on a table of random
numbers. Patients in the prophylactic group received antibiotics treatment after randomization with intravenous cefotaxime 2 gram q 8 hr for 7 days. Patients in the on-demand
group received antibiotics only when infection was suspected or established. Antibiotics were changed according to the
antibiotic sensitivity profile of cultured microorganisms.
Infection assessment
A physical examination, complete blood cell count, chest
radiography, urine analysis and culture, blood culture, and
ascitic fluid neutrophil count with culture (in patients with
ascites) were routinely carried out before randomization. Patients were excluded when the initial bacteriologic examination turned out positive finding. If a new infection was suspected, the same procedures were carried out to assess infection. New infections were suspected when there was fever
(>38℃), hypothermia (<36℃), unexplained hemodynamic
instability, tachypnea, new onset of chest symptoms, dysuria,
deterioration of renal function, bowel habit changes, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, as well as alteration of mental state (6). Respiratory infections were diagnosed by clinical symptoms and signs and positive chest radiography findings. Urinary tract infections were diagnosed by the positive
urine culture of ≥105 colonies/mL and associated clinical
pictures. The diagnosis of bacteremia was based on positive
blood culture and clinical signs or symptoms of infection without other recognized causes. The diagnosis of spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis was based on ≥250 neutrophils/ L in
ascitic fluid (13). Patients without any identified infection
source but with fever >38℃ and leukocytosis >11,000/ L
with neutrophilia were considered as having possible infections and received on demand antibiotics. In analyzing the
incidence of infection and determining the effect of antibiotic
prophylaxis, only infectious episodes occurring during the
first hospitalization were considered. Therefore, the infection
rate was compared by number of events in this period.
Endoscopic treatment procedures 
Before endoscopic treatment, octreotide was used. If active
bleeding was found during endoscopy, endoscopic treatment
was performed immediately. EVL was performed for esophageal varices, and EIS was performed for gastric varices. Two
experienced therapeutic endoscopists performed the diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures. They had 4 yr’
experience of standard endoscopy. They did not participate
in the postprocedure care of the patients, which was conducted
by other physicians. Endoscopy was performed with a standard upper endoscope (Olympus GIF-XQ240, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). After endoscopic treatment,
octreotide was used for 5 days. EVL was performed by using
a varioligator kit with a single-shot device (Top Corp., Tokyo,
Japan) and a flexible overtube or multiband ligators (WilsonCook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC, U.S.A.). Size of esophageal varices was graded according to Conn’s classification (14).
Grade I-visible only during one phase of respiration/perfor-

mance of Valsalva maneuver. Grade II-visible during both
phases of respiration. Grade III-3-6 mm. Grade IV-varices
of >6 mm. EVL was performed biweekly for the first 6 weeks
until the varices were obliterated or reduced to Grade I size
and could not be banded any further. Follow-up endoscopy
was performed every 3 months and, if unremarkable, was
moved to every 6 months. EIS was performed by using intravariceal injection with the 1:1 mixture of 0.5 mL N-butyl2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl blue, Braun-Melsungen, Germany) and 0.5 mL Lipiodol (Guerbet Laboratory, AulnaySous-Bris, France) in each shot. 
Rebleeding was defined as one or more of the ongoing
bleeding signs including fresh hematemesis, hematochezia,
fresh blood aspirated via a nasogastric tube, instability of vital
signs, or a reduction of hemoglobin by more than 2 g/dL
within 24 hr after initial hemostasis. When rebleeding was
suspected, immediate endoscopy was performed. If active
bleeding or a fresh blood clot was found at the varices, and
if fresh blood was found in the stomach without any other
causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, rebleeding was confirmed. Bleeding esophageal varices were ligated and bleeding gastric varices were injected with the previously mentioned tissue glue again. Rebleeding within 6 weeks of enrollment after initial control of active bleeding was defined as
early rebleeding. Treatment failure was defined as a failure
to control active bleeding after two attempts of endoscopic
treatment, rebleeding more than twice, or bleeding-related
death. Rebleeding index for each patient was calculated by
dividing the months of follow-up by the number of rebleeding episodes plus one (6).
Statistical analysis 
Rebleeding rate as a primary outcome was compared between two groups, and secondary outcomes such as rebleeding index, treatment failure, bleeding related death, infection rate, transfusion requirements, and admission duration,
were also compared between two groups. Quantitative data
were summarized as mean±standard deviation. The Student
t test was utilized to compare the mean values of continuous
variables, and the chi-square test with Yate’s correction or
Fisher exact test was utilized for the comparison of discrete
variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test was
used to compare differences of actuarial probability of rebleeding and survival between two groups. Univariate analysis and
stepwise multivariate analysis were performed to assess the
potential risk factors of early rebleeding using the Cox proportion hazards regression. A p value of less than 0.05 was
accepted as statistically significant. The analysis was performed
with statistical software package (SPSS 13.0 version for Windows, SPSS, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). This study hypothesized
a reduction of rebleeding rate from 45% to 20% by using
prophylactic antibiotics (6). According to the sample size calculation, the study would require 54 patients in each group.
The type I error and type II error were set to 0.05 and 0.2,
respectively.
RESULTS
During the study period, 152 patients with the first acute
GEVB were recruited and randomized. Eight patients in the
prophylactic group and 7 patients in the on-demand group
were excluded from analysis due to occult infections. Six patients in the prophylactic group and 11 patients in the ondemand group were excluded due to their refusal to continue in the study. Therefore, 62 patients in the prophylactic
group and 58 patients in the on-demand group were included
for analysis. Data regarding the clinical characteristics of the
patients at entry are outlined in Table 1. There were no significant differences between two groups with respect to age, gender, etiology, association of HCC, Child-Pugh’s score, severity of bleeding, endoscopic characteristics, and period of follow-up (Table 1). 
Infection outcomes and bacteriology
Summary of the infection sources and bacteriology is outlined in Table 2. The incidence of bacterial infection was significantly lower in patient receiving antibiotic prophylaxis
(2/62, 3.2% vs. 9/58, 15.5%, p=0.026). Bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were the most common sources

in patients without antibiotic prophylaxis (0/62, 0% vs. 5/58,
8.6%, p=0.018). There were no significant side effects in antibiotic prophylactic group.
Hemostatic outcomes 
Summary of hemostatic outcome data is outlined in Table 3.
The rebleeding rate in the prophylactic group was significantly
lower than that in the on-demand group (21/62, 33.9% vs.
36/58, 62.1%, p=0.004). The difference of rebleeding was
mostly due to early rebleeding within 6 weeks (3/62, 4.8%
vs. 12/58, 20.7%, p=0.012). The cumulative total rebleeding
rate and early rebleeding rate were also higher in the on-demand group (Fig. 1, 2). However, there was no significant
difference in cumulative late rebleeding rate between the two
groups (Fig. 3). The rebleeding sources were not different
between the two groups (Table 2). The early rebleeding rate
in the infected patients was significantly higher than that in
the noninfected patients (4/11, 36.4% vs. 11/109, 10.1%,
p=0.031). However, there was no difference in total rebleeding rate between the infected and the noninfected (6/11, 54.5
% vs. 52/109, 47.7%, p=0.760). The transfusion requirement
was significantly larger in on-demand group than that in prophylactic group (p=0.002). There were no differences in rebleeding index, treatment failure, and duration of hospital stay

Univariate analysis showed the early rebleeding risk significantly linked to antibiotic prophylaxis and bacterial infection (Table 4). On multivariate analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis (relative hazard: 0.248, 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.067-0.919, p=0.037) and bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.901, 95% CI: 1.053-14.448, p=0.042) were two independent determinants of early rebleeding (Table 5). Univariate analysis showed the late rebleeding risk significantly linked
to alcoholics and presence of HCC (Table 6). On multivariate
analysis, alcoholics (relative hazard: 1.968, 95% CI: 1.133-
3.502, p=0.016) and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (relative hazard: 1.904, 95% CI: 1.035-3.502, p=0.039)
were two independent factors predictive of late rebleeding.

two independent risk factors determining survival.
DISCUSSION
In cirrhotic patients, there is a predisposition to intestinal
bacterial overgrowth, intestinal dysmotility, and increased
intestinal permeability, all leading to an increase in bacterial
translocation. Bacterial translocation is the probable source
of bacterial byproducts such as endotoxin which can cause an
increase in portal pressure, impairment of liver function, and
worsening of hemostasis (10). Endotoxemia secondary to bacterial infection may indeed be the critical trigger for variceal
bleeding (15). Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin have
all been used with these indications (6, 16-21). According
to our knowledge, previous studies have never used single
third generation cephalosporin for antibiotic prophylaxis for
gastrointestinal bleeding. For this reason, third generation
cephalosporin can also be used to prevent bacterial infection
and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with an antibacterial resistance after a long term quinolone prophylaxis.
In our study, third generation cephalosporin was used in
order to prevent bacterial infection and rebleeding not only
because it is safe and efficacious for enteric Gram-negative
bacteria, which are the most common causative organisms in
cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (16-
20), but it also has a benefit of covering Gram positive bacteria. The benefit of third generation cephalosporins for preventing early rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with GEVB by
decreasing bacterial infection is proved in our study. The prophylactic effect may not sustain over six weeks. However, the
period of the greatest risk of early rebleeding is within the
first 48 hr after admission (22). The use of early short term
antibiotics is very effective in preventing early rebleeding in
cirrhotic patients. 
In the present study, univariate analysis showed the early
rebleeding risk significantly linked to antibiotic prophylaxis and bacterial infection. And, antibiotic prophylaxis (relative hazard: 0.248, 95% CI: 0.067-0.919, p=0.037) and bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.901, 95% CI: 1.053-14.448,
p=0.042) were two independent determinants of early rebleeding by the multivariate analysis. The results suggest that bacterial infection produces a wide series of effects that may predispose the cirrhotic patient to bleeding (10). Therefore, the
effective antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered as an essential treatment to prevent early rebleeding. 
In our study, total rebleeding rates were higher than those
of previous prospective randomized study (47% vs. 32%) (6).
There are several possible explanations for these differences
in the rebleeding rates. First, this may be because of a difference in the clinical characteristics of the study population,
including habitual alcohol drinking. In our study, alcoholism
was the most common etiology of liver cirrhosis compared
with other study. Second, the difference in the rebleeding rates
may stem from the type of antibiotics (quinolone vs. cephalosporin). In a recent survey, 26% of spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis episodes were caused by quinolone resistant Gram
negative bacilli over a two year period, related to long term
treatment with quinolone (23). Fortunately, quinolone resistant E coliare still sensitive to third generation cephalosporins
(9). In addition, there is a substantially increased likelihood
of infections from Gram positive bacteria in patients who
received quinolone prophylaxis (24). Finally, there was a difference in total follow-up periods between the studies. The
total follow-up periods in our study (mean, 22 months) were
longer than those in the other study (mean, 9 months) (6).
Patients who survived after an initial episode have a risk of
rebleeding rate approaching 80% in 2 yr (1). The risk of late
rebleeding (more than 6 weeks after the initial episode) is
related to such factors as continued alcohol consumption,
variceal size, renal failure, degree of liver failure, and presence of HCC (2). Alcohol consumption continues to influence prognosis even after cirrhosis has developed. Patients
with clinically compensated cirrhosis who become abstinent
have a 90% chance of surviving for 5 yr. In contrast, if these
patients continue to drink, their chance of survival falls to
about 70% (25). In our study, continued alcohol drinking
and the presence of HCC were the most important determinants of the late rebleeding. All alcoholic patients with variceal
rebleeding continued their habitual alcohol consumption.
Accordingly, there was a trend of more episodes of rebleeding in cirrhotic patients after longer follow-up period without correction of this risk factor. In order to lower the risk of
late rebleeding, abstinence of alcohol and effective treatment

Although the effect of short-term prophylactic antibiotics
in patients with GEVB is proved by the reduction of bacterial infection and early rebleeding rate, these beneficial effects
are not reflected in terms of mortality and survival in this
study. The lack of influence of antibiotic prophylaxis on mortality is likely because of infection is not an independent predictive factor for survival (6). The small impact of rebleeding
on survival is possibly due to the fact that most rebleeding
episodes can be further controlled by repeated endoscopic
treatments (6). Furthermore, on multivariate analysis, presence of HCC (relative hazard: 4.134, 95% CI: 2.261-7.560,
p<0.001) and Child-Pugh’s score (relative hazard: 1.372, 95%
CI: 1.173-1.603, p<0.001) were the only two independent
risk factors determining survival in the present study. Actually, most patients died of hepatic failure or multiorgan failure associated with decreased residual liver function and HCC.
However, a recent study reported that in-hospital mortality
of patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding has greatly
decreased over the past two decades, in concurrence with an
early and combined use of pharmacological and endoscopic
therapies and short-term antibiotic prophylaxis (26). The use
of prophylactic antibiotics decreased the rate of bacterial infections in randomized controlled trials, and a meta-analysis
showed that it was associated with improved survival (27).
It warrants larger studies to confirm this benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis on mortality.
In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis with third generation
cephalosporins can prevent bacterial infection and early rebleeding in patients with the first acute GEVB. Although the
results are hopeful, larger studies should be performed to confirm this benefit of antibiotics on mortality.
