Abstract
This review summarizes the central role of hepcidin in the iron homeostasis mechanism, 
the molecular mechanism that can alter hepcidin expression, the relationship between 
hepcidin and erythropoiesis, and the pathogenetic role of hepcidin in different types of 
anemia. In addition, the usefulness of hepcidin dosage is highlighted, including the problems associated with analytical methods currently used as well as the measures of its molecular isoforms. Considering the central role of hepcidin in iron arrangement, it is reasonable to ponder its therapeutic use mainly in cases of iron overload. Further clinical trials 
are required before implementation.

INTRODUCTION
Hepcidin (hepatic bactericidal protein) was initially identified as a urinary antimicrobial peptide rich in cysteine. 
Further studies showed that hepcidin is overexpressed in 
mice with iron overload and that it plays a significant role 
in iron homeostasis in knockout animals with iron storage 
disease. The complete abrogation of hepcidin entails excessive intestinal absorption of iron and increased iron release 
by macrophages, a condition that leads to iron overload 
[1-3]. Hepcidin performs its different functions via a single 
biochemical mechanism: hepcidin-ferroportin interaction 
[4]. Intestinal epithelial cells and reticuloendothelial macrophages use the same transporter, ferroportin, to transport 
iron in the plasma. Moreover, macrophages and enterocytes 
exhibit strong upregulated ferroportin expression in the erythropoietic response in an iron-restricted state.
HEPCIDIN REGULATION
Iron regulates hepcidin homeostasis. Increases in iron levels in the plasma and iron storage stimulate the production 
of hepcidin, which blocks iron absorption from the diet 
and its further storage [5]. Hepcidin production is suppressed 
in the case of iron deficiency; the feedback loop between 
iron and hepcidin should ensure the appropriate physiological concentration of iron in the plasma. Hepcidin production is also regulated by the erythropoietic process, whose 
core activity is characterized by high iron consumption. In 
this case, hepcidin suppression causes the stored iron to 
be released by hepatocytes and macrophages while the intestinal absorption of iron increases. This condition involves 
iron supplementation from hemoglobin synthesis activity 
[6]. Hepcidin is elevated during inflammation and/or 
infection. This can cause iron dysregulation with hypoferremia and anemia related to inflammatory disease [7]. 
Hypoferremia can also represent a strategic host defense 
to limit iron availability to microorganisms.
MOLECULAR MECHANISM 
OF HEPCIDIN REGULATION
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a group of 
growth factors that activate the transduction signal by interacting with specific receptors. They use intracellular and

extracellular iron detection mechanisms to alter hepcidin 
expression. BMPs increase hepcidin both in vivo and in 
vitro. BMP6 is the primary regulator of endogenous hepcidin. 
Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a BMP co-receptor specialized for 
iron regulation [8]. The hepcidin adjustment process in the 
iron response occurs in the liver on the membranes of 
hepatocytes. Once BMP6 binds the co-receptor HJV, the 
SMAD transcriptional system (SMAD1/5/8) is activated 
[9-11]. The activated SMAD complexes bind directly to 
BMP-responsive elements on the hepcidin promoter, thus 
inducing hepcidin transcription [12].
The TFR2 and HFE genes, which are altered in adults 
with hereditary hemochromatosis, appear to adjust to the 
detection of iron-transferrin concentration. TFR2, a TfR1 
homolog, is mainly expressed in the liver. HFE is similar 
to major histocompatibility complex type I (MHC I) 
molecules. Regarding the iron-transferrin concentration 
complex, HFE appears to function as a shuttle between TfR1 
and TFR2.
HEPCIDIN AND ERYTHROPOIESIS
Increased erythropoietic activity significantly reduces 
hepcidin levels. A single administration of erythropoietin 
(EPO) over a period of 24 hours significantly reduces hepcidin levels in humans [13]. In cases of ineffective erythropoiesis, 2 proteins are produced by erythroblasts, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF I5) and twisted gastrulation I 
(TWSGI), which appear to be responsible for mediating hepcidin suppression [14, 15]. EPO indirectly influences iron 
homeostasis. EPO production as a normal response to hypoxic 
stimulation is responsible for normal erythron expansion 
without excessive erythropoiesis. GDF15 and TWSG1 are 
released as a result, ultimately suppressing hepcidin synthesis 
as mentioned before. EPO activation is the main event that 
occurs in acute hypoxia; this causes the expansion of erythropoiesis, which requires adequate iron for the hemoglobinization of red cells. The production and hemoglobinization 
of the erythroid lineage can still occur, if hepcidin is downregulated [16, 17].
HEPCIDIN AND INFLAMMATION
Inflammation and infection increase hepcidin synthesis. 
Patients with sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, myeloma, 
burns, and C reactive protein (CRP) levels ＞10 mg/dL exhibit 
significantly elevated hepcidin levels [3, 5, 7, 18, 19]. 
Macrophages are stimulated during the inflammatory process; the stimulation depends on the severity of inflammation. 
Activated macrophages release a network of cytokines. 
Among them is interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the primary 
inducers of hepcidin expression; an increase in hepcidin 
levels finally results in hypoferremia (Fig. 1). Hepcidin inhibits iron release from macrophages as well as intestinal 
iron absorption. In inflammatory states, hepcidin production 
is no longer regulated by iron burden (i.e., if the iron level 
is low, hepcidin synthesis should be downregulated) but 
is rather increased through IL-6 stimulation. Serum iron 
was demonstrated to affect hepcidin synthesis in healthy 
volunteers, in whom the early presence of hepcidin in the 
urine was measured after an oral iron administration dose 
that did not affect iron storage. Serum iron is an induction

signal for hepcidin production and affects serum transferrin 
saturation percentage. In the case of inflammation, hepcidin 
can also be produced by myeloid cells via the activation 
of TRL4, a receptor located on the membranes of neutrophils 
and macrophages [20].
HEPCIDIN AND ANEMIA
Understanding the physiological processes of hepcidin has 
made it possible to redefine the pathogenetic mechanisms 
of anemia.
1. Iron deficiency anemia
In pure iron deficiency anemia (IDA), serum and urinary 
hepcidin concentrations are significantly decreased and are 
even undetectable by some methods currently in use. Even 
in the absence of anemia, hepcidin appears to be a sensitive 
indicator of iron deficiency. Moreover, compared to hematocrit or hemoglobin, a decrease in hepcidin is an early 
marker of iron deficiency together with transferrin saturation 
and decreased ferritin. Since hepcidin in the urine may also 
be measured, samples can be collected easily from babies 
and children.
2. Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia 
Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a genetically transmitted hypochromic microcytic anemia. It is characterized by increased hepcidin production due to a gene 
mutation in the suppressor matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6). Extracellular BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 bind to the co-membrane 
receptor m-HJV as well as BMP receptor (BMPR). This condition triggers the phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, and 
SMAD8 as well as the formation of heteromeric complexes 
with SMAD4 as the common mediator. After nuclear translocation, heteromeric SMAD complexes stimulate the transcription of the Hamp gene, which is responsible for hepcidin 
production. Hepcidin transcription is negatively regulated 
by soluble HJV (s-HJV), which acts as an antagonist of the 
BMP pathway, competing with m-HJV for BMP ligands. 
When matriptase-2 is mutated, hepcidin increases, resulting 
in the chronic inhibition of iron absorption and consequent 
anemia [21-23].
3. Anemia with iron overload
In β-thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, 
anemia is characterized by iron overload. Patients who do 
not receive transfusions have greatly reduced serum and 
urinary hepcidin levels. Increased erythropoietic activity and 
the lack of hepcidin adjustment due to the iron overload 
suppress the signal for the production of hepcidin itself. 
In ineffective erythropoiesis syndromes, the suppression of 
hepcidin production is regulated by GDF15 and TWSG I 
[1, 14, 15]. Hepcidin levels are much higher in chronically 
transfused patients than that in non-transfused patients due 
to iron overload and ineffective erythropoiesis [24-26]. In 
non-transfused thalassemic patients, iron is stored in hepatocytes rather than macrophages, similar to that in transfused thalassemic patients. The consequence of this different 
iron cellular distribution is that serum ferritin is much lower 
in non-transfused patients and does not adequately reflect 
liver iron storage.
4. Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation
Patients with infections, chronic inflammatory disorders, 
and cancers have “anemia of chronic disease/inflammation” 
(ACD) [27]. Hepcidin is elevated in the following inflammatory conditions: rheumatic diseases [3], inflammatory 
bowel disease [18], chronic infections [3], multiple myeloma 
[19], and critical disorders.
There is a rare form of iron-refractory hyposideremic anemia generally present in hepatic adenoma. The early removal

of the adenoma resolves the hypoferremia and the consequent anemia, probably because the tumor is the cause 
of autonomous hepcidin production.
Obesity can also be considered a chronic inflammatory 
state that can cause hyposideremia [28]. In both anemia 
and hyposideremia, the elevated hepcidin level helps differentiate ACD from IDA. A condition of “mixed anemia” can 
arise in chronic inflammatory diseases involving bleeding 
and/or malnutrition. Under these conditions, the hyposideremia could counteract the hepcidin increase mediated by 
inflammation. A true iron deficiency from non-intestinal 
absorption by hepcidin may develop when inflammation 
is present for years. 
5. Anemia in chronic kidney disease
In patients with anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
the anemia is mainly due to the lack of EPO. Kidney function 
(i.e., excretion) plays an important role in hepcidin clearance. 
Kidney dysfunction results in decreased hepcidin clearance 
and consequent hepcidin storage with hyposideremic anemia 
development [29]. As CKD progresses, hepcidin level increases regardless of the inflammatory state. Hepcidin production may be considered to mirror genetic hemochromatosis and chronic diseases (Fig. 2) [30]. Hemochromatosis 
is characterized by low hepcidin production, which increases 
intestinal absorption of iron and iron release by macrophages. 
This inevitably leads to progressive iron storage in tissues. 
In chronic diseases, high hepcidin production inhibits iron 
release from macrophages and intestinal absorption of iron. 
This consequently induces an anemic condition. The interaction between hepcidin and ferroportin determines the plasma iron transport. Hepcidin concentration is regulated by 
iron, erythropoietic activity, and inflammation [31].
HEPCIDIN MEASUREMENT 
AND RELATED PROBLEMS
Specific methods were recently developed to measure hepcidin and evaluate its diagnostic potential. The competitive 
ELISA test uses biotinylated or radioiodinated hepcidin as 
a tracer [5, 32]. However, mass spectrometry is used for 
the hepcidin assay; this involves standards labeled with hepcidin isotopically or standards that bind the hepcidin-truncated molecule [33, 34]. The use of different methods for 
the determination of hepcidin levels mainly depends on the 
employment of different hepcidin standards as well as the 
varying abilities of different methods to detect the hepcidin-20 and hepcidin-22 isoforms in addition to the hepcidin-25 bioactive isoform. Despite the varying abilities of 
the methods mentioned above, there is no difference between 
the samples and analytical methods used. This indicates that 
all methods are appropriate for detecting hepcidin isoforms 
in samples. The results of the first international round-robin 
research on the quantification of plasma and urinary hepcidin 
assays led to the conclusion that the differences in the levels 
of hepcidin isoforms between methods could be due to the 
use of different calibrators with assigned levels obtained 
by different techniques, hepcidin aggregation of either the 
standard solution or sample, binding of hepcidin to α2-macroglobulin or albumin, or existence of 3 hepcidin isoforms 
(hepcidin-25, hepcidin-22, and hepcidin-20) [35].
Since approximately 90% of circulating hepcidin is linked 
to α2-macroglobulin, it is important to consider whether 
it is necessary to measure total or unbound hepcidin and 
which current valuation methods can be used. The difference 
between immunochemical (IC) methods and mass spectrometry is another important issue. IC methods cannot selectively 
distinguish hepcidin-22 and hepcidin-25 from hepcidin-20. 
However, the reasons for including hepcidin-20 and hepcidin-22 in the total hepcidin level for determining different 
iron-related diseases remain unclear. The coefficient of variation among samples is lower for the plasma hepcidin assay 
than that for urinary hepcidin. This suggests that the difference between measured levels in the urine and plasma is 
not due to the method used, but due to biological mechanisms 
such as excretion. Hepcidin levels measured using different 
methods vary considerably, but the analytical variance is 
low and similar for other methods in general.
In order to harmonize the various methods used to measure 
hepcidin, it is recommended to introduce internal standards 
for all basic mass spectrometry methods used for clinical 
trials, reach assigned consensus levels, adjust the levels of 
calibrators used in each procedure, produce a calibrator that 
mimics a patient’s serum, periodically analyze shared samples 
and/or interchangeable calibrators, and have a value assigned 
for quality control.
In addition to measuring hepcidin, it is possible to measure 
prohepcidin. However, the measurement of the latter does 
not appear to be biologically relevant with respect to

hepcidin.
Another problem is the fluctuation of diurnal hepcidin 
values. Hepcidin levels are lower in the morning and increase 
in the afternoon. In addition, assay sensitivity is related to 
the amount of iron introduced by the diet [5, 36]. Various 
types of anemia exhibit different iron-related parameters 
including hepcidin, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor (Table 1).
POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC 
APPLICATION OF HEPCIDIN AGONISTS
Having established the central role of hepcidin in iron 
homeostasis, it is possible to consider its use as a novel treatment for anemia. Under particular conditions of chronic 
inflammation, despite low plasma iron levels, iron treatment 
can be harmful because it can trigger the growth of pathogens 
and/or contribute to neoplastic transformation because of 
its ability to unbalance immune functions, particularly the 
immune-mediated activities of T-cells [37, 38].
Although hepcidin is not used for therapeutic purposes 
at present, there are some ongoing studies on selected 
patients. Hepcidin agonists could be used to prevent or improve the accumulation of iron in both transfused and 
non-transfused β-thalassemic patients and even in anemia 
with iron storage. Hepcidin antagonists could be used in 
patients with diseases that cause hepcidin excess and occur 
with a framework of IDA or systemic IDA.
Other drugs targeting the regulation of the hepcidin system, such as dorsomorphin, a small molecule that inhibits 
the BMP signal, have been tested. Even soluble HJV acts 
as a BMP signal antagonist, decreasing the basal concentration of hepcidin in mice while increasing the liver iron 
concentration [39]. The use of anticytokines such as anti-IL-6 
has been shown to suppress hepcidin production activity 
and improve anemia in some cases [40, 41]. Hydroxyproline 
inhibitors may be effective for inducing hepcidin inhibition; 
such inhibition could be caused not only by erythropoiesis 
stimulation but also by the ability of hydroxyproline inhibitors to interfere with the transcriptional complex, hypoxia-inducible factor [42].
CONCLUSIONS
Iron-related diseases are common and clinically important. 
Recent research on both hepcidin and the key role of the 
hepcidin-ferroportin axis has clarified the pathogenesis of 
IDA, ACD, and anemia with iron overload. This knowledge 
will allow the development of new tests and possibly new 
treatments as well.
