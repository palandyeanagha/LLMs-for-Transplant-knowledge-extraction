Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and serum 
cystatin C (Cys C) are biomarkers of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the efcacy of combining these 
indices to diagnose decompensated cirrhosis is unknown. This study involved 150 patients divided 
into AKI and non-AKI, and healthy individuals. Urinary KIM-1 and NGAL, serum Cys and creatine, 
and glomerular fltration rate (GFR) were compared based on Child-Pugh liver function class. Urinary 
KIM-1 and NGAL concentrations and serum Cys C levels were signifcantly higher in patients with AKI 
secondary to decompensated cirrhosis than in those with AKI not secondary to decompensated cirrhosis 
(p<0.01). These were signifcantly associated with higher kidney injury index stages (p<0.01) and 
negatively correlated with GFR in secondary AKI patients. Urinary KIM-1 and NGAL and serum Cys C 
increased signifcantly and GFR decreased as Child-Pugh class of decompensated cirrhosis signifcantly 
increased (p<0.05). SCr levels were signifcantly increased in Child-Pugh class C patients (p<0.05). 
Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and the combined detection factor, as screening indices, 
could aid in the early diagnosis of AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease commonly identifed in the clinic. During the early stages, it can occur with 
no clinical presentation, but patient mortality increases signifcantly as soon as it progresses to a decompensated 
stage1
. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most severe complications of end-stage liver disease. Relevant 
studies2
 have shown that the incidence of AKI is 19% among patients hospitalized due to decompensated cirrhosis, and that it is an important sign of poor prognosis and an independent predictive parameter of death. AKI 
primarily presents as a sharp decrease in glomerular fltration rate (GFR), rapid increases in serum creatinine 
(SCr) and blood urea nitrogen, and water and sodium retention. AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis ofen 
indicates poor prognosis, and the 30-d mortality rate is 10-fold greater than that in patients without complicating 
AKI3
. Every 12-h delay in AKI diagnosis increases the in-hospital mortality rate by 2.7-fold2.
Currently, the mechanisms of AKI secondary to diferent degrees of liver injury are not clear. Overall, it is 
speculated that they are related to liver injury, which leads to redistribution of renal blood fow, further exacerbation of renal circulation disruption, mitochondrial damage in glomerular and tubular endothelial cells, and 
other factors4
. Tese types of kidney injury are ofen functional during the early stages and can be reversed with 
medication if discovered and treated early; however, they can progress to hepatorenal syndrome and even to 
life-threatening acute or chronic kidney failure. Traditional monitoring of kidney function indices, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen is extremely limited for the early diagnosis of kidney injury, and early monitoring 
and diagnosis of patients with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis is difcult. Early monitoring of patients

with this condition has always been an active research topic in this feld, and thus the search for specifc, sensitive 
early diagnostic markers is essential for its treatment and for reducing patient mortality and improving prognosis.
Investigations in recent years have revealed many new biomarkers for the diagnosis of AKI5
. Tese primarily 
include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), cystatin C (Cys C), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
(NGAL), among others. KIM-1 is a transmembrane protein that is not expressed in normal kidneys, but its levels 
increase in the urine upon kidney injury. It can refect the degree of kidney injury, and has been used in recent 
years as a sensitive marker for the early diagnosis of glomerular injury6,7
. Cys C is eliminated from the body 
only via the kidneys, and kidney microlesions at early stages can lead to changes in serum Cys C levels. Studies 
have shown that serum Cys C concentrations increase upon mild kidney injury and gradually become further 
elevated as the disease progresses8,9
. NGAL is a newly identifed member of the lipocalin family that is signifcantly expressed in injured epithelial cells. It can lead to rapid increases in NGAL secretion from glomeruli, thus 
increasing NGAL concentrations in the urine. In addition, its concentration ofen increases within 2 h of kidney 
injury10,11.
Using patients with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis as the subjects, this study investigated the 
value of combined detection of urinary KIM-1, NGAL, and serum Cys C for the early diagnosis of AKI secondary 
to decompensated cirrhosis. We also evaluated the diagnostic efcacy of combined detection using these three 
indices, in addition to their relationship with disease progression and prognosis.
Results
Baseline patient characteristics. Data were collected from 150 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. 
Te AKI group comprised 68 cases, of which 42 were males and 26 were females, and the age range was 41–79 
years with an average age of 59.72±10.16 years. Te non-AKI group included 82 cases, of which 49 were males 
and 33 were females and the age range was 33–75 years with an average age of 61.47±14.35 years. Te healthy 
control group included 70 cases, of which 45 were males and 25 were females; the age range was 39–72 years with 
an average age of 56.87±11.42 years. Liver and kidney function tests and liver ultrasound results were all within 
normal ranges in the healthy control group. Te sex ratio, average age, and other baseline characteristics were in 
general agreement (all p>0.05) and were comparable.
Comparison of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR among the three 
groups. Urinary KIM-1 levels in the AKI group (7.1±1.5ng/L) were signifcantly higher than in those in the 
non-AKI group (3.5±0.8ng/L) and the control group (3.8±0.9ng/L). Urinary NGAL levels in the AKI group 
(150.1±26.2 µg/L) were also signifcantly higher than those in the non-AKI group (36.2±7.4 µg/L) and the control group (33.0±9.7 µg/L). Similarly, serum Cys C levels in the AKI group (2.4±1.0 mg/L) were signifcantly 
higher than those in the non-AKI group (0.8±0.1mg/L) and the control group (0.7±0.1mg/L). GFR was significantly lower in the AKI group (47.2±18.4ml/min) than that in the non-AKI (111.6±15.6mL/min) and control 
(114.6±10.5mL/min) groups. All diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.01; Fig. 1).
Comparison of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR among patients with 
diferent stages of AKI. Te patients in the AKI group were divided into three groups according to the 
2012 KDIGO staging criteria12. Fifeen patients were classifed as Stage 1 AKI, 20 as Stage 2 AKI, and 33 as Stage 
3 AKI. Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR were compared among the groups, and the

were signifcantly higher in the acute kidney injury (AKI) group than in the non-AKI and healthy control 
groups. GFR was signifcantly lower in the AKI group than in the non-AKI and healthy control groups. All

results showed that as AKI clinical stage increased in severity, there were signifcant diferences in kidney function indices at diferent stages. Urinary KIM-1 levels in Stage 3 AKI patients (8.3±0.8 ng/L) were signifcantly 
higher than those in Stage 2 AKI patients (6.3±0.6ng/L), and urinary KIM-1 levels in Stage 2 AKI patients were 
signifcantly higher than those in Stage 1 AKI patients (5.5±1.1 ng/L); all diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.01). Urinary NGAL levels in Stage 3 AKI patients (163.8±21.1 μg/L) were signifcantly higher than 
those in Stage 2 AKI patients (146.1±22.9 μg/L), and urinary NGAL levels in Stage 2 AKI patients were significantly higher than those in Stage 1 AKI patients (124.7±18.8 μg/L); all diferences were statistically signifcant 
(p<0.01). Serum Cys C levels in Stage 3 AKI patients (3.2±0.7 mg/L) were signifcantly higher than those in 
Stage 2 AKI patients (1.9±0.3mg/L), and serum Cys levels in Stage 2 AKI patients were signifcantly higher than 
those in Stage 1 AKI patients (1.4±0.4mg/L); all diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.01). Serum SCr 
levels in Stage 3 AKI patients (368.4±34.3 μmol/L) were signifcantly higher than those in Stage 2 AKI patients 
(259.4±38.0 μmol/L), and serum SCr levels in Stage 2 AKI patients were signifcantly higher than those in Stage 
1 AKI patients (156.6±29.3 μmol/L); all diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.01). GFR in Stage 3 AKI 
patients (26.1±8.1mL/min) was signifcantly lower than in that Stage 2 AKI patients (55.4±16.3mL/min), and 
GFR in Stage 2 AKI patients was signifcantly lower than that in Stage 1 AKI patients (67.1±17.4 mL/min); all 
diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.01; Fig. 2).
Analysis of correlation between urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C and GFR among 
the three groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used for the correlation analysis of bivariate normally 
distributed data. Analysis of the correlation between urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C and 
GFR among the three groups was also performed. Results showed that in the AKI group, urinary KIM-1 levels 
(r=−0.713, p<0.01), urinary NGAL levels (r=−0.744, p<0.01), and serum Cys C levels (r=−0.860, p<0.01) 
were negatively correlated with GFR (Fig. 3). In the non-AKI group, urinary KIM-1 levels (r=0.007, p>0.05),

KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR among patients in diferent stages were statistically 
signifcant (p<0.01). As AKI stage increased, urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and SCr increased 
signifcantly and GFR decreased signifcantly.

urinary NGAL levels (r=−0.018, p>0.05), and serum Cys C levels (r=−0.135, p>0.05) were not correlated 
with GFR (Fig. 4).In the healthy control group, urinary KIM-1 levels (r=0.019, p>0.05), urinary NGAL levels 
(r=0.056, p>0.05), and serum Cys C levels (r=−0.002, p>0.05) were not correlated with GFR (Fig. 5).
Comparison of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR in living and deceased 
patients in the AKI group. In the AKI group, 15 of 68 patients died, resulting in a mortality rate of 22.1%. 
Results showed that urinary KIM-1 levels, urinary NGAL levels, serum Cys C levels, and SCr levels among the 
deceased patients (8.2±0.9ng/L, 166.7±23.7μg/L, 3.4±0.9mg/L, and 351.2±76.1 μmol/L, respectively) were 
signifcantly higher than those among the living patients (6.8±1.5 ng/L, 145.2±24.8 μg/L, 2.2±0.8 mg/L, and 
272.2±8.9 μmol/L, respectively), whereas GFR levels among the deceased patients (30.8±18.7 mL/min) were 
signifcantly lower than those among the living patients (47.4±21.7 mL/min). All diferences were statistically 
signifcant (p<0.05; Fig. 6).
Comparison of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, SCr, and GFR based on Child-Pugh 
classes of decompensated cirrhosis. Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and SCr levels among 
Child-Pugh Class C patients (9.7±1.9ng/L, 140.5±52.7 µg/L, 3.3±1.2mg/L, and 239.1±66.9 µmol/L, respectively) were signifcantly higher than those in Child-Pugh Class B (4.9±1.2ng/L, 62.5±28.2µg/L, 1.7±0.4mg/L, 
and 81.1±21.2 µmol/L, respectively) and Class A (3.7±0.9ng/L, 39.5±12.4µg/L, 0.8±0.2mg/L, and 69.3±9.9 
µmol/L, respectively) patients, as well as those in the healthy control group (3.1± 0.9 ng/L, 33.0 ±9.7 ng/L, 
0.7±0.1mg/L, and 68.5±6.4 µmol/L, respectively). GFR among Child-Pugh Class C patients (54.2±18.3mL/
min) was signifcantly lower than that in Child-Pugh Class B (88.5±21.1mL/min) and Class A (105.4±15.1mL/
min) patients, as well as that in the healthy control group (122.2±7.4mL/min). All diferences were statistically 
signifcant (p<0.05). Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C levels among Child-Pugh Class B patients 
were all signifcantly higher than those in Class A patients and the healthy control group. GFR among Child-Pugh 
Class B patients was signifcantly lower than that in Class A patients and the healthy control group. All diferences 
were statistically signifcant (p<0.05). However, serum SCr levels among Child-Pugh Class B patients were not 
signifcantly diferent from those of Class A patients or those of the healthy control group (p>0.05). Tis shows 
that as Child-Pugh class increases, urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels increase signifcantly. 
Among Child-Pugh Class B patients, the levels of these three indices were signifcantly increased compared to 
those in the healthy control group, at which point the SCr response rate was not sensitive, and SCr levels were 
signifcantly increased only in Child-Pugh Class C patients, at which point GFR had already decreased by greater 
than 50% (Fig. 7).

the diagnosis of AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. An ROC curve was then plotted13 using

KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and SCr were all signifcantly elevated in deceased patients compared to

diferences were statistically signifcant (p<0.05). However, compared to that in the healthy control group, 
serum creatinine (SCr) levels in the Child-Pugh Class B patients were not signifcantly increased (p>0.05), 
whereas SCr levels in Child-Pugh Class C patients were signifcantly increased (p<0.05).

of serum Cys C was 0.816 (95% CI: 0.767–0.885, p<0.001), and when serum Cys C concentration was 0.93mg/L,

0.919 (95% CI: 0.874–0.965, p<0.001), and the sensitivity and specifcity were 87.1% and 95.8%, respectively. 
Tis shows that urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and the combined detection factor have predictive 
value for AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. Te combined detection factor had the highest area under 
the ROC curve, and the sensitivity and specifcity were signifcantly higher than the Youden index. Terefore, the 
predictive value of the combined detection factor was superior to that of any of the indices alone (Fig. 8).
Discussion
Acute kidney injury primarily presents as a sharp decrease in GFR, rapid increases in SCr and blood urea nitrogen, and water and sodium retention. It is one of the most common complications of severe liver disease, and 
particularly end-stage liver disease14. Currently, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine volume, and other 
indices are ofen used clinically to evaluate reductions in kidney function. Tese indices are not sensitive and are 
easily afected by non-renal factors. Te lack of an efective index for evaluating disease status and prognosis leads 
to inaccurate clinical evaluation, suboptimal efcacy, and poor prognosis. Moreover, this is an important factor 
contributing to the high mortality rate of AKI15,16. Tus, the search for specifc, sensitive early diagnostic markers 
is essential for treatment, reducing patient mortality, and improving prognosis.
KIM-1 is a transmembrane protein with obvious advantages as a new marker for the early diagnosis of 
AKI17. In normal kidney tissue, it is virtually not expressed6,7
, but it is expressed at moderate to high levels in 
the endothelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules during the early stages of renal ischemic or nephrotoxic 
injury. It is also correlated with the severity of kidney injury. Moreover, it has strong specifcity, especially for 
ischemic or nephrotoxic AKI, and is rarely expressed in other organs. Furthermore, it has high stability. Further, 
KIM-1 has protein hydrolytic regions that make it easy to detect in the urine. Studies have shown that in cirrhosis 
patients, blood KIM-1 levels increase signifcantly as eGFR levels decrease18. Te present study also found that 
urinary KIM-1 concentrations are signifcantly higher in the group with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis compared to that in the non-AKI and healthy control groups, and that KIM-1 concentrations gradually 
increase with disease progression, with concentrations highest with Stage 3 AKI. Tis shows that urinary KIM-1 
can serve as an efective marker for monitoring AKI secondary to cirrhosis, and can be an early marker of disease 
progression.
NGAL is a newly identifed member of the lipocalin family19. Researchers have found that intraperitoneal 
injection of high doses of cisplatin, which can result in glomerular necrosis, can rapidly induce NGAL expression 
in the kidney and its release from the glomeruli. NGAL is expressed in injured glomeruli and can induce epithelial regeneration. It is also generally released into the blood in large amounts within 2h of injury and excreted via 
the urine20. A study of urinary NGAL levels in 132 cases of decompensated cirrhosis patients by Barreto et al.

found that urinary NGAL levels in AKI patients were signifcantly higher than those in non-AKI patients, NGAL 
levels with persistent AKI were signifcantly higher than those with transient AKI, and that it could be used to 
distinguish hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) from kidney failure due to other causes. A study by Verna et al.
11 found 
that urinary NGAL concentrations of 110ng/mL were associated with a sensitivity of 88% and a specifcity of 85% 
for the diagnosis of non-prerenal AKI in decompensated cirrhosis patients. NGAL is an independent predictor 
of irreversible kidney function injury, and thus might be independent of other commonly used risk factors for 
predicting patient mortality21. Te present study also found that urinary NGAL levels were signifcantly higher in

kidney injury (AKI) secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and 
the combined detection factor serving as a screening index for AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis had 
sensitivities of 63.4%, 68.3%, 80.2% and 89.1%, respectively and specifcities of 81.6%, 72.1%, 74.9%, and 95.8%, 
respectively.

the group with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis than in the non-AKI and healthy control groups, and 
that urinary NGAL levels increased signifcantly with AKI progression. Te ROC curve showed 53.54µg/L as the 
predictive value for the diagnosis of AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis, which was associated with high 
specifcity and sensitivity.
Cys C is only eliminated from the body via the kidneys, and kidney microlesions during the early stages can 
lead to changes in serum Cys C. An increasing number of studies have confrmed that this can serve as a marker 
for evaluating the status and prognosis of acute kidney injury22. In addition, serum Cys C levels are not easily 
afected by age, sex, race, or body mass; moreover, it is especially worth noting that hyperbilirubinemia does not 
interfere with serum Cys C monitoring23. Cys C > 1.23mg/L has a sensitivity of 66% and a specifcity of 86% for 
the diagnosis of AKI, and is also a good predictive index for short-term disease-related mortality24. Cys C can 
refect GFR with more sensitivity than creatinine during a short period of mild to moderate injury, and allows 
for acute renal failure to be detected earlier, and even with greater diagnostic accuracy, as compared to that with 
serum creatinine. Studies have shown that upon mild kidney injury, Cys C begins to increase 1–2 d before creatinine increases, and Cys C gradually increases with disease progression23. Te present study also found that 
serum Cys C was signifcantly elevated in the group with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis compared 
to that in the non-AKI and healthy control groups. In addition, serum Cys C was signifcantly increased with AKI 
progression and levels were signifcantly increased among deceased patients compared to those in living patients. 
Tis indicates that serum Cys C can also serve as an efective index for monitoring AKI secondary to cirrhosis.
Te results of the present study show that urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels gradually 
increased with increasing disease severity when patients were classifed into diferent stages of AKI. Tis shows 
that these three indices are closely related to the severity of AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis; specifically, as urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels increase, the degree of kidney injury becomes 
more severe. At the same time, correlation analysis using patients with AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis revealed that urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels were negatively correlated with GFR, 
whereas these parameters showed no such correlation in the healthy control group. Tis confrms that urinary 
KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels can refect the status of glomerular fltration with high sensitivity.
As Child-Pugh class increased, urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C levels increased signifcantly. 
In Child-Pugh Class B patients, the levels of these three indices were all increased by greater than 50% compared 
to those in the control group, at which point the SCr response rate was not sensitive. SCr levels were signifcantly 
increased only in Child-Pugh Class C patients, at which point GFR had already decreased by greater than 50%. 
Tis fully explains the high sensitivity of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C for the diagnosis of 
AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis, and suggests that they can serve as early signs of disease progression.
Based on the roles of urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C in kidney injury, the present study 
evaluated their value in predicting AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. An ROC curve was plotted using 
urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, serum Cys C, and the combined detection factor as experimental variables and 
AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis (SCr increased by ≥26.5 µmol/L within 48h) as the state variable. It 
was found that urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, or serum Cys C alone, as well as the combined detection factor, all 
had predictive value for this condition (all p<0.05). However, the combined detection factor had the highest area 
under the ROC curve, and the sensitivity and specifcity were signifcantly higher. Terefore, the predictive value 
of this parameter was superior to any of the indices alone.
Urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C can serve as efective indices for diagnosing AKI secondary 
to decompensated cirrhosis. Tese three indices have greater sensitivity than traditional indices for monitoring kidney function, and can be utilized to evaluate the severity and prognosis of AKI. In addition, the combined detection factor has even higher predictive value for AKI secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. In the 
clinic, these three indices can be easily measured. Moreover, the dynamic observation of urinary KIM-1, urinary 
NGAL, and serum Cys C levels in decompensated cirrhosis patients allows the physician to understand changes 
in the disease and assess prognosis, and should be widely implemented. However, because the present study is a 
single-centre study with a small number of samples, the study is limited to a certain extent, and further confrmation with a large-sample, multi-centre, prospective clinical trial is needed in the future.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Study subjects comprised 150 patients with decompensated cirrhosis hospitalized at the 
Gastroenterology Department of the Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital between June 2015 and January 2017. 
Tey were divided into an AKI group (n=68) and a non-AKI group (n=82) according to dynamic changes in 
creatinine levels. At the same time, healthy individuals, based on physical examination (n=70), were selected 
as a control group. Te diagnostic criteria for decompensated cirrhosis were published in the 2012 update of the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guideline for Management of Adult Patients with 
Ascites Due to Cirrhosis25. Te inclusion criteria for the AKI group were the Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria12, presented as follows: increased SCr ≥26.5 µmol/L within 48 h, SCr increased 
by≥1.5-fold relative to baseline values within 7 d, or urine volume <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 continuous hours. Te 
150 decompensated cirrhosis patients were classifed according to Child-Pugh liver function class, with 24 class A 
patients, 55 class B patients, and 71 class C patients. Te exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of nephrotoxic medication use; (2) accompanying underlying kidney disease or liver cancer; (3) patients with concomitant 
conditions that might damage kidney function, including rheumatoid immune disease, diabetes and hypertension, coronary heart disease, or cardiac insufciency.
Ethical approval. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Tis study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, and all 
experiments in this research were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Data collection and biomarker assays. A clinical registration form was designed, and relevant clinical 
data and laboratory indices were recorded, including age, sex, weight, course of disease, aetiology, relevant complications, urinary KIM-1, urinary NGAL, and serum Cys C, among others. Blood and urine samples from hospitalized decompensated cirrhosis patients were continuously collected. A 5-mL sample of serum was collected 
from each patient afer fasting on the day of hospitalization and immediately centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15min 
at room temperature. A 0.5-mL aliquot of serum was placed in a sterile centrifuge tube and stored at −80 °C for 
further analyses. A 20-mL midstream urine sample was collected on the frst day afer hospitalization and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15min at room temperature to remove debris. To avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, 1.5-mL 
aliquots of the supernatant were placed in sterile centrifuge tubes and stored at −80°C until use. During analyses, 
all samples were thawed only once, and urine precipitates were thoroughly mixed afer complete thawing.
Measurement of serum creatinine levels: For this, the sarcosine oxidase assay was used. The Abbott 
ARCHITECT c16000 automatic biochemical analyzer (USA) and Sichuan Makerbio Co. Ltd. kits (China) were 
used for measurement.
Measurement of serum Cys C levels: Te particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay method 
was used for this assay. Te Abbott ARCHITECT c16000 automatic biochemical analyzer and Biosino Co. Ltd. 
Kits (China) were used for measurements. At the time of measurement, urine samples stored at −80 °C were 
thawed at room temperature. Te kit, stored at 4 °C, was placed at room temperature. For this assay, Cys C in the 
sample undergoes an agglutination reaction with anti-human Cys C antibodies in the latex particle suspension, 
forming an antigen-antibody latex complex and producing turbidity. Te level of this turbidity in the presence 
of a given amount of antibody is directly proportional to the amount of Cys C in the sample. By measuring the 
absorbance value at a specifc wavelength, serum Cys C content was calculated from a calibration curve.
Measurement of urinary KIM-1 levels: For this assay, an ELISA method was used. Wuhan Boster Biological 
Technology. Ltd. Kits (China) and associated standards were used. At the time of measurement, urine samples 
that were previously stored at −80 °C were thawed at room temperature. Te kit, which was also maintained at 
4 °C, was placed at room temperature. A microplate coated with purifed antibodies was used and a solid carrier 
was prepared. Samples or standards, biotinylated KIM-1 antibody, and HRP-labelled avidin were successively 
added to KIM-1 antibody-coated microplates, and TMB colorimetric substrate was added afer thorough washing. For this assay, TMB turns blue with the catalytic action of peroxidase, and is converted to a yellow colour afer 
the addition of acid. Te depth of colour in the samples is directly proportional to the amount of KIM-1 in the 
sample. Te absorbance at 450nm (OD value) was measured using a spectrophotometer, and the concentration 
in the sample was subsequently calculated.
Measurement of urinary NGAL levels: The ELISA method was used for this. Wuhan Boster Biological 
Technology. Ltd. Kits (China) and associated standards were also used. At the time of measurement, urine samples stored at −80 °C were thawed at room temperature. A microplate coated with purifed NGAL antibodies was 
used and a solid carrier was prepared. NGAL was successively added to monoclonal antibody-coated microplates, 
which were bound to HRP-labelled NGAL antibodies, forming antibody-antigen-enzyme-labelled-antibody 
complexes. TMB colorimetric substrate was added afer thorough washing. For this assay, TMB turns blue with 
the catalytic action of HRP, and is converted to a yellow colour afer the addition of acid. Te depth of colour in 
the samples is directly proportional to the amount of NGAL in the sample. Te absorbance at 450nm (OD value) 
was measured using a spectrophotometer, and the NGAL concentration of the sample was then calculated.
GFR was calculated according to the Cockcrof-Gault formula as follows:
GFR ( = − 140 age) × × body mass/72 SCr × . 0 84(0 8. . 5 if female)
Assessment of renal function. Te KDIGO criteria12 defnes AKI as an increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL 
(26.5 μmol/L) within 48h, an increase in SCr to ≥1.5-fold that of baseline values, which is known or presumed 
to have occurred within the previous 7 d, or urine volume <0.5mL/kg/h for 6h. Stage 1 is defned as an increase 
in serum creatinine to more than 1.5–1.9-fold greater than baseline values, an increase in SCr ≥0.3mg/dL (26.5 
μmol/L), or urine output <0.5mL/kg/h for 6–12h. Stage 2 was defned as an increase in serum creatinine to more 
than 2.0–2.9-fold greater than baseline values or urine output <0.5mL/kg/h for ≥12h. Stage 3 was an increase in 
serum creatinine to more than 3.0-fold that of baseline values, an increase in SCr to ≥4.0mg/dL (353.6 μmol/L), 
the initiation of renal replacement therapy, urine output <0.3mL/kg/h for ≥24h, or anuria for ≥12h.
Statistical analysis. Epidata 3.1 sofware was used for data registration. SPSS 19.0 sofware was used for 
data analysis. Normally distributed quantitative data are shown as the mean±standard deviation. Analysis of 
variance was used to compare diferences among multiple groups. Te LSD test was used for pairwise comparisons. Pearson correlation analysis was used for the correlation analysis of bivariate normally distributed data. Te 
logistic equation was used to establish a combined detection factor according to the predicted boundary values 
for each indicator, and then the ROC curve was plotted. Te signifcance level was α=0.05, and p<0.05 was 
considered statistically signifcant.
Data availability. Te datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from 
the corresponding author on reasonable request.
