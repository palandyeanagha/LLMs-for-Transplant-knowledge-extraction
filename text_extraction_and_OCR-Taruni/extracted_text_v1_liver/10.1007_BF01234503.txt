Summary. Forty-eight mongrel dogs were made diabetic by total pancreatectomy. Fifteen untreated 
pancreatectomized animals survived for a mean of 
7 + 1 (SEM) days. Thirty-three dogs were divided 
into five groups and received autotransplants to the 
spleen of pancreatic fragments dispersed by collagenase digestion for 0, 10, 15, 20 or 25 minutes. Animals transplanted with tissue digested for 0 minutes 
or for 10 minutes remained hyperglycaemic (mean 
survival 22 + 12 days and 28 + 9 days). Normoglycaemia occurred in all but one of 21 dogs transplanted with tissue digested for 15-25 minutes. Two 
weeks after transplantation tolbutamide and glucose 
tolerance curves in the group receiving tissue digested for 20 minutes most closely resembled those 
of normal animals. Glucose tolerance test K values 
in dogs receiving tissue digested for 15, 20 and 25 
minutes were 1.20 + 0.19 percent, 1.60 + 0.25 percent and 0.78 + 0.08 percent, respectively. The 
K values of the transplanted animals were significantly different from the K value of 0,35 + 0.05 
percent in the apancreatic control dogs (p < 0.001). 
The mean K value of the dogs transplanted with tissue digested for 20 minutes was significantly better 
than the value in the dogs transplanted with tissue 
digested for 25 minutes (p < 0.02), but was significantly less than the K value (3.30 + 0.27 percent) 
obtained in 22 normal control dogs (p < 0.005). 
Hyperglycaemia recurred immediately following 
splenectomy in 12 normoglycaemic dogs 10 weeks 
after transplantation and all animals died. The remaining normoglycaemic transplanted dogs survived 
for at least six months. Histological examination of 
spleens from the transplanted animals showed the 
presence of islet and exocrine tissue within the sple1 Current address: G.J. Kretschmer, M. D., I. Surgical University Clinic, Alser StraBe 4, A-1097 Vienna, Austria

Many investigators have reported that experimental 
diabetes in rodents can be ameliorated by autotransplantation [1-8] or allotransplantation [9-14] of 
pancreatic islet tissue. Only sporadic reports of islet 
transplantation in larger animals, such as the pig 
[15] and monkey [16], have appeared; these attempts have been less successful, largely because the 
techniques of islet preparation used for rats [17] are 
not easily applied to larger species [18]. Low islet 
yield is a major obstacle for clinical transplantation. 
One approach to the problem of recovering 
a sufficient amount of islet tissue is to transplant 
pancreatic fragments without separation of exocrine 
and endocrine components. The feasibility of this 
approach is suggested by the following evidence: (a) 
dispersed neonatal rat pancreatic tissue can be successfully transplanted without specific islet isolation 
to diabetic rats [19, 20]; (b) adult dog pancreatic 
fragments, depleted of exocrine enzymes by short 
term tissue culture, can prolong survival and reduce 
the incidence of hyperglycaemia when autotransplanted via the portal vein to partially pancreatectomized dogs treated with streptozotocin [21]; and (c) 
Mirkovitch and Campiche successfully implanted 
fresh pancreatic fragments into the spleen of diabetic dogs [22]. 
Principal questions regarding transplantation of 
pancreatic fragments are: (a) how can the pancreatic 

496 G.J. Kretschmer et al.: Transplantation of Dispersed Pancreas in Dogs 
tissue be most effectively dispersed; (b) will islets 
transplanted in association with exocrine tissue and 
enzymes function as a free graft; and (c) will the 
exocrine tissue and enzymes be injurious to the 
host? In this report, we describe a method of tissue 
preparation and the results obtained with autotransplantation of fresh pancreatic fragments into the 
spleen of totally pancreatectomized dogs. 
Materials and Methods 
Animals 
Twenty-two dogs did not undergo surgery and constituted the normal control group (NC) for establishment of normal fasting plasma glucose levels and 
normal intravenous glucose and tolbutamide tolerance curves. 
Forty-eight dogs were subjected to total pancreatectomy. Fifteen pancreatectomized dogs received no treatment and constituted the apancreatic 
control group (APC). The remaining 33 pancreatectomized dogs were randomly placed in five experimental groups and received autotransplants of pancreatic tissue into the spleen. Ringers' lactate was 
administered intravenously for the first three postoperative days to all pancreatectomized animals. 
Thereafter they were maintained on water ad libitum, standard kennel diet, and commercial pancreatic extract (Viokase, Viobin Corporation) in an attempt to compensate for exocrine enzyme deficiency. 
Technique of Pancreatic Tissue Preparation and 
Transplantation in Experimental Groups 
The main pancreatic duct was cannulated immediately before pancreatectomy and the pancreas was 
disrupted with retrograde injection of 30-50 ml cold 
(4 ~ C) Hanks'solution containing 8.25 mg/100 ml 
of aprotinin (Trasylol, FBA Pharmaceuticals). FoP 
lowing removal, the entire pancreas was minced in 
a mechanical tissue chopper [21] and digested at 37 ~ 
in a shaking water bath with 600 units of collagenase (Worthington, Type IV)/ml of settled tissue for 
varying amounts of time (0, 10, 15, 20 or 25 minutes. The mean (+ SEM) wet weight of pancreas 
contained in 1 ml of chopped tissue was 0.41 
_+ 0.01 gm. The five experimental groups were 
based on the duration of collagenase digestion. The 
number of dogs in each experimental group was 5, 
7, 8, 7, and 6 respectively. 
Islet cell and exocrine enzyme attrition during 
the tissue preparation was estimated by determining 
the tissue insulin and amylase content of aliquots taken after each step in the process. These measurements were made under the assumption that tissue 
amylase content and insulin content are proportional to pancreatic beta cell and exocrine tissue mass, 
respectively [23]. Insulin was measured by the double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique of Morgan and Lazarow [24], using porcine insulin standards (gifts of the Eli Lilly Co.). Amylase was measured by the technique of Jamieson et al [25] using 
hog pancreatic alpha amylase (Sigma Chemicals, 
900 units/rag) as the standard. 
The entire quantity of pancreatic tissue remaining after collagenase digestion was immediately 
transplanted to the spleen of each autograft recipient. The splenic and short gastric vessels were occluded with vascular clamps, the splenic capsule was 
punctured, and an angiographic catheter (internal 
diameter 2 mm) with wire guide was directed into 
the splenic pulp from the upper to the lower pole. 
The wire was removed and a syringe containing the 
dispersed pancreatic tissue (20-40 ml) was connected to the catheter. The pancreatic tissue was evenly 
distributed throughout the splenic pulp as the catheter was gradually withdrawn. Haemostasis was obtained by suturing a piece of gelatin sponge (Gelfoam, Upjohn Company) over the site of capsular 
puncture and splenic circulation was re-established 
by removing the vascular clamps. 
Survival and Metabolic Studies 
All results are given as mean + SEM. Significance 
of differences between groups (p values) were calculated using Student's t-test for small numbers. 
Fasting plasma glucose determinations were 
made in APC and experimental dogs before and immediately after pancreatectomy, daily for two weeks 
after operation, and weekly thereafter. Plasma glucose levels were measured in duplicate by the glucose oxidase method [26] using a Beckman autoanalyzer. An additional glucose determination was 
made in the experimental dogs 4 hours after transplantation. Normoglycaemia was defined as 
a plasma glucose of less than 150 mg/100 ml after 
a 12 hours fast. 
Eight of the APC dogs who were alive at 5 days 
after pancreatectomy had intravenous tolbutamide 
tolerance tests performed and 6 of the APC dogs 
who were alive at 7 days had intravenous glucose 
tolerance tests performed. The twenty-one of the 
thirty-three autotransplant recipients that became 
normoglycaemic were subjected to glucose tolerance 
tests at 14 days and tolbutamide tolerance tests at 
16 days after transplantation. For glucose tolerance

tests, 0.5 gm of glucose/kg body weight was administered, and for tolbutamide tolerance tests 50 mg of 
tolbutamide was administered to each dog. Blood 
samples were collected before injection (0 minutes) 
and at I0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after 
injection. K values (percent decline of plasma glucose concentrations per minute) during glucose tolerance tests were calculated from the 10, 20, and 30 
minute postinjection plasma glucose values, according to the method of Moorhouse et al. [27]. Plasma 
insulin levels were measured by the method of Morgan and Lazarow [24]. 
Ten weeks after transplantation, splenectomies 
were performed in four dogs from each of the experimental groups receiving tissue digested for 15, 20, 
and 25 minutes. Plasma glucose Ievels were measured immediately and daily until death. 
Spleen specimens, obtained from the splenectomized dogs and from the experimental dogs that 
died during the study, were fixed in 5 percent formalin or Bouin's solution, and routinely processed 
for histological examination. Formalin fixed specimens were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H 
& E) or with phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin 
(PTAH) [28, 29]. Bouin's fixed specimens were 
stained with aldehyde fuchsin [30]. Spleen sections 
were examined for the presence of exocrine tissue 
(zymogen granules within acinar ceils stained purple 
with PTAH) and islets (beta cells stained purple 
with aldehyde fuchsin), and for evidence of splenic 
pulp destruction. A cyst encountered in one spleen 
was aspirated and the fluid analyzed for amylase 
content.

dogs that survived at least 5 days confirmed the 
functional apancreatic state. Plasma insulin before 
and after stimulation with tolbutamide and glucose 
were below the lowest level of the insulin assay sensitivity (< 4 BU/ml). No dog was found to have residual pancreatic fragments or ectopic pancreatic tissue at autopsy. 
Experimental Dogs. Table 1 shows the incidence of 
normoglycaemia in pancreatectomized recipients of 
pancreatic tissue that had been subjected to varying 
periods of collagenase digestion. None of the five 
transplant attempts with undigested tissue was successful, all dogs remaining hyperglycaemic, dying 
between the fourth and fifty-sixth day (mean survival 22 _+ 12 days). 
One of seven recipients of tissue digested for 10 
minutes became normoglycaemic and survived the 
entire observation period (6 months). One other 
dog in this group died on the first postoperative day 
as a result of a technical complication (splenic rupture) associated with improper distribution of 
a large volume of tissue. The hyperglycaemic dogs 
of the 10 minute experimental group lived for five 
to fifty-three days (mean survival 28 + 9 days). 
Twenty of the 21 dogs receiving grafts of pancreatic tissue digested for 15, 20, or 25 minutes became normoglycaemic. The fasting plasma glucose 
levels of these three groups of animals had a similar 
pattern, and consisted of two peaks (Fig. 1). The 
first peak occurred during the operative procedure, 
and corresponded to the apancreatic phase. The second peak lasted for several days, but varied with the 
length of collagenase digestion. The second peak 
was of the shortest duration in the dogs receiving 
tissue digested for 20 minutes. Results of intravenous tolbutamide and glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 2 
and 3) further suggest that glucose metabolism was 
best regulated in the 20 minute experimental group. 
Quantitative differences between the successful 
groups and the normal and apancreatic control dogs 
are shown in Table 2. The K value of the 20 minute 
group was increased significantly over that of the 25 
minute group (p < 0.02) but not over that of the 15 
minute group (p > 0.2). Although the K values of 
the 15, 20, and 25 minute groups were significantly 
less than that of the normal control dogs (p 
< 0.005), the values are clearly improved over those 
for the APC dogs (p < 0.001). 
Mean fasting and peak plasma insulin levels during tolbutamide and glucose tolerance tests in the 
successfully transplanted dogs were 6 _+ 1, 10 
_+ 2 and 7 + 1 ~tU/ml, respectively. In contrast, 
mean fasting and peak plasma insulin levels during 
tolbutamide and glucose tolerance tests in the normal control dogs were 6 _+ 1, 34 + 16 and 39 
_+ 12 ~tU/ml, respectively. 
All pancreatectomized dogs lost weight, including transplanted animals in which the diabetic state 
was ameliorated. We were unable to distinguish between weight loss due to pancreatic endocrine or exocrine deficiency, but all pancreatectomized dogs 
had loose and foul stools suggesting that administration of Viokase was inadequate therapy for pancreatic exocrine deficiency. 
In the one dog in the 15 minute collagenase digestion group who remained hyperglycaemic, the

dispersed pancreas was improperly implanted, resuiting in uneven distribution of the tissue within the 
spleen. This dog survived 33 days and at autopsy 
a cyst was encountered in the lower pole of the 
spleen. The amylase level within the cyst was equivalent to the serum amylase level of normal dogs. 
Splenectomy. The hyperglycaemic state immediately 
recurred in all 12 experimental dogs that underwent 
splenectomy. They all died between one and 14 days 
after splenectomy (mean survival 4 _+ 1 days) with 
a mean plasma glucose before death of 312 
+ 24 mg/100 ml. The remaining dogs in the experimental groups have remained normoglycaemic 
throughout 6 months of observation. 
Spleen Morphology. Except for the one ruptured 
spleen and the one spleen with a cyst in the lower 
pole, all spleens examined at autopsy or at the time 
of spleneetomy showed perisplenic adhesions, but 
were otherwise grossly normal. Pancreatic tissue, irregularly distributed throughout the splenic pulp, 
was easy to detect on light microscopic examination 
of sections stained with I-/& E (Fig. 4). The charac-

Insulin and Amylase Content of Pancreatic Tissue 
Pancreatic processing resulted in a loss of tissue insulin and amylase. The mean total pancreatic insulin 
and amylase contents before and after processing 
are summarized in Table 3. Slightly less than half of 
total tissue insulin and more than half of tissue amylase were lost during mincing. Tissue insulin and 
amylase content decreased with increasing lengths of 
collagenase digestion, indicating destruction of both 
islets and exocrine tissue during the digestion 
process.

teristic morphologic configuration of the acinar tissue was unmistakable. 
There was no abnormal reaction of the surrounding splenic tissue in the vicinity of the implanted pancreatic tissue. In some areas the pancreatic 
tissue was arranged in small cysts lined with flattened epithelial appearing cells. Other areas harboured well formed acini. Zymogen granules could 
be identified at the apex of pyramidal exocrine cells 
upon staining with PTAH (Fig. 5). 
Using aldehyde fuchsin stain, beta cells were positively identified in the vicinity of exocrine tissue 
and elsewhere in the spleen. We detected solitary 
cells as well as structures resembling intact islets of 
Langerhans. Beta cells were partially degranulated, 
but under high power oil immersion lens aldehyde 
fuchsin positive material was demonstrated to consist of discrete intracellular granules. 
Previous failures with transplantation of the adult 
pancreatic fragments [31] led to the concept that 
a pure pancreatic islet preparation was most desirable for successful transplantation [1, 2, 4, 5]. To 
achieve that goal, cumbersome methods (Ficoll gradient separation or hand picking under a dissecting 
microscope) were used to isolate islets from dispersed pancreas. Unfortunately, these techniques 
result in islet loss [17, 18], require multiple donors 
to obtain a sufficient quantity of islets for transplantation [1, 18], and are difficult to apply to a higher 
species [15, 16]. 
Our experiment and the results of other studies 
[22] show that in the dog diabetes can be ameliorated by transplantation of pancreatic fragments 
without separation of exocrine and endocrine components. The spleen can accommodate the large volume of tissue that must be tranplanted when islets 
are not isolated. The presence of exocrine tissue 
seems to have no detrimental effect on the transplanted islets. 
Islet embolization to the liver by direct injection 
into the portal system increases the efficiency of islet 
transplantation in rats [5, 20], but is impractical for 
infusion of large quantities of fresh pancreatic fragments in the dog because of the induction of portal 
hypertension [21]. Transplantation to the spleen 
may provide physiological benefits similar to those 
ascribed to intrahepatic transplantation by assuring 
that insulin secreted by the grafted tissue drains into 
the portal system via the splenic vein. In addition, 
the spleen appears to be relatively resistant to damage by implanted pancreatic exocrine tissue. This resistance may be related to dilution of the exocrine 
enzymes by the rapid sinusoidal blood flow of the 
spleen, although no direct measurements were made 
in our experiments to support this hypothesis. 
A well vascularized bed favourably influences the 
results of endocrine tissue transplantation in general 

G.J. Kretschmer et al.: Transplantation of Dispersed Pancreas in Dogs 501 
[31], and the spleen provides the transplanted tissue 
with ideal access to a blood supply. 
From the technical point of view, transplanting 
pancreatic fragments into the spleen is feasible. 
Neither arterial nor venous blood supply was compromised by the direct puncture and haemostasis 
was easily achieved. Cross clamping the splenic vessels during tissue implantation effectively kept the 
tissue within the splenic pulp, as proven by the recurrence of hyperglycaemia and death after splenectomy in transplanted dogs. Mean survival after removal of the spleen was similar to that of control 
dogs after pancreatectomy. 
Histologically, all pancreatic tissue components 
were identified in the spleens of recipient dogs. Islets stained positive with aldehyde fuchsin, although 
beta cells were not as heavily granulated as in normal pancreas. Acinar ceils were easily identified and 
were packed with zymogen granules, perhaps owing 
to the lack of a stimulus for secretion. The presence 
of exocrine tissue within the spleen did not appear 
to be detrimental to associated islets or to surrounding splenic parenchyma. The one incident of a splenic cyst could not be definitely attributed to degeneration of exocrine tissue because the amylase level 
of the cyst fluid was equivalent to normal serum 
amylase levels. 
The preparation of the pancreatic tissue for 
transplantation was particularly important. As in all 
free grafts, the size of the tissue fragments was critical. Mechanical mincing alone was not sufficient and 
tissue dispersal by collagenase digestion was needed. 
Although islet loss (as judged by tissue insulin content) occurred with mincing alone, collagenase digestion was responsible for the majority of islet tissue 
attrition. By avoiding collagenase digestion, the islet 
yields were higher, but the results of transplantation 
were poorest and normoglycaemia could not be 
achieved. Although collagenase digestion of the 
pancreatic tissue was necessary, a balance existed 
between the need for tissue dispersal and for preservation of islet mass. Digestion for 10 minutes was 
relatively ineffective. However, all but one dog receiving tissue digested for 15 minutes became normoglycaemic. Digestion for 20 minutes appeared to 
provide the optimal balance, even though the average islet yield was only 7.4 percent. All dogs transplanted with tissue digested for 20 minutes became 
normoglycaemic. Digestion for 25 minutes resulted 
in an average islet yield of 5.5 percent; although the 
dogs in this group had fasting normoglycaemia, glucose and tolbutamide tolerance curves were clearly 
inferior to the 20 minute group. 
Our experiments show that islets within appropriately dispersed pancreatic fragments are able to 
maintain normal fasting plasma glucose levels when 
transplanted to the spleen of totally pancreatectomized dogs. Recipient animals are also able to respond functionally to challenge with glucose and tolbutamide, However, even in the best experimental 
group (20 minutes digestion), elimination of glucose 
from the circulation was not as efficient as in normal 
animals (as determined by K value). Furthermore, 
insulin concentration in the peripheral circulation 
did not increase following glucose or tolbutamide 
stimulation. Similar observations have been made in 
rats following islet transplantation. Most likely insulin secretion is less than in normal animals, and insulin levels do not increase in the peripheral blood, 
because of almost complete hepatic extraction. 
Measurement of splenic vein insulin concentration 
in future experiments will be necessary to verify this 
hypothesis. 
Since total pancreatectomy provides an absolutely lethal diabetes when untreated, the results of 
transplantation are satisfactory. However, conservation of more islets during the pancreatic fragment 
preparation procedure, while maintaining the same 
degree of tissue dispersal, is required if carbohydrate metabolism is to be improved further in transplanted animals. 
The ultimate application of this technique to 
clinical diabetes appears promising. The recent success by surgeons in repairing or conservatively treating splenic injury [32, 33] suggests that the human 
spleen will be able to withstand the assault of tissue 
implantation. The response of the spleen to allogeneic tissue may be quite different from the response 
to autogenous tissue. Further experiments using 
pancreatic tissue allografts are needed in canine and 
other models of experimental diabetes.
