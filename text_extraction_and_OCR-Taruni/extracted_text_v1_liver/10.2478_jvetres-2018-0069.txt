Abstract
Introduction: Exposure to zoonotic factors in veterinary practice is closely related to the nature of the work. The main aim 
of the study was to determine the risk of selected zoonotic infections among the occupational group of veterinarians in Poland. 
Material and Methods: Blood samples of 373 veterinarians (162 males and 211 females) from 12 provinces of Poland were 
collected by the venipuncture of a forearm for serological tests. Commercial immunoenzymatic tests (ELISA) were used for 
detection of specific IgG antibodies to Echinococcus granulosus, IgM and IgG to Leptospira spp., and IgM, IgA, and I and II 
phase IgG to Coxiella burnetii. Enzyme-linked fluorescence assays (ELFA) were used to detect IgM and IgG antibodies to 
Toxoplasma gondii. Results: Positive results were found in 209 (56.0%) veterinarians for at least one of the examined diseases. 
The overall proportion of participants found to have specific Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in the IgM and/or IgG assays 
amounted to 44.5%. The presence of Coxiella burnetii antibodies was found in 16 (4.3%) subjects, while Leptospira spp. 
antibodies were detected in 63 (16.9%) veterinarians. Among the 373 veterinarians examined, no Echinococcus granulosus
antibodies were found. Conclusion: Results of the study seem to indicate a slightly elevated risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection 
and a moderate risk of infection with Leptospira spp. and Coxiella burnetii in veterinarians.
Keywords: veterinarians, Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp., Coxiella burnetii, Echinococcus granulosus.
Introduction
The risk of exposure to zoonotic factors in 
veterinary practice is closely related to the nature of 
the work. Infectious diseases occurring among 
veterinarians are underreported, hence practicing 
veterinarians should effectively protect their own health 
as well as that of staff. Many aetiological factors of 
infectious diseases are so far still poorly known, both 
concerning their occurrence in the environment and the 
transmission paths of diseases which jeopardise health.
Toxoplasma gondii (Nicolle and Manceaux, 1908) 
counts among the parasitic protozoa widespread in the 
environment and is the aetiological factor of 
toxoplasmosis. The course of toxoplasmosis in healthy 
people is usually subclinical, manifesting only with the 
presence of specific antibodies. T. gondii infection can 
be particularly dangerous in the case of primary 
invasion in pregnant women, due to the risk of invading 
the foetus. It can also have serious consequences for 
people with weakened immunity. Toxoplasmosis can 
also manifest in the form of inflammation of the eyes or 
neurological disorders, diagnosed even many years 
after the time of infection (5). Human infection is most 
often caused by ingestion of raw meat containing cysts 
of the parasite or consumption of food or water 
contaminated with oocysts (5, 26). An invasion may 
also result from direct contact with the faeces of an 
infected cat. The frequency of human infection in 
Poland based on serological studies is estimated at 
40%–60%. Results of studies on the animal reservoir in 
Poland show a significant level of infection (pigs 10%–
15%, cattle up to 20%, and cats up to 75%) and 
indicate the risk of invasion for consumers of raw meat

and for people who have direct contact with infected 
animals such as veterinarians (2, 23, 26). 
The aetiological factor of Q fever is the Gramnegative Coxiella burnetii. The main bacterial 
reservoirs are domestic animals (sheep, goats, and 
cattle) usually latently infected (18). Ticks are an 
important factor in the circulation of C. burnetii in 
nature, but human Coxiella infections are rarely caused 
by tick bites. The most common sources of infection 
are animals, their secretions, meat, skin products, and 
definitely less often the dust-like faeces of an infected 
tick which can get into the body through the nose, 
mouth, or eyes. C. burnetii usually infects humans by 
inhalation or by the intestinal route (as a result of 
infected milk consumption). Infected animals can 
excrete the bacteria with urine, faeces, and milk, and 
the pathogen may be present in placenta, amniotic 
fluid, and aborted foetuses (19) The first symptoms of 
infection are high fever, chills, weakness, and muscle 
and head pain. In the later phase of the disease,
pneumonia, liver damage, or endocarditis may occur. 
The people at the highest risk level are farmers of dairy 
animals and veterinarians (9). 
Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease 
caused by various species of Leptospira. The reservoir 
of Leptospira spp. is mainly dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, 
horses, and wild animals (31). These bacteria penetrate 
the body through damaged skin, conjunctiva, and 
mucous membranes (34). People can also be infected 
by the consumption of contaminated water or 
inhalation of an aerosol containing Leptospira (4). 
Leptospirosis may have different courses, from 
an asymptomatic form, through a mild influenza-like 
manifestation, to a serious multisystemic disease. In 
the severest cases multi-organ failure and death may 
occur (7).
Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease that 
is caused by eggs of a tapeworm from the genus 
Echinococcus. Definitive hosts which have mature 
tapeworms are the most common species of canids: 
foxes, wolves, dogs, and jackals (35). Man can become 
an intermediate host due to infection with eggs released 
to the environment by infected animals. The invasion 
occurs after eating food or drinking contaminated water 
(12). Symptoms of echinococcosis in intermediate 
hosts may be different, depending on the affected organ 
and size and number of blisters located in it (28). 
Blisters can cause pressure on blood vessels and bile 
ducts, induce jaundice, congestive cholangitis, and also 
cause coughing, shortness of breath, haemorrhage, 
chest pain, and even death (35). The clinical course of 
echinococcosis involving the liver and lungs, is usually 
chronic (from ingestion of eggs to the onset of the first 
clinical symptoms may take from several to a dozen 
or more years), while the location of the parasite 
in the brain or eyeball manifests early and usually 
inflicts diseases with a severe course. There are two 
species of this genus: single-chambered (Echinococcus 
granulosus) and multi-chambered (Echinococcus 
multilocularis). The last one is usually harder to treat 
due to lack of a definite border between host and 
parasite tissues. 
Many zoonoses (such as Q fever and leptospirosis) 
are regarded as neglected diseases which are properly 
diagnosed in Poland only in a small number of cases. 
However, they may be an important cause of 
occupational diseases, occurring mostly in farmers, 
veterinarians, butchers, and dairy workers. The main 
aim of the study was to determine the risk of selected 
zoonosis infections among occupational group of 
veterinarians in Poland. 
Material and Methods
A total of 373 veterinarians working in district 
veterinary inspectorates and private veterinary clinics 
located in 12 provinces of Poland (Fig. 1) were 
examined from June to December 2017. The examined 
veterinarians comprised 162 males (43.4%) and 211 
females (56.6%), and their age ranged from ≤30 to ≥61 
years. Blood samples of the veterinarians were 
collected by the puncture of a forearm vein for later 
serological tests. Each of the persons signed an 
informed consent form, and the research was 
approved by the Bioethical Commission of the 
Institute of Rural Health (Permit No. 9/2017). 
Commercial immunoenzymatic tests (ELISAs 
from Bordier Affinity Products SA, Switzerland) were 
used for testing serum samples for the presence of 
specific IgG antibodies to Echinococcus granulosus. 
The result was positive when the absorbance of the 
analysed sample was higher than the absorbance of 
weak positive serum. For II phase IgM, I phase IgG, 
and IgA to Coxiella burnetii assays (Institut 
Virion/Serion, Germany), the results were determined 
compared to absorbance of cut-off serum. Results 
were considered borderline when they fell in the range 
of 90%–110% of cut-off serum absorbance. In the 
IgM and IgG to Leptospira spp. and II phase IgG to 
Coxiella burnetii assays (Institut Virion/Serion, 
Germany), the mathematical curve fitting antibody 
quantification based on the 4-parameter logistic 
function was plotted with results expressed in U/mL. 
Borderline results of IgM antibodies to Leptospira
ranged from 15 to 20 U/mL, and to C. burnetii they 
ranged from 10 to 15 U/mL for IgG and from 20 to 
30 U/mL for II phase IgG. Enzyme-linked 
fluorescence assays (ELFA) (Vidas Toxo IgG and 
Vidas Toxo IgM, bioMérieux, France) were used to 
detect IgM and IgG Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. 
A Mini Vidas immunoanalyser device facilitated the 
tests (bioMérieux). An IgM index value <0.55 was 
considered a negative, ≥0.55 and <0.65 a borderline, 
and ≥0.65 a positive result. IgG class was given in 
IU/mL units where a result below 4 was considered 
a negative, ≥4 and <8 a borderline and ≥8 a positive 
result.

The performance of all tests and interpretation of 
results were carried out according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
The obtained qualitative data was subjected to 
statistical analysis with chi-squared (χ2) and 
Spearman’s tests using the Statistica 8.0 package 
(Statsoft Inc., USA). 
Results
Results of serological tests for the detection of 
Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. The overall proportion 
of participants found to have specific antibodies in IgM 
and/or IgG anti-Toxoplasma gondii amounted to 
44.5%. A statistically significant increase in the 
proportion of seropositive individuals was observed 
with age increase (from 25.42% in the age group below 
30 to 78.85% in the group of people over 61) 
(Spearman’s rank correlation test =0.39; P < 0.001). 
Considering only positive results, they were most 
commonly found in people aged 51–60, in both the 
IgM (7.25%) and IgG (68.12%) classes. Significantly 
more frequent positive results occurred in the group of 
men (55.21%) than in the group of women (36.19%) 
(χ2 = 13.4; P < 0.001). All persons who were positive in 
the IgM class (eight participants) also had positive 
results in the IgG class (Table 1).
Results of serological tests for the detection of 
Coxiella burnetii antibodies. The presence of specific 
Coxiella burnetii antibodies was found in 16 (4.29%) 
subjects. Most people with positive results were in the 
51–60-year-old age group (8.7%). The highest 
percentage of affected veterinarians was diagnosed 
with II phase IgG (3.22%). In turn, the lowest 
percentage was people with positive results in the IgM 
class (1.07%), which may indicate a recent infection. 
C. burnetii antibodies were more frequently detected in 
the group of men than women (6.13% and 2.86%, 
respectively), but it was not statistically significant 
(P = 0.13). Similarly, there was no statistically 
significant relationship between occurrence of 
seropositive results and age (Table 1).
Results of serological tests for the detection of 
Leptospira spp. antibodies. The presence of specific 
Leptospira spp. antibodies was detected in 63 (16.89%) 
practitioners. Antibodies in the IgM class were found in 
9.65% of veterinary workers, while positive results in 
the IgG class were detected in 8.04% of participants. 
The highest percentages of seropositive persons were 
found in the 31–40 (21.6%) and 51–60 age groups 
(20.29%). The lowest percentages of positive results 
were found in people over 61 years old (7.69%). There 
were no statistically significant correlations between 
the age of respondents and the incidence of positive 
results. Positive results were found more frequently in 
women than in men (20.48% and 12.27%, respectively) 
(χ2 = 4.4; P < 0.05) (Table 1).
Results of serological tests for the detection of 
Echinococcus granulosus antibodies. Among 373 
examined veterinarians, no Echinococcus granulosus
antibodies were found. However, ELISA results (OD 
value) in the case of 6 (1.6%) people were close to the 
border value for a positive result (cut-off). It was 
recommended that the test should be repeated 
approximately four weeks after the first blood sample 
was collected.
Among the investigated veterinarians, in 209 
(56.0%) cases positive results were found for at least 
one of the examined diseases. Two samples (0.5%) had 

480 A. Wójcik-Fatla et al./J Vet Res/62 (2018) 477-483
antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp., and 
Coxiella burnetii. In 24 (6.4%) participants the 
presence of T. gondii and Leptospira spp. antibodies 
was confirmed and in 8 (2.1%) cases the copresence of 
T. gondii and C. burnetii antibodies was found. Only in 
one case the co-occurrence of C. burnetii and 
Leptospira spp. antibodies (1.6%) was detected and the
result was statistically significant (χ2 = 3.6; P < 0.05) 
(Fig. 2).

Discussion
In Poland, seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in 
people lies in the 40%–60% range, depending on the 
examined group (17). The present study showed an 
overall 44.5% seroprevalence of T. gondii infection 
among veterinarians, and this infection rate does not 
appear to be very high against the known range for the 
general population. To date, numerous studies have 
suggested preventive strategies against toxoplasmosis 
for people having close contact with animals, in 
mitigation of the unavoidable high risk such workers 
are. Unfortunately, data reported on toxoplasmosis 
among this group of employees are limited. Previous 
studies suggested that veterinary personnel have 
a higher risk of T. gondii infection since they frequently 
interact with cats (25). However, other authors reported 
no significant difference in the prevalence of T. gondii
antibodies counterposing veterinary school students 
(5.6%) with undergraduate students of non-veterinary 
disciplines (2.4%) (21). Another study also observed no 
statistically significant difference in the infection rate 
between the veterinary laboratory science student group 
and the control group (22), and our results seem to 
correspond to this trend. In the present study, age was 
the only risk factor to have a significant impact on 
Toxoplasma seropositive status in tested persons, and 
those who were older were more likely to have 
T. gondii antibodies. Age was also considered 
a significant factor for seropositivity of vets in a study 
by Brandon-Mong et al. (2). Due to the high percentage 
of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies determined in the 
present study in veterinarians (about 45%), where this 
percentage reaches 25% in the group of people below 
30 years of age, veterinary service workers should be 
periodically subject to precautionary serological tests 
for toxoplasmosis. In particular, prophylactic 
examinations should cover women of childbearing age 
due to the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis.
On the basis of the conducted research, it can be 
stated that the awareness of veterinarians of the risks 
associated with some of the zoonoses is quite high, 
which is evidenced by negative results in 
echinococcosis test. According to the annual bulletin 
“Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland”, 
echinococcosis is recorded in Poland as one entity, and 
several dozen cases are registered annually (64 cases 
were reported in 2016 and 75 in 2017) (16). In Estonia,
Echinococcus spp. seroprevalence in the general 
population was 3.3% and 0.5% of the cases were 
confirmed by Western blot test. Among veterinarians 
the prevalence of positive results was 2.0% and among 
animal caretakers it was 1.1% (11). In Turkey, sera 
from two out of 93 veterinary surgeons (2.15%) were 
found to be positive for Echinococcus IgG antibody 
(10). The negative results of diagnostic tests for 
Echinococcus granulosus obtained in the present study 
could be the effect of the awareness of veterinarians or 
should be correlated with environmental study results 
regarding the occurrence of the above-mentioned 
pathogen.
Higher seroprevalence of leptospirosis and Q fever 
has been determined in veterinarians where the 
percentages of seropositive individuals were 16.89% 
and 4.29%, respectively. In one case, the entire family 
of a seropositive veterinarian was examined, and one 
child aged 10 was found to have Coxiella burnetii
antibodies, and the infection was most likely caused by 
ingestion (consumption of sheep’s milk cheeses). In 
Poland, the last epidemics occurred in 1983 in the 
Lublin region, and according to the annual report of the 
National Institute of Public Health – National Institute 
of Hygiene, only a single case of Q fever 
has been recognised since 2010. In the study of 
Fiecek et al. (8) on Coxiella burnetii infection, 4.4% 
seropositivity was found among cattle breeders and 
veterinarians. Q fever cases in Poland are statutorily 
recorded, and the zero figures for 2015, 2016, and 2017 
indicate that there were no incidents of this disease in 
the country. The seroprevalence in veterinarians in this 
study (4.3%) is lower than in farm workers in Poland, 
reported between 15.23% and 39.07% by SzymańskaCzerwińska et al. (27). Results presented in this study 
are also much lower than obtained by Monno et al. (15) 
in Italy, concerning subjects exposed to farm animals 
(73.4%) and a control group (13.6%). Lower results 
can be explained by the risk factor of Q fever 
associated with C. burnetii infection rising with the 
number of hours of animal contact per week (30). 
Veterinarians examined in this study probably had less 
contact with cattle, sheep, and goats than did farmers. 
The prevalence of antibodies to C. burnetii among 
Dutch livestock veterinarians reached 65.1% in 2012, 
which could be explained by the Q fever epidemics in 
the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010 (30). A higher 
risk among veterinarians, people associated with 
veterinary medicine, and veterinary students has been 
also demonstrated in other countries and is shown in 
seroprevalences: 22.2% in the United States (33), 
13.5% in Japan (1), 7% in Turkey (6), 26.3% in Taiwan 
(3), and 11.02% in Spain (29). The low seroprevalence 
among veterinarians from Poland in relation to other 
countries could be also explained by the use of animal 
vaccination since 2013.
The seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. in 
veterinarians from Poland (16.89%) is much higher 
than the 2.5% rate of leptospiral infection detected in 
veterinarians in the United States (32) or the 5.1% in 
New Zealand (24). A low frequency of leptospirosis 
was reported among veterinarians with a large animal 
practice (0.6%) in Argentina (14). However, in Mexico 
seropositivity for Leptospira spp. among swinespecialist veterinarians was 38.8% (20). No extensive 
epidemics of leptospirosis have occurred in Poland 
since the 1970s, and only a few cases of infection have 
been noted in the country. The prevalence of 
seropositive farmers noted in the study of Wasiński 
et al. (31) with field work conducted after a flood was 

482 A. Wójcik-Fatla et al./J Vet Res/62 (2018) 477-483
low (3%), and insignificantly small compared to 
farmers from areas not affected by the flood (9.2%). 
Such high prevalence of Leptospira antibodies detected 
among Polish veterinarians is therefore unexpected. To 
minimise the risk of human leptospirosis, vaccination 
of farm livestock could be considered, as is New 
Zealand practice with a cattle vaccine (13). 
Due to detection of anti Leptospira spp. and 
Coxiella burnetii antibodies at the levels of 17% and 
4%, respectively, there is a need to implement 
educational and prophylactic activities to counter 
threats from these pathogenes. It seems particularly 
important to broaden the knowledge of veterinarians 
regarding potential sources of infection both in the 
veterinarian's work environment and outside it.
In conclusion, our results seem to indicate 
a slightly elevated risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection 
in veterinarians, although this hazard remaining close 
to the level of risk for the general population. The 
results also indicate a moderate risk of infection with 
Leptospira spp. and Coxiella burnetii, while low or no 
risk seems to occur with regard to Echinococcus 
granulosus.
