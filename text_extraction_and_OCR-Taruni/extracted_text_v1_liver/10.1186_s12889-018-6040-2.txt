Abstract
Background: Community Case Management of malaria (CCMm) using Community Health Workers (CHWs) is
an approach to improve access to timely and effective malaria case management in malaria endemic
countries. So far the programme has been shown to be effective in many communities in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, questions remain on the sustainability of this programme due to the high dropout cases of CHWs
given their modest remuneration. The aim of the study was to identify challenges of achieving sustainable
community health services for CCMm.
Methods: A community based qualitative study was conducted in five districts in western Kenya where
CCMm was being undertaken. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with the
CHWs, mothers of children under-five years and key informants such as public health officers and clinicians
involved in the CCMm. The interviews were audio recorded and conducted in English, Swahili and the local
language. Recorded interviews were transcribed. Analysis was conducted using NVivo version 7 software,
where transcripts were coded after which themes related to the objectives of the study were identified.
Results: The community members, the CHWs and stakeholders perceived CCMm as an important approach
for reducing the burden of malaria. Key informants perceived lack of basic supplies (RDTs, gloves), drugs,
inadequate remuneration of CHWs and lack of basic working equipment as challenges for CCM. CHWs
highlighted that lack of drugs and basic supplies such as gloves at the health facilities, inadequate
community sensitization by health workers, inadequate stipend to meet basic needs, as challenges of
achieving sustainable CCMm. Some clinicians perceived that CHWs should not be given Artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) as part of the CCMm since they might misuse them.
Conclusion: This study shows that for CCMm to be sustainable, concerted efforts from stakeholders are
needed to boost the programme. Commodities needed for implementation of the programme need to be
readily available and the morale of the CHWs who undertake CCMm needs boosting.

Background
With an estimated 214 million cases of malaria worldwide
with 429,000 deaths in 2015, malaria continues to burden
the lives of several people especially that of Africans. Approximately 90% of all malaria deaths in 2015 occurred in
Africa with about 292 000 African children dying before
their fifth birthday because of malaria [1]. Many sick children in developing countries die at home because they do
not have access to health facilities [2]. Following the WHO
recommendations, most African countries scaled up Community Case Management of Malaria (CCMm) as an integral part of their health care delivery system, enhancing
community access to health care by providing services at
household and community levels. As a result, malaria burdened countries such as Kenya adopted CCMm as an approach to improve access to prompt and effective malaria
case management in communities [3]. CCMm is based on
the WHO recommendation that well-trained and supervised community health workers (CHWs) can provide
prompt and adequate treatment to fever cases within 24 h
to help reduce morbidity and mortalities due to malaria
among under-five children in Africa [4].
The goal of CHWs in CCMm is to provide treatment in
uncomplicated malaria and promptly refer patients beyond their level of training to the nearest health facility for
further treatment [5]. With CCMm, the CHWs diagnose
malaria with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treat with
Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to provide
prompt and adequate treatment for fever cases within
24 h to help reduce morbidity and mortality associated
with malaria among under-five children in sub-Saharan
Africa [1]. The services that CHWs provide promote
equitable expansion of coverage for a range of preventive,
promotive and curative health services [6, 7].
CCMm delivered by CHWs has proven to be an effective
approach for malaria treatment in several countries [8–11]
as it comes with free drugs, no transportation for treatment, availability of a care-provider even when health facilities are closed and also frequent follow-up by the CHWs
for the community members. In spite of these benefits to
the community, the CCMm programme faces implementation challenges that could undermine its sustainability. We
therefore, conducted a qualitative study to explore the challenges that influence the sustainability of CCMm.
Methods
Study sites
The study was conducted in five districts in western
Kenya where CHWs were undertaking CCMm. The
study sites and their characteristics are described in a
previous manuscript [12]. These districts were Kisumu
West, Nyando and Muhoroni which were in lowland hyperendemic region and, Kisii and Kenyenya which are in
the epidemic prone highlands of western Kenya.
Study participants and sample size
The study participants, the selection criteria and the
number of participants interviewed are described in full
in our previous publication [12]. Briefly, we interviewed
pregnant women and mothers/guardians of under-five
children who had received CCMm services from the
CHWs. We also interviewed the CHWs themselves and
key informants that included Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) who supervised the CHWs, clinicians and heads of health facilities in which the CHWs
are attached to, Public Health Officers (PHO) and
County and District and Medical Officers of Health.
Two community units were selected in each of the five
districts for the study. In each community unit, ten (10)
mothers/guardians of children under the age of five years
who have enjoyed the services of the CHWs, were selected
for interviews through focus group discussion. Therefore
there were 100 community members in total that were selected for the study from the 10 community units within
the 5 districts. From each community unit, 10 CHWs
were randomly selected for interviews; making a total of
100 CHWs from 10 community units in five districts.
Again, in each of the community unit, the CHEW who supervises the CHWs was picked for interview; therefore 10
CHEWs were selected for interviews in the 10 community
units in the five districts as key informants. The clinician
and heads of health facilities in each community unit
where the CHWs are attached were also interviewed.
Therefore, all together, 10 clinicians who were heads of institution were interviewed as key informants. In each of
the five districts we interviewed the Public Health Officer
(PHO) and the district or county director of health [12].
Study design and sampling technique
A qualitative cross sectional study was undertaken in
which in-depth interviews and focus group discussions
(FGDs) were undertaken with the study participants
using semi-structured and structured interview guides.
Two community units where CCMm were being undertaken by CHWs were picked from each district by convenient sampling.
As described in our previous manuscript, [12] all CHWs
and pregnant mothers and/or caregivers of under five children from households within the same community unit
(CU) and who have ever been served by a CHW were
brought together at the health facility to be interviewed
through FGDs. Key informants that included the CHEWs,
heads and clinicians of health facilities, Public Health Officers, and County and District Medical Officers of Health
were interviewed separately in their offices.
Data collection
Interview guides were developed and were piloted in a
non-study community in the Kisumu West district of
Boakye et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:1150 Page 2 of 8

western Kenya. The FGDs and key informant interview
guide included questions that related to the views of the
various categories of people interviewed on the sustainability of the CCMm programme. The questions were
varied based on the category of person being interviewed
so as to capture different themes and to answer different
questions. The interview guides were first written in
English, translated into the local language (Dholuo or
Swahili) and later back translated into English by a different person to ensure accuracy. The data collected
were qualitative and were recorded by two audio recorders. FGDs for CHWs and mothers from the communities were rendered in the local language (Dholuo
and Kiswahili which are widely spoken and understood)
and were later translated into English. The key informants were interviewed in English.
All study participants signed a consent form after they
were adequately informed of the purpose of the study.
The study was undertaken from May to September 2014.
Data management and analysis
The data were recorded by two audio recorders and were
later transcribed, translated, coded and organized into
themes based on the responses of the interviewees. All the
transcripts were read as individual wholes to gain an overall understanding of the data. Transcripts were coded
using NVivo version 7 software. A common induction approach to coding based on phenomenology allowed us to
explore the perception of the different categories of people
on the challenges of achieving sustainable CCMm [13].
The results of our coding was compared for consistency
of text segmentation and code application. When results
were acceptable and consistent, the coding continued with
periodic checks for continued intercoder agreement.
Results
Demographic characteristics of respondents
The median age of mothers interviewed in the FGDs was
24 years (range 19–36 years). The median age of CHWs
was 32 years (range 25–59 years) CHEWs were aged between 32 and 47 years with median age of 37, whilst the
ages of the clinicians and district/county director of health
ranged from 28 to 52 years. Among the clinicians and
PHOs that were interviewed, 40% (8/20) of them were female. Majority of the CHWs (64%) have had their education up to secondary school with the rest having finished
primary education whilst only 22% of the mothers had finished secondary school, with 54% finishing primary education and 24% with no education. None of the participants
declined to be part of the study [12].
General comments
In general, all participants felt that CCMm being undertaken by the CHWs was crucial in the efforts to mitigate
the spread and effects of malaria. They perceived the
benefits of CCMm as: i) Providing prompt access to and
timely initiation of treatment for community members
and their children infected by malaria ii) availability of
free malaria treatment at the comfort of their homes, iii)
avoiding walking long distances from their homes to the
health facilities, iv) avoiding long queues at the health facilities among others.
Despite these benefits the CCMm programme has several challenges that needs to be overcome to make it
sustainable. These include the fact that clinicians at the
hospital thinks that CHWs might over treat clients in
the community leading to drug resistance, the lack of a
constant remuneration for the CHWs undertaking
CCMm, the erratic supply of drugs, basic consumables
and accoutrements needed by the CHWs to perform
their duties. These are discussed below:
Perception of key informants (CHEWs, health facility
in-charges and PHOs) on CHWs challenges to undertake
CCMm
Clinicians view on CHWs dispensing drugs in the
community
A number of clinicians were of the view that CHWs
should not be given drugs to use in the community as part
of the CCMm. They perceived that the CHWs would misuse of the drugs by giving the wrong dosage. Overdose of
drugs to anyone with malaria, they said, will lead to adverse effects while over prescription could also lead to
drug resistance. Children and infants are given ACTs
based on their weights and CHWs who are not well vexed
in these calculations might give the wrong doses. Again,
their assertion is that sometimes the person might not be
suffering from malaria alone but other ailments which the
CHWs might not be able to diagnose or even treat.
The clinicians are of the view, that CHWs could do
the diagnosis of malaria in the community with the
RDTs, then give some pain killers to anyone who might
have fever and encourage the patient to go to the nearest
health facility with a referral note. They should not commence anti-malaria treatment but rather the patient has
to be observed by the clinician in the health facility before drugs are prescribed.
Because of this reason many clinicians who are in charge
of health facilities have not been giving anti-malaria drugs
to the CHWs but only give out pain killers and RDTs for
their work in the communities.
Lack of drugs and basic supplies
According to the CHEWs and PHOs, sometimes
anti-malaria drugs and also supplies such as the RDTs
are occasionally out-of-stock in the health facilities.
CHWs could go for long periods without RDTs, gloves
and other supplies they need for their work. This is quite
Boakye et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:1150 Page 3 of 8

frequent making their work difficult. This means that
the CHWS sometimes do not have access to commodities that they need to work with in the communities.
This is challenging for the CHWs since they cannot get
drugs for their clients. Also, clients that they refer do
not get drugs at the health facilities. Some community
members therefore do not appreciate the CHWs referring them to the health facilities.
“.......the drug cannot be obtained from the hospital
and the hospital go for long periods without the
drugs.” PHO in a KII.
“One area that needs improvement is the area of
procurement of commodities, drugs and the gloves for
the CHW, because for now there is still no clear
channel for the CHWs. There comes at times that they
can even go up to a whole month even without RDTs
and drugs.” CHEW in a KII.
Remuneration of CHWs
CHWs are the main pillars behind the CCMm. Their motivation is crucial in achieving sustainability with the
programme. The key informants think that for CCMm to
be successful, CHWs should be well motivated which include they need to be compensated well for their time and
not just be considered volunteers. Volunteerism they
claim cannot be sustained for many years. There was a
feeling among the CHEWs and PHOs that the stipend
that are paid to the CHWs cannot meet the basic needs of
the CHWs. The CHWs are primarily volunteers from the
community however, they get a monthly stipend of KES
2000 ($20) from NGOs working in partnership with the
Ministry of Health that are stakeholders in malaria control. Whatever they get also experiences long delays.
“........ I think that the salary they are getting is not
enough and worse off, it sometimes delays for several
months before they get it.” PHO in a KII.
Lack of basic working equipment
The key informants think that one of the ways that could
sustain the CCMm programme is to make sure that
CHWs are well equipped for the task of undertaking the
CCMm in the community. CHEWs think that the CHWs
are challenged on a number of working gears, which include basic supplies like raincoats or umbrellas and gumboots they need to perform their functions when it is
rainy or when it is muddy. They also think that since
sometimes CHWs are called at night to attend to clients,
their security could be enhanced by being given torchlights otherwise they could be robbed or even bitten by a
snake on their way to a clients place. The clinicians assert
that the CHWs do not have any means to reach their clients’ houses but just walk to the place by themselves. They
think that CHWs will benefit greatly and their output enhanced if bicycles are given to them to perform their functions instead of walking from one compound to another.
Lack of trust by some community members
Some community members do not trust the CHWs for
the reason that they are not adequately trained to handle
some health services. Though these are few people who
have this belief, the feeling was that they might infect
more people with their ideas.
Perception of CHWs on challenges of CCMm
Conflicting information from healthcare workers
The CHWs asserts that a lack of clear information about
health facility charges to clients by some health care
workers makes it difficult for them to be trusted by some
community members, particularly on malaria treatment
that is considered free of charge. Malaria diagnosis and
treatment are supposed to be free, according to the government policy, but in practice this is not so with the
health facilities who charge fees for both because they
claim the government does not send them any money to
cover free drugs and supplies for diagnosis. Where the
drugs are supplied free of charge by the government, they
are most of the time out of stock in the health facilities.
These are challenges to the sustainability of CCMm.
Lack of drugs at the health facilities
Some of the health facilities that the CHWs refer their
clients to lacked anti-malarial drugs some of the times.
The CHWs indicated that lack of drugs in health facilities leads to lack of trust by community towards their
services. They assert that, they are not given drugs by
the health facilities to give to the clients and when they
refer clients to the health facilities too, there are no
drugs available to give to clients.
Also, the malaria test at the laboratory of the health facility is not free unlike the RDT test of the CHWs in the
community which the CHWs do not charge.
“...when you give someone a referral, they think that
they will also be given the medicine but when they get
to the hospital and find none, or they are told to buy
on their own they come back thinking you are the bad
guy.” CHW from FGD in Kisii.
“.....at times you give someone a referral note, they go
to the hospital thinking that they will be served for
free, but they get there and are tested with their own
money and when they are found positive, they are told
Boakye et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:1150 Page 4 of 8

again to go to the chemist and buy the medicine. So
they find it useless because they were not given any
medicine.” CHW from FGD in Kisii.
Lack of basic supplies and drugs at the disposal of the
CHWs
CHWs are challenged by the lack of basic supplies and
drugs to support their clients with. Particularly gloves,
malaria testing kits, bed nets and painkillers.
“Unfortunately they gave us the RDTs and little drugs but
no pain killers and gloves, and we are buying them for
our clients.” CHW from FGD in Enderege, Kisii County.
The CHWs also claim that sometimes a pack of RDT
is shared between 2 or more CHWs. Each pack also has
one buffer solution that is supposed to run the test.
Therefore sometimes they do have the RDTs but no buffer because the buffer solution might be with another
CHW who might be using it in a distant community.
Logistical support for the work of CHWs
CHWs reported a lack of the proper logistical support to
undertake their work. These include provision of essential protective clothing such as gumboots, umbrellas or
raincoats to walk through the rain to see their clients.
The CHWs are most times challenged to travel far distances to attend to some of their clients. Occasionally they
are forced to use their own money to hire bicycle services
that comes in the form of bicycle or motor bike “taxis”.
“....something like this bicycles, the homesteads are so
far, so when you receive a call it will force you to walk
if you do not have money and if you have money you
will use a “boda-boda” (bicycle taxi)” CHW from an
FGD in Chemelil, Kisumu County.
“There are times that it is raining and it is at night
and you have gone to a given place, you have to stand
there for a long times since you do not have an
umbrella and since you do not have gumboots it is
hard.” CHW from FGD in Kenyenya, Kisii County.
Challenges of female CHWs
Female CHWs also find it challenging attending to clients at night due to security risks of a lady walking alone
at night. Younger ladies were of the view that sometimes
some men pretend they are sick and call them to come
to their house. They are of the view that they face more
harzards than their male counterparts. But they reported
that in some areas of health such as reproductive health,
some ladies are more comfortable talking to them.
Inadequate community sensitization by health workers
Community members were not sensitized by the
health workers on role of the CHWs on testing for
malaria in the community, hence they faced difficulties at the initial stages.
“...we were given these RDTs and it was not announced
in the community and so it was upon us to let them
know that they we have the kits and so they need to be
tested before they go to the clinic.” CHW from FGD in
Kenyenya, Kisii County.
Inadequate stipend to meet basic needs
The CHWs find the stipend that they earn to be too little to sustain their basic needs. They are also weary of
the fact that this “small money” experiences delays before they could receive it.
“....even that 2000 is little money since it can
nowadays be compared with the money that people
who go for casual work can get in six days and
therefore if they can remunerate us better they should
think about it.” CHW from an FGD in Ojolla A,
Kisumu County.
“....the ‘soap’(stipend) should also not come so late and
we will be able to work well, like me I have four
villages it is a hard work and so if this stipend is
maintained at least you have a reason to work.” CHW
from FGD in Kisii.
Perception of the women/communities on CHWs
challenges
Lack of basic supplies and drugs
Women who have used the services of CHWs in the recent past cited the challenges faced by the CCMm as the
lack of basic supplies needed by the CHWs to undertake
their work such as malaria testing kits (RDT), anti-malaria
drugs, pain killers, gloves. This is even more critical in
some communities that public health facilities do not operate on weekends.
“ Their work is good and they need to be added drugs
since at times when you go to them they tell you that
they do not have the drug and sometimes it is even on
a Saturday and so for you to wait till Monday it will
be hard.” Expectant mother from an FGD in Osiri,
Kisumu east district.
Boakye et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:1150 Page 5 of 8

Suspicion by some community members of the services of
CHWs
The women from the communities felt that some CHWs
do not get support from all members of the community
due to suspicion. Some of the mothers asserted that if
the CHW is coming from a rival family then there is always suspicion that the CHW is coming to look for information. Others also think that CHWs could be up to
mischief since they also distribute free condoms in the
villages on reproductive health and HIV services which
not all community members subscribe to. All these affects uptake of their services. A case in point is when a
woman said her mother-in-law warned her not to entertain the CHW in the household compound again because the mother-in-law felt the CHW would bring
family planning pills to the woman. She said this was
based on suspicion.
Unfavourable weather conditions
The women felt that sometimes it becomes difficult for
the CHWs to access their clients especially during rainy
seasons whilst the CHWs lack the necessary equipment
like umbrellas, raincoat or boots to walk in the rain.
“.....you will call her but she will not come since she may
be coming from far and because you also do not want to
walk in the rain to her place you will just suffer.”
Expectant mother from an FGD in Kisumu West.
Discussion
This study assessed the challenges in achieving a sustainable CCMm in malaria-endemic districts in Kenya.
CCMm being undertaken by CHWs was found to be acceptable to the community members who showed a
good attitude to it although they initially did not
patronize the CCMm. They later identified and appreciated CCMm as a health service that brings health care
delivery closer to their doorstep and again helped them
to avoid long queues in the traditional health care settings. Community members equally liked the idea that
diagnosis and treatment of malaria by the CHWs were
free under CCMm. The acceptability of CHWs testing
malaria using RDTs and treating uncomplicated malaria
with ACT is consistent with previous studies [14–19].
It is interesting to know that community members
preferred to be attended to by CHW than to go to a
health facility to see a clinician when not well. This
may be due to the long queues, unnecessary delays,
lack of adequate attention and misconduct of some
clinicians that are encountered at health facilities.
They would rather see someone within their village
who will test and treat them as quickly as they can
so they go back to their homes.
The present study showed that CHWs have shown a
commitment to undertake CCMm and to do it correctly.
Other studies from other countries have also shown that
CHWs were able to correctly perform RDTs, and
showed high adherence to test results [5, 20]. These
prove that with proper training and supervision, CHWs
could be trusted to undertake CCMm in communities in
sub-Saharan Africa [21]. The fact that in different countries CHWs have also been accepted by community
members to undertake CCMm [22] shows that the
programme can be successful if implemented well. The
benefits of CCMm include prompt access to treatment
to especially under five children who bear the greatest
burden of the malaria disease.
For the CCMm programme to be sustainable, the
CHWs will have to be more motivated well since they are
the cornerstone for the implementation. Commodities
such as the RDTs and drugs needs to be available in the
health facilities so that CHWs can access them for their
community work. Health facilities in many sub-Saharan
African countries including Kenya, do experience
stock-out of commodities some of the time [23] and if this
gap could be bridged then it will also trickle down to the
CCMm programme to make it a success.
The programme cannot be successful if clinicians,
health facility-in-charges, and technicians are not part of
the implementation. There seems to be a disconnect between these categories of people in the health facilities
and the CHWs who are in the communities. The fact that
some of the clinicians and technicians in the health facilities shared the opinion that CHWs are not adequately
trained to handle patients diagnosis and treatment in the
community and are not supporting them tells the fact that
they might not be well informed enough of the training of
the CHWs and goal of the CCMm programme. However,
if healthcare workers are part of the training of CHWs
and the CHWs constantly get to be reviewed and supervised by these health care workers, they all could work in
harmony to implement CCMm.
The fear of many healthcare workers needs to be addressed. For instance, the clinicians fear that CHWs will
misuse drugs, over treat their clients which could lead to
drug resistance. CHWs might be tempted to treat everyone who presents with fever and who may test negative
for malaria with the RDTs. Malaria treatment is being
undertaken with powerful expensive ACT drugs [24]
and if these develop resistance in people, there are no
available drugs to replace them [12]. Therefore the concerns of the clinicians could be right and more training
needs to be organized for the CHWs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there are several challenges facing the implementation of the programme that needs to be
Boakye et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:1150 Page 6 of 8

addressed for the programme to be a success. The challenges raised here are also similar to many countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. Concerted efforts from governments
through the ministry of health, malaria control programmes, civil society organisations, health care workers
and communities are needed to boost the programme to
make it sustainable and to boost the morale of the
CHWs to sustain and retain their services to undertake
the programme.
