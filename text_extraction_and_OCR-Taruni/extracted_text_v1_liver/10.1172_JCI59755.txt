Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the predominant cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Toxicity begins with a reactive metabolite that binds to proteins. In rodents, this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and nuclear DNA fragmentation, resulting in necrotic cell death. While APAP metabolism is similar in
humans, the later events resulting in toxicity have not been investigated in patients. In this study, levels of
biomarkers of mitochondrial damage (glutamate dehydrogenase [GDH] and mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA])
and nuclear DNA fragments were measured in plasma from APAP-overdose patients. Overdose patients with
no or minimal hepatic injury who had normal liver function tests (LTs) (referred to herein as the normal LT
group) and healthy volunteers served as controls. Peak GDH activity and mtDNA concentration were increased
in plasma from patients with abnormal LT. Peak nuclear DNA fragmentation in the abnormal LT cohort was
also increased over that of controls. Parallel studies in mice revealed that these plasma biomarkers correlated
well with tissue injury. Caspase-3 activity and cleaved caspase-3 were not detectable in plasma from overdose
patients or mice, but were elevated after TNF-induced apoptosis, indicating that APAP overdose does not cause
apoptosis. Thus, our results suggest that mitochondrial damage and nuclear DNA fragmentation are likely to
be critical events in APAP hepatotoxicity in humans, resulting in necrotic cell death.
Introduction
Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the best-selling analgesics in the 
US (1–3) and one of the most popular drugs in the world. Although 
it is safe at therapeutic doses, overdose of APAP can cause severe 
liver injury. The first reports of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans 
appeared in the literature in the 1960s (4). Since that time, APAP 
overdose has become the most common cause of acute liver failure 
in most Western countries (5–8). In the US alone, misuse of APAP 
is responsible for about 56,000 emergency room visits, 26,000 hospitalizations, and nearly 500 deaths each year (5, 9). Approximately 
half of these cases are the result of intentional overdosing, with 
higher proportions in other countries. These patients typically 
present to the emergency department at the start or near the peak 
of injury, with rapidly increasing liver enzymes in plasma.
Over the last 4 decades, considerable progress has been made in 
rodent models toward understanding the mechanisms of APAP 
hepatotoxicity. The majority of a therapeutic dose (>90%) of APAP 
is glucuronidated or sulfated and then excreted. A small percentage is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) to the reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which 
is readily detoxified by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) (10). 
From rodent studies, we know that much higher doses saturate the 
glucuronidation and sulfation pathways, resulting in formation 
of excess NAPQI. The additional reactive metabolite depletes liver 
GSH and binds to proteins (11–14). Ultrastructural and biochemical studies demonstrated that toxic doses of APAP could cause 
changes in the morphology and function of liver mitochondria (15, 
16). While it was clear from these data that mitochondrial injury 
occurs after treatment with large doses of APAP, it was not known 
how this developed. Important insight came from 2 sources. 
First, a comparison of APAP and the nonhepatotoxic regioisomer 
3′-hydroxyacetanilide, which can also bind to proteins, revealed that 
APAP binds more frequently to mitochondrial proteins (17). Second, it was found that APAP treatment could cause mitochondrial 
oxidative stress in mice (18). This suggested that NAPQI binding to 
mitochondrial proteins leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress. It is 
now known that this causes the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) pore opening (19–21), matrix swelling, and 
outer membrane lysis in rodent models (15). The permeabilization 
and lysis result in the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and 
endonuclease G (EndoG) from mitochondria. These endonucleases 
translocate to nuclei and cause nuclear DNA fragmentation (22). 
Proapoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, 
are also released. However, there is no activation of caspases, and 
caspase inhibitors do not protect against APAP toxicity (23–25). 
Most likely, ATP depletion prevents activation of the effector caspase-3 by the apoptosome. The end result is centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis and liver failure (4, 23).
In contrast to rodents, understanding of the mechanisms of 
APAP hepatotoxicity in humans is limited. There is evidence for

a stress on the hepatic GSH pool after APAP exposure (26, 27). 
In addition, APAP protein adducts are present in plasma after 
APAP overdose (28, 29). These data indicate that metabolic activation and protein adduct formation occur in humans in a manner 
similar to what has been described in rodents. However, the later 
events, including mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA fragmentation, 
and mode of cell death have not been investigated in the clinic. 
Although studies using the metabolically competent human liver 
cell line HepaRG provided evidence that the mechanisms of injury 
in human hepatocytes are similar to those in rodent models (25), 
cell lines may not reflect in vivo mechanisms.
Currently, the only effective therapy for APAP overdose is GSH 
replacement in order to scavenge NAPQI, which is accomplished 
with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and other sulfhydryl donors. However, NAC needs to be given within 12 to 24 hours of APAP ingestion. Patients presenting later may benefit from increased metabolic flux (30), but the likelihood of a positive outcome is notably 
decreased (31). A better understanding of the later events in human 
APAP toxicity may lead to the development of more effective interventions for late-presenting patients. Therefore the purpose of this 
study was to gain further insight into the mechanisms of APAPinduced liver injury in humans by investigating whether or not 
mitochondrial injury and nuclear DNA fragmentation occur as 
part of the mechanism of toxicity. In addition, we sought direct evidence for caspase activation in overdose patients, as there are somewhat conflicting data regarding the relevance of caspase-dependent 
apoptosis in the pathophysiology based on the caspase-dependent 
cleavage of cytokeratin-18 (K18) (32, 33). We hypothesized that, if 
mitochondrial injury and nuclear DNA fragmentation occur, mitochondrial contents and DNA fragments lost into the cytosol as a 
result of the MPT, mitochondrial lysis, and DNA fragmentation 
should be detectable in plasma when the cells become necrotic. 
Furthermore, if relevant apoptotic cell death should occur, active 
fragments of caspase-3 and increased caspase-3 enzyme activity 
should be detectable in plasma of APAP-overdose patients.
Results
Study design and patient information. Samples from 40 patients were 
used in this study: 20 patients with maximum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1,000 U/l or more and maximum prothrombin time 
(PT) of 18 s or more (abnormal liver function test [LT] group) and 
20 with maximum ALT of less than 1,000 U/l and maximum PT of 
less than 18 s (defined as the normal LT group), the latter group 
having no or minimal hepatic injury. Blood samples were obtained 
from 6 volunteers as healthy controls. For the abnormal LT cohort, 
the mean age was 38 years, with a range from 19 to 65 (Table 1). The 
percentage of male and female patients in the cohorts with normal 
and abnormal LTs was similar (70% females vs. 65% females, respectively). The average peak ALT value for the group with elevated LT 
values was 5,330 ± 562 U/l. Among these 20 patients, 1 did not survive. The remaining patients survived without liver transplant. For 
the normal LT cohort, the mean age was 29 years, with a range from 
18 to 56. Survival in this group was 100%. The healthy volunteer 
group was matched to these 2 cohorts, 66% females with a mean age 
of 36 and a range of 23 to 51 (Table 1). Interestingly, average serum 
APAP levels in the normal LT group were markedly higher than in 
the abnormal LT group. This is likely because many of the patients 
in this group presented earlier, before extensive APAP metabolism. 
Earlier admission and treatment would explain why these patients 
did not develop signs of liver injury.
Glutamate dehydrogenase activity in plasma from overdose patients. 
We reasoned that, if mitochondrial injury occurs in humans as it 
does in rodents, mitochondrial contents released into the cytosol 
after the MPT and mitochondrial membrane lysis should become 
detectable in the plasma of the injured patients after cells become 
necrotic. With this in mind, we measured the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the plasma 
obtained from each cohort. The GDHs are enzymes of the mitochondrial matrix that are highly expressed in the liver (34). These 
enzymes catalyze the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to l-glutamate 
using NADH and NH4
+. We observed clear increases in GDH activity over time in patients with abnormal LTs (Figure 1, A–C). The 
average GDH activities were 22 ± 7, 10 ± 3, and 552 ± 113 U/l for 
healthy volunteers, the normal LT group, and the abnormal LT 
group, respectively (Figure 1D). Additionally, the average increase 
in GDH activity in patients with abnormal LTs correlated with the 
rise in ALT values (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.45; P < 0.05) (Figure 1, 
E and F). Although the average PT values (59.2 s) in patients with 
liver injury (high ALT) were almost 4 times higher than in patients 
with no relevant ALT increase (15.3 s), there was no significant correlation between peak GDH activity and PT values in the abnormal 
LT group (data not shown).

Mitochondrial DNA in plasma from overdose patients. Mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) has been shown to be released into circulation 
after hemorrhagic shock in rats (35) and other physical trauma 
in humans (36). In addition to serving as another marker of mitochondrial injury, mtDNA appears to act as a damage-associated 
molecular pattern (DAMP) capable of activating neutrophils and 
other cells of the innate immune system via TLRs (35–38). To 
determine whether or not APAP hepatotoxicity leads to release of 
mtDNA into circulation in humans, mtDNA concentrations were 
determined in the plasma of these patients using absolute quantification real-time PCR. Primers were designed for subunits of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and complex III (cytochrome c oxidase) of the electron transport chain, which are exclusively encoded 
in mtDNA (39). The concentration of mtDNA in the plasma of 
overdose patients with abnormal liver function increased over 
time (Figure 2, A and B), and peak levels correlated with peak ALT 
(Pearson’s coefficient = 0.54, P < 0.02) (Figure 2C). While mtDNA 
was nearly undetectable in plasma from healthy volunteers and 
the normal LT group, the average peak mtDNA concentration was 
45 ± 15 ng/ml in plasma from patients with injury (Figure 2D). 
Again, despite the correlation with ALT, there was no significant 
correlation between mtDNA and PT values in the group with the 
abnormal LT (data not shown).
Nuclear DNA fragmentation in plasma from overdose patients. Nuclear 
DNA fragmentation has been demonstrated in mice following treatment with toxic doses of APAP and is important in the mechanism 
of hepatotoxicity in those animals (22, 40). Moreover, because the 
endonucleases responsible for nuclear DNA fragmentation come 
from the mitochondrial intermembrane space during mitochondrial dysfunction (22), nuclear DNA fragmentation can be considered an additional indirect marker of mitochondrial dysfunction. 
We observed an increase in nuclear DNA fragments in plasma over 
time in the patients of the abnormal LT group using an antihistone 
ELISA with an anti-DNA secondary antibody (Figure 3). Again, this 
closely followed ALT activity (Figure 3, A–C). Together with the 
GDH and mtDNA data, these results provide evidence for release of 
mitochondrial contents and nuclear DNA fragments into the cytosol with subsequent release into peripheral blood after cell death.

ity in rodents is oncotic necrosis (41). To determine whether or not 
apoptosis could be involved in the pathophysiology in humans, 
caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 protein levels were measured in 
plasma. In the normal LT group, no caspase-3 activity or caspase-3 
protein was detectable (Figure 4, A and B). In patients with APAPinduced liver injury, pro–caspase-3 was clearly present in plasma 
(Figure 4A), but neither the active, low–molecular weight fragments nor an increase in enzyme activity was detectable (Figure 4, 
A and B). Similar to these findings in patients, no caspase-3 protein 
was observed in plasma of control mice. APAP-induced liver injury 
resulted in the selective appearance of the proenzyme in plasma 
(Figure 4A), but again no low–molecular weight forms could be 
seen. In contrast, mice treated with galactosamine and endotoxin (G/E) as a positive control for apoptosis not only had detectable pro–caspase-3 in plasma, but also an active fragment (Figure 4A). Consistent with this observation, substantial caspase-3 
enzyme activity was present (Figure 4B). Thus, if there is relevant 
apoptotic cell death in the liver, as after G/E treatment (42), both 
caspase-3 enzyme activity and active caspase-3 fragments are 
found in plasma. The absence of these parameters in human and 
mouse plasma after APAP overdose suggests that apoptosis is not 
a relevant mechanism of cell death.
Release of mitochondrial markers is not a secondary effect of cell necrosis. 
It is possible that mitochondria and mitochondrial contents 
will be released into blood and become detectable in plasma as a 
result of oncotic necrosis. To verify that high levels of GDH and 
mtDNA in plasma reflect the mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity and are not merely a secondary effect of oncotic cell death, 
these parameters were measured in a model of liver necrosis not 
thought to involve mitochondria. Furosemide is a loop diuretic 
prescribed for cases of hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
At high doses, furosemide can cause liver injury without affecting 
mitochondrial function (43). Mice treated with this drug had a 
significant increase in ALT activity in serum at 24 hours (Figure 
5A), with centrilobular necrosis similar to APAP-induced injury 
(Figure 6). Although there was a minor increase in GDH activity 
over controls at this time point, the difference was not statistically 
significant (Figure 5A). Similarly, serum mtDNA concentrations 
were only slightly elevated compared with the extensive increase in 
APAP-treated mice (Figure 5B). These data indicate that high levels 
of plasma GDH and mtDNA are indicative of the mechanism of 
APAP toxicity and are not simply a result of tissue necrosis.
Plasma biomarkers and tissue correlation. Because no liver biopsy 
samples can be obtained from patients during the early phase of 
liver injury after APAP overdose, we had to rely on plasma biomarkers. To test how well plasma biomarkers reflect events in the tissue, 
mice were treated with 300 mg/kg APAP. Blood and livers were collected at several time points, and plasma biomarkers were assayed. 
Liver histology revealed a close correlation between the development of areas of necrosis in the tissue and the time course of ALT 
activity in plasma (Figure 7, A and B). Similarly, TUNEL staining 
(for DNA fragmentation) in tissue sections was followed closely by 
the rise in nuclear DNA fragments in mouse plasma (Figure 7, C 
and D). These data show that plasma biomarkers accurately reflect 
events in the tissue injury after APAP overdose in mice. It seems 
reasonable to assume that the same relationship between plasma 
biomarkers and tissue exists in patients.
Discussion
The objective of this investigation was to gain further insight into 
the intracellular mechanisms of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans 
and to assess the mode of cell death. Because there is no diagnostic 
benefit that would justify the risk of a liver biopsy during the early 
injury phase after APAP overdose, our approach was to use plasma 
biomarkers, validated in a mouse model, to obtain reliable mechanistic information. We studied 3 groups of patients. In addition to 
an age- and sex-matched control group, APAP-overdose patients 
were divided into 2 groups: one with evidence of liver injury (peak

plasma ALT activities ≥ 1,000 U/l and peak PT ≥ 18 s) and one with 
no or very limited liver injury (PT < 18 s and ALT < 1,000 U/l; highest: 17.5 s and 158 U/l, respectively). The low injury in this group was 
likely due, in part, to early admission and treatment prior to development of toxicity. This would be consistent with the higher plasma 
APAP levels on admission in the group with normal LTs. Additionally, some of these patients may have taken lower overdoses.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and APAP hepatotoxicity. Mitochondrial dysfunction after toxic doses of APAP has been recognized in rodents 
since the 1980s, when inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and 
depletion of ATP were first described (15, 16, 44). More recent studies have shown the development of oxidative and nitrosative stress 
within mitochondria and occurrence of the mitochondrial MPT 
after APAP treatment (18–21). Using a human cell line with high 
expression levels of CYP (HepaRG), mitochondrial dysfunction has 
also been shown to occur in cultured human hepatocytes (25). We 
reasoned that, if mitochondrial membrane integrity is compromised 
and mitochondrial contents leak into the cytosol in patients, these 
mitochondrial components must be released into the circulation 
when the hepatocytes become necrotic. Our data showing the presence of the specific mitochondrial components GDH and mtDNA 
in plasma of patients with highly elevated ALT levels provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in humans after 
APAP overdose. The high activity of GDH in the plasma from these 
patients is consistent with the higher GDH expression in zone 3 
of the liver (34), where APAP causes the greatest tissue injury.

The assumption behind these mechanistic conclusions is that 
GDH and mtDNA release occurs only when mitochondrial damage is involved, not just cell injury. This hypothesis was confirmed 
by demonstrating that liver cell damage caused by furosemide, a 
hepatotoxicant not believed to affect mitochondria (43), resulted 
in ALT release, but not a statistically significant increase in either 
mtDNA or GDH in mouse plasma. In contrast, APAP overdose 
triggers release of both ALT and large amounts of GDH and 
mtDNA into the plasma of mice. Thus, it is justified to conclude 
that APAP-induced liver injury in humans involves mitochondrial 
damage. The time course of the release of GDH and mtDNA correlated well with the appearance of ALT in plasma of all patients, 
suggesting that mitochondrial damage may be closely related to 
cell necrosis. In experimental animals, interventions that restored 
the scavenging capacity for ROS and peroxynitrite in mitochondria (30, 45–47) or prevented the MPT (19–21) protected against 
APAP-induced liver injury. In addition, selective impairment of 
mitochondrial antioxidant defenses (partial MnSOD deficiency) 
aggravated APAP hepatotoxicity (48). Moreover, mitochondrial 
dysfunction and oxidant stress preceded cell necrosis by several 
hours in murine hepatocytes and in human HepaRG cells (25, 
49). Thus, mitochondrial damage is central to APAP-induced cell 
death in murine models and in a human hepatocyte cell line (19, 
21, 25, 49, 50). Based on the close correlation between release of 
biomarkers of mitochondrial damage and cell necrosis, it is likely 
that mitochondrial dysfunction is a main determinant of liver cell 
damage in APAP-overdose patients. However, despite these close 
correlations, our data do not establish that mitochondrial damage 
is the cause of cell death in humans.
Nuclear DNA damage and APAP hepatotoxicity. In addition to the 
biomarkers of mitochondrial damage, nuclear DNA fragments 
were detectable in plasma of patients with severe APAP-induced 
liver injury. The assay for DNA fragments is based on detection of 
nuclear histones, which are not present in mtDNA (39). Thus, the 
antihistone ELISA measures specifically nuclear DNA fragments. 
No plasma DNA fragments were detectable in healthy volunteers 
or in patients without severe liver injury. In contrast, the time 
course of plasma DNA fragment levels in patients with liver injury 
closely followed the release of ALT, i.e., cell necrosis. A comparison 
of plasma DNA fragments and nuclear DNA damage in mouse 
liver after APAP overdose revealed that both parameters correlate 
with ALT release, suggesting that nuclear DNA damage occurs 
along with cell death.
Previous studies in rodents documented that DNA fragments 
after APAP are indistinguishable from apoptotic DNA fragments 
(40, 51). In addition, no nitrotyrosine residues were detectable in 
the nucleus (51). This indicated that DNA damage was not caused 
by oxidant stress or peroxynitrite formation, but involved endonucleases. Because of the lack of relevant caspase activation during APAP hepatotoxicity (23, 52), the traditional caspase-activated 
DNase can be excluded. Instead, EndoG and AIF are released from 
the mitochondrial intermembrane space and translocate to the 
nucleus during APAP-induced cell death (22). Protection against 
mitochondrial oxidant stress or prevention of the MPT eliminated 
nuclear DNA fragmentation (21, 49, 51). In a later study, the Bcl-2 
family member Bax, which forms pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane during the early phase after APAP exposure, was 
found to facilitate release of EndoG and AIF from mitochondria

Release of GDH and mtDNA into blood is not a secondary effect of 
necrosis. Mice were treated with APAP or furosemide (FS) to cause

and nuclear translocation, which triggered the initial DNA damage (53). Partial AIF deficiency reduced the mitochondrial oxidant 
stress, nuclear translocation of AIF, and DNA fragmentation 
(54). There is also evidence that a general endonuclease inhibitor 
attenuated APAP-induced cell death (55). Together, these findings 
indicate that nuclear DNA damage is dependent on mitochondrial 
dysfunction and the release of endonucleases from the intermembrane space. Thus, nuclear DNA damage is closely related and 
even contributes to liver cell death in the murine model. Given the 
similar appearance of nuclear DNA in patients with APAP-induced 
liver injury, it is likely that the same mechanisms of DNA damage 
apply in human liver.
DNA as DAMP. Our data indicate that nuclear DNA fragments 
and mtDNA are released into the plasma of patients and in mice 
after APAP overdose. These molecules can act as DAMPs through 
activation of TLRs, especially TLR9, to induce cytokine formation 
after APAP (56). In the mouse model, there is extensive formation 
of proinflammatory mediators and recruitment of neutrophils 
into the liver in response to APAP overdose (57). However, the preponderance of the experimental evidence argues against a relevant 
contribution of neutrophils to the injury process (58). Consistent 
with these findings, neutrophils isolated from the injured liver or 
from the blood are not activated during the main injury phase of 
APAP hepatotoxicity in mice (59). Preliminary data for neutrophil 
activation in APAP-overdose patients appear to confirm the lack of 
neutrophil activation during the injury phase, but show a progressive activation at later time points (C.D. Williams and H. Jaeschke, 
unpublished observations). Thus, it is likely that in patients, the 
release of DAMPs, such as nuclear DNA fragments and mtDNA 
during the injury phase, contributes to activation of innate immune 
cells, which are involved in the removal of necrotic cell debris and 
thus contribute to the recovery as observed in mice (58).
Mode of APAP-induced cell death in patients. It is generally accepted 
that the mode of APAP-induced liver cell death in mice is oncotic 
necrosis. This is based on morphological evidence (cell swelling, 
vacuolization, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis), the massive release of 
cell contents (ALT), and the resulting inflammation (23). However, 
there is limited evidence of apoptosis. Hallmarks of apoptotic cell 
death include several morphological features, such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies 
as well as extensive caspase activation (60). In general, only very few 
apoptotic cells are detectable after APAP overdose (23), and there is 
no relevant caspase activation in mouse livers (23, 52, 61). Furthermore, pancaspase inhibitor did not protect against APAP hepatotoxicity (23–25, 52, 62, 63). However, most of these experiments 
were done with overnight-fasted animals. Recently, it was suggested 
that in fed mice with higher cellular ATP content, APAP causes 
limited caspase activation and some apoptotic cell death (62). 
This conclusion was also based on the detection of a K18 cleavage product, which is thought to be specific for caspase-3 activity 
(62). The use of this assay has resulted in conflicting data in the 
clinical literature. A case report showed no significant increase of 
the cleavage product over the time course of injury and recovery 
of an APAP-overdose patient (64). In contrast, 2 studies found significant increases of this caspase cleavage product in APAP-overdose patients (32, 33). However, as noted by Volkmann et al. (33), 
necrotic full-length K18 was the dominant form, suggesting that 
apoptosis plays a relatively minor part in the mechanism of cell 
death after APAP overdose in humans. Our data directly analyzing

blotting did not reveal any evidence for caspase-3 activation in 
these patients. However, in the overdose patients with extensive 
liver injury, pro–caspase-3 protein was present in plasma, reflecting the release of cell contents of necrotic cells. These clinical data 
are similar to our observations in APAP-treated mice, which had 
an increase in plasma pro–caspase-3 levels, but no active fragments 
and no increase in enzyme activity. In contrast, in the G/E model, 
which is a positive control for caspase-dependent apoptosis in 
hepatocytes (42), extensive caspase-3 activity and the active fragment of caspase-3 were clearly detectable. In a similar experiment, 
caspase-3 activity was readily detectable in plasma after galactosamine-induced apoptosis in rat liver despite the fact that only 
5%–6% of hepatocytes were apoptotic (65). Based on these experiments, it can be concluded that the absence of active caspase-3 
fragments and of detectable caspase-3 activity in plasma of APAPoverdose patients with severe liver injury suggests that apoptotic 
cell death is not relevant for the overall pathophysiology. The discrepancy between the detection of minor levels of caspase-dependent K18 cleavage product in some studies (32, 33) and our lack 
of direct plasma caspase-3 activity measurement in APAP patients 
requires further study. This could be related to differences in assay 
sensitivity or potentially even specificity, i.e., K18 could be cleaved 
by other proteases. However, there is principal agreement among 
all studies that necrotic cell death is dominant in these patients.
Currently, much emphasis is placed upon the development of 
novel biomarkers to aid in both the diagnosis and prognosis of various liver diseases. It is possible that mitochondrial markers such as 
GDH and mtDNA can also predict outcome. In this study, only one 
patient did not survive, and none received a liver transplant. With 
these numbers, we are unable to assess the prognostic value of these 
biomarkers. Larger cohorts will be needed to determine whether or 
not these biomarkers are predictive of patient outcome.
In summary, our data demonstrated the release of biomarkers 
reflecting mitochondrial damage and nuclear DNA fragmentation 
in patients with severe APAP-induced liver injury. These events led to 
predominantly necrotic cell death. The use of these biomarkers and 
the mechanistic conclusions were extensively validated by parallel 
studies in mice in which tissue injury and the release of these markers were measured. Our findings provide strong support for the 
hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage are 
critical events in the mechanism of cell necrosis after APAP overdose 
in patients. In addition, these data confirm that the in vivo mouse 
model, primary murine hepatocytes, and human HepaRG cells are 
appropriate experimental systems to study cell death mechanisms 
that appear to be relevant for APAP-overdose patients.
Methods
Patient selection. Patients admitted to the University of Kansas Hospital or to 
the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center following APAP overdose were 
studied prospectively. The study design and protocol were approved by the 
respective institutional review boards (IRB), with regular follow-up assessment. Patients presented to the emergency department or were admitted 
to the intensive care unit with evidence of APAP overdose. The diagnosis 
was made by a physician on site, and all participants were required to sign 
a consent form. The patient population included both acute- and chronicoverdose patients. Whereas all patients in the normal LT group were acuteoverdose cases, 5 out of 20 patients in the group with abnormal LTs took 
repeated doses in excess of the maximum recommended therapeutic dose 
of 4 g/d over multiple days. The inclusion criteria were patient-reported history of APAP overdose, high-serum APAP levels, and abnormal LTs (based 
on ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], PT, bilirubin). All of the participants fulfilled at least 2 of these criteria. Each patient’s blood and/or urine 
was subjected to a toxicology screen: in addition to APAP, various levels of 
ethanol, cocaine, antidepressants, or other drugs were detected in some 
patients. However, there was no medication found besides APAP that could 
have acutely caused severe liver injury. Patients were excluded if there was 
reasonable evidence for liver injury due to another cause (i.e., viral hepatitis, ischemic liver, etc.) All overdose patients received standard of care NAC 
treatment. For each individual, age and sex were recorded. APAP, ALT, AST, 
PT, creatinine, and total bilirubin levels in serum were monitored.
Animal studies. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratory and housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 
12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. 
For APAP treatment, mice were fasted overnight before receiving an i.p. 
injection of 300 mg/kg APAP in warm 0.9% saline. Other animals fed ad 
libitum were treated i.p. with 400 mg/kg furosemide dissolved in warm 
phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5–8.0, without fasting. As positive controls for caspase-3 activation, some fed mice received 700 mg/kg galactosamine and 100 μg/kg endotoxin to induce hepatocellular apoptosis. All 
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. At the indicated times, 
animals were killed by cervical dislocation. After blood collection, serum 
was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000–20,000 g for 15–20 minutes. Livers were excised, and small sections were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered 
formalin for histological analysis.
Clinical assays. ALT levels in serum were measured in the hospital and 
later confirmed in our laboratory using an ALT kit (Pointe Scientific). 
AST, coagulation parameters, and bilirubin were also measured on site 
using standard protocols.
GDH activity. GDH activity was determined using a modified version of 
the method of Passonneau and Lowry (66). Briefly, aliquots of 10–100 μl 
plasma were mixed in 700 μl of 200 mM imidazole buffer with 25 mM 
ammonium acetate, 200 μM NADH, 100 μM ADP, and 0.05% bovine serum 
albumin, pH 8.0. The disappearance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm to 
obtain a baseline reading, and then 50 μl of a 2 mM α-ketoglutarate solution was added to begin the GDH reaction. The baseline activity was then 
subtracted from the GDH activity.
DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation was measured using an antihistone ELISA with an anti-DNA secondary antibody, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). In addition, liver sections were stained with 
H&E for evaluation of necrosis and with TUNEL in situ cell death assay 
(Roche) for visualization of DNA strand breaks as previously described (23).
Caspase activation. Pro–caspase-3 processing was assessed by Western blotting with a single antibody, cross-reactive with both human and mouse caspase-3 (Cell Signaling). Caspase activity was measured as Z-VAD-FMK–inhibitable cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC, as described (42).
MtDNA. mtDNA was measured by absolute quantification real-time PCR, 
as described (36). Total DNA was isolated from plasma samples using a 
QIAamp Blood and Mini Kit (QIAGEN), which removes plasma components 
with the potential to interfere in PCR analysis. The samples were then diluted, 
and the same amount of total DNA was added to each reaction on each 
plate. mtDNA was determined using 2 pairs of human primers, 1 for human 
NADH dehydrogenase (forward 5′-ATACCCATGGCCAACCTCCT-3′
and reverse 5′-GGGCCTTTGCGTAGTTGTAT-3′) and 1 for human cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (forward 5′-ATGACCCACCAATCACATGC-3′
and reverse 5′-ATCACATGGCTAGGCCGGAG-3′). For mice, another 2 
primer pairs were designed: mouse NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (forward 5′-CACACAAACATAACCACTTTAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTAGGTCAATGAATGAGTGGTT-3′) and mouse cytochrome c oxidase subunit III 
(5′-ACCAAGGCCACCACACTCCT-3′ and 5′ACGCTCAGAAGAATCCTGCAAAGAA-3′). To construct standard curves, mitochondrial pellets were

isolated from either human hepatoma cells (HepaRG) or mouse liver by 
differential centrifugation. Purity of mtDNA standards was verified by realtime PCR using primers for both mitochondrial genes and nuclear-encoded 
β-actin. Dilutions of these purified mtDNA samples were prepared and 
standards were included on each PCR plate for each gene tested. The limit 
of detection for the assay was determined to be less than 0.05 ng/ml.
Statistics. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality. To test for 
statistical significance, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance 
was used for the nonnormally distributed patient data, followed by Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons to test significance between groups. Unpaired 
2-tailed Student’s t test was used to assess significance between values from 
control and experimental animals within treated groups. To test for correlation between 2 parameters in patient plasma, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated. For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. The study design was approved by the IRBs of the 
University of Kansas Medical Center and the Banner Good Samaritan 
Medical Center. Signed consent was required for all study participants. 
All experimental protocols for the mouse experiments were approved by 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of 
Kansas Medical Center.
