Purpose: To determine whether red blood cell (RBC) or plasma
transfusion is associated with the one-year survival rate variation
previously detected in liver transplantation. 
Methods: A retrospective study of 206 consecutive liver transplantations was undertaken. Intraoperative transfusions of blood
products were identified. Twenty-seven variables were studied
using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that
were associated significantly with survival rate. For analysis of oneyear survival, the cases were studied according to the transfused
blood products. Patients were stratified according to the degree of
RBC and plasma transfusion into four groups: more than four units
of RBC, one to four units of RBC, plasma transfusion only, and no
plasma or RBC transfusions.
Results: Patients received an average of 2.8 ± 3.5 units of RBC
and 4.1 ± 4.1 units of plasma. Thirty-two percent of the patients
did not receive any RBC transfusion and 19.4% did not receive any
blood products. The one-year survival rate was 81.9% for all
patients and 97.4% for patients without any transfusions. Of the 27
variables evaluated, only RBC and plasma transfusions were associated with significant decrease in the one-year survival rate, which
was seen in the group who received only plasma (76.9%, P =
0.014) and the group who received more than four units of RBC
(62.5%, P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: Although we cannot demonstrate causality, our
analysis shows that our one-year survival rate following liver transplantation decreased significantly with the intraoperative transfusion
of any amount of plasma or more than four units of RBC.
Objectif : Déterminer si la transfusion de globules rouges (GR) ou de
plasma est associée à la variation du taux de survie d’un an déjà
détectée pour une transplantation hépatique.
Méthode: Une étude rétrospective de 206 transplantations hépatiques consécutives a été menée. Les transfusions peropératoires de
produits sanguins ont été recensées. Nous avons étudié 27 variables
par des d’analyses à une ou plusieurs variables pour repérer les facteurs associés de façon significative au taux de survie. Pour l’analyse
du taux de survie d’un an a été faite selon les produits sanguins transfusés. Les patients ont été stratifiés en quatre groupes d’après le degré
de transfusion de GR et de plasma : plus de quatre unités de GR, de
une à quatre unités, transfusion de plasma seulement et aucune
transfusion.
Résultats: Les patients ont reçu en moyenne 2,8 ± 3,5 unités de GR
et 4,1 ± 4,1 unités de plasma. Trente-deux pour cent n’ont reçu
aucune transfusion de GR et 19,4 % aucun produit sanguin. Le taux
de survie d’un an a été de 81,9 % pour tous les patients et de 
97,4 % pour ceux qui n’ont eu aucune transfusion. Des 27 variables
évaluées, seules les transfusions de Gr et de plasma ont été associées
à une baisse significative du taux de survie d’un an, notée chez les
patients qui ont reçu du plasma seulement (76,9 %, P = 0,014) ou
plus de quatre unités de GR (62,5 %, P < 0,0001).
Conclusion : Sans pouvoir établir de causalité, notre analyse montre
que le taux de survie d’un an après une transplantation hépatique
diminue significativement avec la transfusion peropératoire de toute
quantité de plasma ou de plus de quatre unités de GR.

Massicotte et al.: TRANSFUSION AND SURVIVAL 149
IVER transplantation is a surgical procedure that can be associated with massive
blood loss and the need for allogenic blood
product transfusion.1–4 Transfusion may
contribute to morbidity and mortality.5–9
Improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques
have decreased the number of blood products transfused.5–11 Cacciarelli et al.5 and Ramos et al.
9 reported
a decrease of the one-year survival rate associated with
intraoperative transfusion of more than four or six
units of red blood cells (RBC) respectively.
The St-Luc Hospital of the Centre Hospitalier de
l’Université de Montréal (CHUM) performs more
than 50 liver transplantations annually. The purpose of
this study was to assess the relationship between oneyear survival rate and intraoperative RBC or plasma
transfusion. 
Methods
With the approval of the CHUM Ethics Committee,
a retrospective study was undertaken of all liver transplantations performed between 1998 and 2002.
Surgery
Four surgeons were involved during the study period.
Two of these surgeons were present during each transplant procedure. The different transplantation procedures were all similar. Neither veno-venous shunts nor
any piggyback technique were utilized. All livers were
from ABO-Rh compatible, cadaveric donors and there
were no reduced-sized grafts.
Anesthesia
Twelve anesthesiologists participated in the liver transplant team. In all cases, vascular access and invasive
and non-invasive monitoring techniques were identical. The anesthetics were comparable. Induction consisted of propofol, sufentanil or fentanyl as the narcotic of choice, and usually rocuronium as the muscle
relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with either isoflurane or desflurane in oxygen. There was no standardized protocol pertaining to blood product transfusion.
All the transfused RBC and plasma were ABO-Rh
compatible. The decision to transfuse was an individual one based on the measured hemoglobin (Hb) level
and the evaluation of the ongoing blood loss.
Aprotinin was given to every patient according to the
Hammersmith protocol except in patients with BuddChiari syndrome. Isovolemic hemodilution was not
used. A cell saver device was used in one patient. The
main laboratory test used was arterial blood gas analysis, which also included Hb, potassium, and ionized
calcium levels. The arterial blood gas analyses were
done on an "as needed" basis dictated by the clinical
situation. All these tests were done in the hospital’s
central biochemical testing facilities.
Statistical analysis
Twenty-seven variables (Tables I–III) were analyzed
by univariate and multivariate methods. Patients were
divided into four groups (more than four units of
RBC, one to four units of RBC, plasma only, no blood
products) to analyze the influence of RBC transfusion
practice on patient survival based upon the same parameters used by the Stanford group.5 The influence of
plasma transfusion on patient survival was analyzed by
stratifying the patients into four plasma transfusion
groups: no blood products, RBC only, one to four
units of plasma, and more than four units of plasma.
Distributions were examined to ensure proper statistical evaluation. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were used as appropriate. For the
univariate analysis, continuous variables were also analyzed as categorical variables using the median and the

Results
Demographic and perioperative data for 206 cases are
presented in Tables I and II. No transplant patients
were excluded from the study. Patient’s age ranged
from 17 to 68 yr. Two hundred and six liver transplantations were performed on 193 patients. Ten
patients had two liver transplantations and one patient
required four transplantations. Four patients had a
previous liver transplantation before the study period.
Patients received an average 2.8 ± 3.5 units of RBC
(median 2.0 units, maximum 25 units) and an average
of 4.1 ± 4.1 units of plasma (median 4.0 units, maximum 24 units). Cryoprecipitate was not used; platelets
and albumin were rarely given (Table II). A time-based
review of laboratory data showed that intraoperative
RBC transfusions were started when the average Hb
level was 68.2 ± 12.8 g·L–1 and the final Hb value was
87.3 ± 13.9 g·L–1. Analysis of the pattern of transfusion
practice revealed that 43 patients (20.9%) received
more than four units of RBC, 97 patients (47.1%)
received between one and four units of RBC, 26
patients (12.6%) received only plasma, and 40 patients
(19.4%) received no blood products (Table I). Sixty-six
patients (32.0 %) did not receive any RBC.
Survival
There were no intraoperative deaths. The overall oneyear survival rate was 81.9%. Four of the deceased
patients had received two liver transplantations each.
Mortality was mostly due to multiple organ failure at
a mean of 31 ± 24 days post-transplantation.
Univariate analyses (Table III) showed that three
variables were associated significantly with the one-year
survival rate: the number of RBC units transfused (P =
0.002), the number of plasma units transfused (P =
0.002), and the length of surgery (P = 0.023). The
association between RBC or plasma transfusion and
one-year survival rate was significant whether the independent variables were studied as categories (mean,
median, or subgroups of RBC and plasma (low vs high)
transfusion) or as continuous variables. These three
variables were entered as continuous and categorical
variables in a logistic regression model. Increased RBC
or plasma transfusions were associated with decreased
survival. However, the colinearity was too strong for
these variables to be analyzed separately hence we created a new variable, low vs high transfusion. Table IV
summarizes the logistic regression model. Although
identified as a confounding variable, multivariate analysis showed that the length of surgery did not modify the
relationship between the survival rate and RBC or plasma transfusion. All other study variables did not influence the one-year survival rate (Table III).
Analysis of the four RBC transfusion groups
revealed the following results (Table II). One-year
survival in patients receiving no blood products was
97.4%. In comparison, the one-year survival rate
declined to 86.6% when one to four units of RBC
were transfused, 76.9% with plasma transfusion only
(P = 0.014), and a nadir of 62.5% when more than
four units of RBC were transfused (P < 0.0001).
Analysis of the pattern of plasma administration
revealed that 40 patients received no blood products,
28 patients received RBC (mean 2.3 ± 1.1 units) but
no plasma, 49 patients received between one and four
units of plasma (mean 3.1 ± 0.9 units of plasma and
2.1 ± 1.6 units of RBC), and 89 patients received
more than four units of plasma (mean 7.8 ± 4.3 units
of plasma and 4.7 ± 4.3 units of RBC). The one-year
survival rate was significantly decreased to 81.6% in
patients receiving one to four units of plasma (P =

units of plasma (P = 0.002).
Table V shows the stratification of the one-year survival rate according to the RBC and plasma transfusion in order to determine if one of the two variables
is more strongly associated with a decrease in survival.
Survival was decreased significantly in the presence of
plasma transfusion in patients receiving no RBC units.
In contrast, survival is not decreased in a significant
fashion in those patients who received RBC with or
without plasma. Survival decreased to 60.0% in
patients receiving greater than four units of both RBC
and plasma.
The risk of dying within a year was 4.2 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8–9.7] in patients
transfused with more than four units of RBC compared to those who received four or less units of RBC.
Patients who received one or more units of plasma had
a risk 5.1 times higher (95% CI 1.5–17.5) than those
receiving no plasma. In patients receiving more than
four units of RBC, the risk was 4.4 times higher (95%
CI 1.9–10.2) in patients who also received plasma.
The risk further increased to 5.3 times greater (95%
CI 2.3–12.4) in patients receiving greater than four
units of both RBC and plasma compared to patients
receiving four or less units of both RBC and plasma.
Table VI shows the survival rate and the number of
patients according to each diagnosis. The survival rate
did not change after the adoption of leukoreduction
of all allogenic blood products in June 1999 (80.0 %
vs 83.8 %, P = NS). 
Discussion
Our overall one-year survival rate of 81.9% is comparable to other studies,9,12–14 but is lower than the 90%
reported by the Stanford group.5 Compared to our
study, the Stanford study excluded repeated transplantations.5 It is possible that we had a sicker patient
cohort. In part this could be due to the fact that public
and universal health care in the province of Québec may
preclude selection bias. Furthermore, cadaveric organ
procurement is less common in Québec (18.4 donors
per million people per year) than in certain American
states (e.g., 33 donors per million people in
Pennsylvania).15 Consequently liver transplant recipients might incur both a longer pre-transplant waiting
period and an increased pre-transplant morbidity. Other
potential explanations for our lower survival rate may be
due to the different immunosuppressive medications in
our cohort. Different immunosuppressive regimens
vary in survival rates.14 We do not know the immunosuppressive therapy used by the Stanford group.
In a preliminary study, we determined that intraoperative plasma transfusion was the variable most closely associated with the need for RBC transfusion in
liver transplantation surgery. Plasma was transfused to
correct prolonged international normalized ratios
(INRs). A great disparity was noted in the plasma
transfusion rate between anesthesiologists, indicating
a liberal plasma transfusion practice. For RBC transfusion the threshold did not differ significantly amongst
anesthesiologists (67.6 ± 12.5 g·L–1 to 69.8 ± 10.7
g·L–1). In the present study, univariate analysis showed
no decrease in one-year survival in the presence of an
elevated initial INR (Table III). 
In the Stanford study,5 patients receiving more than
four units of RBC had a significant decrease in their
one-year survival rate. Multivariate analysis, in their
study, showed that gender and pre-transplant morbidity ultimately influenced the survival rate rather than
RBC transfusion. The Stanford study and Ramos et
al.
9 did not report the amount of plasma transfused.
Our univariate and multivariate analyses showed that
only the number of transfused RBC units and the
number of transfused plasma units were significantly
associated with a decrease in the one-year survival rate.
The starting Hb value, the starting platelet count, the
cause of the liver failure, the starting creatinine value,
the Pugh’s score, the MELD score, a history of previous high abdominal surgery, and previous liver transplantation were not associated with a decrease in the
one-year survival rate. This correlates with the observation by Deschênes et al.
16 that the severity of cirrhosis was a poor predictor of the six-months survival
rate. We calculated that, to obtain a difference of 25%
in the mean values of these variables, in the surviving
patients, with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power (1-
beta ) over 80%, we needed the number of deaths to
be between three and 30, which was lower than the
actual number (35 deaths) observed in our study.

ing cardiac surgery. In our centre, allogenic blood
products have been leukoreduced since June 14th,
1999. We did not detect an improvement of our survival rate after this date.
Our data seem to suggest that plasma transfusion
may be more deleterious than RBC transfusion (Table
V). For RBC transfusion, the number of administered
units influenced the survival rate. The group receiving
one to four units of RBC had a better one-year survival (86.6%) than those receiving more than four
units of RBC (62.5%; P = 0.002) or those receiving
plasma only (76.9%; P = 0.034). The group receiving
only plasma received 1.3 units more plasma (mean 4.9
units) than the group receiving one to four units of
RBC (mean 3.6 units) despite the fact that the former
group may have been healthier on the basis of starting
Hb value (Table I). The absolute presence, rather than
the quantity, of plasma administered was significantly
associated with a lower survival rate. This was seen
most markedly in the patients receiving either no RBC
or more than four units of RBC. If plasma has a deleterious effect, it could be that there is a harmful factor
that is inconsistently present in plasma or whose
effects are manifest inconsistently. It seems that transfusion of four or less units of RBC confers a protective
effect in the presence of plasma transfusion.
Furthermore, the total amount of blood products
given during the whole hospitalization was also
looked at, from one month prior the surgery till three
months after. Patients that received few transfusions
intraoperatively had the same profile in the perioperative period. The converse was also true. In the group
that only received plasma, a mean of 9.2 units of plasma was transfused in the perioperative period. Patients
who died in this group received even more plasma
(mean 13.2 units) during their hospitalization.
Prior studies have shown that RBC transfusion is an
independent predictor of morbidity.6–9,18–20 In the last
three referenced studies,18–20 RBC or whole blood
transfusions increased the incidence of multiple organ
failure associated with trauma or major abdominal
surgery. Mortality during coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) also increased.19 However these
studies did not differentiate between whole blood and
RBC transfusions nor did they mention the amount of
plasma transfused.
With transfusion of unwashed RBC some plasma is
automatically transfused. If many units of RBC are
transfused, eventually an appreciable quantity of plasma is also transfused. If the plasma is the culprit, this
may explain a decrease in the one-year survival rate.
When plasma units are transfused, a large amount of
plasma is given and the survival rate decreases. This
might be due to the debilitated and immunosuppressed status of the patients.
Moore et al.18 and Murphy et al.
19 suggested that
transfusion of allogenic blood could decrease immunity and lead to postoperative infections and multiple
organ failure. Another hypothesis was banked blood
could activate neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) that would be part of the inflammatory cascade
present in tissue damage, ischemia, or reperfusion.

21 could not demonstrate whether
pneumonia or wound infections were increased with
allogenic plasma transfusion during CABG. Allogenic
plasma transfusion immunomodulation could not be
proved in this study. Our patients who received plasma had a decreased one-year survival rate. It could be
hypothesized that the correction of the coagulation
dysfunction leads to vascular thrombosis at the graft
level and hence shortens its survival; however, correction of the coagulation defects with transfusion of
plasma was not measured.
Although our findings meet several criteria for
causality (biological plausibility, the presence of temporal association, a dose-effect relationship, consistency, specificity, and strength of association),22 one
should be cautious in concluding that there is a direct
relationship between plasma or RBC transfusion and
decreased one-year survival. Unfortunately, plasma or
RBC transfusions are not the only variables that can
affect the survival rate. In some other institutions,
immunosuppressants like tacrolimus and cyclosporine
are used separately and tacrolimus is associated with
superior survival.14 In our cohort, drugs were associated in different ratios according to three different
immunosuppressive research protocols; thus, it was
possible for a given patient to have received as many as
five different immunosuppressive medications (prednisone, azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and
basiliximab). Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn
from our data with respect to the relationship between
a specific immunosuppressive program and the oneyear survival rate.
The retrospective nature of this study has other
inherent weaknesses. For example, there was no blood
transfusion protocol in place. However, looking back
raised the question of whether patients could be identified as having received blood products without
absolute necessity. Another weakness was the relatively few patients in this study. Since this study, we have
looked at the one-year survival rate of liver transplantations in the five-year period (January 1993 to
December 1997) before this study. There were 183
liver transplantations and the one-year survival rate
did decrease in the groups receiving only plasma or
more than four units of RBC. 
In conclusion, in our series of 206 consecutive liver
transplantations done at the St Luc Hospital of the
CHUM, patients received an average of 2.8 units of
RBC and 4.1 units of plasma. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 27 variables showed that RBC and
plasma transfusions were associated significantly with a
decrease in the one-year survival rate following liver
transplantation. One-year survival rate following liver
transplantation decreased significantly in association
with the intraoperative administration of any amount
of plasma or the administration of more than four
units of RBC. Plasma transfusion appeared to be more
deleterious than RBC transfusion. A direct causal relationship between plasma or RBC transfusion and outcome could not be verified by our study. Despite this
limitation, we feel that the result of this study is another call for prudent risk-benefit analysis in transfusion
decision-making.
