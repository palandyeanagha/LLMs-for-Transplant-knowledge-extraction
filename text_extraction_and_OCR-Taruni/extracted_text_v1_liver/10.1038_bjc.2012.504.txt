Background: Malignant glioma is an aggressive tumour commonly associated with a dismal outcome despite optimal surgical and
radio-chemotherapy. Since 2005 temozolomide has been established as first-line chemotherapy. We investigate the role of in vivo
glioma models in predicting clinical efficacy.
Methods: We searched three online databases to systematically identify publications testing temozolomide in animal models of
glioma. Median survival and number of animals treated were extracted and quality was assessed using a 12-point scale; random
effects meta-analysis was used to estimate efficacy. We analysed the impact of study design and quality and looked for evidence
of publication bias.
Results: We identified 60 publications using temozolomide in models of glioma, comprising 2443 animals. Temozolomide
prolonged survival by a factor of 1.88 (95% CI 1.74–2.03) and reduced tumour volume by 50.4% (41.8–58.9) compared with
untreated controls. Study design characteristics accounted for a significant proportion of between-study heterogeneity, and there
was evidence of a significant publication bias.
Conclusion: These data reflect those from clinical trials in that temozolomide improves survival and reduces tumour volume, even
after accounting for publication bias. Experimental in vivo glioma studies of temozolomide differ from those of other glioma
therapies in their consistent efficacy and successful translation into clinical medicine.
Malignant glioma is very aggressive and notoriously difficult to
treat. With an annual incidence of around 5 cases per 100 000 it is
relatively uncommon, but still comprises approximately 70% of
malignant brain tumours (Wen and Kesari, 2008). Owing to their
tendency to infiltrate brain tissue, gliomas are very difficult to treat
surgically, and the vast majority recur after apparent ‘complete’
resection (Wen and Kesari, 2008). One of the first clinical trials
(Walker et al, 1978) showed that glioma patients receiving ‘optimal
conventional care’ (no radiotherapy or chemotherapy) had a
median survival of 3 months and a 1-year survival of 3%. Various
trials between 1970 and the 1990s supported the use of
radiotherapy, but existing chemotherapies were of limited use.
Despite showing some promise in animal research (Amarasingh
et al, 2009), the nitrosoureas BNCU and CCNU had little clinical
efficacy. Indeed, it took a large meta-analysis including 43000
patients (Stewart, 2002) to show a small increase in survival
between radiotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy (46% at 1 year,
20% at 2 years) and radiotherapy alone (40% and 15%,
respectively).
Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent, a prodrug for
3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide, whose anticancer activity was first described in 1987 (Stevens et al, 1987). In

2005, a landmark phase III trial (Stupp et al, 2005) described the
efficacy the new therapeutic agent temozolomide: when given
together with radiotherapy and as adjuvant therapy there were
significant increases in median survival (14 vs 12 months,
Po0.001), 2-year survival and progression-free survival compared
with radiotherapy alone. Since then, temozolomide has emerged as
the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of
malignant glioma (van den Bent et al, 2006).
Although temozolomide was being used clinically for melanoma in the mid-1990s, supported by substantial experimental
data (Bleehen et al, 1995), there were no such animal data on
temozolomide for brain tumours. The efficacy of temozolomide in
glioma was actually first reported in patients somewhat anecdotally
(O’Reilly et al, 1993), with a more structured study by the same
group published in 1996 (Newlands et al, 1996). The first animal
work in the area was published in 1994 (Plowman et al, 1994), and
by 1998 and 2000 the first patients were recruited for phase II (van
den Bent et al, 2003) and III (Stupp et al, 2005) trials, respectively.
A preliminary literature search of PubMed suggests that by the end
of 2000, only seven relevant experimental studies had been
published. The basis for the decision to proceed to clinical trial
is therefore not clear: possible factors include those experimental
data, which did exist; the non-randomised clinical evidence of
O’Reilly (O’Reilly et al, 1993) and Newlands (Newlands et al,
1996); and evidence from phase II studies testing temozolomide
with other cancer types (Bleehen et al, 1995; Woll et al, 1995).
Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of
nitrosoureas (Amarasingh et al, 2009) and gene therapy (Conlin,
unpublished observations) for experimental glioma models have
shown some efficacy, but neither led to substantial improvement in
outcomes in human clinical trials (Stewart, 2002; Pulkkanen and
Yla-Herttuala, 2005). Identification of differences in the experimental data for nitrosourea, gene therapy and temozolomide
studies might therefore provide insight into translational challenges in neuro-oncology.
Here, we use systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental animal research to describe the evidence supporting the
application of temozolomide in human glioma. We also compare
the evidence available before and after the publication of Stupp’s
phase III trial (Stupp et al, 2005). We were particularly interested
in evidence within the experimental temozolomide data that was
predictive of its successful translation into clinical use. Secondary
aims were (i) to compare temozolomide data from animal
experiments before and after 2005 (the publication of the phase
III trial); (ii) to seek evidence of the use of measures to avoid bias,
and of publication bias; and (iii) to compare the efficacy of
temozolomide in animal glioma models with that reported for
nitrosoureas (Amarasingh et al, 2009) and gene therapy (Conlin,
unpublished observations). Our hypotheses were that temozolomide would significantly improve outcome in animal models
of glioma; and second that publication and expectation biases
would lead to significantly higher estimates of efficacy in studies
published after the Stupp trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Information sources. We searched PubMed, EMBASE (from
1980) and Medline (from 1950) on the 4 August 2011, using these
search terms: Temozolomide AND (glioma OR glioblastoma OR
astrocytoma OR ependymoma OR oligodendroglioma OR ‘brain
tumour’). For EMBASE and Medline the search was limited to
animals, and for PubMed we used the Hooijmans (Hooijmans et al,
2010) animal search filter.
Study selection. All abstracts and titles were screened by two
authors (TCH and KJE) to include papers addressing
temozolomide therapy in in vivo xenograft studies. All publications
in languages other than English were translated before screening.
We included studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (1)
temozolomide used as monotherapy; (2) animal model of glioma
used; (3) intracranial or subcutaneous implantation of tumour
cells; (4) outcome reported as either median survival or tumour
volume; and (5) the number of animals per group was stated
within the publication.
Data collection. We extracted data relating to experimental design
and for each comparison, we recoded median survival or tumour
volume in treated and control groups. When data were not clearly
or fully described we contacted authors seeking the data; if no reply
was received after 1 week these were excluded. Data were entered
to the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of
Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) data
manager application in Microsoft Access 2003.
For experimental design we extracted data for species, strain and
sex of animals; glioma cell type, tumour implantation site, tumour
implantation method, number or volume of implanted tumour
cells and method of tumour volume measurement (where
relevant). Glioma models were stratified into groups (Table 1).
In addition, we recorded the total dose of temozolomide (in
mg kg  1
), delay to treatment (in days) and route of administration. When dose was given in mg m 2
, we converted it to mg kg  1
using Freirich’s (Freireich et al, 1966) conversion factor; where
animals received continuing treatment courses, we calculated the
total dose received by the time of median survival or the last time
at which tumour volume was measured. Experimental starting
point (i.e., day 0) was defined as the day of tumour implantation.
When the delay from implantation to treatment was not given, we
contacted authors seeking this information.
For each comparison, we extracted data for the number of
animals in each group and either median survival or mean tumour
volume, relative tumour volume or percentage change in tumour
volume. For measures of tumour volume, we also recorded the s.d.
or s.e.m. If any of these measures were missing, the publication was
excluded. When outcomes were not quantified in the text, we
measured outcome values from Figures using AVPSoft ‘Universal
Desktop Ruler’.

Quality assessment. Study quality was evaluated for each publication using a modified 12-point checklist (Amarasingh et al,
2009) with one point allocated to each reported item; (1) peerreviewed publication, (2) sample size calculation, (3) random
allocation to groups, (4) blinded assessment of outcome, (5)
compliance with animal welfare regulations, (6) statement of
potential conflict of interests, (7) consistent volume or number of
cells inoculated, (8) consistent site of tumour implantation, (9)
reported number of animals in which the xenograft did not grow,
(10) number of excluded animals stated, and reasons for exclusion
given, (11) explanation of tumour model used, or multiple glioma
models used and (12) presentation of evidence that temozolomide
acts directly against tumour.
Data analysis. For tumour volume data, efficacy was quantified
using the normalised mean difference summary statistic (Sena et al,
2010). These effect sizes were then pooled using DerSimonian and
Laird random effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986)
to provide summary estimates of efficacy and to explore differences
between groups of experiments.
To summarise median survival data we used the median
survival ratio, MSR (treated survival divided by control survival) as
an approach consistent with the gold standard hazard ratio method
(Michiels et al, 2005; Tierney et al, 2007). Median survival ratio
was log-transformed to give a normal distribution (Simes, 1987),
and then log-MSRs were pooled using a modified DerSimonian
and Laird random effects model. As no measure of variance was
available for MSRs, we weighted studies according to the number
of animals used (the number of treated animals plus the number of
control animals divided by the number of treatment groups per
control group). As measures of variance were not present in the
extracted data, we estimated the standard error of summary
estimates from the inter-study variance: random effects-weighted
s.d. of log-MSR from the random effects – effect size was divided
by the square root of the number of comparisons. We used random
effects-weighted s.e. because the resulting estimate of variance is
broader and therefore more conservative than unweighted s.e. 95%
confidence intervals about the random effects mean log-MSR were
calculated and the exponential of this log-MSR generated summary
MSR data.
For stratified meta-analysis, we used the w2 statistic, with n-1
degrees of freedom, to determine the extent to which stratification
accounted for the observed heterogeneity. We used Bonferroni
correction to account for the number of stratifications – with 12
strata for survival and 13 for volume data (1 extra stratifications for
the method of volume measurement) giving critical values for
significance of P ¼ 0.0043 and P ¼ 0.0039, respectively. We used
funnel plots, Egger regression (Egger et al, 1997) and Trim and Fill
analysis (Duval and Tweedie, 2000) to seek evidence of publication
bias; for survival data, we used the number of animals as the
measure of precision (Peters et al, 2006).
RESULTS
Electronic searching identified 298 publications, of which 84
satisfied the inclusion criteria; 24 were excluded at data extraction
(Figure 1). Four papers in foreign languages were identified of
which one met our inclusion criteria. From the remaining 60
publications, 123 and 26 individual comparisons were identified
for median survival and tumour volume outcomes respectively,
representing data from 2044 and 399 animals. Temozolomide
treatment led to significant improvements in survival (MSR:
mean 1.88, 95% CI 1.74–2.03; w2 ¼ 388, df ¼ 122; Po0.0043) and
reductions in tumour volume (50.4% (41.8–58.9); w2 ¼ 172,
df ¼ 25; Po0.0039).
The median quality score was 6 out of 12 (IQR 5–7, range 3–8).
Of the 60 publications, none reported sample size calculations or
allocation concealment; 32 reported random group allocation and
5 reported blinding of outcome assessment. All studies used either
mice or rats; mice were used more frequently for both survival and
volume outcomes (89 vs 34; 18 vs 8), and 41 different glioma
models were tested. Information regarding delay to treatment was
not available for seven publications.
Study characteristics. Randomised treatment allocation was
associated with an increase in the MSR (2.03 (1.83–2.26), n ¼ 66
vs 1.71 (1.53–1.90), n ¼ 57; w2 ¼ 13.2, df ¼ 1; Po0.0043) and a
reduction in tumour volume (50.1% (40.1–60.0), n ¼ 19% vs 51.1%
(33.7–68.4), n ¼ 7; w2 ¼ 18.7, df ¼ 1; Po0.0039). Studies that
blinded the assessment of outcome reported a greater reduction
in tumour volume (64.4% (9.57–119), n ¼ 2% vs 48.8% (40.3–57.4),
n ¼ 24; w2 ¼ 9.70, df ¼ 1; Po0.0039), but no association with MSR
was observed. Total quality score had a significant impact on
tumour volume (w2 ¼ 44.5, df ¼ 5; Po0.0039 (Figure 2B) but not
survival (Figure 2A)). Method of volume quantification (stratified
into excision and histology, MRI, external calliper and unknown)
was also associated with differences in reported volume reduction.
The single study measuring tumour volume by MRI reported
greater temozolomide efficacy compared with those measuring
volume by either excision and histology or external caliper
(61.0% (50.5–71.6), n ¼ 1% vs 52.6% (38.9–66.3), n ¼ 9 and 52.1%
(38.4–65.7), n ¼ 12, respectively: w2¼ 23.3, df¼ 3; Po0.0039).
Animal and tumour models. There were no significant differences in temozolomide efficacy between rats and mice for either
survival or reduction in tumour volume. Athymic animals were
commonly used in survival studies (n ¼ 50 publications) and
occasionally to study effects on tumour volume (n ¼ 3). Other
comorbidities used with survival were severe compromised
immunodeficient (n ¼ 1) and unspecified immunocompromised
(n ¼ 11). Comorbidity accounted for a significant proportion of
between-study heterogeneity for survival (w2 ¼ 40.1, df ¼ 3;
Po0.0043, Figure 3A), with efficacy being significantly greater in

animals with comorbidities, but not for tumour volume
(Figure 3b). Almost all experiments reporting median survival
used intracranial glioma models, the remainder using subcutaneous glioma (121 vs 2). For tumour volume experiments, 12
comparisons used intracranial and 14 used subcutaneous models.
For both survival and volume experiments, the reporting
of the amount of tumour cells injected was good – most reporting
either a number of cells (124 out of 146 comparisons, ranging from
1000 to 1 000 000 implanted cells, although only 11 comparisons
were made with models using fewer than implanted 100 000 cells)
or a set volume of implanted cells (14 out of 146, 1 mm3 in all
cases).
Next, we examined the impact of the glioma cell species of
origin and the glioma cell type used (Figure 4). Human- and ratderived cells predominated, with human glioma lines being more
commonly used for both outcomes (MSR: n ¼ 87, volume: n ¼ 15).
The species of origin did not account for a significant proportion of
the observed heterogeneity for MSR but temozolomide therapy was
associated with a larger volume reduction in human-derived
glioma cell lines (w2 ¼ 43.9, df ¼ 1; Po0.0039). In both models,
there was significant variation of efficacy between glioma models
(MSR: w2 ¼ 53.6, df ¼ 12; Po0.0043; volume: w2 ¼ 66.7, df ¼ 6;
Po0.0039), with GBM and 9L lines appearing to be most sensitive
to temozolomide (for specifications of glioma lines, see Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 2). O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status of the glioma models used was investigated
and reported in only 11 of 60 publications.
Temozolomide dosing. For temozolomide dosing regimens, we
analysed data for total temozolomide dose (Figures 5A and B),
delay to treatment (Figures 5C and D) and route of delivery
(Figures 5E and F); for treatment duration, number of cycles and
other aspects of the dosing regime there was such diversity of
approach that we did not consider a stratified analysis likely to be
informative. Both outcomes showed significant variability between
dose stratified into groups of o50, 51–100, 101–500, 501–1000
and 41000 mg kg  1
. The dose of temozolomide explained a
significant proportion of the observed heterogeneity, with higher
doses generally associated with greater efficacy (MSR: w2 ¼ 17.2,
df ¼ 4; Po0.0043; volume: w2 ¼ 91.7, df ¼ 3; Po0.0039), although
there may have been a decline in efficacy at total doses above
1 g kg  1 (Figures 5A and B).
Delay to treatment was stratified into groups of 0, 1–10, 11–20
and 420 days post-inoculation, and this accounted for a significant
proportion of between-study heterogeneity for both MSR and
volume reduction (MSR: w2¼ 47.0, df¼ 4; Po0.0043; volume:
w2¼ 45.9, df¼ 3; Po0.0039). For survival, efficacy was greatest the
earlier temozolomide treatment was initiated. However, we saw
the converse for tumour volume: the longer the delay to treatment
the more effective temozolomide was in reducing tumour volume.
Those studies in which treatment was initiated 420 days after
tumour inoculation were associated with a greater reduction in
tumour volume than those where the delay was 1–10 or 11–20 days.
When we examined the effect of the route of drug administration. We found that those treated with local temozolomide

survived longer than those treated systemically (w2 ¼ 17.6, df ¼ 2;
Po0.0043), but there was no difference in tumour volume
reduction. However, when we looked in more detail at systemic
delivery routes for tumour volume reduction we found significant
differences (w2 ¼ 75.7, df ¼ 3; Po0.0039), oral delivery providing
the best survival benefit and intraperitoneal delivery having the
largest effect on tumour volume.
Publication bias. For both MSR and tumour volume, there was
no difference in reported efficacy before and after the Stupp
publication (Figures 6A and B). For both survival and volume data,
the intercept of Egger regression was positive (Figures 6C–F)
indicating an excess of small imprecise studies overstating efficacy.
Trim and Fill analysis supported asymmetry of survival data

(1.42–1.70), compared with an unadjusted estimate of 1.88
(1.74–2.03), after the addition of 24 ‘missing’ studies.
DISCUSSION
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 publications
involving 2377 animals, we found that overall temozolomide
therapy almost doubled survival and halved tumour volume.
Furthermore, observed efficacy seemed to be influenced by
randomisation, blinding, total quality score, animal comorbidity,
glioma model (including species), total dose, delay to treatment
and route of temozolomide delivery.
We identified 17 papers published before 2005 describing the
efficacy of temozolomide. Although this is a reasonable basis on
which to proceed to clinical trials it is a cause of some concern that
many of these early publications, which were of most interest to us,
did not present control data or measures of variance, and indeed
nine did not present sufficient data to allow them to be included in
this meta-analysis.
Overall study quality was modest; the median number of study
quality checklist items scored was 6 (of a possible 12) and no study
scored higher than 8. Studies that did not report simple measures
to reduce bias such as randomisation and blinding of outcome
assessment gave significantly higher estimates of efficacy, confirming an important role in experimental design in glioma similar to
that established in other neurological disease models (Frantzias
et al, 2011; van der Worp et al, 2007).
Previous meta-analyses in the animal modelling of glioma have
been conducted using median survival as the primary outcome, but
there is as yet no consensus about the most appropriate analysis of
such data. We used MSRs as an approximation of the gold
standard hazard ratio approach (Michiels et al, 2005; Tierney et al,
2007). By estimating standard error from the size of each study, we
were able to combine data using a random effects approach. As
weights and the heterogeneity statistics were therefore calculated
using study size to estimate standard error it is possible that this

might have confounded the relative weighting given to individual
studies. However, given the high heterogeneity observed, in
practice this approach has trended towards a simple average, with
studies being given roughly equal weight. As MSR analysis does not
provide a measure of within-study variance, we calculated s.e. and
therefore 95% confidence intervals using inter-study variance to
provide the most reliable measure of overall variance from the
available data. A major limitation of our analysis is, because it is
univariate, it does not provide insight into how different variables
interact with each other. An example of this is the dose regimen
and the interaction between different aspects of this; however,
there were insufficient data to allow multivariate analysis to help
disentangle the impact of multiple factors.
Differences between different experimental glioma models have
previously been discussed (Whittle et al, 1998; Amarasingh et al,
2009). There is a large amount of variation in neuropathology,
natural history and drug sensitivity (Whittle et al, 1998; Candolfi
et al, 2007; Zhang et al, 2010) and this underpins the importance of
glioma model selection during experimental design. Of the 60
studies, 18 justified their choice of glioma model, or used multiple
models for comparison. Our data show a significant variation in
temozolomide sensitivity between tumour models. Previous
evidence suggests that human-derived tumours are more sensitive
to chemotherapy than those originating in rodents (Amarasingh
et al, 2009): temozolomide also appeared to be more effective at
reducing tumour volume in human-derived tumours, however,
there was no difference in survival data and there may be an
artefact of between-model heterogeneity. Nevertheless, it remains
clear that tumours show a great degree of variability in their
sensitivity to treatment. This may reflect either the degree of
differentiation within the tumour or temozolomide resistance
through a variety of mechanisms (Zhang et al, 2010), including
MGMT expression. Therefore, genomic analysis of specific
tumour models and analysis of drug sensitivities and resistances
may give insights into the future development of tailored
chemotherapy.
Temozolomide is clinically effective in malignant glioma (Stupp
et al, 2005; van den Bent et al, 2006) and this meta-analysis shows
temozolomide also improves survival and reduces tumour volume
in experimental glioma; whereas a substantial proportion of this
evidence comes after the publication of the pivotal clinical trial this
remains an example of concordance between experimental and
clinical findings (Perel et al, 2007; Sena et al, 2010). There was no
significant change in reported efficacy for temozolomide after the
publication of the phase III temozolomide randomised control
trial, but there was evidence for a significant publication bias.
The nitrosoureas previously used in glioma such as carmustine
(BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU) had limited efficacy (Stewart,
2002). In a meta-analysis of nitrosoureas in experimental glioma
efficacy was less than reported here for temozolomide with greater
variability, and survival was not significantly increased
(Amarasingh et al, 2009). Similarly, gene therapy has been studied
in glioma models, but has not translated successfully into clinical
use. Pulkkanen and Yla-Herttuala (2005) concluded that clinical
efficacy of gene therapy in several small RCTs was variable, and
overall efficacy remains questionable. Data from a meta-analysis of
gene therapy in experimental glioma models (Conlin, under
review) came to a similar conclusion; gene therapy does prolong
survival in experimental glioma, but there was substantial
variability, that is to say inconsistency of effect. This contrasts
with the findings reported here for temozolomide, and suggests
that consistency of effect across a range of circumstances may be
important for successful translation.
In conclusion, temozolomide is effective in experimental glioma
models, although this is qualified by concerns of the internal
validity (randomisation, blinding) and of publication bias.
Temozolomide appears to be more consistent in its efficacy than
either nitrosoureas or gene therapy, and this observation may help
guide future translational research in neuro-oncology.
