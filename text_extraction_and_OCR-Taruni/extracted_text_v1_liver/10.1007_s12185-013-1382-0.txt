Abstract Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the major physiological regulator of platelet production. TPO binds the TPO
receptor, activates JAK and STAT pathways, thus stimulating megakaryocyte growth and platelet production.
There is no ‘‘sensor’’ of the platelet count; rather TPO is
produced in the liver at a constant rate and cleared by TPO
receptors on platelets. TPO levels are inversely proportional to the rate of platelet production. Early recombinant
TPO molecules were potent stimulators of platelet production and increased platelets in patients with immune
thrombocytopenia, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, myelodysplastic syndromes and platelet apheresis
donors. Neutralizing antibodies formed against one
recombinant protein and ended their development. A second generation of TPO receptor agonists, romiplostim and
eltrombopag, has been developed. Romiplostim is an IgG
heavy chain into which four TPO agonist peptides have
been inserted. Eltrombopag is an oral small molecule.
These activate the TPO receptor by different mechanisms
to increase megakaryocyte growth and platelet production.
After administration of either to healthy volunteers, there is
a delay of 5 days before the platelet count rises and subsequently reaches a peak after 12–14 days. Both have been
highly effective in treating ITP and hepatitis C thrombocytopenia. Studies in a wide variety of other thrombocytopenic conditions are underway.

Introduction
Thrombopoietin (TPO) was the last major hematopoietic
growth factor to be identified, purified and cloned. The
concept of a ‘‘thrombopoietin’’ had first entered the medical literature in 1958 when Kelemen proposed that a
hematopoietic growth factor existed that regulated platelet
production just as erythropoietin-regulated red cell production [1]. However, despite many decades of work by
many laboratories, thrombopoietin remained elusive until
its purification almost simultaneously by five separate
research groups in 1994 [2–6]. Since then much has been
learned about the structure and function of thrombopoietin
as well as its clinical use.
In 1994 two recombinant thrombopoietins, recombinant
human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) and pegylated, recombinant, human megakaryocyte growth and development
factor (PEG-rhMGDF), began clinical development [7].
Both were potent stimulators of megakaryocyte growth and
platelet production in both animal models and human
subjects. A number of clinical trials demonstrated
improved platelet counts in a variety of clinical situations
ranging from chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia [8]
to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [9]. Unfortunately,
antibodies developed against PEG-rhMGDF in some
healthy volunteers who received this agent and these
antibodies neutralized its activity but also cross-reacted
with and neutralized endogenous thrombopoietin to produce a paradoxical thrombocytopenia [10]. This concern
about their antigenicity led to the discontinuation of any
further development of recombinant thrombopoietins.

Given the promising results of the initial clinical work
with recombinant thrombopoietins, a number of second
generation thrombopoietin molecules, referred to hereafter
as TPO receptor agonists, have now been developed [11,
12]. These were also effective stimulators of megakaryocyte growth and platelet production. Two of them, romiplostim and eltrombopag, have been approved in many
countries for the treatment of ITP.
This chapter will review the structure and basic biology
of thrombopoietin as well as its early development. An
additional focus will be on the newer TPO receptor agonists describing their structure, function, pharmacology,
known and potential adverse effects, and a brief overview
of their current clinical use.
Thrombopoietin structure
TPO is synthesized primarily in the liver as a 353 amino
acid precursor protein with a molecular weight of 36 kDa
[2, 4, 13]. Following removal of a 21 amino acid signal
peptide, the remaining 332 amino acid protein undergoes
glycosylation and produces a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 95 kDa on SDS-PAGE [10] and 57.5 kDa by
mass spectrometry [14]. This glycoprotein is then released
from the liver into the circulation with no apparent intracellular storage in the liver.
TPO is a member of the four-helix-bundle cytokine
superfamily and has several unusual properties (Fig. 1).
First, it is much larger than most other hematopoietic
growth factors, such as granulocyte colony stimulating
factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO). Second, it has
two distinct domains: an EPO-like domain (residues
1–153) and a carbohydrate-rich domain (residues 154–332)
separated by site of potential proteolytic cleavage
(Arg153–Arg154) [15]. Whether this potential cleavage
site is of biological relevance is unclear.
The amino acid structure of the EPO-like domain is
highly conserved and the first 153 amino acids of TPO are
23 % identical with human EPO and probably 50 %
Fig. 1 Thrombopoietin (TPO) structure. Amino acids 1–153 define the
‘‘EPO-like’’ domain which binds the TPO receptor. Amino acids 154–332
define the ‘‘carbohydrate-rich’’ domain that provides stability. Sites of
potential thrombin cleavage are indicated. Red bars indicate known
disulphide linkages (Courtesy of Dr. T. Kato, Pharmaceutical Research
Laboratory, Kirin Brewing Company, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan)

similar if conservative amino acid substitutions are taken
into consideration [16]. Furthermore, the EPO domain of
TPO contains four alpha-helical regions which are structurally similar to those in EPO. However, EPO does not
bind the TPO receptor and, conversely, TPO does not bind
the EPO receptor.
The role of the carbohydrate-rich domain of thrombopoietin remains less clear. None of this region is important
for receptor binding and this region is less conserved among
different species. Murine and human thrombopoietin are
only 62 % identical in the carbohydrate-rich domain while
they are 84 % identical in the EPO-like domain. While all
of the receptor binding activity reside in the EPO domain,
the carbohydrate-rich domain seems to be important for
stabilizing the molecule in the circulation; indeed the
truncated first 153 amino acids of TPO has a markedly
decreased circulatory half-life compared to the 20- to 40-h
half-life of the mature protein [17]. (Paradoxically the
truncated molecule has a specific activity in vitro 20-fold
higher than the whole molecule [18, 19].) Presumably, the
glycosylated domain of TPO confers stability and prolongs
its circulatory half-life just like the way carbohydrate
sequences regulate the stability of EPO [19, 20].
Recent analysis of the crystal structure of the receptorbinding domain (residues 1–163) has determined that TPO
has an antiparallel four-helix bundle fold and can interact
with a soluble thrombopoietin receptor construct with a 1:2
stoichiometry with one high-affinity (3.3 9 109 M-1
) and
one low-affinity (1.1 9 109 M-1
) binding site [21]. This
leads to the functional properties which are discussed next.
Thrombopoietin function
The mechanism by which TPO binds to the TPO receptor and
initiates signal transduction has been well outlined (Fig. 2).
Like the EPO receptor [22, 23], the TPO receptor (c-mpl)
probably exists as a preformed but inactive dimer. Each TPO
receptor monomer contains two CRH (cytokine receptor
homology) domains. In the absence of the distal CRH, the TPO
receptor is active suggesting that the distal CRH domain
inhibits activation of the TPO receptor until relieved by TPO
binding. TPO binds only to the distal CRH of the TPO receptor
and not to the proximal CRH and thereby activates the receptor.
Binding of TPO to its receptor initiates a wide variety of
signal transduction pathways. The best known of these are
the JAK and STAT pathways, which become phosphorylated and promote cell growth [24]. In addition, MAP kinase
pathways are activated, which potentiate maturation.
Finally, less well studied but equally important, are the antiapoptotic pathways that are activated [25–27]. As discussed
next, TPO binding results in mitosis, endomitosis, maturation, and a wide variety of anti-apoptotic effects in megakaryocyte precursors and in megakaryocytes [6, 28]. Indeed,
the removal of TPO from the circulation is also regulated by
this receptor binding, most likely on platelets [29, 30].

megakaryocyte colony forming cells (Meg-CFC), myeloid
and erythroid progenitors, to early and late megakaryocytes, as well as mature platelets. TPO receptors are not
found on normal or malignant non-hematopoietic tissues
[31], except possibly cardiac myocytes [26] and brain
neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells [32].
Each hematopoietic tissue has its own unique response
to TPO receptor binding.
• TPO is necessary for the viability of stem cells.
Children and animals born without TPO or the TPO
receptor are thrombocytopenic at birth and develop
pancytopenia over time [33]. Indeed, patients who
develop a neutralizing antibody to thrombopoietin
eventually develop pancytopenia [10, 34, 35].
• TPO stimulates mitosis of Meg-CFC [35].
• TPO stimulates megakaryocyte endomitosis and
increases the average ploidy of megakaryocytes. Of
all the effects of TPO, this requires the lowest TPO
concentration [6].
• TPO increases megakaryocyte maturation but seems to
have little role in the release of platelets from
megakaryocytes [36].
• TPO is the prime regulator of platelet production. In
animals in which both copies of the TPO gene have
been eliminated, platelet counts are approximately
10 % of normal but the animals are otherwise healthy
[36]. Knockout of only one of the two TPO genes
produces animals with half-normal platelet count,
confirming a TPO dosage effect. Animals in which
both copies of the TPO receptor gene are eliminated are
thrombocytopenic; however, animals with loss of one
TPO receptor gene have a normal platelet count [37–
39].
• TPO affects early progenitor cells of other lineages.
Animals that have lost both copies of the TPO gene are
thrombocytopenic and have 5–10 % of the normal
number of Meg-CFC; but erythroid and multilineage
colony forming cells are also markedly decreased
without affecting the red blood cell or white blood cell
count [37]. This suggests that in the normal physiology
TPO is responsible for the early maturation of all
lineages but only for the specific amplification of
megakaryocytes.
• TPO binds with high affinity to platelet TPO receptors.
There are 56 ± 17 TPO receptors per platelet with a KD
of 163 ± 31 pM and with these the platelets bind,
internalize and degrade TPO [29, 30]. This seems to be
the primary means by which TPO is regulated in
normal physiology [6].
In normal physiology TPO is made at a constant rate in
the liver, released into the circulation without any storage
form, and then rapidly cleared from the circulation by
platelets and possibly also megakaryocytes, leaving a basal
level of thrombopoietin in the circulation [6, 40]. There is
no cytokine or clinical scenario that increases TPO mRNA
or TPO production [41]. After liver resection or liver disease, TPO levels and platelet counts decrease [42, 43].
In situations of reduced platelet production such as after
chemotherapy, clearance by platelets and megakaryocytes
is decreased, TPO levels increase approximately 10- to
20-fold over baseline, in an apparent effort to increase
megakaryocyte growth and platelet production [44]. In
contrast, in ITP TPO levels are normal despite the low
platelet count, probably because platelet production and the
flux of platelets through the circulation are normal or
slightly elevated and despite their short half-life total TPO
clearance is normal [45, 46]. Furthermore, in patients with
essential thrombocythemia (ET) TPO levels are normal
because despite the markedly elevated platelet count, ET
platelets have a markedly reduced number of TPO receptors and net TPO clearance is normal [47]. Indeed, it has
been speculated that the elevated platelet count in this
disorder is actually due to this altered TPO clearance
mechanism [47].
This crude but effective feedback loop is in contrast to
that seen with EPO which has a well-defined mechanism in
which the kidney detects hypoxia and alters the transcription of the EPO gene. There does not seem to be any significant increase in TPO gene transcription in the liver in
thrombocytopenic animals [40]. This regulation of platelet
production by TPO is similar to that by which neutrophil
and monocyte production is regulated by G-CSF and
M-CSF in normal physiology [48].
Lessons learned from clinical studies with recombinant
thrombopoietin molecules
After the initial discovery of thrombopoietin in 1994, two
recombinant proteins, rhTPO and PEG-rhMGDF, rapidly
entered clinical development. rhTPO was a glycosylated
recombinant protein expressed in CHO cells that had an
amino acid sequence identical to that of endogenous
thrombopoietin although with a slightly different glycosylation pattern. In contrast, PEG-rhMGDF was a truncated
non-glycosylated protein containing all of the first 153
amino acids of TPO, the receptor-binding domain, coupled
to polyethylene glycol to improve stability [7].
Both of these recombinant proteins had a circulatory
half-life of 30–40 h and markedly increased platelet counts
in a dose-dependent fashion in healthy volunteers or in
cancer chemotherapy patients prior to chemotherapy [8,
49]. These two proteins defined the platelet count response
that can be expected after administration of recombinant
TPO as well as to the TPO receptor agonists [50]. That is,
Biology of TPO and TPO receptor agonists 13
123

after administering a single dose of TPO to a healthy animal or human, megakaryocyte ploidy becomes maximal on
Day 3 and megakaryocyte numbers increase on Day 4 [51].
There is no increase in the platelet count until Day 5; the
platelet count continues to rise until Day 10–14 after which
the platelet count gradually drifts back to baseline by Day
28 [50].
In clinical studies, rhTPO was given by an intravenous
injection and PEG-rhMGDF as a subcutaneous injection.
Both molecules were studied in a wide variety of clinical
situations. In lung cancer [8] or gynecological cancer [52]
chemotherapy trials, administration of a recombinant TPO
raised the nadir platelet count, decreased the duration of
thrombocytopenia, and in some situations reduced the need
for platelet transfusions. However, in myeloablative chemotherapy regimens (e.g., stem cell transplantation, leukemia induction chemotherapy) administration of either
recombinant protein before, during and/or after the chemotherapy failed to show any improvement in platelet
independence over 20 9 109
, duration of thrombocytopenia, or need for platelet transfusions [53, 54]. Both molecules produced a profound rebound thrombocytosis upon
platelet recovery which was clinically irrelevant.
In a few patients with myelodysplastic syndrome,
administration of recombinant TPO was associated with an
increase in platelet count and in some a multilineage
response was seen [55]. Three of four ITP patients given
PEG-rhMGDF for 7 days had their platelet count rise to
normal [9]. In patients being prepared for autologous stem
cell transplantation, priming of the patient with rhTPO plus
G-CSF increased the yield of CD34 cells collected at
apheresis over those treated with just G-CSF. There was a
statistically significant improvement in engraftment with
rhTPO mobilization but the magnitude of the effect was
clinically not that meaningful [53].
Finally, PEG-rhMGDF was given to a large number of
healthy platelet apheresis donors. Treatment with a single
dose produced a dose-dependent increase in platelet count
and also in the apheresis yield. Yields rose from 3.3 9 1011
platelets per donation in the placebo group to a high of
10.6 9 1011 in those receiving the highest dose of PEGrhMGDF [56]. These platelets were functional and, when
transfused to a thrombocytopenic patients undergoing
myeloablative therapy, produced a dose-dependent rise in
platelet count [57–59]. Similar results were seen in studies
with rhTPO [60].
In preparation for larger studies in apheresis patients, a
large number of paid healthy human volunteers were
administered PEG-rhMGDF. These subjects had the
expected rise in platelet count, but 13 of 535 developed
paradoxical thrombocytopenia due to the production of an
autoantibody that neutralized PEG-rhMGDF and also
cross-reacted with and neutralized the endogenous TPO
[10]. Fortunately, all of these healthy subjects recovered
from their thrombocytopenia upon drug cessation; a few
required a brief course of immunosuppressive therapy.
None have demonstrated long-term complications from
this exposure. Thrombocytopenia was never reported with
rhTPO but by 2001 development of both recombinant
proteins had stopped [61].
TPO receptor agonists
The overall encouraging results of clinical work with
recombinant thrombopoietins spurred development of new
thrombopoietic agents that were not immunogenic and
might have improved properties, such as oral administration
(Table 1). Out of these efforts have come two TPO receptor
agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag [11, 12, 62–64].
Romiplostim
In 1994, Cwirla used a random peptide library to screen for
peptides that bound to an immobilized 484 amino acid
extracellular domain of the TPO receptor [65, 66]. A core
consensus peptide was identified that had no homology with
endogenous TPO and this was further modified to enhance
its binding to the TPO receptor. The 14 amino acid peptide
(IEGPTLRQWLAARA) thus created had a high-binding
affinity for the TPO receptor and when dimerized by a balanine bridge created a dimeric peptide that was *4,000-
fold more active, comparable to that of recombinant TPO in
stimulating the growth of a TPO-dependent cell line.
The key attributes of this peptide construct were its
unique sequence and its dimeric structure. The former
attribute was expected to reduce its immunogenicity since
it had no sequence homology with endogenous TPO. The
latter attribute would replicate the two different TPO
receptor binding sites on TPO and allow it to activate the
TPO receptor.

Unfortunately, such peptide constructs have a very short
circulatory half-life which markedly limits their in vivo
activity [65]. Efforts to prolong the half-life of this peptide
were undertaken, the most efficient of which was to insert a
pair of these dimeric peptides into the carboxy terminus of
each arm of an IgG1 heavy chain, creating what is called a
‘‘peptibody’’ [66]. Crucial aspects of design of this peptibody were to optimize the lengths of the polyglycine
spacers that separate the dimeric peptides as well as the
lengths of the polyglycine spacers that then join them to the
IgG heavy chain.
This is the origin of romiplostim (AMP-2, AMG-531,
Nplate) (Fig. 3). The 14-amino acid peptide has no
sequence homology with native TPO hoping to minimize
the autoantibody risk of prior recombinant products.
Romiplostim binds to the TPO receptor just like endogenous TPO but with one-fourth the affinity (Li et al. 2001,
unpublished results) and competes with endogenous TPO
for binding [67]. Like other IgG molecules, romiplostim is
internalized by the FcRn receptor on endothelial cells,
protected from degradation and recycled back into the
circulation, producing a circulatory half-life of some
120–140 h [68].
In studies in vitro and in vivo, romiplostim has the same
mechanism of action as does recombinant TPO. Romiplostim stimulates the growth of Meg-CFC, increases the
number, size, and ploidy of megakaryocytes [67], and can
enhance the production of platelets in an in vitro culture
system [69].
After a single subcutaneous romiplostim dose is
administered to healthy volunteers, there is the typical
platelet count response seen with all TPO molecules: there
is no increase until Day 5, after which there is a dosedependent rise in platelet count that peaks on Days 12–14,
followed by a decline to baseline by Day 28[68]. There is a
linear dose–response relationship between the dose of
romiplostim and the increase in the platelet count, with a
maximum platelet count eightfold baseline occurring at a
dose of 10 lg/kg.
The clinical pharmacology of romiplostim has been
well studied and is summarized in Table 2. Romiplostim
is recycled by the FcRn receptor on endothelial cells and
terminally cleared by the reticuloendothelial system.
There is no known effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction
on its half-life or function. Its half-life is 120–140 h
independent of whether given by intravenous or subcutaneous routes; it is only formulated for subcutaneous
administration. Given the fact that it can cross the placenta by the FcRn receptor, its use in pregnancy is not
suggested. Romiplostim is formulated in 250- and 500-lg
vials each containing 375 or 625 lg of romiplostim,
respectively. When reconstituted, it is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 1–10 lg/kg weekly for the
treatment of ITP [70].
The current romiplostim prescribing information for
treating ITP recommends a starting dose of 1 lg/kg to be
increased by 1 lg/kg weekly to a maximum of 10 lg/kg
weekly in order to attain a target platelet count
50–250 9 109
/L. It is also recommended that the weekly
dose be held if the platelet count exceeds 400 9 109
/L. It is
the opinion and experience of this author that these two
recommendations are inappropriate and may adversely
affect patient safety. Since the effective average dose of

romiplostim in most studies was 4–5 lg/kg [45, 71–73],
this author recommends starting at 3 lg/kg in most settings
and increasing by 2 lg/kg weekly until the desired platelet
count is attained. In more urgent settings even higher
starting doses, including the maximal dose of 10 lg/kg,
may be used to determine rapidly if this agent will be
effective in the patient. In addition, holding romiplostim
for platelet counts over 400 9 109
/L is not recommended;
it may result in a rapid and potentially dangerous decrease
in platelet count within a week. This author has commonly
seen platelet counts drop from 1,000 9 109
/L to 3 9 109/L
in under a week when weekly dosing was held. Instead of
holding the dose, this author recommends a dose decrease
of 25–50 % if the platelet count rises to over 400 9 109
/L.
When the platelet count rise is associated with corticosteroid administration, no dose change is recommended;
corticosteroids synergize strongly all TPO receptor agonists. For extreme elevations of platelets over 800 9 109
/L,
this author routinely administers aspirin 81 mg daily.
Eltrombopag
High throughput screening for small molecules that stimulate the TPO receptor identified a number of non-peptide
chemical agents that bind and activate this receptor. A
number of hydrazinonaphthalene derivatives [74–77] were
initially identified and these lead compounds were modified to enhance their pharmacologic and biologic properties
[78, 79]. One molecule which evolved from this process
was eltrombopag (SB-497115, Promacta, Revolade). This
is a 442 Da molecule that is administered orally once daily
(Fig. 4).
A major difficulty in developing eltrombopag was the
fact that it does not have any biological activity in species
other than humans and chimpanzees [80]. Assessment of
the reason for this species specificity has identified an
interesting mechanism of action for eltrombopag. At residue 499 in the transmembrane region of the TPO receptor
of humans and chimpanzees there is a histidine, whereas all
other species have a leucine. If one converts the histidine to
a leucine in the human receptor, there is no response to
eltrombopag. Conversely, if one changes the murine
receptor leucine to a histidine, the cell now responds to
eltrombopag. The threonine in position 496 is also unique
in humans and chimpanzees and may also be important. It
therefore appears that eltrombopag binds to the transmembrane region of the TPO receptor and activates it by a
mechanism different from that of recombinant TPO or
romiplostim [12].
There are a number of important implications of the
finding that eltrombopag activates the TPO receptor different from recombinant TPO or romiplostim (Fig. 2).
• Eltrombopag does not compete with thrombopoietin for
binding to the distal cytokine homology region of the
TPO receptor; both molecules can potentially bind the
same receptor, but at different locations. In both in vitro
and in vivo settings, the effects of eltrombopag are
additive to the effects of thrombopoietin (Fig. 5) [81].
This may be clinically relevant in that it might predict
Fig. 4 Eltrombopag structure. Eltrombopag [30-{N’-[1-(3,4-
dimethyl-phenyl)-3-methyl-5-oxo-1,5-dihydropyrazol-4-ylidene]hydrazino}-20
-hydroxybiphenyl-3-carboxylic acid] has an acidic (COOH)
group at one end, lipophilic (CH3) groups at the other end, and a metal
chelate group in the center that creates a potent, orally available TPO
non-peptide agonist. (Courtesy of Dr. Richard J. Frankovitch and
Julian Jenkins, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA.)
Fig. 5 Eltrombopag effect is additive to that of rhTPO. Growth of a
TPO-dependent cell line is measured by the incorporation of 3
Hthymidine into DNA. At maximal doses the stimulatory effect of
eltrombopag is less than that of rhTPO; however, together there is an
additive effect. Redrawn from data in Erickson-Miller et al. [81]

activity of eltrombopag in situations (e.g., myeloablative chemotherapy) where endogenous TPO levels are
already high and in which adding more recombinant
TPO or romiplostim might have not have additional
benefit [82].
• Eltrombopag activates signal transduction pathways differently than TPO or romiplostim [83]. Eltrombopag is a
much weaker stimulator of JAK and STAT phosphorylation. Eltrombopag does not activate the AKT pathway at
all, unlike recombinant TPO or romiplostim.
• Eltrombopag does not potentiate platelet activation by
platelet agonists such as ADP in standard aggregometry
experiments, probably due to the altered signal transduction pathways mentioned above [83]. Although
probably not clinically relevant, TPO and romiplostim
both reduce by 50 % the concentration of agonist
necessary to activate platelets [84].
When the maximal dose of 75 mg is administered daily
to healthy humans for 10 days, eltrombopag produces a
maximal dose-dependent rise in platelet counts of
150 9 109
/L over baseline [85]. This is one-eighth of the
maximal effect produced by romiplostim in healthy subjects, but to date this lower potency has not translated into
any difference in clinical response.
The clinical pharmacology of eltrombopag has been
well studied (Table 3). Data from 568 subjects that showed
that oral administration results in a peak concentration in
2–6 h and excretion half-life of 21–32 h [86]. Sixty percent
is hepatically metabolized and 31 % is renally excreted.
Plasma levels, therefore, increase in proportion to the
reduction in hepatic function. The effects of renal insufficiency have not been studied, but this investigator has not
noticed any difference in effect in ITP patients who are on
dialysis.
A number of pharmacologic interactions need to be
taken into consideration when using eltrombopag. The
plasma concentration of eltrombopag is decreased by
*70 % by the presence of divalent cations such as calcium. Eltrombopag inhibits the organic anion transporting
peptide OATP1B1; this results in the need to decrease the
dose of other concomitant medications metabolized by that
pathway, such as statins. Finally, the eltrombopag AUC is
70–80 % higher in patients of East Asian ancestry mandating a decreased starting dose for such patients.
Eltrombopag is formulated as eltrombopag olamine in
pill sizes of 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg to be taken orally
once a day. For ITP patients, the starting dose is 50 mg
(25 mg if East Asian or if significant hepatic insufficiency).
Eltrombopag is taken on an empty stomach 1 h before or
2 h after a meal with no divalent cations being coadministered within 4 h. Finally, since approximately 13 % of
patients developed mild liver function abnormalities,
occasional liver function tests are warranted [87].
Clinical development of TPO receptor agonists
Both eltrombopag and romiplostim are currently approved
by many regulatory agencies worldwide for the treatment
of thrombocytopenia in ITP patients who failed splenectomy or those unable to undergo that procedure. This is
based upon a large number of clinical trials that have
shown that the administration of either TPO receptor
agonist increases the platelet count (Fig. 6), decreases the
need for rescue medications, decreases the need for other
ITP therapies such as corticosteroids, may avoid the need
for splenectomy, improves the quality of life, and markedly
decreases the rate of bleeding [45, 71, 87–89].
Pediatric ITP patients respond to TPO receptor agonists
as well as, if not better than, adult ITP patients [90]. Given
the fact that many pediatric ITP patients require therapy
only for a short period of time, this might become a standard of care for this patient group since the risk profile of
these agents over this short timeframe is well understood.
Eltrombopag has also recently been approved in the
United States for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to
hepatitis C infection in patients who are undergoing antiviral treatment. This is based upon clinical trials showing
that eltrombopag increased the platelet count of such

patients, reduced the subsequent extent of thrombocytopenia on anti-viral treatment, and allowed most patients to
continue antiviral therapy that would otherwise not have
been possible [91].
Treatment with TPO receptor agonists has also been
studied in a wide range of other thrombocytopenic conditions. As discussed elsewhere in this compendium, eltrombopag increased not only the platelet count but also
sometimes other lineages when given to aplastic anemia
patients [92]. Doses were often higher than those used to
treat ITP. Considering that endogenous TPO levels in these
patients were already elevated 10–20 fold above normal, it
is unclear how eltrombopag is working. Since eltrombopag
enhances the effect of TPO in vitro [81], it is possible that
it is doing so in vivo; or there is a totally different mechanism of action which has not yet been uncovered.
Eltrombopag increased the platelet count in 11 of 12
patients with myosin heavy chain-9 (MYH9)-related
thrombocytopenia. Although this condition is not one that
commonly causes significant hemorrhage, the bleeding
tendency disappeared in 8 of 10 subjects with bleeding at
baseline [93, 94].
A major focus of the first generation recombinant
thrombopoietins was chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. This still remains an area of interest for the TPO
receptor agonists, but no major study has yet been reported.
A number of small studies have shown modest improvement in platelet counts with the administration of either
romiplostim or eltrombopag [95–98]. None of these studies
is large enough or sufficiently well constructed to allow a
clear message. Since both TPO receptor agonists function
like the earlier recombinant thrombopoietins, this author
believes that adequate studies will eventually be done to
demonstrate that TPO receptor agonists will increase the
nadir platelet count, decrease the need for platelet transfusions and allow for chemotherapy to be given at full dose
and on schedule.
Adverse events, observed and potential
Table 4 lists the observed and potential adverse consequences of eltrombopag and romiplostim. Almost all these
data come from ITP patients studied in two recent longterm safety studies [71, 87].

Observed adverse events
Rebound worsening of thrombocytopenia In ITP patients,
the platelet count usually returns to its prior baseline upon
discontinuation of TPO receptor agonists [45, 89]. However, in approximately 10 % of such patients the platelet
count drops below its prior baseline for 1–3 weeks before
going back up to baseline [45]. This rebound worsening of
thrombocytopenia is of concern and despite statements in
the prescribing information for both drugs that drug should
be held when the platelet count rises over 400 9 109
/L,
this author cautions against this recognizing that the
platelet count may abruptly decline to below 10 9 109
/L
within 5–7 days and expose some patients to a major
bleeding risk. Rather, this author suggests that the dose be
reduced by 25–50 % in this setting. Even though there is no
evidence that an elevated platelet count is harmful in this
setting, for extreme platelet count elevations to over
800 9 109
/L occasionally seen, this author will often
administer aspirin 81 mg daily. This concern of rebound
thrombocytopenia applies only to ITP patients.
Increased bone marrow reticulin In acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with rhTPO, eight patients developed increased reticulin but this disappeared in all within a
month of drug discontinuation [99]. In animals exposed to
romiplostim, there was a dose-dependent rise in reticulin
which disappeared after 1 month off romiplostim [100]. In
clinical studies of romiplostim [71, 100], only 38 of 292
patients had a bone marrow examination, 11 of which had
increased reticulin. When compared to the 27 patients
without increased reticulin, these 11 had no chromosomal
abnormalities, less response to therapy, and a higher rate of
splenectomy. In two patients who had subsequent bone
marrow biopsies off drug, the reticulin disappeared. In an
ongoing 3-year prospective bone marrow study of ITP
patients being treated with romiplostim, at the 1-year time
point, there was no increase in collagen (trichrome) staining and only 2/38 had increased reticulin (but still within
the normal range) [101].
In a study of 110 ITP patients treated with eltrombopag
for a median 18 months and who had 156 evaluable bone
marrow examinations, 152/156 (97.4 %) lacked any
increased reticulin; only 4 (2.6 %) biopsies from 3 patients
showed increased reticulin and 3 biopsies (from the same
three patients) also showed increased collagen [102]. Of
the 3 patients, 2 discontinued eltrombopag and 1 had a
marrow examination done 7 months later that was normal.
The third patient continued on therapy despite having
increased collagen and reticulin fibrosis. A prospective,
2-year bone marrow study is ongoing to assess bone marrow fibrosis [103].
Thrombocytosis Both eltrombopag and romiplostim can
promote thrombocytosis with platelet counts sometimes
rising to over 1,000 9 109
/L. In other clinical settings,
there is no evidence that thrombocytosis is associated with
thrombotic risk, even in patients with myeloproliferative
diseases. As mentioned above, the prescribing information
suggests holding either drug if platelet counts are over
400 9 109
/L, but this is based on no clinical data suggesting a detrimental outcome, including thrombosis (vide
infra).
Stimulation of growth of leukemic blasts A new concern
for TPO receptor agonists has come from a recent study of
romiplostim in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients
with IPSS low/intermediate-1 risk MDS, with platelet
counts less than 20 9 109
/L or 50 9 109/L, were given
romiplostim 750 weekly (167 patients) versus placebo (83
patients) [104]. A platelet response was seen in 37 % of
patients given romiplostim and less than 4 % of patients on
placebo. Bleeding was modestly reduced from 27 % in
placebo to 19 % in romiplostim patients while transfusion
events decreased from 1014 to 749 per 100 patient-weeks.
But this study was stopped early because 6 % (10/167) of
patients receiving romiplostim versus 4.8 % (4/83) of
placebo patients showed a possible progression to AML.
Unfortunately, the conversion to leukemia was not documented by marrow examination. Of equal concern was the
effect on the percentage of patients with circulating blasts
over 10 %; this occurred in 15 % of romiplostim patients
versus 3.6 % of placebo patients. However, upon discontinuing the romiplostim, 20 of the 28 showed no progression of AML. These studies do provide pause for the use of
either TPO receptor agonist in patients with MDS. What is
of some interest, however, is the fact that the first generation TPO agents were given to patients with acute leukemia with no apparent affect upon their remission or
relapse rates [7].
Reduction in threshold for platelet activation Romiplostim does reduce by 50 % the threshold for platelet activation by weak agonists such as ADP in standard platelet
aggregometry studies [50]. Eltrombopag lacks this effect
[83]. Whether this is important clinically or not is unclear,
but to date there has been no increased risk of thrombosis
with this agent. rhTPO and PEG-rhMGDF produced
identical effects but in several animal models of thrombosis, no increased thrombotic effect was noted [50].
Potential adverse events
Thrombosis In placebo-controlled ITP trials, thrombosis
has not been an issue with either TPO receptor agonist. The
thrombosis rate with romiplostim in ITP patients is
approximately 0.09 events per 100 patient-weeks which is
identical to the 0.10 events per 100 patient-weeks seen with
placebo [45]. With long-term romiplostim treatment, the
thrombosis rate is 0.08 events per 100 patient-weeks [71].
Biology of TPO and TPO receptor agonists 19
123

In those with thrombosis, there was no association with the
platelet count; thrombosis occurred at platelet counts as
low as 6 9 109
/L and as high as 1,359 9 109/L. Identical
results have come from recent long-term analyses of eltrombopag which have shown no relationship of thrombosis with platelet count [87].
This data should be evaluated in the context of the
recent understanding that ITP is a prothrombotic disorder
with a rate of thrombosis that is approximately 1.41 times
that of a comparable non-ITP patient population matched
for age and gender [105]. Cumulative rates as high as
6.9 % over a 15-month period have been reported in adults
[106] and a recent Danish registry showed a relative risk of
2.65 over a control population without ITP [107].
The only possible exception comes from data in chronic
liver disease patients receiving eltrombopag to increase the
platelet count in preparation for surgical procedures [108].
Although baseline vascular assessments were unfortunately
not done, 6/145 patients receiving eltrombopag and 1/147
patients receiving placebo developed symptomatic portal
vein thrombosis. However, some patients had other risk
factors for thrombosis, such as the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Stimulation of growth of solid tumors The recent concern that EPO may stimulate tumor cell growth is probably
not a risk for TPO receptor agonists. The TPO receptor is
not found on non-hematological solid tumors [31]. In a
large number of solid tumor chemotherapy studies with
rhTPO and PEG-rhMGDF there was no enhancement of
tumor growth [7].
Antibody formation Antibody formation was a major
concern with the recombinant TPO, PEG-rhMGDF [10, 34].
To date no antibodies have been formed against eltrombopag, and only two patients have developed non-neutralizing
antibody against romiplostim [71]. Indeed, these two antibodies were identified within the first 100 patients treated
with romiplostim and the antibody disappeared at later
evaluation with no apparent effect on the platelet count.
Subsequently no antibodies have been identified.
Stem cell depletion This theoretical concern has also
been raised after long-term administration of erythropoietin
and G-CSF, but has not been reported. Indeed, families
with overexpression of the TPO gene have not shown any
evidence for stem cell depletion [109, 110].
Interactions with other cytokines or hematopoietic
growth factors This has not been observed.
