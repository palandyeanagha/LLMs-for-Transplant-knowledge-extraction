Abstract
Background: Fungal mural endocarditis is a rare entity in which the antemortem diagnosis is
seldom made. Seven cases of mural endocarditis caused by Candida spp. have been collected from
literature and six of these patients died after treatment with amphotericin B.
Case presentation: We report a case of mural endocarditis diagnosed by transesophageal
echocardiogram and positive blood cultures to Candida parapsilosis. Because blood cultures
continued to yield C. parapsilosis despite caspofungin monotherapy, treatment with voriconazole
was added.
Conclusion: This is the first description of successful treatment of C. parapsilosis mural
endocarditis with caspofungin and voriconazole.
Background
Fungal endocarditis has increased in incidence during the
last 2 decades. In a review of 152 cases of fungal endocarditis reported between 1995 and 2002 [1], Candida species were recovered in 94.1% of yeast infections and
Aspergillus species in 71.8% of mold infections. Mural
endocarditis is inflammation and disruption of the nonvalvular endocardial surface of the cardiac chambers. Its
presentation is remarkably similar to that of infective valvular endocarditis. Risk factors for mural endocarditis
include chronic debilitating disease, immunosuppression, intravenous drug use, central venous catheterization,
prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and repeated surgery. The pathogenesis of mural involvement has been ascribed to hematogenous seeding or
direct extension of myocardial abscesses [1]. Mural endocarditis has been reported in the setting of infected mural
thrombi or aneurysms, jet lesions from ventricular septal
defects and idiopathic hyperthrophic subaortic stenosis

Kearney et al. [3] collected 52 patients with mural endocarditis in three autopsy studies and five case reports. Most
of these cases corresponded to bacterial mural endocarditis. Fungal mural endocarditis is usually diagnosed in
immunocompromised hosts or in patients with predisposing underlying conditions [3]. However, the antemortem diagnosis is seldom made. Aspergillus mural
endocarditis has been diagnosed in small series of
patients [4-7] but mural endocarditis caused by Candida
spp. has been exceptionally reported [8,9]. We present a
case of Candida parapsilosis mural endocarditis cured by
combined treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole.
Case presentation
A 59-year-old woman had a 13-year history of biopsy
proven alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and
fever. A diagnosis of biliary acute pancreatitis was established. Twenty days after admission, the patient's condition deteriorated. A new dynamic abdominal computed
tomography (CT) scan showed an increase of peripancreatic fluid collections and necrosis of approximately 80%
of the gland. A CT-guided fine needle biopsy yielded a
positive culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus and enterobacteriacea. The patient was treated
empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam and received
total parenteral nutrition via a subclavian central venous
catheter. Surgical treatment consisted of cholecystectomy,
sequestrectomy of necrotic pancreatic tissue, and extensive debridement. Antibiotic treatment was continued for
23 more days, although intravenous fluconazole was
added and given for 14 days due to oropharyngeal candidiasis.
The clinical course was complicated by a new episode of
abdominal pain and a second operation to drain large
fluid collections of the retroperitoneal space was performed. Events during the immediate postoperative
period were as follows: 1) treatment with meropenem and
teicoplanin was started but fever reappeared, 2) ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-sensitive S.
aureus, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, and Candida
parapsilosis were documented on intraoperative and drainage cultures, 3) peripheral blood cultures were positive for
C. parapsilosis, 4) a subclavian catheter was removed and
another central venous catheter was inserted into a different site, and 5) culture of the subclavian catheter tip was
also positive for C. parapsilosis. The minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) for the C. parapsilosis isolate were
as follows: flucytosine, 0.125 µg/mL; amphotericin B,
0.25 µg/mL; ketoconazole, 0.25 µg/mL; fluconazole, 4 µg/
mL; and voriconazole, 0.06 µg/mL. On the 5th postoperative day, meropenem was discontinued and intravenous
fluconazole, 400 mg/12 h, was initiated. The patient's
clinical condition improved. Transthoracic echocardiograms performed 24 hours and 14 days after the onset of
treatment with fluconazole were unrevealing. Eye funduscopy was repeatedly negative.
On the 17th postoperative day, the temperature rose to
>38.5°C, the serum C reactive protein concentration
increased (>200 mg/L), and peripheral blood cultures
grew C. parapsilosis. Antifungal treatment with intravenous
caspofungin was started (a 70-mg loading dose and then
50 mg daily). A transesophageal echocardiogram showed
a mobile, echodense, filamentous image (35 × 10 mm)
near the basal part of the interventricular septum, protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract (Figure 1).
Myocardial abscesses were not observed. Neither valve
involvement nor other intracardiac lesions were observed.
Using modified Duke clinical criteria, we diagnosed definite mural endocarditis on the basis of 2 major criteria
(repeatedly positive blood cultures for C. parapsilosis and
an echocardiogram finding positive for endocarditis).
Heart surgery was not indicated due to the lack of valvular
involvement and the patient's poor clinical condition
related to severe pancreatitis, previous abdominal operations, renal dysfunction, and hemodynamic instability.
The central venous catheter was replaced and culture of
the tip was negative. However, 48 hours after the onset of
treatment with caspofungin, serial blood cultures continued to yield C. parapsilosis. The serum creatinine clearance
was 40 mL/min (normal range 60–120 mL/min) and
because of the persistence of fungemia, 72 hours after
starting caspofungin therapy, intravenous voriconazole at
a dosage of 6 mg/kg/12 h followed by 4 mg/kg/12 h was
added. Remarkably, the patient's clinical condition
improved and fever subsided. Three days after the combined administration of caspofungin and voriconazole, a

negative blood culture was obtained for the first time.
Subsequent blood cultures were consistently negative.
Serial follow-up transesophageal and transthoracic
echocardiograms showed complete resolution of the fungal vegetation without significant aortic valve regurgitation. Treatment with caspofungin was maintained for 60
days. The patient was discharged on oral voriconazole
(400 mg/day), which was given for 9 additional months.
Oral voriconazole was well tolerated. In November 2005,
16 months after discharge from the hospital, she was
asymptomatic without any evidence of infection.
This patient with C. parapsilosis mural endocarditis was
cured by combined treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole. The outcomes for patients with fungal mural
endocarditis have been extremely poor [8]. In the 7 cases
of mural endocarditis caused by Candida spp. previously
reported in the literature, 6 patients died after treatment
with amphotericin B [8-10] and the only survivor was
treated with combined azole therapy (alternating miconazole and fluconazole) and excision of the two mobile
pedunculated masses in the right ventricle [11]. These
patients had a mean age of 31 years. Risk factors for mural
endocarditis included acute myelocytic leukemia in 5
patients, immunosuppressive treatment for systemic
lupus erythematosus in 1, and major abdominal surgery
with total parenteral nutrition in 1. The lesion was located
in the right ventricle in 6 patients and in the left ventricle
in the remaining case. Microbiologic investigation yielded
Candida albicans in 2 cases, and C. parapsilosis, Candida
krusei and Candida tropicalis in one case each; in 2 patients,
the species of Candida was not identified. Prolonged use
of central venous catheter was probably the implicated
cause of hematogenous candidiasis and seeding of the
endocardium. Intracardiac catheters can produce
endothelial damage and predispose usually right-sided
endocarditis. The mechanism of direct traumatization of
the endocardium by the catheter makes central venous
catheter-induced endocarditis bear pathophysiologic similarity to the experimental model of endocarditis in animals [12]. In our patient, the central venous catheter was
located in the upper vena cava and mural endocarditis was
in the left ventricle. Infections with C. parapsilosis are more
frequently the cause of catheter-related infections than all
other Candida species combined [13]. On the other hand,
the role of C. parapsilosis as a nosocomial pathogen associated with invasive devices and parenteral nutrition has
been emphasized [14]. Characteristics of C. parapsilosis
that may relate to its increasing occurrence in nosocomial
settings include frequent colonization of the subungual
space and an ability to proliferate in glucose-containing
solutions, with a resultant increase in adherence to synthetic materials.
Our patient was not medically fit for heart surgery and was
successfully treated with 8 weeks of intravenous caspofungin, although voriconazole was added due to persistence
of positive blood cultures. Caspofungin has MICs somewhat higher for C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii,
although the clinical significance is unclear [15]. This
might explain the persistence of positive blood cultures
48 hours after the beginning of treatment with caspofungin. Ten previous cases of Candida endocarditis treated
with caspofungin have been reported [16,17], four of
which cured without cardiac surgery [17-20].
In our patient, combination therapy with caspofungin
and voriconazole was an alternative to caspofungin monotherapy because of the persistence of positive blood cultures and the presence of renal insufficiency. On the other
hand, continued fungemia at 3 days after the onset of
caspofungin therapy cannot be considered that caspofungin was a failure, but given the known effect of grater MIC
for C. parapsilosis, voriconazole was added without waiting for a possible resolution of candidemia. Voriconazole
is a new triazole antifungal, while caspofungin is the first
echinocandin antifungal. Voriconazole acts by inhibiting
the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane.
Caspofungin inhibits beta-1,3-D-glucan synthesis in the
cell wall, a target present in fungal cells, and has shown
excellent activity against Candida biofilm [21] as opposed
to poor penetration of voriconazole [22,23]. Both agents
are broad-spectrum, with efficacy against invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections. The efficacy of the antifungal
combination therapy with caspofungin and voriconazole
has been documented in a few case reports of invasive
aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies
[24,25] and in a small series of patients with endogenous
Candida endophthalmitis [26]. To our knowledge, the
present report is the first description of successful treatment of C. parapsilosis mural endocarditis with caspofungin and voriconazole. Although relapsing endocarditis
seems unlikely, the patient has been followed for less than
2 years and late relapse is still possible.
Conclusion
In this paper, we firstly reported a non-operated patient
with mural endocarditis by C. parapsilosis cured with a
combination of caspofungin and voriconazole. The combination of these potent antifungal agents opens new perspectives in the management of severely ill patients with
invasive fungal infection.
