Abstract
Purpose
To compare anthropometric data (body mass index [BMI]) in patients without lithiasis to
patients with symptomatic simple cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed data from 147 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy between 2001–2015. Complete growth data from 98 patients was compared with
anthropometric data from the population of the Czech Republic and a control group (BMI of
100 consecutive patients without biliary stones in abdominal ultrasound who were admitted
to a surgical department for suspected appendicitis).
Results
The BMI of 75 children with simple cholelithiasis and 23 with choledocholithiasis was compared to the standard Czech pediatric population and to the control group. The median age
(simple cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis) was 16 years, and 35 patients (24%) had a
family history of gallstones. Types of lithiasis included multiple (n = 120), solitary (n = 11),
and sludge (n = 10). Five cases had polyps and one had gallbladder dysplasia. Patients with
simple cholelithiasis had significantly higher BMI compared to the control group without cholelithiasis (p<0.0001) and the standard Czech population (p = 0.03). Patients with choledocholithiasis had a mean BMI significantly higher than that of the general population (p =
0.001) and the control group (p = 0.0001). Patients with choledocholithiasis had significantly
higher BMI than those with simple cholelithiasis (p = 0.03).

Conclusion
Patients with cholelithiasis had significantly higher BMI than the general population, and
patients with choledocholithiasis had significantly higher BMI than patients with simple lithiasis. Elevated BMI is a risk factor for developing choledocholithiasis. ERCP and early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with choledocholithiasis offer equivalent outcomes in
patients with simple cholelithiasis.
Introduction
Cholelithiasis in children is a rare disease with a prevalence between 0.13 and 0.22%[1]. The
main risk factor for cholelithiasis is most likely obesity, and the increased incidence of childhood obesity is becoming alarming [2]. Cholelithiasis is also detected more frequently than in
previous years because of the increased use of ultrasound [3].
Nowadays, we focus our attention not only on the rising number of diagnosed cases of
infantile cholelithiasis and its operative treatment, but also on the type of cholelithiasis, its possible complications, and the incidence of obesity, specifically the elevation of body mass index
(BMI). Therefore, we evaluated anthropometric data from patients with simple cholelithiasis
and those with choledocholithiasis and compared them with the general population. We also
performed an analysis of long-term results after laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to simple
cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis after an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).
Materials and methods
All patients with cholelithiasis who were operated on via a laparoscopic approach at our
Department of Pediatric Surgery between 2001–2015 were included in a retrospective single
center analysis. The height and weight were measured in each patient on devices of a standard
calibration of known accuracy upon their admission to our department by experienced nurses.
All our operated patients had lithiasis confirmed by ultrasound examination. Patients with primary asymptomatic cholelithiasis who had gallstones diagnosed by ultrasound as accidental
findings were managed conservatively and treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (dose 10–20 mg/
kg/day). Its administration changes the composition of bile and should dissolve gallstones: this
conservative therapy was believed to be successful in some patients [4]. However, litholysis
using oral bile acids is no longer recommended according to the latest European guidelines
published in 2016 due to findings based on adult patients who exhibited low rates of cure and
high risk of gallbladder stone recurrence [5]. These asymptomatic patients were followed clinically with examinations approximately twice a year. From the year 2016 administration of bile
acids was no longer used.
Cholecystectomy was indicated in patients who underwent at least one episode of biliary
colic or had complicated cholelithiasis (cholecystitis or patients after an ERCP due to
choledocholithiasis).
Patients with simple cholelithiasis were operated on electively. Patients who had an ERCP
due to choledocholithiasis were indicated for early laparoscopic cholecystectomy immediately
after their liver enzymes and amylase decreased during the same hospital visit.
The surgical procedure consisted of a four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy under CO2
pneumoperitoneum.

that no competing interests exist.

ERCP in children was performed by skilled adult endoscopists under general anesthesia
and X-ray navigation. A standard adult diagnostic and therapeutic lateroscope (Olympus
JF140 R, TJF 160) or special paediatric lateroscope (Olympus PJF 160) were used. Paediatric
lateroscope is mandatory in infants younger than 12 months and is preferred for children
younger than three years (Fig 1).
The data of the cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis group were statistically evaluated and
compared with the general population by a clinical anthropologist using a statistical Student’s
T-test and the Mann-Whitney test where appropriate. A p value <0.05 was regarded as
significant.
Study data
Data from the symptomatic cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis groups were compared to a
group of 100 consecutive patients without biliary stones who were admitted to the surgical
department for suspected appendicitis and to anthropometric data of the population of the
Czech Republic (body height, weight, and BMI by means of SDS (Standard Deviation Score)
according to the latest available Czech standards (VI. Nationwide anthropological survey
2001) [6]. The BMI values were related to the percentile growth charts.
The study design was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Second Medical Faculty,
Charles University, Prague.
Results
Patient characteristics
Over the 15-year period (2001–2015), 147 patients underwent cholecystectomy via a laparoscopic approach. The median age was 16 years (range, 15 months to 18 years 11 months, Fig
2). There were 103 girls (70%) and 44 boys (30%), and 35 patients (24%) had a family history
of gallstones (Table 1).
The comorbidities of our study group included hereditary spherocytosis (n = 7), cystic
fibrosis (n = 1), scleroderma (n = 1), ganglioneuroblastoma (n = 1), oncological diseases after
chemotherapy treatment (n = 5; 1 each of myelodysplastic syndrome, pelvic osteosarcoma,
orbital myelosarcoma, nephroblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia). Further comorbidities
were congenital heart disease (n = 3), pancreas divisum (n = 1), Crohn disease (n = 1), Hirschsprung disease (n = 1), epilepsy (n = 2), thyroiditis (n = 2), and celiac disease (n = 1).
Ninety five patients (64.6%) had simple cholelithiasis (i.e., underwent an episode of biliary
colic). Fifty two patients (35.4%) had choledocholithiasis; these patients underwent an ERCP
due to clinical, laboratory, or ultrasound signs of bile duct obstruction. Fifteen patients
(10.2%) had serious acute biliary pancreatitis.
Anthropometric data
Complete growth data (height, weight, and BMI) were obtained for 98 patients from our study
group after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The control group consisted of 100 consecutive patients without cholelithiasis admitted to
the department of pediatric surgery with suspicion of appendicitis. The median age of this
group was 16 years (range 10 to 18 years). There were 57 girls (57%) and 43 boys (43%), with a
mean BMI of 18.54 ± 3.1 kg/m2 (range 12.6 to 28.0 kg/m2
).
Patients with simple cholelithiasis (n = 75) had a mean BMI of 21.5 ± 4. 8 kg/m2 (range
13.6 to 40.1 kg/m2
), SDS of 0.43 ± 1.43 kg/m2, which was significantly higher compared to the
general population (p = 0.03) (Table 2) and to the control group (BMI 18.54 ± 3.1 kg/m2

p<0.0001) (Table 3, Fig 3). Patients with choledocholithiasis who underwent an ERCP (n =
23) had a mean BMI significantly higher than that of the general population (BMI 23.3 ± 5.4
kg/m2
; range 13.9 to 36.8 kg/m2; SDS 1.1 ± 1.26 kg/m2, p = 0.001) (Table 2) and also higher
compared to our control group (BMI 18.54 ± 3.1 kg/m2
, p = 0.0001) (Table 3, Fig 4). Comparing the simple cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis (with ERCP) groups, patients with choledocholithiasis had significantly higher mean BMI (p = 0.03). All p values were statistically
significant.
Surgical complications and outcome
The conversion rate into laparotomy was 2% (n = 3), including one conversion due to the presence of multiple adhesions where the surgical team was not able to isolate the cystic duct safely.
Another conversion was due to advanced fibrosis of the Callot triangle and the last one because
of significant bleeding from the gallbladder bed.
There was no need to perform intraoperative cholangiography. Obesity did not have an
affect on operative parameters.
We used Redon drain in 37 patients (25%). The drain was always extracted between the
first and second postoperative day. Our use of drains has been steadily decreasing during the
years of our study period due to our improving confidence with the laparoscopic technique.
The average length of hospital stay after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 3.9 days. Mean
time to first feeding was 19 hours. Neither the average length of hospital stay nor the mean
time to first feeding differed in both the simple cholecystolithiasis and the choledocholithiasis
group. The recovery was similar in both groups.

Pathologic examination revealed important chronic cystitis (with a presence of fibrosis,
lymphocytes, intraepithelial neutrophils and entrapped epithelial crypts) in 11 cases (7.5%).
The types of lithiasis were: multiple (n = 120, 81.6%), solitary (n = 11, 7.5%), and sludge
(n = 10, 6.8%). Polyps were found in 5 cases (3.4%), dysplasia of gallbladder in one (0.7%).
Complications occured in 2.7% of patients (n = 4). During the postoperative period we
noticed one severe bleeding into the Redon drain (it was a patient who had undergone early
cholecystectomy after ERCP due to choledocholithiasis), but we managed to treat it conservatively with blood transfusion. There were two cases of wound dehiscence in our study group
(both in patients with simple cholelithiasis) and one girl who had to undergo an ERCP 3 years
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to the development of choledocholithiasis. The ERCP
had not been performed on this girl before.
The postoperative evolution in all cases was favourable, no major morbidity was observed
nor did any deaths occur in our group (0% mortality).
We found no differences in outcomes for patients with simple cholelithiasis versus those
with choledocholithiasis (course of operation, intra- and postoperative complications, length
of hospital stay, family history, or follow-up) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Even patients
with pancreatitis did not influence the final results.
Discussion
The association between obesity and metabolic syndrome with cholelithiasis is well described
in adults. Moreover, some interesting studies concerning this relationship have been published
in the pediatric population as well. Kaechele et al. investigated the prevalence of gallbladder
stone disease in a collective of obese children who had undergone ultrasound for detection of
gallbladder stone disease. Gallbladder stones were detected in 10 of 493 obese patients in their
study (2.0%) [7]. Kobnick et al. published a large population-based cross-sectional study of
children in California aged between 10 and 19 years. They identified 766 patients with gallstones from medical records of 510,816 patients. A significantly higher incidence of cholelithiasis was seen in obese children and in girls who used oral contraceptives [8]. Fradin et al.
confirmed the relationship by comparing the rising BMI of the pediatric population with the

increasing incidence of hospitalization for cholelithiasis in New York in his retrospective casecontroled study. The study suggests that obesity is a significant risk factor for hospital admission because of cholelithiasis [9].
Our results show a significantly higher BMI in children with symptomatic cholelithiasis
compared to a control group of randomly examined children with sonographically excluded
cholelithiasis and to the Czech pediatric population according to the latest available Czech
standards (VI. Nationwide anthropological survey 2001) [6]. This result has been predicted in
a range of published studies [7,8,9]. Unexpected and yet unpublished findings show a significant correlation between BMI and the risk of choledocholithiasis in children.
Obese children with a mean BMI of 21.5 already have a significantly higher risk of choledocholithiasis compared to children with a normal BMI. However, children suffering from symptomatic cholecystoliatis with a mean BMI of 23 or more find themselves even more at risk for
development of choledocholithiasis, showing symptoms at asignificantly higher rate than both
the general and obese population.
On behalf of the results of our study we suggest that children with biliary symptoms and
cholecystolithiasis as well as unclear ultrasonography of the bile ducts with a BMI of 23 or
more should routinely undergo MRCP for exclusion or confirmation ofcholedocholithiasis.
Two possible hypotheses could explain why children with higher BMI are more likely to
develop choledocholithiasis rather than simple cholecystolithiasis. The “mechanical” hypothesis could be considered, which postulates that higher body fat content in the abdominal wall
causes greater intra-abdominal pressure, resulting in higher direct pressure on the external
wall of the gallbladder. The relatively higher pressure in the subhepatal region is thought to
cause a direct stimulus that dislodges the concrement from the gallbladder into the extrahepatic biliary tree system, finally causing obstruction of the choledochus, with predictable consequences. This explanation is limited at the point in the relationship between higher BMI and
higher intra-abdominal pressure. This relationship is well known in adult patients, but there is
no correlation between BMI and intra-abdominal pressure in pediatric patients [10–14]. This
finding weakens the “mechanical” hypothesis. Another reason for the higher incidence of choledocholithiasis in obese children should also be considered.
In the “humoral” hypothesis, the reason for a higher risk of choledocholithiasis in relation
to higher BMI may be more valid. A diet rich in fat seems to trigger several steps leading to biliary concrement formation and output into the biliary tree system. First, there is a hypersaturation of bile caused by either increased hepatic cholesterol uptake or increased de novo
cholesterol synthesis. Second, dysmotility and impaired contraction of the gallbladder is
caused by the direct influence of cholesterol at the cellular level onto the plasma membrane of
smooth muscle cells in the gallbladder wall [15]. The role of higher levels of cholecystokinin in
obese children as a major humoral stimulus for postprandial gallbladder emptying seems to be
essential in this matter [16].
From the morphological point of view, the significantly enlarged gastric antral area formed
overnight in fasting obese children provides greater gastric capacity and, secondarily, more

substrate in the hyperosmotic chyme solution, leading to more intense excretion of cholecystokinin [17]. We feel that the “humoral” hypothesis is more likely to account for the relationship
between higher BMI in children and the risk of choledocholithiasis, although the “mechanical”
hypothesis may still play a contributing role.
Another point that should be taken into account (and is well described in adults) is the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cholelithiasis. Prevalence of
cholelithiasis is significantly higher in patients with NAFLD [18]. It is expected that both
NAFLD and cholelithiasis belong to complications of insulin resistance and metabolic syndromes sharing similar pathogenic paths [19]. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in
childhood [20] and, as well as in adults, has a strong correlation to obesity and metabolic syndrome [21]. Consequences of NAFLD and cholelithiasis in childhood are plausible, but should
be confirmed by specific studies in the future.
The incidence of obesity in the pediatric population is rising in the Western World. Therefore, the incidence of symptomatic cholelithiasis is predicted to also increase. From our point
of view and in accordance with the literature, operational results after cholecystectomy are
BMI independent, and there are no differences in outcomes in children with simple cholelithiasis versus choledocholithiasis [22,23].

Conclusion
The anthropometric data confirmed that patients with cholelithiasis have a higher BMI compared to the normal population. Patients with choledocholithiasis had a significantly higher
BMI compared with children with simple cholelithiasis. Children with symptomatic cholecystolitiasis with higher BMI (values close to 23 kg/m2 and higher) have significantly higher risk
of choledocholithiasis compared to the less obese population. Nevertheless, higher BMI does
not influence post-operative outcomes.
