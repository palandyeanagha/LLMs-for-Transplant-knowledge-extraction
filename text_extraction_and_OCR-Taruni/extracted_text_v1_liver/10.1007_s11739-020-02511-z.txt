Abstract
Transplant programs have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy was one of the frst countries with the 
highest number of deaths in the world due to SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose a management model for the reorganization 
of liver transplant (LT) activities and policies in a local intensive care unit (ICU) assigned to liver transplantation afected 
by restrictions on mobility and availability of donors and recipients as well as health personnel and beds. We describe the 
solutions implemented to continue transplantation activities throughout a given pandemic: management of donors and 
recipients’ LT program, ICU rearrangement, healthcare personnel training and monitoring to minimize mortality rates of 
patients on the waiting list. Transplantation activities from February 22, 2020, the data of frst known COVID-19 case in 
Italy’s Emilia Romagna region to June 30, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. During the 2020 
study period, 38 LTs were performed, whereas 41 were performed in 2019. Patients transplanted during the COVID-19 
pandemic had higher MELD and MELD-Na scores, cold ischaemia times, and hospitalization rates (p<0.05); accordingly, 
they spent fewer days on the waitlist and had a lower prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (p<0.05). No diferences were 
found in the provenance area, additional MELD scores, age of donors and recipients, BMI, re-transplant rates, and posttransplant mortality. No transplanted patients contracted COVID-19, although fve healthcare workers did. Ultimately, our 
policy allowed us to continue the ICU’s operations by prioritizing patients hospitalized with higher MELD without any case 
of transplant infection due to COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2
Introduction
Liver transplants (LTs) in the unprecedented era of the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic is of concern. The coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) has crossed borders and infected approximately 10 million people worldwide although substantially 
more undiagnosed cases are likely [1]. The virus has proven 
difcult to contain partly due to its contagious nature and 
mild-to-nonexistent symptomatology in many cases. Nevertheless, the emergence of COVID-19 has impacted the 
transplants’ community worldwide. Local and international 
societies for the study of LTs published several surveys and 
international position papers on the transplants’ management 
during pandemic. Recommendations on COVID-19 screening of donors and recipients and transplant policies difered 
from country to country based on population infection rates 
and available diagnostic resources [2, 3]. In Italy, the frst 
native case of COVID-19 was identifed in Lombardy at the 
end of February 2020. All regions of the country have since 
registered infection from SARS-CoV-2. As of April 26 2020, 
there were 197,675 patients with COVID-19 in Italy, with 
24,450 in the Emilia Romagna region and 4156 in its capital, 
Bologna [3]. Accordingly many of ICUs in the region have 
been reassigned to COVID-19 care. When Italy’s lockdown 
ceased on May 18, cases in Emilia-Romagna had reached 
27,267; 5525 of these cases were active.
While it is admirable to guarantee treatment for COVID19 subjects, on the others, it is essential to maintain a stringent standard of care in patients with potentially lethal 
diseases. Acute or chronic liver failure, is known, to have 
high mortality rate if left untreated conversely, appropriate 
treatment often results in longer survival. In recent years, 
critically ill LT candidates and recipients have beneftted 
from specialized critical transplant care; dedicated ICUs 
improved the outcome of patients with end-stage liver failure 
and attendant critical illnesses, and improved perioperative 
management during transplantation [4]. However, resources 
needed to perform LT successfully during a pandemic can be 
in short supply, and additional challenges such as exposure 
to the virus during immunosuppressive treatment, must be 
addressed.
In an era wherein the threat of COVID-19 will remain 
a reality for the foreseeable future, we must decide how to 
prioritize and treat non-COVID-19 populations that would 
otherwise survive if ICUs were operating at standard capacity [2, 5, 6].
Transplant programs must assess the risk of donor 
transmission and the severity of disease in the recipient, 
and reduce the hazard for potential spread to healthcare 
workers [2]. This paper aims to provide data on the impact 
of COVID-19 on physicians and LT recipients in the setting of ICUs and to put forth possible clinical solutions 
and policies to mitigate the efects of the SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic on LT patients and healthcare providers.
We discuss strategies such as donor screening, resource 
planning and management of LT recipient, all within in 
the context of a global pandemic. Moreover, we described 
routine surveillance of healthcare personnel and pragmatic 
reorganization of ICUs into the hospital by closed independent divisions to reduce the risk of contagion.
Lastly, transplantation activities from February 22, 
2020, the date of the frst recorded COVID-19 case in 
Emilia Romagna to June 30, 2020, were compared with 
the corresponding period in 2019.
Methods and results
Donor management
The blood of COVID-19-infected subjects carries nucleic 
acid of the virus in up to 15% of cases. To date, however, 
there is no evidence of COVID-19 transmission from the 
donor [7].
Nevertheless, given the higher sensitivity of alveolarbronchial lavage (BAL) compared to the nasopharyngeal 
swab (NPS), in the case of a donor, the Italian Transplant 
Authority (Centro Nazionale Trapianti) recommended carrying out the specifc test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 
on respiratory secretions from BAL or possibly from deep 
broncho-aspirate, that is ofered within 24–48 h, prior to 
organ retrieval [8].
The central limit of BAL is the potential risk of healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 from the process of 
aerosolization. Since there is a risk of false negatives, 
especially in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, physicians 
are encouraged to review as much donor history as possible for fever, respiratory symptoms and radiographic fndings [6]. In addition to performing a NPS in living donor 
LTs, some countries (e.g. Japan) recommend a 14-day 
isolation period before surgery [2]. Guidelines from the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend accepting only those grafts that have a low risk 
of delayed graft function, in order to reduce complications 
and post-operative hospitalization [6]. Donors who tested 
positive for COVID-19 were ineligible for organ donation.

Recipient management
In Bologna University Hospital, all recipients underwent 
NPS before entering the operating room.
We ensured that backup transplant recipients were 
available at a location away from the Transplant Centre 
to reduce risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. For the same reason, potential transplant recipients entered the hospital at 
the latest possible time to minimize potential exposure to 
COVID-19 and family members were forbidden to enter 
the ward during the entire hospitalization period. However, 
it should be stressed that the sensitivity of the NPS for 
SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects can be low, and 
negative test results do not exclude the possibility of a 
latent infection [6].
Thus, at the time of the donor’s report on COVID-19 
tests, recipients admitted for LT completed a standard 
online form to screen for symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 or 
recent exposure: fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore 
throat, diarrhoea, recent loss of sense of taste or smell 
contact with known COVID-19 carriers, and recent travel 
history. The decision-making process is summarised in 
Fig. 1.
The Centro Nazionale Trapianti also suggests administering the NPS for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic recipients awaiting organ transplantation from a 
living donor, within 72 h of the expected transplantation 
date. Using this method, the possibility of starting the test 
and therefore, response times, do not interfere with those 
of the transplant [8].
Organization of liver transplants
The increase of wait-list times was the leading risk of 
reduced organ recovery for COVID-19-related limitations 
on institutional resources and to the well-established threat 
of donor-derived disease transmission. Risk stratifcation 
is essential to prioritize the appropriate candidates for 
transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including patients who score highly on the model for end-stage 
liver disease (MELD) scores, risk of decompensation, or 
tumour progression [6].
A multidisciplinary board composed of hepatologists, 
organ procurement teams, surgeons, critical care intensivists, microbiologists and nurses screened candidates, 
on a case-by-case basis considering the availability of 
resources such as ICU beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and supply of blood products in the 
LT process.
Since immunosuppression seems to play a protective 
role against SARS-CoV-2 infection and since there are no 
data on the course of COVID-19-infected LT, this condition should not constitute the primary limitation when 
deciding whether to perform the transplantation [7, 9].

LT ICU rearrangement
Most countries were forced to plan for a substantial 
increase in critical care beds capacity. The main options 
were to add beds into a pre-existing ICU, including the 
provision of intensive care outside of ICUs, such as in 
high-dependency units, remodelled general wards, postanaesthesia care units, emergency departments, or deployable feld units, and transfer of patients to designated 
hospitals and ICUs [10]. In the practical reallocation of 
human and material resources, in addition to the risk of the 
spread of viral SARS-CoV-2 infection, a current issue is 
the closure of non-COVID-19 ICUs such as ICUs specialized in transplant programs.
The ICU at the University Hospital in Bologna hosts 
the LT program and follows an average of 100 transplants 
in 2019 alone. The hospitalization capacity of this ICU, 
named the Abdominal Surgery and Liver Transplants ICU 
is eight beds. The course of treatment includes use of these 
beds, in addition to the use of semi-intensive and ordinary hospital beds according to a care intensity care logic. 
Although the eight beds are reserved for transplantation 
patients, they are located within an intensive area containing 12 additional beds (Fig. 2a). During the pandemic, 
many of the Hospital’s ICU-beds were reallocated to 
patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. In the 
same building, 20 beds were implemented and allocated 
to COVID-19 patients, and eight beds to post-operative 
and post-transplant patients. To improve the safety of 
both patients and staf, we ensured physical separation of 
the two sectors and strictly monitored any cross-trafc. 
Beds devoted to LT-ICU have been obtained inside the 
spaces usually used in the operating room to guarantee 
complete isolation from the remaining ICU beds (Fig. 2b). 
On May 12, 2020, near the end of the lockdown in Italy, 
the placement of ICU’s beds returned to their original 
arrangement. Faced with a pandemic that may pose additional challenges for transplant recipients, we only stratifed patients with high MELD scores [11], hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) or patients with clinically signifcant 
liver disease as well as recent liver decompensation or 
acute on chronic liver failure. Once selected, the candidate 
entered the General Surgery and Transplant Unit, already 
donned with PPE, and in any case, waited in a closed single room. Physicians, nurses and health personnel who 
approached the patient during work time wore PPE: they 
used N95 or surgical mask, gloves, disposable gown and 
visual protection according to the risk of the medical intervention. Relatives or acquaintances of the patient were 
forbidden from the ward. The patient underwent a NPS 
for COVID-19 and in the meantime, the patient was prepared for surgery as usual. Admission to the operating 
room occurred only once NPS results were negative; swab 
results were typically available within 4 h. In the operating 
room, healthcare personnel wore N95 masks, covered by

surgical mask, and visual protective gear. Following LT, 
the patient was transported to the ICU, where the medical and nursing staf who met the patient wore an N95 or 
surgical mask, a disposable gown, and visual protection. In 
addition to the usual graft monitoring, the post-operative 
follow up included several tests suggestive of COVID-19 
infection: marker infammatory agents including d-dimer, 
reactive protein C, creatine phosphokinase, ferritin and 
interleukin-6. If there was clinical suspicion, we planned 
a BAL and lung computed tomography (CT) scan. Upon 
discharge we emphasized the post-transplant prevention 
measures: wash hands often, clean high-contact surfaces 
frequently, avoid large crowds and sick people. We also 
advised that patients avoid travel during the COVID-19 
pandemic, to minimize potential exposure or spread. This 
was achieved by optimizing the use of telemedicine, and 
to consider the possibility of teleworking options. In the 
event of a fever or respiratory symptoms, patients were 
instructed to contact the Transplant Unit prior to visiting. 
The LT-ICU developed remotely administered screens to 
determine which symptomatic patients required evaluation, testing and management. Furthermore, all patients 
were educated on the broad spectrum of presentation of 
COVID-19 infection and on the need for more extended 
quarantine periods (up until two consecutive swabs are 
negative for COVID-19) due to the possibility of higher 
viral loads.
Healthcare personnel training and monitoring
On-site workers and other hospital staf are at higher risk of 
contracting COVID-19 [12]. Therefore, minimizing interactions between healthcare workers and patients, and minimizing the transport of patients within and between healthcare 
facilities, are critical to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 
Health care personnel receive continuous training on correct 
donning and dofng of PPE, including ft testing (e.g. 95 
masks), precautions during the use of powered air-purifying 
respirators, and basic infection prevention principles, such 
as hand hygiene or surfaces disinfection [10].
Also, restricting health staf who are dedicated to LT to 
COVID-19-free departments with independent pathways can 
help reduce the risk of an outbreak. Every two weeks, all 
members of the transplant team were subjected to NPS to 
serology for IgG and IgM. For the determination of IgM and 
IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 
and spike protein we used iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 (Shenzhen 
YHLO Biotech), a paramagnetic particle chemiluminescent 
immunoassay (CLIA). According to the manufacturer’s 
inserts (V1.0 English Fd. 2020-02-20), the IgM and IgG 
cut-of was 10.0 kAU/L. Classifcation accuracies exceeded 
90% (manufacturer threshold was 93% and 92.9% for sensitivity and specifcity, respectively) [13]. Upon appearance 
of COVID-19 symptoms, staff self-isolated and implemented predefned backup plans to replace the quarantined

individual. Staf who assisted transplant patients avoided 
high-risk situations by maintaining transplant programs 
with closed parallel teams (without cross-team contact) to 
allow for continued transplant activity even in the case of a 
staf infection. Healthcare workers with SARS-CoV-2 can 
spread the virus readily; thus, they should be quarantined 
of-site until approved to return by local health authorities. 
Infected staf typically received two consecutive NPS every 
24 h spaced 14 days apart from the positive result; readmittance to the workplace is permitted when both swabs are 
negative (Fig. 3).
The number of health workers infected with COVID-19 
was low: one surgeon, one anaesthetist, two nurses and one 
nursing assistant were infected. No internal physician tested 
positive during the study period.
Statistical analyses
Categorical variables were expressed as number (%), and 
quantitative variables as mean±standard deviation or as 
median (range). Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used 
to compare categorical variables, while for quantitative variables, the Mann–Whitney U test was used. The statistical 
software SPSS v.21.0 (SPSS 270 Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) 
was used for statistical analyses, and p<0.05 was considered 
signifcant for all tests.
Liver transplants activities report
As of February 22, 2020, the day of the first signalled 
COVID-19 case in the Emilia Romagna region, to June 30, 
2020, the liver wait-list in Bologna registered 61 patients. 
Throughout the same period in 2019, the wait-list registered 
60 patients.
In the study period, four patients were suspended from 
the wait-list following a COVID-19-positive NPS; between 
them, only one patient required hospitalization for COVID19-related symptoms. One patient was transplanted once 
COVID-19 testing was negative.
To verify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
the activity of the Transplant Centre in Bologna, we analyzed the characteristics of the patients who received a LT 
from February 22 to June 30, 2020. Sex, age, type of liver 
disease, re-transplantation, body mass index, number of days 
on the transplant list, area of origin of recipients, MELD, 
MELD-Na, MELD-exceptions, mortality after LT, rates of 
hospitalization at the time of LT, cold ischemia, and the 
donor’s age were considered. MELD-exceptions were determined according to national and regional waiting list prioritization policies. The etiology of liver disease was divided 
into cirrhosis, HCC, “others”, and re-transplants, while the 
area of residence was categorized as either Emilia-Romagna, 
Northern Italy, or elsewhere in Italy. Only in a single case 
was the liver allocated to another centre for a logistical reason: no ICU bed was available for transplantation. A total of 
38 LTs were performed in COVID-era study period, compared to 41 during the same period in 2019.
No signifcant diferences were found between the 2020 
and 2019 study period with respect to age (54.8±10.2 vs 
57.5±10.4 years; p=0.171), BMI (26.6±6.29 vs 26.8±5.1; 
p=717), rates of re-transplantation [1 (2.6%) vs 3 (7.3%); 
p=0.667], donor’s age (59.7 years±19.3 vs 60.2±16.2; 
p=0.998) and MELD exceptions [19 (50%) vs 31 (75%); 
p=0.865]. Notably, there were no diferences in the zone 
of residence of recipients despite the lockdown and travel 
difculties: 12 patients in 2019 come from a region diferent 
from Emilia Romagna and North of Italy while resulted in

17 the previous year [12 (31.6%) vs 17 (41.5%); p=0.484]. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, more critical patients 
were transplanted than in 2019: MELD and MELD-Na 
scores were higher (20.4±9.3 and 22.5±8.6 vs 15.6±9.6 
and 17.2±9.6; p=0.008 and p=0.016, respectively). More 
patients were hospitalized in a ward at the time of the LT [19 
(50%) vs 10 (24.4%); p=0022], liver failure was more common than HCC [18 (47.4%) liver cirrhosis cases in 2020 vs 
10 (24.4%) in 2019; p=0.038) and days spent on the waiting 
list were fewer [128 (1–1240) in 2020 vs 243 (1–1347) in 
2019; p=0.042). Relevant characteristics of the recipients, 
the donors, and the LT are summarized in Table 1. The transplants were performed in critically ill patients likely to die 
without surgery. Notably, cold ischemic time was on average 
higher in the 2020 study period relative to the same period 
in 2019 (474±124 vs 413±124 min; p=0.005), which can 
be explained by the additional time required to obtain the 
swab report. No signifcant diferences were observed in 
post-transplant mortality rates in the two periods studied 
[1 (2.6%) in 2020 vs 3 (7.9%) in 2019; p=0.618]. To date, 
COVID-19 has not been confrmed in our LT patients.
Conclusions
The low availability of beds in COVID-19-free ICUs 
depends on the fast overstaying beds in COVID-19 ICUs 
due to the prolonged intubation required by many of these 
patients (often 15–20 days of mechanical ventilation) [14]. 
Thus, the complex decision-making process involved in 
whether to proceed with LT has been rendered signifcantly 
more challenging by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 
During the pandemic, we have had to continue monitor 
our resources and any implications for patients waiting for 
a LT. We opted not to discontinue the LT program given 
the reduction in organ recovery due to the limitations on 
institutional resources of COVID-19, and this is expected 
to signifcantly increase waiting times to receive a LT. The 
dilemma is to assess the risks and rewards of waitlisted 
patients who require a transplant to resolve their primary 
disease but who are also at risk of severe infections, with 
possibly fatal outcomes. However, there are no data suggesting that the immunosuppression worsens the course of 
COVID-19; indeed, it may have a protective role against 
the cascades of infammatory cytokines activated by the 
virus [7, 9]. Furthermore, employees in the ICU and the 
transplant ward can contract asymptomatic COVID-19 by 
spreading the infection both within and beyond the hospital 
confnes. With these considerations as a starting point, we 
have maintained a dedicated path for LT during the COVID19 outbreak, with some limitations. We took a careful risk 
stratifcation approach and chose to transplant waitlist candidates with high MELD scores or HCC based on the risk 
of disease progression, excluding positive COVID-19 transplant candidates.
Data on LT transplants in the COVID-19 era of 2020, 
compared with the same period in 2019, confrmed the 
tendency of the Transplant Centre in Bologna to transplant 
more critical patients, as suggested by higher scores of 
liver failure (on the MELD and MELD-Na) and a higher 
rate of hospitalization of LT recipients in 2020 and shorter 
time spent on the waiting list. The main measures we were 
required to introduce in our standard of care were the exclusion of COVID-19-positive donors and recipients, staff

training, and the application of infection control measures 
to minimize the risk of spread.
Despite the difculties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the greater severity of illness in these patients, 
the mortality rates of transplants and re-transplantation rates 
remained low and did not difer signifcantly from those of 
the previous year (Table 1).
At present, there are no reliable data on the impact that an 
infection derived from a COVID-19 donor could have on the 
medical system and the broader community of recipients [5].
The acquisition of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 is 
accumulating rapidly. There are many unknown factors of 
relevance to the community in general and the transplant 
community, particularly in Italy. When the West Nile virus 
emerged in the United States in 1999, we quickly learned 
that transplant patients were at particular risk for signifcant 
morbidity and mortality from blood and organ transfusions 
obtained from donors with asymptomatic infection [15]. 
The optimal approach to donor screening can change over 
time as more data accumulates. We encourage the screening 
of all donors for possible COVID-19 exposure and clinical symptoms. Considering that samples should be tested 
for sufcient quantities of replicating virus and considering 
optimal collection site procedures, we invariably recommend 
collecting lower respiratory samples for COVID-19. BAL 
is a more sensitive real-time PCR-based methods of NPS, 
which can be~30% negative in the early stage of the disease 
because the SARS-CoV-2 viral load may be low: BAL fuid 
specimens achieve in up to 93% using real-time PCR-based 
methods [16].
One of the biggest questions we have encountered is how 
best to maintain patients with acute on chronic liver failure 
in intensive care awaiting transplantation. SARS-CoV-2 is 
a single positive-stranded RNA virus that replicates using 
a viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and 
it binds and is internalized in the target cells through the 
angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, which acts as a functional 
receptor [17]. The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is present in biliary and hepatic epithelial cells; therefore, the liver 
is a potential target of infection. In the event of infection, 
it will be difcult to distinguish whether the elevated liver 
biochemistry values are due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection 
itself or to the worsening liver disease. Complications from 
COVID-19, including myositis (especially with aspartate 
transaminase → alanine transaminase), cytokine release 
syndrome, and ischemia/hypotension, are also common 
in liver disease [17]. Routine labs that include a complete 
blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel can provide useful indirect evidence of infection. Infammatory 
markers, including d-dimer, reactive protein C, creatine 
phosphokinase, and ferritin, are often elevated in patients 
afected with COVID-19. The chest ultrasound is now daily 
practice in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas 
lung CT scans are reserved for dubious cases because it is 
more sensitive than ultrasounds.
Healthcare facility transmissions of COVID-19 have 
occurred; given the potential for increased infectivity, anyone suspected of SARS-CoV-2 must follow strict isolation 
precautions. Although the virus is not airborne, we recommend the use of airborne precautions and PPE. We have 
minimized interactions between healthcare professionals and 
between healthcare professionals and patients, decreased the 
transport of patients within and between independent healthcare facilities using a parallel path and dedicated exclusive 
medical teams for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
We minimized the presence in the department of nonessential team members as well as students, observers and 
research staf to minimize the risk of exposure. Also, all 
asymptomatic health professionals involved in patient care 
are currently subjected to periodic blood screening for 
IgM–IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Although fve 
health workers have contracted the virus, no transplanted 
patient was infected, as a result of the surveillance programs 
and safety measures implemented.
However, it is imperative to develop new, cost-efective 
and reliable serological diagnostics. Early diagnosis helps 
mitigate the spread of the disease, which remains the main 
problem in an ICU hosting liver transplanted or transplant 
candidates. If there is a second wave of COVID-19 or if 
another pandemic occurs, we have acquired the necessary 
expertise to ensure a sustainable transplant activity. As long 
as there is only one case, we have to compare how we were 
in full outbreak to ensure the continuation of standard LT 
programs in the setting of intensive care.
