Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a member of the family Parvoviridae that has been widely
used as a vector for gene therapy because of its safety profile, its ability to transduce
both dividing and non-dividing cells, and its low immunogenicity. AAV has been detected
in many different tissues of several animal species but has not been associated with any
disease. As a result of natural infections, antibodies to AAV can be found in many animals
including humans. It has been shown that pre-existing AAV antibodies can modulate the
safety and efficacy of AAV vector-mediated gene therapy by blocking vector transduction or
by redirecting distribution of AAV vectors to tissues other than the target organ.This review
will summarize antibody responses against natural AAV infections, as well as AAV gene
therapy vectors and their impact in the clinical development of AAV vectors for gene therapy. We will also review and discuss the various methods used for AAV antibody detection
and strategies to overcome neutralizing antibodies in AAV-mediated gene therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Adeno-associated virus (AAVs) is a member of the family Parvoviridae that has been widely used as a vector for gene therapy
because of its safety profile, its ability to transduce both dividing
and non-dividing cells, and its low immunogenicity.AAV is a small,
non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus that has been detected
in many different tissues of several animal species (1, 2) but has
not been associated with any disease (3, 4). In the past decade the
discovery and development of new AAV types with dramatically
improved in vivo performance and with unique seroreactivity and
tissue tropisms (5–9) has situated AAV in the forefront of vector
development for gene therapy trials. One of the most important
aspects of the development of AAV as a clinical product is the
impact of the host humoral immune response against its capsid.
Several studies have shown that the induction of antibodies by natural exposure to AAV early in life can compromise the subsequent
use of AAV as a gene therapy vector (10–14). Moreover administration of an AAV vector induces a potent and long term humoral
response to AAV that may compromise the use of the same vector
if a second administration is required (15, 16). Humoral immune
responses to AAV can be of two types: neutralizing or binding
(non-neutralizing). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) bind to AAV
and through several mechanisms (17) inhibit AAV transduction
of target cells. Non-NAbs bind to AAV and “flag” the virus without blocking AAV transduction. AAV NAbs have been the focus
of many studies because of their significant deleterious effect on
the efficacy of AAV-mediated gene therapy. Recent studies have
shown that AAV binding antibodies may also have an impact on
AAV vector distribution and safety (18).
In this review we will provide an overview of humoral responses
to natural infection with AAV and to therapeutic AAV vectors
in small and large animal models including humans. We will
also discuss the best method to detect these antibody responses
and summarize strategies that have been proposed to avoid or
overcome NAbs to allow for AAV gene therapy in a wide spectrum
of subjects or to patients that already received AAV-mediated gene
therapy but need to be re-treated.
DETECTION OF ANTI-AAV ANTIBODIES
Several methods have been developed to detect antibodies to different AAV serotypes. Some of these methods detect total binding
antibodies to AAV capsid and other methods detect antibodies
that neutralize in vitro or in vivo transduction of AAV vectors. The
first reports in the early 1970s evaluated total antibodies responses
to AAV vector as measured by ELISA and Western blot (19–24).
These studies focused on AAV1 and AAV2, as these were the AAV
serotypes available at that time. The development in the last decade
of new AAV types as delivery vectors for gene therapy required
more sophisticated assays to evaluate the level of not only binding
but NAbs specific to each AAV serotype.
The in vitro transduction inhibition assay became the standard
assay to evaluate these NAbs to AAV. The assay is usually carried
out in a 48- or a 96-well plate format allowing a high throughput sample analysis. Several cell lines have been used as targets
for AAV vector transduction: HeLa, 2V6.11, 293, and Huh7 (25–
29). Typically an AAV vector expressing a reporter gene is mixed
with serial dilutions of the test sample and the vector-serum mixture is incubated with the cell line of choice that is subsequently
analyzed for reporter gene expression. The starting dilution of
the test sample, which defines the sensitivity of the assay, varies
between studies ranging from 1/2 to 1/20 (29–33). In some cases
pre-infection of target cells with wild type adenovirus is included
to increase AAV transduction. At the same time the AAV vector
expressing the reporter gene is mixed with serial dilutions of naïve
serum. The purpose of incubating the vector with naïve serum
is to evaluate the enhancement in transduction observed at high
concentration of serum ≤1/5 (18). The NAb50 titer is reported
as the highest serum dilution that inhibits transduction by 50%.
In vitro transduction efficiency is AAV serotype dependent. The
high level of in vitro transduction observed with AAV2 combined

with the use of very sensitive luminescence reporter genes allows
the use of an AAV particle/cell ratio as low as 100 (18). On the
other hand, the low levels of in vitro transduction observed in
some of the new AAV serotypes, like AAV8, demands the use of
a higher AAV particle/ratio which for AAV8 is between 1 × 103
and 1 × 104(10, 18, 27, 30). The use of the minimum amount
of AAV particles per cell for each AAV serotype allows the determination of the AAV NAb titer using the most sensitive assay
but compromises the comparison of NAb titers between all AAV
serotypes. Moreover, the high number of AAV particles/cell in
addition to the full/empty AAV particle ratio of the AAV vector
preparation used compromises sensitivity and the reproducibility
of the results obtained between different laboratories. It should
be noted that this assay does not consider the potential antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis (20) as a blocking mechanism of
vector neutralization or the possible change in tissue targeting of
AAV (18).
To overcome the above mentioned problems, an in vivo NAb
assay has been developed by various investigators (10, 18, 34).
In this assay, mice are infused with the serum sample immediately prior to intravenous infusion of the AAV vector expressing a
secreted reporter gene. Since the level of transduction by the new
AAV serotypes is superior to AAV2 in most in vivo applications a
dose as low as 109 GC/animal can be used. Several secreted transgenes have been used to evaluate transduction including FIX and
α-galactosidase (10, 18). A reduction in transgene expression of
50% or more when compared to control mice injected only with
AAV vector is reported as positive for AAV NAbs. This assay is
more sensitive than the in vitro assay as up to 29% of samples that
were negative by the in vitro NAb assay scored positive for AAV
NAbs (10, 18). The problem with this assay is that some of the
monkeys that tested positive for AAV NAbs did not show a reduction in AAV-mediated gene transfer, suggesting the in vivo NAb
assay is too sensitive (18).
The conclusions of these studies suggested that the in vitro
NAb assay provides a better correlation with in vivo transduction
in macaques than the in vivo NAb assay. Therefore the in vitro NAb
assay has become the standard assay to evaluate clinical samples
for the presence of AAV NAbs prior vector administration.
ANTI-AAV ANTIBODIES IN SEVERAL NON-PRIMATE SPECIES
Adeno-associated virus has been isolated from several tissues of
non-primate animal species including rat, mice, sheep, bird, snake,
cows, goat, and pig (2, 7, 24, 35–43), suggesting a natural exposure
to AAV. Pre-existing Abs to AAV in these non-primate species were
not thought to be a problem because endogenous parvoviruses
were believed to be structurally distinctfrom primateAAVs.Analysis of serum from small and large non-primate species used as
pre-clinical animal models has shown high rates of detectable levels of NAbs to several AAV serotypes found in both monkeys and
human. Interestingly the prevalence of AAV NAbs is both AAV
serotype and species specific (44). In horses, AAV5 is the most
seroprevalent serotype with 100% of the samples testing positive for NAbs. In dogs, AAV6 is the most seroprevalent serotype
with 100% of the samples positive for NAbs (28, 45). Interestingly, high levels of AAV6 NAbs are found in newborn puppies
suggesting passive immunization from colostrum and breast milk
(45). A limitation of this study is that the NAb analysis was performed in the same dog breed and colony and no confirmation
of AAV6-specific antibodies by ELISA or Western blot was performed. Rapti et al. (28), using mainly pooled sera also found
high levels of NAbs to AAV6. In this study, IgG was purified from
pooled sera and blocking of AAV transduction was demonstrated,
although at much lower titer than whole serum, suggesting that
some other factors may play a role in AAV neutralization. A recent
study, also in dogs, showed the high binding capacity of serum
protein human galectin 3 binding protein to AAV6 inducing the
formation of aggregates and hampering vector transduction (46).
In pigs, AAV5 is the most seroprevalent AAV serotype with 100%
of the samples testing positive for NAbs; seroprevalence of NAbs
to other serotypes like AAV1, AAV2, and AAV8 was close to 50%.
AAV6 was the least seroprevalent serotype in pigs. In vivo testing
of serum from these species confirmed the neutralizing activity
of these antibodies (28, 44). These studies highlighted the importance of AAV NAb screening of all animal models used to evaluate
in vivo AAV performance for pre-clinical gene therapy.
ANTI-AAV ANTIBODIES IN PRIMATES AND HUMANS
Prevalence of antibodies to AAV in humans was first reported in
early 60s and 70s and mainly focused on AAV1 and AAV2, the
only serotypes available at that time. Frequencies of antibodies
ranged from 30 to 80% among human populations (19, 21–23).
Recently, more than 100 natural AAV variants have been isolated
from human and non-human primates tissue specimens (2, 6,
41). In pre-clinical models AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, and AAVrh.10
have emerged as promising candidates for gene therapy quickly
becoming the most commonly used AAV serotypes in pre-clinical
research. Several studies addressed the prevalence of NAbs to
these new serotypes and compared them to previously described
serotypes (25, 29, 30, 32, 47). In all human populations studied,
which included samples from 10 countries and four continents
(America, Europe, Africa, and Australia), prevalence of NAbs to
AAV2 ranged from 60 to 30% and was significantly higher than
the prevalence of NAbs to AAV7,AAV8, and AAV9 serotypes which
ranged from 30 to 15%. Although the seroprevalence of NAbs to
AAV1 was lower than that for AAV2, it was still higher than AAV7,
AAV8, and AAV9 in most regions. It is worth noting that significantly higher frequencies of NAbs to all AAV serotypes were
observed in Africa (25). Interestingly, the closely related AAV4
and AAVrh32.33 serotypes showed the lowest seroprevalence with
less than 2% of the population testing positive worldwide (25,
35). Although these properties were encouraging for the development of AAVrh32.33 as vector for gene therapy, recent studies
have shown this serotype induces a remarkable strong T cell
mediated immune responses to the transgene product, similar to
that induced by adenovirus, considerably limiting gene expression duration (48). Interestingly, when the seroprevalence to AAV
serotypes was analyzed in non-human primates, including rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, Japanese macaques, pig tail
macaques, squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees, and baboons, AAV7,
AAV8, AAV9, and AAVrh10 were the serotypes with the highest
seroprevalence, with NAb frequencies up to 100% (6, 49, 50). Contrary to the situation in humans, AAV2 became the AAV serotype
with the lowest seroprevalence (51). This finding is supported by
Frontiers in Immunology | Microbial Immunology October 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 341 | 2

Calcedo and Wilson Humoral immune response to AAV
the fact that AAV7, AAV8, and AAVrh10 were originally isolated
from rhesus macaque tissues (2, 7). The high seroprevalence of
these AAV serotypes in non-human primates presents an important challenge in the evaluation of vector performance in this
animal model and an exhaustive screening of monkey colonies
for pre-existing NAbs is required.
Binding AAV antibodies may also play an important role in the
clinical application of AAV vectors. AAV particles opsonized by
non-NAbs may be taken up by cells of the immune system such as
dendritic cells and macrophages through Fc receptors which may
lead to the development of inflammatory responses. Frequencies
of binding antibodies in humans were close to 70% for both AAV1
and AAV2, 45% to both AAV6 and AAV9, and 38% for AAV8 (30).
Although the frequencies to binding antibodies were higher than
frequencies of NAbs, the relative frequency between AAV serotypes
remained the same with AAV1 and AAV2 being the most prevalent
AAV serotypes.
Several studies have tried to associate binding antibodies to
NAbs with the goal of using binding antibodies as an indirect
measure of NAbs (10, 18). Although these studies found a correlation between both types of antibodies, almost 20% of the samples
with high binding antibodies had very low or no detectable NAbs.
The significance of the Fc interactions to host cells/proteins has
been demonstrated in a large animal study in which AAV8 was
administered systemically in a non-human primate model with
pre-existing AAV8 antibodies. The study showed that AAV vectors
were redirected from the liver to the spleen where they were stably
sequestered by follicular dendritic cells (18). Although pre-existing
humoral immune responses to the AAV capsid do not always correlate with the presence of AAV capsid deposition in the spleen
this finding raised concerns of the safety profile of systemic AAV
administration.
CROSS-REACTIVITY OF THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE
An important feature of the humoral response against AAV is the
breadth of the response. If a subject is positive for antibodies to
a specific AAV serotype, what is the likelihood that this subject
will also be positive for other AAV serotypes? Several studies have
analyzed the specificity of this response and found a strong link in
seropositivity toward distinct AAV serotypes. The majority of the
subjects with NAbs and/or binding antibodies to AAV7,AAV8, and
AAV9 also had antibodies to AAV2. Conversely, only a few subjects
with NAbs and/or binding antibodies to AAV2 had also antibodies
to AAV7, AAV8, and AAV9 (25, 30).
Most subjects enrolled in the recent phase 2 clinical trial of
AAV1 vector expressing α1-antitrypsin developed a NAb response
specific to AAV1 with minimal or no cross-reactivity to AAV2,
AAV7, and AAV8 serotypes (15, 52). Only those subjects with low
pre-existing NAbs to AAV1, AAV2, AAV7, and AAV8 developed
a highly cross-reactive NAb response to AAV2, AAV7, and AAV8
when injected with AAV1. One hypothesis to explain the difference in the breath of the AAV NAb response between naturally
exposed and gene therapy-treated subjects is that subjects with
co-occurrence of NAbs against multiple AAV serotypes may be
the result of multiple infections with various AAV types. Moreover
the propensity of AAVs to evolve through various mechanisms of
molecular evolution (6) would lead to the generation of NAbs
directed against a wide spectrum of homologous antigens. The
fact that AAV2 is the serotype with the highest prevalence in the
human population and also with the highest NAb titer indicates
that the initial and most frequent exposure to AAV in humans
occurs with an AAV2 or an AAV2 like serotype (31).
This data would also indicate that subjects naive for AAV NAbs
would be the preferred candidates for gene therapy if a second
administration of AAV vector is required. These subjects may
develop a NAb response specific to the first AAV serotype injected,
and a second administration with a different AAV serotype should
not pose a problem because of the narrow breath of the AAV NAb
response generated. Subjects with pre-existing NAbs to multiple
serotypes with a AAV NAb titer low enough (≤1/10) not to interfere with the first vector administration would develop a strong
and broadly cross-reactive AAV NAb response that may block a
second vector administration with another AAV serotype.
AGE, GENDER, HEALTH STATUS, AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGION
DEPENDENT PREVALENCE OF NAbs
When and how humans are exposed to AAV for the first time is
still not clear, although several studies suggest that this may happen early in life as serum-circulating binding and NAbs have been
reported in children (44, 53). This is especially important for the
treatment of many genetic diseases that manifest early in infancy
and therefore early gene therapy treatment with AAV is beneficial. NAbs to AAV2 were detected in almost 60% of the infants
and to AAV8 in 36% of the infants right after birth. Prevalence
of NAbs to both AAV serotypes declined during the first year of
life due to the drop in maternal antibody levels. A continuous
increase in the prevalence of AAV NAbs after 1 year of age with a
peak at 3 years of age suggests this age window is the time of the
first exposure to natural AAV infections, and closely models that
of adenovirus infection (22). Therefore the best age for an early
gene therapy intervention with an AAV vector may be right prior
to 1 year of age. The higher prevalence of AAV2 NAbs over AAV8
in early childhood also confirms the hypothesis that AAV2 or an
AAV2 like serotype is the first AAV to which humans are exposed.
Prevalence of AAV NAbs can vary depending on the geographical origin of the population studied.While the prevalence of AAV1
NAbs in Africa and China is close to 50–70%, in other countries like Belgium, Greece, Italy, and USA it is only 20–30% (25,
54). Overall the prevalence of AAV NAbs seems to be higher in
developing countries. It remains unclear whether living conditions, population density, hygienic conditions, different level of
health care, MHC background, or method of detecting AAV NAbs
are involved in this phenomenon. Interestingly, gender is another
factor that influences the prevalence of AAV NAbs. Women have
a significantly higher prevalence of AAV1 NAbs than men (54).
The health status of the target population may also impact the
prevalence of AAV NAbs, especially in those subjects with a compromised immune system. These subjects had a lower prevalence
of AAV NAbs when compared to the healthy population (32, 55).
STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME AAV NAbs IN AAV-MEDIATED
GENE THERAPY
The presence of AAV NAbs in both animals and human subjects
has necessitated the development of strategies to generate new
www.frontiersin.org October 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 341 | 3

Calcedo and Wilson Humoral immune response to AAV
AAV variants with limited or reduced recognition by NAbs. One
approach has focused on the identification of the immunogenic
domains on the AAV capsid and their subsequent modification
to avoid recognition by NAbs. Such targeted engineering of AAV
capsid requires knowledge of the antibody recognition site, the
epitope. At present, only epitopes to AAV2 and AAV8 serotypes
have been identified (56, 57). In this regard, it should be noted
that strategies to determine epitopes that are conformational are
likely to be more challenging. In spite of these difficulties, it has
been demonstrated that amino acid substitutions at sites 459, 493,
551, and 587 of AAV2 capsid confer escape from neutralizing
human antisera. While modification of these epitopes provided
a reduction in neutralization, it did not completely avoid it. Naturally occurring variants with different amino acid composition
at these sites outperformed these mutants in terms of eluding
NAbs (8).
An alternate approach is the development of an AAV capsid library generated by error-prone PCR that is subsequently
screened in the presence of NAbs to select AAV variants resistant to neutralization. This technique, called directed evolution of
AAV vectors, has been employed by Maheshri et al. to identify an
AAV2 variant that carried the E12A, K258N, T567S, N587I, and
T716A mutations which was 96-fold more resistant to neutralization by anti-AAV2 polyclonal serum than wild type AAV2 (9). A
similar approach, but using human serum positive for AAV2 NAbs,
identified an AAV2 variant containing R459K and N551D point
mutations which was 5.5-fold more resistant to neutralization than
wild type AAV2 (58).
The creation of these new AAV variants and the discovery new
AAV serotypes (2, 7) with impressive transduction capabilities and
distinct serological properties have provided scientists with the
tools necessary to avoid undesirable NAbs to one AAV serotype by
using a different AAV vector type. This approach has been shown
to be effective in both small and large animal models (16, 59).
Although this approach is viable for subjects with an AAV NAb
response restricted to one serotype or with a cross-NAb titer equal
or less than 1/10 (18) it may not be in those subjects with high
titers of cross-reactive NAbs. To overcome this problem several
strategies have been proposed:
(a) Plasmapheresis. Some investigators have explored the use of
plasmapheresis to reduce the overall levels of AAV NAbs right
before vector administration (10, 27). In this technique, blood
is removed and separated into plasma and blood cells. Blood
cells are returned to the body and plasma is disposed. An
albumin solution is infused into the patient to replace the
plasma volume removed (60). Studies using this technique
have shown a two to threefold reduction in AAV binding and
NAb titers after each sequential apheresis session (10, 18, 27).
Although this approach may be very useful for subjects with
low levels of broadly cross-reactive AAV NAbs it may still not
be enough for those subjects with high levels of NAbs.
(b) Minimizing contact of AAV vector with NAb. Intravenous
administration of AAV to target the liver exposes the vector to
NAbs present in blood reducing significantly transgene copy
number in liver resulting in undetectable levels of transgene
expression (10, 11, 18). An approach focused on delivering the
vector in the target organ and minimizing the exposure of the
vector to circulating NAbs has been shown to be efficient with
AAV8 in non-human primate studies targeting the liver via the
portal vein (26). In this study investigators flushed the liver
with saline, to remove blood and NAbs with it, before injection of the vector into the portal vein. Their results showed
no significant impact on gene expression when animals had
an AAV NAb titer of up to 1/28 and only partial reduction of
gene transfer when the NAb titer was 1/56.
Another approach to minimize the contact of AAV vector with
NAb includes targeting a tissue or organ via direct infiltration rather than via the circulation. This organ/tissue should
have a proven record of stable and long term AAV-mediated
gene expression. Muscle has been one of the candidate sites to
test this approach. Investigators using non-human primates
and an AAV8 vector have shown minimal impact on systemic
gene expression in the presence of AAV8 NAbs as high as
1/320 when monkeys were injected directly into muscle (61).
A similar approach has been used in clinical trials for A1AT
deficiency and hemophilia B using AAV1 and AAV2 vectors
respectively, demonstrating that high titers of AAV NAb did
not prevent gene transfer (15, 52, 62). The retina has also
been used as a target organ for AAV-mediated gene therapy for localized systemic expression of therapeutic proteins
such us erythropoietin (63). As into the muscle, the subretinal
space into which the vector is injected has reduced contact
with blood; consequently pre-existing AAV NAbs in blood
had a minimal impact of AAV-mediated gene transfer (64,
65). Intrathecal administration (i.e., direct injection into the
cerebral spinal fluid) is another route of administration that
minimizes contact of the AAV vector with blood. In recent
mouse studies, AAV2 and AAV5 were injected intrathecally
to transduce the central nervous system (66). These studies
showed that the potentially debilitating effect of AAV NAbs
could be partially overcome by direct administration of AAV
to the target organ. The caveat associated with these alternative routes of administration is the immune response that
is induced in these organs/tissues. For example, the muscle
is a very immunogenic tissue and intramuscular administration, unlike intravenous administration, induces a strong
humoral and cellular immune response to the AAV capsid
and in some instances to the transgene product (15). Humoral
and cellular immune responses to the AAV capsid and transgene product using these alternative routes of administration
need to be carefully assessed to ensure that the lack of AAV
interference with pre-existing NAbs is not eclipsed by the
induction of a stronger immune response to the therapeutic
product.
(c) Immunosuppression has been proposed by several groups
as a method to lowering NAbs by reducing the number
of cells producing antibodies. In these studies rituximab,
a B-cell depleting antibody that targets the CD20 antigen
and is used clinically, was able to reduce AAV2 and AAV5
NAbs in ∼30% of subjects to levels that for some subjects
were under limit of detection (32). These data are consistent with results obtained in non-human primates using
rituximab and cyclosporine, although in this study rhesus

Calcedo and Wilson Humoral immune response to AAV
macaques were injected systemically with an AAV vector
and then NAb response were monitored (67). The caveat
with pharmacological immunomodulation of the immune
response is that the tolerogenic properties of AAV can be
altered after this treatment and undesirable immune response
to the transgene may be induced, as was reported for monkeys injected with AAV2 and carrying FIX as transgene (68).
An immediate antibody response to the FIX was observed
when the immunosuppression regimen was stopped after
10 weeks of vector administration. An antibody response to
FIX was never observed in monkeys that did not receive
immunosuppression.
In conclusion, a combination of alternative AAV types, route
of vector administration with minimum contact with blood and
techniques directed to lower AAV NAb by physical methods or
pharmacological modulation of the humoral immune response
may ultimately overcome the impact of pre-existing AAV NAbs in
subjects who would otherwise not be eligible for AAV-mediated
gene transfer therapy.
