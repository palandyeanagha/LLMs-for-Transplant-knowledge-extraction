Abstract
Background: Lung transplantation remains the only viable treatment option for the majority of patients with
advanced lung diseases. However, 5-year post-transplant survival rates remain low primarily secondary to chronic
rejection. Novel insights from global gene expression profiles may provide molecular phenotypes and therapeutic
targets to improve outcomes after lung transplantation.
Methods: Whole-genome gene expression profiling was performed in a cohort of patients that underwent lung
transplantation as well as healthy controls using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST Array. To explore the potential roles of
microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating lung transplantation-associated gene dysregulation, miRNA expression levels were also
profiled in the same samples using the Exiqon miRCURY LNA Array.
Results: In a cohort of 18 lung transplant patients, 364 dysregulated genes were identified in Caucasian patients relative
to normal individuals without pulmonary disorders. Pathway enrichment analysis of the dysregulated genes pointed to
Gene Ontology biological processes such as “defense response”, “immune response” and “response to wounding”. We
then compared the expression profiles of potential regulating miRNAs, suggesting that dysregulation of a number of lung
transplantation-associated genes (e.g., ATR, FUT8, LRRC8B, NFKBIA) may be attributed to the dysregulation of their
respective regulating miRNAs.
Conclusions: Following human lung transplantation, a substantial proportion of genes, particularly those genes involved
in certain biological processes like immune response, were dysregulated in patients relative to their healthy counterparts.
This exploratory analysis of the relationships between miRNAs and their gene targets in the context of lung
transplantation warrants further investigation and may serve as novel therapeutic targets in lung transplant complications.

Background
For many patients with end-stage lung diseases, lung
transplantation is often the only remaining viable therapeutic measure [1]. The number of lung transplants
is ~1,500 on average a year in the United States, which
represents ~45% of lung transplants performed worldwide [2]. Compelling data have documented the beneficial impact of lung transplantation on functional status,
hemodynamics, and quality of life. Less compelling, however, is the demonstration of a survival benefit due to significant constraints on long-term survival [1].
Although short-term survival has improved via improved surgical techniques, donor preservation and
immunosuppressive agents, long-term survival remains
reduced after lung transplantation. The major cause of
decreased long-term survival is bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome (BOS), a physiological measure of chronic rejection after lung transplantation. Approximately 50% of lung
transplant recipients will develop BOS by five years post
transplantation. However, the pathogenesis of BOS has not
been clearly elucidated. Both alloimmune-dependent and -
independent factors have been suggested to contribute to
BOS pathogenesis. These factors include acute rejection,
lymphocytic bronchiolitis, acute infectious etiologies and
gastroesophageal reflux disease.
In addition, an individual patient’s genetic make-up may
also contribute to the prognosis after lung transplantation

as well as to the development of various complications.
Particularly, global gene expression profiling has been used
to identify unique expression signatures in organ transplant
biopsies that may help distinguish various outcomes such
as acute rejection, acute dysfunction without rejection and
well-functioning transplants with no rejection history [3-5].
For example, gene expression in bronchoalveolar lavage
cell samples from lung transplant recipients with and without acute rejection on simultaneous lung biopsies was
examined, and specific expression patterns were demonstrated at defined time points after transplantation in allografts [4]. Though not definitive and comprehensive, these
studies showed the potential power of whole-genome microarrays to identify biomarkers of acute/chronic transplant rejection and development of other complications.
Notably, gene expression itself has been demonstrated
to be a complex and quantitative trait that varies within and between natural human populations [6-11] and is
controlled by various genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic
factors [12-15]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small (21-25 nt)
non-coding RNA molecules, have emerged as a novel class
of gene regulators that may affect various complex phenotypes including disease susceptibility and drug response
[16,17]. Integrating whole-genome mRNA and miRNA
profiles, therefore, could help elucidate the complex cellular response and its mechanisms in lung transplant patients, and provide novel biomarkers for the outcomes
of lung transplantation. Specifically, we compared wholegenome transcriptional expression data profiled using the
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST Array (exon array) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from lung
transplant patients and normal individuals. We searched
for any enriched pathways or biological processes among
the dysregulated genes in lung transplant patients. We further demonstrated that miRNAs could potentially play a
critical role in determining the gene expression dysregulation observed in lung transplant patients.
Methods
Subjects and collection of PBMC samples
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of each collaborating institution with written informed
consent obtained from all subjects, and was performed
in accordance with the principles in the Declaration of
Helsinki. PBMC samples were collected from 18 patients
(14 Caucasian Americans and 4 African Americans) who
underwent single-lung transplant or bilateral single-lung
transplant surgery during 2005-2008. The PBMC samples
were collected 1.25-29.75 months after lung transplantation, representing a general patient population at the
sample collection time. Control samples were collected
from healthy individuals (27 Caucasians and 8 African
Americans) with no diagnosis of pulmonary disorders at
The University of Chicago Medical Center. Table 1 shows
the clinical characteristics of the study cohort.
Obtaining exon array data
Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs and prepared using
standard molecular biology protocols. RNA concentration
and purity was determined before gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST Array (exon
array) (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The microarray
labeling, hybridization and processing was performed at

the University of Chicago Microarray Core Facility according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Processing of exon array data
We used the experimental probe masking workflow provided by the Affymetrix Power Tools v.1.12.0 (http://
www.affymetrix.com/) to filter the probeset (exon-level)
intensity files by removing probes that contain known
SNPs in the dbSNP database v129 [18,19]. The resulting
probe signal intensities were quantile normalized over all
samples, summarized with the robust multi-array average
(RMA) algorithm [20] and log2 transformed with a median
polish [19] for ~22,000 transcript clusters (gene-level) with
the core set (i.e., with RefSeq-supported annotations) [21].
Adjustment for possible batch effect was conducted by
COMBAT (http://jlab.bu.edu/ComBat/) [22]. We consider
a transcript cluster to be reliably expressed if the DABG
(detection above ground) [23] p-value computed by the
Affymetrix Power Tools was less than 0.01 in at least 80%
of the samples in each test group (healthy controls or patients) in each population, respectively. We further limited
our analysis set to the genes with unambiguous annotations by Affymetrix. Totally, 11,461 and 11,576 transcript
clusters in the Caucasian American and African American
samples, respectively, met these criteria and were further
analyzed. We have deposited the raw and processed exon
array data in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
(Accession Number: GSE49081).
Obtaining miRNA expression data
The expression levels of miRNAs were profiled using
the Exiqon miRCURY LNA Array v10.0 (∼700 human
miRNAs, updated to miRBase 11.0 annotation) [24]
(Exiqon, Inc., Denmark). Briefly, total RNA from PBMCs
was extracted and prepared according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Array hybridization was performed by Exiqon
with the quantified signals background corrected using
normexp with offset value 10 based on a convolution model
[25] and normalized using the global Lowess regression
algorithm. In total, 318 miRNAs and 309 miRNAs were
found to be expressed in the Caucasian American samples
and the African American samples, respectively (i.e., present in at least 80% of total samples in each population).
Identifying genes dysregulated in patients with
lung transplants
We excluded genes on chromosomes X and Y to avoid the
potential confounding effect of gender. SAM (Significance
Analysis of Microarrays) [26], implemented in the samr library of the R Statistical Package [27], was used to identify
differential genes between patients who underwent lung
transplantation and healthy controls in the Caucasian
American and African American samples, respectively, as
well as between patients with and without development of
BOS. Transcripts with a greater than 1.5 fold-change and
q-value [28] less than 0.01 (i.e., 1% FDR, false discovery
rate) were deemed significantly dysregulated. We searched
for any enriched pathways and biological processes among
the differential genes relative to the respective analysis
set using the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tool [29,30]. The following
databases were included: KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes) [31], BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.
com/), Reactome [32], PANTHER [33], and Gene Ontology (GO) [34]. Due to the exploratory nature of this study,
we chose to use a relatively lenient cutoff, i.e., FDR < 25%
after the Benjamini-Horchberg procedure [35] and a minimum of 5 differential genes in a pathway or biological
process, for the DAVID analysis.
Identifying relationships between dysregulated genes
and potential regulating miRNAs
The differential genes were then searched against the Mi
croCosm Targets [24] (i.e., miRanda algorithm) through
our ExprTarget database (http://www.scandb.org/apps/mi
crorna/) [36] for potential regulating miRNAs (miRanda
p < 0.0001). Only human miRNAs that are expressed in
these samples (318 miRNAs in the Caucasian samples; 309
miRNAs in the African American samples) were included
in the analysis. The expression patterns of those miRNAs
and their corresponding gene targets were compared between patients and normal controls using standard t-test.
Significant miRNA-mRNA relationships (i.e., negative
association between miRNA and mRNA at t-test p <
0.05) were further confirmed using linear regression.
The Pearson correlation coefficients and the associated pvalues (cutoff p < 0.05) were calculated using the lm library of the R Statistical Package [27].
Results
Identifying genes dysregulated in patients with
lung transplants
In total, 364 genes were differentially expressed between
14 Caucasian American patients with lung transplants
(n = 14) and normal controls (n = 27) (fold-change > 1.5,
q-value < 0.01) with 292 down-regulated and 72 upregulated genes (Figure 1) (Additional file 1: Table S1).
By comparison, only four genes were dysregulated between
African American cases (n = 4) and normal black controls
(n = 8) (fold-change > 1.5, q-value < 0.01) with one downregulated gene and three up-regulated genes. In addition,
no significant BOS-associated genes were identified at the
q-value < 0.01 level between Caucasian patients with (n = 5)
and without BOS (n = 9), probably limited by the small
sample size of this group of patients in our study cohort. At
a looser cutoff (q-value < 0.05), this comparison revealed
884 up-regulated genes associated with BOS, indicating a
potential trend of substantial dysregulation in patients who

developed BOS. A larger sample size may be needed for a
more reliable description of this comparison. We focused
our downstream analyses on the more robust list of dysregulated genes in all patients with lung transplants relative
to healthy controls, particularly in the Caucasian samples.
Enriched pathways among dysregulated genes
DAVID analysis on the 364 dysregulated genes in Caucasian
American cases revealed 12 enriched pathways and GO
biological processes such as “response to bacterium”, “immune response” and “response to wounding” (FDR < 25%,
a minimum of 5 genes). Six known pathways and GO
biological processes such as “hemostasis” and “blood
coagulation” were enriched among the 292 down-regulated
genes, while 19 GO biological processes such as “defense response”, “response to bacterium”, and “immune
response” were enriched among the 72 up-regulated genes
(Additional file 2: Table S2). Table 2 shows the topranking pathways and biological processes (FDR < 10%, a
minimum of 10 genes) for each gene group (i.e., “all
dysregulated”, “down-regulated” and “up-regulated”). In
addition, analysis on the 884 potentially BOS-associated
genes showed enrichment in pathways such as “T-cell receptor signaling pathway” and “apoptosis”.

Identifying potential regulating miRNAs for the
dysregulated genes
We searched for potential regulating miRNAs for the
dysregulated genes in lung transplant patients based
on the predictions of the miRanda algorithm [24].
Among the 292 down-regulated genes in the Caucasian
American patients, 178 miRNA-mRNA relationships
corresponding to 95 expressed miRNAs and 78 genes
were identified, while 74 miRNA-mRNA relationships
corresponding to 40 expressed miRNAs and 31 genes
were identified in the 72-up-regulated genes (miRanda
p < 0.0001). In comparison, nine miRNAs were identified
for the single down-regulated gene, SMOX (encoding
spermine oxidase) in the African American patients
(miRanda p < 0.0001).
We further searched for miRNAs that showed a negatively associated expression pattern with their potential
gene targets using t-test (Table 3). For the down-regulated
genes in the Caucasian American patients, six potential
regulating miRNAs were found to be up-regulated in the
patients (corresponding to 8 miRNA-mRNA relationships). For example, hsa-miR-34a was up-regulated (t-test
p = 0.0001), while its gene target, FUT8 (encoding fucosyltransferase 8) was down-regulated in transplant patients; and hsa-miR-519e was up-regulated (t-test p =
0.003), consistent with down-regulation of its potential targets, ATR (encoding ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related)
and PYHIN1 (encoding pyrin and HIN domain family,
member 1). In contrast, six miRNA-mRNA relationships
were identified among the up-regulated genes in the
patients. For example, hsa-miR-381 was down-regulated
while its potential target gene NFKBIA (encoding nuclear
factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
inhibitor, alpha), was up-regulated in the patients (t-test p
= 0.00067). Linear regression confirmed the relationships
between miRNAs and their potential gene targets (Table 3).
Figure 2 shows some examples of the confirmed (p < 0.05)
miRNA-mRNA relationships in the Caucasian American
samples.
Discussion
Lung transplantation is associated with major complications such as infection, acute rejection and chronic rejection characterized by BOS [2]. Elucidating the complex
cellular and physiological response after lung transplantation will be critical to understanding the pathogenesis of
acute and chronic complications after lung transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess
the relationships between dysregulated genes and potential gene regulators of miRNAs in patients that underwent
lung transplantation.
Approximately 3% of the analyzed genes were differentially expressed in Caucasian patients with lung transplants, indicating systematical dysregulation of certain
genes in these patients, potentially implicating their outcomes after lung transplantation. Using DAVID [29,30],
these lung transplant-associated genes were found to be
enriched in a number of known pathways and GO [34]
biological processes including “immune response”, “defense
response”, “response to wounding”, “hemostasis” and “blood

coagulation” (Table 2). Interestingly, biological processes
such as “blood coagulation” and “hemostasis” were enriched
among down-regulated genes, while biological processes
such as “immune response”, “defense response”, “response
to bacterium”, and “response to wounding” were enriched
among up-regulated genes. Lung transplant patients are
routinely anticoagulated to prevent thrombosis, and given
antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections and immunosuppressants to prevent organ rejection. It appears that
after lung transplantation and relevant treatments, genes
related to blood coagulation were significantly down-reg
ulated in patients, while genes related to the aftermath of a
major surgery including “response to wounding” were significantly up-regulated in patients.
Notably, many of these pathways shared a significant
number of genes, displaying the complex interactions of
several biological processes after lung transplantation.

including FOS (encoding FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral
oncogene homolog), IL8 (encoding interleukin 8), IL1B
(encoding interleukin 1, beta), involved in “inflammatory
response” were also involved in “response to wounding”.
In addition, many genes related to the response to bacterial infection and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were upregulated in patients such as NFKBIA, FOS, PTGS2 (encoding prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), ADM (encoding adrenomedullin), SOCS3 (encoding suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3), TRIB1 (encoding tribbles homolog 1)
and IL1B. Among them, FOS, PTGS2 and IL1B are genes
involved in “response to glucocorticoid stimulus”, which
was also enriched in the up-regulated genes and likely
reflected treatment effect. Besides these up-regulated immune response genes, 20 other immune response genes
such as CCR4 (encoding chemokine receptor 4), CD86 (encoding CD86 molecule), were down-regulated in patients.
Since lung transplant patients were treated continuously
with immunosuppressive drugs, the dysregulation of some
of these immune response genes could be due to the ongoing immunosuppressant treatments. Obviously, some immune response genes such as FOS, PTGS2, IL1B could
be induced by immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids), while some other immune response genes could
be suppressed by drug treatments. Dysregulation of these
genes after transplantation provides more insight regarding
the interactions of various biological processes and may ultimately provide biomarkers of the various complications
related to outcomes after transplantation.
Among the 364 differential genes in patients, a number
of genes showed an expression pattern correlated with
their potential regulating miRNAs (Table 3). Using a linear
regression model, we demonstrated that expression of specific miRNAs was significantly correlated with the expression levels of their potential gene targets. For example,
ATR and LRRC8B (encoding leucine rich repeat containing
8 family, member B) were down-regulated in transplant
patients. Their expression levels were significantly correlated with their potential regulating miRNA, respectively
(Figure 2). The majority of the identified miRNA-mRNA
relations could be confirmed using linear regression. Notably, the gene NFKBIA was found to be negatively associated with its potential regulating miRNA has-miR-381
(Table 3). NFKBIA is also involved in “response to wounding” and “response to LPS”, suggesting that miRNAs may
contribute to these biological processes in lung transplant
patients. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics of
dysregulated genes in these patients may be partially attributed to the differential expression of their potential
regulating miRNAs following lung transplantation, as well
as relevant treatments such as immunosuppressive drugs
and anticoagulants.
We recognize that there are some limitations to this
exploratory study. Firstly, the sample size was small and
therefore, this analysis must be validated with a larger
cohort of patients. Secondly, some potential confounding
factors (e.g., types of immunosuppressive agent that the
patients are taking) might influence gene dysregulation. In
addition, we were unable to compare our findings between
different ethnic populations, as well as derive more robust
conclusions for BOS-associated dysregulation, given the
small sample size. However, given the exploratory nature
of this analysis, our primary goal was to determine the putative relationships between dysregulated genes and regulating miRNAs in patients after lung transplantation.
Indeed, we were able to show a significant number of
miRNA-mRNA relationships, suggesting that the regulation of gene targets by these miRNAs in the context of
lung transplantation warrant further investigation, and
could ultimately serve as novel therapeutic targets in lung
transplant complications.
Conclusions
Despite improved short-term survival rates, long-term
survival rates after lung transplantation remain dismal.
Examination of global mRNA and miRNA, an important
class of gene regulators, expression profiles in lung transplant patients may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of transplantation-associated complications. We
showed the presence of a significant number of dysregulated genes, particularly those genes involved in pathways
and biological processes such as immune response and
defense, in the PBMCs derived from a cohort of patients
after lung transplantation. The contribution of miRNAs in
regulating these differential genes was also demonstrated.
The relationships between miRNAs and those dysregulated
genes in the context of lung transplantation warrant further
investigation, and may serve as novel therapeutic targets in
lung transplantation-associated complications.
