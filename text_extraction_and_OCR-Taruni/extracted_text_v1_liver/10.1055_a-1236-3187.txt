Introduction
Completely or partially obstructing pancreatic duct stones are a
common complication during the natural course of chronic calcific pancreatitis and may contribute to additional pain and
acute on chronic pancreatitis through an increase in intraductal
pressure [1–4]. In fact, as many as 90 % of patients with chronic
pancreatitis are identified as having pancreatic duct stones during long-term follow-up; however, it is important to note these

ABSTRACT
Background and study aims Per-oral pancreatoscopy
(POP) with intraductal lithotripsy via electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) or laser lithotripsy (LL) facilitates optically-guided stone fragmentation of difficult pancreatic stones refractory to conventional endoscopic therapy. The aim of
this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of POP with intraductal lithotripsy for difficult pancreatic duct stones.
Methods Individualized search strategies were developed
in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. This was a cumulative meta-analysis performed by calculating pooled
proportions with rates estimated using random effects
models. Measured outcomes included pooled technical
success, complete or partial stone fragmentation success,
complete duct clearance after initial lithotripsy session,
and adverse events (AEs).
Results Ten studies (n = 302 patients; 67.72 % male; mean
age 55.10 ± 3.22 years) were included with mean stone size
of 10.66 ± 2.19mm. The most common stone location was
in the pancreatic head (66.17 %). Pooled technical success
was 91.18 % with an overall fragmentation success of
85.77 %. Single lithotripsy session stone fragmentation and
pancreatic duct clearance occurred in 62.05 % of cases.
Overall, adverse events were reported in 14.09 % of patients
with post-procedure pancreatitis developing in 8.73 %. Of
these adverse events, 4.84 % were classified as serious.
Comparing POP-EHL vs POP-LL, there was no significant difference in technical success, fragmentation success, single
session duct clearance, or AEs (P > 0.0500).
Conclusions Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis, POP with intraductal lithotripsy appears to be an effective and relatively safe procedure for patients with difficult to remove pancreatic duct stones.

stones may be found incidentally in a majority of patients [5].
Stones typically develop proximal to pancreatic duct strictures,
and for those individuals with symptomatic pancreatic duct
stones, endoscopic removal is generally recommended to reduce recurrent flares and pain. Endoscopic strategies typically
are less invasive than traditional surgery and more likely to be
successful in cases with a small stone burden and stone location
isolated within the main pancreatic duct [4, 6, 7]. However, despite endoscopic management being a preferred strategy for
removal of pancreatic duct stones, removal may be challenging
– especially compared to more conventional biliary stones.
Underscoring this therapeutic dilemma for the endoscopist
is the fact that there are multiple endoscopic techniques available, including: pancreatic sphincterotomy, balloon sphincteroplasty, extraction baskets, rat tooth forceps-assisted stone retrieval, pancreatic stent placement, mechanical lithotripsy, and
per-oral pancreatoscopy (POP)-assisted intraductal lithotripsy
[8]. Of these, mechanical lithotripsy and POP-assisted intraductal lithotripsy are typically reserved for difficult pancreatic duct
stones, refractory to basic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) stone extraction techniques involving
pancreatic sphincterotomy, balloon sphincteroplasty, and extraction balloons and baskets. While few comparative studies
exist, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
(ESGE) suggests endoscopic therapy and/or mechanical extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) be the first-line treatment for painful uncomplicated chronic pancreatitis with an
obstructed main pancreatic duct in the head/body of the pancreas (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) [9]. Despite this guidance, intracorporeal lithotripsy using electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) or laser lithotripsy (LL) under POP may
be considered after ESWL has failed, mostly viewed as a secondline strategy due to the procedure’s technical complexity and
special equipment required [9, 10].
Yet despite these guidelines and summary recommendations, there remains a paucity of data to truly assess the feasibility and effectiveness of POP with intraductal lithotripsy with
variable rates of fragmentation and duct clearance rates reported. Furthermore, there remains limited literature assessing
EHL versus LL with few studies comparing the two available intraductal treatment modalities. As such, the primary aim of this
study was to perform a structured systematic review and metaanalysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of POP with intraductal lithotripsy for treatment of difficult pancreatic duct
stones. The secondary aim was to compare the efficacy and
safety of POP-EHL versus POP-LL treatment of pancreatic duct
stones.
Methods
Literature search
A comprehensive search of the literature was performed to
identify articles that examined POP specifically for treatment
of difficult-to-remove pancreatic duct stones. Systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library databases were performed from inception through
November 30, 2019. The following medical subject heading
(MESH) terms included: per-oral pancreatoscopy (POP), singleoperator pancreatoscopy, pancreatoscopy, endoscopic pancreatoscopy, and antegrade pancreatoscopy. For articles related to these MESH terms, subject heading search terms and title
and abstract were reviewed for: pancreatic duct stones, intraductal lithotripsy, intracorporal lithotripsy, electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), and laser lithotripsy (LL).
All relevant English language articles irrespective of year of
publication, type of publication, or publication status were included. The titles and abstracts of all potentially relevant studies were screened for eligibility. The reference lists of studies of
interest were then manually reviewed for additional articles by
cross checking bibliographies. Two reviewers (TRM and ZS) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all the articles
according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any
differences were resolved by mutual agreement and in consultation with the third reviewer (TR). In the case of studies with
incomplete information, contact was attempted with the principal authors to obtain additional data.
Study selection criteria
This study was prospectively submitted in PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care. The Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement
outline and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines for reporting systematic
reviews and meta-analyses was used to report findings (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) [11, 12]. Full-text manuscripts as well as
abstracts were considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis.
Only human studies investigating the use of the POP modality
for the treatment of pancreatic duct stones were included. All
generations of the device were included.
Although no consensus definition exists, difficult pancreatic
stones were defined by prior failure of conventional endoscopy
therapy (stones that could not be extracted during prior ERCP
using standard techniques including pancreatic sphincterotomy, balloon sphincteroplasty, balloon and/or basket extraction, pancreatic stent placement or attempted treatment with
mechanical lithotripsy), generally agreed upon criteria based
on previous literature, and study authors’ definitions. Biliary
duct stones or studies with both biliary and pancreatic stones
were excluded if individual pancreatic duct outcomes were not
reported. A study was also excluded if deemed to have insufficient data, as were review articles, editorials, and correspondence letters that did not report independent data. Case series
and reported studies with < 10 patients were excluded to minimize selection bias. Multiple published work from similar authors was evaluated for overlapping enrollment times to preserve independence of observations.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measurement in this systematic review
and meta-analysis was the efficacy and safety of POP in patients
with difficult pancreatic duct stones. Efficacy and safety of pancreatoscopy was measured by overall fragmentation success
rate (i. e., ability to visualize the pancreatic duct stone and perMcCarty Thomas R et al. Per-oral pancreatoscopy with … Endoscopy International Open 2020; 08: E1460–E1470 | © 2020. The Author(s). E1461

form successful fragmentation) and adverse events reported.
Additional markers of success included percent of complete
fragmentation and pancreatic duct clearance after a single pancreatoscopy-assisted intraductal lithotripsy session. Complete
or partial fragmentation and duct clearance were determined
based upon intra-procedural pancreatography and/or pancreatoscopy as determined by the endoscopist. Duct clearance and
successful stone removal was determined based upon pancreatography and/or pancreatoscopy after balloon and/or basket
extraction and/or evidence of decompression of the pancreatic
duct. Other measured outcomes included baseline patient and
stone characteristics (i. e., mean age, gender, previous treatment, stone number, stone size, and stone location) as well as
procedural-related characteristics (i. e., pancreatoscopy technique, type of lithotripsy, number of sessions, and procedure
time).
Statistical analysis
This meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled proportions. After appropriate studies were identified through systematic review, the individual study proportion was transformed into a quantity using the Freeman–Tukey variant of the
arcsine square root transformed proportion. Then the pooled
proportion was calculated as the back transform of the weighted mean of the transformed proportions, DerSimonian–Laird
weights for the random effects model [13, 14]. The pooled
rates were estimated using random effects models and presented as point estimates (rates) with 95 % confidence intervals
[15–17]. In contrast to fixed effect models, which are used to
estimate a common effect, random effect models estimate an
average effect, and the variability of the effects represented
by their average may have clinical implications.
For subgroup analysis and difference between EHL and LL,
statistical significance for the differences between groups included the 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of the two pooled
proportions considered, and the differences of proportions
and 95 % CIs were calculated. Univariable meta-regression was
performed to assess the influence of type of treatment (EHL vs
LL) on overall fragmentation rate, single lithotripsy session success rate, and rate of adverse events. All calculated P values
were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tabular and graphical analyses were performing using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (BioStat,
Englewood, New Jersey, United States). Combined weighted
proportions were determined by use of the Stata 15.0 software
package (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas, United States).
Risk of bias and quality assessment
Risk of bias and quality of observational studies was evaluated
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and Jadad score for quality of randomized trials [18, 19]. In this study,
high quality was defined as a Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale score of ≥ 4 or a JADAD score of ≥ 3. Two authors
(TRM and ZS) independently extracted data and assessed the
risk of bias and study quality for each of the articles. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, and in
consultation with the third reviewer (TR).
Investigations of heterogeneity and prediction
interval
Heterogeneity was assessed for the individual meta-analyses
using the chi squared test and the I2 statistic [16]. Significant
heterogeneity was defined as P < 0.05 using the Cochran Q test
or I
2 > 50 %, with values > 50 % indicating substantial heterogeneity. Further quantification of heterogeneity was categorized
based upon I
2 with values of 25%, 50%, and 75 % indicating
low, moderate, and high amounts of heterogeneity, respectively. Given the use of random effects model to estimate average
effect, a 95 % prediction interval was calculated to determine
the dispersion of effects and clearly illustrate heterogeneity in
the calculated effect size [15, 20–23].
Publication bias
To assess for publication bias, a funnel plot was created and visually inspected for asymmetry and quantitatively using Egger
regression testing [24, 25]. The trim and fill method was used
to correct for funnel plot asymmetry and provide an adjusted Identification Screening Eligibility Included

risk of bias across studies.
Results
Study characteristics
A total of 10 studies (n = 302 patients) were included in this
meta-analysis [27–36]. A PRISMA flow chart of search results is
shown in ▶Fig. 1. All studies were retrospective in nature with
five multicenter studies included (▶Table 1, ▶Table 2). EHL
was exclusively studied in four studies, LL evaluated in two
studies, and both modalities in four studies.
Patient and procedure characteristics
A total of 302 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Sixty-seven percent of patients were male. The mean age of patients that underwent POP with intraductal lithotripsy was
55.1 ± 3.22 years. The size of pancreatic duct stones treated
was reported in 8 studies, with a pooled mean size of 10.66 ±
2.19mm. In the two studies that reported mean pancreatic
duct diameter, this was documented to be of 9.72 ± 1.59 mm.
The most common location of pancreatic duct stones was in
the pancreatic head (66.17 %) followed by the body (15.24 %),
neck (14.13 %), and tail (4.46 %). Six studies reported patients
had previously undergone ERCP with pancreatic sphincterotomy, pancreatic duct stent placement, or previous ESWL (▶Table 1, ▶Table 2). Overall, the mean number of lithotripsy sessions (regardless of type) was 2.07 ± 1.01 required for stone
fragmentation and pancreatic duct clearance.
Clinical effectiveness and safety
POP with intraductal lithotripsy achieved an overall technical
success rate of 91.18 % (95 % CI, 80.93 to 96.18; I2 = 60.26; prediction interval –70.79 to 99.93) (▶Fig. 2a). Overall stone fragmentation success was 85.77 % (95 % CI, 72.49 to 93.24; I2 =
66.86; prediction interval –81.09 to 99.88) (▶Fig. 2b). Complete fragmentation and duct clearance was achieved in
62.05 % (95 % CI, 38.29 to 81.17; I2 = 61.63; prediction interval
–97.78 to 99.88) (▶Fig. 2c). Total procedure-associated adverse events were 14.09 % (95 % CI, 8.31 to 22.90; I2 = 52.77;
prediction interval –86.04 to 91.84) with serious adverse
events occurring in 4.84 % (95 % CI, 2.13 to 10.62; I2 = 33.09;
prediction interval –93.95 to 94.99) of cases (▶Fig. 3a and
▶Fig. 3b). The most common POP-related adverse event was
acute (post-ERCP) pancreatitis that occurred after 8.73 % (95 %
CI, 4.50 to 16.27; I2 = 28.50; prediction interval –83.88 to
88.37) of cases (▶Fig. 3c). Sensitivity analyses limited to prospective studies were not possible given inclusion of only retrospective data.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses based upon type of lithotripsy (EHL versus
LL) were also performed with results highlighted in ▶Table 3.
Technical success rate was lower for EHL compared to LL
[85.92 % (95 % CI 66.35 to 94.97; I2 = 61.30) versus 97.74 %
(95 % CI 92.42 to 99.35; I2 = 0.00); P = 0.0509] though this was
not statistically significant (Supplemental Fig. 1a). Overall
stone fragmentation rate was not statistically different between EHL versus LL [76.16 % (95 % CI 55.61 to 89.07; I2 =
61.19) versus 96.32 % (95 % CI 82.88 to 99.30; I2 = 48.68); P =
0.1430] (Supplemental Fig. 1b). Single session POP with lithotripsy success rates were also similar for EHL compared to LL
[46.18 % (95 % CI 20.96 to 73.52; I2 = 69.67) versus 60.49 %
(95 % CI 25.28 to 87.39; I2 = 90.64); P = 0.5573] (Supplemental
Fig. 1c). The rate of total AEs was also similar between the two
groups [EHL: 10.24 % (95 % CI 4.60 to 21.26; I2 = 0.00) versus LL:
7.09 % (95 % CI 3.59 to 13.54; I2 = 0.00); P = 0.4542] (Supplemental Fig. 1d). A summary of technical success, fragmentation rate, single-session lithotripsy success, and AEs for POP-assisted lithotripsy is highlighted in ▶Table 3.

Review

Risk of bias assessment
All observation studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale scores. Quality assessment for
each study shown in ▶Table 1. All included studies were considered to be of high quality with Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale scores ≥ 4. Publication bias was also assessed.
Visual inspection of the funnel plot demonstrated that smaller
and statistically insignificant studies appeared to be missing
likely due to publication bias (▶Fig. 4a). With the Duval and
Tweedie’s trim and fill method, overall technical success of
POP with intraductal lithotripsy was slightly decreased from
92.97 % (95 % CI, 84.00 to 97.09) to 84.67 % (95 % CI 68.85 to
93.24) though this was not statistically significant (▶Fig. 4b).

Discussion
While pancreatic duct stones are a common sequelae of chronic
pancreatitis, intraductal stones also may result in recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis or exacerbations of abdominal pain
if they become obstructed within the pancreatic duct. Over the
course of the last several decades, ERCP with sphincterotomy
with pancreatic stent placement if a stricture is present, and
use of ESWL have been the mainstay diagnostic and therapeutic
modality to manage symptomatic pancreatic duct stones, particularly large or difficult to remove stones. A small, albeit significant, percentage of patients fail to respond to conventional
pancreatic stone extraction techniques and require additional
therapy. Based upon the results of this meta-analysis, POP

Review

with intraductal lithotripsy, including both EHL and LL, was
highly effective and safe for difficult to remove pancreatic
duct stones. Despite included patients undergoing previous
treatment for attempted stone removal, the overall stone fragmentation success of pancreatoscopy-assisted intraductal lithotripsy was 85.77 % with serious adverse events reported in
only 4.84 % of cases.
Advantages, disadvantages of per-oral
pancreatoscopy
POP-assisted therapy has several distinct advantages over traditional ERCP stone extraction methods. In addition to use as
an adjunctive therapy, pancreatoscopy allows for improved
maneuverability to directly locate, visualize, and treat pancreatic duct stones; direct visualization to reduce duct injury, confirm ductal clearance, plus assess for residual stones after stone
extraction; and may even detect pancreatic duct stones previously missed on high-resolution imaging such as magnetic
resonance [37–39]. Limitations or disadvantages of per-oral
pancreatoscopy include significant cost, the need for expertise
or familiarity with the device to achieve cannulation and access
to the pancreatic duct, need for sufficient diameter of the pancreatic duct due to diameter of the pancreatoscope, long duration of procedure compared to other strategies, and moderate
success rates of conventional strategies [40, 41].
Comparison of intraductal therapies
Although both EHL and LL both attempt to fragment pancreatic
duct stones, the process of achieving this is fundamentally different between the two strategies. EHL uses two coaxially insulated electrodes to generate high-amplitude hydraulic pressure
waves to accomplish stone fragmentation, while laser lithotripsy utilizes a laser beam with repetitive pulses of laser energy to
create a mechanical shockwave [42, 43]. Evaluation of the two
modalities independently resulted in LL demonstrating a trend
towards superior technical and clinical efficacy and safety as
compared to EHL, though this was not statistically significant
based upon meta-regression subgroup analyses. Technical success, fragmentation success, single session duct clearance, and
adverse events were not different between EHL and LL as evidenced by the overlapping confidence intervals.
Current guidelines and expert consensus
statements
Based upon recently published guidelines in 2019, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) currently does
not support use of POP-assisted intraductal lithotripsy (EHL or
LL) as a treatment option for symptomatic pancreatic duct
stones due to sparse data [44]. However, based upon this systematic review and meta-analysis, future guidelines may propose an increased role for POP – especially among symptomatic
patients that may have refractory stones. While anecdotal experience and clinical practice patterns may suggest that LL is
preferable to EHL if POP is undertaken, this systematic review
and meta-analysis demonstrated there was no statistical difference based upon performance measures – though we acknowledge more prospective comparator studies are needed. Excluding important variables such as cost, interoperator variability,
and endoscopist or center familiarity, our results may be interpreted that POP with intraductal lithotripsy, regardless of EHL
or LL, is an effective and safe treatment for refractory pancreatic duct stones.
Strengths and limitations
Specific limitations to this study include moderate-to-significant heterogeneity of included studies, including differences
in patient population, lack of long-term follow-up periods, varied sizes and locations of pancreatic stones, previous attempted treatments, multiple POP techniques, as well as interoperator procedural capability and familiarity. Furthermore, no randomized trials or prospective studies were included in this analysis with a complete reliance upon small sample size retrospective observational data. In addition, fragmentation success may
be less relevant to clinicians when compared to clinical im-

provement (clinical success) as a measure of procedural success. Publication bias was also assessed and present in a metaanalysis; however, correction of such did not significantly alter
our findings. Due to style of reporting, a subgroup analysis to
evaluate efficacy and safety by stone location was also not possible though may be exceedingly important for planning future
procedures. An additional concern with any endoscopic procedure or technique is the learning curve or clinical expertise
needed to perform an effective procedure. It is highly possible
the fragmentation success achieved in these studies as well as
the rate of adverse events may not be generalizable to centers
with less familiarity or proven expertise.
Despite these limitations, this study has several strengths.
Most importantly, our meta-analysis methodologically summarizes all available data to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy,
and tolerability of the POP procedure. While significant heterogeneity was noted in our meta-analysis and was not surprising
given the cumulative nature of reporting results, this is the first
systematic review and meta-analysis to POP-EHL and POP-LL for
pancreatic duct stones to these authors’ knowledge. Overall,
POP was demonstrated to be an effective modality for symptomatic pancreatic duct stones with sensitivity and subgroup analysis with meta-regression performed to simulate up to date
clinical practice and inform important next-steps in management (i. e., the potential decision between using EHL or laser lithotripsy among patients that may have failed more traditional
approaches). We hope these findings provide an important step
forward in future research and impact clinical decision making
among advanced endoscopists.
Conclusion
The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest
that POP with intraductal lithotripsy is a highly effective and
safe therapy for patients with symptomatic pancreatic duct
stones. When compared to EHL, LL was associated with a generally higher technical and overall fragmentation success rate and
better single-session fragmentation success; however, these
differences were not statistically significant and larger controlled studies are needed for direct comparison and cost-effective analysis. Overall, POP with intraductal lithotripsy provides a valuable tool for endoscopists in the treatment of difficult pancreatic duct stones that may not have responded to
previous endoscopic treatment.
