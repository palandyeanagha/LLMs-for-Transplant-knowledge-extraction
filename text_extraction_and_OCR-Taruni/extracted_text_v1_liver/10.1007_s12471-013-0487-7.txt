Abstract Predicting fluid responsiveness, the response of
stroke volume to fluid loading, is a relatively novel concept
that aims to optimise circulation, and as such organ perfusion,
while avoiding futile and potentially deleterious fluid
administrations in critically ill patients. Dynamic parameters
have shown to be superior in predicting the response to fluid
loading compared with static cardiac filling pressures.
However, in routine clinical practice the conditions necessary
for dynamic parameters to predict fluid responsiveness are
frequently not met. Passive leg raising as a means to alter
biventricular preload in combination with subsequent
measurement of the change in stroke volume can provide a
fast and accurate way to guide fluid management in a broad
population of critically ill patients.

Introduction
The cornerstone of resuscitation of haemodynamically
unstable critically ill patients is often considered to be fluid
loading. However, only roughly half of haemodynamically
unstable patients respond to a fluid challenge, defined as an
increase in stroke volume or cardiac output upon fluid loading
[1, 2]. Although rapid optimisation of volume status has
shown to improve outcome, extended fluid loading is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality [3–6]. Little
evidence is available for the type and exact dosing of fluid
administration. Establishing volume status is complex,
making accurate prediction of an increase in stroke volume
upon fluid loading, so-called fluid responsiveness, difficult.
Static cardiac filling pressures such as central venous
pressure have shown to be incapable of predicting fluid
responsiveness accurately. Dynamic parameters on the other
hand, using mechanical ventilation-induced changes in
preload to track subsequent changes in stroke volume, have
shown promise and have been the subject of extensive
research in critically ill patients. New methods have been
conceived that can easily be used at the bedside in a large
variety of patients.
In this review we discuss the basic concepts of fluid
responsiveness with a special focus on applications and
limitations on use in clinical practice.
Cardiac function and venous return
Since the late 19th century, when Otto Frank demonstrated
increased ventricular contraction when the ventricle was
stretched prior to contraction, cardiac function has been
prominent in our thinking about circulation. Ernest Starling
added the knowledge that increasing ventricular filling
pressures by increasing venous return led to stroke volume

augmentation. These changes in stroke volume in response to
changes in venous return and subsequent preload and right
atrial pressure (RAP) can be depicted in the well-known
Frank-Starling curve. With increasing RAP as a reflection of
increased ventricular preload, myocyte stretching increases the
sarcomere length with an augmentation in force generation and
subsequent increase of stroke volume. The shape of the FrankStarling curve is dependent on other factors influencing cardiac
function besides preload, most notably contractility and
afterload. The Frank-Starling curve is, therefore, also known
as the cardiac function curve (Fig. 1). The only difference with
the classic Frank-Starling curve is that in the cardiac function
curve cardiac output is plotted against RAP instead of stroke
volume. Therefore the shape of the cardiac function curve is
directly affected by heart rate as well.
Since the major portion of our blood volume resides in
capacitance veins, which are highly distensible, there is a
substantial amount of volume not creating transmural
pressure, the so-called unstressed volume. The volume that
does create a transmural pressure above zero is called the
stressed volume determining the mean systemic filling
pressure (MSFP). MSFP is the driving force behind venous
return, just as mean arterial pressure drives cardiac output.
Similarly, venous return is driven by the pressure gradient
between the MSFP and RAP limited by the resistance (Rv)
venous flow encounters, giving the following equation:
Venous return ¼ ð Þ MSFP−RAP =Rv
Arthur Guyton has provided useful insight of our
understanding of venous return by creating the venous return
curve (Fig. 2). As can be deducted from the venous return
equation and curve, venous return can be raised by 1)
lowering RAP, 2) decreasing Rv, and 3) increasing MSFP.
Means to lower RAP are limited, since the critical pressure
(Pcrit) at which the great veins at the thoracic inlet start to
collapse causes a subsequent increase in Rv, thereby
preventing a further increase in venous return. In the absence
of collapsing veins, thus above Pcrit, Guyton confirmed, in
extensive experimental models, that venous return changes
linearly [7].
Decreasing Rv may be achieved by venodilation. However,
by simultaneously increasing venous compliance, MSFP will
decrease due to an increase of unstressed volume at the
expense of stressed volume. The net effect on venous return
is therefore uncertain depending on the relative changes of Rv
and MSFP.
Increasing MSFP can be achieved by venoconstriction, but
venous return can be limited by an increase in Rv. MSFP can
also be increased by enlarging the stressed volume more than
Fig. 1 The cardiac function curve representing the relationship between
right atrial pressure (RAP) and cardiac output. The shape of the cardiac
function curve will move up with decreased afterload, increased
contractility and increased heart rate. Similarly, the curve will move down
with increased afterload, decreased contractility and decreased heart rate.
Furthermore, when cardiac performance is enhanced, the location of the
curve will move leftward by generating a decrease in RAP through a further
reduction in the systolic x-wave known from the venous pulse. Similarly,
RAP will rise when cardiac performance is decreased and the location of the
curve will move to the right. It should be noted that although there is no
descending limb illustrated beyond the ‘flat’ part of the curve since actinmyosin myofibrils cannot be disengaged, the secondary effects of increased
RAP and preload are not taken into account. For instance, increased preload
resulting in ventricular distension with increased wall tension leading to a
reduction in coronary perfusion pressure and oxygen delivery could
potentially decrease ventricular contractility causing a descending limb in
the cardiac function curve
Fig. 2 The venous return curve representing the relationship between
right atrial pressure (RAP) and venous return. Baseline venous return
curve: RAP becomes equal to mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) in
the absence of flow. Therefore MSFP can be determined at the intercept of
the venous return curve with the x-axis. Lowering RAP increases venous
return until reaching the critical pressure (Pcrit) at which the great veins at
the thoracic inlet start to collapse preventing a further increase in venous
return. Increased MSFP: Fluid loading will shift the baseline curve
upwards and to the right as MSFP increases more than the rise in RAP
with a subsequent increase in venous return. Decreased venous resistance
(Rv): Venodilatation will theoretically increase venous return assuming
unchanged MSFP, but the expected concomitant decrease in MSFP in
practice makes the effect on venous return unpredictable

RAP by means of fluid loading. Since MSFP is equal to RAP
in the absence of circulation, MSFP can be depicted at the
horizontal intercept of the venous return curve. Upon fluid
loading a right and upward shift is seen with no increase in
venous resistance (Fig. 2).
For these reasons, of the three components listed above,
venous return can be directly increased by fluid loading. The
circulatory system can be described as a composite function
curve consisting of input and output of the heart, as venous
return and cardiac output have to be equal within a few
heartbeats. Subsequently, cardiac output cannot increase
without an increase in venous return clarified by the FrankStarling principle ‘the heart pumps what it receives’. But
although increasing preload by fluid loading will increase
cardiac output when the patient is on the ascending portion of
the cardiac function curve, fluid loading will have little effect
when the heart is functioning near the flat part. Guyton made
this concept elegantly comprehensible by graphically
superimposing the venous return curve on the cardiac function
curve, as both are a function of RAP (Fig. 3) [8]. It should be
noticed that both curves are in fact a function of preload and
thereby represent transmural pressure, i.e. intramural (as RAP
is obtained) minus extramural pressure. Therefore a change in
extramural intrathoracic pressure can significantly alter preload
as has been thoroughly discussed in a recent review [9].
Cardiac output
Before one aims to increase cardiac output to prevent or treat
organ hypoperfusion, it is imperative to first find out whether
signs of inadequate tissue perfusion are present. Signs of tissue
hypoperfusion for instance are decreased venous oxygen
saturation or increased lactate levels, necessitating cardiac output
augmentation. Note that subclinical signs of hypoperfusion can
easily be missed. When tissue hypoperfusion is likely, it is key to
find out a patient’s position on the combined venous return/
cardiac function curve to predict whether an increase in cardiac
output is to be expected from fluid loading or cardiac function
augmentation (Fig. 3). This is especially important since
achieving supra-physiological cardiac outputs through inotropics
has shown to be detrimental [10]. On the other hand, when
decreased cardiac performance with a subsequent rise in RAP
and reduced cardiac output is overcome by fluid loading to
restore cardiac output, RAP will increase even further. On the
‘flat’ part of the cardiac function curve a rise in MSFP upon fluid
loading is accompanied by a similar increase in RAP negating an
increase in venous return and cardiac output indicating fluid
unresponsiveness (Fig. 3, point I→II). Fluid administration in a
non-fluid responsive patient will accelerate a rise in cardiac
filling pressures and thus hydrostatic pressures causing
pulmonary and general oedema. In that light it is of little surprise
that a positive fluid balance has been associated with a worse
outcome [11]. Determining volume status is challenging but
important since insufficient resuscitation on the other hand has
been associated with organ hypoperfusion and ischaemia [12].
The need for predictors of fluid responsiveness is high to select
patients who might benefit from fluid loading, and thereby
avoiding ineffective and potentially deleterious fluid
administration where inotropics may better be used.
Static and dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness
Central venous pressure as the classic static cardiac filling
pressure is still the most often used parameter to guide fluid
loading in Dutch critically ill patients [13]. However, endless
studies have shown that static cardiac filling pressures are poor
predictors of fluid responsiveness [14, 15]. This can largely be
explained by three mechanisms. First, cardiac filling pressures
are intramural pressures not taking into account extramural
pressures and thereby not fully reflecting transmural pressures,
which represents preload. This can misguide clinical decisionFig. 3 Venous return curves (Fig. 2) superimposed on cardiac function
curves (Fig. 1) where the cardiac output and right atrial pressure (RAP)
are determined at the junction of the curves assuming a theoretical steady
state; in reality, there are fluctuations for instance in RAP with respiration
and atrial contractions. Three cardiac function curves are illustrated with
different cardiac performances and two venous return curves are depicted
with different mean systemic filling pressures (MSFP) obtained by fluid
loading. In the curve representing decreased cardiac performance, point I
corresponds to a cardiac output which is barely increased by raising
MSFP through fluid loading as evidenced by point II signifying fluid
unresponsiveness. Point III is reached by increasing cardiac performance
not only moving the cardiac function curve upwards resulting in an
increase in cardiac output but lowering RAP as well with subsequent
increase in venous return without which no increase in cardiac output can
be accomplished. Below the critical pressure no increase in cardiac output
can be obtained through increasing contractility since no further increase
in venous return can be obtained (point IV). Instead cardiac output can be
augmented by increasing MSFP (point V)

making when solely using intramurally obtained cardiac filling
pressures, especially in mechanically ventilated patients [9].
Furthermore, the combination of cardiac filling pressures with
ventricular end-diastolic radius determines preload, which is
dependent on ventricular compliance varying largely between
patients and within patients when critically ill. Finally, even low
cardiac filling pressures do not imply that a patient is fluid
responsive (Fig. 3, point I→II). So despite the fact that central
venous pressure is a sufficient reflection of RAP as a
determinant of right ventricular filling, it is unable to function
as a reliable indicator, neither of preload nor of fluid
responsiveness. Even right and left ventricular end-diastolic
area or volume cannot establish the patient’s position on the
combined venous return/cardiac function curve as a decline in
cardiac performance decreases the slope of the relationship
between end-diastolic volume and stroke volume [16]. Right
and left ventricular end-diastolic area and volume can therefore
not accurately predict an increase in stroke volume upon fluid
loading either [2].
To test fluid responsiveness, a change in preload must be
provoked while monitoring the subsequent change in stroke
volume or its derivatives such as pulse pressure. In recent
years dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness have been
described using mechanical ventilation-induced changes in
preload resulting in variation of stroke volume or pulse
pressure, so-called stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse
pressure variation (PPV) respectively. Positive pressure
mechanical ventilation induces a reduction in left ventricular
preload mainly through a decrease in venous return [9]. So
when the patient’s position is on the steep portion of the
cardiac function curve, mechanical ventilation will induce a
larger decrease in stroke volume than when positioned on the
flat part of the curve. In other words, SVV induced by
mechanical ventilation will be higher when the patient
operates on the steep portion of the cardiac function curve
predicting an increase in stroke volume upon fluid loading.
SVV can be measured centrally by echocardiography but
this method is operator dependent and makes repeated
measurement of SVV cumbersome [17]. PPV is obtained
directly from the peripheral arterial pressure waveform while
SVV can be peripherally derived from subsequent pulse
contour analysis of this arterial pressure waveform. Both
peripherally derived dynamic parameters are an accurate
reflection of central SVV. Indeed, SVV as well as PPV have
been found to be far better predictors than static indicators
(Table 1) [1, 18–20]. A value above 12% has shown to be
highly predictive of fluid responsiveness. Dosing fluids on the
basis of these dynamic parameters proved feasible and
beneficial [21–23]. Dynamic parameters can also be
continuously derived by oesophageal Doppler monitoring or
even through non-invasive pulse oximeter plethysmography
with retained capability to predict fluid responsiveness
[24–26].
However, several limitations in the use of dynamic
parameters exist. First, controlled mechanical ventilation must
be present to induce the required changes in preload. SVV was
found to be inaccurate in patients with spontaneous breathing
activity [27]. Furthermore, tidal volumes have to be large enough
to facilitate significant changes in preload. SVV is unreliable as a
predictor of fluid responsiveness in case of tidal volumes <8 ml/
kg [28, 29]. Moreover, a regular heart rhythm has to be present as
determination of SVV and PPV becomes highly variable and
inaccurate with arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Finally,
mechanical ventilation can also induce a decrease in left
ventricular preload, primarily through increased RV afterload
instead of decreased venous return, especially in view of
pulmonary hypertension or RV failure [30, 31]. In that instance
a raised SVV does not predict fluid responsiveness and should
actually be avoided. This underlines the fact that both the left and
right ventricle must function on the ascending portion of the
cardiac function curve in order to be fluid responsive. Although
it is not possible to monitor continuously, echocardiographic
assessment of inferior and superior vena cava distensibility and
collapsibility, respectively, have shown to accurately predict fluid
responsiveness [32, 33]. Various other methods have been
developed, such as the end-expiratory occlusion test, upper
arm occlusion pressure and PEEP–induced increase in central
venous pressure, to predict fluid responsiveness while avoiding
many of the caveats existing for SVV and PPV [34–36].
Clinical use of fluid responsiveness
To predict fluid responsiveness, two methods must be
combined to generate the changes in preload on one hand
and to measure the subsequent changes in stroke volume on
the other hand. Both methods must be accurate, fast and easy to
use. Since most patients requiring resuscitation are breathing

spontaneously, a method other than mechanical ventilation to
facilitate changes in preload must be sought. A fluid challenge
can be administered, but since only approximately 50% of
critically ill patients respond to a fluid challenge, half of patients
will receive unnecessary fluid loading. Passive leg raising
(PLR) creates a contemporary increase in biventricular preload
with a maximum increase within a minute and has shown the
capability to predict fluid responsiveness (Fig. 4) [37].
Unsurprisingly, PLR has been demonstrated to be unreliable
in case of intra-abdominal hypertension, which impairs venous
return [38]. This method is unique in that it has repeatedly
shown to be highly predictive when measuring its response
on stroke volume even in situations with arrhythmia and
spontaneous breathing activity in contrast to SVV and PPV
[39, 40]. However, PLR may induce an alteration in vascular
compliance by the, potentially painful, postural change
reducing its predictive value of fluid responsiveness when
solely based on the response in pulse pressure [37].
Measurement of stroke volume can be done before and after
PLR by echocardiographic, arterial or oesophageal Doppler to
obtain the subsequent changes in stroke volume required for
fluid responsiveness prediction without the necessity of a
central venous or arterial catheter in place [41–44].
However, continuous tracking of stroke volume at the bedside
is preferable in clinical practice as it allows evaluation of fluid
responsiveness at any time with or without subsequent fluid
administrations. With the emergence of several pulse contour
analysis methods using the arterial pressure waveforms, stroke
volume can be measured continuously without the need for
invasive pulmonary artery catheterisation [45–47]. This stroke
volume calculation is primarily determined by the pressure decay
profile and magnitude of the arterial pressure for a given arterial
input impedance. However, very rapid changes in stroke volume
occurring during a single breath may not be accurately detected.
This can be explained by the possible change in arterial input
impedance used to calculate stroke volume [48]. Nevertheless,
pulse contour analysis has shown the ability to track the less
rapid changes in stroke volume induced by PLR with accurate
prediction of fluid responsiveness in patients with spontaneous
breathing activity [49]. PLR–induced changes in pulse pressure,
as a surrogate for stroke volume, has shown to predict the
response to fluid loading as well [50]. Nonetheless, changes in
cardiac output upon PLR have been demonstrated to have a
better predictive value compared with changes in pulse pressure
[39]. This difference can probably be explained by the fact that
pulse pressure is not only a direct measure of stroke volume, but
also depends on arterial compliance. In other words, the response
of arterial pressure upon fluid loading is dependent on arterial
tone in contrast to the response of stroke volume. This is
important because the aim of haemodynamic resuscitation is
not only maintaining adequate organ perfusion by optimising
cardiac output, but providing sufficient organ perfusion pressure
as well. The arterial pressure response upon fluid loading can be
predicted using the PPV to SVV ratio as measure of arterial tone
[51]. Since pulse contour analysis has the ability to measure PPV
as well as SVV, it is possible to predict ‘blood pressure
responsiveness’ besides fluid responsiveness.
Surprisingly, no consensus exists on the exact amount and
type of fluid loading nor the timing and cut-off value for cardiac
output defining fluid responders. Even the recommended
technique of stroke volume measurements or its derivatives such
as pulse pressure and cardiac output have not been agreed upon.
Although non-invasive measurement would be ideally suited for
patients on the ward or for critically ill patients on initial
presentation, plethysmographic waveform analysis has shown
to be a weak predictor of fluid responsiveness upon PLR in
patients with spontaneous breathing activity probably due to
acute changes in vasomotor tone [52]. In that respect
the emergence of non-invasive bioreactance cardiac output
measurements is promising, requiring only four electrodes
attached to the body with the ability to predict fluid
responsiveness upon PLR [53].
Fluid responsiveness assessment in daily medical practice is
feasible when combining an induced change in cardiac preload
while measuring the subsequent change in stroke volume or its
derivatives such as pulse pressure on the other hand. In this way,
one can dynamically elucidate the position of the patient on the
combined venous return/cardiac function curve (Fig. 3) and
predict the response to fluid loading. It is important to note that
a rise in the delivery of oxygen to the tissues to prevent or treat
organ hypoperfusion can be obtained through optimisation of the
concentration and saturation of haemoglobin besides an increase
in cardiac output. Even in the presence of increased delivery of
oxygen, impaired oxygen extraction and consumption can be
predominant, especially during sepsis. Furthermore, cardiac
output is not only determined by preload and contractility, but
in particular by afterload and heart rate as well, making the
increase in cardiac output by fluid loading just part of the
solution. Echocardiography remains advocated in unexplained
haemodynamic instability to provide important information
regarding contractility and loading conditions of the heart.
Finally, trials outside the operating theatre with hard clinical
endpoints on morbidity and mortality are needed to validate
and stimulate the assessment of fluid responsiveness in critically
ill patients.
Fig. 4 Passive leg raising (PLR) can be performed by elevating the limbs
while placing the patient in the supine position to transfer blood both from
the lower limbs as from the abdominal compartment creating a sufficient
venous return to significantly elevate biventricular preload. Alternatively,
classic PLR can be performed by merely elevating the legs with the
patient in supine position

Conclusion
‘To fill or not to fill’, that is the question frequently faced by
physicians caring for haemodynamically unstable critically ill
patients. To successfully predict fluid responsiveness, the
response of stroke volume to fluid loading, two requirements
must be met: on one hand a change in preload must be generated
as well as measuring the subsequent changes in stroke volume or
its derivatives such as pulse pressure on the other hand. Static
markers of cardiac preload are therefore unable to predict fluid
responsiveness with dynamic markers being superior. However,
a regular heart rhythm and mechanical ventilation without
spontaneous breathing activity with larger than currently
recommended tidal volumes are necessary for dynamic
parameters to predict fluid responsiveness limiting its clinical
application. Passive leg raising is an easy alternative tool that can
be applied at the bedside to effectively change preload
temporarily. Increases in cardiac output by passive leg raising
predict fluid responsiveness despite spontaneous breathing
activity or cardiac arrhythmias. When used in combination with
a direct measure of continuously tracking stroke volume and/or
its derivatives, physicians are enabled to prevent and treat organ
hypoperfusion at any time, while avoiding unnecessary and
potentially harmful fluid loading and inotropics. Understanding
the basic concepts of the connection between venous return and
cardiac function is pivotal to accomplish tailor-made fluid
titration in the treatment of haemodynamically unstable critically
ill patients.
