Abstract
Background Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)
is a rare genetic disorder caused by chronic uncontrolled
complement activation.
Case-diagnosis/treatment We present a 4-year-old girl with
aHUS who had multiple severe clinical manifestations of
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) including acute kidney
injury, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiorespiratory arrest.
She was managed with intensive plasma exchange and hemodialysis, which could not halt the progression of TMA. The
initial single dose of eculizumab only temporarily improved
the clinical symptoms of TMA. Sustained improvement of
renal, hematological, and cardiac values were only achieved
upon institution of chronic treatment with eculizumab. During
long-term treatment with eculizumab (>2.5 years), she has had
no further clinical manifestations of TMA, and required neither plasma exchange nor hemodialysis.
Conclusion Chronic eculizumab treatment was associated
with control of complement-mediated TMA and sustained
long-term improvement in renal and cardiac function.
Background
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare genetic
disorder caused by chronic uncontrolled complement activation [1, 2]. Although complement mutations have been found
in 50–70 % of patients with aHUS, identification of a genetic
mutation is not necessary for diagnosis or treatment initiation
[3]. aHUS is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and multiple organ damage, which result in
significant morbidity and mortality [4]. Despite supportive
management, including plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI),
33–40 % of patients progress to end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) or die at the first clinical manifestation [1, 4, 5]. Thus,
there remains a need for new therapeutic strategies [6].
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to terminal complement protein C5 that prevents activation of the
terminal complement pathway by binding C5 and inhibiting
generation of pro-inflammatory C5a and the lytic C5b-9
membrane-attack complex. It is licensed for treatment of
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and aHUS
(Soliris® SmPC, Alexion Europe). We report on a severely
ill child with aHUS treated with eculizumab. The patient
was initially managed with intensive PE, but clinical manifestations of aHUS were observed, including laboratory
evidence of TMA and organ damage. A single dose of
eculizumab initially led to marked improvement in renal
function, but the clinical manifestations of TMA were again
seen after 6 weeks. Chronic eculizumab treatment was introduced to maintain complete blockade of complement
activation, which correlated with clinical improvement
(Soliris® SmPC).
Case report
A severely ill 1-year-old Caucasian girl with a several-day
history of vomiting and refusal to eat presented on 31
December 2008 with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,
acute renal insufficiency, and intussusception. Schistocytes
on peripheral blood film, elevated lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) 2674 U/l (normal range: 216–360 U/l), decreased
platelets 108×109

elevated creatinine 221 μmol/l (normal range: 35–55 μmol/
l) and urea 234 mg/dl (normal range: 7–21 mg/dl), and
reduced hemoglobin (Hb) 6.5 mg/dl (normal range: 10–
14 mg/dl) and albumin 2.76 g/dl (normal range: 3.5–5.5 g/
dl) were detected. Activity of ADAMTS-13 (Von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease) was within the normal range
(83 %), thus excluding thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [7]. Complement levels were within the normal
range: C3, 94 mg/dl (normal range: 85–120 mg/dl); C4,
16 mg/dl (normal range: 15–40 mg/dl). As stool cultures
for Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Candida were all
negative, she was diagnosed with aHUS. Initial management comprised multiple blood transfusions, intensive plasma exchange (2–3 sessions per week), and hemodialysis.
These interventions initially improved diuresis, the patient’s
creatinine decreasing to a minimum of 94 μmol/l, but she
continued to be hospitalized, to need repeated blood transfusions, have severe proteinuria (233 mg/dl), and suffer
from hypertension (blood pressure increasing to 128/
95 mmHg in the days following presentation) and edema.
During the following weeks, she also suffered multiple
catheter infections and had to maintain a nasogastric tube
for feeding. Overall, the clinical status of the patient further
deteriorated, presenting 17 February 2009 with acute renal
insufficiency, severe anemia, macroscopic hematuria, proteinuria, arterial hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Laboratory values showed decreased platelet count (132×
109
/l), an elevated LDH of 1740 U/l and continued anemia
(Hb 7.1 mg/dl), and elevated serum creatinine (187 μmol/l).
The child also experienced cardiorespiratory arrest requiring
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation.
Genetic analysis revealed a mutation in the C-terminal region
of complement factor H (CFH) (a novel heterozygous mutation; 3355 G>A; Asp1119Asn; SCR19), with normal membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and Factor I, and no CFH
autoantibodies. PE (fresh–frozen plasma, 2–3 times per week)
was continued for the next 3 months, with blood transfusions
given as required. The patient’s anti-hypertensive therapy
(hydralazine, nifedipine, labetalol, and urapidil) was also continued (Fig. 1). She experienced pulmonary edema in March
and again in May. Myocardial dysfunction was diagnosed and
an ejection fraction of 32 % (normal values: 56–78 %) was
measured in May. Due to concerns that this was caused by
fluid overload from PE, PE and hemodialysis were tapered.
This led to an improvement in renal function, but she continued to receive antihypertensive treatment and multiple blood
transfusions (Fig. 1).
In July, when the patient presented again with cardiac
dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 31 %, with moderately controlled blood pressure (100/85) and not managed
with PE, the decision was made to initiate treatment with
eculizumab; she received one 600-mg eculizumab infusion
(at this time, the patient was vaccinated against Neisseria
meningococcus serotypes A and Cm, and antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin was provided). Eculizumab treatment
led to normalization of renal and ventricular function, stabilization of hematologic parameters, and blockade of terminal complement activity (Fig. 1).
As the eculizumab dose was not repeated, and terminal
complement blockade not maintained, TMA complications
were seen again after 8 weeks (mid-September 2009), when
the patient presented with renal insufficiency (creatinine,
141 μmol/l) and evidence of hemolysis and platelet consumption (LDH, 760 U/l; platelet count, 151×109
/l). Chronic eculizumab treatment was initiated following the
recommended dosing by weight (5–10 kg) (Soliris® SmPC):
initial dose 600 mg, followed by 300 mg every 2–3 weeks.
At this time, the patient’s antihypertensive treatment was
stopped. Creatinine started to improve prior to eculizumab
initiation but levels normalized after 6 days of resuming
eculizumab treatment (Fig. 1) and cardiac function improved. LDH levels stabilized but remained elevated
(Fig. 1); the complement activity assay showed immediate,
sustained blockade of terminal complement activation; and
platelet counts remained within the normal range (Fig. 1).
The elevated LDH was not the result of anemia, as Hb levels
were normal (10 mg/dl) and no schistocytes were seen, with
no further need for RBC transfusions.
At last follow-up visit (14 November 2011; >2.5 years
since admission), the patient remained on chronic eculizumab treatment; no new clinical complications of TMA have
occurred while receiving treatment, and no blood transfusion, plasma exchange, or hemodialysis has been necessary.
Serum creatinine is 26.5 μmol/l, and serum protein 34 mg/
dl, equivalent to 12 mg/m2
/h. No further indication of hypertension or cardiac insufficiency has been noted and her
ejection fraction has been normalized (64–70 %). The patient has gained 6 kg of weight and her overall health has
improved and normalized entirely. She shows a completely
normal development and full recovery of a good quality of
life as reported by her parents.
During the >2.5-year period of chronic eculizumab treatment, measurements of complement activity have shown
complete terminal complement blockade, which corroborate
the clinical data of no manifestations of TMA (Fig. 1).
Discussion
PE has been used historically for the management of aHUS
[1], but in the present case, progressive renal deterioration
and an increased need for blood transfusions was seen
despite PE (2–3 sessions per week for 16 weeks). Progressive cardiac dysfunction was also detected. Blockade of the
terminal complement protein C5 with eculizumab is a
rational treatment for aHUS that directly targets chronic

uncontrolled complement activity [6]. As demonstrated by
the present case, a single infusion can have an immediate
effect, but can only achieve terminal complement blockade
for a short duration. A reduced dose or discontinuation of
eculizumab treatment has previously been shown to lead to
rapid deterioration in organ function [6, 8, 9]. Indeed, in the
recent aHUS clinical trials with eculizumab, five of 18
patients who discontinued eculizumab experienced severe
TMA complications following the missed eculizumab dose
(Soliris® SmPC).
In this patient, following discontinuation of eculizumab,
reinitiation of eculizumab therapy rapidly restored the clinical and biological parameters. However, several cases have
been reported in literature where this has not been possible
and reinitiation of eculizumab therapy following discontinuation cannot be counted on to salvage organ function [6].

was started at the time of diagnosis, but the child experienced
clinical manifestations of
thrombotic microangiopathy
(TMA) after approximately
7 weeks. Following cessation
of plasma exchange, a single
dose of eculizumab 600 mg was
given (green arrow), which
resulted in stabilization of renal
and hematologic function. After
approximately 8 weeks, clinical
manifestations became apparent
again as no complement inhibition was present, after which
continuous eculizumab treatment was reinitiated (initial
dose 600 mg, followed by
300 mg every 2–3 weeks).

This patient maintained an elevated LDH (a measure of
tissue damage and/or hemolysis), although the level stabilized during eculizumab treatment. The elevated level may
be the result of organ damage, as no further anemia and
thrombocytopenia were detected. Complement activation
can be further amplified by common triggers such as infection. In our patient, this manifested as a large, transient
increase in LDH during a respiratory tract infection. However, despite this increase, there was no evidence of
complement-mediated TMA during eculizumab treatment;
renal function remained stable and hematologic function
was rapidly normalized without a requirement for blood
transfusions.
In contrast to PE, eculizumab treatment inhibits the
underlying process of chronic uncontrolled complement
activation. Thus, chronic eculizumab treatment permanently suppresses clinical manifestations of TMA. Cardiac function markedly improved in this patient during
eculizumab treatment. The acute cardiac failure in February 2009 could have been caused by fluid overload
due to PE and high BP. However, the persistent cardiomyopathy could not have been caused by elevated
blood pressure or fluid overload alone as cardiomyopathy persisted well after PE had been terminated (April
2009) and blood pressure was fairly controlled, and did
not improve until after chronic eculizumab therapy was
initiated, thus suggesting TMA could be one of the
causes. No histological studies of the myocardium were,
however, conducted.
Long-term inhibition of chronic uncontrolled complement activation and complement-mediated TMA was accompanied by general improvement in the child’s clinical
condition, including appropriate weight gain and a lack of
subsequent events. The child has been treated for more than
2.5 years and treatment is well tolerated.
In conclusion, these findings are consistent with previous
case reports of eculizumab in patients with aHUS, in which
treatment was associated with control of complementmediated TMA [6, 8, 9]. In addition, terminal complement
blockade with eculizumab was directly correlated with sustained, long-term (>2.5 years) marked improvements in
renal and cardiac function. Interruption of eculizumab treatment led to a rapid return of the clinical manifestations of
TMA, but improvement and stabilization of organ function
and hematological values was restored upon reinitiation of
therapy in this case.
