(2) It might extend the effective limit of the treatment by destroying microscopic metastases in more proximal tissue than could
be included in the dissection.
(3) Should any lymph nodes be inadvertently left behind they
would be less likely to contain viable tumour cells. Radiographs
taken during the operation would occasionally be of benefit in
detecting lymph nodes overlooked during the dissection.
(4) It might give diagnostic information about metastases not
clinically detectable.
The survival rates for the stage II patients was 52.6% compared with 10% for patins treated by operation alone. So
far as such small numbers are comparable they suggest that the
theoretical advantages may be fulfilled.
This has been a study of endolymphatic therapy, aimed
chiefly at the nodes and to a less extent at lymph pathways
leading to them from the primary lesion. It is, however,
impossible to leave the discussion without comment on the
initial treatment of the prmary lesion. Many of our patients
Eave undoubtedly lost their lives through inadequate initial
treatment. Despite almost universal agreement in the literature
about the need for wide excision and grafting or local amputation, we still see patients in whom the primary has been cut
into, partly excised, or excised with little or no margin. Despite
further excisions recurrence is very likely or has indeed taken
place, and is then highly dangerous.
A group of 50 patients with malignant melanoma of the skin
followed for periods up to four years after treatment are
reviwed.
Clinical staging analogous to that used for other forms of
malignancy, such as breast carcinoma, has proved useful in
prognosis and managenent. All patients had excision of the
primary followed by intralymphatic injection of 131I in ultrafluid Lipiodol in dosages up to 35 mCi for each ilio-inguinal
or 30 mCi for each axillary route. Clinical stage II patients
whose nodes were palpably involved were treated four weeks
later by block dissection.
Comparison with a group of patients clinically staged in the
same way but treated without 18I1 injection suggested that endolymphatic therapy may have beneficially influenced the early
survival rate.
There were no deaths due to treatment. Complications were
few and were of a minor nature.
We are grateful to many colleagues at St. Thomas's Hospital and
elsewhere who have referred patients for treatment, and to other
members of the staff of our department who have helped in this
study. We are particularly indebted to Dr. T. M. Gimlette, of the
isotope laboratory, Dr. J. A. Fleming, of the radiotherapy department, and Dr. W. F. Clapham, of the physics department, for their
assistance. Dr. W. Charlton, of the Radiochemical Centre, has
helped us particularly by perfecting the isotope preparation. We
are also 'grateful for financial support in the study from the Endowment Funds of St. Thomas's Hospital, the Medical Research
Council, and Messrs. McCarthy Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to report the development of
pulmonary hypertension as a complication of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (Cook, Hou, Ho, and McFadzean, 1954;
Ong, 1962). Evidence is presented which is consistent with
the complication being due to repeated "silent" pulmonary
microembolism and with the emboli having their origin within
the liver. So far as we are aware this complication of cholangitis has not been described previously.
Case Reports
During periods of observation ranging from 2 to 12 years
14 patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis developed
clinical, radiological, and electrocardiographic evidence of pulmonary. hypertension. Males and females were equal in number, and their ages ranged from 29 to 49 years. AU but two
had a history of frequent exacerbations of pyogenic cholangitis
of varying severity over periods ranging from 8 to 15 years.
In the two exceptions the exacerbations occurred at most twice
a year for 12 and 15 years respectively. An additional patient
who presented with pulmonary hypertension was a man aged
21 who had had irregular attacks of fever, commonly associated
with distending discomfort over the liver, since the age of 16.
In that time there had been three attacks of lancinating right
upper quadrant pain associated with repeated vomiting, high
fever, and jaundice. He was first seen in the third attack. Six
of the 15 patients gave a history of haemoptysis during one
or more of the acute exacerbations, and four, three of whom had
haemoptysis, had a history of recurrent attacks of pleuritic
pain. None had experienced acute dyspnoea. In all cases
the majority of the exacerbations had been treated with an antibiotic or antibiotics.
The radiological findings were similar in all. There was
right ventricular enlargement. The pulmonary artery and its
main branches were dilated, but the peripheral branches showed
abrupt tapering. In none was the left atrium enlarged, and
there was no evidence of intrinsic disease of the lungs. The
electrocardiograms showed prominent pulmonary P waves and

evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. In two instances
the pressure in the pulmonary artery was measured. The
phasic pressure was 82/42 (mean, 56) mm. Hg in one and
76/39 (mean, 52) mm. Hg in the other.
At laparotomy, which was performed before the development of evidence of pulmonary hypertension in all save the
patient aged 21 referred to above, all were found to have calculi
in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts. The livers without
exception were grossly and irregularly scarred, and sections of
surgical biopsies showed the histological features of well-established recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (Cook et al., 1954; Ong,
1962). Culture of bile obtained from the common hepatic duct
by aspiration at operation yielded Eschericia coli in 12 instances
and Salmonella sendai and S. paratyphi-A each in one instance.
No growth was obtained from the remaining specimen, but
subsequently E. coli was isolated from bile draining from a
T-tube in the common bile duct.
Contact with six of the patients has been lost. Eight of the
remaining nine have died-six in hospital-but permission
for a necropsy was obtained in only three. In each case the
right ventricle was hypertrophied and dilated. The pulmonary
artery and its larger branches were dilated and atheromatous.
On histological examination in all three cases numerous thrombi
were found in the smaller branches of the pulmonary artery.
The diameter of the arteries involved, including the vessel wall,
was of the order of 0.3 mm. or less. The thrombi were scattered irregularly throughout both lungs, and were in varying
stages of organization and recanalization. In one instance, in
which death had occurred during an acute exacerbation of the
cholangitis, recent unorganized thrombi were also found, and
these were associated with an inflammatory reaction in the wall
of the artery and heavy infiltration with polymorphonuclear
leucocytes.
The livers in all three cases showed the changes encountered
in long-standing pyogenic cholangitis (Cook et al., 1954; Ong,
1962). The distortion of the liver architecture was such that
it was impossible to examine the hepatic venous tree adequately.
All that can be said is that the right, middle, and left hepatic
veins were not thrombosed, nor were any of their major
branches.
The 15 cases of pulmonary hypertension occurred in a consecutive series of 728 patients with pyogenic cholangitis, an
incidence of 2.1 %. Of the 728 254 had a history of eight years
or more, and in 157 of these the acute exacerbations occurred
with great frequency. The incidence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with a history of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis
for eight years or more was 5.5 %, and the incidence in those
with cholangitis for the same period but with frequent exacerbations was 7.6%.
Three of the 713 patients with pyogenic cholangitis but without pulmonary hypertension had multiple small metastatic
abscesses in the lungs, and one had a history of haemoptysis
early in the acute exacerbation, which in each case was severe.
None had received antibiotics before admission to hospital,
which in all three was late in the course of the exacerbation.
The records of the remaining 710 patients were reviewed to
determine the frequency of occurrence of unexplained haemoptysis during exacerbations. In 15 (2.1 %) there was a history of
such haemoptysis in one or more of the exacerbations. Eight
of the 15 have been observed for from 1.5 to 17 years and none
has developed evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Culture of peripheral venous blood was positive in 15.1 o
of all acute exacerbations in which it was done. But cultures
of blood obtained from the right atrium were positive in 23
(30.60%) out of 72 patients.
Discussion
It would seem reasonable to assume that the disorder which
allowed of the slow and virtually " silent" development of
pulmonary hypertension in all 15 patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis was the same as that encountered in the three
patients at necropsy-that is, repeated thromboembolism of the
smaller pulmonary arteries. Such " silent " repeated pulmonary
embolism has been recognized relatively recently to be a far
from uncommon cause of pulmonary hypertension (subacute
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, Wood, 1959). The
subject has been reviewed by Fleischner (1967).
There are good reasons for believing that the emboli were
derived from thrombi within the liver. Firstly, among the
Chinese thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension has been
encountered only in association with pyogenic cholangitis. In
19 years one of us (A. J. S. M.) has never encountered pulmonary embolism derived from a thrombus in the pelvic or leg
veins, nor, in an even longer period, has the professor of obstetrics encountered post-partum pulmonary embolism. Further,
at necropsy on a series of 50 subjects who died in circumstances
likely in the West to be associated with pulmonary embolism
dissection of the pelvic and leg veins failed to reveal evidence
of thrombosis, and neither macroscopic nor microscopic
emboli were found on examination of the lungs. Secondly,
the occurrence in three patients, late in the course of an untreated exacerbation of pyogenic cholangitis, of multiple metastatic abscesses in the lungs due to the same organism, subsequently isolated from the bile, clearly incriminates the liver.
It is not possible to state whether all emboli initially were
infected or not, but polymorphonuclear infiltration of the
arterial wall in proximity to recent emboli, in the only patient
with pulmonary hypertension with such, suggests that this
might well have been the case.
Digby (1930), who in a paper entitled " Common-duct
Stones of Liver Origin," first drew attention to the occurrence
of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis in Hong Kong, stated that
before the second world war multiple metastatic abscesses in
the lungs were not uncommon complications (personal communication). This has certainly not been so since 1948,
for there were but three patients with metastatic abscesses in
a consecutive series of 728 (0.4%). These three did not receive
any antibiotic before admission, which took place late in a
severe exacerbation. It is possible that if the patients who subsequently developed pulmonary hypertension had not been
treated with any antibiotic they would have developed in its
stead multiple metastatic pulmonary abscesses.
Because of the relatively small calibre of the arteries
obstructed it is probable that the emboli had their origins in
small vessels in- the liver. A greatly scarred liver was common
to all patients with pulmonary hypertension, and there is evidence that the emboli may have originated in portal-hepatic
venous shunts within the scars.
It has been claimed that thrombosis of the hepatic veins
occurs at an early stage in pyogenic infection of the liver, and
that the hepatic veins are more often attacked by pyogenic
disease in the liver than the portal veins (Rolleston and McNee,
1929; Sherlock, 1963). If this were indeed so such would be
the obvious source of the emboli. But clinical and radiological
evidence led McFadzean, Chang, and Wong (1953) to the conclusion that the phase of rapid extension of abscesses within the
liver was the consequence of involvement of an intrahepatic
branch of the portal vein, and Teoh (personal communication)
has found abundant histological evidence that such is the case.
In a study of injection-corrosion preparations of the liver in
pyogenic cholangitis McFadzean and Todd (1956) found that
the peribiliary plexus, which is formed from branches of the
hepatic artery and of the portal vein and which surrounds
the variably dilated bile ducts, was greatly increased. They
further found that on the injection of fluorescein into the
portal vein at laparotomy no fluorescence occurred over the
visible, dilated ducts beneath the liver capsule, whereas they
fluoresced intensely when the injection was made into the
hepatic artery. It would seem that all the branches of the

portal vein to the peribiliary plexus are veins of drainage, and
they are probably the route along which infection extends from
the ducts to involve the larger intrahepatic branches. Portalhepatic venous shunts of greatly varying calibre develop in the
scars, and the portal components of the majority of these have
their origin in the peribiliary plexus. Importantly, in sections
of specimens of liver obtained during or shortly after acute
exacerbations the vessels in the scars commonly show the histological appearance of acute pylephlebitis. We believe that these
portal-hepatic shunts are the source of the pulmonary microemboli and that they account for the ease with which the
causal organisms, even early in acute exacerbations, gain access
to the right heart.
Summary
In a consecutive series of 728 patients with rcurrent pyogenic
cholangitis 15 (2.1 %) developed pulmonary hypertension. However, the incidence among those with a history of frequent acute
exacerbations for more than eight years was 7.6%. At laparotomy, which in 14 antedated the development of the pulmonary
hypertension, all were found to have greatly scarred livers and
all had stones in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts.
The findings at necropsy on 3 of the 15 patients were consistent with the pulmonary hypertension being due to repeated
pulmonary microembolism. It is concluded that the emboli had
their origin in vessels within the liver, and it is suggested that
the vessels concerned were the portal-hepatic venous shunts
within scars. The portal components of these shunts have
been shown to be mainly derived from the peribiliary plexus,
and the shunts have been found commonly to show the histological changes of acute pylephlebitis.
It would appear that, before the introduction of antibiotics,
metastatic pulmonary abscesses were a not infrequent complication of pyogenic cholangitis. Subsequent to their introduction this complication has become distinctly uncommon.
It is thought possible that if the exacerbations of cholangitis
in those who developed pulmonary hypertension had not been
treated with any antibiotic, metastatic pulmonary abscesses
would have developed instead.
We wish to acknowledge our indebtedness to the late, Professor
Hou Pao Chang, who was responsible for the necropsies on the
first two patients, and to Professor J. B. Gibson, who was responsible for that on the third.

B.C.G. Vaccination of Children against Leprosy in Uganda: Results
at End of Second Follow-up

A controlled trial of B.C.G. vaccine in the prevention of
leprosy was begun in the Teso district of Eastern Uganda in
September 1960. By September 1962 17,397 children, more
than 80% of whom were under 10 years of age, had been
included. All those included were related to or had been in
contact with known leprosy patients; all had been examined
and found to be free of skin lesions due to leprosy.
The great majority of the children had either negative reactions to an initial Heaf tuberculin test or Grade I or Grade II
positive reactions, and all these children were allocated alternately to an unvaccinated group and a B.C.G.-vaccinated group.
Those in the vaccinated group were given a single dose of freezedried vaccine, prepared by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. from the
Copenhagen substrain of B.C.G. Those with Grade III or
Grade IV positive reactions at the initial test (1,096 children)
were all left unvaccinated. No B.C.G. vaccine has been given
subsequently to any of these children, whether they were vaccinated or left unvaccinated at the time of intake.
In the course of the first follow-up of the participants, between May 1963 and May 1964, more than 94% of the children
were seen and examined for leprosy. A total of 116 cases of
leprosy were reported during the period of one to three years
since entry, the incidence of these early manifestations of the
disease among the vaccinated children being one-fifth of that
among the corresponding unvaccinated group (Kinnear Brown
and Stone, 1966).
While the first follow-up was in progress a further 1,926
young children, nearly all of whom were aged 2 years or less
and had been born into the trial families since the initial intake,
were admitted to the trial without tuberculin testing, and were
allocated alternately to the unvaccinated and the B.C.G.-vaccinated groups. The purpose of this subsidiary intake was to
increase the numbers of very young children under study, so as
to permit in due course a more precise assessment of the efficacy
of vaccination soon after birth.
The second follow-up of all the participants in the main
intake (and the first follow-up of those in the subsidiary intake)
began in July 1964 and ended in March 1966. The present
report gives the results of the trial at the end of this second
follow-up. Full details of the plan and conduct of the trial
were given by Kinnear Brown and Stone (1966).
Examinations during the Second Folow-up
The procedures for visiting the eitelas (the rural population
units), for identifying the participants in the trial and for
examining them for signs of leprosy were the same during the
second follow-up as they were during the first (Kinnear Brown
and Stone, 1966). In particular, the arrangements for placing
