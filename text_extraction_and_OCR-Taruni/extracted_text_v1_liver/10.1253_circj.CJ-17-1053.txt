(HCC) in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.3–14 It 
has been estimated that, annually, 1.5–5.0% of patients 
with liver cirrhosis (LC) may develop HCC.6 However, the 
appropriate interval for screening of liver function is 
unknown.15
A long duration after the Fontan procedure (>20 years) 
is one of the risk factors for LC, and hyaluronic acid and 
γ-guanosine triphosphate (γ-GTP) have been reported to 
be useful markers to evaluate the progression of liver fibrosis in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.16 The aim 
of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of LC 
and/or HCC after the Fontan procedure and to elucidate 
The Fontan procedure is currently accepted as the 
final palliative surgery in patients with single ventricle physiology. However, the lack of a subpulmonary ventricle alters static resistance and dynamic 
impedance, resulting in a profound effect on the hepatic 
circulation. Long-term hepatic dysfunction is a significant 
late complication in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure1 and is known as Fontan-associated liver disease 
(FALD). Hepatic complications, such as hepatic fibrosis 
or cirrhosis, develop as a result of increased hepatic venous 
pressure, tissue hypoxia, and decreased cardiac output.2,3

Background: Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is an important late complication involving liver dysfunction, such as liver 
cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. However, the prevalence, clinical 
manifestation, and methods of diagnosis of FALD are still not well established.
Methods and Results: This study comprised 2 nationwide surveys in Japan. First, the prevalence of LC and/or HCC in patients 
undergoing the Fontan procedure was determined. Second, clinical manifestations in patients with LC and/or HCC were analyzed, 
along with data from blood tests, echocardiography, and right heart catheterization. In the 1st survey, of the 2,700 patients who 
underwent the Fontan procedure, 31 were diagnosed with LC and/or HCC (1.15%), and 5 died due to liver diseases (mortality: 
0.19%). In the 2nd survey, data were collected from 17 patients (12 with LC, 2 with HCC, and 3 with LC+HCC. Of these 17 patients, 
5 died (mortality: 29.4%). The mean age at diagnosis of LC and HCC was 23 and 31 years, respectively. Computed tomography 
followed by ultrasound was most frequently used for diagnosis. Blood tests revealed low platelet counts, increased hemoglobin, 
aspartate aminotransferase, γ-guanosine triphosphate, and total bilirubin levels, and an elevated international normalized ratio of 
prothrombin time.
Conclusions: LC and/or HCC in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure were not rare late complications and were associated 
with high mortality rates.

and/or HCC; and (3) whether routine diagnostic imaging 
for liver dysfunction was performed and, if so, what imaging modalities were used?
In the 2nd survey, questionnaires were sent to the facilities where patients with LC and/or HCC after the Fontan 
procedure were followed-up. These questionnaires contained 7 questions: (1) basic diagnosis of congenital heart 
disease (CHD); (2) history of cardiac surgery; (3) history 
of viral hepatitis infections; (4) date and method of diagnosis and treatment of liver disease; (5) laboratory data, 
including blood tests, echocardiography, and heart catheterization; (6) performance status, as per the New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure classification, 
and cardiac function; and (7) outcome or death.
Statistical Analysis
Unless stated otherwise, data are expressed as the 
mean±SD or as percentages. All statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS version 22 for Windows (IBM, New 
York, NY, USA). However, because the study involved a 
nationwide survey, no comparison analysis was conducted.
Ethical Considerations
In the present study, we adhered to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All surveys were collected as anonymized data, and no personal information was identified. 
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of Chiba Cardiovascular Center and St. Luke’s International Hospital.
Results
The 1st Survey
Effective answers were received from 97 of 175 institutes 
(55%). Of these 97 institutes, 72 were registered and followed-up 2,700 patients who underwent the Fontan procedure. Of these 2,700 patients, 31 (1.15%) were diagnosed 
with LC and/or HCC, and 5 patients died due to liver diseases (mortality: 0.19%). Of the 72 institutes conducting 
routine diagnostic imaging to detect liver dysfunction, 17 
(24%) used ultrasound, 9 (13%) used computed tomography (CT), and 4 (6%) used magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). In institutes using one or more imaging modalities, 
all methods were counted.
The 2nd Survey
Seventeen patients had LC and/or HCC after the Fontan 
procedure: 12 had LC, 2 had HCC, and 3 had LC+HCC. 
The mean (range) age at first diagnosis of LC and HCC 
was 23 (13–34) and 31 (22–44) years, respectively. The mean 
(range) age at the first Fontan procedure was 8.2 (1–15) 
years. The mean (range) period from the first Fontan procedure until the diagnosis of LC and/or HCC was 14.5 
(5–24) and 21.6 (7–31) years, respectively. Ten patients had 
Fontan conversion (8 with total cavopulmonary connection [TCPC] conversion and 2 with no detailed information regarding the method of Fontan conversion). The 
primary diagnosis revealed CHD with cases of tricuspid 
atresia (n=6), complete atrioventricular septal defects 
(n=3), congenital corrected transposition of the great 
arteries (n=2), and others (n=6). There were 3 patients who 
were positive for hepatic virus C (HCV) infection: 1 was 
HCV-RNA negative, and 1 had a history of interferon 
treatment. Only 1 patient with HCV had HCC and was 
alive. The other patients with LC and/or HCC after the 
specific clinical manifestations of FALD.
Methods
Study Design and Study Subjects
This study comprised 2 nationwide surveys in Japan conducted by the Research Committee of Japanese Society of 
Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery (JPCCS). The 
1st survey was conducted in 2008 and the 2nd survey was 
conducted in 2009.
LC is defined as an irreversible condition of liver dysfunction due to long-term damage. HCC is a cancerous 
state diagnosed by a doctor with imaging modalities or 
biopsy.
In the 1st survey, questionnaires were sent to 175 facilities belonging to the JPCCS. The questionnaires contained 
3 questions: (1) the number of patients undergoing the 
Fontan procedure; (2) the number of patients undergoing 
the Fontan procedure diagnosed with or suspected of LC

Discussion
In 2014, 397 Fontan procedures were performed in Japan.17
We can estimate that the number of Fontan procedures 
over a recent 10-year period is approximately 400/year. 
The present study covered a 10-year period, and therefore 
this nationwide survey covered approximately 60% of 
patients undergoing the Fontan procedure in Japan. From 
Fontan procedure had no history of viral hepatitis.
Using the NYHA system resulted in 3 patients classified 
as Class I, 9 classified as Class II, and 4 classified as Class 
III (4); classification was not available for 1 patient. Other 
complications included 10 patients with atrial tachycardias, 4 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas, 1 
patient with venovenous collateral, and 1 patient with 
protein losing enteropathy (Table 1). Blood tests revealed 
low platelet counts (118±53×103/mm3), increased hemoglobin (15.3±2.6g/dL), γ-GTP (168.3±168.6IU/L), and total 
bilirubin (1.69±0.71mg/dL), and an elevated international 
normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR; 1.67±0.51). 
Mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 35.7±27.7U/L) 
was slightly increased, but mean alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT; 22.2±16.9U/L) was near normal. The other items 
in the blood tests were within normal limits (Table 2). 
Echocardiography revealed that the ejection fraction was 
>50% in 6 patients, 40–50% in 6 patients, and <40% in 3 
patients (Table 3).
For the 17 patients with LC and/or HCC (12 with LC, 2 
with HCC, and 3 with LC+HCC), the diagnostic procedures used to diagnose LC (multiple answers possible) 
were 9 ultrasounds, 9 CT scans, 1 biopsy, 1 radioisotope 
study, and 1 blood test; for HCC, the diagnostic procedures were 4 ultrasounds, 5 CT scans, and 1 biopsy. The 
treatments for LC (multiple answers possible) included 
ursodeoxycholic acid (n=2), lactulose (n=2), kanamycin 
(n=1), heart-lung transplantation (n=1), and no medication (n=7). The treatments for HCC included transcatheter 
arterial embolization (n=3), chemotherapy (n=2), and no 
indication (n=1). Five patients died (mortality: 29.4%); 1 
patient with LC and 2 patients with LC and HCC died due 
to hepatic failure (mortality of LC and/or HCC: 17.6%). 
Two patients with LC died during the perioperative period 
(TCPC conversion; death: 11.8%). One patient died due to 
an acute-on-chronic liver failure from LC, and the remaining 2 patients died due to HCC and LC. The detailed

results in damage in Zone 3 of the liver. Damaged hepatocytes induce fibrosis, which leads to LC. Moreover, the 
follow-up of patients undergoing the Fontan procedure 
revealed that the systemic venous pressure was 3- to 4-fold 
higher than normal, which leads to chronically elevated 
right atrial pressure, which, in turn, increases hepatic vein 
pressure.2,3 Increased hepatic vein pressure is also a cause 
of FALD. A recent study confirmed that time after the 
Fontan procedure was the only factor significantly associated with collagen deposition, which suggested that liver 
fibrosis was an inherent feature of Fontan physiology.20
However, no inflammation or hepatocellular damage was 
evident in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure, suggesting that fibrosis may be mediated by a non-inflammatory mechanism.21
We could not determine the most reliable marker for 
the detection of liver disease in patients undergoing the 
Fontan procedure in the present study. However, although 
the mean ALT level was within the normal range, the mean 
AST level was higher than the normal range, suggesting 
that the AST/ALT ratio may be a suitable marker to detect 
liver disease in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. 
Moreover, we should pay attention to low platelet counts, 
increased hemoglobin, γ-GTP, and total bilirubin, and 
elevated PT-INR. These laboratory data may indicate liver 
disease in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.
In the present study, the mortality of liver diseases in 
patients who underwent the Fontan procedure was very 
low (5/2,700; 0.19%). However, the mortality was nearly 
this viewpoint, the primary finding of the present crosssectional study was that the prevalence of HCC was estimated to be 0.18%, and the mortality of HCC was as high 
as 40% among patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. 
Moreover, more than 1% of patients who underwent the 
Fontan procedure had LC and/or HCC. Blood tests 
confirmed low platelet, increased hemoglobin, γ-GTP, and 
total bilirubin, and an elevated PT-INR. However, these 
blood tests were not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of 
LC and/or HCC. These results suggest that hepatic imaging modalities are essential for the detection of liver disease 
in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. Previous 
studies showed that LC may develop into HCC in 1.5–5.0% 
of cases per year,4 and the prevalence of HCC in our study 
population could increase in the future.
The main causes of HCC are HCV infection (70–75%) 
and hepatitis B virus infection (15%).18 The prevalence of 
HCC after the Fontan procedure was lower (0.18%) than 
that from HCV infection. If 40-year-old patients infected 
with HCV do not receive treatment for over 30 years, it is 
estimated that approximately 20–25% will have HCC.19 In 
the present study, the mortality of HCC after the Fontan 
procedure was high (40%). However, treatment for HCC 
after the Fontan procedure has not been established, and 
further studies are required.
The mechanisms of FALD are different from those of 
LC and HCC caused due to hepatitis virus infection or 
fatty liver. Low cardiac output in CHD decreases the hepatic 
blood supply, which induces a hepatic hypoxic state and

were examined for liver disease using imaging modalities. 
However, the findings of the present study indicate that the 
number of patients with LC and/or HCC after the Fontan 
procedure is not small.
Conclusions
LC and/or HCC in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure were not rare late complications. The mortality of 
liver diseases in these patients was only 0.19%, but if the 
patients had LC and/or HCC, the mortality increased to 
nearly 30%. Liver disease was a primary cause of death in 
17.6% of patients. Imaging modalities, especially CT, should 
be recommended owing to the difficulty in diagnosing LC 
and HCC using blood tests only. Further studies are 
required to establish accurate diagnostic methods for LC 
and/or HCC and to clarify the risk factors for liver disease 
and mortality in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.

30% after patients were diagnosed with LC and/or HCC. 
TCPC conversion for patients with LC could be an extreme 
risk for death because 2 such patients died during the perioperative period (11.8%) in the present study. Death due 
directly to liver disease occurred in 17.6% of the patients. 
Our results suggest that patients with LC and HCC after 
the Fontan procedure are at high risk of mortality. However, 
viral HCC and LC alone may not be associated with high 
mortality. We should pay attention to emerging HCC in 
patients with LC.
Study Limitations
First, although we show detailed characteristics of the 5 
patients with HCC in Table 4, the diagnosis of HCC in 
patients undergoing the Fontan procedure was difficult 
because these patients often show hyperenhancing nodules.3 A 7-year-old girl who underwent the Fontan procedure was diagnosed with hepatic adenomatosis based on 
MRI and MRI-guided liver biopsy,22 which suggests that 
the diagnosis of HCC is very difficult. Most patients with 
HCC did not undergo biopsy owing to the risk of bleeding, 
and it is a limitation of the present study that these patients 
may not have been accurately diagnosed with HCC. Second, 
the present study used questionnaire-based surveys, which 
could be inaccurate. The questionnaires used in the present 
study focused primarily on adult patients, but some pediatric patients were also included. Third, some patients who 
underwent the Fontan procedure were not followed-up 
because some pediatricians could not follow-up patients 
continuously after they were 16 or 18 years of age, so the 
prevalence of LC and/or HCC (1.15%) in the present study 
could be underestimated. In addition, not all patients
