[Purpose] The aim of the study was to determine the 
effects of dietary CoQ10 on serum biochemical parameters, lipid peroxidation, and HSP expression in the liver and slow-twitch muscles (soleus and gastronemius 
deep portion) of exercise-trained rats.
[Methods] A total of 42 Wistar albino rats were divided 
into six groups: 1) Control, 2) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), 
3) Chronic Exercise (CE), 4) CE + CoQ10, 5) Acute 
Exercise (AE), and 6) AE + CoQ10. The rats were subjected to the running test 5 days a week for 6 weeks 
after which CoQ10 was administered via the diet. AE 
(running on the treadmill until the rats were exhausted) 
was done on the last day.
[Results] The results showed no significant difference 
in serum glucose and liver functions in any of the groups. 
However, CoQ10 and exercise treatment were found 
to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Serum and 
muscle malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were found to be 
lower in the CE and CE + CoQ10 groups compared to 
the control group. The highest levels of HSP60, HSP70, 
and HSP90 in liver and muscle were found in the AE 
group, and the lowest levels were found in CE + CoQ10 
group. CoQ10 supplementation reduced HSP expression in both CE- and AE-trained rats (P < 0.05).
[Conclusion] The results showed that CoQ10 supplementation could reduce MDA levels, protect against 
oxidative damage, and regulate HSP expression in 
CE- and AE-trained rats. CE and CoQ10 were shown 
to reduce oxidative stress synergistically.

INTRODUCTION
The impairment of the antioxidant-mediated defense system during 
acute exercise (AE) training, which has been shown in muscles and 
the liver, results in the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
inflammation markers1. At the end of the maximal exercise, this condition of the muscle tissue causes free radicals to multiply, leading to 
lipid peroxidation of the membranes, and an increase in the abundance 
of macrophages and white blood cells2. Exercise can increase the use 
of oxygen by over 200 times and increases the relaxation levels of 
working muscle fibers3. During exercise-training, muscle mitochondria 
mediates an increase in superoxide production with the increase in oxygen flow3,4. Increased amounts of free radicals associated with excess 
oxygen consumption is counteracted by a defense system containing 
enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Excessive exercise is 
manifested as muscle fatigue and muscle damage known as oxidative 
stress due to imbalance between ROS and antioxidants5. In a previous 
study, it was shown that regular exercise provides many benefits, while 
excessive exercise increases oxidative damage by increasing the ROS 
formation6. Studies have been conducted on both marathon runners 
and experimental animals in order to eliminate or mitigate such negative effects caused by exercise. These studies were mostly based on the 
removal of oxidative stress and were conducted with reinforcing substances which are thought to have strong antioxidant properties.
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that help fold 
proteins into their original conformation, restore function, and contribute to the reduction of cellular damage7-9. They have many functions 
in maintaining intracellular integrity via protection, repair, and even 
regulation of cell death signaling10. It is well documented that the expression of HSPs, particularly HSP70, has been found to be increased 
in the mammalian skeletal muscle under stress conditions caused by 
exercise8,11,12. It has been reported that HSP70 expression is upregulated immediately after thermal stress in the soleus muscle13. The upregulation of HSPs may be responsible for cytoprotection via a mechanism

capable of reestablishing protein homeostasis against 
numerous stressors, including exercise14. Chronic exercise 
(CE) may improve the overall health; however, a single 
bout of inadequate exercise may lead to oxidative stress 
and muscle damage15,16. Taken together, these studies suggest that the expression of HSPs could be considered important for protection from and repair of skeletal muscle 
after exercise-induced stresses. 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), naturally found in mitochondria, is a potent antioxidant that is endogenously synthesized and is soluble in fat17. Due to its antioxidant properties, it is able to effectively inhibit the oxidation of fat, 
protein, and DNA in the body18. CoQ10 suppresses lipid 
peroxidation, and thus, oxidative stress by suppressing the 
activity of enzymes involved in ROS production19,20. One 
of the most important functions of CoQ10 is to serve as 
an electron carrier during oxidative phosphorylation by 
diffusing to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane 
via a unique chain structure in mitochondria21. In addition, it plays an important role in energy production from 
carbohydrates and fatty acids in cells22. Besides, CoQ10 
decreases serum cholesterol levels by suppressing cholesterol synthesis in the liver23.
Oxidative stress, which occurs during extreme exercise, 
lowers CoQ10 levels in mitochondria24. Thus, excessive 
free radicals are created that accumulate in the muscles, 
leading to fatigue and muscle damage in the body25. It 
has been reported that CoQ10 supplementation is highly 
effective in transporting and using oxygen required at the 
cellular level26 as well as in eliminating muscle damage 
and fatigue27. Therefore, the aim of the present study was 
to determine the effects of dietary CoQ10 on serum biochemical parameters, lipid peroxidation, and the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) 
in the liver and muscles of acutely and chronically exercised rats.
METHODS
Animals
This study was carried out by following the appropriate 
ethical rules for animal welfare and animal rights, after 
approval (No: 2014/01-07) from the Firat University Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments (Elazig, Turkey). 
A total of 42 male Wistar rats (8 weeks old, 180 ± 20 g 
weighted, 7 in each group) were housed in a controlled 
room with a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle at 22 ± 2 ° C and 
55 ± 5% relative humidity in specially prepared and daily 
cleaned cages, and supplied with rat chow and water ad 
libitum.
The rats were divided randomly into the following 6 
groups: (1) Control (C); rats received basal diet and were 
not exercised, (ii) CoQ10; rats received basal diet supplemented with CoQ10 and were not exercised, (iii) CE; rats 
received basal diet and were exercised (30 m/min, gradient 0 %, 30 min; exercise was performed for 5 days per 
week for 6 weeks), (iv) CE + CoQ10; rats received basal 
diet supplemented with CoQ10 and were subjected to CE 
(v) AE; rats received basal diet and were exercised (30 m/
min, gradient 0 %, 30 min for 5 days per week for 6 weeks 
and exhaustion exercise was also performed); and (vi) 
AE+ CoQ10; rats received diet supplemented with CoQ10 
and were subjected to AE. CoQ10 was administered daily 
for six weeks as an oral supplement by a gastric tube at 
a dosage of 300 mg/kg body weight. The selection of the 
dose (300 mg/kg b. wt.) was based on previous studies 
where this dosage elicited a significant antioxidant effect 
in rats28. After exercise training of rats in the AE groups, 
exhaustion exercise (making the rats run rats until they are 
exhausted and collecting serum and tissue samples immediately) was performed.
Exercise protocol 
The rats were subjected to a motor-driven rodent treadmill at a 0 % gradient (MAY-TME, Commat Limited, 
Ankara, Turkey). The treadmill was supplied with an 
electric shock grid on the rear barrier to provide exercise 
motivation to the rats. All exercise tests were done during 
the same time period of the day to diminish diurnal effects (11.30–13.30 hours). The rats in the CE groups were 
familiarized by treadmill exercise over a 5-d period such 
as: 1st day 10 m/min, 10 min; 2nd day 20 m/min, 10 min; 
3rd day 25 m/min, 10 min; 4th day 25 m/min, 20 min; 
and 5th day 30 m/min, 0 % grade, 30 min at high intensity29. Thereafter, animals were exercised at this level for 6 
weeks, 5 days/week. Exhaustion was defined as the inability of a rat to right itself when being laid on its side. All 
animals were fasted for 12 h before death.
Sample collection 
At the completion of the exercise program, rats were 
decapitated by cervical dislocation, and blood, slow-twitch 
muscles (soleus and gastronemius deep portion), and liver 
samples were taken. Blood samples were centrifuged at 
5000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge (Universal 320R, Hettich, Germany) with gliotic 
biochemical tubes (Standard plus & Medical Co., Ltd., 
Germany) to isolate serum. All the samples were stored at 
-80 °C (Hettich, Germany) for further analyses. 
Laboratory analysis
Levels of serum glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were analyzed with an autoanalyzer 
(Samsung LABGEO PT10, Samsung Electronics Co, Suwon, Korea). Repeatability and device/method precision 
of LABGEO PT10 was established according to the IVRPT06 guideline. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of 
serum, liver, and muscle were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu, Tokyo, 
Japan) using a Shimadzu UV–vis SPD-10 AVP detector 
and C18 ODS-3.5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm column30.

Analysis of gene expression
For total RNA extraction, 50 mg of tissue sample was 
homogenized using a Tissue Ruptor (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherland) homogenizer attached with a probe in 600 µL of 
1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol in RLT buffer. The samples 
were then centrifuged for 3 min. The supernatant was collected and mixed with one volume of 70 % ethanol. The 
total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of liver and muscle 
samples using the RNeasy total RNA isolation Mini Kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After isolation, amount and the quality 
of total RNA were determined using nanodrop spectrophotometry (Maestrogen, USA). Occurrence of any RNA 
degradation was checked with agarose gel electrophoresis. 
cDNA synthesis was carried out by using 500 ng of total 
RNA and oligo(dT)18 primer using a commercial First 
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI Fermentas, USA) as 
per the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression of 
desired proteins were determined with real time PCR by 
mixing 1 μl cDNA and 5 μl 2x SYBR Green Master-mix 
(Qiagen Fast Start Universal, SYBR Green Master Mix). 
Real time PCR analysis
Predeveloped TaqMan primers and probes set for 
HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 were designed at ABI 
based on gene sequence information obtained from 
GenBank (Qiagen Lot no: 20111214039, 20120813061, 
and 20110719024, respectively). The glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH), which has 
been widely used as a reference gene in rats31, was used 
as internal control (Qiagen Lot no: 20130917040). Then 
primer pairs (Table 1) were added at final concentrations 
of 0.5 mM to a final volume of 10 μl. The real time PCR 
program of the quantitative PCR (Light Cycler 480 II, 
Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) was arranged as follows: initial 
denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, denaturation at 95 
°C for 15 s, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 
72 °C for 15 s with 40 repeated thermal cycles measuring the green fluorescence at the end of each extension 
step. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicates and 
specificity of PCR products was verified by melt analysis. 
Also, negative controls lacking template were used in all 
reactions. The relative expression of genes with respect to 
GAPDH was calculated with efficiency corrected advance

differential gene expression was rated in pairs with a fold 
change cut off of 2 and significance value of P < 0.0531.
Statistical analysis
Data was assessed using ANOVA in SPSS software 
program (Version 22.0; Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons 
between groups were analyzed by the Tukey post hoc test. 
Data was expressed as group mean and standard error of 
the mean (SEM). P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
RESULTS
Serum biochemical parameters 
Serum glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, AST, and 
ALT concentrations are shown in Table 1. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in exercised or CoQ10 
supplemented rats were significantly different from 
the control group rats (P < 0.0001, for both); however, 
differences in the serum glucose, AST, and ALT levels 
were not significant (P > 0.05). The serum cholesterol 
and triglyceride concentrations were decreased in the 
CE + CoQ10 group (P < 0.0001, for both; Table 1).
Serum and tissue MDA levels
As shown in Table 2, in general, serum, liver, and 
muscle MDA levels were found to be decreased by CE 
and CoQ10 supplementation in rats (P < 0.05). However, an increase in MDA level was detected with AE (P < 
0.001). The lowest serum, liver, and muscle MDA levels 
were found in the CE + CoQ10 group, while the highest 
serum, liver, and muscle MDA levels were found in the 
AE group (P < 0.001, respectively; Table 2). 
Expression of heat shock proteins
Expression of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 genes in 
liver and muscles of rats in AE group were higher than 
those in the other groups (Fig 1A, B, C and 2A, B, C; P
< 0.001). CoQ10 administration significantly decreased 
the expression of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 genes 
in liver and muscle (P < 0.05). The decrease in the expression of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 in the liver and 
muscle of the rats in the CE + CoQ10 group was more 
prominent than in the other groups (P < 0.05; Fig 1 and 
2).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on serum biochemical parameters, liver functions, 
lipid peroxidation, and expression of HSP60, HSP70, 
and HSP90 in the liver and muscle tissues of acutely and 
chronically exercised rats have been revealed. CoQ10 
and AE/CE training were found to lower cholesterol and 
triglyceride levels (Table 1). These results show that 
during exercise training CoQ10 does not instantly mediate carbohydrate or lipid metabolism in the organism. 
CoQ10 is known as a redox molecule with intracellular 
antioxidant efficacy that is biochemically present in biological tissues both in reduced and oxidized form interacting with oxygen-derived radicals and singlet oxygen, 
thereby preventing the initiation of lipid peroxidation 
and damaging biomolecules32,33. Also, CoQ10 is an ongoing antioxidant which plays a vital role in the regeneration of other antioxidants when exposed to plasma 
oxidants, although it is present in low concentrations 
compared to other antioxidants (e.g. α-tocopherol)34,35. 
Furthermore, CoQ10 has been reported to have roles in 
membrane fixation, cell signaling, gene expression, cell 
growth, and supervision of apoptosis36. Similar to our 
research, Pala et al. found that CoQ10 supplementation 
in exercised rats led to a decrease in cholesterol and triglyceride levels37. Kim et al.38 have previously reported 
that there was a significant difference in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and Yoon and Park39 have 
reported that there was a significant difference in serum 
triglyceride levels in exercised rats supplemented with 
antioxidant agents such as soy isoflavones, L-carnitine, 
and vitamin E. However, Díaz-Castro et al. found that 
there was no significant difference in cholesterol levels, 
but triglyceride levels were decreased in CoQ10 supplemented amateur male runners40. It has been also been 
shown that during exercise, CoQ10 tend to improve 
skeletal muscle activity and triglyceride capacity that 
could be responsible for its ergogenic effects41.
Increased lipid peroxidation and tissue damage in 
overt exercises are associated with increased oxidative 
stress42,43. MDA, the product of lipid peroxidation, 
is a dialdehyde that is the result of peroxidation of

unsaturated fatty acids and is indicative of oxidative 
damage44,45. In the present study, the control group 
exhibited decreased levels of serum, liver, and muscle 
MDA after CoQ10 supplementation and CE (Table 2). 
Díaz-Castro et al. stated that CoQ10 supplementation 
in amateur male runners reduced oxidative stress and 
inhibited muscle damage40. In another study, Pala et al. 
reported that CoQ10, which acts as an antioxidant, suppresses oxidative stress in rats who have been practicing 
running exercises and consuming CoQ1037. Gul et al. 
also reported that CoQ10 supplementation inhibited 
oxidative stress in 15 healthy and sedentary males who 
were subjected to Wingate tests46. Kon et al. examined 
the effects of CoQ10 supplementation in rats subjected 
to exercise and found that CoQ10 is useful in reducing 
physical exercise-induced muscle damage28. Ostman et 
al. have reported that CoQ10 may be effective on the 
alleviation of oxidative stress in moderately trained 
healthy men47. In addition, Pala determined that end-ofmatch MDA levels of elite boxers were significantly decreased48, and Pala et al. found that MDA levels caused 
due to oxidative stress decreased post-match in the 
coaches of Turkish boxing team49. 
In the present study, AE induced significant increases 
in the expression of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 in the 
liver and muscles. However, CE induced a decrease 
in the HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 expression in the 
liver and muscles of rats (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). We also 
demonstrated that CoQ10 supplementation decreased 
HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 expression in the liver and 
muscle of acutely and chronically exercised rats. It was 
seen that the greatest reduction in expression of HSPs 
was in the chronic exercised and CoQ10-supplemented 
group. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies related to investigative the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on the expression of HSPs in rats acutely 
and chronically exercised rats have been conducted. 
However, there have been studies on the effects of exercise on expression of HSPs50-53. HSPs are known to act 
as cell defense mechanism, and they play an important 
role in the synthesis and repair of proteins50. HSPs are 
expressed especially in oxidative stress conditions (e.g. 
exhaustive physical exercise)51, and mitochondria are 
effectively protected by members of the HSP family including HSP60, HSP70, and HSP9052,53. Previously, the 
expression of the stress proteins were found to increase 
in rats subjected to running training52,53. Moreover, 
exercise-induced HSP responses are dependent on exercise intensity and duration, reflecting a physiological 
response to heat shock and oxidative stress54. Similar to 
our findings, it was reported that AE increased HSP60 
mRNA, HSP90 mRNA and protein levels, and AE-induced oxidative stress (indicated by increased levels of 
HO-1 mRNA and protein), and HNE protein adducts55. 
In addition, Starnes et al.56 indicated that after three 
months of exercise for 5 days/week, HSP70 expression 
was not increased in the liver of aged rats, although it 
was significantly elevated in young rats56. In a previous 
study, it was shown that administration of CoQ10 decreased the levels of colon tissue MDA, HSP70, tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 
in an ulcerative colitis model of rats57. There are also 
studies on the effects of antioxidants like Q10 on HSPs. 
For example, Oksala et al. reported that antioxidant 
supplementation effectively suppressed the heat shock 
protein expression in the liver of exercised rats58. Wu et 
al. reported that lipoic acid significantly decreased the 
levels of HSP70 expression in different muscle types in 
heat-shock induced rats59. 
A decrease in lipid peroxidation and heat shock proteins in rats in the present study could have been due 
to positive effects of CoQ10 and/or CE, alleviating the 
negative effects of AE. In the present study, CE and 
dietary CoQ10 inclusions resulted in a synergic effect. 
More specifically, the combination of CoQ10 and CE 
provided the lowest levels of lipid peroxidation and 
HSP expression. It is apparent that a combination of dietary CoQ10 and CE offers a feasible way to reduce the 
increase in lipid peroxidation and HSP expression29,37. 
CoQ plays a role in inhibiting lipid peroxidation by 
either scavenging ROS directly or in conjunction with 
α-tocopherol60. Shimomura et al.61 have reported that 
intravenous CoQ10 supplementation suppressed the 
upregulated muscle damage markers (creatine kinase: 
CK, and lactate dehydrogenase: LDH) in rats following 
downhill running. The CoQ10 deficiency in skeletal 
muscle led to a spectrum of clinical manifestations and 
was it is suggested that this also leads to a secondary 
impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation62. In a 
previous study, it has been reported that CoQ10 supplementation increases CoQ concentration in muscle cell 
membranes and reduces AE-induced muscular injury by 
enhancing cell membrane stabilization63.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, these results showed that CoQ10 supplementation did not affect serum glucose levels and 
liver function, but reduced cholesterol and triglyceride 
concentrations in acutely and chronically exercised rats. 
In addition, CoQ10 showed protective effects against 
oxidative stress caused by AE by lowering MDA levels 
in acutely exercised rats. However, while AE increases 
oxidative stress, CE decreases oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxidation. This effect has also been demonstrated by the regulation of the expression of heat-shock 
proteins in the liver and muscle tissues of CoQ10-fed 
rats. Meanwhile, CE and CoQ10 have been shown to 
reduce oxidative stress synergistically.
