Abstract
The King’s prognostic criteria for patients with acute liver failure (ALF) introduced in 1989 have been used worldwide.
This distinguished for the first time cases with ‘hyper-acute’ course (characteristically paracetamol overdose) where there
is a better chance of recovery with medical supportive care alone from those etiologies with a less acute course and
paradoxically lower chances of ‘spontaneous’ recovery. Ongoing use showed the limited sensitivity of the criteria to
constitute a significant practical limitation. Subsequent models including the MELD score and composite ones with
markers of necrosis, an apoptotic liver cell death, proposed to improve sensitivity did not have the required high specificity.
Two recent models utilizing new availability of web- and app-based computing delivering outcome predication through
sophisticated algorithms are described. The first is a dynamic model described for paracetamol-induced ALF based upon
admission findings and sequential variables over the first 2 days. The new model of the US Acute Liver Failure group was
devised to cover all etiologies of ALF for predicting ‘transplant-free’ survival and accurately predicated spontaneous
survival in two-thirds of cases. Improved survival results with medical management, particularly in hyper-acute cases, now
approach those obtained with successful liver transplant and have raised the question of transplant benefit. Also considered
in the review are new non-transplant approaches to treatment including the use of plasma exchange and based on successful
results in acute-on-chronic liver failure, agents to modulate and improve hepatic regeneration.

Introduction and historical context
Difficulties in determining prognosis in patients with acute
liver failure (ALF) from paracetamol hepatotoxicity have
been apparent for many years. Initial issues related to the
difficulties in identifying those patients with paracetamol
intoxication who would benefit from antidotal therapy [1].
The need for accurate predictive tests of patient outcome
became even more apparent when the life-saving procedure
of liver transplant for patients with ALF was introduced in
the early 1980. Concerns were raised that some patients
would be transplanted who would otherwise have recovered with medical management alone; variously termed
‘transplant-free’ or ‘spontaneous’ survival.
The description of the King’s College Criteria (KCC) in
1989 represented a major step forward in identifying candidates for liver transplantation (Text Box 1) [2]. It stressed the importance of etiology and mode of presentation in
the outcome of ALF, recognizing the chances of recovery
with medical supportive care alone with rapidly evolving
paracetamol hepatotoxicity as being much higher than with
other etiologies of ALF, particularly those with illness of
more gradual onset. Derived and validated in a cohort of
763 patients managed before the introduction of transplantation for ALF, the high specificity of the KCC meant
that relatively few cases fulfilling criteria would be
unnecessarily transplanted. However, their sensitivity was
lower, indicating that a significant number of cases not
fulfilling criteria would progress and die without earlier
identification and consideration for possible liver transplantation. For the non-paracetamol cases, both sensitivity
and specificity were high but within this overall group,

certain etiologies with rapid illness onset—specifically
ischemic hepatitis, acute fatty liver of pregnancy and
hepatitis A—had similar survival rates with medical management alone to that of paracetamol-induced cases. It was
in those cases with an indolent presentation and ‘sub-acute’
phenotype and often ‘indeterminate’ etiology that had the
worst outcome without transplantation [3].

Decision making in relation to the use of transplantation
in ALF became even more difficult as improvements in
intensive liver care led to higher survival rates with medical management alone. In the King’s College Hospital
(KCH) experience of over 3000 patients treated between
1973 and 2008, transplant-free survival had increased to
48%, with a near fourfold increase in overall hospital
survival rates—including cases transplanted from 16.7 to
62.2% [4].The increase in ‘transplant-free’ survival was
most apparent in paracetamol cases and associated with a
substantial fall in the occurrence of cerebral edema and
intracranial hypertension, which in the past was often the
cause of death in cases with a ‘hyper-acute’ presentation.
An important contribution to this improvement is likely
through control of circulating levels of ammonia—the
principal neurotoxin in this setting—through interventions
that include the earlier and more widespread use of continuous hemofiltration [5, 6]. In paracetamol-induced ALF,
the narrowing in the gap between survival with medical
management alone and survival with transplantation has
raised doubts about the transplant benefit in such cases [7].
These changes in the spectrum of complications and
improvement in survival have since been documented in
other large historical series [8–10].
In this review, we will consider: first, the basis of
prognostic assessment systems in ALF and the practical
difficulties in their application, with focus upon the KCC as
an example of a system in current use. Second, the
improved results currently being obtained with liver
transplantation in these very sick patients are described and
third, how new approaches to treatment may impact upon
future care and outcome.
Improving prediction of outcome
A number of different systems are in current use for the
evaluation of prognosis in patients with ALF, with clinical
experience of their application and operational performance reported for the KCC and criteria from France and
Japan [2, 10–12]. Though details of the models used vary,
they share common features (Table 1). All recognize the
key importance of the development of encephalopathy as a
marker of critically impaired liver function and retain it as
a central criterion of poor prognosis. All also utilize laboratory measures of liver function to quantify severity of
liver injury, most common measures of coagulation status.
Patient Age is also recognized by all as being of prognostic
importance—likely reflecting the compromise of physiologic reserve with increasing age—key to surviving any
critical illness, and a possible parallel impairment of hepatic regenerative ability. An important difference of the
KCC from the other established criteria is the distinction
between paracetamol and non-paracetamol etiologies,
reflecting the high volume of paracetamol cases seen in the
United Kingdom and differences seen in clinical course.
Their clinical simplicity has, however, served them well
over time, relying not on complex calculation or use of
specialized laboratory tests but rather standard bedside

assessment and readily available routine laboratory
measures.
Published data illustrate their limitations in current
clinical practice, particularly in relation to hyper-acute
disease. Here the initial intensity of critical illness may be
severe but paradoxically the potential for native liver
regeneration is high [4, 9, 11]. In early case series of hyperacute patients, the dominant clinical issues were those of
either a failure to identify all patients with a poor prognosis
for consideration of transplantation—limited sensitivity—
in concert with that of rapid deterioration of those who
fulfilled KCC and high risk of death on the transplant
waitlist prior to grafts becoming available, late identification [13–15]. Efforts were, therefore, initially focussed on
refining the KCC by improving criteria sensitivity enabling
earlier identification of patients with a poor prognosis
through integration of supplemental prognostic markers.
Initial studies explored the inclusion of arterial blood
lactate measurements determined using point of care testing, as hyperlactatemia reflects both decreased hepatic
clearance by a damaged liver and global illness severity
and multi-organ failure. Initial reports confirmed their
prognostic value, and their inclusion was found to improve
specificity, sensitivity and timeliness of the KCC [16].
Other studies have also examined arterial blood lactate in
ALF, finding elevated levels to be strongly and independently associated with death or transplantation in both
paracetamol and non-paracetamol-induced disease
[17–19]. Analysis of the performance of the specific
thresholds for arterial lactate introduced into the KCC for
paracetamol-induced disease has been less consistent, with
one report suggesting that early levels resulted in an
increase in sensitivity but at the expense of reduction in
specificity [17]. However, two other studies found that
lactate measurements alone 12 h after admission to transplant centers had high predictive accuracy, with performance greater than the KCC alone [18, 19]. Though
adopted into United Kingdom ALF wait-listing criteria,
meta-analysis of validation studies to date has failed to
confirm an improvement in diagnostic test performance
through their inclusion [20].
Two further meta-analyses of the performance of the
KCC have further illustrated their potential shortcomings
(Fig. 1). Review of studies of the KCC in predicting outcome of non-paracetamol-induced ALF comprising 1105
cases, showed overall sensitivity of 68% and specificity
82% [21]. Specificity was highest (93%) in patients with
high-grade HE and where the criteria were sequentially
determined through the clinical course of illness. Importantly, this analysis also described a fall-off in diagnostic
performance in more recent studies, reflecting the increased
success of non-transplant approaches to care. A second,
larger meta-analysis examining criteria performance in
both paracetamol and non-paracetamol etiologies suggested an overall sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 79%,
and with better performance values for prediction of nonsurvival in paracetamol than in non-paracetamol etiologies
[22].
Indications are, therefore, of particular aspects where
diagnostic performance of selection criteria could be
improved beyond existing systems. First, they should
consider etiology of illness and reflect the differential in
current outcomes of medical care alone. Second, they
would perform sequential rather than single time point
estimations of prognosis, a process identified on metaanalysis as having additional diagnostic value and reflecting the rapidly changing clinical condition seen particularly
in paracetamol and other hyper-acute etiologies and
already utilized in other novel prognostic criteria [23].
Recent studies suggest that in these cases waitlist
improvement rather than deterioration may now principally
confound decision making [9, 11, 12, 15]. Additionally,
any new or supplemental criteria should ideally retain the
clinical simplicity of existing systems. Two recent attempts
to address these issues are discussed below, both of which
have utilized the recent availability of web- and app-based
computing power to deliver outcome predictions through
sophisticated algorithms.
Dynamic outcome predictive model
for paracetamol-induced ALF
Prediction models in hyper-acute disease would be of most
benefit if they could be applied sequentially identifying and
quantifying both improvement and deterioration [22, 23].
The latest model from the King’s Liver Intensive Care Unit
is a dynamic outcome prediction model developed and
validated for use in patients with paracetamol-induced ALF
[24]. It is based on prospective data including analysis of
more than 20 daily variables sequentially assessed for
3 days after ICU admission in 912 un-transplanted patients
between 2000 and 2012. The variables included in the final
models to predict death-included age, hepatic
encephalopathy, cardiovascular failure, INR, creatinine and
arterial pH on admission and dynamic variables of
changing arterial blood lactate and INR. On validation in
independent datasets from four transplant centers, the
models showed good discrimination between survivors and
non-survivors, improving with the inclusion of changes in
INR and Lactate over time (Fig. 2). Innovative in this
approach was its access though a dedicated website and the
generation of continuous survival estimates rather than a
binary survival outcome, with the intention that the model
should act as a decision-support tool to support clinical

judgement rather than a sole arbiter as to proceeding with
transplantation.
Model of acute liver failure study group
(ALFSG)
Elements of this approach were also adopted in the recent
analysis by the ALFSG of 1974 subjects enrolled
prospectively from 28 academic centers across North
America between 1998 and 2013, and managed with and
without transplantation [25]. The aim was to devise a
mathematical model for all etiologies of ALF to predict
transplant-free survival at 21 days, rather than mortality as
adopted in other models—making comparison with other
studies adopting more standard approaches more complex.
Clinical features and laboratory values were collected at
study enrolment and recorded serially up to 7 days. Variables of prognostic value adopted in the predictive model
included admission coma grade, etiology and vasopressor
requirement, and admission bilirubin and INR values.
Arterial blood lactate was not explored. In this analyses of
both paracetamol and non-paracetamol cases, sequential
values of the INR did not add to prediction over that on
admission. Using AUROC analysis, test discrimination
appeared superior to the KCC and MELD scores (Fig. 3)
with the model correctly predicting outcome of illness in
66.3% of subjects. Its performance was best in patients
with unfavorable etiologies and high-grade encephalopathy
and more limited in those with more favorable etiologies
and high-grade encephalopathy.

Though sharing similarities in their use of web-based
predictive algorithms, key differences exist between these
two predictive systems. One is based on the prediction of
mortality and the other survival, with resultant differences
in test performance. Further, they are targeted at different
patient groups—with the USALF criteria taking a broad
approach to all etiologies of ALF, whilst the Dynamic
Model is focused upon liver injury from paracetamol where
the USALF performs least well. It may be that application
of these and other models are complimentary and decision
making is based upon the results generated from several
prognostic systems [23–25].
Other systems evaluated
A variety of other scoring systems and supplemental
markers have been proposed to identify candidates for liver
transplantation, though in general their performance has
been evaluated in patient cohorts of limited size (Table2).
Scores used in this way include non-liver specific ones
such as SOFA and APACHE II that are widely used to
quantify severity of multi-organ failure in other forms of
critical illness [17, 26, 27]. Reports suggest similar sensitivity and specificity to the King’s criteria in predicting
death and they can be applied sequentially. However,
though they may identify those patients at risk of death, the
multi-organ failure they quantify may not be corrected by
transplantation, if for example, it results for other ALFassociated complications such as severe sepsis or pancreatitis. Consequently, they are not in widespread use to
select candidates for transplant.
The MELD score is more focused on severity of liver
injury and has been assessed more widely in ALF and
subjected to meta-analysis [22, 28, 29]. In its unmodified
form, it shows most promise in non-paracetamol etiologies,
with diagnostic performance close to that of the KCC [22].
It has also been combined with circulating blood levels of
cytokeratin K18 (CK18) a cell death-associated marker
measured using the M30 assay which principally reflects
apoptotic cell death [30]. Also, this measurement in place
of bilirubin to give a modified MELD Score showed
superior sensitivity and specificity to the standard MELD
Score and the King’s criteria in predicting outcome of ALF [31].
Other studies have also reported prognostic models
combining standard clinical variables with non-standard
analytes. By example, the ALFSG index predictive model
combined Coma-grade, INR, bilirubin and phosphorus
levels with that of blood levels of M30 CK18 [32]. In a
250-strong validation cohort, discrimination between survivors and non-survivors was greater than with the KCC or
MELD, though later external validation in a smaller

independent cohort showed no advantage over SOFA or
APACHE scoring [32, 33].
However, the primary mechanism of liver cell injury
may vary by etiology and necrosis rather than apoptosis
may predominate. Antoine and colleagues assessed circulating levels of a panel of cell death markers in 78 patients
with paracetamol-induced ALF [34]. They found that best
prediction of non-survival was with acetylated HMGBI—a
biomarker of hepatic necrosis and cellular immunological
activation, and to lesser degree with biomarkers of apoptosis including molecular forms of CK18. To date, validation studies have not indicated prognostic advantage
above the standard KCC in predicting survival [35]. Cell
death biomarkers do appear to be exquisitely sensitive in
predicting clinically significant liver injury very early after
paracetamol overdose but If they are to be adopted as
adjunctive measures to select liver transplant candidates
with ALF, key practical issues will need to be overcome
[36, 37]. Techniques for their rapid determination will need
to be widely available, and it is likely that a panel of
biomarkers will need to be assessed to cover etiologyspecific differences in the mechanisms of liver cell injury
and death.
Other simpler clinical measures have also demonstrated
potential for use as prognostic markers: platelet count has
been shown to be closely linked to outcome. In a recent
study from the USALFSG, the evolution of thrombocytopenia was closely associated with development of multiorgan failure and a poor outcome in ALF and linked to the
development of a systemic inflammatory response [38]
(Fig. 4a). Liver volume may be easily determined using
analysis of CT images and reflect the balance between the
parallel processes of liver collapse with cell death and
increase with regeneration. Recent studies suggest that in
some non-paracetamol etiologies, loss of liver volume in
adults to less than 1000 cm3 may indicate irreversible
damage and serve as an early indicator of poor prognosis,
often in advance of the development of encephalopathy
(Fig. 4b) [39–41].
Other studies have also sought to identify at a very early
stage those patients with acute liver injury (ALI) in the
absence of encephalopathy which will later progress to a
poor outcome of death or transplantation. In a study of US
patients hospitalized with ALI, progression to a poor outcome was more common in non-paracetamol etiologies and
with higher levels of INR and bilirubin, and a prolonged
duration of illness [42].
Finally, it is important to emphasize that prognostic
models should be only part of the overall functional evaluation of the very sick patient with ALF and an experienced multi-disciplinary team in an intensive care setting is
required for correct interpretation. Rather than providing an
absolute arbiter, these models should support decision
making and the multifactorial team assessment.
Current results of liver transplantation
Life-saving though it was soon seen to be after its introduction, overall results not surprisingly for these very sick
patients were significantly lower than for elective transplants carried out for those with chronic diseases. Several
series have now demonstrated a progressive incremental
improvement in survival over time, with patient survival
now approaching that of elective surgery. Recent reports
for the US and UK are of 1-year patient survival rates of
85–90% [43]. These results reflect advances in peri- and
intra-operative care and the interplay of several factors: the
earlier and more accurate prediction of need for transplant

and identification those patients who are too sick for surgery, and a better understanding of the interplay between
graft and recipient factors in determining patient survival.
Analysis of the European experience of 4903 transplant
recipients between 1998 and 2009 found death after surgery to relate to both with independent association shown
with male recipients (adjusted OR 1.25), recipient
[50 years of age (1.26), incompatible ABO matching
(1.93), donors [60 years (1.21), and reduced size graft
(1.54). Recipients [ 50 years, combined with donors
[60 years had a 57% mortality/graft loss within the first
year after transplant [44]. Matching of graft to recipient is
key to ensuring optimal outcome [13]. Case series also now
confirms the practicality and excellent outcomes obtained
for selected patients transplanted using living donors, and
from auxiliary liver grafting in etiologies where native liver
regenerative potential exists—though globally, these techniques are applied to only a small proportion of recipients
[45, 46].
Patient survival after transplantation for ALF follows a
characteristic pattern of increased mortality early after
transplant, but in patients who survive this phase, subsequent survival parallels closely with that seen in elective
transplantation [44]. In an early series, the high prevalence
of psychiatric comorbidity and addiction issues seen in
recipients of transplantation for paracetamol-induced ALF
was reflected in an increased risk of death due to suicide,
trauma or non-adherence to immunosuppression with over
half the deaths occurring within 12 months of transplantation [44]. Later series have not demonstrated such an
increase in mortality, but it is clear that paracetamol
recipients show increased levels of psychotic comorbidity
which may be reflected in poor compliance with medication and follow-up [47]. In these patients, assessment of
severity of psychiatric illness is a key element of the
selection of potential recipients and in those transplanted
follow-up must include close ongoing psychiatric monitoring and support.
New novel non-transplant options
A number of novel non-transplant interventions have
potential to serve as alternatives to transplantation. A
central premise to their use is that the injured liver retains
regenerative ability and that this may be augmented by
these interventions. A better practical understanding of the
processes influencing both liver injury and regeneration is
likely to be of clinical importance here, exemplified by the
major clinical and laboratory differences between paracetamol hepatotoxity from single time point or staggered
overdoses—and the markedly worse outcomes seen in the
latter group [48]. The potentially important influence of
pre-existing sub-clinical non-cirrhotic liver disease upon
liver regeneration is currently poorly characterized, for
example, from chronic alcohol use or non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis.
In cases where the liver injury has progressed ‘beyond
the point of no return’, novel medical therapies are unlikely
to be of benefit. It would thus be of no surprise that most
efficacy would be seen either in treatment at an early stage
of disease and/or in etiologies with greatest regenerative
capacity. By example, the FULMAR trial of the MARS
extra-corporeal device in patients with ALF failed to show
a survival improvement in the overall study cohort but
there were indications of potential benefit in patients with
paracetamol-related disease [49].
Such caveats may also apply to the use of therapeutic
plasma exchange (TPE). Through mechanisms thought to
include removal of deleterious inhibitors of hepatic
regeneration and a complex pattern of immunomodulation,
use of this therapy has recently been demonstrated to
deliver a survival benefit in non-transplanted patients with
ALF. In a multi-center randomized controlled trial on
mixed etiologies of disease, three 5-l TPE sessions significantly improved survival above that seen with standard
medical care, although the survival benefit was inferior to
that seen with transplantation (Fig. 5) [50]. There is
ongoing debate about the place of this therapy in patients
with ALF, given that its use normalizes measures of
coagulation disturbance and thus precludes their use in
prognostic evaluation for later transplantation. Our practice
is in accordance with recent EASL guidance, with its early
use in patients with ALF with an expected poor prognosis
without transplantation but who have clear medical or
psychiatric contra-indications to surgery [51]. In addition,
the use of TPE is associated with significant improvements
in cardiovascular status and we also treat patients who are
waitlisted for liver transplantation but with worsening

cardiovascular failure and vasopressor requirement while
awaiting a graft [50].
Other forms of cellular and immune-modulatory therapy
show promise as future treatments for ALF. Whilst hepatocyte transplantation retains considerable theoretical attractions, it presents considerable logistic challenges and a
requirement for immunosuppression, and its benefit is yet to
be established in adult patients with ALF [52, 53]. Other
interventions in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure
(ACLF) show promise but are yet to be tested in ALF.
Understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of ACLF is
rapidly increasing and the insights gained, particularly in
relation to modulation of regeneration and immunological
function, may well be transportable to ALF. In a randomized
controlled single-blind trial in 110 patients with Hepatitis
B-related ACLF of whom less than half were thought to be
cirrhotic, treatment with allogenic mesenchymal stem cells
improved survival—[54]. Similarly, in a single-center double-blind trial in 55 patients with decompensated cirrhosis,
treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor and
erythropoietin was associated with improved survival in
association with indications of improved hepatic regeneration through mobilization of progenitor cells [55]. These
results are yet to be replicated or tested in patients with ALF
but demonstrate mechanistic approaches likely to be assessed in the near future. As ever, the rarity and severity of ALF
represent major limiting factors for performing randomized
controlled trials of these or other agents and true advances in
therapeutic intervention are likely to result only from international collaborative studies.
