1. Introduction
Hepatolithiasis is endemic to East Asia, which includes 
China, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and its prevalence 
there can range as high as 30-50% (1). This disease 
involves gallstones in the bile ducts proximal to 
the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts, 
irrespective of the co-existence of gallstones in the 
common bile duct (CBD) and/or gallbladder (2). In the 
past, this disease was rare, with a prevalence of 0.6-1.3% 
(3) in the West, but it is increasingly encountered in the 
West because of greater immigration from Asia (4-7). 
The etiology of hepatolithiasis has yet to be fully 
elucidated, although genetic, dietary, and environmental 
factors are thought to contribute to the disease. 
Hence, curative management of hepatolithiasis is 
difficult since treatment depends greatly on fully 
understanding the mechanism of stone formation. 
The goal of hepatolithiasis treatment is to resolve 
ongoing infections, prevent recurrent cholangitis and 
subsequent hepatic fibrosis, decrease the need for 
recurrent instrumentation, and prevent progression 
to cholangiocarcinoma (2). Available treatments 
include medication and surgery. Surgery, including 
removal of the affected liver segment(s), has been 
the best treatment thus far. Hepatectomy can remove 
stones and focal lesions to eliminate the risk of 
cholangiocarcinoma, strictures, and subsequent bile 
stasis to provide effective drainage of biliary tract. 
Complete removal of the diseased lobe or segment 
is crucial to preventing recurrence and progressive 
liver disease. The current report describes a system of 
classifying hepatolithiasis for surgery and firsthand 
experience managing the disease.
2. Classification of hepatolithiasis for surgery
Classifying surgical candidates or indications 
for surgery is crucial for a hepatectomy to treat 
hepatolithiasis to result in the best outcome. Normally, 
the indications for hepatectomy to treat hepatolithiasis 
are as follows: i) unilobar hepatolithiasis, particularly 
left-sided; ii) atrophy, fibrosis, and multiple abscesses 
secondary to cholangitis; iii) suspicion of concomitant 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; and iv) multiple 
intrahepatic stones with biliary strictures that cannot 
be treated percutaneously or endoscopically (8). 
Review
Summary Hepatolithiasis is endemic to East Asia, but immigration from the region means that 
this rare but emerging disease will pose a therapeutic challenge to doctors in the West as 
well. Curative management of hepatolithiasis is difficult since its etiology has not been 
fully elucidated. Hepatectomy is the best approach to treating hepatolithiasis. Here, we 
propose a novel classification of hepatolithiasis and describe features of each type. We 
then relate our experience with various forms of hepatectomy to treat different types of 
hepatolithiasis. Surgery should be indicated for all cases of hepatolithiasis. The proposed 
classification will help to determine surgical strategies. Better selection of which patients 
should undergo a hepatectomy will lead to better outcomes.

The criteria for classification should be based on the 
pathological characteristics of the biliary tree and 
hepatic parenchyma. Classification should help to 
determine treatment strategies and it should be simple 
and easy to apply. However, there has been no universal 
classification of hepatolithiasis until now.
Based on previous experience managing 
hepatolithiasis, the current authors propose a system 
of classification, designated "Dong's Classification" 
to determine reasonable surgical approaches to 
treating hepatolithiasis (Table 1). In this classification, 
hepatolithiasis is divided into two types, type I and 
type II. Type I is a localized stone disease with 
stones located in one (Figure 1A, Type Ia) or both 
lobes (Figure 1B, Type Ib). Type II is a diffuse stone 
disease, which is divided into three subtypes: type 
IIa involves no atrophy of the hepatic parenchyma or 
stricture of the intrahepatic bile ducts (Figure 2A); 
type IIb involves segmental atrophy or/and stricture 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts (Figure 2B); and type 
IIc involves biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension 
(Figure 2C). 
The letter "E" represents an additional type of 
hepatolithiasis with extrahepatic stones. This type is 
divided into three subtypes: "Ea" representing normal 
functioning of the sphincter of Oddi; "Eb" representing 
relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, and "Ec" 
representing stricture of the sphincter of Oddi (Figure 3).
3. Hepatectomy to treat hepatolithiasis
Data were collected on patients at the Institute of 
Hepatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, and Chinese 
PLA General Hospital, both of which are leading 
facilities for biliary surgery in China. Hepatectomy to 
treat hepatolithiasis was initiated at Southwest Hospital 
by Prof. Zhiqiang Huang in 1957 and was reported by 
him in a Chinese medical journal in 1959 (9). 
Hepatectomy is the best approach to treating 
hepatolithiasis because it removes stones and also 
because it removes the strictured bile duct, resects the 
atrophic portion of the liver, and eliminates the potential 
presence of cholangiocarcinoma, thus reducing the risk 
of recurrent stones.

abscess or cholangiocarcinoma). Patients with type 
IIc hepatolithiasis consistently have biliary cirrhosis, 
portal hypertension, and liver failure as well, indicating 
the need for a liver transplant. Additionally, a 
hepaticojejunostomy should also be performed to treat 
"Eb" and "Ec" hepatolithiasis.
3.2. Outcomes of hepatolithiasis treated by surgery
From June 1976 to June 2009, 1,930 patients underwent 
surgery for hepatolithiasis at the Institute of Hepatobiliary 
Surgery. Of these, 1,175 patients underwent hepatectomy 
and 755 patients primarily underwent liver-preserving 
surgery and stone removal.
Perioperative outcomes showed that patients who 
underwent a hepatectomy had much greater intraoperative bleeding than patients who had stones 
removed. Hepatectomy was associated with a longer 
operating time than stone removal. There were no 
significant differences between the patients in terms of 
mortality and morbidity. However, the postoperative rate 
of residual stones was much lower after hepatectomy 
than after stone removal (Table 2).
The operative morbidity rate was 13.3% for 1,175 
patients who underwent a hepatectomy. The most 
common complication was wound infection, followed by 
biliary leakage, pleural effusion, pneumonia, stress ulcer, 
intraabdominal bleeding, and hepatic failure (Table 3).
3.3. Typical cases where a hepatectomy was used to treat 
hepatolithiasis
3.1. Indications for hepatectomy to treat hepatolithiasis
Based on experience, patients with type I and type IIb 
hepatolithiasis are the best candidates for hepatectomy. 
In type I localized stone disease, surgery resects the 
stone-bearing segments, regardless of where atrophy 
or a stricture is found (Figure 4). Type II involves a 
high risk of stone recurrence, so all patients with type 
II should undergo stone removal along with a Rouxen-Y hepaticojejunostomy (10,11) or hepaticocutaneous 
jejunostomy (12-15). Hepatectomy is the best way to 
resect lesions in patients with type IIb hepatolithiasis 
and hepatic lesions (e.g. segmental atrophy hepatic

Diffuse stone disease with segmental atrophy and/or stricture. In this case, stones were located in every liver segment and there 
was atrophy or biliary stricture of S2, S3, S6, and S7; (C), Type IIc. Diffuse stone disease with secondary biliary cirrhosis. In 
this case, stones were located in every liver segment and there was biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. A liver transplant is 
needed. 
Figure 3. Additional type E hepatolithiasis. Hepatolithiasis 
with extrahepatic stones. Hepatolithiasis with extrahepatic 
stones (E) is divided into three subtypes based on functioning 
of the sphincter of Oddi. Normal function of the sphincter of 
Oddi is designated "Ea", relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi 
is designated "Eb", and stricture of the sphincter of Oddi is 
designated "Ec".

3.3.1. Anatomic left lobectomy, segmentectomy, and 
sectionectomy for type I hepatolithiasis
In a case of stones localized in the atrophic left lobe and 
extrahepatic bile duct, the hepatolithiasis was classified 
as type I plus Ea, and anatomic left lobectomy was 
performed and extrahepatic stones were removed 
(Figure 4A). In a case of a stone localized in atrophic 
segment VIII, hepatolithiasis was classified as type 
I, and segmentectomy of S8 was performed (Figure 
4B). In a case of stones localized in the atrophic right 
posterior portion of the liver, anatomic right posterior 
sectionectomy was performed (Figure 4C).
3.3.2. Bilateral lobectomy excluding the caudate lobe for 
type II hepatolithiasis
From March 2003 to July 2011, 252 patients with type 
II hepatolithiasis at this Institute underwent surgery. 
Of these, 12 (4.8%) underwent bilateral lobectomy 
excluding the caudate lobe. In a typical case, a 39-yearold female had diffusely distributed stones with atrophy 
in all segments except for the caudate lobe (Figure 5). 
All 12 of the patients successfully underwent bilateral 
lobectomy excluding the caudate lobe.
4. Conclusion
Economic development and a more Western lifestyle 
are associated with a decline in the incidence of

hepatolithiasis, but the same is not true for East Asia. 
Moreover, immigration from the Asian-Pacific region 
means that this rare but emerging disease will pose a 
therapeutic challenge to doctors in the West as well. 
The optimal management of complex hepatolithiasis 
remains a very difficult and challenging task for 
hepatobiliary surgeons. Surgery should be indicated for 
all cases of hepatolithiasis. The current report describes 
the largest number of patients with hepatolithiasis 
treated with a hepatectomy (Table 4) and a novel 
classification to help in determining surgical strategies. 
Segmentectomy is an effective treatment for type I and 
type IIb hepatolithiasis. The caudate lobe is a unique 
segment that is anatomically separate from the rest of 
the liver; if the liver were a car, the caudate lobe would 
be its "spare tire". Finally, better selection of which 
patients should undergo a hepatectomy will lead to 
better mid-to long-term outcomes.
