Abstract
Background Confronting a once-in-a-century pandemic with COVID-19, tremendous stress has been placed in all walks 
of life worldwide.
Aims In order to enhance scientifc information interfow in the arena of liver diseases in Asia–Pacifc region during this 
difcult time, Asian-Pacifc Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) has taken the initiative to form the APASL 
COVID-19 Taskforce to formulate a clinical practice guidance in Hepatology, liver-related oncology, transplantation and 
conduct of clinical trials.
Methods A taskforce with 22 key opinion leaders in Hepatology from 16 countries or administration regions in Asia–Pacifc 
regions was formed and through intense interaction via webinar, this guidance was formulated. Based on scientifc data and 
experiences, recommendations were made in the management of liver injury, liver transplantation, autoimmune diseases, 
chronic liver diseases, delivery of elective and emergency services and conduct of clinical trials.
Conclusions This is the frst consensus clinical guidance synthesized by APASL for our hepatologist and their allied medical personal.

Introduction: [Payawal Diana (Philippines), 
Tanwandee Tawesak (Thailand)]
As per World Health Organisation (WHO) on 4 May 2020, 
COVID-19 has been responsible for 3,407,747 confrmed 
cases with 238,198 (7.0%) deaths around the world [1]. 
There is an urgent need for guidance in the practice of Hepatology. A taskforce with 22 members from 16 countries or 
administration regions in Asia–Pacifc regions was formed 
and through intense interaction via webinar, this guidance 
was made. Our Taskforce has also formed the electronic 
database to collect liver injury data from patients who suffered from COVID-19 in Asia–Pacifc region “APCOLIS” 
study (“APASL COVID Liver Injury Spectrum) (https://
www.surveymonkey.com/r/covid-liver). These recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended 
to be fexible and modifable according to local conditions. 
To more fully characterize the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations, the Guideline Committee of the 
APASL adopted a Class (refecting beneft versus risk) and 
Level (assessing strength or certainty) of Evidence reported 
with each recommendation [2].

Overview: [Sharma Manoj (India), Wasim

Epidemiology, clinical features and assessment
WHO recommends using various categories (no cases, 
sporadic cases, clusters of cases and community transmission) to describe transmission patterns at national and subnational levels (wherever possible) to guide decisions for 
preparedness, readiness and response activities. According 
to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplet, by direct 
contact with infected people or contact with contaminated 
surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects 
used on the infected person. Airborne transmission may 
be possible when procedures that generate aerosols are 
performed on infected patients. Such procedures include 
endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, 
administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation, 
turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the 
patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure 
ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In addition, several studies reported that SARSCoV-2, were isolated from feces and urine patients [1]. But 
it is unclear whether human-to-human transmission can be 
implemented by the above routes. Asymptomatic patients 
can also be a source of infection [3]. Early dynamics studies in Wuhan suggested a doubling time of the number of 
infected persons of 6–7 days and a median R0 value of 5.7 
(95% CI 3.8–8.9) [4].
In a meta-analysis of 43 studies involving 3600 COVID19 patients, fever [83.3% (95% CI 78.4–87.7)], cough 
[60.3% (54.2–66.3)], and fatigue [38.0% (29.8–46.5)] 
were the most common clinical symptoms, followed by 
increased sputum production, shortness of breath, and 
myalgia, with estimated prevalence just under 30% for 
each, respectively [5]. Of 1141 confirmed COVID-19 
cases from Wuhan, 183 (16%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms only [6]. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein 
[68.6% (58.2–78.2)], decreased lymphocyte count [57.4% 
(44.8–69.5)] and increased lactate dehydrogenase [51.6% 
(31.4–71.6)]. Ground-glass opacities [80.0% (67.3–90.4)] 
and bilateral pneumonia [73.2% (63.4–82.1)] were the 
most frequently reported fndings on computed tomography. The overall estimated proportion of severe cases 
and case-fatality rate was 25.6% (17.4–34.9) and 3.6% 
(1.1–7.2), respectively [5]. According to the US Centre for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), patients>65 years 
old, with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, morbid 
obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic 
liver disease are at higher risk for severe COVID-19.7
More prominent laboratory abnormalities (lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer, LDH) may be risk factors for poor 
outcome [8]. Recently, risk score model such as CALL 
(Comorbidities, older Age, higher Lactate dehydrogenase 
and lower Lymphocyte count) had been shown to have 
positive and negative predictive values of disease progression of 50.7% (38.9% - 62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% - 99.8%), 
respectively [9].
WHO case defnition includes (1) suspect case-a patient 
with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/
symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of 
breath), and a history of travel to or residence in a location 
reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease 
during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; or patient with 
any acute respiratory illness and having been in contact with 
a confrmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days 
prior to symptom onset; or a patient with severe acute respiratory illness and the absence of an alternative diagnosis 
that fully explains the clinical presentation; (2) probable 
case-a suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 
virus is inconclusive, or a suspect case for whom testing 
could not be performed for any reason; (3) confrmed case -a 
person with laboratory confrmation of COVID-19 infection, 
irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms [1]. Countries 
may need to adapt case defnitions depending on their local 
epidemiological situation and other factors. Confrmation of 
COVID-19 is based on detection of virus RNA by nucleic 
acid amplifcation test (NAAT) such as real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The 
viral genes targeted so far include the N, E, S and RdRP 
genes. RNA extraction should be done in a biosafety cabinet 
in a BSL-2 or equivalent facility.
Recommendations
(1) COVID-19 patients should be diagnosed based on 
World Health Organization interim guidance. [Class I, 
level C]
(2) Decision of virological testing should be based on clinical and epidemiological factors and linked to an assessment of the likelihood of infection. [Class I, level C]
How to assess and manage liver injury 
in Covid‑19 patients? [Lau George (Hong 
Kong SAR and Beijing, China), Sharma Manoj 
(India), Hasmik Ghazinyan (Armenia), Guan 
Richard (Singapore)]
The pattern of liver injury is mainly hepatocellular, rather than 
cholestatic, with elevation of serum alanine transaminases. 
Most studies have taken any elevation of liver enzymes as evidence of liver injury [10–12]. In one study, a diferentiation 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:415–428 417
1 3
was made between elevated liver enzymes (any elevation 
above the ULN) and liver injury (ALT and/or AST>3×ULN; 
ALP, GGT, and/or total bilirubin>2×ULN). Elevated liver 
enzymes and liver injury were seen in 50% and 5% at admission; and 76.3% and 21.3% during hospitalization respectively 
[12]. Rarely, COVID-19 infection can present as acute hepatitis with transaminases 10-20xULN at admission with all other 
causes having been ruled out [13].
The underlying mechanism of liver injury remains speculative. The putative mechanisms of liver injury in COVID19 infection include direct cytopathic efects of the virus, 
immune imbalance and cytokine storm related multiorgan 
damage, hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction and drug induced 
liver injury due to various types of drugs used for management of COVID-19 infection.
Direct cytopathic efects of the virus
One recent study using single cell RNA sequencing on fresh 
liver tissue specimens from 4 deceased donors of liver transplants (after circulatory death) found ACE 2 expression in 
59.7% of cholangiocytes cluster of cells as compared to 2.6% 
of hepatocytes. Average expression level in hepatocytes is 
twentyfold less than the expression level in the cholangiocytes population. In fact ACE expression level in cholangiocytes is comparable to Alveolar Type 2 cells [14]. Studies in 
liver ductal organoids inoculated with COVID-19 found that 
human liver ductal organoids are susceptible to COVID- 19 
infection and support robust viral replication, and COVID19 infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting 
functions of cholangiocytes [15]. In a mouse model of acute 
liver injury with partial hepatectomy, ACE2 expression in 
the liver was down regulated on the frst day, but it was 
elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day 
and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver 
recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. The experimental results implied the up regulation of ACE2 expression 
in the liver was caused by compensatory proliferation of 
hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells during 
acute liver injury [16]. Considering the COVID-19 patients 
with liver injury mainly manifests as elevation of serum 
aminotransferases ( cholestatic enzymes are elevated less 
commonly), it seems that hepatocytes are not targeted by 
COVID-19,or at least not through ACE2. Liver damages in 
patients might not be caused directly by viral infection of 
hepatocytes and liver injury in COVID-19 may thus have 
alternative pathophysiology and etiology.
Immune imbalance and cytokine storm related 
multiorgan damage
Pathologically, liver injury is accompanied by hepatocyte 
degeneration, focal necrosis, capillary bile duct cholestasis 
and infammation in the portal area but interestingly, SARSCoV2 cannot be detected [17]. In the absence of infuenza 
virus particles in the liver, “collateral damage” resulting 
from expanding CD8+ T-cell populations has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver injury during infuenza 
infections [18] In keeping with this, post-mortem liver 
biopsy in patients who died from COVID-19 showed only 
microvesicular steatosis, accompanied by hyperactivation of 
T cells suggesting that liver injury is likely immune mediated 
rather than direct cytopathic damage as described in other 
viral respiratory disease [19]. The overproduction of proinfammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor,IL-6, (IL)-2, 
IL-7, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemo 
attractant protein 1, macrophage infammatory protein 1-α 
and IL-11) have been described as a cytokine storm, leading 
to an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability, multiorgan failure, and eventually death when the high cytokine 
concentrations are unabated over time [20]. Activation of 
coagulation pathways during the immune response to infection results in over production of pro infammatory cytokines 
leading to multiorgan injury. During infammation, the anticoagulant concentrations declined due to reduced production 
and increasing consumption. This procoagulat-anticoagulant 
imbalance predisposes to the development of microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan 
failure [21].
Hypoxia reperfusion dysfunction
Hypoxia and shock induced by COVID-19-related complications (such as respiratory distress syndrome, systemic 
infammatory response syndrome, and multiple organ failure) may also cause hepatic ischemia and hypoxia reperfusion dysfunction. Oxygen reduction and lipid accumulation 
in hepatocytes during shock and hypoxic conditions could 
lead to cell death. The subsequent mitochondrial damage, 
marked increase in reactive oxygen species and their peroxidation products can act as a second messenger, activating 
redox sensitive transcription factors, and further amplifying the release of multiple proinfammatory factors, causing liver damage [22]. Pneumonia associated hypoxia is an 
important factor causing secondary liver injury in COVID19 patients.
Drug induced liver injury
Moderate microvascular steatosis [23, 24] with mild hepatic 
infammation in liver pathology (postmortem) COVID-19 
patients indicates the possibility of mitochondrial damage 
due to drug induced liver injury. Previously, it has been 
reported that patients sufering from viral infections, such 
as hepatitis C and human immunodefciency viruses, are 
more prone to developing drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 

418 Hepatology International (2020) 14:415–428
1 3
[25]. It is unclear whether COVID-19 infection also predisposes to DILI. MAFLD, a recently recognised comorbidity 
factor for disease progression in COVID-19, can sensitize 
the liver for hepatotoxicants such as acetaminophen, used as 
antipyretic for symptomatic treatment. [26]. Also, patients 
sufering from COVID-19 were shown to have an increased 
serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) which is a chemokine known to exacerbate steatohepatitis.
Actemra (tocilizumab) – an interleukin-6 inhibitor – has 
been approved in China for the treatment of COVID-19 
patients with serious lung damage and accompanying elevated blood levels of IL-6 [27]. The use of these immune 
suppressive therapy in other disease conditions has been 
shown to result in fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatitis B virus reactivation in patients with chronic hepatitis 
B infection [28]. A number of therapeutic agents, namely 
chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir and traditional Chinese medicines 
(TCM) are being used in the treatment of COVID-19 with 
variable degree of hepatotoxicity. (Table 1) [29–32] A 
recent study on 417 patients with COVID-19,use of lopinavir/ritonavir increased the odds of liver injury (ALT and/
or AST>3×ULN; ALP, GGT, and/or TBIL>2×ULN) by 
7-fold [12]. On 1st May 2020, Remdesivir, a nucleotide ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase inhibitors, has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency treatment for those hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease. 
Liver function derangement, which lead to drug withdrawal, 
has been reported in patients treated with Remdesivir [33].
The severity and frequency of liver injury correlate with 
the severity of COVID-19; those with disease progression 
have severe liver injury more frequently [2, 10, 11, 13, 34]. 
In one recent study, it was found that after adjustment for 
age, sex, epidemiological history, liver comorbidities, and 
initial symptoms, liver injury(ALT and/or AST>3×ULN; 
ALP, GGT, and/or TBIL>2× ULN) had an odds ratio of 
9.04 (95% CI 3.19–25.6) for developing severe COVID-19 
[12]. Emerging data suggest that pre-existing CLD occurred 
in 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 and patients with 
underlying metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver 
disease (MAFLD) are more susceptible to disease progression with more prolonged viral shedding [35].
Figure 1 shows an approach to elevated liver enzymes in 
a COVID-19 patient.
Recommendations
(1) Expectant treatment with constant liver function tests 
is adequate in most instances [Class I, level C].
(2) All COVID-19 patients should be screened for hepatitis 
B surface antigen and nucleos(t)ide analogues should 
be prescribed, especially in those planned for treatment 
with IL-6 monoclonal antibody or other immunosuppressive therapy [Class I, level C].
(3) Patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease should have liver 
function test monitored closely [Class I, level C].

(4) Drug-induced liver injury during the treatment of 
COVID-19 should not be ignored and needs to be carefully investigated [Class I, level C].
(5) Investigational treatments for COVID-19 may cause 
elevation of serum aminotransferases, but the overall 
incidence is not signifcantly diferent from placebo or 
general COVID-19 patients. Close monitoring of liver 
function tests is recommended in these patients [Class 
I, level B].
(6) Patients with chronic liver disease should be regarded 
as risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression and 
should be prioritised as candidate for drug trial [Class 
I, level C].
(7) Close monitoring of liver function in patients, especially those with CLD, treated with Remdesivir; 
patients with decompensated CLD and those with 
ALT>5 times upper limit of normal, should not be 
treated with Remdesivir [Class I, level C].

Sarin Shiv (India)]
Consultations (outpatients and inpatients)
Health care workers and other hospital staf are at risk for 
COVID-19. Healthcare workers with SARS-CoV-2 may 
spread the virus to patients and to each other, and should 
stay away from inpatient and outpatient work until approval 
of clinical duty resumption issued by local health authorities is obtained. Minimizing interactions among healthcare 
workers and between healthcare workers and patients is critical to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Minimizing the 
transport of patients within and between healthcare facilities 
could reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Recommendations
(1) Conduct outpatient clinic and inpatient rounds of nonCOVID patients with the minimum number of personnel needed for care provision at a given time. [Class I, 
level C]
(2) Discourage in-person multidisciplinary rounds with 
dietary, pharmacy, social work, and care coordination 
staf. [Class I, Level C]
(3) Assess whether the patient can have future encounters 
by phone or telemedicine and encourage early monitoring by these means to reduce in-person visits. [Class I, 
level C]
(4) Consider seeing in person only new patients with urgent 
issues and clinically signifcant liver disease (e.g., jaundice, elevated ALT or AST>500 U/L, recent onset of 
hepatic decompensation). [Class I, level C]
(5) Assess the albumin infusion needs to a patient. If 
patient requires twice a week or more often albumin, 
one should consider admitting such a patient. [Class 
IIb, level C]. Oral intake of foods containing high albumin or oral preparations of albumin need to be evaluated in the interim period.

Imaging
Chronic liver disease particularly in patients with cirrhosis is a major risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Interval 
HCC surveillance can facilitate detection of early HCC 
[36]. Although HCC surveillance with ultrasound and AFP 
every 6 months is recommended, there should be a balance 
between the risk of a delayed HCC detection and the risk 
of spreading COVID-19 during the process of HCC surveillance. There was a report of similarly overall survival 
with 12-monthly HCC surveillance [37]. Therefore, delaying HCC surveillance is reasonable during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
Recommendations
(1) For stable HCC patients without COVID-19, continue 
monitoring with telemedicine and local AFP. [Class I, 
level C]
(2) Continue HCC surveillance in high risk subjects (cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B) for HCC, adhering to the 
planned schedule if possible. A delay of 2 months is 
acceptable after discussing the risks and benefts of 
delaying surveillance with the patient. [Class I, level C]
(3) Patients with increased risk of HCC such as elevation of 
AFP or presence of liver nodule should be prioritized 
for HCC-surveillance. [Class I, level C]
(4) Transportation of COVID-19 patients for imaging study 
such as ultrasound should be avoided unless there is a 
presence of strong indication. [Class 1, level C]
Liver biopsy
The angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE2), the receptor 
for COVID-19 viral entry, have been shown to be expressed 
on cholangiocytes [14]. Liver biopsy may have a risk of 
COVID-19 viral transmission.
Recommendations
(1) Among patients not infected with COVID-19, cancel 
all elective/non-urgent liver biopsy procedures. [Class 
I, level C]
(2) Liver biopsy could be performed in patients not infected 
with COVID-19 in circumstances where biopsy fndings will have a major impact on the management like 
suspected autoimmune fare or rejection. [Class I, level 
C]
(3) Liver biopsy should not be done in COVID-19 infected 
patients. [Class I, level C]
Endoscopy
Variceal bleeding is one of the common and important 
complications in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Surveillance for high risk varices is recommended 
for considering primary prophylaxis in patients with high 
risk of variceal bleeding [38]. As COVID-19 virus has 
been detected in saliva and feces, endoscopy can be a risk 
for COVID-19 transmission [39, 40]. In addition, upper 
endoscopic procedure could be aerosol generating [41].
Recommendations
(1) Elective or non-urgent endoscopy should be deferred. 
Non-invasive tool such as LSM, Fib-4 or platelet 
count may be used to identify patients with high risk 
of variceal bleeding (Baveno VI criteria) [42]. [Class 
I, level C]
(2) Urgent or emergency endoscopy procedures for upper 
or lower GI bleeding and ascending cholangitis should 
be performed. [Class 1, level C]
(3) All health care workers involved with endoscopic 
procedures in confrmed or high risk of COVID-19 
patients should wear PPE including N95 mask with 
face shield, water impervious long-sleeved gown and 
gloves; whereas for endoscopic procedures in a patient 
at low risk of COVID-19 healthcare workers should 
wear N95 with face shield, water impervious longsleeved gown and gloves. [Class I,Level C]
Emergency services in hepatology: [Gani 
Rino (Indonesia), Kadir Dokmeci (Turkey)]
SARS-CoV-2 virus use ACE2 receptor to enter the cells. 
The ACE2 receptors can be found not only in the airway 
system but also in gastrointestinal organs. SARS-CoV-2 
virus are detected in faecal samples [43] raising the possibility of fecal transmission. Gastrointestinal bleeding or 
signs of cholangitis can complicate the management of 
patient with Covid-19 and endoscopy may be considered 
of high-risk because high concentration of Sars-Cov-2 
virus in pulmonary and gastrointestinal secretion [44]. 
Several societies such as The British Society of Gastroenterology and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy have released guidance for performing endoscopy 
in Covid-19 patients. They underline the prioritisation of 
cases to reduce the workload, minimize the potential exposure to health personnel and the chance of virus transmission. Proper PPE should be worn by all the health personnel and endoscopy should be performed only in urgent

situation. Care must be taken in donning and dofng the 
PPE.
Intestinal evacuations, especially intestinal lavage are 
high risk procedures. In cirrhosis patient with liver encephalopathy or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal lavage 
from rectal approach should be discouraged and replaced 
by oral laxative.
Recommendations
(1) Postpone all elective/non-urgent procedures [Class I, 
Level C]
(2) Emergency procedures should be performed when 
needed, e.g., liver biopsy to rule out graft rejection or 
diagnose autoimmune hepatitis, therapeutic paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, 
endoscopy for variceal bleeding, band ligation, urgent 
biliary procedures for cholangitis and sepsis. [Class I, 
Level C]
(3) All healthcare workers involved with endoscopic and 
other emergency procedures in confrmed or at high 
risk of COVID-19 patients should wear N95 mask with 
face shield, water impervious long-sleeved gown and 
gloves. [Class I, level C]
Management of liver transplantation 
and autoimmune diseases: [Strasser 
Simone(Australia), Wei Lai (China)]
Liver transplant
The COVID-19 pandemic has had enormous impacts on the 
provision of liver transplantation (LT) around the world. The 
capacity to provide LT has been impacted severely due to 
reduced referrals of deceased donors and diversion of hospital and ICU resources to COVID-19 cases [45, 46]. Other 
impacts include the risk of LT recipients or live donors 
acquiring SARS-COV-2 infection during hospitalization and 
the possibility of transmission from an undiagnosed donor 
to a recipient or to healthcare workers.
In view of the limitations in access to personal protective 
equipment (PPE) and other resources during the pandemics, 
and transmission risks to patients and healthcare workers, 
governments in many countries have implemented restrictions on elective surgery. Liver transplant units around the 
world have observed signifcantly reduced transplant activity 
and needed to prioritize those patients at highest risk mortality if transplant procedure was delayed.
The impacts of COVID-19 in LT patients may difer if the 
infection is acquired in the perioperative or early post-transplant period when immunosuppressive levels are highest and 
potentially more severe COVID-19. On the other hand, some 
long-term post-transplant patients may also have many of the 
comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, that have been 
associated with severe COVID-19 [47, 48]. There are also 
concerns that hospitalized immune suppressed patients may 
have prolonged viral shedding [49], posing a risk to contacts.
To date there have been few reports of the impacts of 
COVID-19 infection on LT recipients. Reports from transplant centers are emerging from China [50], Spain [51] 
and Italy [52]. Current evidence suggests that the profle of 
COVID-19 infection may be no worse in LT patients than in 
non-transplant patients and there may be lower risk of hyperinfammation, cytokine storm and severe lung injury seen in 
patients with severe respiratory-COVID-19 infection [43], 
suggesting that the presence of immunosuppressive therapy 
may modify the host response to infection. However, high 
mortality rates in long-term transplant recipients have been 
reported from some transplant centers [51–53], particularly 
in patients on low immunosuppression and with the metabolic comorbidities that predict severe disease and mortality in non-transplant patients. Recommendations regarding 
the impact of COVID-19 on LT services and the care of 
LT patients have emerged from various transplant centers 
[54–57].
Recommendations
(1) Consider limiting LT to emergency and urgent cases 
only (eg acute liver failure, high MELD, high risk of 
HCC progression) according to local resource limitations and status of the outbreak. [Class I, level C]
(2) Look for presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage fuid of 
donor or evidence of COVID-19 infection on chest CT 
scan prior to organ procurement. Negative test results 
may not exclude infection. [Class I, Level C]
(3) Avoid use of deceased or live donors with evidence of 
COVID-19 infection. [Class I, level C]
(4) Assessment of LT recipients for COVID-19 infection, 
particularly in the presence of symptoms or contact 
with a known COVID-19 case. Risks of LT during 
infection must be balanced against risk of delaying 
LT, and the risks to healthcare workers. [Class I, level 
C]
(5) Consider specifc consent of all patients on the LT 
waiting list regarding the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on their situation. [Class I, level C]
(6) Patients who undergo liver transplantation during the 
COVID-19 pandemic should be managed with standard immunosuppression protocols [Class I, level C]
(7) Immunosuppression doses should not be reduced in 
long-term LT patients in the absence of COVID-19 
infection. Reduction of routine immunosuppression 

422 Hepatology International (2020) 14:415–428
1 3
risks an episode of allograft rejection. [Class I, level 
C]
(8) Reduction of immunosuppression may be considered in patients diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 
infection. Immunosuppression should be reduced in 
patients with lymphopenia, fever, or worsening pneumonia. Adrenal insufciency must be avoided and 
allograft function must be carefully monitored. [Class 
I, level C]
(9) Transplant patients who develop severe COVID-19 
should be managed according to local protocols. 
Drug-drug interactions must be considered. [Class I, 
level C]
(10) Transplant centers should assist their patients to 
avoid COVID-19 infection yet maintaining transplant 
follow-up by reinforcement of hand hygiene, social 
isolation and physical distancing recommendations 
and avoidance of nosocomial transmission. Disease 
control and follow-up should be maintained through 
altered pathways including telehealth/telephone consultation and local blood testing. Immediate medical 
attention must be provided when indicated. [Class I, 
level C]
(11) All LT recipients should receive vaccination against 
infuenza and pneumococcal infection. [ Class I, Level 
B]
Autoimmune diseases
The impact of COVID-19 infection on patients with autoimmune liver diseases (AILD), including autoimmune 
hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, is unclear. However, there are no data to 
suggest these patients, even if immunosuppressed, are at 
increased risk of severe infection. There is a signifcant risk 
of under-treatment if diagnosis is delayed in patients with 
new-onset disease or if doses of immunosuppressive medications are reduced based on theoretical concerns that immunosuppressed patients are at particular risk. Furthermore, 
clinicians should aim to provide diagnostic investigations, 
therapeutic procedures and long-term monitoring through 
the pandemic as interruptions may have signifcant impacts 
on long-term outcomes. Some guidance regarding the care 
of patients with AILD from experienced centers heavily 
impacted by COVID-19 is emerging [58]. Registry-level 
data are anticipated in the future.
Recommendations
Patients with AILD should be diagnosed and managed 
according to standard guidelines. [Class I, level C]
In patients without COVID-19 infection, maintenance 
immunosuppressive medication doses should be maintained at lowest efective doses and should not be reduced 
or ceased. [Class I, level C]
Patients with AILD and mild COVID-19 infection should 
continue their usual immunosuppression and other medications. [Class I, level C]
Patients with AILD and severe COVID-19 infection 
should be managed according to local protocols. Corticosteroids should not be discontinued, stress-doses may 
be required. [Class I, level C]
Clinicians should assist their patients to avoid COVID19 infection by reinforcement of hand hygiene, social 
isolation and physical distancing recommendations and 
avoidance of nosocomial transmission. Disease control 
and follow-up should be maintained through altered pathways including telehealth/telephone consultation and 
local blood testing. Immediate medical attention must be 
provided when indicated. [Class I, level C]
Patients with AILD should receive vaccination against 
infuenza and pneumococcal infection. [Class I, level B]
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: 
Laurentius Adrianto Lesmana (Indonesia), 
Tatsuo Kanda (Japan), Masao Omata (Japan)
One of the cell surface receptor candidates for SARS-CoV-2 
is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which exists in 
human airway epithelial cells as well as cholangiocytes and 
hepatocytes. Therefore, this virus and/or COVID-19 may 
afect the natural course of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Screening for HCC in stable outpatients with chronic 
viral hepatitis or cirrhosis
It is important to avoid or reduce the opportunity to contact 
with SARS-CoV2 infected patients. Although the duration 
of follow-up for patients depends on the local epidemic situation of COVID-19, delay of 2-3 months seems to be reasonable even in higher risk patients. If possible, computed 
tomography (CT) of chest may also be performed when 
abdominal CT is performed as chest CT examination can 
accidentally diagnose COVID-19. [59] Telemedicine and 
phoned prescription may be useful to avoid “face to face” 
contact. [60]
Recommendations
(1) Avoid frequent visits to hospitals and postpone patient 
visits for screening HCC. [Class I, level C]
(2) Refer to imaging guidance for HCC screening

Treatment for HCC patients
In general, APASL HCC guidelines [61] should be observed. 
However, at present, it is not completely ruled out that transfusion transmits SARS-CoV2 [62]. Clinicians should pay 
careful attention to the blood supply in HCC resection, as 
most blood donation centers in many endemic areas around 
the world have closed [63]. Transplantation also requires 
long-term use of immunosuppressants, which may be a risk 
for COVID-19. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 using new diagnostic tools [64] should be carefully performed in both donor 
and recipient. After transplantation, careful follow-up should 
also be paid [65].
The efects of COVID-19 in patients with HCC is not 
known. In general, cancer patients are more susceptible to 
infections than individuals without cancer, due to systemic 
immune suppressive state due to malignancy and anticancer treatments [66]. Therefore, these patients might be at 
increased risk of COVID-19 and have a poorer prognosis. 
In a recent study on 1590 COVID-19 cases (admitted for 
acute respiratory COVID-19) from 575 hospitals in China, 
it was found that 18 (1%; 95% CI 0.61–1.65) had a history of 
cancer (although none of the patients had history of HCC). 
This fgure seemed to be higher than the incidence of cancer 
in the overall Chinese population [285.83 (0.29%) per 100 
000 people [2015 cancer epidemiology statistics], suggesting that cancer patients were more susceptible to infection 
[67]. Twenty fve percent of cancer patients had chemotherapy or surgery in the last 1 month. Patients with cancer 
were observed to have a higher risk of severe events. Also, 
patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those 
without cancer [median time to severe events: 13 vs 43 days 
(20–not reached), p<0.0001; Hazard ratio 3.56 (95% CI 
1.65–7.69), after adjusting for age]. After adjusting for other 
risk factors, including age, smoking history, and other comorbidities, patients who had undergone chemotherapy or 
surgery within last 1 month had higher odds of developing 
severe events [OR=5.34 (1.80–16.18); p=0.0026] as compared to patients who had not undergone such procedure 
within the last 1 month. However, concerns remain regarding generalizability of the study, with such a small sample 
size with a large amount of heterogeneity (various cancer 
types with diferent biological behaviors, highly variable 
disease courses, and diverse treatment strategies). However, 
the specifc clinical strategies for patients with HCC remain 
unclear. This is a yet published scenario with scarce data. 
It is unknown whether patients with HCC are at increased 
risk for severe COVID-19 by virtue of their malignancy. 
The efect of TACE, immunotherapy (Check point inhibitors) and kinase inhibitors on risk of getting COVID-19 and 
developing severe COVID-19 if infected remains unknown.
Stress related to isolation and fear of COVID-19, might 
result in a surge of alcohol intake in patients with HCC and 
should be avoided [68]. The risk of fatality has been related 
to preexisting comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension 
which need to be carefully managed [69].
In HCC patients with COVID-19, COVID-19 should initially be treated. Attention should be paid to immunosuppressants and drug-drug interactions in HCC patients, as 
most had advanced liver diseases like cirrhosis.
Recommendations
(1) For newly diagnosed HCC patients, postponing of elective transplant, resection surgery, or radiotherapy may 
be considered. [Class IIa, level C]. Ablative procedures, 
transcatheter arterial chemo embolization, kinase inhibitors or immunotherapy may be initiated. Change of 
immunotherapy schedules to 4–6 weeks may be considered. [Class IIA, level C]
(2) Among uninfected HCC patients who are already on 
treatment, HCC treatment should proceed as deemed 
appropriate. [Class I, level C]. Uninfected patients 
already on kinase inhibitors may continue treatment. 
Change of immunotherapy schedules to 4–6 weeks may 
be considered. [Class IIa, level C]
(3) Avoid excessive alcohol intake. [Class I, level C]
(4) Careful management of comorbid conditions such as 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertension [Class I, level C]
(5) If HCC patients get infected with COVID-19, withhold 
immunotherapy directed towards HCC. [Class I, level 
C]
Chronic liver diseases as risk factors 
for covid‑19 disease progression: [Kao 
Jia‑Horng (Taiwan), Yokosuka Osamu 
(Japan)]
There is no evidence suggesting patients with stable chronic 
liver diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis or MAFLD have increased susceptibility to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, advanced cirrhosis, HCC, 
autoimmune liver diseases, and post liver transplant patients 
may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection as they are 
immuno-compromised.
The interactions between chronic liver diseases and 
COVID 19 remain largely unknown. The prevalence of 
chronic liver disease in COVID-19 patients ranges from 
2–11% [10]. At the time of this writing, there is limited 
Information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on patients 
with chronic liver diseases. In an early pooled analysis of 
6 studies [4 studies compared CLD in severe vs non severe 

424 Hepatology International (2020) 14:415–428
1 3
cases (total 702 patients with 371 (52.8%) having severe 
disease); and 2 studies compared rate of CLD in non-survivors vs survivors (total 202 patients with 100 (49.5%) being 
non survivors), it was concluded that CLD was not associated with increased odds of severe form of COVID-19 or 
with increased odds of mortality from COVID-19 [70]. A 
recent study including 15 patients with chronic hepatitis B 
and COVID-19 showed that they had higher total bilirubin 
levels, more severe disease course (46.7% vs. 24.1%), and a 
higher mortality rate (13.3% vs. 2.8%) compared with those 
without HBV infection [71], suggesting COVID-19 patients 
with HBV co-infection may be easier to develop liver injury 
with more adverse outcomes and mortality. However, this 
should be carefully examined because of the small number 
of hepatitis B patients in the report. The number of fatal 
COVID 19 patients in Europe where the hepatitis B is not 
endemic is not lower than in Chinese patients. In contrast, 
chronic viral hepatitis appears not to increase the risk of 
a severe course of COVID-19 [72]. In the meantime, a 
study on 202 COVID-19 patients revealed that 76 MAFLD 
patients had a higher risk of COVID-19 disease progression, 
higher likelihood of abnormal liver function from admission 
to discharge and longer viral shedding time when compared 
to non-MAFLD subjects [35]. The liver contains the largest 
number of macrophages (Kupfer cells) in the body and is a 
potent cytokine producer. Impaired hepatic innate immune 
status might play a critical role in COVID-19 outcome. In 
MAFLD patients, impaired innate immunity (manifested 
by derailed functional diversity of macrophages, imbalance 
between inflammation promoting M1 macrophages and 
infammation suppressing M2 macrophages) and increased 
production of pro-infammatory cytokines like TNF-α by 
adipose cells and Kupfer cells, may predispose MAFLD 
patients to severe COVID-infection [35]. It is unclear if the 
risk is specifc to MAFLD or to co-existing metabolic risk 
factors such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity, which are known to be associated with COVID-19 
severity.
Efects of COVID-19 infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis are unknown. Whether acute-on-chronic 
liver failure can be precipitated by COVID-19 remains 
unknown. It is important to evaluate patients with liver disease for COVID-19 if they develop new onset encephalopathy or other acute decompensation.
Currently, there is no specifc treatment for liver dysfunction in COVID-19 related liver injury. We should target the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and maintain the original therapy for 
underlying chronic liver diseases.
Recommendations
(1) Patients with liver cirrhosis/liver cancer/ on immunosuppressive therapy (AIH or post LT) might be more 
susceptible to COVID-19 infection because of their 
systemic immune compromised status [Class IIA, level 
C].
(2) Patients with stable chronic hepatitis B or C or MAFLD 
or cholestatic liver diseases may have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. [ Class IIA level C]
(3) Chronic HBV, MAFLD and cirrhosis are possible risk 
factors for severe COVID19 [Class I, level B]. Patients 
with advanced liver diseases should carefully observe 
the rules of physical distancing to avoid COVID 19. 
[Class I, level C]
(4) Among COVID-19 non-infected patients, continue 
treatment for hepatitis B and hepatitis C if already on 
treatment. For newly diagnosed patients, proceed with 
antiviral treatment of hepatitis B and C as clinically 
warranted. [Class I, level C]
(5) Among infected patients, continue treatment for hepatitis B and hepatitis C if already on treatment. Initiating 
treatment of hepatitis B in a patient with COVID-19 
is not routinely warranted but should be considered 
if there is clinical suspicion of a hepatitis B fare or 
patient is planned for treatment with IL-6 monoclonal 
antibody or other immunosuppressive therapies. Initiating treatment of hepatitis C in a patient with COVID-19 
is not routinely warranted. [ Class I, level C]
(6) Discuss with the patients the diagnosis and management of advanced liver disease and document it. [Class 
I, level C]
Conduct of clinical trials: [Sollano 
Jose(Philippine),Yang Jin Mo (South Korea), 
Gregory Cheng (Macau SAR, China)]
To date, a lot of the clinical trials involving liver diseases, 
such as viral hepatitis, fatty liver and liver cancer, are conducted in Asia–Pacifc region [73]. Many of these trials are 
meant for global registration and hence need to comply not 
only with local authority but also US FDA and European 
Medicines Agency. With the need for social distancing, quarantine and isolation implemented in response to pandemic 
COVID-19, site visits, trial medication administration and 
supply chain, samples and data collection and monitoring 
related to the conduct of clinical trials are facing great challenges [74, 75]. For many studies, screening of new subjects 
cannot be proceeded. Patients already in screening or on 
study are to continue treatment. To strike a balance between 
trial integrity and safety of patients, investigators and medical research personnel maintaining compliance with specifc 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:415–428 425
1 3
guidance would be of utmost importance. In this connection, timely modifcations of protocol in accordance to local 
environment and the nature of the trial might be required. 
With the widely available audio-visual real time contact via 
internet, the implementation of electronic informed consent, 
remote safety, performance outcome and interview-based 
clinician-reported outcome assessments would minimize 
the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to trial participants and 
studies. Speedy home delivery would ensure continuing 
use of the medications. Certain conditional adjustment with 
approval of the IRB could also be adopted as in reality, protocol deviation is almost unavoidable.
Recommendations
(1) Careful evaluation of the operational capability of the 
site in terms of adequate PPE for medical personal, 
extra checking on travel and contact history, temperature test and even throat swab test for SARS-CoV2. [ 
Class I, level C]
(2) Communicate with sponsor to evaluate how alternative 
processes for safety assessments and study procedures 
such as phone contact, virtual visit, alternative location 
for local lab test or imaging scan could be implemented 
for the subjects who cannot attend the scheduled visits 
at site. Investigators would make treatment decisions 
upon review of all available safety information and discussion with study medical monito. [Class I, level C]
(3) Arrange home delivery of medication to subjects, 
whom investigators considered safe to continue treatment. If the supply chain or shipment of investigational 
product (IP) to the site is afected, site-to-site transfer 
of IP, sponsor to patient transfer of IP (bypassing clinical trial pharmacies) or commercially purchasing the 
approved product could be implemented. IP administration such as infusion could be done via home nursing 
or local healthcare providers. [Class I, level C]
(4) Document a listing of all study visits or procedures 
that are deviations from the protocol due to COVID19 pandemic and submit the report with deviation reason to the IRB. The listing could simplify the report of 
protocol deviation (PD) since a large number of PD is 
expected to occur. [Class I, level C]
(5) Notify local regulations and IRB of the contingency 
measures for the COVID-19 pandemic and make sure 
the measures are acceptable. For study-wide change in 
protocol conduct including but not limited to implementing remote visits and IP home delivery, protocol 
amendment should be submitted to IRB for approval. 
In addition, trial participants should be made aware of 
and in agreement with the changes. [Class I, level C]
