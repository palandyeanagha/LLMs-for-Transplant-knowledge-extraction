ABSTRACT Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are
the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. Complete resection is the only
potentially curative treatment, although recurrence is
common, occurring in approximately 40–50% of patients.
The introduction of effective molecularly targeted therapies for GISTs has dramatically changed the clinical
management paradigms for, and prognosis of, patients with
intermediate- and high-risk GISTs, as well as those with
locally advanced and metastatic disease. In this article, we
review landmark studies that evaluated the use and efficacy
of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and sunitinib in
the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings for resectable primary and limited resectable metastatic GISTs.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most
common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract,
developing most commonly in the stomach and small
intestine as a result of activating mutations in KIT or
PDGFRA, genes encoding receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Over the past 2 decades, remarkable advances have
been made in our understanding of GISTs and the development of molecular-targeted therapies, and tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib and sunitinib
have dramatically changed the management and prognosis
of patients with this malignancy. Although surgery is the
treatment of choice and the only curative treatment for
resectable GISTs, recurrence is common, particularly in
patients with intermediate- and high-risk GISTs as defined
by Miettinen and Lasota.1 On the heels of landmark clinical trials demonstrating remarkable response of imatinib
and sunitinib in patients with advanced unresectable and
metastatic GIST,2–4 there arose great interest in evaluating
the safety and efficacy of using TKI therapy in the adjuvant
and neoadjuvant settings for patients with resectable intermediate- and high-risk, locally advanced, or limited
resectable metastatic disease. The landmark studies evaluating the use of imatinib for perioperative therapy in
resectable GISTs are reviewed below.
ADJUVANT THERAPY
The success of imatinib in the treatment of advanced
unresectable and metastatic GIST2–4 led to great interest in
using the drug in the adjuvant setting following primary
tumor resection to prevent or delay recurrence and prolong
survival. The role of imatinib in the adjuvant setting has
been evaluated in several phase II and III clinical trials, as
summarized below (Table 1).
ACOSOG Z9000
Purpose and Study Design
The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group
(ACOSOG) performed the first trials of imatinib in the
adjuvant setting. ACOSOG Z90005 was a multicenter,
single-arm, phase II study that enrolled 106 patients
between September 2001 and September 2003, from 48
institutions, who underwent macroscopically complete
resection of high-risk KIT-positive GISTs, defined as
tumors C 10 cm, those with intraperitoneal tumor rupture,

or those with up to four peritoneal implants. Patients
received adjuvant imatinib (400 mg/day) for 1 year and
were imaged by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging every 5 months for the first 2 years then
every 6 months for the following 3 years. The primary
endpoint was to compare overall survival (OS) with that of
historical controls, which was estimated to be 35% with
surgery alone.
Results
Overall, in this single-arm study, adjuvant imatinib was
well tolerated and safe, with 83% of patients completing
the prescribed year of therapy and 69% receiving the prescribed dose of 400 mg/day. The results of this study
showed that postoperative imatinib for 1 year prolonged
recurrence-free survival (RFS) after complete GIST
resection and was also associated with improved OS
compared with historic controls (3-year OS 97%, 5-year
OS 83% vs. historic 5-year OS 35%). As expected, tumor
mitotic rate, tumor location, and mutation status were
associated with RFS on univariate analyses.
Implications for Practice
ACOSOG Z9000/Z9001 showed that adjuvant imatinib
for 1 year following macroscopically complete resection of
primary GISTs was safe and well tolerated and improved
RFS compared with placebo. Based on the results of
ACOSOG Z9001, in December 2008 the US FDA
approved imatinib for the postoperative treatment of adult
patients after resection of KIT-positive GISTs. However, as
many patients in both Z9000 and Z9001 recurred upon
completion of therapy, the results of these studies suggested that adjuvant imatinib delays rather than prevents
disease recurrence and that longer duration of adjuvant
therapy may further improve RFS.
ACOSOG Z9001
Purpose and Study Design
ACOSOG Z9001
6,7 was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, phase III trial of adjuvant imatinib for
1 year in patients who underwent complete gross resection
of primary KIT-positive GISTsC 3 cm (Fig.1). Patients
from 230 institutions were randomized to receive either
adjuvant imatinib (n = 359) or placebo (n = 354); crossover was allowed in the event of tumor recurrence.
Although the original primary endpoint was OS, 6 months
prior to the first planned efficacy interim analysis the primary endpoint was changed to RFS when it became clear

that the event (death) rate would be significantly lower than
the event rate specified in the original statistical design
because of the efficacy of imatinib and the crossover trial
design that allowed patients who progressed on placebo to
receive imatinib.
Results
Median follow-up was 19.7 months (0–56.4), during
which 30 (8%) patients in the imatinib group and 70 (20%)
in the placebo group developed tumor recurrence or died.
Adjuvant imatinib was associated with significantly
improved RFS compared with placebo (98% vs. 83%) at
1 year and was well tolerated. No difference in OS was
noted; however, this was not unexpected given the crossover design. Of note, patients who recurred generally did
so shortly after completion of 1 year of adjuvant therapy.
The slope of the RFS curve for the patients in the imatinib
arm was similar to that of the placebo arm, but offset by
approximately 18 months. Additionally, Z9001 enrolled
many patients considered to be at low risk of recurrence, as
subsequently defined by Miettinen and Lasota, as the risk
categories were not well understood at the start of the trial.1
SCANDINAVIAN/GERMAN SSG XVIII/AIO
Purpose and Study Design
The Scandinavian/German SSG XVIII/AIO trial8–12 was
a randomized, open-label trial of 1 versus 3 years of
postoperative imatinib (400 mg/day) after complete gross
resection of high-risk KIT-positive GISTs following complete macroscopic resection (Fig. 2). High-risk GIST was
defined as tumors with at least one of the following: tumor
diameter [ 10 cm, mitotic count [ 10/50 high-power
fields (HPF), tumor diameter [5 cm and mitotic
count [5/50 HPFs, or tumor rupture before or at the time
of surgical resection. A total of 400 patients from 24 hospitals were enrolled between 4 February 2004 and 29
September 2008.

Results
Results after 10 years of follow-up were recently presented.12 Median follow-up was 119 months. Compared
with patients randomized to receive 1 year of adjuvant
imatinib, those randomized to receive 3 years of adjuvant
imatinib were observed to have improved 5-year/10-year
RFS (71/53% vs. 53/42%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.87; p = 0.003) and 5-year/
10-year OS (92/79% vs. 86/65%; HR 0.55, 95% CI
0.37–0.83; p = 0.04).
Implications for Practice
This study established a new standard for treating
patients after resection of high-risk GISTs with adjuvant
imatinib for 3 years. The long-term data confirmed
sustained OS benefit in the 3-year adjuvant imatinib arm.
Of note, this study did include patients with GISTs now
understood to be less sensitive to imatinib at 400 mg/day
dosing (KIT exon 9 mutation), as well as those likely to be
primarily resistant to imatinib (wild-type, PDGFRA
D842V), with similar numbers in each trial arm.

was originally OS but was modified in 2009 to imatinib
failure-free survival (IFFS), defined as time to death or
starting a TKI other than imatinib, as an endpoint sensitive
to secondary resistance to imatinib. Of 908 patients who
were enrolled from 112 hospitals between December 2004
and October 2008, 835 patients were eligible, with 418
randomized to the observation arm and 417 randomized to
the adjuvant imatinib arm.
Results
Median follow-up was 56.4 months. There was no significant difference in IFFS between study arms, with 402
patients remaining imatinib failure-free in the imatinib arm
and 391 patients remaining imatinib failure-free in the
observation arm (3-year IFFS 90.8% vs. 90.8%, 5-year
IFFS 87.0% vs. 84.1%; HR 0.79, 98.5% CI 0.5–1.25;
p = 0.21). RFS was significantly better among patients who
received adjuvant imatinib (3-year RFS 84.3% vs. 65.8%,
5-year RFS 69.4% vs. 62.9%; p\ 0.01). OS did not differ
between arms (3-year OS 96.8% vs. 96.3%, 5-year OS
91.8% vs. 92.7%).
Implications for Practice
This study again supported the role of adjuvant imatinib
in decreasing recurrence risk for patients with intermediate- and high-risk GISTs following complete macroscopic
resection. However, the broader implication is that there is
no difference in time to the start of second-line therapy
whether imatinib is administered as an adjuvant therapy
immediately after surgery or after recurrence.

PERSIST-514
Purpose and Study Design
As 3 years of adjuvant imatinib therapy was shown to be
associated with reduced recurrence rates and improved OS
in patients with high-risk primary GISTs compared with
those who received 1 year of therapy, the question arose as
to whether a longer duration of adjuvant imatinib beyond
3 years might improve outcomes further. PERSIST-5 is a
prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II study to
evaluate whether adjuvant treatment with imatinib
(400 mg/day) for 5 years is tolerable and efficacious. Eligible patients included those with a primary GIST of any
location C 2 cm with C 5 mitoses/50 HPFs, or primary
non-gastric GIST C 5 cm. Ninety-one patients from 21
institutions were enrolled, with data collected from 5
August 2009 through 20 December 2016. Primary and
secondary endpoints included 5-year RFS and OS,
respectively.
Results
Twenty-four (26%) patients had GISTs that were of
intermediate risk of recurrence based on the Miettinen and
Lasota classification,1 while 67 (74%) were of high risk.
Median duration of adjuvant imatinib treatment was
55.1 months (range 0.5–60.6), with 46 patients (51%)
completing 5 years of therapy. Forty-five patients (49%)
discontinued treatment before 5 years because of patient
choice (21%), adverse events (16%), or other reasons
(12%). No patient with imatinib-sensitive mutations had
disease recurrence while receiving therapy. Of the seven
patients who recurred, one recurred while receiving imatinib but had PDGFRA D842V mutation, and six recurred
after discontinuation of imatinib therapy.
Implications for Practice
Adjuvant therapy with imatinib for 5 years was
demonstrated to be safe and effective at controlling
recurrence rates in patients with imatinib-sensitive mutations. However, compliance with this adjuvant regimen
was challenging, with 49% of patients discontinuing therapy early. The results of the study emphasized the
importance of pretreatment assessment of GIST molecular
status as a driver of long-term benefit with adjuvant targeted therapy. It is unknown whether this longer 5-year
duration of adjuvant imatinib therapy is associated with
improved RFS and OS compared with 3-year adjuvant
therapy, although the results appear comparable with those
of EORTC 62024 and SSG XVIII/AIO. The results of this
single-arm exploratory study is the basis of a randomized
trial of 3-year versus 5-year adjuvant imatinib therapy
(NCT 02413736).
NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT
The remarkable responses to imatinib in many patients
with advanced unresectable and metastatic GISTs prompted
the question of whether a neoadjuvant imatinib treatment
approach might benefit patients in select clinical circumstances. Neoadjuvant therapy is an attractive treatment
strategy to downstage disease, allow definitive resection, and
improve local disease control in patients with locally
advanced and/or marginally resectable solid tumors across
histologies for whom upfront surgery may be technically
challenging, overly morbid, or not feasible. Current European (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO])
and US (National Comprehensive Cancer Network
[NCCN]) guidelines15,16 recommend consideration of preoperative imatinib and tumor mutational testing if surgical
morbidity could be reduced by downstaging the tumor preoperatively. This approach is particularly attractive and
indicated in cases when surgery may be technically challenging (rectum, duodenum, gastroesophageal junction) and
tumor downstaging may facilitate tumor resectability (converting from an open laparotomy to a minimally invasive
approach) or enable a less extensive/organ-sparing surgery,
and may improve surgical outcomes such as likelihood of
achieving a negative margin of resection and decreasing the
risk of tumor perforation/rupture. Preoperative therapy with
imatinib should be used until the maximum response is
obtained (usually 6–12 months from the beginning of
treatment) and before the development of secondary resistance to therapy. Response to therapy should be carefully
monitored by imaging studies. As accurate assessment of
recurrence risk cannot be made in patients who received
preoperative systemic therapy, adjuvant imatinib should be
used for at least 3 years following surgical resection. These
recommendations are based on a limited number of landmark phase II and collaborative retrospective studies
described below (Table 2).

Results
Most primary GISTS (n = 30) presented in the stomach
(52%), followed by the small bowel (20%), and median

SD and PR were observed in 91% and 4.5% of patients,
respectively. Estimated 2-year OS and PFS were 93.5% and
83.9%, respectively, for patients with primary GIST, and
90.9% and 77.3%, respectively, for patients with recurrent or
metastatic disease. Overall, neoadjuvant imatinib was well
tolerated, with rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 postoperative toxicities of 34%, 20.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. The 8- to
12-week delay in the time to surgery did not appear to have
any adverse effects on surgical outcomes.
Implications for Practice
Initial results of RTOG 0132/American College of
Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6665 were reported
in 2008 and demonstrated that preoperative imatinib for
8–12 weeks was safe and well tolerated. Although survival
outcomes at 2 years compared favorably with historical
single-institution surgical series for patients with intermediate- to high-risk GISTs, it was unclear whether the
apparent survival benefits seen in this study could be
attributed to the use of imatinib preoperatively, or due to the
2 years of postoperative imatinib therapy. Follow-up results
of this study were reported in 2012 and were notable for a
significant drop in PFS and OS after 2 years when adjuvant
imatinib was discontinued, supporting the need for longer
durations of imatinib treatment in patients at intermediateand high-risk of GIST recurrence following resection.
MD ANDERSON, MCAULIFFE ET AL.19
Purpose and Study Design
The group at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center (McAuliffe et al.19) performed a prospective, single-institution study to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of preoperative imatinib (600 mg/day) in 19
patients with KIT-positive resectable GISTs (C 1 cm).
Patients were randomized to receive imatinib for 3, 5, or
7 days preoperatively (n = 7, 6, and 6, respectively), with
the last dose administered the morning of surgery. Preoperative tumor response to imatinib was assessed
radiographically by dynamic CT (dCT) and 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDGPET), as well as histologically. Imatinib was resumed
postoperatively for 2 years.
Results
This study provided evidence that radiographic response
to preoperative imatinib can be observed and assessed as
early as within 1 week of initiation of therapy. Most
patients in this study responded to preoperative imatinib as
assessed by 18FDG-PET and dCT (69% and 71%, respectively). Similar to the results of RTOG 0132/ACRIN 6665,
preoperative imatinib was well tolerated and safe. The
observed 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 87%, with
a median DFS of 46 months. Survival benefit of preoperative imatinib could not be determined as all patients
received imatinib postoperatively for 2 years.
Implications for Practice
Although a small study (n = 19), this single-institution,
phase II trial demonstrated that preoperative imatinib was
safe, and additionally showed that tumor metabolic
response to TKI therapy occurs and can also be assessed
within 1 week of treatment by 18FDG-PET.
EORTC STBSG20
Purpose and Study Design
The EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group
(STBSG) performed a retrospective study to assess the
long-term results of preoperative imatinib therapy in 161
consecutive patients with primary KIT-positive GISTs
treated with preoperative imatinib between 2002 and 2011
at 10 sarcoma centers of the EORTC-STBSG. This remains
the largest study to date of neoadjuvant imatinib therapy.
Preoperative imatinib was continued until either maximal
response, defined as two consecutive CT scans not showing
further tumor regression, or if the surgeon deemed that
resection was possible, whichever was achieved first.
Results
Median follow-up was 46 months. Tumors were located
in the stomach (55.3%), rectum (20.5%), duodenum
Systemic Therapy for Resectable GISTs 3667

(9.9%), ileum/jejunum (9.3%), esophagus (3.1%), and
other locations (1.9%). The median time of preoperative
imatinib therapy in this study was 40 weeks (range 6–190);
129 patients (80.1%) had documented response to preoperative therapy and 30 patients (18.6%) had documented
stabilization of disease prior to surgery. The median
duration of adjuvant imatinib therapy was 19 months
(range 12–76). This study reported excellent safety data
and long-term results, with a 5-year DFS and OS of 65%
and 87%, respectively.
Implications for Practice
The number of PRs was higher in this large retrospective
series compared with that observed in the RTOG
0132-ACRIN 6665 trial, likely related to the longer duration of preoperative imatinib therapy and thus supporting
the recommendation that preoperative imatinib therapy be
continued until maximal tumor response is achieved. Survival benefit of preoperative imatinib could not be
determined as all patients received imatinib
postoperatively.
COMBINATION OF TARGETED THERAPY
AND METASTASECTOMY
Cytoreductive surgery for recurrent or metastatic GISTs
may be considered in select circumstances, including in
patients presenting with oncologic emergencies such as
hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, or obstruction, as well
as in patients whose disease is stable or responsive to TKI
therapy and when complete gross resection is possible and
in patients with limited disease progression.16
In the pre-imatinib era, surgical resection of recurrent and
metastatic GISTs was associated with improved survival if
complete gross resection could be achieved.21 However,
complete resection was often difficult to achieve due to the
multifocal nature of recurrent and metastatic GISTs. In the
post-imatinib era, TKI therapy is the standard first-line
treatment for patients with metastatic, recurrent, and/or
inoperable GISTs. Although maximal response to imatinib is
typically achieved within 6–18 months of treatment,22
complete remissions are rare and median time to recurrence/
progression on imatinib is within 2 years.23,24 Thus,
cytoreductive surgery to resect residual disease became an
attractive approach to investigate. Although prospective
randomized trials did not prove feasible, a number of retrospective series of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
GISTs treated surgically after treatment with imatinib and/or
sunitinib therapy have been published supporting the role of
surgery for residual metastatic disease in patients with
GISTs responding to imatinib (Table 3).24–42
CHICTR-TRC-0000024434
Purpose and Study Design
Two clinical trials (NCT00956072 in Europe, ChiCTRTRC-00000244 in China) were attempted to address the
question of whether patients with metastatic GISTs
receiving imatinib would benefit further from surgical
resection of residual disease. Both studies were closed
early due to poor accrual, although ChiCTR-TRC00000244 reported data on 41 of 210 planned patients. In
ChiCTR-TRC-00000244, patients were treated with imatinib (400 mg/day) and those responding to therapy were
randomized to either surgery for resection of residual disease with resumption of imatinib postoperatively (n = 19)
or imatinib therapy alone (n = 22). All patients continued
imatinib until disease progression
Results
Patients in the surgery arm underwent surgery
3–12 months after initiating imatinib therapy, with 15
patients achieving PR and 7 patients achieving SD at the
time of randomization. Of those in the imatinib-alone arm,
9 achieved PR and 10 achieved SD at the time of randomization. Two-year PFS was 88.4% in the surgery arm
versus 57.7% in the imatinib-alone arm, with a median
follow-up of 23 months (p = 0.089). Median OS was not
reached in the surgery arm, and was 49 months in the
imatinib-alone arm (p = 0.024).
Implications for Practice
Although there was some suggestion of improved PFS
with surgery compared with imatinib therapy alone, the
difference was not statistically significant. It is possible that
surgery may prolong survival in carefully selected patients,
although this decision should be made at expert centers and
following multidisciplinary discussion.
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES EXAMINING DISEASE
CONTROL AFTER RESECTION IN SELECTED
PATIENTS WITH LIMITED METASTATIC
DISEASE AFTER IMATINIB TREATMENT
Despite the lack of prospective, randomized controlled
trials, the conclusions of multiple available retrospective
series have overall been consistent. Although complete
excision of residual metastatic lesions is associated with
improved prognosis in these retrospective series,24–40 outcomes are consistently dependent on preoperative
responses to imatinib, and it has not been prospectively

demonstrated that the survival benefit associated with
surgical resection of residual metastatic disease is due to
surgery itself or to patient selection.
Currently available data do not support a clinical benefit
of surgery for patients with generalized disease progression
on TKI therapy.25,38,42 Raut et al. reported that 1-year PFS
following surgical resection was 80%, 33% and 0% in
patients with advanced GIST who achieved SD, limited
progression, and generalized progression, respectively,
with imatinib therapy preoperatively.25 Similarly, Rutkowski et al. found that patients who achieved PR or SD
had significantly longer PFS and OS following surgical
resection when compared with patients with progressive
disease. The role of surgery in patients with advanced
GISTs with focally progressive disease on imatinib, as well
as those on lines of systemic therapy beyond imatinib, is
limited23,36 and should be individualized and considered in
an expert and multidisciplinary setting.
CONCLUSION
The development of TKIs has dramatically altered the
management landscape and improved outcomes of patients
with GISTs. Initially limited to use in the metastatic setting, TKIs have since been shown to have utility both in the
neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The rationale use of
TKI therapy in the metastatic, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant
settings requires knowledge of GIST mutational status,
obtained through tumor biopsies prior to initiation of systemic therapy. Although imatinib and subsequent
generations of TKIs have to date primarily benefitted
patients with GISTs harboring common KIT mutations,
avapritinib, the most recent TKI to receive FDA approval,
demonstrates efficacy in patients with GISTs harboring the
PGDFR D842V mutation. Future work will likely evaluate
novel therapies, including avapritinib in combination with
surgical management, for growing subsets of patients with
GIST.
