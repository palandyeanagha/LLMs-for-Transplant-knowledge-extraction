Summary
Background Management of benign liver tumours
(BLT) is still object of discussion. Uncertainty still
exists about patient selection, details of management,
indications for surgical intervention and potential
surgery-related complications. The up-to-date strategies for management of the most common benign
solid tumours are recapitulated in this article. In addition, recommendations concerning practical issues
are presented.
Methods Available data from peer-reviewed publications associated with the major controversies concerning treatment strategies of solid BLT were selected
through a PubMed literature search.
Results Non-randomized controlled trials, retrospective series and case reports dominate the literature.
Conservative management in BLT is associated with
low overall morbidity and mortality when applied in
an appropriate patient population. Surgical intervention is indicated solely in the presence of progressive symptoms and suspicion of a malignant change.
Linking abdominal symptoms to BLT should be interpreted with caution. No evidence is recorded for
malignant transformation in haemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), while a subgroup of
hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is associated with maM. Fodor · F. Primavesi · E. Braunwarth · B. Cardini ·

answers in the literature.

a worldwide trend, but the available literature does
not provide high-grade evidence for this strategy.
Consequently, further prospective investigations on
the unclear aspects are required. Hence, this article summarises practical highlights of therapeutic

Introduction
The finding of benign liver tumours (BLT) has markedly
increased because of recent technical advances in
abdominal imaging modalities [1]. Autopsy series
reported incidences of up to 50%. BLT are classified
into solid and cystic tumours according to features
on radiographic imaging. Table 1 gives an overview
of benign hepatobiliary lesions. The most common
solid BLT are haemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA),
whereas simple cysts represent the most common
non-solid lesions [2]. Other incidental imaging findings include atypical cysts, focal fatty sparing and

Table 1 Common benign liver tumours

Cystic lesions Hepatic cyst, hepatobiliary cystadenoma
hepatic cystadenoma [3]. In the past years, surgery
was advocated for these findings, in view of their uncertain clinical behaviour. In malignant hepatobiliary
lesions, liver resection has become widely accepted
as the only potentially curative treatment. However,
with improvements in imaging, better understanding
of causes and histology of BLTs, surveillance has become a valid alternative in most patients. With the
increasing discovery of BLT, clinicians are increasingly
faced with the need to make therapeutic decisions regarding the management of these tumours [2]. Before
1980, liver resection was associated with mortality
rates above 10%. However, in the past decade, overall
mortality has decreased to 5% in high-volume centres
because of better knowledge of liver anatomy, refinements in surgical techniques and advances achieved
in post-operative care [4]. As a consequence, an increasing number of patients with benign lesions are
nowadays considered for surgical treatment [5]. Despite the low mortality and morbidity rate after partial
liver resection of less than 2% for metastatic disease,
there is still discussion regarding the indications for
surgical liver resection of benign hepatobiliary lesions
[6]. For BLT such as haemangioma, FNH and HCA,
surgery may be indicated solely on the presence of
progressive symptoms and suspicion of a malignant
change [3]. Although malignant transformation of
BLT is an uncommon phenomenon, it can occur [7].
In particular, patients with multiple large adenomas
have a greater chance for malignant transformation
[8]. Many patients present with non-specific abdominal pain in the setting of BLT; nevertheless, combining
these symptoms with the tumours is challenging and
controversial. The overall indication and utilization of
surgery may be subjective and variable. Additionally,
increased use of minimally invasive surgical (MIS)
approaches may impact the relative use of surgery
for BLT [2]. When a patient is considered for surgery,
complete information about risks and alternative
treatment options should be discussed. Subjective
symptoms and impact on daily life are just as important as the outcome data of surgery [9]. Kim et al.
demonstrated that the volume of operative procedures for BLT has increased significantly over the past
decade [2]. Mezhir et al. identified patients with BLT
from an institutional database. A significant increase
in the number of BLTs diagnosed over time and a trend
toward observation were observed. During the time
covered by this study, the percentage of patients who
were taken for immediate resection declined in more
recent years. The findings suggest that most patients
with a BLT can remain subjected to observation with
low risk for misdiagnosis, complications or malignant
transformation [3]. This article summarises practical
highlights and therapeutic management of the most
common solid tumours.
Methods
Available data from peer-reviewed publications associated with this topic were selected through a PubMed
literature search. Articles were selected using the indexing terms “benign liver tumours”, “liver neoplasm
surgery”, “focal nodular hyperplasia”, “liver haemangioma”, “hepatocellular adenoma”. Only larger series
with more than 30 patients with benign lesions were
included. Due to lack of data, meta-analysis including descriptive statistics was not possible. The current
literature concerning this topic was summarised.
Results
Haemangioma
Liver haemangiomas are common incidental findings, reflecting a high prevalence within the common
population ranging from 1 to 20% [7]. Originating
from the mesodermal layer, these lesions represent
a congenital non-neoplastic hamartomatous proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. Macroscopically,
these tumours are well-circumscribed hypervascular
lesions with good compressibility; hence, no classical
evidence for malignant potential is given. The majority of haemangiomas are of the cavernous type,
representing the most common BLT. These lesions
have been reported in up to 7% in autopsy studies
[10]. Unlike the less common capillary-type haemangiomas, which are generally smaller in size, multiple
and most commonly asymptomatic cavernous haemangiomas can grow to a large size and may become
symptomatic. Giant haemangiomas are defined as
those measuring ≥5 cm, while hypergiant hepatic haemangiomas are defined as those which are larger than
10 cm in size [11]. These lesions are more frequent
in women (female:male ratio = 5:1), with a mean age
at diagnosis of 50 years [12]. The certainty of diagnosis sustained by high-quality non-invasive imaging
represents still an important step. Transabdominal
ultrasound (US) is diagnostic in approximately two
thirds of cases [13]. However, axial imaging may be
undertaken and is crucial prior to therapy. Haemangiomas tend to be hypodense on native computed
tomography and show centripetal contrast uptake.
These characteristics are of important value in differentiating haemangiomas from metastases [14].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be of
importance in difficult cases. As shown in Fig. 1,
typical features include high signal intensity on T2-
weighted series and discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement. Diagnostic biopsy to differentiate
giant haemangiomas from malignant lesions should
in general be discouraged. On the one hand there is

late phase
a reported risk of haemorrhage of up to 0.28% [15],
on the other hand the risk of needle track seeding
and intra-abdominal dissemination of a potentially
curable malignancy is of clinical importance [10].
Cavernous haemangiomas occur more frequently in
the right liver, an association with oral contraceptives
(OCPs) still remains controversial [10]. Current evidence reveals an uncomplicated natural history of
these lesions.
Linking abdominal symptoms to liver haemangiomas should be interpreted with caution. Eventual symptoms unrelated to an incidentally detected
haemangioma should be clarified and alternative
causes excluded (e. g. gallstones, gastroduodenitis,
orthopaedic affection). Patients with large lesions
may present abdominal pain, due to tension of Glisson’s capsule, compression of local structures, intralesional thrombosis and infarction or haemorrhage.
The risk of haemorrhage seems to be less than 1% [16]
and for decision making probably negligible. A group
of 437 patients from a single institution were analysed
with regard to a diagnostic algorithm, the indications
for surgery and observation in BLT. Observation of patients with haemangiomas for a median of 32 months
revealed that these vascular lesions remain stable
in size without risk of malignant transformation [6].
Despite reaching large dimensions, spontaneous rupture of a giant haemangioma is exceptional. Fewer
than 50 cases of spontaneous rupture have been
reported in the literature [17]. Traumatic rupture is
a recognised complication, but only a handful of cases
have been described [18]. Kasabach–Merrit syndrome
causes thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy in association with large haemangiomas.
Platelet trapping in the haemangioma is thought to result in activation of platelets and the clotting cascade,
resulting in consumptive coagulopathy [19]. However,
the optimal approach and the indication for resection of haemangiomas remain controversial. Today,
surgery is the most effective therapeutic strategy for
the definitive treatment of liver haemangiomas [10].
Indications for surgical interventions are suspected
malignant transformation or misdiagnosis, symptoms correlating with a growing abdominal mass and
consecutive complications, such as haemorrhage, infarction, rupture or Kasabach–Merritt syndrome [20].
Additionally, full blood tests should be performed.
Abnormalities may indicate haemorrhage, infarction,
neoplasia or other causes, but in most cases, liver
biochemistry is normal [10].
Considering a benign and uncomplicated natural
history for the majority of haemangiomas, non-operative management might be the right approach for
the majority of patients. The risk of potential complications should be carefully weighed against operative
risks. Surgery should therefore be reserved as salvage treatment after exclusion of other causes and
open discussion with the patient [10]. Alternatively,
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with the antineoplastic antibiotic bleomycin has been used as
a sclerosing agent in the treatment of vascular malformation and haemangiomas. One study suggested
that bleomycin, a cytotoxic agent, may inhibit haemangioma growth by inhibiting neovascularization
[21], but using a chemotherapeutic agent for a benign
disease is at least worth a proper multidisciplinary
discussion. Transarterial embolisation with polyvinyl
particles is also described in a small series [22], but
the success rate seems rather questionable as other
studies reported no positive effect. The static nature
of giant haemangiomas makes further follow-up unnecessary [23]. Pregnancy does not pose a higher
risk, although single cases with complicated courses
are published. Furthermore, enlargement during
pregnancy is suggested to be caused by hormonal
influence [24]. Due to lack of evidence, individual
treatment is mainly used in these cases. Surgery still
remains a possible option in symptomatic and growing lesions. OCPs and other oestrogen-containing
preparations can be further administered, but close
controls at 6 and 12 months are recommended [6].
Patients with abdominal compressive symptoms may
be more likely to derive benefit from surgery than
patients with unspecific abdominal discomfort. HowK Indications for liver surgery in benign tumours 127

main topic
Fig. 2 FNH: axial MRI in the late arterial phase (a) with
Primovist® (Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) shows
a large, slightly hyperintense lesion (arrow), with a hypodense
centre, in the right liver, consistent with a central scar (arrowhead) [9]. The hepatobiliary phase (b) images show a strong
uptake of Primovist, which is a typical sign of FNH
ever, symptoms persist in 25% of patients following
resection on haemangiomas and therefore a clear
communication with the patients is essential.
Focal nodular hyperplasia
FNH is a non-malignant hepatic tumour without vascular origin, often diagnosed incidentally on radiologic imaging. Autopsy series reported that 8% of
non-haemangiomatous lesions were FNH, representing 66% of all benign non-haemangiomatous lesions
[25]. FNH occurs mostly solitary (80–95%) and is usually less than 5 cm in diameter. It is seen throughout
all age spectra but mainly in women (female:male ratio = 9:1) [26]. FNH has various synonyms: solitary
hyperplastic nodule, hepatic hamartoma, focal cirrhosis, hamartomatous cholangiohepatoma and hepatic pseudotumor. Previously FNH was considered
to be either a hamartoma, a neoplasm, a response
to ischemia or injury, or a focal area of regeneration.
Nowadays it is generally described as a hyperplastic,
regenerative response to hyperperfusion with characteristic anomalous arteries found in the centre of these
nodules [26, 27]. Main characteristics are sharp margins, nodular architecture, abnormal vessels, proliferation of bile ducts and a central stellate scar which is
found in about 50% of cases [28]. Non-classical forms
of FNH lack either the typical nodular architecture or
vascular malformations, but always present bile ductular proliferation. FNH might also be associated with
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, hepatic haemangiomas, and other vascular malformations [25]. It
has no malignant potential and is rarely symptomatic.
As shown in Fig. 2, the radiological diagnosis of
FNH is often made on the basis of the detection of
a central scar. However, this finding might be missing
in half of the patients. On the other hand, a central
scar may also be found in patients with fibrolamellar
hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This limitation applies
to all cross-sectional imaging studies. In angiography,
the characteristic stellate appearance is demonstrated
in only 33% of patients; moreover, FNH may even be
avascular in 10% of cases. Therefore, the diagnosis
of FNH is sometimes only achieved by use of several complementary imaging techniques. In patients
with unclear diagnosis, a biopsy or surgical resection
may be needed to achieve complete pathohistological
workup. Laboratory tests are most often normal and
therefore not helpful in the diagnosis. Clinical symptoms directly attributable to FNH are infrequent and
therefore difficult to link to the tumour. Acute haemorrhage, necrosis or infarction are extremely rare [29].
Thus, FNH should be managed similarly to haemangiomas, with very strict indications for surgery.
The natural history of FNH is uneventful, lacking complications and changes over time. However,
enlargement in the setting of OCPs and during pregnancy have been reported [30]. To date, there is no
evidence for malignant transformation of FNH [28,
31–33]. According to the majority of reports and the
authors experiences, patients with FNH should be
managed conservatively [6, 31, 34, 35]. Follow-up
controls at 6 months should be sufficient to prove
the stability of the lesion and its benign nature, after
which no long-term follow-up is routinely required.
Surgery should be only considered for symptomatic
FNH lesions, or highly suspicious lesions where malignancy cannot be ruled out with modern imaging or
even biopsy. Numerous reports regarding FNH during
pregnancy have been published, making an association with endogenous and/or exogenous oestrogens
very likely. As for haemangiomas, close controls at 6
and 12 months are recommended. Small lesions do
not appear to pose a significant risk to a successful
pregnancy, although observation is strongly recommended and resection may be prudent for large
(>8 cm) FNH lesions [6]. Liver-directed therapies are
only reported in small series, hence no evidencebased recommendation can be made and surgery
remains the preferred therapy if properly indicated.
Hepatocellular adenoma
HCA is a rare, solid and benign liver tumour of presumable epithelial origin. The estimated prevalence is

main topic
Fig. 3 HCA: axial venous
phase MRI with Primovist®
(Bayer Schering Pharma,
Berlin, Germany) shows an
only slightly hyperintense
lesion (arrow) in the centre
of the liver (a) with a marked
capsule. In the hepatobiliary phase no uptake
of contrast agent is seen
within the lesion (arrow),
which is further consistent
with HCA (b) [9]
about 0.004%. These lesions occur mostly in women
of childbearing age and seem strongly associated with
the use of OCPs and oestrogens [36]. Women older
than 30 years taking OCPs for longer than 5 years have
the highest risk levels. A causal role for hormone activity in HCA growth is suggested by data linking adenoma regression to the cessation of OCP use and, vice
versa, growth associated with pregnancy [37]. Hepatic adenomas appear as single or multiple lesions
and may occasionally reach a size larger than 20 cm.
Hepatic adenomatosis is an equally uncommon condition in which >10 nodules develop in the absence of
classical risk factors such as OCPs. There is a strong
association seen with glycogen storage disease. As
shown in Fig. 3, HCA is usually detected by imaging, typically US or multi-phase contrast-enhanced
imaging studies such as CT or MRI scans. The significance of making a specific diagnosis is that, unlike
haemangioma and FNH, HCA has a small but meaningful risk of progressing into malignancy. Although
imaging provides supportive information, a definitive
diagnosis of hepatic adenoma requires biopsy of the
tissue [38]. The introduction of a new classification
system for HCA helps clinicians in tailoring the treatment. Patients are stratified according to imaging criteria, expression profile of associated immunohistochemical markers or molecular findings. This classification includes hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α-inactivated HCA (H-HCA 30–35%), β-catenin-mutated HCA
(b-HCA 10–15%), inflammatory HCA (I-HCA 50%) and
a subgroup of unclassified cases (less than 10%) [39].
The b-HCA group appears to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma [38].
Historically, HCAs were treated with a watch and
wait policy and the unselective recommendation to
avoid OCPs. Surgical intervention was preferred for
larger lesions—the “5 cm rule”—due to an expected
higher risk of malignant transformation. However,
current management options may also include minimally invasive techniques like radiofrenquency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial embolisation
(TAE). New molecular insights have shown that b-HCA
and I-HCA are prone to malignant degeneration especially if the size reaches >5 cm. In these instances,
invasive treatment is recommended [38]. According
to van Bieze et al., the risk of haemorrhage in HCA is
the highest among BLTs. Risk factors for bleeding of
HCA include a diameter of 35mm or more, visualisation of lesional arteries, location in the left lateral liver
and exophytic growth [40]. Women with HCA who
are pregnant should be closely monitored for HCA
size due to the tendency of the lesion to grow [37].
Treatment of HCA during pregnancy may be indicated
when the lesion shows signs of growth or bleeding.
Whether some subtypes are more prone to complications during pregnancy is not known, mainly because the majority are diagnosed non-invasively. The
choice of the right management, i.e. surgery, RFA,
TAE or follow-up in pregnancy is often a matter of debate. Surgery of lesions located at the periphery of the
liver can be performed safely within the first or second trimester and will probably be indicated by the
size and location of the lesion. Given the increased
risk of haemorrhage in larger HCAs, a pre-emptive
treatment strategy before pregnancy is recommended
[41]. If HCA is discovered during pregnancy, the second trimester would be the optimal moment for invasive treatment, as anaesthesia is well tolerated at this
stage and the foetus is not grown enough to interfere
with liver surgery.
One of the major discussions involves the clinical application of the molecular subclassification in
the diagnosis and treatment of adenomas, balancing the risk of an invasive liver biopsy with benefits of an individualised therapy. When a lesion is
>5 cm, OCPs should be stopped and MRI performed
after 6 months. If the lesion has decreased to <5 cm,
definitive signs of an H-HCA should be ruled out.
If H-HCA is subsequently identified, therapy can be
less aggressive because the risk of malignant progression is very low. Follow-up should be performed, initially every 6 months, and if the lesion shows no further alteration, follow-up can be stopped or repeated
yearly until menopause [42]. For small lesions (<5 cm)
categorised as I-HCA, management should not differ. However, a biopsy to exclude β-catenin mutation
needs to be discussed as there is no reliable imaging
characteristic to diagnose b-HCA non-invasively. For
larger lesions (>5 cm) with a β-catenin mutation and
additional risk factors such as male sex, steroid use,
glycogen storage disease or underlying viral hepatitis,
treatment is clearly recommended. Mainstay of treatK Indications for liver surgery in benign tumours 129

main topic
ment is liver resection and complete pathohistological
workup; in selected cases, RFA or TAE may be used.
For hepatic adenomatosis, orthotopic liver transplantation is a valid option [43]. We strongly advocate
multidisciplinary discussion of all cases in specialised
teams to create the best individual management plan,
especially in childbearing females.
Conclusion
Most patients with a BLT can be observed with a low
risk of misdiagnosis, complications or malignant
transformation. In the past years, a trend towards
conservative management could be observed [3].
Patients indicated for resection include those with
symptomatic tumours or lesions in which malignancy
cannot be excluded. The management for adenomas
is based primarily on imaging criteria, expression
of associated immunohistochemical markers and
molecular findings. Special attention is advocated for
the b-HCA subtype with increased risk of malignant
transformation.
The risk of potential complications and the severity
of symptoms need to be weighed against surgical risk.
Minor liver resection for the treatment of a wide range
of BLT is associated with low morbidity (9%) and virtually no mortality in centres with a high volume of
patients. The presence of comorbidity, prolonged surgical time and incomplete resections are associated
with major morbidity. Besides parenchymal-sparing
approaches with close margins, laparoscopic resections provide a benefit in terms of pain reduction and
comfort, especially in the long term [44]. For all three
kinds of lesions, if follow-up controls are indicated, 3
and 6 months should be sufficient to prove the stability of the lesion and its benign nature, after which no
long-term follow-up is routinely required.
