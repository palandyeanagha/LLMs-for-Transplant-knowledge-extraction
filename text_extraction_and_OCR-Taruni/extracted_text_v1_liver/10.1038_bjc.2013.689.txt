Background: A few studies indicated that hepatitis C and hepatitis B virus (HCV/HBV) might be associated with pancreatic cancer
risk. The aim of this nationwide cohort study was to examine this possible association.
Methods: Hepatitis C virus- and hepatitis B virus-infected individuals were identified from the national surveillance database
from 1990 to 2006, and followed to the end of 2008. The pancreatic cancer risk in the study population was compared with the
general population by calculation of Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs), and with a matched reference population using a
Cox proportional hazards regression model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs).
Results: In total 340 819 person-years in the HCV cohort and 102 295 in the HBV cohort were accumulated, with 34 and 5
pancreatic cancers identified, respectively. The SIRHCV was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.4, 2.9) and the SIRHBV was 1.4
(0.5, 3.3). In the Cox model analysis, the HR for HCV infection was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.7), diminishing to 1.6 (1.04, 2.4) after
adjustment for potential confounders.
Conclusion: Our results indicated that HCV infection might be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer but further
studies are needed to verify such association. The results in the HBV cohort indicated an excess risk, however, without statistical
significance due to lack of power.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most rapidly fatal malignancies with
a 5-year survival rate below 5%. The long-term survival is poor also
for early diagnosed patients treated with resection surgery (Jemal
et al, 2010). In Europe, it was estimated in a prediction model that
in the year 2012 there would be 75 000–80 000 deaths from
pancreatic cancer, which is the fourth most common cause of
cancer-associated death for both men and women (Malvezzi et al,
2012). The incidence of pancreatic cancer is higher in the Nordic
countries and Central Europe than in other parts of the world
(Bosetti et al, 2012).
Tobacco smoking is a well-established risk factor for pancreatic
cancer (Iodice et al, 2008), and a similar magnitude of excess risk
as smoking was found among the users of Scandinavian snus
(moist snuff) (Boffetta et al, 2005; Luo et al, 2007). Besides,
accumulating evidence consistently shows that old age, male sex,
diabetes mellitus, hereditary pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and
family history are positively associated with this carcinoma
(Pandol et al, 2012). Albeit the biological mechanism is unclear,
recent epidemiological studies indicated that some infections, such
as exposure to Helicobacter pylori (Trikudanathan et al, 2011),
poor oral health (Michaud et al, 2007), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
(Hassan et al, 2008; El-Serag et al, 2009) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)
(Hassan et al, 2008; Iloeje et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2012a,b) might be
associated with pancreatic cancer risk.
Globally, B170 million people are chronically infected with
HCV (World Health Organization, 1997) and an estimated 350

million with HBV (Custer et al, 2004). The prevalence rates of
HCV and HBV infection vary widely in the world, and Sweden is a
low endemic country with an estimated 0.5% of the population
infected with HCV (Duberg et al, 2008a) and even lower rate for
HBV infection. Both chronic HCV and HBV infections are main
causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous findings
demonstrated that HBV may replicate within the pancreas
(Shimoda et al, 1981; Yoshimura et al, 1981) and that HCV could
be associated with pancreatitis (Alvares-Da-Silva et al, 2000;
Torbenson et al, 2007). Some studies support that HCV and HBV
may have a role in the development of pancreatic cancer, but the
evidence is far from conclusive (Hassan et al, 2008; El-Serag et al,
2009; Iloeje et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2012a,b), and more studies are
needed. Towards this end, we utilised Swedish population-based
nationwide registers, with documentation of all diagnosed HCVand HBV-infected individuals in Sweden, to explore the association
of HCV or HBV infection and the risk of pancreatic cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. The HCV and HBV cohorts have been
described in detail in previous studies (Duberg et al, 2008b;
Hofmann et al, 2011). Briefly, we identified all HCV and HBV
infection notifications in Sweden from 1990 to the end of 2006,
based on the records in the national surveillance database at the
Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), to generate
our study cohorts. In Sweden, it is mandatory to report all
diagnosed HCV and HBV infections to SMI since 1990 and 1969,
respectively, and the notifications are delivered in parallel by the
diagnosing laboratory and clinician and merged in the surveillance
database using the personal identification number. The laboratory
reports for HCV are based on positive HCV-RNA or anti-HCV
test (verified with immunoblot, HCV-core antigen, or HCV-RNA
analyses) and for HBV on positive HBsAg or HBV-DNA.
The clinical reports contain information such as probable route
of transmission and for HBV infection also information about
acute or chronic infection based on clinical information and
medical history.
After excluding subjects with multiple notifications, erroneous
documentation, incomplete personal follow-up data, as well as
those with acute HBV infection (N ¼ 2050), and those reported to
both the HCV and the HBV register (N ¼ 3556) to exclude
coinfection, there were 39 442 subjects with HCV infection
forming the HCV cohort and 11 511 individuals with chronic
HBV infection in the HBV cohort.
A five times larger reference population was produced from the
Population Register at Statistics Sweden (1 : 5 matching). For each
HCV- or HBV-infected subject another five individuals who were
never diagnosed with a HCV or HBV infection were randomly
selected from the general population matched on year of birth, sex
and county of residence in Sweden. This procedure formed a HCV
reference cohort of 197 208 individuals and a chronic HBV
reference cohort of 57 554 subjects. Each individual in the
noninfected reference cohorts was assigned the same ‘study entry’
date as their matched infected individual, that is, the HCV or HBV
notification date.
Linkage to other registers. The national registration number
(NRN) is a unique personal identification number allocated to
every Swedish resident. Via the NRNs, our cohort members were
followed by cross linkages through Swedish registers, including the
Population Register, Cause of Death Register, Cancer Register and
the Inpatient Register, to obtain information on date of emigration,
date and cause of death, any malignancies and hospital admissions
for certain medical conditions.
Pancreatic cancer, as our main outcome, was ascertained from
the Cancer Register (International Classification of Disease ICD-7:
157) for the principal analyses, but also from the Cause of Death
Register (ICD-9: 157; ICD-10: C25) for some additional analyses.
From the Inpatient register hospitalisations with the discharge
diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, chronic pancreatitis and diagnoses related to alcohol
abuse were identified (for ICD-codes, see Appendix Table A1).
These medical conditions were considered as potential confounders or related to a confounder and therefore identified and
adjusted for in some of the analyses.
For additional analyses also acute pancreatitis was identified
from the Inpatient Register, and to further study the impact of
smoking all incident lung cancers in the cohorts were ascertained
from the Cancer Register (ICD-codes in Appendix Table A1).
Follow-up. The individuals in the cohorts were followed from the
entry date, either their HCV/HBV notification date or the
corresponding assigned study entry date (noninfected reference
population), until the date of first primary cancer diagnosis,
emigration, death or the end of follow-up (31 December 2008),
whichever came first.
To minimise the potential influence of selection bias, the first
6 months of follow-up for each patient were excluded in all final
analyses. This lag time of 6 months was based on modelling the
hazard after inclusion in the cohort using a restricted cubic spline
model (Torner et al, 2011).
Statistical analyses. In the first statistical analysis, the risk for
pancreatic cancer in the HCV cohort and in the HBV cohort was
compared with the risk in the general population. This was
measured as the Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR), which is the
ratio of the observed number of pancreatic cancer cases compared
with the expected case number. For each cohort, the expected
numbers were calculated from the observed person-time in each
5-year age group by sex and the corresponding Swedish population
incidence rates. Thus, in the SIR calculation, age of follow-up, sex
and calendar year were inherently adjusted. Assuming that the
number of observed pancreatic cancer cases followed a Poisson
distribution, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
according to the Max method (Kulkarni et al, 1998). Stratified
analyses were performed by sex, infection duration, period and
year of birth (before/after 1960). On the basis of an earlier
developed model, duration of HCV infection at the time of
notification was estimated according to age, suspected route of
transmission and the epidemiology of HCV transmission in
Sweden (Duberg et al, 2005).
In the second statistical analysis, to further evaluate the
association, we utilised the Cox proportional hazards regression
model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95%
CIs. Pancreatic cancer risk in the HCV cohort and in the HBV
cohort was compared with pancreatic cancer risk in the
corresponding noninfected reference cohort. In these cohorts, the
noninfected individuals were matched to the HCV- or HBVinfected patients by birth year, sex and county of Sweden;
therefore, these variables were inherently adjusted in the models.
Furthermore, adjustments for other potential confounders were
applied in the Cox model, including hospitalisations for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis and diagnoses related to alcohol abuse. However, concerning
that diabetes mellitus or chronic pancreatitis might be consequences of pancreatic cancer, we ignored diabetes mellitus or
chronic pancreatitis diagnoses within 5 years before pancreatic
cancer diagnosis. Finally, we conducted an additional analysis
stratified by sex.
Acute pancreatitis might be a complication to interferon therapy
for HCV infection, and pancreatitis is reported to be a risk factor
for pancreatic cancer. To exclude the possibility of iatrogenic risk,

additional Cox regression analyses were made after exclusion of all
patients who ever hospitalised for acute and/or chronic pancreatitis
(in the HCV cohort: n ¼ 1387; in the HCV reference cohort:
n ¼ 1491).
The Swedish Cancer Register does not include the Death
Certificate Only cases, thus some pancreatic cancers might be
missed by only using the Cancer Register (Luo et al, 2008).
Therefore, we further performed a Cox regression analysis
including pancreatic cancer cases ascertained from the Cancer
register and the Cause of Death Register.
In order to estimate the potential influence of smoking, similar
analyses (SIR, HR) were conducted for lung cancer in parallel.
The R language for statistical computing (R Core Team, 2011)
was used for both data preparation and the statistical analyses. For
the statistical analyses, the R-package ‘survival’ (Therneau, 2011)
was used together with Lexis objects (Martyn Plummer, 2011) in
the ‘Epi’ R-package (Carstensen et al, 2011).
Ethical approval. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical
Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden. To ensure the data
confidentiality, the personal identification numbers were deleted
after the record linkage and before the analysis.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the HCV and HBV cohorts are
presented in Table 1. In the HCV and chronic HBV cohorts the
mean follow-up time were 9.1 and 9.4 years, with a total of 360 154
and 107 986 person-years at risk, respectively. There was a clear
male dominance in the HCV cohort, and median age at entry into
the HCV or HBV cohorts (notification date) was 38 and 31 years,
respectively. A marked difference between cohorts was observed
regarding the aspect of country of origin; HCV-infected individuals
were more likely from Nordic countries, but persons with
chronic HBV infection were often immigrants from non-Nordic
countries.
Hepatitis C virus cohort. In the HCV cohort, there were 34
pancreatic cancer cases observed during 340 819 person-years of
follow-up (first 6 months of follow-up excluded), whereas 16.5
were expected, yielding a statistically significant increased risk of
pancreatic cancer (SIR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.9). The SIR did not alter
substantially across sex or estimated duration of HCV infection
(Table 2). The majority of cases were among the patients who were
born before 1960.
From the Cox regression model, an B90% excessive risk for
pancreatic cancer (HR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.7) was observed after
adjustment for age, sex and county of residence, which is similar to
the result from the SIR analysis. This excess risk diminished
somewhat but remained statistically significant after further
adjustment for potential confounders (HR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.04,
2.4). The results did not vary markedly when stratified by sex
(Table 3). In the additional analyses, excluding all individuals ever
hospitalised with acute and/or chronic pancreatitis, the results did
not alter notably (data not shown).
In the HCV cohort, the SIR for lung cancer was 2.3 (95% CI: 1.9,
2.7) and the HR for lung cancer was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.8, 2.7),
decreasing to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.1) after adjustment for the
potential confounders used in the pancreatic cancer analyses.
Chronic HBV cohort. A total of five pancreatic cancer cases were
found during 102 295 person-years of follow-up (first 6 months
excluded), whereas 3.5 were expected. Compared with the age- and
sex-matched Swedish general population, a 40% excess risk of

pancreatic cancer was found in the chronic HBV cohort (SIR: 1.4;
95% CI: 0.5, 3.3), but without statistical significance. Because of the
small number of pancreatic cancer cases, there was not enough
power for additional stratified analyses (Table 4).
The Cox regression model revealed similar results as the
SIR analysis. The point estimates were somewhat higher (HR ¼ 2.0
from the model adjusted for only matching factors and HR ¼ 1.8
from the fully adjusted model), but still statistically non-significant
(Table 5). The SIR for lung cancer in the chronic HBV infection
cohort was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.5).
Additional analyses. To rule out the impact of pancreatic cancer
cases missing in the Cancer Registry, additional analyses (Cox
regression model) were performed including both Cancer Register
and Death Certificate Only pancreatic cancers (HCV cohort:
n ¼ 77; chronic HBV cohort: n ¼ 20). The main results did not
alter appreciably (HR for HCV infection: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.6;
other data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This population-based large cohort study revealed a doubled risk of
pancreatic cancer among HCV-infected patients compared with
the Swedish general population. The excess risk was persistent
across strata by sex or duration of infection. Although further
adjustment for potential confounders, i.e., chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (related to smoking), diabetes mellitus, chronic
pancreatitis and alcohol-related disease, resulted in an attenuated
relative risk, this finding still supports the hypothesis that HCV
infection might be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic
cancer. Besides, the result indicated a moderate excessive risk of
pancreatic cancer among HBV-infected patients according to
different statistical approaches, but the size of the study cohort and
the observed number of cancers were too small to draw a sound
conclusion. Pancreatic cancer is more common in older age
groups, and the small number of pancreatic cancers among
the HBV cohort was probably an effect of the relatively young
cohort, concordant with the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis
B in Sweden.
The strengths of this register-based study include populationbased cohort design, relatively large sample size, independently
collected data on documentation of HCV/HBV notifications and
pancreatic cancer occurrence and high completeness of follow-up.
However, some limitations need to be discussed.
Tobacco use is an established risk factor and cigarette smokers
have a doubled risk for pancreatic cancer (Bosetti et al, 2012). In
this study, it was impossible to identify smokers but possible to
identify subjects diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (a smoking-related disease). Besides, diabetes mellitus,
chronic pancreatitis and heavy alcohol consumption are possible
risk factors for pancreatic cancer (Ye et al, 2002; Torbenson et al,
2007; Ben et al, 2011) that might bias the association between
HCV infection and pancreatic cancer risk. To allay these concerns,
we adjusted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis as well as alcohol-related
disease strongly correlated to heavy alcohol consumption in the
Cox regression model. Although slightly attenuated, the HRs for
pancreatic cancer did not alter remarkably after adjustment for
these potential confounding factors. In order to get further insight

into potential effects of smoking, the SIR and HR for lung cancer
were calculated. A doubled risk of lung cancer in the HCV cohort
indicated that smoking was more common than in the general
population. The HR for lung cancer decreased to 1.6 after
adjustment for the potential confounders also used in the
pancreatic cancer analyses, strengthening the use of these
diagnoses as surrogate markers for smoking. After adjustment
the HRs were attenuated but still increased at the similar
magnitude for pancreatic cancer and lung cancer, indicating that
smoking was not the only explanation of the increased risk for
pancreatic cancer in the HCV cohort. If this finding was explained
only by smoking the HR of lung cancer in the HCV cohort
probably should have been higher, as in previous studies the
relative risk of lung cancer was B10 among smokers compared
with non-smokers (Pesch et al, 2012), whereas that for pancreatic
cancer was around two-fold (Bosetti et al, 2012). Furthermore,
based on Walker’s finding (Walker, 1991), the confounding effect
size is usually rather small even when both the exposure-covariate
relationship and confounder-disease relationship are strong. For
instance, in order to completely bias the exposure effect of 1.4 by a
pure confounding of smoking, it requires that both the association
between smoking and HCV/HBV infection as well as smoking and
pancreatic cancer are larger than 3.
Acute pancreatitis could possibly be a complication of interferon
therapy (Chaudhari et al, 2004) and might act as a potential
mediator in the pathway between HCV infection and pancreatic
cancer. To exclude the possibility of iatrogenic risk, additional
analyses were performed excluding all individuals ever hospitalised
with pancreatitis (acute and chronic), but the results did not alter
notably.
Another potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer is the use of
Scandinavian snus (Boffetta et al, 2005; Luo et al, 2007), which is a
common habit in Sweden; Statistics Sweden reported in 2012 that,
irrespective of socioeconomic status, 20–25% of men were snususers. We have no information about the prevalence of snus-users
in the HCV or HBV cohort.
In the relatively young HBV cohort, the sample size and the
number of observed cancers were too small to draw a sound
conclusion, not to mention further stratified analyses. An issue that
needs to be addressed is that the majority of HBV-infected patients
originated from non-Nordic countries, 37% from former Yugoslavia and 32% from Asia. This probably resulted in an underestimation of the relative pancreatic cancer risk in this cohort given
the fact that pancreatic cancer incidence has been reported higher
among Swedes than immigrants (Mousavi et al, 2010). However,
we were unable to match the HBV-infected patients and the
reference population on their country of birth.
The parallel (laboratory and clinician) notification system of
HCV/HBV infections in Sweden has a high coverage of those with
a diagnosed infection; it is estimated that about 75–80% of HCV
infections are diagnosed, but there still remain unknown infections,
not yet diagnosed or documented. In addition, a small portion of
the reported patients could have a resolved infection, spontaneously or by treatment, this could (probably insignificant) lower
the risk in the HCV and HBV cohort.
The number of unidentified HCV/HBV-coinfected individuals
is probably low in the studied cohorts. However, in the HCV
cohort there could be some patients who were never diagnosed
with hepatitis B but have serologic markers of a past HBV
infection. In these patients we cannot exclude the possibility of
occult hepatitis B.
The biological mechanism of the association between HCV and
pancreatic cancer is unclear. However, virtually, the pancreas and
liver share the common blood vessels and ducts, and prior evidence
demonstrated that the pancreas is a remote location for hepatitis
virus inhabitation and replication (Hassan et al, 2008). HCV
infection is associated with type 2 diabetes, which is both a risk
factor and might be a consequence of pancreatic cancer (Mehta
et al, 2000; Sangiorgio et al, 2000). Besides, previous studies
reported that subclinical/acute pancreatitis (Katakura et al, 2005)
and hyperlipasemia (Yoffe et al, 2003) may be extrahepatic
manifestations of HCV infection. In addition, pancreatic involvement was observed among patients who suffered from chronic
hepatitis infection, resulting in mild pancreatic damage accompanied with increased serum levels of pancreatic enzyme (Taranto
et al, 1989; Katakura et al, 2005). Immune response may lead to
chronic inflammation in the targeted organs after long time
persistent infection with HCV. Therefore, hepatitis C virus
conceivably serves as a biological agent that may indirectly have
a role in inflammation-associated pancreatic carcinogenesis.
Although still unclear to what extent chronic inflammation
contributes to pancreatic cancer development, it is postulated that
HCV can induce inflammatory microenvironment with high
concentration of growth factors and cytokines. This may exert
effects by accumulating alterations in driver genes and promoting
cancer cell growth and proliferation. To date, very few
epidemiologic studies have explored the association between
HCV and pancreatic cancer. In the US veterans cohort study
(El-Serag et al, 2009), a significant association between HCV and
pancreatic cancer was first found but was attenuated after
adjusting for alcohol consumption, pancreatitis and some other
potential confounders. In a case–control study, Hassan et al
(2008) found that the prevalence of HCV antibodies was not
significantly higher among patients with pancreatic cancer (1.5%)
than controls (1%). In our cohort study we found a doubled
risk for pancreatic cancer in the HCV cohort, somewhat attenuated
after adjustment for confounders but still statistically significant,
indicating that HCV may have a role in the pancreatic
carcinogenesis.
The role of HBV in carcinogenesis is not totally understood.
Earlier studies proposed that HBV may replicate in the pancreas,
based on the facts of detection of HBsAg in pancreatic juice
(Hoefs et al, 1980), the detection of HBsAg and HBV core antigen
in the pancreas acinar cells (Yoshimura et al, 1981), and
verification of HBV-DNA integration in pancreatic tissue
(Dejean et al, 1984). As mentioned, it has been hypothesised that
long-term chronic HBV infection, concurrent with damage
of pancreatic epithelial cells, results in an inflammatory response
and consequently has a role in pancreatic cancer development
(Taranto et al, 1989).
Some epidemiologic studies have investigated the association
between HBV infection and pancreatic cancer risk. In a case–
control study, Hassan et al (2008) reported a significantly increased
prevalence of past exposure to HBV, but not current or chronic
infection, in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with
controls. In contrast, the REVEAL-HBV cohort study and a recent
Chinese case–control study suggested that an increased risk of
pancreatic cancer was associated with chronic HBV infection
(Iloeje et al, 2010; Ben et al, 2012). In a recent meta-analysis, it was
reported that inactive HBsAg carrier status and possible occult
HBV infection may elevate the risk of pancreatic cancer (Wang
et al, 2012b). In our study, point estimates favoured a positive
association between HBV infection and pancreatic cancer risk, but
due to a limited study power none of the observed associations
were statistically significant.
In conclusion, this nationwide population-based cohort study
demonstrated an increased risk of pancreatic cancer among HCVinfected individuals, although this excess risk was attenuated but
still statistically significant after adjustment for other potential risk
factors. Our results support the hypothesis that HCV infection
might be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but
further studies, with more complete information about other
potential confounding factors, are needed to verify the association
and to explore the causality.
