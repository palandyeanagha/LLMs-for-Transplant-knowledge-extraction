Role of albumin in the preservation 
of endothelial glycocalyx integrity 
and the microcirculation: a review
Cesar Aldecoa1, Juan V. Llau2, Xavier Nuvials3 and Antonio Artigas4*
Abstract
The endothelial glycocalyx comprises a complex layer of membrane-bound proteoglycans, secreted glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, glycolipids and bound plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin associated with the 
endothelial surface. The glycocalyx plays an important role in vascular homeostasis, regulating vascular permeability 
and cell adhesion, and acts as a mechanosensor for hemodynamic shear stresses; it also has antithrombotic and 
anti-infammatory functions. Plasma proteins such as albumin are physiologically bound within the glycocalyx, thus 
contributing to stability of the layer. Albumin is the major determinant of plasma colloid osmotic pressure. In addition, 
albumin transports sphingosine-1-phosphate which has protective endothelial efects, acts as a free radical scavenger, 
and has immunomodulatory and anti-infammatory efects. This review examines the physiological function of the 
endothelial glycocalyx and the role of human albumin in preserving glycocalyx integrity and the microcirculation.

The endothelial glycocalyx
Composition and structure of the endothelial glycocalyx
Te endothelial glycocalyx is a complex carbohydraterich gel-like layer lining the luminal surface of blood vessels [1]; it functions as a barrier between the blood and 
vessel wall [2, 3]. Te glycocalyx layer is composed of 
membrane-bound proteoglycans, secreted glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, 
and glycolipids associated with the endothelial surface 
(Fig.  1) [4]. Te main proteoglycans of the endothelial 
glycocalyx are membrane-spanning syndecans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glypicans which carry 
the two main GAGs, heparan sulfate and chondroitin 
sulfate, through covalent attachment to the protein core. 
Syndecans carry both GAGs, while glypicans carry only 
heparan sulfate. Table  1 summarizes the characteristics 
of core proteoglycans in the glycocalyx [5]. A third major 
GAG, hyaluronan, is secreted by endothelial cells but is 
not covalently linked to a core protein; it binds to cell 
surface adhesion receptors such as CD44. Plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin are also bound 
within the glycocalyx [4, 6–9].
Te term endothelial surface layer is sometimes used 
to describe the intimal surface of blood vessels comprising the endothelial glycocalyx and associated components derived from endothelial cells and plasma [3, 10]. 
Te thickness of the glycocalyx/endothelial surface layer 
(Fig.  2) [11] varies depending on the method used for 
measurement [9]. Intravital microscopy and orthogonal 
polarization spectral imaging are techniques which indirectly measure the endothelial glycocalyx in  vivo, and 
the glycocalyx can be measured indirectly ex vivo using 
microparticle image velocimetry. Te glycocalyx can 
be measured directly in  vitro using transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy 
and atomic force microscopy, and ex  vivo using twophoton laser scanning microscopy [12, 13]. In humans,

the mean microvascular glycocalyx thickness estimated 
using orthogonal polarization spectral imaging was about 
0.5 µm (range 0.3 to 0.75 µm) [14].
Physiological function of the endothelial glycocalyx
Te outermost layer of the microvasculature serves as a 
regulatory barrier of vascular permeability. It participates 
in mechanotransduction by sensing fuid shear forces 
and regulating the vascular tone. Te endothelial glycocalyx, which has an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis [9], also has several anti-adhesive and 
antithrombotic efects on the surface of endothelial cells 
and can protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress [3, 
6–9, 15, 16].

resuscitation. A revised Starling model, frst proposed 
by Levick and Michel [17] which incorporates the efect 
of the endothelial glycocalyx, basement membrane and 
extracellular matrix on fuid exchange, provides a better explanation of fuid transvascular interchanges and 
a patient’s response to fuid resuscitation because the 
efect of the glycocalyx in reducing fuid extravasation 
was unknown. Consequently, in Starling’s original model, 
the observed extracellular volume distribution following fuid resuscitation was not predicted by the model 
[2, 16–19]. Starling’s original principle and the revised 
Starling equation and glycocalyx model are compared in 
Additional fle  1: Table  S1 [18] and shown in Fig.  3 [2]. 
Te revised Starling model proposes that the endothelial glycocalyx is the key determinant of hydrostatic and 
oncotic pressure gradients between the capillary lumen 
and the interstitium. Important Starling forces are the 
transendothelial pressure diference (Pc − Pis) and colloid osmotic pressure diference between plasma and the 
subglycocalyx (πp − πsg). Tis oncotic pressure diference 
explains the failure of the interstitial protein concentration to infuence fuid movement [2, 17, 18].
Under physiological conditions, the glycocalyx acts as a 
barrier against the shift of albumin and other circulating 
plasma components (mainly other proteins) across the 
endothelium [20, 21].
Mechanosensory function
Mechanical forces on endothelial cells generated by 
blood fow evoke biochemical responses that modulate 
endothelial structure and function through a process 
known as mechanotransduction. Te glycocalyx acts as 
a cytoskeleton for endothelial cells. Mechanical distortion of ‘bush-like’ clusters of proteoglycans projecting 
from anchor points in the endothelial cell cytoskeleton 
generates forces which can deform the cytoskeleton. An 
associated increase in the expression of endothelial nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase catalyzes the production of NO, 
dilating vessels and reducing stress [2, 22, 23].
Rheological function
Te glycocalyx has a vasculo-protective role by repelling 
red blood cells and by physically inhibiting the interaction of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (e.g., integrins 
and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily) with 
circulating platelets and leukocytes [9, 10].
Anticoagulation function
Several important anticoagulant mediators bind to GAGs 
located in the glycocalyx. Tese include antithrombin 
which binds via heparan sulfate to inhibit thrombin and 
activated factors IX and X; heparin cofactor II which is 
activated by dermatan sulfate; and tissue factor pathway 
inhibitor which binds via heparan sulfate to inhibit factors VIIa and Xa. Trombomodulin, an endogenous anticoagulant produced by endothelial cells, interacts with 
thrombin to activate the protein C anticoagulant pathway 
[2].
Protective function against free radicals
Glycocalyx binding of enzymes such as extracellular 
superoxide dismutase protects endothelial cells against 
oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) while 
maintaining NO availability, thus preventing endothelial 
dysfunction [9, 24].
Physiological role of endogenous albumin
Although albumin has a net negative charge, its amphoteric nature promotes tight binding to the glycocalyx with 
the net efect of reducing hydraulic conductivity across 
the vascular barrier, resisting glycocalyx degradation (i.e., 
protecting against shedding) and thereby contributing to 
maintenance of vascular integrity and normal capillary 
permeability, and facilitating transmission of shear stress 
[2, 15, 23, 25].
Under physiological conditions, the concentration of 
intravascular albumin is the major determinant of plasma 
colloid osmotic pressure [18].
Exposed thiol groups on the albumin molecule act as a 
scavenger for ROS such as superoxide (O2
−) and hydroxyl 
(
•
OH) radicals and reactive nitrogen species, e.g., peroxynitrite radicals. Albumin has an additional anti-oxidant 
efect through binding to free copper ions (Cu2+) which 
are known to accelerate the production of free radicals 
[26, 27].
Albumin also has immunomodulatory and antiinfammatory efects through binding of bacterial products, modulation of antigen-presenting cell function,

modulation of cytokine production, and reducing 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α gene expression which is 
upregulated in response to low oxygen concentrations 
[25].
Along with lipoproteins, albumin has an important 
role in delivering sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to the 
endothelial cell surface where it functions in maintaining 
normal vascular permeability [28]. S1P protects endothelial cells by suppressing the activity of metalloproteinases, 
stabilizes the glycocalyx by reducing GAG degradation 
and shedding [21, 22], and regulates barrier function 
by modulating the expression of vascular endothelialcadherin and β-catenin at endothelial cell–cell contact 
regions [29].
Post-translational modifcations of human serum albumin include glycation, cysteinylation, S-nitrosylation, 
S-guanylation and S-transnitrosation which can afect 
the binding of some exogenous drugs [30]. In addition, 
advanced glycation end (AGE)-modifed albumin can 
induce proinfammatory signaling through activation 
of AGE receptors [31]. Tis was illustrated in a murine 
model of peritonitis and sepsis where administration of 
therapeutic infusion solutions containing high concentrations of AGE-modifed albumin reduced survival [32].
Alterations of the endothelial glycocalyx
Pathologies/interventions associated with glycocalyx 
alterations
Glycocalyx and endothelial cell damage, or endotheliopathy as it is known [33], occur in several clinical situations including ischemia–reperfusion injury, hypoxia/
reoxygenation, infammation, sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, 
hypervolemia, hyperglycemia, excessive shear stress and 
coronary artery bypass surgery [23, 34]. Tese injuries 
determine pathological changes in the endothelial glycocalyx such as impaired mechanotransduction, increased 
egress of leukocytes, loss of coagulation control, loss of 
anti-oxidant defense, loss of deposited growth factors, 
and increased vascular permeability (Fig.  4) [10, 35]. In 
a clinical context, disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx layer can lead to development of interstitial edema in 
some patients, notably those with infammatory conditions such as sepsis [36].
Ischemia–reperfusion injury
Ischemia–reperfusion injury results in tissue damage following disruption of the glycocalyx [37]. Microvascular endothelial cell dysfunction produces organ 
dysfunction locally or systemically, including systemic infammatory response syndrome [38]. Cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury may occur during 
procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting,

percutaneous coronary angioplasty, and heart transplant 
surgery [39], with cardiac surgery per se also producing 
glycocalyx damage [40].
Sepsis
Glycocalyx shedding is a feature of infammation, trauma 
and sepsis, and is mediated by pro-infammatory agents 
including tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, 
adenosine, bradykinin, histamine, platelet-activating factor, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Glycocalyx shedding leads to increased vascular permeability, tissue 
edema and relative hypovolemia [41–43].
Many features of endothelial dysfunction in sepsis are 
shared with aging and with numerous chronic diseases 
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus 
(DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular 
disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer. Common features 
include glycocalyx degradation and shedding; increased 
oxidative stress and systemic infammation; intercellular 
junction disassembly, endothelial cell death and blood–
tissue barrier disruption; enhanced leukocyte adhesion 
and extravasation; and induction of procoagulant and 
antifbrinolytic pathways [43].
Hemorrhagic shock
Endothelial glycocalyx shedding has been shown in 
rodent models of hemorrhagic shock, although the 
underlying mechanism is unknown [44–46]. Recent 
results in rats subjected to non-traumatic hemorrhagic 
shock showed glycocalyx degradation, which was independent of increased vascular barrier permeability [46].
Hyperglycemia
Evidence from rodent models [47] and clinical studies in 
volunteers [48] suggests that acute and chronic hyperglycemia can cause glycocalyx damage. Te link between 
DM and CVD is well established with CVD being the 
most common cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients [49]. A role for heparan sulfates in the 
development of widespread vascular endothelial damage 
leading to albuminuria and associated complications in 
patients with type 1 DM was suggested by Deckert and 
colleagues who formulated the ‘Steno hypothesis’ which 
proposes that albumin leakage results from extensive 
vascular damage [50]. Exposure of vascular endothelial 
cells to hyperglycemia and advanced glycosylation end 
products causes glycocalyx disintegration with increased 
leukocyte egress and release of human protease activated 
receptor 2 agonists, together with endothelial NO synthase uncoupling, resulting in reduced NO availability 
and increased vascular permeability [51].
Other
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may have 
a role as a causal contributor to sepsis survival [52, 53]. 
Low HDL-C levels have been shown to be a strong predictor of organ dysfunction or death in patients with 
suspected sepsis [54]. As HDL-C is able to bind and 
sequester pathogenic lipids (e.g., endotoxins), its modifcation might be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating 
sepsis [55].
Potential efects of fuid therapy
Hypervolemia and type of fuid administered
A direct comparison of the hemodynamic efects of 
resuscitation fuids showed that colloids signifcantly 
increased plasma volume, cardiac index, and central 
venous pressure compared with crystalloids (p<0.05), 
despite infusion of a higher volume of crystalloids 
(median 1800 vs 1500 mL) [55]. Tis is relevant because 
the duration of fuid infusion in fuid challenge signifcantly infuences fuid responsiveness [56]. Fluid responsiveness does not equate with fuid requirement. Excess 
volume in the circulation is compensated by redistribution between stressed and unstressed volume [57] 
and, in the worst cases, by a leak to the interstitial space 
worsening tissue oxygenation [58]. A recently reported 
randomized trial found no diferences between a slow 
(180  min) or rapid (30  min) infusion of 5% albumin on 
plasma volume expansion in patients following major 
abdominal surgery, and the rapid infusion had no efect 
on vascular leak [59].
As the type of fuid infused has an important efect on 
the glycocalyx, diferences between albumin and crystalloids on glycocalyx function have been described.
In in  vivo experiments of anesthetized rats subjected 
to hemorrhagic shock followed by fuid resuscitation, 
administration of normal saline failed to restore endothelial glycocalyx thickness and plasma levels of syndecan-1 
(indicating failure to repair the glycocalyx), leading to a 
marked increase in vascular permeability and leukocyte 
rolling/adhesion. In contrast, albumin stabilized permeability and leukocyte rolling/adhesion, efects which were 
comparable to fresh frozen plasma. Albumin partially 
restored endothelial glycocalyx thickness, and lowered 
plasma syndecan-1 to baseline levels [60].
A recent review of commonly used resuscitation fuids 
for use in the critically ill highlighted the need to consider not only the oncotic properties of a fuid, but also 
its relative ability to protect and restore the endothelial 
glycocalyx. In this regard, evidence from observational 
and pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies indicates that 
albumin and fresh frozen plasma are superior to crystalloids and artifcial colloids [61], although prospective 
studies are needed to confrm these fndings.

Markers of endothelial damage
Biomarkers of endothelial damage have been developed 
with most applied prognostically for conditions of systemic infammation and sepsis [43, 62–71] (Box  1). In 
patients with septic shock, increased plasma angiopoietin-2 levels were associated with higher fuid overload, 
hepatic and coagulation dysfunction, acute kidney injury, 
mortality, and plasma cytokines, likely as the result of 
increased vascular leakage [72].
Assessment of glycocalyx damage using a variety of 
biomarkers has provided evidence of glycocalyx degradation in a range of clinical conditions including trauma, 
CKD, myeloid leukemia, acute decompensated heart failure, and Crohn’s disease [5].

Clinical studies on the efect of human albumin 
in the glycocalyx and microcirculation
A recent study of patients with septic shock (n=30) 
reported that, compared with saline, albumin improved 
skin endothelial cell function, improving microcirculatory blood fow. Tese benefcial efects may be independent of the oncotic properties of albumin as neither 
cardiac output nor skin blood fow difered between albumin- and saline-treated patients [88].
Conclusions and expert opinion
Te endothelial glycocalyx plays an important role in regulating vascular permeability. Glycocalyx and endothelial 
cell damage occurs in several clinical situations including 
sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, hypervolemia, and hyperglycemia. Albumin is physiologically bound within the glycocalyx, protecting against shedding and contributing to 
the maintenance of vascular integrity and normal capillary permeability. Owing to these properties, albumin 
has the potential to improve outcomes in clinical scenarios characterized by damaged glycocalyx. Based on 
our review and interpretation of the available literature, 
we provide an opinion on the most suitable applications 
for albumin and highlight areas which require additional 
research.
Monitoring the microcirculation and endothelial damage
Several techniques are available to monitor the microcirculation and endothelial damage. Tese include: intravital microscopy in in vivo animal models for visualization 
of vascular dynamic events such as microvascular permeability, vasotone and blood fow [89] or the glycocalyx 
[90, 91]; assessment of the microcirculation with potential to measure the glycocalyx in critically ill patients [92]; 
application of near-infrared spectroscopy to measure tissue oxygenation [93, 94]; measuring skin mottling over 
the anterior surface of the knee [94]; measuring microalbuminuria [95]; biomarkers of acute kidney injury [96]; 
measuring protein concentrations in alveolar fuid lavage; 
and hemostasis-related biomarkers, e.g., factor VIII, von 
Willebrand factor, International Normalized Ratio, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count.

to light emitted by a light emitting diode probe which is 
refected by hemoglobin and detected by a SDF camera 
[97]. Total vessel density, perfused vessel density, proportion of perfused vessels and microvascular fow index 
are traditionally estimated by ofine computer analysis although, more recently, point-of-care approaches 
using validated automatic software platforms have been 
described [98, 99]. SDF imaging detection of RBCs is 
used as a marker of microvascular perfusion, and measurement of the perfused boundary region (PBR) as an 
indirect marker for endothelial glycocalyx barrier dimensions. In a large study of overweight and obese individuals, the PBR and presence of RBCs in the microvascular 
circulation were markedly associated [100]. Hand-held 
intravital microscopy showed that sublingual microvascular blood fow alterations are common in patients with 
sepsis, with blood fow abnormality related to disease 
severity [92, 101]. Furthermore, sublingual microvascular glycocalyx is damaged in critically ill patients, especially those with sepsis [102, 103], but also after cardiac 
surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass [104, 105] and in 
emergency room and intensive care unit patients [106]. 
However, in patients with sepsis, there was no association of PBR and syndecan-1 values with established 
microcirculatory parameters [102], likely indicating that 
both alterations occur independently. Tese data should 
be treated with caution as the reproducibility of three 
sublingual microcirculation parameters (vascular density, RBC flling and PBR) estimated by SDF imaging is 
controversial and large studies are required to achieve 
statistically signifcant efects [107]. However, some studies have shown good reproducibility with the method if 
consecutive measurements are averaged [106, 108, 109]. 
Te accuracy of in  vivo glycocalyx measurement has 
been analyzed further with an in  vitro approach using 
atomic force microscopy [102, 110]. Consensus European 
Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines provide 15 
recommendations for acquisition and interpretation of 
microcirculatory images obtained with hand-held vital 
microscopes for assessment of the microcirculation in 
critically ill patients [92].
According to our clinical and scientifc judgement, biomarkers of endothelial damage and/or evaluation of the 
sublingual microcirculation may have a role in identifying 
subgroups of patients at risk of morbidity and mortality.
We consider that albumin should be used in accepted 
indications in which it has a proven positive risk:beneft 
balance, mainly in septic patients (for initial resuscitation 
after adequate crystalloid infusion and hypoalbuminemic septic shock), for burn shock resuscitation and fuid 
maintenance, and in some cases of liver insufciency. 
Te benefts of albumin may relate to its ability to restore 
function to damaged glycocalyx, although further studies 
are required to confrm this relationship and identify 
thresholds for optimal beneft. Te mechanism of action 
of these restorative efects also needs to be elucidated.
Further research
As the lung and kidney are the organs most afected by 
septic shock, pre-clinical investigation of the efects of 
albumin on permeability disorders of these organs should 
be conducted. Te development of non-invasive imagingbased analysis tools to assess changes in permeability, 
diameter, and blood fow of vessels in response to specifc 
stimuli is beginning to beneft research in both pre-clinical and clinical areas. It is likely that patients’ response 
to albumin may difer depending on localization of the 
blood vessel under investigation.
Detailed studies of the efect of albumin on oxidative 
stress are required and could be assessed using in  vitro 
models (e.g., cultures of human endothelial cells and 
glycocalyx components), as these are more reproducible 
than pre-clinical animal studies.
Te main objective of clinical studies of albumin 
should not be to evaluate its efect on overall mortality, 
but rather on more specifc endpoints such as organ dysfunction. Investigating the economic impact of albumin 
and its long-term consequences is also advised. Studies 
should accrue biological information, i.e., justifcation for 
the selected objectives. Smaller studies with homogeneous populations are preferred to large multicenter studies 
of patients with clinical heterogeneity.
In summary, additional research needs to be conducted 
to clarify the role of albumin as a protector or restorer of 
damaged glycocalyx, with the aim of identifying clinical 
applications.
