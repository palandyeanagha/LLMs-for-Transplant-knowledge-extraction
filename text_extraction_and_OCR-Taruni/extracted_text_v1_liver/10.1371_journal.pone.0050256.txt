Abstract
We investigated the possible association between genetic variants in the Patatin like phospholipase-3 (PNPLA3) gene and
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a Han Chinese population. We evaluated twelve tagging single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (tSNPs) of the PNPLA3 gene in a frequency matched case–control study from Fuzhou city of China (553
cases, 553 controls). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the rs738409 GG or GC, and rs139051 TT genotypes were
found to be associated with increased risk of NAFLD, and a significant trend of increased risk with increasing numbers of risk
genotype was observed in the cumulative effect analysis of these single nucleotide polymorphisms. Furthermore, haplotype
association analysis showed that, compared with the most common haplotype, the CAAGAATGCGTG and CGAAGGTGTCCG
haplotypes conferred a statistically significant increased risk for NAFLD, while the CGGGAACCCGCG haplotype decreased
the risk of NAFLD. Moreover, rs738409 C.G appeared to have a multiplicative joint effect with tea drinking (P,0.005) and
an additive joint effect with obesity (Interaction contrast ratio (ICR) = 2.31, 95% CI: 0.7–8.86), hypertriglyceridemia (ICR = 3.07,
95% CI: 0.98–5.09) or hypertension (ICR = 1.74, 95% CI: 0.52–3.12). Our data suggests that PNPLA3 genetic polymorphisms
might influence the susceptibility to NAFLD development independently or jointly in Han Chinese.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging
epidemic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide [1].
NAFLD refers to a wide spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from
fatty liver alone to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with evidence of
liver cell injury, a mixed inflammatory lobular infiltrate, and
variable fibrosis [2,3]. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial; it is well-recognized that obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and environmental factors influence the development and progression of NAFLD [4,5]. In addition, genetic
factors have long been suspected to play a role in NAFLD
development [6,7], and several genes, including PPARa, PEMT,
STAT3 and ABCC2, have been suggested as potential candidates
for either NAFLD susceptibility or disease progression [8,9,10,11].
Patatin like phospholipase-3 (PNPLA3), also known as adiponutrin, belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase family of proteins
that contain adipose triglyceride lipase (PNPLA2), the key protein
involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides to diglycerides in
adipocytes. PNPLA3 is a transmembrane protein which, in
humans, is prominently expressed in hepatocytes and is highly
responsive to changes in energy balance [12]. PNPLA3 exhibits
hydrolase activity against triglycerides, and variations in PNPLA3
alter its catalytic activity and can lead to triglyceride accumulation
in hepatocytes [13,14]. Recently, genome-wide association studies
have suggested that a nonsynonymous sequence variation
(rs738409 C.G) that results in an isoleucine to methionine
substitution at residue 148 (I148M) in PNPLA3, contributes to
differences in hepatic lipid content and the susceptibility to
NAFLD [7,15,16]. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
was also found to be associated with elevated levels of liver
enzymes in healthy subjects, and with disease severity, especially
steatosis and fibrosis, in individuals with NAFLD [17,18,19,20].
However, the contribution of PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes to
NAFLD susceptibility in the Han Chinese population is controversial, one study with a group of 112 NAFLD patients showed
that the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism was not associated with
steatosis [21], while another study with a group of 203 NAFLD
patients found that the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism was
associated with steatosis [22].
In order to address this issue, we investigated the association of
polymorphisms in PNPLA3 and their predicted haplotypes with the
risk for NAFLD in a Han Chinese population. Furthermore, by
taking into consideration the fact that NAFLD is a multifactorial
disorder, we also studied the possible interactions with environmental and ‘internal’ exposures, such as tea drinking, body mass
and other components of the metabolic syndrome.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The use of human blood sample and the protocol in this study
were strictly conformed to the principles expressed in the
Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional
ethical committees of the Union Hospital of Fujian Medical
University and Fujian Medical University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants before their participation in the study.
Study Population
We performed a 1:1 frequency-matched case-control study on
NAFLD in a health examination center of Union Hospital of
Fujian Medical University, from June of 2008 to May of 2011.
The study design has been described in detail elsewhere [23].
Briefly, the study group consisted of 553 unrelated individual
NAFLD patients (399 males and 154 females; mean age: 45.33 +
12.48 years) with features of NAFLD and ultrasonographic (US)
examinations [24]. Patients with secondary causes of steatosis,
including alcohol abuse, total parenteral nutrition, hepatitis B and
hepatitis C virus infection, and the use of drugs known to
precipitate hepatic steatosis, were excluded. In addition, patients
with any of the following diseases were excluded from participation in this study: autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver
disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Additionally, 553 healthy individuals (399 males and 154
females; mean age: 43.87613.00 years) without steatosis by
ultrasonography were chosen randomly from local residents
during the same study period, who underwent a routine health
check and were free of any known major diseases. They were
frequency-matched to the NAFLD patients according to sex, age
(within 5 years), ethnicity, occupation and area of residence. The
ultrasonographic examination of the upper abdominal organs was
performed by two experienced physicians using a scanner
equipped with a 3.5-MHz transducer (Siemens Adama, Erlangen,
Germany). The physicians who performed the ultrasonography
were unaware of this study. All enrolled subjects were of Chinese
Han ethnicity.
Demographic and Clinical Data
All subjects underwent a complete physical examination in the
morning after an overnight fast. Health examination included
anthropometric measurements, abdominal ultrasonography, a
questionnaire on health-related behaviors (smoking, and tea
drinking), and biochemical determinations. Smokers were defined
as subjects who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their
lifetime and were classified as smokers versus non-smokers. Tea
drinkers were defined as individuals who drank at least one cup of
green tea per day for more than half a year and classified as
drinkers versus non-drinkers. Body measurements including
weight and height were measured in a standardized fashion by a
trained examiner. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
follows: weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2
). Overweightness and/or obesity were defined as having a BMI §25 kg/m2
.
Three resting blood pressure readings were obtained at 1-min
intervals; the second and third systolic and diastolic pressure
readings were averaged and used for analysis. Hypertension was
defined as systolic blood pressure§140 mmHg and/or diastolic
blood pressure $90 mmHg, or if the subject was being prescribed
antihypertensive medications. Venous blood samples were drawn
just after the anthropometric examinations. Total cholesterol (TC),
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, and
liver function tests were measured by standard clinical laboratory
techniques. Reduced HDL-C, hypertriglyceridemia, and raised
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were diagnosed according to the
International Diabetes Federation consensus worldwide definition
of the metabolic syndrome [25].
SNP Selection and Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by
standard methods. We selected the tag SNPs by using genotype
data obtained from unrelated Han Chinese in Beijing individuals
from the HapMap project (http://www.hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov). We used the pairwise tagging method of the Haploview V4.2
software (Broad institute, Cambridge, MA) to capture SNPs with a
minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) of .0.10 and a minimum
r
2 of .0.8 and 12 tag SNPs were selected from the HapMap
Project (rs139047, rs738409, rs139051, rs1883350, rs2076208,
rs2076212, rs2294918, rs3810622, rs738407, rs9625961,
rs734561, rs2006943).
Genotyping was performed with Sequenom Mass Array iPLEX
platform (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA) using a allele-specific
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay. Primers for amplification
and extension reactions were designed using Mass Array Assay
Design Version 3.1 software (Sequenom Inc.), and SNP genotypes
were obtained according to the iPLEX protocol provided by the
manufacturer. Laboratory personnel who assessed all genotyping
results were blinded to the samples case–control status. Genotyping quality was examined by a detailed quality control procedure
consisting of .95% successful call rate, duplicate calling of
genotypes, internal positive control samples and Hardy–Weinberg
Equilibrium (HWE) testing. The success rate of genotyping was
greater than 95%, and the concordance rate was greater than 99%
based on 10% of duplicate samples for each SNP.
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise indicated, phenotypic quantitative data were
expressed as mean 6 standard deviation. To evaluate differences
in clinical characteristics between cases and controls, Student’s ttest, Pearson Chi-square or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U
tests were used as appropriate. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) was checked in controls by using the chi-squared test.
Unconditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression
analyses were performed to obtain the crude and adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) for risk of NAFLD and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). Age, sex, marriage, education or income, smoking, tea
drinking, and clinical characteristics were considered as potential
confounders and were also included in the multivariate logistic
regression models. Haploview 4.2 software was used to construct
the haplotypes [26]. Haplo.stats software package developed using
the R language was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for
each haplotype [27]. To assess statistical significance, we
performed permutation procedures to correct the P-value of
single-locus association results for multiple testing. Simulations
were run 1,000 times for empirical P-values.
Stratified analysis was used to explore potential gene–environment interactions. We dichotomized the genetic polymorphism by
grouping subjects into carriers and non-carriers of the risk
genotype. Similarly, ‘internal’ and environmental exposures were
dichotomized by appropriate grouping. P-values for multiplicativity were derived from a cross-product term of gene and
environment exposure introduced into a multiplicative model.
The interaction contrast ratio (ICR) was used to evaluate the
potential additive interaction (ICR = OReg – Ore – Org +1;
where OReg is the OR for both the genotype and exposure, ORe
is the OR for exposure only and ORg is the OR for genotype

only). If ICR .0, we concluded that there was a positive additive
interaction. Ninety-five percent CIs of ICR were computed
according to the method by Hosmer [28], and an ICR can be
considered as statistically significant at alpha level 0.05 if its 95%
CIs do not include zero. All statistical analyses were performed
using R software (version 2.14.1; http://www.r-project.org), unless
indicated otherwise, and a two-sided P-value ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Power Calculations
Power for association studies depends on the sample size, the
level of type I error specified, and the genotype frequencies in
cases and controls. Genotype frequencies will depend on
population frequency of the allele of interest and its effect on
disease liability. Genetic Power Calculator [29] was used to
estimate the statistical power for the statistically significant results
concerning individual polymorphism data. The results showed a
power of .95% for rs738409 under a dominant model, and
.90% for rs139051 under a recessive model regarding the
association with NAFLD found for the allele frequencies and
sample size in the present study. Power calculations for the
statistically significant results concerning gene- environment
interactions were computed according to the method by Foppa
[30], and the results showed a power of .90% for the statistically
significant interactions between rs738409 C.G and external or
‘internal’ environmental exposure.
Results
Study Population Characteristics
The detail data of behaviors, clinical features, anthropometric
variables and laboratory findings at diagnosis available in patients
and healthy controls had been previously described [23]. Briefly,
no statistically significant differences (P.0.05) were found between
patients with NAFLD and controls, in terms of age, sex, marriage,
education, smoking or income status. Compared to controls,
NAFLD patients had a lower percentage of tea drinkers, as well as
higher occurrence of most of the risk factors of the metabolic
syndrome, including elevated blood pressure, BMI, FPG, TC, TG,
LDL-C and decreased HDL-C. In addition, levels of alanine
transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were
significantly higher in patients with NAFLD, compared to controls
(P,0.05).
Association between Individual Genotypes and Risk of
NAFLD
The SNP information, observed allele frequencies and Hardy–
Weinberg test results are presented in Table S1. Twelve PNPLA3
SNPs were genotyped with a mean success rate of 98.1% (range
95.4 to 100%) and all the genotype distributions did not deviate
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. In the single allelic analysis,
tests for associations between NAFLD and the tag SNPs showed
significant differences only for rs738409, and the association
remained significant after multiple comparison correction by
permutation tests (P,0.005). The risk allele (G-allele) frequency of
rs738409 in the control subjects was 0.34 and 0.42 in the NAFLD
patients. After adjustment for age, sex, income, marriage,
education, smoking, tea drinking, BMI and other clinical features,
the genotype distributions of rs738409 and rs139051 showed
significant associations with NAFLD in the multivariate logistic
regression model (Table 1). A significant risk effect on NAFLD was
found to be associated with the genotypes of rs738409. Specifically, compared to the subjects with the CC homozygous alleles,
carriers of heterozygous CG and homozygous GG genotypes had
a significantly increased risk of NAFLD (adjusted OR = 1.39, 95%
CI: 1.03–1.87 for CG genotype; adjusted OR = 2.25, 95% CI:
1.46–3.45 for GG genotype) in an allele dose-response manner
(adjusted PTrend= 0.0004). This association was further revealed
using a dominant model (GG+CG vs. CC, adjusted OR: 1.74;
95% CI: 1.28–2.38, P,0.001). In addition, we also found that
homozygous TT genotype for rs139051 was associated with a
significantly increased risk of NAFLD (adjusted OR = 1.67, 95%
CI = 1.02–2.73), compared with the wild-type CC homozygous
genotype; this association was better demonstrated under a
recessive model (TT vs. CC+CT, adjusted OR: 1.52; 95% CI:
1.11–2.08, P,0.01). We found no significant associations between
others SNPs and NAFLD in the multivariate logistic regression
models (data not shown).
Association of Phenotype with Different rs738409 and
rs139051 Genotypes
To investigate whether the genotypes of rs738409 or rs139051
were associated with clinical parameters, we compared age,
gender, BMI, FPG, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, AST, and ALT
between different genotypes of rs738409 and rs139051 in the
NAFLD and control subjects. We did not observe any association
of rs738409 variant with age, gender, BMI index, TG, TC, HDLC, LDL-C, or FPG levels both in NAFLD patients and controls
(P.0.05). In contrast, AST (P,0.05) levels were significantly
higher in NAFLD patients harboring the risk allele (details in
Table S2). Nevertheless, the T-allele of rs139051 was associated
with significantly decreased BMI and TG levels (P,0.05) in the
NAFLD patients. We did not observe any association of rs139051
variant with age, gender, BMI index, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C,
FPG, AST, or ALT levels in controls (details in Table S3).
Combined Association between rs738409 and rs139051
and Risk of NAFLD
We further checked the possible cumulative risk effect of
rs738409 and rs139051 on risk of NAFLD, finding that NAFLD
patients tended to have more risk genotypes than controls
(Table 2). When using those without variant risk genotype as
references, subjects with two risk genotypes had a 2.40-fold (95%
CI: 1.58–3.65) excess risk for NAFLD. The risk for NAFLD
increased progressively as the number of risk genotypes increased
(Ptrend ,0.001). When the combined genotypes were dichotomized
into two groups (i.e., 0 risk genotypes vs. 1 to 2 risk genotypes), we
found that the combined genotype was associated with a
significantly increased risk of NAFLD compared with those
without risk genotypes (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI :1.20–2.40).
Association between Haplotypes and Risk of NAFLD
LD pattern among PNPLA3 polymorphisms was investigated to
determine haplotype blocks in our study population and two
independent haplotype blocks were detected within the investigated region. One region contained rs738407, rs734561, and
rs2006943) and the other region contained rs1883350, rs2076208,
rs3810622 and rs2294918. The SNPs that were significantly
associated with NAFLD (rs139051 and rs738409) were not located
on block 1 or block 2.
The results of the association between the PNPLA3 haplotype
and the risk of NAFLD were listed in Table 3. There was no
haplotype both in block1 and block2 found to be associated with
the risk of NAFLD. However, global haplotype association analysis
showed that after adjustment for age, sex, education, marriage,
smoking, tea drinking, income, BMI and other clinical characteristics, individuals carrying the haplotypes CAAGAATGCGTG
PNPLA3 Genetic Variants and NAFLD in Han Chinese
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50256

(adjusted OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.03–2.58) and
CGAAGGTGTCCG (adjusted OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.05–4.71)
conferred a statistically significant increased risk for NAFLD, while
individuals carrying the haplotype CGGGAACCCGCG conferred a statistically significant decreased risk for NAFLD (adjusted
OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21–0.96), compared with those carrying the
most common haplotype CGAAGGTCTCCG. Interestingly, the
only difference between the risk haplotype CGAAGGTGTCCG
and the most common haplotype CGAAGGTCTCCG was the
SNP rs738409 G allele, suggesting that the rs738409 G allele may
be the risk allele for NAFLD, which was consistent with the
individual SNP association analysis.
Possible Interactions of the PNPLA3 Polymorphism and
Environmental or ‘Internal’ Exposures on NAFLD
We also explored combined effects of the PNPLA3 polymorphisms and some environmental or ‘internal’ exposures. No
significant interactions (both multiplicative and additive) between
rs139051 T.C and tea drinking, BMI index, reduced HDL-C,
hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and elevated FPG on NAFLD
risk were observed (Table 4). However, rs738409 polymorphism
appeared to have a multiplicative joint effect with tea drinking
(P,0.005) and an additive joint effect with obesity (ICR = 2.31,
95% CI: 0.7–8.86), hypertriglyceridemia (ICR = 3.07, 95% CI:
0.98–5.09) or hypertension (ICR = 1.74, 95% CI: 0.52–3.12) in
identifying NAFLD risk (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study, we selected 12 tag SNPs in the PNPLA3 gene and
examined these variants and their haplotypes on NAFLD in a Han
Chinese population. Our study results indicated that individuals
carrying the rs738409 G-allele may predispose them to NAFLD.
Compared with subjects with the CC homozygous genotype,
carriers of heterozygous CG and homozygous GG genotypes had
a significantly increased risk of NAFLD in an allele dose-response
manner. In addition, rs738409 C.G appeared to have a
multiplicative joint effect with tea drinking and an additive joint
effect with obesity, hypertriglyceridemia or hypertension in
identifying NAFLD risk, respectively. We also found that the

PNPLA3 Genetic Variants and NAFLD in Han Chinese
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50256

rs139051 TT genotype was associated with a statistically
significantly increased risk of NAFLD. The cumulative effect of
the rs139051 and rs738409 SNPs was estimated and a significant
trend of increased risk with increasing numbers of risk genotypes
was observed. Furthermore, the results of haplotype analysis
suggested that the haplotypes CAAGAATGCGTG and
CGAAGGTGTCCG increased the risk for NAFLD, while
haplotype CGGGAACCCGCG decreased risk for NAFLD,
compared with the most common haplotype
CGAAGGTCTCCG. Therefore, the current data showed that
PNPLA3 genetic polymorphisms might influence the susceptibility
to developing NAFLD independently or jointly in the Han
Chinese population.
PNPLA3 is a membrane bound protein expressed primarily in
adipose tissue and liver [31,32]. The expression level of PNPLA3 is
nutritionally regulated [32,33,34], and increases with obesity [35].
The physiological function of PNPLA3 is not fully understood;
though it has been shown to have close homology with adipose
triglyceride lipase [36], and seems to possess both triglyceride
lipase and acyl coenzyme A–independent transacylase activity
[37]. Moreover, it has been recently shown that the PNPLA3 may
also have a role in adipogenesis, being up-regulated during the
differentiation of white adipocytes [38]. Recently, two genome
wide association studies identified a polymorphism in PNPLA3
gene, rs738409 C.G, encoding for the I148M protein variant, as
the strongest genetic determinant of hepatic steatosis and
increased ALT levels [15,16]. Subsequently, other studies
confirmed this association [17,18,19,20]; however, inconsistent
findings were also reported in different populations, including
absence of association with hepatic steatosis in a pediatric
population [17], Hispanic Americans [15], and white (nonHispanic) women residing in the United States [39]. Reasons for
the previous inconsistent findings may include small sample sizes,
different race/ethnicity, inappropriate study design, different
linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs and the different
prevalence of NAFLD in a variety of populations. In the present

PNPLA3 Genetic Variants and NAFLD in Han Chinese
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50256

study, we found that compared with the rs738409 CC homozygote, the rs738409 CG heterozygote and GG homozygote were
associated with a significantly increased risk of developing NAFLD
in a Han Chinese population, which is consistent with the previous
report by Li et al. [22]. No associations were observed between
PNPLA3 genotype and plasma concentrations of TG, TC, FPG,
HDL-C, LDL-C or BMI index which has been confirmed by other
reports, either in the general population or specifically in
individuals with NAFLD [19]. These findings suggested that the
G-allele of the PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP increased the susceptibility
to NAFLD independent of BMI, plasma lipids, and PFG in the
Han Chinese population.
To date, the exact role of the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism in
NAFLD is unclear, although mechanisms by which variation in
PNPLA3 may affect liver triglyceride content have been hypothesized. In vitro rodent studies have shown that the 148M allele
encodes for a loss-of-function variant that predisposes to steatosis
by decreasing triglyceride hydrolysis in hepatocytes [13]. Recent
studies found that subjects carrying the rs738409 PNPLA3 Gallele showed smaller adipocytes [18] and suggested that this allele
may contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis by
modulating adipocyte size, which reflects the amount of lipid able
to be stored in the subcutaneous fat depot. Thus, limited
expandability of the subcutaneous adipose tissue depot has been
considered as a possible factor leading to fat accumulation in
ectopic tissues and organs such as the liver [40]. As such, while
these factors may explain the association between the PNPLA3
I148M polymorphism and NALFD, a definitive mechanism has
not yet been established and merits further study.
Whether PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes affect ALT and AST levels
is not clear. In obese subjects with NAFLD of Caucasian [35,41],
Hispanic [15], or Italian heritage [42], the G-allele of rs738409 is

PNPLA3 Genetic Variants and NAFLD in Han Chinese
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50256

significantly associated with increased AST or ALT levels. However,
in the African American, European American [15], and German
populations [43], rs738409is not associatedwith either raisedALT or
AST levels. In our study, the association between the G-allele of
rs738409 and increased levels of ALT were observed only in the
NAFLD group. Reasons for the inconsistent findings may include
population bias, i.e.,whetherthe subjects included adults or children,
patients with disease (NAFLD or obesity), and the prevalence and
severity of NAFLD in the various study populations.
In the current study, increased risk for NAFLD was also noted for
rs139051 C.T variation using a recessive model. The rs139051 is an
intronic polymorphism; although its functional consequences is less
intuitive, intronic polymorphisms of other genes have been reported
to be associated with a variety of chronic diseases including NAFLD
[11], essential hypertension [44] and type II diabetes [45]. In
addition, immunoprecipitation and gene expression experiments
suggestthat upto 40% oftranscriptionfactor binding sites are located
within introns [46], implying the important role of introns in gene
regulation. As such, the exact molecular mechanism(s) of the
rs139051 C.T SNP involved in increased NAFLD risk requires
further investigation. Given the known association between NAFLD
and insulin resistance and obesity, we also tested for an association of
PNPLA3 rs139051 polymorphisms with FPG, plasma lipids and
BMI. We found that similar to PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele [19], the
rs139051 T variant allele is associated with a significantly decreased
total TG and TC in NAFLD patients. This results suggested that
either rs738409 C.G or PNPLA3 rs139051 C.T confer a
susceptible genetic background for NAFLD without affecting the
severity of FPG, plasma lipids and obesity.
Accumulating evidence has shown that the effect of single
genetic variations may be dependent on other genetic variations
(gene–gene interaction) or environmental factors (gene–environment interaction) [47]. In this regard, it is conceivable that
NAFLD is the result of interactions between multiple genetic
variations and environmental factors. In order to interpret the
locus–locus and gene–environment interaction, the cumulative
effect of rs738409 and rs139051 polymorphisms and the
interaction effects between gene and the environmental or
‘internal’ exposures were also estimated. Our findings revealed
that individuals with two risk alleles were at significantly higher
risk of NAFLD than those without a risk allele, and a significant
trend of increased risk with increasing numbers of risk alleles was
observed, suggesting that the accumulation of risk alleles in
PNPLA3 gene may increase the NAFLD risk. Furthermore, our
results also suggest that rs738409 polymorphism appears to have a
multiplicative joint effect with tea drinking and an additive joint
effect with obesity, hypertriglyceridemia or hypertension in
identifying NAFLD risk, respectively. Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension are established risk factors for NAFLD and
such an interaction may be expected. Previous studies suggest that
green tea consumption decreases mortality from cardiovascular
disease [48] and that it may protect against liver disorders [49].
Consistently, our data showed that tea drinking was a protective
factor for NAFLD. Notably, this study found a possible interaction
between rs738409 polymorphism and tea drinking. Among
individuals carrying rs738409 CG/GG genotypes, the risk of
NAFLD in non-tea drinkers was almost 3-fold that of tea drinkers.
This result indicates that tea consumption might have a potentially
beneficial role in NAFLD prevention among individuals with
rs738409 CG/GG genotypes. Intervention trials are needed in the
future to provide more convincing evidence. The mechanisms by
which tea drinking and rs738409 C.G polymorphism interact to
affect hepatic steatosis are not known. Previous studies have
showed that tea polyphenols were able to decrease the expression
of hepatic lipogenic genes, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes which are also involved in lipid metabolism.
Moreover, PNPLA3 also appears to be part of a family of enzymes
that affect lipid metabolism. These results warrant further studies
to unravel the mechanisms explaining the relationship among tea
drinking, PNPLA3 genotype, and hepatic steatosis.
The strengths of our study included the adoption of a haplotypebased analysis to assess the joint effects of the PNPLA3 genetic
variations on NAFLD. As NAFLD is seemingly a disease involving
multiple SNPs in multiple genes, a haplotype-based analysis may be
more powerful than analyzing a single locus. In our present study,
although all the SNPs except for rs738409 were not associated with
NAFLD risk in the single-locus analysis, haplotype analysis showed
that two haplotypes were significantly associated with the risk of
NAFLD, suggesting that these variants may play a joint role in the
development of NAFLD. Also, because of the relatively large sample
size, we might have adequate statistical power to detect a modest
excess risk. Based on our sample size and the minor allele frequency,
the power of detecting an OR of 1.5 at a two-sided a= 0.05 was
.90%. Finally, the strong interaction between tea drinking and
rs738409 C.G polymorphism could potentially provide important
clues that can be used to devise prevention programs and strategies
for limiting NAFLD development in individuals carrying the
rs738409 G variant.
Several limitations in our study need to be addressed. First,
recall bias was inevitable in this case–control study. However, it
would not affect the genotype data. Thus recall bias is of less
concern in studying genetic-disease associations. Second, the
diagnosis of NAFLD was primarily based on ultrasonographic
findings; however, this limitation is unavoidable, because for
ethical reasons diagnosis of NAFLD based on a more invasive
technique such as liver biopsy would be unacceptable. Finally, in
the present study, the tag SNPs were chosen to maximize SNP
tagging for genetic variation rather than for the functionality of the
PNPLA3 gene, and further mechanistic studies are needed to
determine how these SNPs, especially intronic rs139051 C .T,
influence protein function.
In conclusion, our study shows that some representative genetic
variants in PNPLA3 may modulate the risk of NAFLD in the Han
Chinese population. Furthermore, these variants in combination
with some environmental factors and ‘internal’ exposures could
play a joint role in the development of NAFLD. Studies with
ethnically diverse populations and functional evaluation are
warranted to confirm our findings.
