Abstract
Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common, with surgery as the main curative treatment. The prevalence of
chronic liver disease has increased, but knowledge is limited on postoperative mortality in patients with liver
disease who undergo CRC surgery. Hence, we examined 30-day mortality after CRC surgery in patients with liver
disease compared to those without liver disease.
Methods: We used medical databases to conduct a nationwide cohort study of all patients undergoing CRC
surgery in Denmark from 1996 through 2009. We further identified patients diagnosed with any liver disease before
CRC surgery and categorized them into two cohorts: patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease and patients with liver
cirrhosis. Patients without liver disease were defined as the comparison cohort. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we
computed 30-day mortality after CRC surgery in each cohort. We used a Cox regression model to compute hazard
ratios as measures of the relative risk (RR) of death, controlling for potential confounders including comorbidities. In
order to examine the impact of liver disease in different subgroups, we stratified patients by gender, age, cancer
stage, cancer site, timing of admission, type of surgery, comorbidity level, and non-hepatic alcohol-related disease.
Results: Overall, 39,840 patients underwent CRC surgery: 369 (0.9%) had non-cirrhotic liver disease and 158 (0.4%)
had liver cirrhosis. Thirty-day mortality after CRC surgery was 8.7% in patients without liver disease and 13.3% in
patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (adjusted RR of 1.49 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.98). Among patients
with liver cirrhosis, mortality was 24.1%, corresponding to an adjusted RR of 2.59 (95% CI: 1.86-3.61). The negative
impact of liver disease on postoperative mortality was found in all subgroups.
Conclusions: Pre-existing liver disease was associated with a markedly increased 30-day mortality following CRC
surgery.

Background
Prevalence of liver diseases is increasing worldwide, and
fatty liver and liver cirrhosis are known risk factors for
colorectal cancer (CRC) [1,2]. Among the available treatments for CRC, surgical excision of the primary tumor
remains the only curative approach [3] and liver disease
patients who have CRC surgery may be at increased risk
of postoperative complications and death, related to
effects of anesthesia, bleeding during surgery, infections,
and subsequent multi-organ failure [4].
However, only a few studies have addressed the association between liver disease and mortality following colorectal surgery [5-10], and only one focused on mortality
after CRC surgery [5]. Former studies reported inhospital and 30-day mortalities in liver disease patients
ranging from 6% to 41% after colorectal surgery, compared with 1% to 5% in patients without liver disease.
The majority of former studies has been based on data
from referral centers [5,8,9] and did not include patients
with non-cirrhotic liver disease [5,7-10]. Moreover, they

have been hampered by small study populations [5,8,9],
lack of information on comorbidity and surgery [5,8], lack
of comparison cohorts of patients without liver disease
undergoing same type of surgery [5,8,9], and restriction to
in-hospital mortality [7,9,10]. The comorbidity data in
former studies were limited by incomplete information as
only diagnoses recorded within a short period before surgery were available [6,7,9,10].
Accurate data on mortality in patients with liver disease undergoing CRC surgery are needed to better
understand the prognostic effect of liver disease in CRC
patients. Such results also may help to optimize perioperative care.
We therefore conducted a nationwide cohort study investigating 30-day mortality after CRC surgery in patients with liver disease compared to those without liver
disease.
Methods
This cohort study was conducted within the entire Danish
population which accumulates to 6.8 million people in the
study period from January 1, 1996 through December 31,
2009. The National Health Service provides tax-funded
medical care, including CRC surgery, for all Danish residents. Since 1968, a unique civil registration number
(CPR number) has been assigned to all Danish residents
at birth or upon immigration [11]. The CPR number
allows accurate record linkage at an individual level
among all Danish registries. The study was approved by
the Danish Data Protection Agency. According to Danish
law, the study did not require approval from the health research ethics committee system.
Study cohort
We included all patients with a diagnosis of CRC who
underwent first-time CRC surgery during the study
period. Patients with a CRC diagnosis (see Additional file
1 for diagnosis codes) were identified using the Danish
Cancer Registry (DCR), which contains records of all incident cases of malignant neoplasms in Denmark since
1943 [12]. Data recorded for each individual include
method of cancer verification, cancer stage, and place
of residence on the date of cancer diagnosis. Tumors
registered after January 1, 1978 have been reclassified
according to the International Classification of Diseases,
10th revision (ICD-10).
We used the CPR number to link CRC patients identified in the DCR to the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP) to obtain information about comorbidities
and surgery. The DNRP includes information on all nonpsychiatric hospitalizations since 1977 and on outpatient
contacts since 1995 [13]. Diagnoses have been recorded
according to the ICD-8 until 1993 and according to the
ICD-10 thereafter. Each record includes the dates of
hospital admission and discharge, up to 20 discharge diagnoses, the type of admission (acute or elective), and information about surgery, including type and date of surgical
procedure. Since 1996, surgical procedures have been
coded according to the NOMESCO (Nordic MedicoStatistical Committee) Classification of Surgical Procedures [14]. We therefore chose 1996 as the beginning of
our study period.
As the indication for surgery is not coded in the
DNRP, we defined CRC surgery as a procedure involving
colorectal surgery performed during a hospitalization
where CRC was listed as a diagnosis in the DNRP (see
Additional file 1 for codes). We categorized CRC surgery
into groups according to type of the first recorded procedure. “Radical resection” included surgeries with the
intention of eradicating the primary tumor, such as partial and total resections of the colon and/or rectum. This
group was further divided into laparoscopic and open
surgery. “Non-resectional procedures” included colostomy, stent placement, or excision of a very small part of
the colon (see Additional file 1 for codes). For each patient we reported the timing of the admission as elective
or acute using the information about type of the
hospitalization in the DNRP.
We classified CRCs with local spread at the time of first
diagnosis as “localized” and those with regional and/or
distant metastases as “non-localized” (see Additional file 1
for codes).
Liver disease
We used the DNRP to identify patients with a diagnosis
of liver disease (see Additional file 1 for diagnosis codes)
before the CRC surgery date. Liver disease patients were
divided into two different cohorts: patients with noncirrhotic liver disease and patients with liver cirrhosis
[15]. Non-cirrhotic liver disease included all liver disease
diagnoses except liver cirrhosis, eg, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients with no history of liver
disease prior to CRC surgery were defined as the comparison cohort.
Comorbidity
We used the DNRP to compute Charlson Comorbidity
Index scores to quantify the burden of comorbidity [16].
The Charlson Comorbidity Index includes 19 diseases,
each assigned a score between one and six. The sum of
the individual scores represents a measure of a patient’s
level of comorbidity. We identified the diseases in the
Charlson Comorbidity Index using ICD-8 and ICD-10
diagnosis codes [17], excluding mild and severe liver disease, CRC, CRC metastases, secondary liver cancers, and
hepatocellular carcinoma. We classified patients as having a low (score = 0), a moderate (score = 1-2), or a high
Montomoli et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2013, 13:66 Page 2 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/13/66

comorbidity level (score ≥ 3). In addition, we obtained
information on hospital diagnoses of non-hepatic
alcohol-related disease, defined as alcohol abuse or
alcohol-related diseases disregarding alcoholic liver disease [18], and presence of gastric or esophageal varices
(see Additional file 1 for relevant codes).
Mortality data
We followed all CRC patients from the date of CRC surgery until death, emigration, or 30 days, whichever came
first. Date of death or emigration was obtained from the
Civil Registration System, which tracks the vital status
and residence of all Danish residents and is updated
daily [19].
Statistical analyses
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute 30-day
mortality after CRC surgery in each patient cohort overall and to consider colon and rectal cancer separately.
Moreover, we stratified 30-day mortality in each cohort
by period of CRC surgery (1996-2002 or 2003-2009) and
timing of admission (acute or elective). We used a Cox
regression model to compute hazard ratios as a measure
of the relative risk (RR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing 30-day mortality after surgery
among CRC patients in each liver disease cohort to that
of the comparison cohort of CRC patients without liver
disease. In the first analysis, we controlled for gender,
age, timing of admission, type of surgery, cancer stage,
comorbidity level, and non-hepatic alcohol-related disease. The proportional hazard assumption was checked
graphically and found appropriate.
Next, to examine the impact of liver disease on 30-day
mortality after CRC surgery in subgroups within each
cohort, we stratified the analysis by gender, age category
(0-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years), comorbidity level
(low, moderate, and high), cancer site (colon, rectum, or
both), stage (localized, non-localized or stage unknown),
timing of admission (acute or elective), type of surgery
(open radical resection, laparoscopic radical resection, or
non-resectional procedure), and non-hepatic alcoholrelated disease (yes or no).
Results
Descriptive data
We identified 39,840 CRC patients undergoing CRC surgery. Of these, 369 (0.9%) had non-cirrhotic liver disease
and 158 (0.4%) had liver cirrhosis. Median age at CRC
surgery was 72 years among patients without liver disease, 69 years among patients with non-cirrhotic liver
disease, and 67 years among those with liver cirrhosis.
Among non-cirrhotic liver disease patients, 60 (16.3%)
had alcoholic hepatitis, 49 (13.3%) had viral hepatitis, 34
(9.2%) had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 4 (1.1%) had
primary biliary cirrhosis, and 222 (60.2%) had other
non-cirrhotic liver diseases.
Of patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease and liver cirrhosis 37% had acute admission, compared to 32% in the
comparison cohort of patients without liver disease
(Table 1). CRC patients with liver disease, especially those
with liver cirrhosis, were more likely to have comorbid
conditions, including non-hepatic alcohol-related disease,
than patients without liver disease (Table 1). The higher
comorbidity level in patients with liver disease persisted
when stratified by cancer stage. For instance, among
patients with non-localized CRC, a high level of comorbidity was found in 4.0% of the patients without liver
disease, in 8.7% of those with non-cirrhotic liver disease, and in 12.0% of those with liver cirrhosis (see
Additional file 2). Furthermore, type of surgery differed,
with non-resectional procedures performed in less than
12% of patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease or without liver disease and in approximately 17% of cirrhotic
patients (Table 1).
Postoperative mortality
Thirty-day mortality was 13.3% in patients with noncirrhotic liver disease and 24.1% among patients with
liver cirrhosis, compared to 8.7% in patients without
liver disease (Table 2). Moreover, survival among patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease seems to differ
from that among patients with liver cirrhosis beyond the
first week after CRC surgery (Figure 1). Compared with
the cohort of CRC patients without liver disease, the
adjusted RR was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.12-1.98) for noncirrhotic liver disease and 2.59 (95% CI: 1.86-3.61) for
patients with liver cirrhosis (Table 2). There was no substantial difference in the impact of liver disease on mortality in the 1996-2002 period and the 2003-2009 period
(data not shown). Notably, the 30-day mortality among
patients with acute admission was as high as 16.3%
for those without liver disease, but increased to 24.1%
among patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease and
35.6% among those with liver cirrhosis. Corresponding
results for CRC patients electively admitted were 5.1%
for patients without liver disease, 6.9% for those with
non-cirrhotic liver disease, and 17.2% for CRC patients
with liver cirrhosis (see Additional file 3).
Thirty-day mortality was higher after colon cancer surgery than after rectal cancer surgery in all cohorts. Still,
both colon and rectal cancer patients with liver disease
had higher mortality than patients without liver disease
(Table 2).
Table 3 shows adjusted RRs of 30-day mortality after
CRC surgery for patients with liver disease stratified into
subgroups. The impact of liver disease on 30-day mortality
after surgery in CRC patients did not differ substantially
between genders or within subgroups of patients with low

and moderate comorbidity levels, different CRC stage, and
elective or acute admission. Nevertheless, for patients with
non-cirrhotic liver disease who underwent CRC surgery at
an age of 60 years or younger, the RR was particularly high
(adjusted RR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.25-5.89). In patients with
non-hepatic alcohol-related disease, the impact of liver disease on mortality was less pronounced for non-cirrhotic
liver disease patients (adjusted RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 0.94-
1.81) than for those with liver cirrhosis (adjusted RR = 3.37;
95% CI: 2.30-4.92). In addition, the impact of liver cirrhosis
appeared more pronounced among patients less than 80
years old as in older patients whereas liver cirrhosis had
little impact on patients undergoing non-resectional procedures (adjusted RR = 1.74; 95% CI: 0.82-3.67). Finally,
the impact of liver disease was limited in patients with a
high comorbidity level for both non-cirrhotic liver disease (adjusted RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 0.62-2.19) and liver
cirrhosis (adjusted RR = 1.47; 95% CI: 0.68-3.15).
Discussion
We found that patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease
or liver cirrhosis had a substantially higher postoperative
30-day mortality after colon and rectal cancer surgery
than patients without liver disease. The association between non-cirrhotic liver disease and postoperative mortality appeared most pronounced among patients aged
60 years or younger. The impact of liver disease on mortality is evident among patients with low and moderate
comorbidity levels, different CRC stage, and different
timing of admission (acute vs. elective). However, among

patients with a high level of comorbidity, we found a less
pronounced impact of liver disease on mortality.
Thus, our data extend former research on postoperative
mortality in patients with liver disease and CRC by using a
population-based sample and, furthermore, particularly by
evaluating the influence of other comorbidities and CRC
stage and site. Only one cohort study based on data from
a single US hospital in 2003 focused on mortality after
CRC surgery in 72 patients with liver cirrhosis [5]. Of
these, 49% had alcohol-related liver cirrhosis and the 30-
day mortality after CRC surgery was 13%. Among patients with the most severe cirrhotic disease, identified
as Child-Pugh class C, the postoperative mortality was
28% [5]. However, RRs could not be estimated because
the study did not include a comparison cohort of patients without liver disease.

Other previous studies included patients undergoing
colorectal surgery for non-CRC indications and did thus
not estimate the impact of liver disease on postoperative
mortality related to CRC alone.
Recently, Meunier et al. reported a 26% in-hospital
mortality among 41 patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing colorectal surgery [9]. Of these patients, 39 had an
alcoholic etiology and 35 received surgery for CRC. The
results are supported by our finding showing that alcoholic liver cirrhosis represents an additional negative
prognostic factor for patients undergoing CRC surgery
[20,21].
Nguyen et al. reported a 29% in-hospital mortality
after colorectal surgery among patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and 14% in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis [10]. After
stratification by acuity of presentation (elective vs.
nonelective), in-hospital mortality was 1.8% vs. 9.1%
among patients without liver cirrhosis, 7.2% vs. 20.9%
among those with liver cirrhosis without portal hypertension, and 18.6% vs. 35.8% among those with liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Consequently, the
impact of liver cirrhosis on mortality was higher among
patients with elective admission (adjusted odds ratio =
3.91; 95% CI: 3.12-4.90) than in patients who had nonelective admission (adjusted odds ratio = 2.40; 95% CI:
2.07-2.79) [10]. Our results confirmed higher mortality
among patients acutely admitted compared with those
with an elective admission, especially among patients
with liver cirrhosis. Yet, we did not show any major difference in adjusted RR between acute vs. elective admission. Finally, Ghaferi et al. analyzed 30-day mortality
after colorectal surgery in about 1,500 patients with
chronic liver disease, including both non-cirrhotic and
cirrhotic diseases, and compared it to postoperative
mortality in a group of 30,000 patients without liver disease. Patients with chronic liver disease had a postoperative mortality of 21.5% compared to an overall mortality
of 3.2% in the control group [6]. Again, these results
confirm that mortality among patients with liver disease –
particularly those with complicated liver cirrhosis – is
higher than in patients without liver disease. Unfortunately,
none of the previous studies included non-cirrhotic liver
disease as an individual group, and our results thus remain
the only source of evidence.
The increased postoperative mortality in patients with
liver cirrhosis may have several explanations. Liver cirrhosis is a complex disease involving different organ systems, increasing the risk of postoperative complications,
and decreasing the patient’s recuperative capacity [4].
Previous studies have identified hepatic coagulopathy as
a risk factor for postoperative mortality in patients with
chronic liver disease undergoing surgery [22-24], as well
as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, elevated creatinine
levels, and other manifestations of portal hypertension
[25]. Furthermore, liver disease is known to modify the
effect of various drugs, attenuate immune function, and
consequently increase the risk of infection and eventually mortality [4,26,27]. Finally, although liver disease, especially liver cirrhosis, has negative systemic effects,
other diseases coexisting with liver disease may also contribute to increased postoperative mortality as suggested
by the less pronounced impact of liver disease in patients with severe comorbidity.
The validity of our findings depends on several factors.
We used population-based registries with complete
follow-up. We had complete data on surgical procedures
and on hospital diagnoses, which minimized selection
and referral bias. Both the DCR data on cancer [12] and
the DNRP [13] data on liver diseases, surgical procedures and comorbidity [17] are of high quality. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that our results were affected by
undiagnosed liver diseases, but this would have caused
us to underestimate the RRs of postoperative mortality.
Moreover, we included patients with both acute and
chronic non-cirrhotic liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, in the non-cirrhotic liver disease cohort. Hence, it
is likely that some patients had completely recovered
from an acute liver disease by the time of surgery. We
may therefore have underestimated the impact of noncirrhotic liver disease on mortality.
Conclusion
Our data show that patients with liver disease, especially
liver cirrhosis, have markedly increased mortality after
CRC surgery compared to patients without liver disease.
Perioperative management of patients with liver disease
should thus be carefully planned in order to minimize
complications and death.
