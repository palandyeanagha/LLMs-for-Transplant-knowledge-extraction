Abstract
Apixaban is a new oral anticoagulant with a specific inhibitory action on FXa. No information is available on the reversal of
the antihemostatic action of apixaban in experimental or clinical settings. We have evaluated the effectiveness of different
factor concentrates at reversing modifications of hemostatic mechanisms induced by moderately elevated concentrations
of apixaban (200 ng/ml) added in vitro to blood from healthy donors (n = 10). Effects on thrombin generation (TG) and
thromboelastometry (TEM) parameters were assessed. Modifications in platelet adhesive, aggregating and procoagulant
activities were evaluated in studies with blood circulating through damaged vascular surfaces, at a shear rate of 600 s21
. The
potential of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs; 50 IU/kg), activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs; 75
IU/kg), or activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa; 270 mg/kg), at reversing the antihemostatic actions of apixaban, were
investigated. Apixaban interfered with TG kinetics. Delayed lag phase, prolonged time to peak and reduced peak values,
were improved by the different concentrates, though modifications in TG patterns were diversely affected depending on
the activating reagents. Apixaban significantly prolonged clotting times (CTs) in TEM studies. Prolongations in CTs were
corrected by the different concentrates with variable efficacies (rFVIIa$aPCC.PCC). Apixaban significantly reduced fibrin
and platelet interactions with damaged vascular surfaces in perfusion studies (p,0.05 and p,0.01, respectively).
Impairments in fibrin formation were normalized by the different concentrates. Only rFVIIa significantly restored levels of
platelet deposition. Alterations in hemostasis induced by apixaban were variably compensated by the different factor
concentrates investigated. However, effects of these concentrates were not homogeneous in all the tests, with PCCs
showing more efficacy in TG, and rFVIIa being more effective on TEM and perfusion studies. Our results indicate that rFVIIa,
PCCs and aPCCs have the potential to restore platelet and fibrin components of the hemostasis previously altered by
apixaban.

Introduction
Despite the better safety profile of newly developed oral
anticoagulants, bleeding is still a safety issue and reversal of their
pro-hemorrhagic effects for emergency procedures remains
unsolved [1]. The lack of effective antidotes to rapidly reverse
the anticoagulant action of new oral anticoagulants is becoming a
reasonable concern for their expected short-term and future
developments [2–4]. Although there is a gradually increasing
emergence of guidelines and expert opinions on how to proceed
for elective and emergency invasive procedures in patients
treated with the new oral anticoagulants [5–9], there is little
evidence to specifically guide the management of the severely
bleeding anticoagulated patient.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e78696

Based on the experience in animal models, activated or nonactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs, PCCs) or
rFVIIa have been proposed as alternatives to counteract the
antihemostatic action of the new anticoagulant therapies [10–15].
Two studies have specifically evaluated the potential of coagulation factor concentrates to reverse the anticoagulant effect of
rivaroxaban and dabigatran in healthy volunteers [16,17]. Results
of the earlier study revealed that PCCs completely reversed the
alterations in the laboratory parameters engendered by rivaroxaban in healthy subjects, but had no effect on the alterations
induced by dabigatran [16]. Results of the later study, indicate that
PCCs may also improve thrombin generation parameters after
dabigatran administration and suggest that lower doses of aPCC
may potentially reverse the alterations in coagulation tests caused
by rivaroxaban and dabigatran [17]. However, an experimental
study has raised some concerns on possible discrepancies between
correction of alterations in laboratory parameters and control of
bleeding. Godier and cols [18] evaluated the ability of rFVIIa and
PCC to reverse the effects of rivaroxaban in a rabbit model of
hepatosplenic bleeding. Both rFVIIa and PCC partially improved
laboratory parameters, but surprisingly none of these factors
reduced rivaroxaban induced-bleeding in their experimental
model. It is possible that current laboratory tests applied to the
evaluation of specific coagulation pathways may have a poor
correlation with clinical bleeding occurring in blood circulating
through damaged vessels.
Apixaban is a new oral anticoagulant with a selective inhibitory
action on FXa [19]. Despite the safety and efficacy of apixaban
demonstrated in clinical trials [20]. There is limited information
on possible strategies for the reversal of its antithrombotic effects in
patients presenting with medical or surgical emergencies. It has
been recently reported that rFVIIa, at very elevated concentrations could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of apixaban in an
in vitro thrombin generation assay [21]. As previously mentioned
for rivaroxaban, there are reasonable doubts on how modifications
in thrombin generation assays correlate with the risk of bleeding or
its control in the clinical situation [16,18]. Investigations of the
mechanisms involved in the antithrombotic action of apixaban
preventing formation of occlusive thrombi at the level of the
damaged vasculature and reversal of its antihemostatic action are
difficult to perform in patients included in clinical trials.
In the present studies, we have explored the effects of
concentrations of apixaban moderately above those achieved at
Cmax after standard approved dosage [22] on platelet and
coagulation mechanisms of hemostasis in humans. Moreover,
our studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different
factor concentrates at reversing the alterations of hemostatic
mechanism induced by apixaban. To accomplish these objectives
a series of laboratory tests were applied that evaluated modifications in the activation of basic mechanisms of coagulation involved
in thrombin generation and thrombus formation. Special attention
was paid to the assessment of modifications on the interactions of
platelet and fibrin deposition on damaged subendothelium in an in
vitro thrombosis model with circulating human blood.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The investigation conforms with the Directive 2010/63/EU of
the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for
scientific purposes; and with the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki. This study has been approved by the
Hospital Clinic Ethical Committee of Clinical Investigation
(registry: 2011/6837). The protocol to isolate rabbit aortas, to be
used as thrombogenic substrata, was also approved by the Animal
Ethical Committee of the University of Barcelona (number
DAAM: 6632).
Participants, blood sampling and routine laboratory
determinations
The study group consisted on 10 healthy volunteers (6 male and
4 female) ages ranging from 22 to 42 years, who agreed to donate
blood samples after written informed consent. Individuals who had
received acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or
antiplatelet drugs within 7 days before blood sampling were
excluded. Blood samples were collected into tubes (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, USA) containing citrate (final concentration
of 13 mM). Normality of routine hematological parameters:
platelet count (normal range, 130–4006109
/L), hematocrit

plasma. Effects of apixaban on thrombin generation were very evident
when activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway was initiated by
tissue factor (A) and milder when activation was initiated through the
intrinsic coagulation pathway by phospholipids (B). All the coagulation
factor concentrates improved the alterations in thrombin generation
induced by apixaban, with rFVIIa being more efficacious than PCCs or
aPCCs at restoring TG altered by apixaban when TG was initiated by
tissue factor (A) and PCCs and aPCCs dramatically enhancing TG peaks
above the levels observed in baseline control experiments when
activation was initiated by phospholipids (B). Tracings represent mean
values form 10 independent experiments. Refer to Tables 1 and 2 for
detailed statistics.

(normal range, 0.36–0.51 L/L), WBC count (normal range, 4–
116109
/L) were confirmed in an Advia 2120 Hematology System.
Similarly, the normality of PT (normal range 11.8–13.9 s), aPTT
(normal range 25–30 s) and fibrinogen levels (normal range 1.5–
4.5 g/L) was confirmed in a BCS TM XP system (Siemens,
Deerfield, IL, USA).
Experimental design
Whole blood samples were used to evaluate modifications in: 1)
viscoelastic parameters of clot formation in whole blood using by
thromboelastometry (ROTEM, Tem International GmbH, Germany); 2) dynamics of thrombin generation in plasma using the
fluorogenic assay Technothrombin TGA (Technoclone GmBH,
Austria); and 3) perfusion studies with whole blood circulated
through damaged vascular segments at an intermediate shear rate
of 600 s21
, equivalent to that found in medium sized cerebral
arteries.
Apixaban (provided by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, USA)
was initially dissolved in ethanol, and subsequently diluted in
saline. Aliquots of apixaban dilutions were added to blood samples
to achieve a concentration equivalent to 200 ng/mL; a concentration twice the average Cmax reached in patients subjected to
treatment with the standard dose indicated for the prevention of
thrombotic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation [22]. A
similar volume of the diluent was added to the control studies.
Coagulation factor concentrates, were tested for their ability to
reverse the anticoagulant action of apixaban at doses approved in
the prescribing information for each concentrate: rFVIIa:
NovosevenH, 270 mg/kg (NovoNordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark);
aPCC, FeibaH 75 U/kg (Baxter); and PCC; and BeriplexH 50 IU/
kg (CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany). Doses of these
concentrates added to blood were calculated assuming that an
standard adult weighing 70 kg will have a blood volume of
4900 mL. Aliquots of the different concentrates were spiked in the
blood samples to evaluate their potential corrective effect on the
different laboratory tests.
Thrombin generation assay (TGA)
Thrombin generation (TG) was evaluated in citrated platelet
poor plasma (PPP) samples with the fluorogenic assay from
Technothrombin TGATM (Technoclone GmBH, Austria) [23,24].
The activation of the coagulation system was triggered by two
different reagents, RCL and RD. RCL consists of low concentration micelles of negatively charged phospholipids containing
recombinant human tissue factor (rTF; 7.2 pM final concentration) and CaCl2 triggering thrombin generation through the
activation of the extrinsic pathway. The RD activating principle
contains negatively charged phospholipids and CaCl2 triggering
thrombin generation through the intrinsic pathway. Fluorescence

generated was evaluated at a wavelength of 390 nm/450 nm
(excitation/emission) and TG parameters calculated using the
Thermo Fluoroskan Ascent Software (Technoclone GmbH). Main
parameters used in our studies were lag phase, maximum
thrombin peak (nM) and the time to achieve this peak [25].
Thromboelastometry studies
We investigated the dynamic thrombelastography of whole
blood coagulation, using the ROTEM Thromboelastometry
Analyser (PentapharmGmbH, Mu¨nchen, Germany) [26]. We
focused on the analysis of the exTEM test (Rotem Thromboelastometry, Biometa, Spain) in citrated blood, recalcified with 6 mM
calcium and using tissue factor as activator. Dynamics of clot
formation were followed for 45 min. Clotting time (CT), the time
(sec) elapsed from the start until the amplitude of the forming clot
reaches 2 mm; clot formation time (CFT), the time (sec) for the
tracing reaching 20 mm of amplitude; and maximum clot firmness
(MCF) the maximum amplitude of the tracing reached (in mm),
were assessed for the purpose of our studies [25].
Perfusion studies
Aliquots of blood were perfused through annular chambers
exposing damaged vascular segments, as thrombogenic substrata.
Aortas were extracted from young female New Zealand rabbits
(2.8–3.0 Kg) previously euthanized according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of the University of
Barcelona (number DAAM: 6632). Endothelial cells were removed
by exposure to a-chymotrypsin, and vessels were cleaned, everted,
cut into segments and maintained in PBS.as previously described
[27,28]. Perfusions studies were performed at a shear rate of 600
s
21
, for 10 min. Citrate-anticoagulated blood was mixed with a
CaCl2/MgCl2, buffer, before it entered the flow chamber, to
achieve physiologic Ca2+ and Mg2+ of approximately 2 mM in the
circulating blood. Perfused vessels were rinsed with 0,15 M PBS,
fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M PBS) at 4uC for 24 h
and processed histologically for further morphometric evaluation.
Fibrin deposition and platelet interactions were evaluated by light
microscopy in histological semi-thin cross-sections of the perfused
vessels. A specifically developed software, automatically classifies
and quantifies platelet and fibrin coverage present in 20 randomly
chosen microscopic fields in non-adjacent sections [29]. Overall
platelet interactions with the exposed vascular surfaces were
evaluated as a percentage of total surface of the vessel covered by
platelets (% CS). Presence of larger platelet masses (aggregates of
more than 5 mm in height) were also expressed as a percentage of
the surface vessel (% Agg). Similarly, the presence of fibrin in the
same microscopic fields was also morphometrically quantified and
expressed as a percentage of fibrin coverage (% F) and mean area
of fibrin masses deposited on the subendothelium (F Area as mm2
).

Statistics
Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean

Statistical analysis was performed with raw data using ANOVA
after Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for Gaussian distribution.
The SPSS statistical package 17.0.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was
used for all analyses. Initial levels of statistical significance were
established at p,0.05.
Results
Influence on thrombin generation
As shown in Figure 1a and Table 1, apixaban at 200 ng/mL
caused evident alterations in the kinetics of TG initiated by tissue
factor and phospholipids (RCL reagent). Alterations induced by
apixaban were characterized by a statistically significant delay in
the lag phase (34.365.5 min vs. 15.562.3 min in control
experiments; p,0.01), and a dramatic reduction in the maximum
thrombin peak achieved during TG (75,8623 nM vs.
349.7630 nM in control experiments; p,0.01). Recombinant
FVIIa and aPCCs partially restored the alterations in the kinetics
of TG caused by apixaban, reducing the prolongations in the lag
phase (p,0.01 vs. apixaban alone) and enhancing the maximum
thrombin peak observed during TG (p,0.05 vs. apixaban alone).
PCCs shortened the lag phase and enhanced TG initially altered
by apixaban, though differences did not achieve the levels of
statistical significance.
Effects of apixaban in TG initiated by phospholipids (RD
reagent) were less evident (Figure 1b and Table 2). Apixaban
treatment caused a moderate prolongation in the time to reach a
peak concentration of thrombin (10.461.1 min vs. 8.560.8 min
in control studies, p,0.05), but did not cause significant alterations
in the lag time or maximum thrombin peak. Addition of aPCCs
and PCCs to plasma from blood anticoagulated with apixaban
normalized the prolongation in the time to reach a peak in TG
after apixaban and significantly enhanced the maximum thrombin
peak with values that doubled those observed after apixaban
(999.3633.2 nM and 979.9630.7 nM; p,0.01 vs. 474.16
13.6 nM in apixaban treated samples). Recombinant FVIIa did
not show a relevant influence in the kinetics of TG previously
altered by apixaban.
Modifications in viscoelastic properties of clots
As illustrated in Figure 2, apixaban modified the dynamics of
clot formation in ROTEM experiments, but had little impact on
the maximum clot firmness (MCF). As summarized in Table 3,
apixaban caused a statistically significant prolongation of CT
(357.9652.8 sec vs. 165.6619.7 sec in control studies; p,0.01)
and CFT (923.863 sec vs. 262.9639.4 sec in control studies).
Addition of rFVIIa or aPCCs significantly reduced the prolongation in CT caused by apixaban (p,001 for both concentrates vs.
treatment with apixaban alone). CTs achieved after addition of
rFVIIa or aPCCs to apixaban anticoagulated blood (95.16
15.9 sec and 102.069.8 sec, respectively) were below those
observed in control experiments (165.6619.7 sec). Corrections
of alterations induced by apixaban in ROTEM parameters were
less evident with PCCs.
Modifications in CFT after reversal therapies followed the
tendencies mentioned for CT, with differences in CFT after
rFVIIa and aPCCs reaching levels of significance at p,0.05. All
the concentrates tested, rFVIIa, aPCCs and PCCs, moderately
enhanced MCF with respect to corresponding values in apixaban
anticoagulated samples (62.362.1 mm, 62.760.8 mm, and
56.961.6 mm respectively, vs. 40.267.7 mm after apixaban;
p,0.05).
Perfusion Studies
Apixaban reduced platelet and fibrin components of hemostasis in perfusion studies (Figure 3 and Table 4). Results of the
morphometric evaluations performed on damaged vessels
perfused with blood incubated with apixaban revealed statistically significant reductions in: the percentage of the vessel
covered by platelets (% CS: 12.161.8 vs. 20.963.0 in control
experiments; p,0.01), and fibrin (% F: 17.264.1 vs. 52.2611.6
in control experiments; p,0.05). Apixaban interfered with the
formation of large platelet aggregates (% Agg) causing statistically
significant reductions (% Agg: 8.561.3 vs. 15.062.6 in controls
studies, p,0.01). The cross sectional average area of fibrin
masses deposited on the vessel surface was markedly reduced
after apixaban (p,0.05 vs. control experiments).
PCCs and aPCCs did not show a favorable action at improving
the reduction of platelet interactions with the subendothelium
observed after apixaban. Recombinant FVIIa partially counteracted the reductions in platelet interactions induced by apixaban
(% CS: 17.962.7 vs. 12.161.8, p,0.05; and % Agg: 14.462.7 vs.
8.561.3, p,0.05; in both cases vs. apixaban treated blood).
Addition of rFVIIa, aPCCs or PCCs restored levels of fibrin
deposited on the subendothelium, initially reduced by apixaban, to
levels observed in control samples (p,0.01 vs. apixaban treated
blood). The ability of rFVIIa, aPCCs and PCCs to improve fibrin
generation was also evidenced by their ability to increase the cross
sectional areas of fibrin masses initially reduced by apixaban
(p,0.05 for rFVIIa and PCCs; and p,0.01 for aPCCs).
Discussion
In the present study we have applied a series of experimental
approaches to human blood to characterize the effects of apixaban
on platelet and coagulation parameters. Apixaban interfered with
thrombin generation, altered viscoelastic parameters during clot
formation and reduced platelet and fibrin formation on damaged
vessels. Alterations in coagulation parameters induced by apixaban were variably compensated or even reversed by the different

Restoring Hemostasis after Apixaban

coagulation factor concentrates used in our studies, though
responses to these concentrates were not homogeneous throughout
all tests.
Reversal of the alterations in hemostasis caused by the new
oral anticoagulant agents is a subject of interest, with most of the
evidence published previously resulting from experimental
animals or derived from anecdotal cases [1,8,15,30,31]. Several
studies have applied ex vivo and in vivo approaches to investigate
the reversal of the anticoagulant action of dabigatran and
rivaroxaban, using coagulation factor concentrates already used
for the control of the anticogulant action of classic vitamin K (Vit
K) antagonists, with successful results [13,16,17]. Evaluation of
the kinetics of thrombin generation (TG) has been used to assess
the effects of reversal strategies on the alterations in coagulation
caused by new oral anticoagulants [16,17,21]. Our studies with a
TG test based on the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT)
assay, revealed important variations between results that were
clearly related to the activating reagents. One of the reagents
(RCL) contains a low concentration of phospholipids micelles
and recombinant human TF, while the other (RD) is composed
only of phospholipid micelles without TF. Effects of apixaban
were very obvious when TG was activated by TF and
phospholipids through the extrinsic pathway and less evident
when using the phospholipid based activator triggering the
intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Interestingly, the effectiveness of
reversal therapies at restoring TG differed strongly depending on
the activator with very mild responses to PCCs with the TF
containing reagent, and with explosive responses to PCCs and
aPCCs with in the phospholipid-based activator. Which TG tests
reflects more precisely the impact of the new oral an
anticoagulant, how modifications of the different parameters
relate to a potential bleeding risk and whether modification in
these parameters have a predictive value in the correction of
excessive anticoagulation is an object of debate [18,32,33]. In a
recent study, Dinkelaar and cols [34] investigated the applicability of PCCs to the reversal of rivaroxaban induced alterations
on thrombin generation. These authors concluded that responses
to different TG tests were clearly dependent on the assay
conditions and the amount of PCC required for normalization of
TG depended on the concentration of TF and the presence of
phospholipids. Our results would further exemplify the relevance
of assay conditions for TG tests and may hel reconciling
discrepancies between results in TG assays and correction of
experimental bleeding in animal models [18].
Apixaban altered the dynamics of clot formation in ROTEM
assays as confirmed by significantly prolonged clotting times and
minimally affected clot firmness. All the concentrates tested in our
studies reduced the prolongation in clotting times and significantly
enhanced the mean clot firmness in this assay. Our present results
suggest that ROTEM could be applied for a rapid assessment of
the effects of excessive anticoagulation caused by elevated doses of
apixaban and tentatively for the assessment of its reversal by
different factor concentrates.
Current coagulation tests, including TG and ROTEM assays,
evaluate specific coagulation pathways or endpoints, but do not
provide information on the coordinated interactions between
platelets and fibrin that ultimately warrants effective control of
hemostasis. The previous rationale could explain why corrections
of laboratory parameters, including TG, observed after factor
concentrates do not correspond with control of bleeding symptoms
observed by other investigators [18,35]. The problem with many
of the currently available coagulation assays is that they often
disregard rheological conditions that regulate cellular and plasma
interactions with damaged vascular surfaces resulting in the
initiation and consolidation of hemostasis.
In an attempt to circumvent the potential limitations of current
coagulation tests, our investigational approach included evaluation
of thrombus formation on damaged vascular surfaces in studies
performed with blood maintained under specific flow conditions.
An advantage of this methodology is that studies can be performed
in vitro or ex vivo spiking blood with therapeutic agents without
exposing patients or volunteers to additional risks. Studies in
perfusion devices have helped to improve basic and clinical
knowledge on the effectiveness of hemostatic strategies in
transfusion medicine [36], including effects of platelet concentrates
[37] and rFVIIa [38,39]. Our studies with this technique reveal
that apixaban significantly reduced both, platelet and fibrin
deposition on perfused vessels. Impairments in fibrin formation
were effectively corrected by the different concentrates with minor
differences among them. Interestingly, only rFVIIa was able to
fully normalize levels of platelet deposition. Previous studies from
our laboratories recognized that rFVIIa could locally enhance TG
and improve the recruitment of platelets into forming aggregates
[28].
Recommendation on the more adequate strategy for reversal of
the anticoagulant effects of apixaban should be based on a
balanced evaluation of severity of the bleeding situation, the
efficacy of the concentrates chosen, and the possible side effects
derived from our reversal intervention. Despite the fact that
rFVIIa showed the most effective action at correcting platelet and
fibrin formation in perfusion studies, there is concern regarding is
potential thrombogenicity when this recombinant factor is used
out of the approved indications [40]. Activated PCCs have already
shown an enhanced risk of thrombosis when used in patients with
hemophilia [41] and this risk would be expected to increase if
applied to patients with an underlying prothrombotic condition. In
our study, four-factor PCCs showed a clear potential reversal in
the majority of the tests including perfusion studies. There is wide
experience with the use four-factor PCCs in the reversal of the
anticoagulant effect of Vit K antagonists and rates of thrombotic
complications seem to be acceptable [42]. Thus, PCCs appear as
the first line reversal agent for apixaban until other most specific
agents demonstrate efficacy and safety in the clinical setting.
In summary, we demonstrate that alterations in hemostasis
caused by apixaban are variably compensated or even reversed
by the different factor concentrates tested in our studies. Effects
of these concentrates at reversing alterations of platelets and
fibrin formation were assessed in experiments with blood flowing
through damaged vessels an experimental setting that resembles
the bleeding situation. Further experimental studies would be
required to find appropriate doses for the different concentrates
that could be evaluated in specific clinical trials.

Methods S1 Perfusion technique. Studies in perfusion devices
have been useful to improve basic and clinical knowledge on the
effectiveness of hemostatic strategies in transfusion medicine,
including effects of platelet concentrates and rFVIIa. Aliquots of
blood are perfused through annular chambers exposing damaged
vascular segments, as thrombogenic substrata, at a fixed shearrate. This supplemental file provides visual information on this
methodology, from the extraction of the rabbit aorta to be used as
thrombogenic substrata, to the final morphometric analysis on
cross-sections of the perfused vessels.
