ABSTRACT
Introduction: the availability of transplantable livers is not sufficient to fulfill the current demand for grafts, with the search for
therapeutic alternatives having generated different lines of research,
one of which is the use of decellularized three-dimensional biological
matrices and subsequent cell seeding to obtain a functional organ.
Objective: to produce a decellularization protocol from rabbit
liver to generate a three-dimensional matrix.
Methods: a combination of physical, chemical (Triton X-100
and SDS) and enzymatic agents to decellularize rabbit livers was
used. After 68 h of retrograde perfusion, a decellularized translucent
matrix was generated. To evaluate if the decellularization protocol
was successful, with the extracellular matrix being preserved, we
carried out histological (light microscopy and scanning electron
microscopy) and biochemical (DNA quantification) studies.
Results: the decellularization process was verified by macroscopic
observation of the organ using macroscopic staining, which revealed
a correct conservation of bile and vascular trees. A microscopic
observation corroborated these macroscopic results, with the hematoxylin-eosin staining showing no cells or nuclear material and the
presence of a portal triad. Wilde’s staining demonstrated the conservation of reticulin fibers in the decellularized matrix. In addition,
scanning electron microscopy revealed a preserved Glisson’s capsule
and a decellularized matrix, with the DNA quantification being less
than 10 % in the decellularized liver compared to control. Finally,
the time taken to develop the decellularization protocol was less
than 96 hours.
Conclusions: the proposed decellularization protocol was correct, and was verified by an absence of cells. The hepatic matrix
had preserved vascular and bile ducts with a suitable three-dimensional architecture permitting further cell seeding.
Key words: Decellularized liver. Biological scaffolds. Transplant.
INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is currently the only therapeutic
alternative for acute liver failure, terminal liver disease or
metabolic disorders originating in the liver. However, due
to a shortage of donors, many patients who are on the waiting list never receive liver transplantation and others with
indication of the graft have no access to waiting lists. Moreover, the complexity of the function of the liver makes it
impossible to use artificial systems to provide temporary
hepatic support as for example in patients with renal insufficiency. 
Alternatives to transplantation, such as the non-biological
support systems proposed in the literature, have precise and
limited indications (1,2). In other way, hepatocyte seeding,
via injection into the splenic or portal veins, does not even
offer a temporary solution as a bridge to transplantation, due
to early death of hepatocytes with the remaining number
being incapable of correcting any abnormalities or rescuing
patients from liver failure. In facts, hepatocyte primary cultures lose their typical morphologies and function within a
few days via dedifferentiation or epithelial-mesenchymal
transition. Furthermore, other complications inherent to this
technique, such as portal thrombosis, hypertension and pulmonary embolism, have also been reported(1,3,4).
Three-dimensional biological scaffolds are commonly
used in reconstructive surgery. Vracko (5) describes the
importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in maintaining the liver structure and regeneration and recent developments show the ability of the ECM to maintain the hepatocyte phenotype and function (1,4,6). Related to this,
another line of research is the creation of three-dimensional

scaffolds of ECM through a decellularization process of
the liver, where hepatocytes, stem cells or other cells can
be seeded to differentiate into hepatocytes in order to
achieve a transplantable human liver. Researchers have proposed different models of decellularization to obtain a biological scaffold to allow subsequent cell seeding (1,3,4,7-
11). The decellularization is obtained through the use of
different physical and/or chemical mechanisms to break
down organ cells and leave only the ECM, which then provides support to posterior cell seeding (12).
The aim of this paper is to provide a liver decellularization technique in rabbit liver and to evaluate the outcome
of this method.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For this study, six New Zealand male rabbits of 2,100 ±
120 g were subjected to a total hepatectomy with preservation of the vasculature. One rabbit was assigned for a
study of anatomy of the region, another being used for liver
histological control and the quantification of the DNA. The
livers of the four remaining rabbits were incorporated into
the decellularization protocol. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, as approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Universidad Nacional de
Córdoba, Argentina, and efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering and the number of animals used. 
Surgical technique
Anesthesia was performed by injecting with 35 mg/kg
ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine intramuscularly (IM) as a
single dose. The rabbits were placed in the supine position
with their legs fixed.
Surgery: By median incision which was later extended
to the right hemithorax. Identification was made of the
mesenteric vein and an intravenous injection was carried
out using 1,000 IU heparin.
Identification of the portal triad was performed and attached
by a ligature, identification and dissection of the infra-hepatic
inferior caval vein was carried out. The adhesions of the liver
were removed and the incision was extending into the thorax.
Identification, dissection, ligature and cutting of the suprahepatic inferior caval vein were performed along with a total
hepatectomy (Figs. 1 and 2)
Insertion of a catheter or teflon cannula in the suprahepatic or infra-hepatic inferior caval vein respectively was
made, which was fixed with a prolene 4/0 stitch and perfusion was started with PBS solution for washing. 
The organ was placed in PBS solution with crushed ice
for transport and subsequent freezing at -80 °C.
Decellularization protocol
The liver was frozen in 500 ml PBS for 24 h at -80 °C
and later thawed at room temperature to aid cell lysis.
The catheter or teflon cannula inserted into the inferior
caval vein was connected to a peristaltic pump and retrograde perfusion cycles was started at a rate of between 6
and 10 ml/min as follows: first, the liver was washed for 4
hours with 0.02 % trypsin and 0.05 % EDTA in deionized
water, before being perfused with 3 % Triton X-100 and
0.05 % EGTA in PBS. Three washes of two hours each
were performed, followed by a wash of 16 hours and later
3 washes of 2 hours each. Next, we used the ionic detergent
SDS (0.1 % in deionized water), which was perfused for
4 hours, and then the organ was perfused with Triton X100 and EGTA (3 % and 0.05 % in PBS) for 14 hours. Subsequent successive washes were performed with PBS and
deionized water to remove cell remains and detergents (1
hour of deionized water, 2 washes with PBS for 1 hour, 30
minutes of deionized water, and two washes for 30 min
with PBS). Finally, the organ was perfused for 1 hour with
4 % ethanol in PBS to disinfect the organ.
Microscopic evaluation
– Light microscopy. For evaluation of the effectiveness
of the decellularization, the two histological staining
techniques, hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and the latter
Wilde silver staining was used to evaluate reticular
fibers (collagen type III). These stainings were performed on the decellularized and control livers.

DNA quantification
The amount of DNA was quantified using a method
described by Laird et al. (13). Briefly, 25 mg of tissue from
the control and decellularized livers were homogenized in
a solution containing 0.25 % trypsin and 1 mM EDTA in
deionized water. The homogenate was incubated at 37 °C
with constant stirring for 4 hours. Then, the cell lysis was
continued with a solution containing 2 % SDS, 5 mM
EDTA, 200 mM NaCl and 100 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5 for
24 h at 55 °C. The DNA extraction was carried out in isopropanol and later dissolved in a solution of 10 mM TrisHCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The amount of DNA was
determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm.
RESULTS
The surgical technique was carried out without difficulties, and it was straight-forward to identify the anatomical
elements. Cannulation of the inferior caval vein was performed twice in a supra-hepatic way and twice in an infrahepatic manner, the first with a K33 catheter and the second
with a teflon cannula No. 16. The amount of PBS perfused
for cleaning the liver prior to freezing was 210 ml.
The decellularization technique was performed as
described previously on four rabbit livers and the total time
taken was 94.30 hours, including 24 hours of freezing and
5 hours of thawing at room temperature (Figs. 3 and 4).
Staining of the biliary tree on two rabbits was performed
with methylene blue through the gallbladder puncture,
which revealed the existence of the bile ducts shown in Fig.
5. A mixture of methylene blue with agarose was perfused
through the inferior caval vein in two other rabbits and a
good vascular staining was observed (Fig. 5).
From the histological viewpoint, when the controls stained
with HE and those with reticulin were compared using decellularized preparations, a complete disappearance of the cell
pattern and the total absence of nuclei could be observed,
with reticulin staining showing the presence of reticular fibers
without cellular remains in the decellularized liver (Figs. 6
and 7, respectively). Furthermore, HE staining revealed the
presence of a portal triad in the decellularized liver.
The SEM showed that the morphology of Glisson’s capsule was similar to that of the liver control (Fig. 8), and
revealed a complete decellularization of the liver parenchyma compared to control (Fig. 9). The Student’s t-test for
unpaired samples showed that the DNA quantification was
significantly different (t = 4.151, p < 0.001) between the
decellularized matrix values (1958 ± 579 ng/mg of tissue)
and the control ones (192 ± 53 ng/mg) (Fig. 10).

DISCUSSION
An insufficient availability of organs for transplantation
has led to the search for alternative options to address this
problem. Since the publication of successful heart decellularization by Ott et al. (14) and a posterior report on liver
by Uygun et al. (8), several groups have begun to develop
bioengineering techniques to obtain as a final aim a transplantable organ from a three-dimensional ECM scaffold,
first involving organ decellularization, and later, the seeding
of cell lines. The objective of the decellularization of the
liver is to obtain a scaffold of ECM with a suitable architecture, contained in an intact Glisson’s capsule and vascular
and biliary structure preserved as much as possible (4,8). 
The techniques and materials used for this process are
constantly being reviewed in order to achieve a greater cell
lysis, which preserves the ECM and decreases the time
required to carry it out. In the literature, different protocols
have been modified and combined in different way, with
respect to the physical and chemical agents used as well as
the time of application (12,15). The detergent is basically
chosen by considering the characteristics of the organ or of
the tissue to decellularize, e.g. decellularization of the tendon
requires a different detergent than that for the lung or liver
(12). To date, liver decellularization protocols have involved
perfusion of a combination of detergents: Triton X-100 and
SDS were used in the portal or caval vein, with a rat being
the liver donor. However, Uygun et al. perfused 0.1 % SDS
(8), while Shupe and his colleagues used increasing concentrations of 0.1 % Triton X-100 followed by SDS (11).
Moreover, Soto-Gutierrez et al. first used an enzymatic
agent: trypsin and then 3 % Triton X-100 (4). When we previously tested these protocols (4,11) a complete decellularization was not obtained. Therefore, we eliminated the perfusion with only SDS, as described in several reports because

this technique results in a good decellularization by successfully removing cellular remains, but implied a higher
loss of growth factors and of liver architecture (12) required
for the process of recellularization. 
The new protocol described in the present investigation
involved an initial treatment with trypsin, which allowed
a better transfer from the detergents to the tissue, then perfusion was carried out with 1% SDS and finally with Triton
X-100. Thus, the decellularization was performed using a
combination of enzymatic treatment (trypsin), followed by
an ionic detergent (SDS), and finally a nonionic one (Triton
X-100). This strategy of using three different agents in the
decellularization process minimized the contact time of
each of these agents with the ECM, and also removed cells
and their remains by three different mechanisms, thus faciliting a greater decellularization (12). Nevertheless, we wish
to make it clear that changing the animal species implies a
change in the size of the organ to be decellularized, which
in turn means developing a new protocol as it complicates
the entry of detergents into the tissue as well as the removal
of cell remains, due to the increased size of the organ. 
The evaluation of the results of decellularization of the
livers is carried out by light microscopy (LM) with HE
staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the
presence of cell nuclei using the DAPI technique and/or
DNA quantification by the determination of base pairs
(bp). A successful decellularization is considered to have
taken place when fragments are less than 300 bp according
to some authors, while others have proposed that these
should be less than 200 bp. In this way, this would not generate any inflammatory response in the host (4,16,17). The
search for DNA traces in commercial scaffolds revealed
cellular remains and DNA content, although these would
not be able to trigger an inflammatory response. Moreover,
the amount of Gal alpha 1,3 was also insufficient to trigger
acute rejection, although it is known that Gal alpha 1,3
cause rejection in xenotransplantation (16,18). Additionally, various studies, some of them on apoptotic porcine
cells, have eliminated the possibility of the presence of
DNA traces of retroviruses in biological scaffolds for xenotransplantation being able to transmit a disease to the host
(19-21).
Our results have shown an encouraging decellularization
by observing the HE staining in the light microscopy to corroborate the presence of a preserved ECM. Likewise, the
staining for reticulin fibers (collagen type III) demonstrated
their presence in the decellularized liver. We also observed
the presence of a complete portal triad, an important fact as
the preservation of bile ducts is a desired feature and is difficult to achieve in this process. The presence of a preserved
bile tract enables posterior reconstruction with bile epithelial
cells (4), in the same way that a preserved vascular network
permits subsequent seeding with endothelial cells. 
The microscopic visualization of the bile ducts was verified by macroscopic observation of the bile tree through
the puncture and staining of the gallbladder. Furthermore,
the vascular tree was preserved after the decellularization
process, as evidenced by the perfusion of methylene blue
in 2 % agarose via the caval vein.
As noted here and in agreement with other authors, we
consider that the use of combinations containing trypsin,
SDS, Triton X-100 associated with EGTA, after freezing
at -80 °C is the best alternative to date to achieve an acceptable decellularization in a liver of about 100 g, although
the appearance of new products or the incorporation of
other techniques, such as sonication or electroporation, may
be included in the protocol in the future (15,22). Most decellularized livers reported by other researchers came from
rats, when involved decellularize sizes of up to 10 times
lower than those of rabbits. Therefore, if a liver of the size
of rabbit can be recellularized, it provides a transplantable
cell mass with a subsequent better chance of recovery of
the liver functions in patients (7). A surgical technique preserving the vascular and bile elements and Glisson’s capsule
as well as the insertion of the teflon cannula or catheter
carefully permits a suitable perfusion in different lobes of
the rabbit liver. In agreement with other authors, we performed a retrograde perfusion (caval-portal flow), due to
it seeming to be better than anterograde perfusion (portalcaval flow), which was proposed by other researchers (3,4).
Similarly, a peristaltic pump with controlled flows ranging
from 6 to 10 ml/min ensured a ECM with a conserved architecture. The decellularization protocol proposed here produced successful results with HE staining, a technique for
collagen III, SEM and DNA quantification. In addition, the
time required for decellularization, including freezing time,
was less than 96 hours.
In conclusion, although the results are positive, there are
still some points to be investigated. One of these is to verify
the presence of growth factors in our ECM, because the
posterior recellularization process requires their presence
(23). These factors are essential to determine the behaviour,
adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation and survival of seeded cells (1,6,24). In a decellularization protocol
with features similar to those described here, the remaining
amount of growth factors was around 30-50 %, thereby
allowing ECM recellularization with hepatocytes (4). Finally, and focusing on the recellularization, the efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the culture is necessary in
order to obtain a useful and functional organ.
