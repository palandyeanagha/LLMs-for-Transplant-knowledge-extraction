Abstract
Ultrasonography (US) is a major, sustainable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance method as it provides inexpensive, 
real-time, and noninvasive detection. Since US fndings are based on pathological features, knowledge of pathological features 
is essential for delivering a correct US diagnosis. Recent advances in US equipment have made it possible to provide more 
information, such as malignancy potential and accurate localization diagnosis of HCC. Evaluation of malignancy potential is 
important to determine the treatment strategy, especially for small HCC. Diagnosis of blood fow dynamics using color Doppler and contrast-enhanced US is one of the most defnitive approaches for evaluating HCC malignancy potential. Recently, 
a new Doppler microvascular imaging technique, superb microvascular imaging, which can detect Doppler signals generated 
by low-velocity blood fow, was developed. A fusion imaging system, another innovative US technology, has already become 
an indispensable technology over the last few years not only for US-guided radiofrequency ablation but also for the detection 
of small, invisible HCC. This article reviews the evidence on the use of ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound with 
Sonazoid for the practical management of HCC.

Introduction
Ultrasonography (US) is a simple and noninvasive real-time 
imaging method available worldwide. Thus, it is the most 
frequently used imaging tool for diagnosing liver diseases. 
US is important not only for surveillance but also characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most patients 
with HCC show liver cirrhosis (LC) with poor liver function 
and a high recurrence rate. Thus, early detection of HCC, 
especially in patients with LC, is important for timely treatment, which minimizes damage and preserves liver function.
While both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) require contrast agents to detect 
small HCCs in most cases, US can detect most HCCs even 
without contrast agents. The use of contrast agents for CT 
and MRI is restricted in elderly patients with declining renal 
function. In addition, US is not associated with radiation 
exposure concerns. As US involves repeated examinations 
over a long period, it is suitable for the surveillance of HCC. 
Of course, using contrast agents improves the sensitivity 
and specifcity of US; therefore, this method is useful for 
evaluating the malignancy grade of HCC, which is important 
when determining a treatment plan. Moreover, many new 
technologies such as fusion have improved our ability to 
diagnose HCC.
This article reviews the evidence on use of US and contrast-enhanced US with Sonazoid (Sonazoid CEUS) for the 
diagnosis and practical management of HCC.
B‑mode fndings
In abdominal US, both detection and characterization play 
a role in diagnosing focal liver lesions. B-mode fndings of 
HCC are the basis of diagnostic ultrasound, and the diferential diagnosis is based on tumor shape, border and contour, 
tumor margin, and intratumoral and posterior echo [1]. The

Terminology and Diagnostic Criteria Committee (TDCC) 
of Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine (JSUM) summarizes HCC features of B-mode fndings in detail (as presented in Table 1). These fndings are useful for the diferentiation of focal liver lesions.
In addition, it is also important to understand US characteristics of HCC. Patterns of internal echoes of HCCs vary 
(hyperechoic pattern 12–38%, hypoechoic pattern 23–54%, 
mosaic pattern 17–38%) [2–5] depending on the size of the 
tumor [6].
The internal echoes of HCCs smaller than 10 mm are 
almost hypoechoic (low level) or isoechoic, and the number of such low-level echoes increases with cell density. 
When tumor growth occurs as multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, fatty change is most frequently observed (36.4%) at a 
tumor diameter of 10–15 mm [7], and internal echoes of 
these HCCs are hyperechoic. When the diameter of an HCC 
reaches 20 mm or more, typical US patterns such as the 
“mosaic pattern,” “peripheral sonolucency (halo),” “lateral 
shadow,” and “posterior echo enhancement” can be recognized [8–11]. Findings of “mosaic pattern,” “posterior echo 
enhancement,” and “lateral shadow” show a higher accuracy (≥70%) and specifcity (≥90%) in diagnosing HCC 
than metastatic liver cancer. With an increase in the size of 
the tumor, the frequency of observation of these US fndings increases. However, these typical US fndings are less 
frequently observed in smaller HCCs. The “halo sign” corresponds to the thin fbrous capsule of the HCC [12–15] 
(Figs. 1a, b). Correspondence between the sonographic halo 
sign and a histological capsule has been reported to be 90.1% 
[16]. The “lateral shadow,” which is a linear US feature 
observed at the edge of a tumor, represents the refraction 
that occurs when ultrasound passes through spherical tissue 
and the surrounding tissue at diferent speeds (Figs. 1c, d).

Posterior echo enhancement arises posterior to any lesion 
that attenuates sound less than the surrounding tissue; the 
intensity of the transmitted ultrasound beam is relatively 
preserved distal to the lesion [3]. However, posterior echo 
enhancement is not specifc to HCC; this fnding is also 
associated with hemangiomas and cystic lesions.
In addition, the macroscopic confguration is important 
for the prediction of recurrence and prognosis in patients 
with HCC. In the classification proposed by a research 
group from Japan, the macroscopic confguration of HCC 
is divided into fve types: small nodular type with indistinct margins, simple nodular type, simple nodular type 
with extranodular growth, confuent multinodular type, and 
infltrative type [17, 18]. The potential for malignancy tends 
to change in accordance with the progression of the macroscopic confguration [11, 18].
Color/power Doppler
Color Doppler can help visualize blood fow signals inside 
and at the margin of a tumor, and the direction of blood 
fow can be determined on the basis of color. Color Doppler helps identify not only nutrient vessels but also volume of blood fow. When it is necessary to detect the blood 
fow orthogonal to the ultrasonic beam or to evaluate low 
fow velocity, power Doppler is efective. Previously, power 
Doppler could increase the detection sensitivity, but it could 
not detect the blood fow velocity or direction. Now, with 
advances in technology, power Doppler can also detect the 
direction of blood fow.
JSUM’s TDCC also summarizes the HCC features of 
Doppler fndings [1] (as presented in Table 2). In most HCCs 
smaller than 2 cm, blood fow is low and appears as lines or 
dots inside or around the tumor. Typical color Doppler features of a small HCC include aferent continuous waveform 
signals, which refect a feeding portal fow [19]. When the 
diameter of a tumor is 2 cm or more, the blood fow volume 
increases. Especially in a moderately diferentiated HCC that 
has a capsule and shows expansive growth, basket-pattern 
blood fow is observed. This pattern represents a fne network of arterial vessels that surrounds the tumor nodule [11, 
20, 21]. Typical color Doppler features of an advanced HCC 
(massive type) include aferent pulsatile waveform signals 
associated with intratumoral continuous waveform signals 
and eferent continuous waveform signals [20].
Recently, a new Doppler microvascular imaging technique known as superb microvascular imaging (SMI; Canon 
Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan), which can distinguish 
Doppler signals generated by low-velocity blood fow from 
those generated by tissue movement, was developed. This 
technique can reduce motion artifacts and simultaneously 
provide a high level of sensitivity and imaging resolution 
at a high frame rate. As a result, ultrasound examiners 
using this technique can clearly observe low-velocity capillary blood fow without the need for a contrast agent. This 
increases confdence in the assessment of the nature of the 
tumors (Fig. 2) [22].
Similar technology, such as high-defnition color (HDC; 
GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), has also become 
available and can display very small tumor vessels (Fig. 3). 
Although there are still few papers on the evaluation of HCC 
using these new Doppler microvascular imaging techniques, 
these are already being used in clinical practice in Japan. 
Thus, these blood fow display technologies may be used 
more in the future for HCC diagnosis using ultrasonography.
Contrast‑enhanced ultrasonography 
(contrast agent, techniques)
Contrast agent and time phase
The frst-generation agent Levovist (SH U 508A; Schering 
AG, Berlin, Germany) has been introduced not only in Japan 
but also in other countries [23]. However, the parenchymaspecifc contrast yielded by Levovist is efective only when 
imaging is performed at high acoustic power using a high 
mechanical index (MI), and the efect is transient [24]. 
Therefore, it cannot be used for real-time examinations in

the late phase, and visualization of the whole liver is limited 
to a single scan [25–27].
SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy), widely available in 
Europe and China, enables continuous real-time imaging 
with a low MI [27–34]. SonoVue is minimally phagocytosed 
by reticuloendothelial cells (Kupfer cells) [35, 36]. Parenchyma-specifc contrast images can be seen only 3–5 min 
after injection of SonoVue. Thus, its use is not approved in 
Japan [27].
In Japan, we can use only the second-generation ultrasound contrast agent Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Amersham, 
UK); it is a lipid-stabilized suspension of perfuorobutane 
gas microbubbles, available since January 2007 [27]. Sonazoid is associated with a low incidence of side efects [37]. 
Because Sonazoid is metabolized in the lungs, it has no contraindication for patients with renal dysfunction or iodine 
allergy. Sonazoid CEUS is usually performed at a low MI. 
Because a low MI facilitates the prevention of microbubble 
destruction, obtaining perfusion images of hepatic lesions in 
the vascular phase using Sonazoid CEUS is easier. Sonazoid 
CEUS at a low MI also enables the user to scan the whole 
liver in the late phase, facilitating the detection of perfusion defect images of hepatic malignant lesions. With the 
employment of both the vascular and late phases, Sonazoid 
CEUS facilitates the characterization of liver tumors, histological grading of HCC lesions, and guided ablation of 
unresectable HCCs [27].
In humans, the reason for the enhancement of liver parenchyma and the non-enhancement of malignant tumors in the 
late phase using Sonazoid CEUS is not completely understood; however, it is thought to be a result of phagocytosis 
by reticuloendothelial (Kupfer) cells due to the adherence 
of microbubbles to the hepatic sinusoids and tumor vascular 
spaces or due to recirculation of Sonazoid microbubbles. 
Because malignant tumors contain few or no reticuloendothelial cells, they appear as perfusion defects in the late 
phase. The recommended dose of Sonazoid is 0.015 mL/
kg. However, with an increase in the quantity of contrast 
agent, the ultrasound signal of the background liver may be 
enhanced simultaneously with that of the tumor at the time

of imaging, which may make diagnosis difcult. This dose 
was determined on the basis of clinical research conducted 
at the initial introduction of this agent. Due to advances in 
US techniques, the image quality of Sonazoid CEUS is suffcient at doses lower than the recommended dose. Therefore, most authors injected a decreased dose of Sonazoid to 
evaluate the vascularity of liver lesions, especially HCCs 
[27, 38–41]. With regard to Sonazoid CEUS, time phases 
may be categorized into three subphases: arterial, portal, and 
post-vascular (Kupfer) phases [42]. The arterial phase is the 
period from the point of arrival of perfubutane microbubbles into the hepatic artery to the point when the portal vein 
and the hepatic artery intersect in the time-intensity curve 
(TIC). The portal phase is the period from the point when 
the hepatic artery and the portal vein intersect in the TIC to 
the point when the portal vein and the parenchyma intersect 
in the TIC. The post-vascular (Kupfer) phase (from 10 min 
after injection) starts when the parenchyma of the liver is 
enhanced after the disappearance of the contrast efect from 
the vasculature. JSUM’s TDCC also summarizes the HCC 
features of CEUS fndings [1] (as presented in Table 3).
Defect reperfusion imaging
Diferentiation of necrotic and viable areas is sometimes 
difcult in the post-vascular (Kupfer) phase as both appear 
as perfusion defects. To solve this problem, Kudo et al. reinjected Sonazoid into HCCs that had previously shown a 
perfusion defect in the post-vascular (Kupfer) phase [43]. 
They devised a method called defect reperfusion imaging, which confirms blood flow into the defects. Using 
this method, Hatanaka et al. reported that Sonazoid CEUS 
showed a higher sensitivity (95.4%) and accuracy (94.7%) 
in the diagnosis of hepatic malignancies than contrastenhanced CT (sensitivity 85.2% and accuracy 82.3%) (both 
P<0.005) [44].
Contrast‑enhanced low‑MI tissue harmonic imaging
Contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) exploits the nonlinear 
oscillations of microbubbles in contrast agents that produce 
harmonic overtones of the original sound wave [45, 46]. 
Several contrast harmonic software applications have been 
developed for CEUS examination, with the most promising 
techniques being phase inversion (PI) and amplitude modulation (AM) [47, 48]. These techniques usually sacrifce spatial and time resolution to improve sensitivity and specifcity 
of contrast signals.
Tissue harmonic imaging (THI), which is the most commonly used conventional B-mode imaging modality, is a 
form of native harmonic imaging that provides a better 
signal-to-noise ratio and reduced side lobe artifacts than the 
other types [49–52]. As this THI technique is based on the

PI technique, it must be used for CEUS. as well. Contrast 
low-MI THI, as a CEUS method, is a technique that simply 
lowers the MI value from more than 1.0 in general B-mode 
to less than 0.3. Therefore, contrast low-MI THI can ofer an 
overlay view of conventional THI and contrast imaging [53]. 
This new CEUS method, also called low-MI harmonic imaging, is a technique that has been enabled by the recent evolution of ultrasound devices. It allows us to observe vessels in 
the vascular phase at high spatial and time resolutions using 
conventional B-mode US techniques such as compounding 
and time smoothing (Fig. 4c). Contrast low-MI THI using 
Sonazoid is also useful in the post-vascular (Kupfer) phase 
due to its high spatial and time resolutions (Fig. 5); however, the sensitivity is slightly lower than that of amplitude 
modulation, the most sensitive CEUS mode. Thus, low MI 
contrast THI is efective at providing detailed resolution, 
image quality, focal abnormality margin sharpness, and penetration for hepatic imaging.
High‑MI intermittent imaging
Numata et al. performed intermittent imaging at the rate 
of 2 frames/s in coded harmonic angio (CHA) mode at a 
high MI (0.7–1.2) to depict the features of tumor vascularity in the late phase (>5 min). They called this method 
“high MI intermittent imaging.” When they used high-MI 
intermittent imaging to scan a tumor lesion, the Sonazoid 
microbubbles within and around the tumor may have been 
destroyed immediately, and the tumor vessels and tumor 
enhancements were possibly seen because of back fow into 
the tumor vessels and vascular spaces. In contrast, if the 
tumor became necrotic as a result of transcatheter arterial 
embolization, ablation therapy, or spontaneous necrosis, the 
lesions would exhibit neither tumor vessels nor enhancement when scanned using high-MI intermittent imaging. 
The advantages of this method include the acquisition of 
enough information from patients with multiple lesions. This 
method is regarded as an alternative to additional injection 
of contrast agents when tumor vascularity requires further 
evaluation, and it can be used when there is a lack of medical 
personnel or to save time [27, 38].
High-MI Doppler methods, such as advanced dynamic 
fow (ADF), may be used for evaluating HCC in the postvascular (Kupfer) phase with the highest sensitivity and 
specifcity, because microbubbles accumulated in the liver 
are destroyed by high-MI ultrasound exposure [54, 55]. The 
CEUS method can be performed only once as it destroys 
almost all the bubbles around the tumor on its frst usage. 
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to destroy the 
bubbles accidentally. However, recent improvements have 
made it possible to perform these high-MI Doppler methods 
using only simple operations (Fig. 4f).
Diagnosis of malignancy grade
Evaluation of malignancy potential is important for determining the treatment strategy, especially for small HCC. 
Although B-mode US can refect the macroscopic morphology of HCC, only one study has investigated the relationship 
between B-mode ultrasonograms and the histological diferentiation grade in patients with small HCC [56]. Moribana 
et al. classifed small HCC into two groups ultrasonographically: type 1 (with halo) and type 2 (without halo). Type 2 
was classifed into three subgroups: type 2a, homogenous 
hyperechoic; type 2b, hypoechoic with a smooth margin; 
and type 2c, hypoechoic with an irregular or unclear margin. 
They showed that the malignancy potential of type 2a was 
the lowest and that of type 2c was the highest [56]. Their 
study is simple and important; however, many more studies 
have demonstrated the utility of CEUS in the assessment of 
malignancy.
Evaluation in arterial phase
Details regarding the vascularity of an HCC are important, 
because blood supply and the grade of HCC malignancy 
are closely related. Hayashi et al. found a strong correlation 
between the intranodular arterial and portal supply evaluated 
by CT during hepatic arteriography and CT during arterial 
portography, and the malignancy grade of the hepatocellular nodules. In other words, the intranodular portal supply 
relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma observed by 
CT during arterial portography was decreased, whereas the 
intranodular arterial supply revealed by CT during hepatic 
arteriography was frst decreased during the early stage 
of hepatocarcinogenesis, and then increased according to 
the malignancy grade of the nodules [57]. Thus, detection 
of hypervascularity in the arterial phase is important for 
assessing the malignancy grade of HCC. The sensitivity of 
CEUS in detecting the tumor vascularity of HCC nodules is 
equal to [58] or higher than [59] that of contrast-enhanced 
CT. Numata et al. demonstrated that the detection rate for 
hypervascularity of early HCC using CEUS (32.7%, 17/52) 
was signifcantly higher than that obtained using contrastenhanced CT (21.2%, 11/52) (P<0.005) [59]. Maruyama 
et al. also showed that CEUS detected hypervascularity in 
26% (7/27) of the tumors characterized as non-hypervascular 
using contrast-enhanced CT [60].
Evaluation in Kupfer phase
Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) (ferucarbotran [Resovist]; Bayer, Osaka, Japan) is a tissue-specifc MRI contrast 
agent similar to Sonazoid; it is phagocytized by the liver

Kupfer cells. SPIO-MRI imaging refects the number of 
Kupfer cells and is useful for estimation of the histological 
grades of HCCs [61]. Inoue et al. compared the fndings 
of Levovist-CEUS and SPIO-MRI and found a correlation 
between the fndings of these methods in the post-vascular 
(Kupfer) phase. Post-vascular phase ratios (postcontrast 
echogenicity of the tumorous lesion/postcontrast echogenicity of the adjacent liver) declined as the nodules became 
less diferentiated. The median values of the post-vascular 
phase ratios of dysplastic nodules, well-diferentiated HCCs, 
and moderately and poorly diferentiated HCCs were 1.01 
(range 0.87–1.23), 0.75 (range 0.40–1.35), and 0.44 (range 
0.07–0.61), respectively. The post-vascular phase ratios of 
dysplastic nodules and well-diferentiated HCCs were signifcantly higher than those of moderately and poorly diferentiated HCCs (both P<0.001). However, the post-vascular 
phase ratios did not difer signifcantly between dysplastic 
nodules and well-diferentiated HCCs (P=0.02) [12].
Korenaga et al. compared the diagnostic ability of Sonazoid CEUS and SPIO-MRI in the post-vascular (Kupfer) 
phase using a quantitative parameter referred to as the 
Kupfer phase ratio (postcontrast echogenicity of tumorous lesion/postcontrast echogenicity of non-tumorous liver 
parenchyma).
These were nearly as signifcant as the post-vascular 
phase ratios used by Inoue et al., although there were diferences in the numerical values depending on the diferences 
in the echogenicity of their equipment. The mean values of 
the Kupfer phase ratios of well, moderately, and poorly differentiated HCCs were 0.836±0.174 (range 0.595–1.280), 
0.434±0.125 (range 0.213–0.621), and 0.303±0.091 (range 
0.196–0.447), respectively. The Kupfer phase ratio using 
Sonazoid CEUS also decreased with a decrease in HCC differentiation [40]. In the Kupfer phase with Sonazoid CEUS, 
all moderately and poorly diferentiated HCCs showed a 
hypoechoic pattern and were detected as perfusion defects; 
most (69.2%) of the well-diferentiated HCCs showed an 
isoechoic pattern [40]. Sonazoid CEUS is also useful for 
estimating the histological grades of HCCs.
Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic 
acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) has the properties of an extracellular and hepatocyte-specifc contrast agent, and has recently 
played a leading role in the diagnosis of HCCs [62, 63]. 
Ohama et al. compared the histological enhancement patterns of the post-vascular (Kupfer) phase of Sonazoid CEUS 
and the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced 
MRI, as well as uptake of Sonazoid and Gd-EOB-DTPA 
by HCC [64]. They evaluated the uptake of Sonazoid by 
TruAgent detection 30 min after administration of Sonazoid 
using Sonazoid enhancement indices [log (Doppler signals 
in the tumorous lesion) – log (mean of Doppler signals in 
the non-tumorous area]. TruAgent detection, the technique 
used to detect Doppler signals from the microbubbles of 
contrast agents, is based on the loss of correlation caused 
by the destruction of bubbles with high mechanical indices, 
ranging from 0.8 to 1.0. The median values of the Sonazoid 
enhancement indices were also decreased with a decrease 
in HCC histological diferentiation: DNs 0 (range − 1.10 to 
3.20); hypovascular well-diferentiated HCCs 1.05 (range 
5.65 to 3.60); hypervascular well-differentiated HCCs 
− 2.60 (range, − 0.82 to 0.40); moderately to poorly diferentiated HCCs − 5.00 (range, − 8.60 to 2.20). In contrast, 
there was no diference in Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake across 
stages of HCC diferentiation.
In addition, Kupfer images of Sonazoid CEUS can also 
be used to evaluate the gross HCC types that are closely 
related to malignancy potential. Hatanaka et al. classifed 
HCC using Sonazoid CEUS into three types based on the 
macroscopic classifcation of the Liver Cancer Study Group 
of Japan [17, 65]: single nodular (SN) type, single nodular with extranodular growth (SNEG) type, and confuent 
multinodular (CMN) type. The ability of Sonazoid CEUS 
to correctly depict the gross HCC types was assessed. The 
sensitivity, specifcity, and accuracy of Sonazoid CEUS 
were 96%, 80%, and 90%, respectively [66]. The diagnostic 
accuracy was 86.9% (53/61) for Sonazoid CEUS and 65.6% 
(40/61) for CECT [67].
Recently, a multicenter Japanese study showed that 
Kupfer phase images in Sonazoid CEUS could also predict hypervascularization of hypointense borderline lesions 
detected in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPAenhanced  MRI  [HR: 3.684, 95% confidence interval: 1.798–7.546, P=0.0004]. The cumulative incidence of 
hypervascularization of borderline lesions was 18%, 37%, 
and 43% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively [68].
Maximum intensity projection
Micro-fow imaging (MFI), which is one of the CEUS methods for maximum intensity projection (MIP), is an accumulative imaging technique that reveals blood vessels after a 
fash with high-transmission power ultrasound exposure. In 
this modality, after the fash generated by the fash-replenishment sequence (FRS), the microbubbles in the scanning 
area are completely destroyed by the high energy output 
from the ultrasound beam. In succession, the area is re-perfused with microbubbles from the adjacent blood vessels, 
and the microbubbles are visible, because the imaging mode 
quickly shifts into a low-MI mode. Through maximumholding image processing, the trace of the microbubbles 
in a temporal dimension can be clearly depicted, refecting 
the vascularity in the scanning area [32]. HCC is known to 
undergo changes in vascular structure as it progresses. MIP 
can help visualize this fne vascular structure without an 
angiography of the liver, and the spatial resolution of MIP 
remains higher than that of SMI (Fig. 6).

Sugimoto et al. reported the feasibility of diagnosis of the 
histological diferentiation of HCC using MIP with SonoVue 
CEUS. Briefy, the maximum-hold processing began immediately after the burst scan. The burst scan consisted of highMI (1.3–1.6) scanning of fve frames. Low-MI (0.16–0.30) 
scanning begun immediately after the MI burst scanning to 
visualize fresh microbubble contrast agent fowing into the 
scanning volume. The maximum intensity holding sequence 
started at the same time as the fash-replenishment low-MI 
imaging, which maintained the maximum brightness level 
on each pixel and displayed a persistent vision. They classifed the image patterns as follows: normal, cotton, vascular, 
and dead-wood. In the normal pattern, the border between 
tumoral and non-tumoral regions is slightly indistinct, and 
the vascular architecture in the tumoral region is similar to 
that in the adjacent non-tumoral region. In the cotton pattern, 
the border between the tumoral and non-tumoral regions is 
distinct, but tumoral blood vessels are not clearly visualized, 
and the tumor appears pale as a whole as if it was stained. In 
the vascular pattern, tortuous and meandering tumoral blood 
vessels are clearly visualized, and the tumor is imaged as a 
whole. In the dead-wood pattern, tumoral blood vessels are 
clearly visualized, but they gradually taper of and are suddenly interrupted. HCCs showing normal and cotton patterns 
are classifed as well diferentiated; those showing vascular 
or dead-wood patterns are classifed as moderately or poorly 
diferentiated; the sensitivity, specifcity, and accuracy of 
these assessments were found to be 85%, 92.7%, and 90%, 
respectively [69].
We also examined the clinical utility of the malignancy 
grading system to detect histologically advanced HCC 
using the MIP pattern. Our malignancy grading system 
was used to evaluate HCC histological grade with a combination of two key features of Sonazoid CEUS, i.e., Kupfer 
imaging and MIP pattern. Kupfer imaging was classifed 
as an isoechoic or hypoechoic pattern. MIP patterns were 
evaluated using MFI and were classifed as one of the following three patterns: fne (tumor vessels are not clearly 
visualized and only fne vessels are visualized), vascular 
(tumor vessels are clearly visualized), and irregular (tumor 
vessels are thick and irregular). An advantage of our MIP 
classifcation is the simplicity of its classifcation scheme. 
If some irregular vessels can be detected, the case is classifed as an “irregular pattern”. Similarly, if some tumor 
vessels thicker than the surrounding ffth or sixth branch 
can be detected, the case is classifed as a “vascular pattern”. Other cases were classifed into a “fne pattern,” 
including cases in which the diference between the tumor 
vessels and surrounding hepatic parenchyma could not be 
detected. These MIP patterns of “fne,” “vascular,” and 
“irregular” are nearly equivalent to, respectively, Sugimoto’s MIP patterns of “normal or cotton,” “vascular,” 
and “dead-wood.” Simplifcation to three classifcations 
has also made classifcation easier, especially for “normal 
or cotton” and “cotton or vascular” patterns, which are 
sometimes difcult to distinguish. Based on the combination of MIP patterns and Kupfer imaging, we were able to 
classify HCC into four grades: Grade 1 (iso-fne/vascular), 
Grade 2 (hypo-fne), Grade 3 (hypo-vascular), and Grade 
4 (hypo-irregular) (Table 4). Reportedly, the distribution 
of moderately and poorly diferentiated HCCs was as follows: Grade 1, 4% (1/24); Grade 2, 52% (15/29); Grade 3, 
85% (44/52); and Grade 4, 100% (16/16). In this study, all 
patients with irregular patterns had either moderately or 
Table 4 Classifcation of MIP 
and Kupfer imaging. The MIP 
pattern is classifed as 1 of the 
following 3 patterns: (1) fne 
pattern: where tumor vessels 
were not clearly visualized 
and only fne vessels were 
visualized; (2) vascular pattern: 
where tumor vessels were 
visualized clearly; and (3) 
irregular pattern: where tumor 
vessels were thick and irregular.

poorly diferentiated HCC. In contrast, no patients with 
isoechoic patterns in Kupfer imaging had moderately or 
poorly diferentiated HCC. Hence, combining Kupfer 
imaging with MIP patterns, we were able to histologically 
detect advanced HCC with a higher accuracy, and also 
predict portal vein invasion in 72 resected HCCs: Grade 1,

spatial and time resolutions (c). In the post-vascular (Kupfer) phase, 
the tumor is in the hypoechoic area by amplitude modulation, which 
is the mode most sensitive to contrast-enhanced ultrasound (d). We 
could also delineate the tumor with the same sensitivity by low MI

Grade 4, 67% (8/12) [70].
Takada et al. also reported the irregular MIP pattern, 
using Sonazoid CEUS, to be the most important independent risk factor for a poor outcome after successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with early stage HCC 
(hazard ratio: 8.26, 95% confdence interval: 2.24–30.3, 
P=0.002) [71].
As these study results demonstrate, MIP patterns are useful for estimating the malignancy potential of HCC. However, there remain some limitations to MIP analysis. First, 
the accuracy depends on the location, because it cannot 
be assessed without being clearly depicted. Second, there 
remains the possibility that key images cannot be detected, 
as only two-dimensional images of MIP patterns instead of 
the entire tumor are detectable. Therefore, these cases may 
be classifed as being of a less malignant grade.
Evaluation of treatment
Maruyama et al. summarized in detail the utility of Sonazoid CEUS for HCC treatment [41]. RFA is the most frequently used local treatment for HCC. Sonazoid CEUS could 
increase RFA applicability (from 21% [n=95 cases] to 32% 
[n=219 cases]) [72] and reduce the number of RFA sessions (from 1.49±0.76 [historical control] to 1.33±0.45) 
[73]. Using Sonazoid CEUS, Dohmen et al. demonstrated 
an increase in the non-local recurrence rate from 66.4 to 
85.3% 2 years after RFA [74]. A recent study showed that 
Sonazoid CEUS performed 3 h after RFA could show the 
outline of the coagulated tumors in 78/87 patients (89.7%), 
and that the 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate was very 
low (2.3%) with a 5-year cumulative survival rate of 58.4% 
[75]. However, we should know two signs that indicate the 
risk of recurrence. The frst sign is a linear-shaped positive 
enhancement, which was observed in the RFA-treated area 
in 33 lesions (18.4%) using Sonazoid CEUS; 17 of them 
were followed-up with no treatment, and three of these 17 
(17.6%) showed local tumor progression that corresponded 
to linear enhancement [58]. The second sign is gradual 
intra-tumor enhancement in the pre-treatment early arterial 
phase, which indicates potential risk of distant recurrence 
after RFA [76].
Sonazoid CEUS is also useful for assessing therapeutic 
efects in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), 
another important procedure for treating HCC. Xia et al. 
demonstrated that detection rates of residual tumors using 
Sonazoid CEUS 1 week after TACE were better than those 
using CT (58.1% vs. 39.5%, P<0.001) [77]. A subsequent 
prospective study confrmed this result; it showed that the 
detection rate of residual HCC nodules using Sonazoid 
CEUS 1 day after TACE was signifcantly higher than that

using contrast-enhanced CT 1 month after TACE (95.7% vs. 
78.7%, P<0.05) [78].
The frst oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany), is recommended for unresectable advanced HCC. 
However, it is an expensive drug associated with certain 
adverse events. Therefore, evaluation of the early response is 
required. Sugimoto et al. demonstrated that tumor perfusion 
parameters were statistically signifcant on the basis of the 
area under the time-intensity curve (AUC) during wash-in 
on day 14, the most relevant factor indicating tumor response 
(P=0.0016) [79]. Shiozawa et al. also examined the mean 
arrival time of Sonazoid using parametric imaging before 
and 2 weeks after treatment and suggested that an extended 
mean arrival time improves the median survival time (arrival 
time extend group 792 days, arrival time not extend group 
403 days) [80].
Cost‑efectiveness
Surveillance of HCC using US improves the prognosis of 
patients [81–83], and it is a cost-efective method for evaluating patients with HCV-related cirrhosis [84, 85], even after 
a sustained virologic response to therapy [86]. The costefectiveness of CEUS for HCC surveillance in patients 
with LC was also reported [87]. Using the Markov model, 
we demonstrated that CEUS surveillance could cost efectively extend the expected survival time. Sensitivity analysis 
showed that the annual incidence of HCC and sensitivity of 
CEUS were two critical parameters. When the annual incidence of HCC was more than 2% and/or the CEUS sensitivity was more than 80%, the incremental cost-efectiveness 
ratio was less than the commonly accepted threshold of $US 
50,000/QALY, indicating cost-efectiveness. However, economic conditions could vary over time, and the substantial 
efect is yet to be evaluated in each country.
Innovation
Fusion images
Fusion imaging is a novel technology that accurately combines real-time US images with real-time CT or MRI volume data and displays them on the same monitor, side by 
side. This means that a clinician can visualize both registered multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images on the same 
monitor to make diagnostic or procedural decisions in real 
time. The fusion imaging system is composed of a positionsensing unit mounted on an ultrasound unit and an electromagnetic feld transmitter. Some of the latest probe models 
are equipped with a position sensor.
US is the frst choice for percutaneous interventional 
procedures as it provides real-time, noninvasive, repeatable, and non-radiation-based imaging. However, this 
process can be difcult if the ideal US scanning plane is 
diferent from that of the CT or MR image. Moreover, 
breathing and displacement and deformation of the abdominal structures due to pressure from the US probe can 
afect the process of mental registration. Lesions located 
deep in the most distal regions can be blurred and difcult 
to identify. In addition, US is afected by the presence of 
bone, gas, and fat. Real-time fusion imaging capitalizes 
on the strengths of all imaging modalities simultaneously. 
In addition, it allows for images acquired by means that 
are not afected by such issues, such as CT scanning and 
MR imaging, to be placed alongside or overlaid on the 
acquired images for better detection of lesions. US fusion 
imaging can also be associated with advanced US imaging 
techniques such as color/power Doppler, SMI, and CEUS 
for better localization and characterization of the lesions 
to be treated [88, 89].
Some hepatic tumors that can be visualized by CT or 
MR cannot be seen on US due to their small size, their location, or their echogenicity. In these cases, fusion imaging has 
been shown to make HCC nodules more conspicuous and to 
increase the feasibility of percutaneous RFA of HCCs not 
visible on conventional US [88, 90, 91] (Fig. 6). If HCCs 
remain non-visible after fusion imaging, anatomical landmarks surrounding the lesions can be used to guide correct 
needle placement [88]. Thus, with the use of fusion imaging, a larger population can beneft from US-guided ablation procedures instead of undergoing a CT-guided ablation 
or a major surgical operation, which are more invasive and 
expensive techniques. The average procedure duration for 
a US and CT/MRI fusion-guided liver biopsy was approximately half of that of a CT-guided liver biopsy (31.63 min 
vs 61.67 min, P=0.003) [92]. Fusion imaging can also 
minimize false-positive lesion detection during US-guided 
RFA and consistently improve the detection of HCCs, especially when these are smaller than 20 mm [93]. The ability 
of fusion imaging to reduce false positives also applies to the 
evaluation of local tumor progression after RFA and TACE 
[94].
In recent years, next-generation microwaves systems, 
such as the Emprint Ablation System with Thermosphere 
Technology (Covidien, Boulder, CO), have been favored 
for their ability to consistently provide high intratumoral 
temperatures, fast ablation times, and large ablation volumes.[95]. Microwave ablation (MWA) is less susceptible 
to the heat sink efect because of its higher temperatures and 
shorter ablation times. Therefore, MWA needs to be used 
more carefully than RFA for its complications such as bile 
duct injuries, vascular damage, and visceral damage (colon, 
stomach, intestine, gallbladder, kidney, abdominal wall). To

prevent such complications, a more accurate assessment of 
the predicted ablation area is necessary for MWA.
Recently, we have also been able to use some new 3D 
display methods, such as 3D-GPS marker, which is one function of volume navigation (V Nav; GE Healthcare, Chalfont 
St. Giles, UK). This 3D-GPS marker may easily change the 
size and shape of an ellipse. Using this function, operators 
may make more accurate simulations of how they ablate 
the tumor with sufcient margins in three dimensions. By 
visually demonstrating the predicted ablation area in three 
dimensions, the operator can grasp the positional relationship between the ablation area and major blood vessels or 
other organs prior to ablation (Fig. 7b).
In addition, by combining a virtual needle-tracking system (VirtuTRAX; CIVCO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA, 
USA) in which a magnetic sensor is attached to the distal 
tip of an ablation needle, a 3D-GPS marker may provide a 
more accurate prediction of the ablation area immediately 
prior to ablation [96]. This needle-tracking system is able 
to virtually visualize the tip of the needle and the needle 
path on US. Thus, the combined use of this needle-tracking 
system and 3D-GPS marker at the tip of the RFA or MWA 
needle may successfully visually demonstrate the predicted 
ablation region (Fig. 7c). A signifcantly bowed needle, however, may cause the virtual tract not to accurately match the 
actual needle. This problem may be solved using a more 
rigid needle such as a MWA needle.
It should be noted that the positional information derived 
by these 3D-GPS markers is not entirely consistent due to 
respiratory fuctuations, among other factors.
Computer‑aided diagnostic (CAD) systems
CEUS is useful for HCC diagnosis, but diferential diagnosis 
is sometimes difcult. When microbubble destruction and 
variations in tumor behavior and liver enhancement occur, 
experienced sonographers (or radiologists) are required to 
characterize tumors reliably and accurately; however, the

very small, detection was also difcult with only B-mode ultrasound. 
However, using fusion technology, a high echo tumor could be visualized (a). Since the reconstructed magnetic resonance image can 
be enlarged and reduced freely, it is possible to search for lesions 
with ultrasound, while grasping the whole image with MRI (a). The 
3D-GPS marker may easily change the size and shape of an ellipse. 
Using this function, operators may make more accurate simulations 
of how they ablate the tumor with sufcient margins in three dimensions (b). In addition, by combining a virtual needle-tracking system, 
a 3D-GPS marker may provide a more accurate prediction of the 
ablation area immediately prior to ablation. This needle-tracking system is able to virtually visualize the tip of the needle and the needle 
path on US. Thus, the combined use of this needle-tracking system 
and 3D-GPS marker at the tip of the RFA or MWA needle may successfully visually demonstrate the predicted ablation region (c)

number of sonographers (or radiologists) experienced in 
performing and interpreting CEUS studies is limited, and 
interobserver agreement remains an issue. Computer-aided 
diagnostic (CAD) systems are a potential solution to these 
problems.
Generally, CAD systems extract features from the 
B-mode and/or CEUS videos and train machine-learning 
algorithms to associate these features with the known diagnoses to predict the diagnosis of unknown lesions. Sugimoto 
et al. proposed a method for classifying focal liver lesions 
into fve classes (well-diferentiated HCC, moderately differentiated HCC, poorly diferentiated HCC, liver metastasis, and hepatic hemangioma) using four artifcial neural 
networks (ANNs) for CAD analysis of focal liver lesions 
with Sonazoid CEUS. The accuracies of classifying hepatic 
hemangioma, HCC, and liver metastasis were 93.3%, 98.6%, 
and 84.8%, respectively. They also classified historical 
malignancy by CAD analysis using ANNs. The accuracies 
of classifying well-diferentiated, moderately diferentiated, 
and poorly diferentiated HCC were 82.9%, 88%, and 100%, 
respectively [97].
Kondo et al. also proposed an automatic classifcation 
method based on machine learning for the interpretation of 
focal liver lesions on Sonazoid CEUS. This method yields 
spatial and temporal features in the arterial phase, portal 
phase, and Kupfer phase, as well as max-hold images. The 
lesions are classifed as benign or malignant and again as 
benign, HCC, or metastatic liver tumor using support vector machines (SVM) with a combination of selected optimal 
features. Experimental results from 98 subjects indicated 
that benign and malignant classifcation showed 94.0% sensitivity, 87.1% specifcity, and 91.8% accuracy, and that the 
accuracies of the benign, HCC, and metastatic liver tumor 
classifcations were 84.4%, 87.7%, and 85.7%, respectively 
[98].
Reports on CAD are already available, and the practice is 
expected to be applied in clinical practice in the near future. 
There is no doubt that the introduction of deep learning will 
improve its accuracy. It will be necessary to develop a new 
diagnostic system to generate CAD-based results that enable 
experts to make reliable judgements.
Conclusion
This comprehensive review clearly demonstrates the 
magnitude of the importance of US in the management of 
HCC. US examination of HCC has evolved signifcantly 
due to advances in equipment. First, B-mode has resulted 
in a marked improvement in image quality. In addition, 
using hepatobiliary phase contrast-enhanced MRI with 
Gd-EOB-DTPA and fusion technology, an innovative USassisted system, even small lesions that were otherwise 
difcult to detect can be reliably analyzed. The visualized 
HCC can be evaluated for the very delicate hemodynamics 
of the tumor without the use of contrast agents by utilizing 
color Doppler, power Doppler, or SMI, which continue 
to evolve. Furthermore, when a contrast agent is used, a 
contrast pattern for each characteristic time phase can be 
evaluated, so that a more accurate diagnosis can be made. 
Although there remain certain parts that are difcult to 
visualize on ultrasonic examination, the high temporal and 
spatial resolution of US cannot be achieved using CT or 
MRI. Therefore, the usefulness, cost-efectiveness, and 
safety of US are indispensable. In the future, CAD will be 
incorporated into ultrasonic examinations. However, since 
tumor shape and blood fow evaluation remain unchanged, 
US will continue to play a central role in the diagnosis of 
HCC.
