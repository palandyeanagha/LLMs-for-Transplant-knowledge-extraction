Abstract
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (2019 coronavirus disease,
COVID-19) since December 2019, from Wuhan, China, has
been posing a significant threat to global human health. The
clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients with
COVID-19 have been widely reported. Increasing evidence
has witnessed the frequent incident liver injury in COVID-19
patients, and it is often manifested as transient elevation of
serum aminotransferases; however, the patients seldom have
liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis, unless preexisting advanced liver disease was present. The underlying
mechanisms of liver injury in cases of COVID-19 might
include psychological stress, systemic inflammation response, drug toxicity, and progression of pre-existing liver
diseases. However, there is insufficient evidence for SARSCoV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury in
COVID-19 at present. The clinical, pathological and laboratory characteristics as well as underlying pathophysiology and
etiology of liver injury in COVID-19 remain largely unclear. In
this review, we highlight these important issues based on the
recent developments in the field, for optimizing the management and treatment of liver injury in Chinese patients with
COVID-19.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1–3
The SARS-CoV-2 infection and related coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), has aroused great concern worldwide.
The global outbreak of this disease is significantly bigger
than the prior pandemic of SARS and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS). Within 3 months, SARS-CoV-2 spread
rapidly from Wuhan city to the entire country of China, and
then into more than 120 countries worldwide. Up to March 14,
2020, a total of 81,021 cases of COVID-19 with 3194 deaths
in China and 63,016 cases with 2212 deaths outside of China
have been confirmed. Unfortunately, the global numbers of
both infected patients and fatalities will continue to grow in
the future months because no specific effective antiviral
therapies nor vaccine have been identified.4
With the number of cases increasing in China, abnormal
liver function test results have been observed in some
patients with COVID-19, making this organ the most frequently damaged outside of the respiratory system.5–7
However, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of
Chinese patients with COVID-19 might be changing with
time, and the clinical-pathological manifestations and mechanism of the liver injury in COVID-19 remain largely unclear.8
This review will summarize these important issues based
on the recent developments in the field, for optimizing the
management and treatment of COVID-19 patients with liver
injury.
General clinical characteristics and outcomes of
Chinese patients with COVID-19
The clinical features of COVID-19 are similar to SARS and
MERS, with typical manifestation of pneumonia and acute
respiratory infection symptoms (Fig. 1). Most patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection usually have mild symptoms and
good prognosis, with the exception of those involving patients
with older age and underlying health conditions. Guan et al.9
extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland China
through January 29, 2020. They reported that the median
age of the cases was 47 years, and 41.9% of the patient
population was female. The most common symptoms were
fever (88.7%) and cough (67.8%). However, nausea or vomiting (5.0%) and diarrhea (3.8%) were present but uncommon. The median incubation period was 4 days, and 23.7%
cases had at least one coexisting comorbid condition. Some
patients rapidly developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary
edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute
respiratory failure, or multiple organ failure. The primary
composite end-point occurred in 67 cases (6.1%), including
5.0% patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 2.3%

patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and
1.4% patients who died.
Recently, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention published the largest case series to date of
COVID-19 in mainland China. Among 72,314 case records
(updated through February11, 2020), 44,672 (62%) were
classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19, 16,186 (22%) as
suspected cases, 10,567 (15%) as clinically-diagnosed
cases, and 889 (1%) as asymptomatic cases. In total, 87%
of the cases represented ages 30 to 79 years-old. Among
44,415 confirmed cases, 14% cases were classified as severe
and 5% as critical. There were 1023 deaths (2.3%) among
the 44,672 confirmed cases, all having involved critical cases.
The case-fatality rate (CFR) was 8.0% in those aged 70 to 79
years and 14.8% in those aged 80 years and older. The CFR
was elevated among those with underlying diseases (10.5%
for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for mellitus diabetes, 6.3%
for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and
5.6% for cancer).10 However, the information regarding coexisting liver disease and liver-related morbidity and mortality
were not available in either article.
Furthermore, in a systematic review of 3470 patients with
COVID-19, 11.5% were admitted to ICU, while the overall
CFR was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of
Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significantly higher ICU
admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%). Also, CFR attributed to
COVID-19 in Hubei was significantly higher than that of nonHubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%).11
Characteristics of liver injury in Chinese patients with
COVID-19
Laboratory changes of liver function test in patients
with COVID-19
According to the diagnostic criteria, all hospitalized cases of
COVID-19 were laboratory confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection
by nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract samples. On admission, most of the patients with COVID-19 had lymphocytopenia,
leukopenia, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein. Severe
patients usually had blood oxygen saturation of <93%, and
partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen
ratio of <300. Severe hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure
usually occurred in the critical cases. Furthermore, the severe or
critical patients still had laboratory characteristic findings of
septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction or failure, such as
liver injury, renal injury, and heart injury (Fig. 2).
Abnormal liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 was first
reported by Chen et al.2 Among 99 cases with COVID-19 from
Wuhan, 43 cases (43.4%) had increased serum levels of
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), and lactic dehydrogenase. Most of them had mild elevation of aminotransferase, and only one case had very high levels
of aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L and AST of 1445 U/L).
However, no case was reported with the features of obvious
intrahepatic cholestasis or liver failure. Holshue et al.12 reported
the first Chinese case of COVID-19 confirmed in the USA with
detailed information of liver function tests. The patient was
admitted to hospital on day 4 of illness and progressed to pneumonia on day 9 of illness, and his serum levels of ALT increased
from 68 to 203 U/L and AST increased from 37 to 89 U/L. In
another report, among 12 severe patients with COVID-19 from
Shenzhen, only 1 had abnormal liver enzymes (ALT of 107 U/L
and AST of 62 U/L).13 In 62 patients with COVID-19 from Zhejiang, 16.1% patients had elevation of AST ($40 U/L) and the
mean ALT level was 22 U/L.14 Among 305 patients with COVID19 from Wuhan, 39.1% (119/304) cases had elevation of ALT,
AST, or bilirubin at admission. Of them, 24 cases had increased
ALT ($80 U/L) and 19 had increased AST ($80 U/L), while only
6 had increased bilirubin level.15
Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted the close
relationship of abnormal liver biochemistries with severity of
COVID-19. In the cohort of 1099 patients with COVID-19
from mainland China, 39.4% had AST >40 U/L and 28.1%
had ALT >40 U/L, and most of them occurred in severe and
critical cases.9 The mean levels of serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin in severe or critical cases were significantly higher than
those in control cases in another multicenter retrospective
study including 32 patients.16 Serum levels of ALT and AST
in severe to critical cases were significantly higher than
those in mild to moderate cases among 265 patients with
COVID-19 from Shanghai.17 Similarly, patients admitted to
the ICU were more likely to have high levels of serum ALT,
AST, and total bilirubin.18,19

Li J. et al: Liver injury in COVID-19

In 52 critically ill patients with multiple organ damage, 35
(67%) had ARDS, 15 (29%) had acute kidney injury, 15
(29%) had liver injury, and 12 (23%) had cardiac injury.20
Among 298 patients with COVID-19 from Shenzhen, the percentage of liver injury in the severe group was substantially
higher than that in the non-severe group.21 However, significant differences of serum levels of ALT, AST and total bilirubin
between patients with and without ARDS were not found in a
small sample cohort study from Wuhan.22 In addition, abnormal liver function test in cases of COVID-19 is often transient
and often simultaneously combined with increased enzymes
from muscle and heart; these laboratory changes can return
to normal without liver-related morbidity and mortality.
Pathological changes of liver in Chinese patients who
died from COVID-19
The reported point CFR of COVID-19 patients in mainland
China has varied widely, mainly based on the geographic
locality and the observation time. To date over 3100 patients
have died from COVID-19 in mainland China, all of them
belonging to the critical cases. However, only several cases
have undergone autopsies or post-mortem tissue biopsies.
Xu et al.23 first reported the pathological characteristics of
post-mortem biopsy specimens from a 50-year-old man
who died from critical COVID-19. The results showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity in the liver. Liu et al.24 performed several cases of
autopsies in Wuhan, China, and concluded that the histological characteristics of COVID-19 focuses on the lungs and
without sufficient evidence for other organ obvious injuries.
The autopsy results of the liver include hepatomegaly with
dark red, hepatocyte degeneration accompanied by lobular
focal necrosis and neutrophil infiltration, infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in the portal area, and congestion
of hepatic sinuses with microthrombosis. However, neither
histological features of liver failure nor bile duct injuries
have been observed in these deceased cases.
Pathogenesis and etiology of liver injury in patients
with COVID-19
Systemic inflammatory responses and pulmonary injury associated with coronaviruses are triggered by the innate and adaptive
immune system. Expression of SARS-CoV S protein in animals is
associated with strong inflammatory reaction and enhanced
hepatitis. During SARS-CoV infection, host factors trigger an
immune response, which can inhibit virus replication, promote
virus clearance, and trigger a prolonged adaptive immune
response against the viruses. In SARS-CoV-infected patients,
CD4+ T cells activate B cells then promote the production of virusspecific antibodies. A large amount of CD8+ T cells can be found in
the pulmonary interstitium, which play a vital role in clearing the
coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune injury.25
However, it is important to note that an immune response out
of control can induce immunopathogenesis, which may result in
lung tissue damage and functional impairment in COVID-19
patients. However, reports about the underlying immune mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 are still limited.
Coronavirus-related liver injury in COVID-19
Abnormal liver biochemistries have also been reported in
patients with SARS and MERS,26,27 implying that potential
liver injury is closely associated with corona virus infection.
But it’s unclear whether the liver injury can be caused directly
by the coronavirus itself. It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 is
closely related to SARS-CoV, and they share the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and lung is the
main target organ of the corona virus infection. Previous RNAseq data in the human protein atlas database demonstrates
expression of ACE2 in the liver.28 However, only a low frequency of ACE2 expression is observed in cholangiocytes,
but not in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells.29
Recently, the single-cell RNA-seq data from two independent
cohorts suggest cholangiocyte-specific expression of ACE2 in
human liver samples. Similarly, single cell sequencing and
immunohistochemistry study showed that ACE2 was only
expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues,
and very minimally in hepatocytes.
In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial
hepatectomy, ACE2 expression in the liver was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the
normal level on the third day and returned to normal level on
seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. The experimental results implied the upregulation of ACE2 expression in the liver was caused by
compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile
duct epithelial cells during acute liver injury.30,31 Considering
the COVID-19 patients with liver injury mainly manifested as
elevation of serum aminotransferases but alkaline phosphatase, SARS-CoV-2 might or might not affect the cholangiocytes through ACE2 damage to the hepatocytes. Liver injury
in COVID-19 may thus have alternative pathophysiology and
etiology.
Stress and systemic inflammation-related liver injury
in COVID-19
Under physiological conditions, the liver is the important
organ that meets and filters a large amount of alien material,
and then maintains immune tolerance through gut-liver axis.
However, immune tolerance is interrupted under psychological stress conditions in patients with severe COVID-19.
Hyperactivated immune responses and cytokine stormrelated systemic inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection can
affect and damage many organs, including the gut and liver.
Peripheral blood levels of Th17 and CD8 T cells, interleukin-2,
interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis
factor-a, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferoninducible protein-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha in severe patients were
significantly higher than those in control patients.18,21,22,32,33
In the same way, abnormal liver biochemistries have also
occurred often in severe COVID-19 cases. Stress-induced
liver injury might be associated with hypoxia-reoxygenation,
over-activation of Kupffer cells and oxidative stress, intestinal
endotoxemia, and activation of the sympathetic nervous and
adrenocortical system in COVID-19 patients.
Sepsis is not uncommon in severe and critical COVID-19
cases, especially in patients with intestinal microflora imbalance and existing liver cirrhosis.34 Sepsis is a dysregulated
immune response to an infection that leads to psychological
stress and multiple organ dysfunction.35 The pathophysiology
of sepsis-related liver injury includes hypoxic liver injury due
to ischemia and shock, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism, hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation.36 Hence, sepsis in COVID-19

Li J. et al: Liver injury in COVID-19

patients might be one of the etiologies of liver injury and substantially impairs the prognosis of COVID-19. Furthermore,
severe hypoxia and hypovolemia are the major cause of
ischemic/hypoxic liver injury in COVID-19 cases with acute
lung failure and/or shock. Ischemic/hypoxic liver injury is
associated with metabolic acidosis, calcium overloading, and
changes of mitochondrial membrane permeability, and has
thus far usually manifested as very high aminotransferase
concentrations in serum.37
Drug-induced liver injury or existing liver disease in
COVID-19
Moderate microvascular steatosis with mild hepatic inflammation in a COVID-19 patient indicates the possibility of druginduced liver injury.23 In clinical practice, a large number of
patients had history of using antipyretic drugs for treatment
of fever.38 Most antipyretic drugs contain paracetamol, which
is generally recognized as a common reason for liver injury.39
In addition, many patients with COVID-19 have history of
simultaneous use of multiple antiviral drugs, i.e. oseltamivir,
abidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir.40,41 These antiviral drugs can
induce liver injury as well. A clinical trial of lopinavir/ritonavir
or abidol for treatment of COVID-19 from Shanghai showed
that two cases of each group occurred liver injury among twohundred and sixty-two patients.42 Thus, if abnormality of liver
enzymes occurs after using a hepatotoxic drug, drug-induced
liver injury should first be confirmed or ruled out. In addition,
given the high burden of chronic liver disease in China, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, and liver cirrhosis might be the major alternative causes of liver injury in
Chinese patients with COVID-19.43 SARS-CoV-2 infection and
related immune changes might be regarded as a “second hit”
to simple fatty liver, and can induce incident liver injury and
steatohepatitis. Stress and sepsis are particularly problematic
in cirrhotic patients, as either can trigger acute-on-chronic
liver failure. However, the information of pre-existing liver
diseases has not been outlined in most studies of COVID-19
and the interaction between existing liver disease and SARSCoV-2 infection has not yet been studied.36
Summary and future perspective
In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak has
become a global threat to human health over the past 3
months. The COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and
even fatal respiratory diseases, and in mainland China 2.3%
of CFR is attributed to ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Increasing evidence has demonstrated frequent incident
liver injury in COVID-19, especially in patients with multiple
organ injury. The liver injury itself has often manifested as
transient elevation of serum aminotransferases. However,
acute liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis have
been reported in the available studies, but seldomly prevalence of abnormal aminotransferases is significantly higher in
severe cases than in mild cases, according to many studies of
COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of liver injury in cases
of COVID-19 might include psychological stress, systemic
inflammation response, drug toxicity, and progression of preexisting liver diseases, i.e. from simple fatty liver to steatohepatitis. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for SARSCoV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury in
COVID-19 patients, and it is difficult to summarize the role of
the immune system in causing liver damage by the virus at
present. Therefore, the pathophysiology and implication of
liver injury have not yet been fully determined in COVID-19,
as reports about liver injury as well as underlying mechanisms are limited.
Being that liver is the most frequently affected outside of
the respiratory system in COVID-19, more intensive surveillance or individually tailored therapeutic approaches is
needed for severe cases, especially among those with preexisting advanced liver disease. Mechanistic understanding of
the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection with liver injury is
important for the clinical practice of managing COVID-19
patients with hepatic injury. Further study should focus on the
mechanism of incident liver injury in COVID-19 and the effect
of underlying liver disease on treatment and outcome of
COVID-19 in the future.
