Abstract
Background: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disease characterized by
systemic inflammatory reactions associated with the dysregulated production of interleukin-6 (IL-6). In patients with
MCD, renal involvement is uncommon, with only one report published regarding kidney transplantation (KTx) to
treat end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to MCD. Recent clinical observations have shown that IL-6
production is implicated in allograft rejection, while IL-6 receptor blockade (with tocilizumab [TCZ]) reduces
alloantibody generation and thereby improves graft survival; however, the efficacy and safety of TCZ in MCD
patients undergoing KTx is still unknown.
Case presentation: Herein, we describe the case of a 50-year-old man with MCD who received living-donor
KTx for ESRD. Post-operative immunosuppression consisted of a triple-drug regimen (tacrolimus, mycophenolate
mofetil and methylprednisolone) with TCZ that was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. At 17 months
post-transplantation, the patient remains asymptomatic, and the allograft pathology has shown no evidence
of rejection and no development of de novo donor-specific antibody (DSA).
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of an MCD patient with ESRD who underwent
successful KTx. TCZ safely supported the patient during the perioperative period, and this drug may be useful for
blocking the generation of donor-specific antibodies and reducing the risk of rejection episodes. KTx in combination
with TCZ is thus considered a viable treatment option for ESRD due to MCD.

Background
Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon heterogeneous
group of lymphoproliferative disorders with three histological types (hyaline vascular type, plasma cell type, and
mixed type). CD can occur in a localized (unicentric CD:
UCD) or widespread (multicentric CD: MCD) form. The
aetiology of CD is not well understood; however, excessive production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) by lymph node
hyperplasia has been implicated in its pathogenesis [1–
3]. The clinical features include generalized lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and systemic manifestations, such
as fatigue, a low-grade fever, and weight loss. Abnormal
laboratory findings include anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia,
hypocholesterolaemia, hypergammaglobulinaemia, and
increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) [1–3]. Renal
involvement in MCD seems to be uncommon and has
been described in only a few case series [4, 5]. To date,
there has been only one report of kidney transplantation
(KTx) for the treatment of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) secondary to MCD [6].

IL-6 is a key cytokine that impacts the development and
maturation of T cells, B cells, and antibody producing
plasma cells. Excessive IL-6 production has been linked to
several human diseases characterized by unregulated antibody production and autoimmunity, such as CD [1, 2].
Tocilizumab (TCZ; Actemra®, Roche/Genentech, San
Francisco, CA, USA) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal blockade targeting the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). TCZ
binds to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of the
IL-6R and is approved for the treatment of CD [1, 2].
A recent study of TCZ for patients undergoing KTx
showed a significant reduction in donor-specific antibody
(DSA) production and improvement in the transplantation graft survival [7, 8]. IL-6R interactions have been
shown to be critical for alloantibody generation in an
animal model of alloimmunity. IL-6 modulates T cell immunity and is a powerful stimulant of pathogenic IgG production, so the blockade of these interactions with an
anti–IL-6R monoclonal blockade results in significant reductions in alloantibodies [7, 8]. However, the efficacy and
safety of TCZ in MCD patients undergoing KTx is still
unknown. To answer this question, we herein report the
second known case of an MCD patient with ESRD who
successfully underwent living-donor KTx using TCZ.
Case presentation
A 33-year-old man visited an outpatient clinic with
haematuria and proteinuria. One year later, the patient
was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy by a renal biopsy
and was treated with diet and medication. At 36 years of
age, his began to experience fatigue and weight loss. He
was had generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated CRP levels, and his IL-6 level had
gradually increased. Chest CT revealed slight enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes, centrilobular nodules, thickening of the bronchovascular bundles, and
ground-glass opacities. These clinical findings were consistent with MCD. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and
HIV screening were negative. His renal function gradually declined over the following decade, resulting in
ESRD. At 44 years of age, peritoneal dialysis was started
for the treatment of ESRD, and an inguinal lymph node
biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis, revealing the typical features of plasma cell-type MCD. Oral
prednisolone (PSL) (10 mg/day) was initially administered; however, none of his clinical or laboratory parameters were fully resolved.
At 45 years of age, he was referred to our hospital for
further evaluation and treatment including living-donor
KTx. To histopathologically determine the primary cause
of ESRD (i.e., IgA nephropathy, AA amyloidosis, or
other causes) and to make a pathological diagnosis of his
interstitial lung disease, renal and lung biopsies, respectively, were performed. Similar to the immunostaining
findings of the inguinal lymph nodes, which showed significant deposits of IgA and IL-6 (Fig. 1a), lung biopsy
specimens showed plasma cell proliferation with positive
staining for IgA and IL-6 (Fig. 1b), and renal biopsy
specimens showed predominant IgA deposition in the
glomerular mesangium (Fig. 1c). These findings led us to
the possible diagnosis of MCD with lung involvement
complicated by ESRD associated with IgA nephropathy.
Since treatment with oral PSL failed to suppress the disease activity of MCD, the therapeutic regimen was changed to intravenous TCZ (8 mg/kg, every 2 weeks), which
successfully controlled his MCD symptoms without the
further exacerbation of his lung disease.
At 50 years of age, he had recurrent peritonitis and
therefore decided to undergo KTx. Preoperatively, tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
were administered starting 5 days before transplantation. TAC was administered at 0.1 mg/kg/day, and the
trough level was maintained at 8–12 ng/mL for the first
few weeks after transplantation. MMF was administered
at a dosage of 1000 mg twice daily. In addition, induction with intravenous methylprednisolone (mPSL; 1
dose of 500 mg) and basiliximab (1 dose of 20 mg)
therapy was administered on the day of transplantation.
Basiliximab was also administered 4 days after transplantation. mPSL was gradually tapered to 40 mg by
the end of the first post-transplantation week and
switched to an oral formulation. To prevent overimmunosuppression, TCZ was discontinued after transplantation. However, the extension of the interval between TCZ administrations was associated with a slight
increase in the patient’s CRP levels, but his constitutional symptoms did not reappear, and after the repeated administration of TCZ (8 mg/kg, every 2 weeks),
improvements in his CRP levels were immediately
noted (Fig. 2).
The patient’s IL-6 levels decreased dramatically after
transplantation and are now maintained at 300–500 pg/
ml under immunosuppression with a triple-drug regimen (TAC, MMF and mPSL) with TCZ (Fig. 2). In
addition, the patient experienced increases in albumin,
haemoglobin and haematocrit (data not shown), along
with normalized CRP and IgG (Fig. 2).
On post-operative days 20 and 238, a transplant renal
biopsy was performed and showed no rejection or virus
infection. To evaluate for the presence of anti-HLA antibodies, a single-antigen bead assay (LABScreen Single
Antigen) was performed. DSA was negative both before
transplantation and on post-operative day 239.
At present, 17 months after KTx, the patient remains
asymptomatic, and the allograft function has been preserved without evidence of rejection. In addition, haematologic follow-up has not demonstrated any significant
adverse effects of TCZ (such as dyslipidaemia or

Discussion and conclusions
This case highlights two important clinical implications:
MCD with ESRD can be successfully treated by KTx,
and TCZ is useful for MCD and ensures a safe perioperative period during KTx.
In the past, the treatment of CD has included various
therapeutic strategies, such as steroids, rituximab, and
chemotherapy. However, since there is no standard therapy,
treatment recommendations for CD can be difficult [3]. Recently, TCZ was shown to be effective for treatment and
has been widely used in Japan since June 2005 [1, 2, 9, 10].
While renal involvement associated with MCD is rare,
its manifestations can vary and include minimal disease
changes, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, AA
amyloidosis, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and
IgA nephropathy [4, 5, 11–14]. In particular, IgA nephropathy associated with MCD is quite rare [11]. In
our patient, in addition to the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy, numerous IgA-positive cells were detected in the
lymph node and lung specimens. This result is consistent with those of a recent study, which found that the
detection of increased immunohistochemical IgA expression can be useful for diagnosing CD [15]. Furthermore, ESRD as a complication of MCD has rarely been
reported, and to our knowledge, only one report has described successful KTx for an MCD patient [6]. Murakami
et al. reported an MCD patient with ESRD who underwent KTx. The patient developed acute rejection soon
after KTx but was successfully treated with a steroid pulse,
plasmapheresis, anti-CD3 and rituximab. The graft
survival was 8 years, and the graft function remained
excellent.
In patients with CD, increased IL-6 and CRP levels
have been noted [1, 2, 12–14]. CD exacerbation is correlated with the levels of both IL-6 and CRP; IL-6 induces
the synthesis of hepatic acute-phase reactants and increases CRP and IgG levels. In our patient, his IL-6
levels decreased dramatically after transplantation with
induction therapy from 3480 pg/ml to 341 pg/ml. We
suspect that induction therapy might have dramatically
decreased his IL-6 levels.
IL-6 is a major cytokine involved in the progression of B
cells to IgG-secreting plasmablasts and finally to plasma
cells. In addition, IL-6 stimulates Th17 cells, which mediate inflammation and allograft rejection. Recent studies
have suggested that TCZ can inhibit antibody production
and reduce inflammation by targeting the IL-6/IL-6R
pathway [16–18]. Jordan et al. reported on the efficacy of
TCZ in reducing anti-HLA antibodies and improving the
graft survival in highly HLA-sensitized patients who were
resistant to other desensitization strategies. Furthermore,
they offered TCZ treatment to chronic antibody-mediated
rejection patients in whom other treatment options had
failed, and significant reductions in DSA and stabilization
of renal function were seen at 2 years [7, 8].
Another study suggested that TCZ may be useful for
preventing post-transplant graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) [19]. Kennedy et al. reported that the addition
of TCZ to the standard GVHD prophylaxis for patients
who had received allogenic stem-cell transplantation was
safe and associated with a very low incidence of GVHD.
The long-term use of TCZ is optimal for the treatment
of MCD; thus, treatment with TCZ may allow KTx patients to reduce or discontinue their conventional immunosuppression and mitigate related side effects, such as
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, de novo diabetes, infection,
and malignancies [20]. We therefore expect immunosuppression after KTx to also be effective for MCD.
In summary, we suggested a treatment protocol for
renal replacement therapy using TCZ for MCD patients
with ESRD. While the IL-6R monoclonal antibody TCZ
was shown to be effective for treating MCD, it may also
be used to reduce the risk of chronic antibody-mediated
rejection and thereby possibly improve long-term graft
survival [7, 8]. Although the indications for elective KTx
in MCD patients remain limited, continued success and
reports of good outcomes may help establish KTx as an
acceptable therapeutic option.
