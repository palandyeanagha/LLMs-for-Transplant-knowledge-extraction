ABSTRACT
The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the
management of cholangiocarcinoma were originally
published in 2002. This is the first update since then and
is based on a comprehensive review of the recent
literature, including data from randomised controlled
trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort,
prospective and retrospective studies.
BACKGROUND
Development of guidelines
These guidelines on the management of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) were originally published in
2002.1 This is the first update since and is based on
a comprehensive review of the recent literature.
The recent European HepatoPancreatoBiliary
Association Consensus Conference on Cholangiocarcinoma guidelines have also been used as
a source.2 Specific recommendations have been
graded based on the quality of evidence available. In
the absence of significant data, evidence was based
on expert opinion. This manuscript has been
developed with the support of The British Liver
Trust and the UK cholangiocarcinoma charity, the
Alan Morement Memorial Fund.
Intent
These guidelines are intended to bring consistency
and improvement in the management from first
suspicion of CC through to diagnosis and subsequent treatment. As stated in other British Society
of Gastroenterology guidelines, patient preferences must be sought and decisions made jointly
by the patient and health professional, based on
the risks and benefits of any intervention. A
multidisciplinary team approach is recommended,
and these often complex cases should be managed
in specialist centres with the relevant experience.
The guidelines should not necessarily be regarded
as the standard of care for all patients. Each case
must be managed on the basis of individual clinical data.
Levels of evidence
Studies used as a basis for these guidelines are
graded according to the quality of evidence using
the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine
levels of evidence (table 1).3 Grading of recommendations is as follows:
A: consistent level 1 studies.
B: consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapolations
from level 1 studies.
C: level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3
studies.
D: level 5 evidence or inconsistent or inconclusive
studies of any level.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
CC is the second commonest primary liver
tumour worldwide, after hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).1 245 Incidence and mortality rates for
intrahepatic CC have risen steeply and steadily
across the world over the past few decades with
concomitant falls in extrahepatic CC rates.4e14
Since the mid-1990s, more deaths have been coded
in England and Wales due to CC than to HCC.4 5
CC kills approximately 1500 people annually in
the UK, with approximately equal numbers of men
and women.12 The cause of the rise in CC is
unknown and is not explained by improvements in
diagnosis.6 12e15 There is debate as to whether the
rise in intrahepatic CC represents a genuine increase
in true parenchymal primary CC. Recent evidence
from USA and UK data suggest that rising intrahepatic CC rates partly reflects misclassification of
perihilar (‘Klatskin’) tumours being incorrectly
coded as intrahepatic instead of extrahepatic.12 The
overall incidence and mortality from all CC,
however, does appear to be increasing.12
Risk factors
Established risk factors
There are several established risk factors for CC, but
these account for <30% of all cases.15e19 Most cases
of CC are sporadic. Primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), with or without ulcerative colitis, is the
commonest known predisposing factor for CC in the
Western world (lifetime risk 5e35%).18 In a study of
211 patients with PSC of whom 60% had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), malignancies were the
most frequent cause of death (44%);18 41% of
patients developed colorectal cancer (CRC) and 15
(39%) developed CC. Other malignancies included
gall bladder cancer (GBC, n¼2), pancreatic cancer
(n¼1), lymphoma (n¼3), melanoma (n¼1) and
gastric cancer (n¼1). Median interval between PSC
diagnosis and CC was 2.5 years (range 0e9.8 years).
The estimated risk of CC after 10 years was 9% with
no significant differences in patients with and
without IBD.18 In patients with IBD the 10- and 20-
year risks for CRC were 14% and 31%, respectively,
significantly higher than for non-IBD patients (2%
and 2%). CC, cholangitis and age at entry were
independent risk factors for the combined endpoint
of death or liver transplantation.18

Other established risk factors for CC are summarised in
table 2.13e19
Likely risk factors
Less established but likely risk factors for CC include cirrhosis of
any cause and chronic viral hepatitis B or C.19 A combination of
recent cohort, population-based, case-control and observational
studies from around the world suggest that obesity, diabetes,
fatty liver disease, alcohol, smoking, IBD without PSC and
polymorphisms of genes coding for carcinogen metabolism,
DNA repair, inflammation and biliary transporters may also be
risk factors.15e19 Toxins other than Thorotrast have been linked
to CC, including dioxins, nitrosamines and vinyl chloride.16
Anatomical classification
The term ‘cholangiocarcinoma’ includes all bile duct cancers
(intrahepatic, perihilar and distal extrahepatic).12 20 21 Up to
20% of all CC are intrahepatic, according to published series,

and controls and/or failed to identify or appropriately control known confounders.
{{Poor quality prognostic cohort study: one in which sampling was biased in favour of patients who already had the target outcome, or the measurement of outcomes was accomplished in

whereas 50e60% are perihilar, involving the bifurcation of the
ducts. Perihilar CC are a subset of extrahepatic CC.12 Up to 20%
of CC are distal extrahepatic tumours and 5% of tumours are
multifocal. Given the differences in their frequency, pathobiology and management, intrahepatic, perihilar and distal extrahepatic CC should be viewed as separate entities.12 17
The extent of perihilar CC may be described by the
BismutheCorlette classification (figure 1)20:
< Type I: below confluence of left and right hepatic ducts.
< Type II: reaching confluence but not involving left or right
hepatic ducts.
< Type III: occluding common hepatic duct and either right
(IIIa) or left (IIIb) hepatic duct.
< Type IV: multicentric or bilateral intrahepatic segmental
involvement; or involving confluence and both right and left
hepatic ducts.
This classification is commonly used but has limitations. It
does not take into account vascular encasement and distant
metastases. A novel system for reporting perihilar CC was
recently proposed based on tumour size, extent of disease in the
main bile ducts, involvement of the hepatic artery and/or portal
vein, lymph node involvement, distant metastases, volume of the
putative remnant liver after resection and underlying liver
disease.21 Although more complex than the BismutheCorlette
classification, the important aim of this system is to standardise
the prospective reporting of perihilar CC and help identify factors
relevant to the outcome across multiple centres.
PATHOLOGY
Histological classifications
There are separate histological classifications of intrahepatic and
extrahepatic CC.22e26 The WHO classifications are given in table 3.
Macroscopic features of intrahepatic CC
Intrahepatic CCs are whiter and firmer than HCCs as they
contain more desmoplastic stroma. They occur more commonly
in non-cirrhotic livers than HCCs and are divided into four
macroscopic types (table 4). The intraductal type carries the best
prognosis and the periductal type carries the worst.
Histological grade
Over 90% of CCs are adenocarcinomas and are classified (1e4)
according to the percentage of tumour composed of glandular
tissue. Some types of adenocarcinoma are not graded (eg,
carcinoma in situ, clear cell adenocarcinoma and papillary
adenocarcinoma). Signet ring cell carcinoma is graded as 3
and small cell carcinoma as 4. Although histological grade
correlates with postoperative outcome, stage is more
important.23e26
Molecular diagnosis
CC is often associated with inactivation of tumour suppressor
genes, for example, p53, Smad-4, bcl-2 and p16.15 27e33 Mutations in oncogenes have also been described including K-ras, p53,
c-erbB-2 and c-neu. Chromosomal aneuploidy has been reported
in over 80% of PSC-associated CC. Although mutations can lead
to detectable phenotypic changes, molecular profiling in biliary
cytology does not currently have an established diagnostic or
prognostic role.15 27e33
Combined hepatocellularecholangiocarcinomas
This entity should be distinguished from ‘collision’ tumours in
which separate CCs and HCCs are present in the same liver.
Combined hepatocellulareCCs are uncommon primary liver
tumours accounting for 1e15% of all CCs. These are divided
into classical and stem cell types. The latter is divided into the
typical subtype in which there are nests of mature-appearing
hepatocytes with peripheral clusters of small cells with the
immunohistochemical profile of stem/progenitor cells; the
intermediate cell subtype with tumour cells intermediate
between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes; and the cholangiocellular type with tumour cells growing in an anastomosing pattern. In one series, 28% of HCCs contained cells
expressing biliary/progenitor cell markers cytokeratin (CK) 7
and/or CK19.34 ‘Non-classical’ intrahepatic CCs are usually
smaller and often arise in chronic liver disease, mostly HCV
infection, and/or with significant fibrosis.35
Distinction from other tumours
Distinguishing intrahepatic CC from metastatic adenocarcinoma and other primary liver tumours can be difficult. Accurate
differentiation, particularly from foregut metastases (lung,
oesophagus, stomach, pancreas), often cannot be made histologically. Other modalities, especially imaging, are essential.
Immunohistochemistry panels including CK7, CK19, CK20,
CDX-2, TTF-1, oestrogen/progesterone receptors and PSA,
depending on clinical context, can be helpful.35 CCs are usually
CK7 positive and CK20 negative. In distinguishing HCC from
CC, lack of mucin production and expression of HepPar-1, CD10
and glypican-3 by HCC are useful.35

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical features
Perihilar or extrahepatic CCs typically present with features of
biliary obstruction (jaundice, pale stool, dark urine and
pruritus).1 Cholangitis is unusual without prior biliary instrumentation. CC is usually advanced at presentation, particularly
with more proximal intrahepatic and perihilar tumours
obstructing one duct. These often present with systemic
manifestations of malignancy including malaise, fatigue and
weight loss.15 36 Some cases are detected incidentally as a result
of scans performed for other indications.
Blood tests
No blood tests are diagnostic for CC. Liver function tests often
show an obstructive picture.1 Aminotransferases are frequently
normal but may be markedly raised in acute obstruction or
cholangitis. Prolonged biliary obstruction can cause a reduction
in fat soluble vitamins and an increase in prothrombin time. In
advanced disease, non-specific markers of malignancy such as
albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and
haemoglobin may be altered.15 36
Serum tumour markers
Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and CA-125 are the most used
serum tumour markers.15 36e40 Overall, their sensitivity and
specificity are low and they are not helpful for monitoring
disease progression.37e40 They may be useful in conjunction
with other diagnostic modalities.
CA19-9 is elevated in up to 85% of patients with CC with
a sensitivity of 40e70%, specificity of 50e80% and positive
predictive value (PPV) of 16e40%, depending on cut-off
values.36e38 CA19-9 elevation frequently occurs in PSC and other
causes of non-malignant obstructive jaundice, but persistently
raised levels of CA19-9 after decompression suggest malignancy.37e40 CA19-9 does not discriminate between CC, pancreatic
or gastric malignancy and may also be elevated in severe hepatic
injury from any cause. Furthermore, 10% of individuals lack Lewis
antigen and cannot produce CA19-9.36e38 40
CA-125 is detectable in up to 65% of patients with CC.38 40 In
a chemotherapy trial setting, a raised baseline CA-125 was found
to be prognostic for survival.37 CA-125 is often raised in parenchymal liver disease and may not be helpful in this context.
Novel potential tumour markers linked to CC include Mac2BP, matrix metalloproteinase-7, insulin-like growth factor 1,
interleukin 6, trypsinogen and MUCIN-5AC. None has yet been
validated in large clinical studies.
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) cholangiopathy
Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-associated cholangiopathy, the biliary
presentation of a multisystem inflammatory disorder in which
affected organs have a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in
IgG4-positive cells, can mimic CC.41 A review of 53 such cases
reported that most were men (85%), presented with obstructive
jaundice (77%), were associated with autoimmune pancreatitis
(92%), increased serum IgG4 levels (74%) and abundant IgG4-
positive cells in bile duct biopsy specimens (88%).41 Strictures
were confined to intrapancreatic bile ducts in 51% of cases, and
proximal extrahepatic/intrahepatic ducts were involved in 49%.
Following successful steroid therapy, relapse occurred in 53% of
cases after steroid withdrawal. The presence of proximal extrahepatic/intrahepatic strictures was predictive of relapse. Steroid
therapy normalised liver biochemistry in 61% and biliary stents
were safely removed in 17 of 18 patients.41 IgG4 cholangiopathy
should be excluded in suspected cases of CC by testing for
increased IgG4 in serum and biliary samples.
Imaging
Imaging is the main diagnostic modality for CC.42e55 Appearances include an intrahepatic mass lesion with characteristics of

Recommendations
< Diagnosis of CC should not rely solely on serum tumour
marker measurements (Grade B).
< CA 19-9 remains the most widely used serum tumour marker for
suspected CC, but does not exhibit high accuracy. It should be
measured after biliary obstruction has been relieved (Grade B).
< IgG4 cholangiopathy should be excluded in suspected cases
of CC (Grade B).

a metastasis, a hilar stricture or distal bile duct obstruction, with
or without a discernible mass. Differentiating between benign
and malignant biliary strictures is challenging.
Ultrasonography
CC should be suspected when there is biliary ductal dilation,
particularly with a related mass lesion and consistent clinical
history. In suspected biliary obstruction, ultrasonography (US)
is reliable for excluding gallstones but is operator-dependent
and is insufficient alone for investigating suspected CC. For
detecting advanced CC in patients with PSC, US offers specificity and negative predictive value of 90%, but sensitivity
and PPV are only 50%.42e44 US may miss small tumours and
cannot accurately define tumour extent.42e45 Colour-Doppler
US may also detect tumour-induced compression or vascular
thrombosis.
High resolution/spiral CT
Contrast CT has higher sensitivity for CC detection than US (up
to 80%), providing good views of intrahepatic mass lesions,
dilated intrahepatic ducts, localised lymphadenopathy and
extrahepatic metastases. However, the extent of CC is often not
well-defined.42e45 Abdominal lymphadenopathy is common in
PSC and does not necessarily indicate metastatic disease.
MRI
Contrast MRI is the optimal imaging investigation for suspected
CC.45e48 In addition to avoiding radiation, MRI delineates
hepatobiliary anatomy, local extent of duct involvement by MR
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), parenchymal abnormalities
including the presence of liver metastases and hilar vascular
involvement (MR angiography). However, MRI is inferior to CT
for detecting distant metastases, particularly in the lungs and
bone.45 46
Cholangiography (MRCP, ERCP, PTC)
Cholangiography is essential for assessing the extent of bile duct
involvement and resectability.1 47 49 MRCP is non-invasive, thus
avoiding risks of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
(PTC) and avoiding radiation.46e48 In a retrospective study,
MRCP had superior sensitivity (96%), specificity (85%) and
accuracy (91%) compared with ERCP (80%, 75% and 78%,
respectively) for differentiating between CC and benign strictures.47 A UK study comparing MRCP with ERCP in biliary
obstruction predominantly relating to gallstone disease found in
favour of MRCP with respect to cost-saving and quality of life.48
Similar studies on malignant biliary disease are lacking. ERCP
and PTC allow bile sampling for cytology and stent insertion for
relief of biliary obstruction. There is no clear evidence that PTC
should generally be favoured over ERCP on the basis of the level
of obstruction. Although ERCP is usually preferred above PTC,
experience of and facilities for PTC should be available in
treating centres for cases where ERCP has failed.
Histology and cytology
Although positive histology and/or cytology findings are often
difficult to obtain, they are essential for confirming a diagnosis
of CC, particularly in patients not proceeding to resection, and
for clinical trials. Tumours are usually adenocarcinomas and
have prominent desmoplastic stroma. However, except in cases
where there is co-existing biliary dysplasia, it may not be
possible, even with immunohistochemistry, to differentiate
between CC and metastatic tumour. Examples of this include
intraductal papillary neoplasm with associated invasive
neoplasia, and mucinous cystic neoplasm with associated invasive neoplasia.50 51
Standard cytology from brushings at ERCP/PTC is positive in
<50% of CC cases, hence negative cytology findings do not
exclude malignancy.2 15 Combining cytology with biopsy
increases the positive yield to 40e70%. Applying fluorescence in
situ hybridisation (FISH), which uses fluorescently-labelled
DNA probes to detect aneuploidy in cells, reportedly confirmed
cancer in 60% of patients in whom standard brush cytology was
negative.50 A subsequent study confirmed the ability of FISH to
improve the diagnostic accuracy in indeterminate biliary strictures, increasing the sensitivity of brush cytology from 21% to
58%.56 Including the presence of 9p21 deletion increased the
sensitivity to 89%. The specificity of FISH was 97% compared
with 100% for cytology.56
Endoscopic ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows good views of the distal
extrahepatic biliary tree, hilar lesions, gall bladder, regional
lymph nodes and vasculature. EUS facilitates fine needle aspiration of distal lesions and nodes which can enhance the sensitivity and PPV of CC detection to nearly 100%. However, the
negative predictive value is low, which does not permit exclusion
of malignancy following a negative biopsy.52 53 The potential
risk of tumour seeding has led some centres around the world to
advise against EUS fine needle aspiration in potentially resectable tumours. However, this is not the case in most centres.
Rates of tumour seeding are unclear, being reported as between
1:10 000 and 1:40 000, although this may be an underestimate.
Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-CT
In a study comparing CT plus MR versus positron emission
tomography (PET)-CT, PET-CT exhibited no advantage for
CC diagnosis but did have higher accuracy for detecting
regional lymph node and distant metastases.54 PET-CT may
have a potential role in preoperative staging, but this needs
validating.54 55
Cholangioscopy
Given the disappointing accuracy of current diagnostic techniques, interest in cholangioscopy has renewed following technical improvements in endoscopes.57 In a prospective
multicentre study, transpapillary cholangioscopy increased the
ability to distinguish benign from malignant strictures compared
with ERCP alone, and facilitated targeted biopsy.58 Cholangioscopy may be useful in experienced centres and further data are
awaited.
Recommendations
< Patients with suspected CC should have:
– Combined MRI and MRCP (Grade B)
– Contrast enhanced high resolution CT (Grade B).
< Invasive cholangiography should be reserved for histological
diagnosis, or therapeutic decompression where there is
cholangitis, or stent insertion in irresectable cases (Grade B).
< The above techniques are complementary and may all be
necessary as part of a surgical assessment (Grade B).
< FISH may enhance the diagnostic sensitivity of cytology
samples (Grade B).

Staging
CC staging is based on the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM)
system. The 7th edition of the TNM classification introduced
a specific staging system for intrahepatic CC, separate from
HCC, providing better prognostic information.22 23 The T category is based on the number of tumour nodules, vascular invasion and direct extension into extrahepatic tissues. Unlike HCC,
tumour size is not considered important. A positive resection
margin (non-R0 resection) is a very poor prognostic factor.
Although distant spread is late and uncommon in CC,
comprehensive staging must be carried out to screen for metastatic disease. CT provides more accurate information for this
purpose than MRI. At presentation, up to 50% of patients are
lymph node-positive and 10e20% have peritoneal involvement.
Most centres consider a staging laparoscopy to exclude local
metastatic disease in those considered resectable on imaging.
Only approximately 50% of patients with perihilar CC who
undergo laparotomy are ultimately suitable for curative resection. In a study of 175 patients with suspected perihilar CC who
underwent staging laparoscopy during the past decade, the
overall yield and accuracy of staging laparoscopy decreased
compared with earlier reports, possibly due to improved imaging
techniques during this time period.59 Further studies on the
benefit of staging laparoscopy in suspected CC are warranted.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma mimicking CC may arise from
several organs, particularly the pancreas, stomach, breast, lung
and colon. CC is difficult to differentiate from metastatic
adenocarcinoma, particularly if the pathological sample is
obtained from outside the biliary tree. Thorough clinical
assessment and other investigations are necessary to exclude
a primary from elsewhere.1 The extent to which this is pursued
will depend on the individual case.60
Screening for CC in PSC
No benefit in screening for CC in PSC has been proven and there
is no robust screening test. Nevertheless, most experts agree that
early detection of CC in PSC is important to identify cases
amenable to curative surgery and to avoid inappropriate liver
transplantation.61e66 As well as an increased risk of CC, patients
with PSC are also at increased risk of HCC; colorectal, gastric
and pancreatic cancers; and malignant gall bladder polyps.62 64 66
Up to 50% of CCs are diagnosed within 2 years of PSC diagnosis
and the subsequent risk of CC is approximately 1% per
year.64e66 The severity of liver disease (ChildePugh or Mayo
score) does not appear to be a significant risk factor. Smoking,
alcohol, duration of IBD if present, previous CRC/dysplasia and
the HLA-DR4, DQ8 haplotype are reported risk factors for
malignancy in PSC, but none has been validated as a predictive
factor. A suggested algorithm for CC screening in PSC is given in
figure 2. This is unproven and based on expert opinion. Regular
investigations, including surveillance colonoscopies in patients
with PSC and IBD and US for gall bladder lesions, are recommended in both the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines.
Role of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
Small retrospective studies have suggested that ursodeoxycholic
acid (UDCA) may reduce the risk of colonic dysplasia and CRC
in patients with PSC. No significant protective effect of UDCA
on the risk of CC has been demonstrated. Recent guidelines
from both EASL and AASLD have concluded that the role of
UDCA in PSC is currently unclear and that high-dose UDCA
may even be harmful.64e66
TREATMENT
Surgery
Surgery is the only curative treatment for patients with CC;
however, fewer than one-third of patients are resectable at diagnosis.67e73 Five-year survival rates following resection of intrahepatic CC, distal extrahepatic CC and hilar tumours are 22e44%,
27e37% and 11e41%, respectively.67 68 71e73 Survival depends on
local clearance (R0 or R1 status), vascular invasion and lymph
node metastases. R0 resection and well-differentiated tumour
grading are independently associated with improved survival and
lymph node involvement (occurring in 50% at presentation) is
associated with reduced long-term survival.67 68 72 73 Peritoneal
and distant metastases (10e20% at presentation) are contraindications to surgical resection. In a multivariate analysis, postresection prognosis correlated most strongly with clinical stage
and multiplicity of lesions.73
Resectable tumours
Resection, which should be guided by medical risk rather than
age, involves a major operative procedure and requires appropriate
surgical and anaesthetic experience. Surgical treatment depends
on the site and extent of bile duct involvement by tumour.
Intrahepatic CCs are usually treated by resection of the involved
segments or lobe of the liver. Distal CCs are managed by
pancreatoduodenectomy, as with ampullary or pancreatic head
cancers. Major hepatectomy for hilar CCs carries a considerable
risk of hepatic insufficiency if there is a small future liver remnant.
Portal vein embolisation of the liver lobe to be removed is a safe
method for increasing the future liver remnant and permits
potentially curative hepatic resection to be carried out.74e76
Liver transplantation for CC
Historically, liver transplantation for CC was associated with
rapid recurrence of disease and poor survival rates: around 10% for
intrahepatic CC and 25% for extrahepatic CC.77 78 Recent studies,
however, have reported 5-year survivals of over 70% in patients
carefully selected by their response to pre-transplant
Recommendations
< Studies obtained for the initial diagnosis may also provide
staging information. However, to rule out metastatic disease,
contrast CT of the abdomen, chest and pelvis should be
carried out on all patients, particularly if resection is being
considered (Grade B).
Recommendations
< Confirmatory histology and/or cytology at ERCP, laparoscopy
or laparotomy should be obtained if at all possible (Grade C).
< However, due to the risk of tumour seeding, surgical
assessment of resectability should be established prior to
EUS-guided or percutaneous biopsy attempted (Recommendation Grade B).
< Laparoscopy may be considered to detect occult metastatic
disease (Grade B).

chemoradiation.79 80 This applies to a minority of patients with
CC and most of the published data so far have been from a single
centre in the USA. However, a recent study analysed data from 12
transplant centres in the USA. Each had treated at least three
patients with perihilar CC using varying protocols of neoadjuvant
chemoradiation followed by liver transplantation between 1993
and 2010. Two hundred and eighty-seven patients were treated
and 71 dropped out before transplantation. The overall intent-totreat survival rate was 53% 5 years after treatment and the posttransplant recurrence-free survival rate was 65%. Patients with
tumour mass >3 cm, transperitoneal tumour biopsy, metastatic
disease or with a prior malignancy had significantly shorter
survival times. Although most patients (n¼193) came from one
centre, the other 11 centres had similar survival times.81
Adjuvant therapy for resectable tumours
There is no current evidence to support the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Appropriate trials are needed to
address this issue. The largest trial currently accruing is the
BILCAP trial.82
Palliative procedures
Surgical resection with palliative rather than curative intent is
unproven. Symptoms from biliary obstruction in irresectable
disease may be palliated by biliary stenting rather than a surgical
bypass. Stent placement resulting in adequate biliary drainage
improves survival. Surgical bypass has not been demonstrated to
be superior to stenting. Close liaison between oncological,
palliative care and surgical teams is essential.
Reporting surgical specimens
Surgical resection specimens should be reported systematically,
for example, according to Royal College of Pathologists’ guidelines.26 The final report should include the following
information:
Tumour
a. Histological type
b. Histological grade
c. Extent of invasion (according to the TNM system)
d. Blood/lymphatic vessel invasion
e. Perineural invasion: this is common and has prognostic
significance.
Margins
These must be adequately sampled because local recurrence is
related to involvement of the margins. This is particularly
important because extrahepatic CC may be multifocal in up to
5% of cases.
Regional lymph nodes
To stage lymph nodes accurately, the node groups must be
specifically identified. Peripancreatic nodes located along the
body and tail of the pancreas are considered sites of distant
metastasis.
Additional pathological findings
These must be noted if present (eg, carcinoma in situ, sclerosing
cholangitis).
Metastases
Metastases to other organs or structures should be reported.
Biliary decompression and stents
Stenting prior to surgery
Preoperative biliary drainage is controversial. It has been
associated with bacteriobilia and fungal colonisation, higher

Recommendations
< For perihilar CC, the Bismuth classification is a guide to the
extent of surgery required (aim is tumour-free margin of
>5 mm). Surgical treatment is principally as follows (Grade B):
– For types I and II: en bloc resection of the extrahepatic bile
ducts and gall bladder, regional lymphadenectomy and
Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
– For type III: as above plus right or left hepatectomy.
– For type IV: not usually resectable but extended right or left
hepatectomy may be feasible, dependent on biliary
anatomy.
< Segment 1 of the liver may preferentially harbour metastatic
disease from hilar CC and removal should be considered with
stages IIeIV.
< Intrahepatic CCs are managed by segmental or lobe resection.
< Distal CCs are treated by pancreato-duodenectomy.
< Increasing data suggest that liver transplantation for CC can
be successful in rigorously selected patients undergoing
neoadjuvant therapy in highly specialised centres.

rates of postoperative sepsis, wound infection, longer hospital
stay and increased cost.83e90 A meta-analysis of preoperative
biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice included four trials
(n¼235) comparing PTC-biliary drainage with direct surgery
and one trial (n¼85) comparing preoperative endoscopic
drainage with direct surgery.91 Overall, there were no significant differences in mortality, morbidity or complications
between the preoperative biliary drainage and the direct
surgery groups. One of the included studies found that
preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage prolonged hospital
stay and increased cost. However, the overall strength of
evidence was deemed low due to the poor quality of the
included trials.91 A multicentre randomised trial comparing
preoperative biliary drainage with surgery alone for patients
with pancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice included 206
patients; 106 were randomly assigned to undergo preoperative
biliary drainage for 4e6 weeks (primarily by ERCP) followed
by surgery, and 96 to surgery alone within 1 week of diagnosis.92 The rates of serious complications were 39% in the
early surgery group and 74% in the biliary drainage group (RR
in the early surgery group 0.54, p<0.001). Mortality and the
length of hospital stay did not differ between the groups.92
Although most of the data relate to obstructive jaundice from
cancers other than CC, on current evidence the routine use of
preoperative biliary drainage cannot be recommended. In
patients who are severely malnourished or have acute suppurative cholangitis and in those in whom major hepatic resection is planned, preoperative drainage may be beneficial.93
Rigorously designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with
appropriate sample sizes are required with respect to CC.
Stents for palliation of jaundice
Most patients with CC have unresectable disease. In such
patients, a study from the USA found that endoscopic stenting
cost significantly less and was associated with longer survival
than surgical treatment (19 vs 16.5 months), suggesting that
endoscopic stenting is the procedure of choice for palliative
biliary drainage.94 Most initially inserted stents are plastic.
Stents of diameter $10Fr usually remain patent for approximately 3 months. Narrower stents have lower patency rates and
should not be used routinely. Covered removable self-expanding
metal stents (SEMS) may also be used and some specialists
prefer SEMS in patients who are candidates for neoadjuvant
therapies.95
Biliary drainage by the percutaneous route can be effective,
particularly for high strictures involving segmental ducts. A
multicentre retrospective Korean study of 85 patients with
newly diagnosed advanced hilar CC who did not undergo
surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy compared percutaneous
versus endoscopic SEMS insertion.96 Successful biliary decompression was significantly higher in the percutaneous group than
in the endoscopic group (93% vs 77%, p¼0.049). Procedurerelated complications, median survival and stent patency duration were similar in both groups.96
Bilateral versus unilateral stents in hilar CC/advanced malignant
biliary strictures
Bilateral versus unilateral stent insertion for hilar strictures is
controversial. Early small studies reported that 30-day mortality
and cholangitis were lower in patients who underwent bilateral
compared with unilateral drainage for hilar strictures.88 89 93 97
Failure to drain opacified lobes is associated with a poorer
outcome. Post-stent cholangitis can be reduced by minimising
the amount of contrast injected. Careful imaging with MRCP to
plan endoscopic stent placement in complex hilar tumours may
guide optimum stent placement. In particular, non-atrophic
areas of the liver with a likelihood of providing viable bile
production should be considered for drainage.93 Bilateral stent
insertion is technically challenging and should not be carried out
routinely. If contemplated, it should be performed in expert
centres.
Metal versus plastic stents
Most patients with malignant biliary obstruction treated by
plastic stents will require at least one stent change. Metal stents
have several advantages over plastic stents.98e102 They have
a relatively narrow delivery system (8Fr) with a wider diameter
on deployment (10 mm). SEMS are also available that are 8 mm
on deployment, which may help in stent selection, depending on
the patient’s anatomy. The patency rates of metal stents are
significantly greater than those of plastic stents (up to
12 months vs 3 months). Metal stents are associated with fewer
ERCPs, a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications than
plastic stents in patients who survive more than 6 months. A
retrospective study of unresectable hilar CC in the USA found
that SEMS were more cost-effective than plastic stents for
palliative drainage.102 Other studies have also found that metal
stents are more cost-effective in patients surviving more than
4 months. Plastic stents may be satisfactory for patients
surviving less time than this.
Disadvantages of uncovered metal stents include being difficult to remove endoscopically and potentially making surgery
more technically challenging. Metal stents should not be
deployed for biliary strictures prior to a multidisciplinary team
decision on resectability. Tumour growth through the mesh of
metal stents may lead to further problems with biliary
obstruction and sepsis. This may be overcome by inserting
plastic stents through the lumen of the metal stent, or placement of a further mesh metal stent where technically possible.
Covered versus uncovered stents
Covered biliary metal stents have recently been developed to
prevent tumour ingrowth.103e106 A prospective RCT comparing
covered and uncovered stents in irresectable malignant distal
biliary obstruction found no difference in survival but a longer
time to obstruction in the group with covered stents, who
overall had fewer interventions and lower costs. Patency was
higher in pancreatic cancer and in lymphadenopathy-associated
obstruction compared with biliary malignancy, but numbers of
the latter were small.103 Another RCT demonstrated improved
survival in patients with extrahepatic CC who percutaneously
received a covered (243 days) compared with an uncovered stent
(180 days), with comparable cost and complication rates.105 The
incidence of stent dysfunction was significantly lower in the
covered stent group.105 The largest study so far in this area was
a multicentre unblinded RCT of 400 patients with irresectable
Recommendation
< Routine biliary drainage before assessing resectability or
preoperatively should be avoided except for certain situations
such as acute cholangitis, with modification of antibiotic
prophylaxis according to patient characteristics and local
microbiological specialist advice (Grade B).

distal malignant biliary obstruction. Patients were randomised
to ERCP with insertion of a covered or uncovered metal (nitinol)
stent.106 There were no significant differences in stent patency
time, patient survival time or complication rates between
covered and uncovered metal stents. However, covered stents
migrated significantly more often than uncovered stents and
tumour ingrowth was more frequent with uncovered stents.106
Complications of stenting
Complications of stents include complications of endoscopy and
sedation. Following palliative stenting, patients can die from
recurrent sepsis, biliary obstruction and stent occlusion, as well
as disease progression. Acute cholecystitis from covered stents is
another recognised complication.
Photodynamic therapy
In an early prospective open-label trial, 39 patients with unresectable CC were randomised to stenting alone or stenting and
photodynamic therapy (PDT).107 The PDT group had a significantly higher median survival (493 days vs 98 days).107 PDTwas
further evaluated in the larger UK Photostent-02 trial in which
92 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed biliary
tract cancer (BTC) were randomised to receive either PDT plus
stenting or stenting alone.108 Overall survival was 5.6 months
for PDT plus stenting and 8.5 months for stenting alone (HR
1.8, p¼0.027). Nine patients (20%) in the PDT/stenting arm and
19 (41%) in the stenting alone arm received subsequent
chemotherapy. Although overall survival was significantly
improved among those who had chemotherapy compared with
those who did not (11.1 vs 4.8 months, p¼0.001), adjusting for
this only reduced the PDT/stenting HR from 1.8 to 1.6,
suggesting that failure to receive subsequent chemotherapy did
not completely explain the excess risk from PDT.108
Oncological approaches
Given that most patients present with unresectable disease and
at least half have lymph node metastases, oncological
approaches could potentially have a beneficial impact on many
patients.109e116 As a general guide from trial data, patients who
are relatively fit and are not deteriorating rapidly should be
treated early in the course of their disease rather than waiting for
clinical progression. The performance status (PS) is a major
prognostic factor. Patients should have a WHO or ECOG PS of
0 or 1 after optimisation of biliary drainage. Even achieving
stable disease in patients on therapy correlates with length and
quality of life. This is particularly important because of the
frequent difficulty in confirming objective radiological responses,
particularly in the perihilar area. Good symptom control is
paramount and requires multidisciplinary team input and, for
many patients, palliative care is immediately appropriate.
Chemotherapy
Locally advanced or metastatic inoperable CC and GBC (Evidence
level 1a)
Until recently, chemotherapy for CC had poor results and
studies were small and disparate. In 2010, a new standard of care
in unresectable BTC was established with the reporting of the
UK NCRI ABC-01 and ABC-02 trials.39 113 114 ABC-02 is the
largest randomised phase III study reported in BTC to date. Four
hundred and ten patients with locally advanced or metastatic
CC, or gall bladder or ampullary cancer were randomised to
receive 24 weeks of either cisplatin plus gemcitabine (CisGem)
or gemcitabine (Gem) alone.39 After a median follow-up of
8.2 months, the median overall survival was 11.7 months for the
CisGem group (n¼204) and 8.1 months for the Gem group
(n¼206), HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.80, p<0.001). The median
progression-free survival was 8.0 months for the CisGem group
versus 5.0 months for the Gem group (p<0.001). Patients in the
CisGem group also had a significantly improved tumour control
rate (81.4% vs 71.8%, p¼0.049). Overall toxicity was similar
between the arms, with a slight excess in clinically non-significant haematological toxicities for the CisGem group.39 The
small proportion of patients with PS 2 in this study did not gain
a survival advantage. Similarly, there was no clear advantage for
the small subset of patients with ampullary cancer. However,
patients with GBC (about 30% of the total cohort and wellbalanced between the arms) derived as much benefit as the
patients with CC. The efficacy of CisGem has been validated in
the Japanese equivalent of the ABC-02 study, which reported
similar outcomes.114 An investigation in the USA comparing
direct medical costs, patient time costs and quality-adjusted life
years in BTC found CisGem treatment to be cost-effective
compared with Gem monotherapy.115
There are encouraging reports of several patients being
successfully downstaged with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
converted to operability in phase II studies, with occasional
long-term survivors. Regimens combining chemotherapy with
newer targeted biological agents are now being tested.
Adjuvant therapy
There is currently no evidence to support postoperative adjuvant
therapy for CC outside a trial setting. A phase III RCT evaluated
postoperative adjuvant therapy with mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil versus surgery alone in resected pancreatobiliary carcinoma.116 A significant survival benefit for patients with GBC
was found. However, the trial was underpowered to show
a survival advantage in CC and there was no significant survival
advantage for patients with BTC overall. The UK NCRI BILCAP
study is currently accruing and compares postoperative capecitabine monotherapy with observation alone. The trial is
expected to report in 2014.82
Radiotherapy
External beam radiotherapy and chemoradiation
There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of
radiotherapy postoperatively or for unresectable disease. Radiotherapy may have important palliative valuedfor example, for
Recommendations
< Initial stent insertion for biliary obstruction should be plastic or
covered SEMS, particularly if the diagnosis and resectability
are undecided (Grade C).
< If the initial plastic stent becomes blocked, replacement with
a metal stent is favoured if the estimated survival is expected
to be >4 months (Grade B).
< Covered stents cannot be recommended for routine use based
on current evidence (Grade B).
< Surgical bypass should be reconsidered in patients with
a good estimated life expectancy where stenting has failed
(Grade C).

use based on the most recent data (Grade A).

localised metastases or uncontrolled bleeding.109e112 The role of
chemoradiation remains to be established in RCTs.
Local radiation techniques: intraoperative or intraductal
brachytherapy
A small non-randomised retrospective study of metal stent
insertion combined with external beam radiotherapy versus
stent insertion alone showed a longer survival in the combination group (10.6 vs 6.4 months) and also longer stent patency
(9.8 vs 3.7 months).109 However, overall patency rates were
shorter than previously reported for metal stents. A large
epidemiological retrospective study of 17% of 3839 patients
with intrahepatic CC (on the USA SEER database) demonstrated a small survival benefit for radiotherapy plus surgery
compared with radiotherapy alone (11 vs 7 months).110 A
similar study in 4758 patients with extrahepatic CC suggested
that palliative radiotherapy prolonged survival; however, the
benefit associated with surgery and/or radiotherapy was not
significant after controlling for potential confounders.111 In
a small prospective randomised study of perihilar CC, 21
patients with percutaneous stenting followed by intraluminal Ir192 brachytherapy and external radiotherapy were compared
with 21 patients with stenting only. The combination group had
a significantly improved mean survival compared with the group
with stenting alone (388 vs 298 days).112 The value of intraoperative radiotherapy or brachytherapy is unproven and has
not been shown to be superior to standard chemotherapy,
chemoradiation or stenting alone.
Recurrent bile duct cancer
The prognosis for any treated patient with progressing, recurring
or relapsing bile duct cancer is poor. Further treatment depends
on several factors including prior treatment, site of recurrence,
specific symptoms and PS. Relief of recurrent jaundice usually
improves quality of life. Clinical trials should be considered if
appropriate.
Locoregional therapies
Recent literature suggests an emerging role for locoregional
therapies in intrahepatic CC, including transcatheter arterial
chemoembolisation, radiofrequency ablation and transarterial
hepatic yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolisation, which have
previously been successfully used for the treatment of HCC and
colorectal liver metastases.117e125
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE)
In a retrospective matched series of transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE, n¼72) versus supportive therapy
alone (n¼83) for unresectable intrahepatic CC, survival was
significantly improved in the TACE group (median 12.2 vs
3.3 months, p<0.001). Toxicities were significantly higher in the
TACE group but no patients died within 30 days following
TACE.117 In another retrospective analysis of 114 patients with
intrahepatic CC who underwent curative resection, adjuvant
TACE was given in 57 cases. In patients with poor prognostic
factors (tumour size >5 cm, TNM stage III/IV), 3- and 5-year
survival rates were 34% and 14% in the adjuvant TACE group
compared with 0% and 0% in the non-TACE group, respectively
(p<0.001). TACE had no effect on survival in patients without
poor prognostic factors.118
Radiofrequency ablation
Several recent small studies have suggested that percutaneous
US-guided thermal ablation for unresectable intrahepatic CC is
safe and potentially effective, particularly for primary and relatively smaller tumours.120e124 In a Chinese study, 18 patients
(8 primary and 10 recurrent cases after resection) with 25
intrahepatic CC nodules underwent US-guided thermal ablation
with curative intention.120 Complete ablation was achieved in
23 (92%) nodules (diameter 0.7e4.3 cm) and incomplete ablation was found in the remaining two tumours which were larger
(6e7 cm). There were no treatment-associated deaths. Overall
survival rates at 36 and 60 months were 30% and 30%, respectively. The patient source (primary or recurrent case, p¼0.001)
and the number of nodules (p¼0.038) were significant prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. Survival rates for
primary intrahepatic CC at 36 and 60 months were 63% and
63%, respectively.120
Radioembolisation
Radioembolisation using (90)Y microspheres was assessed in 33
patients with unresectable intrahepatic CC and appeared safe.125
Median overall survival was 22 months and time-to-progression
(TTP) was 9.8 months. Survival and TTP were significantly
prolonged in patients with ECOG 0 versus ECOG 1 or 2 (median
overall survival 29.4, 10 and 5.1 months, respectively; TTP 17.5,
6.9 and 2.4 months, respectively). Tumour burden and tumour
response were other predictors of survival (p<0.001).125
The emerging data for locoregional therapies in unresectable
CC are encouraging, but larger studies are required to determine
their efficacy.
