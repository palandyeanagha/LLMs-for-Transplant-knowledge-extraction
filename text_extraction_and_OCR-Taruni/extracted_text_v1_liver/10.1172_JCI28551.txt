Wnt proteins are a family of secreted proteins that regulate many aspects of cell growth, differentiation, function, and death. Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular links between Wnt
signaling and bone development and remodeling since initial reports that mutations in the Wnt coreceptor lowdensity lipoprotein receptor–related protein 5 (LRP5) are causally linked to alterations in human bone mass. Of
the pathways activated by Wnts, it is signaling through the canonical (i.e., Wnt/β-catenin) pathway that increases
bone mass through a number of mechanisms including renewal of stem cells, stimulation of preosteoblast replication, induction of osteoblastogenesis, and inhibition of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis. This pathway
is an enticing target for developing drugs to battle skeletal diseases as Wnt/β-catenin signaling is composed of
a series of molecular interactions that offer potential places for pharmacological intervention. In considering
opportunities for anabolic drug discovery in this area, one must consider multiple factors, including (a) the roles
of Wnt signaling for development, remodeling, and pathology of bone; (b) how pharmacological interventions
that target this pathway may specifically treat osteoporosis and other aspects of skeletal health; and (c) whether
the targets within this pathway are amenable to drug intervention. In this Review we discuss the current understanding of this pathway in terms of bone biology and assess whether targeting this pathway might yield novel
therapeutics to treat typical bone disorders.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling
Wnt signaling plays an important role in development and maintenance of many organs and tissues, including bone (1). Although
Wnt proteins signal through several pathways to regulate cell
growth, differentiation, function, and death, the Wnt/β-catenin
or canonical pathway appears to be particularly important for
bone biology (reviewed in refs. 2, 3). The complexities of the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in multiple cell types have been
reviewed elsewhere (4, 5), and an outline ofthe pathway isshown in
Figure 1. If Wnts are not expressed or if their binding to receptors
isinhibited, degradation of β-catenin isfacilitated via interactions
with a protein complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC), axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). APC and axin
act asscaffold proteins allowing GSK3 to bind and phosphorylate
β-catenin, identifying it for degradation by the β-TrCP–mediated
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.
Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs upon binding of
Wnt to the 7-transmembrane domain–spanning frizzled receptor and low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 5 and 6
(LRP5/6) coreceptors(Figure 1). Signals are generated through the
proteins Disheveled, Axin, and Frat-1, which disrupt the protein
complex and inhibit the activity of GSK3, thus causing hypophosphorylation of its substrate, β-catenin (6). Stabilized β-catenin
then accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus,
where this transcriptional coactivator interacts with T cell factor/
lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors to mediate many of the effects of Wnts on gene transcription.
Binding of β-catenin displaces transcriptional corepressors (e.g.,
silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors and nuclear receptor corepressor [SMRT/NCoR]) bound to TCF/LEF and
recruitstranscriptional coactivators(e.g., p300 and cAMP response
element–binding protein [p300/CBP]) (7).
Wntsignaling istightly regulated by members ofseveral families
of secreted antagonists. Interactions between Wnts and frizzled
receptors are inhibited by members of the secreted frizzled-related
protein (sFRP)family and Wntinhibitory factor 1 (WIF-1; Figure 1).
LRP5/6 coreceptor activity is inhibited by members of the sclerostin (SOST gene product) and Dickkopf (Dkk) families, all of which
bind LRP5/6. Dkk1, -2, and -4 bind with various affinitiesto LRP5
and LRP6. Interaction ofthe Dkk/LRP complex with kremen internalizesthe complex for degradation,thus diminishing the number
of Wnt coreceptors available for signaling (8).
Wnt signaling regulates bone mass
Bone mass is influenced by the balance achieved between boneforming cells (osteoblasts) and bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts).
Loss-of-function mutations in human LRP5 are associated with
osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, which is characterized by
low bone mineral density and skeletal fragility (9). In contrast,
mutations in the N terminus of human LRP5 (e.g., G171V) that
reduce affinity of LRP5 for Dkk1 are associated with high bone
mass (10–12). These human bone phenotypes are largely supported by animal models with altered expression of LRP5. For example,
Lrp5–/– mice have a low bone mass phenotype due to reduced proliferation of precursor cells (13). Furthermore, mice that overexpressthe G171V LRP5 mutant in osteoblasts have enhanced osteoblast activity, reduced osteoblast apoptosis (Figure 2), and a high
bone mass phenotype reminiscent of that observed in humans
with this mutation (14). Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type
Lrp5 leads to a more subtle bone phenotype, suggesting that the
G171V mutant has a gain-in-function phenotype suggestive of a
dominant-positive mechanism. Loss of bone mineral density in

Lrp5–/– mice isfurther exacerbated by loss of an Lrp6 allele,suggesting that Wntssignal through both the LRP5 and LRP6 coreceptors
to influence bone mass (15). Finally, disruption of endogenous
LRP inhibitors such as Dkk1 (11) or sclerostin (16) increases the
ability of Wnts to stabilize β-catenin and stimulate osteogenesis,
further cementing the evidence that signaling from LRP coreceptors is important for bone development.
Direct roles for Wnt signaling in the regulation of trabecular
bone formation and bone mass were further supported by studies of mice lacking the soluble Wnt inhibitor sFRP1 (17). These
mice show reduced osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosisin vivo, and
results from work with marrow-derived cells from Sfrp1–/– mice
suggest that in addition to preventing apoptosis, Wnt signaling
may also increase bone by stimulating differentiation and replication of osteoblasts (Figure 2). While bone phenotypes observed
in mice with altered expression or activity of Wnt coreceptors or
inhibitors support a simple and direct relationship between Wnt
signaling and bone mass, the relationship between members of the
Wntsignaling pathway and bone biologywill undoubtedly be more
complex. For example, a recent report indicates that, as expected,
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces osteoblastogenesis
and that these effects are blocked by Dkk1 (18). However, during
osteoblastogenesis Wnt/β-catenin signaling — presumably initiated by Wnt7b — induces expression of Dkk2, which isthen surprisingly required for subsequent mineralization. Thus Dkk2–/– mice
have increased secreted matrix (osteoid) but impaired mineralization, culminating in an osteopenic phenotype (18). While mineralization is partially rescued in vitro by Dkk2, another inhibitor of
Wnt signaling, sFRP3, fails to stimulate mineralization, suggesting that Dkk2 may act through a mechanism distinct from Wnt
antagonizing activity. This concept is not unprecedented assFRP1
inhibits osteoclastogenesis through binding of receptor activator
of NF-kB ligand (RANKL; ref. 19) and reorients axonal growth
through interactions with frizzled 2 (20). Although the functional
significance is unknown, other Wnt inhibitors such as WIF-1 and
sFRP2 may also be induced in osteoblasts (21).
Taken together, these studies suggest that endogenous Wnt
signaling plays an important role in osteoblastogenesis and bone
formation (10–18); however, which of the 19 Wnts are involved has
yet to be delineated. It is likely that Wnt activity in bone marrow
varies throughout stages of development and has important contributions from several Wnts. One of these may be Wnt7b, which
is induced during osteoblastogenesis(18, 22). Another is Wnt10b,
which is expressed in bone marrow (23, 24), and deficiency of
which leads to reduced trabecular bone mass, bone mineral density, and serum osteocalcin level (24). In addition, Wnt1, Wnt4,
Figure 1
Elements of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In the liganded state, binding of Wnt to the frizzled receptor inhibits GSK3 activity through mechanisms involving Axin, Frat-1, and Disheveled (Dsh). β-Catenin accumulates and is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to TCF/LEF, causing displacement of transcriptional corepressors (e.g., silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors and nuclear receptor corepressor; SMRT/NCoR) with 
transcriptional coactivators (e.g., p300 and cAMP response element–binding protein; p300/CBP). Wnt signaling can be blocked by interactions of 
Wnt with inhibitory factors including WIF-1 and sFRP or the interaction of LRP5/6 with the Dkk/Kremen complex or sclerostin (SOST gene product). 
Phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3 stimulates β-catenin degradation. Potential intervention points for drug therapy (i–v) are indicated.

and Wnt14 are expressed in calvarial tissue and osteoblast cultures
(13), and Wnt1 and Wnt3a are induced by bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) in a mesenchymal precursor cell line (25). However,
because Wnts function through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, analysis of those Wnts that specifically contribute to bone
formation, as well as the frizzled receptors mediating their effects,
will require in situ analysis of gene expression within bone and
marrow and confirmation by genetic approaches.
Wnt regulates osteoblastogenesis 
through the canonical pathway
One of the mechanisms whereby Wnt signaling increases bone
formation is via stimulation of the development of osteoblasts,
and there is considerable in vitro evidence supporting a role for
Wnt/β-catenin (i.e., canonical)signaling in this process(Figure 2).
For example, inhibition of GSK3 enzymatic activity with lithium
chloride (LiCl; ref. 26) or small molecules (e.g., Chir99021 and
LY603281-31-8) stimulates mesenchymal precursors to differentiate into osteoblasts (24, 27, 28). This concept is supported by
observations with Wnt3a, Wnt1, Wnt10b, and constitutively active
β-catenin, all of which activate signaling through β-catenin and
stimulate osteoblastogenesis, while Dkk1, which inhibits this
pathway, reduces osteoblastogenesis (24, 28, 29). Importantly,
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling also inhibits adipogenesis of
mesenchymal precursors (30, 31), which may have clinical importance given the positive correlation reported between marrow adipose content and bone fractures (32).
Further evidence that Wnt signaling increases bone mass
through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway comes from the results
of in vivo studies using pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3β.
For example, administration of LiCl for 4 weeks dramatically
increased bone formation rate and number of osteoblasts in
C57BL/6 mice (33). Similar results were obtained in osteopenic Lrp5–/– mice, indicating that LiCl acts downstream of LRP5.
Consistent with the in vitro results described above, inhibition
of GSK3 reduced the number of marrow adipocytes over this
period. LiCl influences other signaling pathways besides Wnt,
and GSK3 regulates many proteins besides β-catenin. However,
the fact that LiCl stabilizes β-catenin and increases TCF-based
reporter gene activity and expression of Wnt-responsive genes
strongly supports a mechanism mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway (33).
Role of β-catenin at various stages 
of osteoblast development
During embryonic development, the level of β-catenin is
increased in differentiating osteoblasts (34), and pharmacological and genetic approaches have indicated that Wnt signaling
increases bone mass through a number of mechanisms including renewal of stem cells (35), stimulation of preosteoblast replication (13), induction of osteoblastogenesis (13), and inhibition
of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis (Figure 2) (17). These variable results likely arise because Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates bone development and accrual through different mechanisms at different stages of life. This concept is supported by the
results of studies using mouse models in which targeted deletion of β-catenin occurs early or late in osteoblastogenesis. For
example, dermo-Cre mice have a targeted deletion of β-catenin
in mesenchymal precursors of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis
(36, 37). These mice show a reduction in all relevant markers of
osteogenesis and an absence of both endochondral and intramembranous bone at E18.5 in the developing embryo. Thus

β-catenin is required for the early stages of osteoblastogenesis,
and indeed its absence steers the fate of mesenchymal precursors
toward chondrogenesis (34, 37).
To examine the importance of β-catenin later in osteoblast
development, constitutively active β-catenin was overexpressed
in osteoblasts expressing collagen αI-CRE (38). These mice manifest an osteopetrotic phenotype; however, no change in osteoblast activity or histomorphometric evidence of bone formation
was observed. Instead, bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis
were defective due to increased expression of osteoprotegerin,
a decoy receptor for RANKL (38). On the other hand, targeted
deletion of β-catenin in mature osteoblasts with collagen αI-Cre
caused increased bone resorption and a marked increase in the
number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive (TRAPpositive) multinucleated osteoclasts due to reduced expression of
osteoprotegerin (38). Consistent with these observations in mice,
autosomal-dominant osteopetrosis type I patients with a gainof-function T253I mutation in LRP5 have decreased numbers
of small osteoclasts, although osteoclastogenesis in response to
RANKL was normal in vitro (39). Finally, mice in which β-catenin
has been deleted using osteocalcin-CRE and mice in which
β-catenin has been activated with conditional Apc mutants provide further support for the finding that β-catenin regulates
osteoblast differentiation. In addition, these mice also demonstrate that β-catenin regulates osteoclastogenesis through effects
on expression of osteoprotegerin and RANKL (40).
A role for β-catenin in regulation of osteoclastogenesis has been
clearly delineated through multiple genetic approaches; however,
there is also considerable evidence that altering Wnt signaling
upstream of β-catenin does not increase bone formation through
altered resorption. For example, alterations in osteoclast variables
were not observed in Lrp5–/–, Sfrp1–/–, or Wnt10b–/– mice or with LiCl
treatment (13, 17, 24). One can speculate that complete loss or
overexpression of β-catenin are more extreme perturbations of this
signaling system than are normally observed through alterations
of Wnt activity earlier in the pathway. In addition, constitutively
active β-catenin may lack autoregulatory pathways triggered by
the Wnt pathway.
Mechanisms whereby Wnt signaling 
regulates bone mass
As described above, Wnt signaling increases bone mass through
diverse mechanisms. While effects on osteoblastogenesis and
apoptosis have been studied in some mechanistic detail and will
be elaborated upon here, this is not to diminish the potential
importance of other mechanisms mentioned earlier that are less
well studied, including renewal of stem cells (35), stimulation of
preosteoblast replication (13), and enhancement of osteoblast
activity (Figure 2) (13, 17).
Osteoblastogenesis versus adipogenesis. There is considerable evidence for the existence of a mesenchymal stem cell that gives rise
to both osteogenic and adipogenic cells, and in vitro and in vivo
experimental models have provided compelling evidence for a
reciprocal relationship between these cell lineages (41–43). For
example, cultures of bone marrow stromal cells as well as immortalized clonal lines (e.g., ST2) are capable of both osteogenic and
adipogenic differentiation, depending upon culture conditions.
Furthermore, single cell clones from bone marrow can differentiate in vitro into either adipocytes or osteoblasts (44). In addition
to signaling by Wnt/β-catenin, a number of factors influence the
fate of these marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, including
retinoic acid, BMPs, vitamin D3, glucocorticoids, notch, sonic
hedgehog, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone–related
peptide, and PPARγ ligands(24, 43, 45–47). Indeed, Wntsignaling
may be required for or even mediate a subset of effects of BMP,
parathyroid hormone, and hedgehog on cell fate decisionstoward
osteoblastogenesis (25, 48).
Pharmacological and genetic treatments that activate Wnt/
β-catenin signaling in mesenchymal precursors repress adipogenesis and stimulate osteoblastogenesis (Figure 2). In preadipocyte
models expression of Wnt does notinfluence induction ofthe transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein b (C/EBPβ)
and C/EBPδ, but Wntsignaling blocksinduction of master adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ (30). Suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with dominant-negative TCFs
or sFRPs stimulates spontaneous adipogenesis, indicating that
endogenous Wnts inhibit preadipocyte differentiation (30, 31).
Wntsignaling isinitiated in part by Wnt10b. Its expression is high
in dividing and confluent preadipocytes, and Wnt10b is rapidly
suppressed upon induction of differentiation (30, 31). In addition,
ectopic expression of Wnt10b stabilizesfree cytosolic β-catenin and
is a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis. Most conclusively, Wnt10b
antisera promotes adipogenesis when added to media of 3T3-L1
preadipocytes. Interestingly, expression of Wnt5b is transiently
induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, and adenoviral
expression of Wnt5b causes a slight increase in adipogenesis, presumably due to destabilization of β-catenin (49, 50). Wnt5b may
activate noncanonical Wnt signaling, which has been reported to
antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling (51), or Wnt5b may compete
with other Wnts for binding to frizzled receptors. Further work is
required to assess whether Wnt5b inhibits osteoblastogenesis.
Mesenchymal precursors such as ST2 cells express low but biologically relevantlevels of adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα
and PPARγ and osteoblasttranscription factorssuch asrunt-related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2), msh homeobox homolog 2 (Msx2),
distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5), and osterix (24). Expression of these
2 classes of transcription factors is maintained at low levels due
to negative feedback, and imbalance leads to differentiation. For
example, Msx2 bindsto C/EBPα and inhibitsits ability to transactivate the PPARγ promoter, and Msx2 represses adipogenesis(52, 53).
Similarly, PPARγ bindsto Runx2 and inhibitstransactivation ofthe
osteocalcin promoter, and activation of PPARγ represses osteoblastogenesis(54). Constitutive Wnt/β-catenin signaling favors expression of osteoblast genes atthe expense of adipocyte genes(24). Wnt
signaling could regulate the fate of mesenchymal precursors by
repressing adipocyte transcription factors, stimulating osteoblast
transcription factors, or both (Figure 2). Increased bone mass in
Pparg+/– mice, increased osteogenesisin precursor cellsfrom PPARγnull mice, and decreased bone density following treatment of mice
with a PPARγ agonist make this factor an attractive target (55–57).
Indeed, suppression of PPARγ is required for Wnt10b to stimulate
osteoblastogenesis (24). A recent report indicated that a transcriptionalregulator,transcription coactivatorwith PDZ domain (TAZ),
mediatesthe effects of BMP-2 on mesenchymal cell fate by inhibiting PPARγ activity while stimulating that of Runx2; however, the
potential role of TAZ-mediated effects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
has not been reported (58).
Apoptosis. Induction of bone accrual in mouse models with
increased Wnt signaling is due in part to reduced apoptosis of
osteoblasts and osteocytes (14, 17, 59). Wnt signaling inhibits

apoptosisin response to a wide variety of cellularinsults, including
chemotherapeutic agents and serum deprivation (60–62). Prevention of apoptosis occurs in a wide variety of cell models, including
mesenchymal precursors, preosteoblasts, and osteoblasts. While
signaling by canonical Wnts appearsto universally protect against
apoptosis through mechanisms involving β-catenin and activation of PI3K/Akt, other mechanistic aspects are dependent on cell
type. For example, in rat intestinal epithelial cells, induction of
cyclooxygenase-2 andWnt-induced secreted protein 1 (WISP-1), but
not Bcl-2, are critical for repression of apoptosis caused by c-myc
(60). In preadipocytes, increased production of insulin-like growth
factors feeds back through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to
block apoptosis due to serum deprivation (61). Finally, in preosteoblasts, activation of Src, ERK, and Akt by Wnt3a is required for
prevention of apoptosis. In this cell model, Wnt signaling induces
expression of Bcl-2 through a process requiring active ERK (62).
The mechanism or mechanisms by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling
brings about an increase in the number of osteoblasts and osteocytes in vivo have yet to be determined.
Wnt signaling as cause and treatment for bone diseases
Historically, diseases of bone loss have been treated with agents
that block bone resorption; however, this type of therapy stimulates only a modest increase in bone mineral density, and osteoporotic patients retain an elevated risk for fracture. With the recent
introduction of teriparatide (human parathyroid hormone 1–34)
into clinical practice, the potential to treat patients with an anabolic therapy was introduced (63). This drug is proven to decrease
risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (64). Pharmaceuticals that specifically
activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in bone also hold tremendous
promise as anabolic agents that may add to or complement treatment with teriparatide (3). Potential patient populations may
include those with osteopenia or osteoporosis due to (a) causes
unrelated to Wnt signaling and causes that do not impair effects
of Wntsignaling on bone formation and (b) defectsin Wntsignaling, as long as the drug acts downstream of the defect.
In any drug discovery program, issues of safety are paramount,
especially for treatment of chronic disease of bone that will likely
involve long-term therapy. Thisis particularly true for activators of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling, since Wnts were first identified as insertion sites for mouse mammary tumor virus (64) and since mutations in APC and β-catenin that increase Wnt signaling are associated with colon and other cancers (65). When considering how
best to target drug discovery in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, identification and screening upstream in the pathway is more promising than targeting β-catenin and downstream events. For example, humans and mice with altered expression of LRP5, sFRP1,
and Wnt10b all have alterations in bone mass with relatively few
effects elsewhere (9, 17, 24). Side effects of drug therapy targeting
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are unknown. Functional haploinsufficiency for LRP5 may cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy
(66), and activation of Wnt10b signaling in fat decreases adiposity
and increases skin thickness (67). In contrast, altering expression
of β-catenin causes profound developmental effects(68, 69) and in
bone regulates osteoblastogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and probability of benign osteomatas(34, 38, 40). This underscores also that
drugs should be selected for moderate effects on the pathway, as
strong activators will have a much higher probability of effects in
nontarget tissues. Despite the risks, the paucity of anabolic drugs
for regulating bone mass and the compelling evidence demonstrating that Wnt/β-catenin signaling stimulates bone formation
justify the considerable effort being put forth by the pharmaceutical industry to target this pathway.
Osteoporosis. Osteoporosisis a prevalentskeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength and consequent increased
risk of fractures. Postmenopausal women are at higher risk for
developing osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures. There
are multiple etiologies for this complex metabolic bone disease,
and, with the exception of osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome
due to mutations in LRP5 (9), it is unknown whether Wnt signaling plays a role. Interestingly, dexamethasone increases expression of Dkk1 and sFRP1 and represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling
in human osteoblasts, suggesting a role for this pathway in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis(70–72). Further mechanistic work
in human osteoporosis will be important to fully understand the
relevance of Wnt signaling pathways in this disease.
To addressthe effects of increasing Wnt signaling on bone mass
under normal and osteoporosis conditions, expression of Wnt10b
was directed to bone marrow using the fatty acid–binding protein
4 (FABP4) promoter(24, 67). Wnt10b increased bone mineral density throughout the weight-bearing skeleton. Increased trabecular
bone was observed throughout the endocortical compartment,
with a 4-fold increase in bone volume fraction in the femoral distal
metaphysis and improved material properties including strength.
Although there was a trend toward decreased bone volume fraction and mineral density in ovariectomized FABP4-Wnt10b mice,
these mice were protected due to their higher initial bone mass.
Thus the potential health benefit from increasing Wnt/β-catenin
signaling by Wnt10b is underscored by resistance to bone loss
associated with estrogen depletion as well as aging (24).
Transgenic models such as FABP4-Wnt10b mice provide supporting evidence that Wnt signaling can impair development of
osteoporosis; however, expression of Wnt10b in marrow of these
transgenic mice is not inducible and may have altered bone development (24). Thus it is more desirable to evaluate approaches
in skeletally mature animals with pharmacological activators
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Recent work indicates that inhibition of GSK3 increases bone formation, density, and strength
in an ovariectomized rat model (27). Ovariectomy of rats at 6
months of age leads to significant trabecular bone loss within 4
weeks, with a high turnover signature that resembles bone loss
observed in postmenopausal women (73). Oral administration
of LY603281-31-8, a GSK3α and -3β dual inhibitor, to ovariectomized rats for 2 months resulted in an increase in trabecular
area, thickness, and number that was accompanied by improved
trabecular connectivity as evidenced by decreased trabecular
separation (27). Accordingly, biomechanical analysis found that
LY603218-31-8 significantly improved vertebral strength, stiffness, and work to failure relative to ovariectomized controls.
In addition, bone mineral density at both cancellous and cortical sites was significantly improved (27). The magnitude of
responses to GSK3 inhibition was comparable to that observed
with once-daily administration of teriparatide. In addition, genes
reflecting enhanced osteoblast activity such as Runx2, collagen
αI, collagen αV, bone sialoprotein, and biglycan were induced in
trabecular bone obtained from distal femur. Increased bone mass
was also observed with LiCl treatment of SAMP6 mice, which
have premature osteoporosis due to impaired osteoblastogenesis
(33). Taken together, these observations offer strong evidence for

an increase in bone formation in response to inhibitors of GSK3
and suggest that activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling show
promise as therapeutic agents for osteoporosis.
Bone-related cancers. Given the important role of Wnt signaling
for bone development, it is possible that agents modifying this
pathway could be of value to skeletal disorders other than osteoporosis. For example, Tian and coworkers recently analyzed the
bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
and identified an increase in Dkk1 in the serum of these patients
(74). Notably, the severity of the bone lesion was correlated with
increased Dkk1 levels in these patients. The authors indicate that
not all newly diagnosed patients show elevated levels of Dkk1
in their serum and that this finding may be restricted to a subset of end-stage severe multiple myeloma patients. The authors
propose that Dkk1 produced by myeloma cells blocks differentiation of osteoblasts and promotesthe early proliferation leading to
reduced viability of pluripotent stem cells, later shifting the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in favor of osteoclasts
(74). This then facilitates the lytic lesions in bone that are a hallmark of this painful disease. Although expression of Dkk1 islimited to a subset ofsevere multiple myeloma patients, it is conceivable
that early intervention with activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
could slow development of bone lesions in these patients. Again,
while activation of Wntsignaling may decrease some of the painful
symptoms caused by excessive secretion of Dkk1, great care will
need to be taken in targeting this pathway in patients because of
the potential to increase progression of cancer.
Potential for Wnt signaling as a pharmacological target: 
“druggable” interventions?
Wnt/β-catenin signaling offers multiple steps that may be considered for pharmacological intervention, and some of these are
highlighted in Figure 1 (i–v). Important features to consider in
selecting drug discovery targets include the type of target (i.e.,
G protein–coupled receptors, enzymes, protein-protein interactions, or transcriptional factors), cellular location, role of the target in the pathway (centralregulator versusfine tuning), and selectivity of the target forthe pathway of interest. Historically, the best
targets for small molecules are receptors or enzymes, particularly
those at extracellular sites. Protein or antibody strategies can be
useful to target protein-protein interactions extracellularly. Obviously, selectivity of the target for bone in this case is an important
consideration to limit off-target tissue toxicities.
A review of the canonical Wntsignaling pathway suggestsseveral
interesting potential intervention points(Figure 1). (i) Availability
of Wnt for binding to frizzled receptors is regulated by binding to
Wnt inhibitory proteins such as sFRPs and WIF-1, and it is conceivable thatsmall molecules or peptides could inhibit these interactions. Support for this approach comes from results of studies
of Sfrp1–/– mice, which have increased bone formation without
other obvious phenotypes (17). (ii) Availability of the LRP5 complex for Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also regulated by proteinsfrom
the Dkk and sclerostin families. Dkk1 interferes with canonical
Wnt signaling in vertebrates by binding directly to LRP5. Simultaneously, Dkk interacts with a transmembrane protein, kremen,
which causes internalization of the Dkk/LRP complex and a loss
of Wnt signaling. Thus if interactions with Dkk1 were inhibited,
more LRP5 would be available for activation of the Wnt pathway.
Mutations in LRP5 that decrease affinity for Dkk and increase
bone mass in humans suggest that this approach might be successful (10). In addition to Dkk, recent evidence suggests that
sclerostin may also bind and inhibit signaling by LRP5/6 (75).
Thus disruption of these interactions may also yield an increase in
bone formation as evidenced by individuals with van Buchem disease (76). Protein therapeutic strategies offerthe greatest chance of
success at disrupting interactions between LRP and binding proteins, as there has been limited success at building small molecule
inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. (iii) Since the frizzled
receptor is a member of the G protein–coupled receptor family,
which has been a highly successful family for generation of small
molecule pharmacologic agents, it may be possible to foresee
small molecule screening strategies having some degree of success. However, identification of small molecule mimics for type II
G protein–coupled receptors has only been marginally successful
(77). In addition, frizzled receptors are atypical members of the
7-transmembrane–spanning domain family of G protein–coupled
receptors, and little is known about how to identify molecular
agonists for this type of receptor. In addition, identities of those
frizzled receptorsthatinfluence bone mass are unknown. (iv) Wnt/
β-catenin signaling stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3, and
a variety of small molecule inhibitors increase osteoblastogenesis
in vitro and bone formation in vivo. Although characterization of
small molecule inhibitors of GSK3 is still underway, safety issues
have not been reported for LiCl (78), which is widely used by adult
patients to treat bipolar disorder. (v) In looking at targets further
downstream of GSK3 (Figure 1), the degradation of β-catenin is
mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and inhibiting
these enzymes increases bone formation (79). However, specificity of these protease inhibitors remains a challenge in the area of
pharmaceutical intervention. Although speculative, interaction of
β-catenin/TCF with transcriptional coactivators is increased by
acetylation of β-catenin. Thus histone deacetylase inhibitors could
conceivably be used to increase expression of specific genes pertinent to bone cells, although specificity is likely to be an issue (7).
Safety considerations in targeting the Wnt pathway. Treatment of
chronic disorders such as osteoporosis require heightened awareness of safety considerations, and given the important role of
the Wnt pathways in development, the toxicologic potential of
molecules modulating the Wnt pathway should be given thorough consideration. One area of speculative concern with regard
to targeting of drugs to the Wnt pathway has been induction of
cancer. While to date no reports connecting human tumors to
mutation or dysregulation of genes encoding Wnt ligands or
receptors have been made, certain components within the Wnt
pathway have been implicated. For example, nuclear β-catenin
functions to maintain the proliferative potential of keratinocytes
in culture (80). A more direct relationship with human tumors is
suggested by elevation of β-catenin levels in various cancers (81),
including some types of skin cancer, as a moderate increase of
β-catenin nuclear staining was observed with basal cell carcinomas(82). Mutationsin APC or AXIN2 leading to accumulation of
β-catenin have also been associated with colorectal cancer, as have
activating mutations in β-catenin (83–87).
In addition to β-catenin, other players in the canonical Wnt
signaling cascade have been linked to tumorigenesis. Inhibition
of GSK3 results in increased cyclin D1, cyclin E, and c-Myc, and
overexpression of these cell cycle regulators has been linked with
tumor cell formation (88, 89), leading to concern that long-term
inhibition of GSK3 may increase the risk of carcinogenesis. This
of course will be an important safety consideration for develop-

ment of GSK3 inhibitors. However, itshould be possible to generate inhibitors of this enzyme without a significant cancer risk, as
long-term use of the nonspecific GSK3 inhibitor lithium is not
known to be associated with increased risk of cancer in bipolar
patients(78). Furthermore, activation of GSK3 by histone deacetylase inhibitors has been associated with targeting tumor cellsfor
elimination by natural killer cells (90). As molecules emerge from
ongoing drug discovery efforts that target aspects of the Wnt signaling pathway, attention to tumor potential and other toxicities will be of paramount importance. Hopefully the worldwide
efforts currently underway to target Wnt/β-catenin signaling will
be successful and generate therapeutics that positively impact
human skeletal health.
