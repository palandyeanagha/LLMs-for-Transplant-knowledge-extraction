ABSTRACT
Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric transport
protein highly conserved through vertebrate
evolution and synthesized in the liver, choroid
plexus, and retinal pigment epithelium. TTR
transports the thyroid hormone thyroxine and
the retinol-binding protein (RBP) bound to
retinol (vitamin A). Mutations in TTR are associated with inherited transthyretin amyloidosis
(ATTRv), a progressive, debilitating disease that
is ultimately fatal and is characterized by
misfolding of TTR and aggregation as amyloid
fibrils, predominantly leading to cardiomyopathy or polyneuropathy depending on the particular TTR mutation. Transthyretin amyloid
cardiomyopathy can also occur as an age-related disease caused by misfolding of wild-type
TTR. Apart from its transport role, little is
known about possible additional physiological
functions of TTR. Evidence from animal model
systems in which TTR has been disrupted via
gene knockout is adding to our cumulative
understanding of TTR function. There is growing evidence that TTR may have a role in neuroprotection and promotion of neurite
outgrowth in response to injury. Here, we
review the literature describing potential roles
of TTR in neurobiology and in the pathophysiology of diseases other than ATTR amyloidosis.
A greater understanding of these processes may
also contribute to further clarification of the
pathology of ATTR and the effects of potential
therapies for TTR-related conditions.

Key Summary Points
Transthyretin is a highly conserved
protein that transports the thyroid
hormone thyroxine and the retinolbinding protein bound to retinol
(vitamin A).
Mutations in TTR are associated with
ATTR amyloidosis, a progressive,
debilitating, and ultimately fatal disease.
ATTR amyloidosis can also occur as a
spontaneous, age-related disease in
individuals with non-mutated wild-type
TTR.
Aside from its function as a transport
protein, there is a growing body of
evidence for a role for TTR in
neuroprotection and promotion of
neurite outgrowth in response to injury.
The advent of treatments for ATTR
amyloidosis based on stabilizing the TTR
structure, or reducing expression of TTR,
means that a clearer understanding of the
role of TTR in neurobiology and
pathophysiology is increasingly
important.

INTRODUCTION
Transthyretin (TTR) is a 55 kDa tetrameric
transport protein comprising four identical
subunits of 127 amino acids. TTR is synthesized
in the liver, choroid plexus, and retinal pigment
epithelium, before it is secreted into the
bloodstream, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and eye,
respectively [1].
In vivo TTR can dissociate into fragmented
and full-length monomers, which aggregate as
amyloid fibrils. These fibrils accumulate extracellularly in tissues and organs, including
mainly the peripheral nerves and heart [2, 3].
This results in transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, a serious progressive disease that displays
substantial heterogeneity, with individual differences in disease susceptibility, clinical
expression, and symptom presentation [2, 3].
There are two forms of ATTR amyloidosis:
hereditary (ATTRv; v for variant) and wild-type
(ATTRwt). These apparently share common
substantial physiopathological mechanisms [4].
Mutations in the TTR gene can lead to dominantly inherited ATTR amyloidosis in adult life.
This might occur from approximately age 30
onward, but more commonly after 50 years of
age, with clinical and geographic differences
between early-onset and late-onset forms of the
disease [5]. In ATTRwt, the normal protein
typically aggregates in the heart, resulting in a
progressive pseudohypertrophic, restrictive cardiomyopathy related to aging [3]. Males are
more susceptible to ATTRwt, but the reasons
behind this gender bias are still unknown.
Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy can
also occur in carriers of TTR mutations that are
associated with a propensity for amyloid fibril
aggregation in cardiac tissue; examples of
specific mutations that primarily lead to cardiac
disease include Val122Ile [6], Leu111Met [7],
Thr60Ala [8], and Ile68Leu [9].
The most common presentation of ATTRv is
polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) [10]. This accounts
for the majority of ATTRv cases worldwide, with
endemic foci in Portugal, Japan, and Sweden.
The predominant genotype is Val30Met. ATTRPN is characterized by axonal, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy that progresses upward from the feet and hands, is
associated with autonomic dysfunction, and
proceeds to death within an average of 10 years
[10].
Until 2011, liver transplant was the only
approach for treating ATTRv. This worked by
replacing a variant TTR-producing liver with a
normal, wild-type TTR-expressing organ. Over
396 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:395–402

2000 patients with ATTR amyloidosis have
received liver transplants, and this has
improved life expectancy in well-selected
patient populations [11, 12]. Nevertheless, the
complexity, costs, and risks associated with liver
transplantation have fueled a search for alternative and less intrusive treatments for ATTR
amyloidosis.
Validated treatment options for ATTR amyloidosis presently fall into two main categories:
(1) TTR tetramer stabilization to prevent cleavage and dissociation into monomers with subsequent amyloid fibril formation; and (2)
reduction of TTR protein expression through
targeted gene silencing [13–17].
While the medical impact of ATTR amyloidosis is becoming clearer as this under-recognized disease becomes more widely known,
knowledge of the role of TTR in healthy individuals remains limited. To facilitate greater
understanding of ATTR amyloidosis, particularly with respect to treatments that stabilize/
silence TTR, it will be necessary to improve the
characterization of the physiological TTR functions. To aid this understanding, this article
aims to review the evidence of the role of TTR in
normal physiology and in the pathophysiology
of disease other than ATTR amyloidosis.

THE ROLE OF TTR
IN THE TRANSPORT OF THYROID
HORMONES AND RETINOL
TTR was first characterized as a transporter of
the thyroid hormone thyroxine and the retinolbinding protein (RBP) bound to retinol (vitamin
A) [18]. TTR appeared during the early phase of
vertebrate evolution and, overall, its sequence is
highly conserved.[19, 20]. The major differences
in sequence between TTR in fish and terrestrial
vertebrates involve the residues that form the
binding site for RBP [21], and it is worth noting
that fish TTR does not bind RBP. In spite of
these differences, the quaternary structure and
overall shape of the native protein is almost
identical among different species [22]. Therefore, it appears that the most conserved function is the transport of thyroid hormones and
that vitamin A transport came later in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates.
HOW ESSENTIAL IS TTR IN LIVING
ORGANISMS?
The complete absence of TTR in a human has
not been reported. Mouse TTR shares 80%
amino acid homology with human TTR, so it
may be expected that insights into the physiological function of human TTR could be gained
through the generation of TTR knockout (KO)
mice. Such mice are viable, appear phenotypically normal, and remain fertile. One
notable difference with respect to wild-type
(WT) animals is that levels of serum retinol,
RBP, and thyroid hormone are significantly
reduced, demonstrating that TTR has a role in
maintaining normal levels of these metabolites
in plasma [23]. In tissue samples from the liver,
kidney, cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus
from TTR KO mice, thyroxine levels are normal,
confirming that TTR is not crucial for thyroxine
delivery to tissues [24]. RBP levels in the liver of
TTR KO mice are 60% higher than those of wildtype mice, suggesting that the absence of TTR
may reduce secretion of RBP-retinol from the
liver [25]. Further phenotypic investigation of
TTR knockout mice suggests a broader range of
functions, particularly in the physiology of the
nervous tissue, as discussed in the following
sections.
TTR AND NEUROPROTECTION
Due to the impact of TTR in the peripheral
nervous system (PNS) in ATTR-PN, a putative
physiological function for the protein in nerve
biology was investigated. Studies with TTR KO
mice demonstrated sensorimotor impairment
and a delayed functional recovery following
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:395–402 397

sciatic nerve crush in the absence of TTR. This
phenotype was rescued by expression of human
TTR in the TTR null background, demonstrating
that TTR has an important role in peripheral
nerve function and repair [26, 27]. The effect of
TTR on nerve regeneration was related to neuritogenic activity of the protein mediated by the
megalin receptor, and to an impact on axonal
retrograde transport in PNS neurons [27].
TTR was also shown to have a neuroprotective role in the central nervous system (CNS).
This was initially investigated by studies
demonstrating an impact of TTR on memory.
Studies by Sousa et al. showed that 5-month-old
TTR KO mice had evidence of memory impairment compared with WT mice, an effect that
was not seen in aged animals. Moreover, in aged
WT mice, the levels of TTR were reduced compared with young mice [28]. These observations
suggest that the absence of TTR accelerates the
decline in cognitive performance commonly
associated with aging. Supporting this hypothesis, a reduction in TTR expression was
demonstrated in aged memory-impaired rats
compared with aged memory-unimpaired rats
[29]. In this study, experiments with mice
showed that TTR KO mice presented age-related
memory deficits, a phenotype that was rescued
by administration of retinoic acid [29].
In additional studies assessing behavior in
TTR KO mice, it was shown that the absence of
TTR was associated with a reduction in depressive-like behavior and an increase in exploratory activity. These behavioral effects of the
absence of TTR were thought to be mediated by
modulation of the noradrenergic system [30].
Other studies assessed behavioral phenotypes in
both TTR KO and RBP KO mice, which showed
that both genotypes were associated with mild
behavioral phenotypes. Also, both TTR KO and
RBP KO mice presented neurodegeneration in
the CA3 region of the hippocampus and an
impairment in adult neurogenesis. However,
these phenotypes were more aggravated in RBP
KO mice, suggesting that the behavioral effects
of TTR silencing are discrete and unlikely to be
related to its function as an RBP carrier [31].
TTR has also been associated with a role in
neuroprotection after brain injury caused by
ischemia, although this was only seen under
conditions in which the heat shock response
was compromised [32]. Using models in which
brain ischemia was surgically induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO), it was shown that TTR KO mice
heterozygous for heat shock factor 1 (and
therefore with a compromised heat shock
response) had a significant increase in cortical
infarction, cerebral edema, and microglial/
leukocyte response. Moreover, in WT animals,
TTR was localized throughout the infarct area
and was shown to be derived from the CSF [32].
Additional studies using the same models
demonstrated that the larger infarcts seen in
TTR KO mice subjected to pMCAO were related
to a downregulation of TTR and megalin in
neurons [33]. In these studies, the neuritogenic
effect of TTR on CNS neurons was also assessed.
Experiments with hippocampal neurons from
TTR KO and WT mice incubated with exogenous recombinant TTR showed that addition of
TTR significantly boosted neurite outgrowth in
both TTR KO and WT neurons, under physiological conditions and under conditions of
excitotoxic insults [33]. Interestingly, neuritogenic effects in CNS neurons were also mediated
by megalin, which places the receptor as a
major player in the TTR neuroprotective
function.
Evidence on the role of TTR in neuroprotection is not limited to in vitro and animal model
studies, as clinical studies have also provided
important insights. For example, the relationship between TTR concentration and stroke
severity was determined using the modified
Rankin Scale in a study of 585 young patients
with cerebral infarction [34]. Multivariate
logistic regression modeling showed that TTR
was an independent predictor of positive clinical outcome, suggesting that high serum concentration of TTR may be a prognostic indicator
for the outcome of cerebral infarction [34].
Additionally, a large study of 68,602 participants from two prospective studies analyzed the
association between TTR stability and vascular
disease risk and life expectancy over a mean
32-year follow-up duration [35]. Subjects were
genotyped for the presence of stabilizing
genetic variants of TTR Arg104His and
Thr119Met, which were then related to plasma
398 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:395–402

TTR levels, risk of vascular disease, thyroid
function, and life expectancy. Results showed
an association between genetic stabilization of
TTR and a decrease in the risk of cerebrovascular
disease, and an increase in life expectancy [35].
Summarizing, the neuroprotective role of
TTR is reflected physiologically by its neuritogenic activity, which is observed in both PNS
and CNS neurons, and by a function in preservation of memory during aging. In pathological
conditions, TTR has a protective role after nerve
lesion and brain injury such as ischemia.
TTR AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
As discussed, TTR appears to have biological
functions that are most likely independent of its
role as a carrier for thyroid hormones and retinol. In addition to the neuroprotective activity
discussed in the previous section, it has been
suggested that TTR may modulate neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease [36]. However,
compelling suggestions for a neuroprotective
role for TTR are also derived from different
studies related to susceptibility and protection
from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-b (Ab)
plaques in the brain, leading to progressive loss
of neurologic function [37]. The initial evidence
of a role of TTR in AD came from the observation that when Ab was added to the CSF of
patients and controls, it was sequestered by
TTR, which is the most abundant Ab-binding
protein in the CSF [38].
Transgenic mice engineered to overexpress a
mutant form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) presenting the Swedish mutation
(APPSw) are used as an animal model of AD. In
one study using this model, gene expression
profiles in mouse cerebellum and hippocampus
showed that, relative to age-matched controls,
TTR expression was selectively increased in the
hippocampus, a brain region with high levels of
Ab, suggesting the TTR upregulation in hippocampal neurons might represent a kind of
‘‘protective’’ response to the increased levels of
Ab [39]. Further studies showed that infusion of
an anti-TTR antibody into the hippocampus of
APPSw transgenic mice led to increased Ab
deposition, tau phosphorylation, neuronal loss,
and apoptosis reminiscent of the neuropathology of AD [40]. Moreover, TTR was shown to be
upregulated in hippocampal neurons in
patients with AD relative to age-matched controls without dementia [1].
Buxbaum’s group has elegantly shown that
overexpression of human TTR in the APP23 AD
transgenic mouse model results in a milder
pathological phenotype [41]. High TTR expression in these mice reduces the cognitive deterioration and deficit in spatial learning; cortical
and hippocampal deposits are also reduced by
60–75%. Overall, these results suggest that TTR
expression is linked to protection against neuronal death induced by Ab deposition [40].
The above observations have raised the
question as to the mechanism by which TTR
may impart protection against AD pathology.
According to competitive binding assays and
transmission electron microscopy studies, it has
been suggested that TTR is capable of inhibiting
and disrupting Ab fibril formation, abolishing
its neurotoxicity [42]. In another study, the
impact of TTR on protection against Ab toxicity
was proposed to be related to proteolytic
cleavage of Ab operated by TTR, as it was shown
in vitro that a proteolytically active form of
TTR, but not an inactive form, was able to
reduce Ab fibril formation, degrade neuronalsecreted Ab, and reduce Ab-induced toxicity in
hippocampal neurons [43].
More recently, the impact of TTR as a neuroprotective agent in AD has been proposed to
be related to its tetrameric stability, as drug-induced stabilization of TTR was able to increase
Ab protein uptake in cell-based assays [44]. It
has also been shown that the TTR tetramer is a
stronger inhibitor of b fibril formation than the
TTR monomer [45, 46].
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Although the physiological role of TTR is yet to
be fully defined, there is a growing body of
evidence suggesting that it might have additional important functions besides the most
commonly acknowledged transporter role
(Fig. 1). Evidence from studies with both animal
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:395–402 399

models and human samples suggests important
activity of TTR in the preservation and regulation of memory function and behavior. An
additional role in protection against neurodegeneration in AD models has been well documented, as well as neuroprotection in response
to ischemic injury and nerve regeneration and
promotion of neurite outgrowth in both PNS
and CNS neurons.
With therapies that target TTR now available, it is increasingly relevant to investigate the
full biological role of TTR in order to anticipate
the potential consequences of partial or total
reduction of TTR function. TTR stability has
been correlated with neuroprotection. Whether
long-term treatments that reduce TTR expression may lead to loss of this neuroprotective
function requires further investigation.
Despite the apparent importance of TTR in
neuroprotection, animal studies have shown
that TTR KO mice are viable, although they
exhibit alterations in behavior and memory.
Whether partial or total reduction of TTR
function in humans will be associated with
deleterious effects is, therefore, still not clear.
Additional long-term studies of the effects of
TTR therapies that stabilize or reduce TTR may
lead to a clearer understanding of the normal
biological role of TTR and further contribute to
defining the most appropriate therapeutic
options for different patients with diseases
related to TTR.
