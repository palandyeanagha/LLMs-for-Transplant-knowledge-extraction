ABSTRACT
Background
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a life-threatening disease. Hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation still represents the treatment of choice for most patients with this disease.
Design and Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis who underwent HSCT over a 17-year period at nine centers affiliated to the Italian Pediatric Hematology
Oncology Association (AIEOP). The median time from diagnosis to hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation was 0.6 years (range, 0.13–5). The donor for the first hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation was either a relative (43%) or an unrelated volunteer (57%). Fifty-four patients
(89%) had a complete genetic study, which led to the diagnoses of FHL2, due to perforin defect
(21 patients), FHL3, due to Munc 13-4 defect (14 patients), Griscelli disease (2 patients), Xlinked lymphoproliferative disease (1 patient), and CATCH22 syndrome (1 patient). No mutations were found in the remaining 15 patients. Twenty-one patients had neurological involvement at diagnosis.
Results
Three patients failed to engraft. Grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease
occurred in 31% and 17% of patients, respectively. Overall, 39 patients are alive (64%), 15
died of toxicity, 6 of progressive disease and 1 of sudden death.The 8-year overall survival probability was 58.6% (95% confidence interval, 42-72), while the cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality was 25.7% (95% confidence interval, 16-40). The outcome of
patients with a known genetic defect was comparable to that of patients without mutation.
Neurological sequelae were reported in seven patients, six of whom had central nervous system disease at diagnosis.
Conclusions
These data confirm that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents a curative treatment for a large proportion of patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, irrespective
of the underlying genetic defect.
Key words: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, perforin defect, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, transplantation-related mortality, children.

HSCT for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
haematologica | 2008; 93(11) | 1695 |
Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a lifethreatening, sepsis-like syndrome, characterized by an
uncontrolled state of hyperinflammation, caused by
unremitting activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes and
macrophages and excessive levels of cytokines.1-3
Genetic studies of patients with familial disease documented that HLH may result from mutations in different proteins involved in the cytotoxic machinery of natural killer and T cells,4 including perforin (PRF1),5 Munc
13-4,6 syntaxin11,7 Rab27a,8,9 and SAP.10 Familial HLH
(FHL) is invariably fatal if left untreated. Chemoimmunotherapy with dexamethasone, etoposide and
cyclosporine A or immunosuppression with rabbit antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine A and prednisone,
with or without intrathecal methotrexate, enables the
achievement of a transient, complete or partial clinical
response in most patients.11-14 Allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains by far the
most important curative approach, with a probability of
long-term survival reported to range from 50% to 70%,
depending on the type of donor and the intensity of the
conditioning regimen.15-17
In this study, we report the results of HSCT in 61 consecutive patients with HLH transplanted at centers affiliated to the Italian Pediatric Hematology Oncology
Association (AIEOP) network.
Design and Methods
Patients
Between January 1989 and April 2006, 102 patients
were diagnosed as having HLH and their data were
recorded in the AIEOP model 1.01 Registry form. Of
these 102 patients, 61 (60%) underwent HSCT from
either a related or an unrelated donor in nine AIEOP
centers and represent the study population recorded in
the AIEOP HSCT Registry.
18 All these patients met the
diagnostic criteria for HLH.13
Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the patients
included in the analysis. Consanguinity was reported in
four patients (7%), and familial disease in 12 patients
(20%). In 54 patients (89%), a complete genetic study
for HLH-related genes was performed: 21 (39%) had biallelic PRF1 mutations (FHL type 2), 14 (26%) had FHL3
due to Munc13-4 mutations, two had Griscelli disease
(4%), one had X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
(2%), and one had CATCH22 syndrome (2%) while 15
patients resulted completely negative. Genetic studies
were incomplete or not performed in seven patients.
Neurological involvement at diagnosis, as defined by
the presence of either neurological signs, cerebro-spinal
fluid pleocytosis or characteristic alterations at brain
imaging, was found in 21 patients. 
Forty-nine patients (80%) were treated initially with
standard chemo-immunotherapy according to HLH-94
or current HLH-2004 protocols based on the use of
etoposide, dexamethasone and cyclosporine A,12-13 one
patient was treated according to the LCHI protocol for
hystiocytosis,19 eight patients were treated according to
personalized protocols, including etoposide and/or
prednisone and/or cyclosporine A, and three patients
underwent HSCT as primary treatment. Multiple intrathecal injections of methotrexate were part of treatment
for patients with neurological involvement or in the
case of progression of neurological symptoms. 
Disease status at time of HSCT was known for 60
patients and recorded as complete regression of diseaserelated signs and symptoms in 18 patients (30%), significant clinical improvement but with persistence of some
clinical or biological signs of HLH in six patients (partial
remission, 10%), or as active HLH in 36 patients (60%).
All parents or patients (when applicable) gave their
informed consent to HSCT. The HLH-2004 study,
including the indication for HSCT, was approved by the
local institutional review boards.
HSCT supportive measures and definitions
Patients were cared for in high-efficiency particulatefiltered air (HEPA) rooms during the period that they
were neutropenic; standard measures were adopted to
prevent infectious complications, such as prophylaxis
with non-absorbable antibiotics, fluconazole, acyclovir
and cotrimoxazole (this last starting from day +30).
Hyperhydration, forced diuresis and urine alkalinization
were used to prevent drug-related chemical cystitis;
mesna (mercaptoethanesodium sulphonate) was given
to patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Erythrocyte
and platelet concentrates were filtered to remove leukocytes and irradiated (25 Gy). A standard empirical
approach based on broad-spectrum antibiotics and
amphotericin-B deoxycholate, or its lipid/liposomal
derivatives, was used for the treatment of fever or suspected infection, while specific anti-infective therapy
was adopted for proven infections.20,21 Neutrophil and
platelet engraftment were defined as the first of three
consecutive days on which neutrophil and platelet
counts exceeded 0.5×109
/L and 50×109/L, respectively. 
Chimerism was assessed on whole blood by using
variable nucleotide tandem repeats. The presence of
>95% of donor-derived cells was defined as full donor
chimerism, while the presence of > 5% of host-derived
cells was considered as mixed chimerism. 
Standard criteria were used to diagnose and to grade
acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and
transplant-related toxicity.
22-24 Acute GvHD was
assessed in all patients with myeloid engraftment, while
chronic GvHD was evaluated only in patients surviving
beyond day +100 after HSCT. The Lansky play score or
Karnofsky score was used as appropriate to evaluate
post-HSCT performance status. 
Statistical analysis
Patients’ characteristics were compared using the χ2 or
Fisher’s exact test (as appropriate) in the case of discrete
variables, or the Mann-Whitney test in the case of continuous variables. The end-points of the study were
engraftment of neutrophils and platelets, transplantation-related mortality (TRM), cumulative incidence and
grade of acute and chronic GvHD, and probability of
overall survival. The follow-up time was calculated

S. Cesaro et al. 
| 1696 | haematologica | 2008; 93(11)
from the date of HSCT to the date of death or, for the
patients alive, to the date of last follow-up. Engraftment
and TRM for the first HSCT were estimated by the
cumulative incidence method (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah
Hintze, J. 2001) taking into account competing events;
the differences between subgroups were compared
with the Gray’s k-sample test (R, version 1.9;
http://www.r-project.org). A competing event for engraftment was early death (within 30 days for neutrophils
and 60 days for platelets) after HSCT for disease progression or toxicity. A competing event for TRM was
death due to progression of disease.25
Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method with differences between subgroups compared
using the log-rank test Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA).26 All results are expressed as 8-year probabilities or 8-year cumulative incidences (%) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Host-, donor-, and transplant-related characteristics were included in the analysis of prognostic factors for TRM and overall survival.
The following variables were analyzed: patients’ gender, age at HSCT, time interval between diagnosis and
HSCT, status of HLH at HSCT (complete remission +
partial remission vs. active disease), type of donor (related HLA identical vs. other), stem cell source (bone marrow vs. other sources), type of conditioning regimen
(total body irradiation, yes vs. no; busulfan-based regimen vs. other; fludarabine-based regimen vs. other; use
of anti-lymphocyte serum, yes vs. no), type of GvHD
prophylaxis (graft manipulation, yes vs. no;
cyclosporine-A alone vs. other regimens with or without cyclosporine-A), median number of total nucleated
cells or CD34+ cells infused, median time to neutrophil
and platelet engraftment, acute GvHD occurrence
(grade 0-I vs. II-IV) and chronic GvHD (no vs. limited or
extensive). The variables found to be significant in univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic
regression analysis. All reported p values are two-sided,
and a significance level of α= 0.05 was used. Follow-up
data are as of December 31st, 2007.

HSCT for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
haematologica | 2008; 93(11) | 1697 |
an time interval from diagnosis to HSCT was 0.6 years
(range, 0.13–5). The donor was an unrelated volunteer
in 35 cases (57%); of the 26 related donors (43%), 12
were HLA-identical siblings and 14 HLA-disparate relatives. The source of stem cells was bone marrow in 49
cases (80%), peripheral blood in six (10%), and cord
blood in another six cases (10%). 
A busulfan-based combination of myeloablative
drugs was adopted in 45 HSCT (74%); one patient
received myeloablative chemotherapy with etoposide
and melphalan. A conditioning regimen with reduced
extra-hematologic toxicity based on fludarabine was
adopted in 11 HSCT (18%). Total body irradiation was
used in four patients. 
Cyclosporine alone (15 cases, 26%) or in combination
with methotrexate (27 cases, 47%) or with prednisone
(11 cases, 19%) was used for GvHD prophylaxis. 
The median number of nucleated cells infused was
6.2×108
/kg (range, 1-27.3) for bone marrow recipients,
and 5.9×107
/kg (range, 1.3-15) for cord blood recipients,
while the median number of CD34+ cells was 12×106
/kg
for patients transplanted with peripheral blood stem
cells. 
Engraftment
Four patients were not evaluable because they died
within 10 days after HSCT and primary graft failure
occurred in three patients (5%). In the remaining 54
patients neutrophil recovery was obtained at a median
time of 15 days (range 8-31) after the allograft. Overall,
the cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was
89% (95%CI, 81-97). 
Platelet engraftment was recorded in 47 of the 54
patients who had myeloid engraftment, at a median
time of 25 days after HSCT (range, 11-122). Six of the
remaining seven patients died early (five within 2
months and one at 3 months after HSCT); one patient
achieved full donor engraftment after a second transplant. The cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment
was 78% (95%CI, 68-89). Five patients received a second HSCT because of secondary graft failure (n=4) or
HLH relapse (n=1) at a median time of 6.3 months
(range, 0.8-12.2) after the first transplant. Four of them
had both neutrophil and platelet engraftment while one
patient needed a third HSCT.
Graft-versus-host disease
Data on GvHD occurrence were not available for two
patients. Among the remaining 52 patients, grade II-III
acute GvHD occurred in 16 (31%); no patient developed
grade IV acute GvHD. Seven of 41 patients (17%) who
survived more than 100 days developed chronic GvHD:
two had limited disease and five had an extensive form
of disease. 
Transplantation-related mortality, overall survival 
and their risk factors
After a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range, 2.1-18.2)
39 patients were alive. Twenty-two patients died at a
median time of 0.18 years (range, 0.02-7.1) after HSCT
from the following causes: 15 (68%) of toxicity, six of
progressive disease (27%) and one of sudden death not
related to HSCT or its complication (5%). This last
death occurred 2.9 years after HSCT, in a patient who
was a full-donor chimera in complete remission. 
The last deaths from TRM and HLH progression
occurred 3.9 and 7.1 years after HSCT, respectively. 
The probability of overall survival at 8 years after
HSCT was 58.6% (CI, 42-72), while the overall cumulative incidence of TRM was 25.7% (95% CI, 16-40)
(Figures 1 and 2). 
Table 3 shows early organ toxicity according to
Bearman’s score. Eleven toxic deaths occurred within
day +100, due to severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD,
n=7) and infection (sepsis or pneumonia) (n=4),
accounting for a TRM rate of 18.0% (96% CI, 11-31).
Other causes of TRM beyond day +100 were hemorrhage (n=2), and severe lung disease due to chronic
GvHD (n=1) A trend although not statistically significant, to better outcome was observed among the 49
patients transplanted with an unrelated or a family mismatched donor according to the period of HSCT, nameFigure 1. Overall survival (OS) of the 61 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients.

ly after vs. before 1998, the overall survival rate being
63.9% (95% CI, 45-78) vs. 45.5% (95% CI, 17-71), and
the overall TRM rate being 21.1% (95% CI, 11-39) vs.
36.4% (95% CI, 17-79) (p=0.5, and p=0.3), respectively.
The source of stem cells did not influence the outcome,
survival probability being 83.3% (95% CI, 27-97)
among cord blood recipients, 57.7% (95% CI, 39-72)
among bone marrow recipients, and 50% (95% CI, 11-
80) among patients (p=0.5) transplanted with peripheral
blood stem cells.
None of the patient-, donor- or transplant-related
characteristics analyzed was significantly associated
with a better overall survival and/or lower TRM (data
not shown). In detail, the TRM of patients transplanted
in complete or partial remission was 33.3% (95% CI,
19-59) compared to 16.7% (95% CI, 8-35) in those
transplanted with active disease (p=0.4). The corresponding figures for overall survival were 57.3% (95% CI,
35-74) vs. 64.2% (95% CI, 41-80) (p=0.2), respectively.
Moreover, the outcome of patients with a known genetic defect was not different from that of patients with no
genetic mutation or incomplete genetic studies: overall
survival rate of 52.5% (95% CI, 25-74), vs. 62.0% (95%
CI, 38-79) (p=1.0) and TRM 25.7% (95% CI, 15-44), vs.
24.4% (95% CI, 11-53), respectively (p=0.8). 
Post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation status
of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and sequelae 
Among the 39 patients alive, 31 (79%) were full donor
chimera, while six (15%) had stable mixed chimerism,
the percentage of donor cells ranging from 60% to 80%
at the latest analysis. Two patients had autologous
reconstitution and chemotherapy was resumed in one
after disease reactivation. 
Overall, the performance status was good, the median Lansky play score or Karnofsky score being 100
(range, 80-100). Fourteen patients (36%) had the following post-HSCT sequelae: neurological disease in
seven [psychomotor delay (n=4), epilepsy (n=2), ataxia
and paraparesis (n=1)], growth hormone deficiency in
three, chronic GvHD in two (lung dysfunction, skin
eczema, abnormal skin pigmentation), busulfan-related
alopecia in one, and chronic lung disease with
bronchiectasis and severe humoral immunodeficiency
in one. 
Twelve of 21 patients with central nervous system
(CNS) involvement at diagnosis are alive after HSCT.
Their median Karnofsky score at latest follow-up is 100
(range, 80–100). The initial CNS involvement of 12
patients was as follows: clinical-radiological signs of
CNS disease in seven patients, pleocytosis in four
patients and both abnormalities in one patient.
Neurological complications after HSCT were observed
in six of these patients, five of whom had had previous
clinical-radiological signs of CNS disease and one
patient with pleocytosis. 
A patient with severe humoral immunodeficiency
who was given a transplant of CD34 positively-selected
cells from a mismatched family donor received 4 weekly doses of rituximab for Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disease (day +88).27 A severe humoral
immunodeficiency requiring monthly immunoglobulin
administration was diagnosed after 17 months, followed by bronchiectasis at +59 months. 
Discussion
HSCT, by replacing the patient’s immune system
with that of a healthy donor, is the only treatment
option with the potential to cure FHL, irrespective of
the genetic subtype. In Table 4, we summarize the main
results of HSCT surveys published in the last 15 years
(1995-2007) that data on more than ten HLH patients,15-
17,28-31 together with the results of our study. 
Our data, representing the second largest series
reported so far, show that more than half of patients
with HLH treated in nine AIEOP centers over almost 20
years have been cured by HSCT.
The overall survival rate of 58.6% observed in our
cohort is comparable to the 58% recently reported by
Ouchèe-Chardin et al., who analyzed their single center
experience over the last two decades.17 These patients
received induction remission treatment with etoposide
(31%) or steroids, cyclosporine A (15%) and anti-lymphocyte serum (54%). The differences between the two
series for some transplant outcomes, such as rate of primary failure, incidence of GvHD and incidence of TRM,
may be attributed to the more frequent use in the
French series of family haploidentical donors (60%) and
the consequent greater need for T-cell depletion of the
graft. 
Conversely, the slightly better overall survival rate of
64% reported by Horne et al. is probably related to
more homogeneous pre-HSCT treatment of all patients,
with more recent accrual.15
While in the past bone marrow and peripheral blood
were the almost exclusive sources of stem cells,32 transplantation of cord blood cells is now being increasingly
employed. Indeed, cord blood cells were used in 10% of
our patients. This percentage is in line with other
reports,15,30 and reflects the increasing access to cord
blood units for patients who lack an HLA-matched
bone marrow donor. Our results, indicating that the
stem cell source did not influence the outcome of
HSCT, find support in a previously published analysis
showing that the outcome of children with acute

leukemia who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation is similar to that of patients transplanted
with bone marrow from an HLA-matched unrelated
donor.33
We observed a trend, although not statistically significant, towards an improvement in survival and TRM
among patients who underwent HSCT from an unrelated or family-mismatched donor after 1998. For children
treated before that year, overall survival was 45.5%, a
value comparable to that published by Baker et al. for a
small series of 20 patients transplanted between 1988
and 1995.28 Yet, for patients transplanted from 1998
onward, the overall survival rate was 63.9%, which is
comparable to that reported by Horne et al. in 86
patients homogeneously treated according to the HLH94 protocol and transplanted between 1995 and 2000.15
The continuous improvement of transplant results over
the years may reflect both improved management of
HLH and better donor selection through the introduction of high-resolution molecular typing of both HLA
class I and II loci.34
We could not document the beneficial effect of complete control of HLH at the time of HSCT, reported by
Ouachèe-Chardin and Baker,
17,28 but not confirmed by
others.30,31 In view of the lack of evidence that disease
control has a favorable impact on post-transplantation
outcome, we suggest that the transplant option should
not be postponed in patients with FHL not benefiting
from complete control of the inflammatory syndrome.
Indeed, the choice of continuing chemo-immunotherapy in patients with delayed or suboptimal response
might be associated with an increased risk of both infectious complications (fatal or with high morbidity) and
fulminant neurological complications, thus preventing a
subsequent HSCT. 
TRM remains the major obstacle to the cure of FHL
by HSCT.15-17,28 In our series, moderate to severe nonhematologic toxicity affected mainly the liver, lungs and
kidneys, vaso-occlusive disease, sepsis and pneumonia
being the main causes of death. The frequent use of a
busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimen
may be responsible for a higher risk of severe vasoocclusive disease.35 Recently, Cooper et al. reported that
no case of vaso-occlusive disease occurred in eight
patients who received an unrelated donor graft using a
fludarabine/melphalan-based conditioning regimen, or
in three patients who received a haploidentical donor
graft using a conditioning regimen with fludaTable 4. Summary of the data regarding hematopoietic stem cell transplantation studies in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

rabine/melphalan and a reduced dose of busulfan (8
mg/kg over 2 days).16 The prophylactic use of defibrotide, a drug that has shown both a good safety profile and efficacy against vaso-occlusive disease, is still
under preliminary evaluation due to the limited data
available. 
Mild to severe mucositis often occurs in patients treated with a standard myeloablative regimen based on
busulfan (16-20 mg/kg), cyclophoshamide (120-200
mg/kg) and etoposide (50-60 mg/kg), and may necessitate elective intubation for airway protection.28,31 In
order to diminish early organ toxicity, conditioning regimens with reduced extra-hematologic toxicity have
been used without compromising engraftment.16,27,36,37 In
our cohort, a fludarabine-based conditioning regimen
was used in 18% of HSCT, but we were unable to document that this had any significant influence on overall
survival or TRM. Although promising, especially in
non-malignant diseases, the use of regimens with
reduced extramedullary toxicity requires further investigations in the future. 
CNS involvement occurs in 29% to 60% of patients
with HLH,15-17,38 with a progressive course if the disease
is not appropriately treated. Despite the potential neurotoxicity of some drugs employed for HSCT and
GvHD prevention/treatment, there is evidence that
HSCT may stabilize or even revert HLH-associated
CNS disease.17,31,39 In this series, none of the patients
who were free from CNS manifestations of HLH developed neurological sequelae after HSCT. Moreover, five
of 12 patients with CNS disease at diagnosis showed an
improvement or even reversal of neurological
signs/symptoms of disease, the median Karnofsky score
being 100.
In conclusion, we confirm that HSCT represents a
curative treatment for HLH patients irrespective of
remission status before HSCT. The major barrier to a
successful HSCT outcome is still TRM, and further
investigation needs to be done on this subject to reduce
or prevent extra-hematologic toxicity.
