Abstract
Aim Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC) is a challenging disease and requires aggressive surgical treatment in order to achieve
curation. The assessment and work-up of patients with presumed PHC is multidisciplinary, complex and requires extensive
experience. The aim of this paper is to review current aspects of diagnosis, preoperative work-up and extended resection in
patients with PHC from the perspective of our own institutional experience with this complex tumor.
Methods We provided a review of applied modalities in the diagnosis and work-up of PHC according to current literature. All
patients with presumed PHC in our center between 2000 and 2016 were identified and described. The types of resection, surgical
techniques and outcomes were analyzed.
Results and conclusion Upcoming diagnostic modalities such as Spyglass and combinations of serum biomarkers and molecular
markers have potential to decrease the rate of misdiagnosis of benign, inflammatory disease. Assessment of liver function with
hepatobiliary scintigraphy provides better information on the future remnant liver (FRL) than volume alone. The selective use of
staging laparoscopy is advisable to avoid futile laparotomies. In patients requiring extended resection, selective preoperative
biliary drainage is mandatory in cholangitis and when FRL is small (< 50%). Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is used
when FRL volume is less than 40% and optionally includes the left portal vein branches to segment 4. Associating liver partition
and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) as alternative to PVE is not recommended in PHC. N2 positive lymph
nodes preclude long-term survival. The benefit of unconditional en bloc resection of the portal vein bifurcation is uncertain.
Along these lines, an aggressive surgical approach encompassing extended liver resection including segment 1, regional lymphadenectomy and conditional portal venous resection translates into favorable long-term survival.

Introduction
Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies worldwide [1]. The tumors arise from
the epithelium of the biliary tract and may occur in the
whole biliary ductal system. They are sub-classified according to their location, in intrahepatic, perihilar and
distal cholangiocarcinoma [2]. Each entity comes with

a specific set of problems and therefore, management
requires a tailored approach.
Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC), also known as
Klatskin tumor, is the most frequent biliary tract tumor and
accounts for approximately 60% of all cholangiocarcinoma’s
[3]. This tumor originates in the extrahepatic biliary tract proximal to the origin of the cystic duct, up until the second-degree
bile ducts. PHC can be subdivided according to proximal extent of the tumor into the bile ducts (Bismuth-Corlette
classification) [4] (Fig. 1).
The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varies widely between regions. In Asian populations and Chili, parasitic infections are strongly associated with PHC, showing a peak incidence in Thailand of 87 per 100,000 [3, 5–7]. In Western
populations the incidence is considerably lower, 1–2 per
100,000, and PHC is mainly associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [8, 9].
Early symptoms are not specific and patients typically present with the sequelae of biliary obstruction. When jaundice
finally develops due to local biliary obstruction, patients are
often not resectable anymore, and thus not curable. Up to 65–
80% of patients have initially unresectable disease due to extensive hepatic artery and/or portal vein infiltration by tumor
or distant metastases at time of presentation [10–13]. Of all
patients who in time undergo a laparotomy, 40–70% ultimately have resectable disease [14–16]. Patients face many obstacles during diagnosis and work-up for extended resection.
These problems range from confirmation of malignancy to
cholestasis and cholangitis due to biliary obstruction, requiring biliary drainage.
Oncological outcomes depend heavily on the possibility of
performing a radical resection. Patients with unresectable disease, receiving palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and
cisplatin, have an overall median survival of approximately
12 months [17, 18]. In contrast, median survival of patients
with an R0 resection is 30–46 months and 5-year survival
rates range from 25 to 40% [19, 20]. The aggressive surgical
approach necessary to achieve an R0 resection however, is

associated with significant postoperative morbidity and mortality with reported morbidity rates ranging from 60 to 70%
[21] and mortality rates as high as 5–18% [19, 22–24]. It is
therefore crucial to optimize patients before exposing them to
this high-risk surgery.
The aim of this review is to elaborate current diagnosis and
work-up and to review the issues of extended resection in
patients presenting with a hilar lesion suspicious of PHC, from
the perspective of the long-standing experience with this complex tumor in our referral center.
The AMC experience; the denominator of patients
referred with (suspected) PHC
Between 2000 and 2016, a total of 606 patients with lesions
suspicious of PHC have been referred to our center. Patients
were discussed in our HPB oncology multidisciplinary meeting, consisting of experienced hepatobiliary surgeons, dedicated endoscopists, (interventional, abdominal and nuclear)
radiologists, radiotherapists, nurse practitioners, medical oncologists and pathologists.
A total of 285 (47.0%) patients were deemed
unresectable, of which 228 (37.6%) were found to be
unresectable at initial presentation on the basis of imaging studies. The remaining 57 patients were staged with
unresectable disease after diagnostic laparoscopy
(Fig. 2). The main reason for unresectability was locally
advanced disease (n = 104), N2 lymph node metastases
(n = 29), liver metastases (n = 27), peritoneal or distant
metastases (n = 68) or unfitness for major resection (n =
53) (Table 1).
The remaining 321 (53.0%) patients underwent laparotomy; 120 (19.8%) patients were deemed unresectable on the
basis of intraoperative findings. The main reasons were locally
advanced disease (n = 43), N2 lymph node metastases, (n =
39), liver metastases (n = 11), peritoneal or other distant metastases (n = 26) or major liver resection precluded by comorbidities (n = 1) (Table 1).
A total of 201 patients underwent extrahepatic bile duct
resection in the majority of cases combined with (extended)
liver resection. Of these patients, 66 (32.8%) underwent a left
hemihepatectomy, 8 (4.0%) underwent an extended left
hemihepatectomy, 31 (15.4%) patients underwent a right
hemihepatectomy, 51 (25.4%) underwent an extended right
hemihepatectomy, 8 (4.0%) patients underwent resection of
1 or 2 segments and the remainder of 37 (18.4%) patients
underwent bile duct resection alone (Table 2).
Based on pathological examination of the resection specimens, 170 (84.6%) patients had PHC and 31 (15.4%) had
benign disease (either unspecified sclerosing cholangitis or
IgG4-associated cholangitis) (Fig. 2).
Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher)
were observed in 93(46.3%) of resected patients. Of all patients who underwent resection, 18 (9.0%) died within the first
90 days.
The median survival after resection of confirmed malignancy was 52.6 months. The 5-year survival after resection was
44.3% (Fig. 3).

Pitfalls of diagnosis
Differentiation between malignant and benign disease
In patients with a presumed PHC, it is highly desirable to obtain
a definitive diagnosis (Fig. 4). Benign biliary tract strictures are
difficult to differentiate from malignant disease [25–27]. In recent years, IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC) has been identified as a disease entity that may mimic PHC, both clinically as
on imaging studies. It belongs to the spectrum of IgG4-related
disease, a systemic disease which can affect many other organs
as well [28–30]. Of all resections for presumed PHC worldwide,
8–22% of patients turned out to have a benign disease on microscopical examination of the resection specimen [26].
Endoscopic techniques Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combined with brushcytology for microscopical examination has been the standard
diagnostic modality for years [31–33]. PHC, however, frequently shows a submucosal growth pattern resulting in a
low sensitivity of brush cytology of 27–56% [31, 34, 35].
Various techniques have been investigated to increase sensitivity of cytological samples. These include fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) which is reported to increase sensitivity to 69–93% [36–38]. Mutation analysis has not been
used widely, but seems mainly to increase specificity [39].
The use of stiffer bristles or repeated brushings also has not
increased the diagnostic yield of brush cytology [40–42].
Other endoscopic techniques have emerged as well. The use
of endobiliary forceps biopsy during ERCP resulted in a
higher detection rate ranging from 44 to 89% [43, 44]. The
technique however is challenging, especially in more proximal lesions as it is difficult to navigate and position the forceps. Consequently, it has not found wide application [44–46].
Cholangioscopy offers direct visualization of biliary strictures and seems to improve the diagnostic yield of routine
cytology. Percutaneous cholangioscopy requires percutaneous
biliary access and multiple dilatations to allow access of the
cholangioscope. Single operator cholangioscopy (Spyglass,
Boston scientific, Natick, MA, US) is introduced through a
duodenoscope and is used in combination with Spybite
Biopsy Forceps [47, 48]. Using these techniques, the sensitivity in diagnosis of biliary strictures has increased to 74.7%
[49]. Cholangioscopy enables targeted biopsies increasing
sensitivity and specificity to detect PHC to 66 and 97%, respectively, in a meta-analysis. Single operator cholangioscopy
seems a useful new step in centers experienced with ERCP
and brush cytology.
Alternatively, intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) enables detailed imaging of the bile ducts and periductal tissue. IDUS

has been reported to improve diagnostic accuracy of ERCP
from 58% to 90% [33, 50]. However, stents that are often
required to drain obstructed bile ducts make the interpretation
of IDUS difficult. If this is the case, the use of endoscopic
ultrasonography (EUS) in combination with fine needle aspiration (FNA) may be preferable [50–52]. These techniques
however, require specific expertise to reach their maximum
potential and their success rates must be partially attributed to
the experience of their users.
Serum markers The limited ability to reliably acquire tissue
samples has resulted in an ongoing quest for serum biomarkers. The additional use of serum markers to distinguish
IAC from PHC has been an area of extensive research. Serum
IgG4 levels (ULN = 1.4 mg/ml) have limited diagnostic value
when only slightly increased, since up to 15% of patients with
PHC have elevated sIgG4 levels as well [53, 54]. Recently a
new test has been developed measuring the IgG4/IgG RNA
ratio. This test distinguishes IAC accurately (94% sensitivity,
99% specificity) from PHC and primary sclerosing cholangitis
[55]. The value of this test awaits further clinical assessment.
Biomarkers are also needed to monitor patients with an
increased risk of PHC such as in primary sclerosing
cholangitis [56]. The conventional serum markers CA19–9
and CEA are frequently used in gastrointestinal malignancies.
However, the diagnostic value of CA19–9 is debated because
of its variable sensitivity of 33–93% and specificity of 67–
98%. Its use as a prognostic biomarker seems more valuable
[57–60]. Furthermore, CA19–9 may be elevated in benign
biliary disease and/or in the presence of cholestasis, impairing
its use as a reliable biomarker especially in biliary tumors [61].
The same applies for CEA with a sensitivity of 33–84% and
specificity of 50–88% [58] in pancreato-biliary malignancies.
Staging and resectability
Criteria for the assessment of resectability

liver with adequate portal venous and hepatic arterial blood
supply. Factors to consider to determine resectability are included in Table 3 [62].
Unresectability can result from either extensive local disease
(including vascular and nodal involvement), presence of distant
metastases or comorbidity of the patient. Local unresectability
can be due to involvement of the portal vein and hepatic artery
on the side of the future remnant liver without the possibility of
a vascular reconstruction, extensive bilateral proximal infiltration of the tumor into secondary biliary radicles (segmental bile
ducts) and/or massive extension of tumor into the liver parenchyma. Furthermore, extrahepatic metastases including distant
lymph node metastases beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament
(N2 nodes) are associated with poor survival and in most centers, are considered as unresectable as well.
It should be emphasized that local resectability depends on
biliary anatomy at the liver hilum. The hepatic duct confluence
is defined by the convergence of the right and left hepatic ducts,
at which site many anatomic variations exist [63]. In 20% of
cases, the anterior and posterior sectorial branches of the right
ductal system drain directly into the main hepatic duct. This
may give rise to confusion as when a hilar tumor involving the
right anterior and posterior sectorial branches in these cases is
combined with segmental involvement on the left side, the
tumor is defined by the Bismuth-Corlette classification as type
IV, which in many textbooks is considered unresectable. A type
IV tumor in this situation however does not preclude a radical
resection using an extended left hepatectomy. The same holds
true for a tumor extending into the right sectorial ducts involving a low inserting segment 4 duct of the left biliary system.
Although defined as Bismuth-Corlette type IV, this tumor can
of course be radically resected using an extended right
hemihepatectomy. Resectability depends on hilar biliary anatomy and it is therefore important that resectability is assessed
by hepatobiliary surgeons with expertise in PHC [64].
Imaging
Imaging plays a decisive role in the diagnosis, staging and assessment of resectability. PHC manifests with various
morphological growth patterns that can be recognized on imaging to enhance the diagnostic confidence, determine management and to provide additional information on prognosis.
However, imaging can also lead to confusion due to overlapping
appearances with other hepatobiliary diseases, including benign
lesions. Important conditions to consider are other causes of
biliary dilatation such as choledocholithiasis, PSC, IAC and
biliary dilatation due to centrally located colorectal metastases
[65]. Ultrasound is usually the initial test to evaluate patients
with suspected bile duct obstruction [66, 67], and may provide
information on the level of obstruction in the biliary tree.
Cross-sectional studies CT and MRI are commonly used in
various combinations with cholangiographic studies, in the
diagnosis and preoperative planning of PHC. CT with iv contrast offers the opportunity to assess full extension of the tumor in detail and determine resectability [68, 69]. If PHC is
suspected, imaging is preferably performed before stenting for
biliary drainage, since the images will be obscured by the
plastic or metal stent. In general, PHC may be recognized by
dilated bile ducts, lack of communication between the left and
right first-order bile ducts, crowding of bile ducts, ductal wall
thickening and enhancement, and lobar atrophy. In some
cases, a solid (mass forming) or papillary mass (intraductal
growth type) may be seen.
The early arterial and late portal venous phases of a CTscan aid to assess the relationship between tumor and
(branches of) the hepatic artery and portal vein, which is important in determining resectability [70, 71]. Key elements for
staging in imaging are defined in Table 4. According to a

meta-analysis by Ruys et al., sensitivity and specificity of CT
were 89 and 92% for assessment of portal vein involvement
(encasement or occlusion are strong evidence), 84 and 93%
for hepatic artery involvement and 61 and 88% for lymph
node metastases, respectively [68].
MRI with iv contrast provides an acceptable alternative to
CT in the evaluation of PHC. Both CT and MRI have similar
staging accuracy, including that of nodal staging [72]. The
advantage of MRI is that combined with cholangiography
(MRC), it provides anatomical definition of the biliary tree.
Whether CT or MRI is used should be based on local expertise
and accessibility to one of these modalities [73].
[
18F]-FDG PET-CT has no additional value in the diagnosis
and staging of PHC. In the hilar area, it is difficult to distinguish tumor from concomitant inflammation. Furthermore,
for the identification of nodal involvement, [18F]-FDG PETCT has a sensitivity and specificity of 67 and 68%, respectively [74, 75]. Hence, it does not provide additional diagnostic
yield in comparison with CT.
Cholangiography MR cholangiography (MRC) combined
with MRI has comparable staging accuracy with that of CT
combined with direct cholangiography [72]. Alternatively, direct cholangiography using ERCP or percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) can also be used. PTC
may be more helpful in assessing the extent of proximal tumor
infiltration. ERCP can also be combined with cytological or
tissue sampling, albeit sensitivity and specificity are low (see
above). A major disadvantage of direct cholangiography is its
invasiveness, including the risk of inducing infection, pancreatitis, bleeding, inflammation and pain. Direct cholangiography for diagnostic purposes is therefore, only rarely performed. Especially ERCP entails retrograde contamination
of the obstructed bile ducts with increased risk of cholangitis.
Subsequent drainage of the visualized bile ducts using one or
more stents is therefore mandatory. ERCP and PTC are preferably used for therapeutic purposes to drain the obstructed
bile ducts in the palliative setting or preoperatively, to prepare
the patient for resection. In the latter situation, the aim is to
drain the biliary system of the future remnant liver while leaving the part to be resected alone.
Staging systems
There are many factors associated with resectability, prognosis
and prediction of long and short-term survival after resection
of PHC [15, 76–79]. The most commonly used staging systems include the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) staging system with incorporated TNM classification,
the Bismuth-Corlette system, the Blumgart T-staging system
(MSKCC classification) and a classification recently proposed
by the International Cholangiocarcinoma Group for the staging of PHC [14, 15, 20, 77, 79–81]. The AJCC staging system
is based on pathology assessment of the resection specimen
and is mainly used postoperatively as a prognostic tool. The
Bismuth-Corlette classification system, introduced in 1975, is
used to describe proximal involvement of tumor into the bile
ducts [4]. This system is mainly informative to surgeons for
planning of the type of resection, but does not determine resectability since other parameters such as distant metastases
and vascular involvement are not included. The Blumgart
classification system takes in addition to bile duct involvement, portal vein involvement and lobar atrophy into account
as well [82]. However, since its introduction in 1998, the indications for (extended) resections have expanded rendering
the Blumgart system now less applicable. The classification
system proposed by the International Cholangiocarcinoma
Group for the Staging of PHC takes into account most of the
variables used in the previous systems: suspicious lymph
nodes, extent of bile duct involvement, extent of vascular
involvement, suspected tumor size and lobar atrophy. As in
the other systems, the information is largely descriptive [83].
The staging systems used to date are mainly surgery oriented. Each has its merits, but all are limited to the anatomical
description of the tumor and are therefore limited in their ability
to predict the likelihood of an R0 resection. Furthermore staging systems have been criticized for having poor predictable
quality in different populations [20, 79, 84]. Ideally, a staging
system would preoperatively predict the likelihood of resectable disease along with as well, prognostic value.
Staging laparoscopy
For optimal determination of resectability, patients with potentially resectable PHC may undergo staging laparoscopy to
detect the presence of occult tumor manifestations. Staging
laparoscopy may detect small liver and/or peritoneal metastases that are undetectable on routine imaging avoiding a futile
laparotomy [84–86, 155]. A thorough inspection of the liver,
gallbladder, hepatoduodenal ligament and peritoneum is undertaken. The lesser sac is routinely opened and the common
hepatic artery is examined, lymph node station 8 (N2) is then
identified and biopsied for pathological evaluation. All other
suspicious lesions, based on intraoperative inspection or previous imaging, are biopsied for histopathological analysis.
Although not widely used, the combination with laparoscopic
ultrasound has been reported to increase the yield of the staging procedure to some extent. In a meta-analysis by Coelen
et al., which included 832 potentially resectable PHC patients,
a pooled sensitivity of 52.2% was found to detect
unresectability [14]. Based on our own experience in 273
patients undergoing staging laparoscopy for PHC, we developed a risk score that estimates the chance of unresectability.
This risk score includes the following factors: tumor size,
portal vein involvement, suspected lymph-node metastases
and suspected (extra) hepatic metastases. It showed good
Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307 295

discrimination between resectable and unresectable disease
(AUC 0.77, 0.68–0.86 95% CI) [16].
Assessment of future remnant liver
Liver volumetry
Since extended liver resections are often required, it is critical
to assess the FRL preoperatively where CT-volumetric analysis is the standard technique. The segments of the FRL are
delineated on the CT images and the ratio of the remnant liver
and the total liver, with subtraction of tumor volume is calculated. This delineation technique gives an indirect measurement of the liver function [87, 88].
It is assumed that a FRL-volume of > 25–30% is considered a safe cutoff for patients with healthy liver parenchyma,
whereas > 40% is used in patients with compromised liver,
like in patients with (post)cholestatic liver that is damaged
by longstanding biliary obstruction and possible cholangitis
[88–90]. In literature the acceptable minimum volume of FRL
in regard with parenchymal disease is variable and controversial (10–40%) [91–93]. In PHC, a FRL volume of more than
40% is usually considered. A disadvantage of FRL volumetry
is that individual patient characteristics are not taken into account and that the delineating technique is prone to error [94,
95]. Especially in patients with compromised liver, discrepancies have been reported between CT volumetry and postoperative outcomes [96] because the quality of the liver parenchyma is not taken into consideration [87, 97].
Liver functional tests
Because liver volume does not equal liver function and function is not homogeneously distributed in the liver [97], we rely
more on assessment of the function of the FRL, rather than on
volume alone. 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy
(HBS) is a validated quantitative dynamic liver function test
for which mebrofenin, an iminodiacetic (IDA) derivate, is
used as a tracer. This agent is mainly taken up by the hepatocytes and is subsequently excreted in the bile without undergoing any biotransformation. The hepatic uptake is mediated
by the same transport mechanisms as that of various endo- and
exogenous substances, making it an ideal agent to assess liver
function. HBS consists of an early dynamic phase, acquired
directly after intravenous injection of mebrofenin, during
which the mebrofenin uptake rate (MUR, %/min) is measured
[98]. This corresponds with the total liver function.
Immediately afterwards, a SPECT acquisition combined with
low-dose CT is made, falling in the period in which
mebrofenin is accumulated in the liver. The SPECT data provide information on three-dimensional, segmental distribution
of function. The low-dose CT is solely used for attenuation
correction and anatomical mapping [99].
The FRL is delineated on the SPECT images for calculation of the functional share (%). This is then multiplied by the
total liver function (MUR) to calculate function of specifically
the FRL. This method provides visual and quantitative information on regional liver function. Functional share of the FRL
is corrected for body surface area (BSA, m2
) using the
Mosteller formula, to individualize the results based on the
individual metabolic needs [100]. The current cutoff for a safe
resection is a FRL function of at least 2.7%/min/m2 [97].
HBS can be used in patients with normal or impaired quality of liver parenchyma alike using the same cutoff value.
MUR has been shown to correlate well with ICG clearance
[101]. A limitation of using HBS in patients with PHC is that
the uptake of bilirubin is competitive with mebrofenin as both
are taken up by the same hepatocyte transporters [102]. In
these patients, hepatocyte function is likely to be decreased
which will be reflected by HBS, with additional underestimation due to competition. These receptors are downregulated
during hyperbilirubinemia, but their expression gradually normalizes after drainage [103]. Considering this interaction,
HBS should not be performed in patients with high bilirubin
levels (> 30 μmol/L) and is usually postponed until adequate
biliary drainage has been achieved [104].
Preoperative preparation of the patient
Obstructive jaundice and biliary drainage
Patients with PHC usually present with obstructive jaundice.
This phenomenon has a negative effect on liver function, increases the risk of biliary infection and impairs cellular immunity [105]. Preoperative biliary drainage is used to create a
safer environment prior to liver surgery. It reduces jaundice,
improves liver function and the patient’s condition, at the
same time improving the ability of the liver to regenerate
postoperatively [85, 105–109]. The impact of these effects is
particularly high in patients with an insufficient FLR and preoperative drainage has shown to improve outcomes especially
in patients requiring extended resections [108]. On the other
hand, drainage-related complications may be severe and it is
therefore advisable to only drain patients with a substantially
increased bilirubin and small FLR [85, 110]. Drainage-related
complications such as cholangitis may severely deteriorate a
patient’s condition and increase the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality [50, 85, 105, 111]. Preoperative
cholangitis is caused by contamination of the biliary tract during drainage procedures. It is therefore advisable to give prophylactic antibiotics previous to any drainage procedure [3,
23, 107, 112]. Any episode of cholangitis induced after biliary
decompression should be treated with antibiotics and additional drainage or drain revision if necessary [21].
Refractory cholangitis is often caused by incomplete biliary
drainage and requires adequate endoscopic or percutaneous
296 Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307

stenting of residual, obstructed parts of the biliary tract.
Patients should not undergo surgery earlier than that they have
fully recovered from cholangitis [21].
The optimal drainage method is still a much-debated topic,
in which surgeons tend to favor the percutaneous approach for
reasons of direct access to the biliary duct and postoperative use
of the intraluminal drain(s) across the hepaticojejunostomy.
Although percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) seems associated with higher postoperative morbidity, further prospective studies are needed to better define the optimal mode of
biliary drainage in PHC [112, 113]. Furthermore, PTBD might
be complicated by portal vein thrombosis or seeding metastasis that may change resectability of the tumor [110, 114]. For
now, endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) is still the preferred
method in most Western countries.
Endo-nasobilairy drainage (ENBD) is the advocated method in many Asian countries. As in PTBD, it provides more
precise information on the extent of cancer along the bile ducts
[115]. Some authors reported less complications and a high
success rate of ENBD compared to EBD [116, 117]. However,
others reported comparable results with EBD and PTBD
[110]. Western centers generally do not perform ENBD because the nasal tubes easily dislocate and from the patients’
perspective, are usually less well tolerated. ENBD drains bile
externally via the naso-gastro-duodenal tubes, precluding bile
entering the intestinal system and therefore demands bile suppletion. This is then only possible via the oral route or a second gastroduodenal tube.
Several retrospective studies have been performed
concerning the optimal drainage method [118] mainly emphasizing that each method comes with its own set of complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis or vascular complications. Until evidence has been presented, EBD remains the
reference method in most Western countries [107, 109].
The balance between the benefits and risks of biliary drainage is fragile and drainage strategies should be optimized in
order to minimalize the risk of intrinsic complications. Due to
these risks, it may be advisable to undertake surgery without
prior drainage provided there is a surplus of remnant liver
volume. Wiggers et al. showed that with a FLR > 50% preoperative biliary drainage was of no added value [88].
Hence, in patients requiring extended resection, we now
use selective preoperative biliary drainage of only the future
remnant liver when FRL is small (< 50%) whereas complete
preoperative biliary drainage is mandatory in the event of
(recent) cholangitis.
Portal vein embolization
If the FRL has not sufficient volume or function to undergo a
safe resection, portal vein embolization (PVE) is the standard
intervention to increase the functional capacity of the FRL.
The local hemodynamic changes proposedly result in a release
of a range of interleukins and growth factors that induce hypertrophy of the non-embolized lobe. In our cohort of PHC
patients, the cutoff for proceeding with PVE is a FRL volume
of less than 40% and/or function less than 2.7%/min/m2
. In the
absence of cholangitis, the biliary system of the embolized
lobe needs not be drained, since unilateral cholestasis may
even have a synergistic effect on the hypertrophy response
of the non-embolized lobe. After a period of 3 weeks after
PVE, CT and HBS are repeated and reassessed. We have
shown that functional increase occurs more rapidly than volume, suggesting a shorter waiting time until resection can take
place [119].
In the series reported by the Nagoya group, PVE showed to
improve the surgical outcomes of PHC [10]. PVE is considered a safe procedure with an overall morbidity rate of 2.2%.
Most common complications are hematoma, hemobilia, septic
complications, backflow of embolization material and thrombosis in the FRL [120]. Olthof et al. analyzed the incidence of
postoperative liver failure in a combined series of two Western
centers specialized in PHC. A risk score was proposed to
select candidates for PVE based on FRL volume combined
with jaundice at presentation, preoperative cholangitis and
preoperative bilirubin level > 50 μmol/L [121].
Accelerated tumor growth due to PVE does not seem to
influence the survival of PHC patients [122, 123]. PVE however, does predetermine the side of the resection and in case of
new findings that may require a change of strategy, this cannot
be reversed. If the patient becomes unresectable due to disease
progression in the waiting time, the atrophy-hypertrophy reaction stabilizes with time and the overall liver volume and
function remain unchanged. However, the persistence of the
atrophied, usually contaminated cholestatic liver lobe can be
accompanied with adverse effects such as liver abscess, complicating further palliative treatment of the patient who typically will need repeated treatment with biliary stents [124].
Additional embolization of segment 4 in preparation of extended right hemihepatectomy is an option depending on the
target increase of FRL volume that needs to be attained. To this
end, the left portal vein branches to segment 4 are occluded
along with embolization of the right portal venous system. The
technique is challenging and requires an experienced interventional radiologist since access to the left portal venous system
can give additional risk of injury. Backflow of embolization
material into the left portal venous system can lead to inadvertent embolization and thrombosis of the portal veins supplying
the FRL. Alternatively, to decrease these risks, partial embolization of only segment 4a can be performed [120, 156].
Preoperative radiotherapy
There is no general consensus regarding the use of neoadjuvant therapy for PHC. Low-dose preoperative radiotherapy
(3 × 3.5 Gy in 3 days prior to resection) was instituted in our
Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307 297

center in patients with resectable PHC who received preoperative drainage to prevent seeding metastases. The increased
risk of seeding metastases after biliary drainage is an area of
debate [114, 125] with various outcomes reported in literature
[86, 126]. In our cohort, seeding metastasis in up to 20% of
patients after endoscopic stenting has been observed in the
laparotomy scar or drain tract [86] . This complication was
associated with tumor cells contained in the bile that inevitably contaminated the operative field after bile duct transection
in the course of resection. After using preoperative radiation,
no catheter tract recurrences after drainage have been reported
[125]. However, there is no evidence for this concept that is
uniquely applied in our center [127]. A recent study conducted
in two Western specialized centers, did not show an association of seeding metastases with center or mode of preoperative
drainage, i.e. endoscopic or percutaneous drainage [125].
New prospective studies are needed to develop guidelines on
this topic.
Surgical aspects
General considerations
The goal of surgical treatment is to achieve an R0 resection of
the tumor along with clearance of the regional lymph nodes.
Because of the central location of the tumor at the liver hilum
and its proximal extension into the segmental bile ducts, complete resection requires excision of the extrahepatic biliary duct
in combination with extended liver resection. The close relation
of the tumor with the right and left portal vein and the hepatic
artery branches often demands concomitant vascular resections
and reconstruction. The Japanese surgeons were the first to
show in the nineties of the previous century, that this aggressive
approach resulted in improved long-term survival [128]. Still
following these lines, radical resection entails excision of the
liver hilum with (extended) hemihepatectomy including segment IV and the caudate lobe, complete lymphadenectomy of
the hepatoduodenal ligament and excision of the portal vein
bifurcation when involved [129]. Additionally, arterial resections are undertaken in order to achieve an R0 resection (Fig. 5).
The type of resection depends on location of the tumor and
biliary anatomy at the hepatic duct confluence, the radial and
longitudinal extent of tumor into the intrahepatic bile ducts and
its association with adjacent periductal structures, portal vein
and hepatic arteries. When viewing cross-sectional imaging
studies, it is important to perceive the tumor in a threedimensional fashion. The tumor extends along the right and left
biliary ducts into the liver and at the same time, in anterior and
posterior direction into the ducts of segment 4 and segment 1,
respectively. Complete resection therefore should include the
central sector of the liver along the antero-posterior axis including the segments 1 and 4 [62]. As the central sector anatomically is part of the left hemi-liver, there is an advantage of a leftsided approach comprising an anatomical left
hemihepatectomy, whereas coming from the right, an extended
right hemihepatectomy is required to include the central sector.
Intraoperative frozen-section pathological examination of
the resection margins of the biliary ducts is performed to confirm radicality at the ductal level. In case of residual tumor in
the resection margin, the level of biliary resection is extended
although in our series, survival was worse in these patients
compared to patients who had an initial free margin [108].
Some surgeons routinely drain the biliary ducts of the remnant
liver after reconstruction using trans-anastomotic tubes. We
usually do not internally drain the hepaticojejunostomy but
when there are PTC drains in place, these are positioned
across the anastomoses allowing access for possible postoperative cholangiography. As recently reported, leaving the
drains open is not advised since the loss of bile negatively
influences postoperative regeneration of the liver remnant
[130].
Resection of the portal vein bifurcation: unconditional
or on demand
Controversy exists regarding the unconditional, simultaneous
en bloc resection of the portal vein bifurcation with the tumor.
The hilar vessels run adjacent to the tumor with less than
1 mm between tumor and portal vein while perineural infiltration of the tumor along the bile ducts is a common feature of
PHC. Because of this anatomical proximity, a no-touch technique was proposed by the Berlin group in which resection
includes unconditional excision of the portal vein bifurcation
en bloc with tumor excision and hepatectomy. Using this oncological strategy, dissection of the hepatic hilum is avoided
and the risk of dissemination of tumor cells minimized. This
technique however is less feasible in patients requiring left
hepatectomies due to the fact that the right hepatic artery usually crosses the hepatic hilum directly anterior or posterior of
the tumor, unless there is a displaced right hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery that runs along the
right-lateral margin of the hepatoduodenal ligament. Also, reconstruction of the right portal branches with the main stem is
technically more demanding.
Multivariate analysis of the Berlin series of resected PHC
showed that portal vein resection was the only significant
factor to influence patient survival after confirmed R0 resection. The 5-year survival rate of curative liver resection in their
series was 65% with portal vein resection as compared to 28%
without [131]. Other authors advise to only perform portal
vein resection when during exploration, the portal venous
bifurcation/contralateral portal venous branch is found to be
invaded by tumor.
In our center, we do not advocate the unconditional excision of the portal vein bifurcation, also because portal venous
reconstruction has been associated with an increased
298 Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307

postoperative morbidity rate [88]. Modern preoperative imaging techniques now accurately demonstrate portal venous involvement. Relying on this information, we only resect the
portal vein bifurcation en bloc with the tumor right away when
there is evidence of vascular involvement on CT-scan.
Otherwise, the decision to resect the portal vein bifurcation
is made intraoperatively. This policy has led to portal vein
resection in approximately 20% of our cases (Table 2).
Survival analysis of our series showed an overall 5-year survival of 44.3%, which is comparable with the 5-year survival
of 43% reported by the Berlin group in a series of patients that
underwent R0 resection using unconditional en bloc portal
vein resection [132].
Concomitant resection of the portal vein bifurcation with
extended hemihepatectomy is followed by end-to-end anastomosis of the left portal vein with the main portal venous stem.
Complete mobilization of the left portal vein by detaching all
side-branches to segments 4 and 1 facilitates reconstruction.
As the caliber of the left portal vein usually is much smaller, it
is important to bevel the anastomosis after oblique clamping
in order to prevent stenosis of the anastomosis. With
(extended) left hepatectomy, reconstruction of the right portal
branches with the main stem is technically more demanding.
Concomitant resection of the hepatic artery branch feeding
the remnant liver
Adequate arterial perfusion is crucial to function of the remnant liver. The left hepatic artery runs along the medial side of
the hepatoduodenal ligament and is therefore less at risk for
tumor involvement. The right hepatic artery with its right anterior and posterior branches however, is frequently infiltrated
by tumor. The choice of performing a right or left resection is
often dictated by the side of the liver in which the hepatic
artery branches are free. In PHC predominantly involving
the left liver, (extended) left hemihepatectomy with concomitant resection of the right hepatic artery is hampered by preserving a tumor free, intrahepatic distal stump for arterial reconstruction especially when tumor mass is substantial.
Microsurgical techniques are usually applied to create a safe
anastomosis with the right posterior branch of the right hepatic
artery in these cases. Combined arterial resection and reconstruction with portal vein resection is controversial. In the
Nagoya cohort of resected patients, this challenging technique
was associated with a mortality of 2% and a 5-year survival of
30% for patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma [133].
Preoperative embolization of the branch of the hepatic artery feeding the future remnant liver and subsequent excision
is not attractive in our view, because the biliary anastomosis
depends on arterial periductal arterial perfusion and loss of
arterial blood supply will lead to failure of the
hepaticojejunostomies. Arterialization of the portal vein can
be used as last resort when arterial perfusion of the remnant
liver is sacrificed, however is preferably applied for salvage of
the remnant liver [134].
Concomitant resection of segment 1
As pointed out above, the caudate lobe is part of the central
antero-posterior axis of the liver and is preferably resected
Fig. 5 Extended resection for
PHC should include the central
sector (segment 4) with segment 1
along the antero-posterior axis of
the liver. Depending on the
predominant side of the tumor, a
left (extended) or right extended
hemihepatectomy is chosen for en
bloc resection of the hilar area
Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307 299

en bloc with the tumor and liver hilum. Although the segment 1 bile ducts often drain into the left ductal system, they
may drain into any part of the hepatic duct confluence and
these ducts are frequently involved by tumor as well.
Routine S1 resection en bloc with (extended)
hemihepatectomy has therefore been implemented at our
institution since 1998 and has increased the rate of R0 resections and has resulted in improved survival [135]. En
bloc excision of segment 1 is therefore recommended with
resection of PHC.
Right or left (extended) hepatectomy
The decision to perform a right or left hepatectomy depends
on local tumor extension, portal venous and hepatic arterial
involvement and the FRL volume and function. For optimal
preoperative preparation of the patient, such as biliary drainage or the need for PVE, it is important to preoperatively
determine the side of the liver to be resected.
If the tumor extent and FRL volume allow both options, a
right-sided (extended) hepatectomy is often preferred because
it is more likely to achieve oncological radicality and is more a
straightforward procedure for several reasons [136]. Firstly,
because the biliary confluence is located on the right side of
the hepatoduodenal ligament, a right hepatectomy allows
more complete resection of the tumor. Also, the right hepatic
duct is often short (< 1 cm) or even absent in case of a triple
hepatic confluence, while the left hepatic duct has a relatively
long and straight course until reaching the border of the left
portal vein and branching off into the ducts of segments 2 and
3 [137]. Therefore, tumors that invade the right sectoral ducts
and even the segmental ducts to segment 4 (Bismuth-Corlette
type IIIa-IV) can be radically resected by extended right
hemihepatectomy. A disadvantage of a right-sided approach
is that segments 2 and 3 are small and that in many patients
preoperative right PVE is necessary before undertaking extended right hemihepatectomy.
Tumors predominantly involving the left ductal system
(Bismuth-Corlette type IIIb-IV) require a left-sided approach. The advantage of a left-sided resection is that the
remnant liver, i.e. the right liver segments, usually has more
volume and resection can be extended farther into the right
liver. Of note, the volume of segments 6 + 7 usually exceeds
that of segments 2 + 3 which may direct the choice of a right
or left-sided approach. A formal extended left
hemihepatectomy following the medial margin of the right
hepatic vein is technically more difficult and depending on
involvement of the segment 8 ducts, part of the anterior right
sector may be preserved (see below). A down-side of a left
resection is that construction of the (often multiple) biliary
anastomoses may be more complex with a higher risk of
biliary complications.
Parenchyma sparing liver resection
As volume and function of the remnant liver are the most
critical factors for postoperative outcomes, parenchyma preserving techniques can be applied in selected cases. These
techniques can be used as an alternative to PVE or in addition
to PVE, in order to spare as much functional liver tissue as
possible.
In right-sided tumors that require an extended right
hemihepatectomy, the cranial part of segment 4 (i.e. 4a) may
be preserved depending on the level of involvement of the
segment 4 bile duct. Free margin of the cut segment 4 bile duct
is checked using frozen-section pathological examination.
In case of a left-sided tumor, a modified extended left
hemihepatectomy may be undertaken. Extending left resection to include segment 5, the adjacent part of segment 8
may be preserved. Whether this can be performed depends
on the proximal extent of the tumor into the right segmental
ducts, and the anatomy of the right sectoral ducts (B5/8 and
B6/7) in relation to the right hepatic duct and hepatic duct
confluence.
A pitfall of sparing portions of the central sectoral segments
4 and 8 is cutting off their portal venous and arterial blood
supply by resection of the tumor. The central position of the
tumor often requires sacrifice of the middle hepatic artery to
segment 4 or the right-anterior portal vein and hepatic artery
branches to segment 8 leading to parenchymal infarction.
Another possibility for parenchymal preservation is
performing a central liver resection (mesohepatectomy) when
the bile ducts of segments 6 and 7 and the left lateral segments
2 and 3 are not infiltrated by the tumor. This complex procedure includes resection of the central sectors of the liver including segments 4, 5 and 8. In these cases, multiple jejunal
anastomoses with the remaining intrahepatic segmental bile
ducts are required [129]. A formal central resection is only
possible when the vascular structures supplying the left lateral
segments as well as the right-posterior segments 6 and 7 are
free of the tumor and can be preserved.
ALPPS
In situ split of the liver in combination with portal vein ligation
(ALPPS) has been introduced as a method to induce rapid
hypertrophy of the FRL. Because of the higher mortality and
morbidity reported in the initial series of ALPPS, this method
along with great interest has generated a heated discussion in
the surgical community [138, 139]. The advantage of ALPPS
is debated in extended right hemihepatectomy as compared to
complete embolization of the right portal venous system including segment 4 as described above. Several authors have
reported their results of ALPPS in patients with PHC. Due to
stenting of the biliary system and ensuing cholangitis, patients
were at increased risk of interstage morbidity and mortality
300 Langenbecks Arch Surg (2018) 403:289–307

[140, 141]. ALPPS for PHC demonstrated poor outcomes
with 48% perioperative mortality in the ALPPS registry
[140]. We therefore for now, do not recommend ALPPS for
resection of PHC and rather consider PVE with selective embolization of the left portal vein branches to segment 4 for
augmentation of FRL volume in patients requiring extended
right hemihepatectomy.
The extent of lymphadenectomy
Standard lymphadenectomy includes resection of lymph
nodes around the extrahepatic bile duct, the portal vein
and hepatic artery, as well as the lymphatic channels and
nerves contained in the hepatoduodenal ligament. The
number of lymph nodes resected is also relevant as less
than 4 lymph nodes evaluated in the specimen was identified as a poor prognostic factor for time to recurrence
[142]. Lymph node metastases that are limited to the hepatic pedicle or the hepatoduodenal ligament (N1) are
included in the field of resection, but those along the
common hepatic artery and/or celiac axis (N2) are considered distant metastases. N2-disease has a poor prognosis
and disease specific survival of patients with para-aortic
lymph node metastasis was similar to M1 patients, suggesting that survival is not influenced by the extent of
lymph node dissection, but rather by the presence of N2
disease [12, 78]. Therefore, we do not recommend routine
lymphadenectomy beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament.
Complications
Postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients with PHC is
significant. Reported mortality ranges from 5 to 18% even in
high volume centers, and morbidity as high as 60–70%, with
around 50% severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III or
higher) [21]. Table 5 shows the incidence of the most common
complications as reported in literature together with the complications recorded in our own series. Risks are particularly
high in patients with tumors requiring an extended resection.
Liver failure is a dreaded complication after extensive hepatectomy and is a major cause of mortality in patients with PHC
[21, 148]. The risk of postoperative liver failure is increased
due to the combination of intra-operative blood loss, a small
FLR and cholestasis [21, 88, 121]. Reported liver failure
ranges from 3 to 25% [31, 88, 143, 144]. Biliary leakage from
either the hepaticojejunal anastomosis or the parenchymal dissection surface ranges from 6 to 29% [31, 88, 143]. Infections
range from 23 to 66% and bleeding complications from 4 to
9% [15, 31, 88, 145, 146] (Table 5).
Discussion and future perspectives
The management of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is complex
and requires close multidisciplinary collaboration between
hepatobiliary surgeons, endoscopists, radiologists, medical
oncologists and pathologists. In this review, we provide a
summary of the current diagnosis and work-up in the light
of extended resection and elaborate on future perspectives.
Establishing the diagnosis of PHC is still one of the most
challenging aspects of the diagnostic work-up. New diagnostic endoscopic techniques such as SpyGlass and endoscopic
ultrasound enable more precise biopsies, resulting in increased
sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing biliary strictures [33].
These techniques will likely decrease the rate of misdiagnoses
and bring down the number of futile resections performed for
benign disease. The currently used conventional tumor marker
CA19–9 is not particularly sensitive or specific. A combination of different markers seems more useful in the diagnosis
and follow-up of PHC. Biomarkers such as CYFRA21-1 and
MUC-5 need to be evaluated in larger cohorts to assess its
clinical value. Molecular techniques such as circulating
miRNA’s and Tumor Educated Platelets (TEP) represent an
exciting area with great promise in this field [149, 150]. For
now, approximately 50% of patients with suspicion on PHC
undergo resection without a confirmed tissue diagnosis.
CT-volumetry has traditionally been the golden standard
for assessment of a sufficient FRL. However, not only the
quantity but also the quality of the FRL is important while
liver volume does not correlate with liver function. In our
cohort, total and regional (segmental) liver function was preoperatively evaluated using HBS. This quantitative method
allows measurement of FRL-function and can be used in patients with impaired quality of liver parenchyma using the
same cutoff value. A limitation of using HBS in patients with
PHC is that bilirubin induces competitive uptake with
mebrofenin as both are taken up by the same hepatocyte transporters. In patients with obstructive cholestasis, HBS may
underestimate liver function when the biliary system is not
completely drained.
The additional value of staging laparoscopy in the future is
questionable, considering the low yield and further

improvements in accuracy of preoperative imaging techniques. Using a risk score allows to predict unresectable
PHC at staging laparoscopy in order to make a more selective
approach to staging laparoscopy.
Since patients with PHC typically present with obstructive
jaundice, decompression of the biliary tract is a much-debated
topic. For the past, few years it has become clear that drainage
of the biliary tract comes with a serious risk of drainagerelated complications. Since obstructive jaundice impairs liver
regeneration, biliary drainage is still advised in case of a small
FLR. The optimal drainage method has yet to be established.
In The Netherlands the DRAINAGE trial is underway to evaluate outcomes of PTBD vs. EBD in resectable PHC [108,
151]. In this multi-center trial with an all-comers design, all
patients with a presumed PHC and cholestasis are randomized
to undergo PTBD or EBD. The study is powered for drainagerelated complications and postoperative outcomes. For now,
we use selective preoperative, endoscopic biliary drainage of
only the future remnant liver when FRL is small (< 50%)
unless mandated by cholangitis.
The most important prognostic factor for long-term survival of PHC is a margin negative resection of the hilar tumor. In
experienced hands, even Bismuth-Corlette type IV tumors can
be resected with curative intent. R0 resection requires an aggressive surgical approach encompassing hilar resection in
combination with extended liver resection, frequently accompanied with vascular reconstructions. These extended resections are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates
than experienced in liver resections without bile duct resection, probably because of the sequelae of obstructive jaundice.
Survival after resection is however favorable, with 5-year
overall survival rates comparable with survival after extended
liver resection for colorectal liver metastases.
PVE is a widely accepted interventional procedure to increase FRL volume and function before undertaking major
liver resection. This method of liver augmentation is especially of benefit in patients with PHC who require extended liver
resection in predamaged livers. We therefore advocate the
liberal use of PVE in patients with PHC in whom the FRL is
below 40% of total liver volume. It is important to note that to
obtain the maximum hypertrophy effect of segments 2 and 3,
the side-branches of the left portal vein to segment 4 can be
embolized as well. Obviously, selective embolization of the
segment 4 branches requires expertise of the interventional
radiologist as available in specialized centers. Although the
first successful case of ALPPS was reported by Schlitt in a
patient with PHC, the use of ALPPS in PHC as alternative to
PVE is not recommended because of the reported high morbidity and mortality of the procedure in this category of patients [152].
There are no established strategies regarding the use of
neo-adjuvant therapies in PHC. The only exception is neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy prior to liver transplantation
in a highly selected group of patients [153, 154]. The idea of a
short course of radiation preceding resection was to eradicate
free floating tumor cells in the bile, thus preventing viable
tumor cells of contaminating the peritoneal surface. There is
however no evidence for this concept.
The challenge in the coming years is to reduce morbidity
and mortality associated with extended resections for PHC.
Optimizing preoperative workup is key to achieve improved
outcomes after extended resections.
Conclusion
The field of work-up in PHC is changing with the introduction
of newer modalities that have emerged over the past few
years. Upcoming diagnostic modalities and molecular techniques might help to decrease the rate of misdiagnosis of benign, inflammatory disease. Assessment of liver function with
hepatobiliary scintigraphy provides better information on the
FRL than volume alone. The selective use of staging laparoscopy is advisable to avoid futile laparotomies. In patients requiring extended resection, selective preoperative biliary
drainage is mandatory in cholangitis and when FRL is small
(< 50%). Preoperative PVE is used when FRL volume is less
than 40% and optionally includes the left portal vein branches
to segment 4. ALPPS as alternative to PVE is not recommended in PHC. N2 positive lymph nodes preclude long-term survival. The benefit of unconditional en bloc resection of the
portal vein bifurcation is uncertain. Although still associated
with considerable morbidity and mortality, an aggressive surgical approach encompassing extended liver resection including segment 1, regional lymphadenectomy and conditional
portal venous resection offers the only chance for long-term
survival.
