Background. The seventh edition of the TNM classification separates extrahepatic bile duct tumors into perihilar
and distal tumors and further changes the definition of the
TNM classification. The impact of the seventh edition on
stage-based prognostic prediction for patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma was evaluated.
Methods. Between January 1998 and March 2010, 223
consecutive patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
underwent surgery at the West German Cancer Center.
Median survival times were calculated for the 195 evaluable patients (excluding those with in-hospital mortality)
after separate classification by both sixth and seventh
editions.
Results. Median overall survival was increased in patients
classified using the seventh compared with the sixth edition
(UICC I: 56.5 vs 23.75 months; II: 45.9 vs 31.6 months; III:
21.3 vs. 8.76 months; IV: 7.03 vs 5.93 months). The T
category of the seventh edition did not alter median survival
times of T1 (54.07 months) and T4 (7.83 months) cases, but
median survival was prolonged for T2 patients (29.4 vs
31.6 months), and shortened for T3 patients (19.43 vs
11.8 months) staged using the seventh edition. According
to Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, patient
survival was better predicted by the seventh edition UICC
stage and pT categories (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0396,
respectively), than the corresponding sixth edition categories (p = 0.4376 and p = 0.0926, respectively).
Conclusions. The UICC seventh edition TNM classification for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma improves separation
of patients with intermediate stage tumors compared with
the sixth edition. The prognostic value of the UICC staging
system has been strengthened by the introduction of the
seventh edition.
With only 2–4 new cases per 100,000 people per year,
the hilar cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon malignant
tumor, but is the fourth most common gastrointestinal
malignancy.1,2 Surgical treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma comprises extrahepatic bile duct resection, hepatic
resection, vascular resection, and lymph node dissection.
This strategy is associated with up to 19 % patient mortality and perioperative morbidity from 14 to 76 %.3 These
higher morbidity and mortality rates are observed as a
result of the necessity of more extensive hepatic resection
combined with resection of the extrahepatic bile duct.4,5
Recent studies report 5-year survival following complete
surgical resection of the perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
combined with major hepatic resections in the range of
25–40 %.3,6 In addition to resection, liver transplantation
may also offer a curative treatment option for selected
patients suffering from hilar cholangiocarcinoma.7–9 The
UICC TNM classification aims to reflect the outcome of
patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.3,10–12 The sixth

edition was published in 2002 and primarily relied on the
presence of lymph node metastasis and the extent of vascular invasion, the latter requiring vascular resection and
reconstruction in this tumor entity.13 The seventh edition,
published in 2009, further separates extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma into two groups by either perihilar
(proximal) or distal localization of the tumor.14 Interestingly, T3 stage of the sixth edition included tumors
infiltrating neighboring organs, such as the gall bladder,
pancreas, or the liver parenchyma. A tumor infiltrating the
duodenum was classified as T4. In contrast, perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma infiltrating neighboring organs such as
the duodenum, but not the hepatic parenchyma, is not
clearly defined by the seventh edition. Cases with regional
lymph node metastases have also been reclassified in the
seventh edition. In particular, tumors spreading into celiac
and superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which were staged
as N1 by the sixth edition, are classified as M1 by the
seventh UICC edition. These changes result in the reclassification of former UICC Stage IIB tumors (sixth edition)
as UICC stage IVB tumors (seventh edition) if lymph node
metastases were not regional.
A staging system that more exactly separates patients
suffering from hilar cholangiocarcinoma into prognostic
groups is desirable to support patient stratification for
treatment in light of future multimodal perioperative
therapeutic strategies. Clinical staging of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma prior to surgery is challenging since
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging frequently fails to define the full extent of the
tumor. Dual-modality PET/CT imaging has been shown
to detect metastases of hilar cholangiocarcinoma in
lymph nodes and other distant locations with high specificity.15 In addition, expression of biomarkers such as
vascular endothelial growth factor A and metallothionein
has been shown to correlate with survival of patients
suffering from extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.16,17 In a
recent report, patients homozygous for the C allele of the
GNB3 825C[T single nucleotide polymorphism exhibited a significantly prolonged survival compared with
patients heterozygous for this polymorphism or lacking
the C allele.18 However, the prognostic value of these
markers will have to be prospectively confirmed before
they can be applied to patient selection for adjuvant
therapy regimens.
Against this background, we compared the sixth and
seventh editions of the UICC TNM classification for
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in 223 patients consecutively
treated at our center over a 12-year period. The aim of this
study was to investigate whether classification of perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma according to the seventh TNM edition
provides better differentiation between tumor stages and
more accurately predicts patient survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Between January 1998 and March 2010, 247 patients
with the suspected diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma
were surgically treated at our center. Routine histopathological workup was conducted for all resected tumors by the
Department of Pathology and Neuropathology of the University Hospital Essen. Benign conditions in accordance
with a Klatskin-mimicking lesion were diagnosed in 24
patients.19 Cholangiocellular adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 223 patients, including 128 male (57 %) and 95
female (43 %) patients, with a mean age of 61 (±11) years.
All types of resection margins (R0, R1, and R2) and all
cases of irresectable disease were included in the study
cohort. Patients with postoperative in-hospital mortality
(28 patients) were excluded from further evaluation to
focus on malignancy-related outcome. Thus, a total of 195
patients were available for evaluation.
Histopathological Processing
Surgical specimens were stored in 4 % neutral-buffered
formalin (12–24 h) prior to histopathological processing,
then dehydrated and cleared using an automated standard
procedure (Shandon Pathcentre, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., USA) before paraffin embedding in Paraplast
(McCormick Scientific, USA). From each paraffin block,
3–5 lm sections were prepared (Leica SM2000R, Leica
Microsystems, Germany) and mounted on glass slides.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Merck, Germany; Chroma/
Waldeck, Germany) staining was performed following
standard diagnostic procedures (Shandon Varistain Gemini,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). Histopathology
reports were available for every case and included macroscopic and microscopic tumor evaluations, a continuous
text summary, and the TNM classification. Data including
operative reports and surgical pathology reports of all
patients were entered prospectively into a computer database. Cases were stratified according to the UICC staging
system and TNM classifications based on the ‘‘Extrahepatic
Bile Duct’’ chapter in the sixth edition and the new
‘‘perihilar cholangiocarcinoma’’ chapter in the seventh
edition.13,14
Data Analysis
Changes in the distribution of TNM classifications and
UICC stages were compared between the sixth and seventh
editions, and median survival and survival ranges were
calculated independently for each classification. Additionally, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were calculated.
278 B. Juntermanns et al.

Survival was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method
and the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression
analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of
the TNM categories and UICC stages derived from the
sixth and seventh editions. Differences of p\0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed using JMP statistical software, version
8.0.2 (SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
A total of 195 patients suffering from perihilar cholangiocarcinoma were surgically treated at our center between
January 1998 and March 2010. In this retrospective study,
we compared the impact of applying either the sixth or
seventh editions of UICC tumor staging to stratify median
patient survival or predict prognosis in this patient cohort.
Cases of postoperative in-hospital mortality were excluded
from the analysis. A summary of differences between the
sixth and seventh editions of UICC staging of extrahepatic
bile duct tumors and the respective TNM categories is
presented in Tables 1 and 2.
13,14 We compared the influence
of tumor staging using either the sixth or seventh UICC
editions on the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of patients in this
cohort (Table 3). The median overall survival for patients
staged according to the sixth or seventh editions and broken
down by tumor stage were: stage I (23.75 or 56.5 months),
stage II (31.6 or 45.9 months), stage III (8.76 or
21.3 months), and stage IV (5.93 or 7.03 months), respectively. Staging according to the seventh edition resulted in
an increased median overall survival for patients suffering
from perihilar cholangiocarcinoma throughout all tumor
stages, and a change in staging occurred in 92 patients.

Comparison of the Sixth and the Seventh Editions of the UICC Classification 279

We also compared the ability of the sixth and seventh
editions of the UICC classification to accurately predict
patient prognosis based on tumor stage. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis for patients with different tumor stages
revealed that the seventh edition more accurately stratifies
this patient cohort according to stage (Fig. 1). This is particularly evident for patients with stage II and III tumors. The
prognostic value of the seventh edition tumor staging was
confirmed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis,
which was significant for the seventh edition (p = 0.0396),
but did not reach the significance cutoff for the sixth edition
(p = 0.0926, Table 3). Analysis of our patient cohort shows
that the seventh edition improves accuracy of tumor stage
classification for prognostic prediction.
The extent of tumor infiltration as reflected by the T category has been defined more specifically by the seventh
edition. We compared median survival of patients based on
either the sixth or seventh edition T category classification
(Table 4). The seventh edition definition of the T category
had no impact on median survival of patients with tumors
classified as T1 (54.07 months) or T4 (7.8 months). However, the seventh edition definition of the T category resulted
in slightly increased median survival in the T2 category (29.4
vs 31.6 months), but in reduced median survival in patients
allocated to the T3 category (19.4 vs 11.8 months). The
prognostic value of the seventh edition T category staging
was confirmed by Cox proportional hazards regression
analysis (p = 0.0014, Table 4). This analysis also showed
that the sixth edition T category staging did not significantly
influence prognosis (p = 0.4376). The more exact definition
of tumor infiltration by the seventh edition T category clearly
improved patient stratification particularly for intermediate
tumor stages.
Lymph nodes positive for cancer cells can either be
defined as regional spreading of the tumor or as metastases.
The definition of regional lymph nodes has been restricted
within the N and M categories of the seventh edition of the
UICC classification. The overall impact of a positive lymph
node on the extent of the disease is also reflected by the
seventh edition, such that involvement of any lymph node
results in tumor stage III. Applying the seventh edition
resulted in reclassification of four patients as M1 based on
positive lymph node histopathology (Table 5). Median
survival for patients classified for the N category using the
sixth and seventh edition was also compared (Table 4).
Median survival of patients classified N0 (22.4 months)
and N1 (11.067 vs 11.567 months) largely remained
unchanged. Using the sixth or seventh edition descriptions
of the M category also did not affect median survival of
patients either staged M0 or M1 (23.6 and 5.93 months,
respectively). As expected by the minimal differences in
median overall survival, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed no differences in the prognostic value
for N and M categories between the sixth and seventh
edition (Table 4).
The group of extrahepatic bile duct tumors as described
in the sixth edition of the UICC classification has been
separated into ‘‘perihilar’’ and ‘‘distal’’ bile duct tumors by
the seventh edition.13,14 In our cohort, 21 of 195 patients
were inflicted with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma that
directly infiltrated adjacent organs. Of these patients, 12
had tumor infiltration into the gallbladder, pancreas, or
duodenum with additional vascular infiltration and were
thus classified as either T3 or T4 by the sixth edition. The
tumors from nine patients showed no vascular infiltration,
but infiltrated either into the gall bladder or pancreas and
were classified as T3 or the duodenum and were classified
as T4 using the sixth edition.13 The seventh edition of the
TNM classification makes no provisions for classifying
tumors infiltrating adjacent organs without vascular

infiltration, which accounted for 4.6 % of cases in our
patient cohort. The section editor for the upper gastrointestinal tract at the UICC advised us to apply the seventh
edition TNM classification schema for distal extrahepatic
bile duct tumors for this group, which classifies all of these
patients as T3 and T4 (adjacent organs), respectively.14
Withdrawal of these patients from our analysis did not
considerably alter median survival (data not shown).
Nevertheless, the presence of a small fraction of patients
with tumors infiltrating adjacent organs but not the vasculature warrants the inclusion of this group in future
editions of the TNM classification for proximal extrahepatic bile duct tumors.
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective, single-institution study, we show
that the seventh edition of the UICC TNM classification for
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma more accurately represents
the severity of the disease. Particularly, the more detailed
guidelines for defining the tumor extension, the higher
impact attributed to lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor cells,
and the separation of perihilar from distal bile duct tumors
have improved the separation of clinical course and prognostic prediction based on tumor stage alone. The seventh
edition constricts the definition of regional lymph node
involvement in the N and M classifications and puts more
weight on the presence of any lymph node infiltrated with
cancer cells in tumor staging. This resulted in the reclassification of cases with lymph node metastases as UICC
stage III by the seventh edition (formerly stage II in the
sixth edition). In addition, stage IV has been subdivided
into local invasion (IVA) and distant disease (IVB).
Applying the seventh edition of the UICC staging system,

we observed considerable stage migration within our
patient cohort. For example, because of the exclusion of
tumors infiltrating beyond the ductal wall (T2), only six
patients of the 26 patients who were classified as stage I by
the sixth edition were classified as such according to the
seventh UICC edition. The 88 cases classified as stage II
tumors according to the sixth edition was reduced to 52
cases using the seventh edition, since nodal positive (N1)
tumors were excluded from stage II. In consequence, the
number of cases classified as stage III according to the
seventh edition increased to 51 patients (compared with 22
using the sixth edition), even though patients with T4
tumors were removed from this group by the seventh edition. Patients with T4 tumors are included in stage IV by
the seventh edition, thus increasing the number of stage IV
patients in our cohort from 59 (sixth edition) to 83. The
four patients categorized as stage III according to the sixth
edition of the TNM classification due to celiac or mesenteric lymph node infiltration (N1) were upstaged to
metastatic (M1, stage IV) disease according to the seventh
edition (Table 5). This stage migration based on the seventh edition of the TNM classification resulted in a better
separation of the clinical course, as reflected by the higher
median survival of stage I patients (56.5 vs 23.75 months)
and the lower median survival of stage II and III patients
(31.6 vs 45.9 and 8.7 vs 21.3 months, respectively) in our
cohort.
The seventh edition of the UICC TNM classification for
extrahepatic bile duct tumors, for the first time separates
this group into ‘‘perihilar’’ and ‘‘distal’’ bile duct tumors.
Tumors confined to the bile duct remain classified as T1 in
the seventh edition, but margins for tumors infiltrating
adjacent tissues have been more specifically defined. T2
now includes a new subcategory for tumors invading the
adjacent hepatic parenchyma (T2b). T3 tumors have unilateral vascular invasion, and T4 is defined on the basis of
bilateral biliary and/or vascular invasion, as it has been by
the sixth edition. In our cohort, survival of patients categorized as T1 or T4 according to the seventh edition was
unchanged from that using the sixth edition. Patient survival in our cohort was slightly increased for T2 (29.4 vs
31.6 months) cases and decreased for T3 (19.4 vs
11.8 months) cases using the seventh edition. T3 previously included tumors with continuous infiltration into
neighboring organs or tissues, such as the gallbladder,
pancreas, or liver parenchyma. The seventh edition classifies a tumor with continuous infiltration of the adjacent
liver parenchyma as T2b. However, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma infiltrating neighboring organs can no longer be
classified using the seventh TNM classification. Our cohort
included 21 such patients, with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma microscopically infiltrating adjacent organs as a
continuation of the primary tumor. Communicating our
observation with the UICC we were advised to apply the
seventh edition parameters for staging of distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma to these cases.14 In doing so,
adjacent invasion of the liver parenchyma was classified as
T2b and unilateral vascular involvement as T3. Infiltration
of the liver parenchyma alone, without accompanying
vascular infiltration, has been associated with a better
prognosis than when vascular invasion was additionally
present.20 Therefore, the ‘‘downgraded’’ classification of
these tumors as T2b by the seventh edition appears justified. Because of their significant representation in our large
patient cohort, we propose to include an adjacent tumor
infiltration classification also for perihilar as well as distal
cholangiocarcinoma in future amendments to the TNM
classification.
In conclusion, based on this retrospective study of 195
evaluable patients treated for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
at a single institution, the categorization of tumor stages by
the seventh edition of the TNM classification improves on
that by the sixth edition. The seventh edition subdivides
malignant extrahepatic bile duct tumors in perihilar and
distal groups and attributes tumor infiltration of lymph
nodes more impact on the extent and, thus, severity of the
disease. The seventh edition better separates intermediate
stage tumors as reflected by the median patient survival for
this cohort and confers a higher prognostic value to the
tumor stage. This should facilitate stratification of patients
diagnosed with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma into different
risk groups that might benefit from multimodal perioperative treatment strategies. Our analyses show that
particularly the staging and T categories of the seventh
edition result in better prediction of patient survival than
the corresponding categories from the sixth edition. Based
on the considerable number of patients in our cohort whose
disease was differently staged by the sixth or the seventh
editions of TNM classification, previous studies using the
sixth edition for staging should reconsider the changes of
the seventh edition prior to comparison with new data
emerging from treatment of patients with perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma.
