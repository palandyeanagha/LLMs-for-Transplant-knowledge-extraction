INTRODUCTION 
The liver receives a blood supply both from the portal vein and 
the hepatic artery. Portal venous blood, which is derived from the 
mesenteric veins, constitutes approximately 75% of total blood 
flow to the liver.1
 Because large amount of microbes colonize in 
the gut, blood from the intestine contains not only products of 
digestion but also microbial products. Therefore, the liver, the initial site of filtration of gut-derived products, is susceptible to the 
exposure to the microbial products from the gut, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS).1
In normal condition, translocation of the microbial products 
from the gut to extraintestinal space, including systemic circulation, is effectively prevented by our defense mechanisms: the barrier function of the gut and cleansing and detoxifying function of 
the liver.2
 However, disruption of these defense mechanisms can 
lead bacterial translocation to extraintestinal space and aberrant 
activation of immune system, which can trigger harmful or chronic 
inflammations in the liver.3
The importance of bacterial translocation in the pathogenesis of 
alcoholic liver disease has been shown in various previous studies: 
impairment of the function of intestinal tight junction4-7 and bacterial proliferation8,9 by alcohol and/or its metabolites, such as acetaldehyde, enhance bacterial translocation into the liver, which induce activation of immune cells, including Kupffer cells, to release 
various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 1).10,11
Furthermore, various studies suggested that bacterial translocation also plays an important role in the development and progression of other types of liver diseases.12-16 Endotoxemia is frequently 
found in patients with cirrhosis, and the degree of endotoxemia

Because of the anatomical position and its unique vascular system, the liver is susceptible to the exposure to the 
microbial products from the gut. Although large amount of microbes colonize in the gut, translocation of the microbes 
or microbial products into the liver and systemic circulation is prevented by gut epithelial barrier function and cleansing 
and detoxifying functions of the liver in healthy subjects. However, when the intestinal barrier function is disrupted, large 
amount of bacterial products can enter into the liver and systemic circulation and induce inflammation through their 
receptors. Nowadays, there have been various reports suggesting the role of gut flora and bacterial translocation in the 
pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. This review summarizes the current knowledge about 
bacterial translocation and its contribution to the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases and portal hypertension. (Clin

is correlated with the degree of liver failure.17,18 In this review, we 
highlight the current knowledge about bacterial translocation and 
its contribution to the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases and 
portal hypertension.
DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN THE BODY
LPS, glycolipids derived from the outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria, is a potent activator of immune responses: very 
tiny amount of LPS can induce the manifestations of septic shock 
in human.19,20 Fortunately, the mammals have effective defensive 
mechanisms to prevent this harmful effect of LPS. In healthy animals, LPS is cleared from the circulation within a few minutes after 
intravenous injection.21,22 Peripheral blood endotoxin concentration is significantly lower than portal venous endotoxin concentration, even in patients with liver cirrhosis.23
These defensive mechanisms mainly depend on the barrier 
functions of the gut and the detoxifying capacity of the liver.24 The 
gut epithelium acts as a first-line barrier to the gut microbes and 
prevents exposure of the gut microbes to the host immune system. 
The epithelial cells maintain barrier integrity by microvilli, tight 
junctions, and production of antimicrobial peptides.25-27 These barrier systems of intestinal epithelial cells prevent translocation of 
most of microbial products of gut and only tiny amount of microbial products can reach the liver in healthy condition.28
The liver plays a central role for prevention of translocation 
of gut-derived microbial products to the systemic circulation by 
cleansing and detoxifying microbial products.29 Microbial products 
in the portal venous blood eventually reach to the sinusoids in the 
liver, which contain diverse immunologically active cells, including the Kupffer cells, liver dendritic cells, T cells, natural killer T 
cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.28 Not only these immune cells, 
but also liver nonparenchymal cells such as hepatic stellate cells 
and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, express the LPS receptor and 
remove this molecule to protect the systemic circulation from the 
endotoxemia.30 A previous animal study demonstrated that about 
40-50% of intravenously administered LPS was quickly removed 
by the liver, suggesting the role of the hepatic uptake and detoxification in the immune homeostasis.31,32 Beside the LPS uptake, 
several other mechanisms also play a role in preventing significant immune response to LPS, including LPS-binding molecules, 
enzymes which degrade the lipid A moiety of LPS to decrease its 
activity, and LPS neutralization by serum lipoproteins.33-36 Furthermore, the liver usually tolerates bacterial products to avoid harmful responses.28 The hepatic immune system, including Kupffer 
cells, NK cells, NKT cells, T cells, and B cells, strictly regulate the 
liver immune system including liver tolerance.3
Figure. 1. Schematic presentation of the gut-liver axis and bacterial translocation. In normal condition, bacterial 
translocation from the gut to the liver is effectively prevented by gut barrier function. Furthermore, although 
small amount of bacteria or its products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can enter into the liver, they are 
rapidly removed by cleansing and detoxifying function of the liver. Therefore, activation of the immune cells and 
subsequent induction of inflammation is effectively prevented. However, in the pathologic condition, bacterial 
translocation is increased by impaired barrier function, bacterial overgrowth, and compositional change of gut 
flora (the increase of pathologic bacteria). Therefore, large amount of LPS can enter into the liver and induce 
immune cell activation and inflammation. In liver immune cells, particularly in the Kupffer cells, LPS induces 
proinflammatory pathway via TLR4 to produce proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferons.

DISRUPTION OF GUT BARRIER FUNCTION AND 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION
It is well known that bacterial translocation is closely associated 
with the development of complications of liver cirrhosis, such as 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the hyperdynamic circulatory 
state, and hepatic encephalopathy.37-39 Bacterial translocation is 
defined as the migration of bacteria or bacterial products from the 
gut to the extraintestinal space.40 Increased intestinal permeability 
induced by disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier function 
contributes to the development of bacterial translocation.3,28,41 In 
addition, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and changes in the composition of bacterial flora in the gut can promote bacterial translocation.39,40,42
Increased gut permeability
The gut epithelium plays an important role in the immune 
homeostasis in the gut by acting as the first barrier against the 
bacterial translocation of gut microbiota.43-44 Because gut barrier 
system by intestinal epithelial cells prevent translocation of large 
amounts of bacteria and bacterial products from the gut, only 
very small amount of them can reach the liver in a healthy state.28
However, this effective gut barrier function can be disrupted by 
various pathological conditions and this disruption leads to bacterial translocation.3,28,41 For example, alcohol can play a role in the 
pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease by disrupting the gut barrier function: alcohol itself as well as its metabolite, acetaldehyde, 
inhibit tight junction protein expression;44,45 alcohol can impair 
microtubule cytoskeleton in intestinal epithelial cells by inducing 
nitric oxide;46 and transepithelial electrical resistance is reduced 
in alcohol-exposed colon epithelial cells, which leads to impaired 
barrier function.24 In addition, liver-derived inflammatory cytokines 
can further increase gut permeability by disruption of gut epithelial tight junctions.47
Bacterial overgrowth
Bile acid secretion is decreased in patients with liver cirrhosis and this could lead bacterial overgrowth and compositional 
change in the intestine in these patients.48,49 In addition, the fact 
that liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension could impair intestinal 
motility may also contribute to the development of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.50 Previous study suggested that gastrointestinal 
transit is delayed in patients with liver cirrhosis and this delay 
could be improved with antibiotic therapy.51 Several studies suggested that the duration of the migrating motor complex are prolonged and the frequency of clustered contractions are increased 
in patients with liver cirrhosis, and these small intestinal motility 
disturbances are related with the severity of liver failure in these 
patients.52,53
Changes in the composition of gut flora
The composition of the intestinal bacteria is influenced by the 
environment, diet, and host factors.25,54,55 It could be changed 
by certain diseases, including liver cirrhosis. In liver cirrhosis, the 
normal intestinal microbial community is disrupted due to the 
decrease in gastric acidity, intestinal motility, and biliary secretions.56,57 Actually, a previous analysis of fecal microbiome in 
patients with cirrhosis suggested that fecal microbial communities are significantly different when compared to those in healthy 
individuals: increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria, such as 
Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae, and decreased beneficial Bifidobacteria and Lachnospiraceae were noted in patients 
with liver cirrhosis.58,59 A previous animal study also reported 
the increased aerobic/anaerobic bacterial ratio in mice with liver 
fibrosis.60 In addition, liver cirrhosis induced by CCl4 in rats was 
also associated with high levels of Enterobacteriaceae.
61 They also 
suggested that treatment with antibiotics or probiotics lead decrease in Enterobacter as well as increase in Bifidobacterium and 
Lactobacillus, which in turn lead to decreased systemic endotoxin 
levels and improve in the liver function.61 Similarly, treatment with 
probiotics or antibiotics in patients with liver cirrhosis reduced the 
prevalence of bacterial infection and hepatic enephalopathy62-64
and partially reversed the hyperdynamic circulatory state in these 
patients.65 A very recent study suggested that modulation of the 
intestinal microbiota is a critical determinant of nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) as well as multiple other aspects of metabolic syndrome.66
LPS RECEPTORS AND DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN THE LIVER
In normal condition, only very small amount of bacteria or bacterial products, such as LPS, can enter the liver by the action of gut 
barrier function, where they are sensed and cleared by immune 
cells, particularly by Kupffer cells. However, in the pathologic

condition with disrupted gut barrier function, the entry of bacteria 
and bacterial products to the liver is increased and homeostasis 
of the gut-liver axis is impaired, which eventually induce activation of liver immune cells, particularly Kupffer cells, to produce 
pro-inflammatory mediators.67-69 Previous studies suggested that 
bacterial translocation and resultant Kupffer cell activation are the 
main mechanisms of the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.70
This suggestion is supported by the finding in animal models that 
alcoholic liver disease could be attenuated by gut sterilization with 
antibiotics or Kupffer cell elimination.71-73 Translocated bacterial 
products activate the hepatic immune cells through pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like 
receptors (NLRs). Recent studies suggested that TLR4 in hepatic 
stellate cells (HSCs) also responds to LPS to activate Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) kinase and NFκB.74 Oxidative stress induced by 
alcohol and its metabolites is also involved in the induction of liver 
fibrosis by sensitizing HSC to LPS.75,76
Toll-like receptors
TLRs, a family of pattern-recognition receptors, are transmembrane proteins originally identified in mammals on the basis 
of their homology with Toll, a Drosophila receptor that contributes 
to development in the embryo, and the production of antimicrobial peptides against microorganism invasion in the adult fly.77,78
TLRs recognize pathogen-derived molecules−i.e., structural 
components unique to bacteria, fungi, and virus−and activate 
inflammatory responses including cytokine and type I interferon 
(IFN) production in response to this recognition.79 Previous studies suggested that hepatic non-immune cells, including HSCs and 
endothelial cells, respond to bacterial products through TLRs.3,28
Until now, ten TLRs have been identified in humans,80 while TLR4 
was the first identified isoform that responds primarily to LPS.79
TLR4 plays a pivotal role in the activation of innate immune responses to LPS.81,82 TLR4 cannot directly bind to LPS and therefore, 
co-receptors, CD14 or MD-2, are needed for LPS binding to TLR4 
and TLR4 activation.83-85 Two pathways for downstream signaling of TLR4 activation are demonstrated: MyD88-dependent and 
MyD88-independent pathways.86 In the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, association of the intracellular TLR domain of TLR4 
with the adapter molecule MyD86 through TRAM, which results 
in downstream activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1)/4/tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 
6 (TRAF6) complex and further activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) 
kinase complex that phosphorylates IκB to allow nuclear translocation of NF-κB.87 NF-κB binding to the NF-κB responsive element in the promoter region of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes 
results in the production of TNFα, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.88 MAP kinases including c-JNK and p38 
activate transcription factor AP-1. Activation of these transcription 
factors induces transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, such 
as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β.
89 Except for TLR3, all TLRs activate the 
MyD88-dependent pathway. In the MyD88-independent signaling pathway, recruitment of the adaptor TIR domain-containing 
adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), TRAF6, to TLR4 and TANK-binding 
kinase (TBK)/IKKε phosphorylation induce phosphorylation of 
the interleukin regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which in turn leads to 
IRF3 nuclear translocation and induction of type-I IFNs.88,90 Both 
MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways are activated after LPS-TLR4 interaction, while only one of these pathways are activated in other TLRs.
The importance of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease is evidenced by the previous animal 
study showing that decreased steatosis and inflammation and 
significantly reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum TNF-α and IL-6, in the TLR4-deficient mice after chronic 
alcohol feeding.91 In addition, a previous study suggested that 
chronic alcohol exposure not only results in immune cell activation, 
but also sensitizes cells to LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signals 
by reduction in the expression of IRAK-M, a negative regulator of 
TLR4 activation.67 A critical role of LPS and TLR4 is suggested also 
in the pathogenesis of NAFLD: lipid accumulation, inflammation 
and fibrosis were significantly attenuated in TLR4 knockout mice 
after methionine choline-deficient diet.14,92
Recent studies suggested that TLR4 signaling can be activated 
not only by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), but 
also by some endogenous ligands, damage-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMPs), from cellular compartments which are released 
from damaged cells or tissues.79 DAMPs-induced TLR4 activation 
also can induce inflammation, which is called sterile inflammation 
because this inflammation is caused without infections.93 Therefore, DAMPs as well as PAMPs play a role in the pathogenesis and 
progression of liver diseases through activation of TLR signaling.3
NOD-like receptors and inflammasomes
NLRs is the members of the pattern recognition receptor family 
and they forms cytoplasmic multi-protein complexes, inflammasomes, with pro-caspase-1, the effector molecule, with or without 
the adapter molecule, such as the apoptosis-associated speck like 

341

CARD-domain containing protein (ASC).94-96 Inflammasomes are 
activated by sensing PAMPs or DAMPs via NLRs,97,98 and leads to 
activation of inactive pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1, which 
in turn, induce cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including 
pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18, into active forms of IL-1β and 
IL-18, respectively.94,99 IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and 
plays a central role in regulation of inflammation by binding to the 
IL-1 receptor. IL-18 induces activation and IFNγ production of NK 
cells.100
Previous studies suggested that LPS significantly induces 
the mRNA expression of inflammasome components, including 
NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 via NFκB 
activation.101,102 Serum levels of IL-1β were increased in alcoholic 
lever disease.103,104
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN CHRONIC LIVER 
DISEASES AND PORTAL HYPERTENSION
Alcohol can disrupt the intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions 
to impair the gut barrier function, which induce bacterial translocation and elevated endotoxin levels in the portal blood flow.105-107
Impaired gut permeability was also reported in NAFLD.12,16 A recent study suggested that modulation of the intestinal microbiota 
through multiple inflammasome components is a critical determinant of NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression as well 
as multiple other aspects of metabolic syndrome such as weight 
gain and glucose homeostasis.66 In liver cirrhosis, the changes in 
intestinal motility and subsequent alteration of microflora content, 
decreased mucosal integrity, and suppressed immunity in hepatic 
fibrosis contribute to failure of the intestinal mucosal barrier with 
subsequent increases in bacterial translocation and LPS levels in 
hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.40,108-112
Consistently, plasma level of LPS is increased in patients with 
chronic liver diseases by viral hepatitis,31,112 alcohol,114,115 and 
NAFLD.116 Liver injury can be prevented by elimination of gramnegative microflora with Lactobacillus or antibiotics or Kupffer cell 
depletion with gadolinium chloride.71,72,117 Therefore, LPS-induced 
Kupffer cell activation is currently considered as a main mechanism 
for pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.118 Similarly, genetically 
obese rodents showed increased sensitivity to endotoxin119 and 
LPS challenge enhance the liver injury and induce inflammatory 
cytokine in mice with NAFLD.120 Some studies suggested that gut 
flora contribute to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis in mice with 
fatty liver121 and treatment with probiotics reduce hepatic injury 
in obese mice.122 Furthermore, a previous study suggested that 
LPS-induced inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of liver 
cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.123 Intraperitoneal 
administration of LPS can increase portal pressure124 and increased 
portal pressure can increase intestinal permeability.23,125,126 Bacterial translocation and increased production of proinflammatory 
cytokines and nitric oxide further impair contractility of mesenteric 
vessels in patients with cirrhosis, which could further increase portal pressure.127,128
A previous study reported that liver fibrosis and inflammation 
were significantly reduced after bile duct ligation in the TLR4-
mutant mice and they suggested that LPS-TLR4 pathway play 
a crucial role in the hepatic fibrogenesis.129 It is supported by a 
large cohort study demonstrating that the TLR4 single nucleotide 
polymorphism predicts the risk of liver cirrhosis in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C infection.130
CONCLUSION
Various evidences suggest the gut-liver axis−from disruption of 
gut barrier function, bacterial translocation, and increase in LPS 
in the liver and systemic circulation to TLR and/or inflammasomes 
activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines−as the 
main mechanism of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. 
Therefore, understanding this axis and the signaling pathway may 
provide new targets for the prevention or treatment of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
