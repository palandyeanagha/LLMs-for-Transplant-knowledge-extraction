Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease
in type 2 diabetes. Currently, there is a lack of information
on associations between NAFLD and microvascular complications of diabetes. We assessed the associations between
NAFLD and both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and retinopathy in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals using
a cross-sectional design.
Methods Prevalence rates of retinopathy (by ophthalmoscopy) and CKD (defined as overt proteinuria and/or estimated
GFR ≤60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2
) were assessed in 2,103 type 2
diabetic individuals who were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease and viral hepatitis. NAFLD was ascertained by
patient history, blood sampling and liver ultrasound.
Results NAFLD patients had higher (p<0.001) age- and
sex-adjusted prevalence rates of both non-proliferative (39
vs 34%) and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (11 vs
5%), and CKD (15 vs 9%) than counterparts without NAFLD.
In logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was associated with
increased rates of CKD (odds ratio 1.87; 95% CI 1.3–4.1,
p=0.020) and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (odds
ratio 1.75; 1.1–3.7, p=0.031) independently of age, sex,
BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes duration,
HbA1c, lipids, smoking status and medications use.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that NAFLD
is associated with an increased prevalence of CKD and
proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy in type 2 diabetic
individuals independently of numerous baseline confounding
factors. Further studies are required to confirm the reproducibility of these results and to evaluate whether NAFLD
contributes to the development or progression of CKD and
retinopathy.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in its whole
spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis to
steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, is the most common cause of
abnormal liver function tests among adults in Western
countries [1–4]. The prevalence of NAFLD has been
reported to be in the 15 to 30% range in the general population in various countries [5–7] and is almost certainly
increasing. Accordingly, a huge number of individuals are
at risk of developing advanced chronic liver disease.
Compared with non-diabetic individuals, people with type
2 diabetes appear to be at increased risk of developing NAFLD
and certainly have a higher risk of developing fibrosis and
cirrhosis [1–4]. It has been reported that ∼70 to 75% of type
2 diabetic patients have some form of NAFLD [8, 9].
There is now growing evidence that NAFLD, especially
in the type 2 diabetic population, may be linked to an
increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD)
independently of other known risk factors [9–13]. It
suggests that the identification of NAFLD in patients with
type 2 diabetes may help predict CVD risk, with important
management implications. Identifying people with NAFLD
would highlight a subgroup of type 2 diabetic patients who
should be targeted with more intensive therapy to decrease
their risk of future CVD events.
To our knowledge, there is currently a lack of information
on associations between NAFLD and microvascular chronic
complications such as retinopathy and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes. Both of these
chronic complications represent a major problem for patients
and healthcare systems. Moreover, the possible impact of
NAFLD on risk of these complications deserves particular
attention in view of the implications for screening/surveillance strategies in the growing number of NAFLD patients.
We have assessed whether NAFLD, as diagnosed by
ultrasound, the most widely used imaging test for detecting
hepatic steatosis, is associated with an increased risk of
prevalent retinopathy and CKD in a large cohort of type 2
diabetic adults using a cross-sectional design.
Methods
Participants Study participants were recruited from the
Valpolicella Heart Diabetes Study cohort, a prospective
observational study designed primarily to evaluate associations between type 2 diabetes and incidence of chronic
vascular complications. Details on the study design and
recruitment methods have been published elsewhere [11,
12]. Briefly, we enrolled all of the outpatients with type 2
diabetes (n=2,103; 66.3% of the whole sample of patients
who attended the clinic) who regularly attended our clinic
in the period January to December 2000 and who did not
have any clinical evidence of cancer, cirrhosis or other
secondary causes of chronic liver disease (alcohol abuse,
viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepato-toxic medications such as amiodarone, glucocorticoids, barbiturates,
tamoxifen and other chemotherapics) and were also free of
diagnosed CVD (angina, myocardial infarction, ischaemic
stroke, recurrent transient ischaemic attacks, lower extremity amputation, claudication, carotid stenosis >60% or prior
coronary/peripheral revascularisation procedures as ascertained by patient history and examination, chart review,
electrocardiograms and echo–Doppler scanning of carotid
and lower limb arteries) [11, 12]. This cohort of patients
was comparable for main demographic variables with the
whole sample of patients who regularly attended our clinic.
All participants gave their informed consent. The local
ethics committee approved the study protocol.
Clinical measurements and laboratory procedures BMI
was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height
in metres squared. Waist circumference was measured at the
level of the umbilicus. Blood pressure was assessed in
triplicate with a standard mercury manometer. Information
on daily alcohol consumption, smoking status and current
use of medications was obtained from all participants by questionnaire [11]. Most participants were abstainers (76.6%) or
drank minimally (alcohol consumption <20 g/day; 13.2% of
total); only 10.2% (n=215) of participants drank moderately
(alcohol consumption ranging from 20 to 60 g/day).
Venous blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast. Serum liver enzymes, creatinine and other biochemical blood measurements were determined by standard
laboratory procedures (DAX 96; Bayer Diagnostics, Milan,
Italy). Most participants had serum liver enzymes within
the reference ranges in our laboratory, which for aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γglutamyltransferase (GGT) activities were 10 to 35 U/l for
women and 10 to 50 U/l for men, respectively. It is known
that diabetic patients with NAFLD can have raised or normal
serum liver enzymes; aminotransferases fluctuate over time
and they may be in the reference range, irrespective of
steatosis, when a single measurement is used [1–3]. No
participants had seropositivity for viral hepatitis B and C.
LDL-cholesterol was calculated by Friedewald’s equation
[i.e. (total cholesterol – HDL-cholesterol – triacylglycerol)/
5]. HbA1c was measured using a high-performance liquid
Diabetologia (2008) 51:444–450 445

chromatography analyser (HA-8140; Menarini Diagnostics,
Florence, Italy); the upper limit of normal for the laboratory
was 5.9%. Because a number of factors such as age,
ethnicity and sex can influence serum creatinine concentrations, the level of kidney function was defined by
estimated GFR using the formula developed and validated
in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
study [14]. The MDRD formula is as follows: estimated
GFR=186.3× (serum creatinine−1.154)× (age−0.203)×1.212
(if black)×0.742 (if female). Urinary AER was measured
from an early morning urine sample as the albumin/creatinine
ratio (ACR) by an immuno-nephelometric method; microalbuminuria and macro-albuminuria (overt proteinuria) were
defined as ACR >2.5 and >30 mg/mmol for men and ACR
>3.5 and >30 mg/mmol for women, respectively [15]. For this
study, CKD was defined as overt proteinuria and/or
estimated GFR ≤60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 [14]. Both of these
outcome measures were confirmed in all participants in a
least two consecutive occasions (within 3–6 months after the
initial examination).
At baseline, a single ophthalmologist, who was blinded
to clinical patients’ characteristics, diagnosed retinopathy
by fundoscopy after pupillary dilation, according to a
clinical disease severity scale [16, 17]. The intra-observer
variability for the estimation of non-proliferative retinopathy was within 4%. Retinopathy was classified into three
categories as follows: absent, non-proliferative (i.e. microaneurysms, intra-retinal haemorrhages and/or hard exudates)
and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (new vessel formation, fibrous proliferations, vitreous haemorrhages or
previous laser coagulation therapy). Proliferative retinopathy
was confirmed by fundus fluorescein angiography in all
participants [17]. The presence of sensory neuropathy (by
biothesiometer) was not extensively recorded among the
study participants.
Hepatic ultrasonography scanning was performed in all
participants by an experienced radiologist, who was blinded
to participants’ details. The diagnosis of hepatic steatosis
was made on the basis of characteristic sonographic
features, i.e. evidence of diffuse hyper-echogenicity of liver
relative to kidneys, ultrasound beam attenuation and poor
visualisation of intra-hepatic structures [1–3]. Liver ultrasonography has a sensitivity of ∼90% and a specificity of
∼95% in detecting moderate and severe steatosis, but its
sensitivity is reduced when hepatic fat infiltration upon
liver biopsy is less than 33% [18]. A semi-quantitative
sonographic scoring for the degree of hepatic steatosis was
not available in our study. The intra-observer variability for
the ultrasound diagnosis of hepatic steatosis was within
3% [19].
Statistical analysis Data are means±SD unless otherwise
indicated. Skewed variables (serum triacylglycerol and
creatinine concentrations) were logarithmically transformed
to improve normality prior to analysis. Statistical analyses
included the unpaired t test and the χ2 test (for categorical
variables). The independence of the associations of variables with prevalent retinopathy and CKD, included as the
dependent variables, was assessed by multivariable logistic
regression analyses and expressed as odds ratios (OR). In
these analyses, men and women were combined and firstorder interaction terms for sex × NAFLD interactions on
risk for retinopathy and CKD were examined. Because the
interactions were not statistically significant, sex-pooled
multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess
the independence of the association of NAFLD with
retinopathy or CKD, respectively. Retinopathy was categorised as absent, non-proliferative or proliferative/lasertreated, whereas CKD was defined as presence of overt
proteinuria and/or estimated GFR ≤60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2
[14]. We performed two multivariable logistic regression
models: (1) model 1, in which ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD,
sex, age, BMI, waist circumference, smoking status, LDLcholesterol, triacylglycerol, HbA1c, diabetes duration and medications use (hypoglycaemic, lipid-lowering, anti-hypertensive
or anti-platelet drugs) were included as covariates; and (2)
model 2, which additionally adjusted for hypertension (blood
pressure ≥130/85 mmHg or being treated for hypertension)
and presence of CKD or retinopathy, respectively. In light of
the well-known association between alcohol drinking and
liver injury [1–3], we repeated the analyses described above
after excluding participants who were light to moderate
drinkers (n=492, 23.4%). Values at p<0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
Results
Among the 2,103 study participants, 284 (13.5%) had CKD
defined as either overt proteinuria or estimated GFR ≤60 ml
min−1 1.73 m−2 (205 of whom had estimated GFR ≤60 ml
min−1 1.73 m−2 without overt proteinuria) and 398 (18.9%)
participants had isolated microalbuminuria, whereas 987
(46.9%) participants had retinopathy (798 of whom had
non-proliferative retinopathy and 189 had proliferative/
laser-treated retinopathy). The prevalence rates of nonproliferative and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy and
CKD were essentially similar between men and women.
The baseline characteristics of participants stratified by
NAFLD status are shown in Table 1. Persons with NAFLD
were older, more centrally obese, more likely to be male
and had both longer diabetes duration and greater frequency
of hypertension than those without NAFLD. They also had
lower estimated GFR and HDL-cholesterol, and higher
triacylglycerol, HbA1c and liver enzymes (although the vast
446 Diabetologia (2008) 51:444–450

majority of NAFLD patients, i.e. ∼88%, had serum ALT
activity concentrations within the reference range). Moreover, the proportion using insulin or anti-hypertensive drugs
was higher in NAFLD patients, whereas the proportion using
aspirin, statins or fibrates was essentially similar in both
groups. Smoking status and LDL-cholesterol did not
significantly differ between the groups.
Notably, as shown in Table 1, participants with NAFLD
had higher age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of nonproliferative and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy, and
higher isolated microalbuminuria and CKD than their
counterparts without NAFLD.
In univariate logistic regression analysis (Table 2),
NAFLD was associated with increased prevalence rates of
retinopathy or CKD (p<0.001). Male sex, older age, hypertension, HbA1c, diabetes duration, diabetes treatment
(insulin), estimated GFR (inversely), triacylglycerol, LDLcholesterol, liver enzymes (ALT and GGT), smoking (only
for nephropathy) were also significantly associated (p<
0.001 for all) with increased rates of retinopathy or CKD
(not shown). Presence of CKD was also closely associated
with a greater prevalence of proliferative/laser-treated
retinopathy (p<0.001).
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the significant association of NAFLD with non-proliferative (p<0.01)
and proliferative/laser-treated (p<0.001) retinopathy was
only slightly weakened after adjustment for age, sex, BMI,
waist circumference, smoking, LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HbA1c, diabetes duration and medications use
(Table 2). After additional adjustment for hypertension
and CKD (Table 2), the association between NAFLD and
non-proliferative retinopathy became not significant, whereas the prevalence rate of proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy remained approximately twofold greater among those
with NAFLD (p=0.031).
Similarly, the association between NAFLD and CKD
(Table 2) was little affected by adjustment for age, sex, BMI,
waist circumference, smoking, LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HbA1c, diabetes duration and medications (p<0.001;
model 1). The prevalence rate of CKD remained markedly

greater in patients with NAFLD after further adjustment for
hypertension and proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (p=
0.020; model 2). The results did not substantially change
after exclusion of participants with isolated microalbuminuria
(p=0.031; model 2; not shown).
All statistical analyses yielded qualitatively similar results
in participants with microalbuminuria alone, but the association between NAFLD and isolated microalbuminuria
became not significant after multiple adjustments for the confounders included in model 2.
Almost identical results were obtained in regression
models that also adjusted for serum ALT or GGT activity
concentrations (not shown). In univariate regression analysis, both serum ALT and GGT concentrations were
significantly associated with CKD (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–3.4
for ALT; and 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–3.0 for GGT, respectively)
and with proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (1.3, 1.1–2.8
for ALT; and 1.5, 1.1–3.3 for GGT, respectively). However,
neither ALT nor GGT were associated with retinopathy
and CKD after controlling for age, sex, diabetes duration,
HbA1c, medications use and components of the metabolic
syndrome.
Exclusion of participants who were light to moderate
drinkers did not alter the independent associations between
NAFLD and increased rates of CKD (OR 2.01, 95% CI
1.2–4.8) and of proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy (OR
1.72, 1.1–4.9), respectively.
Discussion
This is the first study specifically aimed at assessing the
associations of ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD with retinopathy and CKD in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals.
Our major finding was that NAFLD, as diagnosed by
patient history, blood sampling and characteristic sonographic features, is closely associated with increased
prevalence rates of CKD and proliferative/laser-treated
retinopathy in a type 2 diabetic population. Notably, these
associations appear to be independent of a broad spectrum
of baseline confounding factors, such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes duration, glycaemic control,
components of the metabolic syndrome and medications
use (statins, aspirin, hypoglycaemic and anti-hypertensive
drugs). Additionally, our patients were free of diagnosed
CVD and cirrhosis; the evaluation of patients with such
complications would almost certainly have confounded interpretation of the data. Our findings are corroborated by a
recent prospective study of 10,337 apparently healthy men
followed for ∼3.5 years, demonstrating that mildly elevated
serum GGT activity concentrations (as surrogate markers of
NAFLD) are associated with an increased incidence of
CKD (defined as overt proteinuria and/or estimated GFR
<60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2
) independently of age, BMI,
metabolic syndrome features, insulin resistance as estimated
by the homeostasis model assessment, C-reactive protein,
cigarette smoking and daily alcohol consumption [20].
Another major finding of our study was that more than
four-fifths (∼88%) of NAFLD patients had serum ALT
activity concentrations within the reference range. This
finding provides further evidence that ALT and other serum
liver enzymes appear to be insensitive markers for NAFLD,
especially in the type 2 diabetic population. Indeed, it is
well known that the full histological spectrum of NAFLD
may be present among patients with ‘normal’ serum liver
enzymes, which therefore cannot be reliably used to exclude
the presence of advanced NAFLD [1–4]. Our finding further
supports the notion that the ‘normal’ reference values for
serum liver enzymes currently used to exclude NAFLD
need to be revised [2, 21, 22].
Clearly, we must be cautious in making any causal
inference, given the cross-sectional design of the study. The
underlying biological mechanisms by which NAFLD might
contribute to the development or progression of CKD and
retinopathy are poorly understood. The most obvious
explanation for our findings is that the greater prevalence
of CKD and retinopathy in NAFLD patients simply reflects
the coexistence of underlying known risk factors. However,
since in our study NAFLD was associated with CKD and
proliferative/laser-treated retinopathy independently of a
broad spectrum of established risk factors, it is conceivable
that NAFLD may confer an excess risk over and above the

risk expected as a result of the underlying known risk factors.
This suggests that NAFLD is not merely a marker of vascular
complications of diabetes, but may also be involved in their
progression. The possible molecular mediators linking
NAFLD, retinopathy and CKD may include the release of
some pathogenic mediators from the liver, including the
following: elevated advanced glycated end-products, increased reactive oxygen species, elevated C-reactive protein,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, IL-6, TNF-α, transforming growth factor-β1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Importantly, several studies have shown that these potential
mediators of vascular and/or renal injury are markedly higher
in obese and/or diabetic patients with NAFLD than in those
without [23–32]. Consistent with the hypothesis that liver
inflammation (or other liver-derived factors) in NAFLD may
play a direct role in the development or progression of CKD,
Cheng et al. have shown that in a large cohort of Chinese
type 2 diabetic patients, those with chronic hepatitis B virus
infection were more likely to develop end-stage renal disease
than those not infected with hepatitis B virus [33]. Finally,
NAFLD may worsen whole-body insulin resistance and
hyperglycaemia [2–4, 13], which may in turn contribute to
the progression of retinopathy and CKD [27, 34–36]. This
notion is supported by the observation, in this study, that
HbA1c was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than
in those without.
The potential implications of our findings for patient care
are that in people with type 2 diabetes the casual detection of
NAFLD during ultrasound examination should alert clinicians to the coexistence of chronic vascular complications
warranting evaluation and treatment as much as the risk of
advancing liver disease.
Our study has several strengths, including the large
number of participants, the complete nature of the dataset,
the ability to adjust for multiple confounders and the
ultrasound diagnosis of NAFLD in all participants. However, despite the comprehensive nature of the dataset, there
are some potential limitations to our study. First, the crosssectional study design precludes the establishment of causal
or temporal relations between NAFLD, CKD and retinopathy. Prospective studies will be required to sort out the
time sequence of events. Second, we used estimated GFR
rather than more precise measures of kidney function, like
iothalamate clearance. Third, the diagnosis of non-proliferative
retinopathy was based only on fundoscopy (whereas that of
proliferative retinopathy was confirmed by fundus fluorescein
angiography), so it is possible that subtle retinopathy changes
may have been missed. However, the possibility that subtle
retinopathy changes might have gone partly unnoticed would
have weakened, rather than strengthening our findings. Fourth,
although our results were adjusted for components of the
metabolic syndrome, a condition closely associated with
insulin resistance, we did not directly measure insulin
resistance by euglycaemic clamp in our population. Finally,
the NAFLD diagnosis was based on ultrasound imaging
(without a semi-quantitative scoring for the degree of steatosis)
and exclusion of other secondary causes of chronic liver
disease, but was not confirmed by liver biopsy. It is known that
none of the radiological features can distinguish between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other forms of NAFLD, and that
only liver biopsy can assess the severity of damage and the
prognosis [1–4]. However, liver biopsy would be impossible
to perform routinely in a large epidemiological study.
Moreover, liver ultrasound is by far the commonest way of
diagnosing NAFLD in clinical practice [1–4]; it has a good
sensitivity and specificity in detecting moderate and severe
steatosis, but this sensitivity is reduced when hepatic fat
infiltration upon biopsy is less than 33% [18]. Thus, although
some non-differential misclassification of NAFLD on the
basis of ultrasound is likely (some of the control persons could
have underlying NAFLD, despite normal serum liver enzymes
and a negative ultrasound), this limitation would serve to attenuate the magnitude of our effect measures towards null; thus,
our results can probably be considered as conservative estimates
of the relationship between NAFLD, CKD and retinopathy.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that NAFLD is
associated with an increased prevalence of proliferative/
laser-treated retinopathy and CKD in a large cohort of type
2 diabetic individuals. This association appears to be
independent of a broad spectrum of baseline confounding
variables, such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors,
diabetes duration, glycaemic control, metabolic syndrome
components and medications use (i.e. hypoglycaemic, lipidlowering, anti-hypertensive and anti-platelet drugs). These
cross-sectional findings, although not definitive, are sufficiently provocative to warrant further study. Future prospective studies could, for example, determine whether
NAFLD actually predicts the development or progression
of retinopathy and CKD in type 2 diabetes.
