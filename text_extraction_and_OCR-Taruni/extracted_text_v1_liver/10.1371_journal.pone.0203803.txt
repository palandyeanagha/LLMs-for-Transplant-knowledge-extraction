Abstract
Introduction
Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is increasingly investigated as a means to assess
liver quality, but data on viability markers is inconsistent and the effects of different perfusion
routes and oxygenation on perfusion biomarkers are unclear.
Methods
This is a single-centre, randomised, multi-arm, parallel study using discarded human livers
for evaluation of HMP using arterial, oxygen-supplemented venous and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion. The study included 2 stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were randomised into static cold storage (n = 7), hepatic artery HMP (n = 10), and non-oxygensupplemented portal vein HMP (n = 8). In the second stage, 20 livers were randomised into
oxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 9,
respectively). Changes in dynamic, biochemical, and morphologic parameters during 4-
hour preservation were compared between perfusion groups, and between potentially transplantable and non-transplantable livers.
Results
During arterial perfusion, resistance was higher and flow was lower than venous perfusion
(p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); this was associated with higher perfusate markers
during arterial perfusion (p>0.05). Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alteration in the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic
preservation groups. Perfusate markers were 2 fold higher in non-transplantable livers
(p>0.05).

Conclusions
Arterial only perfusion might not be adequate for graft perfusion. Hepatocellular injury markers are accessible and easy to perform and could offer insight into graft quality, but large
randomised trials are needed to identify reliable quality assessment biomarkers.
Introduction
Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has gained interest as a potential means to improve
the outcome of marginal livers and allow viability assessment in high-risk grafts [1–5]. Despite
this potential of HMP, data on viability biomarkers is inconsistent and none of the investigated
biomarkers is able to differentiate between viable and non-viable livers [1, 6, 7].
Although HMP allows for assessment of dynamic perfusion parameters, there is no conclusive evidence that dynamic parameters correlate with graft quality, and the progression of
these parameters differs significantly between studies; while recent clinical studies reported
stable hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) pressures during HMP [2, 3], others observed
a drop in HA resistance and increased flow during HMP, suggesting relaxation of the arterial
walls and improved microcirculation [8–11]. Several perfusate markers have been investigated,
but none were able to assess graft viability reliably, and different cut-off values were proposed
to indicate the severity of reperfusion injury [3, 7, 10]. Histological examination is limited
to steatosis assessment in clinically suspicious grafts [12–14], but it is not currently used for
viability assessment due to its invasive nature, limited amount of tissue, and lack of a morphological standard for viability assessment [1, 7]. In addition, human studies reported controversial results on the morphology of livers preserved with HMP and static cold storage (SCS)
[2, 15–17]. Finally, the benefits of supplementary oxygen during short-term end ischemic
hypothermic perfusion have been documented in pre-clinical and clinical studies [4, 5, 18],
but the effect of supplementary oxygen on injury markers during human liver HMP is unclear.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the progression of dynamic, biochemical and histological markers during HMP in the human liver, comparing arterial, oxygen-supplemented
venous and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion, and to study these markers in relation to organ quality.
Materials and methods
This is single-centre, randomised, multi-arm parallel group study.
Participants
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the North London Regional Ethics Committee 3 (reference no. 10/H0709/70), and confirmed with the National Health Service Blood and
Transplant (NHSBT) Organ Donor Transplant committee. None of the transplant donors
were from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed
consent that was freely given.
The study involved 45 sequential livers procured for transplantation by different organ procurement teams across the UK between February 2012 and June 2014. All livers were retrieved
using the standard clinical procurement protocols adopted by the UK National Organ
Retrieval Service (NORS) (http://www.odt.nhs.uk/national-organ-retrieval-service/policiesand-reports), but were found to be unsuitable for transplantation by UK transplant centres

due to a combination of donor graft and recipient factors (Table 1). Livers were transported
from the retrieval hospital to our research centre packed in ice and stored in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Only whole livers from deceased donors were used; one split liver was
excluded from the study.
Randomisation
The original prototype of the Organ Recovery Workstation1, based on the Lifeport Kidney
Transporter machine (Organ Recovery Systems, Zaventem, Belgium), did not incorporate an
oxygen delivery system, which was later integrated during the study period. Consequently, an
oxygenated perfusion group could not be randomised at the start of the study, and was added
during the second stage of the study. Livers were randomised at 2 stages: stage 1, 25 livers were
randomised into static cold storage (SCS, n = 7), arterial perfusion through the hepatic artery
(AP, n = 10), and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion through the portal vein
(nOVP, n = 8). Arterial perfusion was studied herein to further assess this perfusion modality
following an earlier published study by our team [16], which showed equivalence of endothelial preservation using different perfusion routes. In stage 2, 20 livers were randomised into
oxygen-supplemented perfusion (OVP, n = 11) and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion (nOVP, n = 9). The nOVP groups in stages 1 and 2 of the study were similar in characteristics and perfusion settings. Simple randomisation was performed using a computergenerated list of random numbers and the allocation sequence was concealed in numbered,
opaque, and sealed envelopes. Sample size calculation was not performed.
Interventions
Livers in the SCS group were submerged in 2 L of KPS-1 and placed in the icebox for 4 hours.
Although KPS-1 is not conventionally used for static preservation, it was used for SCS herein
to reduce preservation solution variance between groups. Livers in the AP group were cannulated through the HA (Lifeport SealRing™ 10x35 cannula), and livers in the nOVP and OVP

groups were cannulated through the PV (Lifeport Straight 8mm cannula). HMP livers were
connected to the non-pulsatile roller pump of the Organ Recovery Workstation, and perfused
with 2 L of recirculating KPS-1 through the HA or PV, at 30 mmHg or 7 mmHg, respectively.
The preservation period of 4 hours was hypothesised as adequate to observe dynamic and biochemical changes during HMP.
For the OVP group, 100% oxygen was administered at a fixed rate of 0.5 L/min using a
membrane oxygenator (Dideco Kids D100, Sorin Group Italia, Mirandola, Italy) connected to
the perfusion circuit, achieving a perfusate pO2 of 735.1 mmHg (724.1–791.4).
Hypothermia was maintained between 4–8˚ C using a heat exchanger (Polystat temperature
controller, Cole-Parmer UK) and a built-in iced-water container around the perfusion bowl.
Similar to clinical studies by Guarrera [2, 3], no metabolic adjustment was undertaken.
Outcome measures
Dynamic perfusion parameters (flow and vascular resistance) were continuously measured in
the HA (AP group) and PV (nOVP and OVP groups) using built-in sensors in the Organ
Recovery Workstation and recorded hourly. Hepatocellular injury enzymes (alanine transaminase, ALT; aspartate transaminase, AST) were measured in the perfusate using Roche P
Module analyser (Roche Diagnostics Limited, UK), immediately before HMP, then hourly
afterwards. For morphological assessment, a wedge biopsy was taken from segment 4 and segment 7 before and after 4-hour preservation (SCS and HMP groups). The rationale for using
biopsies from 2 different segments of the liver is based on evidence published elsewhere [19].
Paraffinised, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained liver biopsies were examined under light
microscopy by a liver histopathologist. Assessors of biochemistry and histology samples were
blinded to the allocation groups. A scoring system previously published by Vekemans et al.
[17] was used to score morphological changes, based on enlargement of the space of Disse,
sinusoidal dilatation, coagulation necrosis, congestion, architectural damage, and neutrophil
infiltration.
Statistical analysis
Data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM
Corp. Continuous data was presented as median (interquartile range) and categorical data was
presented in numbers and percentages. Non-parametric tests were used due to small sample
size and abnormal distribution. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) and Friedman tests were used to compare differences between and within groups, respectively. When KW test or Friedman test
showed a significant difference, a pairwise comparison using Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon
test was performed. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Donor graft characteristics
Characteristics of the donor grafts (n = 45) are presented in Table 2. There were no significant
differences in donor graft variables (age, heart-beating status, cold and warm ischaemia times,
and macrosteatosis) between the groups.
Stage 1 of the study
During the first stage of the study, livers were randomised into 3 groups: SCS (n = 7), AP
(n = 10), and nOVP (n = 8).

Dynamic parameters during HMP. Resistance was stable in the nOVP group throughout
HMP but decreased significantly in AP group from 0 to 1 hour (1.20 mmHg/ml/min (0.43–
1.22) to 0.87 mmHg/ml/min (0.43–1.18), p = 0.01). Flow increased significantly in both groups
from 0 to 1 hour (AP 26 ml/min (21–49) to 33 ml/min (25–48), p = 0.03; nOVP 86 ml/min
(58–126) to 94 (59–128), p = 0.04). Resistance in the HA was significantly higher than PV
(0.83 mmHg/ml/min (0.41–1.11) versus 0.07 mmHg/ml/min (0.05–0.10), p = 0.001), and perfusate flow was significantly lower in the HA compared to the PV (33 ml/min (24–48) versus
92 ml/min (59–127), p = 0.01), Fig 1.
Hepatocellular injury markers during HMP. ALT increased significantly throughout
perfusion in the AP and nOVP groups (p  0.001 both groups) and AST levels showed a similar trend (p = 0.004 and < 0.001 for AP and nOVP groups, respectively). Of note, there was a
steep rise in enzyme levels between 0 and 1 hour HMP in both groups. The enzymes were
higher in AP group compared to nOVP group, but the difference was not significant (ALT,
p = 0.53; AST, p = 0.50), Fig 2.
Morphology score in SCS and HMP. The change in morphology score was not different
between groups at the end of static and dynamic preservation (p = 0.38), Fig 3.

Dynamic parameters during HMP. Resistance was stable throughout perfusion in both
groups, but flow increased significantly from 0 to 1 hour (nOVP 49 ml/min (39–76) to 58 ml/
min (44–84), p = 0.01; OVP 53 ml/min (48–69) to 59 ml/min (52–75), p = 0.03). There was no

groups, Fig 4.
Hepatocellular injury markers during HMP. ALT and AST increased significantly

Comparison between potentially transplantable and non-transplantable
livers
Out of 45 livers, 7 livers were potentially transplantable. 3 livers were not transplanted due to
lack of suitable recipients, while 4 more livers were rejected due to suspicious liver lesions and
capsular tears (2 each), (Table 1).
Potentially transplantable livers had lower median ALT and AST levels when compared to
non-transplantable livers, although the difference was not statistically significant (median

ALT: 348 IU/L (221–1590) vs. 653 IU/L (291–1875), p = 0.39; median AST: 512 IU/L (305–
1896) vs. 1019 IU/L (429–2405), p = 0.31).
The median PV resistance in potentially transplantable livers was 0.11 mmHg/ml/min
(0.08–0.17) and the median flow was 60 ml/min (49–80), compared to 0.10 mmHg/ml/min
(0.06–0.14) and 67 ml/min (52–94) in non-transplantable livers (p = 0.25 and 0.65, respectively). None of the livers in the HA-only perfusion group were potentially transplantable, so a
comparison could not be performed. Histology scores in potentially transplantable livers were
not significantly different from non- transplantable livers (p = 0.97).
Discussion
Despite the recent expansion in utilisation of HMP to improve the outcome of marginal livers
in clinical practice, data on viability markers is inconsistent and no markers are yet validated.
HMP is mostly performed using dual-vessel or PV-only perfusion, and feasibility of both
approaches has been reported in recent clinical trials [2–4, 11] although the optimal perfusion
route is not currently known. Arterial-only perfusion is less commonly used, based on evidence from animal studies showing increased graft injury and heterogeneous perfusion using
the HA only [20, 21].

We found the HA and PV resistance to be similar to those documented in a previous study
of discarded human livers preserved with dual-vessel perfusion at similar pressures to our
experiments [10], which suggests that similar PV flows can be achieved with PV-only perfusion and questions the need for additional HA cannulation and perfusion. In addition, a recent
study in rat, pig and discarded human DCD livers showed complete perfusion of the parenchyma and biliary system using hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) using the PV
only [22].
Perfusate flow increased in the first hour of HMP in all perfusion groups and there was a
significant reduction of arterial resistance during the same time period. These changes in perfusion dynamics are likely to be due to “opening up” of the microvasculature and relaxation of
arterial walls during HMP, similar to what has been reported previously in porcine [8, 9] and
discarded human livers [10]. In line with other studies [9, 10, 23], we found the resistance to
be higher and the flow lower when the graft was perfused via the hepatic artery in comparison
to the portal vein. This is a reflection of the hepatic circulation in vivo where hepatic arterial
circulation is characterised by higher resistance and lower flow than the portal circulation due
to larger smooth muscle content in the tunica media layer in the arterial walls.
The early dynamic changes in our study were associated with a steep rise of hepatocellular
injury markers in most liver groups during the first hour of HMP, suggesting an accelerated
release of hepatocellular enzymes into the perfusate due to flushing out of enzymes accumulated in the vascular spaces, similar to observations from a previous porcine liver study [23].
Perfusate injury markers did not stabilise after the first 1–2 hours of perfusion, but increased
gradually, possibly due to pre-perfusion ischaemic injury. It is important to keep the different
rates of enzyme release in mind when collecting perfusate samples, as initial samples might not
reflect the severity of graft injury. In addition, hepatocellular injury markers were higher in
single-vessel arterial perfusion compared to single-vessel venous perfusion, although the difference was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that graft perfusion might not
be adequate if perfusion is performed using the hepatic artery alone.
There was no difference in morphology between biopsies taken from 2 distant liver segments within each liver, and the architecture was preserved after 4-hour single-vessel perfusion, which agrees with findings from previous studies in discarded human livers [16, 17]. We
did not observe significant sinusoidal dilatation or hepatocellular oedema in contrast to other
researchers [8, 10, 24]. It is possible that the architectural changes in the latter studies resulted
from prolonged storage (24 hours) or different machine perfusion setup [8, 10]. Based on our
findings herein, and from results published previously by our team [16], it seems likely that
architectural damage assessment during HMP offers limited information on the quality of
grafts, although histological examination remains of importance in evaluating steatosis severity, degree of fibrosis, and for the assessment of suspicious lesions found during organ
retrieval.
When potentially transplantable livers were compared to non-tranplantable livers, hepatocelullar markers in the perfusate were 2 fold higher in the latter group, but the difference was
not statsticaly signficant. In another proof-of-concept study, Monbaliu [10] reported that perfusae AST distinguished between potentially transplantable and non-transplantable livers, and
noted that AST and LDH levels were signficantly higher in non-transplantable livers. Although
our results match the enzyme levels documented for potentially transplantable livers in the latter study, they do not show the same level of significant difference, most likely due to the
much higher AST levels observed in non-transplantable livers in Monbaliu study (6–8 fold
higher compared to transplantable livers). AST and ALT measured during perfusion were also
found to correlate with peak post-transplant levels in the recipient in clinical trials by Guarrera

[2, 3]. Consequently, it seems that perfusate hepatocellular injury markers have the potential
to be used for graft quality assessment in the human liver.
Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alteration in dynamic, biochemical, or
morphological parameters in this cohort, but the need for active oxygenation might only manifest following warm reperfusion; consequently, the effect of oxygenation on metabolism and
mitochondrial function are better assessed using a normothermic reperfusion model.
We report one of the largest studies of discarded human livers, but we acknowledge that the
overall sample size is relatively small due to the limited number of whole human livers available for research, which restricted additional groups from being assessed in this study, such as
dual-vessel perfusion and oxygenated arterial perfusion groups. Due to technical factors
related to oxygen delivery mechanism, the oxygen-supplemented perfusion group could not
be randomised at the beginning of the study, but was later added in a second randomisation
process. This resulted in the study being divided into 2 stages, which reduced the size of intervention groups. The study is limited by lack of clinical outcome measures, as the livers were
not transplantable; the aim of the study was to describe baseline differences in biomarkers
using different perfusion modalities as a proof-of-concept. An additional period of normothermic reperfusion would have been useful here, but is not a replacement for transplantation and
in-situ reperfusion for optimal assessment of organ viability.
This study shows that perfusate injury markers have the potential for assessing graft quality
and that perfusate markers are released at a faster rate during the initial period of perfusion,
which is important if these markers are to be used for graft assessment. It is likely that singlevessel perfusion via the PV is more beneficial than HA perfusion during HMP on the basis of
perfusion characteristics and perfusate injury markers. However, additional issues of importance would be the risk of vessel injury with cannulation, the effect on hepatocyte metabolism
and bioenergetics including mitochondrial function and the unique importance of maintaining the peri-biliary vascular plexus that is associated with bile duct injury following transplantation. In order to evaluate the optimal perfusion settings and to identify objective markers of
graft quality during perfusion, large prospective and randomised clinical trials are needed, as
the current knowledge is mainly derived from small size feasibility studies. In addition, biomarker standardization and guidelines on outcome definitions are required to enable an unbiased comparison between different studies.
