SUMMARY: The term hepatic encephalopathy (HE) includes a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities occurring in patients with liver dysfunction. Most cases are associated with cirrhosis and portal
hypertension or portal-systemic shunts, but the condition can also be seen in patients with acute liver
failure and, rarely, with portal-systemic bypass and no associated intrinsic hepatocellular disease.
Although HE is a clinical condition, several neuroimaging techniques, particularly MR imaging, may
eventually be useful for the diagnosis because they can identify and measure the consequences of
central nervous system (CNS) increase in substances that under normal circumstances, are efficiently
metabolized by the liver. Classic MR imaging abnormalities include high signal intensity in the globus
pallidum on T1-weighted images, likely a reflection of increased tissue concentrations of manganese,
and an elevated glutamine/glutamate peak coupled with decreased myo-inositol and choline signals on
proton MR spectroscopy, representing disturbances in cell-volume homeostasis secondary to brain
hyperammonemia. Recent data have shown that white matter abnormalities, also related to increased
CNS ammonia concentration, can also be detected with several MR imaging techniques such as
magnetization transfer ratio measurements, fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, and
diffusion-weighted images. All these MR imaging abnormalities, which return to normal with restoration of liver function, probably reflect the presence of mild diffuse brain edema, which seems to play
an essential role in the pathogenesis of HE. It is likely that MR imaging will be increasingly used to
evaluate the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HE and to assess the effects of therapeutic
measures focused on correcting brain edema in these patients.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) reflects a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities occurring in patients with liver
dysfunction. Most cases are associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension or portal-systemic shunts, but the condition
can also be seen in patients with acute liver failure and, rarely,
with portal-systemic bypass and no associated intrinsic hepatocellular disease.1,2 The most common clinical pattern in
these patients is the development of confusion or coma precipitated by gastrointestinal bleeding, acute superimposed
hepatitis, or concomitant infection in a previously asymptomatic patient with cirrhosis. The neurologic manifestations are
mainly due to shunt of blood arising from the portal venous
bed into the systemic circulation and are reversible once the
liver function abnormality or precipitating factor has been
corrected. HE can be classified according to the underlying
liver disease and the evolution of the neurologic manifestations (Table 1).
Clinical Features
Clinically, HE manifests as a neuropsychiatric syndrome encompassing a wide spectrum of mental and motor disorders.2,3 The changes in mental status range from subtle cognitive dysfunction to severe coma, whereas the motor function
changes include rigidity, disorders of speech production, resting- and movement-induced tremor, delayed diadochokinetic
movements, hyper- or hyporeflexia, choreoathetoid movements, Babinski sign, and transient focal symptoms.3-7 HE can
be classified into 3 main groups on the basis of the duration
and characteristics of the clinical manifestations2
: episodic,
chronic, and minimal.
Episodic HE
Episodic HE is characterized by the development of a confusional syndrome, including impaired mental state, neuromuscular abnormalities, asterixis, fetor hepaticus, and hyperventilation, which develops during a short period of time and
fluctuates in severity. The diagnosis of episodic HE, which
requires the exclusion of a pre-existing or evolving dementia,
is based on clinical findings and relies on the presence of consistent neurologic manifestations in a patient with severe liver
failure and/or portal-systemic shunt surgery. There are no
available diagnostic tests to confirm clinically suspected HE.
Arterial ammonia analysis adds nothing to the diagnosis of
typical patients but is sometimes the clue for diagnosing atypical patients, particularly those with no previous history of
liver disease. Neuroimaging techniques also have limited diagnostic value but are required in some atypical patients to
exclude other neurologic diseases that can exhibit similar clinical manifestations, such as metabolic encephalopathies,
stroke, seizure, meningitis, or encephalitis.
Chronic HE
Chronic HE can be subclassified into relapsing HE and persistent HE. Relapsing HE manifests as frequent episodes of acute
HE that may be due to precipitating factors (gastrointestinal
hemorrhage, uremia, use of psychoactive medication or diuretics increasing renal ammonia release, dietary indiscretion,
infection, constipation, dehydration, hypo- or hyperkalemia,
and hyponatremia) but, in most cases, are spontaneous or
related to discontinuation of medication. Between acute episodes of HE, which do not differ from those described previously for episodic HE, the patient can be perfectly alert and not
show any sign of cognitive dysfunction. However, a careful
neurologic examination and neuropsychological tests may reReceived January 29, 2008; accepted January 30.

veal subtle abnormalities, such as extrapyramidal signs and
mild cognitive impairment.
Persistent HE refers to manifestations that do not reverse
despite adequate treatment. Assessment of the severity of persistent HE is based on the West Haven criteria for semiquantitative grading of mental status, which consider the level of
impaired autonomy, changes in consciousness, intellectual
function and behavior, and dependence on therapy (Table 2).2
The most characteristic manifestations of severe persistent
HE are dementia, parkinsonism, or myelopathy in combination with other manifestations of neurologic involvement
(ataxia, gait abnormalities, tremor). This clinical picture is seldom seen currently because of the availability of liver transplantation and the small number of patients who undergo
portal-systemic shunt surgery.
Minimal HE
Minimal HE, also known as latent or subclinical HE, refers to
the population of patients with cirrhosis or portal-systemic
shunts who have subtly abnormal cognitive and/or neurophysiologic function. These abnormalities cannot be detected
by standard clinical examination8 but may produce clinical
consequences because they have a detrimental impact on
health-related quality of life and on the ability to perform
complex tasks such as driving.9
The absence of clinical evidence of HE is key to the diagnosis of minimal HE and can only be determined by a detailed
assessment of the patient’s history and a comprehensive neurologic evaluation of consciousness and cognitive and motor
functions. The neuropsychological features of minimal HE
point to a disorder of executive functioning, particularly selective attention and psychomotor speed, but other abnormalities are also seen.9,10A complete psychometric assessment by a
neuropsychologist is the best way to know the extent of the
patient’s cognitive impairment and how it interferes with daily
life. However, this evaluation is not easy to carry out because
of the cost, complexity, and length of the study. Diagnostic
methods that demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities attributable to liver failure in a patient with no
clinical evidence of HE would be valid as an alternative diagnostic method for minimal HE. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, an arbitrary consensus to define a gold standard to compare the reliability of the different methods has not been
reached. The current recommendation is to apply short batteries of diagnostic neuropsychological tests adapted to the
cultural characteristics of the population being evaluated. Several neuroimaging techniques such as single-photon emission
CT, positron-emission tomography, and MR imaging have
shown abnormalities in cerebral blood flow, brain metabolism, and brain structure in patients with minimal HE.11However these abnormalities reflect the pathogenic process that
underlies the condition, rather than providing diagnostic
information.
Pathogenesis of HE
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the complex neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in HE. The clinical manifestations of HE appear to reflect primarily a shift in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission
toward a net increase of the former, as a consequence of at least
2 factors. The first is downregulation of glutamate receptors
following excessive extrasynaptic glutamate accumulation resulting from impaired re-uptake into nerve endings and astrocytes (liver failure inactivates the glutamate transporter in astrocytes). The second factor is an increase in inhibitory
neurotransmission due to increased levels of natural benzodiazepines and increased availability of GABA-aminobutyric
acid.12,13
Pathogenic mechanisms that may be responsible for HE
include accumulation in blood of several compounds that are
efficiently metabolized by the liver under normal circumTable 1: Classification of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

stances, such as manganese and ammonia, which then enter
the brain where they induce disturbances in astrocyte and neuron function.14-17
Manganese
The CNS is an important target for manganese, an essential
element that is normally excreted via the hepatobiliary route.18
Manganese has a key role in the normal functioning of several
enzymes including mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, glutamine synthetase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.19-21 The metal was first considered to be neurotoxic
more than 150 years ago, when workers employed in grinding
black oxide of manganese developed an unsteady gait and
muscle weakness.22 Since that time, many cases of manganese
neurotoxicity (manganism), a neurologic disease characterized by psychological and neurologic abnormalities, with
some similarities to Parkinson disease, have been reported,
particularly in miners, smelters, welders, and workers involved in the alloy industry.23-25 Typically, patients exhibit
extrapyramidal changes that include hypokinesia, rigidity, and
tremor.
In patients with cirrhosis or portal-systemic shunts, manganese is elevated in plasma and is then transferred to the brain
through the blood-brain barrier by several transport systems.
This increase in brain manganese has a neurotoxic effect, inducing selective neuronal loss in basal ganglia structures and
reactive gliosis. These effects are more prominent in the globus
pallidus (particularly the medial segment), the substantia
nigra reticulata, and, to a lesser extent, the striatum, with sparing of the substantia nigra pars compacta neurons and striatal
dopamine.14,26-28 This selective vulnerability of basal ganglia
structures probably explains the development of parkinsonian
manifestations (bradykinesia, rigidity) in HE,29 which are
chronic and usually mild.
Parkinsonian manifestations in HE can be distinguished
from idiopathic Parkinson disease by early gait and balance
dysfunction, relative absence of resting tremor, presence of
mild cognitive impairment at the time of presentation, elevated serum manganese levels, and little or no response to
levodopa.30-34 These differences can be partially explained by
the fact that manganese preferentially produces pallidal degeneration, while sparing the nigrostriatal system, in contrast
to Parkinson disease, which preferentially damages dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.31
MR Imaging Marker of Manganese Accumulation within
the CNS
Since the introduction of MR imaging in clinical practice, the
fact that most patients with cirrhosis or portal-systemic shunts
exhibit a bilateral symmetric high signal intensity at the globus
pallidus and substantia nigra has been well described (Fig
1).35,36 The signal intensity may increase after a transjugular
intrahepatic portal-systemic stent shunt surgery with transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic stent placement37 and reverses after normalization of liver function36 or after occlusion
of congenital portal-systemic shunts.38 The most plausible explanation for the increased T1 signal intensity is a rise in manganese concentration (a paramagnetic substance) in the CNS,
with preferential deposition in the globus pallidus.39 The arguments favoring the manganese hypothesis include the dramatic blood and CSF manganese increase in patients with cirrhosis and pallidal hyperintensities,40-42 normalization of MR
imaging signal intensity abnormalities and manganese levels
after liver transplantation,36 and the severalfold increase in
manganese concentrations from pallidal samples obtained at
autopsy in patients with cirrhosis.43,44
This manganese-related MR imaging signal-intensity abnormality has also been described in patients without cirrhosis, such as those receiving total parenteral nutrition,45-48
those with occupational exposure to manganese from welding,49 and those with noncirrhotic portal vein thrombosis or
congenital portal-systemic bypass and no intrinsic hepatocellular disease.50-52 In all these situations, the MR imaging signal-intensity changes resolve after discontinuation of manganese intake.45-47 Similar findings were observed in a patient
with Alagille syndrome,53 an autosomal dominant disorder

characterized by cholestasis, intrahepatic bile duct paucity,
end stage liver disease, and elevated blood manganese.
Bilateral basal ganglia T1 signal-intensity changes have also
been observed in several conditions unrelated to increased
brain manganese levels (eg, nonketotic hyperglycemic episodes, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, basal ganglia calcification, neurofibromatosis type I, and Japanese encephalitis),
though the high signal intensity occurring in these conditions
does not usually show symmetric predominantly pallidal
involvement.54
Although pallidal hyperintensities are found in approximately 90% of patients with cirrhosis, these signal-intensity
alterations are not closely linked to the presence of HE. Patients with cirrhosis and no clinical, neuropsychological, or
neurophysiologic signs of HE can also show severe signal-intensity alterations, whereas others with manifest HE may
present only slight signal-intensity alterations.55,56 Moreover,
longitudinal studies have shown quick regression of HE after
liver transplantation, whereas T1 signal intensity abnormalities need up to 1 year to resolve.56-59 This clinical MR imaging
discrepancy may be explained by the fact that T1 high signal
intensity cannot be used as a quantitative measure of tissue
manganese because it represents only a semiquantitative measurement of abnormal manganese deposition. Thus, it is possible that manganese accumulation participates in the pathogenesis of HE only after reaching a certain degree, which may
not be clearly identified by MR imaging. Recent data support
the concept that the presence of parkinsonism is related to the
extension of the high signal intensity to midbrain structures
(particularly the substantia nigra) because this MR imaging
feature is unique to patients with cirrhosis-related parkinsonism (Fig 1).30
Ammonia
The main source of ammonia is the gut, and an important
amount is of bacterial origin.60 The concentration of ammonia in portal blood is high and undergoes a high degree of
extraction in the liver (90%). Patients with liver failure or portal-systemic shunt surgery have elevated levels of circulating
ammonia, which enters the brain through the blood-brain
barrier, increasing the brain-blood ammonia concentration
ratio (normally in the order of 2) up to fourfold in liver failure.
Positron-emission tomography studies by using nitrogen-13
ammonia provide evidence of the increased blood-brain ammonia transfer and brain ammonia utilization rates in patients
with chronic liver failure.61 This hyperammonemia results in
profound astrocyte changes, including Alzheimer type II
changes in chronic HE and astrocyte swelling in acute HE. In
fact, brain edema and increased intracranial pressure are the
most important and well-recognized complications of fulminant hepatic failure. The mechanism for astrocyte swelling in
acute liver failure remains uncertain but is likely to include
excessive generation of osmolytes, mainly glutamine, within
the astrocytes62 as a result of ammonia detoxification through
the action of glutamine synthetase. Additionally, abnormalities in intracellular pH and membrane potential can disrupt
ion homeostasis and lead to cell swelling.63
Nevertheless, although cerebral glutamine increases to a
similar extent in both acute and chronic liver failure, brain
edema and death from intracranial hypertension are only
rarely complications of chronic liver failure.64 One possible
explanation for this observation is that the relatively more
rapid evolution of the syndrome in fulminant hepatic failure
may not allow homeostatic compensatory metabolic changes
to counteract the osmotic unbalance induced by intra-astrocytic glutamine accumulation. In chronic liver failure, there is
enough time for activation of effective compensatory mechanisms of cellular adaptation to the osmotic change65: glial accumulation of 1 organic osmolyte, glutamine, should lead to
the loss of other organic osmolytes, such as myo-inositol, taurine, and choline.66 In patients with cirrhosis subjected to ammonia load, this mechanism of osmolar adaptation is clearly
reflected in proton MR spectroscopy (1
H-MR spectroscopy)
studies, which consistently show increases in the glutamine/
glutamate signal intensity accompanied by myo-inositol depletion and decreases in the choline signal intensity (Fig
2).67-73 This osmoregulatory mechanism is activated after liver
failure and accounts for the protection against massive edema
in chronic liver failure.74
The extent of the 1
H-MR spectroscopy alterations increases
with increasing grade of HE, though these changes have also
been observed in patients with cirrhosis and neither clinical
nor psychometric or neurophysiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction.73 Lee et al68 reported no differences in 1
H-MR spectroscopy findings between patients with and without HE and a
similar extent of liver dysfunction. Thus, the characteristic
1
H-MR spectroscopic changes seem to reflect metabolic more
than functional brain alterations.
Some studies assessing the evolution of 1
H-MR spectroscopic abnormalities after liver transplantation57,58,75 have
demonstrated their reversibility after liver failure is corrected
(Fig 2), though the evolution of these changes differs for each
metabolite. The choline peak normalizes earlier than the other
peaks and at 1–2 months may even show a small increment
over normal values. The glutamine/glutamate peak reaches
the normal range at 1–2 months, except in patients with higher
pretransplant values, who may take longer.58,59The peak myoFig 2. 1

echo acquisition mode pulse sequence (TR/TE, 1600/20 ms; acquisitions, 256). The main
resonances correspond to N-acetylaspartate (NAA, 2.0 ppm), glutamine/glutamate (Glx,
2.1–2.5 ppm), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr, 3.02 ppm), choline-containing compounds (Cho,
3.2 ppm), and myo-inositol (Ins, 3.55 ppm). The initial spectrum shows an increase in the
glutamate/glutamine region and a decrease in the myo-inositol and choline resonances.

in both examinations.

inositol abnormalities normalize slower than the other peaks
and may take 3–7 months to reach normal values. This reversibility of 1
H-MR spectroscopic abnormalities precedes the disappearance of pallidal hyperintensity after liver transplantation or after occlusion of large portal-systemic shunts58 and
correlates with improvements in the neurologic manifestations of HE.76
Diffuse Brain Edema in Chronic Liver Failure
Recent data suggest that despite the adaptive response to increased glutamine concentration, mild astrocyte swelling occurs in the entire spectrum of liver disease and may be partially
responsible for the development of HE in chronic liver disease.74,77,78 A few reports have described brain edema in patients with cirrhosis64,79 and astrocyte swelling in animal models of minimal HE.80 In addition, the Alzheimer type II
astrocyte, the characteristic neuropathologic finding in patients with cirrhosis, represents a swollen astrocyte, which can
be regarded as a manifestation of cerebral edema associated
with chronic liver failure.81 However, conventional MR imaging techniques have not revealed T2-weighted signal-intensity
abnormalities within the brain indicating the presence of cerebral edema. Different MR imaging techniques, such as magnetization transfer (MT) imaging,57,82,83 fast fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging,84 and diffusionweighted imaging (DWI),85,86 which are much more sensitive
to changes in brain tissue water content than conventional T2
sequences, have been recently applied for examination of the
brain in patients with cirrhosis to obtain data on the attractive
hypothesis of the presence of diffuse brain edema, related to
hyperammonemia, in patients with chronic liver disease.
MT Imaging
MT imaging is mainly based on the interaction (cross-relaxation) between protons in a relatively free environment (bulk
water) and those in which motion is restricted (immobile water).87 Exchange of this saturated magnetization with free water reduces the signal intensity observed in the subsequent MR
image. The degree of signal-intensity loss depends on the attenuation of the macromolecules in a given tissue. Low MT
ratios (MTRs) indicate reductions in brain structures able to
exchange magnetization with the surrounding water molecules and thereby reflect myelin damage, cell destruction, or
changes in water content. Experimental and human studies
support the hypothesis that demyelination and axonal loss are
the main contributors to the MTR decrease seen in several
pathologic conditions, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, toxic demyelination, progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy, human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis.88-92 Severe MTR decrease
correlates directly with the severity of demyelination and axonal loss, but less severe decrease is more difficult to interpret
because inflammation, edema, and moderate demyelination
can also contribute to these MTR values.
Different studies have assessed MTR in the brain of patients
with cirrhosis.57,82,83 All these works found low MTR values in
all the examined regions of the CNS. Compared with other
diseases, the MTR decrease is mild (approximately 10%) and
is not accompanied by significant abnormalities on conventional T1- and T2-weighted images. This MTR decrease almost returns to normal values after liver transplantation, thus
supporting the hypothesis that these changes reflect mild brain
edema.57 Another explanation for MTR decreases has been
proposed by Iwasa et al93 in a study focusing on basal ganglia
abnormalities. On the basis of the correlation between MTR
and manganese concentration in phantom experiments, the
authors proposed that MTR decreases could be secondary to
the accumulation of manganese in the CNS. However, MTR
improves rapidly after liver transplantation, whereas pallidal
hyperintensity shows a slower disappearance,49 in keeping
with the time course of normalization after manganese intoxication.47 Furthermore, MTR is low in all brain regions,
whereas manganese accumulation predominates in the globus
pallidum.29 The issue of whether the mild brain edema detected by MTR participates in the development of neurologic
manifestations is still unresolved. Although a correlation between MTR values and neuropsychological function has not
been demonstrated in chronic liver disease, it has been shown
that MTR normalization progresses in parallel with the correction of neuropsychological disturbances after liver
transplantation.57
Fast FLAIR Sequences
Conventional MR imaging is not sensitive enough to detect
slight diffuse increases in brain water content. Nonetheless,
the following novel MR imaging finding in patients with
chronic liver failure has been described: high signal intensity
along the hemispheric white matter in or around the corticospinal tract on fast FLAIR T2-weighted images, strikingly similar to signal-intensity abnormalities noted in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Fig 3).84,94 Two possible explanations
were given for this previously undescribed signal-intensity abnormality in patients with liver cirrhosis: first, the use of fast
FLAIR, a sequence that (at least in the supratentorial compartment) has demonstrated higher sensitivity than conventional
T2-weighted sequences for depicting white matter lesions
(WMLs).95 Second, these abnormalities might have been interpreted as a normal finding because fast FLAIR sequences
are able to trace the corticospinal tract as a faint symmetric
signal-intensity increase in approximately half of healthy
adults.96,97However, the progressive normalization of this signal-intensity abnormality with improvement of liver function
excluded this second interpretation (Fig 3).84
The most plausible explanation for the T2 signal-intensity
hyperintensity along the hemispheric white matter in or
around the corticospinal tract is the presence of mild brain
edema, which is further supported from the results of a recent
study, which, by using a coregistered MR imaging technique,
demonstrated an increase in ventricular volume following
medical treatment of HE.98
The T2 signal-intensity changes observed in some patients
with cirrhosis are quite similar to those observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which the pathologic bases are axonal
loss, demyelination, or wallerian degeneration.99 However,
none of these pathologic features have been described in association with HE. Moreover, the 1
H-MR spectroscopic findings
of normal N-acetylaspartate indices (a neuronal marker) and
low concentrations of choline-containing compounds indicate preservation of axonal attenuation and lack of demyelinating processes (Fig 1).57 The progressive normalization of
1616 Rovira  AJNR 29  Oct 2008  www.ajnr.org

the high-signal-intensity abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis after successful liver transplantation (Fig 2)84 further
supports the hypothesis that edema is the main cause because
resolution of demyelination and axonal loss would not be expected after restoration of liver function.
The selective involvement of the white matter within or
close to the corticospinal tract observed in patients with cirrhosis may be simply due to a low threshold for visual detection of a widespread white matter alteration because fast
FLAIR sequences are able to trace this tract as a faint symmetric signal-intensity increase in approximately half of healthy
adults.96 Alternatively, this selective involvement may reflect a
higher vulnerability of this white matter for the development
of edema secondary to liver failure. In fact, pyramidal signs are
frequently observed in HE7
; thus, selective involvement of the
corticospinal tract in a preclinical state of hepatic encephalopathy could be expected. The reasons for this greater vulnerability of the corticospinal tract are unknown, but they may
include higher energy demands and higher susceptibility for
excitotoxicity.100-102
Involvement of the corticospinal tract on fast FLAIR imaging correlates with abnormalities of transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive neurophysiologic method
that assesses central motor pathway function.103 In patients
with cirrhosis without overt HE-significant TMS shows increases in central motor conduction time and motor cortical
threshold and decreases in motor-evoked potential amplitude.76 These TMS abnormalities reverse in parallel with the
signal intensity of the corticospinal tract on fast FLAIR images
after liver transplantation, indicating that this signal-intensity
abnormality in patients with chronic liver disease is associated
with subclinical functional abnormalities of the corticospinal
tract.
White matter focal T2-weighted lesions (WMLs) may be
also present in patients with liver cirrhosis with or without
overt HE. These lesions resemble those commonly seen in patients with different types of cerebrovascular small-vessel disease (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) and in the healthy elderly
population (Fig 4).104 Due to their location and small size,
WMLs in patients with cirrhosis can be easily ignored or interpreted as normal involutive or chronic ischemic changes.
However in patients with cirrhosis, these lesions decreased
their volume with the improvement of HE105 or after liver
transplantation,106 a fact that is closely correlated with the
improvement of neuropsychological function (Fig 4). The
partial reversibility of these focal WMLs is on the opposite side
of what occurs with focal WMLs attributable to cerebrovascular small-vessel disease. Particularly in patients with hypertension and diabetes, WMLs may increase with time, but never
decrease107-109 and, therefore, are permanently visible on MR
imaging, indicating that they represent irreversible tissue
damage. The decrease in the volume of WMLs observed in
patients with cirrhosis can be explained by changes in the
amount of brain edema. It is plausible that liver failure is responsible for low-grade brain edema, which could be exacerbated in areas of small-vessel disease and reverse after liver
transplantation.
DWI
MTR and fast FLAIR sequences are highly sensitive in detecting an increase in net water content in the brain tissue. However, they cannot distinguish whether this increase is intracellular or extracellular and, therefore, cannot fully support the
theory that mild brain edema in chronic liver failure is secondFig 3. A, Transverse T2-weighted fast FLAIR images obtained in a patient with liver cirrhosis during an episode of hepatic encephalopathy. Observe the symmetric areas of increased signal
intensity along the corticospinal tract in both cerebral hemispheres. B, This signal-intensity abnormality almost completely reverses on a follow-up study obtained few months later, when

ary to astrocyte swelling. This issue could be resolved by DWI,
which could potentially locate the compartment where the
water increase is more prominent.
Recent data on the use of mean diffusivity measurements
within normal-appearing white matter of patients with cirrhosis have yielded unexpected results. Different studies have
shown significant increase in brain water diffusivity, which
was more pronounced with increasing grade of HE.85,86,110
These diffusivity values correlated with neuropsychological
impairment and with serum venous ammonia. These findings,
according to the basic understanding of diffusivity,111 probably reflect an accumulation of water in the extracellular compartment and, therefore, do not support the hypothesis of astrocytic swelling as the cause of diffuse brain edema in chronic
liver failure.
The exact mechanism of this increase in extracellular fluid
is not known. Plausible explanations would be the extracellular migration of the macromolecules during the cellular osmoregulatory mechanism induced by the increase in astrocytic
glutamate or an increased blood-brain barrier permeability. In
fact, hyperammonemia may induce an increase in blood-brain
barrier permeability,112 which will tend to favor cerebral capillary water influx to the brain. Moreover, Alzheimer type II
astrocytes, a common abnormality in HE that was interpreted
as a sign of astrocyte swelling, may correspond indeed to cellular damage and lose of cellular shape caused by oxidative
stress, instead of intracellular edema.113Another proposed explanation is that exposure of the brain to ammonia results in
reduced expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins,
such as the structural glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a
cytoplasmatic filamentous protein that constitutes a major integral part of the cellular component in mature astrocytes.114,115 Reduced expression of GFAP induces morphologic changes in astrocytes, favoring diffusivity in the

Fig 4. A, Baseline MR imaging study (transverse fast FLAIR T2-weighted image) of a 56-year-old patient with hepatitis C cirrhosis without overt hepatic encephalopathy. Multiple focal
WMLs in both cerebral hemispheres are attributed to small-vessel disease. B, A new scan obtained 2 years later during an episode of hepatic encephalopathy shows marked increase
in the size of these focal WMLs. C, A new follow-up scan after complete resolution of neurologic symptoms shows a decrease in the size of the WMLs. This last scan was almost identical
to the first study. A lacunar infarct is seen in the deep right frontal white matter.

extracellular space.116 In acute liver failure, mean diffusivity
values have been shown to be reduced,117 therefore supporting
an increased cell volume secondary to massive intra-astrocytic
increase of glutamine as the mechanism of brain edema.
Therefore, 2 different type of brain edema may exist in liver
failure, intracellular in acute forms and probably interstitial in
chronic forms.
Conclusions
Different MR imaging data obtained in patients with different
types of liver failure have improved our understanding of the
pathogenesis of HE, such as the involvement of manganese
deposition in parkinsonism and the development of mild
grade cerebral edema and osmotic abnormalities secondary to
the increase in brain ammonia (Table 3). All these data support the use of MR imaging as a useful tool to study the pathogenesis of HE in humans, for the adequate interpretation of
cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis, and for assessing the effects of therapeutic measures focused in correcting this disorder.
