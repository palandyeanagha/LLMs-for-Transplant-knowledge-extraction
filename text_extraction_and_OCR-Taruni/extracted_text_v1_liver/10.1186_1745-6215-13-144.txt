Abstract
Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an important
health problem worldwide. Only 10 to 15% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients are suitable candidates for
treatment with curative intent, such as hepatic resection and liver transplantation. A majority of patients have
locally advanced, liver restricted disease (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system intermediate stage).
Transarterial loco regional treatment modalities offer palliative treatment options for these patients; transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) is the current standard treatment. During TACE, a catheter is advanced into the
branches of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor, and a combination of embolic material and chemotherapeutics
is delivered through the catheter directly into the tumor. Yttrium-90 radioembolization (90Y-RE) involves the
transarterial administration of minimally embolic microspheres loaded with Yttrium-90, a β-emitting isotope,
delivering selective internal radiation to the tumor. 90Y-RE is increasingly used in clinical practice for treatment of
intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma, but its efficacy has never been prospectively compared to that of the
standard treatment (TACE). In this study, we describe the protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial
aimed at comparing the effectiveness of TACE and 90Y-RE for treatment of patients with unresectable (BCLC
intermediate stage) hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods/design: In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 140 patients with unresectable (BCLC intermediate
stage) hepatocellular carcinoma, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 and Child-Pugh A
to B will be randomly assigned to either 90Y-RE or TACE with drug eluting beads. Patients assigned to 90Y-RE will first
receive a diagnostic angiography, followed by the actual transarterial treatment, which can be divided into two sessions
in case of bilobar disease. Patients assigned to TACE will receive a maximum of three consecutive transarterial treatment
sessions. Patients will undergo structural follow-up for a timeframe of two years post treatment. Post procedural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at one and three months post trial entry and at three-monthly
intervals thereafter for two years to assess tumor response. Primary outcome will be time to progression. Secondary
outcomes will be overall survival, tumor response according to the modified RECIST criteria, toxicities/adverse events,
treatment related effect on total liver function, quality of life, treatment-related costs and cost-effectiveness.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary malignant
tumor of the liver, is the sixth most common cancer
worldwide with an incidence of 626,000 new patients a
year, and the third most common cause of cancerrelated death [1]. HCC is a heterogeneous disease in
terms of etiology and clinical behavior. It usually develops in the setting of chronic liver disease, mostly related
to infection with hepatitis B or C, excessive alcohol intake and, today, also more as a consequence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [2]. Cure can only be
achieved by hepatic resection, liver transplantation and
in certain cases by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [3]. Although there is no universally accepted HCC staging
system, many have adopted the Barcelona Clinic Liver
Cancer (BCLC) staging classification, which links the
stage of the disease to a specific treatment strategy [4,5].
Only 10% to 15% of all patients with HCC are eligible
for treatment with curative intent, and local ablative
treatment is limited by strict criteria on the stage of the
disease (that is, disease confined to the liver and limited
number of lesions with relatively small dimensions
(maximum of three lesions <3 cm in size) according to
the BCLC staging classification). However, the majority
of patients present at more advanced stages and are not
eligible for such treatment.
For patients with locally advanced, liver restricted disease
(BCLC intermediate stage), transarterial loco regional treatment modalities offer palliative treatment options. These
therapies exploit the dual blood supply to the liver. HCC
derives its blood supply almost entirely from the hepatic
artery, while liver parenchyma derives >75% of its blood
supply from the portal vein [6]. This anatomical fact provides the basis for the development of intra-arterial therapies for the treatment of HCC, with the potential of
selectively inducing tumor necrosis while sparing surrounding liver parenchyma. Antitumoral agents, such as
cytotoxic drugs or radionuclides, can be delivered at the
site of the tumor, as they lodge in the peritumoral vascular
bed after intra-arterial injection.
This randomized controlled trial is designed to compare two transarterial loco regional therapies applied for
the treatment of patients with intermediate stage HCC:
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), the current
standard treatment, and Yttrium90 radioembolization
(
90Y-RE), a newer treatment modality.
Transarterial chemoembolization
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a procedure
in which a catheter is advanced into the branches of the
hepatic artery supplying the tumor, and a combination
of embolic material and chemotherapeutics is delivered
through the catheter directly into the tumor. This way
arterial inflow to the tumor is reduced, resulting in
ischemic tumor necrosis, and washout of the chemotherapeutic agent is diminished, thereby prolonging
contact time between cancer cells and the drug [7].
According to the BCLC staging classification and
treatment schedule, TACE can be considered the current
standard treatment for patients with intermediate stage
HCC with compensated liver disease, with a reported
median survival of around 17 months [8-10].
Two randomized, controlled trials [11,12] and two systematic reviews [13,14] demonstrated a survival benefit
of TACE in this selected patient group. A more recent
Cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that there
is no firm evidence to support or refute TACE in
patients with unresectable HCC [15]. However, this review is controversial since some studies included in the
meta-analysis included patients that are no longer consistent with the more stringent selection criteria currently applied for TACE (BCLC intermediate stage B
with compensated liver disease) and there are discrepancies in treatment application between the studies. The
lack of standardization accompanied with the application
of conventional TACE (mostly performed with a mixture
of chemotherapeutics, lipiodol and an occluding agent)
is no longer an issue with the arrival of drug-eluting
beads (DEBs). DEBs act as both an occluding agent as
well as a drug-loaded carrier, achieving local ischemia
and cytotoxic death of the tumor with one device, enabling standardization [16]. Several clinical trials reported
DEBs to be effective for treatment of intermediate stage
HCC [16-20], with objective response (complete plus
partial response) rates ranging from 60% to 85.5%, which
is substantially higher compared to the mean objective
response of 35% (range 16% to 61%) stated in a metaanalysis of RCTs for conventional TACE [14]. The complication rates are considered acceptable, although postembolization syndrome is observed in 37% to 100% of
the treated patients. This is a condition in which the patient experiences abdominal pain, fever, ileus and nausea,
self-limiting hours to days after the procedure, probably
due to damage of hepatocytes [21]. Most importantly,
these trials report no systemic toxicity despite the high
doses of doxorubicin loaded on the DEBs [16-20]. The
PRECISION V trial compared conventional TACE with
TACE-DEB in a large, randomized study [22]. The
TACE-DEB group showed higher rates of complete response, objective response and disease control when
compared with conventional TACE at six months (27%
vs. 22%, 52% vs. 44%, 63% vs. 52%); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Subgroup analysis
showed that TACE-DEB results in a higher tumor control rate in patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, bilobar
disease or reduced performance score compared to conventional TACE. This was achieved without an increased
risk of adverse events [15].

Yttrium-90 radioembolization
Yttrium-90 radioembolization (90Y-RE) is a relatively recently developed technique which involves the transarterial
administration of minimally embolic microspheres loaded
with Yttrium-90, a β-emitting isotope, delivering selective
internal radiation to the tumor. This brachytherapy device
is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
HCC with and without portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Several prospective and retrospective studies demonstrated
the safety and efficacy of 90Y-RE treatment for unresectable HCC, all documented in a recent review [23]. An earlier structured meta-analysis describes a response rate of
78% (glass microspheres) and 89% (resin microspheres)
[24]. The largest prospective study to date included 291
HCC patients that were treated with 90Y-RE [25]. In intermediate stage patients (BCLC stage B) median time to progression was 13.3 months (Child-Pugh A, 13.3 months and
Child-Pugh B, 17.4 months) and median survival was
17.2 months (Child-Pugh A, 17.3 months and Child-Pugh
B, 13.5 months).
Study rationale
Although 90Y-RE is increasingly used in clinical practice,
there is no high quality clinical evidence to justify this.
Lewandowsky et al. [10] retrospectively analyzed HCC
patients with disease beyond the Milan criteria for liver
transplantation and concluded that radioembolization
outperforms TACE for down-staging HCC to within
transplant criteria. The results of a single-center study
carried out by Kooby et al. [26], in which patients treated with chemoembolization or radioembolization were
retrospectively compared, suggests that both treatment
modalities have similar effectiveness and safety profiles
in patients with unresectable HCC. Carr et al. [27] carried out a similar retrospective analysis and concluded
that chemoembolization or radioembolization appeared
to be equivalent regional therapies for patients with
unresectable, nonmetastatic HCC. Recently Salem et al.
[28] retrospectively compared 122 HCC patients who
received chemoembolization with 123 patients who
received radioembolization and concluded both patient
groups had similar survival times. Radioembolization
resulted in longer time-to-progression and less toxicity
than chemoembolization.
To date, no prospective studies have been performed
comparing both treatment modalities in a randomized setting. This randomized controlled trial is designed to prospectively compare TACE and 90Y-RE for treatment of
patients with unresectable (BCLC intermediate stage) HCC.
Methods
Study participants
Patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC class B; locally advanced, liver restricted
disease, not eligible for curative treatment) with Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1 and Child-Pugh A to B and written informed
consent will be eligible for inclusion. The HCC diagnosis
will be confirmed by typical appearance on imaging
(four-phase multidetector CT scan or dynamic contrast
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), that is,
hyper vascular enhancing lesion in the arterial phase and
contrast washout in the portal venous or delayed phase,
or by cytohistological tissue sampling by biopsy in case
of inconclusive imaging findings [29]. Exclusion criteria
to be applied are lack of informed consent, extrahepatic
disease, abnormal organ or bone marrow function (as
determined by bilirubin >45 μmol/l (or 2.6 mg/dl),
serum albumin <28 g/l, AST/ALT >5x institutional
upper limit of normal (ULN), creatinine >1.5x institutional ULN, hemoglobulin <6.0 mmol/l, absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 109
/l, platelet count <60 x 109/l),
compromised biliary system, hypersensivity to doxorubicin, pregnancy or breast feeding, >50% of liver involvement, main portal vein (right, left or common trunk)
thrombosis, unmanageable intolerance for contrast
medium, life expectancy less than three months or
otherwise impossible follow-up. Previous local therapy
for HCC will not be a contraindication if at least one
measurable target lesion is present, which has not been
treated previously.
Study design
This is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled
trial. Patients will be recruited after referral by their
hepatologist or another treating physician. Treatment allocation will be performed by minimization, which is a
valid alternative to standard randomization to ensure
balance between groups for several prognostic factors
[30]. The following prognosis-related patient characteristics will be taken into account: Child-Pugh stage (A/B),
ECOG performance status (0/1), prior curative (resection or percutaneous ablation) treatment (yes/no) and
bilobar disease (yes/no). The minimization procedure
will be stratified by treatment center, with the aid of validated software, whereby a random component (10%) is
to be introduced.
Assessment before treatment
Pre-procedural MRI will be performed within four weeks
prior to the date of minimization to define HCC lesions
by number, volume and location.
Intervention
TACE
TACE will be performed with drug-eluting beads, that is,
polyvinyl alcohol-based microspheres (DC BeadW, Biocompatibles, Farnham, UK), 100 to 300 μm in diameter,
Seinstra et al. Trials 2012, 13:144 Page 3 of 7

loaded with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin.
Patients will receive a maximum dose of 150 mg doxorubicin per single treatment session. No dose adjustment
will be made for bilirubin concentration or body surface
area. Dose determination is based on previous dose escalation studies, in which DEBs loaded with doxorubicin
up to 150 mg were shown to be safe and effective
[19,20], and recommendations from the literature
[17,22]. After mixing with nonionic contrast medium,
the DEBs will be slowly injected under fluoroscopic
visualization while the contrast flow rate is observed; the
embolization endpoint will be reached when all the
DEBs are administered (maximum dose is reached), or
earlier when sluggish flow is seen (to avoid reflux and
non-target embolization). Total administered dose will
be recorded.
Injection of DEBs will be performed as selectively as
possible after Cone-Beam CT confirmed perfusion of the
target lesions. If selective administration is not possible,
a lobar treatment will be performed. The TACE procedure will be repeated after two months. A third TACE at
four months after initial treatment will only be performed in the case of residual enhancement on the three
months follow-up contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the
liver. The moment of the first treatment will be defined
as trial entry.
90Y-RE
90Y-RE will be performed using glass Yttrium-90 microspheres (TheraSphereW, MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario,
Canada). The target dose to the liver will be 100 to
120 Gy. The procedure will be carried out over two separate sessions: a work-up session and a treatment session. Meticulous work-up is very important because it
determines the overall safety of the treatment. First, a selective visceral catheterization will be performed in order
to obtain an angiographic map of the patients’ vascular
anatomy. Branches feeding gastro-intestinal organs arising from the hepatic arteries must be identified. Radioactive microspheres, administered into the hepatic
artery, should be prevented from ending up in extrahepatic organs via this route. The interventional radiologist
will actively look for the presence of the gastroduodenal
artery, right gastric artery, cystic artery and pancreaticoduodenal branches. If required, these arteries will be
embolized using coils, taking the planned catheter position for injecting the microspheres into account. Additionally, 150 MBq Technetium-99 m-labeled macro
aggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) will be injected. 99mTc-MAA is used as a surrogate in order to predict
the distribution pattern of 90Y-microspheres [31]. The
distribution of 99mTc-MAA will be visualized by whole
body planar imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT), including low dose
computer tomography of the abdomen. Accordingly,
lung shunt fraction can be calculated and deposition of
99mTc-MAA in the abdominal organs, such as the stomach, duodenum and pancreas, can indicate patent extrahepatic vessels distal to the injection site. In case a lung
dose exceeding 30 Gy (610 MBq) in a single treatment
(or 50 Gy cumulatively in case of repeated treatment) is
predicted, an activity reduction will be prescribed [32].
In case a patient has an unfavorable 99mTc scintigraphy, the 99mTc-MAA workup procedure will be
repeated, if feasible, to detect the cause of the extrahepatic deposition (for example, previously undetected patent
extrahepatic vessels arising from the hepatic artery) and
a solution will be searched for (for example, more selective placement of the catheter during injection). In the
unlikely event no solution can be found and 90Y-RE cannot be performed, the patient will be treated according
to best medical practice and will still enter the
intention-to-treat analysis in the 90Y-RE arm.
When the 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy has a favorable
outcome, patients will be readmitted to the hospital for
the treatment session within two weeks. The volume of
liver lobe to be treated and corresponding liver mass will
be determined using CT or MRI. The activity is chosen
to deliver an absorbed dose of about 120 Gy to the treatment zone in patients with no manifest risk factors for
subsequent liver decomposition. If a patient presents at
inclusion with elevated bilirubin or Child-Pugh B status,
the activity will be reduced in order to reach an
absorbed dose of 80 to −100 Gy in the target volume,
but in the case of selective treatment on a segmental
level a dose up to 150 Gy may be administered. The
radioactivity required to deliver the desired dose to the
liver will be calculated using the following formula:
Activity Required GBq ð Þ¼ ½  Desired Dose Gy ð Þ ½  Liver Mass kg ð Þ
50
The actual liver dose (Gy) delivered to the liver after
injection can be calculated using the following formula:
Dose Gy ð Þ¼ 50 ½  Injected Activity GBq ð Þ ½  1  F
Liver Mass kg ð Þ
where F is the fraction of injected radioactivity localizing
in the lungs, as measured by 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy.
The hepatic artery will be catheterized and the 90Ymicrospheres will be administered from the exact same
microcatheter position as where the 99mTc-MAA was
administered. Injection of 99mTc-MAA and 90Y therapy
will be performed as selectively as possible. In case of
bilobar disease, the right and left lobe will be treated in
two separate sessions, with a generally accepted interval
of 30 to 45 days. The moment of the first treatment will
be regarded trial entry.

Follow-up
Patients will undergo structural follow-up for a timeframe of two years post treatment. Each patient will be
seen by the treating physician during regular visits to
the outpatient clinic, during which laboratory examination will also be performed (complete blood count,
electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests, albumin, Prothrombin time/INR, alpha-fetoprotein). Postprocedural, contrast-enhanced MRI will be performed
one month after trial entry (the date of the first treatment T0), three months after trial entry and at three
monthly intervals thereafter for two years to assess
tumor response. MRI will be performed on 1.5-T scanners using a spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence and fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequence with
fat suppression. A dynamic multiphase, contrastenhanced, spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence
with arterial, portal, equilibrium and delayed phase will
be performed. In patients in which MRI is contraindicated or who are not capable of breath holding, contrast enhanced CT will be carried out. Adverse events
and toxicities will be recorded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). These criteria define
adverse events on a scale from 1 to 5, corresponding to
severity (grade 1: mild, grade 2: moderate, grade 3: severe, grade 4: life-threatening or disabling, grade 5:
resulting in death). Toxicity will only be recorded if the
grade increases from baseline. Adverse events and toxicities will be monitored for six months following the last
treatment procedure. Patients will be asked to fill out
questionnaires for quality of life assessment before
treatment and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after first
treatment. Quality of life will be measured with the
EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire
(EQ-5D), the cancer specific EORTC QLQ-C30 and its
HCC specific supplement EORTC QLQ-HCC18 and
an abbreviated version of the Short Form – Health
and Labor Questionnaire (SF-HLQ).
Objective
The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy
and safety of TACE versus 90Y-RE in patients with intermediate stage HCC.
Outcomes
Primary outcome
The primary outcome will be Time to Progression
(TTP), defined as the time elapsed since the start of
treatment until the determination of progressive disease.
Progressive disease will be determined by image evaluation according to the modified RECIST (mRECIST) response evaluation criteria [33]. The mRECIST overall
response assessment includes the evaluation of target
lesions response, non-target lesions response and the occurrence of new lesions.
The baseline for calculation of TTP will be the date of
minimization. Imaging data will be assessed by independent radiologists. In case progressive disease is determined during follow-up, patients have reached the study
endpoint and will be treated according to best medical
practice. Patients who switch to other treatments are
registered as such and overall survival will be monitored.
Secondary outcomes
1: Time to Local Progression (TLP). ‘Target liver volume’
will be determined with the use of cone-beam CT during
the interventional procedure, by implementing the perfusion area of the targeted vessel in relationship to the
anatomic localization of the liver lesion(s). TLP will be
defined as the time elapsed since the start of treatment
(baseline is the date of minimization) until local tumor
progression, ‘local’ indicating a constriction to the target
liver volume as defined by cone-beam CT. Local tumor
progression will be based on the mRECIST criteria and
defined as: An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the
diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions (whereas
target lesions for TLP evaluation are only considered
within the ‘target liver volume’), taking as a reference
the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing)
target lesions recorded since treatment started, and/or
unequivocal progression of existing no target lesions
within this perfusion area and/or the appearance of one
or more new (enhancing) lesions within this perfusion
area; 2: Overall survival; 3: Overall response to therapy
according to mRECIST; 4: Toxicities and adverse events;
5: Quality of life; 6: Treatment-related costs, in terms of
cost of therapy and number of hospitalization days, in
these patients. Cost-effectiveness of 90Y-RE versus TACE
will be assessed.
Sample size calculation
A total of 140 patients will be included. Sample size calculation was performed using PASS (Power Analysis and
Sample Size software, NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA),
using the log rank test. Assuming a follow-up time of
24 months and a median time to progression of
13.3 months after 90Y-RE, based on the best stratified
data for intermediate stage HCC patients available in the
literature [25], a clinically relevant effect size of 20% difference in time to progression (2.7 months) with a
power of 90% and a two-sided Alpha Risk of 5%, 70
patients in each treatment arm will be required. Taking
a hypothetical loss to follow-up of 2% into account in
both treatment arms, based on earlier experience with
this patient group, still gives a power of 80% if 70
patients per treatment arm are included (Alpha Risk
remains 5%).

Null hypothesis
There is no difference in TTP in patients with intermediate stage HCC treated with 90Y-RE or TACE-DEB.
The alternative hypothesis is two-sided (90Y-RE could
have a shorter or a longer TTP).
Statistical analyses
The primary outcome of the study will be time to progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis will be performed to
compare time to progression between treatment arms
and difference in TTP will be tested by using the log
rank test. The Hazard Ratio (and 95% confidence interval) will be calculated by univariate analyses. A P-value
of less than .05 will be considered to be statistically significant. Analyses will be performed according to the
intention to treat principle. In addition, per protocol
analysis will be performed, including only those patients
who completed the treatment protocol originally allocated. In terms of secondary outcomes, we will analyze
time to local progression and overall survival by means
of Kaplan Meier analysis, and test differences between
the two arms with log rank test. Differences in proportions of patients reporting toxic/adverse events or treatment related complications will be analyzed by means of
a chi square test. Differences in quality of life (as measured by standard questionnaires) over time between the
two arms will be analyzed by means of Linear Mixed
Model analysis. Statistical analysis of results will be performed with the aid of SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, USA).
Trial status
The trial is currently including patients. The first 10
patients have been minimized and treated according to
the allocated treatment arm. Until the present all
patients adhered to the trial protocol. First results are
pending.
Ethical approval
The study protocol has been approved by the ethical
boards of the participating hospitals.
