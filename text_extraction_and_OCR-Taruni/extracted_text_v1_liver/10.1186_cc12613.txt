Introduction
In the previous issue of Critical Care, Hall and colleagues 
[1] brought new insight to the pathogenic role of candida 
in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Th e fi rst reports of 
pancreatic abscesses secondary to Candida albicans were 
published in the ’80s [2], but a potential role of candida in 
SAP was suspected later [3,4]. Overall, a handful of 
articles have reported the presence of candida in infected 
pancreatic necrosis, but most reported only a few poorly 
documented cases that raised more questions than 
answers. Given the experience acquired with bacterial 
infections in SAP and the confusion generated by these 
reports, the relevance of published data must be clearly 
evaluated before thera peutic and prophylactic antifungal 
regimens can be prescribed.
Th e fi rst points that need to be clarifi ed are the 
prevalence and severity of positive candida cultures in 
SAP. Previous studies have reported various candida 
infection rates, ranging between 5% and 68.5% [5,6]. 
However, interpretation is diffi cult and depends on which 
population is analyzed; populations can be global [5,7] or 
confi ned to intensive care unit (ICU) cases [8,9] or all 
cases of SAP [9,10] or limited to infected cases [6,11]. In 
their well-documented ICU population, Hall and 
colleagues [1] reported that the an incidence of candida 
infection complicating SAP was 17.8% of cases. Th e 
authors also observed candidemia, which is rarely mentioned in the literature [5,8], in 27.8% of the cohort. Th e 
mortality rates reported in previous series of candida 
infection varied considerably (from 0% to 84% [12,13] of 
the cases) with increased [13], decreased [5], or identical 
[8,9] mortality rates compared with non-candida infections. Hall and colleagues [1] observed a twofold increase 
in mortality compared with non-infected SAP.
Discussion
Previous articles have frequently reported concomitant 
bacterial and candida microorganisms in surgical samples 
[5,8,9,12,14,15]. Positive candida cultures do not 
systematically imply active infection but might refl ect 
simply fungal colonization. Th ese results are diffi cult to 
interpret, leading some authors to defi ne true and 
possible candida infections on the basis of dubious 
criteria [5]. Decreased mortality rates [5] or the absence 
of a diff erence [8,9,15] between SAP cases with positive 
fungal samples and those with pure bacterial cultures 
might be suggestive of colonization in some cases. Th is 
confusion emphasizes the value of the second issue 
addressed by Hall and colleagues [1]: evaluation of risk 
factors for candida infection and the risk scores used to 
assess the development of invasive candidiasis. Th ese 
scores, validated in general ICU populations but not in 
patients with a presumed high risk such as SAP, are based 
on the assumption that the higher the score, the higher 
the probability of candida infection, while results situated 
in the middle range should represent colonization. Th e 
conclusions of Hall and colleagues [1], even if valid only 
in their institution, suggest that the most relevant tool for 
accurate detection of candida in SAP is the candida 
colonization index score. Patients with high candida 
colonization index scores can be considered to be at high 
risk for candida infection or are already infected.
Th ese fi ndings raise a number of additional issues. No 
clinical study has ever assessed the effi cacy of an antifungal agent in the course of SAP. Th e pharmacokinetic 
Abstract
Several studies have suggested a role of candida 
in infected cases of severe acute pancreatitis. This 
commentary reports high incidence and mortality rates 
of candida infection in this setting and demonstrates 
the value of the colonization index to detect patients 
at risk for fungal infection. These fi ndings indicate the 
need to review the place of antifungal therapy and 
prophylaxis.

characteristics of antifungal drugs in necrotic pancreatic 
tissues are practically unknown. Previous studies have 
reported the therapeutic use of amphotericin B or 
triazoles or both [5,7-9,15], but no information on the 
use of echinocandins for curative purposes is currently 
available. However, the dose of antifungal agents, 
duration of treatment, and endpoints to assess clinical 
effi cacy have never been published or even discussed.
Demonstrating that the colonization index is valid for 
detecting SAP patients at risk for candida infection raises 
the additional issue of antifungal prophylaxis. Antibacterial prophylaxis in the course of SAP has been a 
controversial issue since the ’70s and remains so. Several 
authors have proposed antifungal prophylaxis in SAP 
[5,7-9], although the most basic questions have yet to be 
resolved.
Conclusions
So that the mistakes of previous decades in the fi eld of 
bacterial infection are not repeated, a step-by-step 
approach is required. Additional scientifi cally rigorous 
studies with accurate descriptions of cases similar to 
those in the article by Hall and colleagues [1] are required 
before prophylaxis or extensive therapeutic indications of 
antifungal agents in SAP can be proposed.
