Myocardial ischemia, while causing cardiomyocyte injury, can activate innate protective processes,
enhancing myocardial tolerance to ischemia. Such processes are present in not only the heart, but also
remote organs. In this investigation, we demonstrated a cardioprotective process involving FGF21 from the
liver and adipose tissue. In response to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in the mouse, FGF21 was
upregulated and released from the hepatic cells and adipocytes into the circulation and interacted with
FGFR1 in cardiomyocytes under the mediation of the cell membrane protein b-Klotho, inducing FGFR1
phosphorylation. This action caused phosphorylation of the signaling molecules PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD,
thereby reducing caspase 3 activity, cell death, and myocardial infarction in association with improvement
of myocardial function. These observations suggest that FGF21 is upregulated and released from the liver
and adipose tissue in myocardial injury, contributing to myocardial protection by the mediation of the
FGFR1/b-Klotho–PI3K–Akt1–BAD signaling network.
Myocardial ischemia, while causing injury of cardiomyocytes and impairment of cardiac function, can
activate innate protective processes, enhancing cardiomyocyte tolerance to ischemia and promoting
myocardial repair. Such protective processes have been found within the cardiac system. Injured and
activated cells in the ischemic myocardium may express and/or release secretory factors including adenosine1,2,
opioids3,4, bradykinin5,6, and VEGF7–10 to protect the ischemic myocardium from injury, and cardiac resident stem
cells may be activated to promote myocardial regeneration11–14. Myocardial ischemia may also cause global
cardioprotective responses. One example is myocardial ischemia-induced mobilization of bone marrow cells
that promote myocardial repair and regeneration15–19. Several recent investigations have demonstrated that the
liver can respond to ischemic myocardial injury to upregulate and release cardioprotective secretory proteins20–24,
including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), as identified by microarray-based gene expression profiling21 and
protein analyses24. FGF21 was able to act on ischemic cardiomyocytes to mitigate acute myocardial injury24. The
present investigation was designed to test a signaling mechanism that mediates FGF21-based myocardial protection in the mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
FGF21 is one of the 22 FGF family proteins25–27 and is found in the liver and, to a lesser level, in the adipose
tissue27,28 and pancreatic b islet cells29. Whereas the majority of the FGF family proteins regulate cell proliferation
and differentiation in embryogenic and pathogenic processes, FGF21 has been reported to stimulate cell glucose
intake30,31, induce insulin expression in the pancreatic b cells32, and regulate lipid metabolism31,33–35. FGF21
interacts potentially with all known protein tyrosine kinase-coupled FGF receptors (FGFRs), including
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4, but preferentially binds to FGFR132,36–38, an action requiring the mediation
of the cell membrane protein b-Klotho39–42. This action was supported by recent studies addressing FGF21-
mediated regulation of lipid metabolism in adipocytes38,39. A protein tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor is known to
activate potentially the class IA members of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family and Akt1, molecules supporting cell survival in injury8,43–47. One of the potential processes downstream to these molecules is
Akt1-induced phosphorylation of the apoptosis regulatory factor Bcl-XL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter
(BAD), an action suppressing cell apoptosis8,29,48. The involvement of BAD in this signaling event is further
supported by the observation that dephosphorylation of BAD by the calcium-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin triggers mitochondrion-mediated cell apoptosis49. As apoptosis is a process involved in

myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury50,51, apoptosis suppression is
an effective approach for myocardial protection. In this investigation,
we intended to test the hypothesis that FGF21 protects cardiomyocytes from injury via the mediation of the FGFRs/b-Klotho–PI3K–
Akt1–BAD signaling network in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
injury.
Results
FGF21 upregulation in the liver and adipose tissue. FGF21 is a
secretory protein upregulated in the liver in response to myocardial
ischemia21,24. It is possible that myocardial ischemia induces FGF21
expression in other organs and tissues. To test this possibility, we
assessed the relative expression of FGF21 in the brain, ischemic
myocardium, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, small intestine,
adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle of wild-type mice with shamoperation and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. As shown
in Fig. 1A, FGF21 was expressed at a low level in the selected
organs of sham control mice. Myocardial injury caused FGF21
upregulation in the liver and adipose tissue, but not in other
organs. Primary cell types expressing FGF21 were hepatocytes in
the liver24 and adipocytes in the adipose tissue (Fig. 1B). The time
course of FGF21 expression was similar between the two cell types
(see ref. 24 and Fig. 1B). Changes in the serum level of FGF21 in
myocardial ischemia were presented in a previous report24. These
observations suggested a possible endocrine cardioprotective
mechanism involving FGF21 from the liver and adipose tissue.
Expression of FGFRs and b-Klotho in cardiomyocytes. As FGF21
interacts with all known protein tyrosine kinase-coupled FGFRs,
including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR432,36,37, we tested the
expression of these FGFRs in cardiomyocytes from wild-type mice
with and without myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. As shown
in Fig. 2A, FGFR1 and FGFR3 were expressed in cardiomyocytes
from healthy and myocardial ischemic mice, whereas the
expression of FGFR2 and FGFR4 was almost undetectable. The
expression level of FGFR1 and FGFR3 was relatively constant from
healthy to injured cardiomyocytes through a 10-day observation
period. Further tests demonstrated that the FGFR cofactor bKlotho was expressed at a basal level in the cardiomyocyte of
healthy mice, and increased in expression from 1 to 5 days and
returned to about the basal level at 10 days following myocardial
injury (Fig. 2B). These observations suggested that FGFR1 and
FGFR3 were candidate receptors for FGF21, and b-Klotho was
possibly involved in FGF21–FGFR interaction in myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury.
FGF21–FGFR1 interaction and FGFR1 phosphorylation in vitro.
To identify a FGF21 receptor, we tested FGF21 binding to FGFR1 or
FGFR3 in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Cardiomyocytes freshly isolated
from healthy wild-type mice were incubated in the presence of
recombinant mouse FGF21 (50 ng/ml) in vitro, and FGF21 binding to FGFR1 or FGFR3 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot analyses. As shown in Fig. 2C, FGFR1, but not FGFR3,
was co-immunoprecipitated with FGF21 from 5 to 120 min
following FGF21 treatment. This process was accompanied by
tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1. These observations suggested
FGFR1 as a primary receptor mediating FGF21 signaling in the
mouse cardiomyocyte.
Phosphorylation of PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD in the presence of
FGF21 in vitro. As a FGFR potentially activates the PI3K–Akt1
signaling pathway to mediate cell survival, we tested whether
FGF21 caused phosphorylation of PI3K p85 and Akt1 as well as a
downstream molecule BAD in cardiomyocytes in vitro. FGF21
treatment induced phosphorylation of PI3K p85 on Tyr 458, Akt1
on Ser 473, and BAD on Ser 136 in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes
(Fig. 2C). The phosphorylation time course of these molecules
was similar to that of FGFR1 (Fig. 2C). These observations suggested a potential signaling pathway for FGF21-mediated myocardial protection.
Phosphorylation of FGFR1, PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD in ischemic
cardiomyocytes in vivo. To demonstrate the involvement of FGFR1
as well as its potential downstream signaling molecules PI3K, Akt1,
and BAD in myocardial protection, we tested the relative expression
and phosphorylation of these molecules in cardiomyocytes isolated
from the ischemic myocardium of wild-type mice. FGFR1 was
expressed at a relatively constant level from 0.5 to 30 days, but
exhibited a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation from 1
to 5 days post myocardial ischemia (Fig. 2D). Similarly, PI3K p85,
Akt1, and BAD did not show noticeable changes in relative
expression, but exhibited transient phosphorylation on Tyr 458,
Ser 473, and Ser 136, respectively, with a time course consistent
with that of FGFR1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). This time course
also coincided with that of FGF21 expression in the liver and
adipose tissue as shown in ref. 24 and Fig. 1B, respectively. These
observations supported the involvement of FGFR1, PI3K, Akt1, and
BAD in FGF21-mediated myocardial protection.

known to mediate FGF21–FGFR1 interaction in adipocytes39–42, and
is a critical factor for FGF21-mediated regulation of metabolic
activities in vivo39. To test the influence of b-Klotho on FGF21–
FGFR1 interaction in cardiomyocytes, we suppressed b-Klotho
expression by direct injection of a b Klotho siRNA to the left
ventricular anterior wall at 6 equally spaced locations (5 mg/ml,
10 ml each location, ,0.5 mm in depth, ,2 mm apart, 2 columns)
in wild-type mice by thoracotomy with a scrambled siRNA as a
control. Following siRNA injection, the siRNA distribution and
coverage in the myocardium were evaluated by a tracing test with
a FITC-conjugated control siRNA. A single injection resulted in a
siRNA coverage about 2 mm in radius (Fig. 3A), and 6 equally
spaced injections resulted in a siRNA coverage about the size of
the ischemic myocardium (,4 mm in radius) (Fig. 3B). These
observations were confirmed by the Evans blue tracing test
(Fig. 3C and D).
At 3 days following b-Klotho or control siRNA administration,
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by 30-min coronary artery ligation. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the siRNAcovered ischemic myocardium at 1, 3, and 5 days post myocardial
injury. b-Klotho siRNA treatment suppressed the expression of
b-Klotho in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3E). The level of FGFR1 coimmunoprecipitation with FGF21 was reduced in cardiomyocytes
with b-Klotho siRNA treatment compared to that with control
siRNA treatment (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the relative phosphorylation of FGFR1, while enhanced in the presence of FGF21, was
reduced in b-Klotho siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3E).
These observations supported the role of b-Klotho in mediating
FGF21–FGFR1 interaction in the ischemic cardiomyocytes.
Role of FGFR1 in regulating phosphorylation of PI3K p85, Akt1,
and BAD. To test whether FGFR1 induces phosphorylation of PI3K
p85, Akt1, and BAD in vivo, we suppressed FGFR1 expression by
direct injection of FGFR1 siRNA to the left ventricular anterior wall
of wild-type mice as descried above with a scrambled siRNA as a
control and induced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury at 3
days after siRNA administration. At 1, 3, and 5 days following
myocardial injury, the relative expression and phosphorylation of
FGFR1 were reduced in cardiomyocytes with FGFR1 siRNA
treatment compared to that with control siRNA treatment
(Fig. 3F). When cardiomyocytes from the siRNA-covered ischemic
myocardium were incubated in the presence of recombinant mouse

FGF21 (50 ng/ml) for 20 min, a procedure known to cause
phosphorylation of FGFR1, PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD (Fig. 2C),
the relative phosphorylation of PI3K p85 on Tyr458, Akt1 on
Ser473, and BAD on Ser136 in FGFR1 siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes was reduced compared to that in control siRNA-treated
cardiomyocytes, although the relative expression of these molecules (FGFR1, PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD) remained unchanged
(Fig. 3F). These observations supported the role of FGFR1 in
regulating the phosphorylation of PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD in
cardiomyocytes.

Attenuation of caspase 3 activity by FGF21. Activation of caspase 3
is a key process of apoptosis52,53. We evaluated the relative activity of
caspase 3 in sham control and ischemic cardiomyocytes from wildtype and FGF212/2 mice at 24 hrs, a time chosen because of the
presence of maximal cell death as tested by the TUNEL assay24.
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury caused a significant increase in the relative activity of caspase 3 in wild-type cardiomyocytes. FGF21 deficiency further promoted activation of caspase 3,
whereas administration of recombinant FGF21 significantly
reduced the relative activity of caspase 3 in cardiomyocytes
(Fig. 4A). The accessibility of FGF21 to the ischemic myocardium
was confirmed by the FITC-FGF21 tracing test (Fig. 4B and 4C).
These investigations suggested an involvement of caspase 3 in
myocardial injury and a role for FGF21 in suppressing caspase 3
activation.
Cardioprotective action of FGF21. We evaluated the cardioprotective action of FGF21 based on the TUNEL index in wild-type
and FGF212/2 mice at 24 hrs of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
injury. This observation time was chosen because of the presence
of maximal cell death as tested in a previous study24. FGF21
deficiency caused a significant increase in the TUNEL index (291/
24, n 5 8, p , 0.001) compared to the wild-type control (211/23, n
5 8), whereas administration of recombinant FGF21 reduced the
TUNEL index in FGF212/2 mice (171/23, n 5 8, p , 0.001; Fig. 5A
and 5B). These observations suggested that FGF21 contributed to
myocardial protection in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
We further evaluated the short-term (24 hrs) effect of FGF21 on
the degree of myocardial infarction in reference to the area at risk
(Fig. 5C and 5D). At 24 hrs, the fraction of the area at risk for wildtype mice was 61.71/210.7% (n 5 8) in reference to the left ventricular wall volume below the coronary artery ligation and that for
FGF212/2 mice with PBS or recombinant FGF21 administration was
58.41/28.3 and 56.61/27.9%, respectively (n 5 8 for both). No
significant difference was detected between the three groups by oneway ANOVA (p . 0.1), suggesting that a similar area at risk was
established. The fraction of myocardial infarcts by the TTC assay in
reference to the area at risk was 761/213% (n 5 8) in wild-type
mice. This fraction was significantly increased in FGF212/2 mice
(951/211, n 5 8, p , 0.05) compared to that in wild-type mice
(Fig. 5C and 5D). Administration of recombinant FGF21 (50 ng/gm
for each dose, 2 doses per day with a 12 hr interval) reversed the
change due to FGF21 deficiency (671/211%, n 5 8, p , 0.0001).
The long-term cardioprotective effect of FGF21 is sown in Fig. 5E,
5F, and Table 1. FGF212/2 mice exhibited a significant increase in the
fraction of myocardial infarcts compared to wild-type mice at 5, 10,
and 30 days following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Administration of recombinant FGF21 (50 ng/gm for each dose, 2
doses per day with a 12 hr interval for a total period of 3 days) to
FGF212/2 mice caused a significant drop in the fraction of myocardial infarcts compared to PBS administration (Fig. 5E and 5F). These
observations supported the long-term cardioprotective effect of
FGF21 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. This long-term
beneficial effect was probably a result from the acute phase protective
action of FGF21.
Improvement of left ventricular function by FGF21. We evaluated
the influence of FGF21 on the left ventricular (LV) dp/dt and
fractional shortening in wild-type and FGF212/2 mice with
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. While both wild-type and
FGF212/2 mice exhibited a reduction in the LV dp/dt and 2dp/dt
(absolute value) in myocardial injury compared to sham-operated
mice, FGF212/2 mice showed significantly lower levels compared to
wild-type mice (Fig. 6A–C, Table 2). Administration of recombinant
FGF21 significantly improved the LV dp/dt and 2dp/dt (absolute
value) in FGF212/2 mice with myocardial injury in reference to PBS
administration (Fig. 6A–C, Table 2). A similar pattern of change was
observed for the fractional shortening of the ischemic left ventricle.
FGF212/2 mice with PBS administration exhibited a significantly
lower LV fractional shortening compared to wild-type mice
(Fig. 6D and 6E, Table 2). FGF21 administration reversed the

change due to FGF21 deficiency (Fig. 6D and 6E, Table 2). The heart
beating rate, a parameter potentially influencing the LV dp/dt and
fractional shortening, varied between the tested groups, but did not
show a significant difference (p . 0.1, n 5 6, see Table 2). These
observations supported the cardioprotective action of FGF21 in
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Role of FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K, and Akt1 in regulating FGF21-
based myocardial protection. As the aforementioned observations
supported the involvement of FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K, and Akt1 in
FGF21 signaling, we confirmed the role of these molecules in the
regulation of FGF21-based myocardial protection by siRNA
modulation in FGF212/2 mice with administration of recombinant
FGF21 (Fig. 7), a model showing the cardioprotective effect of
FGF21. A FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K p110, Akt1, or control siRNA
was directly injected to the left ventricular anterior wall of
FGF212/2 mice by the 6-injection approach, myocardial ischemia/
reperfusion injury was induced 3 days following siRNA administration, and the fraction of myocardial infarcts was measured and
analyzed at 5 days following myocardial injury. Administration of a
b-Klotho, FGFR1, PI3K p110, or Akt1 siRNA suppressed the relative
expression of the cognate target protein by 731/212, 781/215,
751/216, or 691/211% (n 5 6), respectively, at day 4 after
siRNA administration (or day 1 after myocardial injury that was
induced at day 3 following siRNA administration). Treatment with
a FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K p110, or Akt1 siRNA suppressed the
cardioprotective effect of FGF21 in reference to the control siRNA
treatment (Fig. 7B and 7C). A global ANOVA analysis showed a
significant difference among the groups with control and specific
siRNA treatments (P , 0.005, n 5 7 each group, Fig. 7C). In
terms of individual siRNA treatment, administration of a FGFR1,
PI3K p110, or Akt1 siRNA caused significant intensification of
myocardial infarction. While a b-Klotho siRNA treatment induced
an increase in myocardial infarction, the change did not reach a
statistically significant level based on the conservative P values
from the multiple comparisons test. However, the Student t-test
showed that the change due to a b-Klotho siRNA treatment in
reference to a control siRNA treatment was statistically significant
(P , 0.01). These observations suggest a role for FGFR1, b-Klotho,
PI3K, and Akt1 in mediating FGF21-based myocardial protection.
Discussion
An important discovery from this investigation, along with our
recent studies24, was that myocardial ischemia-induced FGF21 from
the liver and adipose tissue was involved in endocrine myocardial
protection, and prompt administration of this protein significantly
mitigated myocardial infarction. While our recent studies demonstrated the expression of FGF21 in the liver in response to experimental myocardial ischemia and the cardioprotective role of FGF21
during the acute phase of myocardial injury (24 hrs)24, the present
investigation demonstrated FGF21 upregulation in not only the liver,
but also the adipose tissue. This investigation also showed the longterm cardioprotective effect of FGF21 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. FGF21 has been known to regulate glucose and lipid
metabolism30–35. The concept of FGF21 mediation of myocardial
protection is novel.
Several lines of evidence supported the cardioprotective action of
FGF21. First, FGF21 was upregulated in hepatic cells and adipocytes
in response to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Compared to
the sham control level, the transcription of the hepatic FGF21 gene
was increased by about 11 times in myocardial ischemia21, accompanied by protein-level FGF21 upregulation in the hepatocytes and
adipocytes in response to myocardial injury. These changes were
associated with elevation of serum FGF2124, suggesting an endocrine
mechanism for myocardial protection. Second, FGF212/2 mice
exhibited a significant increase in caspase 3 activity, cell death, and
myocardial infarction accompanied by significant deterioration of
the left ventricular function compared to wild-type mice, whereas
administration of recombinant FGF21 reversed the changes due to
FGF21 deficiency. These observations supported the cardioprotective action of FGF21 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. The
potential impact of this investigation is that FGF21 may be considered a therapeutic agent for myocardial protection.
An important concept from this investigation is that myocardial
protection involves endocrine mechanisms. Previous investigations
have demonstrated autocrine/paracrine cardioprotective processes
within the ischemic myocardium, including release of adenosine1,2,
opioids3,4, and bradykinin5,6, upregulation of VEGF7–10, and activation of cardiac resident stem cells11–14. Here, we demonstrated that
the liver and adipose tissue were activated in myocardial ischemia/
reperfusion injury to upregulate and release FGF21 for myocardial
protection. Such an endocrine response is likely established to boost
the protection of the ischemic myocardium, a vital structure with a
limited capacity of protection.
A fundamental question is how FGF21 contributes to myocardial
protection. This investigation demonstrated that FGF21 protected
the ischemic cardiomyocytes via interaction with FGFR1, which
activated the PI3K–Akt1 signaling pathway and induced phosphorylation of the cell death inducer BAD, thereby reducing apoptosis
and supporting cardiomyocyte survival. It has been documented that
the phosphorylation state of BAD determines its activity as a cell
death inducer8,48. When dephosphorylated, BAD promotes cell
apoptosis by sequestering the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and/or
Bcl-XL, rendering the pro-apoptotic factors BAX and BAK more
active48,54,55. BAX and BAK induce pore formation in the mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing cytochrome C to escape from the
mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochrome C binds and activates
apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf1), resulting in activation
of caspase 9. Caspase 9 in turn activates caspase 3, an effector proteinase that degrades proteins and causes apoptosis52,53. When phosphorylated, BAD loses its power for promoting cell apoptosis by
releasing the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which
become active to suppress cell apoptosis48. The present investigation
suggested BAD phosphorylation as a process mediating the cardioprotective action of the FGF21–FGFR1/b-Klotho–PI3K–Akt1 signaling network.
To date, numbers of innate cardioprotective factors have been
identified, including adenosine1,2, opioids3,4, bradykinin5,6, and
VEGF7–10, which are released from injured and activated cardiac cells
in response to myocardial ischemia. An interesting observation is
that most of these factors activate PI3K and Akt1 for myocardial
protection8
. As shown in the present study, PI3K and Akt1 were
also involved in FGF21-mediated myocardial protection. These

investigations suggest PI3K and Akt1 as key molecules converging
signals from various cell survival-supporting ligands to a common
pathway for myocardial protection. The expression of abundant cell
survival ligands is possibly a mechanism evolved to maximize the
cardioprotective action in response to ischemic injury.
In this investigation, we used siRNAs to suppress the expression of
selected signaling molecules in cardiomyocytes by myocardial injection. A technical concern is whether this approach can be used to
establish a sufficiently large siRNA coverage with uniform siRNA
distribution in the ischemic myocardium for effective gene silencing.
We carried out a FITC-siRNA tracing test to address this concern
and demonstrated that a single siRNA injection resulted in a uniform
siRNA coverage about 2 mm in radius and 6 equally spaced injections (,0.5 mm in depth, ,2 mm apart, 2 columns) resulted in a
uniform siRNA coverage about the size of the ischemic myocardium
(,4 mm in radius). These observations were further confirmed by
the Evans blue tracing test. More importantly, the relative expression
of the target proteins was reduced by about 70% in cardiomyocytes at
4 days following siRNA administration. These observations suggest
that direct myocardial siRNA injection is a reliable and effective
method for gene silencing in cardiomyocytes in vivo. Compared to
the transgenic approach, it is easier to silence the expression of a
target gene by the siRNA approach with an acceptable efficacy.
Furthermore, the siRNA approach can be used to modulate multiple
genes simultaneously in a single animal. However, intra-myocardial
administration requires thoracotomy, an approach causing injury to
the animal.
Methods
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We induced myocardial ischemia/
reperfusion injury in FGF212/2 (Taconic Farms) and wild-type mice by 30-min
occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The FGF212/2 model
was generated as described56,57. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ventilated via the trachea by using a
rodent respirator. Intercostal thoracotomy was carried out and the LAD coronary
artery was occluded for 30 min by suture ligation immediately above the second
diagonal branch24. Gender- and body weight-matched mice with sham operation
were used as controls. Experimental observations were carried out at 1, 5, 10, and 30
days or other times, depending on the nature of the test, following myocardial injury
with a sample size of 6–8 mice determined by statistical power analyses.
In randomly selected FGF212/2 mice, recombinant mouse FGF21 was administered intravenously at 50 ng/g of body weight immediately after myocardial injury
followed by additional administrations every 12 hrs for 3 days with PBS as a control.
The 3-day FGF21 administration strategy was based on the observation that cell death
in the ischemic myocardium occurred primarily during the first 3 days24. The effect of
FGF21 administration on myocardial infarction was tested at 1, 5, 10, and 30 days in
reference to that of PBS administration. Experimental procedures were approved by
the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
FGF21 expression in selected organs and cell types. We have shown that hepatic
cells upregulate FGF21 in response to myocardial ischemia24. It is possible that other
cell types also express FGF21 in myocardial ischemia. In this investigation, we tested
FGF21 expression in selected organs and tissues including the brain, ischemic
myocardium, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, small intestine, adipose tissue,
and skeletal muscle at 1 day following myocardial injury, a time with FGF21
upregulation in the liver24. The selected organs were perfused with PBS by arterial
cannulation to remove the circulating blood. FGF21 expression was assessed by
immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses as described58,59. b-actin from the
same protein samples was tested and used as a control. As the liver and adipose tissue
expressed FGF21 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, we further tested FGF21
expression in hepatocytes and adipocytes isolated by collagenase treatment and
centrifugation as described24,60.
Expression and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. As FGF21 potentially
interacts with FGFRs that may activate the PI3K-Akt1 signaling pathway, we tested in
cardiomyocytes the expression and phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3,
FGFR4, PI3K p85, and Akt1, as well as a potential downstream molecule BAD.
Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the left ventricular portion below the second

diagonal bifurcation of healthy, sham-operated, and myocardial ischemic mice by
collagenase treatment (0.25%, perfused through the aorta at 100 mm Hg pressure in a
37uC incubator for 20 min) and centrifugation (25 g for 3 min) as described61. The
isolated cardiomyocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer and used for immunoprecipitation
and immunoblot analyses. Antibodies for FGFRs, phosphotyrosine, PI3K p85,
phospho-PI3K p85 (Tyr458), Akt1, phospho-Akt1 (Ser473), BAD, and phosphoBAD (Ser136) were from Cell Signaling Biotechnology. We also tested b-Klotho
expression in cardiomyocytes by using an anti b-Klotho antibody from R&D Systems.
b-actin from the same protein samples was tested and used as a control.
Evaluation of FGF21 access to ischemic myocardium. This investigation was
designed to assess the cardioprotective action of endogenous endocrine or
intravenously administered FGF21. A critical question is whether FGF21 can access
the ischemic myocardium. We used a FITC-FGF21 tracing method to address this
question. FITC-conjugated recombinant mouse FGF21 (50 ng/g of body weight) was
administered to mice intravenously at 24 hrs following myocardial ischemia/
reperfusion injury. At 1 hr following FITC-FGF21 administration, the vascular
system was perfused with PBS via carotid artery cannulation to remove the circulating
FITC-FGF21 while the vena cava was cut for draining blood. The heart was removed,
cut into 1 mm slices, and used to identify myocardial infarcts by the 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) assay and visualize FITC-FGF21 in the ischemic
myocardium by fluorescence microscopy.
Myocardial administration of siRNA. We used a siRNA gene silencing approach to
evaluate the signaling action of FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K, and Akt1 in cardiomyocytes
in vivo. A FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K p110, Akt1, or control siRNA (5 mg/ml) was
prepared in a transfection medium mixed with a 0.2% liposome transfection reagent
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Thoracotomy was carried out in anesthetized FGF212/2
mice. The siRNA mix was directly injected into the left ventricular anterior wall,
where ischemia/reperfusion injury was to be induced, at 6 equally spaced locations
(10 ml each location, ,0.5 mm in depth, ,2 mm apart, 2 columns) using a Hamilton
micro-syringe. The thoracic wound was closed and the mouse was allowed to recover.
The coverage and distribution of siRNA in the myocardium were tested by using a
FITC-siRNA tracing method. Evans blue was injected to the myocardium to confirm
the tracing test. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced 3 days after
siRNA administration. The effect of siRNA administration on the expression of
FGFR1, b-Klotho, PI3K p110, or Akt1 was tested in cardiomyocytes isolated from the
siRNA-covered area.
Various experimental strategies were used for different molecules. To assess the
influence of FGFR1 gene silencing on signaling events, the expression and phosphorylation of PI3K p85, Akt1, and BAD were tested in cardiomyocytes with FGFR1
or control siRNA administration. To assess the influence of b-Klotho gene silencing
on signaling events, FGF21-FGFR1 interaction as well as FGFR1 expression and
phosphorylation were tested. The degree of myocardial infarction was evaluated
following the administration of each specific siRNA compared to control siRNA
administration.
Caspase 3 activity assay. The relative activity of caspase 3 was measured in sham
control and ischemic cardiomyocytes from wild-type and FGF212/2 mice by using a
caspase 3 colorimetric activity assay kit (Chemicon International). At 24 hrs
following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury or sham operation,
cardiomyocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment and centrifugation. The
relative activity of caspase 3 in sham control and ischemic cardiomyocytes was
measured and analyzed as described62. The observation time 24 hrs was chosen
because maximal cell death was found at this time24.
Assessment of cell death. The TUNEL assay was used to assess cell death in the sham
control and ischemic myocardium. At 24 hrs following myocardial ischemia/
reperfusion injury or sham operation, the heart of an anesthetized mouse was fixed by
arterial perfusion of 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The observation time 24 hrs was
chosen because maximal cell death was found at this time24. Specimens were collected
from the sham control and ischemic myocardium, and cut into 10 mm cryo-sections.
At least 6 specimen sections, equally spaced through an ischemic or sham control
region, were collected from each mouse for measurement. The TUNEL test was
carried out as described24 and Hoechst 33258 was used for detecting cell nuclei.
TUNEL-positive cell nuclei were measured from 6 randomly selected regions of each
specimen section. A TUNEL index was calculated as the percentage of the TUNELpositive cell nuclei in reference to Hoechst 33258-labeled total cell nuclei.
Measurement of myocardial infarcts. We measured the area at risk and fraction of
myocardial infarcts at 24 hrs by the Evans blue and TTC assay63, respectively, as well
as the fraction of myocardial infarcts at 5, 10, and 30 days by the AZAN assay24. For
the Evans blue and TTC assay, a mouse with 24-hr myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
injury was anesthetized and ventilated, the heart was exposed by thoracotomy, the
LAD coronary artery was re-ligated at the original ligation location, Evans blue (2% in
PBS, 10 ml/g of body weight) was rapidly injected into the left ventricle, and the heart
was removed at approximately 5 sec following Evans blue injection. The heart was cut
into ,1 mm serial transverse sections. The sections were photographed for
measurement of the area at risk, incubated in 1% TTC/PBS at 37uC for 30 min, fixed
in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, and photographed for measurement of
myocardial infarcts. The fraction of myocardial infarcts was calculated in reference to
the area at risk.
For the AZAN assay, the mouse heart was fixed by arterial perfusion of 4%
formaldehyde/PBS at 100 mm Hg pressure at 5, 10, and 30 days following myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury and cut into 50 mm serial transverse cryo-sections. One
of every five specimen sections was collected from the left ventricle (LV) and stained
with AZAN reagents. The areas of infarcts/fibrosis (blue in color) and intact myocardium (red) were measured from each section. The volumes of the infarcts/fibrosis
and the intact LV myocardium were calculated based on the measured areas and
specimen thickness. The fraction of myocardial infarcts/fibrosis was calculated in
reference to the LV wall volume below the coronary artery occlusion.
Left ventricular fractional shortening by echocardiography. We measured the
fractional shortening of the left ventricle by echocardiography24. Mice were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg body weight
at concentration of 1.25%). The systolic and diastolic LV diameters were measured at
the middle point of the left ventricle by using a SonoScape ultrasound system with a
high-resolution matrix probe. The location of the measurement was identified by B
mode echocardiography. The fractional shortening of the left ventricle was calculated
as [(diastolic diameter – systolic diameter)/diastolic diameter] 3 10024.
Left ventricular dp/dt and 2dp/dt. We tested the left ventricular dp/dt and 2dp/dt
based on blood pressure measurements. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg body weight at concentration of 1.25%). A
Millar catheter pressure transducer was inserted into the left ventricle via the right
carotid artery. The left ventricular pressure was measured and used to generate dp/dt
and 2dp/dt from mice with sham operation and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
injury24.
Statistics. Means and standard deviations were calculated for all measured
parameters. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method for global
comparisons among multiple groups. One-way ANOVA was used for analyses
involving a single factor such as time, whereas two-way ANOVA was used for
analyses involving two factors such as a treatment and time. Post-hoc pairwise
multiple comparisons were carried out by the Tukey, Bonferroni, Scheffe´, and Fisher’s
least significant difference methods. The most conservative method was selected and
used for difference evaluation. Sample sizes were estimated by power analysis. A
difference was considered statistically significant at p , 0.05.
