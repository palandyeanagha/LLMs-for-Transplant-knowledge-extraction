Abstract
Background: Immune-related enterocolitis (irEC) is the most common serious complication from checkpoint inhibitors
(CPIs). The current front-line treatment for irEC, high-dose corticosteroids (CS), have significant side effects and prolonged
therapy may reduce CPI-anti-tumor activity. Early addition of TNF-α inhibitors such as infliximab (IFX) may
expedite symptom resolution and shorten CS duration. Thus, we conducted the first retrospective study, to our knowledge,
evaluating symptom resolution in patients with irEC treated with and without IFX.
Methods: Data were collected from the medical records of patients diagnosed with irEC. The primary endpoint was time
to symptom resolution for irEC for cases managed with IFX plus CS (IFX group) versus CS alone (CS group). Duration of CS,
overall survival (OS), and time to treatment failure (TTF) were secondary endpoints.
Results: Among 75 patients with irEC, 52% received CS alone, and 48% received IFX. Despite higher grade colitis in the IFX
group (grade 3/4: 86% vs. 34%; p < 0.001), median times to diarrhea resolution (3 vs. 9 days; p < 0.001) and to steroid
titration (4 vs. 13 days; p < 0.001) were shorter in the IFX group than in the CS group without a negative impact on TTF
or OS. Total steroid duration (median 35 vs. 51 days; p = 0.150) was numerically lower in the IFX group.
Conclusions: Despite higher incidence of grade 3/4 colitis, IFX added to CS for the treatment of patients with irEC was
associated with a significantly shorter time to symptom resolution. The data suggest that early introduction of IFX should
be considered for patients with irEC until definitive prospective clinical trials are conducted.

Background
Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have improved overall survival
(OS) for patients with various malignancies [1–5]. Currently available CPIs target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (anti–CTLA-4 agents include ipilimumab and
tremelimumab), programmed death 1 (anti–PD-1 agents
include pembrolizumab and nivolumab), and programmed
death ligand 1 (anti–PD-L1 agents include atezolizumab,
avelumab, and durvalumab). Newer agents continue
to emerge, expanding the therapeutic applications of
CPIs in cancer management. However, CPIs can cause
severe immune-related adverse events, among which
immune-related enterocolitis (irEC) is the most common serious complication [6].
IrEC extensively affects the gastrointestinal tract. If
irEC is not treated promptly, it can lead to bowel perforation, sepsis, and death [7]. Although toxicity management algorithms have been shown to reduce the incidence

of serious gastrointestinal complications from irEC [8],
the rate of mortality due to irEC remains near 1% [7, 9].
Despite the expanding role of CPIs in cancer therapy and
the frequency of CPI-related adverse events, there remains
a paucity of data regarding the optimal management of
these immune related adverse events.
The recommended front-line treatment for irEC is
high-dose corticosteroids (CS) (methylprednisolone at
1–2 mg/kg or its equivalent) [6, 7, 10–12]. Protracted
high-dose CS may precipitate serious complications, e.g.,
hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, muscle atrophy, opportunistic infection, and death [13]. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNFα), a critical co-factor for mucosal Th1 cytokine
production, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of
mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease
[14, 15]. TNFα-blocking agents, including infliximab
(IFX), have revolutionized the treatment of moderate to
severe inflammatory bowel disease and have been reported
to induce rapid symptom resolution and to facilitate steroid
tapering even in CS-refractory irEC cases [16]. The early
addition of IFX in irEC management may promptly reverse
gastrointestinal symptoms, avoid perforation or death, and
spare patients the toxicities of prolonged steroid exposure.
Thus, we conducted a retrospective study to compare the
efficacy of IFX plus CS with that of CS alone for the management of irEC.
Methods
Study design
Adult cancer patients treated with CPIs (ipilimumab,
tremelimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab,
or ipilimumab-nivolumab in combination) between January
1, 2012, and June 30, 2017, were identified by review of the
institutional pharmacy database at MD Anderson Cancer
Center. Included in our analysis were patients for whom
there was adequate documentation of the timing of our
primary endpoints in the medical records. Patients who received IFX and CS (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone,
and prednisone) as well as those who received CS alone
were identified. Their records were then reviewed to identify the indication for those treatments, and patients who
received IFX and/or CS for a reason other than irEC were
excluded from further analysis. All treatments for irEC
were per the treating oncologist’s discretion. Baseline
characteristics at the time of irEC diagnosis, including
age, sex, co-morbidities, cancer type, and CPI regimen,
were collected. Stool studies for infectious cause, endoscopic and radiographic evaluations, immunosuppressant
regimens, CS duration, number of IFX doses, and treatment side effects were documented.
In this study, irEC was defined as diarrhea requiring
immunosuppressants in the setting of CPI therapy and
was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 based
solely on diarrhea. CTCAE classify and grade diarrhea
and colitis as two separate entities. In the setting of CPI
therapy, diarrhea is a widely accepted surrogate for irEC
and is treated as presumed irEC [8]. We graded irEC solely
on the basis of diarrhea because other irEC-associated signs
and symptoms, such as abdominal pain and presence of
mucus or blood in stool, were not as consistently documented in patients’ charts as was frequency of loose stools.
The primary endpoint, time to symptom resolution,
was defined in two ways: the time from initiation of IFX
and/or CS to either (i) complete resolution of diarrhea
(absence of diarrhea) or (ii) initiation of steroid titration
due to improvement of irEC symptoms as indicated by
documentation in the electronic medical record. Although
the timing of initiation of steroid titration depends on the
physician’s discretion, we considered this co–primary endpoint another surrogate for resolution of colitis symptoms.
Among the secondary endpoints was CS treatment duration, defined as the time from initiation of IFX and/or CS
to the last dose of CS.
To assess the relative impact of these immunosuppressive therapies on CPI clinical activity, we evaluated OS
and time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the time
from the initiation of CPI to oncologic therapy change
due to disease progression among patients with stage IV
melanoma only.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were reported as percentages for
categorical variables and as medians for continuous variables. Categorical and continuous variables were compared
between groups by Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis
test, respectively. The log-rank and Renyi tests were used to
compare survival curves between treatment groups. Forest
plots based on results from gamma generalized linear
models (with log link function) were used to display treatment differences regarding the time to diarrhea resolution
and time to steroid titration within subgroups of given variables. For each subgroup, the treatment multiplicative effect
and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Safety
assessments were descriptive in nature. Statistical analyses
were performed using R version 3.3.1. All statistical tests
used a significance level of 5%. No adjustments were made
for multiple testing.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 75 patients with irEC were included in the
study (Fig. 1). Of these, 36 were treated with IFX plus
CS (IFX group), and 39 received CS only (CS group).
The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The median age at the development of irEC was 63 years
in patients treated with CS alone and 61 years in patients treated with IFX plus CS. Most patients were male
Johnson et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (2018) 6:103 Page 2 of 8

(67%) and had a diagnosis of melanoma (71%). The baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the
IFX and the CS groups; however, there were significantly
more men in the IFX group than in the CS group.
The clinical characteristics of the irEC cases are presented in Table 1. CPIs utilized were similar between the
two groups; ipilimumab was the most commonly used
agent. Other than diarrhea, the most frequent presenting
symptoms were abdominal cramps (43%), bloody stools
(29%), and nausea (28%). Stool studies were performed
in 60 patients. Clostridium difficile infection was found
in three patients in each group. Endoscopic evaluation
was performed in 42 (56%) patients, and biopsy-proven
colitis was found in 37 (49%). In the 5 patients who
underwent endoscopy without a tissue diagnosis of
colitis, there was either clinically evident colitis on endoscopy or reports were unavailable. Pathology findings
consistent with colitis were seen in 20 (56%) patients in
the IFX group and 17 (44%) patients in the CS group.
Computerized tomography was performed in 42 (56%)
patients, and wall thickening was present in 21 (28%). In
the IFX group, one to three doses of IFX were administered; 26 (72%) patients had one dose, eight (22%) patients had two doses, and two (6%) patients had three
doses. IFX was administered within a median of 8 days
after CS initiation. Every patient had CPI therapy discontinued at the time of diagnosis of irEC. There were 18
patients re-challenged within 6 months of completing
steroids and/or infliximab, 12 patients (33%) in the IFX
group and 6 patients (15%) in the CS group.

At the onset of irEC, grade 3/4 colitis was documented
with numerically higher frequency in the IFX group
(61%) than in the CS group (34%) (p = 0.077). Initial CS
therapy alone did not seem to impact the severity of
irEC in the IFX group. In fact, the grade of colitis significantly worsened from the onset of diarrhea to the time
of IFX administration; grade 3/4 colitis was seen in 86%
of the IFX group (by the time of IFX initiation) but only
34% of the CS group (p < 0.001) (Table 2).
Efficacy
Among the 75 patients included in the study, 68 patients
had documentation of the timing of diarrhea resolution;
73 patients had documentation of the timing of steroid
titration initiation. All of these 73 patients had documentation in the EMR that the reason for initiation of steroid
titration was improvement in irEC symptoms. The IFX
group had significantly shorter times to diarrhea resolution (median 3 days vs. 9 days; p < 0.001) and to steroid
titration (median 4 days vs. 13 days; p < 0.001) compared
with the CS group (Fig. 2). The IFX group also had numerically shorter CS duration (median 35 days vs. 51 days;
p = 0.150) than did the CS group (Fig. 3).
Shorter time to diarrhea resolution in the IFX group
than the CS group was also observed in all clinically
relevant subgroups, where patients were stratified by
colitis grade, patient age, CPI regimen, and presence of
colonic wall thickening on radiographic imaging (Fig. 4).
Bowel perforation occurred in one patient in the IFX
group; the perforation occurred within 24 h of IFX initiation and hence was more likely due to inadequate or
unsuccessful rescue therapy than to IFX therapy.
TTF and OS analyses were carried out for 40 patients
with stage IV melanoma, of whom 18 and 22 patients
were treated in the IFX and CS groups, respectively. At
a median follow-up duration of 26.0 months, the median
TTF was 9.0 months (95% CI 5.6 months–not reached)
in the IFX group and 12.5 months (95% CI 5.8 months–
not reached) in the CS group (Additional file 1). Median
OS was not reached in either group (Fig. 5). The differences in TTF and OS between the two treatment groups
were not statistically significant.
Safety
There were no statistically significant differences in the
rates of CS-related side-effects between the IFX group
(61%) and the CS group (46%; p = 0.249) (Additional file 1).
The most common adverse events associated with CS
use included hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, and edema.
Additional infectious complications occurred in two

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first retrospective
case series to compare the efficacy of IFX plus CS and that
of CS alone in patients with irEC. Our study demonstrates
that patients treated in the IFX group had a statistically
significantly shorter time to symptom resolution than did
those in the CS group. In the IFX group, median times to
diarrhea resolution and to steroid titration were 3 days
and 4 days, respectively, in contrast to 9 days and 13 days,
respectively, in patients who received CS alone. Intriguingly, we report a faster time to symptom resolution
with the addition of IFX despite more severe irEC in
the IFX group. Faster symptom resolution reflects rapid
reversal of colonic tissue inflammation that could otherwise
deteriorate into perforation and even death without effective management. Prompt symptom resolution may profoundly improve patients’ quality of life, shorten time of
hospitalization, and decrease healthcare costs. Furthermore,
there were a higher proportion of patients with grade 3/4
colitis at the time of IFX administration than at the time of
symptom onset. This signifies multiple patients in the IFX
group with grade 1 or 2 irEC at diagnosis had deteriorated
to grade 3/4 while on CS alone, suggesting that the CS
given prior to IFX initiation was not having a beneficial
impact on symptom resolution. For this reason, we used
initiation of IFX as the starting time-point for the primary
endpoints. A history of grade 3/4 immune-related adverse
events is a common exclusion criterion for many immunotherapy trials, directly limiting a patient’s treatment options.
We believe that aggressive, upfront treatment of irEC before symptoms progress is clinically relevant and important
for patient outcomes.
Diarrhea and colitis are more frequent and severe with
anti-CTLA4 agents (all grades: 30%; grade 3–4: 10–16%)
than with agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis (all
grades: 11–16%; grade 3–4: 1–2%) [6, 7, 10, 11]. In particular, these agents in combination have higher rates of
immune related adverse events with diarrhea being most
common (all grades: 45%; grade 3–4 11%) [17]. The
majority of patients reported here (57–86%) received ipilimumab as monotherapy or in combination with a PD-1
inhibitor. Although the use of ipilimumab monotherapy
front-line for metastatic melanoma (MM) or in the adjuvant setting for resected Stage III melanoma has been
largely replaced by PD-1 inhibitors, we feel that CTLA-4
inhibitors, particularly in combination with PD-1 blockade,
will continue to be widely used in multiple cancer types.
Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab is approved for
front-line MM, and after progression on PD-1 inhibitors,
ipilimumab continues to be the standard second line immunotherapy. In Checkmate-214, a phase III, randomized
study evaluating the combination of nivolumab and

ipilimumab vs. sunitinib in patients with treatment-naïve,
intermediate or poor risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
there was a significant improvement in OS and response
rate [18]. Results from Checkmate-227, a phase III study
evaluating the same regimen as first line for advanced
non-small cell lung cancer patients with a high tumor mutational burden, demonstrated a significantly improved progression free survival compared to standard of care
chemotherapy [19]. With approval of ipilimumab with
nivolumab for front-line treatment in melanoma and renal
cell carcinoma and likely approval for high mutational load
non-small cell lung cancer, we believe that optimization of
management for anti-CTLA-4 induced colitis will continue
to be relevant.
In this study, IFX use was associated with a numerically
shorter median duration of steroid exposure (35 days vs.
51 days; p = 0.150) without a negative impact on TTF or
OS in the patients with metastatic melanoma. Most patients only required one dose of IFX (72%) to achieve
symptom resolution. The recommended front-line treatment for grade 3/4 irEC is high-dose CS [6, 10]. Many
patients require prolonged CS exposure, and some cases

can even be refractory to CS. Thus, inflammatory cytokine
blockade such as IFX may be not only an important
treatment for steroid-refractory irEC but also potentially an
effective steroid-sparing strategy to reduce serious CS-related complications. We previously reported a patient who
developed atrial fibrillation secondary to prolonged CS use
for severe ipilimumab-related rheumatoid arthritis. The
CS were discontinued, and the patient was started on
tocilizumab (an anti–interleukin-6R monoclonal antibody). The arthritis resolved, and the patient’s metastatic melanoma was in durable remission at last
follow-up [20].
It has been suggested that immunosuppressive therapy for immune-related adverse events in patients with
advanced melanoma receiving CPIs do not affect TTF
or OS [21]. However, these findings may have been confounded by higher response rates in patients experiencing
immune-related adverse events [22, 23]. We believe that
significantly prolonged steroid exposure, especially when
coupled with CPI suspension, may negatively impact the
clinical benefit of immunotherapy. We realize that without
a prospective, pre-planned CS titration protocol, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these data about
the efficacy of IFX as a steroid-sparing treatment. However, the numerically shorter CS duration that we observed in the IFX group is an encouraging finding with
potential clinical implications.
Our results demonstrate that adding IFX, at limited
doses, to CS for irEC treatment had no significant effect
on OS or TTF in patients with stage IV melanoma. Our
cohort of patients with irEC received immunotherapies
for a variety of cancer types at different stages (Table 1),
which would confound the analysis of the effect of systemic immunosuppression on CPI therapeutic benefit.
For this reason we chose to include only patients with
stage IV melanoma in our OS and TTF analysis. The resulting limited sample size along with high censoring due to
short follow-up (median follow-up of 26 months) were
major limitations to this analysis. TTF has been used as a
surrogate endpoint for progression-free survival [21]; however, this endpoint could be confounded by multiple factors
in a retrospective analysis. For example, the initiation of the
next line of cancer-directed therapy, in particular immunotherapy, may have been delayed by unresolved irEC and
ongoing CS treatment. To that point, the faster time to
irEC symptom resolution and shorter CS duration we saw
in association with IFX could result in earlier initiation of
the next line of therapy.
TNFα is an inflammatory cytokine that plays contrasting
roles in immunology. In rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, TNFα blockade can successfully lead to
clinically beneficial immune suppression. However, in other
autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and lupus
nephritis, TNFα deficiency or blockade can exacerbate
inflammation and precipitate disease flare [24, 25]. Similarly, in tumor immunology, TNFα can mediate opposing
effects. While TNFα has traditionally been known as a
stimulatory cytokine that is important for the cytotoxic effector T cell response, a growing body of evidence has described its role in promoting immune suppression by
facilitating the proliferation and function of regulatory immune cells (T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells) [26, 27]. These immunosuppressive features
of TNFα were associated with chronic and prolonged exposure to the cytokine [27] In a recent preclinical study,
TNFα blockade was shown to significantly enhance tumor
immunity and overcome resistance to anti–PD-1 and adoptive T cell therapy [28]. Our data demonstrate that
short-term IFX use (1–3 doses) did not compromise OS
and clinical benefit from CPIs. Interestingly, there is a phase
Ib clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of
anti-TNFα given concomitantly with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma
(NCT03293784).
Conclusion
Although this is a retrospective, single-institution experience, our study provides much-needed data supporting the
early use of IFX to hasten irEC symptom resolution,
particularly in patients with high-grade colitis. The recent termination of the only prospective trial evaluating
IFX plus CS versus CS alone for irEC (NCT02763761)
due to insufficient enrollment further highlights the relevance of these data. It is important to identify more targeted approaches to treat irEC that mechanistically do not
inhibit the anti-tumor immune response. However, until
newer approaches for irEC are available, we recommend
the early addition of IFX for irEC.
