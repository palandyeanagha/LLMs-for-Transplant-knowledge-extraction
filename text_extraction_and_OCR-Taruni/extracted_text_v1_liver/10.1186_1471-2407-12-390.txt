Abstract
Background: In patients with cancers of the pancreatic and biliary tract quality of life (QOL) improvement is the
main treatment goal, since survival can be prolonged only marginally. Up to date, knowledge on QOL impairments
throughout the entire treatment process, often including several chemotherapy lines, is scarce. Our study aimed at
investigating QOL trajectories from adjuvant treatment to palliative 3rd-line therapy
Methods: Patients were included in routine electronic patient-reported outcome monitoring at Kufstein County
Hospital at the time of diagnosis and assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 during each chemotherapy cycle.
Results: Eighty out of 147 patients with pancreatic cancer or cancer of the bile ducts treated at the Kufstein County
Hospital, fulfilled inclusion criteria and could be included in the study (mean age 67.4 years; 53.8% women).
Physical, Emotional and Cognitive Functioning, and Global QOL deteriorated across chemotherapy lines, whereas
Fatigue, Pain, Dyspnoea, Sleeping Disturbances, Diarrhoea, and Taste Alterations increased. With regard to Physical
Functioning, Global QOL, Fatigue, Dyspnoea, Diarrhoea and Taste Alterations, the patients receiving adjuvant or 1st
-
line palliative chemotherapy did not differ significantly. Most patients in 2nd- or 3rd-line chemotherapy showed
significantly higher impairments and symptom burden. However, patients under 1st and 2nd-line treatment showed
stable QOL trajectories, whereas 3rd-line patients perceived substantial deteriorations.
Conclusions: The results suggest early palliative treatment initiation to stabilise QOL on a level as high as possible.
The continuous QOL improvement during adjuvant treatment, probably reflecting post-operative recovery, may
indicate that deleterious effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on QOL are highly unlikely.

Background
Despite advances in palliative treatment, locally advanced
and metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas and bile ducts
are still associated with an extremely poor prognosis.
As chemotherapy results in only a marginal prolongation of survival, quality of life (QOL) improvement is
usually referred to as the main treatment goal [1-3].
For patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, different
1st-line treatments can be chosen according to
performance status, age, co-morbidities and the patient´s
preference (Gemcitabine, Gemcitabine/Erlotinib, FOLFIRINOX) [2,4,5]. However, none of the combination
therapies thus far have been superior to Gemcitabine
monotherapy in improving QOL [6-10]. For patients with
cancers of the biliary tract and gall bladder who receive
palliative chemotherapy, a combination of Gemcitabine
and Cisplatin has been widely accepted as a standard 1stline treatment [11].
In the 2nd-line setting, the combination of 5-FU/
Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin (OFF) has shown a survival benefit
in a phase III randomised trial [12]. Therefore, in clinical
practice, many patients currently receive more than one

line of treatment. This is also true for patients with bile
duct tumours, although the evidence for 2nd-line treatment
from clinical trials is less robust [13].
Almost all studies on QOL and the clinical benefit
rate, however, refer to 1st-line therapy. Knowledge of the
longitudinal course of QOL across the different treatment lines is almost completely lacking, even though
such information might be important for medical decision making and patient information [14-16]. Furthermore,
although adjuvant chemotherapy with Gemcitabine
has now become an accepted treatment standard
after surgical resection for early pancreatic cancer,
there is minimal information on the impact of this
treatment on QOL [17].
As with other tumours, patient-reported outcomes
(PRO) provide useful prognostic information in patients
with pancreatic cancer and cancer of the biliary tract
[3,18]. Thus, the objective of our study was to analyse and
compare patient-reported QOL and physical/psychosocial
symptom burden, measured by repeated computerassisted completion of validated questionnaires in
patients with pancreatic cancer and cancer of the
bile ducts, from adjuvant treatment to palliative 3rdline therapy.
Methods
Sample
Patients were included in routine electronic PRO monitoring at the Department of Internal Medicine of the
Kufstein County Hospital at the time of diagnosis and
assessed, when possible, during each chemotherapy
cycle. The inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of
pancreatic cancer or cancer of the bile ducts, no severe
cognitive impairments, and the ability to speak German.
The data collection was performed by a study nurse
who approached the patient to obtain informed consent
and administer the PRO questionnaire. The patients
entered the data themselves on a tablet-PC that presented the QLQ-C30 questionnaire while the study
nurse was available for any help required. We used the
Computer-based Health Evaluation System (CHES)[19]
to record electronic PRO data.
Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected
from the hospital records and entered in the CHES database to match PRO data. The study was approved by the
ethics committee of Innsbruck Medical University.
PRO Assessment - EORTC QLQ-C30
The EORTC QLQ-C30 [20] is an internationally validated and widely used questionnaire to assess QOL, psychosocial burden and physical symptoms in cancer
patients. It consists of five functioning scales (Physical,
Social, Role, Cognitive, and Emotional functioning), a
scale for Global QOL, and nine symptom scales (Fatigue,
Pain, Nausea/Vomiting, Dyspnoea, Appetite Loss, Sleep
Disturbance, Constipation, Diarrhoea and Financial
Difficulties).
Two additional items asking for taste alterations were
taken from the EORTC Quality of Life Group item bank
(“Have you had problems with your sense of taste?” and
“Did food and drink taste different from usual?”). These
items were summed to the taste alteration score, which
has already been used in previous studies [21,22]. The
score ranges from 0 to 100 points, with higher values indicating more severe taste alterations.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics are presented as means, standard
deviations, and percentages. Group comparisons of patient baseline characteristics were performed with Chi2
tests and T-tests for independent samples, to investigate
whether chemotherapy line comparisons should be
adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and type of cancer
(gall bladder and pancreatic). We did not consider
adjusting for variables such as time since diagnosis, previous surgery, occurrence of metastasis, or chemotherapy
regimen, as these variables reflect genuine characteristics of
the chemotherapy line.
To compare the symptom burden and functioning between patients in different chemotherapy lines, we used
mixed linear models, including the following terms: a
random baseline, a first-order autocorrelation covariance
matrix, and a main effect patient group (chemotherapy
line). A major advantage of mixed linear models is that
they allow for data modelling with a varying number of
assessments per patient. Additionally, these models
allow time-varying co-variates, such as chemotherapy
line.
In a secondary analysis, we investigated the symptom
burden and functioning trajectories within chemotherapy lines using the time since the start of the chemotherapy line as the main effect in separate mixed linear
models. Additionally, we compared patients during the
1st and 2nd-line palliative chemotherapy with regard to
changes in symptom burden and functioning, between
the start of the chemotherapy line and the time points
of tumour staging (6–8 weeks and 12–16 weeks after the
start of chemotherapy, respectively). For this analysis, we
dichotomised patients into non-responders (progressive
disease) and responders (stable disease or remission).
As a measure of changes in symptom burden or functioning, we provide monthly change rates for the
EORTC QLQ-C30 scales, i.e., change in score points per
30 days. For ease of interpretation, these numbers
should be related to the thresholds for minimal important change. According to Osoba et al. [23], for the QLQC30, a change of 5–10 score points indicates a small

clinical change, while 10–20 indicates a moderate
change, and above 20 points is a large change.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0.
Results
Patient characteristics
Between May 2005 and September 2011, 147 patients
with pancreatic cancer or cancer of the bile ducts were
treated at the Kufstein County Hospital (110 patients
with pancreatic cancer and 37 patients with cancer of
the bile ducts, which includes patients with cancer of
the gall bladder). Eighty of these patients could be
included in ePROM, with a total number of PROassessments of 771 (on average 9 assessments per patient, SD 7.4), i.e., an inclusion rate of 54.4%.
The reasons for not including a patient were as follows: treatment with surgery only, rejection of chemotherapy by the patient, reduced performance status and,
in a few cases, rejection of PRO assessment by the patient or basic language problems.
The mean age at baseline was 67.4 years (SD 9.6), with
53.8% of the patients being female. Of the total number
of patients, 72.5% (n = 58) were suffering from pancreatic
cancer and 27.5% (n = 22) from cancer of the bile ducts,
including a few patients with cancer of the gall bladder.
At the time of study inclusion, 29.1% of the patients
received adjuvant chemotherapy, 68.4% received 1st-line
palliative chemotherapy, and 2.5% received 2nd-line
chemotherapy (for these few patients, no 1st-line PRO
data were available).
In Table 1, patient characteristics are given separately
for patients receiving different chemotherapy lines. During the study period, 58.2% of the patients received one
chemotherapy line, 25.3% received two chemotherapy
lines, and 16.5% received three or four chemotherapy
lines.
In the adjuvant setting, almost all patients with pancreatic cancer received Gemcitabine monotherapy. Only
in rare cases of intolerance to Gemcitabine was 5-FUbased chemotherapy applied.
Palliative 1st-line therapy consisted of Gemcitabine
monotherapy (40.6%) and Gemcitabine-based doublets
(45.3%; Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin and, occasionally, Cisplatin). FOLFIRINOX was only recently introduced as a
palliative 1st-line treatment option; therefore, only a few
patients were treated with this regimen.
As 2nd-line therapies, patients usually received FOLFOX (55.2%) or a Gemcitabine-based doublet (27.6%).
Only a few patients were treated with FOLFIRI, Docetaxel or Gemcitabine combinations in the 3rd-line
setting.
Within the study period, 16.5% of the patients passed
from adjuvant to palliative chemotherapy, 26.5% passed
from 1st- to 2nd-line palliative chemotherapy and 10%
passed from 2nd- to 3rd+-line palliative chemotherapy,
for further details see Figure 1.
Differences in symptom burden between chemotherapy
lines
To investigate the differences between the chemotherapy
lines with regard to patient-reported physical and psychosocial symptom burden, we compared patients during
adjuvant chemotherapy, 1st-line palliative chemotherapy,
2nd-line palliative chemotherapy, and 3rd-line palliative
chemotherapy or beyond. As expected, we found a significant association between chemotherapy line and Physical,
Emotional and Cognitive Functioning, Global QOL, Fatigue, Pain, Dyspnoea, Sleeping Disturbances, Diarrhoea,
and Taste Alterations with worse outcomes in later treatment lines. Role and Social Functioning, Nausea/Vomiting,
Appetite Loss, Constipation and Financial Impact could
not be related to chemotherapy lines.
For pairwise comparisons, we provide point differences for the smallest and the largest significant difference. Using pairwise comparisons, we found that, with
regard to Physical Functioning, Global QOL, Fatigue,
Dyspnoea, Diarrhoea and Taste Alterations, the patients
receiving adjuvant or 1st-line palliative chemotherapy did
not differ significantly. However, most patients in 2nd- or
3rd-line chemotherapy showed significantly higher
impairments and symptom burden.
With regard to Emotional and Cognitive Functioning,
Pain, and Sleeping Disturbances, the patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy were less affected than
patients receiving any line of palliative chemotherapy.
Due to the limited number of patients with third- or
later-line chemotherapy, pairwise comparisons for this
patient group had only limited statistical power. Therefore, certain absolute differences emerged as statistically
non-significant, even though they were rather large. For
further details see Table 2, Figure 1: Patient flow concerning chemotherapy lines, Figure 2, and Figure 3.
Symptom trajectories within chemotherapy lines
In a secondary analysis, we investigated the physical and
psychosocial symptom trajectories (i.e., change rates)
within chemotherapy lines. During adjuvant chemotherapy, a significant improvement was found for Physical
Functioning (+3.3 score points per month), Role Functioning (+6.8), Emotional Functioning (+1.8), Global
QOL (+4.1), Fatigue (−3.4) and Pain (−2.4).
During 1st- and 2nd-line palliative chemotherapy,
symptom burdens remained stable, with the exception of
Taste Alterations, which increased by +1.8 points per
month during 1st-line chemotherapy, and Cognitive
Functioning, which deteriorated by −1.2 points per
month during 2nd-line chemotherapy.

During 3rd-line or higher palliative chemotherapy, the
following symptoms and functioning aspects deteriorated significantly: Physical Functioning (−3.0), Role
Functioning (−3.2), Social Functioning (−2.1), Emotional
Functioning (−2.1), Global QOL (−1.6), Fatigue (+3.3),
Dyspnoea (+4.6), Sleeping Disturbances (+3.0), and Financial Impact of Disease (+2.4). Further details are
given in table 3.
An additional analysis of patients during 1st and 2ndline palliative chemotherapy showed statistically significant differences with regard to symptom and functioning
trajectories (i.e., differences in monthly change rates),
according to the chemotherapy response with regard to the
following scales: Physical Functioning (responders +0.9
points per month vs. non-responders −5.3 points per
month), Role Functioning (+1.9 vs. -10.4), Global QOL
(+1.6 vs. -4.7), Fatigue (−1.8 vs. +5.7 points).
Discussion
Since the publication of the study by Glimelius et al.,
palliative chemotherapy, when compared with the best
supportive care alone, is usually considered to improve
the QOL and survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and cancer of the bile ducts, respectively
[1]. In a consecutive trial reported by Burris et al., Gemcitabine monotherapy appeared to be superior to 5-FU
in terms of the clinical benefit rate and survival and
therefore established a new standard of care for
advanced pancreatic cancer [2]. A large number of trials
evaluating Gemcitabine-based combinations produced
negative results or only marginal improvement concerning survival, and the data on the improvement of QOL
were controversial [7-9,24].
Thus far, QOL assessment has focused on palliative
1st-line treatment, but there is still a paucity of data on
the degree of improvement in QOL that can be achieved
by chemotherapy [14,16]. In addition, there is a large uncertainty on the differences concerning the QOL aspects
of patients in different treatment lines and on the QOL
effects of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with
curative intent.
Frequent, computer-assisted assessments of the
EORTC-QLQ-C30 during adjuvant and palliative treatment in daily clinical practice, as presented in our analysis, may shed light on some of these questions.
Most importantly, and in accordance with other studies, our data indicate that patients under 1st-line palliative chemotherapy experience a stabilisation of physical
and psychosocial symptoms and global QOL, rather than
a real measurable improvement. These data, which suggest QOL stabilisation, are in line with the results
reported by Romanus et al., who treated patients with
Gemcitabine or Gemcitabine/Bevacizumab [6]. As in our
analysis, these treatments resulted in a modest improvement in pain and mood and a slight slowing of functional deterioration but no significant improvement of
global QOL. Furthermore, the most effective chemotherapy protocol, FOLFIRINOX, has also been shown to

only slow the deterioration of QOL instead of significantly improving it, despite prolonging survival [4].
In an exploratory analysis with limited statistical
power, we attempted to correlate the chemotherapy response, defined as disease stabilisation on CT-scans at
6–8 weeks after the start of chemotherapy, with QOL
data. Our data indicate the importance of achieving disease-stabilisation, at the least, as these patients also seem
to accomplish significant gains in important aspects of
QOL.
Only recently, based on a small phase III trial, palliative chemotherapy with 5-FU/Folinic Acid/Oxaliplatin
(OFF) has become the standard of care in the 2nd-line
setting [12]. The QOL data were not reported in this
trial. A number of phase II studies have also reported a
measurable effect of 2nd-line chemotherapy [16,25].
However, due to infrequent assessments and the associated low compliance, QOL data have rarely been
reported. As in the 1st-line palliative setting, the QOL
trajectories shown by 2nd-line palliative chemotherapy
patients indicate a stabilisation, rather than an improvement, of physical and psychosocial symptoms and global
QOL.
These results are of clinical importance because they
indicate a comparable effect of palliative chemotherapy
on many of the aspects of QOL under 1st- and 2nd-line
palliative chemotherapy in terms of constant QOL data
during treatment. When stabilisation, but not a significant improvement of QOL, is obtainable with palliative
chemotherapy, treatment should be initiated as soon as
possible, when the clinical symptom burden is still low.
The comparison of QOL outcomes during different
chemotherapy lines, as presented here, suggests that
most of the QOL aspects show a progressive deterioration during the course of the disease over the chemotherapy lines. Though 2nd- and 3rd-line palliative
chemotherapy patients reported higher symptom burden
than adjuvant and 1st-line palliative chemotherapy
patients, only 1st- and 2nd-line palliative chemotherapy
patients showed stable QOL trajectories in contrast to
3rd+-line patients, who reported considerable QOL deteriorations over time.
In that regard, the outcomes for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy are of great interest. In contrast to
the palliative situation, our data indicate that during the
course of adjuvant chemotherapy, most of the subscales
of QOL show a continuous improvement, probably
caused by the fading of postoperative health problems.
According to our analysis, deleterious effects of adjuvant
chemotherapy on QOL seem highly unlikely. This information is of immediate clinical relevance in cases where
adjuvant chemotherapy is suggested to our patients.
Comparing different studies on QOL in patients with
cancer of the pancreas or bile ducts has some limitations, especially when different instruments and questionnaires are used. In our opinion, one of the major
problems of assessing QOL in these rapidly progressive
cancers is the timing and frequency of the assessments.
We have no knowledge about the optimal frequency, but
when too much time elapses between two surveys, we
cannot detect rapid but clinically important changes in
QOL [8,16,24].

The computer-assisted assessment of QOL data in daily
clinical practice, as used in our analysis, offers important
advantages over QOL assessments that have long time
intervals, which are presented in most clinical studies. The
computer-assisted assessments enabled us to evaluate QOL
at many time points with short intervals, allowing a more
robust estimate of longitudinal QOL changes during each
treatment course. For patients with aggressive tumours,
such as pancreatic cancer, usually with limited efficacy of
palliative systemic treatments, QOL assessments are of
even greater importance.
Certainly QOL has always to be seen as a multifactorial
process and patients’ subjectively perceived QOL is influenced by a variety of factors. Patients experience positive
and negative effects also due to their status, social and family support and individual coping strategies. Chemotherapy
especially ameliorates the tumor associated symptoms but
it is only one way to improve quality of life of patients with
advanced cancer. A recent study, conducted by Temel
et al., in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer demonstrated impressively that early
palliative care intervention in concert with standard oncology care improves QOL and median survival and reduces
depressive symptoms, compared with patients receiving
only standard treatment [26]. Besides treatment possibilities, high socioeconomic status also has been found to influence overall cancer survival positively [27,28] and social
support was linked to cancer survival as well, although the
results are divergent [29]. Lately, Cavalli-Björkman et al.

reported that colorectal cancer patients, who did not live in
a joint household with their significant other, were irrespective of age and co-morbidity less likely to receive combination chemotherapy and had poorer survival [30]. Social
support in terms of rehabilitation programs in a setting of
12 weeks resulted in better QOL and improved physical
functioning [31], whereas a 6-day residential psychosocial
course did not show any effects [32]. Taken these findings
together, it is obvious that a lot of research still has be done
to identify influential factors on patients’ QOL, and how
they relate to each other.
Our analysis has some limitations. As the number of
patients included is relatively low, the statistical power is
limited. Furthermore, some heterogeneity exists in the
evaluated population, which concerns important clinical
factors and the applied systemic treatments. Nevertheless, the patients included in this study represent our
daily clinical practice.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our data indicate that the frequent,
computer-assisted assessment of QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer or cancer of the biliary tract results in important information that suggests QOL stabilisation as the
main effect of chemotherapy in the palliative setting during
different treatment lines and excluding the relevant deterioration of QOL during adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore,
we recommend these procedures to be included in future
clinical trials to provide more robust information on QOL
effects of different therapeutic interventions.
