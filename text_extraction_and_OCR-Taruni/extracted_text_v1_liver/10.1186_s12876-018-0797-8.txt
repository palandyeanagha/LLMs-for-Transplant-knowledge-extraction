Abstract
Background: Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) was once regarded as a contraindicaton to liver transplantation
(LT). However, growing evidence has indicated that PPH patients undergoing LT may show similar outcomes compared
to those without PPH, and researchers have recommended it not be an absolute contraindication. Given this controversy,
we aimed to identify and review the current evidence on this topic and to provide a comparison of the outcomes after
LT between candidates with PPH and those without.
Methods: We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases for all studies
that compared the outcomes of PPH patients and those without PPH after LT. All studies reporting outcomes of PPH
patients versus those without PPH (Control) were further considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Odds ratios (OR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the pooled data between PPH and Control groups.
Results: Eleven retrospective trials and one prospective, randomized, controlled trial, involving 37,686 transplant recipients
were included. The PPH patients had increased 1-year mortality with an OR of 1.59 (95% CI = 1.26–2.01, P = 0.0001)
compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in graft loss and 30-day mortality after LT between
the two groups.
Conclusions: Patients with PPH who underwent LT had increased 1-year mortality compared to those without PPH,
while graft loss and 30-day mortality were similar. Nevertheless, LT may be a reasonable therapeutic option for some
patients with PPH, but further studies are needed to identify those select patients with PPH who would benefit most
from LT.
Keywords: Portopulmonary hypertension, Liver transplantation, Meta-analysis
Background
Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) is defined by the
presence of the following features in patients with portal
hypertension: mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)
determined by Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) is
defined by the presence of the following features in
patients with portal hypertension: mean pulmonary
arterial pressure (mPAP) determined by right-heart
catheterisation of > 25 mmHg at rest or > 30 mmHg
during exercise, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 3 wood units (240 dynes/s per cm-5),
and normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) <
15 mmHg. [1–3]. PPH represents a serious complication
of portal hypertension and is regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation (LT) by some experts. It is a
relatively common pathologic state in the setting of endstage liver disease (ESLD), especially cirrhosis, with a reported incidence ranging from 1 to 10% to as high as 39%
in patients receiving LT [4–6].
The pathophysiology of the relationship between
portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension is
poorly understood. Some researchers consider the development of pulmonary hypertension in the ESLD population

dependent upon the presence of significant portal hypertension, but the mechanisms by which portal hypertension
cause pulmonary hypertension remain unclear [7]. Others
maintain that the elevation of mPAP represents a hyperdynamic state of blood circulation and that this elevation in
mPAP eventually leads to portal hypertension [4, 8–11].
The true pathophysiology likely represents a combination
of factors including the patient’s underlying disease
process and relevant comorbidities that determine the
dominant causes of these high-pressure states.
Recently growing evidence suggests that PPH
should no longer be considered an absolute contraindication to LT unless PPH is severe and associated with
right ventricular dysfunction [6, 12, 18, 19]. Newer retrospective comparisons between patients with PPH and
those without who underwent LT showed similar mortality between the two groups or slightly higher rates of
death in PPH group that did not reach statistical significance [13, 14]. In 2012, a prospective controlled study
showed that there were no significant differences between the PPH group and the control group in terms of
six-month patient and graft survivals (100% vs. 88.9, 100%
vs. 100%, respectively) [15].
The role of LT in patients with PPH has long been debated. Given the current controversy, in this metaanalysis, we aimed to combine data from all published
studies to reevaluate the outcomes of the LT patients with
preoperative PPH and give some suggestions for the management of PPH patients waiting for LT.
Methods
Data sources and searches
We searched the PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane
library databases using the terms “Portopulmonary hypertension” OR “Pulmonary hypertension” AND “Liver transplantation.” The search included all studies published up to
February 2017. Publications were limited to those reporting
results from human subjects. Review articles were excluded
after limit filtering. To prevent missing relevant publications on the topic, we also performed manual searches of
the references of the relevant publications.
Study selection: Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Only those reporting outcomes of LT patients preoperatively diagnosed with PPH were included. Overlapping
cohort studies from the same institution were excluded to
avoid duplication. Studies lacking a control group or
whose populations included subjects with other pulmonary diseases were excluded since other pulmonary disease
processes can cause pulmonary hypertension. Studies comparing outcomes between the PPH patients with LT and
without LT were also excluded. Studies for which the data
could not be extracted for analysis such as those reporting
outcomes only in figure format (without description or tables) were excluded. Case reports whose data had poor
homogeneity and studies examining patients who received
multi-organ transplants were also excluded.
Quality assessment and data extraction
Publications were reviewed and two independent investigators extracted data with disagreements being resolved
through discussion and consensus. The primary outcome
was overall one-year patient survival rates. Secondary outcomes included early (30 days post-LT) patient and graft
survival rates. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment
scale (Additional file 1: Table S1) [16] was applied to assess the quality of all included trials. A study can be
awarded a maximum of one star for each numbered item
within the Selection and Outcome categories. A maximum
of two stars can be given for Comparability. Articles scoring
five stars or more were considered to be of high quality. In
addition, a RCT trial included was assessed by the Jadad
score [17] in which case a score of at least 4 indicated a
high methodological quality.
Data synthesis and analysis
Pooled odds ratios (OR) were used to evaluate the event
rates, and the results were reported with 95% confidence
intervals (CI). A P value < 0.05 was considered a significant difference in the values between the two groups. Heterogeneity through all the included studies was evaluated
by χ2 and I
2 statistical tests. Heterogeneity was considered
significant when P < 0.05 or I
2 > 50%, and a random effect
model was adopted. A random effect model is a kind
of hierarchical linear model, which assumes that the data
set being analyzed consists of a hierarchy of different
populations whose differences relate to that hierarchy.
When P > 0.05 for χ2 or I
2 < 50% for I2 statistical tests,
indicating low statistical heterogeneity in both cases, a
fixed effect model was used. A fixed effect model is a
statistical model that represents the observed quantities in
terms of explanatory variables that are treated as if the
quantities were non-random. A funnel plot was used to
assess publication bias. A funnel plot is designed to check
the existence of publication bias in systematic reviews and
meta-analyses. The largest studies will be near the average
while small studies will be spread on both sides of the
average. Variation can indicate publication bias. All statistical analyses for the current study were performed with
Review Manager (RevMan Version 5.3.5, The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).

Results
Search results and included studies
The PRISMA flow diagram and results based on the
search strategies and selection criteria described above
are outlined in Fig. 1. Briefly, 2260 articles were initially
identified. Among those references, 2218 studies were excluded after screening titles. The remaining 42 publications reporting results after LT for patients with PPH
underwent more extensive review. Nineteen of these studies had no data available and were excluded from this
meta-analysis. Five studies involved multiple organ transplantation, 4 studies lacked a control (no-PPH) group, one
study was a case report, and one study was a manuscript
reporting guidelines, which were also excluded. A total of
12 studies meeting all criteria were included in this metaanalysis, and the study characteristics are shown in Table 1.
No evidence of publications bias among the included
studies was found by means of a funnel plot (data not
shown). A total of 507 LT recipients with PPH and 37,179
LT patients without PPH were included in this metaanalysis.
Hemodynamic parameters in the PPH group
The diagnosis of PPH is made from measurements during right heart catheterization with mPAP of > 25 mmHg,
PVR > 240 dynes∙s∙cm − 5, and PAWP < 15 mmHg, and
this definition was relatively consistent among the trials included in this meta-analysis. Some of the articles used a
higher threshold of mPAP for diagnosis (mPAP> 30 mmHg)
and inclusion in the PPH group [18, 19]. Others such as
the DeMartino 2017 article, only included patients with
moderate to severe PPH (mPAP> 35 mmHg and PVR
greater than 240 PVR dynes∙s∙cm − 5) [4]While many studies used a single value of mPAP to serve as inclusion criteria for their PPH group, some further separated the PPH
group into three grades of PPH: mild, moderate, and severe
with considerable variation in the distinction between the
three subgroups among the trials included in this metaanalysis. The hemodynamic parameters of the PPH groups
in each of the studies are shown in Table 2.
Primary outcome
1-year mortality
Ten studies involving 453 LT recipients with PPH and
37,105 LT recipients without PPH reported 1-year survival rates after transplantation. The results of the SRTR
study (2014 Salgia, et al.) showed a higher 1-year mortality rate in PPH patients compared to patients without
PPH (P = 0.005) [6]. In the remaining 9 studies [5, 13,
15–19], there was no significant difference in 1-year mortality rates between the two groups. The combined 1-year
mortality rate was 26.0% for the PPH group and 12.7% for
the control group. There was no significant heterogeneity
identified among the 10 studies (χ2 = 7.25, p = 0.61, I
2 =
0%). A fixed effect model was used, which showed that
the OR for mortality at 1 year after LT was 1.59 (95% CI
=1.26–2.01; P = 0.0001) for the PPH group compared to
the control group (Fig. 2). Thus, one-year mortality after
LT was significantly higher in the PPH group compared to
the control group.
Secondary outcomes
30-day mortality
There were 3 studies that reported 30-day mortality
after LT. Overall, the mortality within 30 days of LT surgery was 12.8% for the control group and 17.9% for the
PPH group. No heterogeneity was identified across the 3
studies (χ2 = 2.68, P = 0.26; I
2 = 25%), thus a fixed effect
model was adopted. The OR for 30-day mortality in liver
recipients with PPH versus those without was 1.42 (95%
CI = 0.60–3.35, P = 0.42), which was not statistically
significant (Fig. 3). These data show no significant

difference in 30-day mortality after LT between those
with PPH and those without.
Graft loss rates
Another secondary endpoint that was examined was
graft loss at 1 year after transplantation in order to understand the influence of initial PPH on the success of the
transplant. Three of the studies reported graft loss rate.
There was no heterogeneity detected among the three
studies that reported one year graft loss rates (χ2 = 2.
45, P = 0.12; I
2 = 59%), thus a random effect model was
implemented for further comparison. The OR for one-year
graft loss was 1.71 (95% CI =0.97–3.00, P = 0.06) in the patients with PPH compared to those without (Fig. 4). Therefore, patients without PPH demonstrated significantly
better one-year graft survival after LT than those that
had PPH prior to transplant.
Discussion
In this manuscript we aimed to provide a comprehensive
meta-analysis comparing the early outcomes after LT between candidates with PPH and those without. A total of
twelve studies with 37,688 patients were included in this
meta-analysis. The primary outcome of 1-year mortality
was significantly higher in those with PPH, while 30-day
mortality was no different from controls. In addition, those
with PPH had significantly higher rates of graft loss at 1 year
after LT. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive,
systematic review of the available data on this topic and
therefore provides important insight into the controversy
regarding the benefit of LT in patients with PPH.
Patients with liver disease are at higher risk for pulmonary vascular conditions such as PPH due to systemically high intravascular flow and increased pulmonary
venous volume. In a communication from the French
Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram showing selection of articles for review

pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) registry (n = 154,
where only 33% had been treated with PAH-specific therapies), Le Pavec, et al. [20] described 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals of 88, 75 and 68%, respectively, for PPH patients.
Causes of death in this study were equally distributed between right ventricle failure due to progressive PPH and
direct complications from liver cirrhosis. If no therapy is
implemented, the prognosis of PPH is very poor with 5-
year survival of 4–14% reported at some centers [18, 21].
Current pharmacologic treatment options for PPH include
oral and intravenous vasodilator therapy such as prostacyclin analogues, phosphodiesterase 5-inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists [1]. Nevertheless, the available data
supporting the use of these specific therapies in PPH are
only presented in case series and uncontrolled observational studies.
The therapeutic potential of LT in PPH has also
been demonstrated, as Bozbas, et al. showed

significant reductions in mPAPs after LT in patients
with PPH [17]. However, due to poor outcomes reported early on in the experience of LT for patients
with PPH, it was considered a contraindication to LT
by many transplant centers [22–25]. More recent evidence from retrospective data in multiple centers suggests that unless PPH is severe and associated with
right ventricular dysfunction, it should no longer be
considered an absolute contraindication to liver transplant [4, 6, 17, 26]. Indeed, Ramsay, et al. reviewed
1205 LT recipients involving 102 PPH patients, the 3-
year mortality rates of the no-PPH, mild PPH, moderate PPH and severe PPH groups were 28, 33, 35, and
71%, respectively [18]. They concluded that patients
with severe PPH likely had pathological changes in
the pulmonary vasculature that were irreversible even
after LT, as severe PPH was associated with a much
higher perioperative mortality rate. A retrospective
study from the UNOS SRTR database reported 123
PPH patients [6], seventy-eight of them underwent
LT, whose 1- and 3-year survival were 85 and 81%.
The other 45 had not been transplanted and 11 of
them died on the waitlist, which indicated 3-year survival for PPH patients on the waitlist was about 75.
6%. Based in part on these data, the United States organ
allocation policy gives higher priority to perform LT in
PPH patients if hemodynamics are expected to significantly
improved and meet standardized Model for end-stage liver
disease (MELD) exception guidelines [4, 27, 28]. Because
of the important prognostic implications demonstrated by
these studies along with these changes in organ allocation
policies, the American Association for the Study of Liver
Disease and the International Liver Transplantation Society recommended all patients evaluated for LT be screened
for PPH by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), with confirmatory testing by right heart catheterization (RHC) [3, 8,
29, 30].
The overall mortality at 1 year after LT in our metaanalysis is comparable to the individual analyses with
26% mortality in the PPH group. However, this data includes multiple degrees of PPH as demonstrated in our
analysis of the hemodynamic status of the patients included in each of the studies. The individual studies
such as the Ramsay, et al. and Saner, et al. that defined
three groups mild, moderate, and severe PPH prior to
LT can help to determine and select the appropriate patient population that would have outcomes similar to
those without PPH. Identifying threshold values of
mPAP in PPH patients that predict poorer outcomes
after transplant or provide guidance about which patients would benefit from specific treatment of their
PPH prior to LT will be useful questions for future work
in this field. Determination of these values and novel
ways of evaluating prognosis after LT in the population
of patients with PPH also has broader implications for
organ allocation policy in this patient population.
There are multiple limitations inherent to this metaanalysis. The majority of the studies that were included
for analysis are retrospective, observational studies. In
addition, all but four of the studies had relatively small
sample sizes of participants, which may have precluded
an accurate assessment of heterogeneity. Donor factors
such as preoperative condition of the donor, age, cold
and warm ischemia time, and donation type have a great
impact on the post-operative outcomes of LT recipients.
For instance, donation after cardiac death (DCD) LT has
worse long-term outcomes compared to donation after
brain death (DBD) LT, with an increase in biliary

complications, ischemic cholangiopathy, graft loss and
mortality [31]. However, most of studies included in this
meta-analysis did not provide donor information (donor
baseline was only described in the studies of Salgia, et al.
and Mangus, et al.), which may represent a confounding
variable that could influence the comparison of mortality
rates between groups. Prior to the implementation of
TTE as a valuable tool in identifying patients with
PPH, this technology was not routinely used to screen
LT candidates for these phenomena. Therefore, a portion
of candidates who suffered from PPH may be missing
from our analysis, especially in those studies that reported
data from earlier times. In addition, the follow-up time in
our analysis was relatively short (only out to 1 year), which
may not be representative of the long-term outcomes for
these patients after LT. Also, there were only 3 studies
(with relatively small sample sizes) reporting 30-day mortality so drawing conclusions based on this analysis is difficult. Due to the wide distribution of study periods and the
advances in technology and operative techniques over
these time periods, a degree of bias related to these temporal changes in management may have been present and
was not accounted for in the analysis. Lastly, a few of the
studies had no available baseline data such as MELD score
and age of patients included calling into question the
quality of those studies. However, all the studies were evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale
or similar evaluation method and determined to be of sufficient quality for this meta-analysis.
Conclusion
There is an increase in 1-year patient mortality and graft
loss after LT in candidates with PPH. Thus, PPH remains an important risk factor that should continue to be
screened for in LT candidates. It is likely that different
grades of PPH exist some of which are amenable to treatment, and select patients with PPH are likely to benefit
more than others from LT. Therefore, more randomized
controlled trials with a larger sample sizes and long term
follow-up are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes
in these patients as well as to refine the selection of patients
with PPH who would benefit most from LT.
