Abstract
Purpose: Considering the high false-positive diagnosis of
the tardus parvus waveform (TPW) in Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) for hepatic artery stenosis (HAS)
after liver transplantation (LT), this study aimed to
determine clinical features and new cut-off values to help
guide treatment.
Materials and methods: This retrospective study was
approved by an Institutional Review Board. A total of
171 LT recipients were included and underwent DUS
and either computed tomography angiography or digital
subtraction angiography with an interval < 4 weeks at
least 1 month post-LT. The DUS of 69 patients exhibited
TPW [defined as resistive index (RI) < 0.5 and systolic
acceleration time (SAT) > 0.08 s]. A multilevel likelihood ratio (LR) analysis was used to explore new cut-off
values for DUS. In addition, abnormal liver function was
considered additional evidence (defined as any liver
enzyme > 3-fold of the upper limit of normal level or
2-fold increased). The results were stratified into three
categories, category 1 (subjects with traditional TPW),
category 2 (subjects with traditional TPW and abnormal
liver function), and category 3 (subjects with traditional
TPW and abnormal liver function, or with new cut-off
values), and the diagnostic performance of each category
was analyzed.
Results: The LR analysis revealed new cut-off values of
RI < 0.4 (LR = 10.58) or SAT > 0.12 s (LR = 16.46).
The false-positive rates for categories 2 and 3 were
significantly lower (7.6% vs. 18.1%, P = 0.038; 1.9% vs.
18.1%, P < 0.001, respectively) than those for category
1, while the sensitivity for category 2 was significantly
lower (41.8% vs. 74.6%, P < 0.001; 41.8% vs. 61.2%,
P = 0.038, respectively) than that for categories 1 and 3.
Conclusion: Using either (1) RI < 0.4 or SAT > 0.12 s,
or (2) traditional TPW (RI < 0.5 and SAT > 0.08 s) in
the presence of abnormal liver functions as the DUS
criteria for HAS will significantly decrease the falsepositive rate compared to traditional TPW without a
significant increase in the false-negative rate.
Key words: Liver transplantation—Hepatic artery
stenosis—Doppler ultrasonography
Significant hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after liver
transplantation (LT) is thought to predispose patients to
hepatic artery thrombosis, biliary complications and
graft loss, which are associated with poor patient survival
[1–3]. Operative intervention, re-transplantation or
endovascular therapy may be a solution to HAS, and
early detection is crucial to successful treatment [4–9].

Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is the established
method for the initial screening of vascular abnormalities
after LT, even during the immediate postoperative period. The DUS diagnostic criteria for significant HAS after
LT has withstood the test of time since Dodd III et al.
[10] evaluated quantitative parameters derived from the
main hepatic artery. Their criteria consist of a tardus
parvus waveform [TPW, with resistive index (RI) < 0.5,
systolic acceleration time (SAT) > 0.08 s] and peak
systolic velocity (PSV) > 2 m/s. Subsequent research
further extended to intrahepatic arteries [11–17].
Despite their widespread use and clinical utility, these
criteria continue to present a diagnostic dilemma for
clinicians. Since successfully detecting the PSV in the
region of stenosis is very difficult to achieve, given its
deep location and poor display on DUS, TPW is usually
the preferred criterion for evaluating HAS. Nevertheless,
a relatively high rate of false-positive diagnosis of HAS
based on TPW has been reported as 11.2%–27.0% [10,
18], resulting in diverse management, depending on
physicians or institutions, including immediate angiography or follow-up.
At our institution, additional liver function test results are used to further decide on the management
strategy for patients with TPW (Fig. 1). Such a strategy
reduces the false-positive cases but inevitably delays
management for HAS patients with unapparent elevated
liver function. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
determine clinical features and new Doppler cut-off
values to provide strong evidence to diagnose HAS to
help guide treatment with immediate angiography or
follow-up.
Materials and methods
A total of 1654 liver transplants were performed in patients between March 2004 and March 2015. Patients
were included in the study if they underwent DUS and a
follow-up computed tomography angiography (CTA) or
digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within a 4-week
interval at least 1 month after the LT for a targeted
evaluation of the hepatic arteries based on the present
diagnostic procedure at our institution, as mentioned
above (Fig. 1). If there were multiple examinations, the
earliest pair was selected for each liver. A total of 190
transplanted livers in 189 patients fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. Examination pairs were excluded for the following reasons: undetectable flow signal in both left and
right hepatic arteries or quantitative parameters derived
despite the documentation of arterial flow (n = 13); and
unavailability of angiographic images in our picture
archiving and communication system (PACS) (n = 5).
The remaining 172 transplanted livers in 171 patients
(total mean age 47 years ± 12, age range 7–71 years),
including 146 men (mean age 47 years ± 11, age range
7–71 years) and 25 women (mean age 44 years ± 13, age
range 16–64 years) (P = 0.334 for sex difference), constituted our study population. One patient underwent
two LTs in an interval of 56 months. Out of these patients, 161 underwent deceased-donor LT, and the
remaining patients underwent living-donor LT using
modified right-lobe (n = 8) or left-lobe (n = 1) grafts.
Indications for LT included hepatocellular carcinoma
(n = 88), liver cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B or C
virus (n = 32), fulminant hepatic failure (n = 39), Wilson’s disease (n = 2), alcoholic liver disease (n = 3),
autoimmune liver disease (n = 2), polycystic liver disease (n = 1), congenital cirrhosis (n = 1), hepatoblastoma (n = 1), biliary stricture (n = 2), and liver
metastases (n = 1).
The standard hepatic arterial reconstruction technique at our institution was end-to-end anastomosis
using monofilament polypropylene sutures (Prolene,
Ethicon) between the celiac trunk of the donor and the
recipient common hepatic artery (CHA). Alternatively, a
branch patch arterial anastomosis at the takeoff of the
gastroduodenal artery from the CHA was performed. If
the recipient hepatic artery was unsuitable for arterialization, an infra-renal aortic conduit derived from the
donor iliac artery was anastomosed in an end-to-side
fashion from the recipient aorta, and end-to-end anastomosis between the conduit and the celiac trunk of the
donor was performed. In cases of hepatic artery anatomic variants involving the donor liver, complex hepatic
arterial reconstructions were required that included the
utilization of the superior mesenteric artery from the
donor as the inflow vessel.
DUS and analysis
All DUS examinations were performed using one of the
US devices (Sequoia 512, Siemens, USA; Aplio 500,
Toshiba, Japan) with a 3–5 MHz convex array transducer. To standardize how the spectral waveform and
measurements were recorded, all DUS examinations
were performed by one of three experienced radiologists
(R.Z., J.R. and T.W., with 11, 10 and 4 years of experience in hepatic transplant imaging, respectively). Color
and spectral Doppler sonograms of the peripheral right
and left hepatic arteries were obtained. The standard
Doppler parameters were adjusted to maximal gain to
limit background noise, the lowest pulse-repetition frequency without aliasing artifacts, and a 2–5 mm Doppler
sample gate for optimal signal detection from the common, left and right hepatic arteries of each liver. In
arterial waveforms that were reproducible for at least
three waveforms, the RI and SAT were calculated and
documented.
The three radiologists recorded the RI and SAT of
each hepatic artery and considered the presence of TPW
with RI < 0.5 and SAT > 0.08 s in any hepatic artery
B. Zheng et al.: Tardus parvus waveforms in Doppler ultrasonography 1635

of each liver [10]. The radiologists also recorded the
minimal RI and maximum SAT of each liver.
Reference findings and analysis
The liver function test results were also recorded for each
patient within 4 weeks of DUS examination. The
abnormal liver function suspicious for HAS was defined
as any liver enzyme >3-fold of the upper limit of normal
level (ULNL) or double increased. The mean interval
between DUS and a follow-up CTA or DSA was
5.4 days ± 6.1 (range 0–29 days) without treatment.
Abdominal CTA was performed with one of the
multi-detector CT (Light Speed QX/1, GE, USA;
Aquilion One, Toshiba, Japan). The scanned area was
from the subdiaphragmatic area to the lower hepatic rim.
An aliquot of 0.8–2.0 mL/kg iodinated contrast medium
(Ultravist 370 mg/mL; Bayer, Germany) was administered at a rate of 4–6 mL/s. Reconstruction of the hepatic artery imaging was performed via specific
workstations (Advantage Windows 4.1, Sun Microsystems, USA; Aquilion One Displaying Monitor Workstation, Toshiba, Tokyo) for each patient. DSA
(Multistar, Siemens, Germany) was performed after
selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, and
150–250 mL non-ionic contrast medium (Omnipaque
300 mg/mL; Nycomed Amersham, Norway) was used.
Hepatic arteriography was at 2 images/s.
A total of 155 CTA and 17 DSA were utilized as the
reference. All angiograms were retrospectively reviewed

by a radiologist (X.M., with 11 years of experience in
hepatic transplant imaging) without knowledge of the
DUS findings. HAS was defined as a short segment of
narrowing and was determined to be clinically important
if the region of stenosis was ‡50% in diameter. Angiographic measurements were made using calipers available
on a PACS station on magnified axial or coronal images
in the areas of stenosis and were compared with the
normal-caliber artery identified more distally. The percentage of HAS was calculated as [(DpostHA - DstenosisHA)/DpostHA] 9 100% [18], where DpostHA is the
diameter of the post to the stenosis segment of the hepatic artery, and DstenosisHA is the diameter of the hepatic
arterial stenosis. Accordingly, the 172 transplanted livers
in 171 patients were assigned to HAS and non-HAS
groups.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc
(version 9.3.6.0, Ostend, Belgium) and SPSS (version
15.0, Chicago, USA). To avoid potential confounders in
the classification of HAS and non-HAS groups, the
independent t test and v2 test were used. With CTA or
DSA as the reference, we analyzed the multilevel likelihood ratios (LRs) to explore new cut-off values across
the whole spectrum of RI and SAT values. The LR for
each category was calculated by dividing the percentage
of patients with the target condition (HAS) in that category by the percentage without the condition in that
category. LRs above 10 or below 0.1 are considered to
provide strong evidence for including or excluding
diagnoses, respectively [19, 20]. To determine treatment
with immediate angiography or follow-up, groups were
stratified into three categories according to the combination of traditional TPW, abnormal liver function, and
new cut-off values defined as follows: category 1, subjects
with traditional criteria for TPW (RI < 0.5 and SAT
> 0.08 s); category 2, subjects with TPW and abnormal
liver function (any liver enzyme > 3-fold of ULNL or
double increased); category 3, subjects with TPW and
abnormal liver function, or with new cut-off values. The
sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive
values (PPV and NPV, respectively) and accuracy of each
category were evaluated and compared. All reported
P values are two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of patients
Of the 172 liver transplants, 67 (39.0%) had HAS at the
reference with the mean percentage of stenosis of 75.4%
(range 50%–100%). The remaining 105 (61.0%) were assigned to the non-HAS group. The major clinical
parameters of the liver transplants included in the study
are listed in Table 1.
Analysis of optimal cut-off value
The mean minimal RI was significantly lower in the HAS
group (0.45 ± 0.13, range 0.23–0.77) than in the nonHAS group (0.62 ± 0.10, range 0.32–0.86, P < 0.001),
and the mean maximum SAT was significantly longer in
the HAS group (0.11 ± 0.04 s, range 0.05–0.23 s) than in
the non-HAS group (0.07 ± 0.02 s, range 0.03–0.19 s,
P < 0.001). The AUROC of RI and SAT for identifying
HAS after LT was 0.84 (95% CI 0.77–0.90) and 0.85
(95% CI 0.80–0.91), respectively (Fig. 2).
Of the 172 liver transplants, 69 (40.1%) were diagnosed with TPW on DUS. The LR analysis revealed that
the new cut-off values of RI < 0.4 (LR = 10.58) or SAT
> 0.12 s (LR = 16.46) were adequate for including

HAS (Table 2). Of the 172 liver transplants, 40 (23.3%)
met the new cut-off values.
Comparison with different categories
As the categories defined above [category 1, subjects with
traditional criteria for TPW (RI < 0.5 and SAT
> 0.08 s); category 2, subjects with TPW and abnormal
liver function (any liver enzyme > 3-fold of ULNL or
double increased); category 3, subjects with TPW and
abnormal liver function, or with new cut-off values (RI
< 0.4 or SAT > 0.12 s)], the diagnostic utility of these
three categories was shown in Table 3. The specificities
of categories 2 and 3 were significantly higher (92.4% vs.
81.9%, P = 0.038; 98.1% vs. 81.9%, P < 0.001, respectively), and the false-positive rates were significantly
lower (7.6% vs. 18.1%, P = 0.038; 1.9% vs. 18.1%,
P < 0.001, respectively) than those of category 1;
meanwhile, the sensitivity of category 2 was significantly
lower (41.8% vs. 74.6%, P < 0.001; 41.8% vs. 61.2%,
P = 0.038, respectively) than that of categories 1 and 3.
Proposed strategies
Although the combination of TPW and abnormal liver
function (category 2) for depicting HAS has been
adopted to decide on immediate CTA or DSA at our
institute (Fig. 1), due to the high false-positive rate of
TPW, 22 of 50 (44.0%) HAS patients in this study that
met the category were misdiagnosed and were, therefore,
unable to receive immediate management due to normal
liver function (Figs. 3, 4). However, when considering
category 3, 13 of these 22 HAS patients (59.1%) could be
correctly diagnosed as HAS because they met the new
cut-off values for DUS, which indicated that the number
of HAS patients to receive immediate management
would increase from 28 (28/50, 56.0%) to 41 (41/50,
82.0%) and delayed management would decrease from 22
(22/50, 44.0%) to 9 (9/50, 18.0%). In addition, category 3
would result in misdiagnosing HAS in 2 of the 11 nonHAS patients (18.2%), which indicated that the number
of non-HAS patients receiving immediate management
would slightly increase from 8 (42.1%) to 10 (52.6%).
Discussion
We found that applying the traditional TPW criterion
defined by Dodd III et al. [10] as a TPW with RI < 0.5
and SAT > 0.08 s indeed led to a high false-positive rate
of 18.1%, which is identical to that in previous studies
[10, 18]. The high false-positive rate indicates that a
number of patients with TPW should not require treatment or further examinations. To avoid unnecessary
management, the combination of TPW and additional
abnormal liver function (category 2) for depicting HAS is
now applied at our institution (Fig. 1). The false-positive
rate indeed decreased to 7.6%. However, sensitivity also
decreased from 74.6% to 41.8%, possibly because of a
slow progression of these HAS cases with unapparent
evaluated liver function within a few days, which also
caused delayed management for these high-risk patients
in our research.
To accurately diagnose HAS and to determine timely
treatment or further examination for HAS patients, we
analyzed multilevel LRs to establish new cut-off values
for DUS to include or exclude HAS patients [19, 20],
rather than the ROC analysis used in the previous studies
[18, 21]. This statistical analysis has been successfully
applied in several works to reliably indicate the disease

stage without requiring invasive references [22]. The
advantage of this approach is that unlike using sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, it can be used to
calculate the risk of abnormality without depending on
the prevalence of abnormality for particular test results
[19]. In this approach, LRs above 10 or below 0.1 are
considered to provide strong evidence to include or exclude diagnoses, respectively [19, 20]. According to this
approach, a RI < 0.4 or a SAT > 0.12 s strongly predicts patients with HAS (both LRs > 10), and thus,
immediate management should be required, rather than
waiting for elevated liver function.
Based on the results, we suggested new criteria (category 3, combination of TPW and abnormal liver function, or new cut-off values) for predicting HAS to
improve clinical strategy. Compared with category 2
(combination of TPW and liver function), this category
would correctly diagnose 13 more of the 50 HAS patients
(from 56.0% to 82.0%), without significantly increasing
the number of incorrect diagnoses of non-HAS patients
(from 42.1% to 52.6%), which may be especially useful in
HAS patients with normal liver function.
Studies on enhancing the utility of TPW for HAS
have been reported, including an additional PSV [10, 18]
or waveform grading system [22] as a solution. The initial
criteria proposed by Dodd III et al. [10] also included a
PSV threshold > 2 m/s besides TPW, and the combined
parameters yielded 97% sensitivity and 64% specificity
for marked arterial disease. However, Park et al. [18]
suggested a contrary PSV threshold £ 48 cm/s, which
improved the false-positive rate from 11.2% to 1.0%
when combined with TPW. In addition, Choi et al. [22]

HAS patients (13/22, 59.1%) were correctly diagnosed with
HAS (red boxes), decreasing the number of HAS patients who
received delayed management from 22 to 9 (light blue boxes);
while 2 more non-HAS patients (2/11, 18.2%) were misdiagnosed with HAS, increasing the non-HAS patients who received immediate management from 8 to 10 (white boxes).

and RI = 0.30 and SAT = 0.11 s of the left HA (middle). Although both AST and ALT were normal on the same day, the
patient insisted on further examination, and immediate CTA
was performed on the same day, which showed HAS stenosis
of 95.0% (right red arrow).

proposed a TPW waveform grading system that achieved
sensitivities of 78%–80% and specificities of 89%–91%
when combined with RI < 0.5. However, these solutions
appear to be suboptimal for clinical practice for the
following reasons: (1) successfully detecting PSV in the
region of stenosis is difficult to achieve because it is often
difficult to identify the region of stenosis, usually at or
near the anastomosis, due to its tiny arterial caliber and
deep location or due to a poor sonic window and a discontinuous display of hepatic arterial flow. Even if a PSV
is achieved, identifying whether it represents the real PSV
in the region of stenosis or distal to stenosis is also difficult because the blood flow velocity increases initially in
a critical stenosis and then rapidly decreases; (2) waveform pattern analysis is subjective; thus, attaining
homologous results among different institutions worldwide may be difficult. In contrast, we proposed adding
abnormal liver function and new cut-off values for DUS,
which consisted of only RI and SAT (both of which are
routinely obtained at most institutions). We believe that
as routine parameters for DUS, RI, and SAT would be
simpler and easier to adopt in practice than PSV and
waveform pattern analysis to detect HAS in patients.
Our study also had several limitations. First, the design of retrospective studies is inherently limited in terms
of the adjusted analysis that could be expected with a
randomized controlled study. Instead, we compared age,
sex, and liver-transplant type between the HAS and nonHAS groups as potential confounders, and no significant
differences were found between these two groups (all
P > 0.05). Second, the patients in the study were included over the course of a 10-year study period,
resulting in the inclusion of the work of surgeons and
sonographers with varying skill and experience and the
results of various DUS machines and techniques. Relying on RI and SAT measurements by three different
radiologists without assessing inter-observer variability is
another limitation. In our study, all surgery and DUS
examinations were performed using strict protocols that
were already established for clinical purposes, including
indication of types of arterial anastomosis and measurements of RI and SAT with accurate manual angle
correction. Third, a verification bias is inherent in our
study, wherein the patients with positive index test results
selectively undergo the reference procedure, resulting in
the exclusion of subjects with negative index test results
and a higher diagnostic rate of HAS after LT of 39.0%
(67/172) in our study, whereas the estimated incidence is
reported to be 5%–9% in the literature [3, 23, 24]. This
discrepancy is inevitable because it is difficult to routinely provide all patients with reference procedures.
Fourth, most cases in our study used CTA (90.1%,
155/172) rather than DSA (9.9%, 17/172) as the reference. Although CTA and its reconstruction are reported
to be well correlated with DSA in the diagnosis of HAS
[25, 26], it is still a relatively imperfect reference compared with DSA. However, CTA is more commonly
performed for the confirmative diagnosis of HAS at our
institution because it is less invasive and correlates well
with DSA in the diagnosis of HAS.
In summary, using either (1) RI < 0.4 or SAT
> 0.12 s, or (2) traditional TPW (RI < 0.5 and SAT
> 0.08 s) in the presence of abnormal liver functions as
the DUS criteria for HAS will significantly decrease the
false-positive rate compared to traditional TPW without
a significant increase in the false-negative rate.
