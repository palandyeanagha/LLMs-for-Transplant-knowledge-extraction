ABSTRACT
Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a
complex disease with variable presentations, course and
prognosis. We sought to develop evidence-based
recommendations addressing the major issues in the
management of SLE.
Methods: The EULAR Task Force on SLE comprised 19
specialists and a clinical epidemiologist. Key questions for
the management of SLE were compiled using the Delphi
technique. A systematic search of PubMed and Cochrane
Library Reports was performed using McMaster/Hedges
clinical queries’ strategies for questions related to the
diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of SLE. For
neuropsychiatric, pregnancy and antiphospholipid syndrome questions, the search was conducted using an
array of relevant terms. Evidence was categorised based
on sample size and type of design, and the categories of
available evidence were identified for each recommendation. The strength of recommendation was assessed
based on the category of available evidence, and
agreement on the statements was measured across the
19 specialists.
Results: Twelve questions were generated regarding the
prognosis, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of SLE,
including neuropsychiatric SLE, pregnancy, the antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus nephritis. The evidence to
support each proposition was evaluated and scored. After
discussion and votes, the final recommendations were
presented using brief statements. The average agreement
among experts was 8.8 out of 10.
Conclusion: Recommendations for the management of
SLE were developed using an evidence-based approach
followed by expert consensus with high level of
agreement among the experts.
Approximately half a million people in Europe and
a quarter of a million people in the USA (projections based on prevalence rates of 30–50 per
100 000) have systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE).1 The great majority of these patients are
women in their childbearing years. SLE is a
complex disease with variable presentations, course
and prognosis characterised by remissions and
flares.2 3 Because of the systemic nature of the
disease, multiple medical specialties are involved in
the care of these patients. To avoid fragmentation
and optimise management, there is a presently
unmet need to establish an integrated approach
based on widely accepted principles and evidencebased recommendations.
Recommendations and/or guidelines represent a
popular way of integrating evidence-based medicine to clinical practice. These are systematically
developed statements to assist practitioner and
patient decisions about appropriate healthcare for
specific clinical circumstances.4 To this end and
under the auspices of EULAR, we undertook the
task of developing guidelines for the management
of various aspects of SLE. To ensure a high level of
intrinsic quality and comparability of this
approach, we used the EULAR standard operating
procedures.5 We present here 12 key recommendations, selected from a panel of experts, for the
management (diagnosis, treatment, monitoring) of
SLE using a combination of research-based evidence and expert consensus.
METHODS
The EULAR standardised operating procedures
suggest a discussion among experts in the field
about the focus, the target population and an
operational definition of the term ‘‘management’’,
followed by consensus building based on the
currently available literature (evidence-based),
combined with expert opinion, as needed, to arrive
at consensus for a set of recommendations.5 The
expert committee agreed on 12 topics, including
general management of SLE (5 questions), neuropsychiatric lupus (2 questions), pregnancy in lupus
(1 question), antiphospholipid syndrome (1 question) and lupus nephritis (3 questions). A systematic search of PubMed the Cochrane library
was performed, and retrieved items were screened
for eligibility based on their title, abstract and/or
full content. Evidence was categorised according
to study design using a traditional rating scale,
and the strength of the evidence was graded
combining information on the design and validity of the available data (see the full-text version
for more details). The results of the literature
search were summarised, aggregated and distributed to the expert committee. Following discussion, voting and adjusting the formulation,
the expert committee arrived at 12 final recommendations for the management of SLE (table 1).

RESULTS (TABLES 1 AND 2)
Prognosis
SLE runs a highly variable clinical course, and determination of
prognosis together with the development of reliable indicators
of active disease, disease severity and damage accrual is
important. Several clinical manifestations (discoid lesions,6
arthritis,7 serositis,8 renal involvement,9 10 psychosis or seizures6 11), laboratory tests (anaemia,8 12 13 thrombocytopenia,14
leucopenia,15 serum cretatinine9), immunological tests (antidsDNA,10 14 16 anti-C1q,17 antiphospholipid,18–20 anti-RNP,18 antiRo/SSA,21 22 anti-La/SSB antibodies,23 serum complement concentrations12 14 23), brain MRI7 and renal biopsy24 25 correlate
with outcome in terms of development of major organ
involvement (nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus), end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), and damage accrual or decreased survival.
The small size and large number of candidate predictors
tested represent significant problems and raise the possibility for
selective reporting of significant associations. Moreover, these
prognostic variables have not been uniformly informative across
Table 1 Summary of the statements and recommendations on the management of systemic lupus erythematosus based on evidence and expert
opinion
General management
Prognosis
In patients with SLE, new clinical signs (rashes, arthritis, serositis, neurological manifestations and seizures/psychosis), routine laboratory (CBC, serum creatinine, proteinuria and
urinary sediment), and immunological tests (serum C3, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, antiphospholipid, anti-RNP), may provide prognostic information for the outcome in
general and involvement of major organs, and thus should be considered in the evaluation of these patients. Confirmation by imaging (brain MRI), and pathology (renal biopsy) may
add prognostic information and should be considered in selected patients.
Monitoring
New clinical manifestations such as number and type of skin lesions, or arthritis, serositis, and neurological manifestations (seizures/psychosis), laboratory tests (CBC),
immunological tests (serum C3/C4, anti-C1q, anti-dsDNA), and validated global activity indices have diagnostic ability for monitoring for lupus activity and flares, and may be used in
the monitoring of lupus patients.
Co-morbidities
SLE patients are at increased risk for certain co-morbidities, due to the disease and/or its treatment. These co-morbidities include infections (urinary-tract infections, other
infections), atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidaemias, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, malignancies (especially non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). Minimisation of risk
factors together with a high-index of suspicion, prompt evaluation, and diligent follow-up of these patients is recommended.
Treatment
In the treatment of SLE without major organ manifestations, antimalarials and/or glucocorticoids are of benefit and may be used. NSAIDs may be used judiciously for limited periods
of time at patients at low risk for their complications. In non-responsive patients or patients not being able to reduce steroids below doses acceptable for chronic use,
immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate should also be considered.
Adjunct therapy
Photo-protection may be beneficial in patients with skin manifestations and should be considered. Lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, weight control, exercise) are likely to
be beneficial for patient outcomes and should be encouraged. Depending on the individual medication and the clinical situation, other agents (low-dose aspirin, calcium/vitamin D,
biphosphonates, statins, antihypertensives (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors)) should be considered. Oestrogens (oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement
therapy) may be used, but accompanying risks should be assessed.
Neuropsychiatric lupus
Diagnosis
In SLE patients, the diagnostic work-up (clinical, laboratory, neuropsychological, and imaging tests) of neuropsychiatric manifestations should be similar to that in the general
population presenting with the same neuropsychiatric manifestations.
Treatment
SLE patients with major neuropsychiatric manifestations considered to be of inflammatory origin (optic neuritis, acute confusional state/coma, cranial or peripheral neuropathy,
psychosis, and transverse myelitis/myelopathy) may benefit from immunosuppressive therapy.
Pregnancy in lupus
Pregnancy affects mothers with SLE and their offspring in several ways.
(a) Mother. There is no significant difference in fertility in lupus patients. Pregnancy may increase lupus disease activity, but these flares are usually mild. Patients with lupus
nephritis and antiphospholipid antibodies are more at risk of developing pre-eclampsia and should be monitored more closely.
(b) Fetus. SLE may affect the fetus in several ways, especially if the mother has a history of lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid, anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibodies. These conditions
are associated with an increase in the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction and fetal congenital heart block. Prednisolone, azathioprine,
hydroxychloroquine and low-dose aspirin may be used in lupus pregnancies. At present, evidence suggests that mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate must
be avoided.
Antiphospholipid syndrome
In patients with SLE and antiphospholipid antibodies, low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention of thrombosis and pregnancy loss. Other risk factors for thrombosis
should also be assessed. Oestrogen-containing drugs increase the risk for thrombosis. In non-pregnant patients with SLE and APS-associated thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation
with oral anticoagulants is effective for secondary prevention of thrombosis. In pregnant patients with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome combined unfractionated or LMW heparin
and aspirin reduce pregnancy loss and thrombosis and should be considered.
Lupus nephritis
Monitoring
Renal biopsy, urine sediment analysis, proteinuria, and kidney function may have independent predictive ability for clinical outcome in therapy of lupus nephritis but need to be
interpreted in conjunction. Changes in immunological tests (anti-dsDNA, serum C3) have only limited ability to predict the response to treatment and may be used only as
supplemental information.
Treatment
In patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, glucocorticoids in combination with immunosuppressive agents are effective against progression to end-stage renal disease. Longterm efficacy has been demonstrated only for cyclophosphamide-based regimens, which are however associated with considerable adverse effects. In short- and medium-term trials,
mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated at least similar efficacy compared with pulse cyclophosphamide and a more favourable toxicity profile: failure to respond by 6 months
should evoke discussions for intensification of therapy. Flares following remission are not uncommon and require diligent follow-up.
End-stage renal disease
Dialysis and transplantation in SLE have rates for long-term patient and graft-survival comparable with those observed in non-diabetic non-SLE patients, with transplantation being
the method of choice.

patients in various clinical settings or backgrounds. Most
importantly, perhaps, no single predicting factor has emerged
that could accurately predict the outcome. Thus, the various
prognostic factors in a single patient need to be evaluated in
conjunction. In general, involvement of major organs denotes a
worse prognosis.
Monitoring
SLE is often complicated by exacerbations and flares of varying
severity. Several global and organ-specific activity indices are
used in the evaluation of SLE patients in routine clinical practice and in clinical trials.26–28 More commonly used are the
British Isles Lupus Assessement Group Scale (BILAG), European
Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM), and the Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). These
indices have been developed in the context of long-term observational studies, are good predictors of damage and mortality, and reflect changes in disease activity.29–31 The committee
encourages the use of at least one of these indices for the
monitoring of disease activity. In addition, new clinical
manifestations (skin lesions,32 anaemia, lymphopenia, or
thrombocytopenia,33 34 low serum C3 and/or C4 concentrations,35 36 anti-dsDNA,33 37 38 and anti-C1q titres39) correlate with
disease severity and can predict future flares.
While these indices and diagnostic tests may have some
diagnostic ability for monitoring disease, none of them has been
evaluated in randomised trials for the ability to alter management and patient outcome. The level of changes that should
trigger changes in management is also unknown. For example,
intensification of therapy based on serological activity alone,
especially a rise in anti-dsDNA titres,37 40 41 runs a risk of
overtreating patients, although it has been shown to prevent
relapses in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).42 In these cases,
most experts advise a closer follow-up for clinical disease
activity.
Co-morbidities
SLE patients may be at increased risk for several co-morbidities,
and treatment-related morbidity may not be easily separable
from disease-related morbidity, thus raising the issue of whether
the two may have an additive or synergistic effect. Patients with
SLE have an almost 5-fold increased risk of death compared with
the general population.43 44 Several observational cohorts and
case-control studies have identified infections,10 45 46 hypertension,47 dyslipidaemia,47 48 diabetes mellitus,47 atherosclerosis,48 49
coronary heart disease,50 osteoporosis,51 avascular bone necrosis10 52 and certain types of cancer (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
lung cancer, hepatobiliary cancer)53 as a common cause of
morbidity and mortality in SLE patients. However, no
randomised trials exist to suggest that intensified screening for
these comorbidities would improve outcome. Moreover, many
of these data originate from tertiary referral centres that usually
provide care to the most severe cases of lupus raising the
possibility of spectrum of disease bias. Suboptimal selection of
controls may also inflate the reported strength of some of these
associations. Neverthless, clinical experience and available data
suggest that comorbities are a major component of the disease.
The committee therefore recommends a high index of suspicion
and diligent follow-up.
Treatment of non-major organ involvement
Glucocorticoids,42 54 antimalarials,55 56 non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, in severe, refractory cases,
immunosuppressive agents57–59 are used in the treatment of
SLE patients without major-organ involvement. Despite their
widespread use, there are only a few RCTs with variable
outcome criteria demonstrating their efficacy in SLE. Moreover,
while most studies have shown improvement, it is not apparent
whether patients were left with residual disease activity and its
extent. The evidence is typically limited to small sample sizes,
even when randomisation has been used. The committee
recommends judicious use of these agents, taking into
consideration the potential harms associated with each of these
drugs.
Adjunct-therapy
In a double-blind, intra-individual comparative study, the use of
sunscreens could prevent the development of skin lesions
following photoprovocation.60 Although no data are available
in SLE specifically, the committee felt that low-dose aspirin may
be considered in adult lupus patients receiving corticosteroids, in
those with antiphospholipid antibodies and in those with at
least one traditional risk factor for atherosclerotic disease.61
In patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy,
calcium and vitamin D may protect from bone mass loss.62
Two other studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of
biphosphonates in mixed population of patients with SLE and
other inflammatory diseases.63 64 Pregnancy should be postponed
for 6 months after withdrawal of biphosphonates.65 Although
oestrogen use has been associated with increased risk for
developing SLE,66 two RCTs have concluded that oral oestrogen
contraceptives do not increase the risk for flare in stable
disease.67 68 Hormone-replacement therapy results in a significantly better change in bone mass density compared with
placebo or calcitriol, without increasing the risk for flares.69 70
These results may not be generalised to patients with increased
risk for thombo-occlusive incidents, and accompanying risks
should be assessed before oestrogen therapy is prescribed.
Despite the lack of SLE-specific literature, weight control,
physical exercise and smoking cessation are recommended,
especially for SLE patients with increased CVD risk. Statins and
antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors) should also be considered in
selected patients.
Diagnosis of neuropsychiatric lupus
Neurological and/or psychiatric manifestations occur often in
SLE patients and may be directly related to disease itself
(primary neuropsychiatric lupus) or to complications of the
disease or its treatment (secondary neuropsychiatric lupus).
There are several clinical, laboratory/immunological, neuropsychological and imaging tests20 71–78 which have been used in SLE
patients presenting with neuropsychiatric manifestations.
Altogether, these studies suggest that no single clinical,
laboratory, neuropsychological and imaging test can be used
to differentiate neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus
(NPSLE) from non-NPSLE patients with similar neuropsychiatric manifestations. A combination of the aforementioned tests
may provide useful information in assessment of selected SLE
patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The
diagnostic evaluation should be similar to what the evaluation
would be in patients without SLE who exhibit the same
neuropsychiatric manifestations.
Treatment of severe, inflammatory neuropsychiatric lupus

activity in other organs and involves a variety of pathogenic

mechanisms including immune-mediated neuronal excitation/
injury/death or demyelination (which is usually managed with
immunosuppressive therapy) and/or ischaemic injury due to
impaired perfusion (due to microangiopathy, thrombosis or
emboli) commonly associated with the antiphospholipid antibodies which may require anticoagulation.2
We found a single RCT conducted in 32 SLE patients
presenting with active NPSLE manifestations such as peripheral/cranial neuropathy, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis,
brainstem disease or coma.79 Induction therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) was followed by either intravenous monthly cyclophosphamide (CY) versus intravenous MP
every 4 months for 1 year and then intravenous CY or
intravenous MP every 3 months for another year. Eighteen
out of 19 patients receiving CY versus 7/13 patients receiving
MP (p = 0.03) responded to treatment. Beneficial effects of CY
in treatment of severe NPSLE have also been suggested in nonrandomised controlled studies.80 81
Pregnancy in lupus
The management of a pregnant SLE patient has always been a
challenge for the practising physician, since lupus may affect
pregnancy and vice versa. There is not enough evidence to
support a deleterious effect of SLE on fertility.82–84 Pregnancy
may increase lupus disease activity and cause mild-to-moderate
flares, involving mostly skin, joints and blood.85–87
Lupus nephritis88 89 and antiphospholipid antibodies90 91 have
been identified as a risk factor for hypertensive complications
and pre-eclampsia. SLE patients—especially those with nephritis or antiphospholipid antibodies—are at risk for adverse
pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth and
premature delivery (relative risks ranging from 2.2 to 5.8).87 92–
95 Antiphospholipid antibodies and nephritis are also associated
with low birth weight and intra-uterine growth restriction.96 97
Fetal congenital heart block is another complication of SLE
pregnancies (2–4.5%),98 99 and it is associated with anti-Ro/SSA
or anti-La/SSB autoantibodies.
Prednisolone and other non-fluorinated glucocorticoids,
azathioprine, ciclosporin A and low-dose aspirin have been used
in lupus pregnancy, but their efficacy and safety have not been
demonstrated in randomised trials. The efficacy and safety of
hydroxychloroquine in lupus pregnancy have been evaluated in
one RCT.100 These recommendations may differ from the
ratings of the United States Food & Drug Administration
which, in their current form, are often not helpful for the
clinician treating patients with chronic disease during pregnancy and lactation.65 There is no evidence to support the use of
mycophenolate mofetil or CY, and methotrexate and these
agents must be avoided during pregnancy.101 102
Antiphospholipid syndrome in lupus
Antiphospholipid antibodies are commonly encountered in SLE
patients and are associated with increased risk for thromboocclusive incidents. In such patients, primary and/or secondary
prevention of thrombosis is warranted, but the clinical decision
is often hampered by accompanying risks for treatment-related
adverse effects (ie, major bleeding). Despite the lack of evidence
for primary prevention of thombosis and pregnancy loss, the
expert committee recommends the use of low-dose aspirin in
SLE patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, especially when
other risk factors for thrombosis coexist.
The effectiveness of oral anticoagulation over aspirin alone in
prevention of thrombosis in (non-pregnant) SLE patients with
antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis has been established in retrospective controlled studies.103–106 Two RCTs107 108
have demonstrated no superiority of high-intensity (target INR
3.1–4.0) over moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) for
secondary prevention, and increased risk for minor bleeding in
the high-intensity arm (28% vs 11%).108 Their results, however,
are limited in that most patients (.70%) had history of
venous—rather than arterial—thrombosis, and that patients
who had already had recurrent events on oral anticoagulation
were excluded. Conversely, retrospective studies including more
patients with previous arterial thrombosis or stroke have
concluded that high-intensity warfarin is more efficacious in
secondary prevention of thrombosis without increasing the risk
for major bleeding.103–105 109 110 The committee proposes that in
patients with APS and a first event of venous thrombosis, oral
anticoagulation should target INR 2.0–3.0. In the case of arterial
or recurrent thrombosis, high-intensity anticoagulation (target
INR 3.0–4.0) is warranted.
As for pregnant SLE patients with APS, a recent Cochrane
Review concluded that combined unfractionated heparin and
aspirin may reduce the risk for pregnancy loss (RR 0.46, 95% CI:
0.29 to 0.71).111 The combination of low-molecular-weight
heparin and aspirin also seems to be effective (RR 0.78, 95%
CI: 0.39 to 1.57). There are no randomised trials assessing the
usefulness of anticoagulation in prevention of recurrent
thrombosis during pregnancy. The committee recommends
the use of aspirin and heparin for the prevention of APS-related
thrombosis during pregancy.
Lupus nephritis: diagnosis and monitoring
In patients with suspected lupus nephritis, renal biopsy may be
used to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate disease activity,
chronicity/damage, and determine prognosis and appropriate
therapy. The predictive value of second renal biopsy (ie, after
treatment initiation) has been assessed in one prospective112 and
a few retrospective studies.113 114 It was found that some
pathology findings were associated with clinical response and
outcome in lupus nephritis. Nevertheless, repeat renal biopsies
pose a risk to the patient and may not be feasible for all
patients. There is some evidence to support the predictive
ability of urine sediment analysis in monitoring lupus nephritis
therapy.115 116 Changes in proteinuria,117 serum creatinine,22 36 113 117 anti-dsDNA and serum C3 concentations36 118 119
correlate with renal flares and outcome. It should be emphasised, however, that these studies were not specifically designed
to evaluate the efficacy of various tests in monitoring response
to therapy of lupus nephritis. There are no randomised trials
evaluating the benefits from various monitoring strategies.
Lupus nephritis: treatment
The treatment of lupus nephritis often consists of a period of
intensive immunosuppressive therapy (induction therapy)
followed by a longer period of less intensive maintenance
therapy. In a recent Cochrane Review, CY plus steroids reduced
the risk for doubling of serum creatinine level compared with
steroids alone (RR = 0.6), but had no impact on overall
mortality.120 121 Azathioprine plus steroids reduced the risk for
all-cause mortality compared with steroids alone (RR = 0.6),
but had no effect on renal outcomes. CY was superior to
azathioprine and/or corticosteroids with high-dose, intermittent administration of CY (pulse therapy) demonstrating a
more favourable efficacy-to-toxicity ratio than oral CY.122 In a
long-term follow-up (median 11 years) of an RCT combination

therapy with glucocorticoids and CY demonstrated efficacy
(83% preserved renal function), without substantially increasing
the risk for adverse effects.123 Ovarian failure after CY therapy
remains a considerable problem and is both dose- and agedependent.124 Gonadal protection may be feasible with the use
of GnRH analogues, a finding that requires further confirmation.125
The efficacy of MMF as induction therapy has been assessed
in 4 RCTs, which concluded that MMF was associated with a
reduced risk for treatment failure (RR = 0.7) and for the
composite end point of death or ESRD (RR = 0.4) compared
with CY.126–129 The usefulness of MMF as a maintenance agent
has been assessed in a single RCT of 59 patients who received
induction therapy with boluses of IV-CY and glucocorticoids
and then were randomly assigned to IV-CY, oral azathioprine or
oral MMF for 1–3 years.130 The event-free survival rate for the
composite end point of death or ESRD was higher in the AZA
and MMF groups than in the CY group. There was a significantly higher incidence of sustained amenorrhoea in the CY group.
The committee recommends that physicians use MMF as
induction therapy for selected patients under close observation;
failure to achieve a significant response by 6 months at the
latest (defined as improvement of serum creatinine and
reduction of proteinuria to ,1 g/day131) should evoke discussions for intensification of therapy. For maintenance therapy,
MMF can be used in patients unable to tolerate azathioprine or
whose symptoms flare up while on treatment. Although data
with MMF are encouraging, in the opinion of the committee the
drug cannot replace at present the combination of intravenous
CY with intravenous MP as the treatment of choice for severe
lupus nephritis.123 Small, non-controlled trials with short
follow-up suggest that up to 50% of refractory patients to CY
may have a clinically significant response to rituximab, a
monoclonal antibody directed against B cells.132 133

Modern immunosuppressive therapies are effective, but none
of them cures lupus with approximately one-third of them
flaring after remission. Initial management of moderate to
severe flare requires induction therapy with immunosuppressive
agents, which usually prevent the loss of renal function.134 135
End-stage renal disease
Despite recent advances in therapy of lupus nephritis, a number
of patients may eventually progress to ESRD and will require
dialysis treatment or even kidney transplantation. Both dialysis
and transplantation in SLE have rates for long-term patient or
graft survival comparable with those in non-diabetic/non-SLE
patients.136–142 Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with
increased risk for thrombotic events, graft loss and poor
transplantation outcome.106 141 143 144 There is no evidence from
SLE-specific studies to support the superiority of either
treatment option. Nonetheless, two retrospective studies
including large numbers of patients with ESRD, have demonstrated superiority of renal transplantation over dialysis in
terms of long-term patient survival (relative risk 0.19–0.32 at
12–18 months post-transplant).145 146
DISCUSSION
An initial set of statements and recommendations regarding
important aspects of the management of SLE has been
developed, based on systematic review of the literature and
expert opinion with an excellent level of agreement among the
experts (average 8.8 out of 10). These recommendations should
facilitate the medical care of lupus patients without restricting
the autonomy of the provider physicians who have the ultimate
responsibility for the management.
Only a few RCTs have been performed to establish optimal
management of SLE, and several important issues have not been
adequately addressed. Furthermore, there are no RCTs to
evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and/or
primary prevention interventions focused on SLE patients.
These findings underscore the need to establish international
networks to facilitate clinical trials addressing management
issues and testing new therapies. To this end, the committee
proposes a Research Agenda for the years to come (table 3).
Establishing a diagnosis and managing patients with SLE
requires an integration of patient’s symptoms, physical examination findings and the results of diagnostic testing. In the case
of lupus, there are management issues with safety and financial
implications that have not been addressed. There is a need to
determine which laboratory tests should be performed at initial
presentation and during follow-up of SLE patients, and how
often. In the mean time, recommendations have to be based
solely on expert opinion. The committee recommends examination and laboratory monitoring every 3 months, in patients
who are doing well and more frequently for those with
uncontrolled disease.
Clinical practice recommendations require a framework to
assess their quality and to ensure that potential biases have been
adequately addressed and are valid and feasible for practice. To
this end, we used as a framework the Appraisal of Guidelines
Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument,147 which rates six
individual domains and 23 key items. Throughout the process,
we made a conscientious effort to comply with as many of these
as possible. Due to a paucity of strong data for several
management issues, the development of review criteria for
monitoring and/or audit purposes to measure the adherence to
the recommendations is not feasible at this point. Moreover, we
were not able to seek systematically patient views and
preferences. Following this first round of recommendations,
we intend to update them every 3 years with the inclusion of
patients and individuals from other relevant professions and the
development of tools that will facilitate the dissemination and
application of the recommendations.
