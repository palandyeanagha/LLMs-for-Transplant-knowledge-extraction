Acute liver failure (ALF) is the most common term applied to
an unusual clinical syndrome resulting from rapid loss in
hepatocyte function. It occurs infrequently, affecting 2000
patients annually in the United States, and comprises 7% of
liver transplants annually. ALF is the culmination of severe
liver cell injury from a variety of different causes, but it leads
to a relatively uniform clinical syndrome characterized by
encephalopathy and coagulopathy, the hallmark features.1
Because of its rarity, research in ALF has been limited to a
handful of large units or to collaborative networks such as the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored U.S. Acute Liver
Failure Study Group (ALFSG).
This review provides an overview of standard practices
and new research initiatives and findings for this interesting
but vexing orphan disease. Particular attention is paid to
practical matters for clinicians to consider in approaching the
ALF patient. Patients with ALF are supremely ill; the condition
carries a high mortality rate, and transplantation, while
lifesaving, is not always an option. Critical care of these
rare patients is key to their survival, and decisions must
sometimes be made with inadequate information. Experience
is probably a great teacher here, although ALF's rarity means
that few have in-depth experience with ALF patients.

Abstract Acute liver failure (ALF) (sometimes referred to as fulminant hepatic failure) is a clinical
syndrome from a variety of causes resulting from rapid loss in hepatocyte function,
typically associated with coagulopathy and encephalopathy in a patient without
preexisting liver disease or cirrhosis. Cerebral edema is a cardinal feature and may
produce uncal herniation, yielding brain stem compression and death. The typical
interval from onset of symptoms to onset of encephalopathy is 1 to 2 weeks, but cases
evolving more slowly, up to 6 months, may still be included in the definition. ALF is rare,
affecting 2000 patients annually in the United States, and comprises 7% of liver
transplants annually. Currently, in the United States, acetaminophen accounts for 50%
of all cases of ALF, but other etiologies include hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury,
autoimmune hepatitis. Prior to the availability of liver transplantation (LT), mortality of
ALF was extremely high, often exceeding 90%; most common causes of death were
multiorgan failure, hemorrhage, infection, and cerebral edema. Fortunately, survival has
improved considerably in the last 3 decades (overall survival now exceeds 60%). In large
part, this improved survival reflects the option of LT but also reflects the high frequency
of acetaminophen toxicity as a cause of ALF. In fact, most patients with ALF are not
candidates for LT. Critical care of patients with ALF is key to their survival, and decisions
must sometimes be made with inadequate information. We review standard practices
(medical, pharmacological, and LT) and new research initiatives and findings for this
interesting but vexing orphan disease. Particular attention will be paid to practical
matters for clinicians to consider in approaching the ALF patient.

coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR)  1.5] and
encephalopathy (any degree of altered mentation) in a patient without preexisting liver disease or cirrhosis.1 The
typical interval from onset of symptoms to onset of encephalopathy is 1 to 2 weeks, but cases evolving more slowly, up to
6 months, may still be included in the definition. A clinical
feature that is virtually unique to ALF is cerebral edema,
swelling of the brain, that may produce herniation of the
uncus through the falx cerebrum, yielding brain stem compression and death.2 The morbidity and mortality of ALF
recorded in small case series in the pretransplant era was
extremely high, often exceeding 90%, the causes of death
including multiorgan failure, hemorrhage, infection, and
cerebral edema. Fortunately, these dire outcomes have diminished somewhat due to a change in the causes of ALF to
more benign etiologies over the past 40 years as well as to the
introduction of liver transplantation.3,4 Patients have been
designated as hyperacute, acute, and subacute in presentation
depending on the interval from onset of disease to onset of
encephalopathy. Different etiologies typically have a specific
time frame. For example, acetaminophen cases are virtually
always hyperacute, whereas viral hepatitis, idiosyncratic
drug reactions, or indeterminate cause cases demonstrate
slower onset and evolution (acute or subacute).5 Whether
there is a distinct difference in outcome based on the length of
disease itself remains unclear; however, the etiologic diagnosis per se appears to be the strongest driver of outcome.2
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ALF must be considered in anyone presenting
with the recent onset of a hepatic illness where the prothrombin time/INR has become prolonged. Mental alterations are part of virtually all definitions and the changes may
be subtle, initially including agitation and confusion but
usually progressing to deeper coma grades. Recently, efforts
to develop more robust measures to define early encephalopathy grades have been proposed but are still not widely
used, and little has taken the place of the West Haven coma
grade1–4 system.6 Any mental alteration in conjunction with a
prolonged INR (>1.5), qualifies the patient as having ALF,
provided the person has had an illness of short duration and
does not have cirrhosis. With nondescript presenting symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed by the initial medical
contact. However, the combination of coagulopathy and
encephalopathy is unique and is only seen in this setting.
The presence of any degree of encephalopathy indicates a
severe, life-threatening condition that requires immediate
hospitalization. Patients are best managed within an intensive care setting, and specialty units devoted to acute liver
failure are available in the United Kingdom.3 Rapid evaluation
for transfer to a transplantation center and consideration for
liver transplantation is mandatory once any degree of mental
alteration occurs because disease progression is often very
rapid once cognition is disturbed.7
ALF has a common clinical picture, regardless of the
etiology, that represents the final pathway of acute organ
failure, different from cirrhosis but specific to one organ, the
liver. Patients appear to be relatively hypotensive and vasodilated with low systemic vascular resistance, a picture of
multisystem failure that resembles in some ways that of
gram-negative sepsis or end-stage liver disease patients;
however, portal hypertension and ascites are usually absent
except in subacute cases. Renal failure resembling hepatorenal syndrome may develop and is reversible with return of
hepatic function. Infection is unusually common in ALF,

presumably signifying the role of the liver in the host's innate
immune defenses.
Etiology
The causes of ALF are many and vary from country to country.
In the era prior to transplantation, hepatitis B was very
common and accounted for as many as 40 to 50% of US cases.
Prior to 1990, although a well-recognized problem in the
United Kingdom, acetaminophen did not account for more
than a few US ALF cases. Current US figures provided by the
ALFSG now show that acetaminophen-related ALF accounts
for nearly 50% of all cases, with hepatitis B responsible for only
7%.4,8,9 The etiologic breakdown in the United States (►Fig. 1)
is similar to that found in Europe but is far different in the
developing world, such as India, where drug-induced liver
injury is limited solely to isoniazid, and acetaminophen injury
is virtually unknown.10
After acetaminophen, the most common causes are druginduced liver injury (comprising largely idiosyncratic reactions to prescription drugs), autoimmune hepatitis, and a
variety of smaller groups. In many instances (15%), the
etiology remains unclear despite extensive history taking
and laboratory assessment; these are termed indeterminate.
Failure to obtain adequate history prior to onset of coma is
one reason for missing the cause of illness in this setting.
Regardless of the cause, the final common pathway is remarkably similar: worsening coma associated with a propensity for
bleeding, infection, and renal failure leads to poor overall
survival without transplantation.
Acetaminophen-Related Liver Injury
Although acetaminophen was approved for use in the 1950s,
hepatotoxicity leading to liver failure was not recognized in
significant numbers in the United States prior to 1980. With
the linking of aspirin to Reyes syndrome in children around
1980, Americans began turning to acetaminophen as a safer
alternative for children and adults. Cases were reported
during the 1980s of “therapeutic misadventures,” and the
association of unintended acetaminophen poisoning with
alcohol was made.11 Although true incidence studies were
(and are) not available, no large case series of ALF patients
included acetaminophen until a retrospective study from the
ALFSG, covering the period 1994 to 1996, found that 20% of
cases were related to acetaminophen.8 Similar data were
reported in 2000, in which 28% of transplant registry cases
were believed related to acetaminophen during a 13-year
retrospective study from the University of Pittsburgh.12
However, the US ALF study, in its first prospective analysis,
recorded 39% of all ALF cases as due to acetaminophen
between 1998 and 2001,3 increasing to 51% in 2004. These
figures represent the proportion of cases due to acetaminophen and may not be equated to actual incidence. Nevertheless, the increases are striking.
It is important to distinguish between considering all cases
entering the hospital with presumed acetaminophen overdose and the smaller subset that experiences ALF. Of 71
acetaminophen overdose patients admitted to Parkland Hospital over a 39-month period, 50 were considered suicidal,
with only one of 50 resulting in ALF and death, whereas six
deaths occurred among 21 unintentional overdoses.13 Only
the seven patients who died had developed acute hepatic
failure, and only 10 of 50 suicidal patients had aminotransferase levels  1000 IU/L. These data confirmed that most
suicidal patients typically receive medical care within 4 hours
of ingestion and are therefore reliably protected by the
acetaminophen antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). By contrast,
overdoses that are called accidental, or more accurately
unintentional, are associated with ingestion over several
days, a specific cause of pain, and denial of suicidal intent.
Late presentation is characteristic of the unintentional group
because there is no understanding of possible harm; medical
attention is sought only after symptoms of toxicity have
developed.

Unintentional Acetaminophen-Related Acute Liver
Failure
The US ALFSG has provided a more detailed snapshot of all
acetaminophen-related ALF cases,14 with particular attention
to the unintentional group. Thirty-eight percent of these
patients were simultaneously taking more than one acetaminophen-containing preparation, and 62% were taking an opioid
combination such as hydrocodone and acetaminophen. In
many instances, individuals are using alcohol, hypnotics, or
illicit drugs in combination, undoubtedly clouding judgment
and often delaying hospitalization. In a small number of cases,
habituation to the opioid compounds (up to 40 or more tablets
per day) may develop over days or weeks prior to onset of liver
injury, suggesting addiction to the narcotic component with
development of tolerance to the narcotic and to the acetaminophen. Those entering with severe hepatotoxicity have apparently exhausted their compensatory mechanisms. Tolerance
has been observed in animals fed increasing acetaminophen
doses.15 The events prior to presentation are often unclear, but
the biochemical picture (AST [aspartate aminotransferase]/ALT
elevations/bilirubin levels) in these “chronic” patients is just as
acute, suggesting that patients may tolerate both drugs, then
experience “breakthrough” for unclear reasons. It is possible
that fasting due to an intercurrent illness or simply increasing
the dose once too often brings this about. Because patients
with unintentional toxicity frequently exhibit signs of polysubstance abuse they may present to the hospital later and are
less likely to receive a liver transplant.
As might be expected, suicidal ingestions that eventuate in
ALF are associated with late presentation, alcohol or other
concomitant drugs that may cloud the sensorium and thus
delay presentation, and larger total doses, indicating more
serious intent rather than a gesture. Even with late presentation, NAC orally (and now available as an intravenous preparation, Acetadote, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
Nashville, TN) is used and provides reliable protection against
fatal injury, preventing a large number of deaths when given
within 12 hours of ingestion.16 Use after 24 hours is recommended, but efficacy cannot be proven for these late ingestions
because injury is developed by 36 hours, peaking by 72 hours.
Traditionally, acetaminophen poisoning carries a very good
prognosis, even if hepatic failure has developed. However, one
third of those reaching the threshold of encephalopathy still
die, and only 7 to 9% undergo transplantation.4 The spontaneous survival of the acetaminophen patients who develop
encephalopathy (64%) exceeds that for most other forms of
ALF, such as idiosyncratic drug toxicity, where survival without
transplantation is only 20%.14 Nevertheless, because of the
sheer number of cases, deaths due to acetaminophen toxicity
constitute the most frequent cause of death in our study.
Suicidal predilection or the history of previous suicide attempts, like substance abuse, will often preclude transplant
consideration. Once ALF develops, the outcome for either type
of overdose, suicidal or unintentional, is similar.
Other Issues Associated With Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen cases are all considered hyperacute, with time
from onset of jaundice to encephalopathy of 1 day versus
idiosyncratic drugs or viral hepatitis where longer intervals are
seen. ►Table 1 compares presenting and biochemical features
of acetaminophen versus idiosyncratic drug reactions and
other etiologic categories. As shown, acetaminophen ALF is
characterized by very high aminotransferase levels and low
bilirubins, whereas much lower aminotransferases and higher
bilirubin levels characterize the more slowly evolving pictures.
Recent studies from ALFSG and others highlight more
subtle issues surrounding acetaminophen. Using a recently
developed assay that reliably detects acetaminophen–containing protein adducts released into the plasma by dying
hepatocytes, 20% of both adult and pediatric ALF patients
with indeterminate etiology (no cause discerned after extensive investigation and testing) were found to be due to
unrecognized acetaminophen poisoning.17,18 Adducts are
not found with acetaminophen use unless there is toxicity
Elevated adduct levels strongly implicate acetaminophen as
the primary cause of the injury (►Fig. 2). The acetaminophen
adducts assay provides the smoking gun, evidence of specific
hepatocyte damage due to acetaminophen, when historical
data are lacking; 19% of the indeterminate group have levels
of adducts comparable to those observed in suicidal cases,
suggesting that a lack of history makes the case indeterminate.19 When the biochemical patterns of these indeterminate cases were analyzed, all cases fit the profile of high ALT,
low bilirubin observed in the known acetaminophen cases.
Insufficient data may result from patient obtundation, or
denial, whether purposeful or out of ignorance.
Whether acetaminophen dosing should be limited in the
presence of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis remains unclear.
A recent paper has questioned the use of 4 g/day as the
standard cutoff for acetaminophen maximum dosing,20 and a
recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel
recommended lowering the recommended daily dose of 4 g
and “unbundling” the opioid–acetaminophen compounds. To
date, the FDA has implemented a change to lower to 325 mg
the quantity of acetaminophen allowed in opioid combinations, and the industry is beginning to recommend lower
total daily doses.21,22
Idiosyncratic Drug Reactions
The developed world is particularly subject to rare ALF due to
idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI), because of the
large quantity of drugs we ingest. Still, prescription drugs are
remarkably safe; the combined number of idiosyncratic drug
cases thought to cause ALF in our series is dwarfed by the
single agent, acetaminophen. The presentation of DILI is more
subacute as shown in ►Table 1, with lower aminotransferases
and higher bilirubin levels. The likelihood of survival in this
setting is less than 30%, and they more often undergo liver
transplantation.23,24 Most frequently implicated drugs include antibiotics (most commonly antituberculous medications, but also sulfa drugs and others). Next most common are
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and anticonvulsants.
Viral Hepatitis
Cases of viral hepatitis that develop hepatic failure represent
a small fraction of all cases (1%) and largely consist of

hepatitis B, with hepatitis A less frequent and hepatitis E quite
prevalent in areas with poor sanitation. Hepatitis B that
presents with a fulminant picture may be due to new acute
infection or an acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B.25
Other Causes
A variety of other etiologies have been implicated from
autoimmune hepatitis (which may be difficult to diagnose),26
Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis), Wilson
disease,27 pregnancy-associated liver failure, and the rapid
evolution of metastatic or lymphomatous hepatic
infiltration.28
Indeterminate Cases
Despite our best efforts, in 15% of patients the diagnosis
eludes us. To date, we have found little evidence for other
viruses such as parvovirus B19, hepatitis E, herpesviruses
(there are a few cases, but not many), occult hepatitis B, or
other previously unrecognized viruses.29,30 Unrecognized
acetaminophen toxicity is clearly implicated, and there may
be unrecognized autoimmune disease as already noted.19,26
Clinical Management
The backbone of management of the ALF patient is good coma
care.5,6,31 However, some special features deserve mention.
Rapid evaluation and initiation of antidotes, where feasible,
are needed: NAC for acetaminophen poisoning, penicillin G
and silybinin for mushroom poisoning, and delivery of the
fetus in the cases of pregnancy-induced ALF are standard of
care. Early consideration should be made to use NAC in
nonacetaminophen settings. A multicenter, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of its use showed no benefit in
overall survival but improved outcomes at 3 weeks and at
1 year for those with early coma grades.32 All such trials are
compromised by the variety of etiologies and presentations
and the rescue provided by hepatic transplantation so that
survival of a large number of patients (those receiving liver
grafts) is greatly improved, but their true survival without
grafting is never known. Only those with ALF are given the
most urgent listing by the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS). In the NAC study, 50% of those who were considered
to have stage 3 or 4 encephalopathy on admission to study
reached an outcome (death or transplant) by study day 4,
Figure 2 Algorithm for triaging acute liver failure (ALF) patients. The initial step is to establish the diagnosis as ALF, then the etiology, and then
the severity. Time is of the essence if transplantation is an option. Patients may rapidly deteriorate, so frequent neurological checks and
consideration of intubation are indicated for any significant degree of drowsiness (coma grade 2+ or higher). Sedation is avoided in early coma
grades to allow for continued observation of central nervous system function.

emphasizing the severity of their condition and the availability of transplantation for many patients—40% ultimately were
transplanted. Once the diagnosis of ALF is confirmed (by the
finding of coagulopathy and encephalopathy in the setting of
acute hepatitis) and a careful search for etiology is undertaken (►Fig. 3), attention should be turned to consideration of
the need to list for transplantation. Controversial management issues that are commonly of concern include managing
the coagulopathy, whether intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is used, and the treatment of cerebral edema. By
establishing that the diagnosis is ALF and then determining
the etiology and severity-appropriate triage to an intensive
care unit or transfer to a transplant center can be rapidly
accomplished. Determining eligibility and listing for transplantation must be an early consideration because time is of
the essence.
Specific Therapies
The few therapies that are specific to an etiology emphasize the need for expedient determination of the cause of
illness (►Fig. 3). Hepatitis B causing ALF comprises both
true acute infection and acute-on-chronic infections. One
all too frequent scenario is the reactivation of chronic
hepatitis B in the setting of chemotherapy. This is common
in the United States but certainly also in Asia.33 Nucleoside
analogues have been suggested as treatment for ALF due to
hepatitis B. In the setting of planned chemotherapy, they
are mandated to protect against reactivation. Although
very effective as prophylaxis, there is no strong evidence
that their use, once ALF develops, improves outcomes. Still,
because transplantation is frequently required, nucleoside
analogues are routinely used for their posttransplant
prophylaxis effect.34
Cerebral Edema and the Role of Intracranial Pressure
Monitoring
Cerebral edema is the cause of death in several patients with
ALF but the actual percentage is unclear. Development of
brain swelling due to osmotic changes within the brain and
loss of capillary integrity occur more commonly in hyperacute settings and in young people, where adaptation to rapid
changes in brain glutamine levels cannot take place. Thus
acetaminophen patients, typically under age 35, are at highest risk for brain edema. High levels of arterial ammonia have
been shown to correlate well with development of cerebral
edema, further reinforcing the glutamine hypothesis.35–38 A
retrospective study of the impact of ICP monitoring in 332 ALF
patients suggested that use of ICP monitoring was center
dependent, reflecting, among other things, the confidence
level of the neurosurgeon because a burr hole is needed in the
skull and may be hazardous in the presence of severe coagulopathy. Patients in whom a monitor was placed generally
received more aggressive mannitol and other treatments
when evidence was available clinically of increased ICP levels,
and were more likely to be listed for transplantation, but
outcomes did not appear to differ in the two groups.39
Cardiovascular Tone and Its Management
Most patients with ALF demonstrate “warm shock”; that is,
profound vasodilation and low mean arterial pressures. In
addition, due to poor oral intake and encephalopathy prior to
admission, most are volume depleted and require initial fluid
resuscitation and possibly central venous pressure determinations to aid in this process. Use of pulmonary artery
catheters is seldom recommended. The renal hemodynamics
resemble those of the patient with hepatorenal syndrome in
cirrhosis: low systemic vascular resistance and renal artery
vasoconstriction that is potentially reversible with improvement in liver function. Patients with acetaminophen poisoning may demonstrate acute kidney injury due to direct toxic
effects of acetaminophen with oliguria requiring continuous
venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). The initial aim should be
volume resuscitation and, if the mean arterial pressure is <
80 mm Hg, support with pressor agents, the most effective of
which appears to be norepinephrine.6 In the setting of multiorgan failure, plasma troponin I levels are frequently elevated,
but the significance of this finding is unclear.40
Role of Coagulopathy in Acute Liver Failure
Severe alterations in nearly all clotting parameters are seen in
ALF in part due to failure of synthesis as well as factor
consumption. The classic interpretation has been that severe
bleeding is a likely outcome. Overall, however, there are
abnormalities in both the coagulation and the fibrinolytic
pathways, and recent data suggest that the defects are
balanced; that is, there is a relative preservation of hemostasis unless the platelet count is very low.41 The reason for low
platelet counts has not been elucidated—consumption may
play a role, whereas thrombopoietin is also made within the
liver. Thrombopoietin levels are not uniformly low and do not
appear to correlate with platelet levels.42 In general, fresh
frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, or platelets are reserved

for active bleeding or if an invasive procedure is planned.
There is little support for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in
this setting. Withholding FFP allows for the use of the INR as a
continuously available and reliable measure of hepatic synthetic function and outcome.
Prognosis
Determining prognosis in ALF is vital. Unlike cirrhosis, use of a
transplant in ALF would be unnecessary if the patient can
fully recover without a graft. If transplanted, lifelong immunosuppression is also the dividend. Prognostic scores specific
for ALF have been limited in efficacy; the most commonly
utilized is the King College Criteria (KCC).43 These and other
scoring systems to date have been relatively sensitive but not
specific, with fairly robust prediction of death but inability to
reliably determine who will survive. This may be because
more patients could recover if complications such as infection
did not occur. Two key factors involved in determining
outcome are etiology and coma grade on admission (►Figs.
3 and 4>). Acetaminophen, hepatitis A, ischemia, and pregnancy are all associated with at least 60% short-term survival
without transplantation, whereas DILI, hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, and indeterminate causes are associated with
30% spontaneous survival. Presenting with early coma
grade allows for a much more favorable outcome prediction
across all etiologies (►Fig. 4).
Role of Transplantation
There is no fully proven medical therapy for this devastating
clinical syndrome. Prior to 1980, ALF series demonstrated
survival in less than 10%. Small series of cases subjected to
new experimental treatments (e.g., heparin) showed that
occasionally patients do survive; however, controlled trials
were virtually impossible to perform. In this setting, transplantation seemed nothing short of a miracle. In the current
era, overall survival is 67%, a considerable improvement in
the last 3 decades. However, transplants are only performed
on 25 to 30% of patients admitted to the ALF study (►Fig. 5).
The reasons for the relatively infrequent use of liver grafting
include the difficulties in obtaining organs in an urgent
fashion, as well as the changing mix of etiologies. The change
from hepatitis B to a predominance of acetaminophen makes
up much of these differences because acetaminophen clearly
carries a better prognosis than most other etiologies and is
often associated with compromising psychosocial issues and
substance abuse.
Even in the transplant era, nearly 30% of patients die with
ALF. Reasons for the failure to transplant more patients have
included lack of available organs, late presentation with rapid
deterioration, substance abuse issues, repeated suicidal behavior, or other organ system involvement (malignancy, heart
failure) that would preclude grafting. Patients undergoing
transplantation for ALF are typically young and otherwise
healthy and thus should be quite optimal candidates compared with their cirrhosis counterparts. Nevertheless, shortterm and 1-year survival figures are below those for cirrhotic
patients, in part because of the extreme emergency conditions often encountered.44 There is no option for deferring
transplant in these patients. Similarly, living-related donors
might solve the organ shortage; however, it is extremely
difficult to prepare a donor adequately and perform the
surgery in a timely fashion. Few living related donors have
been used to date in adults with ALF, although this has gained
some traction in pediatric ALF where the graft size needed
can be quite small.45 Despite full physical recovery, many
patients who have experienced cerebral edema have mental
impairment that is lifelong. To date, few long-term data on
these complications are available.

according to coma grade (I, II vs III, IV). The percent above each pair indicates the overall percentage of spontaneous survival for that etiology.
There is a disparity between the etiologies with good survival and those with poor survival, but survival is much poorer in all categories if the
patient is admitted with an advanced coma grade.

New Therapies Undergoing Current Trial
To date, the NAC trial is one of the very few controlled trials in
ALF, and its results remain controversial.46 More recent
efforts have been directed toward reliable means to lower
ammonia levels. Neither lactulose nor rifaximin has been
shown to favorably affect outcomes or coma grade in ALF, but
they are still widely used. Surgeons discourage the use of
lactulose because it may lead to gaseous distension of the
colon, interfering with access to the surgical field. A blinded,
controlled trial performed in India sought to test the value of
L-ornithine L-acetate infusions in 203 patients with ALF, a
substance that would alter the balance of glutamate toward
glutamine in the circulation thus trapping ammonia, based on
animal studies.47 There appeared to be no benefit in patients
either in lowering ammonia or in improving outcomes,
perhaps because ammonia is regenerated by gut glutaminases.48 A new compound, ornithine phenyl acetate, is currently under consideration after several trials in experimental
animals.49,50
Hypothermia to protect brain function has also been
demonstrated in animals and humans to reliably lower ICP.
It is not routinely used at present, in part due to uncertainties
regarding its safety. The challenging logistics of performing
clinical trials in patients with ALF to evaluate hypothermia
has thus far defeated efforts to demonstrate its safety or
efficacy.
Bio-Artificial Liver Assist Devices
An artificial liver device that would replace the diverse
functions of the liver is an unmet need that seems far in
the future. Several groups have designed membrane-containing cartridges filled with hepatocytes from human cell
lines or animal donors, allowing plasma to flow by the cells.
Some improvement in encephalopathy has been observed,
but no real improvement could be demonstrated in overall
survival in a controlled trial.51,52 A recent meta-analysis
further demonstrated the scarcity of data and the lack of
convincing efficacy.53 Several centers have experimented
with extracorporeal transgenic pig livers or cadaver livers
deemed unfit for transplantation, but these techniques have
not gained general acceptance.54,55 Finally, early experimentation is under way using infusions of hepatic stem cells that
are said to be nonimmunogenic56; this remains highly
experimental.
Summary
ALF challenges our best clinical and surgical skills because of
its rarity, rapid progression, and frequently poor outcomes.
The small numbers of patients do not readily lend themselves
to controlled trials and are studied only with great difficulty.
Nevertheless, descriptive information aids our understanding
of what to expect and where small gains might be made in
Figure 5 Outcomes for 1696 patients enrolled in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group study. Only 39% are listed for transplantation, and 24%
receive a graft.

this condition. Patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, bleeding, and cerebral edema and seek medical care
typically with very advanced hepatic injury. It is unlikely that
there is one overall therapy that will improve hepatic function and restore hepatocyte mass in this condition. Rescue
therapies that provide temporary liver support, or other
treatments short of transplantation that don’t enhance hepatic regeneration, are likely to fail unless there is reconstitution of functional hepatic stem cells. Most of our efforts in
treating ALF in 2011 should be directed toward ameliorating
the damage in various etiologic categories. Possible targets
might include, for acetaminophen, further education regarding the risk of acetaminophen causing liver injury, and
limitation of exposure for over-the-counter use.
