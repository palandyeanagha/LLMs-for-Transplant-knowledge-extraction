Exposed surfaces of mammals are colonized with 100 trillion indigenous bacteria, fungi, and
viruses, creating a diverse ecosystem known as the microbiome. The gastrointestinal tract
harbors the greatest numbers of these microorganisms, which regulate human nutrition,
metabolism, and immune system function. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota contains
pro- and anti-inflammatory products that modulate immune responses and may play a role
in maintaining gut barrier function. Therefore, the community composition of the microbiota
has profound effects on the immune status of the host and impacts the development and/or
progression of inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, numerous studies have shown differences in the microbiota of patients with and without a given inflammatory condition.
There is now strong evidence that the gut microbiome regulates bone homeostasis in
health and disease, and that prebiotic and probiotics protect against bone loss. Herein, the
evidence supporting the role of the microbiota and the effects of prebiotic and probiotics will
be reviewed.
Exposed surfaces of mammals are colonized
with 100 trillion indigenous bacteria, fungi,
and viruses, creating a diverse ecosystem known
as the microbiota (Tremaroli and Backhed 2012;
Sommer and Backhed 2013). The microbiome
consists of the genes these cells harbor (Turnbaugh et al. 2007). The gastrointestinal tract
harbors the greatest numbers of these microorganisms, which regulate human nutrition, metabolism, and immune system function. The
gut microbiota holds ten times more bacterial
cells than human cells in the body, and possess
five million genes. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota contains pro- and anti-inflammatory
products that modulate immune responses
(Surana and Kasper 2014) and may play a role
in maintaining gut barrier function. Therefore,
the community composition of the microbiota
has profound effects on the immune status of
the host and impacts the development and/or
progression of inflammatory diseases. Microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract starts
at birth and leads to the establishment of a diverse community by early adulthood (Eckburg
et al. 2005). Gut luminal bacteria beneficially
influence tissue homeostasis in the intestine
by enhancing epithelial cell proliferation and
survival, and strengthening barrier function
(Madsen et al. 2001; Ismail and Hooper 2005;
Wentworth et al. 2011a; Jones et al. 2013; Alam
et al. 2014, 2016). Indeed, mice raised in germfree conditions show many functional weakEditors: Gerard Karsenty and David T. Scadden

nesses (Stappenbeck et al. 2002) and have impaired homeostasis (Pull et al. 2005).
The gut microbiome of humans and mice
are quantitatively different but share a large
qualitatively similar core (Krych et al. 2013).
Because of these qualitative similarities, mice are
extensively used to investigate the role of the
microbiota in health and disease (Krych et al.
2013).
Numerous studies have shown differences in
the microbiota of patients with and without a
given inflammatory condition (Surana and Kasper 2014), although, in some cases, it remains
unclear whether the observed dysbiosis is the
cause or consequence of the underlying disease
process (Surana and Kasper 2014). In addition,
at least two metabolic diseases, obesity and diabetes, have been shown to have major determinants from the gut microbiome. In addition,
alterations in the human microbiome are associated with various disease states. For example,
decreased abundance of lactobacillus in the vaginal microbiome is associated with bacterial
vaginosis (Ravel et al. 2011), and may also be
associated with preterm labor (DiGiulio et al.
2015). Changes in the oral microbiome are associated with periodontal disease (Wang et al.
2013), and new associations with systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (Scher et al.
2012) and cardiovascular disease are hypothesized. The skin microbiome is important in the
development of atopic dermatitis and in the
delayed wound healing that is a complication
of diabetes (Grice et al. 2010). The gut microbiome the largest, richest, and most complex of
the human microbiomes and is correspondingly the most well characterized and most investigated for disease associations. Gut microbes have
been shown to modulate intestinal and systemic
immune responses (Surana and Kasper 2014).
For instance, gut-resident microbes have a robust influence on the emergence and/or maintenance of CD4þ T-cell subsets. Examples include the effects of specific bacteria on the
emergence of T helper (Th)17 cells (Ivanov et
al. 2009) and the impact of Bacteroides fragilis in
Th1 cells and Tregulatory (Treg) differentiation
(Mazmanian and Kasper 2006). Changes in the
gut microbiome are associated with risk for and
progression of inflammatory bowel disease
(Gevers et al. 2014), risk for colorectal cancer
(Momozawa et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2013), obesity (Turnbaugh et al. 2009), glucose control,
and diabetes risk (Karlsson et al. 2013), and
may even serve as a reservoir for antimicrobial
resistance genes (Penders et al. 2013). However,
more intriguing is evidence that the commensal microbes also influence immune responses
distant from mucosal surfaces, including the
central nervous system (CNS), joints, and lungs
(Noverr et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2010; Lee et al.
2011; Surana and Kasper 2014). Involved
mechanisms include regulation of nutrient absorption, regulation of intestinal barrier function and the resulting translocation of bacterial
particles across the intestinal wall, and regulation of the immune response in the intestine
systemically.
In the last 5 years, evidence has also emerged
that the microbiota regulates bone homeostasis
in health and disease. Multiple hypotheses have
been postulated to explain how the microbiome
affects bone (Hernandez et al. 2016). First, the
response of the immune system to the microbiome results in the production of a variety of
circulating cytokines and cell-based immune
effectors that have profound effects on bone
cells. Gut microbiota promotes bone formation,
likely via an insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-
mediated mechanism (Schwarzer et al. 2016;
Yan et al. 2016). The microbiome might also
affect levels of steroid hormones, parathyroid
hormone (PTH), or vitamin D metabolites
(Charles et al. 2015). Moreover, bacterial products may enter the circulation and directly influence bone cell function.
DEFINITIONS AND KEY INVESTIGATIVE
METHODOLOGIES
Nearly all environments harbor distinct microbiomes, including the microenvironments of
the human body. Although it has long been hypothesized that the human microbiome plays a
key role in susceptibility to adverse health outcomes, it is only with recent technologies that
comprehensive study is possible. Culture-based
techniques still remain a foundational techR. Pacifici

nique in microbiology. However, many community members of the human microbiome
cannot be cultured (Wade 2002). Because of
this technical limitation, the diversity of the human microbiome has remained unknown until
recently. Two key advances have enabled a more
complete census of the human microbiome.
The first advance that has made possible to
define the human microbiome was an application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
technology, which exploited features of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) gene. This
gene is comprised of constant, conserved regions, which flank variable regions. PCR primers that anneal to the constant regions can amplify the internal variable region from a diverse
set of bacteria (Lane et al. 1985). These variable
regions were sequenced and matched to a database to identify the organisms present. Recently,
this DNA-based, culture-independent method
gained substantial discriminating power when
coupled to next-generation sequencing technology, which has the ability to sequence a population of PCR amplicons in a single experiment
with single-molecule resolution (Shendure and
Ji 2008). 16S-based sequencing is rapid and inexpensive enough to be applied to populationbased samples, and thus can be applied to (for
example) case-control studies, or can be used to
record longitudinal changes in microbiomes
over time. This has created an explosion of
data characterizing the microbiome, human
and otherwise, with a vast array of applications
from forensic science to translational health opportunities and beyond.
To impose order on the chaos of this data
explosion, and encourage the development of
companion bioinformatics tools necessary for
data processing and analysis, two consortia were
evolved. The European MetaHIT consortium
was focused on the gut microbiome and its
role in adverse health outcomes, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (Qin et al.
2010). In the United States, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was supported by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common
Fund. In contrast to the MetaHIT consortium,
the HMP focused on characterizing the healthy
human microbiome, and creating a publicly
available reference set of control data (NIH
HMP Working Group et al. 2009; Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012). The HMP
sought to characterize five major human microbiome communities: the airway, skin, oral, gut,
and vaginal microbiomes. Landmark studies
from the HMP confirmed that different human
microenvironments harbor distinct characteristic microbiomes that differ in a diversity and
community membership.
Another critical advance has been the development of techniques for raising mice in germfree conditions. These animals are kept for the
entire life in sterile isolators or individual sterile
cages. Germ-free animals have several phenotypical abnormalities, including the presence
of abnormal intestinal villi. Importantly,
germ-free mice have an altered immune system
resulting from the chronic lack of antigenic
stimulation. For example, lymph nodes, spleens,
and Peyer’s patches of germ-free mice are relatively inactive. The tissues are small and contain
rare, small, and indistinct germinal zones.
Moreover, germ-free mice have fewer T cells,
and effector T cells skewed toward a Th2 phenotype (Surana and Kasper 2014). Colonization
of germ-free mice with wild-type microbiota or
defined bacteria quickly reverses most of the
phonetical and immunological abnormalities
of germ-free mice, pointing to the role of microbiota in shaping intestinal and immune physiology. The immune system is stimulated by metabolites released by the gut flora and by direct
interactions between immune cells and microorganisms (Belkaid and Hand 2014). Once activated in the intestine, immune cells are likely
to migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs, including the bone marrow.
MICROBIOTA AND BONE DENSITY

Perhaps more intriguing than the capacity of a
local microbiota to induce alterations in contiguous mucosal surfaces is evidence that the
commensal microbes also influence immune
responses distant from mucosal surfaces, inBone Remodeling and the Microbiome

cluding the CNS, joints, and lungs (Noverr et al.
2005; Wu et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2011; Surana and
Kasper 2014). Involved mechanisms include
regulation of nutrient absorption, intestinal
barrier function and the resulting translocation
of bacterial particles across the intestinal wall,
and activation of the immune response in the
intestine and systemically. Recently, evidence
has also emerged that the microbiota regulates
bone homeostasis in health and disease. Multiple hypotheses have been postulated to explain
how the microbiome affects bone (Hernandez
et al. 2016). First, the response of the immune
system to the microbiome results in the production of a variety of circulating cytokines and
cell-based immune effectors that have profound
effects on bone cells. Gut microbiota promotes
bone formation likely via an IGF-1-mediated
mechanism (Schwarzer et al. 2016; Yan et al.
2016). The microbiome might also affect levels
of steroid hormones, PTH, or vitamin D metabolites (Charles et al. 2015). Moreover, bacterial products may enter the circulation and directly influence bone cell function.
Initial investigations by Sjogren et al. (2012)
revealed that female germ-free mice have higher
cortical and trabecular bone mass compared
with control mice raised in conventional conditions. Germ-free mice had fewer CD4þ T cells
and osteoclast precursors in the bone marrow,
had lower levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines,
and, at 9 weeks of age, the trabecular bone mass
of germ-free mice was 39% higher than that of
controls. Importantly, the high bone mass and
the immune abnormalities of germ-free mice
were reversed by reconstitution of the gut microbiota with flora from conventionally raised
microbial-replete mice (Sjogren et al. 2012).
Corroborating these observations, we found
that 20-week-old female germ-free C57Bl/6
mice have higher trabecular bone volume than
congenic age-matched mice raised in conventional conditions (Li et al. 2016). Furthermore,
germ-free mice had increased femoral cortical
volume compared with conventionally raised
mice (Li et al. 2016). Surprisingly, opposite effects were reported in a study conducted in 8-
week-old germ-free BALB/c male mice. These
mice were found to have lower cortical and trabecular volume as compared with congenic
conventionally raised mice (Schwarzer et al.
2016). Mechanistic studies revealed that in
male BALB/c mice the microbiota confers higher sensitivity to the bone anabolic growth factor
IGF-1 (Schwarzer et al. 2016). These findings
indicate that mouse strain, age, and sex influence the impact of the microbiome on bone
mass. Another possibility is the presence different microbiomes among mouse strains. Adding
further complexity to this issue, bacterial colonization of adult CB6F1 mice was found to
stimulate bone resorption and decrease bone
mass in the first 4 weeks after colonization
(Yan et al. 2016). However, long-term colonization leads to an equalization of bone mass, indicating that duration of colonization is another
critical variable that influences bone turnover
and bone mass (Yan et al. 2016). To determine
whether endogenous microbiota contributes to
the regulation of bone remodeling under baseline homeostatic conditions, the same investigators treated conventionally raised mice with
antibiotics. The resulting depletion of the microbiota was associated with an increase in bone
mass and a decrease in bone turnover (Yan et al.
2016), confirming that in a short-term setting
the ablation of the microbiota increases bone
mass, whereas reconstitution of the microbiota
in former germ-free mice causes bone loss.
These studies are in apparent conflict with a
serious of investigations conducted to analyze
the effect of malnourishment on body growth
and skeletal development. Analysis of stool
samples from children from Malawi with severe
malnutrition revealed the presence of an immature microbiome. Colonization of germ-free
mice with such immature microbiomes resulted
in suboptimal body growth and shorter bones,
whereas germ-free mice on the same diet given
“mature” microbiomes of healthy children underwent normal body growth (Blanton et al.
2016). Surprisingly, colonization of germ-free
mice with stools from malnourished children
caused an increased in cortical bone density
(Blanton et al. 2016). Germ-free mice colonized
with stools from healthy 6-month-old children
acquired a higher bone density than those colonized with stools from healthy 18-month-old

children (Blanton et al. 2016), further suggesting that immature microbiota induces bone
anabolism.
In a similar investigation, the blunted skeletal development of germ-free mice was partially reversed by colonization with selected lactobacilli (Schwarzer et al. 2016). Another study
revealed that sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are significantly less abundant in the milk of mothers with severely malnourished infants (Charbonneau et al. 2016).
HMOs are not significant nutrients for humans,
but gut bacteria use HMOs as an energy source.
Colonization of germ-free micewith stools from
6-month-old stunted Malawian infants resulted
in blunted body growth. Feeding the colonized
mice with HMOs produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain,
and altered liver, muscle, and brain metabolism
in ways indicative of a greater ability to use
nutrients for anabolism (Charbonneau et al.
2016). Among the changes induced by HMOs
supplementation was an increase in bone volume (Charbonneau et al. 2016), indicating that
positive modification of the microbiota induced
by a prebiotic substance stimulates bone growth.
Together, these studies show that changes in the
microbiota independently regulate bone growth
and bone mass acquisition.
Evidence for the critical influence of the gut
microbiota on bone growth is supported by
studies that used antibiotic treatment of mice.
Initial investigations revealed that short-term
administration of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics at weaning resulted in elevated levels of
bone mass (Cho et al. 2012). Corroborating results were generated in a study showing that a
low dose of penicillin from birth to weaning
increases bone mass in adult mice (Cox et al.
2014). More recently, investigations confirmed
that reduction of intestinal bacteria by vancomycin treatment increases bone mass (Yan et al.
2016). In addition, administration of a cocktail
of tetracyclines was found to prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss (Williams et al. 1996).
Some antibiotic studies revealed unexpected
differences on the bone response to microbiota
reduction in male and female mice (Cox et al.
2014). Moreover, an increase in bone density in
response to antibiotics was more consistently
observed in young animals (Cho et al. 2012;
Nobel et al. 2015). Intriguingly, low-dose antibiotics are commonly fed to chicken, cows, and
pigs to increase size and body weight, and it
would be interesting to determine how much
of the increased weight gain is the result of increases in bone density (Cromwell 2002). At any
rate, these studies clearly show that antibiotic
treatment influences bone mass. Because antibiotics lower the number of bacteria, and/or
alter the diversity of microbial taxa within the
intestinal lumen, it can be inferred that the bacterial load and diversity within the gut are significant, contributing variables to the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates
bone mass.
It is also known that considerable variation
exists in the microbiome of mice housed in different facilities and/or fed different types of
chow (Ericsson et al. 2015; Laukens et al.
2016; Stappenbeck and Virgin 2016). Therefore,
the diversity of the microbiome in the particular
facility is a potential confounding factor to data
interpretation when assessing the influences of
the microbiome on bone density. For example,
at sacrifice, the trabecular bone volume of the
conventionally raised mice used in our studies
was .50% of that of the BALB/c male mice
used by Schwarzer et al. (2016). Further attesting to the relevance of local housing conditions,
in preliminary studies, we found C57Bl/6 mice
purchased from Jackson Laboratory to have a
higher bone volume than isogenic mice bought
from Taconic Biosciences. However, following 4
weeks of cohousing in our animal facility, the
bone volume of mice from Jackson Laboratory
decreased to the level of that of Taconic Biosciences mice. Because mice are coprophagic, and
transfer their microbiomes from mouse to
mouse by this behavior, the bone density decrease observed in mice from the Jackson Laboratory is perhaps the result of colonization of
Jackson Laboratory mice with fecal material
from Taconic Biosciences mice. These observations clearly point to the critical need to account
for reciprocal host–microbiome interactions in
experimental approaches that investigate the
microbiome and bone density.

Microbiota and the Bone Loss Induced by Sex
Steroid Deficiency
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a common
skeletal disease leading to fracture and disability
that stems from the cessation of ovarian function at menopause and from genetic and nongenetic factors that heighten the impact of estrogen deficiency on the skeleton (Riggs and
Melton 1983, 1986). Fractures caused by osteoporosis have devastating consequences, particularly in the elderly. Vertebral fractures are a
source of significant pain and crippling, whereas hip fractures lead to mortality rates of 24% –
30% in the first year alone. Furthermore, almost
50% of survivors suffer permanent disability
(Cummings and Melton 2002; Johnell and Kanis 2006; Lewis et al. 2006; Burge et al. 2007).
Declining estrogen levels at menopause results
in a potent stimulation of bone resorption and,
to a lesser extent, bone formation leading to a
period of rapid bone loss (Zaidi 2007). This
initial phase is followed by a slower but more
prolonged period of bone loss that affects mostly the cortical compartment of the skeleton.
Androgen deficiency also results in reduced trabecular and cortical bone density (Finkelstein
et al. 1987). Androgen receptor signaling contributes to the maintenance of trabecular and
cortical bone (Venken et al. 2006). Furthermore, men with complete androgen insensitivity have diminished bone density, confirming
the obligatory role for androgens in the maintenance of bone density in men (Sobel et al.
2006). However, it is now clear that androgens
regulate bone homeostasis in men mostly via
their peripheral conversion to estrogen (Finkelstein et al. 2016) and that estrogen deficiency
has a dramatic effect on bone homeostasis in
men (Bilezikian et al. 1998; Fink et al. 2006).
In female mice, the acute effects of sex steroid
deficiency are modeled by ovariectomy (ovx), or
treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GN-RH) agonists (Kurabayashi et al.
1993; Wang et al. 2000).
At the cellular level, the central mechanism
by which sex steroid deficiency induces bone
loss is an increase in osteoclast formation (Sun
et al. 2006; Weitzmann and Pacifici 2006) and
osteoclast life span (Nakamura et al. 2007; Krum
et al. 2008). The primary driver of increased
osteoclastogenesis is the enhanced production
of the immune factors receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Pacifici 2012; Khosla and
Pacifici 2013). Therefore, sex steroid –dependent bone loss is regarded as a form of inflammatory bone loss (Weitzmann and Pacifici 2006;
Khosla and Pacifici 2013). Many cell types have
been shown to be generators of RANKL, including hemopoietic cells, T cells, B cells, osteoblastic cells, and osteocytes (Eghbali-Fatourechi et
al. 2003; Taxel et al. 2008; Xiong et al. 2011). In
the mouse, osteocytes are probably the most
relevant source of RANKL in estrogen-deficient
mice (Xiong et al. 2011). In humans, estrogen
deficiency is associated with an expansion of
RANKL and TNF-expressing T cells and B cells
(Eghbali-Fatourechi et al. 2003; D’Amelio et al.
2008; Taxel et al. 2008; Adeel et al. 2013). The
contributing influences of interleukin (IL)-1
and TNF in humans was underscored by reports
showing that menopause increases the levels
of both of these immune factors (Pacifici et
al. 1989, 1991; Cohen-Solal et al. 1993; Bernard-Poenaru et al. 2001), whereas treatment
with TNF and IL-1 inhibitors prevents the increase in bone resorption that results from estrogen deficiency (Charatcharoenwitthaya et al.
2007). Indeed, the causal role of TNF in ovxinduced bone loss in mice has been shown in
multiple models (Ammann et al. 1997; Kimble
et al. 1997; Roggia et al. 2001), in which the key
mechanisms by which TNF stimulates bone resorption were identified as the potentiation of
RANKL activity (Cenci et al. 2000; Lam et al.
2000) and induction of Th17 cells (Chen et al.
2011; Sugita et al. 2012; Li et al. 2015). Th17 cells
are an osteoclastogenic population of CD4þ
cells (Sato et al. 2006; Miossec et al. 2009) defined by the capacity to produce IL-17 (Basu
et al. 2013). Th17 cells potently induce osteoclastogenesis by secreting IL-17A, RANKL, TNF,
IL-1, and IL-6, along with low levels of interferon g (IFN-g) (Jovanovic et al. 1998; Waisman
2011; Komatsu and Takayanagi 2012). IL-17A
stimulates the release of RANKL by all osteoblastic cells, including osteocytes (Kotake et al.
R. Pacifici

1999; Li et al. 2015), and increases the osteoclastogenic activity of RANKL by up-regulating
RANK (Adamopoulos et al. 2010). Intriguingly,
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
show elevated levels of serum IL-17 (Molnar
et al. 2014a,b; Zhang et al. 2015). In mice, ovx
expands Th17 cells by promoting the differentiation of naı¨ve CD4þ cells into mature Th17
cells (Tyagi et al. 2012a), a phenomenon driven
by cytokines such as transforming growth factor
b (TGF-b), IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF (Veldhoen
et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2011; Sugita et al. 2012;
Basu et al. 2013), factors that are all dysregulated
by estrogen deficiency (Pacifici 2012). In addition, Th17 differentiation is inhibited by estrogen via a direct effect on CD4þ T cells mediated
by estrogen receptor (ER)a (Lelu et al. 2011).
The importance of IL-17 in bone loss is highlighted by the fact that silencing of IL-17R (DeSelm et al. 2012) or treatment with anti-IL-17
antibody (Tyagi et al. 2014) prevent ovx-induced bone loss.
Evidence now suggests that T-cell-produced
TNF functions in a pivotal role in the mechanism of ovx-induced bone loss based on the
finding that no bone loss occurred, and no increased TNF production was detected in T-cellnull mice, or mice depleted of T cells (Cenci
et al. 2000; Li et al. 2011). Furthermore, bone
loss did not occur in mice lacking T-cell TNF
production (Cenci et al. 2000; Roggia et al. 2001;
Gao et al. 2004, 2007), or lacking the costimulatory molecule CD40L (Li et al. 2011), as well as
mice treated with CTLA4-Ig, an agent that
transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells (Grassi
et al. 2007). These findings have been confirmed
by other laboratories (Yamaza et al. 2008; Tyagi
et al. 2012b). Moreover, symmetrical evidence is
emerging from human studies in favor of a role
for T-cell-produced TNF in postmenopausal
bone loss (D’Amelio et al. 2008; Adeel et al.
2013). Mechanistically, ovx induces proliferation of conventional T cells via an antigen-dependent process (Cenci et al. 2003; Grassi et al.
2007) thereby increasing the number of CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells in the bone marrow (BM) and
enhancing their production of TNF (Roggia
et al. 2001; Li et al. 2011). This process is driven
by enhanced antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells (Cenci et al. 2003;
Grassi et al. 2007), although the nature of the
involved antigen remains unknown.
Because the T cells of ovx mice have features
that resemble those of T cells exposed to bacteria
(Surh and Sprent 2008), it is plausible that increased exposure to microorganisms provides
the antigens required for T-cell activation and
ensuing systemic immune responses required
for sex steroid –deficiency-induced bone loss.
This hypothesis was tested in a study using
mice raised in germ-free conditions. Mice raised
in conventional conditions and germ-free mice
colonized with the microbiota of conventional
microbial-replete mice, were used as control
groups. In addition, because ovx is not technically feasible in germ-free conditions, sex steroid
deficiency was induced pharmacologically using
the GN-RH agonist leuprolide. This investigation revealed that germ-free mice are entirely
protected against the loss of trabecular bone induced by sex steroid deprivation (Fig. 1) (Li et al.
2016). Importantly, colonization of germ-free
mice with flora from conventionally raised animals led to bone loss in response to sex steroid
deprivation, showing that the protection of
germ-free mice against bone loss is not caused
by intrinsic, irreversible immune abnormalities
conferred by the germ-free status. In contrast,
leuprolide treatment resulted in a similar loss
of cortical bone in all tested groups of conventional bacterial-replete mice, indicating that sex
steroid deprivation induces cortical bone loss
that occurs by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (Li et al. 2016). This is probably because
of the fact that T cells reside in the proximity of
trabecular and endosteal surfaces (Fujisaki et al.
2011), but have no contacts with periosteal surfaces and have limited capacity to communicate
with osteocytes. Further attesting to the role of
the microbiota as regulator of bone turnover,
leuprolide increased bone resorption in conventional and colonized mice, but not in germfree mice. In addition, germ-free sex steroid –
depleted mice had lower rates of compensatory
bone formation than conventional sex steroid –
depleted mice (Li et al. 2016).

IL-17-producing T cells and increases the levels
of TNF, RANKL, and in the bone marrow and
small intestine of conventionally raised mice. In
contrast, in germ-free mice, no increase in TNF,
RANKL, and IL-17 production occurred in the
bone marrow or in the tissues of the small intestine following sex steroid deficiency (Li et al.
2016). Overall, the data showed that the microbiota is required for sex steroid deprivation to
induce bone loss. Moreover, the data indicated
that this may occur as a result of the gut microbiome driving the expansion of intestinal T cells
and Th17 cells, which produce TNF, RANKL,
and IL-17.
It is still unclear whether the bone loss is
induced by cytokines produced by immune
cells in gut, which then circulate to the bone,
induced by immune cells activated in the gut
that traffic to the bone marrow, or induced by
bone marrow cells that are activated by foreign
antigens of intestinal origin. Bacterial translocation, the passage of viable bacteria across the
intestinal wall into the systemic circulation is a
recognized phenomenon, although very rare in
healthy individuals (O’Boyle et al. 1998). Because live bacteria are unlikely to travel far
from the intestine, it is unlikely that activation
of immune cells in the bone marrow is caused by
direct exposure to bacteria or bacterial particles.
Based on preliminary cell migration studies, it
appears likely that immune cells, first activated
in the intestine, home to the bone marrow
where they produce osteoclastogenic cytokines.
The Influence of Gut Permeability
on Bone Loss
The intestinal epithelium is the interface between the mammalian host and the luminal
microbiota. The intestine controls molecular
trafficking between the lumen and the epithelial submucosa through paracellular space,
which under physiological conditions exclude
the passage of molecules with a radius of
.15 A˚ (3.5 kDa for oligopeptides) (Fasano
2012). The intestinal wall is in intimate contact
with the gut luminal microbiota and constantly
samples and responds to the antigenic load
within the intestinal lumen (McDole et al.
2012). Increased permeability allows an expanded range of molecules and potential antigenic load to enter epithelial submucosa, which
may initiate aberrant intestinal and systemic
proinflammatory responses (Hijazi et al. 2004;
Fasano 2012; Heyman et al. 2012; Teixeira et al.
2012). Thus, maintaining a tight selective physiological barrier between the gut lumen and
submucosa is essential for health. This is critical in the context of bone homeostasis because
osteoclastogenic cytokines are produced by immune cells that reside in intestinal subepithelial
compartments of the intestine, and any change
in gut permeability is thus likely to elevate levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines and influence
bone density.

Recent studies have shown that sex steroid
deficiency increases gut permeability thus weakening barrier integrity (Raehtz et al. 2014; Li
et al. 2016), leading to increased bacterial translocation and increased levels of inflammatory
markers (Fig. 2). Specifically, sex steroid deficiency results in reduced transcript levels of a
number of the gap junction proteins of the claudin family such as claudin 2, 3, and 15, and of
JAM3, which have all been shown to modulate
intestinal barrier integrity (Zeissig et al. 2007;
Ulluwishewa et al. 2011). Also, serum endotoxin
levels, which correlate with gut permeability, are
elevated in sex steroid –deprived mice. Furthermore, ovx mice have higher levels of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran in their serum,
which is a standard assay for gut permeability,
confirming that the intestinal barrier permeability is compromised following sex steroid depletion. Together, these reports suggest that increased gut permeability caused by sex steroid
depletion results in an increased antigenic load
entering the epithelial submucosa, thereby initiating the activation of immune cells and the
local production of osteoclastogenic cytokines.
Because sex steroids have been inferred to function in maintaining a tight physiological barrier
between the systemic tissue compartments and
the resident flora of the gut lumen (Wada-Hiraike et al. 2006), depleted levels of sex steroids
would thereby increase gut permeability. This
notion offers a solid link between a weakened
intestinal barrier and the signature osteoclastogenic cytokine profile associated with osteoporosis. Moreover, any therapeutic approach
that can tighten gut permeability would offer a
promising therapy for preventing sex steroid –
depletion-induced bone loss.
The Influence of Probiotic Therapy on Bone
Mass and Bone Turnover
Numerous drugs are currently Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, most cases in the United States remain untreated or ineffectively treated because of cost
and/or adverse events of currently available
drugs, leading to inadequate prescriptions of
and poor compliance with anti-osteoporosis
medications (Jha et al. 2015; Khosla and Shane
2016). For example, despite clear efficacy of bisphosphonate drugs in the secondary prevention
of hip fracture, a recent large study in patients
with hip fracture found that use of bisphosphonates decreased from an already dismal 15% in
2004 to an abysmal 3% in 2013 (Kim et al.
2016), most likely because the available anti-osteoporotic drugs cause a variety of adverse outcomes. Some of these, like osteonecrosis of the

Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation of the effects of sex steroid deficiency on gut permeability. In physiologic
conditions, proteins of the JAMs and claudin family seal the space between intestinal epithelial cells preventing
bacteria and bacterial products from penetrating the intestinal wall and activating immune cells. Sex steroid
deprivation down-regulates the expression of gap junction proteins, leading to increased gut permeability. The
resulting increased bacterial translocation induces a local and systemic immune response that causes an increased production of osteoclastogenic cytokines. Probiotic supplementation up-regulates expression of claudins and JAMs, thus restoring normal gut barrier function.

jaw and atypical subtrochanteric fractures, may
result from decreased rates of bone resorption.
Safety concerns with teriparatide limit its use to
24 months. Drugs under development also have
significant concerns. Odanacatib, a cathepsin K
inhibitor, was recently abandoned by its manufacturer because of an increased incidence of
cerebral vascular accidents. Romosozumab, an
antisclerostin antibody, only transiently stimulates bone formation and appears to behave
subsequently like an antiresorptive agent. Abaloparatide, a parathyroid hormone – related
protein (PTHrP) analog, is similar in its actions
and route of administration to teriparatide and,
like the latter, will be limited to use for no more
than 2 years. These data underscore the critical
need to identify inexpensive, safe, and effective
interventions for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Probiotics, defined as viable microorganisms that confer a health benefit
when administered in adequate quantities (Salminen et al. 1999), may represent such an innovative strategy. Indeed, based on observations
of microbiome influences on metabolic dysfunction, there is reason to hypothesize that
the community of commensal microbes that reside in the gut may represent one potentially
modifiable factor that could alter skeletal status.
Probiotics have been shown to alter the
composition and/or the metabolic activity of
the gut microbiota (Bron et al. 2012), regulate
the immune responses in the host (ScholzAhrens et al. 2007; Yan and Polk 2011), and
enhance epithelial barrier function (Seth et al.
2008; Anderson et al. 2010). These effects account for the emerging beneficial effects of probiotics for bone health. Several studies have
been conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotics in intact animals. For example, probiotics
have been shown to increase bone mass in chickens (Mutus et al. 2006) and prevent alveolar
bone loss in rats (Tomofuji et al. 2012). Moreover, male rats fed with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus helveticus had higher bone
density than controls (Narva et al. 2004), whereas treatment with Lactobacillus reuteri 6475
increased bone mass by decreasing bone resorption and TNF levels. Interestingly, these beneficial effects were found in male but not in female
mice (McCabe et al. 2013). A follow-up study
from the same group revealed that L. reuteri
6475 increases bone density in female mice
but only under the inflammatory conditions
induced by surgical stress (Collins et al. 2016).
That investigation revealed that the skin incision
required for sham-ovariectomy induces a longlasting inflammatory state that increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the intestine and the bone marrow. The presence of this
inflammatory state appeared to be required for
L. reuteri 6475 to increase bone mass but the
exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains
unknown. Because increased activation of bone
remodeling units is followed by a period of intense bone formation, the latter observation
could be explained by the fact that sham-operated mice sustain an increase in activation frequency induced by inflammatory cytokines,
followed by a period of intense bone formation.
Probiotics may also blunt the amount of resorbed bone and potentiate bone formation.
In nonoperated mice, L. reuteri 6475 may be
unable to suppress bone resorption below baseline and thus may be unable to stimulate bone
formation.
A beneficial effect of probiotics in preventing the bone loss induced by ovx has also been
reported by many laboratories. An early study
showed that Lactobacillus-fermented soymilk
prevents trabecular bone loss as effectively as
the bisphosphonate alendronate (Chiang and
Pan 2011). Shortly thereafter, Ohlsson et al.
(2014) reported that a single Lactobacillus strain
or a mixture of three lactobacilli prevents the
loss of cortical bone and the increase in bone
resorption induced by ovx. The same studies
revealed that the bone-sparing effects of lactobacilli was related to blunted production of TNF
and IL-1 and a reversal of the decrease in Treg
cells induced by ovx (Ohlsson et al. 2014). Surprisingly, the same investigation showed no protection against ovx-induced trabecular bone
loss (Ohlsson et al. 2014). Britton et al. (2014)
confirmed the bone-sparing activity of probiotics by reporting that L. reuteri prevents ovxinduced trabecular bone loss. This probiotic
prevented the increase in CD4þ T cells induced
by ovx, induced secretion of anti-TNF factors,

and modified microbial communities in the ovx
mouse gut (Britton et al. 2014).
In a study by our research group, 10-weekold conventionally raised mice were ovx or
sham operated and treated with probiotics or
control vehicle for the first 4 weeks after surgery,
and then sacrificed. Mice were supplemented by
oral gavage with vehicle or purified cultures of
the extensively studied probiotic Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG (LGG), or with commercially
available VSL#3 preparation, which contains
eight strains of live bacteria, namely, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus,
Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei,
Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus during a 4-week period. Mice were fed
with probiotics twice a week for 4 weeks. The
probiotics LGG and VSL#3 prevented ovxinduced bone loss (Fig. 3) and decreased gut
permeability and intestinal and systemic inflammation (Li et al. 2016). Moreover, LGG
and VSL#3 increased bone mass in estrogen-replete mice by stimulating bone formation (Li
et al. 2016). These profound effects were elicited
by oral administration of either LGG or VSL#3
to ovx mice with a conventional microflora.
These data indicate that both LGG and VSL#3
have dynamic interactions with the epithelial
layer of the intestine, and actively induce the
expression of proteins involved with tightening
the gut epithelial barrier. In addition, it is also
possible that probiotics function by displacing
bacterial species that down-regulate tight junctional proteins in the intestinal epithelium.
Critical control assays in our studies showed
that protection against bone loss is bacterialstrain-specific. Here, treatment of ovx mice

probiotic effect) exerted no detectable modulatory influence on bone loss or on cytokine production. Intriguingly, treatment of ovx mice
with the LGG pili mutant LGG(DSpaC), referred to herein as LGGM, partially protected
ovx mice form bone loss. The SpaC protein is
necessary for LGG to bind to the intestinal mucus layer, and for LGG to exert its positive influence on gut tissue health (Ardita et al. 2014).
The fact that LGGM still maintained a degree of
protection from bone loss suggests that direct
contact with the mucus layer may not be the
only mode by which LGG exerts probiotic effects, and that other properties of LGG, such as
the production of short chain fatty acids, which
have been shown to modulate cytokine levels in
the intestine, is also a mechanism to consider
(Asarat et al. 2015).
LGG has been shown to facilitate stem-cell
turnover (Jones et al. 2013), to facilitate wound
restitution in the gut (Alam et al. 2014), and
mediate cytoprotective effects in the gut (Jones
et al. 2012, 2015) and cell proliferation and migration (Wentworth et al. 2010, 2011b). It is also
known that permeability along paracellular
spaces in the epithelium is controlled by intercellular tight junctional proteins (Ma and Anderson 2006; Yu and Yang 2009) and regulated,
at least in part, by the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide (PI)3-kinase signaling pathways (Wang et al. 2004). This
may suggest that contact of epithelium cells with
LGG and VSL#3 is able to compensate for the
loss of MAPK activity following sex steroid depletion (Filardo et al. 2000). Because gut epithelial cells express ERs (Armstrong et al. 2013; Qin
et al. 2014) and ER signaling activates MAPK
(Filardo et al. 2000), it is likely that sex steroids
binding to their receptors in the gut epithelia
induce MAPK expression that eventuates in
maintaining and/or tightening gut permeability. Sex steroid deficiency would then result in
weakening the MAPK pathway expression and
barrier integrity, as detected in ovx or leuprolide-treated mice.
A relationship between decreased taxonomic diversity and disease state has been found in
many inflammatory (Gevers et al. 2014; Scher
et al. 2015) and metabolic conditions (Knip and
Siljander 2016). As a result, decreased diversity
is regarded as an indicator of a disease state,
reflecting a deteriorating habitat and/or depleted resources (Cardinale et al. 2012). Interestingly, estrogen depletion has also been associated
with decreased a diversity in the gut microbiome (Flores et al. 2012; Fuhrman et al.
2014), whereas microbial diversity in the gut
transiently increases with administration of
probiotics (Preidis et al. 2012). Therefore, we
hypothesize that sex steroid deficiency may
lead to decreased microbiota diversity and that
LGG and VSL#3 probiotics restore a greater diversity. Further studies will be required to investigate this hypothesis and to determine whether
decreased diversity contributes to the bone loss
induced by sex steroid deprivation. In summary, the dysregulation in the interactions between the gut microbiota and the intestinal wall
play a pivotal role in inducing inflammation
and bone loss in sex steroid –deficient mice. Direct clinical applications of these findings arise
because of the availability of pre- and probiotic
agents that may prevent bone loss by tightening
the gut barrier integrity, thus limiting the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines.
PREBIOTICS AND BONE
Prebiotics are nondigestible fermentable food
ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial microbes and/or promote beneficial
changes in the activity of the microbiome (Gibson et al. 2004). Although nondigestible by humans, prebiotics are metabolized by bacteria.
Prebiotics are found in a variety of foods such
as artichokes, garlic, leeks, dandelion greens,
bananas, onions, and chicory (McCabe et al.
2015). In many cases, a significant amount of
the food is needed to get enough prebiotic for
activity; therefore, prebiotics such as inulin have
been developed into soft chew, capsule, tablet,
or shake forms (McCabe et al. 2015). Prebiotics
include nondigestible oligosaccharides such as
polydextrose, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs),
inulin, xylo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and soybean oligosaccharides.
Prebiotics have been found to increase calcium
absorption in healthy animals (Weaver et al.

2010; Legette et al. 2012) and humans (Griffin
et al. 2002; Abrams et al. 2005). Prebiotics have
also been found to increase calcium absorption
in ovx animals (Zafar et al. 2004) and postmenopausal women (van den Heuvel et al. 2000).
More importantly, FOS and inulin have been
found to increase indices of trabecular and
cortical bone volume and structure in healthy
mice (Garcia-Vieyra et al. 2014) and rats (Takahara et al. 2000; Roberfroid et al. 2002).
Similarly, prebiotics have also been shown to
prevent ovx-induced bone loss in experimental
animals (Chonan et al. 1995). Studies in humans have revealed that prebiotics increase
whole-body bone mineral density in adolescent
girls (Abrams et al. 2005) and decrease bone loss
in postmenopausal women (Slevin et al. 2014).
Prebiotics appear to affect both bone formation
and bone resorption. The mechanism of action
of prebiotics in bone remains unknown. However, it is likely that metabolic and immunological pathway may be involved (Weaver 2015).
First, dietary fiber is fermented to short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) in the lower gut by resident
microbiota. SCFAs lower intestinal pH, which
causes an increase in calcium absorption (Weaver 2015). Moreover, SCFAs serve as energy
sources for gut epithelial cells, and this may
lead to improved gut health and gut barrier
function (Donohoe et al. 2011). Importantly,
SCFAs modulate cytokine production and induce expansion of Treg cells (Arpaia et al.
2013; Furusawa et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2013)
through multiple mechanisms (Zeng and Chi
2015). In fact, SCFAs have been implicated in
anti-inflammatory properties of a mix of 17 human-derived Clostridia strains. Tregs have been
shown to regulate osteoclast formation (Kim
et al. 2007; Zaiss et al. 2007; Kelchtermans
et al. 2009); thus, SCFAs may regulate bone resorption via Tregs.
CONCLUSIONS
In the last 5 years, numerous links have emerged
between the intestinal microbiota and bone
health. Most critical data have been obtained
in experimental animals and confirmation in
humans is needed. In particular, prospective
clinical trials remain to be conducted to establish the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics in
preventing age- and menopause-related bone
loss and to increase bone mass in growing children and adults.
Another area ripe for development is a comparison of the composition of the intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals and osteoporotic subjects with and without fractures. These
studies may reveal whether microbiota alterations leading to a predisposition to bone loss
and fracture exist or not, and whether microbiota sequencing may be used as a novel biomarker for osteoporosis. Colonization of germfree animals with intestinal microbiota from
healthy and osteoporotic subjects will further
help in establishing the role of specific microbiota alterations in postmenopausal- and agerelated bone loss.
