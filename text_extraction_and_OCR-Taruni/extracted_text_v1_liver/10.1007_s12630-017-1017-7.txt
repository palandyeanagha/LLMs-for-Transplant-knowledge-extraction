Abstract
Purpose The use of transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE) has evolved to include patients undergoing high-risk
non-cardiac procedures and patients with significant
cardiac disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
Implementation of basic TEE education in training
programs has increased across a broad spectrum of
procedures in the perioperative arena. This paper
describes the use of perioperative TEE in non-cardiac
surgery and provides an overview of the basic TEE
examination.
Principal findings Perioperative TEE is used to monitor
hemodynamic parameters in non-cardiac procedures
where there is a high risk of hemodynamic instability. Its
use extends to include moderate-risk procedures for
patients with significant cardiac diseases such as low
ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe
valve lesions, or congenital heart disease. Vascular
procedures involving the aorta, blunt trauma, and liver
transplantation are all examples of procedures that may
benefit from TEE. Transesophageal echocardiography
examination allows assessment of volume status,
ventricular function, diagnosis of gross valvular
pathology and pericardial tamponade, as well as close
monitoring of cardiac output, response to therapy, and the
impact of ongoing surgical manipulation. In patients with
unexplained and unexpected hemodynamic instability,
‘‘rescue TEE’’ can be used to help identify the underlying
cause.
Conclusions Perioperative TEE is emerging as a
preferred tool to manage hemodynamics in high-risk
procedures and in high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. A rescue TEE examination protocol is a
helpful approach for early identification of the etiology of
hemodynamic instability.

A 53-yr-old male presents to the operating room for urgent
exploratory laparotomy after experiencing 24 hr of nausea,
vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Abdominal
radiographs show free air under the diaphragm with a
suspected bowel perforation. His medical history reveals
daily intravenous cocaine use. After induction with
propofol, cisatracurium, and fentanyl, his blood pressure
is 60/40 mmHg, and his heart rhythm demonstrates sinus
tachycardia with a rate of 130 beatsmin-1
. Despite several
boluses of phenylephrine and epinephrine and intravenous
fluid resuscitation, there is no change in his hemodynamic
status. Urgent intraoperative transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) examination reveals severe
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with left
ventricular cavity obliteration, severe mitral regurgitation,
and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve
leaflet consistent with left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. After two litres of fluid, cessation of inotrope
therapy, and a phenylephrine infusion, the patient’s heart
rate normalizes to 82 beatsmin-1
and his blood pressure
increases to 130/76 mmHg (video as Electronic
Supplementary Material).
Perioperative TEE has been used in non-cardiac surgery
for over two decades.1,2 Its use has expanded to assist in
resuscitation by diagnosing life-threatening perioperative
conditions such as myocardial ischemia, pulmonary
embolism, cardiac tamponade, and hypovolemia.3,4 As
our case vignette shows, the use of TEE is a relatively
noninvasive diagnostic approach that can be used in real
time to guide perioperative management in a variety of
non-cardiac surgical procedures.5-9
In this paper, we aim to review the indications for the
use of TEE in non-cardiac surgery, TEE exam views,
technical aspects of image acquisition, clinical
applications, and the use of rescue TEE in non-cardiac
surgery.
Perioperative TEE examination
Equipment orientation
As with any ultrasound technology, TEE imaging is based
on the piezoelectric effect principle. Knowledge of the
echo machine is crucial for obtaining high-quality images.
Anesthesiologists should be familiar with ultrasound
knobology, probe selection, and the various
echocardiography modalities (e.g., two-dimensional [2D],
colour flow Doppler, spectral Doppler, and M-Mode) in
order to provide accurate hemodynamic assessments. The
wave depth should be adjusted for specific views of
interest. Higher or lower depth settings result in lowquality images and misdiagnosis. Optimization of 2D gain
should be set at the beginning of the exam by ensuring that
blood or cardiac chambers are black. Use of colour Doppler
imaging requires the smallest possible adjustment of the
colour sector to view the relevant structures at higher frame
rates, while setting the colour scale to a Nyquist limit of
50-60 cmsec-1 for detecting valvular pathologies. A lower
colour scale of 20-30 cmsec-1 should be used for lowerflow areas such the interatrial septum. Utilization of
Doppler should also be adjusted for both the scale and
baseline. Once the TEE exam is completed and the
machine is not in use, the equipment should be put in
freeze mode or powered down to sleep mode until reuse.
Insertion of the TEE probe
After reviewing the patient’s history for TEE
indications/contraindications and obtaining consent,
insertion of the probe under general anesthesia is
facilitated using a jaw lift and gently directing a welllubricated probe towards the posterior pharynx and the
esophagus.10 A bite block should be used to prevent
damage to the probe or dentition, and force should not be
used on encountering resistance. Slight flexing or turning
the patient’s head to the left, redirecting the probe, or
inserting the probe under direct vision using video or
conventional laryngoscopy can aid in probe insertion.

Manipulation of the TEE probe
Echocardiographers should be familiar with terminology
related to TEE probe manipulation (Fig. 1A), including
advancement, withdrawal, turning, and angle rotation.
Axial rotation of the transducer is controlled through an
electronic switch at the handle with ranges from 0-180.
Anteflexion and retroflexion (i.e., movement in the plane of
the probe shaft) are achieved by moving the larger of the
two control knobs on the probe handle. The smaller knob
moves the probe tip up to 30 to the right or left.
Suggested views
A comprehensive perioperative TEE exam for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery previously consisted of 20
standard views, but it has now been extended to 28
views.10-12 The American Society of Anesthesiologists/
American Society of Echocardiography (ASA/ASE)
consensus statement for a basic perioperative TEE
examination limits the exam to 11 views.13 In our
opinion, however, 16 views are required to provide a
thorough examination for both basic anatomy and
hemodynamic assessment (Fig. 2). A ‘‘rescue’’ or focused
TEE exam performed in a hemodynamically
unstable patient may be limited initially to a fewer
number of views to allow for a more rapid assessment
(Table 1). Once the patient is stabilized, a full TEE exam
may follow. Echocardiographers should be familiar with
acquiring TEE views and understanding their relevant
echocardiographic nomenclature.10
Acquisition of the views
Transesophageal echocardiography views are obtained
through esophageal and gastric windows (Fig. 1B). A
TEE exam may begin with mid-esophageal (ME) views
followed by transgastric (TG) views. The exact sequence of
acquiring views, while often left to the discretion of the
individual, should be repeated in the same order regardless
of the clinical scenario. This approach will facilitate
consistency and efficiency through experience. Table 2
suggests steps for acquiring the 16 proposed views and
imaging the relevant structures in the suggested sequence.
We acknowledge that certain views might be difficult to
obtain in some patients because of variabilities in patient
position, anatomy, pathology, and comorbidities, while in
others, additional probe maneuvers may be required to
optimize the view.
Indications for perioperative TEE in non-cardiac
surgery
Knowledge of the potential indications for the use of TEE
in non-cardiac surgery is helpful in understanding where

elective use of TEE may provide for rapid assessment of
anticipated hemodynamic changes and where its benefits
are likely to outweigh the various perioperative risks
(Table 3). Nevertheless, the final decision for a TEE
examination is guided by the patient’s medical status, the
nature of the surgical procedure, and the specific
circumstances as judged by the treating physician.10,14
In contrast, rescue TEE is indicated in patients with
unexpected or unexplained hemodynamic instability
regardless of the surgical procedure or the patient’s
medical condition. A rescue TEE may be performed
intraoperatively, postoperatively in recovery, or in other
critical care areas.12-14 Awareness of the intraoperative and
postoperative indications for a rescue TEE can guide
patient management in real time and minimize adverse
outcomes of high-risk surgeries4 (Table 3).
While TEE is considered the preferred imaging modality
for hemodynamic assessment intraoperatively,
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the modality of
choice for cardiovascular evaluation in awake patients

prior to induction of anesthesia or during postanesthesia
recovery. It is important to understand that TEE provides
high-resolution images of the posterior cardiac structures,
whereas TTE offers generally very good visualization of
the anterior cardiac structures, the left ventricular (LV)
apex, and most of the aortic arch. Both modalities
complement each other in the perioperative period.15
Contraindications to TEE
In trained hands, the TEE examination is generally a safe
and minimally invasive procedure. The overall rate of
TEE-related morbidity ranges from 0.2-1.2%.16
Contraindications to TEE insertion are well described in
the literature14 (Table 4). Before TEE probe placement,
clinical assessment is warranted to rule out
contraindications, unless assessment is not feasible such
as in emergencies or unconscious patients. When TEE is
anticipated, the risks and benefits should be explained to
the patient preoperatively and consent should be obtained.
Clinical applications for TEE
Perioperative TEE is generally reserved for surgical
patients with high-risk medical conditions and patients
undergoing high-risk surgical procedures. The proposed
TEE exam provides anesthesiologists with an adequate
representation of the following structures and functions:
• Ventricular structure and function
• Hemodynamic parameters of volume status, cardiac
output, and other related conditions
• Valvular structure and function
• Intracardiac masses
• Cardiac shunts
• Pericardial and cardiac tamponade
• Aortic atheroma and acute aortic syndromes (e.g.,
dissection)
Assessment of ventricular structure and function
Echocardiography can be used as a real-time monitor of
both the left ventricle and the right ventricle. The
morphology of both ventricles needs to be assessed in
terms of shape, size, wall thickness, and function
(including regional wall motion and diastology).17,18
Left ventricular systolic function
Hemodynamic instability due to LV systolic dysfunction
occurs in a significant proportion of patients undergoing
non-cardiac surgery.2,19,20 A quick visual exam can rapidly

ascertain LV function by qualitatively estimating the LV
ejection fraction.21 This is best achieved in the TG midpapillary short-axis (SAX) view.22,23 Quantitative
surrogates of ejection fraction may be obtained through
traditional approaches, such as using the 2D Simpson’s
biplane method (echocardiographic gold standard)24 and
fractional area change. These quantitative approaches
should be employed along with a dynamic qualitative
estimation of the ejection fraction, as loading conditions
commonly change in the perioperative period and may lead
to erroneous assessments. Importantly, ejection fraction
should be interpreted with caution in patients with specific
cardiac pathologies, for example, in patients with mitral
regurgitation or ventricular septal defect.
When LV dysfunction is diagnosed, initiation of
inotropes may be required. The left ventricle can then be
closely monitored with the inotropic requirement titrated to
a desired response. An increase in blood pressure alone
should be interpreted with caution, because an increase in
afterload following vasopressor therapy can significantly
reduce LV contractility and unmask LV dysfunction.25
Assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities
(RWMAs)
As part of the evaluation of LV systolic function, the left
ventricle is examined for RWMAs. The left ventricle is
visualized in 17 segments: six anatomical segments at the
base of the heart, six corresponding segments at the midpapillary level, four segments at the apical level, and an
apical cap. This approach allows accurate examination of
the LV walls and documentation of any abnormal wall
motion at baseline.26 It also allows identification of
ischemia within specific coronary artery territories. The
right coronary artery provides perfusion to the right
ventricle, inferior wall, and posterior one-third of the
basal septum of the left ventricle. The left anterior
descending artery perfuses the anterior and anteroseptal
segments and the apical cap, and the left circumflex artery
perfuses the lateral wall segments.
Echocardiography is a sensitive monitor for detection of
perioperative myocardial ischemia.27,28 Analysis of LV
segmental function is gleaned from ventricular wall motion
and thickening during systole. The TG mid-papillary SAX
view of the left ventricle is frequently employed to detect
RWMAs, but basal and apical TG views must also be
examined before RWMAs can be excluded. Once a new
RWMA is detected and appropriate therapy instituted,
continued monitoring for response is indicated.
Persistent and treatment-resistant RWMAs may indicate
acute coronary syndrome, including myocardial infarction.
New-onset mitral regurgitation or deterioration in
preexisting regurgitation could also be early
echocardiographic features of myocardial ischemia.29,30
Regional wall motion is commonly classified as 1) normal
or hyperkinetic, 2) hypokinetic (reduced thickening), 3)
akinetic (absence of thickening), and 4) dyskinetic (systolic
thinning or aneurysmal changes).18
Left ventricular diastolic function
When surgical patients become hemodynamically
unstable without changes in preload or contractility,
diastolic dysfunction should be considered a differential
etiology.31 Patients with LV diastolic dysfunction
undergoing non-cardiac surgery sustain a higher risk of
major adverse cardiac events.32 Left ventricular diastolic
function should be assessed in high-risk patients and in
patients with shortness of breath despite normal systolic
function. Anesthesiologists with advanced
echocardiographic skills may be consulted to determine
the severity of the diastolic dysfunction based on mitral
inflow, pulmonary venous flow, and tissue Doppler

parameters.33 Change in diastolic function and
development of acute diastolic dysfunction with
hemodynamic instability have been reported in patients
undergoing aortic surgery. Early recognition and treatment
of acute diastolic dysfunction may be crucial in mitigating
adverse outcomes of surgery.34
Right ventricular function
Acute and chronic RV dysfunction can lead to significant
hemodynamic instability.35,36 Chronic RV dysfunction
often includes RV hypertrophy or dilation and an
enlarged right atrium (RA).37 Specific echocardiographic

signs of RV failure include hypokinesis/akinesis of the
ventricular free wall, abnormal septal shape and motion,
loss of the triangular/crescentic RV morphology, and
reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion
(TAPSE). A qualitative assessment of the motion of the
free wall and the septum is often adequate.38
Acute RV failure may raise the suspicion of pulmonary
embolism (PE). The proximal pulmonary artery can be
visualized for the presence of a thromboembolus (Fig. 3).
The development of acute pulmonary hypertension (from
both PE and other pathologies) from a sudden increase in
the pulmonary vascular resistance may lead to RV failure.
The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure or RV systolic
pressure can be estimated through Doppler measurement of
the tricuspid regurgitation and the right atrial pressure.39
The latter can be estimated from inferior vena cava (IVC)
size and change in diameter associated with
respiration.38,40 The IVC can be imaged in the
transgastric view at the level of the mitral valve (MV) by
turning the probe clockwise (to the right) to find the liver.
Slight probe withdrawal and transducer angle rotation (30-
50) may be required to optimize the view. M-mode
imaging is recommended to measure the IVC size and
changes in diameter. In spontaneously breathing patients,
IVC diameter is measured and collapsibility (due to a
decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration) is
assessed. In patients whose lungs are mechanically
ventilated, however, distensibility (in response to the
increase in intrathoracic pressure during ventilation)
rather than collapsibility is assessed.41,42 Patients with an
IVC diameter [ 2.0 cm with no or minimal respiratory
variations (\ 50% collapsibility or distensibility) are
deemed to have elevated right atrial pressure ([15
mmHg).38
For the best Doppler angle, alignment with the tricuspid
regurgitant jet is obtained with the modified bicaval view.
Right ventricular systolic pressure C 35 mmHg is
indicative of pulmonary hypertension, especially when it
is associated with signs of RV failure. Further, when
treatment is administered to reduce RV afterload,
echocardiography is considered an ideal tool to monitor
its dose titration and effectiveness.43,44

Assessment of preload
Administration of either inadequate or excessive
intravenous fluids is associated with morbidity in surgical
patients.45-47 There is emerging evidence of the benefits of
goal-directed fluid therapy or a zero-balance approach
during major surgeries.48-51
Many invasive and noninvasive monitors are used to
guide intravenous fluid administration in high-risk
patients and procedures. Amongst these,
echocardiography appears to be an ideal tool for goaldirected fluid therapy.52,53 It can rapidly estimate the LV
volume by examining changes in the LV size.13,33 The
LV TG SAX mid-papillary view is the most commonly
used view to estimate LV volume.53,54
Reduction in the LV cavity (changes in end systole and
diastole LV dimension) from baseline or obliteration of the
LV cavity during systole may indicate hypovolemia.53,55
Alternatively, the LV TG long-axis (LAX) one centimetre
below the mitral annulus is also a reliable view to monitor
and assess volume status by LV dimension.33 Further,
accounting for respiratory variations, IVC diameter
measured in the TG view is another indicator of the
volume status in both spontaneously breathing
(collapsibility) patients and patients whose lungs are
mechanically ventilated (distensibility).41,42,56,57 Other
indicators of volume overload include distension of the
IVC, distension of the right ventricle, flattening of the
septum (D-shaped left ventricle), increase in tricuspid
regurgitation, and response to passive leg raise.

ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and LVOT diameter (LVOTd). Left
ventricular outflow tract diameter is best measured at the midesophageal long-axis view just adjacent to the aortic annulus during
systole (A). The deep transgastric (TG) view is then obtained, and the
PW cursor is positioned in the LVOT close to the aortic valve (AV)
leaflets (B). The velocity time integral (VTI) is traced and the stroke
volume (SV) is obtained (C). Heart rate (HR) is shown and cardiac
output (CO) is calculated

Assessment of cardiac output and hemodynamic
monitoring
Monitoring the changes in cardiac output remains a key
component of hemodynamic management in critically ill
patients.58 Echocardiography is becoming the monitor of
choice to measure (and monitor) changes in cardiac
output, particularly with the decline in the use of the
pulmonary artery catheter.59,60 The goal of hemodynamic
management in patients with significant cardiac disease is
to maintain optimal tissue perfusion during the
perioperative period.
Technically, stroke volume and cardiac output can be
estimated at any cardiac valve by measuring the velocity
time integral at the valve multiplied by the valvular crosssectional area. It can also be estimated through the
difference in 2D volume between the end-diastolic and
the end-systolic ventricular volume. Most ultrasound
systems are equipped with software packages to enable
automatic calculation of the cardiac output from the stroke
volume and heart rate.13
One of the more popular approaches for measuring leftsided cardiac output is estimating the combined 2D LV
outflow tract diameter from the ME LAX view and the
Fig. 5 A mid-esophageal fivechamber animation showing the
left ventricular outflow tract
(LVOT) in a normal heart (A)
compared with a patient with
dynamic LVOT obstruction (B).
The obstruction is caused by
systolic anterior motion of the
anterior leaflet of the mitral
valve. Ao = aorta; LA = left
atrium; LV = left ventricle; MR
= mitral regurgitation; 1 =
anterior leaflet; 2 = posterior
leaflet

velocity time integral of the LV outflow tract from the deep
TG view (Fig. 4).61,62 To achieve continuous monitoring of
cardiac output, the TEE probe can be left at the deep TG
view for frequent measurement of the velocity time
integral. The right-sided cardiac output can similarly be
estimated by measuring the velocity time integral of the
pulmonic valve from the ME ascending aorta SAX view
and the 2D RV outflow diameter from the RV inflowoutflow view.63,64 Measurement of cardiac output in
patients with arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, may
require multiple measurements of the LV outflow tract
velocity time integral.
In rescue TEE, a rapid assessment of LV systolic
function and volume status can be achieved by
‘‘eyeballing’’ the left ventricle at the transgastric shortaxis view, as this allows simultaneous visualization of three
coronary territories and correlates well with global
function.53
Other related conditions
Ventricular outflow tract obstruction
Left ventricular or RV outflow tract obstruction can also
cause hemodynamic instability in perioperative
patients.65,66 Systolic anterior motion of the anterior
mitral leaflet is the most frequent cause of LV outflow
tract obstruction in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (Fig. 5).67 Echocardiography is the only
tool available for anesthesiologists to diagnose and assess
the severity of the LV outflow tract obstruction, optimize
the preload, and assess response to therapy.68-71 Right
ventricular outflow obstruction is rare but has been
described with hemodynamic instability during lung
transplant surgery and post-cardiac surgery in the
intensive care unit.36,72
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) is a
more common pathology than initially thought and may
lead to significant hemodynamic instability.73 It may be
triggered by surgical stress response and excessive
sympathetic stimulation during the perioperative period.
Echocardiography features include apical ballooning of the
left ventricle with a normal to hyperdynamic base.74
Valvular lesions
Preoperative echocardiography is helpful in excluding
suspected valvular pathology as well as in managing
patients with significant valvular lesions undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. Details identifying and
assessing the severity of valvular lesions have previously
been reported.75,76 Transesophageal echocardiography is
used for hemodynamic monitoring in these patients to
ensure adequate cardiac output and to assess for changes in
the regurgitant volume or in the volume passing through a
stenotic lesion. Perioperative management should aim to
minimize volume changes through the regurgitant/stenotic

lesion and maximize cardiac output. Acute hemodynamic
instability may occur in patients with significant valvular
lesions.77-80 In these situations, by monitoring end-diastolic
filling and ventricular contractility, TEE-guided
management of the surgical patient ensures adequate
cardiac output.81
Intracardiac masses
Valvular vegetation in septic patients may represent a
challenge for perioperative hemodynamic management.
Typically, vegetation is seen on the low-pressure and
upstream side of the leaflets and on the coaptation lines.
Intracardiac masses (primary or secondary), depending on
their size and location, could adversely impact
hemodynamics in the perioperative period. Often seen in
the left atrium, an intracardiac myxoma is considered the
most common primary cardiac tumour.82 Nevertheless,
metastatic cardiac tumours are seen more frequently than
primary tumours.83 Intracardiac thrombi are also a major
finding and can be a surrogate finding on unstable patients
after acute anterior wall myocardial infarction or
in situations of low cardiac output. Intracardiac thrombi
are commonly found on pacemakers, indwelling catheters,
and cannulas.
Hypoxia
Hypoxia is a repeatedly encountered problem during the
perioperative period. Unexplained hypoxia that cannot be
attributed to a respiratory cause should be investigated for
cardiac sources – e.g., cardiac shunts.
Intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunting
In the perioperative setting, right-to-left shunting may
result in hemodynamic instability, refractory hypoxemia,
or both. Colour flow Doppler and agitated saline contrast
can aid in the diagnosis of a shunt. Right-to-left shunting
through an atrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale are
the two most common causes of unexplained
hypoxemia.84-86 The presence of a patent foramen ovale
or other intracardiac shunting may increase the risk of
paradoxical embolization or hypoxemia, particularly in
orthopedic, neurosurgical, trauma, and laparoscopic
procedures.87-89 The risk of hypoxemia is higher in the
presence of increased right-sided pressures, as would occur
with pulmonary hypertension, RV dysfunction, pulmonary
embolism, and lung resection surgery.90 In the presence of
normal blood pressure, steps to reduce right-sided pressure
should be initiated. Occasionally, right-to-left shunting
may also occur in the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous
fistulas. The agitated saline contrast study may demonstrate
a delay in the bubbles reaching the left atrium.91
Pulmonary emboli, air and fat emboli monitoring
Pulmonary embolism may lead to significant hemodynamic
instability and hypoxia. When compared with other
perioperative monitors, echocardiography is a specific
and reliable monitor for diagnosing intraoperative
pulmonary emboli.92,93 Intraoperative TEE may allow
direct visualization of the embolus in the pulmonary
artery or in its most proximal divisions. Nevertheless,
findings are commonly those of acute RV overload,
particularly with more distal emboli that cannot be
visualized – e.g., RV enlargement and RV dysfunction
with preservation of the apical contractility (McConnell’s
sign).94 Secondary signs of high RV afterload, such as
flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and
significant tricuspid regurgitation, may also be observed in
some patients. The usefulness of intraoperative TEE to
detect thromboembolic air and fat embolism has been
shown across a number of surgical procedures.95-98
Pleural effusion
Significant pleural effusion can lead to intraoperative
hypoxia. Echocardiographic appearance of the pleural
effusion may differ by etiology and chronicity. A
loculated hemothorax or hematoma may give similar
echogenic appearance of lung consolidation. In the TEE
image, a left pleural effusion appears as a dark echo-free
space posterior to the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 6). A
right pleural effusion can be seen by rotating the probe to
the right from the ME four-chamber view and advancing it
until the liver is seen.99 Compared with a chest x-ray,
echocardiography detects volumes of 20 mL vs 200 mL.100
It is not uncommon to visualize pleural effusion, B-lines,
and atelectasis in a patient suffering from hypoxia.101
Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade
A pericardial effusion is easily visualized as an echo-free
space in the pericardial sac (Fig. 7). The diagnostic value
of echocardiography in cardiac tamponade is well
established.102,103 Transesophageal echocardiography may
show compression of the heart chambers and impaired
ventricular filling. The amount of fluid in the pericardium
does not always correlate with tamponade, especially with
chronic accumulation of pericardial fluid. Early recognition
of this life-threatening condition, especially in trauma
patients, allows for prompt intervention before impending
cardiovascular collapse.104 Echocardiographic features
include pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse with a
TEE for non-cardiac surgery 393
123

pericardial effusion, or RV collapse and hemodynamic
instability.105,106 Nevertheless, cardiac tamponade is a
clinical rather than an echocardiographic diagnosis.
Significant pericardial effusion alone may also result in
inadequate ventilation and perioperative hemodynamic
instability.
Aortic pathology
Examination of the aorta for atherosclerosis, atheroma,
aneurysm, and dissection is an important component of the
TEE exam. The sensitivity of TEE for pathologies in the
ascending and descending thoracic aorta approaches
100%.107-109 Due to the air-filled trachea (and left
mainstem bronchus) impeding ultrasound transmission,
the distal ascending aorta may not be visible on TEE,
which leaves the potential for false negatives on routine
scanning. Using the ME and TG views, the examination
should systematically proceed from the ascending aorta
distally until the proximal end of the abdominal aorta.
The ascending aorta is examined at the ME LAX view
and the ME SAX view. The descending aorta is examined
in SAX and LAX views. When atherosclerosis or atheroma
is detected, its location and severity need to be reported.
For reporting, we recommend the use of the five-point
severity scale: Grade I = normal aorta; Grade II = intima
thickness [ 2 mm; Grade III = atheroma thickness (i.e.,
lumen protrusion)\5 mm; Grade IV= atheroma thickness
[5mm; and Grade V= mobile atheroma irrespective of the
magnitude of thickness.107,110 The shape and size of the
aortic segments should also be examined for the presence
of any aneurysm. Detection of an intimal flap that divides
the aorta into false and true lumens indicates aortic
dissection.109 Colour flow Doppler can be used to
identify fenestrated communication points (i.e., entry and
exit sites) between the two lumens. Transesophageal
echocardiography can also detect aortic insufficiency (AI)
and involvement of the coronary artery ostia associated
with aortic dissection. Clinical presentation of significant
blunt trauma to the chest associated with back pain is
suggestive of aortic dissection and should prompt the
initiation of a TEE exam in hemodynamically
unstable patients. Careful inspection of the aorta in
multiple planes allows the echocardiographer to evaluate
Fig. 8 Recommended approach and views for rescue transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) exam.4,33 LA = left atrium; LAX = long
axis; ME = mid-esophageal; PI = pulmonary insufficiency; RA = right
atrium; Rt = right; RV = right ventricle; RWMA = regional wall
motion abnormality; TG = transgastric; TR = tricuspid regurgitation;
4/5 = four & five chamber
Table 5 Questions that need to be answered when performing a
rescue transesophageal echocardiography
1. Are the LV and RV contracting adequately?
2. Are there RWMAs?
3. What is the patient’s volume status? (Is the heart ‘‘full’’ or
‘‘empty’’?)
4. Is there a significant valvular lesion?
5. Is there a ventricular outflow tract obstruction?
6. Is there a significant pericardial effusion?
7. Is there an intracardiac mass or clot?
LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle; RWMAs = regional wall

hematomas, intimal disruptions, transections, dissections,
or artifacts. Colour flow Doppler is also helpful in
identifying flow in false lumens and points of entry.107
Further, TEE is a valuable tool to guide endovascular
repair of aneurysmal disease. Imaging of the thoracic aorta
during stent deployment can identify atheroma at the
landing zone, confirm the guidewire in the true lumen, and
reveal the presence of endoleaks.111,112
Rescue TEE
When performing a rescue TEE, the physician should first
evaluate ventricular contractility, adequacy of ventricular
diastolic volume, and presence of pericardial effusion to
direct further examination (Table 5 and Fig. 8). When no
immediate etiology of hemodynamic instability is
identified, a more elaborate 16-view exam proposed
above should be considered. Additional views for extracardiac pathologies and other conditions mentioned above
should be considered. When all else fails, consultations
with a more experienced colleague should be sought while
aggressive hemodynamic management continues.
Conclusions and future steps
Perioperative TEE in non-cardiac surgery provides a
unique means for detailed real-time cardiovascular
assessment with a wide variety of clinical applications.
Transesophageal echocardiography may be considered the
hemodynamic monitor of choice in high-risk surgical
procedures and in high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. It should be readily available in the
perioperative area to provide evaluation of unexplained
hemodynamic instability and cardiac emergencies.
As shown in the various clinical applications, echoguided hemodynamic monitoring is a relatively novel
approach to provide goal-directed therapy in perioperative
patients. The use of echocardiography to optimize high-risk
patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery is being studied
and is anticipated to expand.113 The concept of monitoring
patients’ cardiac output in a relatively noninvasive way
compared with pulmonary artery catheters has led to
changes in the role that TEE plays in the overall
perioperative care of non-cardiac surgical patients.
Future studies evaluating the effectiveness of TEE are
anticipated. As the use of TEE continues to expand outside
the cardiac suite, appropriateness criteria will need to be
continually defined. As technology has outpaced education
with the invention of smaller and less expensive ultrasound
devices, we anticipate that formal echocardiography
training programs for anesthesiologists will adapt to the
changes and become part of their postgraduate curricula.
Additionally, there is no argument that the use of TEE in
urgent or emergent situations (rescue TEE) and in noncardiac surgery has its place; however, defining best
practice guidance and developing high-quality training
programs and optimal credentialing standards are key
challenges that lie ahead.
