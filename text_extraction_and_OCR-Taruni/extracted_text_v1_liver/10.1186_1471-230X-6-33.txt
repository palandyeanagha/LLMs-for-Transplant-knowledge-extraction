Abstract
Background: Fatty liver (FL) is the most frequent liver disease in Western countries. We used
data from the Dionysos Nutrition & Liver Study to develop a simple algorithm for the prediction
of FL in the general population.
Methods: 216 subjects with and 280 without suspected liver disease were studied. FL was
diagnosed by ultrasonography and alcohol intake was assessed using a 7-day diary. Bootstrapped
stepwise logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of FL among 13 variables of
interest [gender, age, ethanol intake, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gammaglutamyl-transferase (GGT), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, sum of 4 skinfolds,
glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol]. Potential predictors were entered into stepwise
logistic regression models with the aim of obtaining the most simple and accurate algorithm for the
prediction of FL.
Results: An algorithm based on BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides and GGT had an accuracy
of 0.84 (95%CI 0.81–0.87) in detecting FL. We used this algorithm to develop the "fatty liver index"
(FLI), which varies between 0 and 100. A FLI < 30 (negative likelihood ratio = 0.2) rules out and a
FLI ≥ 60 (positive likelihood ratio = 4.3) rules in fatty liver.
Conclusion: FLI is simple to obtain and may help physicians select subjects for liver
ultrasonography and intensified lifestyle counseling, and researchers to select patients for
epidemiologic studies. Validation of FLI in external populations is needed before it can be employed
for these purposes.

Background
Fatty liver (FL) is the most frequent liver disease in Western countries [1-4]. Obesity and its complications, especially type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, are likely
to be the main responsible of the current epidemic of FL,
while ethanol intake may play a minor role [5-7]. In a
nested case-control study of the Dionysos Project, we
found that body mass index (BMI) was a stronger risk factor for FL than ethanol intake in the general population of
Northern Italy [6]. Interestingly, this finding was confirmed by a recent study performed in China [8]. Waist circumference has long been hypothesized to be a predictor
of FL independently from BMI, but data for the general
population were not available until very recently [1,8].
Because BMI is a surrogate index of body adiposity [9],
direct indexes of adiposity such as skinfolds can be of
value when studying the relationship between body fatness per se and disease [10,11]. Hyperinsulinemia and
insulin resistance are common in subjects with FL independently from BMI and thus are expected to be markers
of FL in the general population [12]. Despite the operational separation of FL into alcoholic and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [4], the relative contribution
of ethanol intake and other factors in the pathogenesis of
FL is still uncertain [3]. Using data collected during the
Dionysos Nutrition & Liver Study [1], we evaluated the
contribution of ethanol intake, anthropometry, liver
enzymes and metabolic parameters to the risk of FL and
developed an algorithm for the prediction of FL in the
general population.
Methods
Study design
The protocol of the Dionysos Nutrition & Liver Study was
described in detail elsewhere [1]. Briefly, of 5780 residents
of Campogalliano (Modena, Italy) aged 18 to 75 years,
3345 (58%) agreed to participate to the study; 3329
(99%) of them had all the data required by the Dionysos
Project [7,13] and were considered for further analysis.
497 (15%) of them had suspected liver disease (SLD)
according to at least one of the following criteria: 1)
alanine transaminase (ALT) > 30 U*L-1; 2) gammaglutamyl-transferase (GGT) > 35 U*L-1; 3) presence of
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 4) presence of Hepatitis C (HCV) virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) after detection
of anti-HCV antibodies. The 497 subjects with SLD were
matched with an equal number of subjects of the same age
and sex but without SLD, randomly selected among the
remaining 2832 subjects. After exclusion of subjects with
HBV or HCV infection, the original analysis was performed on 224 subjects with and 287 without SLD [1].
The present analysis is performed on 216 (96%) subjects
with and 280 (97%) without SLD, based on the availability of skinfold measurements.
Methods
Besides a clinical and laboratory evaluation, each subject
underwent a liver ultrasonography, an anthropometric
assessment and a 7-day diary of food intake (7DD) [1].
HBsAg and anti-HCV antibodies were assessed and subjects with anti-HCV antibodies underwent an HCV-RNA
assessment to confirm HCV infection [1,14]. ALT, aspartate transaminase (AST), GGT, glucose, triglycerides and
cholesterol were measured by standard laboratory methods after 8-hr fasting. Insulin was measured by radioimmuno-assay (ADVIA Insulin Ready Pack 100, Bayer
Diagnostics, Milan, Italy), with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation < 5%. FL was diagnosed by the same
operator at ultrasonography [6]. Weight, stature, circumferences (waist and hip) and skinfolds (triceps, biceps,
subscapular and suprailiac) were measured by two trained
dietitians who had been standardized before and during
the study according to standard procedures [15]. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/stature
(m)2 and the sum of 4 skinfolds by summing triceps,
biceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds [16,17]. The
7DD was administered to the subjects by two trained dietitians, who discussed it with the subject when she/he
returned it one week later [18]. To avoid the confounding
effect of seasonality on food intake, the 7DD diary was
administered to a similar number of patients with and
without SLD each month [19]. Mean daily ethanol intake
was calculated as the mean value of ethanol intake as
assessed by the 7DD [20]. The study protocol was
approved and supervised by the Scientific Committee of
the Fondo per lo Studio delle Malattie del Fegato (Trieste,
Italy), and all subjects gave their written informed consent
to participate.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are given as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) because of skewed distributions. Comparisons of continuous variables between subjects with
and without FL were performed with the Mann-Whitney
test and those of nominal variables with the Fisher's exact
test. To identify candidate predictors of FL, we performed
a stepwise logistic regression analysis on 1000 bootstrap
samples of 496 subjects (probability to enter = 0.05 and
probability to remove = 0.1) [21]. All variables besides
gender were evaluated as continuous predictors. Linearity
of logits was ascertained using the Box-Tidwell procedure
[22]. To obtain a linear logit, we transformed age using
the coefficient suggested by the Box-Tidwell procedure
[(age/10) ∧ 4.9255] and ALT, AST, GGT, insulin and triglycerides using natural logarithms (loge). The logits of the
other predictors (BMI, waist circumference, glucose, cholesterol, ethanol and the sum of 4 skinfolds) were linear.

Candidate predictors identified at bootstrap analysis were
evaluated using three stepwise logistic models before
obtaining a final prediction model (probability to enter =
0.01 and probability to remove = 0.02; these more stringent levels were used to protect against type I errors). The
goodness of fit of the models was evaluated using the
Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and their accuracy was
assessed by calculating the non-parametric area (AUC)
under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) [23,24]. The standard errors of
the regression coefficients of the final model were calculated using 1000 bootstrap samples of 496 subjects. The
probabilities obtained from the final model were multiplied by 100 to obtain the fatty liver index (FLI). The sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive likelihood ratio
(LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 10-value
intervals of FLI were calculated [23]. Statistical analysis
was performed using STATA 9.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
Results
Table 1 gives the characteristics of the subjects with and
without FL. FL was more frequent among males than
females (54 vs. 34%). Age, ethanol intake and cholesterol
did not differ between subjects with and without FL. On
the contrary, ALT, AST, GGT, BMI, waist circumference,
the sum of 4 skinfolds, glucose, insulin and triglycerides
were significantly higher in subjects with than in those
without FL.
Figure 1 (Model 1) gives the number of times each of the
13 variables of interest was selected by bootstrapped stepwise logistic regression. The predictors identified most frequently were insulin (93%), triglycerides (91%), BMI
(78%), gender (77%), GGT (77%) and age (64%). When
these 6 predictors were entered into the stepwise model,
age did not remain in the model (p = 0.0766; model not
shown). The model based on the remaining 5 predictors
fitted well (p = 0.9976, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic) and
had a ROC-AUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.82–0.89; model not
shown).
Since insulin is not routinely measured, we tested whether
its removal from the model would decrease the accuracy
of the estimate. After exclusion of insulin, the predictors
most frequently identified were triglycerides (100%),
GGT (80%), BMI (79%), ALT (70%), the sum of 4 skinfolds (68%) and gender (67%) (Figure 1, Model 2). When
these 6 predictors were entered into the stepwise model,
ALT did not enter it (p = 0.0780; model not shown). The
model based on the 5 remaining predictors fitted well (p
= 0.9704, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic) and had a ROCAUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.81–0.88; model not shown).
Since skinfolds are not routinely measured, we tested
whether their removal from the model would decrease the
accuracy of the estimate. After exclusion of the sum of 4
skinfolds, the predictors identified most frequently were
triglycerides (100%), BMI (95%), ALT (77%), GGT (73%)
and waist circumference (58%) (Figure 1, Model 3).
When these 5 predictors were entered into the stepwise
model, ALT did not enter it (p = 0.0241; p to remove =
0.0200; model not shown). The model based on the
remaining 4 predictors fitted well (p = 0.9704, HosmerLemeshow statistic) and had a ROC-AUC of 0.85 (95%CI
0.81–0.88; model not shown).
A comparison of the ROC-AUCs of Models 2 (p = 0.6320;
Bonferroni's correction) and 3 (p = 0.1038) vs. Model 1
revealed no difference so that we choose Model 3 for further analysis. The bootstrapped regression coefficients of
Model 3 are given in Table 2. We multiplied the probabilTable 1: Measurements of subjects with and without fatty liver.

ities generated by Model 3 per 100 to obtain a score comprised between 0 and 100, which we call the "fatty liver
index" (FLI). FLI is thus calculated as:
FLI = (e 0.953*loge (triglycerides) + 0.139*BMI + 0.718*loge (ggt) +
0.053*waist circumference - 15.745) / (1 + e 0.953*loge (triglycerides) +
0.139*BMI + 0.718*loge (ggt) + 0.053*waist circumference - 15.745) * 100 
As shown by the standardized regression coefficients, the
greatest contribution to the prediction of FL came from
waist circumference, followed by BMI, triglycerides and
GGT. Table 3 gives the SN, SP, LR+ and LR- for 10-unit
intervals of FLI. A FLI < 30 can be used to rule out (SN =
87%; LR- = 0.2) and a FLI ≥ 60 to rule in hepatic steatosis
(SP = 86%; LR+ = 4.3).
Discussion
We used data from the Dionysos Nutrition & Liver Study
to develop a simple algorithm for the prediction of FL. Age
was not associated with FL in any of the multivariable
models while gender lost its association with FL after
exclusion of insulin and skinfolds. Ethanol intake was not
associated with FL in any of the models. Thus, at least at
the values of intake observed in the Dionysos Nutrition &
Liver Study, ethanol is not a risk factor for FL in the general population of Northern Italy.
Waist circumference and BMI were the strongest predictors of FL in the final model. Together with the lack of
association of FL with ethanol intake, this finding strongly
supports the hypothesis that obesity is the main responsible of the current epidemic of FL [1,4,6]. It is of some
interest that waist circumference did not add to the prediction of FL when skinfolds were in the model but, from a
practical viewpoint, there is no need to measure skinfolds
for predicting FL.
Among liver enzymes, only GGT was an independent predictor of FL while AST was not associated with FL in any
of the models and ALT was not an independent predictor
of FL. We have previously shown that ALT is not a surrogate marker of NAFLD and the present study extends this
consideration to the entire spectrum of FL disease [1].
Insulin was the predictor most frequently selected for
inclusion in Model 1 and was the second most important
predictor after BMI in the same model (data not shown).
Thus, we confirm that insulin is an independent risk factor for FL in the general population [12]. It is of some
interest that waist circumference did not add to the prediction of FL when insulin was in the model but that it was
the strongest predictor of FL in the final model. This cannot be easily explained by the known association between
waist and insulin (resistance) because BMI is similarly
correlated with this latter [25,26] as also observed in this
study (data not shown). Triglycerides were independent
predictors of FL in all models, confirming our previous
findings [16]. Glucose and cholesterol were not predictors
of FL even if it may be noticed that the selection of glucose
as potential predictor increased after exclusion of insulin
from the model.
The main limitations of the Dionysos Nutrition & Liver
Study are the suboptimal respondent rate (58%) and the
fact that ultrasonography cannot detect steatohepatitis
(SH) [1]. This latter diagnosis can be obtained only by
biopsy and, because of obvious ethical reasons, a SH score
will never be available in a representative sample of the
general population [3]. Scores developed in clinical series
may be used for this purpose but they have not been
tested in the general population [27,28].
Conclusion
The "fatty Liver index" (FLI) we developed is accurate and
easy to employ as BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides
and GGT are routine measurements in clinical practice
[7,29,30]. In our population, a FLI < 30 ruled out and a
FLI ≥ 60 ruled in hepatic steatosis as detected by ultrasonography. Potential clinical uses of FLI include the
selection of subjects to be referred for ultrasonography
and the identification of patients for intensified lifestyle
counseling [30,31]. On the research side, FLI may be used
to select subjects at greater risk of FL for planning observational or interventional studies [30,32]. Even though, for
reasons of biological plausibility and coherence with previous studies [5,6,8], we expect that the parameters
employed by FLI will be predictors of FL in Western countries besides Italy, it is very important that FLI be validated
in external populations before it is employed in practice.
