Abstract
Background
Previous clinical trials and institutional studies have demonstrated that surgery for the treatment of obesity (termed bariatric or metabolic surgery) reduces all-cause mortality and the
development of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. The current study analysed large-scale population studies to
assess the association of bariatric surgery with long-term mortality and incidence of newonset obesity-related disease at a national level.
Methods and findings
A systematic literature search of Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and Web of Science was
performed. Articles were included if they were national or regional administrative database
cohort studies reporting comparative risk of long-term mortality or incident obesity-related
diseases for patients who have undergone any form of bariatric surgery compared with an
appropriate control group with a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. Meta-analysis of
hazard ratios (HRs) was performed for mortality risk, and pooled odds ratios (PORs) were
calculated for discrete variables relating to incident disease. Eighteen studies were identified
as suitable for inclusion. There were 1,539,904 patients included in the analysis, with
269,818 receiving bariatric surgery and 1,270,086 control patients. Bariatric surgery was
associated with a reduced rate of all-cause mortality (POR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.69, p <
0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (POR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71, p < 0.001). Bariatric
surgery was strongly associated with reduced incidence of T2DM (POR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18
to 0.83, p = 0.010), hypertension (POR 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.40, p < 0.001), dyslipidaemia
(POR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80, p = 0.010), and ischemic heart disease (POR 0.46, 95% CI
0.29 to 0.73, p = 0.001). Limitations of the study include that it was not possible to account
for unmeasured variables, which may not have been equally distributed between patient

groups given the non-randomised design of the studies included. There was also heterogeneity between studies in the nature of the control group utilised, and potential adverse outcomes related to bariatric surgery were not specifically examined due to a lack of available
data.
Conclusions
This pooled analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced long-term
all-cause mortality and incidence of obesity-related disease in patients with obesity for the
whole operated population. The results suggest that broader access to bariatric surgery for
people with obesity may reduce the long-term sequelae of this disease and provide population-level benefits.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Surgical treatment for obesity (known as bariatric or metabolic surgery) has been suggested to reduce risk of death in people with obesity and decrease development of other
medical conditions including diabetes, heart disease, and certain forms of cancer.
• This study aimed to analyse pooled data from previously published studies utilising data
from national or regional administrative databases in order to examine the effect of bariatric surgery at a population level.
What did the researchers do and find?
• This study pooled data from published research articles utilising large administrative
databases (with information from over 1.5 million patients)
• The results suggested that bariatric surgery was associated with reduced risk of death,
and decreased incidence of new-onset diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
and heart disease.
What do these findings mean?
• These findings suggest that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced risk of premature death or developing other medical conditions in people with obesity at a population
level.
• Increased availability of bariatric surgery may help to improve health outcomes for
these individuals.

Introduction
Obesity is a worldwide pandemic, with 39% of the worldwide adult population being considered overweight [1]. Mean worldwide body mass index (BMI) has been steadily increasing
since 1975, and current trends predict that 20% of the global population will be classified as
having obesity (BMI � 30 kg/m2
) by 2030 [1,2]. In the UK, 27% of the population is already
classified as having obesity [3]. Billions of dollars are spent annually worldwide to curb this
health crisis, alongside the development of government public health initiatives [2,4].
Secondary to smoking, obesity has been identified as the leading cause of preventable premature death in the US [5]. Obesity predisposes individuals to a plethora of adverse conditions
and is an established risk factor for overall all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [6–9]. Although multiple therapeutic options for the treatment of
patients with obesity are available, bariatric surgery has been established as the most effective
method of achieving sustained weight loss in these patients [10,11]. Bariatric surgery has also
been associated with reduced overall mortality rates in patients with obesity [12] and leads to
remission of obesity-related disease [10,11,13]. Bariatric surgery has also been associated with
an overall reduction in the risk of developing multiple cancer types [14–16].
Current national guidance in the UK recommends that bariatric surgery be considered for
patients who have a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or more, or a BMI between 35 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2 if
other significant obesity-related comorbidities are present [17]. Patients with new-onset
T2DM may also be considered for surgery at lower BMI (�30 kg/m2
). Despite the presence of
these criteria and evidence that patients are healthier and more functional following bariatric
surgery, far less than 1% of eligible patients receive bariatric surgery [18,19]. Data from the UK
National Bariatric Surgery Registry establish that at the time of primary surgery 53.9% of men
and 41.4% of women already have a high level of co-existing disease (defined as 4 or more obesity-related diseases) [20]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that improving pathways
to bariatric surgery can reduce the healthcare burden upon individuals and lead to overall
healthcare cost savings [21].
Results from previous pooled analyses have demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduces
long-term all-cause mortality [22,23]. However, these studies also included data from clinical
trials and single-institution studies, which may lack external validity compared to data collected independently in population studies undertaken using administrative datasets. The
present study aimed to investigate, in people with severe and complex obesity, the influence of
bariatric surgery on overall long-term mortality and prevention of incident obesity-related disease at a population level.
Methods
A systematic literature search of Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and Web of Science was performed using the search criteria as follows: (“Bariatric Surgery”[MeSH] OR bariatric surgery)
AND (mortality OR survival OR diabetes OR metabolic OR hypertension OR sleep apnoea
OR cardiac OR angina OR heart disease OR myocardial infarction OR dyslipidaemia OR dyslipidemia OR thromboembolism) AND (national OR registry OR population) (S1 Text). Two
authors (TW and NG) performed the electronic literature search independently, which was
last updated in January 2020. The literature search dates included any studies published
between 1 January 2000 and 31 January 2020. Studies published prior to 2000 were excluded to
ensure all data were contemporaneous and applicable to present-day bariatric surgical practice. The electronic search was supplemented by a hand-search of published abstracts from relevant specialist conference meetings. Reference lists of all relevant studies were also reviewed

to identify potentially relevant studies. The protocol for this study was not prospectively registered in any repository for systematic reviews.
Identified abstracts were independently scrutinised by 2 reviewers (TW and NG) to determine eligibility for inclusion. Any discrepancies regarding study inclusion from the literature
search were settled by discussion with a third author (SRM). Studies were included if they
were either national or regional administrative database cohort studies reporting comparative
risk of long-term mortality or incident obesity-related diseases for patients who have undergone any form of bariatric surgery compared to an appropriate control group (i.e., with a clinical diagnosis of obesity) with a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. For the purposes of
this study, obesity-related diseases were defined as T2DM, hypertension, obstructive sleep
apnoea, cardiac disease (ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure), dyslipidaemia, and venous
thromboembolism. Studies that only provided details on remission of obesity-related diseases
existing prior to bariatric surgery (as opposed to new onset) were not included. Any study that
was not a population-based study utilising data from an administrative database (including
randomised controlled trials and single-institution studies) was excluded. This selection criterion was imposed to ensure that results from all included studies could be directly applied at a
population level. This led to randomised controlled studies, and cohort studies that did not utilise a population-registry-based data design, being excluded as results from these studies may
be representative of only the highly specialised units participating in such studies and would
lack external validity when applied to the general population of patients receiving bariatric surgery. In the situation where 2 studies utilised the same registry data and reported on the same
outcome measure, and therefore potentially contained duplicate data, the most recent study
was selected for inclusion. Only English-language studies were included.
Data from eligible studies were extracted into a computerised spreadsheet for analysis. Data
were collected for overall all-cause long-term mortality and new-onset obesity-related comorbidities. Authors of individual studies were not specifically contacted to obtain more detailed
results than those available in the main publication and published appendices. Mortality was
evaluated according to reported HRs to minimise the effect of patient dropouts, whereas obesity-related diseases were primarily analysed directly according to event rates in each group.
Event rate analysis was used for the primary analysis of obesity-related disease, as a greater
proportion of included studies reported these data, but outcomes were also analysed according
to adjusted odds ratios (ORs) where these data were available, for confirmatory purposes.
Statistical analysis was performed using StatsDirect 3.2.9. Pooled outcome measures were
determined using random effects models as described by DerSimonian and Laird [24]. Heterogeneity amongst the trials was assessed by Cochran Q statistic, a null hypothesis test in which
p < 0.05 is taken to indicate the presence of heterogeneity, and the I
2 statistic, which describes
the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity. The Egger test was used to
assess the funnel plot for asymmetry, indicating possible publication or other biases.
Results
The literature search identified 18 studies suitable for inclusion [25–42]. Fig 1 provides details
of the PRISMA flowchart for the literature search. In total there were 1,539,904 patients
included in the analysis, with 269,818 patients receiving bariatric surgery and 1,270,086 control
patients. The types of surgery were gastric bypass (n = 137,578, 51%), sleeve gastrectomy
(n = 58,916, 22%), adjustable gastric band (n = 52,973, 20%), vertical banded gastroplasty
(n = 6,397, 2%), biliopancreatic diversion (with or without duodenal switch) (n = 1,002, 0.4%),
and an alternative procedure or unspecified operation (n = 12,952, 5%) (S1 Table). Median follow-up across all studies was 59 months (range 18 to 144 months).

Patient demographic details for all studies are provided in Table 1. Quality assessment of
studies was undertaken with the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (S2 Table) [43]. The majority of studies used patients with a diagnosis of obesity as the control group, although a group of patients
without a diagnosis of obesity was utilised as the control group in 1 study [26]. All studies
except this one scored 4 stars for patient selection (rated out of 4) [25,27–42]. Studies that
did not report BMI for control and surgery groups scored only 1 star for comparability
[26,28,29,39–42]. All studies scored the maximum 3 stars for exposure.
All-cause mortality
Eleven studies reported a significant reduction in relative risk of long-term all-cause mortality
for patients following bariatric surgery compared to controls [25,28,30–32,36,37,38,39,41,42],
with a pooled OR (POR) of 0.62 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.69, p < 0.001). There was some evidence of
statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 39.03, p < 0.001; I
2 = 71.8%) but no evidence of bias
(Egger intercept = −0.31, p = 0.714) (Fig 2).

Cardiovascular mortality
Three studies reported significantly reduced relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for
patients following bariatric surgery compared to controls [36,38,41] (POR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to
0.71, p < 0.001). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 2.82,
p = 0.24; I
2 = 29.2%), and too few strata to assess for bias.

New-onset type 2 diabetes
Six studies reported a reduction in incident T2DM after bariatric surgery compared to controls
[26,30,32,33,35,37] (POR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.83, p = 0.010) (Fig 3). There was significant
evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 824.8, p < 0.001; I
2 = 99.4%) but no evidence of bias (Egger intercept = 8.18, p = 0.069).
New-onset hypertension
Five studies reported that incident hypertension was reduced after bariatric surgery compared
to controls [30–32,34,37] (POR 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.40, p < 0.001) (Fig 4). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 5.90, p = 0.21; I
2 = 32.2%) and no evidence of
bias (Egger intercept = −0.32, p = 0.92).
New-onset obstructive sleep apnoea
Only 1 study reported incident obstructive sleep apnoea relative to controls, and therefore it
was not possible to do a pooled analysis [37]. This individual study reported a reduced rate of
new-onset obstructive sleep apnoea in patients undergoing bariatric surgery (new-onset

obstructive sleep apnoea rate of 1.1%) compared to controls (2.0%) (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–
0.82, p = 0.004) [37].
New-onset dyslipidaemia
Two studies reported significantly reduced incident dyslipidaemia following bariatric surgery
compared to controls [32,34] (POR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80, p = 0.010) (S1 Fig). There was
evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 69.5, p < 0.001; I
2 = 98.6%), and too few
strata to assess for bias.
New-onset ischemic heart disease
Five studies reported significantly reduced incident ischemic heart disease after bariatric surgery compared to controls [30,31,37,38,40] (POR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, p = 0.001). There
was evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 18.9, p < 0.001; I
2 = 78.8%) but no evidence of bias (Egger intercept = −5.62, p = 0.119) (S2 Fig).
New-onset cardiac failure
Two studies reported the rate of incident cardiac failure [29,31] and found no statistically significant protective association with bariatric surgery (POR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.10,
p = 0.066). There was significant evidence of statistical heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 32.5, p <
0.001; I
2 = 96.9%), and too few strata to assess for bias.
Development of venous thromboembolism
Only 1 study reported incident venous thromboembolism in bariatric surgery patients relative
to controls, and therefore it was not possible to undertake a pooled analysis [27]. This individual study demonstrated a reduced incidence of new-onset venous thromboembolism in bariatric surgery patients (1.7%) compared to controls (4.4%) (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84,
p = 0.003) [27].

Comorbidity analysis by adjusted ORs
Adjusted ORs for incident comorbidities were analysed separately in order to confirm results
identified during event rate analysis. These results demonstrated the same patterns identified

0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.90, p = 0.009), and cardiac failure (POR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64, p <

Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced allcause long-term mortality compared to appropriate control patients at a population level. This

Mortality and incidence of obesity-related disease after bariatric surgery

is consistent with the findings of the Swedish Obese Subjects observational study, which demonstrated decreased overall mortality in patients with obesity who received bariatric surgery
[12]. This association was also identified in previous meta-analyses that had included data
from non-population-based clinical trials [22,23,44]. The current results establish that these
findings are generalisable to the population at large and are not just limited to patients receiving bariatric surgery within specialised centres participating in clinical trials or publishing
individual series.
The present study also suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced incidence
of obesity-related disease including T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. The relative risk
reductions associated with bariatric surgery were 61%, 64%, and 77% for the development of
T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, respectively. These data demonstrate the potential
protective association of bariatric surgery with prevention of these obesity-related diseases.
Bariatric surgery was also specifically associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality
and development of ischemic heart disease. Bariatric surgery has previously been associated
with a reduction in both macrovascular (including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular
events) and microvascular (including retinal complications, diabetic kidney disease, and
peripheral neuropathy) complications relating to T2DM [10,40,45]. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality is likely accounted for by the modification of comorbidities that are known
cardiovascular risk factors (T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia), as suggested in the present study.

In addition to prevention of new-onset disease, bariatric surgery effectively improves preexisting diseases including T2DM [10,11,46,47], dyslipidaemia [46,47], and hypertension [47].
Some of the included studies also identified improvements in remission of these diseases at a
population level. Thereaux et al. [33] established that discontinuation of antidiabetic medications
for patients in France with pre-existing T2DM was significantly greater in patients receiving bariatric surgery compared to controls (−49.9% versus −9.0%, p < 0.001) [33]. Population studies
from Israel and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink have identified similar results
[32,37]. In a separate study also included in the present analysis, Thereaux et al. [34] identified
that bariatric surgery was significantly associated with discontinuation of therapy for pre-existing
hypertension and dyslipidaemia relative to having obesity but not having bariatric surgery [34].
Following surgery, most patients remain in the overweight or class 1 obesity BMI category
(BMI 25–35 kg/m2
). From data currently available, it is unclear if the overall mortality rate for
patients following surgery decreases to that of the general population, decreases to that of the
new equivalent BMI category, or is persistently elevated due to the period of time spent at an
even higher BMI. In data from 5 Nordic countries, the standardised mortality rate (SMR) of
patients receiving bariatric surgery was improved compared to non-operated patients with
obesity (SMR 0.63, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.66), although mortality for these patients was still significantly increased relative to the general non-obese population (SMR 1.94, 95% CI 1.83 to 2.05)
[41]. Increased BMI class has been strongly associated development of disease and increased
mortality risk [48–50]; therefore, elevated mortality relative to the general population may
relate to ongoing effects of existing disease before surgery. Determining the ongoing mortality

rate of patients following bariatric surgery relative to non-operated individuals within their
new BMI classification remains an area for future population-based research.
Data from the UK National Bariatric Surgery Registry indicate that over 80% of patients
receiving surgery have several obesity-related diseases [20]. Although most therefore have the
chance to improve existing disease with bariatric surgery, our data enable us to quantify the
relative risk reduction for developing disease in those disease-free at presentation. Knowledge
of the relative risk reductions of 61%, 64%, and 77% for the diagnosis of incident T2DM,
hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, respectively, for bariatric surgery patients relative to controls
may aid the discussions between healthcare professionals and people with obesity as to
whether bariatric surgery should be undertaken.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has limitations that may affect interpretation of the results. All the studies included
were large-scale, non-randomised comparative studies based upon registry data. It is therefore
not possible to account for potentially important confounding variables, which may not have
been equally distributed between patient groups given the non-randomised design of the studies included. One potential example is socioeconomic status, which is known to be an important predictor of all-cause mortality [51]. Previous evidence indicates that patients receiving
bariatric surgery may have higher education levels and income than controls, and socioeconomic status may have influenced results [52,53]. Another example would be the higher rate of
alcohol abuse disorders and schizophrenia within the control group of the study by Arterburn
et al. [25] included in the present analysis. However, these large-scale studies, a strength of the
paper, were selected to explore the association of bariatric surgery with long-term mortality
and incidence of new obesity-related disease at a population level, with this natural variation
in patient factors. The majority of studies compared results from patients receiving bariatric
surgery to those of an appropriate control group, with only 1 study unable to select control
group patients who also had a diagnosis of obesity [26].
An additional potential source of bias is that patients receiving bariatric surgery would have
been managed within a weight loss management pathway including non-surgical treatments
for obesity and close monitoring of obesity-related diseases. As the control cohorts for the
studies included were taken from the general population, these individuals would likely not
have been receiving any non-surgical treatment of obesity, and obesity-related diseases would
likely have been less closely monitored, potentially influencing the risk of developing these diseases. It is not possible from the current dataset to evaluate separately the influence of bariatric
surgery and non-surgical interventions for treatment of obesity within weight loss management programmes on rates of incident disease, and this may have led to an overestimate of the
beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.
This potential source of bias can be reduced by comparing outcomes of patients receiving
bariatric surgery to patients seeking treatment for obesity within a specialised medical treatment service including individual- or group-based lifestyle intervention programmes. This
approach has been undertaken in a previous study by Jakobsen et al. [54] investigating longterm medical complications in a single-institution cohort of patients receiving bariatric surgery or specialised medical treatment for obesity. However, due to the population-based
nature of the studies included in our analysis, it was not possible to identify which patients
within the non-surgical control group may have received non-surgical treatment of obesity.
Due to heterogeneity in the definition of pre-existing disease, along with differences in the
definition of remission, we did not examine disease remission rates. It was also not possible to
perform a specific analysis of outcomes by procedure type in the current analysis. Our study

also did not examine specific procedure-related complications or measures of adverse outcomes associated with bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is known to be extremely safe, with
low peri-operative mortality and complication rates [55–57]. Although other long-term potential complications of bariatric surgery exist (including gastroesophageal reflux [58], internal
herniation [59], and trace element malnutrition [60]), these issues are relatively uncommon in
modern bariatric surgical practice, and management strategies are available to treat these conditions should they occur. Finally, from the perspective of statistical analysis, the Egger test
was utilised to measure for the presence of potential bias. This test is considered to be most
reliable when greater than 10 studies are included within the analysis. Due to the limited number of studies included in some of the analyses presented here, some of these bias assessments
must be interpreted carefully, although we have chosen to report these results as they still provide an indication of the presence of any potential bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first published study of pooled data from population-based
studies of incident disease following bariatric surgery. Our results represent real-world data
that may be generalisable to routine clinical practice. As further data accumulate, it may
become clearer whether bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of new-onset obstructive sleep
apnoea or venous thromboembolism. Another significant strength of the current study is that
due to the nature of data collection from administrative datasets, follow-up data (such as mortality and rate of incident obesity-related disease) are externally validated outside each of the
individual studies as part of the administrative database collection. This allows for completeness of data collection regarding these aspects and removes the inherent difficulties with
patient follow-up data within single-institution-based studies. One method utilised to circumvent this issue within institutional studies has been to link study participants directly to data
contained within administrative datasets, and this methodology was utilised successfully by
Adams et al. for patients in Utah [47]. This study was not included in the present meta-analysis
as all surgical patients had been collected from a single centre, although results were consistent
with those identified in the current analysis (OR of incident obesity-related diseases in the surgical cohort 0.08 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.24] for T2DM, 0.23 [95% CI 0.11 to 0.49] for hypertension,
and 0.12 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.46] for dyslipidaemia [47]). Results from the Swedish Obese Subjects study were also excluded from the present analysis as this study did not use a populationbased design methodology, rather individuals within the control group responded to a nationwide advert [61,62]. However, results from this study also support the findings identified here,
with bariatric surgery being associated with reduced long-term mortality (HR 0.71, 95% CI
0.54 to 0.92) [12], decreased development of T2DM (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.21) [63], and
reduced incidence of cardiovascular events (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.54 to 0.83) [64].
Conclusion
This meta-analysis of large-scale registry studies indicates that patients receiving bariatric surgery have improved long-term mortality rates compared to controls at a population level. They
also have significantly reduced incidence of obesity-related disease including T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and ischemic heart disease. Healthcare providers may use the data on
relative risk reduction as part of the discussion with patients considering bariatric surgery.
