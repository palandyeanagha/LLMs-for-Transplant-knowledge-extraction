The vascular endothelium controls vasomotor tone and microvascular flow and regulates trafficking of nutrients and biologically active molecules. When endothelial activation is excessive, compromised microcirculation and subsequent cellular hypoxia contribute to the risk of organ failure. We hypothesized that strict blood
glucose control with insulin during critical illness protects the endothelium, mediating prevention of organ
failure and death. In this preplanned subanalysis of a large, randomized controlled study, intensive insulin
therapy lowered circulating levels ofICAM-1 and tended to reduce E-selectin levels in patients with prolonged
critical illness, which reflects reduced endothelial activation. This effect was not brought about by altered levels of endothelial stimuli, such as cytokines or VEGF, or by upregulation of eNOS. In contrast, prevention of
hyperglycemia by intensive insulin therapy suppressed iNOS gene expression in postmortem liver and skeletal
muscle, possibly in part via reduced NF-κB activation, and lowered the elevated circulating NO levels in both
survivors and nonsurvivors. These effects on the endothelium statistically explained a significant part of the
improved patient outcome with intensive insulin therapy. In conclusion, maintaining normoglycemia with
intensive insulin therapy during critical illness protects the endothelium, likely in part via inhibition of excessive iNOS-induced NO release, and thereby contributes to prevention of organ failure and death.
Introduction
Critically ill patients requiring intensive care for more than a few
days have a high risk of death (1). Mostintensive care deaths beyond
the first few days of critical illness are attributable to nonresolving
organ failure, either due to or coinciding with sepsis. An increased
susceptibility to infections and the sequelae of an excessive systemic
inflammatory response to infection and injury play a role.
The vascular endothelium controls vasomotor tone and microvascular flow and regulates trafficking of nutrients and several
biologically active molecules (2, 3). Local activation of the endothelium is crucial for infection control, but widespread systemic
endothelial activation may lead to deleterious consequences(3, 4).
In the process of endothelial cell activation, expression of adhesion
molecules such as E- and P-selectin, ICAMs, and VCAMs on the
cell surface is induced. These adhesion molecules activate leukocytes and increase rolling and strong adherence of leukocytes to
the endothelium with subsequent migration into the underlying
tissue (3). Endothelial production and shedding of adhesion molecules is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and growth
factors, such as VEGF, expressed and released by injured tissues.
Release of reactive oxygen species and several proteases by activated leukocytes further contributes to endothelial cell and tissue
damage. Other consequences of endothelial activation and damage include increased microvascular permeability with capillary
leakage and coagulopathy (2, 4). Obstruction of the microcirculatory blood vessels,resulting from excessive leukocyte adhesion and
aggregation together with intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, hampers perfusion, thus bringing about cellular hypoxia,
which may lead to organ failure and death (2, 3).
NO is pivotal in this process via its vasodilatory properties and
through its control of the interaction between the endothelium
and leukocytes. NO results from l-arginine oxidation by a family
of enzymes called NOS. There are 2 constitutive NOS isoforms,
neuronal NOS (nNOS) and eNOS. nNOS was first described in
brain, but other tissues, such as spinal cord and skeletal muscle,
also express nNOS (5). Likewise, although eNOS is predominantly expressed in the endothelium, it is also detectable in other cell
types, including hepatocytes and muscle cells (reviewed in refs. 6,
7). iNOS is an isoform that can be induced by several stimuli in
virtually every cell type (reviewed in ref. 8). Low concentrations of
NO, generated in basal circumstances by the constitutive enzyme
eNOS, have been shown to exert antiadhesive and protective properties, whereas high NO concentrations, generated predominantly
by iNOS, are proinflammatory and may evoke organ damage in
conditions of ischemia and reperfusion (9) (Figure 1).
In a recent large, randomized controlled study of surgical intensive care patients, we showed that the use of intensive insulin therapy to maintain strict normoglycemia reduced the risk of organ
failure and death (10). The intervention beneficially affected innate
immunity (11), exerted an antiinflammatory effect (12), improved
the deranged lipid profile (13), and protected hepatocytic mitochondrial ultrastructure and function (14). We here hypothesize
thatstrict blood glucose control with insulin during critical illness
also protectsthe endothelium, which in turn islikely to play a role
in the observed prevention of organ failure and reduced mortality. Since eNOS gene transcription and activity are known to be
upregulated by insulin (6), and iNOS activation may be downregulated by insulin and through the prevention of hyperglycemia, we
hypothesized that such effects of insulin would mediate endotheNonstandard abbreviations used: CI, confidence interval; CRP, C-reactive protein;

lial protection (Figure 1). We tested this hypothesis by studying
the effect of intensive insulin therapy on circulating levels of the
adhesion moleculesICAM-1 and E-selectin and endothelialstimuli
such as VEGF and cytokines; by quantifying tissue gene expression
and protein levels of different members of the NOS family and
involvement of NF-κB activation as a possible regulatory mechanism; and by measuring circulating NO levels.
Results
Blood glucose control and clinical outcome. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of all patients with prolonged critical illness
(intensive care unit [ICU] stay of at least 1 week) and Table 2
those of all nonsurvivors from whom biopsies were available,
randomized for conventional
or intensive insulin therapy (see
Methods for a description of
patients and randomization).
Blood glucose levels upon
admission were comparable in
both treatment groups. According to the study protocol, mean
morning blood glucose levels were
significantly lower in the group
receiving intensive insulin therapy (normoglycemia) than in the
group undergoing conventional
treatment (Figure 2). In the former
group, higher insulin doses were
needed to achieve the targeted glucose levels (Figure 2). Glucose control was maintained until the last
study day. As in the whole study
population (10), in this group of
patients with prolonged critical
illness, intensive insulin therapy
significantly reduced mortality,
the incidence of bacteremia, the
risk of acute renal failure requiring
dialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, the need for
mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the ICU (Table
3). The need for glucocorticoid administration was similar in the
2 treatment groups. Of the patients with prolonged critical illness,
32% in the conventional and 36% in the intensive insulin therapy
group received glucocorticoids at some time during intensive care
(P = 0.3). Glucocorticoids were more often needed in nonsurvivors
than survivors, a reflection of the severity of disease, but among
the nonsurvivors, similar fractions of the conventional (53%) and
intensive (56%) groups received glucocorticoid therapy (P = 0.8).
All the effects of intensive insulin therapy described below were
unaffected by glucocorticoid treatment or by the presence of bacteremia (data not shown).
Figure 1
Simplified concept and rationale of the 
study. Low concentrations of NO, normally generated by eNOS, are likely to be 
beneficial for the endothelium and organ 
function, whereas high concentrations of 
NO, generated via iNOS induction, may 
contribute to endothelium dysfunction, 
excessive vasodilation, extravasation, 
and tissue injury. Insulin-titrated prevention of hyperglycemia during critical illness may theoretically protect the 
endothelium via its effects on eNOS and 
iNOS expression and activity.

The levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP)
were systematically evaluated during ICU stay (Figure 2). Compared with conventional therapy, intensive insulin therapy lowered
serum CRP levels at all time points. The levels of CRP on day 7
were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors.
Shedded adhesion molecules: serum ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels.
Serum ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels upon ICU admission were
comparable between patients in the conventional and intensive
insulin treatment groups (Figure 3). Serum ICAM-1 levels were
strongly increased on day 7 in both treatment groups, but this
rise was a median 14% lower in the patients who received intensive insulin therapy compared with conventional insulin therapy
(Figure 3; P = 0.009). In contrast to ICAM-1 levels, day 7 levels of
E-selectin were not higher than the levels at admission (Figure 3).
Nevertheless, E-selectin levels at day 7 tended to be lower (13%
median reduction; P = 0.08) in intensive insulin–treated patients
compared with those receiving conventional therapy.
Univariate analysis revealed that ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels
were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (P < 0.0001 and
P = 0.01, respectively). Elevated levels of ICAM-I and E-selectin
were also associated with the risk for developing acute renal
failure (data not shown). A weak, albeit highly significant,
correlation was observed between CRP and ICAM-1 levels
(r = 0.326; P < 0.0001) and between CRP and E-selectin levels
(r = 0.277; P < 0.0001).
Endothelial stimuli. Serum VEGF
levels upon ICU admission were
comparable between patients in the
conventional and intensive insulin treatment groups [median, 427
pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR],
213–640 pg/ml) versus 320 pg/ml
(IQR, 152–552 pg/ml), respectively;
P = 0.2]. Day 7 serum VEGF levels
were a median 2-fold higher than
the admission levels, irrespective of
the insulin treatment (835 pg/ml
[IQR, 471–1,336 pg/ml] in the conventional group and 786 pg/ml
[468–1,216 pg/ml] in the intensive
insulin group; P = 0.5]. VEGF levels
were lower in nonsurvivors than in
survivors (P = 0.04). Lower VEGF
levels were also associated with the
risk for developing acute renal failure (data not shown).
Upon admission to ICU, patients
in the conventional and intensive insulin therapy groups had
equal serum levels of all studied cytokines (data not shown). As
compared with conventional therapy, intensive insulin therapy
only significantly lowered serum IL-10 concentrations on day 5
(45 pg/ml [IQR, 21–105 pg/ml] in the conventional group and
32 pg/ml [IQR, 13–73 pg/ml] in the intensive insulin group;
P = 0.01) and day 15 (60 pg/ml [IQR, 21–101 pg/ml] in the conventional group and 32 pg/ml [13–72 pg/ml] in the intensive
insulin group; P = 0.007) and tended to lower serum IL-6 levels
only on the last day of intensive care (62 pg/ml [IQR, 23–173
pg/ml] in the conventional group and 43 pg/ml [16–124 pg/ml]
in the intensive insulin group; P = 0.07).
The cytokine profiles over time for all 405 patients together are
shown in Table 4. Levels ofseveral cytokinessignificantly increased
with time in intensive care, whereas levels of others decreased.
Univariate analysis revealed higher day 5 levels of IL-5 (P = 0.04)
and IL-8 (P = 0.0003) in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Both very
low and very high levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were associated with an
increased risk of death (Figure 4).
Serum IL-6 levels correlated positively with CRP levels on admission day (r = 0.165; P = 0.004), day 5 (r = 0.323; P < 0.0001), day
15 (r = 0.330; P < 0.0001), and on the last day of intensive care
(r = 0.315; P < 0.0001). No clinically relevant correlation wasfound
between levels ofserum ICAM-1, E-selectin, and any of the studied
cytokines (data not shown).

Tissue gene and protein expression of the NOS family. Hepatic (P = 0.4)
and skeletal muscle (P = 0.1) eNOS mRNA levels were not significantly altered by insulin treatment(Figure 5).In liver, nNOS mRNA
was undetectable; in skeletal muscle, nNOS gene expression was
unaffected by intensive insulin therapy (median, 0.81 [IQR, 0.32–
1.42] in the intensive insulin group versus 0.40 [IQR, 0.15–1.10] in
the conventional group; P = 0.2). In contrast, iNOS gene expression
was a median 66% lower in liver (P = 0.01) and a median 21% lower
in skeletal muscle (P = 0.04) of intensive insulin treated patients as
compared with conventionally treated patients(Figure 5).
Intensive insulin therapy did not affect eNOS protein levels in
liver (865 pg/mg [IQR, 778–1,096 pg/mg] protein in the intensive
insulin group versus 935 pg/mg [IQR, 786–1,060 pg/mg] protein
in the conventional group; P = 0.6) or skeletal muscle (144 pg/mg
[IQR, 93–180 pg/mg] protein in the intensive insulin group versus 127 pg/ml [IQR, 94–181 pg/mg] protein in the conventional
group; P = 0.7). Unfortunately, attempts to quantify iNOS protein
levels with either of 2 commercially available antibodies or by
ELISA were not successful, due to lack of specificity.
There was no correlation between any of the measured
cytokines and iNOS, eNOS, or nNOS gene expression. Also, CRP
levels measured on the last day of intensive care did not correlate
with NOS gene expression.
Intensive insulin therapy did not affect phosphorylated IκB
levels in skeletal muscle but tended to lower phosphorylated IκB
levels in liver (P = 0.1), which reflects a trend toward lower NF-κB
activation (Figure 5).
Serum NO levels. Compared with those in control subjects, NO
levels upon ICU admission were significantly increased in critically ill patients (P = 0.002), to a similar extent for the conventional and intensive insulin treatment groups (Figure 6). In the
conventional treatment group, NO levels remained equally high
on day 7 (P = 0.5; Figure 6). In contrast, a significant decrease
was seen for the patients in the intensive insulin therapy group
between admission and day 7 (P = 0.02), which resulted in significantly lower levels in these patients versus conventionally treated
patients (P = 0.04). This difference was due to a downward shift in
the levels of the 2 upper quartiles (Figure 6).
Univariate analysisrevealed that NO serum levels were higher in
nonsurvivors than in survivors (P < 0.0001). Elevated NO serum
levels were also associated with the risk for developing acute
renal failure (P < 0.0001; data not shown).
A highly significant but weak correlation
was found between day 7 NO quartiles and
ICAM-1 (ρ = 0.248; P < 0.0001); NO and
E-selectin (ρ = 0.192; P = 0.0001); and NO
and CRP (ρ = 0.192; P = 0.0001).
Relative impact of the studied effects of intensive 
insulin therapy on improved survival from critical illness. To weigh the impact of intensive
insulin therapy on the levels of CRP, VEGF,
adhesion molecules, cytokines, and NO on
the outcome benefit of the intervention
against blood glucose control, insulin dose,
and preexisting risk factors, we performed
multivariate logistic regression analysis
with ICU mortality as endpoint. Before NO
was entered into the model, the lowering of
serum ICAM-1 (odds ratio [OR], 1.104 per
100 ng/l added; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.017–1.199; P = 0.02) and E-selectin (OR, 1.050 per 5 ng/l
added; 95% CI, 1.008–1.093; P = 0.02) levels explained atleast part of
the reduced mortality with intensive insulin therapy, independent
of and corrected forseverity of illness(APACHE IIscore;ref. 15, age,
and the level of blood glucose control. Addition of NO to the model
rendered the predictive effect of ICAM-1 (OR, 1.083 per 100 ng/l
added; 95% CI, 0.996–1.178; P = 0.06) and E-selectin (OR, 1.041 per
5 ng/l added; 95% CI, 0.999–1.085; P = 0.05) levels only borderline
significant. Levels of NO in the 2 upper quartiles accounted forthis
association with adverse outcome (50–75% quartile: OR, 6.335, 95%
CI, 1.551–25.870, P = 0.01; 75–100% quartile: OR, 8.474, 95% CI,
2.001–35.891, P = 0.004). Similar results were obtained with multivariate logistic regression analysisfor developing acute renal failure
as outcome parameter (data not shown).
Discussion
As compared with conventional therapy, intensive insulin therapy
lowered circulating levels of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in patients
with prolonged critical illness, which reflected reduced activation
of the endothelium. Reduced endothelial activation with insulin

therapy was not brought about by an effect on endothelialstimuli,
such as VEGF or cytokines, nor by upregulation of eNOS, an unexpected observation. In contrast, prevention of hyperglycemia by
intensive insulin therapy suppressed iNOS gene expression and
lowered circulating NO levels. These effects on the endothelium
statistically explained a significant part of the improved patient
outcome with intensive insulin therapy.
Intensive insulin therapy reduced the circulating levels of the
adhesion moleculesICAM-1 and E-selectin in critically ill patients,
independent of its effect on infection prevention. E-selectin is produced selectively by endothelial cells and is rapidly inducible and,
as such, reflects the state of the endothelium in disease. ICAM-1
is constitutively expressed at very low levels on the endothelium
and is highly inducible upon cell activation. It is also expressed by
fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. Small changes in the expression of the adhesion molecules at the endothelial cell level may go
undetected in the circulation, but when differencesin the amount
ofshedded adhesion molecules are found, thisindicates a substantial change in activity status of the endothelium. The lowering of
ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels with intensive insulin therapy partially explained the reduced risk of developing organ failure and
of death with this intervention, as indicated by logistic regression
analysis. The data thus suggest that endothelial protection with
insulin therapy played a role in bringing about the prevention of
organ damage and improved survival. Several studies have previously underscored the importance of adhesion molecules and leukocyte-endothelium interactionsin determining patient outcome.
First, higher levels of circulating E-selectin and ICAM-1 are found
in critically ill patients as compared with healthy individuals (4,
16–20). Furthermore, E-selectin and ICAM-1 levels further rise
or remain persistently elevated in patients with multiple organ
dysfunction and in nonsurvivors as compared with survivors (16,
17, 19, 21). Especially ICAM-1 appeared to independently predict
subsequent development of multiple organ failure and/or death
(17, 19, 20). Second, E-selectin levels have been found to correlate
with hemodynamic instability (18, 22). Also, a correlation between
release of adhesion molecules into the circulation and severity of
trauma has been reported (4). Third, animal studies on interventions with monoclonal antibodies to adhesion molecules demonstrated that inhibition of neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells
significantly protects against reperfusion injury (23), acute lung
injury, and death (24).
A potent trigger of endothelial cell activation and expression of
adhesion molecules is VEGF. VEGF levels strongly increased with
time in patients with prolonged critical illness. In contrast to the
effect of glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus (25,
26) and of insulin infusion in fasting, obese, nondiabetic subjects
(27), intensive insulin therapy did not attenuate the critical illness–
induced rise in VEGF levels. This apparent discrepancy is likely
explained by the fact that critical illnessinduces more pronounced
insulin resistance than do type 2 diabetes and obesity. The rise of
VEGF in the critically ill is not surprising, considering it is a key
regulator of angiogenesis(28) involved in the repair oftissue injury
(29, 30). Moreover, VEGF expression is potentiated by hypoxia (29).
Strongly enhanced levels of VEGF have been previously reported
in critically ill patients with diverging underlying diseases(31–33).
Interestingly, administration of VEGF in experimental models of

trauma-induced injury beneficially affected outcome (34, 35). The
higher VEGF levels observed in the survivors versus nonsurvivors
in our study also point to an association between low VEGF levels
and adverse outcome. Since insulin therapy did not affect circulating VEGF levels, the impact on adhesion molecules was not mediated via an effect on this potent endothelial stimulus.
Also, a number of proinflammatory cytokinestrigger endothelial
cell activation (Figure 1), which in turn plays a role in the host
response to infection. It is thought that both inadequate control
of infection and an excessive release of cytokines into the systemic
circulation play a role in microvascular injury and multiple organ
failure (36). The cytokine profiles we documented in the patients
with prolonged critical illness revealed a concomitant pro- and
antiinflammatory response with an immediately high and further
increasing level of antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and brainderived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) and a massive and progressive furtherrise in the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines
(IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TNF-β, and RANTES). In
contrast, initially high circulating levels of the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) and
the main antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 decreased over time.
Serum levels of IL-5 and IL-8 were higher in nonsurvivors than in
survivors, whereas both too-low and too-high levels of IL-6 as well
as IL-10 were associated with a higher risk of organ failure and
death (37–39). This U-shaped relationship is in agreement with
the deleterious consequences of both the overwhelming proinflammatory response and the prolonged periods of immune suppression present in critical illness(reviewed in ref. 40). We expected
insulin therapy to lower proinflammatory cytokine levels in view
of its known antiinflammatory effect (12, 41). However, intensive
insulin therapy had only a mild effect on circulating cytokine levels, independent of its preventive effect on infection, and levels of
both the proinflammatory IL-6 and the antiinflammatory IL-10
were lowered by intensive insulin therapy. Furthermore, the suppression of adhesion molecules preceded an eventual lowering of
IL-6 and, according to the multivariate logistic regression analysis,
it appeared that none of the cytokines independently determined
the risk of death. Hence, it is unlikely that an effect of insulin on
cytokine release plays a major role in insulin’s protective effect on
the endothelium and organ function, although an influence on
local cytokine production cannot be excluded.
Although eNOS gene transcription and activity are known to be
upregulated by insulin (6, 42), intensive insulin therapy did not
alter eNOS gene expression or eNOS protein level in tissue of critically ill patients. This observation, at firstsight unexpected, can be
explained by insulin resistance in the critically ill. Insulin stimulates eNOS expression through activation of PI3K (43), and in a
rat model of critical illness (44) as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus

(45), insulin resistance appearsto be due to impaired signaling via
the insulin receptorsubstrate/PI3K pathway. Furthermore, Aljada
et al. demonstrated that TNF-α inhibits insulin-induced eNOS
expression (46). In the present study, the fact that TNF-α levels
were high and not affected by insulin therapy might explain the
lack of an insulin effect on eNOS expression. However, eNOS gene
expression was only measured in the sickest patients, as, for obvious ethicalreasons, tissue biopsies were only taken from nonsurvivors. Therefore, an effect on eNOS in survivors cannot be excluded.
Finally, since isolation of endothelial cells from the snap-frozen
liver and skeletal muscle biopsies was impossible, eNOS expression in hepatocytes and muscle cells may respond differently to
insulin therapy than that in endothelial cells, and both cell types
were present in the tissue biopsies.
iNOS, as opposed to eNOS, gene expression was lowered by
intensive insulin therapy in liver and skeletal muscle of nonsurviving critically ill patients. This was associated with lowered circulating levels of NO in a patient population of both survivors
and nonsurvivors, which suggests that the reduced expression of
iNOS with insulin therapy coincided with a reduced activity of the
enzyme. The exact source of iNOS expression and activity and of
the ensuing NO production is not clear from this study, as several
cell types present in the studied biopsies, including macrophages
(47), may contribute in this process. Since this suppression of NO
reflected a blunting of a dramatic increase of circulating levels of
NO in critically ill patients — i.e., intensive insulin therapy reduced
the levels in the 2 upper quartiles without affecting the 2 lower
quartiles — it likely explains the observed beneficial effects on the
endothelium. Indeed, NO explained a significant part of improved
survival in multivariate logistic regression analysis independent
of ICAM-1 and E-selectin. The observation that the contribution
of ICAM-1 and E-selectin remained borderline significant in the
model indicates that NO also mediates effects other than modulation of these adhesion molecules. Previous studies have reported
elevated serum NO levelsin critically ill patients(39, 48). High NO
levels are proinflammatory and may evoke organ damage in conditions of ischemia and reperfusion, whereaslow NO concentrations
exert antiadhesive and protective properties (9). Our observation
that preventing excessive NO release, via inhibition of excessive
iNOS induction without suppression of eNOS, is associated with
better outcome of critical illness is in line with previous reports
on the effects of NOS inhibitors. Indeed, treatment of septic animals with NOS inhibitors appeared promising and suggested that
such inhibitors might be of therapeutic value to improve outcome
(49–51). However, although in patients with septic shock, administration of a nonselective NOS inhibitor caused an increase in vascular tone and raised blood pressure (52), it also produced a fall in
cardiac output and increased mortality (52, 53). Hence, it may be
crucial to only prevent the excessive NO release mediated by iNOS
and not to negatively influence the protective effects of eNOS, as
was shown to occur with intensive insulin therapy in our study.
Proinflammatory cytokinessuch asIFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
also induce iNOS expression and lead to cytotoxic overproduction of
NO(reviewed in ref. 8). Since in ourstudy these cytokineswere either
unaffected by the intervention or their circulating levels were only
reduced following the lowering of ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels, it is
unlikely that the endothelial protection with insulin therapy could
be explained by an effect on cytokines.Adirect effect onNF-κB–driven iNOS induction ofinsulin or of hyperglycemia prevention is more
probable (54). When IκB is phosphorylated it loses the capacity to
inhibit nucleartranslocation of NF-κB (55), andwe indeed observed
a trend toward lower amounts of phosphorylated IκB in liver of the
patients in the intensive insulin therapy group but not in skeletal
muscle. The heterogeneity of the cell population in these tissues, in
which various cell types besides endothelial cells are present, may
explain why statistical significance was not reached. The resistance
to metabolic insulin signaltransduction in liver biopsies(56) and the
stronger effect of intensive insulin therapy on iNOS gene expression
in liver compared with muscle of critically ill patients suggest that
prevention of hyperglycemia isthe likely driving force reducing iNOS
activation and NO production, whereby endothelial protection may
ensue. It hasindeed been demonstrated that glucose has proinflammatory effects(57, 58). However,since glucose uptake in endothelial
cells is largely insulin independent, prevention of hyperglycemia
may also have protected the endothelium directly via prevention of
glucose overload (14, 59), part of which may be explained by prevention of oxidative stress (60–64). Nevertheless, our current clinical
data cannot entirely rule out more direct actions of insulin on the
endothelium, and furtherstudiesin our animal model of prolonged
critical illness(65) are required to differentiate between the impact of
glycemic control and that of nonglycemic effects of insulin.
In summary, maintaining normoglycemia with intensive insulin
therapy during critical illness protects the endothelium, directly
and/or via inhibition of excessive iNOS induction, and thereby
contributes to prevention of organ failure and death in ICU.
Methods
Patients. For analysis of serum markers, all 405 patients requiring at least
7 days of intensive care in the large (n = 1,548) randomized controlled trial
on the effects of intensive versus conventional insulin therapy (10) were
studied. Forthisstudy, blood wastaken on the admission day, day 5, day 7,
day 15, and the last day of intensive care. After centrifugation, serum was
kept frozen at –80°C until assay. For the study of gene expression and protein levels of iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS, postmortem biopsy samples of liver
(lowerright quadrant) and skeletal muscle (right musculusrectus abdominis) were taken from patients in the study who died in the ICU, within
minutes after death. Postmortem biopsy samples were available from 76
of 98 ICU nonsurvivors in the study. The tissue samples were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until analysis.
The detailed study protocol has been described elsewhere (10). In brief,
all adult mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU after major
surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients who had been
randomly assigned to conventional insulin therapy received insulin only
if glucose concentrations exceeded 215 mg/dl, with the aim of keeping concentrations between 180 and 200 mg/dl (hyperglycemia). Intensive insulin
therapy maintained blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dl (normoglycemia). The Institutional Review Board of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven had approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was
obtained from the closest family member.
For establishment of a reference range for NO levels, sera from 30
non–critically ill volunteers, matched for sex (P = 0.9), age (P = 0.7), height
(P > 0.9), and weight (P = 0.7), were also analyzed.
Circulating levels of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VEGF. Circulating levels of
ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VEGF were determined upon admission in a random sub-selection of 100 patients, 50 in each treatment group, and on day
7 in all 405 patients by a commercially available ELISA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems).
Circulating levels of CRP. Serum CRP levels were measured upon admission
and on day 5, day 15, and the last day of intensive care by an immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche/Hitachi Modular-P; Roche Diagnostics Corp.).

Circulating levels of cytokines. On the day of admission and day 5, day
15, and the last day of intensive care, serum concentrations of cytokines
(IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, TNF-β, RANTES,
BDNF, MCP1, and INF-γ) were quantified by a multiplexed microbead
suspension ELISA assay using the Luminex 100 system (Luminex Corp.)
after optimization and validation of the assay procedure. All incubations
were performed at room temperature on a microplate shaker (set at 500
rpm). For analysis of serum samples, serum and standard solutions were
diluted 1:10 in assay buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 1% BSA).
We prepared a filter plate (MultiScreen MABVN 1.2-µm 96-well; Millipore)
by pre-wetting it with assay buffer. To each well was subsequently added
50 µl extracted sample and a 50-µl suspension of capture Ab–conjugated
beads, 1,500 beads per analyte, in assay buffer containing 1% guinea pig/pig
serum (1:1). The capture antibodies were allowed to react with their corresponding antigens during 1 hour of incubation, and unbound material
was removed from the beads by filtering the content of the wells through
the filter bottom using a MultiScreen Vacuum Manifold (Millipore). The
beads were washed twice using 200 µl washing buffer (PBS containing
0.5% Tween) per well. The captured antigens were subsequently reacted
for 1 hour with a mixture (50 µl) of biotinylated detection antibodies each
diluted 1:600 in assay buffer. Fifty microliters of streptavidin-phycoerythrin 20 µg/ml assay buffer (Invitrogen Corp.) was added to the wells, and
the incubation continued for an additional 30 minutes. The beads were
finally washed twice with 200 µl washing buffer and resuspended in 100 µl
washing buffer. After 15 minutes ofshaking, the samples were analyzed on
the Luminex 100 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Expression of iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS mRNA in liver and skeletal muscle according to quantitative real-time PCR. Messenger RNA from 76 postmortem liver
and skeletal muscle biopsies wasisolated and quantified as described previously (56). After quality assessment oftheRNA (reported in ref. 56), 66 muscle samples and 59 liver samples were used. Total RNA (liver, 3 µg; muscle,
1 µg) wasreverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 µl underthe following
conditions: a 12-µl mixture containing the RNA, 0.1 µl random primers(3
µg/µl; Invitrogen Corp.) and 1 µl dNTPs (10 mM each; Invitrogen Corp.)
was heated to 65°C for 5 minutes. Following immediate cooling on ice,
an 8-µl mixture containing 4 µl ×5 first-strand buffer (Invitrogen Corp.),
2 µl dithiothreitol (100 nM; Invitrogen Corp.), and 1 µl RNase inhibitor
(RNaseOUT, 40 U/µl; Invitrogen Corp.) in H2O and 1 µl SuperScript II
Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/µl; Invitrogen Corp.) was added. The reverse
transcription was carried out by incubating the solution for 15 minutes at
25°C, 50 minutes at 40°C, and 15 minutes at 70°C before cooling it down
to 4°C. Samples were kept at –20°C until processing by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR. All liver samples and all muscle samples were reverse
transcribed simultaneously. Reactions lacking reverse transcriptase were
also run to generate controls for assessment of genomic DNA contamination. All primer pairs were designed to span an intron to exclude genomic
DNA amplification: eNOS (GenBank accession number NM_000603):
forward primer, 5′-GGCATCACCAGGAAGAAGACC-3′ (nt 1,758–1,778),
reverse primer, 5′-TCACTCGCTTCGCCATCA-3′ (nt 1,831-1,848), TaqMan
probe, 5′-CGTGAAGATCTCCGCCTCGCTCAT-3′ (nt 1,799–1,822); iNOS
(AF068236): forward primer, 5′-TGGATGCAACCCCATTGTC-3′ (nt 455–
473), reverse primer, 5′-TAATGGACCCCAGGCAAGATT-3′ (nt 572–592),
TaqMan probe, 5′-ACACACTTCACCATAAGGCCAAAGGGATTT-3′ (nt
572–556); and nNOS (NM_000620): forward primer 5′-CGAGCCATCGGCTTCAA-3′ (nt 2,879–2,895), reverse primer, 5′-GCTTGCGATTTGCCTGTCT-3′ (nt 2,985–3,003), TaqMan probe, 5′-CGACCATCCTCTATGC-3′
(nt 2,964–2,979). Externalstandardswere generated as described previously
(56). cDNA was quantified in real time with the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence
detector (Applied Biosystems). The 25-µl real-time reaction mixture contained 12.5 µl qPCR MasterMix (Eurogentec), 200 nM forward primer, 200
nM reverse primer, 200 nM TaqMan probe, 75 ng cDNA for quantification
of liver eNOS and iNOS, and 12.5 ng cDNA for quantification of muscle
eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS. Gene expression data were corrected for 18S
ribosomal RNA, quantified using the TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control
Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems). For 18S amplification, 75 pg liver and
125 pg muscle cDNA were used for each reaction. Unknown samples were
run in duplicate together with a series of 10-fold dilutions(from 108 copies
to 101 copies) of an external standard for generation of a standard curve.
The number of cyclesrequired for the standard ranged between 14 and 36.
Samples required on average 28, 33, and 32 cycles for eNOS, iNOS, and
nNOS, respectively. Individual samples with a copy number coefficient of
variation greater than 20% were reanalyzed. Every patient sample was analyzed in 2 separate runs. To normalize the data, each datapoint was divided
by the mean value obtained for the conventionally treated patient group.
iNOS and eNOS protein levels in liver and skeletal muscle. NOS protein levels
were evaluated in postmortem liver and muscle biopsies of 76 patients.
Tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml
leupeptin, 0.5 µg/ml pepstatin, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 34 µg/ml
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM
sodium fluoride, and 10 mM EDTA. The homogenates were centrifuged for
5 minutes at 9,500 g and 4°C. The protein content in the supernatant was
determined with Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology
Inc.) using a standard curve of BSA. Western blot analysis performed with
antibodiesraised against eNOS (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), iNOS (BD
Biosciences — Pharmingen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and nNOS
(Novus Biologicals Inc.) did not yield reliable results. Therefore, we turned
to a commercially available ELISA kit(R&D Systems)to quantify eNOS protein levels. Sixty microgramsliver or 500 µg skeletal muscle total protein per
100 µl were used in the eNOS assay, which was developed according to the
manufacturer’sinstructions. A similar assay for nNOSwas not available. The
commercial assay for iNOS, optimized for iNOS detection in cell lines, was
notsuitable for iNOS quantification in tissue homogenates.
Phosphorylated IκB protein levels in liver and skeletal muscle. Equal amounts
of homogenate proteins (100 µg) were separated by denaturing SDS gel
electrophoresis in 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen Corp.).
After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary Ab against
phosphorylated IκB (Ser32/36;Cell Signaling Technology) andwith a rabbit
anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (DakoCytomation) for 1 hour
before development using enhanced chemiluminescence technology (PerkinElmer). Blots were then analyzed using ImageMaster Software 1D Elite
(Amersham Biosciences). To normalize the data, each datapointwas divided
by the mean value obtained for the conventionally treated patient group.
Circulating levels of NO. NO levels were quantified by measurement of
serum nitrate plus nitrite levels using nitrate reductase and the colorimetric Griess reaction (66, 67). A 1:4 dilution in PBS of the serum samples
(200 µl) was ultrafiltered (6,000 g, 45 minutes, 4°C) through 10,000-kDa
molecular weight filters (Ultrafree-MC Biomax; Millipore). Fifty microliters each of the filtrates was analyzed in duplicate. A standard curve was
prepared ranging from 0 µM to 50 µM and was included in duplicate in
each assay. Nitrate in the standards and samples was converted to nitrite
by addition of 50 µl PBS with 600 U/l nitrate reductase from Aspergillus
(Roche Diagnostics Corp.) and 100 µM NADH (Sigma-Aldrich). Complete
conversion was achieved with an incubation time of 4 hours at room temperature, as evaluated by comparison of a converted nitrate standard curve
with a nitrite standard curve. Nitrite was then measured after addition of
50 µl PBS, 50 µl 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 50 µl 0.1%
N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride. The absorbance wasread
at 540 nm and corrected for absorbance at 650 nm.

Statistical analysis. The results obtained for different groups of patients
were compared by the χ2 testfor comparison of proportions, Student’sttest
for comparison of normally distributed data (presented as mean ± SD), and
the Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman test for data that were not normally distributed (presented as median and IQR, unless otherwise indicated).
Paired comparisons of non–normally distributed variables were performed
by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The significance of correlations between
parameters was assessed by calculation of the corresponding Pearson (r) or
Spearman (ρ) correlation coefficient.
The improvement of patient outcome due to the relative effects of
intensive insulin therapy on serum CRP, VEGF, ICAM-1, E-selectin, NO,
and cytokine levels was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The factors entered into the logistic regression model were (a) baseline
risk factors such as age, type, and severity of illness (APACHE II score)
(15), hyperglycemia upon admission, history of diabetes and malignancy;
(b) the level of blood glucose control and the dose of insulin; and (c) those
studied variables (CRP, VEGF, adhesion molecules, NO, and cytokine levels) that upon univariate analysis were significantly related to the studied
outcome measures. Variables entered into the model were always checked
for skewness. When they revealed a linear relation with the studied outcome measure, they were entered as continuous variables; otherwise a
nominal term was entered.
Two-tailed P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. StatView 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc.) for Macintosh
was used for these statistical analyses.
