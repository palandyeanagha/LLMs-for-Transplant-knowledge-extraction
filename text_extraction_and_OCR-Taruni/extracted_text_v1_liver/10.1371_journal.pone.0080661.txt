Abstract
The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used to stratify candidates for liver transplantation based on
objective measures of disease severity. MELD has been validated as a predictor of wait-list mortality in
transplantation candidates and has been postulated as a predictor of post-transplant survival. The purpose of this
study was to examine the predictive value of the pre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplant survival from
relevant existing studies. A systematic review and critical appraisal was performed using Cochrane guidelines.
PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for articles published in the English
language since 2005 using a structured search strategy. There were 3058 discrete citations identified and screened
for possible inclusion. Any study examining the relationship between pre-transplant MELD and post-transplant
survival in the general transplant population was included. Thirty-seven studies met these criteria and were included
in the review. Studies were all case series that typically involved stratified analyses of survival by MELD. They
represented 15 countries and a total of 53,691 patients. There was significant clinical heterogeneity in patient
populations across studies, which precluded performance of a meta-analysis. In 15 studies, no statistically significant
association between MELD and post-transplant survival was found. In the remaining 22, some association was
found. Eleven studies also measured predictive ability with c-statistics. Values were below 0.7 in all but two studies,
suggesting poor predictive value. In summary, while the majority of studies reported an association between pretransplantation MELD score and post-transplant survival, they represented a low level of evidence. Therefore, their
findings should be interpreted conservatively.

Introduction
The identification of patients who are most likely to benefit
from orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a significant
challenge in transplantation medicine. Liver transplantation
offers the only curative therapy for patients with end-stage liver
disease (ESLD). However, the supply of donor livers remains
inadequate to meet the demand, necessitating an effective
policy for organ allocation. In order to minimize waitlist
mortality, a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) - based
organ allocation was proposed. First adopted by the United
States in February 2002, it has become one of the most widely
used approaches to prioritizing liver transplant candidates in
countries around the world. The MELD score was initially
developed by Malinchoc et al [1] to predict mortality in patients
undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, but
has since been validated as predictor of short-term mortality in
patients awaiting transplantation. It uses objective variables
(creatinine, bilirubin and the international normalized ratio of
prothrombin time (PTINR)) to quantify the severity of ESLD,
enabling the prioritization of patients in need of liver
transplantation by medical urgency. An ideal system would
allocate organs to patients not only at the highest risk of dying
without transplantation, but also with the highest likelihood of
survival following transplantation.
In recent years, the possibility of using pre-transplant MELD
to predict post-transplant survival has been explored in many
opinion pieces and expert reviews[2]. However, it has yet to be
assessed through a systematic review and critical appraisal of
published studies that adheres to internationally accepted
systematic review guidelines. The need for such a review is
heightened by the lack and infeasibility of RCTs on this topic

and the fact that considerable debate over the value of MELD
in this context remains. Thus, the aim of this study was to
assess the association and predictive value of pretransplantation MELD score on post-transplantation patient
survival through a comprehensive, protocol driven systematic
review of studies published to date.
Methods
Identification of potentially relevant studies
To identify relevant studies published as of August 2011, a
structured search strategy combining relevant controlled
vocabulary terms such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
and additional non-indexed terms was first developed. Such
terms included Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, MELD, liver
transplantation, liver failure, and survival. The search strategy
was applied to the following electronic bibliographic databases:
PubMed (MEDLINE and non-MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library,
EMBASE, and Web of Science; and limited to full text, English
language studies of adult patients which were published within
the past 10 years. For completeness, reference lists of relevant
articles were scanned. Also, an internet search for unpublished
studies was performed with the Google® search engine. Full
search details are provided in Table A in File S1.
Selection of studies for inclusion in the review
Two researchers independently screened the titles and
abstracts of citations identified through the literature search
using predetermined inclusion criteria (Table 1). The initial
search strategy identified studies published in the last ten
years, whereas only studies published since 2005 were
included in the review.
Since the purpose of this study was to assess the predictive
ability of MELD in the general transplant patient population,
studies focussing on specific subgroups of patients were
excluded, along with those involving only unique transplant
conditions, such as multi-organ transplants, split livers, and
non-standard donors. However, studies that considered these
conditions within the context of the broader transplantation
population were included in the review. Corresponding papers
of citations deemed potentially relevant were then retrieved for
full review. The level of consensus among reviewers was
assessed using the Kappa Statistic. A score of 0.98 was
achieved, indicating excellent agreement. Discrepancies
among reviewers were resolved through discussion without the
need for third party adjudication.
Extraction of data from included studies
Information from included studies was systematically
extracted using a pre-tested data abstraction form. The
abstraction form contained elements related to study design,
patient population, comparators, outcomes measured, and
findings. All studies were reviewed by the primary author, with
a second reviewer extracting information on 50% of the
studies. Reviewers subsequently met to compare results. No
discrepancies were found. Therefore, a second, independent
review of the remaining studies was deemed unnecessary.
Critical appraisal of included studies
Studies were appraised using the Oxford Center for
Evidence-based Medicine Levels and Grades of
Recommendation[3].
Data analysis and synthesis of results
Extracted data were tabulated to facilitate a comparison of
findings across studies. A meta-analysis of pre-transplant
MELD on post-transplant survival using a random effects
model was also planned (see Results section). Prior to
presenting pooled or summary estimates, clinical heterogeneity
and statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic were
assessed.
Results
Results of the literature search are presented in the PRISMA
diagram (Figure 1). The search yielded 3058 discrete citations.
Forty-eight full-text articles were retrieved for full consideration,
of which 37 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review.
Among excluded studies, 6 involved inappropriate comparators
or outcomes, 4 did not present primary data, and 1 contained
data already captured in an included study. The list of excluded
studies, along with reasons for exclusion, is presented in Table
B in File S1.

Does MELD Predict Post-Transplant Survival?
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e80661

Description of included studies
The 37 studies comprised both prospective and retrospective
case series, and collectively included a total of 53,691 patients.
In most, the main objective was not to assess the relationship
between MELD and post-transplant survival. Instead, studies
examined a broad range of pre-transplant factors that may or
may not influence survival through exploratory analyses.
Studies originated from several countries, including: Belgium
(2), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3), Brazil (6), Spain
(5), the United States (7), Singapore (1), Turkey (1), China (1),
Korea (1), Switzerland (1), Poland (1), Italy (3), Canada (1),
and Germany (3). The majority were single centered. Sample
sizes ranged from 46 to 21,673 patients (mean = 1451, median
= 222), most of whom were male. None used a power
calculation to determine sample size. Sampling methods
comprised consecutive patients who met inclusion/exclusion
criteria, which differed considerably across studies. Therefore,
patients comprising the “general transplant population” may
have varied. The point at which MELD was measured in
patients was inconsistent across studies, with some using time
of placement on the transplant list and others using time of
transplant. In most of the studies, the relationship between
MELD and survival was examined through stratified analyses
of survival across sub-groups defined by MELD score, where
MELD cut-off points for sub-groups were determined post-hoc.
Further, the majority(25) measured the association between
MELD and survival based on univariate analyses alone, and,
therefore, did not control for potential confounders. Eleven of
the studies assessed the predictive ability of the MELD score
on post-transplantation survival using a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and the c-statistic. In 4 of the
studies, there was partial overlap of patient populations since
they included data from the Transplant Scientific Registry
(Cywinski et al [4], Freeman et al [5], Rana et al [6] and Yoo &
Thuluvath [7]). All of these studies were kept in the review as
each used different MELD categories and follow-up times in
their analysis. A detailed summary of each study is presented
in Table C in File S1.
As mentioned above, the majority of studies grouped
patients by MELD. Specifically, MELD, which represents a
continuous variable, was converted to a categorical variable for
the analyses. The cut-off points for such categories varied
widely across studies and were typically determined post-hoc.
(Refer to relevant outcome measures in Table C in File S1).
Effect measures also differed, ranging from proportions to
hazards ratios, odds ratios, and relative risks, and follow-up
time periods were inconsistent. Lastly, characteristics of the
“general transplant population” varied. Therefore, given such
clinical heterogeneity across studies, a meta-analysis was
deemed inappropriate, and a statistical assessment of
heterogeneity was not performed.
Quality of included studies
Based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine
Levels of Evidence, the quality of all of the included studies
was level IV. The studies, which involved a comparison of preFigure 1. Literature search results and study selection for clinical review.

transplant MELD scores with post-transplant survival, were all
case series and predominantly retrospective in design. All
studies recruited consecutive patients over a specified time
period, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias.
Association between Pre-Transplant MELD Score and
Post-Transplantation Survival
Of the 37 studies, 15 found no association between pretransplant MELD score and post-transplant patient survival,
while 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. A detailed
description of the results of each study is presented in Table C
in File S1. Based on qualitative analyses, there were no clear
differences in studies with statistically significant findings
compared to those with no statistically significant findings. In
both groups, sample sizes varied, as did follow-up times.
However, findings from the two largest studies (N >15,000)
both suggested that survival decreased with increasing MELD.
One observed this relationship only when patients with MELD
scores under 9 were compared to those with scores of 30 or
greater, while the other had treated MELD as a continuous
variable. At the same time, of the 7 other studies that analysed
MELD as a continuous variable, all but one found no
statistically significant association between MELD and survival.
In most of the studies, information presented on patient
characteristics was limited. Therefore, it was not possible to
identify any differences in patient populations that could explain
inconsistencies in the findings.
Predictive ability of MELD score for posttransplantation survival
Eleven studies presented a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve to determine the predictive ability of pre-transplant
MELD score to determine post-transplantation survival. The
area under the curve is used to produce a concordance value
called the c-statistic. A c-statistic of 0.50 indicates no predictive
ability, and is expected if the results are due to chance alone.
In contrast, a c-statistic of 1 represents perfect discrimination.
Values under 0.7 suggest poor predictive power, while those
greater than 0.70 indicate a useful test, and those higher than
0.80 imply excellent predictive accuracy[2]. Among the 11
studies, 10 reported c-statistics less than <0.7, indicating that
MELD poorly predicted post-transplant survival. This included
the largest study contributing to the review[6]. In 1 study, the cstatistic decreased over time, from 0.711 for 3-month posttransplant survival to 0.679 for 12-month survival[8]. In the
single study with a high c-statistic[9], there was no clear
difference in sample size, follow-up time, or patient population
when compared to the studies with lower values.
Discussion
This review assessed the association and predictive ability of
pre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation
survival in adults with end-stage liver disease. It highlighted
discrepancies in findings across studies. Such discrepancies
may be related to the nature of the studies, The vast majority
were retrospective case series that relied upon exploratory
stratified analyses of data to detect a relationship between
MELD and post-transplant survival. As such, analytical
techniques, rather than study design, were used to control for
confounding. In addition, most of the studies were single
centered, with each site having its own process for prioritizing
patients for transplant. Therefore, patients constituting the
general transplant population may have varied across studies.
Thus, while using pre-transplant MELD to predict posttransplant survival in transplant candidates may be attractive,
there is little evidence to support it. Prospective studies
designed specifically to examine this relationship are needed.
MELD score does appear to have a greater impact on mortality
when observed in combination with other known risk factors for
post-transplant mortality, including sub-optimal livers, low graftto-body ratio and presence of Hepatitis C. Further research in
the area of particular patient subgroups (such as those with
hepatitis C) may show a stronger association between MELD
and post-transplant outcome.
Based on the studies conducted to date, which collectively
represent a low level of evidence, MELD could be correlated
with survival, but appears to have limited predictive ability. The
vast majority of studies presenting concordance statistics found
that pre-transplant MELD score offered minimal discriminating
power for post-transplantation survival. However, the c-statistic
may be of limited value in determining the predictive ability[10].
This is because the c-statistic is intended for diagnostic
models, rather than prognostic models. The two types differ in
that prognostic models add the element of time. Specifically,
diagnostic models are designed to determine the current state
of the patient and accurately identify an existing disease state.
In contrast, prognostic models are designed to estimate the
probability of a future state where the outcome is not yet known
and subject to chance.
This review is limited by heterogeneity in key parameters of
studies used to date, which precluded performance of a metaanalysis. Studies reported different comparators (in terms of
MELD categories) and applied time-points for outcomes.
Studies comparing standardized MELD categories would be
beneficial in determining whether or not there is, in fact, a
threshold level at which liver transplantation does not offer
sufficient survival to warrant the use of scarce donor livers. A
more accurate assessment of post-transplant survival would
also need to look at other factors, such as quality of life.
Research examining the combinations of patient factors using
more appropriate statistical techniques may also be valuable in
improving the predictive ability of pre-transplant elements on
post-transplant outcome.
Conclusions
This study provides a comprehensive review of recent
articles examining the relationship between pre-operative
MELDS score and post-transplantation survival. Based on the
results of studies conducted to date, it appears that the use of
MELD does not serve as a reliable predictor of posttransplantation survival. This may be a reflection of a reliance
on less than ideal analytical measures. However, the use of
pre-transplant characteristics may always fall short of ensuring
optimal organ allocation due to variability in immeasurable
