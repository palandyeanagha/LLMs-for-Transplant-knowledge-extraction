Who did ever think that the twenty-frst century with the 
best of scientifc innovations and health care system would 
witness a historic pandemic of a novel Corona virus, SARSCoV-2, which is crumbling humanity globally. Each day we 
are confronted with rising statistics and at the time of this 
writing, the global watch has registered more than 1249107 
confrmed cases of Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. On 
a positive side, 256,059 (20%) have fully recovered and on 
a darker side 67,999 (5.4%) precious lives have been lost 
according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus 
Resource Center until April 5 [1]. Much of the scientifc 
data have come from China and together with the emerging 
data from the West where old age has been unequivocally 
identifed as the major risk factor with increased mortality 
due to COVID-19.
The origin of the novel coronavirus can be traced to 
Hubei Province, in China, which frst reported to WHO, on 
Dec 30, 2019, several cases of pneumonia with an unknown 
infectious agent. The bronchoalveolar lavage collected from 
patient in Wuhan hospital tested positive for pan-betacoronavirus by real-time PCR. The Chinese agencies were quick in 
getting the full-length genomic sequence of the virus which 
had about 80% similarity to bat SARS-like coronavirus 
strain BatCov RaTG13. On 7 Jan 2020, the novel human 
coronavirus was frst named as 2019-nCoV(human) and later 
it was renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On February 11, 2020, the WHO 
announced the outbreak of coronavirus-associated disease 
and in a short span of 2 months, the virus spread globally 
and on 11 March, WHO declared it a pandemic [2].
While COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, 
subjects with underlying chronic disease such as diabetes 
and cardiovascular disorders are at higher risk of getting 
severe disease which can be lethal as well [3]. The published 
reports have not underscored the importance of liver disorder as a major risk factor; however, few papers have indicated “2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities” and these mostly included patients with severe case 
of COVID-19 [4]. However, a common clinical fnding in 
COVID-19 is raised levels of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and reduced albumin level indicating liver injury. The 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a key receptor for the 
SARS-CoV-2 viral entry which is also expressed by cholangiocytes in liver and enterocytes in intestine (besides the 
type II lung epithelial cells). This indicates the possibility 
of extrapulmonary sites as reservoir for viral replication. 
In support of this, a recent study has shown that half of the 
SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects who have completely cleared 
the infection from the respiratory tract show virus shedding 
in their fecal samples up to 11 days after respiratory samples became negative [5]. This raises a serious concern of 
fecal–oral route of transmission, which in turn poses risk of 
pathogen transfer through FMT procedure [6]. Asia, in particular China, has high incidence of HBV; however, data are 
scant with respect to its infuence on COVID-19. One report 
suggests that about 2.0% of severe cases had HBV infection compared to those with mild disease (0.06%) [7]. With 
respect to COVID-19, the other vulnerable groups with liver 
disease include patients who have undergone liver transplant 
and currently on immunosuppressants, liver cirrhosis/ACLF 
with immune dysfunction and those with hepatocellular carcinoma with immune exhaustion status. Patients with NASH 
have associated comorbidities of diabetes and cardiovascular 
disorder and they too are at high risk of being infected and 
may progress to severe form of COVID-19.
As for the liver pathology in COVID-19, one report indicates mild steatosis which is mostly attributable to druginduced liver injury rather than the virus [8]. With liver 
being a major organ for drug detoxifcation, the current proposed treatments with hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, and 
antiviral drugs may further aggravate liver injury. Thus, a

causal relation between underlying liver disease, efect of 
hepatotoxic drugs, and COVID-19 will await further investigations. Several liver societies have come up with management guidance for COVID-19 developing in liver disease 
patients, including one on liver transplant and COVID-19 
from Liver Transplant Society of India (online in Hepatology International) and the EASL management plan care of 
COVID-19 patients with liver disease [9] Tobias Boettler, 
J Hep Reports).
The patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 
and those who are asymptomatic but show viral shedding in 
feces pose a new challenge to hepatologists and gastroenterologists in the coming days. Will there be a second outbreak, 
reactivation, and new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection via 
a fecal–oral route? The need of the hour is to initiate wellplanned clinical studies in symptomatic and also recovered 
patients to generate more scientifc evidences about not only 
the course of the disease but also to develop efective clinical 
management strategies.
COVID-19 has brought in a sea of change in all sectors 
of life especially the clinical and scientifc world. There is 
fast pace of clinical and scientifc research, with fast-breaking published reports and those on preprint servers even 
under lockdown. We commend the heroic clinical trials 
which could be designed even under immense COVID-19 
pressure. The brave new world in era of Covid-19 has seen 
emergence of heroic breed of clinicians, nurses, scientifc, 
technical, governance staf, and community workers a.k.a 
“Covidwarriors” fghting and chasing the rogue virus. Dr. 
Gayatri Ramakrishna and her team have prepared a snapshot of COVID-19, by collecting the latest information on 
COVID-19 infection and have presented it in a lucid, poetic 
manner. It is hoped that this virus scan will fnd a place on 
your desk or wall for ready reference. We invite rapid contributions from colleagues across the globe to use Hepatology 
International for educating the world and help in overcoming 
the devastating crisis.
The global pandemic has to be fought locally by collective 
sharing and open access of scientifc data and technology 
at a global level. Every small step taken for preventing the 
spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a big leap for protecting mankind. 
We at Hepatology International are dedicated towards the 
cause of fghting the virus and preventing COVID-19.
Science and Humanity will surely win this battle too!
