INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequently 
developed primary malignant tumor of the liver and the sixth 
most common cancer of all malignancies [1]. It is endemic in 
Asia and Africa, and its incidence is also increasing in Western 
countries [2,3]. Liver transplantation is theoretically the 
best treatment option for early HCCs with the Milan criteria 
because both the tumors and the underlying liver disease 
are simultaneously treated; however, the application of this 
Purpose: Although there are several prospective clinical studies comparing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic 
resection (HR) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, there are few trials that have been performed in strictly 
homogeneous patients.
Methods: Patients who were newly diagnosed with a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized to the HR or RFA 
group. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 20 years but ≤ 70 years, Child-Pugh class A, maximal diameter of the 
tumor ≥ 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no previous treatment history, and platelet count > 80,000/mm3
.
Results: Although the study was early terminated, 29 and 34 patients were enrolled in the HR and RFA groups, respectively, 
and prospectively followed on an intention-to-treat basis. The 5-year overall survival rates were 83.4% and 86.2% in the HR 
and RFA groups, respectively, which were not significantly different (P = 0.812 by log-rank, P = 0.990 by Breslow). The 3- 
and 5-year disease-free survival rates in the HR group were significantly superior to those in the RFA group (66.7%, 44.4% 
vs. 44.1%, 31.2%, P = 0.071 by log-rank, P = 0.023 by Breslow). Intrahepatic local recurrence tended to develop more frequently in the RFA group (P = 0.042), while the frequency of intrahepatic distant and extrahepatic recurrence was similar 
between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency and severity of complications between the 2 
groups. 
Conclusion: HR was significantly superior to RFA in terms of disease-free survival; however, the overall survival was 
excellent in both groups.

attractive treatment is mostly limited by a serious donor organ 
shortage. Hence, hepatic resection (HR) is still considered to be 
a useful and effective first treatment option [4,5], although it 
is only suitable for less than 30% of all HCC patients [6,7]. The 
underlying cirrhosis and decompensated liver function that 
frequently accompany HCC are major obstacles to HR in many 
patients. In addition, the recurrence of tumors within the liver 
remnant is common, even after curative HR.
Today, small HCCs can be easily detected due to the wide use 
of screening tests. Local ablative therapies are safe and effective 
for treating small HCCs, and of these therapies, radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) is considered the most effective one [5,8]. RFA 
provides encouraging results in treating small HCCs, with less 
invasiveness, shorter hospitalization, and lower expense [5]. In 
some cohort studies, the tumor control by RFA was shown to 
be excellent. The complete tumor ablation rate of RFA was more 
than 90%, and the local recurrence rate was less than 10% [9-12]. 
In addition, the 3-year survival rate was as good as 62% to 68% 
[9,12]. On the other hand, the results of HR have been recently 
improved by experienced surgeons. The treatment-related 
mortality of HR was only less than 2%, and the 5-year survival 
after HR for HCC was 40 to 70% [5]. Therefore, it is unclear 
which modality is superior for treating small HCCs.
There are some recent reports comparing RFA and HR for 
treating small HCCs. Chen et al. [7] claimed that percutaneous 
local ablative therapy might be as effective as surgical resection 
in the treatment of solitary and small HCCs. Four year later, 
however, Huang et al. [5] showed that surgical resection 
provided better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for 
patients with HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. Although 
both these studies were prospective randomized trials, they 
drew quite opposite conclusions. This may be because patients 
enrolled in these studies were too heterogeneous to allow 
a direct comparison between these 2 treatment modalities. 
Therefore, to compare the efficacy and safety of RFA and HR, 
we performed a prospective randomized study in HCC patients 
with very homogeneous underlying conditions.
METHODS
Diagnostic criteria and inclusion and exclusion 
criteria
Among the patients who were newly diagnosed with a 
solitary HCC, those who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were enrolled in this clinical study. The diagnosis of HCC was 
made clinically based on the presence of risk factors, serum 
α-FP level, and typical imaging appearance on dynamic imaging 
studies, including CT, MRI, or hepatic artery angiography. 
Patients were diagnosed with HCC when they met the following 
criteria: (1) patients with risk factors for HCC, such as HBV, HCV, 
or cirrhosis; (2) serum α-FP ≥ 400 ng/mL + typical appearance 
on one dynamic imaging study or serum α-FP < 400 ng/mL + 
typical appearance on 2 dynamic imaging studies. 
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 20 and 
70 years, (2) Child-Pugh class A (score 5-6), (3) single HCC, (4) 
maximal diameter of the tumor from 2 to 4 cm when measured 
on MRI or CT (The diameter on MRI was measured prior to that 
on CT), (5) no previous treatment, (6) platelet count > 80,000/
mm3.
Patients with HCC expected to be poorly controlled by RFA, 
as described below, were excluded: (1) HCC abutting main 
hepatic veins or the first branches of the main portal vein, (2) 
HCC abutting vessels ≥ 0.5 cm.
Study design
The purpose of this study was to test the null hypothesis 
that the effect of RFA was not different from that of HR for the 
treatment of small HCCs. The patient’s death was the primary 
end point. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to compare 
the 5-year overall survival between the 2 treatment groups. In 
addition, HCC recurrence was considered as the secondary end 
point. The 5-year disease-free survival in the two groups was 
also investigated. Based on the Clavien-Dindo classification 
system for grading complications [13], the frequency and 
severity of adverse events after primary treatment were compared. Because of the nature of the interventions, the doubleblind technique was not used. This clinical study was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of each center participating in this 
study. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (https://
clinicaltrials.gov, Registration number: NCT02482909).
Sample size
A 5-year overall survival rate after treatment was used as the 
outcome measurement to estimate the sample size. According 
to the previous data [14,15], the 5-year overall survival rate was 
expected to be 60% for HR and 40% for RFA. By the Freedman 
Equation, a sample size of at least 217 patients was calculated 
to be needed to detect a difference at a 5% type-I error and 80% 
power for a 2-tailed test with 10% of patients estimated to be 
lost to follow-up.
Enrollment and assignment
Two hospitals participated in this clinical study: Seoul 
National University Hospital and the National Cancer Center. 
All patients diagnosed with a single HCC were eligible 
for enrollment. Once a patient met the inclusion criteria, 
information about this study was provided by the physician to 
the patient. Written informed consent was obtained before the 
patient was recruited into the study. Patients were recruited 
and assigned to 2 groups (the RFA and HR groups) by a stratified

randomization method beforehand, which was developed by 
the Medical Research Collaborating Center (MRCC) of Seoul 
National University Hospital. The registry number for patients 
was printed on envelopes in order, and the corresponding 
group name was mentioned in each sealed envelope. Research 
nurses opened the envelope for each patient in the registry 
sequence after informed consent was obtained. Patients were 
then informed about the specific intervention. Patients could 
freely withdraw consent after they were informed about the 
assigned treatment modality and even after the treatment was 
performed.
Radiofrequency ablation
Patients assigned to the RFA group were treated by using a 
commercially available radiofrequency generator (Radionics, 
Burlington, MA, USA) and a single needle electrode (Cool-tip) 
(tumor <3 cm) or a clustered electrode composed of 2 needles 
(tumor ≥3 cm), ground pads, a pump for internal cooling, and 
ultrasound equipment. The percutaneous RFA procedure was 
performed as follows: Grounding was achieved by attaching 2 
pads to the patient’s thighs. The electrode was inserted into the 
tumor under ultrasound or CT guidance after local anesthesia 
was given. When the electrode was in position, the system was 
switched to the impedance mode. After measurement of the 
baseline impedance, generator output power was gradually 
increased with a pump infusing cold saline into the electrode 
lumen to cool the tip temperature. The target area was heated 
to 90°C–100°C and maintained at that level for 10–30 minutes. 
When the HCC was located on the surface and close to adjacent 
organs, such as the duodenum, colon, or diaphragm, saline 
was injected between the liver and the adjacent organs before 
ablation to prevent thermal injuries. During the treatment, a 
hyperechoic, necrotic area was observed around the electrode 
tip on ultrasonic monitoring. The aim of the treatment was 
to have this necrotic area covering a larger area than the 
tumor. The total ablation area was required to be 0.5–1 cm 
over the tumor edge. Occasionally, it was necessary to insert 
the electrode at different sites, and ablation was performed 
repeatedly to achieve a satisfactory ablation area. An enhanced 
CT was performed 24 hours after treatment. When any possible 
undestroyed lesions remained, the RFA was repeated. If there 
were no serious complications, patients with satisfactory 
ablation were discharged 24–48 hours after treatment.
Hepatic resection
Surgical resection was carried out under general anesthesia. 
Systematic anatomical resection (segmentectomy, sectionectomy, or hemihepatectomy) was performed after intraoperative 
ultrasound examination. Intraoperative ultrasonography was 
routinely performed to estimate the location and feeding 
vessels of the tumor, as well as to give an accurate vascular 
map of the liver anatomy. The Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator 
(CUSA, Valleylab Corp., Boulder, CO, USA) was used to dissect 
the hepatic parenchyma. Pringle's maneuver was occasionally 
used with a clamp/unclamp time of 15 minutes/5 minutes to 
control the bleeding during hepatic dissection. Hemostasis was 
achieved by using a bipolar electric coagulator, argon beam 
coagulator, titanium clips, tie or suturing, and some commercially manufactured hemostats. Patients remained hospitalized 
until liver functions approached normal and serious complications had resolved.
Follow-up 
Basic patient information was collected after enrollment, 
including age, sex, past medical history, physical examination, 
vital signs, the results of radiological and laboratory tests, and 
Child-Pugh score. All posttreatment complications were also 
investigated. Patients were required to visit the outpatient 
clinic 1 month after treatment and then every 3 months for 24 
months. They were followed up every 4 months after 2-year 
posttreatment. Additional visits were allowed when there were 
certain problems. At every visit, serum α-FP, PIVKA-II, complete 
blood cell count, liver function test, prothrombin time, and 
CT or MRI were performed, and the results were recorded. 
Although MRI was usually performed as an alternative imaging 
tool when CT was intolerable because of contrast media-related 
hypersensitivity, it was also used as an additional workup when 
intrahepatic recurrence was difficult to ascertain. The end of 
follow-up was originally designed for up to 5 years after treatment; however, additional follow-up was made to evaluate longterm outcomes only through the patients’ medical records after 
getting the approval of the Institutional Review Board.
Recurrence and subsequent treatment
When recurrence was suspected, an individualized additional 
workup, such as a chest/brain CT, bone scintigraphy, or 
positron emission tomography, was performed. All confirmed 
recurrences were classified into three categories: intrahepatic 
local recurrence, intrahepatic distant recurrence, and extrahepatic recurrence. Intrahepatic local recurrence was defined as 
a recurrence that developed within 2 cm of the primary treatment margin.
Once recurrence was confirmed, the subsequent treatment 
plan was proposed based on the decision of a multidisciplinary 
team of doctors, including surgeons, internists, and radiologists. 
HR, RFA, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT), 
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, or transplantation was selected as the subsequent 
treatment.
Statistical analysis
Case report forms were delivered to the MRCC of Seoul 

 Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research 77
National University Hospital after every visit. Data collection 
and statistical analysis, as well as patient assignment, were 
independently performed by the MRCC.
In principle, comparison of the 2 treatment groups was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, i.e., according to the 
initially assigned treatment methods; however, 2 additional 
analysis methods were also used. One method was per-protocol 
(PP) analysis, and the other method was per-treatment (PT) 
analysis. Cases with protocol violations were excluded from the 
PP analysis, and patients were regrouped according to the actual 
treatment methods instead of the initially assigned methods 
for the PT analysis.
Differences in demographic and medical data between the 2 
groups were analyzed by Student t-test for continuous variables 
and by the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical 
variables. Overall survival curves and recurrence-free survival 
curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank and Breslow tests. All statistical tests were 
2-sided, and the null hypothesis was rejected when P < 0.05. 
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 12.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
RESULTS
Patient groups
The recruitment of participants was discontinued in September 2009. The study could be biased due to prolonged 
study duration. In addition, the posttreatment recurrence was 
expected to be higher in the RFA groups. Thus, the study was 
early terminated even though the sample size had not achieved 
the calculated goal. Between July 2005 and September 2009, 68 
patients met the criteria and were randomly assigned to each 
group. Five patients in the HR group withdrew their consent 
after randomization and were excluded from the study. Thus, 
29 and 34 patients in the HR and RFA groups, respectively, were 
included in the ITT analysis (Fig. 1). The pretreatment data of 
the patients are presented in Table 1. All variables were similar 
between the 2 groups. Median follow-up duration in all patients 
was 1,948 days (range, 28–2,807 days).
A total of 8 patients had protocol violations after randomization. There were 3 protocol violations in the HR group. Two 
patients requested a change in the treatment modality to RFA 
and actually underwent RFA as per their desire. One patient 
withdrew his consent after treatment. In the RFA group, 5 
patients had protocol violations. Treatment modality was 
actually changed to HR in 4 patients, and a criteria violation was 
detected in 1 patient. Therefore, PP analysis was performed in 
the 26 and 29 patients in the HR and RFA groups, respectively, 
who followed the study protocol without violations (Fig. 1).
After randomization, 31 patients actually received HR for 
HCC. Twenty-seven patients were originally randomized to HR, 
and 4 patients changed their treatment modality from RFA to 
HR. In the same manner, there were 32 patients who actually 
received RFA. Thirty patients were primarily assigned to RFA, 
and 2 patients selected RFA over HR. PT analysis was performed 
according to the actual treatment methods (Fig. 1). 
Overall and disease-free survival
During the follow-up, 12 patients died: 5 patients in the 
HR group and 7 patients in the RFA group. The 3- and 5-year 
overall survival rates were 96.6% and 83.4%, respectively, in the 
HR group and 97.1% and 86.2%, respectively, in the RFA group 
(Fig. 2), which was not a statistically significant difference (P 
= 0.812 by log-rank test, P = 0.990 by Breslow test). In the HR 
group, one patient died of serious pulmonary complication 
on postoperative day 28, and the other patients died of progressive hepatic insufficiency during the management of HCC 
recurrence. In the RFA group, 2 deaths occurred due to intracranial or intestinal lymphoma, and 5 deaths were directly

related to HCC. Also in the PP and PT analysis, the 3- and 5-year 
overall survival rates were not different between the 2 groups. 
On the PP basis, the 3- and 5-year survival rates were 96.2% 
and 85.6%, and 100% and 87.7%, respectively (P = 0.862 by 
log-rank teat, P = 0.933 by Breslow test). On the PT basis, the 
3- and 5-year survival rates were 96.8% and 83.3%, and 96.9% 
and 85.9%, respectively (P = 0.903 by log-rank test, P = 0.990

HCC recurrence developed in 39 patients during follow-up: 
in 15 and 24 patients in the HR and RFA groups, respectively 
(51.7% vs. 70.6%). On the ITT basis, the disease-free survival 
in the HR group was significantly superior to that in the RFA 
group. The disease-free survival rate was 66.7% at 3 years and 
44.4% at 5 years after treatment in the HR group, while it was 
44.1% at 3 years and 31.2% at 5 years in the RFA group (P = 
0.071 by log-rank test, P = 0.023 by Breslow test) (Fig. 3). Also 
in the PP analysis, the 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates 
were superior in the HR group (62.5% and 37.4% vs. 41.4% and

and 30.3% in the RFA group, respectively. Therefore, HR was 
superior to RFA in terms of disease-free survival, even in the PT 
analysis (P = 0.044 by log-rank test, P = 0.027 by Breslow test).
Recurrence pattern and risk factors of HCC 
recurrence
Intrahepatic local recurrence was more frequent in the RFA 
group. On the other hand, the frequency of intrahepatic distant 
recurrence and extrahepatic recurrence was similar between 
the 2 groups (Table 2). A total of 149 subsequent treatments 
were performed in 39 patients with HCC recurrence during the 
follow-up period (Table 3). The subsequent treatments were 
more frequently performed in the RFA group (103 treatments in 
24 patients) than in the HR group (46 treatments in 15 patients). 
The most common subsequent treatment was TACE, not only in 
the HR group (65.2%), but also but also in the RFA group (74.8%), 
followed by RFA.
In the multivariate analysis, only the platelet count was 
associated with recurrence. The platelet count was significantly 
lower in patients with recurrence, although its effect was minimal (hazard ratio, 0.972; P = 0.001). RFA was also associated 
with a high risk of HCC recurrence; however, it was not 
statistically significant (Table 4).
Complications after treatment
A total of 28 complications developed in 20 patients (31.7%) 
after primary treatment: 11 patients in the HR group and 9 
patients in the RFA group (37.9% vs. 26.5%, P = 0.330). There was 
no significant difference in the number of patients with complications between the 2 groups. The most common complications 
were pleural effusion in the HR group (24.1%) and pain in the 
RFA group (8.8%). According to the Clavien-Dindo classification 
system, all complications except for one were grade I. Only 
one grade IV complication developed in the HR group, which 
was postoperative death. Therefore, there was no statistically 
significant difference in the severity of complications between 
the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION
Surgical HR is still considered the first treatment option with 
curative intent in patients with resectable HCCs [7]. Recent 
developments in surgical skills and accumulated experiences 
in perioperative management have improved the results of HR 
[7]. The postoperative mortality after HR is approaching 0% in 
noncirrhotic patients, and it is less than 5% even in cirrhotic 
patients [7,16]. Recent advances in RFA, however, have brought 
its results close to those of HR. Because nonrandomized and 
randomized comparative studies have shown that outcomes 
of RFA were similar to those of HR [14,15,17], the necessity of 
a prospective, randomized study comparing the efficacy of 
RFA and HR in patients with resectable small HCCs has been 
suggested [8].

tive therapy and partial hepatectomy for HCC was performed 
by Chen et al. [7]. In their study, the 4-year overall survival rate 
was 65.9% for the local ablative therapy group and 64.0% for 
the surgical resection group. The 4-year disease-free survival 
rates for the 2 groups were 48.2 and 51.6%, respectively, and 
they were not significantly different. These results are not 
identical to those of the present study. The most remarkable 
difference is the disease-free survival rate in the local ablative 
therapy group. On the ITT basis, the 3- and 5-year disease-free 
survival rates in the RFA group were only 44.1% and 31.2% in 
the present study, whereas they were much higher in the earlier 
study. With respect to the recurrence pattern, intrahepatic 
local recurrence was remarkably more frequent in the RFA 
group compared to the HR group (Table 3). Therefore, the low 
recurrence rates in their study might be due to effective local 
control of the tumor, possibly by addition of PEIT or TACE to 
RFA. Hence, their study does not directly compare RFA to HR 
as a single treatment modality. In addition, the overall survival 
rates in the resection group were lower in their study compared 
to the present study. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates in 
the HR group were 96.6% and 83.4% in the present study, while 
the 4-year overall survival rate was only 64.0% in their study. 
This low survival was likely to be due to hepatic insufficiency 
and HCC recurrence. Although only patients with good liver 
function belonging to Child-Pugh class A were enrolled in their 
study, patients with a low platelet count (reduced up to 40,000/
mm3
) or high indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes 
(ICG-R15) (up to 30%) were allowed to participate in the study. 
Some patients with moderate to severe portal hypertension 
and cirrhosis, which are the well-known prognostic factors of 
HCC, might have been enrolled in their study and could be 
responsible for the low overall survival rate. This may be due to 
a high complication rate after HR in their study.
In the present study, the overall survival rate was not different between the 2 treatment groups. Although the diseasefree survival was superior in the HR group, patient survival was 
not improved. This might be due to the excellent liver function 
and effective subsequent treatments. It is well known that 
the prognosis of HCC depends not only on tumor staging but 
also on liver function. In addition, various salvage or palliative 
treatment modalities have been developed for treating HCC. 
Therefore, the survival expectancy can be more than 3-5 
years, even after HCC recurrence with good liver function and 
effective subsequent treatments. As only those patients with 
small HCC and excellent liver function were enrolled in the 
present study, the difference in overall survival was not noticeable during follow-up. 
Early recurrence, however, leads to more salvage treatments 
and hospitalization. In the present study, the most frequent 
subsequent treatment after recurrence was TACE, which was 
performed repeatedly in many cases. Because recurrence 
developed earlier in the RFA group, more salvage treatments 
and hospitalization were required during follow-up, in spite of 
similar survival. In addition, it is questionable that the earlier 
and more frequent recurrences do not have any effect on the 
final outcomes. Recent prospective studies and meta-analyses 
have reported on the superiority of HR for the treatment of 
HCC [5,18-20]. According to these studies, the HCC recurrence 
rate was higher and the overall survival rate was lower in the 
RFA group. HCC recurrence was the main cause of death in both 
the HR and RFA groups. Therefore, more frequent recurrence 
is likely to eventually result in poorer survival. Additionally, 
in the present study, the survival curve shows that the patient 
survival may be superior in the HR group after long-term followup of more than 5 years (Fig. 2).
Huang et al. [5] mentioned that the difference in recurrence 
rates could be explained by the difference in tumor clearance 
between the 2 treatments. HCC tumor cells are mainly spread 
by the portal venous flow. Thus, HCC frequently disseminates 
along the portal vein branches in the same segment of the 
liver [5,21-24]. Segment-based anatomical HR systematically 
resects the liver, not keeping a simple safety margin from the 
tumor but completely removing tributaries of the segment 
portal vein. Therefore, anatomical HR can eradicate potential 
tumor emboli in the same segment, as well as the original 
tumor [5,25]. Repeated electrode insertion and ablation are 
usually needed in treating HCC by RFA. In those situations, it is 
essential to fully overlap ablations and to not leave nonablated 
tissue in the 3-dimensional target area; however, it is difficult 
under 2-dimensional imaging guidance [5]. Actually, according 
to 1 previous report, which histologically evaluated hepatic 
specimens after sequential RFA and HR, viable tumor cells can 
be found within extensively necrotized specimens by RFA [5,26]. 
In the present study, intrahepatic local recurrence developed 
more frequently in the RFA group, although intrahepatic distant 
and extrahepatic recurrences were similar between the 2 
groups. This result corresponds with the findings of the study 
by Huang et al. [5].
In the present study, the frequency and severity of complications were not different between the 2 groups. In general, the 
superiority of RFA with respect to adverse events is obvious 
because of its microinvasive characteristics. The unexpected 
results of the present study might be due to the methods 
used for assessing adverse events. Many adverse subjective 
symptoms, such as nausea and pain, were assessed only based 
on the patient’s complaint. Moreover, the pain was classified 
only as absence or presence of pain, and it was not assessed 
according to the pain rating scale. Therefore, this study had 
a limitation in comparing the safety of these 2 treatments. 
According to the study by Huang et al. [5], the length of hospitalization was significantly shorter and the risk of adverse 
events was lower in the RFA group however, it was clear that 

 Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research 81
serious complications were very rare in both the HR and RFA 
groups.
The present study has some limitations. First, a small number of patients were recruited. Patient recruitment was difficult 
because of very strict inclusion criteria. In addition, we decided 
to stop the study when it was presumed that HCC recurrence 
was significantly frequent in the RFA group. Second, the effectiveness of treatment methods, especially RFA, depends on the 
operator's experience and skill. In the present study, treatments 
were performed by several surgeons and radiologists in 2 centers. Hence, the results of the present study may not be reproducible. This is a common limitation of many clinical studies.
However, the present clinical study can be considered 
valuable in spite of the aforementioned minor limitations. 
There are only a few comparable clinical studies that have 
been performed in strictly homogeneous patients, similar to 
the present study. The condition of enrolled patients was so 
homogeneous that the tumors could be treated safely and effectively by either HR or RFA. The comparison between these 2 
treatment modalities was equitably made, thus minimizing 
confounding factors such as patients’ liver function and tumor 
location. Therefore, the result of the present study can be considered highly valid and unbiased.
In conclusion, although the present study was early terminated, it showed that HR was significantly superior to RFA in 
terms of disease-free survival, which might be due to more frequent intrahepatic local recurrences after RFA. However, with 
good liver function and effective subsequent treatments, the 
overall survival was excellent in both groups and not significantly different up to 5 years after treatment.
