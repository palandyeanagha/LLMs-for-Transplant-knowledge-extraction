ABSTRACT. To determine whether or not mice are susceptible to hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, C57BL/6 mice were experimentally
infected with genotypes 1, 3 and 4 HEV by intravenous injection. Serum and stool samples were collected and used to detect HEV RNA
and anti-HEV antibodies by RT-PCR and ELISA. The virus infection was monitored up to two months after inoculation; however, none
of the serum or stool samples was positive for virus replication, demonstrating that C57BL/6 mice were not susceptible to HEV.

Hepatitis E is a serious public health concern in many
developing countries, and recognized as sporadic and
endemic acute hepatitis in many industrialized countries.
Pregnant women have a high risk associated with hepatitis
E, with a high mortality rate (up to 20%) [5, 25]. The causative agent of hepatitis E is hepatitis E virus (HEV), and this
virus transmits primarily via the fecal-oral route through
contaminated drinking water [1, 6]. HEV is the sole member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. HEV
is a small round non-enveloped virus, 27–34 nm in diameter, containing an RNA genome approximately 7.2 kb in
length [2, 3]. The RNA consists of a single-strand RNA
molecule containing three discontinuous and partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The 3’ terminus of the
RNA is polyadenylated. HEV isolates were grouped into at
least four major genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (G1, G2,
G3 and G4) on the basis of nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequences [3, 6, 24]. Because G3 and G4 HEV were
isolated from pigs and wild boars in addition to humans, and
much direct and indirect evidence has indicated that HEV
transmits from pigs or wild boars to humans, hepatitis E is
recognized as a zoonotic disease [8, 18, 23]. Many studies
have reported the detection of HEV RNA and the HEV-specific antigen (HEV-Ag) in pig and wild boar stool and serum
specimens, and suggested the active circulation of this virus
among these animals [18, 20, 26]. HEV-specific antibodies
have been detected in many animals including sheep, cows,
dogs, cats, wild rats, wild deer and mongoose, in addition to
pigs and wild boars [9, 12, 14, 15, 19]. However, it is
obscure whether or not HEV substantially replicates in these
animals. In this study we infected C57BL/6 mice with G1,
G3 and G4 HEV, and monitored the virus growth to determine the susceptibility of mice to HEV infection.
G1 HEV strain was derived from stool specimens from a
cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), born and
grown in the Tsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science,
National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), which had
been experimentally infected with an Indian strain [10]. The
G3 HEV strain (DQ079632) was derived from stool specimens collected on a pig farm in Japan. The G4 HEV strain
(DQ079628) was from a stool specimen collected from a
wild boar caught in Aichi prefecture, Japan. The stool specimens were used to prepare 10% (w/v) suspensions as
described [10]. These suspensions were positive for HEV
RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). The concentrations of the G1, G3, and G4 HEV
were 5 × 104
, 2 × 104 and 1 × 105 copies per one ml of suspension, respectively, by real time RT-PCR (unpublished).
To confirm the infectivity of these stool specimens, 3
cynomolgus monkeys (4 year-old males) were inoculated
intravenously with 2 ml of one of the suspensions, and the
stools were collected daily, and used to detect HEV RNA
and HEV-Ag. Sera were collected weekly before and after
the inoculation to detect HEV RNA, HEV-Ag, and HEVspecific IgG antibodies. The sera were also used to determine ALT values. All monkey experiments were reviewed
by the Institute’s ethical committee and carried out according to “Guides for animal experiments performed at NIID”
under codes 990058, 000019 and 504006. The primates
were individually housed in BSL-2 facilities. Detection of
HEV RNA, HEV-Ag, and IgG has been described previously [8, 10, 11]. The ALT value was measured as
described [10]. As shown in the figure, HEV RNA and
HEV-Ag were detected within one week in the sera (A) and
stools (B) of all three monkeys after inoculation, and ALT
values increased more than three-fold compared with that of
pre-inoculation in infected monkeys, though the increase
was slow and the values were low in G1 HEV- and G3
HEV-infected animals (C), indicating that all three HEV
strains, G1, G3 and G4, were infectious. Furthermore, drastic increases of IgG antibody titers, probably due to extensive replication of the virus, were demonstrated in these
animals (D). These results confirmed that the HEVs used in
these experiments were indeed infectious.

Six 4-week-old and five 9-month-old C57BL/6 mice,
negative for anti-HEV antibody and HEV RNA, were inoculated intravenously with 100 µl of 10% fecal suspensions.
Serum and fecal samples were obtained at 1 week before,
and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after inoculation, and
HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgG antibodies were measured.
However, neither serum nor fecal specimens were positive
for HEV infection, clearly indicating that HEV did not replicate in C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). In other words,
the C57BL/6 mice were not susceptible to hepatitis E virus.
Anti-HEV IgM and/or IgG antibody and HEV RNA are
frequently detected in pigs and wild boars in various countries, and these 2 animals are recognized as the main reservoirs of HEV. Although the infection is asymptomatic
when G3 and G4 HEVs are used to inoculate pigs, it is obvious that pigs are susceptible to HEV infection [17]. Interestingly, pigs were resistant to experimental infection with G1
and G2 HEVs [16]. Although experimental data is not
available for wild boars, these animals are genetically close
to pigs, and wild boars are likely to be susceptible to HEV.
Direct and indirect evidence of HEV transmission from wild
boars and pigs to humans has been reported in Japan, suggesting that these animals are the main zoonotic reservoirs
in this country [8, 27]. Chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, and marmosets have been used for
experimental infection and to evaluate the efficacy of HEV
vaccines, and HEV has been used as a challenge virus, indicating that these monkeys are susceptible to HEV infection
[13, 22, 29, 30]. In addition to these animals, anti-HEV IgG
antibody has been detected in dogs, cats, cows, goats, sheep,
and rodents including rats [4, 7, 14, 19], and anti-HEV IgG
antibody and HEV RNA were detected from mongoose and
wild deer [9, 21, 28]. However, the susceptibility of these
animals to HEV infection has not been fully evaluated, and
whether or not HEV replicates in vivo in these animals is
unknown.
We evaluated the susceptibility of B57C/6 mice by
directly inoculating infectious HEV through intravenous
injection. Although two different age groups, at 4 weeks
and 9 months, were used, none of the mice was successful in
producing in vivo HEV replication. Our study clearly demonstrated that C57BL/6 mice are resistant to HEV infection.
By contrast, our preliminary results indicated that HEV is
capable of replicating in chimeric mice harboring replaced
human hepatocyte cells when exactly the same amount of
the G1, G3 and G4 HEV suspension is used (manuscript in
preparation). These results indicate that the human hepatocyte is a major target cell for HEV infection, and HEV is not
capable of replicating in mice.
