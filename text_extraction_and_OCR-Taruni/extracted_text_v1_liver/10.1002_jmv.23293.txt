INTRODUCTION

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C

. Virus (HCV) are ranked in the top 10 of all infectious diseases in terms of mortality rates.

Worldwide, approximately 370 million people are thought to have chronic HBV infection
while HCV and HIV are thought to affect 130 and 40 million people, respectively. Because of
their shared routes of transmission, superinfection with HBV or HCV among patients infected
with HIV is not uncommon. Although transmission of HBV and HCV is similar, there are
some differences; HCV is transmitted more effectively by percutaneous routes; whereas HBV
is transmitted principally sexually and perinatally. Since the introduction of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-, HBV-, and HCV-related end-stage liver disease has
become the second leading cause of death after AIDS-related mortality in many countries, a
trend that is more apparent in developed countries. Co-infection with HBV or HCV worsens
substantially the prognosis of HIV, and vice versa, and interacts with antiretroviral therapy
(ART). Some studies have reported that HIV accelerates the progression of fibrosis in patients
co-infected with HCV, and that ART-related hepatotoxicity is increased in these patients.
Indonesia is one of several countries in Asia experiencing a massive growth in the prevalence
of HIV infection. HIV is mainly transmitted among injecting drug users, and then spreads to
sex workers, the sex workers’ clients, the clients’ female partners, and ultimately their

children via vertical transmission. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of

HBV and HCV co-infection in patients infected with HIV in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia.
The study also investigated the associations of co-infection with demographic characteristics,
risk factors, CD4* F cell count, liver disease, and biochemical markers of liver fibrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Serum samples were obtained from 126 patients with HIV at Dr. Sardjito Hospital,
Yogyakarta, Indonesia, between April and July 2010. The patients were aged 21-60 years
(median, 31 years), 78 (61.9%) were males, 35 (27.8%) were females, and 13 (10.3%) were
transvestites. ALT, AST, platelet counts, APRI, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV antibody,
molecular HBV, and molecular HCV was determined. Patient interviews and medical record
reviews were also conducted for some patients to confirm the mode of HIV transmission,
demographic characteristics, CD4° T cell (CD4) count, and clinical state, including
therapeutic status, The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committees of Kobe
University, Japan, and by Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia.

 


 

 

Reversed passive hemaglutination methods were used to determine HBsAg and
anti-HBc. HBV-DNA was detected by quantitative and nested qualitative PCR assays. The
HBV viral load was measured by realtime PCR using an ABI Prism 7300 Real-Time PCR.
Briefly, HBV-DNA was extracted from 200 ml of serum using a DNA extractor kit.

A passive serological assay kit was used to detect anti-HCV antibodies. In addition,
HCV-RNA was extracted using QlAamp UltraSense Virus Kit or QIAamp Viral Mini Kit and

Teverse-transcribed into cDNA using specific primers and SuperscriptTM III One-Step _

RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase.

HBV genotyping was determined using the phylogenetic tree of the S region, while
HCV genotyping was based on NSS5B. The analyses were conducted using Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software version 17.0.

RESULTS

Of 126 patients infected with HIV, 6 (4.8%), 43 (34.1%), 4 (3.2%), and 73 (57.9%)
patients had HIV/HCV/HBV triple infection, HITV/HCV co-infection, HIV/HBV co-infection,
and HIV mono-infection, respectively. Of 49 (38.9%) patients positive for anti-HCV antibody,
serum samples from 48 patients were also tested for HCV RNA; of these, 44 (92%) were
positive for HCV-RNA. Among 10 HBsAg-positive patients, 2 (20%) HAART-naive patients
were HBV DNA positive, with viral loads of 3.4 and 4.6log copies/ml (Fig. 1b). The other
cight patients were HBV-DNA-negative, of which seven (87.5%) were receiving HAART
consisting of lamivudine or tenofovir. None of those patients were undergoing HCV therapy.
All of the patients were tested for anti-HBc. Overall, 38 (30.2%) of the patients were positive
for anti-HBc, including 5 (83.3%) with triple infection, 13 (30.2%) with HIV/HCV, 4 (100%)
with HIV/HBV, and 16 (21.9%) with HIV mono-infection. Among 29 (23%) patients with the
HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc positive, two had a single Q129R mutation within the ‘‘a’””
determinant region.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that two cases with HBsAg and HBV-DNA-positive

" were classified into genotype B3. Various genotypes of HCV were found, including genotypes

la, 1b, 1c, 3a, 3k, 4a, and 6n in 23 (52%), 1 (2%), 4 (9%), 5 (11%), 7 (16%), 3 (6%), and 1
(2%) patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, CD4* count, ALT, or
APRI among HCV genotypes, although CD4* count was lower and APRI was higher in
patients with genotype 3 than in those with genotype 1. All of the sequence data were
registered to GenBank under the accession numbers AB661784—AB661827 for HCV and the
accession numbers AB661463 and AB661464 for HBV.

 

The APRI was significantly different between the HIV mono-infection group and the
HIV/HCV coinfection group (P = 0.04). By contrast, ALT was not significantly between two
groups even though it tended to be higher in the co-infection groups than in the HIV
mono-infection group. .

There were no significant differences in age, race, marital state, HAART, CD4 count,
HBsAg, or anti-HBc between patients with HIV without or with HCV co-infection. In
univariate analyses, male sex, higher education level, injection drug use, sexual contact, ALT
> 40 IU/L, and APRI > 0.5 were significantly associated with HCV co-infection. However, in
multivariate analysis, only injection drug use [odds ratio (OR): 26.52; 95% confidence interval
(CI): 3.52-199.54] and ALT = 40 TU/L (OR: 6.36; 95% CI: 1.23-32.89) were associated
independently with HCV co-infection.

. DISCUSSION

In this study, 10 patients (8%) were co-infected with HBV and HIV, and HBV-DNA
was detected in just 2 HAART-naive patients, The other eight patients without HBV-DNA
were mostly treated by HAART containing lamivudine or tenofovir, which suggests that HB
viremia was controlled by lamivudine or tenofovir. However, HBV monotherapy in patients
infected with HIV in Indonesia is concerning because it could facilitate the appearance of
drug-resistant and vaccine escape mutants.

Anti-HBc-positive/HBsAg-negative status may appear in several conditions,
including past HBV infection and chronic infection of HBV with HB escape mutants. In the
present study, the Q129R single mutation within the ‘‘a’’ determinant region was detected in
two anti-HBcpositive/HBsA g-negative patients. It was previously reported that this mutation
is frequently encountered in patients with genotype B HBV:

_ Several HCV genotypes, including 1a, 1b, 1c, 3a, 3k, 4a, and 6n, were found in this
study, and reflect various transmission networks. HCV genotypes are not only associated with
marked geographic distribution, but also the clinical efficacy of interferon and ribavirin
therapy. Genotypes | and 4 tend to show a lower sustained virological response rate (SVR)
compared with genotypes 2 and 3. In the present study, patients with genotype 3 had lower
CD4* counts and higher APRI compared with patients with genotype 1, although these
differences were not statistically significant. Further studies in a larger number of patients may
provide further insight into the present findings.

. In univariate analyses, male sex, higher educational level, and APRI were associated
with HCV coinfection. In fact, an estimated 80% of drug users in Indonesia inject their drugs,
particularly those in urban areas and males aged 18-24 years. In Cambodia, this was also
apparent in school-age children. In the present study, HCV co-infection was independently

associated with injection drug use and elevated ALT levels, similar to that reported in several
other studies. The putative sexual transmission in ‘relation. to HCV co-infection was
investigated in a previous study, but, for this sexual or permucosal transmission of HCV to
emerge, there must be mucosal disruption as a result of traumatic sexual practices, with
exposure to infected body fluids. ,

CONCLUSION

HIV patients with a history of or current injection drug use should be treated timely
and their HCV status should be examined. Illicit drug trafficking between countries and the
increase in injection drug use seem to be the main causes of this epidemic, and should be
eradicated to reduce the burden caused by these diseases. The possibility of vaccine-related
mutants associated with the use of HBV-related drugs, such as lamivudine and tenofovir,
should also be investigated in future studies.
