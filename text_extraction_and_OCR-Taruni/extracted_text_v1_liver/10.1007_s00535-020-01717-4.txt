Abstract
Background COVID-19 has emerged as a threat to human
health. Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated.
Methods The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19,
and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed.
COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as
having severe COVID-19.
Results All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-tomoderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum
AST and/or ALT levels to C 3 times the ULN, was seen in
2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined
as elevation of the serum ALP, c-GTP and/or total bilirubin
levels to C twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%).
A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver
injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was
higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the
remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT
attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S)
ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than
in the latter patients (P \0.001). ROC curve revealed the
optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio of 1.03 for discriminating between patients with severe and non-severe
diseases. The hepatic CT attenuation values increased at
the remission phase of the disease as compared to the
values at admission (P = 0.012).
Conclusion Liver dysfunction associated with reduced
hepatic CT attenuation values correlated with the disease
severity in patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first isolated in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, as the causative virus of
a severe form of pneumonia which was subsequently
named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1, 2]. Since
then, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide, and more
than 8 million people with confirmed infection and 400,000
deaths from COVID-19 have been reported from around
the world until June 2020 [3].
Although pneumonia is the main manifestation in
patients with COVID-19 and is the main culprit in patients
with unfavorable outcomes, COVID-19 patients can also
manifest a variety of extra-respiratory symptoms, such as
muscle pain, headache, dysgeusia and/or nasty odor,
anorexia and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Moreover, liver
function test abnormalities have been reported in 15–75%
of patients with COVID-19, with the serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels being particularly high in patients with severe
disease requiring assisted ventilation [4–7]. However, the
significance of liver function abnormalities in relation to

the clinical outcome has not yet been clarified in Japanese
COVID-19 patients. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the outcomes of Japanese patients with COVID-19
according to the severity of the liver function test abnormalities, including abnormal hepatic attenuation values on
CT, seen in the patients.
Patients and methods
Patients
A total of 35 patients among 43 patients diagnosed as
having COVID-19 and hospitalized between March and
June 2020 at the Saitama Medical University Hospital
(Moroyama, Saitama, Japan) were enrolled as the subjects
of this analysis. Eight patients enrolled in the clinical trial
of favipiravir were excluded from the analysis according to
the direction by the pharmaceutical company. The clinical
features of the patients were evaluated in relation to the
outcomes, especially focusing on the results of liver
function tests at admission and during the course of hospitalization and CT findings obtained at admission. This
study conformed to the ethical guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and was conducted with the
approval of the Institutional Review Board of Saitama
Medical University Hospital, as study no. 20045.01.
Informed consent was obtained from all the patients in the
form of an opt-out consent posted on the website of Saitama Medical University Hospital (https://www.saitamamed.ac.jp/hospital/outline/irb_kouhou.html). Patients who
were unwilling to provide consent for participation in the
study were excluded.
Diagnosis of COVID-19 and classification
of the disease severity
According to the guideline published by the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan, patients
were definitively diagnosed as having COVID-19 when the
PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 performed on nasopharyngeal
swab specimens yielded a positive result. Briefly, RNA was
purified from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo,
Japan), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified by RTqPCR targeting the N2 region using the QuantiTect Probe
RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen K.K.) [8].
Patients were classified into 2 groups (severe COVID-19
and mild-to-moderate COVID-19), based on the clinical
symptoms and findings of clinical examinations, including
chest X-ray/CT, according to the therapeutic guideline for
patients with COVID-19, second edition, published by the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan [9];
patients requiring intensive care (ICU admission) and/or
assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure were classified as having severe COVID-19, while the remaining
patients were classified as having mild-to-moderate
COVID-19.
Liver function testing and CT imaging
Liver function testing was performed at admission and
during the course of hospitalization; the maximum values
within 14 days of admission were recorded. Liver function
test abnormalities were defined as follows: serum AST [
37 U/L, serum ALT [40 U/L, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [284 U/L, serum c-glutamyl transpeptidase (c-GTP) [73 U/L, and serum total
bilirubin[ 1.2 mg/dL, corresponding to the upper limit of
the normal range (ULN) for the respective parameters in
the hospital laboratory. According to a previous report,
liver injury can be classified into 3 types: hepatocellulartype injury, cholestasis-type injury, and mixed-type injury
[4]; patients with serum ALT and/or AST levels C 3 times
the ULN were classified as showing hepatocellular-type
liver injury and patients with serum ALP, c-GTP and/or
total bilirubin levels C twice the ULN were classified as
showing cholestasis-type liver injury, and patients fulfilling
the criteria for both the aforementioned types of liver injury
were classified as showing mixed-type liver injury. Patients
judged as showing abnormal liver function test results due
to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and circulatory failure,
such as ischemic liver injury and congestive hepatopathy
developing during and after hypovolemic shock and cardiac shock, respectively, were excluded from the analysis.
Moreover, hepatic and splenic attenuation values were
measured in Hounsfield units (HU) in set regions of interest
(ROIs) in the CT images obtained at admission. Two ROIs
were set in the right liver lobe and one ROI in the left liver
lobe. For each ROI, the largest possible area without
hepatic vascular and biliary structures was selected to
measure the attenuation values of the liver parenchyma.
The values for the 3 ROIs were averaged to obtain the
mean hepatic attenuation value. As an internal control, the
mean splenic attenuation values were also calculated by
averaging the values for 3 different randomly selected
ROIs. Then, the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio (L/S ratio)
was calculated using the following formula: L/S ratio = (
mean hepatic CT attenuation value)/(mean splenic CT
attenuation value).
Statistical analysis
Categorical data were compared using the Chi-squared test
or Fisher’s exact test. The distributions of continuous
variables were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U test, and

the differences were assessed by Wilcoxon’s signed-rank
test. All tests of significance were two tailed, and P values
of less than 0.05 were considered as denoting statistical
significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves were drawn to determine the optimal cut-off values
of the test variables for predicting the outcomes of the
patients. SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM SPSS, Tokyo,
Japan) was used for all the analyses.
Results
Demographic characteristics and clinical features
of patients with COVID-19
The demographic characteristics and clinical features of the
35 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this
study are shown in Table 1. The 35 patients consisted of 22
men (62.9%) and 13 women (37.1%), with a median age of
52 years (range 20–83 years). The median interval from
symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 days (range
1–19 days). Underlying diseases included hypertension in
8 patients (22.9%), diabetes mellitus in 4 patients (11.4%),
dyslipidemia in 3 patients (8.6%), cardiac disease in 2
patients (5.7%), bronchial asthma in 1 patient (2.9%), and
chronic hepatitis C in 1 patient (2.9%). The median body
mass index (BMI) was 22.5 (16.6 to 30.4).
All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission. Of the 35 patients, however,
8 patients (22.9%) were diagnosed as having severe
COVID-19 in hospital. The median age of the patients with
severe COVID-19 (58 years; range 52–67) was higher than
that of the patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19
(42 years; 20–83) (P = 0.034). The percentage of patients
with underlying hypertension was marginally higher in the
group with severe disease (50.0%) than in the group with
mild-to-moderate disease (14.8%) (P = 0.060), while the
median BMI was similar between the two groups. Moreover, the peripheral arterial oxygen saturation levels
(SpO2) under room air were lower, and the percentages of

patients with diarrhea and bilateral pneumonia on CT were
higher in the patient group with severe disease than in the
patient group with mild-to-moderate disease (P\ 0.001,
P = 0.015, and P = 0.015, respectively). As antiviral-drug
therapy, 14 patients (40.0%) received favipiravir regardless
of the clinical trial and 1 patient (2.9%) received remdesivir, and the percentage of patients treated with antiviral
therapies was higher in the patient group with severe
COVID-19 than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate
disease (P\ 0.001). Of the 8 patients with severe COVID19, 2 patients, including the single patient with underlying
chronic hepatitis C died, despite being admitted to the
intensive care unit. In contrast, all of the 27 patients
(77.1%) diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19
were recovered and the survival rate in this group of
patients was significantly higher than that in the patient
group with severe COVID-19 (P = 0.047).
Liver function test abnormalities in patients
with COVID-19
The liver function test results at admission and the maximum values recorded within 14 days of admission are
shown in Tables 2 and 3. At admission, a total of 17
patients (48.6%) exhibited liver function test abnormalities,
including elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, cGTP, and/or total bilirubin. Although the percentage of
patients showing liver function test abnormalities did not
differ between the 8 patients with severe COVID and 27
patients with mild-to-moderate disease (62.5 vs. 44.4%,
P = 0.443), the serum AST, ALT, and c-GTP levels were
higher in the patient group with severe COVID-19 (AST:
median 40, range 30–132; ALT: median 34, range 21–169;
c-GTP: median 47, range 26–149) than in the patient group
with mild-to-moderate disease (AST: median 28, range
16–105; ALT: median 21, range 8–126; c-GTP: median 27,
range 11–208) (P = 0.013, P = 0.019, and P = 0.019,
respectively).
On the other hand, 3 (8.6%) patients without abnormal
liver function test results developed the liver function test
abnormalities during the course of hospital admission.
Thus, liver function test abnormalities were seen in a total
of 20 of the 43 patients (57.1%) during the observation
period. The maximum values of the serum AST (U/L),
ALT (U/L), c-GTP (U/L), and total bilirubin levels (mg/
dL) were higher in the patient group with severe COVID19 (AST: median 82, range 32–222; ALT: median 76,
range 28–237; c-GTP: median 145, range 25–497; total
bilirubin: median 1.1, range 0.7–9.6) than in the patient
group with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (AST: median 31,
range 16–198; ALT: median 29, range 8–218; c-GTP:
median 30, range 13–353; total bilirubin: median 0.6, range
0.3–1.8) (P = 0.010, P = 0.034, P = 0.003, and P = 0.002,
respectively). Moreover, the percentage of patients showing serum ALP levels higher than the ULN were also
higher in the patient group with severe COVID-19 than in
the patient group with mild-to-moderate disease (50.0 vs.
22.2%, P = 0.009).
Increase of the serum AST and ALT levels to C 3 times
the ULN was seen in 4 patients (11.4%) and 5 patients
(14.3%) patients, respectively, and increase of the serum
ALP, c-GTP, and total bilirubin levels to C twice the ULN
was seen in 4 patients (11.4%), 6 patients (17.1%), and 2
patients (5.7%), respectively. Thus, a total of 9 patients

(25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of liver
injury, including 2 (5.7%) patients with hepatocellular-type
injury, 4 (11.4%) patients with cholestasis-type injury, and
3 patients (8.6%) with mixed-type injury. The percentage
of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for liver injury
was higher in the 8 patients with severe COVID-19 than in
the remaining 27 patients with mild-to-moderate disease
(75.0 vs. 11.1%, P = 0.001), and the difference was
accounted for entirely by patients with cholestasis-type
liver injury (37.5 vs. 3.7%, P = 0.030).
Hepatic CT attenuation values in patients
with COVID-19
The findings of CT at admission revealed that the hepatic
CT attenuation values (HU) and L/S ratios were lower in
the 8 patients with severe COVID-19 (HU: median 36.47,
range 24.07–51.08; L/S ratio: median 0.81, range
0.49–1.41) than in the remaining 27 patients with mild-tomoderate disease (HU: median 56.09, range 39.07–70.85;
L/S ratio: median 1.23, range 0.83–1.54) (P \0.001 and
P \0.001, respectively) (Table 2). ROC curve analysis
identified the optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio at
admission of 1.03 to predict severe COVID-19 during
hospitalization, which yielded an AUC of 0.875 (sensitivity
77.8%, specificity 62.5%, P = 0.001) (Fig. 1). Moreover,
the CT attenuation values and L/S ratios were lower in the
9 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for liver
injury (HU: median 39.67, range 24.07–67.88; L/S ratio:
median 0.83, range 0.49–1.25) than in the 26 patients who
did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for liver injury (HU:
median 54.92, range 39.07–70.85; L/S ratio: median 1.23,
range 0.87–1.54) (P = 0.010 and P = 0.002, respectively);
these differences were seen for both patients with
cholestasis-type liver injury (HU: median 49.48, range

liver injury (HU: median 31.87, range 24.07–39.67;
P = 0.040; L/S ratio: median 0.66, range 0.49–0.83;

Of the 35 patients, the CT was repeated during the
remission phase of the disease (median interval after
admission, 26 days (range 19–72) in 8 patients, including 5
patients who had been diagnosed as having severe COVID19. The hepatic CT attenuation values (HU) increased from
a median of 41.78 (range 24.07–69.79) at admission to
55.56 (range 37.15–70.07) in the repeat CT obtained during
the remission phase (P = 0.012), accompanied by an
increase of the L/S ratio from 0.98 (range 0.49–1.47) to
1.26 (range 0.81–1.50) (P = 0.012) (Fig. 2).
Representative hepatic CT images in a 52-year-old
woman with severe COVID-19 were shown in Fig. 3. She
was diagnosed as having moderate COVID-19 at
admission, and CT examination revealed hepatic CT
attenuation values and L/S ratio as 24.07 HU and 0.49,
respectively. She was diagnosed as having severe COVID19 4 days later, but was rescued following intensive therapies including intravenous infusions of high dose corticosteroid. Although body weights were increased from
59.5 kg at admission to 62.0 kg at the remission phase,
both hepatic CT attenuation values and L/S ratio were
increased to 52.37 HU and 1.18, respectively, at 30 days
after the admission.
Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 35 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and found
that of the 35, 20 (57.1%) patients exhibited liver function
test abnormalities, namely, elevated serum levels of AST,
ALT, ALP, c-GTP, and/or total bilirubin. The abnormalities were already detectable at admission in 17 patients
(48.6%), while they developed during the course of hospital admission in the remaining 3 patients (8.6%). Among
these patients, 9 (25.7%) patients fulfilled the diagnostic
criteria for liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum
AST and/or ALT levels to C 3 times the UNL (hepatocellular-type liver injury) and/or elevation of the serum
ALP, c-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to C twice the

UNL (cholestasis-type liver injury): 2 patients showed
hepatocellular-type liver injury, 4 patients showed
cholestasis-type liver injury, and 3 patients showed mixedtype liver injury. According to a study reported by Cai et al.
from China, liver function test abnormalities were seen in
318 (76.3%) out of 417 patients with COVID-19, and of
these, 90 patients (21.5%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria
for liver injury as defined in the present study [4]. While
the percentage of COVID-19 patients exhibiting liver
function test abnormalities was lower in the present study
than in the study reported by Cai et al. from China [4], the
percentage of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for
liver injury was almost similar between the two studies. In
regard to the prevalence of liver function test abnormalities
reported by other studies, a meta-analysis conducted by
Sultan et al. revealed that 377 (15.0%) of 2,514 patients
covered by 16 reports showed abnormally elevated serum
ALT levels, and that 307 (16.7%) out of 1,841 patients
covered by 10 reports showed abnormally elevated serum
total bilirubin levels [5]. Another meta-analysis conducted
by Mao et al.revealed liver function test abnormalities in 241
(19.0%) of 1,267 patients covered by 12 reports [6].
Richardson et al. reported, based on the data from a large
cohort in New York city, that among 2,634 patients with
COVID-19 who had already died or been discharged, evidence of acute liver injury, defined as serum AST or ALT
levels C 15 times the ULN, was observed in 56 patients
(2.1%), of which 53 died (94.6%) [10]. The frequencies of
liver function test abnormalities and liver injury, especially
fatal liver injury, in COVID-19 patients in Japan needs to be
investigated in a large cohort in the future.
Of the 35 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 8
patients (22.9%) were diagnosed as having severe disease
in hospital, requiring ICU monitoring and/or assisted

ventilator, and the serum AST, ALT, and c-GTP levels at
admission were higher in the patient group with severe
COVID-19 than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate
disease. Moreover, the maximum serum AST, ALT, cGTP, and total bilirubin levels recorded within 14 days of
admission were also higher in the patient group with severe
disease than in the patient group with non-severe disease.
Although the median serum ALP levels were similar
between the two groups of patients, the percentage of
patients with elevation of the serum ALP levels over the
UNL during the period of admission was higher in the
patient group with severe disease than in the patient group
with mild-to-moderate disease. Furthermore, the percentage of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for liver
injury was higher in the patient group with severe COVID19 than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate disease.
These data suggest that liver function test abnormalities,
including those fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for liver
injury, were more frequent in the patient group with severe
COVID-19 than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate
disease. Similar results were reported by Cai et al. [4], but
they concluded that hepatocellular-type and mixed-type
liver injuries were predictive of severe disease in patients
with COVID-19. In contrast, in the present study, the
percentage of patients with cholestasis-type liver injury
was higher in the patient group with severe COVID-19
than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate disease.
This discrepancy in the results between Japan and China
needs to be investigated further in a multicenter study.
The mechanisms underlying the development of liver
injuries in patients with COVID-19 have not yet been
clarified, but it appears that SARS-CoV-2 can induce liver
injury both directly and indirectly via the excessive
immune responses elicited by it [11]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be a
key receptor, expressed in various cells of the body, for
SARS-CoV-2 attachment [12, 13], and it is known to be
expressed at a low level in the liver [14]. Wang et al.
demonstrated, by electron-microscopic examination, the
presence of coronavirus particles, characterized by a spike
structure, in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in patients with
COVID-19; they also reported that hepatocytes in COVID19 patients showed an apoptotic binuclear appearance on
histological examination [15]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has
been demonstrated to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, leading to damage of the cells [16]. Thus, SARSCoV-2 could directly induce both hepatocellular-type liver
injury and cholestasis-type liver injury.
In the present study, only one of the patients had an
underlying liver disease. The patient had been previously
diagnosed as having chronic hepatitis C, and eventually
died of severe COVID-19. Based on an analysis using the
linked electronic health records of 17 million adult NHS
patients in England, Williamson et al. identified underlying
chronic liver disease as a risk factor for COVID-19-related
hospital death, with a hazard ratio of 1.61 [17]. Similar
results were reported by Singh et al., based on analysis of
data obtained from electronic health records in the United
States; they reported pre-existing liver disease as a risk
factor for death in patients with COVID-19, with a hazard
ratio of 2.8 [18]. According to a report from China, among
various liver diseases, non-alcoholic liver disease
(NAFLD) was identified as a risk factor for progression of
COVID-19 in 202 patients [19]. The significance of
underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infection still remains to be elucidated
[20, 21]. Therefore, further investigations in the Japanese
population are needed.
To our surprise, hepatic CT findings at admission were
associated with the disease severity of patients with
COVID-19 during the hospitalization. Both the hepatic CT
attenuation values and the L/S ratios were lower in the
patient group with severe COVID-19 than in the patient
group with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 despite that both
patients were diagnosed as mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at
admission when CT examinations were done. Moreover,
the hepatic CT attenuation values were higher during the
remission phase as compared to the values at admission. In
general, hepatic CT attenuation values are reduced in
patients with steatosis, and in patients with acute liver
failure, necrotic areas in the liver have been reported to
show decreased CT attenuation values [22]. The median
BMI and percentages of patients with underling diabetes
were similar between the patient group with severe
COVID-19 and the patient group with mild-to-moderate
COVID-19, as well as between patients with and without
evidence of liver injury in our study, suggesting that factors
other than baseline hepatic steatosis may contribute to the
reduced hepatic CT attenuation values in the patients with
severe COVID-19 observed in this study. Moreover, considering that both patients with cholestasis-type liver injury
and patients with hepatocellular-type liver injury showed
reduced hepatic CT attenuation values, the contribution of
liver necrosis to the decreased hepatic CT attenuation
values seen in patients with severe COVID-19 seems
unlikely. The contribution of hepatic steatosis, however,
should be further investigated, since SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to affect lipid metabolisms through
decrease of serum LDL and HDL levels especially in
patients with severe COVID-19 [23, 24]. The reasons for
the decreased hepatic CT attenuation values in patients
with severe COVID-19 need to be investigated in the future
in reference to hepatic CT attenuation values in patients
with other hepatotoxic viral infection. ROC analysis,
however, revealed an optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio
in the CT obtained at admission of 1.03, to identify patients

with severe COVID-19. The L/S ratio in the CT obtained at
admission merits investigation as a potential marker to
predict an unfavorable outcome in patients with COVID19.
The present study was done retrospectively in a single
institute subjected for a small number cohort, and we had
to exclude 8 patients enrolled in the clinical trial of
favipiravir under direction by the Good Clinical Practice
(GCP) in Japan. The former limitation should be overcome
in a large number cohort enrolled in multiple institutions in
the future. Biases due to the latter matter, however, would
be excluded in the present study, since the same results
were obtained when analyses were done in a total of 43
patients including 8 patients receiving favipiravir (data not
shown). Moreover, underling liver diseases including
hepatic steatosis preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection were
unclear in the most patients in the present study. Patients
with lean-type NASH [25] might be present in those
manifesting decreased CT attenuation values in the liver.
This matter should be also solved in the further prospective
study.
In conclusion, liver function test abnormalities, especially evidence of cholestasis-type liver injury, were more
frequent in the patient group with severe COVID-19 than
in the patient group with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Moreover, the hepatic CT attenuation values as well as the
L/S ratios were lower in the patient group with severe
COVID-19 than in the patient group with mild-to-moderate
disease. Future studies in larger cohorts are warranted to
precisely clarify the significance of liver injury associated
with low hepatic CT attenuation values in Japanese patients
with COVID-19.
