The actual 5‑year survivors 
of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma based 
on real‑world data
Axel Bengtsson, RolandAndersson & DanielAnsari*
Survival data for pancreatic cancer are usually based on actuarial calculations and actual longterm survival rates are rarely reported. Here we use population-level data from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program for patients with microscopically confrmed pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 1975 to 2011. A total of 84,275 patients with at least 5 years 
of follow-up were evaluated (follow-up cutof date: December 31, 2016). Actual 5-year survival for 
pancreatic cancer increased from 0.9% in 1975 to 4.2% in 2011 in patients of all stages (p< 0.001), 
while in surgically resected patients, it rose from 1.5% to 17.4% (p< 0.001). In non-resected patients, 
the actual 5-year survival remained unchanged over the same time period (0.8% vs 0.9%; p= 0.121). 
Multivariable analysis of surgically resected patients diagnosed in the recent time era (2004–2011) 
showed that age, gender, grade, tumour size, TNM-stage and chemotherapy were signifcant 
independent predictors of actual 5-year survival, while age, grade and TNM-stage were signifcant 
independent predictors in non-resected patients. However, unfavourable clinicopathological factors 
did not preclude long-term survival. Collectively, our fndings indicate that actual 5-year survival 
for pancreatic cancer is still below 5% despite improvement of survival for the subset of patients 
undergoing surgical resection.
Pancreatic cancer carries the lowest survival rate of all major organ cancers and is the third leading contributor 
to cancer mortality in the United States1
. Following diagnosis, survival typically ranges from 4 to 6 months2. 
Although 5-year survival rates of up to 30–58% in resected pancreatic cancer patients have been reported, the 
data for actual 5-year survival are more modest3
. Several series have failed to present any 5-year survivors and 
there are those that suggest that the overall actual survival rate is below 0.3% when all stages are combined4,5
.
Prognostic factors for short-term survival in pancreatic cancer are well reported. However, factors predicting 
long-term survival are less understood. Clinical and pathological features predictive of actuarial 5-year survival 
may not refect the factors specifc to actual long-term survivors (LTS)6,7
. Tis is due to the high early diseaserelated mortality seen in pancreatic cancer8
 in addition to the infated survival present in actuarial data when 
loss of follow-up is present in the patient material3
. Terefore, predictors of long-term survival in populationbased data, where exclusion of patients lost to follow up is a prerequisite for the comparison of variables among 
subgroups, must be based on actual rather than actuarial data.
Te disparities in patient characteristics between clinical trials and registries presenting real world data 
(RWD) are refected in the survival of pancreatic cancer, with clinical trial patients having markedly improved 
survival compared to national database populations9
. Tus, when describing characteristics of patient subgroups 
such as LTS in terms of predictors, contemporary population-based RWD are better able to make generalisations 
pertaining to the real-world efect of modern treatment strategies10,11.
Nearly all previous studies of actual LTS (≥5 years) in pancreatic cancer have been single-institution series 
and describe a limited number of patients. Here, we use data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in the era following the publication of the fnal results of the 
ESPAC 1-trial12 of adjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Te aim of the present study was to analyse

trends in actual long-term survival of pancreatic cancer and to identify predictors of long-term survival in the 
recent time era.
Results
Patient characteristics. Data were obtained from 181,392 patients with pancreatic cancer registered in the 
SEER database between 1975 and 2011. Some 74,367 patients lacking histological or cytological confrmation of 
the tumour and 22,750 patients with no information on cause of death or vital status or incomplete follow-up 
time were excluded. Te fnal study population comprised 84,275 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, out of whom 38,709 patients were diagnosed between 2004 and 2011. Some 2440 patients (2.9%) of our 
total study population had a survival exceeding 5 years.
Te characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1. Median age at diagnosis was 68 years 
and 48.7% were female. Some 7.1% of patients had a localized tumour, 31.2% had regional spread, 56.0% had 
distant disease and 5.7% were unstaged. Some 18.5% of patients underwent surgical resection, 46.1% received 
chemotherapy and 20.7% received radiation.
Demographic and clinical data from the LTS were compared with those of the STS for the recent time era 
(2004–2011), as shown in Table 2. LTS were signifcantly younger at diagnosis and were more ofen female. 
Tumours of LTS were more likely to be smaller in size. However, unfavourable clinicopathological factors did 
not preclude long-term survival. Te majority of LTS received surgical resection (82.8%), while only 17.2% 
underwent resection among STS. Chemotherapy and radiation were also administered more frequently in LTS.
Univariable and multivariable analysis of factors associated with LTS. We examined factors associated with LTS in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression (Table 3). When considering patients 
of all stages, age, gender, T-stage, M-stage, tumour size, histological grade, surgical resection and chemotherapy 
were identifed as independent predictors of LTS. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether the 
predictive factors were diferent between resected and non-resected patients. For surgically resected patients, 
age, gender, TNM-stage, tumour size, grade, and chemotherapy remained as signifcant independent predictors 
of LTS. In non-resected patients, only age, TNM-stage and grade were independent predictors of LTS.
Trends in actual survival and distribution of tumour stages. Actual 5-year survival by AJCC-stage 
for patients diagnosed in the recent era (2004–2011) is presented in Table 4. Actual 5-year survival was 31.7% 
for IA tumours, and decreased to 11.8% in stage IB patients, while stage IV tumours showed an actual 5-year 
survival of 0.5%. Figure 1 presents the proportions of SEER summary stage A from 1975 to 2011 in patients of all 
stages. Te proportion of patients with localized disease was 5.4% in 1975 compared to 7.0% in 2011 (p<0.001).
Figure 2 depicts the trend analysis of actual 5-year survival in patients of all stages and the subgroups of surgically resected and non-resected patients from 1975 to 2011. Te actual 5-year survival for all stages in 1975 was 
0.9% and rose to 4.2% in 2011 (p<0.001). Surgically resected patients saw an increase in actual 5-year survival 
from 1.5% in 1975 to 17.4% in 2011 (p<0.001). Some 0.8% of non-resected patients passed the 5-year mark in 
1975 while 0.9% did so in 2011 (p=0.121).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the largest evaluation of LTS in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 
the modern era. As stated earlier, most previous studies of actual survival have been single centre reports with 
a limited number of LTS for analysis6–8,13–24. A few population-based studies of survival trends in pancreatic 
cancer have been published25–28. Still, most of these studies make use of older data and do not investigate actual 
survivors of the disease further. Kardosh et al27 was the only population-based study investigating predictors of 
actual survival, including 39,460 patients in the California Cancer Registry from 1988 to 2009. However, this 
study evaluated prognostic factors in a timeframe overlapping the pre- and post-ESPAC-1-era (2004–present). 
To achieve comparability as well as generalisability of our fndings, we set out to analyse the largest recent dataset 
of actual LTS.
In this study, we exclusively evaluated patients with microscopically confrmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 
order to provide reliable survival data. We found lower age, female gender, histologic grade, tumour size, T-stage, 
M-stage, surgical resection and receipt of chemotherapy to be independent prognostic factors of long-term survival. In surgically resected patients, nodal status was also an independent factor. Survival plots demonstrated a 
marked increase in actual survival for surgically resected patients, from 1.5% in 1975 to 17.4% in 2011. Patients of 
all stages showed an actual survival of just 4.2% in 2011, and actual survival without surgical treatment remained 
below the 1% mark, showing no improving trend since the start of data collection.
Statistically determined factors may not completely predict the patients that eventually achieve long-term 
survival14. In our cohort, disparities between actual patient characteristics and the prognostic modelling were 
found. While the LTS generally had more favourable clinicopathological features, the presence of aggressive

characteristics (e.g. poor/anaplastic diferentiation, late stage disease) or lack of surgical resection did not preclude long-term survival. Te presence of a high number of patients with favourable prognostic factors in the LTS 
cohorts is believed to indicate inherent diferences in biological tumour behavior14,18,24,27. Attempts have been 
made at deciphering this diference through molecular studies. Molin et al29 conducted whole-exome sequencing 
of patients who survived≥10 years. KRAS mutations were identifed in 94% from LTS, while TP53, SMAD4, and 
CDKN2A mutations were found in 69%, 26%, and 17%, respectively. RNF43 mutations were identifed in 11%. 
Teir data could not demonstrate any diference in somatic mutations in carcinomas from LTS compared to available data from unselected pancreatic cancer patients. In another study, Balachandran et al30 conducted extensive 
immunoprofling of patients with long-term survival (overall survival>3 years from surgery; median survival 
6 years) and patients with short-term survival (overall survival<1 year from surgery; median survival 0.8 years). 
Tey found that long-term survivors harbour neoantigens with unique qualities as T-cell targets in pancreatic 
cancer and propose a role for immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer based on directed neoantigen targeting.
As expected, stage and surgery had the strongest predictive capabilities among all our measured variables. 
Major improvements have been made in the surgical management of pancreatic cancer over the past decades 
due to advances in surgical technique and perioperative care. Operative mortality associated with pancreatoduodenectomy has decreased from around 25% in the 1970s to under 2% at high-volume centres in recent 
series, and the focus has now shifed from surviving the operation to surviving the cancer31. Importantly, the 
introduction of chemotherapy has come to greatly improve median survival and actuarial 5-year survival rates 
following surgical resection12. However, the impact of chemotherapy on actual LTS remains less clear. We found 
that chemotherapy was independently associated with LTS. Several single-centre studies have reported actual 
5-year survival among resected patients in the range of 8.1–30.7%6–8,13–24, which is in line with the current 
study, but none of these studies could statistically confrm the independent clinical beneft of chemotherapy for 
LTS as shown by us. Furthermore, the relatively stable proportion of localized disease over time and the dismal 
long-term survival rate (4.2%) for the whole cohort in our study underscore the urgent need for improvements 
in diagnostic procedures alongside improvement in oncological therapy. A predominant proportion of patients 
progress asymptomatically, which calls for eforts to bring about early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer. It 
has been proposed that a strategy involving an increase in the percentage of individuals diagnosed with IA cancer 
could, with the current treatment arsenal, greatly improve survival and the chance for cure2
. As we demonstrated 
in our cohort, the greatest reduction in actual survival exists between AJCC stages IA and IB. Te development of 
efective early detection programs has been conceptualized32 and involves the identifcation of novel and existing 
biomarkers of pancreatic cancer for use in a high-risk cohort. Such development requires strategic collaboration 
between academia, industry and government.
Tis study has several limitations inherent to the use of a multi-institutional registry. Te SEER registry conducts quality control activities regularly to ensure data accuracy and consistency. However, the SEER registry 
may underestimate treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, due to outpatient treatment, or patients

leaving the registry catchment area for treatments33. We included only microscopically confrmed cases, a criterion that improves reliability of data, but may have contributed to the high resection rate (18.5%) observed in our 
patient material. Furthermore, the registry also contains missing values. We handled missing values by multiple 
imputation technique, which is a suitable method that reduces selection bias and improves generalisability, but 
necessitates caution when interpreting the results.
In conclusion, our study identifed predictive factors for actual long-term survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using population-based real-world data. Actual survival has only marginally improved over the past 
decades and patients of all stages still retain a 5-year survival below 5%. Te greatest reduction of long-term 
survival is observed from stages IA to IB. As the proportion of patients with localized stage disease has remained 
exceedingly low over time, this calls for further strategic developments of early detection tools. Furthermore, 
given the poor survival rate even afer potentially curative surgery, novel oncological treatments need to be 
developed to address occult, systemic, micrometastatic disease. Te future therapeutic developments of pancreatic cancer may be aided by better molecular understanding of the disease as a whole, but also by increased 
knowledge obtained by studying LTS.
Methods
Study population and selection criteria. Te SEER database is a population-based cancer registry that 
assembles data related to demographics, incidence and survival of cancer patients in the United States. Data were 
obtained from all cancer registries participating in the SEER program using SEER*Stat version 8.3.6 (November 
2018 data submission). Te study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research at Lund University (Ref 2016/100) and conducted in accordance with the STROBE guidelines34.
All patients with pancreatic cancer registered in the SEER database between 1975 and 2011 were included in 
the study group. Patients were identifed on the basis of the International Classifcation of Diseases for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) for tumours of the exocrine pancreas: C25.0, C25.1, C25.2, C25.3, C25.7, C25.8 
and C25.9. Only cases with microscopically confrmed infltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (ICDO-3 histology codes 8140/3 and 8500/3 respectively) were selected. Patients with missing values on duration of 
follow-up or cause of death were excluded. Te SEER historic stage A was used in the description of the overall 
population in order to present a uniform classifcation, as the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
staging system was not available for older time periods. Te latest date of follow-up was on December 31, 2016. 
Patients deceased from non-cancerous causes within 5 years of diagnosis were excluded.
Information was available on age, gender, calendar year of diagnosis, tumour location, histological grade, 
tumour size, stage (SEER historic tumour stage A and AJCC/TNM staging), surgical resection, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, survival time and vital status.
Te primary endpoint was actual 5-year survival.
Statistical analysis. We compared clinicopathological variables between long-term survivors (LTS; actual 
survival≥5 years) and short-term survivors (STS; actual survival<5 years) using Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables and Pearson’s Chi-square (χ2
) test for categorical variables. A trend analysis of actual 5-year 
survival by year in surgically resected, non-resected, and all patient stages was conducted. Trend curves were 
tested for signifcance using linear-by-linear association. Factors associated with actual 5-year survival were 
assessed with logistic regression. Any variable from univariable logistic regression with a p value<0.25 was 
selected as a candidate for the multivariable analysis. In the iterative process of variable selection, covariates 
were removed from the model if they were nonsignifcant and not a confounder, as described by Hosmer–
Lemeshow35, resulting in a main efect model. Missing values were imputed using the multiple imputation with 
chained equations technique, as described by White and colleagues36. Te imputation method was predictive 
mean matching. Te number of iterations for each chain was ten, as was the number of imputed data sets. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 26 and Stata/MP 14.2.
Informed consent. Te SEER registry contains strictly de-identifed patient data. Te Ethics Committee for 
Clinical Research at Lund University (Ref 2016/100), Sweden, approved the study protocol and waived the need 
for written informed consent from the participants.
