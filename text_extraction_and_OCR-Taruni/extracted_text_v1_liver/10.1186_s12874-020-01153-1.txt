Abstract
Background: Predicting survival of recipients after liver transplantation is regarded as one of the most important
challenges in contemporary medicine. Hence, improving on current prediction models is of great interest.
Nowadays, there is a strong discussion in the medical field about machine learning (ML) and whether it has greater
potential than traditional regression models when dealing with complex data. Criticism to ML is related to unsuitable
performance measures and lack of interpretability which is important for clinicians.
Methods: In this paper, ML techniques such as random forests and neural networks are applied to large data of
62294 patients from the United States with 97 predictors selected on clinical/statistical grounds, over more than 600,
to predict survival from transplantation. Of particular interest is also the identification of potential risk factors. A
comparison is performed between 3 different Cox models (with all variables, backward selection and LASSO) and 3
machine learning techniques: a random survival forest and 2 partial logistic artificial neural networks (PLANNs). For
PLANNs, novel extensions to their original specification are tested. Emphasis is given on the advantages and pitfalls of
each method and on the interpretability of the ML techniques.
Results: Well-established predictive measures are employed from the survival field (C-index, Brier score and
Integrated Brier Score) and the strongest prognostic factors are identified for each model. Clinical endpoint is overall
graft-survival defined as the time between transplantation and the date of graft-failure or death. The random survival
forest shows slightly better predictive performance than Cox models based on the C-index. Neural networks show
better performance than both Cox models and random survival forest based on the Integrated Brier Score at 10 years.
Conclusion: In this work, it is shown that machine learning techniques can be a useful tool for both prediction and
interpretation in the survival context. From the ML techniques examined here, PLANN with 1 hidden layer predicts
survival probabilities the most accurately, being as calibrated as the Cox model with all variables.

Background
Liver transplantation (LT) is the second most common
type of transplant surgery in the United States after kidney
[1]. Over the last decades, the success of liver transplants
has improved survival outcome for a large number of
patients suffering from chronic liver disease everywhere
on earth [2]. Availability of donor organs is a major limitation especially when compared with the growing demand
of liver candidates due to the enlargement of age limits.
Therefore, improvement on current prediction models for
survival since LT is important.
There is an open discussion about the value of machine
learning (ML) versus statistical models (SM) within
clinical and healthcare practice [3–7]. For survival data,
the most commonly applied statistical model is the Cox
proportional hazards regression model [8]. This model
allows a straightforward interpretation, but is at the same
time restricted to the proportional hazards assumption.
On the other hand, ML techniques are assumption-free
and data adaptive which means that they can be effectively
employed for modelling complex data. In this article,
the results between SM and ML techniques are assessed
based on a 3-stage comparison: predictive performance
for large sample size/large number of covariates, calibration (absolute accuracy) which is often neglected, and
interpretability in terms of the most prognostic factors
identified. Advantages and disadvantages for each method
are detailed.
ML techniques need a precise set of operating conditions to perform well. It is important that a) the
data have been adequately processed so that the inputs
allow for good learning, b) modern method is applied
using state-of-the-art programming software and c)
proper tuning of the parameters is performed to avoid
sub-optimal or default choices for parameters which
downgrade the algorithm’s performance. Danger of overfitting is associated with ML approaches (as they employ
complex algorithms). A note of caution is required
during model training to prevent from overfitting, e.g.
the selection of suitable hyper-parameters. Needless
to say, overfitting might also occur with a traditional
model if it is too complex (estimation of too many
parameters) thus limiting generalizability outside training
instances.
Neural networks have been commonly applied in
healthcare. Consequently, different approaches for timeto-event endpoints are present in the literature. Biganzoli
et al. proposed a partial logistic regression approach of
feed forward neural networks (PLANN) for flexible modelling of survival data [9]. By using the time interval as
an input in a longitudinally transformed feed forward
network with logistic activation and entropy error function, they estimated smoothed discrete hazards at each
time interval in the output layer. This is a well known
approach for modelling survival neural networks [10]. In
2000, Xiang et al. [11] compared the performance of 3
existing neural network methods for right censored data
(the Faraggi-Simon [12], the Liestol-Andersen-Andersen
[13] and a modification of the Buckley-James method
[14]) with Cox models in a Monte Carlo simulation study.
None of the networks outperformed the Cox models and
they only performed as good as Cox for some scenarios.
Lisboa et al. extended the PLANN approach introducing
a Bayesian framework which can perform Automatic Relevance Determination for survival data (PLANN-ARD)
[15]. Several applications of the PLANN and the PLANNARD methods can be found in the literature [16–19]. They
show potential for neural networks in systems with nonlinearity and complex interactions between factors. Here
extensions of the PLANN approach for big LT data are
examined.
The clinical endpoint of interest for this study is overall
graft-survival defined as the time between LT and graftfailure or death. Predicting survival after LT is hard as it
depends on many factors and is associated with donor,
transplant and recipient characteristics whose importance
changes over time and per outcome measure [20]. Models that combine donor and recipient characteristics have
usually better performance for predicting overall graftsurvival and particularly those that include sufficient
donor risk factors have better performance for long-term
graft survival [21]. The aims of this manuscript can be
summarised as: i) potential role of ML as a competitor of
traditional methods when complexity of the data is high
(large sample size, high dimensional setting), ii) identification of potential risk factors using 2 ML methods (random
survival forest, survival neural networks) complementary
to the Cox model, iii) use of variable selection methods to

compare their predictive ability with the models including
the non-reduced set of variables, iv) evaluation of predictions and goodness of fit, and v) clinical relevance of the
findings (potential for medical applications).
The paper is organized as follows. “Methods” section
presents details about data collection and the imputation technique, SMs and ML. Further sections discuss model training, predictive performance assessment
on test data, and details about interpretability of the
models. Comparisons between models based on global
performance measures, prediction error curves, variable
importance and calibration plots are discussed in the
“Results” section. The article is concluded by the “Discussion” section about findings, limitations of this work
and future perspectives. All analyses were performed in
R programming language version 3.5.3 [22]. Preliminary
results were presented at 40th Annual Conference of the
International Society for Clinical Biostatistics [23].
Methods
An analysis is presented on survival data after LT based
on 62294 patients from the United States. Information was collected from the United Network of Organ
Sharing (UNOS)1. After extensive pre-processing from a
set of more than 600 covariates, 97 variables were included
in the final dataset based on clinical and statistical considerations (see Additional file 1); 52 donor and 45 liver
recipient characteristics (missing values were imputed).
As the UNOS data is large in both number of observations and covariates, it is of interest to see how ML
algorithms - which are able to capture naturally multiway interactions between variables and can deal with big
datasets - will perform compared to Cox models. The
clinical endpoint is overall graft-survival (OGS) the time
between LT and graft-failure or death. The choice for this
endpoint was made for two reasons 1) it is of primary
interest for clinicians and 2) it is the most appropriate
outcome measure to evaluate the efficacy of LT, because
it incorporates both patient mortality and survival of the
graft [21].
This section is divided into different subsections including the necessary components of analyses for OGS (provided in “Results” section). We discuss in detail both Cox
models and ML techniques (Random Survival Forest, Survival Neural Networks). Elements of how the models were
trained and how the predictive performance was assessed
on the test data are presented. More technical details
are provided in the supplementary material. We conclude
this extensive section with a focus on methods to extract
interpretation for the ML approaches.
1UNOS is a non-profit and scientific organisation in the United States which
arranges organ donation and transplantation. For more information visit its
website https://unos.org.
Data collection and imputation technique
UNOS manages the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and together they collect, organise
and maintain data of statistical information regarding
organ transplants in the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients (SRTR) database2. SRTR gathers data from
local Organ Procurement Organisations (OPO) and from
OPTN (primary source). It includes data from transplantations performed in the United States from 1988
onwards. This information is used to set priorities and
seek improvements in the organ donation process.
The data provided by UNOS included 62294 patients
who underwent LT surgery from 2005 to 2015 (project
under DUA number 9477). Standard analysis files contained 657 variables for both donors and patients (candidates and recipients). Among these, 97 candidate risk
factors - 52 donor and 45 patient characteristics - were
pre-selected before carrying out analysis. This resulted
in a final dataset with 76 categorical and 21 continuous
variables amounting to 2.2% missing data overall. The percentage of missing values for each covariate varied from
0 to 26.61% (no missing values for 26 covariates, up to
1% missingness for 51 covariates, 1 to 10% for 11 variables, 10 to 25% for 7 variables and 25 to 26.61% for only
2 variables). Analysis on the complete case would reduce
the available sample size from 62294 to 33394 patients
leading to a huge waste of data. Furthermore, this could
lead to invalid results (underestimation or overestimation
of survival) if the excluded group of patients represents
a subgroup from the entire sample [24]. To reconstruct
the missing values the missForest algorithm [25] was
applied for both continuous and categorical variables.
This is a non-parametric imputation method that does
not make explicit assumptions about the functional form
of the data and builds a random forest model for each
variable (500 trees were used). It specifies the model to
predict missing values by using information based on the
observed values. It is the most exhaustive and accurate
of all random forests algorithms used for missing data
imputation, because all possible variable combinations are
checked as responses.
Cox proportional Hazard regression models
In survival analysis, the focus is on the time till the occurrence of the event of interest (here graft-failure or death).
The Cox proportional hazards model is usually employed
to estimate the effect of risk factors on the outcome of
interest [8].
Data with sample size n consist of the independent observations from the triple (T, D, X) i.e.
(t1, d1, x1), ··· ,(tn, dn, xn). For the i
th individual, ti is the
survival time, di the indicator (di = 1 if the event occurred

and di = 0 if the observation is right censored) and xi is
the vector of predictors (x1, ··· , xp). The hazard function
of the Cox model with time-fixed covariates is as follows:
h(t|X) = h0(t) exp 
XTβ

, (1)
where h(t|X) is the hazard at time t given predictor values X, h0(t) is an arbitrary baseline hazard and β =
(β1, ··· , βp) is a parameter vector.
The corresponding partial likelihood can be written as:
L(β) = 
D
i=1
exp p
k=1 βkXik

j∈R(ti) exp p
k=1 βkZjk , (2)
where D is the set of failures, and R(ti) is the risk set at
time ti of all individuals who are still in the study at the
time just before time ti. This function is then maximised
over β to estimate the model parameters.
Two other Cox models were employed 1) a Cox model
with a backward elimination and 2) a penalised Cox
regression with the Least Angle and Selection Operator (LASSO). Both models have been widely used for
variable selection. We aim to compare these more parsimonious models versus a Cox model with all variables in
terms of predictive performance. For the first, a numerically stable version of the backward elimination on factors
was applied using a method based on Lawless and Singhal (1978) [26]. This method estimates the full model
and computes approximate Wald statistics by computing conditional maximum likelihood estimates - assuming
multivariate normality of estimates. Factors that require
multiple degrees of freedom are dropped or retained as a
group.
The latter approach uses a combination of selection
and regularisation [27]. Denote the log-partial likelihood
by (β) = logL(β). The vector β is estimated via the
criterion:
βˆ = argmin[ (β)] , subject to 
p
j=1
|βj| ≤ s (3)
with s a user specified positive parameter.
Equation (3) can also be rewritten as
βˆ = argmin
β
⎛
⎝(β) + λLASSO
p
j=1
|βj|
⎞
⎠ . (4)
The quantity p
j=1 |βj| is also known as the L1-norm
and performs regularisation to the log-partial likelihood.
The term λLASSO is a non-negative constant that assigns
the amount of penalisation. Larger values for the parameter mean larger penalty to the βj coefficients and enlarged
shrinkage towards zero.
The tuning parameter s in Eq. (3) or equivalently parameter λLasso in Eq. (4) is the controlling mechanism for
the variance of the model. Higher values reduce further the variance but introduce at the same time more
bias (variance-bias trade off ). To find a suitable value
for this parameter 5-fold cross-validation was performed
to minimise the prediction error; here in terms of the
cross-validated log-partial likelihood (CVPL) [28]

Random forests for survival analysis
Random Survival Forests (RSFs) are an ensemble tree
method for survival analysis of right censored data [29]
adapted from random forests [30]. The main idea of random forests is to get a series of decision trees - which can
capture complex interactions but are notorious for their
high variance - and obtain a collection averaging their
characteristics. In this way weak learners (the individual
trees) are turned into strong learners (the ensemble) [31].
For RSFs, randomness is introduced in two ways: bootstrapping a number of patients at each tree B times and
selecting a subset of variables for growing each node. During growing each survival tree, a recursive application of
binary splitting is performed per region (called node) on
a specific predictor in such a way that survival difference between daughter nodes is maximised and difference
within them is minimised. Splitting is terminated when a
certain criterion is reached (these nodes are called terminal). The most commonly used splitting criteria are the
log-rank test by Segal [32] and the log-rank score test
by Hothorn and Lausen [33]. Each terminal node should
have at least a pre-specified number of unique events.
Combining information from the B trees, survival probabilities and ensemble cumulative hazard estimate can
be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen
methodology, respectively.
The fundamental principle behind each survival tree is
the conservation of events. It is used to define ensemble
mortality, a new type of predicted outcome for survival
data derived from the ensemble cumulative hazard function (comparable to the prognostic index based on the
Cox model). This principle asserts that the sum of estimated cumulative hazard estimate over time is equal
to the total number of deaths, therefore the total number of deaths is conserved within each terminal node
H [29]. RSFs can handle both data with large sample size and vast number of predictors. Moreover, they

Kantidakis et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2020) 20:277 Page 5 of 14
can reach remarkable stability combining the results of
many trees. However, combining an ensemble of trees
downgrades significantly the intuitive interpretation of a
single tree.
Survival neural networks
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a machine learning
method able to model non-linear relationships between
prognostic factors with great flexibility. These systems
are inspired from biological neural networks that aimed
at imitating the human brain activity [34]. A ANN has
a layered structure and is based on a collection of connected units called nodes or neurons which comprise a
layer. The input layer picks up the signals and passes
them through transformation functions to the next layer
which is called “hidden”. A network may have more than
one hidden layer that connects with the previous and
transmit signals towards the output layer. Connections
between artificial neurons are called edges. Artificial neurons and edges have a weight (connection strength) which
adjusts as learning proceeds. It increases or decreases
the strength of the signal of each connection according to its sign. For the purpose of training, a target is
defined, which is the observed outcome. The simplest
form of a NN is the single layer feed-forward perceptron with the input layer, one hidden layer and the output
layer [35].
The application of NNs has been extended to survival
analysis over the years [13]. Different approaches have
been considered; some model the survival probability S(t)
directly or the unconditional probability of death F(t)
whereas other approaches estimate the conditional hazard h(t) [10]. They can be distinguished according to the
method used to deal with the censoring mechanism. Some
networks have k output nodes [36] - where k denotes k
separate time intervals - while others have a single output
node.
In this research, the method of Biganzoli was applied,
which specifies a partial logistic feed-forward artificial
neural network (PLANN) with a single output node [9].
This method uses as inputs the prognostic factors and
the survival times to increase the predictive ability of the
model. Data have to be transformed into a longitudinal
format with the survival times being divided into a set
of k non-overlapping intervals (months or years) Ik =
(τk−1, τk], with 0 = τo < τ1 < ··· < τk a set of predefined time points. In this way, the time component of
survival data is taken into consideration. On the training
data, each individual is repeated for the number of intervals he/she was observed in the study and on the test data
for all time intervals. PLANN provides the discrete conditional probability of dying P 
T ∈ Ik | T > τk−1

using as
transformation function of both input and output layers
the logistic (sigmoid) function:
f (η) = 1
1 + e−η , (6)
where η = p
i=1 wiXi is the summed linear combination of the weights wi of input-hidden layer and the input
variables Xi (i = 1, 2, ··· , p).
The contribution to the log-likelihood for each individual is calculated all over the intervals one is at risk. The
output node is a large target vector with 0 if the event did
not occur and 1 if the event occurred in a specific time
interval. Therefore, such a network first estimates the hazard for each interval hk = P

τk−1 < T ≤ τk|T > τk−1

and then S(t) = 
k:tk≤t(1 − hk).
In this work, novel extensions in the specification of
the PLANN are tested. Two new transformation functions
were investigated for the input-hidden layer the rectified
linear unit (ReLU)
f (η) = η+ = max (0, η), (7)
which is the most used activation function for NNs and
the hyperbolic tangent (tanh)
f (η) = 1 − e−2η
1 + e−2η . (8)
These functions can be seen as different modulators of
the degree of non-linearity implied by the input and the
hidden layer.
The PLANN was expanded in 2 hidden layers with same
node size and identical activation functions for inputhidden 1 and hidden 1 - hidden 2 layers. The k nonoverlapping intervals of the survival times were treated as
k separate variables. In this way, the contribution of each
interval to the predictions of the model using the relative
importance method by Garson [37] and its extension for 2
hidden layers can be obtained (see “Interpretability of the
models” section below and Additional file 1).
Model training
The split sample approach was employed; data was split
randomly into two complementary parts, a training set
(2/3) and a test set (1/3) under the same event/censoring
proportions. To tune a model, 5-fold cross validation
was performed in the training set for the machine learning techniques (and for Cox LASSO). Training data was
divided into 5 folds. Each time 4 folds were used to train
a model and the remaining fold was used to validate its
performance and the procedure was repeated for all combination of folds. Tuning of the hyper-parameters was
done using grid search and performance of final models was assessed on the test set. Analyses were performed
in R programming language version 3.5.3 [22]. Package
of implementation for RSFs and NNs as well as technical
details regarding the choice of tuning parameters and the
cross-validation procedure for each method are provided
in Additional File 2.

Assessing predictive performance on test data
To assess the final predictive performance of the models
the concordance index, the Brier score, and the Integrated
Brier Score (IBS) were applied.
The most popular measure of model performance in a
survival context is the concordance index [38] which computes the proportion of pairs of observations for which
the survival times and model predictions order are concordant taking into account censoring. It takes values
typically in the range 0.5 - 1 with higher values denoting
higher ability of the model to discriminate and 0.5 indicating no discrimination. The C-index cannot be defined
for neural network models since it relies on the ordering of individuals according to prognosis and there is
no unique ordering between the subjects. At one year
individual i may have better survival probability than individual j, but this could be reversed for a different time
point.
The C-index provides a rank statistic between the
observations that is not time-dependent. Following van
Houwelingen and le Cessie [39] a time-dependent prediction error is defined as
Brier y, Sˆ (t0|x)

=

y − Sˆ (t0|x)
2
, (9)
where Sˆ(t0|x) is the model-based probabilistic prediction
for the survival of an individual beyond t0 given the predictor x, and y = 1{t > t0} is the actual observation
ignoring censoring. The expected value with respect to a
new observation Ynew under the true model S(t0|x) can be
written as:
E

Brier Ynew, Sˆ (t0|x)
 = S (t0|x) (1 − S (t0|x))
+

S (t0|x) − Sˆ (t0|x)
2
.
(10)
The Brier Score consists of two components: the “true
variation” S(t0|x)(1 − S(t0|x)) and the error due to the
model(S(t0|x)−Sˆ(t0|x))2. A perfect prediction is only possible if S(t0|x) = 0 or S(t0|x) = 1. In practice the two
components cannot be separated since the true S(t0|x) is
unknown.
To assess the performance of a prediction rule in actual
data, censored observations before time t0 must be considered. To calculate Brier Score when censored observations are present, Graf proposed the use of inverse
probability of censoring weighting [40]. Then an estimate
of the average prediction error of the prediction model
Sˆ(t|x) at time t = t0 is

(11)
In (11), 1
Cˆ (min(ti−,t0)|xi) is a weighting scheme known as
inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) and
Score is the Brier Score for the prediction model. It ranges
typically from 0 to 0.25 with a lower value meaning smaller
prediction error.
Brier score is calculated at different time-points. An
overall measure of prediction error is the Integrated Brier
Score (IBS) which can be used to summarise the prediction error over the whole range up to the time horizon
 thor
0 ErrScore(Sˆ, t0)dt0 (here thor = 10 years) [41]. IBS provides the cumulative prediction error up to thor at all
available times (t∗ = 1, 2, ··· , 10 years) and takes values
in the same range as the Brier score. In this study, we use
IBS as the main criterion to evaluate the predictive ability
of all models up to 10 years.
Interpretability of the models
Interpretation of models is of great importance for the
medical community. It is well known that Cox models offer a straightforward interpretation through hazard
ratios.
For neural networks with one hidden layer the connection weights algorithm by Garson [37] – later modified
by Goh [42] – can provide information about the mechanism of the weights. The idea behind this algorithm
is that inputs with larger connection weights produce
greater intensities of signal transfer. As a result, these
inputs will be more important for the model. Garson’s
algorithm can be used to determine relative importance
of each input variable, partitioning the weights in the network. Their absolute values are used to specify percentage
of importance. Note that the algorithm does not provide the direction of relationships, so it remains uncertain
whether the relative importance indicates a positive or a
negative effect. For details about the algorithm see [43].
During this work, the algorithm was extended for 2 hidden
layers to obtain the relative importance of each variable
(for the implementation see algorithm 1 in Additional
file 1).
Random survival forest relies on two methods which
can provide interpretability: variable importance (VIMP)
and minimal depth [44]. The former is associated with
the prediction error before and after the permutation of a

node of a tree. VIMP is more frequently reported than
minimal depth in the literature [45]. For both methods
interpretation is available only for variable entities and not
for each variable level.
Results
Administrative censoring was applied to the UNOS data
at 10 years. Median follow-up is equal to 5.36 years
(95% CI: 5.19 - 5.59 years) and it was estimated with
reverse Kaplan-Meier [46]. Clinical endpoint is overall
graft-survival (OGS). From the total number of patients,
69.1% was alive/censored and 30.9% experienced the event
of interest (graft-failure or death). 3 models were used
from the Cox family to predict survival outcome: a) a
model with all 97 prognostic factors, b) a model with
backward selection and c) a model based on the LASSO
method for variable selection. Furthermore, 3 machine
learning methods were employed: a) a random survival
forest, b) a NN with one hidden layer and c) a NN with
two hidden layers.
Comparisons between models
In this section a direct comparison of the 6 models is illustrated in terms of variable importance on the training set
and predictive performance on the test set. Specification
of the variables with dummy coding included 119 variable levels from the 97 potentially prognostic factors. For
NNs - to apply and extend the methodology of Biganzoli - follow-up time was divided into 10 time intervals
(0, 1] ,(1, 2] , ··· , (9, 10] denoting years since transplantation. For Cox models and RSF exact time points were
used.
Cox model assumes that each covariate has a multiplicative effect in the hazard function (which is constant
over time). Estimating a model with 97 prognostic factors leads inevitably to a violation of the proportional
hazards assumption for some covariates (17 out of 97
here). This means that hazard ratios for those risk factors are the mean effects on the outcome which is still
a valuable information for the clinicians. To consider
all possible non-linear effects on interactions leads to
a complex model where too many parameters need to
be estimated and the interpretability becomes very difficult. On the other hand, ML techniques do not make
any assumptions about the data structure and therefore
their performance is not affected by the violation of PH.
The backward and the LASSO methods selected 28 (out
of 97) and 45 predictors (out of 119 dummy coded),
respectively. Selection of a smaller set of variables by Cox
backward was expected, since it is a greedier (heuristic)
method than LASSO penalized regression. The 12 most
influential variables for the Cox model with all variables
were selected by both methods (see Table 2). 5 of these
variables: re-transplantation, donor type, log(Total cold
ischemic time), diabetes and pre-treatment status violated
the PH assumption.
5-fold cross-validation in the training data resulted in
the following optimal hyper-parameters combinations for
the machine learning techniques:
• For the Random Survival Forest nodesize = 50,
mtry = 12, nsplit = 5 and ntree = 300. Stratified
bootstrap sub-sampling of half the patients was used
per tree (due to the large training time required).
• For the neural network with 1 hidden layer
activation function = “sigmoid” (for the
input-hidden layer), node size = 85, dropout
rate = 0.2, learning rate = 0.2, momentum =
0.9 and weak class weight = 1.
• For the neural network with 2 hidden layers
activation function = “sigmoid” (for the
input-hidden 1 and the hidden 1-hidden 2 layers),
node size = 110, dropout rate = 0.1,
learning rate = 0.2, momentum = 0.9 and weak
class weight = 1.
Global performance measures
The global performance measures on test data are provided in Table 1. Examining the Integrated Brier Score
(IBS), the NNs with 1 and with 2 hidden layers have the
lowest (IBS = 0.180) followed by the RSF (IBS = 0.182).
Cox models have a comparable performance (IBS = 0.183).
Therefore, the predictive ability of Cox backward and Cox
LASSO is the same as the less parsimonious Cox model
with all variables in terms of IBS. The best model in terms
of C-index is the Random Survival Forest (0.622) while
the Cox models with all variables has slightly worse performance. C-index for Cox backward and Cox LASSO are
respectively 0.615 and 0.614.
Stability of the networks was investigated by rerunning the same models on the test data, and showed that
the NN with 1 hidden layer had stable predictive performance and variable importance. In contrast, the NN
with 2 hidden layers was quite unstable regarding variable

importance. This behavior might be related to the vast
amount of weights that had to be trained for this model
which can lead to overfitting (in total 26621 connection
weights were estimated for a sample size of 41530 patients
in long format; whereas for the NN with 1 hidden layer
11136 connection weights). For the RSF, model obtained
remarkable stability in terms of performance error after a
particular number of trees (ntree = 300 was selected).
Prediction error curves
Figure 1 shows the average prediction Brier error over
time for all models. Small differences can be observed
between Cox models and RSF. The NNs with 1 hidden and
with 2 hidden layers have almost identical evolution over
time achieving better performance than the Cox models
and the RSF.
Variable importance
In this section, the models are compared based on the
most prognostic variables identified from the set of 97
predictors - 52 donor and 45 recipient characteristics.
Hazard ratios of the 12 most prognostic variables for the
Cox models are shown in Table 2, based on the absolute
z-score values for the Cox model with all variables. The
strongest predictor is re-transplantation. Having been
transplanted before increases the hazard of graft-failure
or death by more than 55%. The other most detrimental
variables are donor age and donor type circulatory dead.
One unit increase for donor age rises the hazard by around
1% while having received the graft from a donor circulatory versus brain-dead increases the hazard by more than
29% for all models. The rest of the factors which have
an adverse effect are: cold ischemic time, diabetes, race,
life-support, recipient age, incidental tumour, spontaneous
hypertensive bleeding, serology status of HCV and intense
care unit before the operation.
In Table 3 the most prognostic factors for the machine
learning techniques are presented. The top predictors are
provided in terms of relative importance (Rel-Imp) for
the PLANN models and in terms of variable importance
(VIMP) for the RSF. For the NNs, the strongest predictor is re-transplantation (Rel-Imp 0.035 for 1 hidden and
0.028 for 2 hidden layers), which is the second strongest
for the RSF (VIMP 0.009). According to the tuned RSF, the
most prognostic factor for the overall graft-survival of the
patient is donor age (VIMP 0.010).
Other strong prognostic variables for the NN with 1 hidden layer are life support (Rel-Imp 0.025), intense care unit
before the operation (Rel-Imp 0.023) and donor type circulatory dead versus brain-dead (Rel-Imp 0.023). For the
NN with 2 hidden layers other very prognostic variables
are serology status for HCV (Rel-Imp 0.025), life support
(Rel-Imp 0.024) and donor age (Rel-Imp 0.023).
For the RSF life support (VIMP 0.007), serology status for
HCV (VIMP 0.007) and intense care unit before the operation (VIMP 0.006). Note that variable total cold ischemic
time which was identified as the 4th most prognostic for
the Cox model with all variables and the 10th most prognostic for random survival forest is not in the list of the 12
most prognostic for both NNs.
Individual predictions
In this section, the predicted survival probabilities are
compared for 3 new hypothetical patients and 3 patients
from the test data.
In Fig. 2a the patient with reference characteristics
shows the best survival. The highest probabilities are predicted by the RSF and the lowest by the Cox model. The

same pattern occurs for the patient that suffers from diabetes (orange lines). The patient with diabetes who has
been transplanted before has the worst survival predictions. In this case the NN predicts the highest survival
probabilities and the Cox model built using all the prognostic factors the lowest.

showed by the Cox model with all variables, the tuned

patient shows the lowest survival probabilities overall.
For the second patient the NN predicts the lowest survival probabilities over time and for the third the Cox

for the continuous and the mode value for categorical variables. The patient in the orange line has diabetes (the other covariates as in reference

In general, the random survival forest provides the most
optimistic survival probabilities whereas the most pessimistic survival probabilities are predicted by either the
Cox model or the NN (more often by the Cox model).
This may be related to the characteristics of the methods
as RSF relies on recursive binary partitioning of predictors, whereas Cox models imply linearity, and NNs fit
non-linear relationships.
Calibration
Here 4 methods are compared: Cox model with all
variables, RSF, PLANN 1 hidden and 2 hidden layers based
on the calibration on the test data. For each method,
the predicted survival probabilities at each year are estimated and the patient data are split into 10 equally
sized groups based on the deciles of the probabilities.
Then the survival probabilities along with their 95% con-

fidence intervals are calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
methodology [47].
In Fig. 3 the results are showed at 2 years since LT.
The Cox model with all variables and the PLANN with
1 hidden layer are both well calibrated. The RSF and the
PLANN with 2 hidden layers tend to overestimate the survival probabilities for the patients at higher risk. Survival
neural network with 1 hidden layer seems to be the most
reliable for predictions between the ML techniques. Calibration plots at 5 and 10 years can be found in Additional
file 3.
Discussion
With the rise of computational power and technology on
the 21st century, more and more data have been collected
in the medical field to identify trends and patterns which
will allow building better allocation systems for patients,
provide more accurate prognosis and diagnosis as well
as more accurate identification of risk factors. During
the past few years, machine learning (ML) has received
increased attention in the medical area. For instance, in
the area of LTs graft failure or primary non-function might
be predicted at decision time with ML methodology [48].
Briceño et al. created a NN process for donor-recipient
matching specifying a binary classification survival output (recipient or graft survival) to predict 3-month graft
mortality [49].
In this study statistical and ML models were estimated
for patients from the US post-transplantation. Random
survival forest performed better than Cox models with
respect to the C-index. This shows the ability of the model
to discriminate between low and high risk groups of
patients. The C-index was not estimated for NN because
a natural ordering of subjects is not feasible. Therefore,
the Brier score was measured each year for all methods.
The RSF showed similar results to the Cox models having slightly smaller total prediction error (in terms of IBS).
The NNs performed in general better than the Cox models or the RSF and had very similar performance over time.
RSF and survival NN are ML techniques which have a
different learning method and model non-linear relationships between variables automatically. Both methods may
be used in medical application but should be applied at
present as additional analysis for comparison.
Special emphasis was given on the interpretation of the
models. An indirect comparison was performed to examine which are the most prognostic variables for a Cox
model with all variables, a RSF and NNs. Results showed
that Cox model with all variables (via absolute z-score
values) and the NNs with one/two hidden layer(s) (via
relative importance) identified similar predictors. Both
methods identified re-transplantation as the strongest
predictor and donor age, diabetes, life support and race as
relatively strong predictors. According to RSF, the most
prognostic variables were donor age, re-transplantation,
life support and serology status of HCV. Aetiology and
last serum creatinine were selected as the 7th and the
8th most prognostic. This raises a known concern about
the RSF bias towards continuous variables and categorical
variables with multiple levels [50] (aetiology has 9 levels:
metabolic, acute, alcoholic, cholestatic, HBV, HCV, malignant, other cirrhosis, other unknown). As continuous and
multilevel variables incorporate larger amount of information than categorical, they tend to be favoured by the
splitting rule of the forest during binary partitioning. Such
bias was reflected in the variable importance results.
When comparing statistical models with machine learning techniques with respect to interpretability, Cox models offer a straightforward interpretation through the
hazard ratios. On the contrary, for both neural networks
and random survival forests the sign of the prediction
is not provided (if the effect is positive or negative).
Additionally, for NNs interpretation is possible for different variable levels (with the method of Garson and its

Network with 1 hidden layer, d Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Network with 2 hidden layers

extension), whereas for RSF only the total effect of a variable is shown. There is no common metric to directly
compare Cox models with ML techniques in terms of
interpretation. Future research in this direction is needed.
ML techniques are inherently based on mechanisms
introducing randomisation and therefore very small
changes are expected between different iterations of the
same algorithm. To evaluate stability of performance, ML
models were run several times under the same parametrisation. RSF were consistently stable after a certain number
of trees (300 were selected). This was not the case for
the NNs where instability is a common problem. It is
challenging to tune a NN due to many hyper-parameter
combinations available and the lack of a consistent global
performance measure for survival data. IBS was used to
tune the novel NNs, which may be the reason of instability for the NN with 2 hidden layers together with the
large number of weights. Note also that the NN with 1 hidden layer is well calibrated whereas the NN with 2 hidden
layers is less calibrated on the test data.
This is the first study where ML techniques are applied
to transplant data where a comparison with the traditional
Cox model was investigated. To construct the survival
NN, the original problem had to be converted into a
classification problem where exact survival times were
transformed into (maximum) 10 time intervals denoting
years since transplantation. On the other hand, for the
Cox models and the RSF exact time to event was used.
Recently, a new feed forward NN has been proposed for
omics data which calculates directly a proportional hazards model as part of the output node using exact time
information [51]. A survival NN with exact times may lead
to better predictive performance. For UNOS data, 69.1%
of the recipients were alive/censored and 30.9% had the
event of interest. Results above were based on these particular percentages for censoring and events (for the NNs
the percentages varied because of the reformulation of the
problem).
It might be useful to investigate how the number of
variables affects the performance of the models. Here 97
variables were pre-selected supported by clinical and statistical reasons (e.g. variables available before or during
LT). It might be interesting to repeat the analyses on a
smaller group of predictors, implementation time can be
drastically reduced as the calculation complexity depends
on sample size and predictors multiplicity. Alongside, predictive accuracy might be increased as some noisy factors
will be removed from the dataset increasing the signal of
potentially prognostic variables.
Both traditional Cox models and PLANNs allow for
the inclusion of time-dependent covariates. For PLANNs,
each patient is replicated multiple times during the transformation of exact times into a set of k non-overlapping
intervals in long format. Thus, different values of a covariate can be naturally incorporated to increase the predictive ability of the networks. It would be interesting to apply
and compare the predictive ability of time-dependent Cox
models and PLANNs to liver transplantation data including explanatory variables whose values change over time.
Such extension to more dynamic methods may increase
predictive performance and help in decision making.
Conclusions
There is an increased attention to ML techniques beyond
SM in the medical field with methods and applications
being more necessary than ever. Utilization of these algorithmic approaches can lead to pattern discovery in the
data promoting fast and accurate decision making. For
time-to-event data, more ML techniques may be applied
for prediction such as Support Vector Machines and
Bayesian Networks. Moreover, deep learning with NN is
gaining more and more attention and will likely be another
trend in the future for these complex data.
In this work two alternatives to the Cox model from
machine learning for medical data with large total sample size (62294 patients) and many predictors (97 in
total) were discussed. RSF showed better performance
than the Cox models with respect to C-index so it can
be a useful tool for prioritisation of particular high risk
patients. NNs showed better prediction performance in
terms of Integrated Brier score. However, both ML techniques required a non-trivial implementation time. Cox
models are preferable in terms of straightforward interpretation and fast implementation. Our study suggests
that some caution is required when ML methods are
applied to survival data. Both approaches can be used
for exploratory and analysis purposes as long as the
advantages and the disadvantages of the methods are
presented.
