Abstract
Excessive dietary fructose intake may have an important role in the current epidemics of fatty liver, obesity and diabetes as
its intake parallels the development of these syndromes and because it can induce features of metabolic syndrome. The
effects of fructose to induce fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, however, vary dramatically among
individuals. The first step in fructose metabolism is mediated by fructokinase (KHK), which phosphorylates fructose to
fructose-1-phosphate; intracellular uric acid is also generated as a consequence of the transient ATP depletion that occurs
during this reaction. Here we show in human hepatocytes that uric acid up-regulates KHK expression thus leading to the
amplification of the lipogenic effects of fructose. Inhibition of uric acid production markedly blocked fructose-induced
triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism whereby uric acid stimulates KHK expression
involves the activation of the transcription factor ChREBP, which, in turn, results in the transcriptional activation of KHK by
binding to a specific sequence within its promoter. Since subjects sensitive to fructose often develop phenotypes associated
with hyperuricemia, uric acid may be an underlying factor in sensitizing hepatocytes to fructose metabolism during the
development of fatty liver.

Introduction
Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) are increasing throughout the world [1,2]. The current
epidemics of these conditions have been linked to the increased
intake in the last decades of added sugars (primarily in the form of
sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, HFCS). A major component
of added sugars is fructose, which constitutes 50% of the content of
sucrose, and 55% of the most common form of HFCS. Fructose is
distinct from glucose in its ability to induce features of metabolic
syndrome (insulin resistance, fatty liver, dyslipidemia, and
intraabdominal fat accumulation) both in humans [3,4] and
laboratory animals [5]. Of interest, the mechanism whereby
fructose induces fatty liver appears to be independent of total
energy intake. However, one common finding in clinical studies is
that the effect of fructose to induce fatty liver and hypertriglyceridemia varies significantly between humans [6,7,8] while the
mechanism accounting for these differences in sensitivity to the
effects of fructose remains unknown.
One key difference between fructose and glucose is in the initial
metabolism. Fructose is metabolized in the liver by fructokinase
(ketohexokinase, KHK), which uses ATP to phosphorylate
fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Unlike hexokinases, which
phosphorylate glucose and have a negative feedback system to
prevent excessive phosphorylation, KHK phosphorylates fructose
as rapidly as it can, and this commonly leads to intracellular

phosphate depletion. Lower intracellular phosphate levels result in
the activation of AMP deaminase, which converts the AMP to
IMP, inosine, and eventually uric acid. Uric acid then rises inside
the cells and spills out into the circulation [9]. Thus, fructose is
distinct from glucose in its ability to cause intracellular phosphate
depletion, ATP depletion, and uric acid generation in the liver
[10,11]. Recently our group has shown that intracellular uric acid
can induce inflammatory effects and oxidative stress in vascular
cells and adipocytes [12,13,14].
Exposure to fructose is known to increase KHK expression in
hepatocytes of animals [15,16] and humans [17] thus sensitizing
the cells to its metabolic/lipogenic effects. In this manuscript, we
studied the mechanisms whereby fructose up-regulates KHK
expression in human hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that uric
acid stimulates the up-regulation of KHK in response to fructose
and that blockade of its production by inhibition of xanthine
oxidase results in lower KHK levels and amelioration of the
lipogenic effects of fructose. Conversely, fructose-induced lipogenesis was significantly increased in hepatocytes pre-exposed to uric
acid in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the observed
differences in responsiveness to fructose in humans could be
accounted in part to the role that uric acid plays on the expression
of KHK in hepatocytes.
Materials and Methods
Methods
See supplemental methods (Methods S1) for more details.
Ethics Statement
All Animal experiments were performed according to protocols
approved by the University of Colorado Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Cell Culture and Silencing
The established human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 was
maintained as described elsewhere. Expression of KHK in HepG2
cells was stably silenced. Briefly, lentiviral particles codifying for a
silencing sequence were obtained from Open Biosystems (KHK,
Hunsville, AL). HepG2 cells previously treated with polybrene
(10 mg/ml) were exposed to the lentiviral particles for 24 hours for
transduction. After exposure, medium was removed and cells were
incubated in normal media in the presence of puromycin (2 mg/
ml) to select transducted cells. Clones with greater than 90%
silencing as assessed by western blot analysis were selected from
colonies growing in plates from a 10-fold dilution series in media
prepared with 2 mg/ml puromycin antibiotic. In experiments
involving allopurinol, probenecid and C75 treatment, cells were
pre-incubated with these compounds for 8 hours prior exposure to
fructose or uric acid.
Rat Experiments
Adult male Sprague-Dawley breeder rats (Charles Rivers,
Wilmington,MA) were housed inthe animal facility atthe University
of Colorado. Rats were kept under temperature- and humiditycontrolled specific pathogen-free conditions and maintained on a 12
hourlight-dark cycle.Animals receivednormalchowcontaining 18%
protein and 6% fat (3.1 kcal/g of metabolizable energy) (2918,
Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI).The University of Colorado
Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental
protocols. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control
(n = 6), fructose 10% in drinking water (n = 6) and fructose 10% with
allopurinol (30 mg/kg) (n = 6). Rats received fructose for 10 days and
water and food consumption was closely monitored. At sacrifice,
serum and livers were collected. Liver was immediately processed for
oil red O and PAS staining and snap frozen for protein, uric acid and
triglyceride determination.
Immunoprecipitation of Acetylated ChREBP
Levels of acetylated ChREBP in HepG2 cells were determined
as described by Bricambert et al [18].
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay
HepG2 cells were resuspended in PBS to 106 cells/ml. DNA/
protein interaction was cross-linked at room temperature for
10 min with paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 1%.
The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of glycine,
and cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer containing:
5 mM PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl supplemented with 0.5%
Nonidet P-40, and mixture protease inhibitor (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN). The nuclear extract was pelleted by
microcentrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and genomic DNA
was precleared by addition of protein A/G-agarose slurry and
further centrifugation. ChrEBP-DNA complexes were pulled
down by overnight incubation at 4uC with an anti-ChREBP
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and further addition of
protein A/G-agarose slurry. Agarose beads were washed twice
with PBS supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, followed by four washes in buffer.
Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, and cross-linking
was reversed by overnight incubation at 67uC. Relative promoter
occupancy was analyzed by real time PCR employing the
following primers: Proximal ChoRE forward,
59TCTGCGTCGACCTGGTCATG-39 and reverse,
5TTCAGCCGACGTAGACACGT39, Distal ChoRE forward
59TGAGGGTGTCTGAACGGT3’ and reverse 59GAGCTGTTAAGGGCACCCAG39.
KHK Luciferase Assays and Site-directed Mutagenesis
The luciferase reporter constructs was engineered from the first
4 kb 59upstream of the first exon of human KHK by directional
cloning employing the following primers: forward 59CAGGCTAGCTCAATGACTCACTGAATGAG39 and reverse
59CAGCTCGAGTCCTCGATCGTTTAGTATGG39, which
was cloned between the NheI and XhoI sites (restriction sites in
the primers employed are shown underlined above) before the
luciferase cassette of the pGL3-Luc vector (Promega, Madison,
WI). This construct thus evaluated the importance of the ChoRE
sites in the KHK promoter region. Site-directed mutagenesis
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was employed following the manufacturer’s protocol to modify the ChoRE sites. For the distal site,
nucleotides CACGTG were substituted for TTCCCA while for
the proximal ChoRE site nucleotides CGCTGT were substituted
by TTCTCA. The primers employed were (substitution is shown
underlined): Distal ChoRE forward,

The luciferase activity was measured in HepG2 cells using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously [19]. Briefly, HepG2
cells in six-well plates grown to 80% confluence were transiently
transfected with each construct and a b-galactosidase reporter
(used for normalizing the transfection efficiency). Replicates were

incubated at normal conditions or with acute exposure to fructose
for 12 h. Cells were then lysed directly in luciferase reporter lysis
buffer (Promega). Supernatants from cell lysates were mixed with
luciferase substrate and measured immediately with a Luminoskan
Ascent DCReady luminometer (Labsystems). All transfection
experiments were performed in triplicate. Luciferase activity was
normalized to b-galactosidase expression as previously described.
Statistics and Data Analysis
All data are presented as the mean 6 standard error of the
mean (SEM). Data graphics and statistical analysis were performed
using Instat (version 3.0) and Prism 5 (both Graph Pad Software,
San Diego, CA). Data was analyzed for normality tests and using
one way ANOVA. Multiple group corrections were performed
using the method of Bartlett. In most cases experiments were
performed 3 times with independent replicates. Total data points
(n) are identified in figure legends. P values ,0.05 were recognized
as statistically significant.
Results
Fructose-induced Liver Steatosis is Ameliorated by
Lowering Intracellular Uric Acid
Fatty liver in adult male rats was induced with a 15% fructose
solution in drinking water for 10 days and compared to a group given
fructose plus allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, 30 mg/kg in
drinking water) and to control diet alone. Fructose intake was
equivalent in rats given fructose and allopurinol and rats given
fructose alone (Table S1). Liver uric acid levels were significantly
higher in fructose-fed rats compared to control rats with the lowest
levels in the allopurinol-treated group (Figure 1A). As a percentage
of total body weight, the livers of control, fructose and fructose plus
allopurinol rats were 4.5%, 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively (p,0.05;
Figure 1B). Fructose-fed rats developed fatty liver, with the
hepatocytes diffusely enlarged with clear, sharply bordered
cytoplasmic vacuoles (Figure 1D) when compared with control or
fructose plus allopurinol treated groups (Figure 1C and 1E). Oil red
O staining confirmed minimal lipid content in the control livers
(Figure 1F), while fructose-fed livers contained cytoplasmic vacuoles
that stained pink with lipids (Figure 1G). Livers from rats receiving
allopurinol with fructose showed minimal lipid staining (Figure 1H).
To determine which lipid fraction(s) were increased in the fructosefed livers and therefore blocked with allopurinol, TG and cholesterol
content of the liver extracts was measured using a colorimetric assay.
TG content was significantly increased in fructose-fed rats versus
control and fructose plus allopurinol fed rats (p,0.01, Figure 1I).
Cholesterol content was significantly increased in fructose-fed rats
and also reduced by allopurinol treatment (p,0.01, Figure 1J).
These data show that fructose-induced fatty liver is dependent on
xanthine oxidase.
Inhibition of Hepatic Uric Acid Production Prevents Liver
KHK Up-regulation in Response to Fructose
To understand the mechanism whereby uric acid production
mediates fructose-induced fatty liver, we next examined the
expression of KHK and aldolase (AldoB) the first two enzymes
involved in fructose metabolism. KHK phosphorylates fructose to

fructose-1-phosphate which is further converted to dyhydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde by AldoB. Hepatic KHK
and AldoB expression were increased 2.7-fold and 1.8-fold,
respectively, in fructose-fed rats compared to control rats
(Figures 2A–C, p,0.01), consistent with previous studies suggesting that fructose can up-regulate KHK [16]. While the expression
of AldoB was not different in fructose plus allopurinol treated rats
as compared to fructose-fed rats, fructose-induced up-regulation of
KHK was prevented by allopurinol indicating that uric acid may
regulate KHK expression in the liver. The changes in KHK
protein expression (Figures 2A–B) were also observed at the
mRNA level (Figure 2C) suggesting that the lack of KHK upregulation in fructose/allopurinol fed rats might be controlled at a
transcriptional level. These studies show that xanthine oxidase
regulates the up-regulation of KHK mRNA and protein in
response to fructose.
We next asked if lowering intrahepatic uric acid with allopurinol
affected the enzymes involved in hepatic lipid accumulation. Since
fructose metabolism is associated with increased de novo lipogenesis
and decreased fat oxidation, we examined the expression of
enzymes involved in both fat synthesis (fatty acid synthase (FAS),
ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)), as
well as fat oxidation (enoyl CoA hydratase-1 (ECH1)). As
compared to control rats, fructose slightly but significantly
stimulated the hepatic expression of FAS, ACL and ACC
(Figure 2D). However, little or no change in expression was
observed in fructose/allopurinol treated rats as compared to
fructose alone. In contrast, fructose-fed fats had a reduction in
hepatic ECH1 expression (53% reduction, p,0.05 versus control)
that was significantly prevented by allopurinol indicating that uric
acid may participate in the blockade of fat oxidation (Figure 2E).
Consistent with the changes in hepatic ECH1 expression, liver and
serum b-hydroxybutyrate levels, which are ketoacids generated
during fat oxidation, were significantly lower in fructose-fed rats
(60.5% and 64.5% reduction, respectively as compared to control)
but not in fructose/allopurinol fed rats (Figure 2G and 2H).
Consistent with lower hepatic KHK expression in fructose and
allopurinol fed rats, we found that serum fructose levels were

significantly higher in allopurinol fed rats, perhaps as a
consequence of lower fructose metabolism.
Uric Acid Up-regulates KHK Expression in Human
Hepatocytes Independently of Fructose
In order to better characterize the role of uric acid in the KHK
expression observed in the rats, we used a cell culture system in
which uric acid could be added in the absence of fructose. To this
end, we employed human hepatocytes (HepG2 cells), which in
contrast to rat hepatocytes, lack uricase. We exposed the cells to
increasing levels of uric acid, from 0 to 750 mmol/L (4–12 mg/dL)
that had previously tested negative for endotoxin and urate crystals
(polarized microscopy). As shown in Figure 3A–B, exposure of
cells to uric acid for 72 hours resulted in KHK up-regulation in a
dose-dependent manner that was significant even at 250 mmol/L
(41.2% increase at 250 mmol/L p,0.05 versus control, 48.6%
increase at 500 mmol/L p,0.01 versus control and 68.8%
increase at 750 mmol/L p,0.01 versus control). KHK upregulation by uric acid was blocked in the presence of the organic
anion transport inhibitor, probenecid (2 mmol/L), which mediates
soluble uric acid uptake indicating that uric acid transported inside
the cell is responsible for KHK up-regulation. Intracellular uric
acid levels are shown in Figure S1. Next, we examined the onset of
KHK up-regulation by uric acid (750 mmol/L). KHK protein
expression was increased by 35% 24 hours after uric acid exposure
(p,0.05) with a more robust increment at 48 and 72 hours
(Figure 3C–D). These studies show that uric acid regulates KHK
expression in HepG2 cells.
We next asked whether fructose-induced up-regulation of KHK
was mediated by uric acid. HepG2 cells were exposed to fructose
(5 mmol/L) for 72 hours in the presence or absence of allopurinol
(100 mmol/L) and KHK expression analyzed by western blot.
Intracellular uric acid levels are shown in Figure S1. As shown in
Figure 3E–F, KHK expression was significantly up-regulated by
fructose alone (p,0.01) but not in the presence of allopurinol
indicating that uric acid is responsible for fructose-induced KHK
up-regulation. Enzymatic activity of KHK was also lower in cells
treated with fructose plus allopurinol compared to fructose alone
(p,0.01, Figure 3G).

Fructose Stimulates the Transcriptional Activity of
ChREBP in the Human KHK Promoter in a Uric Aciddependent Manner
To determine how uric acid might regulate KHK expression,
we examined the transcription factor ChREBP which is known to
have KHK as one of its target genes [20]. ChREBP has also been
reported to stimulate lipogenesis in response to fructose [21,22].
Consistent with the data in Figure 2D, we found that KHK
mRNA expression was significantly increased by fructose in
human hepatocytes (Figure 4A). Next, we examined the role of
uric acid in the activation of ChREBP by fructose. Since ChREBP
is acetylated in the nucleus in order to be active, we immunoprecipitated ChREBP and determine its acetylation state in control
and cells exposed to high glucose (25 mmol/L, positive control)
and fructose in the presence or absence of allopurinol (Figure 4B).
As shown in the figure, glucose and fructose increased the
acetylation state of ChREBP and combination of both sugars did
not increase this further. In contrast, mannitol employed at the
same molarity as glucose (osmotic control) did not increase
ChREBP acetylation. Interestingly, ChREBP acetylation state was
significantly reduced not only in fructose- but also in glucoseexposed cells when allopurinol was present indicating that uric
acid mediates ChREBP activation. Consistent with increased
ChREBP acetylation, both glucose and fructose significantly
increased ChREBP nuclear expression (Figure 4C–E). The
nuclear localization of ChREBP was reduced by allopurinol
suggesting that uric acid acts by stimulating ChREBP nuclear
translocation in human hepatocytes rather than activating
ChREBP acetylation in the nucleus. Increased nuclear ChREBP
expression was paralleled by an up-regulation of KHK in the
cytoplasmic fraction. However, we could not observe decreased
ChREBP expression in the cytoplasm possibly because ChREBP
may be activating its own transcription [20].
To determine whether ChREBP activates the transcription of
KHK in response to fructose, we transducted hepatocytes with
adenoviral particles containing a dominant negative ChREBP
(dnMLX). Efficacy of the dominant negative in HepG2 cells was
confirmed by exposing the cells to high glucose medium and
determining the mRNA expression of well established ChREBP
target genes (Figure S2). The up-regulation of KHK mRNA
expression in response to fructose was blocked in the presence of
dnMLX; indeed, the mRNA levels were significantly lower than
cells transducted with control adenoviral particles (53.4% reduction, p,0.05) indicating that ChREBP might control basal
expression of KHK (Figure 5A). Consistent with lower KHK

expression, KHK activity was also significantly reduced in
dnMLX transducted cells (Figure 5B).
Next, we identified two consensus sites within the human KHK
promoter –named proximal and distal ChoREs- that resemble the
idealistic ChREBP consensus sites consisting of two Ebox
sequences separated by five nucleotides (Figure S2B). Human
distal ChoRE was found at 2.9 kb upstream of the first exon of
human KHK and the sequence is conserved between multiple
species. On the other hand, proximal ChoRE, identified at 700 bp
upstream of the first exon, was not totally conserved with
approximately 30% mismatches between species. In order to
determine if ChREBP binds to KHK ChoREs in the presence of
fructose, we analyzed ChREBP promoter occupancy using
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by real time PCR
employing primers flanking the specific Ebox sites. As shown in
Figure 5C, the ChREBP promoter occupancy in the proximal and
distal ChoREs was significantly higher in hepatocytes exposed to
fructose than in control cells (4.43- and 8.03-fold increase,
respectively, p,0.001). Since the over-expression of the dnMLX
impairs the DNA binding of ChREBP, we did not observe a
significant ChREBP promoter occupancy in the presence of
dnMLX in either control (not shown) or fructose-exposed cells. We
also did not observe a significant increase in ChREBP promoter
occupancy in cells exposed to fructose plus allopurinol, possibly
due to reduced ChREBP nuclear expression as previously shown
in Figure 4C.
To better characterize the role of KHK ChoREs sites in
ChREBP-induced KHK transcriptional activation, we cloned the
human KHK promoter upstream a luciferase cassette inserted into
the pGL3 vector and both ChoRES were then mutated. Since
HepG2 cells are difficult to transfect with nude plasmids, we
analyzed transfection efficiency in the cells by co-transfecting a bgalactosidase construct and normalizing luciferase signal to bgalactosidase expression. Luciferase expression in fructose exposed
cells was significantly higher than control and dnMLX expressing
cells (p,0.05, Figure 5D) indicating that this construct positively
reacted to fructose in the medium and that ChREBP plays a key
role in KHK transcription. We also found a slight but significant
increase in luciferase expression in fructose and dnMLX exposed
cells compared to control cells (87% increase, p,0.05) indicating

that other transcription factors besides ChREBP may be involved
in KHK transcriptional activation by fructose. When the role of
each specific ChoREs was analyzed we found that mutation of a
single ChoRE was enough to significantly reduce fructose-induced
luciferase expression (p,0.01, Figure 5E). Mutation of both sites
led to a more prominent reduction (86.8% reduction, p,0.001).
These studies document that fructose induced up-regulation of
KHK mRNA in HepG2 cells is mediated by uric acid stimulation
of ChREBP.
After determining that fructose stimulates ChREBP and that the
stimulation could be prevented with allopurinol in human
hepatocytes, we characterized ChREBP in the livers of fructose
and fructose/allopurinol-fed rats. Expression of total ChREBP
(cytosolic and nuclear) was significantly higher in fructose-fed rats
compared to control and fructose/allopurinol fed rats (1.9- and
1.1-fold increase, p,0.01 and p,0.05 respectively, Figure 6A–B).
As previously determined in HepG2 cells, allopurinol prevented
nuclear expression of ChREBP in fructose fed rats with a parallel
decrease in cytosolic KHK expression indicating that uric acid upregulates hepatic KHK in vivo possibly by enhancing ChREBP
nuclear translocation (Figure 6C–D).
Uric Acid Sensitizes Human Hepatocytes to Fructose by
Up-regulating KHK Expression
To analyze the importance of the relative expression of KHK in
fructose-induced lipogenesis, we evaluated the response to fixed
amounts of fructose of HepG2 cells control or cells that
overexpressed KHK. As shown in Figure S3, overexpression of
KHK resulted in significantly increased TG accumulation for the
same amount of fructose compared to control cells, indicating that
KHK expression determines the overall response of hepatocytes to
fructose. After determining the importance of KHK levels in
fructose metabolism, we studied if uric acid could potentiate the
lipogenic effects of fructose by up-regulating KHK expression.
HepG2 cells were preincubated with increasing amounts of uric
acid (from 0 to 750 mmol/L) for 72 hours and afterwards exposed
to fructose (5 mmol/L) for 24 hours. As previously shown
(Figure 3A–B), KHK expression was significantly up-regulated
by uric acid in a dose-response manner (Figure 7A–B). Further
exposure of fructose for 24 hours resulted in no significant increase
in KHK expression as compared to uric acid. While fructose
significantly increased TG accumulation in control cells not
previously exposed to uric acid (30.3% increase, p,0.05),
intracellular TG levels were markedly increased when cells were
pre-incubated with uric acid in a dose response manner (55.3% for
uric acid 250 mmol/L, p,0.05 versus control and non significant
versus fructose alone, 71.4% for uric acid 500 mmol/L, p,0.01
versus control and p,0.05 versus fructose alone, and 122.2% for
uric acid 750 mmol/L, p,0.001 versus control and p,0.01 versus
fructose alone) indicating that uric acid sensitizes hepatocytes to
fructose metabolism (Figure 7C). Furthermore, we reversed
allopurinol blockade of fructose-induced TG accumulation by
adding back uric acid to the cells indicating that the mechanism
whereby allopurinol blocks lipogenesis is by reducing intracellular
uric acid levels (Figure 7D).
The mechanism whereby fructose induces fat accumulation is
thought to be induced by activating de novo lipogenesis. This
activation is mediated by the ability of fructose to be metabolized
to Acetyl-CoA and glyceraldehyde, the substrates for fatty acid
synthase (FAS). In this regard, we have confirmed that blocking
FAS activity with the FAS inhibitor, C75 (10 mmol/L), blocks
fructose-induced TG accumulation thus validating the lipogenic

effects of fructose (Figure S4A). Consistent with a blockade of FAS
activity, intracellular acetyl-CoA levels were increased in C75 and
fructose-exposed cells (Figure S4B). To determine if the mechanism whereby allopurinol blocks fructose-induced TG accumulation was associated with decreased de novo lipogenesis, we
analyzed intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA in C75 treated cells (to
prevent Acetyl-CoA metabolism) exposed to fructose alone or in
the presence of allopurinol. As shown in Figure S4C, allopurinol
significantly reduced acetyl-CoA accumulation in fructose-exposed
cells thus confirming that the major mechanism whereby uric acid
potentiates fructose response is by increasing acetyl-CoA levels and
de novo lipogenesis rates.
Discussion
The novel finding in this study relate to the discovery for a
causal role for uric acid in fructose-induced fat accumulation in the
liver. It is known that animals fed fructose show an increased
expression of both the fructose transporter, Glut 5, and of
fructokinase (KHK) [16]. Here we show that KHK up-regulation
by fructose is mediated by the intracellular production of uric acid.
Incubation of human hepatocytes with uric acid resulted in KHK
protein over-expression in a dose dependent manner which was
prevented by addition of the organic anion transport inhibitor,
probenecid. Furthermore, we found that KHK is a target gene of
the transcription factor associated with carbohydrate metabolism,
ChREBP, and that allopurinol could block ChREBP nuclear
translocation and activation.
There is increasing evidence that uric acid has a role in hepatic
steatosis. First, an elevated serum uric acid is commonly elevated
in subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease both in crosssectional and longitudinal studies [14,23–26]. An elevated uric
acid also correlated with histological liver damage in subjects with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [27]. Studies by Ouyang et al have
also linked the hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis with increased
fructose consumption from soft drinks in association with increased
fructokinase expression in the liver [17]. Furthermore, subjects
with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who have a history of greater
fructose exposure, or who have higher elevated serum uric acid,
show a greater hepatic ATP depletion in response to fructose than
those with lower baseline uric acid levels [28]. Finally, a single
report by Xu et al found that lowering uric acid with allopurinol
could reduce hepatic steatosis in the desert sand rat [29]. These
studies are consistent with uric acid having a contributory role in
hepatic steatosis by up-regulating fructokinase expression and
fructose metabolism.
These studies could potentially explain why subjects with
hyperinsulinemia show an enhanced metabolic response to
fructose [30–33]. Insulin resistance is strongly associated with
hyperuricemia [34]. It also may explain why male subjects are
typically more sensitive to the effects of fructose than female
subjects [35], as males have higher uric acid levels. It also provides
a mechanism for why lowering uric acid has been found to block
fructose-induced metabolic syndrome in rats [5].
One interesting finding was that allopurinol was able to block
both fructose and glucose stimulation of ChREBP. Recently we
have found that glucose can be converted to fructose inside cells
via the polyol pathway, an accessory route consisting of two
enzymes, aldose reductase which converts glucose to sorbitol and
sorbitol dehydrogenase that metabolizes it to fructose [36]. It is

possible that the mechanism by which allopurinol protected
against glucose-induced ChREBP activation could involve the
intracellular generation of fructose with its subsequent metabolism
and generation of uric acid as a byproduct. The mechanism
whereby allopurinol blocks ChREBP nuclear translocation
remains unknown. We speculate this could be mediated by the
inactivation of AMP kinase, a known inhibitor of ChREBP activity
[37,38]. In this regard, we have recently shown that uric acid
down-regulates AMPK activation, as determined by its phosphorylation at threonine 172, in fructose-exposed human hepatocytes
(M Lanaspa, data unpublished).
It is recognized that serum uric acid can be modulated by a
variety of means, including diet, renal function, and even insulin
resistance itself [39,40]. The commonly observed elevations of uric
acid in a wide variety of conditions, such as obesity, metabolic
syndrome, hypertension and kidney disease has made it difficult
epidemiologically to understand its relative importance. More
recently, however, it has become evident that soluble uric acid is
biologically active and can stimulate the production of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators [41,42,43]. This study provides the
first evidence that uric acid can directly regulate fructose
metabolism.
The observation that uric acid can amplify the lipogenic effects
of fructose may also be of relevance to primate evolution. Indeed,
it is known that the mutation of uricase, an enzyme that converts
uric acid to allantoin, occurred during the mid Miocene at a time
when the hominoids in Europe were faced with food shortage due
to reduced availability of fruit during the cooler seasonal periods
[44]. We have postulated that this mutation may have provided a
natural selection advantage by amplifying the ability of fructose to
increase fat stores [44]. Since most mammals posses an active
uricase enzyme, it could be argued from the results derived of this
manuscript that these animals may be protected from fructose
effects. However, we found that fructose significantly reduced
uricase activity in the liver (Figure S5). We do not know how
uricase activity is down-regulated by fructose but since allopurinoltreated rats have normal uricase activity we believe that uric acid
itself or rather a metabolite of uric acid degradation by uricase
(i.e.: allantoin) may have a negative effect on uricase activity in
mammals.
In conclusion, the present study shows that the metabolism of
fructose by fructokinase results in the intracellular production of
uric acid that feeds back to up-regulate fructokinase and increase
the sensitivity of the cell to the triglyceride-raising effects of
fructose. Of interest, the blockade of intracellular uric acid with
allopurinol could inhibit the effect of fructose to increase fat
accumulation. The significant reduction in fat accumulation raises
the possibility that uric acid may have additional mechanisms
whereby it may control fat accumulation. Studies are ongoing in
our laboratory to identify potential mechanisms.
