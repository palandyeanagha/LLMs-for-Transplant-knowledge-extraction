Large animal models have long served as the proving grounds for advances in transplantation,
bridging the gap between inbred mouse experimentation and human clinical trials. Although
a variety of species have been and continue to be used, the emergence of highly targeted
biologic- and antibody-based therapies has required models to have a high degree of homology with humans. Thus, the nonhuman primate has become the model of choice in many
settings. This article will provide an overview of nonhuman primate models of transplantation. Issues of primate genetics and care will be introduced, and a brief overview of technical
aspects for various transplant models will be discussed. Finally, several prominent immunosuppressive and tolerance strategies used in primates will be reviewed.
Animal experimentation has long provided
a rational basis for the translation of treatments and techniques from the bench to the
bedside. In general, all first-in-human trials require preparative animal experimentation to allow patients to make truly informed decisions
about their participation. Properly designed animal studies in relevant species provide the necessary background experience with a novel approach to reasonably anticipate the efficacy or,
at the very least, safety of a planned intervention.
As such, they serve as a foundation on which
human trials can be ethically designed, particularly in fields such as immunology, in which the
complexity of the interactions involved has prevented the development of any sufficiently predictive in vitro model. Although animal models
are far superior to in vitro models in projecting
the potential of an approach, it must be recognized that they do not mimic clinical transplantation precisely, and thus cannot be expected to
forecast the ultimate experience in humans.
The mouse model has formed the backbone
of medical research and development for many
years owing to the relative ease of breeding and
genetic manipulation of the animals at a comparatively low cost. For immunology research,
the mouse immune system offers sufficient homology for pathway determination and mechanistic studies, and indeed represents the ideal
platform for this type of endeavor. In contrast,
the large animal models (dog, pig, and primate)
are significantly more expensive and, with the
exception of inbred miniature swine (Sachs
1992; Mezrich et al. 2003), exhibit increased genetic diversity, making definitive mechanistic
studies much more difficult, if not impossible.
However, this complexity makes large animals
suited to preclinical studies, in which the addition of often-unanticipated variables allows for
the examination of practicality, safety, and generalized efficacy. In general, mice define pathways, and large animal models help establish
whether a particular pathway’s effect is suffiEditors: Laurence A. Turka and Kathryn J. Wood

ciently robust to emerge as dominant in the
midst of the numerous uncontrolled variables
typical of heterogeneous human populations.
In specific regard to transplantation immunology, mice have several potential drawbacks.
Laboratorymice bredin clean environments and
studied between 4 and 8 weeks old have a largely
naı¨ve immune system (Blattman et al. 2002), a
fact likely responsible for the success of therapies, including methods of tolerance induction,
inmice, and their subsequentfailurewhen translated to large animals (Kirk 2003; Sachs 2003), or
mice exposed to pathogens (Adams et al. 2003).
Additionally, mice do not constitutively express
class II antigens on vascular endothelium, unlike
other large animal models, which may explain
the importance of class II matching in the large
animals models (Pescovitz et al. 1984; Choo et al.
1997). Furthermore, the efficacy of any regimen
may also be dependent on the strain of mice used
(Williams et al. 2000). The relative genetic diversity and immunologic experience of large animals helps to avoid many of these shortcomings,
and, indeed, experimentation in a large animal
model, most frequently primates (for reasons
discussed below), has become a de facto requirement before initiation of human trials in transplantation (Sachs 2003; ’t Hart et al. 2004).
The complexities of the immune response
often cause therapies to fail in transition to large
animals, or to humans. This is most often owing
to one or a few critical differences between species rather than a failure of the concept. Interspecies differences in drug pharmacokinetics
may lead to apparent failure of a regimen that
may have been successful if adjustments for distribution or metabolism had been considered.
Furthermore, modern biologic and antibodybased therapies may be profoundly altered by
minor differences in molecular structure of the
target molecule. The immunologic diversity of
large animals can lead to significant differences
in outcome via heterologous immune interactions, an experimental parameter that is challenging to quantify and control for. Finally, the
practicalities of animal husbandry during treatment can only approximate the care human patients receive. Indwelling catheters and wound
care in surgical models are often difficult. Monitoring and vascular access is challenging in
conscious animal models, often limiting the options for drug delivery and dosing schedules.
Another potential issue with large animal
models is that of time, both in terms of the
animal’s age and survival of grafts. For practical reasons, adolescent animals are often used,
and evidence suggests that these young animals,
like young humans, have a predominately naı¨ve
immune system that will mature toward a memory phenotype as the animal ages (Nan et al.
1998a,b; Rodriquez-Carreno et al. 2002; Saalmu¨ller et al. 2002). With regard to graft survival
in animals, convention has established 100 days
as indicative of acceptance in mouse models,
whereas in larger animals, several years has
been the norm. However, although this is practical in terms of the shorter life span and cost of
maintaining the animals, no data support that
graft survival should be interpreted proportionally to lifespan. Thus, data from these studies
should be interpreted for what it is, and not extrapolated to indicate longer survival in longerlived animals (Kirk 2003).
A full review of the ethical principles surrounding animal experimentation is beyond the
scope of this article. However, it is worth noting
that no animal experiment can be ethical unless
it has a reasonable chance of answering a worthwhile question. Specific guidance for ethical
treatment of animal subjects can be found in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (National Research Council 2011) and
in the publications of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care (www.aaalac.
org/resources). In general, all animal experiments should embrace the principles of reduction, replacement, and refinement. Animal
models should be reserved for when no reasonable alternative exists, and any procedure
should be maximally refined for the benefit of
the animal’s welfare. Any experiment should be
designed to minimize the number of animals
used without endangering the ability of the experiment to answer the question at hand. An
experiment that fails to answer the question
posed using fewer animals is less ethical than
an experiment that succeeds using more animals, and is virtually useless.

The choice of large animal model can often
be daunting. Dogs, pigs, and nonhuman primates have all been used extensively in transplantation research, and each has sufficient anatomic and physiologic similarity to humans to
be useful. In this article we will focus on primates, as that model has become the predominant model used owing to the need for highly
conserved targets when testing biologic and antibody-based therapies. However, primates are
not a model of convenience, and should be considered only when a therapy is being anticipated
for translation to humans, and data are required
to facilitate this transition in a safe and ethically
viable fashion.
PRIMATE MODELS OF TRANSPLANTATION
Primate studies in transplantation have used a
varietyof species, including baboons, macaques,
and, rarely, chimpanzees. Chimpanzees offer the
highest degree of homology with humans, even
serving (historically) as graft donors for humans
(Reemtsma 1969); however, their endangered
status and evolutionary stature have raised questions regarding the ethics of their use and led
to increased restrictions, rendering them a historical model only. Indeed, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now eliminated the
chimpanzee as a funded model. Baboons have
commonly been used in xenotransplantation
studies, as their relatively large size better accommodates the porcine organs. Macaques
(cynomolgus, rhesus, and pigtail) are the most
widely used of the nonhuman primates (NHPs)
owing to their small size, defined major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and relative
ease of care. Macaques are sufficiently homologous with humans such that most molecular
targets will cross-react, with the notable exception of CD3. The remainder of this article will
focus predominantly on the rhesus macaque.
Numerous applications are described to provide
the reader with a general knowledge of the procedures performed using NHPs. For specific
methodological detail, the reader is referred to
the primary literature (Kirk et al. 1997; Pierson
et al. 1999; Hausen et al. 2000a; Elster et al.
2001a; Adams et al. 2002; Cendales et al. 2005).
Genetics in Primate Transplantation
In human studies of transplantation, the MHC
matching of donor– recipient pairs is often
known. Although the effect of MHC disparity
on outcome varies by organ, generally, bettermatched pairs have better results. The same can
be said of primates; however, until recently,
MHC typing of primates was difficult, based
on incomplete mapping of the region, and frequently omitted. Although NHPs cannot be
readily inbred to the same extent as mice, or
even dogs or pigs, they are not truly outbred
either. Most monkeys used in research are from
dedicated colonies with limited interbreeding.
The genetic disparity of potential transplant
pairs was established using relatively limited
techniques, usually mixed lymphocyte reactions and analysis of the DR region. Failure to
adequately control for this experimental variable introduces a significant confounding factor
in the interpretation of results.
Recent studies of the rhesus macaque paired
with technological advances have begun to allow for easier assessment of MHC matching.
The rhesus MHC is located on chromosome 4
and, owing to significant duplication of class I A
and B genes (known as mamu-A and mamu-B)
and, to a lesser extent, class II duplication, is
significantly larger than the human MHC. Owing to the duplication of these genes, individual
animals express up to four mamu-A genes and
14 mamu-B genes per chromosome (Kean et al.
2012). Furthermore, these genes are expressed
in a hierarchical pattern rather than the codominant expression seen in humans (Otting
et al. 2005). The combination of these two facts
makes the rhesus MHC extremely complex,
particularly for heterozygotes, and renders allele-specific DNA-based typing ineffective at
predicting the expression of MHC molecules.
Recently, several DNA microsatellite probes
were identified that allowed for the determination of autosomal and sex chromosome inheritance between generations of macaques. This
allowed for accurate pedigrees to be developed
of rhesus breeding groups and determination of
inheritance of complete MHC haplotypes (Andrade et al. 2004; Penedo et al. 2005). The dePrimate Models in Organ Transplantation

velopment of massively parallel pyrosequencing
allowed for comprehensive analysis of MHC expression (Wiseman et al. 2009) and confirmed
the extreme complexity of the rhesus MHC.
Pyrosequencing can be used to determine the
complete MHC type for any individual animal.
By combining these two technologies, investigators can design experiments with knowledge
of the MHC disparity between potential transplant pairs, greatly increasing the validity of the
results. To do so, however, requires substantial
coordination with the primate breeding facility,
and advanced planning to achieve the desired
degree of match or mismatch while still minimizing the number of animals used.
Perioperative Care
The perioperative and follow-up care of NHPs
can only approximate what is available for humans. Routine care and treatment of any complications should be performed in consultation
with veterinary staff and be anticipated within
the animal use protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). The animal’s clinical status should
be monitored frequently, as changes in activity
or appetite are often early signs of rejection,
infection, or technical complications. Animals
receiving nephrotoxic immunosuppression or
those that receive renal grafts should be monitoredfor urine output. Laboratory values should
be checked routinely postoperatively and with
any clinical changes. Medications can be delivered by a number of routes; however, care should
be taken when planning experiments to avoid
overly frequent sedation for intravenous infusions. Medications requiring daily dosing
should be given by mouth or by subcutaneous
or intramuscular injection, if possible, unless
specialized cages allowing for indwelling catheters in conscious animals are available. Anorexic
or malnourished animals can receive supplemental nutrition via orogastric tubewhile sedated, and should be referred to veterinary staff
for dietary modifications. Clinical medications
analogous to the standard medications used for
human transplantation, such as antibiotics or
analgesics, are generally available through veterinary protocols, and althoughmany require dose
adjustments, most human agents work well in
rhesus macaques. Finally, animals receiving immunosuppression should be monitored for
the development of infections, and prophylaxis
can be considered. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based assays for rhesus macaque homologs of CMV and EBV, rhCMV (Yue and Barry
2008) and LCV (Rao et al. 2000; Rivailler et al.
2004), respectively, are available for monitoring.
Regular monitoring of transplanted animals can
provide insight into the extent of immunosuppression, and perhaps, indicate when a regimen
may excessively compromise protective immunity (Lo et al. 2013; Lowe et al. 2013).
Renal Transplantation
Renal transplantation in primates mimics the
intra-abdominal procedure used in small children. Following systemic heparinization of both
the donor and recipient, the donor organ is excised and the vessels are anastamosed to the recipient’s infrarenal aorta and vena cava (Fig. 1).
Typically thisis performedin aleft-to-rightfashion owing to the longer length of the left renal
vessels. The donor ureteris tunneled through the
retroperitoneum and a primary ureteroneocystostomy is formed, typically on the posterior
wall of the bladder using a modified Leadbetter-Politano approach (Politano and Leadbetter
1958; Kayler et al. 2010). The recipient’s native
kidney(s) are removed following implantation
(Kirk et al. 1997; Knechtle et al. 1997). When
possible, the animals may be paired in a domino
fashion, allowing each individual to act as a donor and recipient, reducing the number of animals needed and preventing the need for a simultaneous bilateral retroperitoneal dissection
and native nephrectomy, which is particularly
stressful for the animals. In general, renal transplantation is well tolerated by the animals and
complications are limited, with most issues related to the ureter (Song et al. 2010).
Skin Transplantation
Like renal transplantation, skin transplantation
in primates is relatively straightforward, and

offers a rigorous model in which to test immunosuppressive or tolerance strategies (Elster et
al. 2001b). Donor grafts are typically taken from
the abdominal wall and implanted on the back
of the recipient to reduce the likelihood of the
animal picking at the graft. It is important to
remove cutaneous fat from the skin graft before
transplantation, and similarly important not to
remove subcutaneous tissue and microvasculature from the recipient site. To further protect
the grafts during healing, soft bolsters should
be used to hold the graft against the underlying
tissue (Fig. 2). These can be removed after approximately 1 week. The animals also need to
wear protective jackets to protect the grafts and
bandages from damage during grooming. The
animals generally need to acclimatize to wearing
the jacket for a period of time preoperatively,
and this may take several weeks before the primate is comfortable with the jacket.
Islet Transplantation
Nonhuman primates have been used extensively in the study of pancreatic islet transplantation. Following a period of training the animals
for frequent glucose monitoring, the animals
can be rendered diabetic by pancreatectomy or
injection of streptozotocin, and diabetes is confirmed by the absence of native c-peptide proAutograft

duction. Islet cells from the donor pancreas are
isolated in the same manner in which human
islets are isolated and then infused into the portal circulation by gravity (Adams et al. 2002;
Badell et al. 2012a), although other sites for islet
implantation are being investigated (Cantarelli
and Piemonti 2011). Daily fasting and postprandial blood sugars can be easily monitored
postoperatively to assess engraftment and survival of the islet cells. Histological implantation,
rejection, and function all closely approximate
human islet transplantation.
Heart and Lung Transplantation
The use of NHPs in studies of allogenic heart
and lung transplantation is less common; however, examples do exist of their use (Hausen et al.
2000a,b; Azimzadeh et al. 2006). More frequently, primates are used as recipients of heart or lung
grafts in studies of xenotransplantation, which
will be discussed briefly below and more extensively in other portions of this text. Heart transplantation in primates is typically performed in
a heterotopic fashion with the graft placed in the
abdominal cavity (Pierson et al. 1999). The graft
can then be followed by palpation, ultrasound,
or even implanted EKG electrodes (Li et al.
2011). Larger NHPs, such as the baboon, or
the cynomolgus macaque are often used in these
procedures for technical reasons.
Vascularized Composite Allografts
Advances in immunosuppression and microsurgical technique has allowedfor the transplantation of multiple tissues as a functional unit,
such as hand and face transplantation. Multiple
primate models of these vascularized composite
allografts have been developed. Models involving either a portion of or whole hand transplantation in primates (Stark et al. 1987; Hovius et al.
1992) potentially negatively affect the function
of the surviving recipient. Cendales et al. (2005)
developed a model inwhich only a small portion
of the radial forearm is transplanted, allowing
for preserved function in both the donor and
recipient (Fig. 3). A heterotopic model of facial
transplantation has also been developed by a
group at the University of Maryland involving
part of the mandible, overlying soft tissue, skin,
and vasculature (Silverman et al. 2008; Barth
et al. 2009).
Xenotransplantation
Xenotransplantation is coveredmore extensively
in another article in this collection, so we will
mention it here only briefly. Studies of xenotransplantation in primates frequently use swine
as the organ donor, owing to the ease of breeding
and genetic manipulation, such as knockouts of
the Gal antigen (Lai et al. 2002; Phelps et al.
2003; Kolber-Simonds et al. 2004; Nottle et al.
2007). Baboons are typically usedfor solid organ
xenotransplant experiments, as their larger size
better accommodates the porcine organs. Macaques are often used as recipients of xenoislet
transplants. When planning these experiments,
it is worth noting that cynomolgus macaques
have lower resting blood glucose levels than humans (Casu et al. 2008). Although choosing an
ideal donor age has provided some controversy
in these experiments, both adult and neonatal
islets have been successfully transplanted (Cardona et al. 2006, 2007; Hering and Walawalkar
2009; Thompson et al. 2011).
STANDARD IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
Virtually all clinically used standard immunosuppressants have been found to be successful
in prolonging graft survival in primate models,
particularly when adjustments for distribution
and metabolism have been considered. To focus
on the relatively newer immunosuppressants
and biologic therapies, we will mention the conventional immunosuppressants, which have been
reviewed extensively elsewhere (Kirk 2003), only
briefly.
Both azathioprine and mycophenolate have
been successfully used in primate models of
transplantation, as have calcineurin inhibitors.
The development of tacrolimus is worth particular mention, as it was tested in a canine model
first with promising results but significant toxicity. Only after follow-up studies in primates
that showed its safety was the drug translated

to human use (Todo et al. 1988). A cyclosporinebased regimen has even been shown to induce
tolerance in a partially MHC-matched rhesus
model (Jonker et al. 1998). Given their success
and almost universal use in human transplantation, the calcineurin inhibitors remain a frequently studied class of immunosuppressants,
either in combination with new agents or as a
control against which the new agent is tested.
They are dosed at somewhat higher levels compared with humans dosing to achieve therapeutic targets. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus has

been frequently studied in primate models and
been found to prolong graft survival alone
(Weaver et al. 2009; Lo et al. 2013) or in combination with tacrolimus (Chen et al. 2000).
However, it has been shown to have significant
gastrointestinal toxicity in rhesus macaques
(Montgomery et al. 2002a). Sirolimus has also
been used in combination with T regulatory cell
therapy to prolong renal graft survival in the
rhesus model (Ma et al. 2011). Everolimus, another mTOR inhibitor, has also been successfully used in primate models of lung (Hausen
et al. 2000b) and islet transplantation (Wijkstrom et al. 2004).
A bevy of newer immunosuppressants have
also been tested in primate models. FTY720,
which prevents the egress of lymphocytes out
of lymph nodes, prolongs renal graft survival
in macaques, either alone or in combination
with other agents (Schuurman et al. 2002). Sotrastaurin, a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, also prolongs primate renal graft survival
(Bigaud et al. 2012). It too was found to synergize with other agents, including the aforementioned FTY720 (Bigaud et al. 2006, 2012).
The Janus kinase 3 inhibitor, tofacitinib (CP690,550), was used in a cynomolgus renal transplant model and was shown to prolong graft
survival and decrease circulating natural killer
(NK) and T-cell populations, a result interpreted to be consistent with multiple cytokine
blockade (Borie et al. 2005). Finally, a study of
PG490-88, a prodrug form of triptolide, showed
prolonged renal allograft survival in cynomolgus monkeys (Chen et al. 2006).
COSTIMULATION BLOCKADE
The blockade of costimulatory signals has repeatedly been used to induce tolerance in rodent
models (Turka et al. 1992; Pearson et al. 1994;
Larsen et al. 1996). However, the translation of
these strategies to large animal models has been
less successful. Two phenomena are believed to
be primarily responsible for this discrepancy.
First, more outbred animals will have a higher
precursor frequency, and the alloreactive immune cells are capable of overcoming costimulation blockade by sheer numbers (Ford et al.
2007). Antigen recognition inefficiently generates some response in the absence of costimulation, and the high precursor frequency makes
up for this inefficiency, allowing for an immunologically meaningful response (Viola and
Lanzavecchia 1996; Germain 2001). Second,
there are some cell populations, such as memory
T cells, that appear to be less dependent on costimulation (London et al. 2000); thus, more
experienced immune systems will be more apt
to respond to antigen even during costimulatory
blockade. In this review, we will focus on the
CD28-B7 and CD40-CD154 pathways, which
are the most extensively studied of the costimulatory pathways. However, as the role of costimulation has been increasingly studied, multiple receptor–ligand pairs have been discovered,
and it is now generally accepted that multiple
ancillary pathways exist to modulate the immune response (Ford and Larsen 2009; Pilat et
al. 2011). Owing to the highly specific nature of
the biologic agents used to block these signals,
primate models have become the large animal
model of choice for these studies (Kirk 1999).
Of existing costimulation blockade strategies, blockade of the CD28-B7 pathway has
reached the furthest clinical development, with
the FDA approval of belatacept for use in human
kidney transplantation in July of 2011. Early
work to study blockade of the CD28 pathway
involved monoclonal antibodies against the B7
ligands CD80 and CD86. Three groups showed
prolongation of renal allograft survival using
the antibodies 1F1 and 3D1 either alone or in
combination with other immunosuppressants
(Hausen et al. 2001; Kirk et al. 2001; Montgomery et al. 2002b; Birsan et al. 2003). Another
group used different clones, B7-24 and 1G10,
in rhesus skin and renal transplant models
with modest success (Ossevoort et al. 1998a,b).
Despite these successes, further development of
these antibodies was abandoned, as it was shown
that both B7 molecules needed to be blocked to
have efficacy (Kirk et al. 2001), and the B7-specific fusion protein approach accomplished this
with a single agent, thus simplifying development plans.
A second strategy to block the CD28 pathway is via the soluble form of the CTLA4 recepD.J. Anderson and A.D. Kirk

tor, the fusion protein CTLA4-Ig, which binds
both B7 ligands. Following success in several
rodent models (Pearson et al. 1994; Akalin
et al. 1996; Bolling et al. 1996), early studies in
multiple primate models showed only modest
prolongation of graft survival (Kirk et al. 1997;
Levisetti et al. 1997; Krieger et al. 1998). Persistent interest in this pathway led to the development of belatacept, which differs from the base
CTLA4-Ig protein by only two amino acids, but
shows significantly higher inhibition of CD28
signaling (Larsen et al. 2005). Belatacept was
shown to be effective as maintenance therapy
in primate models of islet and renal transplantation (Cardona et al. 2006; Lo et al. 2013; Lowe
et al. 2013), and subsequent clinical trials led to
its successful translation to human use.
Blockade of the CD28 pathway via targeting
of the B7 ligands has the potential drawback of
blockade of inhibitory signals through CTLA4,
and significant interest exists in developing therapeutics that will simultaneously block CD28
signaling while leaving CTLA4 signaling intact.
The use of full monoclonal antibodies directed
against CD28 was set back by the disastrous results of the TGN1412 trial, in which an antiCD28 antibody with superagonistic qualities
caused life-threatening inflammatory responses
in all six human volunteers who received the
drug (Suntharalingam et al. 2006). Although
several recommendations have been made for
the design of future trials to avoid a repeat of
the TGN141 trial (Stebbings et al. 2007; Findlay
et al. 2010), there has been, understandably, extreme caution in developing antibodies against
CD28. Since TGN1412, two trials using modified CD28 antibodies have been reported: the
monovalent fusion antibody sc28AT has been
shown to prolong primate graft survival (Poirier
et al. 2010), and a pegylated monovalent Fab’
antibody, FR104, has been promising in rodent models, but thus far only pharmacokinetic
studies have been reported in primates (Poirier
et al. 2012).
The CD40-CD154 pathway has also been extensively studied in primate models. The monoclonal antibody hu5C8, directed against CD154,
has been shown to be efficacious in multiple
primate transplant models involving several organs (Kenyon et al. 1999a,b; Kirk et al. 1999;
Pierson et al. 1999; Elster et al. 2001b; Xu et al.
2001). Similarly, two other antibodies against
CD154, IDEC-131 and ABI793, have been
shown to prolong graft survival in primate models (Pfeiffer et al. 2001; Pierson et al. 2001; Xu
et al. 2001, 2003; Kanmaz et al. 2004; Schuler
et al. 2004; Preston et al. 2005; Azimzadeh
et al. 2006; Pearl et al. 2007). Somewhat fortuitously, hu5C8 was one of the first antibodies to
be tested at the relatively high dose of 20 mg/kg.
This was important, as it was later discovered
that CD154 was present on multiple cell types
throughout the body, offering large quantities of
the ligand to compete for binding, and, in some
cases, initiate rejection (Xu et al. 2006). It is possible that the efficacy of CD154 blockade would
not have been appreciated had a lower dose been
used. Unfortunately, however, the widespread
distribution of CD154, particularly on platelets,
has led to concerns regarding the thromboembolic potential of CD154-directed therapies,
and this has limited the clinical development
of these therapies (Kawai et al. 2000).
The success of the CD154 antibodies prompted continued investigation of the pathway, focusing on CD40. Multiple antibodies against
CD40 have been tested, with efficacy on graft
survival and effect on B-cell populations depending on the clone used: Chi220 (Pearson
et al. 2002; Adams et al. 2005), 3A8 (Badell et
al. 2012a,b; Page et al. 2012a), 4D11 (Imai et al.
2007; Aoyagi et al. 2009), ch5D12 (de Vos et al.
2004), or 2C10 (Lowe et al. 2012).
The combination of CD28-B7 and CD40-
CD154 pathway blockade has been studied on
multiple occasions. Depending on the agents
used, the combination has only sometimes
provided a graft survival advantage over either
agent alone. However, even in cases in which no
synergy was seen in terms of graft survival, there
does appear to be an advantage of combination
therapy in abating the humoral response (Ossevoort et al. 1998b; Montgomery et al. 2002b).
Clearly, as our understanding of these and other
costimulatory pathways improves, there will be
plenty of opportunity to further develop strategies to take advantage of these molecules for
immune modulation.

ADHESION BLOCKADE
A number of surface molecules on immune
cells mediate the interaction between these
cells, their environment, and each other. Many
of these adhesion molecules are important for
cell trafficking and homing, whereas some have
been found to stabilize the immune synapse,
and even provide costimulatory signals. This
section will focus on two prominent adhesion
molecules in transplantation experiments.
The integrin LFA-1 is the most extensively
studied of the adhesion molecules. It has been
shown to be important in cell trafficking and
homing (Hamann et al. 1988; Kavanaugh et al.
1991; Warnock et al. 1998), antigen presentation (Moy and Brian 1992; Pribila et al. 2004),
and costimulation (Van Seventer et al. 1990;
Nicolls and Gill 2006). The apparent importance of LFA-1 in multiple areas of the immune
response prompted significant interest as a strategy for immunosuppression. Anti-LFA-1-based
regimens have been successful in prolonging
graft survival in primate models of skin (Berlin
et al. 1992), cardiac (Poston et al. 2000), and
islet transplantation (Badell et al. 2010). Translation of these strategies to human use has been
challenging. Studies of the humanized antiLFA-1 agent, efalizumab, in kidney (Vincenti
et al. 2007) and islet (Turgeon et al. 2010) transplantation were promising. However, the drug,
which was widely used for psoriasis, was found
to be the cause of four cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in that population,
and was removed from the market. Any future
anti-LFA-1-based regimens will likely need to be
more selective in their blockade to avoid deleterious effects on protective immunity.
The interaction of CD2 and LFA-3 primarily
strengthens the interaction of T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), but also, like LFA1, is capable of transducing costimulatory signals directly (Bromgerg 1993). Multiple agents
to block this interaction have been developed
with modest results in primate models (Kaplon
et al. 1996; Dehoux et al. 2000). Weaver et al.
(2009) used the fusion protein alefacept (LFA3-
Ig) in addition to CTLA4-Ig in a rhesus renal
transplant model with significant prolongation
of graft survival. However, a subsequent study
by the same group, which replaced CTLA4-Ig
with belatacept, showed no benefit with the addition of alefacept and an increase in viral infections in both renal and islet models (Lo et al.
2013; Lowe et al. 2013). Clearly, further experiments will be needed to clarify the role of CD2
blockade in the future.
Much like the exploding number of costimulatory receptor–ligand pairs that have
been discovered over recent years, increasing
numbers of adhesion molecules are being discovered and studied. As our understanding of
these molecules improves, it is likely we may be
able to exploit these pathways to modulate the
alloimmune response. One such candidate is
the integrin VLA-4, for which an agent, natalizumab, is already approved for use in multiple
sclerosis, making it an ideal candidate for translation for use in transplantation.
DEPLETION
One strategy to deal with the aforementioned
issue of relatively high precursor frequency and
sensitization is to remove those cells from the
body before transplantation. Thus, lymphocyte
depletion is seen as an adjuvant to other therapies in the development of tolerance regimens.
However, at present there are no readily available NHP-specific depletional agents; thus, human specific preparations are used. These have
efficacy in NHPs, but they do not mimic the
effects seen in humans. Thus, NHP models are
not as satisfactory for studying depletion as they
are for the more specific pathway blockade described above.
Lymphocyte depletion with polyclonal
preparations was one of the first strategies developed. These preparations include both antilymphocytic antibodies as well as antibodies
against a variety of other cell-surface molecules,
particularly adhesion molecules, which may be
of use in cases in which ischemic injury leads to
activated endothelium providing an interface
for leukocyte adhesion and migration (Hammer and Thein 2002). Rabbit antithymocyte
globulin (ATG) must be given in much higher
doses in primates than humans, likely owing to

decreased specificity for NHP epitopes, notably
CD3 (Preville et al. 2001). ATG has been shown
to prolong primate graft survival (Thomas et al.
1978); however, its dosing requirements, halflife, and specificity differ so significantly from
that seen in humans (the species towhich ATG is
raised) that it is unlikely that ATG’s behavior in
NHPs is a satisfactory surrogate for its use in the
clinic. ATG fails to induce tolerance in most
models, and is thus used primarily as induction
therapy followed by some form of maintenance
therapy, a variety of which have been successful
(Hirshberg et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2007). However,
a study by Haanstra et al. (2006) found that ATG
combined with costimulation blockade shortened the time to rejection, possibly owing to
decreased intragraft inhibitory molecules. The
lymphocyte repopulation following depletion
with ATG relatives enriches memory populations (Pearl et al. 2007), potentially with lower
costimulation requirements.
A variety of monoclonal antibodies have
been developed to eliminate or incapacitate reactive effector T cells. Depletion with CD3 and
CD4 antibodies conjugated to idarubicin allowed for operational tolerance in half of baboon kidney grafts when paired with TLI, but
only when given preoperatively (Myburgh et al.
2001). However, use of a nondepleting antibody,
OKT4A, only modestly prolonged graft survival
(Cosimi et al. 1990;Wee et al. 1992;Mourad et al.
1998). Depletion based on another potential
target, CD45RB, has been shown to prolong
graft survival in cynomolgus macaques (Chen
et al. 2007). B cells have also been targeted in
depletional studies, with the agent rituximab
showing prolongation of graft survival in primate islet (Liu et al. 2007) and cardiac models
(Kelishadi et al. 2010).
The most promising results in NHP lymphocyte depletion have been achieved using immunotoxin (IT), a fusion of a modified diptheria toxin with a monoclonal antibody against
CD3 (Neville et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1997). Knechtle has been able to show pretransplant depletion
with IT promotes tolerance in renal transplant
models (Knechtle et al. 1997, 1998a). Despite
the ability of IT to reverse rejection in a rhesus
renal transplant model (Knechtle et al. 1998b), it
has been somewhat less effective at prolonging
graft survival when given at the time of transplant rather than beforehand (Armstrong et al.
1998; Jonker et al. 2002). The development of a
humoral response leading to graft loss in these
models using chemically linked IT, or the somewhat less effective recombinant IT (Ma et al.
1997; Kim et al. 2007), has been proposed as a
useful model of chronic allograft rejection (Torrealba et al. 2003; Page et al. 2012b).
CHIMERISM
Chimerism has long been studied as a method
of inducing allograft tolerance, dating to the
studies of Owen (1945) in freemartin cattle,
and later Medawar and colleagues (Billingham
et al. 1956). Hematopoietic chimerism can be
classified based on the relative number of donor cells in the general cell population. Infusion
of hematopoietic stem cells into an unconditioned recipient leads to rapid rejection of the
cells and failure to engraft. Microchimerism,
in which ,1% of circulating cells are of donor
origin, and these are only detectable by very
sensitive techniques such as PCR, is the most
this model can produce. Establishment of mixed
chimerism (.1% but ,100%) or especially full
chimerism (100%), requires more intensely
ablative conditioning of the recipient. The potential toxicity of these conditioning regimens
has been a major barrier to clinical translation of
chimerism-based approaches, given the relative
safety of modern immunosuppression.
Donor-specific marrow infusions without
ablative preconditioning have been studied in
attempts to prolong primate allograft survival.
However, it is worth noting that all transplant
recipients are likely microchimeric to some
degree (Starzl et al. 1992), and this does not
lead to widespread tolerance. It is possible the
establishment of microchimerism is thus simply a marker for sufficient immunosuppression
(Wood and Sachs 1996).
Full chimerism, in which virtually all of the
hematopoietic cells are of donor origin, is generally only achievable following intense conditioning in HLA identical siblings, if graftversus-host-disease (GvHD) is to be avoided.

However, there are multiple reports of full
chimerism inducing donor-specific tolerance
of subsequent renal grafts (Sayegh et al. 1991;
Helg et al. 1994; Jacobsen et al. 1994) in humans.
Full chimerism does have some drawbacks, however, both in the risk of GvHD and an apparent
immune incompetence likely owing to MHC
disparity between donor-derived immune cells
and recipient-derived APCs (Sykes 2001).
Based on the studies of microchimerism, it is
generally accepted that macrochimerism is necessary for durable tolerance to develop, and the
drawbacks and impracticalities of full chimerism approaches have made mixed chimerism
an area of intense study. A group in Boston has
induced mixed chimerism in cynomolgus macaques using irradiation, bone marrow infusion,
T-cell depletion, and splenectomy across MHC
barriers without GvHD (Kawai et al. 1995; Kimikawa et al. 1997). These animals accepted renal allografts from their marrow donors and, in
most cases, also did not produce donor-specific
antibodies (Kawai et al. 1999). However, results
in cardiac transplantation were somewhat less
promising (Kawai et al. 2002), and this regimen
also induced increased rates of posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), likely related to lymphocryptovirus (LCV) in monkeys
(Schmidtko et al. 2002). Further refinement of
the regimen replaced splenectomy with CD154
blockade (Kawai et al. 2004), and these regimens
formed the basis for the first human trial of
mixed chimerism (Kawai et al. 2008).
Another group has attempted to induce
mixed chimerism in rhesus macaques. In this
model, busulfan is the primary conditioning agent, followed by basiliximab, combined
costimulation blockade, and sirolimus (Kean
et al. 2007). Although the regimen was successful in inducing long-lasting mixed chimerism,
the marrow was found to be rapidly rejected
once the maintenance immunosuppression was
stopped (Larsen et al. 2010), and viral infections continued to be an issue (Kean et al.
2007). Replacing CD154 blockade with CD40
blockade did not prolong marrow graft acceptance beyond the cessation of immunosuppression (Page et al. 2012a). To date, the effect of
these mixed chimerism regimens on solid organ
transplantation has not been reported. Despite
the challenges of chimerism-based approaches
to tolerance, they represent one of the few strategies that have been successfully translated to
humans, and the promising results of preclinical
studies warrant further research into the field.
SUMMARY
In this article, we have reviewed the use of primates in preclinical studies of transplantation,
both in the technical aspects of working with
primates, and also a number of strategies to
prolong graft survival currently being studied.
Some of these approaches have already found
their way into the clinic, whereas others are still
a far way off, in need of significant refinement
before they can become a clinical reality. Primate models of transplantation offer an ideal
arena in which to study these therapies and
hone their application so they may be of the
greatest benefit for our patients.
