Abstract
Background This review aims to present a consensus for
optimal perioperative care in rectal/pelvic surgery, and to
provide graded recommendations for items for an evidenced-based enhanced recovery protocol.
Methods Studies were selected with particular attention
paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and
large prospective cohorts. For each item of the
perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined, reviewed and graded. A
consensus recommendation was reached after critical
appraisal of the literature by the group.
Results For most of the protocol items, recommendations
are based on good-quality trials or meta-analyses of goodquality trials (evidence grade: high or moderate).
Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each item
of the multimodal perioperative care pathway, the Enhanced
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society, European Society
for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and International Association for Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition
(IASMEN) present a comprehensive evidence-based consensus review of perioperative care for rectal surgery.
Introduction
Until quite recently, patients undergoing colorectal resection were counselled to accept a 20–25 % risk of complications and a 7–10-day postoperative stay in hospital. As
This study was conducted on behalf of the ERAS Society, the
European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism and the
International Association for Surgical Nutrition and Metabolism.
The guidelines are published as a joint effort between the Enhanced
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society, for Perioperative Care, The
European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN)
and The International Association for Surgical Metabolism and
Nutrition (IASMEN) and copyrights for this publication is shared
between the three societies. The guidelines are published jointly in
World Journal of Surgery (IASMEN) and Clinical Nutrition
(ESPEN), and will also be available on the ESPEN

studies throughout the 1980s to 1990s showed, length of
stay in hospital (LOSH) and complication rates improved
even if a single component of care was changed [1]. With
this, the idea of incorporating many of these elements into
a comprehensive perioperative care pathway developed.
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a
dynamic culmination of upon perioperative care elements.
The strongest evidence for ERAS implementation is in the
care of patients undergoing open colonic resection. Many
interventions previously shown to benefit outcomes in this
population have now been successfully applied to laparoscopic colon resections, as well as to other surgical specialties such as urology, orthopedics, and gynecology [2].
Investigators studying the application of ERAS principles to colonic resections have acknowledged the difference between intra-abdominal large-bowel resections and
pelvic surgery. Pelvic intestinal resections are fraught with
higher complication rates, longer LOSH, and unique
complications not seen in abdominal surgery. Because of
this and a need to address the more common lower-bowel
resections, the authors of ERAS studies have excluded
patients undergoing rectal resection or treated pelvic
resections as a subgroup. In several studies, rectal resections are included in the overall analysis of an ERAS
protocol or component implementation, only to be excluded or discounted as a ‘special consideration’ group.
In the present work, the authors have specifically considered the application of ERAS principles to a special
population of rectal resection patients. We define pelvic
bowel procedures to include resections of the last 12–15 cm
of the large bowel as measured from the anus, and/or those
resections defined intraoperatively to be below the pelvic
reflection. Through the application of these definitions, we
have included resections that encompass the increased:
difficulty of pelvic surgery compared with segmental
colonic resections; operative times and use of retraction
known to increase perioperative morbidity; risk to the pelvic
structures (e.g., hypogastric nerves, ureters). Although all
indications for pelvic resections were included in the literature search, mention of specific recommendations relative
to the diagnosis is made if appropriate. For example, the use
of laparoscopy for pelvic bowel malignancy is not as readily
applied outside of a trial as opposed to commonly accepted
laparoscopic resection for pelvic inflammatory bowel
disease.
With recognition of the aspects of pelvic bowel surgery
that are known to be more difficult and moribund than
abdominal surgery, we critically reviewed and graded the
evidence. These guidelines are a literature review with
summary expert opinion regarding the application of
ERAS principles to rectal resection. Many (but not all)
ERAS protocol elements, as defined in colonic resection,
have been applied successfully to rectal resection. Table 1
is an overview of the individual components of ERAS for
colonic resection with explanations as to the applicability
in rectal resection. While practical, a discussion of application of the individual elements may not be as important
as the consideration of a paradigm shift. The true focus of
ERAS, whether the application of interventions is to rectal
resection or orthopedics, is the understanding and prevention of the causative factors of perioperative stress and loss
of homeostasis. By considering the specific stress factors
associated with rectal resection during our review of the
literature, we have created guidelines to shift the paradigm
of care of rectal resection patients and stimulate more
studies to further this effort.
Methods
Literature search
The authors met in April 2011, and the topics for inclusion
were agreed and allocated. The principal literature search
utilised MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases to
identify relevant articles published between January 1966
and January 2012. Medical Subject Headings terms
were used, as well as the accompanying entry terms for
the patient group, interventions and outcomes. The
selected key words were ‘‘rectum’’, ‘‘perioperative care’’,
‘‘enhanced recovery’’ and ‘‘fast track’’. There was no language restriction. Reference lists of all eligible articles were
checked for other relevant studies. Conference proceedings
were not searched. Expert contributions came from within
the ERAS Society Working Party on Systematic Reviews.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts were screened by individual reviewers to
identify potentially relevant articles. Discrepancies in
judgement were resolved by the senior author and during
committee meetings of the ERAS Society Working Party on
Systematic Reviews. Reviews, case series, non-randomised
and randomised control studies, meta-analyses and systematic reviews were considered for each individual topic.

Quality assessment and data analyses
The methodological quality of the included studies was
assessed using the Cochrane checklist [3]. The strength of
evidence and conclusions were assessed and agreed by all
authors in May 2012. Quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated according to the Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system [4–7]. Quoting from the GRADE
guidelines [4], the recommendations are given as follows:
‘‘Strong recommendations indicate that the panel is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects’’. ‘‘Weak
recommendations indicate that the desirable effects of
adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the
undesirable effects, but the panel is less confident’’. Recommendations were based on quality of evidence (‘‘high’’,
‘‘moderate’’, ‘‘low’’, ‘‘very low’’) but also on the balance
between desirable and undesirable effects; and on values
and preferences [4]. The latter implies that, in some cases,
strong recommendations could be reached from low-quality data and vice versa.
Evidence base and recommendations
ERAS items
Preoperative counselling
Preoperative counselling targeting expectations about surgical and anaesthetic procedures may diminish fear and
anxiety and enhance postoperative recovery and discharge
[8–10]. Personal counselling, leaflets or multimedia information containing explanations of the procedure along with
tasks that the patient should be encouraged to fulfil may
improve perioperative feeding, early postoperative mobilisation, pain control, and respiratory physiotherapy; and
hence reduce the prevalence of complications [11–13].
Ideally, the patient should meet with the surgeon, anaesthetist and nurse. Patients destined for a diverting or permanent stoma should have a preadmission nursing visit
regarding enterostomal therapy to better prepare them for
the procedure and to reduce postoperative LOSH [14].
Summary and
recommendation
Patients should receive routine
dedicated preoperative counselling.
Evidence level Low.
Recommendation grade Strong.
Preoperative optimisation
Preoperative optimisation is a crucial step in major abdominal surgery and physiological preparation for surgery is
important. Preoperative evaluation should be used to identify
medical conditions and risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Optimisation of anaemia, diabetes
mellitus (DM) and hypertension improves outcomes (Preoperative Assessment and Patient Preparation, AAGBI
Guidelines, January 2010. Available at: http://www.aagbi.
org/publications/guidelines/docs/preop2010.pdf) [15]. Malnourished patients have limited nutritional stores, and benefit
from preoperative nutritional supplementation with fewer
infectious complications and anastomotic leaks [16].
Before surgery, patients should be advised to stop
smoking or drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. A
recent review over 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
involving 1,194 patients concluded that smoking cessation
in the perioperative period (initiated 4 weeks before surgery) appeared to be beneficial in improving surgical outcomes [17]. Several studies have described the association
between hazardous intake of alcohol and an increase in
postoperative morbidity with a higher risk of postoperative
infections, cardiopulmonary complications and bleeding
episodes [18].
A recent RCT [19] showed that ‘pre-habilitation’ (a
programme designed to increase functional capacity in
anticipation of an upcoming stressor) addresses the impact
that physical exercise might have on postoperative functional exercise capacity. The effect of such programmes
regarding outcome remains to be evaluated [20].

smoking and alcohol intake 4 weeks

Increasing exercise preoperatively may
be of benefit. Preoperative specialised
nutritional support should be considered
for malnourished patients.

Preoperative bowel preparation
Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is associated with
dehydration and changes in electrolyte balance (particularly in the elderly) [21]. A meta-analysis from studies
focusing on colonic surgery show no clinical benefit from
MBP [22].
A recent update of the Cochrane review on MBP in
colorectal surgery included 18 studies (n = 5,805) [22].
Comparisons were made between MBP versus no preparation and MBP versus rectal enema only. Anastomotic
leakage was assessed in patients undergoing restoration of
bowel continuity, and showed no difference between MBP
and no preparation/enema. Patients undergoing low anterior resection were also analysed separately (7 studies,
n = 846). In this group of patients, bowel preparation was
not associated with a changed prevalence of anastomotic
leakage (7.4 vs. 7.9 %). The authors concluded (as was
shown before) that routine bowel preparation before colonic surgery was of no value, and should not be recommended. However, if intraoperative colonoscopy might be
carried out due to a small lesion or for any other reason,
MBP should be initiated.
Patients undergoing pelvic surgery with restoration of
bowel continuity frequently receive a proximal diversion.
Although this has not been studied in detail, this group of
patients will probably need oral MBP. A recent multicentre,
single-blind, RCT included 178 patients undergoing low
anterior resection for rectal cancer. Patients were randomised to preoperative MBP versus no preparation [23]. In this
study (in which[80 % of subjects had a diverting stoma),
overall and infectious morbidity were higher in the no MBP
group. A non-significant trend to a twofold higher risk for
overall and clinical anastomotic leak (19 vs. 11 %) and
peritonitis (7 vs. 2 %) was also found in the no MBP group.
In the latter study, [80 % underwent laparoscopic low
anterior resection. It is necessary to conduct further trials
comparing MBP with no preparation/enema in patients
undergoing laparoscopic surgery (especially in pelvic
surgery).
Summary and
recommendation
In general, MBP should not be used
in pelvic surgery. However, when a
diverting ileostomy is planned, MBP
may be necessary (although this needs
to be studied further.
Evidence level Anterior resection: (do not use MBP)
High; Total mesorectal excision (TME)
with diverting stoma: (use MBP) Low
Recommendation
grade
Anterior resection: (do not use MBP)
Strong; TME with diverting stoma:

Preoperative fasting
Fasting from midnight has been standard practice in the
belief that this reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration in
elective surgery. However, a Cochrane review of 22 RCTs
showed that fasting from midnight did not reduce gastric
content, increase the pH of gastric fluid, or affect the
prevalence of complications compared with patients
allowed free intake of clear fluids up until 2 h before
anesthesia for surgery [24]. Thus, most national anesthesia
societies now recommend intake of clear fluids up until 2 h
before the induction of anesthesia as well as a 6-h fast for
solid food [25]. Although diabetic patients with neuropathy
may have delayed gastric emptying (thereby possibly
increasing the risk of regurgitation and aspiration), patients
with uncomplicated type-2 DM have been reported to have
normal gastric emptying [26].
Summary and
recommendation
Intake of clear fluids up until 2 h
before the induction of anaesthesia is
allowed. Intake of solids should be
withheld at C6 h before anaesthesia.
Evidence level Moderate
Recommendation
grade
Strong
Preoperative treatment with carbohydrates
By providing a clear fluid containing a defined (12 %)
concentration of complex carbohydrates up until 2 h before
anesthesia, patients can undergo surgery in a metabolically
fed state [27]. This treatment reduces the prevalence of
preoperative thirst, hunger, and anxiety [24]. In addition,
postoperative insulin resistance is reduced by &50 % as
shown in several placebo-controlled randomised studies in
World J Surg (2013) 37:285–305 289
123

various surgical procedures (e.g., major abdominal surgery, orthopedic surgery) [27]. The treatment (avoiding
preoperative fasting) also results in less postoperative
nitrogen and protein losses [28, 29] as well as bettermaintained lean body mass [30] and muscle strength [31].
Data from RCTs indicated accelerated recovery, and preliminary data from a meta-analysis showed 1-day shorter
LOSH in patients receiving preoperative carbohydrate
loading in major abdominal surgery [32]. Studies have
indicated that the relative reduction in insulin sensitivity
after a specific surgical procedure is related to the degree
of surgery, and that more pronounced surgical stress results
in a more advanced insulin resistance [27]. Thus, patients
undergoing pelvic surgery suffer from significant and
severe insulin resistance, and will benefit from avoiding
preoperative fasting using this metabolic preparation. In
addition, in a large prospective cohort of patients undergoing colorectal surgery (n = 953), including 419 patients
undergoing pelvic surgery, preoperative carbohydrate
loading was an independent predictor of postoperative
clinical outcome, including postoperative nausea and
vomiting (PONV) [33]
Summary and
recommendation
Preoperative oral carbohydrate loading should be administered to all nondiabetic patients.
Evidence level Reduced postoperative insulin resistance: Moderate
Improved clinical
outcomes
Low
Recommendation
grade
Strong
Preanaesthetic medication
Patients undergoing rectal surgery are anxious about the
surgery and outcome. Education and reassurance can allay
anxiety, but pharmacological interventions to reduce anxiety can be indicated, particularly in younger patients
before procedures such as insertion of an epidural or
arterial catheter. Anxiolytics such as clonidine, have been
shown to have opioid-sparing capacity but clonidine is
associated with hypotension and sedation [34].
Short-acting benzodiazepines can be given to facilitate
patient positioning and insertion of an epidural catheter.
Long-acting benzodiazepines are discouraged because
they cause psychomotor impairment during the postoperative period, which can impair mobilisation and direct
participation [35]. These medications are not indicated in
the elderly (age [60 years) because they have been
associated with cognitive dysfunction and delirium after
surgery [36, 37].
Summary and
recommendation
No advantages in using long-acting
benzodiazepines. Short-acting benzodiazepines can be used in young patients
before potentially painful interventions
(insertion of spinal or epidural, arterial
catheter), but they should not be used in
the elderly (age[60 years).
Evidence level Moderate
Recommendation
grade
Strong
Prophylaxis against thromboembolism
It has been shown that pharmacological prophylaxis
against venous thrombosis (VT) reduces the prevalence of
symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) without
increasing side effects such as bleeding [38]. In addition,
use of compression stockings reduces the incidence of VTE
[39]. Patients with extensive comorbidity, malignant disease, who are taking corticosteroids preoperatively, who
have undergone previous pelvic surgery, and those in
hypercoagulable states have an increased risk of VTE [40].
In a recent Cochrane report based on 4 RCTs (n = 1,021),
it was concluded that prolonged (4 weeks postoperatively)
VTE prophylaxis as compared with in-hospital prophylaxis
was associated with a significantly reduced prevalence of
VTE (14.3 vs. 6.1 %, p\0.0005), as well as symptomatic
VTE (1.7 vs. 0.2 %), without an increase in postoperative
bleeding complications or other side effects [38]. It is also
demonstrated that compliance with prolonged treatment
with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was high
([97 %). It is not known if early recovery, with the use of
laparoscopic surgery and/or enhanced recovery protocols,
reduces the risk of VTE. In addition, there are no controlled
data available in patients undergoing major abdominal or
pelvic surgery within enhanced recovery protocols. Until
such data are available it is recommended that patients
undergoing major abdominal or pelvic surgery with
increased risk for VTE receive a prolonged treatment with
LMWH up to 4 weeks postoperatively even if early recovery
and early discharge from hospital is achieved.
Summary and
recommendation
Patients should wear well-fitting compression stockings, and receive pharmacological prophylaxis with LMWH.
Extended prophylaxis for 28 days
should be considered in patients with
colorectal cancer or other patients with
increased risk of VTE.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation
Prophylactic antibiotics Prophylactic antibiotics are
effective against aerobes and anaerobes; they have been
shown to reduce the prevalence of infectious complications
in colorectal surgery [41, 42]. A single dose is as effective
as multidose regimens [42], but further doses should be
given in prolonged cases ([3 h) depending on the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics used [41]. The first intravenous dose should be administered before skin incision
but B1 h before surgery [41]. A Cochrane meta-analysis
concluded that a combination of intravenous and oral
administration is more effective than intravenous alone or
oral alone [42]. However, none of the included studies
compared a similar combination of antibiotics administered orally and intravenously versus orally alone or
intravenously alone. Hence, the revealed effect may just be
the effect of adding another antimicrobial drug in the oral/
intravenous groups and not an effect of the route of
administration. The optimal combination of antibiotics has
not been established, but a combination of metronidazole
and a relevant aerobic antibiotic is often suggested. New
generations of antibiotics have been reserved for infectious
complications. However, in a 2006 multicentre prospective
study in the USA, Itani et al. [43] showed an absolute
difference in infection rate of nearly 15 % lower in a group
randomised to single preoperative dose of ertepenem versus a cephalosporin. The greatest difference was seen in
the subgroup of rectal resections. Whether improved
effectiveness is sufficient reason to change the ‘‘dogma’’ of
not using new antibiotics for prophylaxis remains to be
proven.
Summary and
recommendation
Patients should receive antimicrobial
prophylaxis before skin incision in a
single dose. Repeated doses may be
necessary depending on the half-life of
drug and duration of surgery.

Standard anaesthetic protocol
Laparotomy with resection of the rectum requires a longer
abdominal incision and more extensive dissection in the
pelvic area. A laparoscopic approach to rectal dissection
requires longer periods of time but is less invasive. A
5–7-cm surgical incision (horizontal or vertical) is used to
facilitate extraction of the specimen. Mobilization of the
viscera and excision of the colon and rectum requires the
Trendelenburg position for better access. There are no
randomized controlled trials comparing the impact of
intravenous versus inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative outcome in rectal surgery. The considerations mentioned below should be taken into account if surgical stress
needs to be attenuated.
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia can be guided
by the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, thereby avoiding
deep levels of anesthesia (BIS \30), particularly in the
elderly [45].
Insertion of a thoracic epidural catheter is recommended
for open and assisted laparoscopic procedures to attenuate the
stress response and provide better postoperative pain relief.
Long-acting local anesthetics can be administered as a bolus
or by continuous infusion throughout the procedure. If an
epidural is not feasible or contraindicated, intravenous lidocaine can be administered due to its anti-inflammatory and
opioid-sparing properties. It can be given at induction
(1.5 mg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/h
during surgery [46]. Spinal local anesthetics and opioids have
been used successfully for colonic and colorectal resection
[47]. Attention should be paid to the opioid doses because
postoperative respiratory depression in the elderly can occur.
A reduced dose of opioid is advised in those aged[70 years.
Short-acting potent opioids such as remifentanil can also
be used to attenuate the stress response [48]. There is no
evidence that induction of acute hyperalgesia associated
with high doses of remifentanil can be reduced by ketamine, magnesium or other N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)
antagonists [49]. Adequate relaxation of muscle is indicated to facilitate extensive resection in the pelvic area,
especially during laparoscopic surgery. However, reversal
of profound muscle relaxation can leave incomplete
reversal. The use of sugammadex to counteract the action
of large doses of muscle relaxants has proven to facilitate
recovery [50]. But no data are available with the ERAS
programme. Adequate lung ventilation with low tidal volumes to limit peak airway pressure is suggested to reduce
the risk of barotraumas [51, 52]. However, if patients are in
the Trendelenburg position, the risk of atelectasis is greater
and therefore lung recruitment is required. Inspired oxygen
concentration [80 % has been shown to decrease the
World J Surg (2013) 37:285–305 291
123

prevalence of surgical-site infection [53]. There is insufficient evidence for the use of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent postoperative pulmonary
complications and the impact on mortality [54]. Increased
insulin resistance as a result of surgery causes hyperglycemia [55], and this should be avoided because it can lead
to postoperative complications [56–58]. The optimal level
of blood glucose is not known, so effort should be made to
measure blood sugar during surgery and to keep it
\10 mmol/l using intravenous insulin when needed.
Maintenance of adequate gut perfusion is of paramount
importance for the integrity of the anastomosis. Because of
the lack of vascular autoregulation in the splanchnic area,
gut perfusion is dependent upon mean arterial pressure and
cardiac output [59]. Satisfactory gut perfusion can be
achieved by providing adequate amounts of intravascular
fluids and more specifically goal-directed fluid therapy
using minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring [60].
Intraoperative hypotension should be avoided because it
can impact negatively on perfusion of the gut and anastomosis. Appropriate use of vasopressors such as neosynephrine or low doses of norepinephrine is strongly
recommended [61].
Summary and
recommendation
To attenuate the surgical stress
response, intraoperative maintenance
of adequate hemodynamic control,
central and peripheral oxygenation,
muscle relaxation, depth of anesthesia,
and appropriate analgesia is strongly
recommended.

PONV
PONV is a major cause of delay in recommencement of
oral food intake and can be more stressful than pain [62–
64]. Risk factors include being female and a non-smoker,
history of motion sickness (or PONV), and postoperative
administration of opioids. PONV is a well-known side
effect of some routine perioperative drugs, such as opioids
or neostigmine, which should be avoided if possible. In
fact, the prevalence of PONV after a standard anesthetic
procedure of inhalational anesthetics and opioids and no
PONV prophylaxis is B30 %. PONV can be minimised
with the use of effective anti-emetic regimens. Multimodal
prevention may represent a more simple approach and a
more reliable strategy. The addition to these regimens of
higher doses of perioperative glucocorticoids may further
reduce the incidence of PONV. Without any clear evidence
from RCTs, it seems reasonable to include in any ERAS
protocol a multimodal anti-emetic prophylaxis regimen to
eliminate (or substantially reduce) the incidence of PONV.
Summary and
recommendation
Prevention of PONV should be included
as standard in ERAS protocols. More
specifically, a multimodal approach to
PONV prophylaxis should be adopted in
all patients with C2 risk factors
undergoing major colorectal surgery. If
PONV is present, treatment should be
via a multimodal approach.
Evidence level High-risk patients: (use multimodal
prophylaxis) High; In all patients: Low

Surgical techniques
Laparoscopic rectal resection Though not yet supported
with strong evidence from RCTs, the laparoscopic
approach to pelvic surgery has been shown to decrease the
inflammatory response to surgery relative to open approaches. It therefore merits mention in this review of multimodal interventions for enhanced recovery.
Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard
against which other surgical approaches are now compared.
The impetus for this worldwide change in surgical
approach to procedures such as cholecystectomy and
nephrectomy reflect impressively better short-term recovery. The improvement in short-term recovery in colon
resection relative to open is less dramatic, but it is certainly
‘physiologically rational and definitely will be an important
component in future accelerated recovery programs’
according to Kehlet and Wilmore in their review in 2008
[2]. Three diagnoses eligible for minimally invasive
approaches are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP),
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and neoplasms.
Laparoscopic rectal resection for benign disease Laparoscopic proctocolectomy for FAP or IBD has been defined
as ‘safe’ and ‘feasible’ at specialist centers, though some
reports have raised concerns of under-studied functional
outcomes and increased costs. Nevertheless, retrospective
reviews, prospectively collected cohort studies, and the one
RCT have consistently shown a decreased LOSH as well as
the same or decreased: time to bowel function; time to oral
nutrition tolerance; and wound complications [65, 66].
Additionally, the Washington University review showed
that the laparoscopic ileal pouch group came to ileostomy
closure sooner than the open group, presumptively because

of fewer complications and more expedient return to normal activities and recovery [65]. Given that these procedures are often undertaken in young patients, a study
documenting better female fecundity after laparoscopic
versus open proctocolectomy is an important addition to
the evidence of safety and applicability of laparoscopy for
the resection of benign tumours [67]. The only metaanalysis in this area involves one RCT and 15 studies; all
included studies had mixed populations relative to the
preoperative risk factors of immunosuppression and
immunomodulator use, as well as medically refractory or
complicated IBD. Laparoscopic resection in the included
studies was ‘‘at least as safe’’ and seemed to confer
decreased postoperative ileus and LOSH in combination
with a decreased overall complication rate [68]. Necessary
RCTs are unlikely to follow because the use of laparoscopy
in IBD is strongly driven by the surgeon and patient.
Summary and
recommendation
With proven safety and at least equivocal
disease-specific outcomes, laparoscopic
proctectomy and proctocolectomy for
benign disease can be carried out by an
experienced surgeon within an ERAS
protocol with the goals of reduced
perioperative stress (manifested by
decreased postoperative ileus), decreased
LOSH, and fewer overall complications.

Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer Laparoscopic,
laparoscopic-assisted, and robotic rectal resection for
neoplastic disease is controversial. A recent meta-analysis
identified 9 RCTs addressing this topic, but a consensus is
pending after reporting of the European-based Randomized
Clinical Trial Comparing Laparoscopic and Open Surgery
for Rectal Cancer (COLOR II) and the American College
of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG Z6051) studies is
complete [69]. This international debate regarding the
adequacy of oncologic resection of rectal cancer by laparoscopy has led to brilliant discussions in the literature and
at surgical meeting forums regarding the definition of
resection, the risks of inadequate resection, the expected
short-term and long-term oncologic outcomes and, to a
lesser extent, the possible physiological benefits of laparoscopy. In relation to this review, there is little doubt
about the physiological benefits of laparoscopic rectal
resection over open resection [70, 71]. This discussion
though, will be null, should the evidence prove inferiority
with respect to oncology.
The UK-based Conventional Versus LaparoscopicAssisted Surgery In Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC) trial
supports a laparoscopic approach for rectal cancer but
included a high conversion rate and unexpected higher rate
of TME in the laparoscopic group. This was in combination
with a slightly higher positive circumferential resection
margin in the laparoscopic group. This brings into question
the pathological standardization and the surgeon experience in both groups. At 3-year follow-up, however, no
higher cancer recurrence than the open group was noted
[72, 73]. Poon and Huang reviewed the topic separately,
and concluded the greatest concern was the quality of the
TME. Both concluded that, if proven to be oncologically
equivalent, laparoscopic proctectomy offers benefits of
improved short-term outcomes similar to laparoscopic
colon resection as well as better visualization of the pelvic
nerves and easier dissection between the visceral and
parietal fascia with pneumoperitoneum [71, 74].
Summary and

Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer
is currently not generally recommended
outside of a trial setting (or specialized
centre with ongoing audit) until equivalent
oncologic outcomes are proven.

Nasogastric intubation
A meta-analysis [75] in 1995 showed that routine nasogastric decompression should be avoided after colorectal
surgery because fever, atelectasis, and pneumonia are
reduced in patients without a nasogastric tube. A Cochrane
meta-analysis [76] of 33 trials with [5,000 patients
undergoing abdominal surgery confirmed this finding, and
also found earlier return of bowel function in patients if
nasogastric decompression was avoided. Gastroesophageal
reflux is increased during laparotomy if nasogastric tubes
are inserted [77]. A recent meta-analysis of randomised
trials including 1,416 patients undergoing colorectal surgery showed that pharyngolaryngitis and respiratory
infection occurred less frequently if postoperative nasogastric decompression was avoided but that vomiting was
more common if a nasogastric tube was inserted in 15 % of
subjects [78] In a Dutch study with[2,000 patients found
that the use of nasogastric decompression after elective
colonic surgery declined from 88 to 10 % without increases in patient morbidity or mortality [79]. There is no
rationale for routine insertion of a nasogastric tube during
elective colorectal surgery except to evacuate air that may
have entered the stomach during ventilation by the facial
mask prior to endotracheal intubation. Nasogastric tubes
placed during surgery should be removed before the
reversal of anesthesia.

Preventing intraoperative hypothermia Patients undergoing rectal surgery can become hypothermic as a result of
prolonged exposure of the body and the abdominal cavity
to cold ambient air and anesthesia-induced impaired thermoregulation. There is sufficient evidence that mild
hypothermia is associated with postoperative complications
such as wound infections, cardiac ischemia and bleeding,
and increased pain sensitivity. Warming patients before
surgery keeps the high core temperature [80] but might not
be practical. Monitoring core temperature during surgery is
essential.

Patients undergoing rectal surgery
need to have their body temperature
monitored during and after surgery.

Perioperative fluid management
Most of the literature on fluid management in colorectal
surgery does not separate the colon from the rectum.
Compared with the colon, rectal surgery leads to more fluid
shift as a result of bowel preparation, bowel handling and
blood loss from the pelvic area. In addition, the use of
epidural local anesthetics, pneumoperitoneum, hypothermia and vasodilatation-induced by anesthetic drugs can
cause changes in vascular tone. Whether a restrictive fluid
regimen is better to a liberal one is controversial, but a
recent review [81] concluded that fluid excess was associated with worse outcome.
Goal-directed fluid therapy using the oesophageal Doppler
system has been shown to reduce the LOSH and the rate of
postoperative complications [82, 83]. Minimising intravascular fluid shift is achieved by avoiding bowel preparation,
adequate oral preload up until 2 h prior to surgery, and minimising blood loss. However, goal-directed fluid therapy has
never been compared with restrictive fluid management.
The same results were not confirmed when the ERAS
protocol was applied in laparoscopic surgery [84]. The
rationale of using this device is that the intravenous fluids
are titrated to optimize cardiac output (a better indicator of
oxygen delivery and haemodynamic status than systolic
blood pressure and pulse). Other minimally invasive cardiac output monitors that use arterial waveform analysis
can provide useful information not only during but also
after surgery.
Fluid requirement is decreased in laparoscopic surgery,
and no difference has been shown between colloids and
crystalloids [85]. It appears that balanced crystalloid
solutions are more physiological than 0.9 % sodium chloride [86].
Summary and
recommendation
Fluid balance should be optimised by
targeting cardiac output and avoiding
overhydration. Judicious use of vasopressors is recommended with arterial
hypotension. Targeted fluid therapy
using the oesophageal Doppler system
is recommended.

Drainage of the peritoneal cavity or pelvis
The use of a suction drain in the pelvic cavity after rectal
surgery has been traditionally advocated to evacuate
potential blood or serous collections and prevent anastomotic leakage.
In 2004, a Cochrane systematic review was published
with the aim to compare the safety and effectiveness of
routine drainage and no-drainage regimens after elective
colorectal surgery. The primary outcome was clinical anastomotic leakage [87]. This study included 6 RCTs enrolling
1,140 patients, but only 2 RCTs (191 patients) separated low
rectal anastomoses. The authors could not find a significant
difference in outcomes (odds ration (OR) = 0.85).
In 2005, Bretagnol and coworkers undertook a metaanalyses concerning only rectal surgery (pelvic anastomoses). They included 3 RCTs, and they found that the use of
a drain after rectal surgery did not seem to affect the
leakage rate or overall outcome [88].

Transurethral catheter Urinary drainage used to be standard in rectal resections because urinary function may be
impaired. However, catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common hospital-acquired infection,
accounting for almost 40 % of all nosocomial infections.
In fast-track surgery, urinary drainage should be as short
as possible (ideally B24 h). A recent prospective study
indicated that routine urinary bladder catheterisation after
pelvic surgery may be safely removed on postoperative day
1 [89], as indicated in a previous study [90]. If epidural
analgesia is used, there is a potential risk for urinary
retention but, after 24 h of urinary bladder catheterisation,
this risk is low. A recent randomised study (215 patients)
advocated early removal (the morning after surgery) of the
bladder catheter. Leaving the bladder catheter as long as
the epidural leads to a higher incidence of urinary tract
infections and prolongs LOSH [91].
Summary and

After pelvic surgery with a low estimated
risk of postoperative urinary retention,
the transurethral bladder catheter may be
safely removed on postoperative day 1,

avoiding PONV as outlined elsewhere, but also specific
treatments as outlined below
Chewing gum Gum chewing has been shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 272) to be safe and
beneficial in reducing time to first bowel movement by

Postoperative laxatives and prokinetics In a report from a
well-established ERAS programme, the use of oral laxatives
such as oral magnesium has been associated with normalisation of gastrointestinal transit after colonic resection [94].
Administration of magnesium hydroxide in combination
with bisacodyl suppositories has been described in a cohort
study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy [95]. A
randomised trial of bisacodyl alone in 200 patients undergoing colorectal resection (outwith a defined ERAS protocol) demonstrated a 1-day reduction in time to defaecation,
with no alteration in tolerance of oral food or LOSH. Morbidity and mortality were unaltered [96]. A randomised trial
(n = 74) of postoperative administration of oral magnesium
to patients undergoing elective hepatic resection within an
enhanced recovery protocol demonstrated a 1-day reduction
in time to defaecation but again with no influence on other
outcomes [97]. When oral magnesium oxide was combined
with disodium phosphate in fast-track hysterectomy, a randomised trial (n = 53) demonstrated a 1-day reduction in
time to defaecation [98], but with no change in other outcomes. Although one study (n = 49) recently failed to show
a difference of oral magnesium within a well-established
ERAS setting in colonic surgery, no randomised trial has
investigated the use of oral laxatives specifically in rectal
surgery with/without ERAS, so further studies are necessary.
The overall question of whether stimulant laxatives are
associated with anastomotic dehiscence has not been
addressed in a randomised trial of sufficient size.

A multimodal approach to optimising
gut function after rectal resection
should involve oral laxatives.

Postoperative analgesia
Although most of the studies have not distinguished analgesia for colon surgery from that of rectal surgery, some
distinction between the two types of surgery must be made
in view of the extensive tissue dissection with the latter

123

procedure. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge of the
impact of postoperative analgesic techniques when ERAS
is used. For rectal procedures, the considerations shown
below must be taken into account:
The surgical approach for laparotomy can be achieved
with a vertical incision from the umbilicus down or a
horizontal incision. Epidural analgesia is indicated for open
procedures because it provides superior analgesia to systemic opioids [99]. Continuous intravenous infusion of
lidocaine has been shown to spare postoperative use of
opioids [100]. However, no data are available for comparing continuous intravenous lidocaine versus epidural for
postoperative analgesia within an ERAS programme. For
laparoscopy or assisted laparoscopy in which a small horizontal incision is used and in the context of the ERAS
programme, epidural analgesia or continuous intravenous
infusion of lidocaine provided good pain relief in the first
24 h with a similar time to return of bowel function or
LOSH [101].
Abdominoperineal resection includes excision of the
rectal stump, which requires further consideration. These
patients might have preoperative pain partially induced by
neoadjuvant radiotherapy and which might be neuropathic
in nature, thereby requiring a multi-pharmacological
approach. Thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA, inserted at
the T10 level) might not be sufficient to cover the perineal
and sacral incisions, so some arrangements are needed. In
the first instance, addition of morphine to bupivacaine
might increase the spread of anaesthesia and be effective. If
this is not sufficient, another epidural can be inserted at the
lumbar level (L3–4), even if this approach might cause
some motor block in the lower limbs (and therefore might
delay mobilization) and also significantly increase the risk
of urinary retention.
Alternatives are a combination of thoracic epidural
analgesia, infusing only local anesthetic, and systemic
(patient-controlled anaesthesia (PCA)) or oral opioids as
rescue analgesia to control perineal pain. No studies are
available. Continuous infusion of local anesthetics via preperitoneal wound catheters has been shown to provide
satisfactory pain relief and fewer side effects [102]. However, no studies using the ERAS programme are available.
Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks can be used
[103, 104]. There is only limited evidence suggesting the
use of perioperative TAP blocks to reduce opioid consumption and pain scores after abdominal surgery when
compared with systemic opioids or placebo. The side
effects of opioids are not reduced by the use of TAP blocks.
The efficacy of bilateral local anesthetic boluses through a
subcostal TAP block catheter has been compared with
epidural analgesia in only 66 patients undergoing upper
abdominal surgery, without showing major analgesic benefits. However, a comparison has been made with other
analgesic techniques and using the ERAS protocol, but not
in all studies.
Multimodal analgesia with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
has been shown to spare opioid use and side effects by
30 %. Cyclo-oxygenase (Cox)-2 inhibitors can be used
safely in conjunction with epidural anaesthesia. Recently,
two reviews of mainly retrospective studies and work on
animals and humans highlighted a possible association
between ibuprofen, diclofenac and celecoxib and a higher
incidence of anastomotic dehiscence [105, 106]. No studies
have established whether administration of ketamine,
gabapentin or tramadol in the postoperative period impact
positively on postoperative outcome after rectal surgery.
Patients need to be monitored daily by the Acute Pain
Team (whose role is to optimize analgesia to facilitate
mobilisation) to limit the incidence of side effects such as
hypotension, nausea and vomiting.
Summary and
recommendation
TEA is recommended for open rectal
surgery for 48–72 h in view of the
superior quality of pain relief compared
with systemic opioids. Intravenous
administration of lidocaine has also
been shown to provide satisfactory
analgesia, but the evidence in rectal
surgery is lacking. If a laparoscopic
approach is used, epidural or intravenous
lidocaine, in the context of ERAS,
provides adequate pain relief and no
difference in the duration of LOSH and
return of bowel function. Rectal pain can
be of neuropathic origin, and needs to be
treated with multimodal analgesic
methods. There is limited evidence for
the routine use of wound catheters and
continuous TAP blocks in rectal surgery.

24 h will fulfil most nutritional requirements, and little
artificial nutritional support is required. It has been wellestablished that any delay in the resumption of normal oral
diet after major surgery is associated with increased rates
of infectious complications and delayed recovery [107].
Importantly, early oral diet has been shown to be safe in
patients with a new non-diverted colorectal anastomosis
[107]. Meta-analyses highlight an increased risk of vomiting; considerable efforts must be made to prevent postoperative ileus and a risk of aspiration.

Oral nutritional supplements There are no randomised
trials showing whether oral nutritional supplements (ONS)

A large prospective series confirmed that an oral diet
after colorectal resection within an ERAS protocol can be
substantial (&1,200 kcal daily from the first day after
surgery) [108] but in itself cannot prevent postoperative
weight loss (by &3 kg on postoperative day 28). There
may, therefore, be a role for extended routine use of protein-rich supplements in ERAS protocols. Two trials of
perioperative nutritional supplements in the outpatient
phase lasting 4–16 weeks demonstrated significant effects
on postoperative morbidity [109, 110] in general surgical
patients, but another trial did not [111].

Perioperative glycaemic control
Insulin resistance is a physiological response to surgical
injury characterised by impaired uptake of peripheral glucose and accelerated hepatic glucose release, resulting in
hyperglycaemia [112]. Hyperglycaemia is common in noncritically ill postoperative patients with and without a preoperative diagnosis of DM [113] The risk of complications
associated with hyperglycaemia in the surgical patient first
became widely appreciated with publication of an interventional trial of intensive insulin treatment. This demonstrated appreciable reductions in morbidity and mortality
from treatment of hyperglycaemia with insulin in mainly
postoperative patients with planned admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [114]. Subsequent multivariable
regression analyses revealed that lower glucose concentrations were the important factor [115]. A recent multicentre
trial confirmed these findings in the subgroup of patients
with trauma [116]. No subsequent trials of intensive insulin
therapy in surgical patients have been published.
However, there is little doubt that hyperglycaemia is
harmful also in routine perioperative care outside the ICU
[117–119]. There is no high-level evidence on what glycaemic target is appropriate in this setting; expert opinion
only is available. The US Endocrine Society has recommended a pre-meal blood glucose target of \7.8 mmol/l
and a random glucose value of \10.0 mmol/l [120].
Strategies for achieving such targets are evolving.
Intensive insulin treatment is not advised due to the intake
of discrete meals in most patients [120]. The traditional and
still widely used sliding-scale subcutaneous insulin regimen is a reactive rather than preventive strategy, and is not
supported by available clinical evidence [121]. Basal-bolus
subcutaneous insulin therapy was shown to result in better
glycaemic control and lower overall complication rates in
diabetic, non-critically ill surgical patients in a recent
randomised trial [122].
In elective major surgery, there is an opportunity to
prevent or attenuate metabolic responses to surgery, rather
than having to treat them with insulin. Several stressreducing interventions in ERAS attenuate insulin resistance
as single interventions, including preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment [123, 124], epidural blockade [125, 126]
and minimally invasive surgery [127]. If such interventions
are combined in an ERAS protocol, hyperglycaemia can be
avoided even during full enteral feeding starting immediately after major colorectal surgery [128].
Summary and
recommendation
Maintenance of perioperative blood sugar
levels within an expert-defined range
results in better outcomes. Therefore,
insulin resistance and hyperglycemia
should be avoided using stress-reducing
measures or if already established by
active treatment. The level of glycaemia
to target for intervention at the ward level
remains uncertain, and is dependent upon
local safety aspects.

Early mobilisation
Extended bed rest is associated not only with an increase risk
of thromboembolism but also with several unwanted effects
such as insulin resistance, muscle loss, loss of muscle strength,
pulmonary depression, and reduced tissue oxygenation.
Encouraging postoperative early mobilisation is important to avoid patient discomfort (pain and ileus) because
patients must be adequately nursed, keeping their independence as much as possible. Patients should be out of
bed 2 h on the day of surgery, and 6 h per day until hospital discharge [129].

Audit and outcome measures
The evidence of improved outcomes with the implementation of individual elements of ERAS protocols is presented in this paper. We have included more recent studies
undertaken within an ERAS protocol and evaluated the
impact of specific interventions with an ERAS control
cohort. All surgeons in ‘developed countries’ are functioning in an era of: reform of healthcare management;
reduced cost initiatives concomitant with increased patient
safety and providers for improved outcomes mandates; and
pay-for-performance programmes. Incumbent upon perioperative care is the implementation and auditing of care
improvement strategies. During the early reporting of
ERAS, critics of fast-track protocols questioned whether
reported improvement could be due only to increased
observation. The impact of this Hawthorne effect
(improved performance due to known observation) also
brought into question the validity of early reports of
improved outcomes from the US-based Surgical Complications Improvement Program (SCIP) [130]. In many
ways, the SCIP and ERAS protocols as well as the USbased National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
(NSQIP) share the difficult blessing of improved observed
outcomes without clarity as to which variable of care
resulted in the improvement. By implementing the stressreducing elements of perioperative care that have convincing supporting studies, the ERAS programme has
shown outcome improvements over implementation of
single elements into a background of traditional care. For
example, allowing patients to eat on the first postoperative
day was found to be safe [131]. Once an ERAS programme
is in place, however, it is impossible to ‘dissect out’ the use
of immediate ad libitum oral nutrition to determine its
impact on the outcomes observed with the entire protocol
[2]. Quite similar is the finding that compliance with
NSQIP and SCIP interventions resulted in general
improvements in outcomes, but individual elements did not
result in improvements in the outcomes of interest.
Improved compliance with recommended perioperative
antibiotic use did not reduce further the prevalence of
surgical-site infections [130]. Whether or not the individual
components of greatest impact can be defined, auditing is
essential to maintain compliance and to provide a background from which future studies are shaped. Adherence to
an established protocol is proven to be in linear relationship
to improved outcomes [33]. Also, all improvements in the
ERAS programme and ERAS Society protocols have arisen
from database review and compliance auditing [132].
Auditing is necessary. The question is which components
should be strictly recorded and followed, as well as, how
the data are retrieved, stored, shared, and analysed.
As with any intervention, variability exists between
healthcare systems. Many outcomes most easily retrieved
from the medical records are linked to use of health system
resources. Thus, LOSH, overall cost, complications requiring
readmission to hospital, longer operations, need for blood
transfusions, and similar outcomes are often reported. Each of
these may be important or may only be a marker for improved
care. For example, a patient is not actually ‘‘healthier’’
because he/she leaves the hospital 14 h sooner than another,
but he may be recovering with lesser difficulty as witnessed by
meeting discharge criteria sooner. As discussed above, rectal
resections are different from colon resections with respect to
indication, preoperative optimisation of patients, intraoperative challenges, and postoperative needs. This is particularly
true if considering preoperative chemoradiation for malignancy, immunosuppression for inflammatory bowel disease,
previous pelvic surgery, ostomy creation, and flap closures.
Considering these factors, which are not specifically addressed in ERAS studies of colon resection, will create a relative
stratification of perioperative risk factors for a clearer
assessment of the same outcome analysis.
In short, auditing of any change in perioperative care is
prudent and, in some healthcare settings, essential. Occasionally the outcome variable defined by a healthcare
system does not directly define better or worse outcomes,
and care providers need to be involved in these analyses
and care management plans to ensure fair evaluations of
outcomes and the best possible auditing of their work.
The outcomes of interest in rectal resection are essentially the same as those in colon resection. However, there
298 World J Surg (2013) 37:285–305
123

is significant difference in risks for worse outcomes in
rectal resection. Hence, preoperative assessment and definition of risks specific to rectal resection is required.
The best studies of ERAS in rectal resection will be
specific to this population in accrual and auditing. Given
the number of rectal resections compared with colon
resections, few centres have adequate numbers of patients
to independently undertake the rigorous evaluation already
accomplished in ERAS for colon resection. The ongoing
multinational efforts of the ERAS Society Research
Committee, in conjunction with the ERAS Interactive
Audit System, will result in adequate subject numbers to
provide strong outcomes analyses for the pelvic bowel
resection patient group. This system will also act as a
background upon which new interventions may be introduced in randomised or large cohort study design.

Overall traditional versus ERAS care
The principles of ERAS have largely been established on the
basis of elective segmental colonic resection [1]. Initially,
the focus was on open surgery and latterly on laparoscopic
resection. Rectal surgery, however, represents a different
challenge. The magnitude and duration of surgery is longer,
blood loss is greater, the patients may have received preoperative chemoradiation, and the frequent use of a stoma
requires significant educational input. Moreover, the rate of
anastamotic leaks is higher and overall morbidity and mortality greater. On the one hand, this suggests that there may
be even greater gains to be had by adopting optimal nutritional and metabolic care in patients undergoing more major
surgery. On the other hand, traditionalists worry about any
adverse influence of altered practice, especially with respect
to anastamotic integrity. In particular, concerns have been
expressed about the use or lack of use of MBP [23], epidurals, vasopressors, NSAIDs, and laxatives.
Within an enhanced recovery programme for open
colorectal surgery, male sex, preoperative comorbidity and
age [80 years have been shown to be independent determinants of prolonged LOSH and postoperative morbidity
[133]. Such data suggest that, even with enhanced recovery,
rectal surgery represents a greater challenge than colonic
surgery. An international survey of surgeons (123 surgeons
in 28 countries) reported recently that 63 % use enhanced
recovery for rectal cancer [134]. Thus, despite the greater
challenges for ERAS in rectal surgery, the trend seems
towards widespread adoption of ERAS for such patients.
There are no prospective randomised trials that have
specifically focused on the role of ERAS in rectal surgery
alone. All randomised trials that have included rectal surgery have also included an admixture of colonic resections.
The numbers of patients in such studies are relatively small
and even in the context of meta-analyses it has not been
possible to separate the rectal patients [135]. Thus, it is not
possible to be definitive about the influence of traditional
versus ERAS care upon recovery, morbidity or mortality.
However, published case series with retrospective controls
have suggested a consistent reduction in LOSH by
3–5 days whether the resection is undertaken by open or
laparoscopic means [136–138]. There has been no reported
increase in postoperative complications or mortality, suggesting that managing rectal cancer patients within an
ERAS protocol is safe.

Rectal surgery undertaken within an
enhanced recovery programme is safe
and improves recovery as reflected
by a 3–5 day reduction in LOSH.

subsequent savings in reduced LOSH [139, 140] and
reduced complication rates [140]. Furthermore, significant long-term cost savings are possible in ERAS protocols: an average calculated cost saving of NZD 6,900
per patient was reported for 50 consecutive ERAS
patients compared with 50 patients who underwent traditional care [140].
Few significant differences have been reported in terms of
QoL [139, 141], perhaps because health-specific QoL
instruments for perioperative care have been unavailable
and investigators have instead used generic QoL instruments
or instruments developed for certain diagnoses rather than
perioperative care. This is currently being addressed with the
development of well-validated, health-specific abdominal
surgery perioperative QoL scores [142]. Better data are
available on the important phenomenon of postoperative
fatigue, which has been reported to be decreased within
ERAS care in observational studies [143, 144].
Summary and
recommendation
ERAS protocols are cost-neutral or
cost-effective and result in reduced
fatigue. They are recommended as the
current standard of care.

Strong
Improved clinical outcomes: low
Preanesthetic medication No advantages in using long-acting benzodiazepines Moderate Strong
Short-acting benzodiazepines can be used in young patients
before potentially painful interventions (insertion of
spinal or epidural, arterial catheter), but they should not
be used in the elderly (age [60 years)
Prophylaxis against
thromboembolism
Patients should wear well-fitting compression stockings,
and receive pharmacological prophylaxis with LMWH.
Extended prophylaxis for 28 days should be considered
in patients with colorectal cancer or other patients with
increased risk of VTE
High Strong
Antimicrobial prophylaxis Patients should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis before
skin incision in a single dose. Repeated doses may be
necessary depending on the half-life of drug and duration
of surgery
High Strong
Skin preparation A recent RCT has shown that skin preparation with a scrub
of chlorhexidine-alcohol is superior to povidone-iodine
in preventing surgical-site infections [44]
Moderate For skin preparation in
general: Strong
Specific choice of
preparation: Weak
Standard anesthetic
protocol
To attenuate the surgical stress response, intraoperative
maintenance of adequate hemodynamic control, central
and peripheral oxygenation, muscle relaxation, depth of
anesthesia, and appropriate analgesia is strongly
recommended
Epidural: Moderate Epidural: Strong
IV Lidocaine: Weak
IV Lidocaine: Low Remifentanil: Strong
High oxygen concentration:
Strong
Remifentanil: Low
High oxygen concentration: High
PONV Prevention of PONV should be included as standard in
ERAS protocols. More specifically, a multimodal
approach to PONV prophylaxis should be adopted in all
patients with C2 risk factors undergoing major colorectal
surgery. If PONV is present, treatment should be via a
multimodal approach
High-risk patients: High Strong
In all patients: Low
Laparoscopic resection of
benign disease
With proven safety and at least equivocal disease-specific
outcomes, laparoscopic proctectomy and
proctocolectomy for benign disease can be carried out by
an experienced surgeon within an ERAS protocol with the
goals of reduced perioperative stress (manifested by
decreased postoperative ileus), decreased LOSH, and
fewer overall complications
Low Strong
Laparoscopic resection of
rectal cancer
Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is currently not
generally recommended outside of a trial setting (or
specialized centre with ongoing audit) until equivalent
oncologic outcomes are proven

Comment
These guidelines in perioperative care for rectal surgery are
based on the current literature (summarised in Table 2). They
aim to help surgeons and anaesthetists to employ current best
practice to enhance the recovery of patients undergoing major
rectal surgery. The ERAS Society is involved in updating
guidance to support the use of best perioperative care. The
current guidelines are in development from two consensus
papers [1, 145]. We decided to produce separate guidelines for
colonic and rectal resections because there are differences
developing in best practice. The present guidelines were
produced using the GRADE system [4] using strict criteria to
Table 2 continued
Item Recommendation Evidence level Recommendation grade
Preventing intraoperative
hypothermia
Patients undergoing rectal surgery need to have their body
temperature monitored during and after surgery.
Attempts should be made to avoid hyothermia because it
increases the risk of perioperative complications
High Strong
Perioperative fluid
management
Fluid balance should be optimised by targeting cardiac
output and avoiding overhydration. Judicious use of
vasopressors is recommended with arterial hypotension.
Targeted fluid therapy using the oesophageal Doppler
system is recommended
Moderate Strong
Drainage of peritoneal
cavity
Pelvic drains should not be used routinely Low Weak
Transurethral catheter After pelvic surgery with a low estimated risk of
postoperative urinary retention, the transurethral
bladder catheter may be safely removed on postoperative
day 1, even if epidural analgesia is used
Low Weak
Suprapubic catheter In patients with an increased risk of prolonged
postoperative urinary retention, placement of a
suprapubic catheter is recommended
Prolonged catheterisation: Low Weak
Chewing gum A multimodal approach to optimising gut function after
rectal resection should involve chewing gum
Moderate Strong
Postoperative laxatives and
prokinetics
A multimodal approach to optimising gut function after
rectal resection should involve oral laxatives
Low Weak
Postoperative analgesia TEA is recommended for open rectal surgery for 48–72 h in
view of the superior quality of pain relief compared with
systemic opioids. Intravenous administration of lidocaine
has also been shown to provide satisfactory analgesia,
but the evidence in rectal surgery is lacking. If a
laparoscopic approach is used, epidural or intravenous
lidocaine, in the context of ERAS, provides adequate pain
relief and no difference in the duration of LOSH and
return of bowel function. Rectal pain can be of
neuropathic origin, and needs to be treated with
multimodal analgesic methods. There is limited evidence
for the routine use of wound catheters and continuous
TAP blocks in rectal surgery
Epidural for open surgery: High Epidural for open surgery:
Strong
Epidural for laparoscopy: Low Epidural for laparoscopy:
Weak
Intravenous lidocaine: Moderate Intraveous lidocaine: Weak
Wound infiltration and TAP blocks:
Low
Wound infiltration and TAP
blocks: Weak
Early oral intake An oral ad libitum diet is recommended 4 h after rectal
surgery
Moderate Strong
Oral nutritional
supplements
In addition to normal food intake, patients should be
offered ONS to maintain adequate intake of protein and
energy.
Low Strong
Postoperative glucose
control
Maintenance of perioperative blood sugar levels within an
expert-defined range results in better outcomes.
Therefore, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia should
be avoided using stress-reducing measures or if already
established by active treatment. The level of glycaemia to
target for intervention at the ward level remains
uncertain, and is dependent upon local safety aspects
Use of stress-reducing measures:
Moderate
Use of stress-reducing
treatments: Strong
Level of glycemia for insulin
treatment: Low
Insulin treatment (nondiabetics) at the ward level:
Weak
Early mobilisation Patients should be nursed in an environment that
encourages independence and mobilisation. A care plan
that facilitates patients being out of bed for 2 h on the
day of surgery and 6 h thereafter is recommended
Low Strong

determine the levels of evidence. As explained in the methods
section, the reviewers take into consideration the potential
good versus potential harm argument that the treatment may
have when setting the level of the recommendation. This may
allow for strong recommendation even if the data behind the
evidence are of moderate, or even low, quality, but the harm is
considered negligible.
Since the practice of surgery and anesthesia is continuously changing, there is a need for regular updates of the
knowledge base and for continuous training of those
involved in the treatment of surgical patients. The ERAS
Society for Perioperative Care (www.erassociety.org) was
initiated by the former ERAS Study Group and was formed
in 2010 to support these processes. The Society participates
in the improvement of perioperative care by developing
new knowledge through research, education and also by
being involved in the implementation of best practice.
