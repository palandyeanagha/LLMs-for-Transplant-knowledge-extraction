Dear Editor,
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was first
detected in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. The
virus was spreading rapidly to other cities of China and
accumulating cases had been reported (Li et al. 2020). On
March 11, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of SARSCoV-2 as a pandemic. As of June 28, around 10 million
COVID-19 cases have been reported in 216 countries or
territories and the worldwide death toll has passed 490,000
according to data from WHO (https://www.who.int/emer
gencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Until now, there
is no effective drug or vaccine available against SARSCov-2 infection.
In addition to the recent emerged SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the viruses which cause a
global infection and threat public health. In worldwide, the
prevalence of HBsAg is about 3.9% (Polaris Observatory
2018). According to a nationwide epidemiological survey
of population whose ages range from 1 to 59 years in
China, 2006, the prevalence of HBsAg was 7.2% (Liang
et al. 2009). As SARS-CoV-2 and HBV both can cause
liver damage (Fan et al. 2020), further understanding of the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with HBV infection is
urgently required in order to design an optimized treatment
strategy. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection
on HBV patients are still not clear. For example, we do not
yet know whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more
severe in HBV patients and we also do not have much
knowledge about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the course
of HBV infection. In this retrospective study, we investigated the clinical characterizes of the patients coinfected
with SARS-CoV-2 and HBV by analyzing the clinical
records and laboratory tests of 123 COVID-19 patients
admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University,
Wuhan, China, from January 5 to February 20, 2020.
A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in
this study, including 50 males and 73 females. The median
age of total enrolled patients was 51.0 years (IQR,
35.0–66.0; range, 20–96 years). The most common
Xiaoping Chen, Qunqun Jiang and Zhiyong Ma contributed equally to
this work.

symptoms at the onset of illness were: fever (37.4–39.1 C,
69.1%), fatigue (54.5%), cough (50.4%), and myalgia
(32.5%) (Table 1). Other symptoms included dyspnea
(21.1%), headache (17.1%) and diarrhea (16.3%). Among
123 enrolled patients, thirty-five (28.5%) cases had at least
one underlying comorbidity such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, malignancy, COPD or liver
cirrhosis. Around 12.2% (15/123) of patients were also
suffering from HBV infection. There were more males than
females (10:5) co-infected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2
(P = 0.0469, Table 1). The treatment for COVID-19
patients was mainly supportive. Ninety patients were given
the antiviral (oral arbidol and/or lopinavir). Seventy-four
patients were offered with oxygen support and antibiotic
therapy (both orally and intravenous). Sixty-one patients
received corticosteroids to suppress an excessive inflammatory activation. There is no significant difference of
treatments between patients with and without HBV infection (Table 1).
Laboratory results indicated that the level of total
bilirubin was higher in patients with HBV infection
(P = 0.0178, Table 1). The blood counts of the patients
with or without HBV infection showed lymphopenia
(\ 1.3 9 109
/L, Table 1). Fifteen COVID-19 patients were
examined to be HBsAg positive (5 females and 10 males).
The data of anti-HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg and antiHBcAg were available for 11 patients with 10 HBeAg
negative and one positive. HBV-DNA was detected in 13
patients. The HBV-DNA level of 10 patients was more
than 20 IU/mL. Among the 15 patients, two patients have
cirrhosis; three patients were treated with nucleoside analogue (oral entecavir, 0.5 mg, once daily) during the retrospective investigation period (Table 2).
Among 15 COVID-19 patients with HBV infection, 11
patients (73.4%) were discharged from the hospital
according to the guideline; two patients (13.3%) were still
hospitalized and the other two patients (13.3%) were dead.
The causes of death are upper gastrointestinal bleeding and
Intestinal bleeding respectively (Supplementary Table S1).
In the group of 108 COVID-19 patients without HBV
infection, ninety-nine patients (91.6%) were discharged
from hospital while 6 patients (5.6%) were still hospitalized. Three patients (2.8%) without HBV infection were
dead due to respiratory failure (Table 1, Supplementary
Table S1). The detailed information of five dead patients
was shown in Supplementary Table S1.
In line with previous observations (Chen et al. 2020;
Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2020; Wang
et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Zhang et al.
2020), we found that in COVID-19 cases without HBV
infection about 50.9% (55/108) patients have the dysfunction of liver symptoms by measuring the level of ALT,
AST, TBIL, GGT, and ALP during the disease progress.
Furthermore, we uncovered patients with HBV infection
had a higher rate of liver cirrhosis (P = 0.0390, Table 1).

developed to the severe situation while the percentage of
severe cases was much lower (24.1%) in the COVID-19
patients without HBV infection. Two of seven severe HBV
and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients had cirrhosis
whereas the percentage was one out of 26 in the cases of
severe COVID-19 without HBV infection.
In the enrolled cases, we also discovered that there was a
higher incidence of abnormal liver function (27/33, 81.8%)
in severe COVID-19 patients than did in mild cases
(43.3%, 39/90, data not shown), which agrees with the
study that lower incidence of AST abnormality was found
in the cases diagnosed by CT scan on the subclinical stage
than in the COVID-19 patients who were confirmed after
onset of symptom (Shi et al. 2020). Therefore, liver function could be considered as one factor to indicate the
progress of COVID-19.
In our research, 21.8% of (7/33) COVID-19 severe
patients were found to coinfect with HBV infection. It has
been suggested that liver impairment in COVID-19
patients could be due to the direct attack of the virus or
resulted by other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic
inflammation (Zhang et al. 2020). Detecting the viral RNA
or viral particles from liver biopsies of COVID-19 patients
will be helpful to elucidate if virus can infect liver tissue.
Our results pointed out that as high as 47% (7/15) of HBV
patients were identified as severe COVID-19 cases. It is
more likely that HBV patients would suffer from more
severe situation during the disease progress when they were
encountered with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our enrolled
cases, two patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection died on admission. One patient died from severe liver
disease, haptic sclerosis. And the other died from intestinal
hemorrhage, which seems to be associated with the
impairment of gastrointestinal tract. More coinfection case
analyses are required to further understand whether SARSCoV-2 infection aggregates the progress of pre-existing
disease and thereby cause death.
