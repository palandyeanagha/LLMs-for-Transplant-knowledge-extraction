ABSTRACT
ATTR amyloidosis is caused by systemic deposition of transthyretin (TTR) and comprises
ATTRwt (wt for wild-type) amyloidosis, ATTRv
(v for variant) amyloidosis, and acquired ATTR
amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation.
ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been regarded as cardiomyopathy found in the elderly,
whereas carpal tunnel syndrome has also
become a major initial manifestation. The
phenotypes of ATTRv amyloidosis are diverse
and include neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and
oculoleptomeningeal involvement as the predominant features, depending on the mutation
and age of onset. In addition to variant TTR, the
deposition of wild-type TTR plays a significant
role, even in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis.
The formation of amyloid fibrils tends to occur
in association with the basement membrane.
The thickening or reduplication of the basement membrane surrounding endoneurial
microvessels, which is similar to diabetic neuropathy, is observed in ATTRv amyloidosis,
suggesting that common mechanisms, such as
an accumulation of advanced glycation end
products, may participate in the disease process.
In addition to direct damage caused by amyloid
fibrils, recent studies have suggested that the
toxicity of nonfibrillar TTRs, such as TTR oligomers, participates in the process of tissue
damage. Although liver transplantation has
been performed for patients with ATTRv amyloidosis since 1990, late-onset patients were not
eligible for this treatment. However, as the
efficacy of orally administered tafamidis and
diflunisal, which stabilize TTR tetramers, was
suggested in the early 2010s, such late-onset
patients have also become targets for diseasemodifying therapies. Additionally, recent studies of small interfering RNA (patisiran) and
antisense oligonucleotide (inotersen) therapies
have demonstrated the efficacy of these genesilencing agents. A strategy for monitoring
patients that enables the choice of an appropriate treatment from comprehensive and longterm viewpoints should be established. As many
patients with ATTR amyloidosis are aged and
have heart failure, they are at increased risk of
aggravation if they are infected by SARS-CoV2.
The optimal interval of evaluation should also
be considered, particularly in this COVID-19
era.

Key Summary Points
ATTR amyloidosis comprises ATTRwt
amyloidosis, ATTRv amyloidosis, and
acquired ATTR amyloidosis after domino
liver transplantation.
ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been
regarded as cardiomyopathy found in the
elderly, whereas carpal tunnel syndrome
has also been recognized as the major
manifestation of this disease.
The phenotypes of ATTRv amyloidosis are
diverse and include neuropathy,
cardiomyopathy, and
oculoleptomeningeal involvement as the
predominant features, depending on the
mutation and age of onset.
In addition to variant TTR, the deposition
of wild-type TTR plays a significant role
even in ATTRv amyloidosis, particularly in
patients with late-onset Val30Met ATTR
amyloidosis.
The reduplication of the basement
membrane surrounding endoneurial
microvessels, which is similar to diabetic
neuropathy, suggests that common
mechanisms, such as an accumulation of
advanced glycation end products, may
participate in the disease process.
In addition to direct damage caused by
amyloid fibrils, nonfibrillar TTRs, such as
TTR oligomers, participate in the process
of tissue damage.
As new disease-modifying therapies, such
as TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing
agents, have become available, the need
for early diagnosis of patients with ATTR
amyloidosis is increasing.

INTRODUCTION
Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein mainly produced in the liver and functions as a transporter
of thyroxin (T4) and retinol (vitamin A)-binding protein [1]. ATTR amyloidosis is a gain-oftoxic function protein-misfolding disease in
which amyloidogenic TTR assembles into amyloid fibrils in extracellular spaces, leading to
systemic organ dysfunction [2]. The nomenclature committee of the International Society of
Amyloidosis has defined two major forms of
ATTR amyloidosis: wild-type ATTR amyloidosis
designated ATTRwt (wt for wild-type) amyloidosis and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis named
ATTRv (v for variant) amyloidosis [3], although
these are traditionally called senile systemic
amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy, respectively. In addition, another
ATTR amyloidosis has been reported in patients
who received livers from ATTRv amyloidosis
donors [4], which is referred to as acquired
ATTR amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation. Owing to the recent increase in
awareness and progress in diagnostic techniques for this disease, the number of newly
diagnosed patients has increased significantly,
leading to an expansion of the clinical spectrum
of ATTR amyloidosis [1, 5]. As the recent
development of disease-modifying therapies for
ATTR amyloidosis such as TTR stabilizers and
gene-silencing agents is outstanding, the need
for early diagnosis of patients with this disease
is increasing. Hence, understanding the clinical
spectrum and management based on the
pathophysiology of this disease is important.

In this review, we discuss the clinical spectrum, pathogenesis, and disease-modifying
therapies of ATTR amyloidosis, particularly
focusing on recent developments in these
aspects. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies
with human participants or animals performed
by any of the authors.
CLINICAL SPECTRUM
ATTRwt Amyloidosis
ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been regarded as cardiomyopathy found in elderly individuals, particularly men [6]. Studies of autopsy
specimens revealed that a significant proportion
of the elderly population has wild-type TTR
deposition in the heart, even in subjects without a history of underlying diseases [6, 7]. A
recent development in diagnostic techniques
revealed that cardiomyopathy resulting from
ATTRwt amyloidosis is an important differential
diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [8, 9]. ATTRwt amyloidosis may
also present features suggestive of carpal tunnel
syndrome that frequently precede those of cardiomyopathy [10]. Analyses of tenosynovial
tissues obtained at carpal tunnel release surgery
revealed that a significant proportion of
patients diagnosed with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome had wild-type TTR amyloid
deposits [11]. It should be noted that both cardiomyopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome due
to ATTRwt amyloidosis tend to affect elderly
male patients [10]. Other studies have also
suggested an association between spinal canal
stenosis and wild-type TTR deposition in ligaments [12, 13]. These findings may suggest the
tendency of TTR to deposit in organs affected by
shear stress [14].
In addition, a recent report described three
patients with myopathy resulting from ATTRwt
amyloidosis [15]. Myopathy was the predominant feature in these patients and the initial
manifestation of ATTRwt amyloidosis in two of
these patients. Notably, serum creatine kinase
levels were normal or only slightly elevated in
these patients. This report further expands the
spectrum of ATTRwt amyloidosis and increases
the need for physicians’ awareness of this disease at the time of differential diagnosis of
myopathy [16].
ATTRv Amyloidosis
A concept regarding the clinical features of
ATTRv amyloidosis has been established on the
basis of patients with Val30Met (p.Val50Met,
according to the Human Genome Variation
Society recommendation) mutation from conventional endemic foci of Portugal and Japan
[1, 2]. These factors consist of an onset age from
the late 20s to early 40s, an almost 1:1 male-tofemale ratio, predominant impairment of
superficial sensations compared to deep sensations that is alternatively called sensory dissociation, marked autonomic dysfunctions, and
cardiac conduction disturbances that require
pacemaker implantation [17, 18]. Despite having the same Val30Met mutation, patients from
Sweden, where another well-known endemic
focus alongside Portugal and Japan is present,
exhibit a later age of onset than conventional
Portuguese and Japanese patients [19]. In addition, recent reports revealed the presence of
late-onset (over 50 years of age) patients with
the same Val30Met mutation even in nonendemic areas [17, 20]. The clinical features of
these late-onset Val30Met patients from
nonendemic areas are distinct from early-onset
cases from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan
because they tend to manifest loss of all sensory
modalities, mild autonomic dysfunctions, and
heart failure resulting from massive cardiac
amyloid deposition [17, 21]. Extreme male preponderance, which is similar to ATTRwt amyloidosis, also characterizes late-onset Val30Met
patients from nonendemic areas [20]. If the
patients do not receive the disease-modifying
therapies described later, the mean survival
time in the early-onset Val30Met patients from
endemic foci is 12.6 years [22], whereas it is
much shorter (7.3 years) in the late-onset
Val30Met patients from nonendemic areas [23].
Although Val30Met is considered the most
common mutation among patients predominantly manifesting neuropathy [1, 18, 24],
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333 319

recent developments in diagnostic techniques
led to the discovery of many patients with
mutations other than Val30Met (i.e., nonVal30Met mutations) in the TTR gene, in which
more than 130 mutations have been reported
[1, 25]. Cardiomyopathy may be the predominant feature in some of the patients carrying
non-Val30Met mutations [18, 26]. For example,
the Val122Ile (p.Val142Ile) mutation is considered a common cause of heart disease in African
Americans originating from West African
countries [27, 28]. Although the main source of
TTR that circulates systemically is the liver, it is
also synthesized by the choroid plexus and
retinal pigment epithelium, which may lead to
the occurrence of oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis [29]. In addition, a recent report
revealed that myopathy could also become
conspicuous in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis [15]. A patient who developed myopathy
3 years after liver transplantation for the treatment of ATTRv amyloidosis has also been
described [15].
Acquired ATTR Amyloidosis After Domino
Liver Transplantation
As TTR is produced mainly in the liver, liver
transplantation has been established as a treatment for ATTRv amyloidosis [30]. Because the
liver removed from patients with ATTRv amyloidosis functions well except for the production of variant TTR, it may be transplanted into
a patient with severe liver disease because of the
shortage of donor livers [4]. This domino liver
transplantation was first performed in 1995 [4].
A total of 1254 domino liver transplantations
were performed worldwide from 1995 to 2017
[31]. However, as time passes and the number of
patients who have undergone domino liver
transplantation increases, patients with symptoms suggesting amyloidosis have been reported [32–34]. Analysis of a patient who received
an ATTRv amyloidosis liver 8 years before
autopsy demonstrated that systemic amyloid
deposition occurs even before the appearance of
symptoms associated with amyloidosis [35].
The mean duration between domino liver
transplantation and the first detection of
amyloid deposition and symptom onset in
recipients is approximately 8 years [31]. Notably, the clinical features of acquired ATTR
amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation
are different from those of donors [31].
Although liver transplantation is usually performed to treat early-onset Val30Met ATTR
amyloidosis cases from endemic foci, recipients
of their livers tend to complain of only sensory
deficits but not autonomic symptoms, even
though they are not elderly [32–34]. These features are similar to those in patients with lateonset Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis from
nonendemic areas, rather than conventional
early-onset patients from endemic foci with
marked autonomic dysfunctions [17, 21]. These
findings may support the view that late-onset
Val30Met cases prevalent throughout the world
are the prototype of ATTRv amyloidosis [36].
PATHOGENESIS
Misfolding and Aggregation of TTR
TTR is stable in its homotetrameric form, and
the dissociation of tetramers into monomers
causes misfolding of TTR, resulting in aggregation into amyloid fibrils [1, 37]. Most TTR
mutations result in the production of variant
TTR that is more unstable compared to wildtype TTR [38], whereas dissociation and subsequent aggregation may also occur even in wildtype TTR [39]. This wild-type TTR deposition
plays a significant role in not only ATTRwt
amyloidosis but also ATTRv amyloidosis. For
example, wild-type TTR consists of more than
half of cardiac amyloid deposits from late-onset
Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis [40]. In patients
with ATTRv amyloidosis who underwent liver
transplantation, cardiac amyloidosis may progress even after transplantation as a result of
wild-type TTR deposition, particularly in elderly
male patients [41, 42].
In addition to the full-length TTR, C-terminal fragments, starting at approximately amino
acid position 50, are also found in amyloid fibrils from patients with ATTRwt, late-onset
Val30Met ATTR, and most non-Val30Met ATTR
amyloidosis [43, 44]. The presence of
320 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333

C-terminal fragments suggests that proteolytic
cleavage of TTR also destabilizes native tetrameric structures and accelerates TTR misfolding
and subsequent aggregation [45].
Evolution of TTR into Amyloid Fibrils
Despite an accumulation of knowledge
obtained from in vitro experiments, studies
demonstrating the chronological sequence of
how amyloid fibrils are formed from dissociated
TTR monomers in vivo are still scarce [46]. Some
studies examining materials obtained from
animal models or patients with ATTRv amyloidosis indicated that the deposition of nonfibrillar TTR occurs before amyloid fibril formation
[21, 46–49]. On electron microscopy, amorphous electron-dense extracellular materials
probably containing nonfibrillar TTR have been
demonstrated (Fig. 1) [1, 46]. A study of nerve

particularly at the vicinity of a collection of collagen fibers
(circular structures with a diameter of 50–70 nm). Aggregations of small dotty structures (arrows) are often
observed among these amorphous materials, suggesting
that nonfibrillar oligomeric intermediates are formed
during the process of amyloid fibril formation. Mature
amyloid fibrils are indicated by arrowheads. Scale bar

biopsy samples from patients with ATTRv
amyloidosis revealed that such amorphous
materials were particularly abundant in the
subperineurial space and in the vicinity of
endoneurial microvessels [46]. As small dotty
structures are often observed among these
amorphous materials, nonfibrillar oligomeric
intermediates are thought to be formed during
the process of amyloid fibril formation [46].
A previous study of cardiac amyloid deposits
suggested that TTR aggregation into fibrillar
structures tends to occur in association with
basement membrane because the expression of
basement membrane components, such as collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin, increased in
parallel with the accumulation of amyloid fibrils [50]. Studies of nerve biopsy specimens also
revealed that amyloid fibrils were frequently
found at or around basement membranes surrounding endoneurial microvessels or Schwann
cells (Fig. 2) [46, 51]. In nerve biopsy specimens
from patients with ATTRv amyloidosis,

thickening or reduplication of basement membranes, particularly those surrounding endoneurial microvessels, is occasionally observed
(Fig. 3) [52]. The reduplication of basement
membranes surrounding endoneurial
microvessels has been considered a unique feature in diabetic neuropathy [53]. In diabetes
mellitus, an accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) leads to the reduplication of the vascular basement membrane via
alteration of the properties of collagen [54]. As
AGEs have also been demonstrated to be associated with the distribution of amyloid deposits
in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis [55], they
may play a role in promoting amyloid fibril
formation.

that in diabetic neuropathy patients, is frequently observed,

Tissue Damage Resulting from Amyloid
Deposition
The deposition of amyloid in extracellular
spaces has been thought to affect various organs
in ATTR amyloidosis. The impact of amyloid
deposition on neighboring tissues differs
depending on the morphology of amyloid fibrils in individual cases [46, 51]. Amyloid fibrils
in patients with conventional early-onset
Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis from endemic foci
tend to evolve into long and thick fibers possessing the textbook characteristics of amyloid
deposits with a good affinity to Congo red
accompanied by strong birefringence under
polarized light (Fig. 4a–c) [40, 51]. By contrast,
amyloid fibrils remain shorter and finer in
patients with other forms of ATTR amyloidosis
(i.e., late-onset Val30Met, non-Val30Met, and
wild-type) (Fig. 4d) [40, 43, 46]. Amyloid
deposits in these patients tend to show weak
affinity to Congo red, resulting in weak birefringence under polarized light (Fig. 4e, f)
[40, 43].

amyloid fibrils in patients with early-onset

and thick on electron microscopy (a). On light microscopy, amyloid deposits tend to be highly congophilic
(b) and exhibit a strong apple-green birefringence (c) in
early-onset patients from endemic foci. Atrophy and
degeneration of myocardial cells result in the formation
of amyloid rings (arrowhead). In late-onset patients from
nonendemic areas, amyloid fibrils are generally short and
thin on electron microscopy (d). Circular structures with a
diameter of 50–70 nm are collagen fibers. On light
microscopy, amyloid deposits are generally weakly congophilic (e) and exhibit a faint apple-green birefringence
(f) in late-onset patients from nonendemic areas. Scale bars

324 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333

Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis from endemic foci
on surrounding tissues seems to be more conspicuous than that of short and fine (i.e., small)
amyloid fibrils in other patients with ATTR
amyloidosis [46, 51]. For example, large fibrils
in the nerve seemed to pull neighboring tissues
during their maturation, resulting in distortion
and atrophy of Schwann cells, particularly those
associated with small-diameter nerve fibers
(Fig. 5a, b) [46, 51]. By contrast, the influence of
small fibrils on neighboring tissues seemed to be
less than that of large fibrils (Fig. 5c) [46, 51]. In
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333 325

the heart, a direct invasion of large fibrils
induces atrophy and degeneration of myocardial cells, inducing cardiac conduction abnormalities in patients with early-onset Val30Met
ATTR amyloidosis from endemic foci (Fig. 4b)
[21], whereas an influence of short fibrils in the
other types of ATTR amyloidosis on myocardial
cells is less conspicuous even though massive
amyloid deposition induces diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 4e) [21].
Possible Impact of Nonfibrillar TTR
Although the concept that amyloid fibrils
themselves induce damage to surrounding tissues is widely accepted, recent studies suggest
that nonfibrillar TTR also affects tissues in
patients with ATTR amyloidosis [2]. In particular, the toxicity of TTR oligomers formed during
the process of amyloid fibril formation has been
suggested [48, 56]. To support this view, studies
using schwannoma or neuroblastoma cell lines
demonstrated the toxic effects of nonfibrillar
TTR [47, 57–59]. Animal models using
Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila also
demonstrated the neurotoxicity of TTR despite
the absence of fibrillar amyloid deposition
[59, 60]. As the amount of endoneurial amyloid
deposition is smaller relative to the extent of
nerve fiber loss in patients with late-onset
Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis compared to
patients with early-onset Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis [21], the toxicity of nonfibrillar TTR
may participate in the process of neurodegeneration in some of the patients with ATTR
amyloidosis, such as those with late-onset
Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis.
Nonfibrillar TTR also seems to play an
important role in enhancing the leakage of circulating TTR into extracellular spaces by
affecting endothelial cells of blood vessels,
which are always exposed to TTR in the bloodstream [51]. In vitro studies suggested that both
wild-type TTR and variant TTR regulate
endothelial cell functions [61, 62]. Studies of
microangiopathy associated with diabetes mellitus have also provided evidence regarding the
regulation of endothelial cell functions by TTR
[63, 64]. A study of sural nerve biopsy specimens
from patients with ATTRv amyloidosis demonstrated that abnormalities of endoneurial
microvessels, including the disruption of
blood–nerve barriers, occurred before the initiation of amyloid deposition [51]. Magnetic resonance neurography demonstrated swelling of
the nerve trunk in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis, even asymptomatic carriers, indicating
the presence of edema resulting from blood–-
nerve barrier disruption [65]. Cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging also revealed gadolinium
enhancement in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis [66]. These findings indicate that the
leakage of serum components, including TTR
produced by the liver, into extracellular spaces
of various organs occurs as a result of endothelial cell dysfunction before the initiation of
amyloid fibril formation.
DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES
Liver Transplantation
Currently available therapeutic approaches for
ATTR amyloidosis consist of a reduction in wildtype/variant TTR and stabilization of circulating
TTR to prevent dissociation of tetramers into
monomers [1, 2]. As the main source of circulating TTR is the liver, liver transplantation has

been performed since 1990 in patients with
ATTRv amyloidosis [30]. Long-term efficacy
from the viewpoint of survival has been proven,
particularly in conventional early-onset Val30-
Met patients from endemic foci [67]. A retrospective analysis of the data obtained from the
Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy World
Transplant Registry suggested an early age of
onset, short disease duration, and Val30Met
mutation to be better predictors for survival
[68]. However, the progression of cardiomyopathy and neuropathy resulting from wildtype TTR deposition may occur even after liver
transplantation, particularly in late-onset male
patients, resulting in poor prognosis after liver
transplantation in these patients
[41, 42, 69, 70].
TTR Stabilizers
As the dissociation of TTR tetramers into
monomers is the crucial step for the subsequent
process of protein misfolding and amyloid fibril
formation [1, 2], an approach to stabilize the
native quaternary structure of TTR tetramers
using small molecules that bind to thyroxinbinding sites has been proposed as a potential
approach for the treatment of not only ATTRv
amyloidosis but also ATTRwt amyloidosis
[71, 72]. In the early 2010s, randomized controlled trials suggested the efficacy of two orally
administered TTR stabilizers (i.e., tafamidis and
diflunisal) for ameliorating the progression of
neuropathy in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis
[73, 74]. As these TTR-stabilizing drugs can be
administered orally, patients with late-onset
ATTRv amyloidosis who were not eligible for
liver transplantation also became targets for
disease-modifying treatment. Another recent
randomized controlled trial suggested the efficacy of tafamidis even for cardiomyopathy
resulting from both ATTRv and ATTRwt amyloidosis [75].
Tafamidis is an analogue of thyroxine
designed to stabilize TTR tetramers [25]. A
phase III clinical trial involving 128 patients
with early-stage Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis
who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive tafamidis (tafamidis meglumine) 20 mg
once daily or placebo for 18 months suggested
that tafamidis delayed the progression of neuropathy, although the primary endpoint could
not be achieved [73]. An open-label extension
study for up to 6 years also demonstrated the
slowing of neuropathy progression without any
unexpected adverse events [76]. In particular,
patients who continued to receive tafamidis had
less progression of neuropathy than those who
switched to tafamidis following 18 months of
placebo, warranting the need for early intervention [76]. In addition to its efficacy on
neuropathy, the efficacy of tafamidis on cardiomyopathy due to not only ATTRv amyloidosis but also ATTRwt amyloidosis was
suggested by a recent phase III clinical trial
involving 441 patients with ATTR amyloidosis
[75]. This study included 335 patients with
ATTRwt amyloidosis and 106 patients with
ATTRv amyloidosis who were randomly
assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive 80 mg of
tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for
30 months and demonstrated reduced mortality
and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations.
Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that also acts to stabilize TTR [72]. A
study involving 130 patients with ATTRv amyloidosis who were randomly assigned in a 1:1
ratio to receive 250 mg of diflunisal twice daily
or placebo for 2 years suggested that diflunisal
can slow the progression of neuropathy,
although 67 patients (27 diflunisal patients and
40 placebo patients) discontinued the treatment
before completing the 2-year protocol [74]. The
demographics of patients in this study were
different from those in the phase III trial of
tafamidis for neuropathy in patients with
ATTRv amyloidosis [73] because it included
patients with relatively late disease onset, various disease severities, and non-Val30Met
mutation.
Gene-Silencing Drugs
Theoretically, preventing the production of TTR
efficiently ameliorates systemic organ dysfunction in ATTR amyloidosis because it not only
prevents amyloid fibril formation but also suppresses an increase in toxic amyloid precursors,
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333 327

such as TTR oligomers [2]. As described earlier,
TTR seems to exert harmful effects even when
fibrillar structures recognized as amyloid fibrils
are not formed. Given that circulating variant
TTR may induce microangiopathy, which plays
a role as an initial lesion of organ damage [51], a
strategy that eliminates circulating TTR is more
reasonable than liver transplantation and TTR
stabilizers [2]. This strategy became a reality
with the development of gene-silencing therapeutics, including small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)
[1]. In 2018, two randomized controlled trials of
such gene-silencing agents (patisiran and inotersen) demonstrated an efficacy on neuropathy
in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis [77, 78].
Patisiran is an RNA interference therapeutic
comprising siRNA formulated in a lipid
nanoparticle that is predominantly delivered to
the liver and reduces TTR production [1]. In a
phase III trial, 225 patients with ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were randomly
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive patisiran
intravenously (0.3 mg/kg of body weight) or
placebo once every 3 weeks [77]. The results of
this study were excellent because all endpoints,
including the scores related to somatic and
autonomic neuropathies, quality of life score,
and exploratory cardiac measures, were better in
patients who received patisiran than in those
who received placebo. In particular, even an
improvement of primary outcome measures
represented by neuropathy impairment and
quality of life scores was seen in more than half
of the patients receiving patisiran.
Inotersen is a second-generation ASO
designed to reduce the production of TTR [79].
Parenterally administered ASO, in general, is
rapidly transferred into various organs, with the
highest concentration in the liver and kidneys
[80]. A phase III trial involving 172 patients
with ATTRv amyloidosis who were randomly
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of inotersen (300 mg) or
placebo for 15 months demonstrated significantly better primary endpoints represented by
neuropathy impairment and quality of life
scores [78]. Because glomerulonephritis and
thrombocytopenia were reported as severe
adverse events, close monitoring of renal
function and platelet count is required in
patients receiving inotersen.
SUMMARY
ATTR amyloidosis comprises ATTRwt amyloidosis, ATTRv amyloidosis, and acquired ATTR
amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation.
ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been regarded as cardiomyopathy found in elderly individuals, whereas carpal tunnel syndrome has
also been recognized as a major manifestation
of this disease [11]. In addition, a recent report
suggested that myopathy has become a predominant feature in ATTRwt amyloidosis [15].
For ATTRv amyloidosis, the clinical phenotypes
are diverse and include neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and oculoleptomeningeal involvement
as the predominant features depending on the
mutation and age of onset [1, 2]. Patients from
conventional endemic foci in Portugal and
Japan have the Val30Met mutation and are
characterized by an early age of onset, predominant loss of superficial sensation, marked
autonomic dysfunctions, and cardiac conduction disturbances that require pacemaker
implantation [17, 21]. Features in patients with
Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis from nonendemic
areas are distinct in terms of late age of onset,
loss of all sensory modalities, mild autonomic
dysfunctions, and heart failure resulting from
massive cardiac amyloid deposition [17, 21].
Clinical features in patients with acquired ATTR
amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation
are similar to patients with late-onset Val30Met
ATTR amyloidosis from nonendemic areas [31].
In addition to variant TTR, the deposition of
wild-type TTR plays a significant role even in
ATTRv amyloidosis, particularly in patients
with late-onset Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis
[40]. In addition to full-length TTR, C-terminal
fragments are found in amyloid fibrils from
patients with ATTRwt, late-onset Val30Met
ATTR, and most non-Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis, suggesting the importance of proteolytic
cleavage of TTR during the process of amyloid
fibril formation in these types of ATTR amyloidosis [43, 44]. The formation of amyloid fibrils
tends to occur in association with the basement
328 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:317–333

membrane. Moreover, the reduplication of the
basement membrane surrounding endoneurial
microvessels, which is similar to diabetic neuropathy, is occasionally observed in patients
with ATTRv amyloidosis [52], suggesting that
common mechanisms, such as an increased
production of AGEs, may participate in the
disease process. Amyloid fibrils are usually large
in patients with early-onset Val30Met ATTR
amyloidosis from endemic foci, whereas they
tend to be small in patients with other ATTR
amyloidosis [46, 51]. The influence of large
amyloid fibrils on surrounding tissues seems to
be more conspicuous than that of small amyloid fibrils [46]. As the amount of endoneurial
amyloid deposition is smaller relative to the
extent of nerve fiber loss in patients with lateonset Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis compared to
patients with early-onset Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis [21], the toxicity of nonfibrillar TTR,
such as TTR oligomers, may participate in the
process of neurodegeneration in these patients.
Currently available therapeutic approaches
for ATTR amyloidosis consist of a reduction in
wild-type/variant TTR and stabilization of circulating TTR to prevent the dissociation of tetramers into monomers [1, 2]. Although liver
transplantation has been performed since 1990
in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis [30], lateonset patients were not eligible for this treatment. As the efficacy of orally administered TTR
stabilizers was suggested in the early 2010s
[73, 74], such late-onset patients also became
targets for disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, recent phase III trials of intravenous
administration of siRNA and subcutaneous
administration of ASO have also demonstrated
the efficacy of these gene-silencing agents
[77, 78]. A strategy for monitoring patients that
enables the choice of an appropriate treatment
from comprehensive and long-term viewpoints
should be established. As many patients with
ATTR amyloidosis are aged and have heart failure, they are at increased risk of aggravation if
they are infected by SARS-CoV2. The optimal
interval of evaluation should be considered,
particularly in this COVID-19 era.
