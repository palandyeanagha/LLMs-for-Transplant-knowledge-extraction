Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated 
with increased liver-related morbidity and mortality rates, accelerated progression to end-stage renal disease, and risk of cardiovascular events. CKD patients 
with HCV infection require antiviral therapy. Pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus 
ribavirin was the standard of care for HCV-infected CKD patients before the introduction of first-generation direct-acting antiviral (DAA) oral anti-HCV agents. 
Peg-IFN-based treatment has a low virologic response rate and poor compliance, 
resulting in a high dropout rate. Recently, several clinical trials of all-DAA combination regimens have reported excellent antiviral efficacy and few adverse drug 
reactions in HCV-infected patients with CKD. These positive results have revolutionized the treatment of chronic HCV infection in this population. In this 
review, we address the impact of chronic HCV infection in CKD patients, and 
discuss their management using next-generation DAAs.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with 
high rates of liver-related morbidities and mortality. 
Public interest in HCV is growing, as more than 180 
million people, 2.8% of the global population, are infected with HCV [1,2]. The hepatic complications of 
HCV infection including liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma are well 
documented. However, 40% to 70% of cases of HCV infection are accompanied by extrahepatic manifestations 
such as autoimmune, metabolic, renal, cardiovascular, 
central nervous system, and lymphoproliferative disorders [3-5]. Kidney disease in particular is a common extrahepatic manifestation of HCV infection. Chronic 
HCV infection is related not only to chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) but also accelerates renal deterioration, 
leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [6-8]. In addition, HCV infection increases the morbidity and mortality rates of both dialysis patients and kidney transplant (KT) recipients [9-11]. Conventional interferon 
(INF)-based therapy for HCV infection has a relatively 
low virologic response rate and poor tolerability in 
CKD patients [12,13]. The recent development of novel 
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has revolutionized 
the treatment of HCV infection (Table 1), especially for 
CKD patients, a difficult to treat population. 
In this review, we address the clinical impact of HCV 
infection in patients with CKD including predialysis 
patients, those on dialysis, and KT recipients. We also 
provide a brief overview of conventional therapies and 
discuss novel antiviral therapies for HCV infection.

CLINICAL IMPACT OF HCV INFECTION IN CKD 
PATIENTS
HCV in patients with CKD
Although patients with CKD, who are immunocompromised, are expected to have a high prevalence of HCV 
infection, few large-scale epidemiologic studies in diverse geographical locations involving predialysis patients with CKD have been performed. A recent study 
in Taiwan by Lee et al. [14] reported a 7.6% prevalence 
of HCV infection in 4,185 predialysis patients with 
CKD. In this study, the prevalence of HCV increased 
with CKD stage, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of 
ESRD was 52.6% and 38.4% in patients with CKD with 
and without HCV infection, respectively. However, another Taiwanese study reported that the prevalence of 
CKD is higher in patients with than without HCV infection (5.46% vs. 3.43%, respectively), with an adjusted 
hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.12 to 1.46) [15]. These results suggest a correlation between HCV and renal function, indicating that HCV 
infection can lead to CKD and promote progression 
from CKD to ESRD. Various hepatic and/or extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection can contribute to 
renal deterioration. Insulin resistance is associated with 
HCV-induced hepatic dysfunction and has been found

in 10% to 60% of HCV-infected patients [16-18]. However, recent experimental studies have demonstrated that 
the HCV core protein interferes with insulin signaling 
by degrading insulin receptor substrate-1 by upregulating the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, suppressor 
of cytokine signaling 3, and tumor necrosis factor-α
[19,20]; and downregulating glucose transporter 2,4 expression through upregulation of glucose-6-phosphatase 
and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 [21,22]. Sciacqua et al. [23] reported higher fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
and triglyceride levels in HCV-infected patients and a 
significant correlation between the HOMA-IR and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Insulin resistance is also correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
hyperlipidemia, leading to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in HCV-infected patients. This implies 
that insulin resistance and its vascular complications directly and/or indirectly promote renal deterioration. 
Chronic HCV infection induces an immune response 
and a direct cytopathic effect. HCV can enter and replicate in hepatocytes and B-lymphocytes. HCV envelope 2 
protein can bind to the CD81 transmembrane 4 family 
glycoprotein on B-lymphocytes, resulting in their activation [24]. Moreover, the HCV nonstructural (NS) region 5A and core protein, which mimic auto-antigens, 
can stimulate B-lymphocytes. Persistently stimulated 
B-lymphocytes produce immunoglobulin G (IgG)-HCV 
complexes, resulting in the generation of rheumatoid 
factor-IgM and cryoglobulins [24,25]. Such immune 
complexes are implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis (GN) in HCV-infected patients [24-26]. 
Although the most common HCV-related GN is type 1 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) 
with/without cryoglobulin, other types of GN such as 
membranous nephropathy (MGN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, fibrillary GN, 
thrombotic microangiopathy, and tubulointerstitial nephropathy have been described [26-28]. In an Italian 
multicenter study, 87% of patients with cryoglobulinemia had HCV infection. In addition, 83% of these patients showed the MPGN pattern on kidney biopsy [29]. 
El-Serag et al. [30] reported that the prevalence of cryoglobulinemia (0.57% vs. 0.05%) and MPGN (0.36% vs. 
0.05%) was higher in patients with than without HCV 
using Veterans Administration data. However, HCV infection presents as only microalbuminuria in > 10% of 
HCV-infected patients [31], suggesting that HCV has a 
greater influence on renal deterioration through GN 
than formerly believed. Therefore, patients infected 
with HCV should undergo regular surveillance for the 
early detection of GN. 
HCV in patients on dialysis
According to the 2004 Dialysis Outcomes and Practice 
Patterns Study (DOPPS), the prevalence of HCV infection in patients on hemodialysis (HD) is 13.5%. This 
study included 308 dialysis facilities in America, Europe, and Asia, and found differences among regions of 
2.6% to 22.9% [32]. In 2009, Johnson et al. [33] investigated the prevalence of HCV in dialysis patients in 10 
Asia-Pacific countries and reported an incidence of 
7.9% in HD patients and 2.0% in peritoneal dialysis patients. In addition, the dialysis modality was associated 
with the prevalence of HCV infection. After publication 
of the Recommendations for Preventing Transmission 
of Infections among Chronic Hemodialysis Patients by 
the Centers for Disease Control in 2001, the prevalence 
of HD-related viral transmission has decreased [34]. HD 
patients typically acquire HCV during HD, direct contact between patients, a breach in infection control, 
contaminated equipment, or transfusion of contaminated blood products [35,36]. The DOPPS study showed 
that the prevalence of HCV increases with the duration 
of HD (58% in > 20 years), and that ethnicity (black), 
hepatitis B co-infection and substance/alcohol abuse 
are risk factors for HCV infection [32]. These results 
suggest a lack of awareness of infection control in dialysis units and emphasize the importance of continuous 
surveillance for HCV. HD patients with HCV infection 
have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than those 
without HCV [37-39]. Goodkin et al. [39] analyzed the 
hospitalization rate, mortality rate, and quality of life of 
76,689 HD patients with HCV using the DOPPS data. 
The incidence of hospitalization was significantly higher in HD patients with HCV compared to those without 
HCV. Moreover, the aHR in HD patients with HCV 
versus those without HCV for all-cause, hepatic-related, 
cardiovascular-related, and infection-related hospitalization was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.13), 4.40 (95% CI, 1.03 
to 1.17), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.17), and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00

to 1.18), respectively. Similarly, the mortality rate was 
higher in HD patients with HCV, and the aHRs for HD 
patients with versus those without HCV for all-cause 
and hepatic-related mortality were 1.12 (95% Cl, 1.05 to 
1.20) and 5.90 (95% CI, 3.67 to 9.50), respectively. The 
mortality rate due to cardiovascular or infectious disease was non-significantly higher in HD patients with 
HCV. The Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL)-36 
quality of life scores were also lower in HD patients 
with HCV across all physical and mental domains.
HCV in KT recipients
The prevalence of HCV infection in KT recipients varies geographically from 6% to 46%. Notably, KT recipients typically become infected with HCV by dialysis 
rather than during or after transplantation [40]. To date, 
most studies have shown that HCV infection reduces 
graft and patient survival after KT [10,11,40,41]. New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplant (NODAT) frequently occurs in KT recipients. Immunosuppressants 
such as steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and 
cyclosporin), and mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) also contribute to the development of NODAT 
in KT recipients [42-45]. Kasiske et al. [41] reported a 
higher prevalence of NODAT in KT recipients with 
than without HCV infection (25.6% vs. 15.4%, respectively). A meta-analysis of 2,502 KT recipients showed 
an adjusted odds ratio for NODAT of 3.97 (95% CI, 1.83 
to 8.61) [17]. Similar to predialysis CKD, these data suggest that HCV infection-related NODAT increases cardiovascular and infection risk, which reduces graft and 
patient survival after KT [41-45]. Allograft GN accounts 
for approximately 18% to 22% of graft loss [46-48]. HCV 
infection is strongly associated with development of allograft GN after KT, and the MPGN and MGN. Hammoud et al. [46] showed a higher prevalence of MPGN 
in KT recipients with HCV compared to those without 
HCV (5.9% vs. 2.8%, respectively). Cruzado et al. [47] reported a 45.8% incidence of MPGN using 44 biopsies of 
KT recipients with HCV and suspected allograft GN. 
HCV infection reduces graft survival in KT recipients 
[10,11,17,43,48]. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies involving 133,530 KT recipients showed that HCV 
was a significant independent risk factor for graft loss 
with a relative risk of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.46 to 2.11) [10]. Scott
et al. [11] reported a high incidence of graft failure in 
140 KT recipients. The aHR for graft loss was 1.71 (95% 
CI, 1.28 to 2.29) for KT recipients with HCV; GN, chronic allograft nephropathy, and death were the most frequent causes of graft failure. Similarly, the majority of 
studies have reported that KT recipients with HCV 
have a low survival rate. Scott et al. [11] also reported a 
1.8% (n = 140) incidence of HCV infection in 7,572 KT 
recipients. The survival rate of KT recipients with and 
without HCV was 77% versus 90% and 50% versus 79% 
at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The aHR for mortality 
was 2.38 (95% CI, 1.69 to 3.37). The rates of mortality due 
to cardiovascular disease (aHR, 2.74), malignancy (aHR, 
2.52), and hepatic failure (aHR, 2.21) were high. Therefore, not only hepatic complications but also cardiovascular disease and cancer contribute to the death of KT 
recipients with HCV. Early aggressive treatment of 
HCV infection can reduce mortality by ameliorating 
extrahepatic complications such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and renal diseases in addition to hepatic 
complications.
ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES IN CKD PATIENTS WITH 
HCV INFECTION
CKD patients with chronic HCV infection require antiviral therapy; however, few treatment options were 
available until recently. Pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) 
plus ribavirin was the standard of care for HCV-infected patients before introduction of the first-generation 
DAAs, telaprevir and boceprevir (HCV-NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors). Several clinical trials of peg-IFN plus 
low-dose ribavirin have involved renal transplant candidates undergoing maintenance HD. Rendina et al. [49] 
reported a high sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 
and low dropout rate in a clinical trial of peg-IFN alfa-2a plus low-dose ribavirin in hemodialyzed patients 
infected with HCV awaiting renal transplant. Another 
randomized controlled trial showed that peg-IFN plus 
ribavirin combination therapy has greater efficacy and 
safety than peg-IFN monotherapy for HCV in patients 
on HD [50,51]. Fabrizi et al. [52] conducted a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of 11 clinical studies on the 
efficacy and safety of IFN-based combination therapy 
for HCV-infected patients on regular dialysis. The 
summary estimate SVR and dropout rate was 0.60 and

0.18, respectively, and anemia and infection were the 
major barriers to therapy continuation. Triple antiviral 
therapies comprising peg-IFN, low-dose ribavirin and 
telaprevir or boceprevir have been tested in HCV-infected patients with CKD [53-55]. The interpretation of 
the data from these trials was hampered by the small 
numbers of enrolled patients and involvement of only 
those infected with HCV genotype 1. In addition, side 
effects unrelated to peg-IFN and ribavirin including 
drug-drug interactions, cutaneous rash, anemia, and 
poor compliance hampered therapy continuation. The 
goal of anti-HCV treatment is an undetectable viral 
load at least 12 weeks after completing therapy (SVR12), 
which is a surrogate marker for virologic cure. IFNbased regimens are not sufficient in terms of SVR and 
safety in difficult to treat patients such as those with renal impairment. Several clinical trials using next-generation DAAs have been performed. Roth et al. [56] performed a phase III, prospective, randomized trial (the 
C-SURFER study) of the safety and efficacy of elbasvir 
(HCV-NS5A inhibitor) plus grazoprevir (HCV-NS3/
NS4A protease inhibitor) in treatment-naïve and -experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and 
stage 4 to 5 CKD; the SVR12 rate was 99% and the incidence of adverse events was low. Saxena et al. [57] evaluated the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir (HCV-NS5B 
polymerase inhibitor)-containing regimens (PEG-interferon, simeprevir [HCV-NS3/NS4A protease inhibitor], 
and ribavirin) in HCV-infected patients with impaired 
renal dysfunction. This real-world outcome study (the 
HCV-TARGET study) showed SVR12 rates of 81% to 
88% depending on the GFR; however, patients with a 
GFR of ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 more frequently experienced worsening renal function and ribavirin-related 
hemolytic anemia. Based on the renal excretion of sofosbuvir and its metabolites, the use of this DAA agent 
is not recommended in patients with a GFR of ≤ 30 mL/
min/1.73 m2. Pockros et al. [58] performed a clinical trial 
(the RUBY study) of the combination of ombitasvir 
(HCV-NS5A inhibitor), paritaprevir (HCV-NS3/NS4A 
protease inhibitor), ritonavir (HCV-NS5A inhibitor), 
and dasabuvir (HCV-NS5B polymerase inhibitor) in 20 
genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with stage 4 to 5 CKD 
or ESRD; the SVR12 rate was 90% and all adverse events 
were tolerable. If ribavirin is added to maximize therapeutic efficacy in patients infected with genotype 1a 
HCV, dose reduction or interruption of ribavirin may 
be required to control progressive anemia that requires 
erythropoietin supplementation. This treatment regimen is in clinical use for genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction. Gane et al. [59] reported good results from the EXPEDITION-4 study of 
the clinical efficacy of glecaprevir (HCV-NS3/NS4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (HCV-NS5A inhibitor) 
in 104 HCV-infected patients with stage 4 to 5 CKD or 
ESRD. This combined regimen showed an SVR12 rate 
of 98% with minimal adverse events. Moreover, treatment-naïve and -experienced patients infected with 
HCV of any genotype achieved excellent antiviral outcomes. As glecaprevir is an inhibitor of the viral protease NS protein 3/4A and pibrentasvir is an inhibitor of 
the NS protein 5A of HCV, this DAA combination regimen has pan-genotypic coverage. Although this was not 
a blinded and randomized trial and enrolled only one 
patient infected with HCV genotype 5/6, this is the only 
pan-genotypic regimen approved for the treatment of 
HCV-infected patients with kidney disease. The MAGELLAN-2 study conducted by Reau et al. [60] was a 
phase 3, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial of the 
efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for genotype 1 to 6 HCV-infected non-cirrhotic patients who 
had undergone primary liver or kidney transplantation. 
The SVR rate was 98% and adverse events were tolerable without DAA dosage modification or discontinuation. In addition, no potential drug interactions of glecaprevir/pibretasvir with concomitant immunosuppressive 
agents were identified. In 2017, The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Infectious 
Diseases Society of America jointly updated the HCV 
treatment guidelines to recommend combination therapy with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks for the 
treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 to 6 infections in 
liver transplant patients without cirrhosis. Fig. 1 shows 
a treatment algorithm for CKD patients using DAAs according to HCV genotype and eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS
The recent advent of next-generation DAA agents has 
revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic 
HCV infection in terms of the viral eradication rate and

the tolerability of adverse reactions. Indeed, in HCV-infected patients with advanced renal impairment, the 
clinical efficacy and safety of DAA combination regimens are excellent. Furthermore, the development of a 
pan-genotypic DAA combination regimen, glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir, has increased the efficacy of treatment. The availability of DAA agents for HCV-infected 
patients with CKD, ESRD, or on HD enables selection 
of patients and the optimal time to start treatment. A 
prospective study is needed to evaluate the long-term 
outcomes (such as progression to advanced-stage CKD, 
dialysis-phase ESRD, and graft and KT recipient survival) of all-DAA combination regimens in HCV-infected 
CKD patients.
