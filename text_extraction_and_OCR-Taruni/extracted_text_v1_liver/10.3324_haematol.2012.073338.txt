Introduction
Cancer patients have a higher risk of developing venous
thromboembolism (VTE) than patients without cancer, and
VTE has a negative impact on the survival of cancer patients.1-
6 However, the risk of VTE among cancer patients differs considerably3,5 and is below 10% even in certain groups of
patients with advanced cancer.7 Predictive parameters are,
therefore, required to stratify patients into risk groups. In the
last years, clinical research on prediction of cancer-associated
VTE has focused on clinical and laboratory parameters.8-14
Based on laboratory and clinical parameters associated with
VTE, a scoring model for the prediction of VTE in cancer
patients was recently developed15 and has already been
expanded16 and validated17 in other study populations.
However, given the heterogeneity of cancer patients,
improved predictability and better understanding of the
underlying pathomechanisms of cancer-associated VTE are
desirable. Routine parameters that are usually available at initial diagnosis of every cancer patient would be particularly
useful to help the oncologist to assess the VTE risk of each
individual patient better.
Patients with advanced cancer have an elevated risk of
developing VTE. Distant metastases in cancer patients are
among the strongest risk factors for cancer-associated
VTE.3,18,19 However, lymph node metastases are not usually
regarded as an established risk factor.5,20,21 Studies of patients
in the Californian Cancer Registry investigated the association between VTE and local, regional, and distant disease in a
group of different cancer sites19 and in several single tumor
entities.22-27 The risk was highest in patients with metastatic
disease, but was also slightly elevated in patients with regional disease, compared to those with localized cancer only. As
these studies were based on registry data obtained between
1990 and 1999, other influences on the risk of VTE, such as
treatment-related factors, could not be considered. Moreover,
to our knowledge there are no studies that have comprehensively investigated the relationship between laboratory bio-

Advanced cancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. However, lymph node metastases are usually not
considered an established risk factor. In the framework of the prospective, observational Vienna Cancer and
Thrombosis Study we investigated the association between local (N0), regional (N1-3), and distant (M1) cancer
stages and the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, we were specifically interested in the relationship between stage and biomarkers that have been reported to be associated with venous thromboembolism.
We followed 832 patients with solid tumors for a median of 527 days. The study end-point was symptomatic
venous thromboembolism. At study inclusion, 241 patients had local, 138 regional, and 453 distant stage cancer.
The cumulative probability of venous thromboembolism after 6 months in patients with local, regional and distant
stage cancer was 2.1%, 6.5% and 6.0%, respectively (P=0.002). Compared to patients with local stage disease,
patients with regional and distant stage disease had a significantly higher risk of venous thromboembolism in multivariable Cox-regression analysis including age, newly diagnosed cancer (versus progression of disease), surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (regional: HR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.5-9.6; distant: HR=5.4, 95% CI: 2.3-12.9).
Furthermore, patients with regional or distant stage disease had significantly higher levels of D-dimer, factor VIII,
and platelets, and lower hemoglobin levels than those with local stage disease. These results demonstrate an
increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with regional disease. Elevated levels of predictive biomarkers in patients with regional disease underpin the results and are in line with the activation of the hemostatic system in the early phase of metastatic dissemination.

markers predictive of cancer-associated VTE and tumor
stage, so as to elucidate the pathophysiology of the association between coagulation and malignancy.
We hypothesized that the presence of lymph node
metastases is a strong risk factor for VTE and is associated
with increased levels of biomarkers predictive of cancerassociated VTE. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively
followed 832 cancer patients and investigated the relationship between local (N0), regional (N1-3), and distant (M1)
cancer stages and the occurrence of VTE. Furthermore, we
correlated all plasma biomarkers that have been established
to be predictive of cancer-associated VTE, namely D-dimer,8
prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F1 + F2),8 clotting factor
VIII,13 platelets,15 soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin),9 leukocytes15 and hemoglobin concentration15 with local, regional,
and distant cancer stages, to elucidate the pathogenesis of
the prothrombotic state in patients with regional stage disease, and to establish possible links between the hemostatic
system and the process of metastatic dissemination.
Design and Methods
The Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS) is an ongoing, prospective and observational cohort study at the Medical
University of Vienna and is conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki after approval by the institutional ethics
committee. The aim of CATS is to investigate factors that are associated with the occurrence of symptomatic VTE in patients with
cancer. All patients with solid tumors included in the CATS
between October 2003 and December 2009 were eligible for this
study. 
Study participants underwent tumor staging or, in the case of
disease progression after remission, re-staging prior to study inclusion. The study participants were followed prospectively until the
end of follow-up (2 years), occurrence of VTE, death, loss from follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. At study inclusion, venous
blood samples were drawn and the patients’ medical history was
recorded. 
Based on the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) Classification
specified by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)28
we defined three tumor stages: local, regional, and distant. Patients
with no lymph node metastases and no distant metastases were
classified as have local stage (TxN0M0) disease. Regional stage
was defined by a positive lymph node status but concurrent
absence of distant metastases (TxN1-3M0). The presence of distant metastases led to the classification of distant stage cancer, irrespective of the lymph node status (TxNxM1). Lymph node metastases and distant metastases were detected and verified by imaging techniques (e.g. computerized tomography), cancer biopsy, or
cancer surgery.
The patients’ characteristics are described by medians and
interquartile ranges for continuous variables because of the nonnormal distributions, and by frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare
the distribution of (non-normally distributed) biomarkers. In the
case of a significant overall test result, a Mann-Whitney test was
applied and corrected with Bonferroni’s correction. The median of
the follow-up distribution was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method with reverse meaning of the status indicator.29 Univariate
and multivariable Cox-regression analyses were used to calculate
the VTE risk for patients with local, regional and distant cancer.
The first multivariable Cox-regression model (model 1) comprised
regional stage (versus local stage), distant stage (versus local stage),
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, age, and newly diagnosed
cancer (versus progression of disease). We assumed that surgery,
chemotherapy and radiotherapy would entail a modified risk for
VTE not only limited to the exact time-point of the procedure, but
also for a certain period afterwards. Therefore, three time-dependent binary variables that indicated times of possible influence on
the VTE risk by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy were
included in model 1. In a second multivariable Cox-regression
analysis (model 2) we adjusted for laboratory biomarkers according to the availability in clinical practice (D-dimer, leukocytes,
platelets, and hemoglobin), and newly diagnosed cancer. For reasons of comparability with other studies and to maximize practicality in clinical routine, laboratory biomarkers were
dichotomized according to cut-off levels used in the Khorana VTE
prediction score15 and, in the case of D-dimer, according to the 75th
percentile of the CATS study population.8 More detailed information is available in the Online Supplementary Material.
Results
Study population
All patients with solid tumors included in the CATS
between October 2003 and December 2009 (n=968) were
eligible for this study. A total of 136 of these patients had
to be excluded: 90 patients did not match the exact inclusion criteria after re-evaluation, for 39 patients no followup was available, and 7 patients were excluded because of
incomplete information on tumor stage. Hence, 832
patients with solid tumors were enrolled (Table 1). 
Four-hundred and ninety-four (59.4%) patients had
newly diagnosed cancer and 338 (40.6%) patients had progression of disease after complete or partial remission. At
study inclusion, the patients were classified as having local
stage cancer (n=241; 29.0%), regional stage cancer (n=138;
16.6%), or distant stage cancer (n=453; 54.4%). Within
those with regional cancer, 91 (66%) patients were classified as lymph node positive with N1 status, 38 (28%) as
lymph node positive with N2 status, and 9 (7%) as lymph
node positive with N3 status. Patients were observed for a
median of 527 days. During the follow-up 333 (40.0%)
patients died without clear evidence of fatal VTE. 
Thromboembolic events
In 57 (6.9%) patients a clinically relevant VTE was
detected. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower
extremity was diagnosed in 22, pulmonary embolism (PE)
in 20, and combined DVT and PE in three patients. An isolated DVT of the upper extremity was detected in two
patients. Each of the following events was diagnosed in
one patient: combined DVT of the lower extremity and
portal vein thrombosis, combined DVT of the upper
extremity and PE, internal jugular vein thrombosis, and
sinus vein thrombosis. PE was fatal in two patients. A portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in four patients. All
four portal vein thromboses occurred in patients with pancreatic cancer: one in a patient with local disease, one in a
patient with regional cancer and two in patients with
metastatic cancer. Of the 57 VTE events, several events
were detected incidentally: seven cases of PE, two portal
vein thromboses, one internal jugular vein thrombosis,
and one DVT of the lower extremity. Nevertheless, they
were rated as clinically relevant by the adjudication committee. The overall cumulative incidence of VTE was
4.9% after 6 months, 6.0% after 12 months, and 6.9 %
after 2 years.

Risk of venous thromboembolism: tumor stage
Seven (2.9%) patients with local disease, 12 (8.7%) with
regional cancer, and 38 (8.4%) with distant cancer developed symptomatic VTE during the follow-up. In KaplanMeier analysis, the cumulative probability of VTE after 6
months was 2.1% in patients with local disease, 6.5% in
patients with regional disease, and 6.0% in patients with
distant cancer (Figure 1). Patients with regional and distant
disease had a significantly higher risk of developing VTE
compared to those with local cancer (log-rank test:
P=0.002). No significant risk difference was found
between patients with regional and distant stages of disease (log-rank test: P=0.707). In univariable Cox-regression analysis the risk of VTE was 3.5-fold (95% CI: 1.4-
8.9, P=0.008) increased for regional stage compared to
local stage, and 4.0-fold (95% CI: 1.8-9.0, P<0.001)
increased for distant stage compared to local stage disease.
In multivariable Cox-regression analysis (model 1) including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, age at study
inclusion, and newly diagnosed cancer (versus progression
of disease) the adjusted hazard ratio was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.5-
9.6, P=0.006) in patients with regional stage disease compared to patients with local stage disease, and 5.4 (95%
CI: 2.3-12.9, P<0.001) in those with distant cancer compared to patients with local stage disease (Table 2).
We also performed a separate evaluation of the frequency of VTE in the three different regional lymph node
stages N1, N2, and N3. Of 91 patients with N1 status,
eight (8.8%) developed VTE during the follow-up period
while of the 38 patients with N2 status, four (10.5%) did
so. None of the nine patients with N3 status had a VTE
during the follow-up period. 
Association of tumor stage with biomarkers
Patients with local, regional, or distant cancer had significantly different levels of all the biomarkers analyzed (Ddimer, F1+F2, factor VIII, platelets, sP-selectin, leukocytes,
and hemoglobin; all P<0.0068). D-dimer levels, factor VIII

activity, and platelet counts continuously increased from
local to regional to distant stage, whereas hemoglobin levels continuously decreased. No continuous increase from
local to regional to distant stage was found for leukocyte
counts, F1+2, or sP-selectin levels. 
Compared to patients with local disease, patients with
regional stage disease had significantly higher D-dimer
levels (P<0.001), platelet counts (P=0.002), and factor VIII
activity (P=0.021), and lower levels of hemoglobin
(P<0.001). Levels of F1+2, and leukocyte counts were not
significantly elevated in patients with regional stage disease. Compared to patients with local disease, patients
with distant disease had significantly increased levels of all
biomarkers except hemoglobin concentration, which was
significantly decreased (Table 3).
Risk of venous thromboembolism: tumor stage and routinely available biomarkers
In order to consider selected laboratory biomarkers in
the multivariable analysis, a second Cox-regression analysis (model 2) was performed. Model 2 comprised D-dimer,
leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, tumor stage and newly
diagnosed cancer. In this model, the hazard ratio of VTE
was 3.2 (95% CI: 1.2-8.1, P=0.017) in patients with regional disease compared to patients with local disease, and 3.4
(95% CI: 1.4-8.0, P=0.006) in patients with distant disease
compared to patients with local disease. D-dimer was the
only biomarker in model 2 that was significantly associated with the occurrence of VTE (HR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4-4.3,
P=0.002) (Table 4).
Discussion
In this prospective study we demonstrate that regional
lymph node metastases are a strong risk factor for cancerassociated VTE. Furthermore, a significant relationship
between biomarkers predictive of cancer-related VTE and
regional tumor stage is shown.
In our study, we were especially interested in the association between lymph node metastases and the occurrence of VTE. We, therefore, applied the TNM classification to elucidate the relationship between local (N0),
regional (N1-3), and distant stage (M1) disease, and the
occurrence of VTE. Previous studies paid only little attention to the clinical relevance of regional lymph node
metastases as a risk factor for VTE in cancer patients. To
our knowledge the only studies on this subject are those
by the Californian Cancer Registry, which investigated the
association between local, regional, and distant stage disease and the occurrence of VTE.19,22-27 Studies by the
Californian Cancer Registry that focused on tumor sites
similar to those included in CATS (lung, colon, stomach,
pancreatic, breast, and prostate) reported an approximately 2-fold higher risk of VTE in patients with regional disease than in those with local cancer (odds ratios ranging
from 1.1 in patients with pancreatic cancer to 2.7 in
patients with colon cancer).19,22-24 Interestingly, in our study
the risk of VTE in patients with regional stage cancer was
clearly higher. We found that patients with regional stage
cancer had a 3-4-fold higher risk of developing VTE than
those with local stage cancer. In Kaplan-Meier analysis the
cumulative risk of VTE after 6 months was even slightly
higher in patients with regional lymph node metastases
than in patients with distant metastases.
An explanation for the considerably higher risk of VTE
in regional stage cancer patients in CATS might be that the
Californian Cancer Registry studies are based on registry
data, whereas CATS is a prospective study specifically
designed to identify predictive parameters for cancer-associated VTE. We verified patients’ exact TNM status at
study inclusion and documented type and duration of
patients’ anti-cancer therapies during follow-up. To eliminate the confounding influence of anti-cancer therapies on
the occurrence of VTE, we adjusted for surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in time-dependent Coxregression analyses, and found that the hazard ratio of
regional lymph node metastases for VTE remained similarly high.

It has been shown that the VTE risk in cancer patients is
highest in the first 6 months after diagnosis.3 The inclusion
of patients with progression of disease after remission in
our study might, therefore, be a possible confounder, biasing the VTE risk in patients with regional and distant stage
disease. Hence, we adjusted for newly diagnosed cancer
(versus progression of disease) in the multivariable analyses. However, patients with newly diagnosed cancer did
not have a significantly higher risk of VTE than patients
with progression of disease after complete or partial
remission.
The high incidence of VTE in patients with regional disease in our study was not caused by bulky lymph nodes
obstructing the venous flow. However, in one patient with
regional pancreatic cancer a local obstruction of venous
flow by the primary tumor or regional lymph node metastases could not be definitely excluded, since VTE occurred
in the portal vein.
In order to consider selected laboratory biomarkers in
the multivariable analysis, we constructed a second Coxregression model. The model included predictive biomarkers for cancer-associated VTE that are easy to determine and are routinely available in almost all hospital laboratories. Also in this extended model lymph node metastases were independently and strongly associated with the
occurrence of VTE. The hazard ratio of VTE for lymph
node metastases in model 2 was similar high to that for
distant metastases in model 2, once again emphasizing the
relevance of lymph node metastases as a strong risk factor
for cancer-associated VTE.
To explain and understand the considerably elevated
VTE risk in patients with regional stage disease it is helpful
to take a closer look at the process of metastatic dissemination. The invasion of tumor cells into the blood stream
or lymph fluid is essential for the development of distant
metastases. Hence, contacts and interactions between
tumor cells and the hemostatic system precede the manifestation of distant metastases. Thus, a hypercoagulable
state in cancer patients may already exist in patients with
regional spread. To support this approach to explaining
the prothrombotic state in patients with regional stage disease, and to establish possible links between the hemostatic system and the process of metastatic dissemination, we
correlated biomarkers that are predictive of cancer-associated VTE with local, regional, and distant disease.
In our investigations, D-dimer levels were already elevated in patients with regional cancer. This clearly confirms the assumption of a hypercoagulable state in
patients with regional disease. These results are in line
with the data of other studies that found a correlation
between tumor stage and D-dimer levels in patients with
breast cancer30 and colorectal cancer.31 Interestingly, F1+2
levels were elevated only in patients with distant cancer,
but not in those with regional disease. The fact that in
patients with regional disease D-dimer levels were
increased, while F1+2 levels were not, indicates that
tumors might induce a hypercoagulable state in patients
with regional disease by interaction with the fibrinolytic
system. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that
malignant cells can activate coagulation in cancer
patients by dysregulating fibrinolytic pathways.32
Clotting factor VIII activity and platelet counts were elevated in patients with regional and distant disease. We
hypothesize that these factors might play an important
role in the early phase of metastatic dissemination. In
contrast, sP-selectin concentration and leukocyte counts
were elevated only in patients with distant stage disease,
suggesting that sP-selectin and inflammatory processes
might play a more important role in the late phase of
metastatic dissemination. In accordance with our findings, Connolly et al. demonstrated an association
between pre-chemotherapy leukocytosis and distant
metastases in a prospective observational study in
patients with different types of malignancies.33 Low
hemoglobin concentration is a predictive parameter for
cancer-associated VTE and it is even part of the Khorana
VTE prediction score.15 For this reason we also investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration
and tumor stage. Hemoglobin levels were decreased in
patients with regional and distant stage cancer.
Our study has several limitations. The tumor stage was
collected only at study inclusion. We did not re-evaluate
the stage at the time of occurrence of VTE. However, most
of the VTE events (72%) in our study occurred in the first
6 months. Moreover, the heterogeneity of our study participants implies that our results can be applied only to
patients similar to our cohort. Due to the relatively small
number of VTE events in each tumor entity, we were not
able to analyze the association between tumor stage and
the occurrence of VTE in single tumor sites.
Based on the findings of this study, we recommend an
equally high alertness for symptoms compatible with VTE
in patients with regional disease as in those with metastatic cancer. Indeed, just as patients with distant metastases,
patients with regional stage disease should also be regarded as being at high risk of VTE, especially in the presence
of other risk factors for cancer-associated VTE.
We conclude that cancer patients with regional lymph
node metastases have an increased risk of developing
VTE. Elevated levels of predictive biomarkers in patients
with regional stage disease underpin our results and are in
line with the activation of the hemostatic system in the
early phase of metastatic dissemination.
