Pediatric Acute Liver Failure (PALF) is a rapidly progressive clinical syndrome encountered
in the pediatric ICU which may rapidly progress to multi-organ dysfunction, and on
occasion to life threatening cerebral edema and hemorrhage. Pediatric Acute Liver Failure
is defined as severe acute hepatic dysfunction accompanied by encephalopathy and
liver-based coagulopathy defined as prolongation of International Normalized Ratio (INR)
>1.5. However, coagulopathy in PALF is complex and warrants a deeper understanding
of the hemostatic balance in acute liver failure. Although an INR value of >1.5 is
accepted as the evidence of coagulopathy and has historically been viewed as a
prognostic factor of PALF, it may not accurately reflect the bleeding risk in PALF
since it only measures procoagulant factors. Paradoxically, despite the prolongation
of INR, bleeding risk is lower than expected (around 5%). This is due to “rebalanced
hemostasis” due to concurrent changes in procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic
systems. Since the liver is involved in both procoagulant (Factors II, V, IX, XI, and
fibrinogen) and anticoagulant (Protein C, Protein S, and antithrombin) protein synthesis,
PALF results in “rebalanced hemostasis” or even may shift toward a hypercoagulable
state. In addition to rebalanced coagulation there is altered platelet production due to
decreased thrombopoietin production by liver, increased von Willebrand factor from low
grade endothelial cell activation, and hyperfibrinolysis and dysfibrinogenemia from altered
synthetic liver dysfunction. All these alterations contribute to the multifactorial nature of
coagulopathy in PALF. Over exuberant use of prophylactic blood products in patients with
PALF may contribute to morbidities such as fluid overload, transfusion-associated lung
injury, and increased thrombosis risk. It is essential to use caution when using INR values
for plasma and factor administration. In this review we will summarize the complexity
of coagulation in PALF, explore “rebalanced hemostasis,” and discuss the limitations
of current coagulation tests. We will also review strategies to accurately diagnose the
coagulopathy of PALF and targeted therapies.

INTRODUCTION
Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a life-threatening
illness, characterized by the sudden onset of coagulopathy,
thrombocytopenia, and systemic inflammation that may
ultimately result in dreaded complications such as cerebral
edema and hemorrhage. The liver is responsible for the
synthesis of a majority of blood coagulation factors and plays a
central role in the hemostatic system. As a result of decreased
coagulation factor synthesis, acute liver failure patients were
historically believed to be “autoanticoagulated” and protected
from thrombosis. However, this belief has been challenged as the
understanding of the coagulopathy in liver failure has evolved. In
acute liver failure, there is a parallel reduction of anti-coagulant
factors along with pro-coagulant factors and this leaves the
patient in a rebalanced coagulation state that may sometimes
favor thrombosis (1–7). Consequently, thrombotic events are
more common than bleeding complications in patients with
acute liver failure (2–4, 8–11). Clinically significant bleeding
is rare, in part due to the absence of esophageal varices and
portal hypertension, which are the major risk factors for bleeding
in chronic liver failure. Recent data shows that in acute liver
failure the spontaneous significant bleeding rate is <5%, the
spontaneous intracranial bleeding rate is <1% and the risk does
not correlate with INR values (12).
Since PALF is defined as severe acute hepatic dysfunction
with prolongation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) >1.5
with encephalopathy, close monitoring of INR and correction
of elevated levels occur frequently (13). Although the INR value
is followed as a prognostic tool it is important to recognize the
limitation of this classic test for evaluating the coagulopathy
of liver disease. The prothrombin time (PT) and INR are
measures of pro-coagulant factors (or lack thereof) and do
not take into consideration changes in anti-coagulant factors,
platelets, and other hemostatic changes. As such, the PT and
INR are poor predictors of bleeding risk. It is essential to be
cognizant of the risk of over-transfusion and tipping this delicate
balance toward hemorrhage or thrombosis for an arbitrary INR
number (14). Transfusion of any blood component has been
associated with increased mortality, increased need for liver
transplantation and reduction in graft survival (15). Transfusionrelated immunomodulation (TRIM), transfusion-related acute
lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload
(TACO), hemolytic reactions, and infection risk are some of
the potential reasons for transfusion-related poor outcomes (16).
This review will discuss the pathophysiology of “rebalanced
hemostasis” in pediatric acute liver failure, diagnostic challenges
and therapeutic considerations.
REBALANCED HEMOSTASIS
The hemostatic system consists of three major arms. Primary
hemostasis involves formation of the primary platelet plug on the
injured vascular endothelium. Secondary hemostasis involves the
cascade of coagulation factors leading to formation of the fibrin
clot. Fibrinolysis follows primary and secondary hemostasis; and
involves a process that removes the fibrin clot and prevents
uncontrolled thrombosis (17, 18).
In acute liver failure, all three of these arms of hemostasis are
affected. The delicate balance between prevention of bleeding
and excessive clot formation is impacted by the concomitant
changes in pro- and anti-hemostatic factors in PALF. These
changes are a result of decreased hepatic synthesis of proand anti-coagulation factors, thrombocytopenia, elevated
von Willebrand factor (vWF), reduced a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member
13 (ADAMTS-13), reduced vitamin-K dependent carboxylation
of pro- and anti-coagulant factors, and consumptive
coagulopathy (10, 19).
Primary Hemostasis
Platelets are responsible for the initial primary hemostatic
response by adhering to the damaged blood vessels and
promoting aggregation and clot formation with the aid of the
endothelial-derived protein vWF. They are also responsible
for facilitating the Tissue Factor (TF) and factor VII complex
formation, which catalyzes the activation of factor X and
formation of “priming thrombin” (19) (Figure 1).
Both platelet number and function are reduced in PALF,
although the changes are less pronounced compared to
chronic liver failure (2, 9). Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a
glycoprotein hormone produced primarily in the liver that
regulates the production of platelets in bone marrow by
stimulating megakaryocytes. In children with acute liver
failure there are reductions in TPO levels as evidenced
by reduced serum TPO and hepatic TPO mRNA levels
(20). Moreover, increased consumption of platelets further
contributes to thrombocytopenia. Increased production
of endothelial-derived platelet inhibitors prostacyclin and
nitric oxide likely also contributes to impaired function of
platelets (21).
This thrombocytopenia is compensated, however, by elevated
levels of adhesive protein vWF and decreased ADAMTS13 (Table 1). While vWF promotes platelet adhesion and
aggregation at sites of vascular injury, it is negatively modulated
by ADAMTS-13. ADAMTS-13 is a metalloproteinase that is
primarily synthetized in the liver as well as in endothelial cells
and platelets. It cleaves large vWF multimers into smaller less
procoagulant forms and decreases clot formation. In acute liver
failure vWF levels are elevated and ADAMTS-13 levels are
reduced. These opposing effects promote platelet adhesion with
the net result of rebalanced hemostasis (1, 22).
Thrombocytopenia is also compensated by the presence of
platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EV); microparticles (0.1–
1µm) which are highly pro-coagulant and contribute to ongoing
activation of coagulation (23). Recently a study by Stravitz et al.
showed that patients suffering from acute liver failure had an
increased amount of these circulating microparticles (23, 24).
Overall, thrombocytopenia in ALF is compensated by elevated
levels of vWF, reduced ADAMTS-13 levels and presence of
platelet-derived extracellular vesicles that partially offset the
impact of low platelet count.

Secondary Hemostasis
Secondary hemostasis is characterized by the formation of
an insoluble fibrin clot by activated coagulation factors and
thrombin. Fibrin in turn stabilizes the primary platelet plug to
stop the hemorrhage.
Reduction of coagulation factors is more extensive in acute
liver failure compared to chronic liver failure, and factor levels
can be as low as 1–10% of normal values (11, 21). Due to synthetic
dysfunction of liver, there is reduced production of both procoagulant factors: V, VII, IX, X, XI, XIII, and prothrombin (II),
and anti-coagulant factors: antithrombin, protein C, and protein
S. Factor VIII is the only coagulation factor that is increased
in PALF since Factor VIII is synthesized both in liver and in
endothelial cells and is an acute phase reactant. In addition,
activity of factor VIII is enhanced as a result of elevated levels
of vWF, a protein that stabilizes Factor VIII in the circulation
(25). These simultaneous and opposing pro- and anti-coagulant
protein deficiencies results in a net rebalanced hemostasis.
Fibrinogen, an essential coagulation factor produced by
the liver, it is the precursor of fibrin and is necessary for
clot formation. Pediatric acute liver failure is accompanied by
hypofibrinoginemia, though the reduction in fibrinogen levels
is modest compared to the other pro-coagulant factors (2).
Dysfibrinogenemia, or abnormal functioning of fibrinogen, is a
result of increased content of sialic acid residues that leads to
abnormalities of fibrin monomer polymerization (26, 27).
Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of both pro-coagulant
factors and anti-coagulant factors by the liver. Unlike in chronic
liver failure, vitamin K deficiency is uncommon in PALF
unless there is coexisting biliary tract disease or prolonged
use of gut sterilizing broad-spectrum antibiotics. Deficiency has
the potential to worsen the associated coagulopathy, and so
differentiation between vitamin K-dependent and vitamin K
non-dependent coagulopathy should be part of initial evaluation
in PALF (28).
Fibrinolysis
Fibrinolysis is the process by which the body breaks down
clots. Fibrinolysis limits the extent of thrombosis, begins clot
degradation, and maintains vascular patency. It starts with
conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by the pro-fibrinolytic
drivers tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA), urokinase-type
Plasminogen Activator (u-PA), and activated factor XII. At the
same time these pro-fibrinolytic drivers are opposed by antifibrinolytic drivers such as Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor

type 1 (PAI-1), Plasmin inhibitor, and Thrombin-Activatable
Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) (1).
In liver disease, increased levels of t-PA and reduced levels
of plasmin inhibitor and TAFI favors hyper-fibrinolysis and
bleeding. On the other hand, reduced levels of plasminogen
and increased levels of PAI-1 favors hypo-fibrinolysis and clot
formation. These competing factors result in rebalanced proand anti-fibrinolytic activity in liver failure. In acute liver failure,
high PAI-1 levels and low plasminogen levels may be substantial
enough to tip the balance toward a hypofibrinolytic state whereas
in cirrhosis, fibrinolysis is usually normal or hyper-fibrinolysis is
present (2, 9, 21, 25).
Hyperfibrinolysis can also be seen during the anhepatic phase
of liver transplantation due to increased tPA derived from
endothelial cells; this is secondary to failure of tPA clearance in
the absence of the liver (29).
Differentiating DIC and liver mediated coagulopathy can be
quite challenging due to overlapping laboratory abnormalities
and possibility of both coexisting at the same time. Patient with
ALF may develop DIC if they become septic and hypotensive.
Fibrinolysis of DIC is accompanied by fibrinogenolysis and by
thrombin generation. Presence of fibrin-related markers such
as D-dimer, Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs) which is an
important index of fibrinogenolysis may help differentiate true
DIC from liver associated coagulation dysfunction (30–32).
Decreased Factor VIII levels can also be used to distinguish DIC
from hepatic disease in acquired hypofibrinogenemic states (33).
In summary, contrary to the common belief that acute liver
failure patients are “autoanticoagulated,” they may be more prone
to thrombosis rather than bleeding. There is a combination of
(a) thrombocytopenia compensated with elevated levels of vWF,
factor VIII and reduced ADAMTS-13, (b) a hypofibrinolytic state
due to elevated PAI-1 and low plasminogen, and (c) elevated
levels of pro-coagulant microparticles that may all lead to an
increased risk of thrombosis and worsen outcome (23, 24).
LIMITATION OF STANDARD HEMOSTATIC
TESTS
Current conventional laboratory tests such as PT/INR and partial
thromboplastin time (PTT) have limitations for evaluating the
coagulopathy of liver disease. Specifically, the PT/INR measures
only procoagulant factors and omits the contribution of the
platelets, in vivo inhibitors, fibrinolytic enzymes, and other
cellular components. These tests do not provide information
on actual fibrin formation or clot lysis. Lack of predictive
power can be explained by the deficiency of anti-coagulant
proteins which are reduced in parallel with pro-coagulant
factors (34, 35).
The international normalization ratio (INR) is commonly
used as a prognostic and decision-making tool when calculating
the Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease Model (PELD) score which
includes INR, bilirubin, albumin, and growth velocity of the
child. International Normalized Ratio is a valuable biomarker for
prognostication and determination of organ allocation; however
it is inadequate for the measurement of bleeding risk. In children
undergoing liver biopsy, hemorrhagic complications can occur
in 0.91–4.2% of cases and coagulopathy markers do not predict
bleeding complications (36, 37).
International Normalized Ratio calculation is derived
from the Prothrombin Time (PT) and is standardized
across laboratories among patients receiving vitamin K
antagonists. Thrombomodulin is essential for PT measurement.
Commercially available Prothrombin time tests do not contain
a sufficient amount of thrombomodulin, and although the
PT measures the function of pro-coagulants, it fails to
measure the thrombin inhibited by the anticoagulants (1).
Thrombin generation is downregulated by thrombomodulin,
a transmembrane protein on endothelial cells which activates
Protein C. Protein C is activated by thrombin and activated
protein C forms a complex with its plasma co-factor, protein S
and inhibits activated factor VIII and factor V that leads to less
thrombin generation (Figure 1).
Furthermore, there is a significant laboratory to laboratory
variation in the INR tests from patients with liver disease (10).
One study demonstrated 26% variability in INR results among
three laboratories, which could be problematic for treatment and
organ allocation (3).
While standard assays of hemostasis are limited and
misleading to evaluate hemostatic status in PALF, viscoelastic
hemostatic assays (VHA) can accurately evaluate the current state
of rebalanced hemostasis by measuring clot formation, ultimate
clot strength, and the stability of the clot by integrating the
contribution of platelets (8).
Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA) such as
thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry
(ROTEM) are whole blood tests that are a functional measure
of clot formation and degradation in real time. Viscoelastic
hemostatic assays measure the time to initial fibrin formation,
the rate of clot formation, the strength of the clot, clot lysis and
the contribution of sepsis-induced heparinoids to coagulation
abnormalities. Since clot formation is the endpoint, VHAs have
an obvious advantage over thrombin generation tests which have

Bulut et al. Hemostasis in Pediatric Liver Failure
thrombin generation as the endpoint rather than formation of
the fibrin clot (10, 14).
Both TEG and ROTEM are commercially available point-ofcare tests of whole blood coagulation. For TEG, blood is placed
into an oscillating cup and treated with calcium and a kaolincephalin reagent. As the blood starts to clot, the viscoelasticity
changes, and the blood starts to exert force on a pin that is
suspended in the blood. The torque on the pin is converted into
an electrical signal that results in a graphical representation of the
clot formation and strength over time. As fibrinolysis begins and
the clot starts to degrade, the force on the pin decreases and the
resulting graph shows the clot dissolving. ROTEM is performed
similarly, but with blood placed into a stationary cup, and an
oscillating pin suspended into the blood sample. ROTEM also
offers the possibility to use different activator reagents to assess
different components of coagulation independently (such as the
intrinsic pathway, extrinsic pathway, heparinization, fibrinogen
contribution, and fibrinolysis. For an example of a ROTEM
graph, see Figure 2.
Similar to patients with cirrhosis, patients with ALF generally
have TEG parameters within normal limits. It has been shown
that despite the average INR values of 3.4 (1.5–9.6) TEG
parameters are within normal limits for adult ALF patients (8).
Data on the use of VHAs specifically in pediatric patients with
acute liver failure are lacking, and so one must extrapolate from
the adult literature.
Hemostasis in children is an evolving process; there are
age-dependent differences in the quantity and quality of
hemostatic proteins that may further complicate the diagnosis
of coagulopathy in children (29). A recent review summarized
the published reference ranges for VHA testing in pediatrics
and found that clotting times and clot formation times were
shorter in healthy infants <6 months of age, suggesting more
rapid initiation of clotting in this youngest pediatric age group
(38). Generally, however, there were no significant differences
found between children older than 6 months and adults in the
parameters assessed by the assays, suggesting that assessment
of clotting by VHAs is age-independent for children >6
months and adults. Utilization of VHAs in PALF patients
may therefore provide a more accurate and reliable measure
guiding transfusion practices and minimize unnecessary blood
product administration.
THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS
The coagulopathy and bleeding risks in acute and chronic liver
failure are significantly different. Since portal hypertension is not
significant in PALF and the thrombocytopenia is mild, bleeding
risk is usually less compared to chronic liver disease (12).
There are no transfusion guidelines available for PALF and this
leads to the substantial use of prophylactic blood products. There
are no current pediatric cutoff values for the use of prophylactic
transfusions of plasma, yet in adults an INR value of >7 with
TEG confirming marked prolongation of clot formation, FFP
transfusion is advised to maintain an INR between 5 and 7 (8). In
PALF prophylactic correction of coagulopathy with fresh frozen
plasma or thrombocytopenia with platelet administration is not
recommended and should be avoided since the spontaneous
bleeding complications are relatively uncommon (9, 12). In
addition, INR trend, which is a commonly followed prognostic
indicator in PALF, will be obscured with plasma administration.
The currently available coagulation tests, other than VHA tests,
do not measure the risk of bleeding accurately. Relying solely
on those tests to guide transfusions will lead to patients being
exposed to unnecessary blood products, leading to risk of fluid
overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and
thrombosis risk (8).
Viscoelastic hemostatic assay tests, in contrast, may be able
to provide the clinician with a more accurate assessment of
coagulopathy. TEG and ROTEM have been used to develop
resuscitation guidelines in adult trauma patients (39–41) and
their use has been shown to decrease transfusions and mortality
(41). Unfortunately there are currently no such guidelines
published for either adult or pediatric acute liver failure patients.
The use of VHAs in PALF would therefore require as astute
clinician, trained in the interpretation of either TEG or ROTEM,
in order to appropriately determine when interventions such as
plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, or antifibrinolytics would be
indicated for the pediatric patient with acute liver failure who is
either at risk for, or currently bleeding.
Although it is generally mild, thrombocytopenia is the most
significant contributor to the coagulopathic state in acute liver
failure (8). Correction of platelet count and coagulopathy for
high-risk procedures, such as liver biopsy and intracranial
pressure (ICP) monitor placement, should be considered (18,
42). There are no cut-off values for preprocedural correction of
coagulopathy in PALF, however in a recent survey among the
participants of the Coagulation in Liver Disease Symposium,
50% of respondents suggested a cut-off value of INR > 1.5 and
platelets of >30,000/mm3for liver biopsy, and INR > 1.5 and
platelet count of >50,000 mm3for intracranial pressure monitor
placement (18, 19, 42).
Vitamin K and fibrinogen deficiencies may prolong the
INR/PT values and should be corrected as well. Oral or parenteral
vitamin K should be considered if deficiency is suspected (34, 35).
Cryoprecipitate may be used to keep fibrinogen in the lownormal range (150 mg/dl) and can be adjusted according to
TEG values. Cryoprecipitate is a plasma-derived, concentrated
product containing fibrinogen, Factor VIII, Factor XIII, vWF,
and fibronectin. One unit of cryoprecipitate per 5 kg of body
weight will increase fibrinogen by about 100 mg/dL. There are
also plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrates available for the
repletion of fibrinogen, but they are currently only approved for
use in congenital fibrinogen deficiency and may not be available
at all centers.
Pre-procedure correction of coagulopathy can be
accomplished with low volume products such as Prothrombin
Complex Concentrate (PCC) and recombinant activated factor
VII (rFVIIa) (43). Prothrombin Complex Concentrate is a
plasma-derived product containing clotting factors II, VII,
IX, and X that is currently approved for reversing vitamin K
antagonists. It has a low volume of administration and higher
concentration of factors compared to plasma, which makes it

an attractive alternative to FFP for factor repletion. There are
several reports using PCC for patients with liver disease, some
using a standard dose such as 25 units/kg, and others using
an INR-based dosing regimen, similar to what would be used
in vitamin K antagonist reversal (44). Caution is advised with
administration of PCC given the lack of natural anticoagulants
in this product compared to plasma, and the possibility of
provoking thrombosis.
rFVIIa given at a dose of 20–40 mcg/kg, administered 30 min
before the procedure has a rapid onset of action and a low volume
of infusion making it another option for use prior to invasive
procedures (42). However, administration of rFVIIa requires
caution due to high cost and the risk of potentially serious
thrombotic events (8, 45, 46).
Treatment goals in PALF should focus on acute
bleeding management and prevention of infection, uremia,
and GI bleeding, rather than prophylactic correction of
laboratory values.
Antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid and
tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibit plasmin and prevent fibrin
clot degradation. Although it has been shown that TXA may
reduce blood loss during liver trauma or liver transplantation,
there is no proven benefit for acute bleeding in PALF (46).
These agents may be useful, however, in bleeding patients with
documented hyperfibrinolysis seen on VHAs. These agents are
frequently used in pediatric liver transplantation surgery at
variable doses (29). A starting dose of TXA is typically 10
mg/kg given intravenously for bleeding. Similar to PCC and
rFVIIa, caution should be taken with antifibrinolytics in patient
with a history of thrombosis, and also any history of DIC or
renal impairment.
Bacterial infections in ALF may potentiate the risk of
bleeding, although the mechanism is speculative. Endotoxins and
cytokines produced during infection may induce disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), inhibit platelet function, and
enhance the effects of nitric oxide. Therefore, appropriate
antibacterial prophylaxis and treatment of known infection is
recommended (13).
Renal failure is also a common complication of acute
liver failure. Uremia may further hinder primary hemostasis
Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 618119

Bulut et al. Hemostasis in Pediatric Liver Failure
due to platelet dysfunction and impaired platelet-vessel wall
interaction (47). Prevention and treatment of superimposed
infections and renal failure are essential in order to prevent
bleeding complications.
Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding is rare in PALF,
however the American Association of Study of Liver Disease
(AASLD) guidelines recommend histamine (H2) blockers or
proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis of gastric bleeding in
ICU setting (8, 34, 48).
There are no guidelines for the resuscitation of acute bleeding
in acute liver failure and transfusion of blood products have been
associated with increased morbidity (48). Restrictive transfusion
strategy with a threshold hemoglobin of >7 g/dL with a posttransfusion target of 7–9 g/dL are frequently utilized in a
hemodynamically stable patient (15, 25, 42).
A catastrophic bleeding in PALF is very rare, most bleeding
complications are clinically insignificant. Spontaneous bleeding
usually due to self-limited upper gastrointestinal bleeding or
post-procedural bleeding due to ICP placement (35). In case of
catastrophic bleeding utilization of massive transfusion protocol
may be warranted. Depending on patient laboratory values, a
decisions can be made to give platelets, FFP, cryoprecipitate
accordingly. If there is continues bleeding despite appropriate
replacement of blood products, then PCC, of rFVIIa and TXA
can be utilized.
SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Hemostasis in pediatric acute liver failure exists in a rebalanced
state due to concomitant changes in pro- and anti-coagulant
mechanisms. This rebalanced hemostasis and lack of additional
risk factors for bleeding (such as esophageal varices and portal
hypertension that are commonly seen in chronic liver failure),
leads to a low rate of spontaneous significant bleeding in PALF.
Current screening coagulation tests, such as the INR and PT
are not predictive of acute bleeding and have certain limitations.
International Normalized Ratio is useful for assessing severity of
disease, however its use to evaluate one’s bleeding risk is limited.
Prophylactic FFP transfusion has not been shown reduce the
risk of spontaneous bleeding and is not recommended in PALF.
Arbitrary FFP and blood product transfusions may harm the
patient with increased risks for fluid overload, cerebral edema,
and elevated intracranial pressure. In addition, they will obscure
the INR trend as a prognostic marker. Coagulopathy should be
carefully evaluated and treated prior to high-risk procedures.
Utilization of viscoelastic tests in PALF patients may provide
an accurate assessment of bleeding risk, prevent unnecessary
administration of blood products, lessen complications, and
improve outcome. Further studies are necessary to characterize
the coagulopathy in children with acute liver failure and develop
treatment guidelines.
Understanding the pathophysiology of coagulopathy in PALF
is important when evaluating pros and cons of transfusion and
maintaining the delicate hemostatic balance. Etiology of PALF is
different from adults, and there are age specific differences in procoagulant and anti-coagulant factors. It is important to maintain
the fragile balance of hemostasis with restrictive transfusion
strategies, and prevention of infection and uremia.
