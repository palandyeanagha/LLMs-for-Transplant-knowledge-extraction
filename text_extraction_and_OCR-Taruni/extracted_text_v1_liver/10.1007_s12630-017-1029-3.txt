Abstract
Purpose Vasoplegia is a clinical syndrome marked by
severe arteriolar vasodilatation, hypotension, and low
systemic vascular resistance refractory to multiple
vasopressor treatment. We report our experience with
hydroxocobalamin (B12) infusion as a potential rescue
adjunct for refractory vasoplegia during cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB).
Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of 33
patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1 January 2013
and 31 December 2015, who were given intravenous B12 for
refractory hypotension during, or immediately following,
CPB. We assessed mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses
using semi-parametric group-based models (trajectory
analysis). Vasopressor use was evaluated by
norepinephrine-equivalent rates calculated five minutes
prior, and up to 60 min following, B12 administration.
Results Patients were mostly male (82%), had a mean
(SD) age of 53 (13) yr, and median (IQR) EuroSCORE
mortality index of 9 [4-40]. Four patterns of MAP
responses to B12 were identified. In Group 1 (‘‘poor
responders’’) nine of 33 patients (27%) had the highest
median [IQR] mortality risk (EuroSCORE 40 [4-52]),
lowest mean pre-B12 MAP (50 mmHg), and minimal
hemodynamic response in spite of continued vasopressor
support. In contrast, Group 2 ‘‘responders’’ (8/33, 24%)
showed a brisk MAP response ([ 15 mmHg) to B12,
sustained for[60 min post-infusion, with 50% vasopressor
reduction. Groups 3 and 4 had the lowest median mortality
risk (EuroSCORE 8) and highest pre-B12 MAP (72 mmHg).
Although Group 3 patients (‘‘sustainers’’; 9/33, 27%)
showed a sustained MAP improvement, those in Group 4
(‘‘rebounders’’; 7/33, 21%) were characterized by
hypertensive overshoot followed by a decrease in MAP.
Conclusion These data indicate considerable
heterogeneity in patient response to B12, potentially
dependent on both patient preoperative condition and
non-standardized time of administration. B12 may provide
a useful alternative therapy for refractory hypotension and
vasoplegia, but controlled clinical trials to assess efficacy
are needed.

(82 %), d’un aˆge moyen (E´T) de 53 (13) ans, et
pre´sentaient un indice de mortalite´ EuroSCORE me´dian
(E´IQ) de 9 [4-40]. Quatre types de re´ponses de la TAM a` la

Vasoplegia is a clinical syndrome marked by severe
arteriolar vasodilatation, hypotension, and low systemic
vascular resistance (SVR) refractory to multiple
catecholamine or other vasopressor interventions. This
syndrome occurs in 5-20% of cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB) cases and can result in mortality rates of 25-50%.
However, the optimal choice of interventional agent is
subject to debate,1 and the evidence for efficacy of any one
drug is generally low to moderate.2
Overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) contributes to both
systemic inflammatory responses and hypo-responsiveness
to vasopressors.3-6 Consequently, recent vasoplegia rescue
therapies have incorporated the NO synthase inhibitor
methylene blue (MB).5,7,8 Data from several small trials
suggest MB may reduce vasoplegia duration and
vasopressor use, and ultimately morbidity and
mortality.4,9 However, MB may precipitate serious
adverse events (such as cardiac dysrhythmias,
methemoglobinemia, and serotonin toxicity) and
interferes with colorimetric laboratory assays10 and tissue
oximetry.6,11 More recently, a number of cases have been
described where hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12) was
administered for refractory vasoplegia syndrome.12-16 B12
is an NO scavenger commonly used in the treatment of
acute cyanide poisoning; administration is associated with
clinically significant increases in blood pressure.12-16
The aim of this present report was to describe the results
from a retrospective chart review of patients from a single
institution undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, where
B12 was used to reverse perioperative or post-CPB
hypotension. We describe patterns of B12 use, patient
hemodynamic responses, and clinical characteristics in this
case series.
Methods
This study was a single-centre retrospective review of
patients undergoing CPB who received B12 to treat
vasoplegia. The study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Virginia
Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS),
which waived the need for patient consent (IRB
HM20006336 CR1). We followed PROCESS (Preferred
Reporting Of CasE Series in Surgery)17 guidelines in
conducting and reporting this study.
Adult (C 18 yr) cardiac surgery patients having an
emergency pharmacy order for IV hydroxocobalamin
between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015 were
identified from the VCUHS pharmacy database. Electronic
records for these patients were manually reviewed by a
single investigator (P.S.) to confirm use of B12 and to
identify and eliminate duplicate or erroneously captured
records.
Anesthetic induction and maintenance were at the
discretion of the attending anesthesiologist and team.
Cardiopulmonary bypass management included the use of
a standard centrifugal pump, solid open shell reservoir, and
cardiotomy suction. Bypass was conducted under moderate
(approx. 32C) systemic hypothermia. Patients were
anticoagulated with porcine heparin (300 IUkg-1 as a
pre-CPB loading dose). Non-pulsatile pump flow was
maintained at 2.5 Lmin-1
m-2, with a target perfusion
pressure of 60-80 mmHg. During surgery, blood products

and fluids were administered at the discretion of the cardiac
team using an established algorithm based on
thromboelastography (TEGTM), platelet count, fibrinogen,
and prothrombin/international normalized ratio. After
weaning from CPB, heparinization was reversed using a
1:1 ratio of protamine to the initial heparin dose
administered. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was
measured continuously during surgery using a radial or
femoral arterial catheter. If two invasive blood pressures
were available, we used the higher measurement for
analysis. Measurement of cardiac output via placement of
pulmonary arterial catheters was not routine clinical
practice at this institution.
Emergency off-label use of MB and/or B12 (rescue
therapy) was indicated when the attending surgeon and
anesthesiologist agreed that there was significant potential
for ongoing patient hemodynamic instability to contribute
to vasodilatory shock and was sufficiently life-threatening
to require immediate intervention. Rescue therapy was
initiated if the patient was unable to sustain an MAP[65
mmHg despite 0.1 lgkg-1
min-1 norepinephrine, 0.04
unitmin-1 vasopressin, and 0.1 lgkg-1
min-1
epinephrine. These patients received MB (10 mgmL-1;
1-2 mgkg-1
) and/or reconstituted hydroxocobalamin
(B12; 5 g, 20 mgmL-1
; CyanokitTM; Meridian/Pfizer,
Sarasota, FL, USA), administered as an intravenous bolus
over 15 min.
Patient demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were
obtained from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)
database (Table 1). Intraoperative MAP, vasopressor use,
rescue adjuvant drug (MB, B12) use, and time of
administration were obtained for patients prior to January
2015 (n = 8) on the Innovian Anesthesia information
platform (Dra¨ger Inc; Telford, PA, USA) and after that date
(n = 25) on Surginet Anesthesia (Cerner Corporation;
Kansas, MO, USA). Vasopressor doses at four standardized
times (five minutes before B12 administration; at B12
administration; and 30 and 60 min after B12 administration)
were extracted from patient run charts by a single
investigator (P.S.). Study data were collated and managed
using REDCap electronic data capture tools, hosted at
VCUHS.18 Data for each subject were stored on individual
spreadsheets and screened for time-stamp and transcription
errors.
Statistical analysis
Summary data are reported as mean (standard deviation
[SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]). Descriptive
statistics were calculated in SAS JMP Pro 12.2.0 (SAS
Institute; Cary, NC, USA). We used semiparametric groupbased mixture models to identify patient clusters of MAP
response following B12 administration.19,20 Models were
fitted to MAP measurements sampled at five-minute
intervals from the time of B12 infusion until 110 min
post-infusion. Mean trajectory shape for each group was
estimated by polynomial regression using proc traj 19,20
(SAS v.9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Initially,
separate models were built with one through four subgroup trajectories; the best-fit polynomial was then

determined for each trajectory by repeated analytic runs
until the best combination (constant, linear, quadratic, or
cubic) resulted in minimization of the Bayesian
information criterion score and a significant P value for
each trajectory component.21 Vasopressor dosages were
converted to norepinephrine-equivalent units
(lgkg-1
min-1), assuming dose equivalence of 1 lg
norepinephrine to 1 lg epinephrine, 0.007 lg dopamine,
and 2.5 U vasopressin, respectively.22,23
Results
Of the 117 patient records originally identified and
screened, 34 met inclusion criteria in being nonduplicated records of adult cardiac surgery patients
undergoing CPB and receiving a single bolus of MB and/
or B12. The remaining 83 records were duplicates (n = 3),
or referred to non-cardiac surgical patients (n = 19), burn/
smoke inhalation (n = 22) patients, or patients who were
not recorded as receiving B12 (n = 39). The record for one
additional patient was excluded because MAP data were
unavailable for the relevant times before and after B12
administration. There were therefore 33 patient records
available for analysis.
The mean (SD) patient age was 53 (13) yr, with mean
(SD) body mass of 74 (14) kg; 28 of 33 (82%) patients
were male. Patient preoperative conditions and risk
factors24 are given in Table 1. The median [IQR]
EuroSCORE mortality index was 9 [4-40]. Eight of 33
patients (24%) were receiving two or more preoperative
medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium
channel blockers, or inotropes) at the time of surgery.
Fifteen subjects (45%) had moderate to poor renal function
(with two dialysis-dependent subjects). Twenty patients
(61%) had poor to severe left ventricular dysfunction
(ejection fraction [EF] B 30%), and 20 patients (61%) had
moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Intraoperative descriptors and surgical procedures are
shown in Table 2. Three patients (9%) experienced cardiac
arrest during surgery, but were successfully resuscitated.
All patients survived to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer;
30-day mortality was four of 33 patients (12%).
Twenty patients (61%) received B12 during CPB at a
median [IQR] time of 76 [28-138] min after the start of
CPB, and 13 patients received it at a median [IQR] time of
84 [33-113] min post-CPB. Methylene blue was given to
15 patients (45%), two patients approximately 70 min
before CPB, ten patients approximately 100 [35-157] min
after CPB start, and three patients approximately 53 min
post-bypass. Twelve patients (36%) received MB prior to
B12 administration and three patients (9%) after B12
administration (Table 3).

The MAP response following B12 administration was
described by a four-group trajectory model, with Groups 1
and 3 described by linear trajectories and Groups 2 and 4
by cubic trajectories (Table 4). Visual inspection (Fig. 1)
suggested that these groups could be categorized as ‘‘poor
responders’’ (Group 1), ‘‘responders’’ (Group 2),
‘‘sustainers’’ (Group 3), and ‘‘rebounders’’ (Group 4).
Groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A) consisted primarily (14/17) of
patients administered B12 during bypass and with median
[IQR] MAP prior to B12 of 55 [48-59] mmHg. Group 1
patients (9/33; 27%) showed little or no immediate
response to B12 although MAP continued to increase
slowly (0.1 mmHgmin-1
) over the next two hours. Three
patients received MB before, and one patient 72 min after,
B12 administration. Group 2 patients (8/33; 24%) were
characterized by a brisk response to B12 within 20 min of
administration, followed by sustained maintenance of MAP
[65 mmHg. Three patients received MB before, and one
patient over four hours after, B12 administration. Groups 3
and 4 (Fig 1B) consisted mainly of subjects administered
B12 after bypass (10/16 subjects) and with MAP at the time
of B12 administration above the 65 mmHg threshold
(median [IQR] MAP = 71[64-80] mmHg). Group 3 (9/
33; 27%) showed a small constant increase in MAP over
the duration of the post-B12 monitoring period, resulting in
a total increase of approximately 10 mmHg over 110 min.
Three patients received MB before B12. In contrast, Group
4 subjects (i.e., ‘‘rebounders’’; 7/33; 21%) showed an
apparent hypertensive overshoot, peaking at MAP [ 100
mmHg at approximately 30 min post-B12 infusion,
followed by a decline in MAP to approximately 65
mmHg over the next hour. Three patients received MB
before B12. Two of these seven patients received further
vasopressor infusions, and one patient received MB 80 min
after B12 administration.
Patient characteristics stratified by MAP response are
shown in Table 5. Compared to other groups, Group 1
‘‘non-responders’’ were sick patients, with a high median
[IQR] EuroSCORE mortality index of 40 [4-48].

Compared to other groups, they were characterized by
relatively longer surgery times, time on bypass, duration of
mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. Two patients in
this group subsequently died. Group 2 ‘‘responders’’,
although critically ill (preoperative EF \ 30%; median
[IQR] EuroSCORE 31 [4-39]), had relatively shorter
ventilation duration and length of ICU stay. Two patients
in this group subsequently died. Groups 3 and 4 (Fig 1B)
had relatively low median [IQR] estimated risk of mortality
(EuroSCORE 7 [4-14]), relatively short time on
mechanical ventilation, and relatively short ICU stays
(Table 5). There were no deaths at 30 days in these groups.
Group 1 patients showed little change in
norepinephrine-equivalent vasopressor use over the next
hour subsequent to B12 administration. The brisk MAP
response and recovery of Group 2 (‘‘responders’’) was
associated with an approximate 50% reduction of
vasopressors by one hour post-B12 infusion. Patients in
Group 4 (‘‘rebounders’’) also showed an approximate
three-fold reduction in vasopressor dosages; Group 3
‘‘sustainers’’ showed little or no reduction in vasopressor
dosages (Fig. 2).
Discussion
In this case series, B12 appeared to benefit a small subset of
patients with high preoperative risk of mortality and low
perioperative MAP refractory to multiple vasopressors and
fluid support. In these patients, MAP increased to [ 65
mmHg within 15-30 min and was sustained for the duration
of the monitoring period ([ 60 min post-B12
administration). In contrast, other patients exhibited
apparent B12 hypersensitivity, characterized by MAP
overshoot and rebound hypotension, while the most
critically ill group of patients showed little or no
response. This patient heterogeneity in patient response
following B12 administration may reflect the multifactorial
etiology of vasoplegia,1 but might also be determined by
differences in individual clinician discretion in determining

optimal target MAP requirements24 and when to initiate
rescue therapy.
Optimal dosing of B12 for vasodilatory shock is
unknown. Case studies reported bolus doses of 5 g over
10 to 15 min,12,15,25 as recommended per manufacturer for
cyanide toxicity. Case studies of three liver transplant
patients reported repeated doses of 125-250 mg
supplemented by 250-500 mghr-1 infusions.14,16 Higher
than recommended dosages of MB have been associated
with splanchnic vasospasm; it is unknown if this is a
potential problem with B12 administration. Abrupt and
prolonged increases in MAP induced by norepinephrine
and NO inhibitors in patients with septic shock have been
associated with increased mortality24; over the longer term,
blood pressure overshoot resulting from excessive
vasoconstriction may result in ischemic injury and
increased incidence of acute kidney injury and multiple
organ failure.26 Optimal timing of B12 administration is
also unknown. In septic shock, delayed initiation of fluid
and pressor therapies contributes to poor patient
outcomes.27 When refractory vasodilatory shock is
prolonged, mortality risk is increased, and chances of any
therapy resulting in clinical improvement are much lower.
In general, both MB and B12 are administered as treatments
of last resort; however, B12 has been administered during
CPB,12,14,15 and up to 48 hr post-surgery.13
Side effects of B12 administration include chromaturia
and interference with colorimetric laboratory tests.
Although chromaturia has been described as ‘benign and
self-limited’,25 B12 has the potential to disrupt
hemodialysis.28 Other than anecdotal reports,25 there are
few data on effects of B12 on oximetry devices.

There are some limitations to this case series. Because
this was an observational case series, there were no
controls. We could not always clearly differentiate whether
refractory hypotension was due to low vascular resistance
(i.e., vasoplegia) rather than low cardiac output or a
central-peripheral blood pressure gradient. Although
peripheral and central MAP measurements are considered
interchangeable, the relatively wide limits of agreement
(16 mmHg) between methods29 may also account in part
for differences in MAP. Clinician identification of
administration indications was not standardized, thus
contributing to patient heterogeneity in response. We
expressed vasopressor doses in norepinephrine-equivalent
units for consistency with previous literature on
vasoplegia.23 However, we acknowledge that this method
masks differences in pharmacodynamics and mode of
action of the different vasopressor agents. Furthermore,
charting of vasopressor use was not uniform across data
logging systems, and bolus dosages were frequently
omitted from case records, likely underestimating total
vasopressor doses. Finally, MAP ‘groups’ identified for
these patients result from statistical trajectory analysis
modelling with small sample sizes and should be regarded
only as heuristic.
Although vitamin B12 administration may provide a
useful alternative therapy for refractory hypotension and
vasoplegia, randomized controlled clinical trials are needed
to assess efficacy, protocols for routine use, and appropriate
dosing.30
