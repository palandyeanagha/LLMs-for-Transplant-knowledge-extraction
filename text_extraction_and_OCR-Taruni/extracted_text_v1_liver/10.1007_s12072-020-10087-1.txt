Abstract
Background and aims Liver injury is found in some of patients with COVID-19. Liver injury of COVID-19 patients based 
on severity grading and abdominal radiological signs have not been reported until now. The aim of our study is to determine 
clinical profles of the patients based on severity grading, describe abdominal radiological signs, and investigate the correlations of the severity with clinical profles and radiological signs.
Methods This retrospective cohort study included 115 patients with COVID-19 from Jan 2020 to Feb 2020. Medical records 
of the patients were collected and CT images were reviewed.
Results Common clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 were fever (68.70%), cough (56.52%), fatigue (31.30%); 
some of them had gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, 12.17%; nausea or vomiting 7.83%; inappetence, 7.83%). Abnormal 
liver function was observed in some of patients with COVID-19. Signifcant diferences in the levels of AST, albumin,CRP 
were observed among diferent groups classifed by the severity. Common fndings of upper abdominal CT scan were liver 
hypodensity (26.09%) and pericholecystic fat stranding (21.27%); liver hypodensity was more frequently found in critical 
cases (58.82%). The severity of COVID-19 correlated with semi-quantitative CT score of pulmonary lesions, CT-quantifed 
liver/spleen attenuation ratio in patients with COVID-19.
Conclusions Some of the patients with COVID-19 displayed liver damage revealed by liver functional tests and upper 
abdominal CT imaging, and the severity of COVID-19 patients correlated with some of liver functional tests and CT signs; 
thus, it will allow an earlier identifcation of high-risk patients for early efective intervention.

Introduction
2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a zoonotic 
illness caused by a new viral pathogen named as the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) 
[1].The rapid spread of COVID-19 has created a global 
health crisis. Lung is considered as a major organ attacked 
by SARS-CoV-2. Besides the respiratory system, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 leads to various degrees of damage to 
other organs such as the liver, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract [2–5]. The majority of COVID-19 patients only 
sufered mild symptoms; while some COVID-19 patients 
progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), and eventually resulted in multiple organ failure 
(MOF) [1, 6].
Previous studies showed that some of patients infected 
by SARS-CoV-2 had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, inappetence, nausea and vomiting [7–9]. In addition, liver injury occurred in patients with 
COVID-19 [8–10].The abnormality of liver function tests 
was observed in some of COVID-19 patients at admission 
[11]. Pathological examination of COVID-19 patient showed 
hepatocyte degeneration accompanied by focal necrosis, 
moderate steatosis, infltration of leukocytes into lobular 
and portal area, and sinusoidal congestion [12]. Thus, all 
these indicated liver involvement in patients infected by 
SARS-CoV-2. While previous studies collected the data 
from the whole cohort of patients and some of them probably had chronic liver diseases.
Chest CT, a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, plays a central role in the diagnosis and classifcation 
of COVID-19 pneumonia [13–15]. Moreover, radiological 
signs of chest CT varied with the course of diseases, and 
the change of radiological signs might be associated with 
the outcomes of diseases [15, 16]. Liver injury in patients 
infected by SARS-CoV-2 might result in radiological change 
in liver. However, radiological fndings of abdominal CT 
scan have not been explored so far. Thus, the aim of our 
study is to determine clinical profles of the COVID-19 
patients based on severity grading, describe abdominal 
radiological signs, and investigate the correlations of the 
severity with clinical profles and radiological signs.
Materials and methods
Study population
Our retrospective study was performed at Cancer Center of 
Union Hospital and main campus of Union Hospital, Tongji 
Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from Jan 24, 2020 to Feb 17, 2020. 178 consecutive patients with COVID19 pneumonia were enrolled. The 
diagnosis of COVID19 patients are: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) positive nucleic acid of the virus (RTPCR analysis of throat swab specimens). A severity-grading 
system for patients with COVID19 was issued by National 
Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and 
National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of 
the People’s Republic of China. The severity of COVID19 
patients is classifed into four grades: mild, ordinary, severe 
and critical [13]. Mild cases: symptomatic infection includes 
fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache or myalgia, but 
there were no pneumonia signs on chest imaging. Ordinary 
cases: symptomatic infection includes fever, cough, sore 
throat, fatigue, headache or myalgia, and pneumonia signs 
showed on chest imaging, meanwhile, these patients do not 
have any of the severe or critical symptoms and complications described below. Severe cases: the disease progresses 
to meet any of the following conditions: ① signifcantly 
increased respiration rate: RR≥30/min; ② SpO2≤93% 
from a finger oximeter; ③ PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300  mmHg; ④ 
patients with>50% lesions progression within 24–48 h in 
pulmonary imaging. Critical cases: with any of the following 
conditions: ① respiratory failure which requires mechanical 
ventilation; ② shock; ③ accompanied by other organ failure 
that needs ICU monitoring and treatment. Inclusion criteria were as follows: ① confrmed cases with COVID-19; 
② pneumonia manifestation on chest CT scan; ③ CT scan

and laboratory examinations were performed within 2 days 
after admission. Exclusion criteria included: ① patients who 
received antiviral treatment for more than 3 days before 
admission, such as interferon, chloroquine phosphate, 
arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, which may result in the alleviation of COVID-19 and side efects including GI symptoms 
and drug-induced liver injury, etc., (n=30). ② CT images 
of upper abdomen were not obtained (n=19); ③ patients 
with hematological malignancy who were receiving chemotherapy (n=6); ④ patients with severe underlying pulmonary 
diseases (n=4); ⑤ patients with chronic liver diseases and 
liver cancer (n=4) (Fig. 1). 
Data collection
The pertinent data of the patients were collected from medical records and tabulated in a database. The pertinent data of 
the patients included demographic data; presenting symptoms and signs; medical history; laboratory tests; imaging 
fndings; therapeutic process.
Imaging technique and imaging analysis
All CT examinations were performed with one of the following three scanners: 64-detector spiral CT scanner (Somatom 
Defnition AS, Siemens, Germany), gemstone spectral CT 
scanner (Discovery CT750 HD, GE, USA), 16-detector spiral CT scanner (Activion 16, Toshiba, Japan). Images were 
reconstructed into lung window and soft tissue mediastinal 
window with a slice thickness of 1.5 mm, 2 mm or 5 mm 
and an interval of 1.5 mm, 2 mm or 5 mm, respectively. The 
radiological evaluation included pulmonary involvement 
and abnormal signs of upper abdomen. All CT images were 
independently reviewed and the fndings were recorded by 
two experienced radiologists who were unaware of clinical 
data. For semi-quantitative and qualitative imaging evaluation, discrepant evaluation was jointly re-evaluated to reach 
a fnal consensus [17–19]; whereas, intraclass correlation 
coefcient (ICC) was introduced to assess interobserver consistency for quantitative imaging evaluation. The severity 
of pneumonia was evaluated by a semi-quantitative scoring 
system, i.e., each of the 5 lung lobes was visually scored 
from 0 to 5 as: 0, no involvement; 1, <5% involvement; 
2, 5–25% involvement; 3, 26–49% involvement; 4, 50–75% 
involvement; 5, >75% involvement. The total CT score was 
the sum of individual lobar scores and ranged from 0 (no 
involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement) [20, 21]. Radiologic signs reviewed in upper abdominal CT scan include: 
hepatomegaly, the density of liver, periportal edema, pericholecystic fat stranding, portal lymphadenopathy, biliary 
ductal dilatation, ascites. Liver hypodensity was defned 
when the density of liver is homogeneous or heterogeneous lower than or nearly equal to that of spleen. CT-quantifed hepatic density was measured by liver-to-spleen (L/S) 
attenuation ratio. Hepatic and splenic CT attenuation values 
were measured using regions of interest (ROI)>100 mm2
 in 
area [22] on the PACS (CARESTRAM 3.1.S12.1, Canada). 
Two ROIs were in the right liver lobe, one ROI in the left 
liver lobe and three ROIs in the spleen. ROI should include 
a greater area of the liver and spleen whenever possible, 
Fig. 1 Flowchart of the patients’ selection, inclusion, and exclusion

meanwhile ROI selection should exclude regions of hepatic 
vessels and bile ducts (Fig. S1). Then L/S ratio was calculated by taking mean HU measurement of liver lobe ROIs 
and dividing it by the mean splenic HU measurement of its 
ROIs (Fig.S1).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard 
deviation for normal distribution data and median (25th–75th 
percentiles) if the distribution was skewed. Categorical variables were presented as count (percentage). The interobserver agreement for measurement of CT-quantifed hepatic 
density was determined using the intraclass correlation efcient (ICC). The level of agreement was generally recognized as follows: poor, ICC<0.20; fair, 0.2<ICC≤0.40; 
moderate, 0.4<ICC≤0.60; good, 0.6<ICC≤0.80; and very 
good, 0.8<ICC≤1.0. The diferences of categorical variables among groups were analyzed by Chi-square test (the 
Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited) and 
continuous variables by Kruskal–Wallis H test. The correlation of categorical variables was analyzed by Spearman 
correlation test and continuous variables by Pearson correlation test. All statistical tests were two-sided. p value less 
than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifcance. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
Clinical presentation
115 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our study. The patients were classifed 
into mild group, ordinary group, severe group and critical 
group according to the severity [13]. Mild cases without 
pneumonia manifestation did not receive inpatient hospital care in Wuhan, China, so mild cases were not included 
in our study. Thus, the enrolled patients included ordinary 
cases (50 patients), severe cases (48 patients) and critical 
cases (17 patients) (Fig. 1). The median age of enrolled 
patients were 66 years (IQR: 60–70), there was 58 males 
and 57 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.02:1 (Supplementary Table 1). Signifcant diference in patients’ age 
existed among diferent groups, which revealed that older 
patients were at higher risk for severe illness. Then, the 
clinical manifestations of the patients were analyzed, and 
the results showed fever in 68.70% (79/115) of the patients, 
cough in 56.52% (65/115), fatigue in 31.30% (36/115), and 
shortness of breath in 13.91% (16/115) of the patients (Supplementary Table 1). Thirdly, gastrointestinal symptoms 
were determined in the patients, and we found that 12.17% 
(14/115) of the cases had diarrhea, 7.83% (9/115) of the 
cases with nausea or vomiting, 7.83% (9/115) of the cases 
with inappetence (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, no 
signifcant diferences in clinical manifestions were evident 
among diferent groups.
Laboratory tests (peripheral blood routine 
examination and clinical biochemistry)
Laboratory results of the patients containing peripheral 
blood routine examination and clinical biochemistry were 
summarized in Table 1 at the time of baseline evaluation. 
Firstly, blood routine examination of the patients was determined. Generally, the values of erythrocyte, leukocyte 
and platelet were within normal limit in most of COVID19 patients (Table 1). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 
54.78% of the COVID-19 patients and lymphocytopenia 
occurred in 100% of critical cases. T cell subsets were also 
analyzed and the results showed that CD3+, CD4+and 
CD8+T lymphocyte subsets were decreased in some of 
the COVID-19 patients. Compared with the ordinary group 
and the severe group, the proportion of CD3+, CD4+and 
CD8+T cells decreased signifcantly in the critical group 
(Table 1). Secondly, the parameters of liver functional tests 
were analyzed. Most of the patients had normal levels of 
AST, ALT, ALP, γGT and total bilirubin. Signifcant difference in AST level was observed among diferent groups. 
Liver synthetic function was also assessed by the detection 
of albumin and PT, and we found that 60.00% (69/115) of 
the cases had hypoalbuminemia, 3.88% of the cases had 
increased prothrombin time. Thirdly, biomarkers of renal 
function indicated by serum urea and creatinine showed that 
most of the patients had normal renal function (Table 1). 
Fourthly, some biomarkers of metabolic syndrome were collected and the results showed that no signifcant diferences 
in the levels of cholesterol (CHOL) and triglyceride (TG) 
were observed among diferent groups. Most of the patients 
had normal uric acid level; surprisingly, critical cases with 
the lowest level of uric acid (Table 1). Finally, abnormal 
CRP level was detected in 64.42% of the patients. Elevated 
AST level, hypoalbuminemia and increased CRP level were 
frequently found in critical cases.
Imaging fndings of chest and upper abdominal CT 
in COVID‑19 patients
Pneumonia in COVID-19 patients was commonly manifested as ground-glass opacity, smooth or irregular interlobular septal thickening, consolidation with air bronchogram, crazy-paving pattern, and pleura efusion (Figs. 2
and 3). Most of the patients sufered pneumonia in multiple lobes. The severity of pneumonia was evaluated by 
a semi-quantitative scoring system and the median score

of lung involvement was 11 (IQR: 8–15) (Table2). More 
importantly, significant difference in semi-quantitative 
scores of lung involvement was observed among diferent 
groups (Table2). Then, imaging features of abdominal CT 
were determined. Common CT fndings in upper abdominal CT scan were liver hypodensity and pericholecystic fat 
stranding (Table 2). Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal 
edema, edema of the gallbladder walls, periportal lymphadenopathy, biliary dilatation and ascites were not observed. 
Homogeneous or heterogeneous hepatic hypodensity was the 
most common CT fnding (Figs. 2 and 3). Liver hypodensity was observed in 26.09% (30/115) of the patients and 
statistical analysis revealed signifcant diference among 
diferent groups (Table2). Moreover, the liver-to-spleen 
(L/S) attenuation ratio was measured and the interobserver 
agreement for assessment of L/S attenuation ratios was very 
good (ICC=0.98). A decrease in the L/S attenuation ratio 
(<1) was detected in 16.52% of the whole cohort, up to 
47.06% of critical cases. Meanwhile, signifcant diference 
in the L/S attenuation ratio was observed among diferent 
groups (Table2). Finally, pericholecystic fat stranding was 
evaluated. Unfortunately, 21 cases were excluded due to the 
patients with cholecystolithiasis or cholecystectomy. Pericholecystic fat stranding was observed in 21.27% (21/94) 
of the patients (Fig. 3), but no signifcant diference was 
evident among diferent groups.

Correlation of severity grading with clinical 
manifestations, radiologic features and liver 
function tests
To evaluate the value of radiological features and liver function tests, the correlations of severity grading with clinical 
manifestations, CT features and liver function tests were 
determined. Firstly, the correlations of clinical manifestation with a panel of liver function tests and severity grading 
were investigated in patients with COVID-19 and the results 
showed no correlation of clinical manifestations with pulmonary lesions, severity grading and liver functional tests 
(Table S2); secondly, the correlations of semi-quantitative 
scoring of pulmonary lesions with a panel of liver function 
tests and severity grading were investigated in patients with 
COVID-19, and the correlation tests demonstrated that the 
score of pulmonary lesions was associated with liver function tests, severity grading and CRP (Table3). Thirdly, the 
correlations of severity grading with a panel of liver function tests, CRP and pulmonary lesions were determined. 
The results demonstrated the severity correlated with AST, 
albumin, CRP, semi-quantitative CT-scoring of pulmonary 
lesions and CT-quantified liver/spleen attenuation ratio 
(Table3).
Discussion
COVID-19 has turned into a global pandemic disease. Previous studies demonstrated coronavirus COVID-19 (SARSCoV-2) resulted in liver injury in the whole cohort [8–10], 
we described clinical profles and abdominal radiological 
features of COVID-19 patients according to severity grading, and then determined the correlation of radiological 
features with clinical profiles. Abnormal liver function 
tests were observed in some of COVID-19 patients, radiological signs of liver in non-contrast CT scan included liver 
hypodensity and pericholecystic fat stranding. The correlation tests demonstrated that disease severity correlated with 
AST, albumin, CRP, the score of pulmonary lesions, the L/S 
attenuation ratio. Thus, it will allow an earlier identifcation 
of high-risk patients for immediate efective intervention in 
future.
Gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with COVID-19 
were analyzed, and common GI symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and inappetence. The proportion of 
COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms in our study was similar to that of previous research [7]. GI symptoms in patients 
with COVID-19 may result from the infection of COVID-19 
in intestinal tissues [7]. In addition, the interaction between 
brain and gut might cause discomfort to the gastrointestinal 
tract. The results of peripheral routine blood examination 
showed the values of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet 
were within normal limit in most of the patients. Some of 
the patients had lymphocytopenia, especially CD3+T cells. 
CD3+T cells are mainly composed of CD4+T and CD8+T 
cells, CD4+T and CD8+T cells are critical for mediating 
clearance following many acute viral infections in the lung, 
which leads to a decrease in CD4+T and CD8+T cells [23, 
24]. A panel of liver functional tests was determined, and 
the result showed that some of the patients had abnormal 
liver function, and clinically signifcant liver injury was 
uncommon even in critical cases. The mechanism underlying liver damage has not been explored until now. Liver 
damage in the COVID-19 patients might be caused by viral 
infection of liver cells, adverse drug reactions, systemic 
infammation, underlying liver diseases, hypoxic hepatitis, 
etc. [3–5]. Xu et al. reported the drugs used for COVID-19

patients probably induced liver damage, such as antibiot-
ics, antiviral agents, etc.[5]. Thus, to exclude drug-induced 
liver injury (DILI), liver functional tests were collected 
within 2 days after admission. In addition, liver dysfunc-
tion occurred in patients with chronic liver diseases, so the 
patients with chronic liver diseases were excluded in our 
study. Thus, we speculate liver injury in COVID-19 patients 
might result from viral infection of liver cells, infamma-
tory responses, and hypoxic hepatitis in our study. Prelimi-
nary studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) receptor expression is enriched in cholangiocytes [25] and SARS-CoV-2 enters the target cell through ACE2 
receptor [25], which results in abnormality of serum γGT, 
a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury. Abnormal 
PT and hypoalbuminemia were found in some of COVID19 patients. Severe COVID-19 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus 
formation; abnormality in prothrombin time is relatively 
uncommon in initial presentations [26, 27]. Abnormal PT 
might result from liver injury or coagulopathy. Hypoalbu-
minemia is caused by liver dysfunction, heart failure, kidney 
damage, protein-losing enteropathy, and malnutrition. In our 
study, heart failure, kidney damage, protein-losing enteropa-
thy were not observed in our study. Thus, hypoalbuminemia 
would be caused by malnutrition or liver dysfunction. Inter-
estingly, hypoalbuminemia and increased AST level were 
frequently found in critical cases, and correlation analysis 
revealed the correlations of albumin and AST level with 
severity grading. Thus, biomarkers of liver function contain-
ing AST and albumin should be detected in patients with 
COVID-19.
Common fndings of upper abdominal CT scan in the 
patients with COVID-19 were mainly manifested as homo-
geneous or heterogeneous liver hypodensity and perichol-
ecystic fat stranding. Further study revealed the L/S attenu-
ation ratio and pulmonary lesions correlated positively with 
the severity of the disease. These indicated that the infection 
of SARS-CoV-2 may result in multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome (MODS) containing liver injury. Pathological 
examination of liver showed moderate steatosis and mild 
lobular and portal activity in a patient with COVID-19 [12]. 
Liver hypodensity was a common sign of liver steatosis or 
acute hepatitis, while other imaging signs of acute hepati-
tis, such as hepatomegaly, periportal edema, edema of the 
gallbladder wall, and periportal lymphadenopathy were not 
observed in patients with COVID-19. Thus, liver hypoden-
sity and a decrease in the L/S attenuation ratio might be 
attributed to liver steatosis. Obviously, transient elastog-
raphy (FibroScan) with controlled attenuation parameter 
(CAP) has demonstrated good accuracy in quantifying the 
levels of liver steatosis; however, most of the patients did 
not receive Fibroscan due to mild liver injury and uncov-

include NAFLD, alcoholism, hepatitis C infection, some 
drugs, autoimmune disease, malnutrition, etc. Liver steatosis 
resulting from NAFLD should be excluded. Some of clinical 
profles in the COVID-19 patients were diferent from those 
of NAFLD patients. Firstly, the enrolled patients had normal 
value for ALT and AST before hospital admission. Thus, 
liver damage was not caused by chronic liver diseases, such 
as NAFLD. Secondly, elevated levels of liver enzymes are 
often seen in NAFLD, hypoalbuminemia is often observed 
in COVD-19 patients. Thirdly, liver hypodensity on CT 
scans was improved within a short time in some COVID-19 
patients (Fig. S2); however, the improvement of CT sign 
needs a long period of time in NAFLD. Fourthly, no signifcant diferences in plasma lipid levels were observed 
among diferent groups of the COVID-19 patients divided 
by the severity. Thus, the hypothesis is supported by indirect 
evidences and it should be confrmed by a large sample of 
pathological examinations in future. More importantly, the 
mechanism underlying liver steatosis should be explored in 
the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, pericholecystic fat stranding, a common sign of abdominal CT 
scan, might be associated with infammation. Interestingly, 
enlargement of hilar lymph nodes and spleen were not found.
The correlations of clinical profles and radiological signs 
with severity grading were investigated, and the results 
showed severity grading correlated with AST, albumin, 
CRP, semi-quantitative scoring of pulmonary lesions, the 
liver-to-spleen (L/S) attenuation ratio. These indicated elevated AST level, hypoalbuminemia, a high CRP, a low L/S 
attenuation ratio, a high score of pulmonary lesions might 
be indicators of severe or critical cases. Our study demonstrated the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection correlated with 
CRP and pulmonary lesions, which was similar to previous studies. Interestingly, the severity correlates with AST, 
CT-quantifed liver/spleen attenuation ratio in patients with 
COVID-19. Elevated AST can be caused by liver injury, cardiovascular disease, kidney diseases, muscle disorders, etc. 
Elevated AST might result from multiple organ dysfunction, 
which is associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CT-quantifed liver/spleen attenuation ratio revealed the 
severity of liver damage, which was related to multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome.
Obviously, our study had several limitations. Firstly, 
it was a single-center retrospective study. Selection bias 
occurred in retrospective cohort studies, the patients with 
mild system and normal lung manifestation were excluded 
in our study. In addition, most of the enrolled patients were 
middle-aged and aged people. Secondly, the patients did not 
receive contrast-enhanced CT scan. Thirdly, limited number 
of the cases in our cohort might have resulted in the bias of 
the results. Finally, follow-up data of the patients were not 
provided. At the end of the 2-month follow-up, 106 patients 
survived, nine patients died. We analyzed the prognosis of 
COVID-19 patients; unfortunately, we did not get useful 
data due to small sample size and relatively few deaths. In 
conclusion: COVID-19 patients display abdominal and pulmonary CT imaging abnormalities and some of the patients 
have abnormal liver function. Furthermore, some of CT 
signs and CRP are positively correlated with severity grading; thus, it will allow an earlier identifcation of high-risk 
patients. Further studies should be performed to confrm our 
conclusion and develop suitable therapeutic strategies, and 
investigate the prognosis in future.
