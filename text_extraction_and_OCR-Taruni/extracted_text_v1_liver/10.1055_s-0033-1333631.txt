Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex and heterogeneous disease that occurs in the background of chronic liver
dysfunction. It is a unique and particularly challenging cancer
to treat because the dual forces of malignancy and underlying
liver disease must be simultaneously managed. This review
will outline current perspectives on epidemiological trends
and risk factors for HCC; the roles of screening/surveillance,
diagnostic, and treatment strategies; and the importance of
adopting a multidisciplinary approach to HCC management.
Epidemiology and Risk Factors of HCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third most common cause of
cancer death worldwide,1 accounting for  695,900 deaths
yearly.2 Although the highest incidence of HCC is in Southeast
and East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, current epidemiologic
trends show that the incidence of HCC in the United States is
rising.3 Age-adjusted incidence rates from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry show that the
incidence of HCC has tripled between 1975 and 20053; the
American Cancer Society estimated 28,720 new cases of HCC
and 20,550 HCC-related deaths in the United States in 2012.4
The incidence and associated mortality of HCC varies based on
ethnicity and age. Asians/Pacific Islanders show the highest
incidence followed by Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians/
Alaskan natives, and Whites. Among age groups, the highest
increase in rates of HCC are found in men aged 50 to 59 years
and 70 to 84 years.3
Understanding the etiology and risk factors for HCC is
important in appreciating global HCC trends and instituting
appropriate prevention or screening approaches. Hepatitis B
virus (HBV) is a well-known etiologic risk factor, and the high

Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related
death worldwide, and the incidence of HCC continues to rise. Improved understanding
of risk factors for HCC has allowed the development of more effective prevention and
surveillance strategies to reduce the global burden of this malignancy. Because of the
complex nature of HCC, arising in a background of chronic liver dysfunction and often
associated with viral infection, appropriate treatment requires a multidisciplinary
approach designed to control the cancer and treat the underlying liver disease.
Treatment approaches vary based on disease stage and severity, making accurate
diagnosis and staging of disease critical. This has been aided by the development of new
staging criteria, such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System. For earlierstage disease, resection, radiofrequency ablation, transplantation, and transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) are preferred treatment modalities that provide optimal
outcome. Until recently, few treatment options existed for patients with more advanced
disease. Improved understanding of the underlying biology of the disease and the
development of molecularly targeted therapies, including the multitargeted angiokinase inhibitor sorafenib, has improved outcomes in this patient population. Research
into therapeutic targets and novel agents continues for more advanced disease.

incidence of HCC in China and Africa reflects the elevated
prevalence of chronic HBV infection.2,5 However, HCC in the
United States, Western Europe, and Japan more commonly
arises in the context of liver injury due to chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV).3,6 Other important risk factors implicated in the
etiology of HCC include aflatoxin B1 exposure, alcoholic
cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). The risk of HCC was found to significantly increase
with an alcohol exposure of > 80 g ethanol per day compared
with no exposure, and was elevated 54-fold in the presence of
both viral infection and alcohol exposure.7,8 Patients with
diabetes had a significantly higher incidence rate (2.39 vs 0.87
per 10,000 person-years, respectively, p < 0.0001) compared
with patients without diabetes in a study of 824,263
patients.9 In a large prospective study, a high body mass
index (BMI) of 35.0–39.9 was associated with a 4.5-fold
increased risk of HCC.10 Moreover, synergistic interaction
among alcohol exposure, diabetes, and obesity might further
increase the risk of HCC.8 The relationship between tobacco
use and risk of HCC is presently unclear; however, a casecontrolled study demonstrated a fivefold increase in the risk
of HCC after an exposure of 20 pack-years.11
Given that chronic HBV and HCV infections are the major
risk factors for HCC, prevention of these infections would have
a huge impact on the worldwide incidence of HCC. Rigorous
HBV vaccination measures have been highly successful in
preventing both neonatally acquired HBV and adult HBV
infections and consequently, in reducing the risk of HCC.12
In addition to vaccinations, some evidence indicates that
antiviral therapies may play an important role in preventing
complications from chronic HBV infection and progression to
HCC. In a placebo-controlled study of 651 patients with
chronic HBV infection, antiviral therapy with lamivudine
reduced the incidence of HCC by 51% compared with placebo
(3.9% vs 7.4%; hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.49; p ¼ 0.047).13 In the
case of HCV, where no vaccine is available, preventative
strategies include disrupting transmission through good
clinical practices, reducing high-risk behaviors through public education, and managing chronic infections with combined antiviral therapy including novel agents such as
boceprevir or telapravir.14 Other, modifiable risk factors,
such as alcohol use, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, will likely
get more attention once preventative strategies against viral
hepatitis are well implemented.
Prior to discussing diagnostic and treatment approaches
for HCC, the implications of the heterogeneity of HCC and
underlying liver disease must be underscored. Although it is
known that up to 70% of HCC develops in the setting of chronic
liver disease,15,16 the molecular evolution of HCC is a complex, multistep process that is still not completely understood. However, two major mechanisms seem to be the most
important: the development of liver cirrhosis and the alteration of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to
aberrant cell signaling pathways. Targeting these signaling
pathways represents a rationale for modern systemic therapy
of HCC and is discussed later in this supplement.
Due to the complex nature of HCC and its association with
liver dysfunction, the management of this malignancy requires close collaboration among a multidisciplinary team of
hepatologists/gastroenterologists, pathologists, radiologists,
surgeons, and oncologists. Timely selection of a therapeutic
intervention and referral to the appropriate specialist within
the multidisciplinary team is critical to deliver optimal
patient care in this disease.
Surveillance and Diagnosis
Screening and surveillance are highly important for early
detection of HCC in patients considered to be at risk, such as
Asian HBV carriers, Blacks with hepatitis B, HBV carriers with
family history of HCC, patients with cirrhosis and chronic HBV
or HCV, genetic susceptibility (hemochromatosis, α 1-antitrypsin deficiency), or cirrhosis of other etiology.17
Hepatologists/gastroenterologists at the forefront of managing patients with chronic liver diseases play a critical role in
the implementation of surveillance programs. The combination of ultrasound and α-fetoprotein (AFP) evaluation has been
shown to reduce mortality by 37% in patients with HBV,18
supporting the need for HCC surveillance. However, in a pooled
analysis in patients with early HCC, ultrasound was shown to
have only 63% sensitivity.19 Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit
analyses have indicated that the surveillance strategy of ultrasound and AFP appears to be the best,20,21 and a recent
prospective study showed that ultrasound and AFP are complementary, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 83%.22
The practice guidelines of the American Association for Liver
Diseases (AASLD) recommend ultrasound alone at 6-month
intervals for HCC surveillance,17 but the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and other societies recommend
the combination of ultrasound and AFP.23 There is a need to
identify novel biomarkers, either alone or to complement
ultrasonography, to improve the performance characteristics
for the detection of early HCC.
When suspicious nodules are identified, the current diagnostic algorithm (►Fig. 1) proposed by the AASLD recommends that liver nodules < 1 cm be observed with
ultrasound every 3 months until stability or growth of the
lesion is established.17 For lesions > 1 cm, characteristic
intense arterial uptake followed by contrast washout in the
venous-delayed phases should be detected with 4-phase
multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) or dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With the improved accuracy and sensitivity of imaging
modalities, liver biopsy is currently not indicated for the
diagnosis of HCC in a cirrhotic liver, and is even considered
controversial. Although specificity of liver biopsy is almost
100%, sensitivity varies and depends on the tumor size and
location and the size of the needle used for biopsy. Additionally, there is a small risk (2.7%) of tumor seeding after liver
biopsy.24 According to the AASLD guidelines, biopsy is warranted only in instances where neither MDCT nor MRI shows
characteristics of HCC, and is most useful in hypovascular
tumors and in small nodules < 1 cm.17 Histologic confirmation of HCC requires positive results for at least two of the
following three immunostains: glypican 3, heat shock protein
70, and glutamine synthetase.25

Staging and Outcome of HCC
Prognosis and treatment options for HCC are dependent not
only on the tumor stage, but also on the magnitude of liver
impairment; therefore, conventional staging systems used in
the majority of other cancers, such as the tumor-nodemetastasis (TNM) staging system, are insufficient. Several
HCC staging systems incorporating liver function, such as the
Okuda classification,26 Cancer of the Liver Italian Program
(CLIP),27,28 Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI),29 and
Japanese Integrated System (JIS),30 have been developed;
however, they do not adequately stratify patients across the
continuum of HCC and fail to provide treatment guidance or
prognostic accuracy.31,32 In contrast, the Barcelona Clinic
Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System (►Fig. 2) stratifies patients based on tumor stage, performance status, cancerrelated symptoms, and liver function status as assessed by
the Child-Pugh score to provide specific treatment recommendations that can be correlated with life expectancy.33–36
The Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver
function (total bilirubin, serum albumin, ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, and prothrombin international normalized
ratio [PT INR]) to categorize patients into Child-Pugh class
A–C, which correlate with the severity of liver disease.36 The
BCLC Staging System is currently a preferred staging system
for HCC, and is endorsed by both the American and European
Medical Associations.17,37–39
According to BCLC staging, very early-stage HCC includes
patients with solitary, vaguely nodular tumors < 2 cm, preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A), and no vascular or
distant metastasis. Although these patients have the best
prognosis, very early-stage HCC is difficult to diagnose.
Early-stage disease includes patients with either solitary
tumors < 5 cm or up to three nodules < 3 cm in size, no
vascular invasion or extrahepatic dissemination (constituting
the Milan criteria for liver transplantation), and Child-Pugh A
or B liver function. Several curative treatment modalities are
applicable in this patient subset, yielding a 5-year survival of
50–75%. The intermediate stage includes patients with large
multinodular tumors beyond the Milan criteria, Child-Pugh A
or B liver disease, and no vascular tumor invasion or extrahepatic spread; these patients have an average predicted 3-year
survival of  29% with current therapies. Advanced stage
includes patients with Eastern Cooperative Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 1 or 2 with tumors that may be
accompanied by vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread;

1-year survival rate is  50%. End-stage disease includes
patients exhibiting cancer symptoms and decompensated
liver function (Child–Pugh C); the median survival of this
patient subset is < 3 months.33
Current Treatment Modalities for HCC
The treatment strategy for a patient with HCC is selected
based on cancer stage, patient performance status, and
underlying liver disease, and includes radical surgery (resection or transplantation), locoregional therapy (radiofrequency ablation [RFA], transarterial chemoembolization
[TACE], or embolization), systemic therapy (sorafenib), or a
combination of these strategies.
Early-Stage HCC
Treatment options for patients with early-stage HCC are largely
dictated by the severity of liver dysfunction, portal hypertension (defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10 mm
Hg), and presence of comorbidities. Surgical resection is the
standard of care for patients with very early-stage or earlystage HCC with well-preserved liver function (no cirrhosis or
Child-Pugh A), normal bilirubin (< 1 mg/dL), and no portal
hypertension.17 In patients with portal hypertension and
elevated bilirubin ( 1 mg/dL), a high risk of irreversible
postoperative clinical decompensation and a reduced survival
of 25% have been observed that preclude the use of surgical
resection in this subset of patients.40 Unfortunately, earlyphase and late-phase intrahepatic recurrences have been
reported after surgical resection, with 5-year recurrence rates
exceeding 70%.41–43 Although predictors of recurrence have
not been completely defined, there is some evidence to suggest
that microvascular invasion and serum AFP  32 ng/mL might
be strong predictive factors for postoperative early recurrence
(< 2 years), although grade of hepatitis activity, tumor nodule
multiplicity, and gross tumor classification may predict late
recurrence ( 2 years).42–46 Some evidence indicates that
adjuvant therapy with interferon may reduce the risk of
recurrence; however, further validation is required before its
role can be established in this setting.47,48 Salvage transplantation may be indicated for selected previously resected patients such as those with recurrences due to de novo
oncogenesis or those who show pathological evidence of
vascular invasion prior to proven recurrence.49,50
Liver transplantation offers the best survival benefit for
patients with early-stage disease by reducing the potential for
recurrence through the elimination of undetectable liver
lesions and underlying liver disease. The above-mentioned
Milan criteria are globally used to select patients for liver
transplantation; patients receiving a transplant according to
this criteria have a 4-year overall survival (OS) of 75% and only
an 8% risk of recurrence.51 To expand listing criteria for
patients with HCC, the University of San Francisco (UCSF)
developed modified criteria in which patients with a solitary
lesion of  6.5 cm in diameter or  3 lesions  4.5 cm with a
total combined diameter of  8 cm are eligible for transplant.52 However, the UCSF criteria have not been formally
adopted by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) due to
the scarcity of donor livers. The UNOS primarily uses the
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) criteria, a composite score of liver function parameters that assesses the risk of
life-threatening liver failure, to allocate available livers for
transplantation. Because MELD does not consider mortality
risk from HCC, additional points are given for presence of HCC
to prioritize for transplantation. The long waiting time
between listing and transplantation has also led to strategies
for increasing the donor pool, such as using living donors and
split liver transplantation.17,53 In addition, withdrawal from
the waiting list due to disease progression might be reduced
by use of a locoregional “bridge therapy,” such as TACE or
ablation.54–57 There is evidence that response to preoperative
TACE to “downstage” HCC led to better long-term survival
following transplantation, particularly in patients that fit the
Milan criteria.58,59 Importantly, the number of donors available for liver transplant has plateaued over the past 10 years
to  1500/year for patients with HCC,60 while the number of
patients with HCC has grown significantly to over 28,000.4
Therefore, liver transplantation as a treatment for HCC is
limited in its scope.
For patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection or
liver transplantation, locoregional therapy using imageguided percutaneous tumor ablation methods is the treatment of choice. RFA has demonstrated a superior survival
benefit compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in
patients with early-stage HCC, particularly those with compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh A).61 Radiofrequency
ablation was associated with a 5-year OS of 76% when
used as frontline therapy in patients with resectable HCC
by BCLC criteria, which is comparable to the survival rates
achieved historically with surgical resection.62,63 Two prospective randomized trials demonstrated that RFA was as
effective as surgical resection in terms of OS or recurrencefree survival while being less invasive and having fewer
complications.64,65 These results question the use of surgical resection as standard first-line therapy in all patients
with very early-stage HCC, and support consideration of RFA
in this setting. However, RFA has several limitations and
showed suboptimal results in patients with tumor
size > 3 cm and perivascularly located tumors.66 To overcome these limitations, numerous refinements of ablation
methods are under clinical testing, including laser ablation,
microwave ablation, cryoablation light-activated therapy,
and irreversible electroporation.
Intermediate-Stage HCC
Patients with large multimodal tumors, preserved liver function, and no vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread who are
ineligible for radical surgical therapies or percutaneous ablation are usually treated with TACE.17 Transarterial chemoembolization involves the intra-arterial injection of a
cytotoxic agent (doxorubicin, cisplatin, or mitomycin), with
or without lipiodol, plus an embolic agent into the hepatic
artery that supplies the tumor. In a meta-analysis of seven
studies, TACE demonstrated a significant improvement in
2-year survival (odds ratio ¼ 0.53; p ¼ 0.017) compared with
best supportive care.67 However, patient selection appears to
Seminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013
S6 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero

be critical for achieving a survival advantage with this method. In the positive Barcelona study, a 2-year OS of 63% and
objective responses of 35% were reported for patients treated
with TACE, but 70% of them had compensated liver disease
(Child-Pugh A) with no vascular invasion or extrahepatic
spread.68 Another study found that among patients treated
with TACE, those with unilobular portal vein invasion and
tumors > 5 cm did not show a survival benefit.69 In both of
these studies, the long-term outcomes were unsatisfactory
with a 3-year OS of only  30%, highlighting the need for
improved strategies to optimize outcomes.
To further improve outcomes and tolerability of TACE, a
new drug delivery system has been developed using doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEB), which provides embolization and
releases the cytotoxic agent in a controlled fashion
(DEB-TACE).70 Encouraging tolerability and response rates
of 70–85% have been reported with this technique.71–74
However, in the recently reported, prospective, randomized
phase II PRECISION V trial of 212 patients with intermediatestage HCC, though DEB-TACE substantially reduced hepatic
and doxorubicin-related systemic side effects compared with
those found with conventional TACE, clear superiority in
response rates was not demonstrated (52% vs 44%;
p ¼ 0.11).75 Clearly, further studies are warranted to define
the role of DEB-TACE in HCC. In addition to TACE, radioembolization with yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres represents
a potential new treatment option for patients with ChildPugh A cirrhosis and intermediate-stage HCC, but needs to be
explored in randomized trials.76
Unresectable/Advanced-Stage HCC
Treatment options are limited for patients with unresectable
advanced stage HCC or those for whom therapy with TACE has
failed. Systemic chemotherapy, either single agent or in
combination, demonstrated only minor antitumor activity
(response rate < 30%) and failed to show an unequivocal
improvement in OS.77–79 However, recent evidence that
chemotherapy might have a role in HCC has emerged from
an Asian phase III study where the FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin/5-
fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy regimen improved
response rate, time to progression (TTP), and OS in patients
with advanced stage HCC when compared with doxorubicin,
but these results require further validation.80
Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of
HCC has led to recognition of the importance of angiogenesis
for tumor development, growth, and progression, thus making angiogenesis an attractive target. Proangiogenic factors,
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet
derived growth factor (PDGF) and their receptors, have been
shown to have important roles in facilitating HCC angiogenesis. Sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
blocks several key modulators of angiogenesis, including
VEGFR2, PDGFR, Raf-1 and B-Raf receptors, is the first drug
to show a survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC and
represents a paradigm shift in the systemic treatment of this
disease. Its efficacy was proven in two large, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trials, which mainly included
patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver disease.81,82 In the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized
Protocol (SHARP) study of 602 patients, most of whom
were Caucasian, treatment with 400 mg sorafenib twice daily
significantly prolonged TTP (5.5 months vs 2.8 months;
HR ¼ 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.74;
p < 0.001) and median OS (10.7 months vs 7.9 months,
HR ¼ 0.69; 95% CI 0.55–0.87; p < 0.001). In a similarly designed Asia-Pacific study of 271 Asian patients, sorafenib
therapy prolonged TTP (2.8 months vs 1.4 months; HR
¼ 0.57; 95% CI 0.42–0.72; p ¼ 0.0005) and median OS (6.5
months vs 4.2 months; HR ¼ 0.68; 95% CI 0.50–0.93;
p ¼ 0.014) compared with placebo. The inferior magnitude
of benefit of the Asia-Pacific study compared with the SHARP
study may be partly attributable to differences in patient
characteristics, disease heterogeneity, and etiopathology
between the trials. Seventy-five percent of patients in the
Asia-Pacific study exhibited hepatitis B etiology, compared
with only 19% in the SHARP study. In addition, patients
enrolled in the Asia-Pacific study had a worse performance
status and more advanced stage disease in general than those
in the SHARP study. In both trials, hand-and-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, rash, and fatigue were among the most commonly reported adverse effects.
In both of these studies of sorafenib in the treatment of HCC,
the improvements in OS and TTP were not accompanied by
benefit in terms of objective response, highlighting the lack of
utility of conventional RECIST criteria for evaluation of tumor
response to molecular targeted therapy. Recently developed
modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria propose the assessment of
response to molecular targeted therapy (or locoregional therapy) in patients with HCC based on measurement of viable
tumor with arterial enhancement on a computed tomography
scan, not anatomical tumor response.83 Although the mRECIST
is utilized in the assessment of response in systemic therapies,
it needs further validation. When response to sorafenib was
assessed according to both mRECIST and conventional RECIST
criteria in patients with advanced HCC, a higher rate of objective responses was identified with mRECIST (23% vs 2%), and
patients who achieved a response according to mRECIST had a
longer OS than nonresponding patients (18 months vs
8 months, p ¼ 0.013).84
Although it is indisputable that sorafenib represents a
major advancement in the management of unresectable
advanced-stage HCC, several unanswered questions and unmet needs still remain. The clinical benefit with sorafenib
appears to be modest and short-lived, even in patients with
preserved liver function. In addition, there is currently no
reliable predictive biomarker for monitoring response or
indicating treatment resistance. The registrational trials
also did not provide data on the safety and efficacy of
sorafenib in patients with compromised liver function. However, the postapproval observational GIDEON study (Global
Investigation of Therapeutic Decisions in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and of Its Treatment with Sorafenib) showed that
sorafenib 400 mg twice daily could be safely prescribed to
selected Child-Pugh B patients.85 Sorafenib is also being
examined in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in combination with locoregional therapies.

Conclusion
Recent years have witnessed significant changes in the management of HCC. Multidisciplinary approaches to management of this disease and diagnostic and treatment algorithms
that accommodate the unique aspects of HCC, including its
pathobiology, heterogeneity, and underlying liver impairment, have been developed. The introduction of sorafenib
therapy has validated the targeted approach to this disease
and represents a major paradigm shift in the treatment of
advanced HCC, leading to the identification of other potential
targets and the development of new targeted agents in HCC,
which are discussed in the next article.
