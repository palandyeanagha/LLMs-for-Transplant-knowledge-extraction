Abstract
Introduction Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a leading cause 
of acute viral hepatitis in the developing world and is 
a public health problem, in particular among pregnant 
women, where it may lead to severe or fatal complications. 
A recombinant HEV vaccine, 239 (Hecolin; Xiamen 
Innovax Biotech, Xiamen, China), is licensed in China, but 
WHO calls for further studies to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of this vaccine in vulnerable populations, 
and to evaluate protection in pregnancy. We are therefore 
conducting a phase IV trial to assess the effectiveness, 
safety and immunogenicity of the HEV 239 vaccine when 
given in women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh, 
where HEV infection is endemic.
Methods and analysis Enrolment of a target of 
approximately 20 000 non-pregnant women, aged 16–39 
years, started on 2 October 2017 in Matlab, Bangladesh. 
Sixty-seven villages were randomised by village at a 
1:1 ratio to receive either the HEV vaccine or the control 
vaccine (hepatitis B vaccine). A 3-dose vaccination series 
at 0, 1 and 6 months is ongoing, and women are followed 
up for 24 months. The primary outcome is confirmed 
HEV disease among pregnant women. After vaccination, 
participants are requested to report information about 
clinical hepatitis symptoms. Participants who become 
pregnant are visited at their homes every 2 weeks to 
collect information about pregnancy outcome and to 
screen for clinical hepatitis. All suspected hepatitis cases 
undergo laboratory testing for diagnostic evaluation. The 
incidence of confirmed HEV disease among pregnant and 
non-pregnant women will be compared between the HEV 
vaccinated and control groups, safety and immunogenicity 
of the vaccine will also be evaluated.
Ethics and dissemination The protocol was reviewed 
and approved by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal 
Disease Research, Bangladesh Research Review 
Committee and Ethical Review Committee, and the 
Directorate General of Drug Administration in Bangladesh, 
and by the Regional Ethics Committee in Norway. This 
article is based on the protocol version 2.2 dated 29 June 
2017. We will present the results through peer-reviewed 
publications and at international conferences.
Trial registration number The trial is registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov with the registry name “Effectiveness Trial 
to Evaluate Protection of Pregnant Women by Hepatitis E 
Vaccine in Bangladesh” and the identifier NCT02759991.
Introduction
Background and rationale
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric RNA 
virus causing outbreaks or endemics in 
Strengths and limitations of the study
► This trial is conducted in a defined population covered by a long-term demographic surveillance registry, in a site that has a well-established clinical 
and laboratory infrastructure and effective referral 
systems.
► Women are visited in their homes for 7 days following vaccination to follow-up and record details of 
any adverse events.
► Active surveillance of acute hepatitis is conducted 
through home visits every 2 weeks to all the pregnant participants during their pregnancy.
► Dried blood spots are used to assess immunogenicity of the vaccine, simplifying blood collection and 
making storage of 40 000 samples feasible in a 
community setting.
► A limitation of this trial design is the lack of blood 
sampling at the end of follow-up; thus, we will not 
be able to explore the occurrence of asymptomatic 
hepatitis E.

developing countries with poor sanitation and is one of 
the leading causes of acute hepatitis worldwide.1 Pregnant 
women are particularly vulnerable to HEV infection, with 
a high rate of maternal mortality, miscarriage, premature 
delivery and stillbirth.2
An effective vaccine could prevent symptomatic HEV 
infection in vulnerable people. Only two HEV vaccines 
have been evaluated in human clinical trials, namely 
rHEV (GlaxoSmithKline), and HEV 239 (Hecolin, 
Xiamen Innovax Biotech, China), of which only the 
latter has undergone further commercial development.3
Zhu et al studied this vaccine in a large phase III clinical 
study in China, where 100000 healthy men and women 
(aged 16–65 years) received either the HEV vaccine or 
a hepatitis B vaccine (HBV).4 They found more than 
90% protection against symptomatic HEV infection. The 
adverse events related to the vaccine were few and mild, 
and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events 
(SAEs). The vaccine is currently only licensed in China 
for people 16 years and older, and is recommended for 
individuals with a high risk of HEV infection.
WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts made a 
working group to review the evidence on the HEV 239 
vaccine and make recommendations for its use. They 
concluded that knowledge gaps prevents recommendation of the vaccine in endemic countries, and that further 
studies should evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
this vaccine in children, the elderly, persons with underlying diseases or conditions such as immunosuppression 
or liver disease, and immunogenicity and protection in 
pregnant women.3 5
HEV comprises eight genotypes, of which mainly four 
infect humans.6 HEV genotypes 1 and 2 dominate human 
infections in developing countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 
primarily infect animals that can further transmit the 
virus to humans, causing illness in both developed and 
developing countries. Genotype 4 predominates in mainland China, where the previous phase III vaccine trial was 
conducted, but there are limited data on protection of 
the vaccine against the other genotypes. A small study 
investigated immunogenicity against genotypes 1–4 after 
vaccination with p239 and found that in humans, IgG 
antibodies reacted slightly stronger against genotypes 1 
and 2 versus 3 and 4, which could be due to the presence 
of genotype-specific neutralising antibodies.7
 However, 
the vaccine still needs to be tested in other geographical 
areas to fully evaluate efficacy against all the genotypes 
that frequently cause illness in humans.3
We are currently conducting a phase IV clusterrandomised clinical trial (2017–ongoing) with the HEV 
239 vaccine to provide more data on the effectiveness 
of the vaccine on genotype 1 and the outcome in pregnant women, and on safety of the vaccine. The trial is 
conducted in a rural area of Bangladesh where genotype 
1 is predominant, and includes women aged 16–39 years, 
allowing us to evaluate effectiveness and immunogenicity 
of the vaccine among women who become pregnant 
following vaccination.
Objectives
Primary objective
– To determine the effectiveness of the HEV 239 vaccine 
given to women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh in preventing HEV disease during pregnancy.
Secondary objectives
– To determine the safety of HEV vaccine in Bangladeshi 
women of childbearing age.
– To determine the immunogenicity of HEV vaccine in 
Bangladeshi women of childbearing age.
– To determine the effectiveness of HEV vaccine in 
preventing HEV disease in non-pregnant Bangladeshi 
women of childbearing age.
– To assess the anti-HEV IgG levels before and 1month 
after the last dose of vaccine for primary vaccine 
response and record if any HEV disease occurs.
– To assess the feasibility, acceptability and cost effectiveness of HEV vaccination of women of childbearing age 
in rural Bangladesh.
– To investigate acute HEV cases virologically, clinically 
and immunologically in relation to outcome.
Trial design
This study is a phase IV cluster-randomised, doubleblinded trial on the safety and effectiveness of three doses 
of the HEV 239 vaccine in women of childbearing age 
(16-39 years) in Bangladesh. In this phase IV study, we 
will assess the safety, acceptability, immunogenicity and 
effectiveness of Hepatitis E vaccine. It is not required 
to conduct a phase III study in Bangladesh when it has 
already been conducted elsewhere and the results are 
published, which showed that the vaccine is safe and 
highly efficacious. In a cluster randomised trial, groups of 
people rather than individuals are randomly allocated to 
the interventions under investigations. The unit of allocation in this trail is a ‘Village’. Participants are sampled at 
day 0 and day 210 and followed up as described in table 1.
Methods and analysis
Study setting
The study field site for this clinical trial is located in 
Matlab in rural Bangladesh, where HEV is endemic.8
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, 
Bangladesh (icddr,b) has maintained a field research site 
in this area for more than 50 years with an ongoing health 
and demographic surveillance system covering the entire 
population. The icddr,b field site comprises 67 villages, 
with a total population of about 116000 and a wellestablished infrastructure including healthcare services 
(hospital and local health clinics), laboratory facilities 
and effective referral systems.
Randomisation and blinding
All 67 villages were randomised by village at a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either HEV vaccine or HBV vaccine. All participants, investigators and field staff are blinded. The

vaccine administrators, however, cannot be blinded since 
the dose of the licensed HBV vaccine in Bangladesh is 
different for women below and above 18 years, while the 
HEV vaccine dose is identical for all age groups. Each 
village is allocated to two vaccine codes (one for 16–18 
years and another for 19–39 years) with eight codes in 
total; two codes for each vaccine in each age group. To 
achieve similar distributions of the codes for the two 
vaccines in different age groups, computerised allocation 
was employed taking the population size of the villages 
into consideration. The randomisation was rerun until 
the groups were balanced in size (<200 in difference). An 
independent statistician from Johns Hopkins University 
performed the randomisation. The vials were labelled 
with the eight respective codes by Incepta Pharmaceuticals, Bangladesh, who fill finished and bottled the vaccine 
shipped in bulk from China.
The treatment allocation code is being securely kept 
under lock and key and may be broken by the investigator 
only in case of SAEs for which knowledge of the participant’s treatment assignment may influence her or the 
clinical care or if the event is unexpected and suspected 
to be causally related to the investigational product. Code 
breaking will be reported to the clinical monitor and Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) within 24hours. 
The participant may continue in the study with protocolspecified follow-up despite unblinding, unless she fulfils 
any protocol-defined exclusion criteria.
Recruitment and enrolment
All eligible women in the study area, identified through 
existing Matlab surveillance system, are being approached 
at their homes by designated study staff who inform about 
the nature of the study according to the International

Figure 1 Anticipated participants enrolment flow chart.
Practice in their local language, and the participants may 
inquire about the details of the study. Eligibility is further 
assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
in box 1.
A urinary pregnancy test is offered to women who have 
missed a period. Eligible participants visit a fixed site clinic 
for enrolment, where they sign a consent form. In the 
case of 16–17year-old participants, their legal guardians 
sign an assent form in place of the consent form. A case 
report form (CRF) with an identification number is then 
created for each participant. Confidentiality of personal 
identifiers is maintained by keeping names noted in 
primary data instruments in secure files and by removing 
names from the computerised dataset for analysis. A flow 
chart of anticipated participant recruitment is shown in 
figure 1.
Withdrawal
The participants and/or their legal guardians are 
informed that participation is voluntary, and that they 
may withdraw consent at any time, without giving a reason 
and without prejudice to further treatment. Participants 
who withdraw may demand destruction of samples and 
deletion of data concerning themselves. Participants may 
be discontinued from the study by the investigator at any 
time in case of safety reasons or significant protocol deviations. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the 
CRF. If withdrawal is due to an adverse event, appropriate 
follow-up will be arranged.
Interventions
The HEV 239 vaccine is based on a 239 amino acid long 
recombinant HEV peptide, corresponding to amino 
acids 368–606 of open reading frame 2 that encodes 
the capsid protein of HEV. The amino acid sequence is 
derived from a genotype 1 Chinese HEV strain. HEV 239 
was developed and is produced by Innovax. The vaccine 
is expressed in Escherichia coli,
9
 and contains 30µg of
the purified protein absorbed to 0.8mg of aluminium
hydroxide suspended in 0.5mL of buffered saline. The
control vaccine is a commercial HBV (Hepa-B) produced
by Incepta. Each 0.5mL dose (for age 16–18 years)
contains 10µg of hepatitis B surface antigen absorbed on 
aluminium hydroxide gel equivalent to Al3+ 0.25 mg. A 
1.0mL dose for older persons contains 20µg of hepatitis
B surface antigen absorbed on aluminium hydroxide gel 
equivalent to Al3+ 0.5 mg. We chose this control vaccine 
for the following reasons: it will benefit the target population who have not received this vaccine through the 
child immunisation programme; the dosing regimen 
is the same as the HEV vaccine; and it was the control 
vaccine in the phase III trial,4
 facilitating comparison 
with previous results.
Innovax donated bulk HEV vaccine for the trial, 
while Incepta filled the HBV and HEV vaccines in identical, single dose vials, respectively. Both bulk vaccines 
and finished products were quality tested and labelled 
according to ICH-Good Manufacturing Practice.
Innovax donated bulk vaccine to Incepta, Bangladesh maintaining cold chain through courier. Incepta 
prepared the HEV single-dose vaccine vials. We maintained proper cold chain from Incepta to field sites.
The vaccines are administered intramuscularly in the 
deltoid muscle of either arm, in a 3-dose regimen on day 
0, at 1month and at 6months (table 1).

Follow-up/surveillance
The full study period will last for 2½ years after enrolment 
of the final participant (Table 1).
Hepatitis surveillance
Participant get an immunisation card with identification 
numbers and a phone number, and are instructed to 
contact the investigator immediately if they experience 
jaundice or have any of the following symptoms for at 
least 3days: fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, nausea 
or vomiting. This passive surveillance for hepatitis is 
ongoing throughout the full study period for all participants. After each dose of vaccine, field staff visited participant’s household daily for 7 days. Then, all participants 
are visited by field staff for hepatitis surveillance weekly 
and will be continued till the end of the study. All women 
who became pregnant after any dose are visited every 2 
weeks to collect information about pregnancy outcomes 
and to screen for clinical hepatitis. In addition, message 
on hepatitis symptoms is also being sent on mobile 
phones to all participants (>80% of households have cell 
phone access). Suspected cases will be referred to Matlab 
hospital for clinical and laboratory examination including 
tests of liver function and virological causes of hepatitis 
(A, B, C, E), and eventual treatment. If HEV disease is 
confirmed by the presence of anti-HEV IgM or HEV RNA, 
blood samples will be analysed for relevant biochemical, microbiological and immunological markers. This 
includes viral load, HEV subtypes, other hepatitis infections, antibody titer, cellular immune response, cytokines, 
alanine transaminase (ALT), International normalized 
ratio (INR) and albumin. Blood samples will be taken at 
least two times a week until recovery in order to assess 
the dynamic in viral and host factors during the illness. 
The patient’s symptoms and signs will also be recorded 
regularly in this period. The last study visit to pregnant 
women is 14 days after delivery, to record information on 
the health status of the child.
Adverse events surveillance
After each vaccination dose, participants are observed 
for 30min and visited at their homes by a field worker 
for seven consecutive days. During these visits, participants are specifically asked about any local reactions 
(eg, erythema, swelling, induration and pain at the injection site) and systemic symptoms (eg, nausea, malaise, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache and fever). Participants are 
also asked to report any significant symptoms after the 
last vaccine dose, that is, at least 2 years until the last study 
visit. After this visit, they are advised to report to the study 
team about any possible SAEs or signs of hepatitis, even 
after completion of the study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome is clinical HEV disease among 
pregnant women. HEV disease is defined by illness lasting 
for at least 3 days, abnormal serum ALT level of ≥2.5 
times upper limit of normal, detection of IgM anti-HEV 
in serum collected within 1month after onset, and/or 
the presence of HEV RNA and/or ≥4-fold rise of IgG 
anti-HEV levels in paired sera. All acute hepatitis cases 
are also tested for the presence of markers of other viral 
hepatitis (A, B, C). Secondary outcomes are confirmed 
HEV disease in non-pregnant women, safety and immunogenicity. Safety outcomes include all local and systemic 
adverse events, which are recorded in the participant case 
report form during the study period. Investigation of 
vaccine-induced immune responses will include anti-HEV 
IgG on all participants, together with additional antibody 
and cellular responses in plasma and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples taken from a subset of 
50 participants. A possible protective anti-HEV IgG level 
will be sought. An antibody response to vaccination will 
be defined as a ≥4-fold rise of IgG anti-HEV levels in an 
individual’s post vaccination sample (1month after the 
last dose) compared with baseline sample.4 Data on pregnancy outcome, including complications during delivery 
and health status of mother and child, will be collected 
on all participants on a pregnancy report form and analysed together with records of eventual HEV disease and 
type, time and number of vaccine doses.
Sample size and power calculations
The sample size was calculated to estimate total vaccine 
protection of pregnant participants in a per protocol (PP) 
analysis (figure 1). The following assumptions are based 
on data from Matlab health and demographic surveillance system and previous HEV research studies from the 
region.8
 We expect that 10% of women will not be included 
because of baseline pregnancy, and that the refusal rate 
will be 5%. After randomisation, there will be 15% loss 
of person time because of migration out of the study site, 
and 10% will not complete three vaccine doses for other 
reasons. During follow-up after the last vaccine dose, we 
assume that 16% of women (followed over a mean of 16 
months) will become pregnant and reach term before the 
end of surveillance; an additional 9% of women (followed 
over a mean of 9 months) will be followed for an average 
of half full term (4.5 months). This predicts that 20% of 
the dose 3 recipients will have ‘completed’ pregnancies, 
3806 are expected to become pregnant after dose 3 and 
3073 to be followed to term. Follow-up of the remaining 
pregnancies will be right censored by termination of 
follow-up. We expect 15% of the pregnant dose 3 recipients to be lost to follow-up because of migration out, while 
5% are expected to withdraw from the study. We expect 
the design effect for this cluster randomised trial to be 2. 
We assume that 22% of the participants are HEV seropositive at baseline, indicating protection against HEV infection.8
 Furthermore, 6% of seronegative pregnant women 
are expected to become infected during pregnancy,8 of 
which we assume 35% to be symptomatic.8 The protective efficacy of a 3-dose regimen of HEV vaccine against 
symptomatic infections is >95%.4We therefore need a 
sample size of 20745 women at baseline to achieve 80%

power at p<0.05 (two tailed) for the analyses in pregnant 
women. Further, our study will have 90% power to show 
>95% protective efficacy against HEV disease among nonpregnant women. Our study is not powered to directly 
evaluate perinatal and maternal death, because of the 
low rates of these outcomes in Matlab. However, given 
the substantial evidence linking maternal and perinatal 
mortality to HEV disease in pregnancy,2 demonstration 
of vaccine protection against confirmed HEV disease in 
pregnancy will provide strong evidence that vaccination is 
likely to prevent maternal and perinatal deaths.
Data collection, management and analysis
The field staff are entering the required data into the 
paper-based CRFs through interviewing during vaccination and home visits, and by reviewing medical records 
when applicable. The data are further transcribed to an 
electronic data capturing system (developed by icddr,b 
using Oracle data base) within a week of the clinic visit. 
This system will automatically check data to detect errors 
and inconsistencies. The data in the system are reviewed 
weekly by the analyst programmer, and any data deleted 
from the main database will be saved in a shadow table. 
Data are stored in the Oracle database system in a central 
server at Matlab. An electronic database backup is made 
weekly by the data management team, and the final database is sent to the icddr,b data archive system.
Health registry data for study participants and their 
previous pregnancy outcome are also being collected. 
Field staff and medical officers are checking these data 
with the family record book. They are checking the 
participant data with the eligible participant list after 
every visit. The data analyst manager is verifying entered 
data biweekly. Any inconsistencies are resolved with the 
field staff and medical officers.
All completed CRFs and other documents are stored 
in a locked cabinet with limited personnel access. The 
CRF register in the data management centre at Matlab 
keeps track of CRF movement between the file cabinet 
and the data management centre. The log book contains 
the columns; participant ID, receipt date, visit number, 
number of pages, name of staff, purpose of file movement, 
return date, name of staff and any relevant remarks. All 
informed consent forms are being filed and kept separately in a locked cabinet. Data are entered in electronic 
data base. A dedicated data management team will be 
responsible for data entry, cleaning, analysis and data 
archiving in deidentified way.
Blood samples are being analysed by icddr,b and/or 
Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), according 
to predefined standard operating procedures. Additional 
blood will be stored in the research biobank at icddr,b in 
case reanalysis is needed.
Statistical methods
Analyses
In the primary analysis, the risk of confirmed HEV disease 
in pregnant women who received the HEV vaccine will 
be compared with the risk in women who received the 
HBV vaccine using Cox regression with shared frailty,10
to adjust for the design effect of cluster randomisation. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be 
compared between the HEV and HBV vaccination clusters, for all participants, and separately for pregnant 
participants, to assess the degree to which randomisation 
was achieved. Unbalanced covariates (eg, occupation, 
age, body mass index (BMI), hepatitis B disease, socioeconomic information, education, sanitation and water use, 
distance from river, season, baseline HEV IgG antibodies) 
may be included in the models. Subgroup analyses will be 
performed to evaluate effectiveness in participants who 
are negative/positive at baseline for anti-HEV IgG antibodies, respectively, and subgroup analyses for effectiveness will also be performed per number of doses received. 
Additionally, subgroup analyses will be carried out to 
explore effectiveness in participants within different BMI 
and age intervals. Safety analyses of all local and SAEs (eg, 
pain, swelling, redness, fever, myalgia and headache) will 
be performed using generalised estimating equations for 
logistic regression to account for cluster randomisation
Analysis sets
The full analysis set (FAS) population will include all 
randomised participants who received at least one dose 
of either the study or the control vaccine. The PP population will include participants who were randomised 
and received three doses of the study or control vaccine, 
respectively, and provided blood samples according to 
the protocol schedule (table 1). Pregnant FAS and PP 
populations are defined as participants from the respective populations with confirmed pregnancies during the 
study period. The primary effectiveness analysis will be 
performed on the pregnant PP population. Secondary 
effectiveness analyses will be performed on the pregnant 
FAS population, as well as the non-pregnant FAS and 
PP populations, with the same methods as the primary 
analysis. Safety analyses will be performed on the FAS 
population.
Data and safety monitoring
Data monitoring
An independent DSMB with no competing interests 
was appointed to provide the icddr,b Ethical Review 
Committee (ERC) with an overall scientific, safety and 
ethical appraisal of the study. The DSMB also informs this 
committee regarding the progression of the study, with 
special attention to the safety of the participants. They 
convene at least once annually, and make recommendations directly to the ERC Chairperson. As described in 
the ERC guidelines, the principal investigator prepares 
a report to the DSMB before each meeting, describing 
the accumulated adverse events and SAEs and a summary 
of the current data for inclusion, progress and deviations from the protocol or planned procedures. Any 
reports from the monitor regarding quality control are 
also included. The DSMB is also responsible for detailed

reviews of all the SAEs. More details can be found in the 
DSMB Charter included in the Trial Master file in the 
trial office in Bangladesh.
No interim analyses have been planned, and no stopping guidelines have been created for the trial. In the 
event of serious safety issues, the DSMB will meet to 
provide recommendations regarding termination of the 
trial. The steering committee will have the final decision 
to terminate the study.
Harms
All adverse events observed or reported are logged in the 
relevant participant CRF by the study staff. The following 
information is registered: description of the adverse 
event (in precise standard medical terminology), time of 
onset and resolution, severity (mild/moderate/severe; 
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.0), outcome, assessment of the causality 
with study drug and action taken with study drug.
All SAEs are communicated to the DSMB within 
24hours after awareness by the study staff. SAE reports 
are initially sent to the Chairperson of the DSMB and 
the ERC with copy to sponsor/principal investigator. All 
adverse events and SAEs are being followed up to resolution unless the event is considered by the investigator 
to be unlikely to resolve due to underlying disease. We 
will endeavour that all events are resolved, even if they 
continue after study completion.
Auditing
The sponsor (NIPH) has appointed an independent local 
clinical monitor to ensure that the study is conducted 
according to protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP and regulatory requirements, and to verify that 
investigators are collecting and reporting quality data. In 
addition, a monitor from NIPH is auditing the study. The 
monitors are periodically monitoring on site, including at 
study initiation and at closeout. The monitors check the 
informed consent process, reporting of adverse events 
and other safety data, CRF completeness and adherence 
to the study protocol for at least 10% of the study participants randomly distributed between the 67 study villages. 
They also monitor maintenance of regulatory documents, 
study supply accountability, facilities and equipment.
Patient and public involvement statement
The public was not involved in the development of the 
research question nor the study design.
Ethics and dissemination
The protocol has been approved by the icddr,b ERC and 
Regional Ethics Committee in Norway.
Protocol amendments
Any significant amendments and/or new versions of the 
study protocol will be notified to and approved by the 
competent authority and the ethics committees in both 
countries according to EU and national regulations 
before changes are implemented.
Confidentiality
All study-related information is being kept confidential, 
under lock and key, or on secure servers in case of digital 
information. The study monitor, the ERC and any lawenforcing agency will have access to this information only 
in the event of necessary inspection. The samples may 
be sent outside the country for analysis, and preserved 
for 5 years where applicable; however, any personal identifiable information will be held and processed under 
secured conditions with access limited to preidentified 
staff. Remaining blood samples will be disposed of after 
completing testing for all participants in the study.
Access to data
The study principal investigator, the coinvestigators in the 
study and the data analyst manager will have access to the 
final trial dataset.
Dissemination policy
On study completion and finalisation of the study report, 
we will submit the study results to the competent authority 
and ethics committees according to national regulations, 
and publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. We 
will report the trial in accordance with the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, with authorship 
based on the ICMJE recommendations.
