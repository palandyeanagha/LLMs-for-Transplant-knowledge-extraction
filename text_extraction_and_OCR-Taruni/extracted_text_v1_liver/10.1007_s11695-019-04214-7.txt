Abstract
Introduction Ten percent of cirrhotic patients are known to have a high risk of postoperative complications. Ninety percent
of bariatric patients suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and 50% of them may develop non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) which can progress to cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of
cirrhosis at the time of bariatric surgery is associated with an increased rate and severity of short- and long-term cirrhotic
complications.
Methods A cohort of 110 bariatric patients, between May 2003 and February 2018, who had undergone liver biopsy at the time
of bariatric surgery were reassessed for histological outcome and divided into two groups based on the presence (C, n = 26) or
absence (NC, n = 84) of cirrhosis. The NC group consisted of NASH (n = 49), NAFLD (n = 24) and non-NAFLD (n = 11) liver
histology. Medical notes were retrospectively assessed for patient characteristics, development of 30-day postoperative complications, severity of complications (Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification) and length of stay. The C group was further assessed for
long-term cirrhosis-related outcomes.
Results The C group was older (52 years vs 43 years) and had lower BMI (46 kg/m2 vs 52 kg/m2
) and weight (126 kg vs 145 kg)
compared to the NC group (p < 0.05). The C group had significantly higher overall complication rate (10/26 vs 14/84, p < 0.05)
and severity of complications (CD class ≥ III, 12% vs 7%, p < 0.05) when compared to the NC group. The length of stay was
similar between the two groups (5 days vs 4 days). The C group had significant improvement in model end-stage liver disease
scores (7 vs 6, p < 0.01) with median follow-up of 4.5 years (range 2–11 years). There were no long-term cirrhosis-related
complications or mortality in our studied cohort (0/26).
Conclusion Bariatric surgery in cirrhotic patients has a higher risk of immediate postoperative complications. Long-term cirrhosis-related complications or mortality was not increased in this small cohort. Preoperative identification of liver cirrhosis may be
useful for risk stratification, optimisation and informed consent. Bariatric surgery in well-compensated cirrhotic patients may be
used as an aid to improve long-term outcome.

Introduction
Mild to moderate liver steatosis shows a predilection for
centrilobular distribution, progressing to diffuse fatty accumulation eventually resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) or fibrosis [1]. The presence of hepatic steatosis
makes liver susceptible to cytokine-mediated injury resulting
in steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis [2–7]. Fibrosis or cirrhosis
represents the final common end point of almost all chronic
liver diseases including NASH.
In obesity, an enhanced rate of lipolysis leads to increased
availability of free fatty acids responsible for an exaggerated
synthesis and deposition of triglycerides in hepatocytes [8, 9].
Ninety percent of patients with morbid obesity suffer from
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), eventually
resulting in NASH in 50% of patients undergoing bariatric
surgery [1, 10, 11].
Cirrhotic patients are known to have increased perioperative risk for both abdominal and non-abdominal surgery [12].
They have an increased risk of mortality from liver and renal
failure, and impaired coagulation may result in the sequelae of
postoperative bleeding [10]. Once cirrhosis is established, patients can progress from an asymptomatic compensated stage
to a symptomatic decompensated stage. The latter maybe
marked by the development of clinical complications of portal
hypertension and liver failure. Although the risk of mortality
after bariatric surgery is 0.9% in the compensated stage, it
increases up to 16% upon decompensation as compared to
only 0.3% in non-cirrhotic patients [13].
The aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of
cirrhosis at the time of bariatric surgery leads to an increased rate,
severity of short-term complications and length of stay compared
to non-cirrhotic patients. We also studied the effect of bariatric
surgery on long-term cirrhosis-related complications.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Between May 2003 and February 2018, a cohort of 1676
morbidly obese patients underwent bariatric surgery under a
single surgeon. At the time of surgery, all patients who had
incidental macroscopic appearance of liver cirrhosis
underwent a liver biopsy (n = 26). The incidence of unexpected cirrhosis in this cohort was 1.5% (26/1676). Non-cirrhotic
liver biopsies were taken on random patients from this cohort
of 1676 patients as part of other studies (n = 90). Patients who
underwent intraoperative liver biopsies were assessed for suitability. Of a total of 116 patients, 110 patients were included in
the study. Patients who had other known aetiological factors
for liver disease such as alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune
or viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease and primary
biliary cirrhosis were excluded from the study. A retrospective
review of their medical records was conducted along with
histological reassessment of liver biopsies. Patients were histologically graded into four groups including non-NAFLD,
NAFLD, NASH and cirrhosis. The cirrhotic group (C, n =
26) was compared to non-cirrhotic group (NC, n = 84), which
included patients with NASH, NAFLD and non-NAFLD.
Procedure
Primary bariatric surgical procedures, gastric banding (GB),
sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(RNYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch
(BPD-DS) were included in the analysis. All patients
underwent a laparoscopic approach for their bariatric surgery,
except one who had a laparotomy and RNYGB. Three patients were abandoned due to unexpected intraoperative findings of portal hypertension, which we have considered as a
contraindication to bariatric surgery. All these patients were
included in the study on intention-to-treat analysis basis. All
patients had preoperative weight and diet control advice and
were followed for a 2-year period after surgery. Postoperative
diet, vitamin supplementation and exercise advice followed
national guidelines as per British Obesity and Metabolic
Surgery Society.
All intraoperative biopsies were performed using a Tru-Cut
biopsy of the left lobe of the liver and fixed in 10% formal
saline solution. Paraffin block sections were cut at intervals of
5 mm. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and
Sirius Red for histological analysis. All liver biopsies were
recalled and examined by two blinded liver histopathologists.
Liver biopsies were assessed according to NAFLD activity
score (NAS) [14]. Steatosis was graded into 0 (< 5%), 1 (5–
33%), 2 (34–66%) and 3 (> 60%); hepatocyte ballooning was
graded as 0 (none), 1 (few) and 2 (many); inflammation was
graded as 0 (none), 1 (1–2 foci per × 20 field) and 2 (2–4 foci
per × 20 field). This gave a total NAS of 0–8. The presence of
steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning was considered diagnostic
of NASH. Fibrosis was graded as 0 (no fibrosis), 1a (zone 3
mild perisinusoidal fibrosis), 1b (zone 3 moderate
perisinusoidal fibrosis), 1c (periportal/portal fibrosis only), 2
(zone 3+ periportal/portal fibrosis), 3 (bridging fibrosis) and 4
(cirrhosis). Fibrosis grade 3 and/or 4 was considered as advanced fibrosis. NASH fibrosis stage 4 was classed as
cirrhosis.
Data Collection
Patient demographics (age, gender and BMI), comorbidities
(diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea and metabolic syndrome), serum biochemistry (lipid profile, liver and
renal functions), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)
and Child-Pugh scoring were recorded and used to assess
1242 OBES SURG (2020) 30:1241–1248

patient’s preoperative risk factors. Preoperative evidence of
metabolic syndrome was recorded using the International
Diabetes Federation consensus definition of the metabolic
syndrome.
Diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia
was confirmed from medical records. Diabetes was diagnosed
if there had been use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents,
haemoglobin A1c level of greater than 6.5% or fasting blood
glucose level of greater than 126 mg/dl. Hypertension was
defined as a sustained blood pressure of greater than 140/
90 mmHg or greater than 130/80 mmHg for patients with
diabetes or the use of antihypertensive medications.
Dyslipidaemia was defined as the use of lipid-lowering therapy or on the basis of laboratory findings of low-density lipoprotein level of 130 mg/dl or more (3.3 mmol/l), triglyceride
level of 150 mg/ml or more (1.7 mmol/l) or high-density lipoprotein level of less than 40 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) in men and
less than 50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) in women.
MELD score was calculated using preoperative biochemistry [bilirubin (mg/dl), serum sodium (mEq/l), international
normalised ratio (INR), serum creatinine (mg/dl)] and age.
Child-Pugh class was calculated using the perioperative presence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and serum biochemistry [bilirubin (mg/dl), serum albumin (g/dl), prothrombin
time (seconds)].
Clinical outcomes including 30-day postoperative complications, mortality and readmission rate as well as patient’s
length of stay were recorded. Postoperative surgical complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (grades I–V) (Table 1) [15].
The C group was further sub-analysed for the presence of
long-term liver-related complications such as mortality, decompensation, development of ascites, portal hypertension and
MELD scores after surgery. We compared preoperative and
postoperative MELD scores to study the impact of bariatric
surgery on liver disease in the long term. Long-term follow-up
was conducted by retrospective analysis of available medical
records and up-to-date information from general practitioners.
Statistical Analysis
The continuous variables are expressed as median (range), and
categorical variables are expressed as percentage (n/total number) in order of C vs NC. Variables were assessed for normality using histograms and Q-Q plots. Chi-square test was applied to compare categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney U
test was used for non-parametric data analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical package (version
23; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and a p value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Bariatric surgical procedures and liver biopsies were undertaken in a cohort of 110 patients. The median age was 45 years
(24–75) and BMI 51 kg/m2 (37–81). Three quarters of the
cohort were female. Comorbidities included type 2 diabetes
(45%) and hypertension (52%). Metabolic syndrome was
present in 64% of patients. Operations performed included
laparoscopic RNYGB (58%, 64/110), laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy (LSG) (35%, 38/110), laparoscopic adjustable
gastric banding (LABG) (3%, 3/110) and laparoscopic
biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS) (2%,
2/110). Three patients were abandoned after an unexpected
intraoperative finding of portal hypertension. There was no
30-day perioperative mortality or postoperative liver decompensation. The overall complication rate was 22% (24/110),
with 8% (9/110) of patients being suffered from ClavienDindo (CD) class ≥ III complications.
Histological Grading
Based on histological confirmation, our studied cohort
consisted of 24% (26/110) of cirrhotic patients, which were
compared against a group of non-cirrhotic patients. The latter
group consisted of 44% of patients with NASH (49/110), 22%
(24/110) of patients with NAFLD and 10% (11/110) of patients with non-NAFLD. One histology showed advanced fibrosis grade 3 and had cirrhotic macro-nodular appearance of
liver intraoperatively, another was later found to have portal
hypertension and, therefore, 24% (26/110) patients were
classed as cirrhotic.
Cirrhosis vs Non-cirrhosis Group (Table 2)
The C group was older (years) (52 vs 43, p < 0.05), with lower
BMI (kg/m2
) (46 vs 52, p < 0.05) and less weight (kg) (126 vs
145, p < 0.05), and was more likely to be of male gender (14/

26 vs 15/84, p < 0.01) than the NC group. Type 2 diabetes
mellitus and metabolic syndrome were significantly more
common in the C group (22/26 vs 28/84, p < 0.001; 25/26 vs
45/84, p < 0.001, respectively). Hypertension and obstructive
sleep apnoea were similar in both groups (Table 2).
The C group had significantly higher levels of gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT, U/l) (119, 29–450 vs 37, 8–321,
p < 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, U/l) (47, 18–384 vs
22, 13–83, p < 0.05), prothrombin time (INR) (1.07, 0.8–1.4 vs
1, 0.8–1.2, p < 0.05) and lower platelets (× 109
/l) (221, 59–892
vs 294, 198–505, p < 0.05) compared to the NC group. There
were no significant differences between bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, creatinine, cholesterol and triglycerides.
The C group had a median MELD score of 7 (6–24), and majority were Child-Pugh A (99%, 104/105).
The overall rate of complications was greater in the C
group (10/26 vs 14/84, p < 0.05) than in the NC group. The
CD class ≥ III complication rate was 12% (3/26) in the C
group compared to 7% (6/84) in the NC group (p < 0.05)
(Tables 3 and 4). In sub-group analysis, the C group had significantly higher rate and severity of complications compared
to the other groups (NASH, NAFLD, non-NAFLD)
(p < 0.05). The overall complication rate in the NASH subgroup was 22% (11/49), while the rate of CD class ≥ III complication was 8% (4/49). The CD class ≥ III complication rate
in the other subgroups was as follows: for NAFLD, 8% (2/24),
and for non-NAFLD, 0% (0/11).
The C group was further followed up for a median of
4.5 years (range 2–11 years) to monitor long-term cirrhotic
complications and the effect of bariatric surgery on overall
mortality. None of the patients developed cirrhosis-related
complications such as decompensation, ascites or portal hypertension, and there was no mortality.
There was significant improvement in postoperative
MELD scores (7 vs 6, p value < 0.01) at a 4.5-year followup (range 2–11 years).
Complication rates were not influenced by histological liver grading; advanced fibrosis (grades 3 and 4) had a similar
rate of complication with no or mild fibrosis (11/47 vs 13/63).
Similarly, the degree of inflammation, whether advanced
(grade 2) or less, did not influence the complication rate
[21% (5/24) vs 22% (19/86)]. The severity of complications
was also not influenced by an increasing degree of fibrosis or
inflammation. The overall length of stay and rate of readmission were similar in both groups.

longevity [16–18]. An elevated BMI in a cirrhotic patient is
considered to be a strong predictor of decompensation [19].
Decreasing weight in the latter group may thus improve their
long-term outcome by reducing the risk of decompensation,
improve eligibility for liver transplantation as well as resolution
of comorbidities and decrease the risk of surgery [11, 20, 21].
Diet and exercise have an important role in the treatment of
obesity. Their effectiveness in NAFLD has been demonstrated, with improvement in liver enzymes and liver morphology
even in the absence of weight loss [22–24]. In obese cirrhotic
patients, there is a lack of randomised evidence in the evaluation of diet or exercise. Pharmacological measures have a
role in the management of obesity, with total body weight loss
of up to 10%. They are not as effective as surgery, and there is
rebound weight gain once medication is discontinued.
Surgery in cirrhotic patients is known to be associated with
an increased perioperative risk for abdominal and nonabdominal surgery, due to multiple risk factors such as hypoalbuminemia, anaemia, malnutrition, coagulation abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, susceptibility to infections and risk of decompensation [10, 12]. Postoperatively,
these patients may develop liver dysfunction requiring intensive monitoring, ascites which may leak through the wound or
compromise healing of anastomosis and life-threatening
multiple organ failure. In addition, thickening of the peritoneum, splenomegaly and presence of varices may impose technical difficulty and increase the risk of bleeding [25].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome were
significantly more common in the C group compared to the
NC group [84% vs 33% (p < 0.001) and 96% vs 53%
(p < 0.001), respectively]. Metabolic syndrome is known to
adversely affect the perioperative outcome of various other
surgical procedures, but its effects on postoperative complications after bariatric surgery have not been studied in detail. In a
recent study, involving 168,501 bariatric patients and 18,516
metabolic syndrome patients (11%), Gondal et al. [26] suggested that the presence of metabolic syndrome does not predict postoperative morbidity or complications in bariatric patients. However, the effects of metabolic syndrome on the
outcome of bariatric surgery in cirrhotic patients have yet to
be established.
The cirrhotic patients in this cohort undergoing bariatric
surgery had a higher complication rate (38%) and severity of
complication compared to those in the non-cirrhotic group
(16%). Similar complication rates of 30–35% have been
found by other investigators performing bariatric surgery in
cirrhotic patients [12, 20, 27]. The severity of complication of
CD class ≥ III was 12% in cirrhotic patients compared to 7%

The difference in severity was assessed using chi-square test. The cirrhosis group had more severe complications

in non-cirrhotic patients (p < 0.05). The overall median length
of stay was similar between the cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic
groups [5 (2–20) vs 4 (1–51), p = NS], and this was despite
the increased complication rate in the cirrhotic group. No perioperative mortality was observed in either group.
In-hospital mortality is shown to be 1.2% for all cirrhotic
patients compared to 0.9% in compensated cirrhotic patients
and 0.3% in non-cirrhotic patients [1]. Our study shows that
in well-compensated cirrhotic bariatric patients (Child-Pugh A),
various forms of bariatric surgical procedures are feasible at
acceptable complication rate. In addition, short- and long-term
perioperative mortality is rare (0/26 in our study). Rebibo et al.
[28] and Woodford et al. [29] report on safety of LSG and LGB
on similar patients with cirrhosis and confirm 0% perioperative
mortality, respectively. The overall complication rate of 22% in
our study is skewed by the number of cirrhotic patients in the
overall cohort, and possibly the BMI (median 51 kg/m2
, range
37–81). The incidence of complications in super-obese patients
(BMI > 50 kg/m2
) has been reported to be fourfold higher compared to the morbidly obese group (BMI < 50 kg/m2
). Eighty
percent of the deaths following bariatric surgery occur in the
super-obese patients [30–32]. Benotti et al. [33] confirmed that
BMI > 50 kg/m2 is the strongest predictor of mortality in a
cohort of 185,315 patients undergoing RNYGB.
Evidence regarding safety of bariatric surgery as well as
type of optimal procedure is lacking in patients with advanced
fibrosis or cirrhosis, and more evidence is required to assess
whether an increased risk of complications in such patients is
truly related to the degree of liver fibrosis and/or inflammation
[30]. In our study, the C group had significantly higher rate
and severity of complication as compared to the NC group.
There was no associated correlation between the type of surgery and complication rate in our small cirrhotic cohort
(Table 5).
Jan et al. [11], in their pooled data of nine similar studies
with an overall complication rate of 22%, have observed
lower complication rate in cirrhotic patients undergoing LSG
and/or LGB when compared to more radical malabsorptive
bariatric procedures including RYNGB and BPD [11].
However, these differences could not be substantiated statistically, and therefore, safety and long-term risks and benefits of
each type of surgical procedure cannot be confirmed.
In our cirrhotic cohort of patients, none of the patients
develop long-term postoperative cirrhosis-related complications such as ascites, decompensation or development of portal hypertension at a long-term median follow-up of 4.5 years
(range 2–11 years). Comparison of preoperative and postoperative MELD score in cirrhotic patients revealed significant
improvement (7 vs 6, p < 0.02), and this may suggest potential
benefit of undergoing bariatric surgery in morbidly obese cirrhotic patients.
The risk of morbidity and mortality after bariatric surgery
in cirrhotic well-compensated Child-Pugh A patients is further
increased by the presence of portal hypertension. The latter is
a recognised contraindication to operative intervention in bariatric surgery [34]. In our cohort, three patients had intraoperative signs of portal hypertension, and therefore, we had to
abandon their procedures. There is emerging data that bariatric
surgery may be feasible in cirrhotic patients with mild portal
hypertension with preoperative placement of transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [34]. Hanipah et al.
[35] have performed LSG and RNYGB in a tertiary academic
centre in 13 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. They
have reported a 23% 30-day complication rate with no mortalities [36]. Six of 13 patients had either preoperative or postoperative TIPS insertion. Shimizu et al. [12] successfully performed LSG in 2 patients following preoperative TIPS
placement.
One of the strengths of this study is that all patients were
operated on by one primary surgeon and thus reducing operator bias. Limitations include study’s retrospective nature,
small number of patients in each group and, therefore, risk

in bariatric patients would promote learning of liver pathologies and outcomes in such patients.
This study does confirm a twofold increase in the complication rate in cirrhotic compared to non-cirrhotic patients undergoing bariatric surgery. However, with appropriate
counselling, preoperative assessment and medical support, it
is feasible to undergo bariatric surgery safely. Surgery for the
cirrhotic patient, especially with the presence of portal hypertension, should be performed in tertiary centres with specialist
liver support.
Our results show that although bariatric surgery carries a
relatively higher risk of complications in immediate postoperative period (30 days), long-term cirrhosis-related complications (> 52 weeks) and mortality are not influenced in this
small cohort with long-term follow-up. The benefits of weight
loss and reversal of comorbidities may potentially improve
liver function. Bariatric surgery may be considered in compensated cirrhotic patients in specialist centres to improve
long-term disease outcome.
