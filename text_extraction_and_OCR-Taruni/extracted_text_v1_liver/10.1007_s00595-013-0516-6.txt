Abstract
Purpose We herein report our experience with pancreas
transplantation in 26 patients at a single institution in Japan
between August 2001 and December 2011.
Methods We reviewed the medical records of 26 pancreas transplantations performed in our institute.
Results The early complications (within 2 weeks) included one graft venous thrombosis, one arterial thrombosis,
and two reoperations for bleeding. Of the 26 pancreas
transplant recipients, five lost pancreas graft function. Of
24 simultaneous pancreas–kidney recipients, three lost
kidney graft function due to noncompliance. The patient,
pancreas, and kidney survival rates were 100, 96 and 93 %
at 1 year; 100, 80 and 93 % at 5 years; and 100, 67 and
68 % at 10 years, respectively. Of all these complications,
venous thrombosis after pancreas transplantation was the
most critical.
Conclusions As the largest series of pancreas transplantations in a single institution in Japan, our series yielded
better results than the worldwide data recorded by the
International Pancreas Transplant Registry. Routine postoperative anticoagulation therapy is not necessary for the
prevention of graft thrombosis if sufficient fluid infusion is
strictly controlled and the graft blood flow is frequently
monitored. When graft thrombosis occurs, both early
detection and appropriate intervention are extremely
important if the pancreas graft is to survive.

Introduction
In patients with type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplantation
normalizes the glucose metabolism, prevents the progression of secondary complications, and greatly improves the
quality of life. About 35,000 pancreas transplantations had
already been performed worldwide by 2010 [1]. Since
enforcement of the Organ Transplant Law in October 1997,
the number of organ transplantations has been increasing in
Japan, and 121 pancreas transplantations had been carried
out by the end of 2011 (unpublished data reported by the
Japanese Pancreas and Islet Transplantation Association).
We had performed 26 pancreas transplantations at our
institution as of December 2011. Although this number is
small, this is the largest series of pancreas transplantations
to be reported in a single institution in Japan.
Pancreas graft survival has been improving with the
development of immunosuppressive drugs and improvements in postoperative management. However, certain
complications still may occur, especially during the early
postoperative period. Postoperative complications such as
thrombosis, bleeding, infection, anastomotic leakage, and
pancreatitis can lead to graft loss. In this study, we retrospectively review our results of pancreas transplantation,
with a special emphasis on postoperative complications,
including a case of venous thrombus that occurred on the

ninth day after simultaneous pancreas–kidney transplantation (SPK), which resulted in graft loss (3.8 %). Although
the number of patients reported is small in terms of pancreas transplantation, this is the largest experience of
pancreas transplantation in Japan at the present time.
Methods
Twenty-six recipients (7 males and 19 females) who
underwent pancreas transplantation at Kyushu University
Hospital from August 2001 to December 2011 were
enrolled in this study. All patients had type 1 diabetes. Of
these recipients, 19 underwent SPK, two underwent pancreas transplantation alone (PTA), one underwent pancreas
after kidney transplantation (PAK) from brain-dead donors
(BDD), and two underwent SPK from non-heart-beating
donors (NHBD). We also performed living-donor SPK in
two patients with severe and life-threatening hypoglycemic
attacks (Table 1).
The immunosuppressive protocols included calcineurin
inhibitors (tacrolimus/cyclosporine), mycophenolate mofetil, steroids, and basiliximab induction. Anti-thymoglobulin could not be employed for induction therapy in
Japan until March 2012. We did not routinely use heparin
after the operation. Instead, ultrasonography was frequently
performed for early detection of thrombosis of the pancreas/kidney grafts or a bleeding episode. The ultrasonographic apparatus consisted of a model LOGIQ 7 system
(GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) and a 4- to 5.5-MHz convex probe for color Doppler and B-FLOW imaging. The
induction of dialysis, continuous use of insulin, and retransplantation were counted as graft loss. The survival
rates of patients, pancreas grafts and kidney grafts were
calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. We used the
JMP software program, version 9 for Windows.
The evaluated donor risk factors predisposing the
recipients to thrombosis included age, cause of death, use
of a vasopressor agent, body mass index (BMI), use of
desmopressin, pancreas preservation time, cardiac arrest,
and resuscitation time. The evaluated operation-related risk
factors included graft artery reconstruction, vein extension,
enteric drainage of pancreatic juice, and the use of left iliac
vessels for pancreas transplantation. The evaluated recipient risk factors included the need for preoperative dialysis, BMI, age, and duration of diabetes (Table 2) [4–12].
We compared the case of graft venous thrombosis and the
other 25 cases according to the risk factors for venous
thrombosis reported from various institutions [4–12]
(Table 3), and we carefully considered the postoperative
management of our department, especially for venous
thrombosis after pancreas transplantation.
Results
The patient, pancreas graft, and kidney graft survival rates
were 100, 96 and 100 % at 1 year; 100, 80 and 93 % at
5 years; and 100, 67 and 68 % at 10 years, respectively.
Complications requiring reoperations included venous
thrombosis and graft loss (n = 1), postoperative bleeding
(n = 2), arterial thrombosis (n = 1), intestinal obstruction
(n = 1), and bladder-to-enteric drainage conversion due to
bleeding from the graft duodenum requiring duodenectomy
(n = 1). Among the 26 pancreas transplant recipients, five
pancreas grafts were lost due to venous thrombosis on
postoperative day (POD) 9 in one patient, recurrent insulinTable 1 Types of pancreas transplantation performed at our

dependent diabetes mellitus caused by autoimmune isletitis
on POD 2560 in one patient, noncompliance on PODs 519
and 1195 in two patients, and rejection on POD 730 in one
patient. Of the 23 pancreas–kidney transplant recipients,
three kidney grafts were lost, all of which were due to
noncompliance (on PODs 1693, 1855 and 2704).
As indicated above, we experienced one patient with
venous thrombosis that caused pancreas graft loss. At
26 years of age, the BDD of the patient with venous
thrombosis was younger than that of the others. The cause
of death of the BDD was not a risk factor. During the perioperative management of the BDD, two vasopressor agents
were used; desmopressin was also administered. However,
in the other 23 deceased donors, more than two vasopressor
agents were used in nine patients, and desmopressin was
given to 19 patients. The pancreas preservation time was
831 min, which was not significantly different from the
others durations. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation
was performed for 47 min after cardiac arrest, nine other
donors also had developed cardiac arrest, and the average
resuscitation time was 39.8 min. Therefore, no major differences were observed in the donor factors between the
recipient who developed venous thrombosis and the others.
Moreover, two patients with SPK transplants from NHBD
did not develop venous thrombosis.
Regarding operation-related factors, graft venous
thrombosis occurred in one recipient without complicated
arterial reconstruction or portal vein extension, although we
employed various methods for vascular reconstruction, such
as Y grafts, I grafts of the common hepatic-gastroduodenal
artery, and portal vein extension. Enteric pancreatic drainage, thought to be a risk factor, was chosen in this recipient,
but the same drainage was used in 20 of 23 recipients in the
SPK group. Left-sided pancreas transplantation and the use
of a partial pancreas are also considered to be risk factors.
However, these were not used in the recipient with venous
thrombosis. There were thus no significant operation-related factors that were believed to have increased the risk of
venous thrombosis in this recipient.
In terms of the recipient factors, the presence of preoperative dialysis and the higher BMI of the recipient
(27.2 kg/m2
) compared with the mean BMI of the others
(20.1 kg/m2
) were significant among the various risk factors for thrombosis (Table 2).
The average hematocrit, urine volume, and fluid infusion volume in the 24 patients who underwent whole
pancreas transplantation are shown in Fig. 1. The average
hematocrit on POD 6 was 27.3 %.
Discussion
Pancreas transplantation improves not only quality of life,
but also the survival, of patients with type 1 diabetes.
Pancreas graft survival has been improving following the
recent developments in immunosuppressive drugs and

improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative
management. In patients with type 1 diabetes on hemodialysis and on the waiting list, the 5-year survival is\50 %.
Japanese recipient candidates on the waiting list tend to be
older and have a longer diabetic and/or hemodialysis period. In addition, many donors are considered to be marginal
according to Kapur’s criteria [15]. In this respect, our data
show relatively good results compared with other reports
[1–3]. However, organ shortage is a serious problem in
Japan. Pancreas transplantation has been performed in only
121 patients in the last 12 years nationwide. Therefore, the
waiting period is getting longer, with a smaller chance of
transplantation than in other countries. For these reasons,
special attention must be paid to prevent early graft loss.
The major causes of pancreas graft loss are usually technical failures in the early period after transplantation. In
particular, graft venous thrombosis frequently leads to graft
loss.
Certain postoperative complications, such as thrombosis, bleeding, infection, anastomotic leakage and pancreatitis, may occur after pancreas transplantation. Moreover,
patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal failure are
reportedly in a hypercoagulable state, which is one of the
causes of susceptibility to thrombosis after pancreas
transplantation [13]. It was previously shown that ischemia/reperfusion injury makes the graft locally hypercoagulable [14]. Furthermore, compared with the USA and
Europe, many Japanese donors are marginally adequate for
transplantation. Of 61 donors previously reported in this
country, 45 (73.8 %) were marginal donors according to
Kapur’s definition, including (1) donors aged C45 years,
(2) donors with an unstable hemodynamic state, and (3)
NHBDs [15]. These factors may have led to the increased
rate of perioperative complications in the recipients. The
reported rate of graft venous thrombosis after pancreas
transplantation at various institutions is 1–13 % [4, 10, 16–19].
The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) reported
in 2004 that the rate of graft venous thrombosis was 7.8 %
in PTA, 5.3 % in PAK, and 4.9 % in SPK [11]. Graft
venous thrombosis occurred in only one case of SPK from
a BDD in our series of 26 pancreas transplants, thus
yielding an occurrence rate of 3.8 %, which is relatively
low compared with the UNOS data.
A variety of risk factors for graft venous thrombosis in
pancreas transplantation have been reported [4–9]. We
summarized these reports and show the various risk factors
in Table 2. Among the risk factors for venous thrombosis,
we emphasize that the three-dimensional positional relationships among the external iliac vessels, pancreas graft,
graft artery, portal vein, and anastomosed duodenum and
intestine are absolutely critical. In particular, the portal
vein must be given special attention to avoid compression
by the iliac artery or intestine after positioning of the graft.
This is a key point for successful pancreas transplantation,
in addition to meticulous vascular anastomoses.
We were unable to perform a statistical analysis because
there was only one case of venous thrombosis in our series.
There were no differences in the donor- and operationrelated factors between the patient with graft venous
thrombosis and the others. However, the recipient BMI was
higher than the average BMI of the other patients. Obesity
may have led to a higher abdominal pressure and caused
graft vein compression and congestion, leading to venous
thrombosis.
Virchow’s triad has been a major concept considered to
lead to thrombus formation [13]. In pancreas transplantation, (1) the blood flow of the splenic and portal veins
becomes readily congested owing to the removal of the
donor spleen, (2) the vascular endothelium is damaged
owing to ischemia/reperfusion injury, and (3) patients with
type I diabetes and end-stage renal failure have a tendency
to develop a hypercoagulable state [13]. Pancreas transplantation thus fulfills the entire Virchow’s triad. Therefore, some reports recommend continuous intravenous
infusion of low-dose heparin or subcutaneous injection of
low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thrombosis [16, 20].
In many pancreas transplant centers, anticoagulation
therapy is employed to prevent venous thrombosis starting
on the day of the operation. In contrast, we do not generally
use anticoagulants to prevent bleeding complications.
Although our approach failed in only one patient, the
remaining 23 recipients who received whole pancreas
grafts had no thrombotic events without heparinization. In
addition to graft venous thrombosis, we experienced
reoperation for bleeding in the early postoperative stage in
three of the 26 patients. The risk of postoperative bleeding
is generally high in pancreas transplantation. Because
uncontrollable bleeding may become fatal, perioperative
anticoagulant therapy should be used only for recipients
with a high risk of thrombosis. We start anticoagulant
therapy only when signs of venous thrombosis are
observed. Thrombosis can be detected in an early stage by
frequent and careful examinations using the recently
developed, sophisticated ultrasonographic techniques.
Sufficient fluid infusion is a basic policy for the prevention of thrombosis used in our department, because the
concentration of hematocrit secondary to dehydration
increases the viscosity of the blood and becomes a risk factor
for thrombosis [21]. The postoperative hematocrit level
should be maintained at approximately 25 %. We administer
albumin products aggressively to maintain the intravascular
fluid volume. On PODs 1 and 2, an infusion volume
exceeding 1000–1500 mL beyond the urine volume was
given to the recipients. A sufficient fluid infusion volume,
equivalent to the urination volume, was given thereafter, as
shown in Fig. 1. The parameters that we check include the

body weight, inferior vena cava diameter, and cardiothoracic ratio. We evaluated these parameters carefully and
comprehensively to maintain the intravascular volume.
Early detection is extremely important for adequate
treatment of graft venous thrombosis. Recipients with
complete occlusion of the portal vein reportedly develop
hyperglycemia, epigastric pain, and hyperamylasemia [19].
However, based on the experience of Gilbert et al. [19]
involving 25 patients with pancreas graft thrombosis,
recipients with partial portal vein occlusion often present
with no symptoms. Therefore, frequent Doppler ultrasonographic examinations should be performed as a method
of early detection of venous thrombosis. According to
Gilbert et al. [19], 20 of 25 patients with pancreas graft
thrombosis had complete portal vein occlusion. The graft
was totally necrotic in 14 of the patients, whereas the other
six patients showed partial necrosis of the graft. Although
the thrombus was removed with a Fogarty catheter, two of
the six patients lost their graft in that study. In three of the
other five patients whose graft vein was partially occluded,
intravenous administration of urokinase and removal of the
thrombus rescued the graft. This confirms that early treatment before complete occlusion of the graft vein is critical.
In conclusion, as the largest series of pancreas transplantation performed so far at a single institution in Japan,
our series yielded 10-year patient, pancreas and kidney
survival rates of 100, 67 and 68 %, respectively, which are
better than the worldwide data reported in the International
Pancreas Transplant Registry. Among the 26 pancreas
transplantations, there was one graft loss due to graft venous
thrombosis in a recipient with a high BMI. Although pancreas transplantation may be complicated by graft thrombosis, routine postoperative anticoagulation therapy is not
necessarily required for its prevention if sufficient fluid
infusion is strictly controlled and the graft blood flow is
frequently monitored. When graft thrombosis occurs, early
detection and medical intervention are extremely important
before complete occlusion of the portal vein in order to
improve the survival of the pancreas graft.
