Abstract
The abdominal compartment syndrome is a state of serious organ
dysfunction. The syndrome results from sustained intra-abdominal
hypertension, which is indirectly identified by measuring intrabladder pressures (IBPs) using various priming volumes. This
technique is poorly standardized across published data. Malbrain
and Deeren have identified the risk of falsely elevated IBPs with
instillation priming volumes greater than 50 ml. This overestimation
appears to increase with larger priming aliquots. As a result,
erroneous IBP measurements may incorrectly label a patient with
the abdominal compartment syndrome, and therefore subject them
to the potential complications of surgical and/or medical
decompression techniques. The utility and benefit of using
continuous IBP monitoring is discussed. These data require
confirmation in other patient subgroups with younger ages, altered
body mass indices and varied diagnoses.
The abdominal compartment syndrome is a state of serious
organ dysfunction resulting from sustained intra-abdominal
hypertension (IAH). The syndrome affects all organ systems.
While the abdominal compartment syndrome is the most
obvious manifestation of IAH, lesser degrees of hypertension
are now being implicated as injurious to the critically ill patient
[1,2]. Physical examination has little role in the detection of
IAH [3]. Considering the importance of this disease, indirect
measurement of IAH is now advised for essentially all critically
ill patients undergoing resuscitation [4].
IAH is most simply identified by measuring intra-bladder
pressures (IBPs) using various priming volumes. An international, multidisciplinary society, the World Society on the
Abdominal Compartment Syndrome, has recently recommended IBP measurement as the standard reference technique
for the indirect, intermittent determination of intra-abdominal
pressure (IAP) [5]. Despite the simplicity of this method, it
remains poorly standardized across the published literature.
Basic research into the validity and standardization of the
method, as well as the true meaning of IAP measurements, is
immediately needed to guide the critical care community.
In their manuscript entitled ‘Effect of bladder volume on
measured intravesical pressure: a prospective cohort study’,
Malbrain and Deeren have begun to address the issue of
optimal instillation volumes in the indirect determination of
IBP, and hence of IAP [1]. This information is vital for all
critically ill patients, and the authors should be commended
for addressing such a simple but important question.
Although published vesicular instillation volumes range from
50 to 300 ml, the most accurate priming volume remains
unclear [6,7].
The study by Malbrain and Deeren [1] was a prospective
evaluation of the IAP effects of incrementally instilling 25 ml
fluid aliquots into the bladder. It comprised a small, but
critically ill, cohort of patients, with a mean Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 28. The authors
calculated absolute IBP biases using median values, and
showed that the IAP may be overestimated with instillation
volumes greater than 50 ml. Statistical increases in IBP were
evident with instillation volumes of only 25 ml, and became
clinically relevant at volumes of 75 ml, when diagnosing IAH
at a threshold of 12 mmHg [8]. This potential misdiagnosis
was actually common, with 23% of patients having IAH with
50 ml or 100 ml infusate, versus only 7% at baseline [1].
Simply put, overestimation of IAP appears to increase with
larger priming aliquots than 50 ml. As a result, overinfusing

saline into the bladder during this routine measurement may
incorrectly label a patient with IAH or abdominal compartment
syndrome, and therefore subject them to the potential
complications of surgical and/or medical treatments. This
could be clinically disastrous because the recognized treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome is often surgical
decompression of the abdomen [9,10]. While effective, this
treatment modality is itself morbid, with numerous potential
complications. As the importance of IAP in the critical care
setting is appreciated in a broader sense, the risk of
misinterpreting basic physiologic measurements will assume
a greater role. In addition to unnecessarily decompressing the
abdomen in a patient with a potentially normal IAP,
resuscitation might be altered if abdominal perfusion
pressures are erroneous [11] or if ventilatory parameters are
inappropriately adjusted [12]. Furthermore, other important
diagnoses may be ignored if IAH is incorrectly ascribed as
the primary pathology.
Other recent research corroborates Malbrain and Deeren’s
findings. De Waele and colleagues recently found that the
minimum volume required to ensure a positive oscillation test
was only 10 ml saline, and that progressive increases in mean
blood pressure were obtained with each successive 10 ml
aliquot [13]. We agree with Malbrain and Deeren that the
appropriate amount of priming may be only be that required
to create a fluid column without interposed air. This can also
be achieved with standard arterial pressure transducers
providing continuous bladder pressures measured through the
third limb of a standard three-way foley catheter. These
catheters are primed through a constant infusion of 4 ml/hour
saline [14].
Recognizing the simplicity of this method, we have postulated
that this immense wealth of physiological data may guide the
care of critically ill patients. This technique provides interpreting clinicians with IAP changes on a real-time basis, and
forgoes the need for the priming volumes. It also limits
detrusor spasm, false IAP values, and reduces nursing workloads. At our institution, we have begun to think of IAP
measurement as routine in the critically ill and it is something
we refer to as ’the fifth vital sign’.
In summary, Malbrain and Deeren’s manuscript is both timely
and important. It begins to address the standardization of
indirect IAP measurements and techniques. This work
requires confirmation in larger sample sizes and among other
patient subgroups, including those with younger mean ages,
alternate body mass indices and varied diagnoses. Despite
these needs, these data clearly show that large instillation
volumes may artificially elevate IAP values. These data also
imply that, if the clinician is not thoughtful, inappropriate
therapy might result.
