The pandemic infection by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) 
that spreading from China is generating a tremendous fow 
of information and one emerging point is the frequent association of COVID-19 infection with liver abnormalities. 
Studies from China showed an increase of transaminases 
and other liver enzymes in 14–53% of infected patients 
[1–4]. These abnormalities were generally mild with moderate increase in transaminase levels in symptomatic and/or 
severe forms of COVID-19 infection [3, 4]. The mechanisms 
are still mostly unknown. It may involve the role of the virus 
itself, the role of virus-induced infammation, liver hypoxia 
(thrombotic context, severe acute respiratory syndrome) 
and/or drug-induced liver injury (including paracetamol 
misuse, anti-infectious agents, etc.). Several anti-infectious 
and anti-cancer drugs with previous marketing authorization 
are proposed either to inhibit the COVID-19 replication or to 
minimize the clinical consequences and pulmonary failure. 
This concerns many drugs alone or in association, including hydroxychloroquine associated or not with azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir associated or not with interferon beta, 
remdesivir, baricitinib, imatinib, darunavir and umifenovir 
[5], and their immediate availability has led to their dissemination in several countries as compassionate use outside of 
clinical trials [5].
In this context, the REFHEPS (Réseau d’Étude Francophone de l’Hépatotoxicité des Produits de Santé), a European French-speaking study network focused on druginduced liver injury (DILI), would like to inform physicians 
that just within 2 weeks, four cases of lopinavir/ritonavir 
combination discontinuation were reported in COVID-19 
positive patients because of suspected drug-induced hepatotoxicity (unpublished data).
The withdrawal was based on isolated transaminases 
rate perturbation <5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
level without any clear evidence of relationship, especially 
chronologically regarding the introduction date. It concerned 
four males (mean age 60 years) hospitalized in intensive 
care units with comorbidities like arterial hypertension and 
obesity (mean BMI 32 kg/m2
) but not diabetes mellitus. 
The data issued from the French pharmacovigilance database are consistent with our observation and confrmed the 
trend of drug discontinuation based on a misuse of the DILI 
defnition.
The REFHEPS* network currently includes France and 
Belgium and deals with liver injury related to chemical 
drugs but also to herbal medicines and nutraceuticals. It has 
been created within the framework of the COST collaboration (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) and 
its purpose is to promote knowledge about the hepatotoxicity 
of health products, allowing better management and monitoring of DILI.
Hence, the REFHEPS group reviews regularly the data 
regarding the potential hepatotoxicity of all the drugs that 
are tested for COVID-19 and briefy summarizes currently 
known data on drugs used as COVID-19 treatment below:
• Hydroxychloroquine is a possible but rare cause of idiosyncratic DILI [6].
• Azithromycin may cause idiosyncratic acute liver injury. 
The clinical presentation is a cholestatic hepatitis arising 
within 1–3 weeks after starting treatment. Azithromycin

was also associated with hepatocellular injury, with a 
short latency (a few days) [7].
• All forms of interferon beta have been shown to cause 
hepatic injury, although most cases are asymptomatic 
and mild. Most of the time its presentation is transient 
with mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels 
and serum alkaline phosphatase levels usually normal or 
minimally elevated [8].
• Lopinavir administration is associated with moderateto-severe elevations in serum aminotransferase levels 
(>5×ULN) in 3% to 10%. The pattern of serum enzyme 
elevations varies from hepatocellular to cholestatic or 
mixed [9].
• Ritonavir, used at low ‘booster’ doses, does not appear 
to increase the frequency or severity of serum enzyme 
elevations, and those that occur are usually asymptomatic and self-limited, resolving even with continuation of ritonavir. However, due to its enzymatic inhibitor 
properties, ritonavir can enhance the plasmatic level of 
co-administered drugs which then raises the risk of their 
hepatotoxicity [10].
• Currently, we have very low data about the potential 
hepatotoxicity of remdesivir. This drug is not reported to 
cause liver injury in LiverTox [6]. Considering its compassionate use in patients with COVID-19 infection and 
the frequency of liver dysfunction with this disease, the 
attribution of hepatotoxicity to remdesivir is challenging.
• Baricitinib is currently being assessed in clinical trials 
as an inhibitor of JAK-1 and 2 for the treatment of rheumatoid polyarthritis. Its use has been associated with 
mild and transient transaminases elevation. In the large 
clinical trials, transaminase values>5× ULN occurred 
in <1% of patients on baricitinib [11].
• Imatinib, currently approved in several blood cancers, 
was associated with common elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but ALT levels >5 × ULN range 
occur in only 2–4% of patients treated for 6 months or 
more [12]. In addition, mild elevations in serum bilirubin 
can occur. These abnormalities are usually mild, asymptomatic and resolve despite continuing therapy. Nevertheless, imatinib has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury with jaundice [12].
• Darunavir was associated with moderate-to-severe elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (>5× ULN) in 
3–10% of patients overall [13].
• Favipiravir is approved for influenza in Japan and 
umifenovir is approved for infuenza in several countries. 
Data regarding liver efects are very limited.
However, one must keep in mind that the safety profle of 
a drug is not only determined by the drug’s characteristics 
and the patient’s background but also by the type of disease 
considered, as has been well described with sulfonamides 
and severe cutaneous adverse reaction in the context of HIV 
infection [14–18].
Since most of these drugs are susceptible to causing liver 
injury, we would like to remind readers of some basic principles for the characterization and defnition of acute liver 
injury.
Acute liver injury has been internationally defned on 
biological criteria based on the ULN of serum alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT), serum alkaline phosphatase 
activity (ALP) and serum concentration of total bilirubin, 
as follows [19, 20]:
• Elevation of ALT≥5×ULN
 or
• Elevation of ALP≥2 ULN (in the absence of known 
bone pathology)
 or
• Combination of an elevation of ALT ≥ 3 ULN with 
simultaneous elevation of total bilirubin concentration 
exceeding 2×ULN.
Variations of these parameters below the limits set above 
do not constitute a DILI and the withdrawal of the medicinal 
product should be carried out only after all confounding factors have been excluded, especially if the expected beneft/
risk ratio is positive.
As the level of elevation of liver enzymes alone is not 
sufcient to refect the severity of liver injury, we would 
like to remind readers of the criteria to assess the severity 
grading, which is based on the presence of at least one of 
the following [20]:
• Presence of clinical symptoms consistent with liver 
injury, in particular jaundice, encephalopathy and bleeding caused by coagulopathy and ascites.
• Presence of less specifc symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, abdominal 
pain, pruritus, skin rash, etc., which have been shown to 
afect the likelihood of a poorer clinical outcome.
• Blood testing of total and conjugated bilirubin, and 
blood clotting tests (INR, Factor V and prothrombin 
time) should likewise be considered in the assessment 
of severity. For instance, Hy’s law cases are considered 
when there is the combination of ALT>3× ULN and 
total bilirubin>2× ULN in the absence of cholestasis 
and a more signifcant cause [20].
Because of the fever and pain associated with COVID-19 
infection, several medicines agencies have warned physicians against the use of NSAIDs and promoted the use of 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) [21]. This statement could 

Drug-Induced Liver Injury and COVID-19 Infection: 617
have resulted in a possible misuse of acetaminophen and 
consequently in liver injury. Moreover, some cases of major 
acetaminophen self-administration for prophylactic purposes 
have been reported and led to a special warning by the REFHEPS [22].
One should also be careful with the use of traditional 
medicines (alone or in association with a drug) known to 
increase the risk of DILI [15]. Furthermore, it has been 
recently suggested that nutraceuticals could increase the 
severity of COVID-19 infection by decreasing the natural 
immune defences [23]. Consequently, ANSES (The French 
Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health 
and Safety) launched a warning on these products with antiinfammatory properties, including willow, birch, poplar, 
goldenrod, polygalas and all plants containing metabolites 
derived from acetylsalicylic acid like harpagophytum, Echinacea and curcuma [23].
Thus, considering all these factors, respect of the rules set 
out above and exclusion of confounding factors, in particular 
those linked to the patient’s behaviour in times of crisis, 
should enable physicians to detect a defnite DILI and to 
avoid inappropriate withdrawal of a potentially useful drug.
