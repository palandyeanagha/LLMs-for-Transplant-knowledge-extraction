Abstract
Introduction: Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a rare disease that affects patients of any age with acute or chronic
liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option of proved benefit, and can result in substantial
improvement or total improvement in postoperative gas exchange abnormalities.
Case presentation: We report the case of a cyanotic 13-year-old Pakistani boy whose chest computed
tomography scan showed normal lung fields and mediastinum with incidental findings of a prominent liver surface
with a collateral vein connecting a portal cavernoma to the dilated terminal inferior vena cava. Sonography of his
abdomen along with a portal venous Doppler study showed multiple collateral veins replacing the portal vein.
A liver biopsy revealed congenital hepatic fibrosis. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography with agitated saline and
a 99m Technetium-macroaggregated albumin perfusion lung scan confirmed intrapulmonary shunting. The patient
underwent a successful liver transplantation that resulted in improved gas exchange.
Conclusions: Hepatopulmonary syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained
hypoxemia with an evaluation of possible portal hypertension or liver disease even in the absence of other clinical
symptoms.
Keywords: Hepatopulmonary syndrome, Congenital hepatic fibrosis, Liver transplantation
Introduction
Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a complication of
portal hypertension defined by the presence of liver disease, hypoxemia, and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular
dilatations (IPVD) producing intrapulmonary shunting
[1]. The hallmark of HPS is the presence of IPVD, which
may be secondary to portal hypertension producing a
right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt [1,2]. The vascular dilatations cause over perfusion relative to ventilation, leading
to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. Liver
transplantation is the only therapeutic option of proved
benefit, and it can result in substantial improvement or
total resolution in postoperative gas exchange [3]. However, the postoperative mortality rate of patients with severe hypoxemia before transplantation has been high [1].
Patients with a baseline PaO2 ≤50mm Hg have been
associated with a poor survival rate [4]. We describe a rare
case of a child presenting with unexplained hypoxemia in
asymptomatic liver disease, revealing HPS and improved
gas exchange post liver transplant.
Case presentation
A 13-year-old Pakistani boy presented to our clinic with
cyanosis, an intermittent cough, decreased exercise tolerance and episodes of bluish discoloration of his hands
and feet that had been ongoing for one year. A clinical
examination revealed clubbing and cyanosis with room air
oxygen saturation of 88% in the supine position and 87%
while sitting. There was no history of jaundice, cholangitis,
hematemesis, melena or rashes. The chest was clear and
there was no heart murmur. An abdominal examination
revealed no abnormalities. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Skin examination showed no stigmata of chronic
liver disease. The patient had an increased alveolar-arterial
gradient (A-a PO2 gradient) of 26mm Hg and was started
on two liters of oxygen that improved his oxygen

saturation to 97%. His chest X-ray and echocardiogram
were normal. Spirometry revealed normal percentages of
predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second)
90%, FVC (forced vital capacity) 86%, and FEV1/FVC
89%. Cardiac catheterization showed normal pulmonary
pressure. His chest computed tomography (CT) scan was
normal. An incidental finding of a prominent liver surface
and collateral vessels connecting a dilated portal to the
dilated terminal inferior vena cava (IVC) and mild
splenomegaly was noted. Sonography of his abdomen
along with the portal venous Doppler study showed a
dilated portal vein. A magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan of his abdomen showed attenuated hepatic
veins and normal intrahepatic portal vein branches with
a maintained texture pattern. The main portal vein was
replaced by multiple prominent collaterals transforming
to a portal cavernoma (Figure 1).
His liver function tests, coagulation profiles, serum
ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, antinuclear antibodies
(ANA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)
were all normal. Endoscopy of his upper gastrointestinal
tract showed no esophageal varices. An ultrasound-guided
liver biopsy showed hepatocytes in lobules without significant inflammation or necrosis, surrounding portal fibrosis
and bile duct proliferation in the fibrosis areas with bile
stasis and little inflammation, all suggestive of congenital
hepatic fibrosis (Figure 2A, B).
Contrast-enhanced echocardiography with agitated saline
(CEE) and a 99m Technetium-macroaggregated albumin
perfusion lung scan (99mTc-MAA) were compatible with
an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. CEE is considered
diagnostic if the bubbles are in the left heart cavities at least
three beats after their visualization in the right cavities, as
was found in our patient [5]. 99mTc-MAA is an injectable
radiopharmaceutical used in nuclear medicine. It consists
of a sterile aqueous suspension of Technetium-99m
(
99mTc) labeled to human albumin aggregate particles in
the pH range of 3.8 to 8.0. 99mTc-MAA perfusion scanning
is a more sensitive procedure as it allows quantification of
the degree of intrapulmonary shunting. 99mTc-MAA particles >20mm in diameter are entrapped in pulmonary
vasculature and undergo decay [6]. In patients with a
right-to-left shunt, the 99mTc-MAA enters the systemic
circulation and distributes to systemic organs, as was
found in our patient.
The patient underwent a successful living-related liver
transplantation with no serious complications. Histopathology of his liver resection confirmed congenital
hepatic fibrosis. The patient required oxygen in the

initial postoperative three months until his PO2 improved to 90mm Hg in room air and he did not require
further oxygen therapy.
Discussion
HPS is a rare complication of congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Poor oxygenation with no major abnormalities detected
from chest imaging and spirometry was the best diagnostic
clue in this case.
HPS was first described in 1977 by Kennedy and
Knudson [7]. The currently accepted diagnostic criteria for
HPS are (1) presence of portal hypertension or liver failure,
(2) decrease of arterial PO2 (PaO2 <70mm Hg, or increased age-corrected A-a PO2 gradient, and (3) presence
of IPVD producing an intrapulmonary shunt. This is the
hallmark of HPS and is probably secondary to portal
hypertension and producing a right-to-left intrapulmonary
shunt [1]. HPS primarily affects the peripheral (precapillary
and capillary) branches of the pulmonary vascular tree at
the lung bases. The most striking findings of the present
case were digital cyanosis and clubbing with severe hypoxemia. Findings on physical examination of the chest were
unremarkable. The patient did not elicit platypnea and
orthodeoxia (reduced PO2 when changing from a supine
to an upright position) that has been reported in the majority of patients with HPS [8].
A recent study reported the prevalence of HPS in 31
consecutive patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension, in which only five patients had congenital hepatic
fibrosis [9].
Congenital hepatic fibrosis is a developmental disorder
that belongs to the family of hepatic ductal plate malformations and is characterized histologically by variable
periportal fibrosis and irregularly shaped proliferating bile
ducts. The clinical manifestation of congenital hepatic fibrosis is nonspecific, which makes the diagnosis of this disorder extremely difficult. The onset of symptoms is highly
variable and ranges from early childhood to the fifth or
sixth decade of life, although this disorder is diagnosed in
most patients during adolescence or young adulthood, as
was the case with our patient [10]. Although individuals
with congenital hepatic fibrosis rarely develop cirrhosis,
they may still face complications of portal hypertension,
particularly bleeding varices. In contrast to our patient, a
recent case was reported of HPS in a patient with symptomatic congenital hepatic fibrosis with severe portal hypertension and large esophageal varices who underwent a
successful liver transplant [11].
At present, there is no effective medical therapy considered useful in the management of HPS. Liver transplantation has emerged as a therapeutic option of proved
benefit, and it can result in significant improvement or
complete resolution in hypoxemia [3]. This resolution
may take a relatively short time, three months as in our
patient, or over a year as reported in some cases [12]. A
recent study reported that living-related donor liver
transplantation in children was associated with a high
survival rate, and it included three cases of patients with
congenital hepatic fibrosis [13].
Conclusions
HPS should be considered in the differential diagnosis in
patients with unexplained hypoxemia, and possible portal hypertension or liver disease should be evaluated
even in the absence of clinical symptoms.
