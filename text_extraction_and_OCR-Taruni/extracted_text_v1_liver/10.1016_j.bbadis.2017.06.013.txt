ABSTRACT
Biliary complications are the most frequent cause of morbidity, re-transplantation, and even mortality after liver
transplantation. In general, biliary leakage and anastomotic and non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) can be
recognized. There is no consensus on the exact definition of NAS and different names and criteria have been used
in literature. We propose to use the term post-transplant cholangiopathy for the spectrum of abnormalities of
large donor bile ducts, that includes NAS, but also intraductal casts and intrahepatic biloma formation, in the
presence of a patent hepatic artery. Combinations of these manifestations of cholangiopathy are not infrequently
found in the same liver and ischemia-reperfusion injury is generally considered the common underlying mechanism. Other factors that contribute to post-transplant cholangiopathy are biliary injury due to bile salt
toxicity and immune-mediated injury. This review provides an overview of the various types of post-transplant
cholangiopathy, the presumed pathogenesis, clinical implications, and preventive strategies.
1. Introduction
Biliary complications are a major cause of morbidity and even
mortality after liver transplantation. In general, three types of biliary
complications can be distinguished: biliary leakage, anastomotic strictures and non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS). NAS are frequently
accompanied by the formation of intraductal biliary casts, prestenotic
dilatations, and/or intrahepatic biloma formation (Fig. 1). These bile
duct abnormalities likely represent different presentations of the same
disease. While intrahepatic biloma formation results from full thickness
necrosis of the bile duct wall with subsequent leakage of bile into the
liver parenchyma this represents the most severe side of the spectrum.
There is no consensus on the exact definition of NAS and different
names and criteria have been used in the literature. Alternative names
are ischemic-type biliary lesions or ischemic cholangiopathy, based on
the radiological similarities with bile duct abnormalities that develop
after early hepatic artery thrombosis and subsequent bile duct ischemia
[1]. Although there is increasing evidence that ischemia-reperfusion
during the transplant procedure plays an important role in de development of bile duct pathology after liver transplantation, the exact
mechanisms may remain unidentified in individual patients [2].
Therefore, we propose to use the more general term post-transplant
cholangiopathy for the spectrum of multifocal pathologies that affect
the macroscopic donor bile ducts in the absence of thrombosis or severe
stenosis of the hepatic artery and cannot be explained by recurrent
disease (i.e. primary sclerosing cholangitis). Of all possible biliary
complications after transplantation, post-transplant cholangiopathy is
regarded as the most troublesome complication due to the diffuse and
multifocal lesions of the biliary tree and the resistance to therapy, often
necessitating re-transplantation of the liver (Table 1).
Incidence rates of post-transplant cholangiopathy, including NAS,
vary between recipients of a liver graft from donation after brain death
(DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors, ranging between 1–10% and 10–30%, respectively [3–6]. The relatively high

incidence rate of post-transplant cholangiopathy in DCD liver recipients
is raising concerns, as DCD livers are increasingly accepted for transplantation. In the Netherlands, the percentage of DCD liver transplants
was 34% of the total number of liver transplants performed in 2015 [7].
In the same year in the UK, 22% of all liver transplants were performed
with DCD liver grafts [8]. An increased acceptance of DCD livers has
also been reported by other countries.
During the last two decades biliary complications after transplantation have been a subject of extensive research and this has led to a
better understanding of the pathogenesis, enabling the development of
preventive strategies. The aim of this review is to provide an overview
of the various types of post-transplant cholangiopathy that can occur
after transplantation, and to discuss their presumed pathogenesis and
the clinical implications. Moreover, new and emerging strategies to
prevent post-transplant cholangiopathy are discussed. Other types of
post-transplant biliary complications, such as anastomotic leakage and
stricturing, bile leakage (i.e. after liver biopsy, biliary drain removal,
cystic duct stump leakage) as well as recurrent PSC, are outside the
scope of this review and will not be discussed in detail.
2. Etiology
Although the exact etiology of post-transplant cholangiopathy in an
individual patient is often unclear, in general three important groups of
mechanisms have been identified in experimental and clinical studies.
These three mechanisms include bile duct injury and subsequent fibrosis and narrowing of the macroscopic bile donor bile ducts due to a)
ischemia-reperfusion, b) bile salt toxicity, and/or c) immune processes
(Table 2). Despite the identification of these three distinct types of
pathogenesis, overlap occurs and especially the origin of NAS is often
multifactorial (Fig. 2). Intraductal casts and sludge can be detected in
combination with NAS, but it can also be found in liver grafts without
signs of bile duct strictures [9]. These casts are believed to result from
dead biliary epithelium that is sloughed off the bile duct wall and forms
a nidus for deposition of bile components (Fig. 1D). Intrahepatic biloma
formation represents the most severe form of injury of the biliary tree,
resulting in full necrosis of the bile duct wall with subsequent leakage of
bile into the liver parenchyma (Fig. 1B).
The high incidence of post-transplant cholangiopathy after DCD
liver transplantation and the frequent occurrence of bile duct pathology
after early hepatic artery thrombosis provide strong evidence that
ischemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of post-transplant

cholangiopathy. Although a liver transplant procedure is currently
unavoidably associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury, it is not likely
that this can explain the development of biliary complications that
occur late (> 1 year) after transplantation. In only 50% of all patients
that develop NAS after liver transplantation, NAS is detected within the
first year after the procedure. A similar percentage of NAS is presented
after more than one year [7]. Clinical observations and associations
with risk factors have suggested that late occurring NAS (> 1 year after
transplantation) is more likely to be caused by immune-mediated bile
duct injury, while ischemia-reperfusion injury usually explains the
early manifestation of NAS within the first year after OLT. In addition to
the detrimental effects of ischemia-reperfusion, direct bile salt-mediated toxic injury of the bile duct epithelium and bile duct wall contributes to bile duct damage that occurs during and early after the
transplant procedure.
2.1. Ischemia-reperfusion Injury
2.1.1. Primary ischemia
In contrast to blood supply of the liver parenchyma, which is derived from both the portal vein and the hepatic artery, blood supply to
the large ducts of the biliary tree is mainly provided by the hepatic
artery and arterial branches from the gastroduodenal artery. Together
these arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to a fine vascular network encircling the bile ducts, known as the peribiliary vascular plexus (PVP).
After transplantation, arterial blood supply to the donor extrahepatic
bile duct and the larger intrahepatic branches of the biliary tree is only
provided by the hepatic artery. This explains why early hepatic artery
thrombosis after transplantation results in overt ischemia of the bile
ducts, causing necrosis and subsequent leakage and/or fibrotic stricturing. This type of ischemic cholangiopathy can be diagnosed by direct
contrast cholangiography (i.e. via a biliary drain), endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance
Table 2
Main causes of bile duct injury in liver transplantation.
A. Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury
- Primary IR injury (i.e. during graft preservation and reperfusion)
° Luminal biliary epithelial cell loss, mural necrosis
° Peribiliary glands loss, leading to insufficient epithelial regeneration
- Secondary ischemia
° Damage and thrombosis of the peribiliary vascular plexus after transplantation
B. Immune-mediated injury
- Blood group ABO incompatibility between donor en recipient
- Recurrent disease in recipients transplanted for an immune-mediated liver disease
(i.e. auto-immune hepatitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis)
- Cytomegalovirus infectiona
- Chemokine receptor CCR5 (CRR5- Δ32) polymorphism
- Acute or chronic rejectionb
C. Bile salt mediated injury of biliary epithelium and duct wall
- High biliary bile salt/phospholipid ratio
- Insufficient protection by the bicarbonate umbrella
a Cytomegalovirus infection may lead to endothelialitis and injury of the peribiliary
vascular plexus causing secondary ischemia or the inflammatory response may cause
direct damage of virus infected biliary epithelial cells. b Acute and chronic rejection mainly affects the small, microscopic bile ductules and
not macroscopic bile ducts.
Fig. 2. Multifactorial proposed pathogenesis of posttransplant cholangiopathy. During cold ischemia (cold
preservation), warm ischemia and subsequent reperfusion epithelial cell detachment and loss is inevitable. However, epithelial cell detachment or loss
alone does not lead to the development of post-transplant cholangiopathy. Critical components of the bile
duct wall are the peribiliary glands (PBG) and the
peribiliary vascular plexus (PVP). PBG injury and PVP
endothelial cell injury are associated with the development of post-transplant cholangiopathy. After
transplantation an insufficient blood supply through
the PVP, leads to secondary ischemia of the biliary
luminal epithelium and the PBG. Moreover, bile salt
toxicity and influx of immune cells cause damage to
the bile ducts by a combination of inflammatory processes and secondary fibrosis and scarring.

cholangio-pancreaticography (MRCP). Typically, cholangiographic
images are characterized by multifocal bile duct wall irregularities
(strictures and dilatations), either with or without intraductal cast
formation and leakage of contrast into the liver parenchyma (intrahepatic biloma's). Although the cause of ischemic cholangiopathy in
patients with early hepatic artery thrombosis after transplantation is
obvious, this is often less clear in patients with biliary pathologies in the
presence of a proven patent hepatic artery. However, based on the
strong similarities between cholangiographic abnormalities found in
patients with proven hepatic artery thrombosis, an (post-) ischemic
cause is likely to play a role in patients with post-transplant cholangiopathy as well. This is supported by a strong association between
post-transplant cholangiopathy and clinical parameters of ischemia and
reperfusion that can be identified during transplantation [10].
At multiple time points during liver donation and transplantation
ischemia-reperfusion injury may occur. Primary ischemia occurs during
preservation of a donor liver. The conventional preservation method of
organs for transplantation is based on cooling and subsequent reduction
of the metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. This method, during
which the liver is flushed out with an ice-cold preservation solution and
subsequently stored under melting ice, is called static cold storage.
While cooling livers to 0–4 °C significantly reduces the need for oxygen,
cellular metabolism never reaches a complete standstill and an oxygen
and nutrient deficit is still built up. This results in well-described cellular and mitochondrial perturbations, such as intracellular depletion of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cell swelling due to diminished Na/K
ATPase activity and subsequent electrolyte shifts. Upon reoxygenation,
this is aggravated by the formation of toxic radical oxygen species and
other factors, such as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
that activate the immune system, leading to cell death due to apoptosis
or necrosis [11,12]. Bile duct epithelial cells or cholangiocytes have
been shown to be more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury than
hepatocytes. Especially reoxygenation of cholangiocytes in cell culture
experiments has been shown to cause more cell death than reoxygenation of hepatocytes. This has been explained by a slower regeneration of intracellular ATP after ischemia, a higher release of radical oxygen species and lower concentration of the antioxidant
glutathione in cholangiocytes, compared to hepatocytes [13].
The length of the cold ischemia time (CIT), defined as the time from
aortic flush in the donor until graft reperfusion in the recipient, is an
established risk factor for the development of NAS. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that a prolonged CIT correlates with an increased
incidence of NAS. While an a 2% incidence of NAS has been reported in
donor livers with a CIT of < 12 h, this increased to 35% after a CIT
of > 12 h [1,14,15]. Transplant surgeons are aware of this and generally try to maintain the CIT below 12 h.
Additional to cold ischemia during storage and transportation, liver
grafts from DCD donors suffer from warm ischemia in the donor (DWIT)
during the time period between withdrawal of life support and initiation of cold flush out with preservation fluid. Several studies have
shown that the length DWIT is a significant predictor of the development of NAS [16–19]. One study concluded that each additional minute
of DWIT increases the risk of developing NAS by 16% [17]. More
specifically, the time from asystole to cold flush is critical in this perspective and significant differences in the incidence of NAS have been
found depending of the length of this time period. However, ischemia
can also occur between withdrawal of life support and circulatory arrest, since during this time period a drop in blood pressure and oxygen
saturation is frequently observed. For example, the duration of a systolic blood pressure below 50 mm Hg from withdrawal of life support
until cold flush has been identified as a significant predictor of poor
outcome after DCD liver transplantation [20].
Apart from CIT and DWIT, all liver grafts endure a (second) period
of warm ischemia during graft implantation, when the liver is taken
from ice, placed in the recipient's abdomen and vascular anastomoses
are constructed. In most centers portal reperfusion is performed prior to
hepatic artery reperfusion, because this allows early decompression of
the splanchnic venous outflow. However, portal blood has a relatively
low oxygen saturation and does not contribute much to the biliary
perfusion. Therefore, portal reperfusion of a donor may result in additional warm ischemia of the biliary tree. Since the bile ducts are mainly
dependent on oxygen-rich blood supply from the hepatic artery, artery
first or simultaneous reperfusion has been suggested to be superior to
sequential reperfusion in preventing additional ischemic injury of the
bile ducts. However, evidence for this is not unequivocal and conflicting data have been reported from different clinical studies [21–26].
In one, relatively small, prospective randomized study comparing sequential and simultaneous reperfusion, a significantly lower incidence
of NAS was observed in livers after simultaneous reperfusion [22].
However, in another large multicenter analysis comparing different
graft reperfusion techniques no differences in graft survival or biliary
complications were found between the groups [23]. To this end it
should be noted that although the main blood supply to the bile ducts
comes from the hepatic artery, portal blood flow contributes to the
peribiliary vascularization as well via intrahepatic anastomoses between the portal and arterial circulation. This explains why bleeding
from the cut surface of the extrahepatic donor bile duct is frequently
seen after portal reperfusion of a liver graft. Interestingly, NAS has also
been reported in case reports of portal vein thrombosis or stenosis after
transplantation, suggesting that inadequate portal perfusion should be
considered a risk factor for the development of NAS as well [27,28].
2.1.2. Secondary ischemia
Apart from primary ischemia that affects the bile ducts during the
various stages of the transplant procedure, secondary ischemia may
occur after transplantation due to injury of the PVP. When endothelial
cells of the small arteries, capillaries and veins of the PVP are damaged
due to the ischemia and/or immune-mediated processes coagulation
activation and intravascular formation of microthrombi occurs, resulting in secondary ischemia of the biliary epithelium and other bile
duct wall components. Therefore, inadequate flush out and preservation of the PVP of donor livers has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying the development of NAS after liver transplantation.
In this regard, the use of preservation fluids with a high viscosity has
been associated with a higher risk of NAS, compared to low-viscosity
preservation fluids. It is thought that a high-viscosity preservation fluid,
such as the University of Wisconsin solution, do not reach and flush out
the PVP as well as low-viscosity fluids, such as histidine-tryptophanketoglutarate (HTK) and Marshall solution [29,30]. Although some
studies have suggested that low-viscosity preservation fluids are indeed
associated with a lower incidence of NAS after transplantation, these
findings were contradicted by large database studies that showed superior graft survival of livers preserved with UW solution, compared to
HTK solution [31–34].
The importance of adequate preservation of the microvasculature of
the bile ducts was recently emphasized in a large clinical study with
histological examination of bile duct samples taken at the time of
transplantation. The histological grade and severity of injury of the
PVP, including necrosis of small arterial branches in the bile duct wall,
was strongly associated with the development of NAS after transplantation. Especially DCD liver grafts had significantly more severe PVP
injury, compared to DBD grafts [35]. Endothelial injury of the PVP will
result in intravascular thrombosis after graft reperfusion, contributing
to secondary ischemic damage of the bile ducts (Fig. 2).
Another factor that could predispose to secondary ischemia is
steatosis of the liver graft. Due to swelling of lipid loaded hepatocytes,
severely steatotic livers have an impaired microcirculation, and steatosis of the liver has been associated with an increased risk for biliary
complications [36–39].

2.1.3. Insufficient regeneration of biliary epithelium from the peribiliary
glands
Ischemia-reperfusion injury of the epithelial lining of the bile ducts
has long been viewed as the main determinant of the development of
NAS. However, three independent clinical studies have demonstrated
that extensive injury to and loss of the biliary epithelium can be found
in over 90% of all livers transplanted [35,40,41]. Despite this extensive
injury of the luminal biliary lining, only a minority of these livers develop post-transplant cholangiopathy. This has led to an alternative
hypothesis that insufficient regeneration of the biliary epithelium, rather than the initial amount of injury determines whether a donor liver
develops post-transplant cholangiopathy (Fig. 2) [35].
Regeneration and repair of biliary epithelium may result from
proliferation of mature cholangiocytes aligning the bile duct lumen or
from proliferation and migration of epithelial cells from the peribiliary
glands (PBG). While proliferation of mature luminal cholangiocytes
occurs in case of minimal injury of the epithelium, proliferation of PBG
cells can be found after severe injury [42]. PBG are tubulo-alveolar
clusters of biliary epithelial cells that are connected with the bile duct
lumen via small glandular canals [42,43]. Apart from the secretion of
mucus and serous fluids, PBG are thought to play a role in the local
mucosal immunity by the production of anti-microbial enzymes. Recently, the PBG of extrahepatic and larger intrahepatic bile ducts have
been identified as a local niche of multipotent stem/progenitor cells.
These stem/progenitor cells are mainly located in the deeper parts of
the peribiliary glands [42]. Interestingly, histological injury of the
deep, extramural PBG of the donor bile duct at the time of transplantation has been identified as an important risk factor for the development of NAS after transplantation. Half of the patients who developed
NAS had > 50% loss of the epithelial lining of the deep PBG in the
donor bile duct, compared to less than 10% of the patients who did not
develop NAS (Fig. 3) [35]. These findings support the hypothesis that
the regenerative capacity of bile ducts rather than the initial amount of
biliary epithelial injury determines whether a livers develops posttransplant cholangiopathy.
2.2. Immune-mediated injury
Immune responses that target the biliary epithelium have been
proposed to play a role in the development of post-transplant
cholangiopathy. Especially NAS that are discovered relatively late
(> 1 year) after transplantation may have an immunological origin,
although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. A clinical
cohort study has identified an association between immune-related risk
factors and NAS occurring > 1 year after transplantation [10]. In contrast to cholangiopathy that occurs early after transplantation and is
likely to have an ischemia-reperfusion related origin, in late NAS the
smaller bile duct branches in the periphery of the liver are more frequently affected [10]. There are several immunological mechanisms
that could predispose to the development of NAS.
Firstly, ABO-incompatibility has been associated with the development of NAS. One of the explanations for this correlation could be that
perfusion of the PVP is hampered by the formation of intravascular
blood clots, causing secondary ischemic injury of the cholangiocytes.
Moreover, biliary epithelial cells express ABO-antigens, which could be
targeted by antibodies that are incompatible with the patient's blood
type and subsequently cause damage [44–46].
Secondly, patients transplanted for immune-induced hepatobiliary
disease, such as auto-immune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis have an increased risk of developing NAS [2]. It has also been
suggested that bacterial reflux into the bile ducts in patients with a
Roux-Y bile duct reconstruction have an increased risk of developing
NAS due to the inflammatory response induced by recurrent (subclinical) cholangitis [10,14]. However, this correlation between Roux-Y
bile duct reconstruction and NAS is biased by the more frequent use of
Roux-Y bile duct reconstruction in patients with PSC. In a large series of
486 patients transplanted for PSC, the type of bile duct reconstruction
itself was not identified an independent risk factor for NAS [47].
Furthermore, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with
the formation of anastomotic strictures and bile leakage [47,48]. Although the role of CMV infection in the formation of NAS is less clear, a
few clinical studies have provided indirect evidence for possible relationship between CMV and NAS. Post-transplant CMV infection has
been identified as a clinical risk factor for NAS [47] and CMV-derived
DNA has been detected in the bile of patients with NAS [49]. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism might be either direct or indirect immunological injury of the cholangiocytes. CMV can cause direct injury of biliary epithelial cells. Alternatively, infection of
endothelial cells lining the PVP might result in the formation of microthrombi and thus secondary ischemic injury of the bile duct wall and

epithelium.
Finally, a mutation in chemokine receptor CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32),
leading to a reduced expression of CCR5, has been associated with the
development of NAS [2,50,51]. Patients carrying the CCR5-Δ32 mutation have a 4 times higher risk of developing NAS, compared to noncarriers. This risk is even higher in patients transplanted for PSC [50].
CCR5 is expressed on immune cells and plays an important role in the
attraction of regulatory T cells [52,53]. Biliary epithelial cells express
binding sites for CCR5 [54]. It has been hypothesized that reduced
expression of CCR5 in carriers of the CCR5-Δ32 mutation leads to impaired attraction of the regulatory T cells to sites of biliary damage
associated inflammation. This could subsequently result in an uncontrolled and increased inflammatory response aggravating the bile
duct injury.
2.3. Bile salt toxicity
Hydrophobic bile salts have potent detergent effects and can cause
cell damage by either destruction of the cellular lipid membranes or by
induction of apoptosis after entering the cell [2]. The toxic and detergent effects of bile have long been recognized by transplant surgeons
and careful retrograde flushing of the biliary tree has become standard
practice during liver procurement. Unfortunately, there are no good
studies that have examined the best fluid to flush the bile ducts. While
some surgeons use cold saline to flush the bile ducts, others use organ
preservation fluids.
In addition to the detrimental effects of intraductal bile that remains
present during organ preservation, newly formed bile after transplantation can also contribute to bile salt-induced injury (Fig. 2). The
composition of newly formed bile early after liver transplantation is
different from “normal” bile. Although early after transplantation
biliary concentrations of bile salts and phospholipids are relatively low,
the ratio between bile salts and phospholipids can be relatively high.
This may increase bile salt toxicity due to insufficient micelle formation.
Bile composition is strongly affected by the expression and functionality of ATP-dependent biliary transporters. Expression of the bile
salt excretion pump (BSEP) and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3),
responsible for the biliary secretion of bile salts and phospholipids,
respectively, is diminished early after transplantation. In addition,
function of these transporters is reduced by the low levels of intercellular ATP. The impact of an altered biliary bile salt/phospholipid
ratio on the bile ducts has been described in both an experimental
animal study and a clinical study. Transplantation of porcine livers
from DCD donors with a DWIT of 30 min resulted in a higher bile salt/
phospholipid ratio in bile produced immediately after transplantation,
compared to DCD livers with a DWIT of 0 or 15 min [55]. In a large
clinical study including 111 liver transplant recipients, the biliary bile
salt/phospholipid ratio in the first week after transplantation was significantly higher in patients who later developed NAS, compared to
recipients who did not develop NAS [56]. These two studies indicate
that bile salt toxicity contributes to bile duct damage and the development of NAS in both DBD and DCD liver recipients.
Another factor that has been suggested to cause bile salt toxicity is
an insufficient HCO3¯-umbrella. HCO3¯, secreted by ATP dependent
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and cholangiocyte Cl−/HCO3- exchanger (AE2), serves to maintain an alkaline
environment near the cholangiocytes [57]. In an alkaline environment
hydrophobic bile salts are deprotonated, making them less capable of
permeating the lipid cellular membranes of the cholangiocytes. Impaired functionality of ATP dependent CFTR and AE2, caused by
ischemia before liver implantation, results in a less alkaline environment near the cholangiocytes [2]. Although this could make cholangiocytes more susceptible to bile salt-induced injury and cell death
formal evidence that a diminished HCO3¯-umbrella contributes to formation of NAS after liver transplantation is still lacking.
3. Presentation & diagnosis
Symptoms associated with post-transplant cholangiopathy differ
greatly among patients and are often non-specific. Symptoms may include jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. Not infrequently, abnormal
liver function test, such as elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transferase
(GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the first signs that indicate
bile duct pathology. In more than 50% of the cases patients present
with symptoms of NAS within the first year post OLT. As explained
above, the time of presentation depends on associated risk factors and
the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of NAS [10].
Increased serum bilirubin and/or GGT and/or ALP after liver
transplantation in combination with (not necessarily) clinical symptoms will require further diagnostic measures. Firstly, ultrasonography
is needed to evaluate patency of the liver vasculature, check for gross
parenchymal abnormalities and/or biliary dilatations [58]. However,
post-transplant cholangiopathy, especially NAS, is usually not detected
by ultrasound. A definite diagnosis of NAS is always based on radiological imaging of the biliary tree. When a biliary drain is used and
still in situ the preferred imaging technique is direct contrast cholangiography via the biliary drain. Alternatively, cholangiography can
be obtained by either ERCP or MRCP. When NAS are suspected, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is preferred as the
next step in the diagnostic work-up, since it is non-invasive and is
highly accurate with reported sensitivity and specificity to diagnose
biliary strictures of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively [59,60]. When an isolated anastomotic stricture is suspected, the preferred diagnostic technique is ERCP, since it gives the opportunity for direct intervention with
balloon dilatation and/or stent placement [58].
Different groups have proposed different radiological classifications
of NAS [10,61,62]. However, the clinical relevance of these classifications of NAS is not evident as the radiological severity of the strictures
does not always correlate well with the severity of the symptoms and
disease [61]. In most cases, abnormalities can be found in the entire
biliary tree. However, in some cases bile duct abnormalities are limited
to one side or segment of the liver or only the most central parts of the
biliary tree. These selected lesions of specific parts of the biliary tree
may be successfully treated by endoscopy or surgery, as discussed in the
next paragraph. Another exception may be the presence of intraductal
casts and/or intrahepatic biloma formation. Detection of these expressions of post-transplant cholangiopathy is clinically relevant as it has a
negative impact on the prognosis and therefore, influences the choice of
treatment. Although in general it is still uncertain how to determine
(beforehand) which cases of post-transplant cholangiopathy will progress to severe symptoms, requiring re-transplantation, and which cases
will remain stable, the combination of NAS and casts or sludge has been
associated with an increased risk to evolve into progressive disease.
Moreover, frequently recurring (bacterial) cholangitis in patients with
NAS has been associated with progression of NAS towards severe outcome [63]. Finally, intrahepatic biloma formation represents the most
severe side of the spectrum of post-transplant cholangiopathy as it results from full thickness necrosis of the bile duct wall with subsequent
leakage of bile into the liver parenchyma. This subtype of post-transplant cholangiopathy is associated with a poor prognosis and may require re-transplantation.
4. Treatment
Treatment of post-transplant cholangiopathy is hampered by the
often diffuse and multifocal involvement of the biliary tree. When posttransplant cholangiopathy develops, therapy should primarily focus on
treatment of infections (i.e. cholangitis) and securing adequate bile flow
from the liver into the bowels. Antibiotics, either intravenous or oral
maintenance, may relief cholangitis-related symptoms and complaints.
Endoscopy with repeated dilatations and/or stenting of the most severe
strictures can reduce severity of symptoms in 50–75% of the patients
Y. de Vries et al. BBA - Molecular Basis of Disease 1864 (2018) 1507–1515
1512

with NAS. However, even in these successful cases recurrence rates are
higher, compared to patients treated for a solitary anastomotic stricture
[64]. In case of a Roux-Y bile duct reconstruction it may be difficult to
obtain access to the bile ducts and in these cases percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage is an alternative. Surgical resection of the
extrahepatic bile ducts and construction of a hepatico-jejunostomy that
may involve several bile duct branches can be successful in patients
with isolated or predominant involvement of the common hepatic duct
and its bifurcation [65].
Unfortunately, in many cases of NAS antibiotics and endoscopic,
percutaneous or surgical treatment of biliary strictures does not provide
a permanent solution. The only effective treatment for therapy-resistant
post-transplant cholangiopathy remains re-transplantation of the liver.
Contrary to NAS, re-transplantation for biliary leakage or an anastomotic stricture is rare. In these cases, repeated ERCP with stenting or
surgical revision of the biliary anastomosis is usually sufficient
[64,66,67].
Reported re-transplantation rates for NAS vary between DBD and
DCD liver grafts. While re-transplantation has been reported in 0.6–2.5
% of the patients who developed NAS in a DBD liver graft, the retransplantation rate may be as high as 11% for patients with NAS after a
DCD liver transplantation [16,68].
5. Prevention
Since the treatment of post-transplant cholangiopathy is challenging
and often unsuccessful, focus should lie on the prevention of this major
complication. All three main etiological factors (ischemia-reperfusion
injury, immune-mediated injury, and bile salt toxicity) are potential
targets for preventive strategies. Since ischemia has been identified as
the most important factor contributing to the pathogenesis of posttransplant cholangiopathy better graft preservation techniques, that
result in less ischemia-reperfusion injury, have the greatest potential.
To this end, dynamic preservation techniques, such as in situ oxygenated regional perfusion methods in DCD donors and ex situ machine
perfusion of donor livers has attracted increasing research attention
[69, 70].
5.1. Machine perfusion
In DCD donors, a period of in situ oxygenated regional perfusion of
the abdominal compartment after declaration of circulatory death and
before organ procurement may enable resuscitation of the organs and
restore intracellular energy sources. Normothermic regional perfusion
of the abdominal compartment of DCD donors has been associated with
a reduced incidence of NAS after transplantation. It remains to be established whether regional perfusion should be performed at body
temperature, or can be successfully performed under hypothermic
conditions as well [71].
Ex situ machine perfusion of isolated donor livers has great potential
to become the new standard of organ preservation for transplantation.
Although machine perfusion devices were already developed in the
pioneering years of organ transplantation in the 20th century, the renewed interest in this technology has sparked an extensive output in
experimental and clinical research. An important advantage of machine
perfusion, compared to conventional static cold storage, is that it provides better perfusion and flush out of the liver, provides oxygen and
nutrients and, when performed at body temperature, enables functional
testing of a donor liver prior to transplantation. Currently, different
methods of machine perfusion of donor livers are being explored, including perfusions at different temperatures. Of these, devices that
provide hypothermic (4–12 °C) or normothermic (35–37 °C) machine
perfusion of donor livers have entered into clinical practice and research [70,72]. Many aspects of machine perfusion, however, remain to
be determined. For example, it remains unknown whether machine
perfusion should be performed during the entire period between organ
procurement and implantation, or can be performed for a shorter period
(i.e. short before transplantation). The first clinical studies indicate that
a short period of hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion after
conventional static cold storage (so called end-ischemic machine perfusion) is safe and results in significant reduction of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, it remains to be established whether optimal
bile duct preservation can be obtained by single portal perfusion, or
requires also perfusion via the hepatic artery. Since the bile ducts are
largely dependent on arterial blood supply, it has been argued that
combined portal and arterial perfusion provides better bile duct and
PVP preservation, compared to single portal perfusion [73,74].
End-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion is a safe
first step that may provide better preservation of the donor bile ducts.
Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion has been shown to resuscitate mitochondrial function and restore intrahepatic concentrations of ATP [75–77]. The restoration of ATP and resuscitation of mitochondria before transplantation is important as it results in decreased
formation of radical oxygen species, less Kupffer cell and endothelial
cell activation, and reduced activation of the innate immune system
after graft reperfusion. Since cholangiocytes are susceptible to ATP
depletion and most hepatobiliary transporters are ATP dependent, it is
conceivable that machine perfusion offers better preservation and
protection of the bile ducts [13].
Histological assessment of the bile ducts in experimental studies
support the possible protective effects of machine perfusion on the bile
ducts. In a porcine model of DCD livers, hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion resulted in significantly less arteriolonecrosis of the
PVP, compared to static cold storage [78]. Other experimental and
preclinical studies have shown a reduction in microscopic bile duct
injury and increased bile production after various types of machine
perfusion [79–82].
In the first clinical series of hypothermic machine perfusion,
Guarrera et al. have shown improved hepatobiliary function and less
biliary complications after transplantation of machine-preserved high
risk DBD livers, compared to conventional static cold storage [83]. In a
matched case analysis Dutkowski et al. have found a significant difference in overall and cholangiopathy-free graft survival between DCD
livers that were subjected to hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion and non-perfused livers [84]. Clinical studies on normothermic
machine perfusion have not yet been able to show improvement in
biliary preservation and a reduction of post-transplant cholangiopathy
[85,86]. However, when normothermic machine perfusion replaces
static cold storage and is performed throughout the entire period of
storage and transportation of a donor liver, this may significantly reduce ischemic bile duct injury. Currently, several clinical trials on
machine perfusion are in progress. In one European multicenter randomized controlled trial the effect of hypothermic oxygenated machine
perfusion on the incidence of NAS after DCD liver transplantation is
being investigated (NCT02584283).
Apart from better protection of the bile ducts against ischemia-reperfusion injury, machine perfusion creates the possibility to stimulate
regeneration and repair of the biliary tree of donor livers prior to
transplantation. Extrahepatic and large intrahepatic bile ducts have
been shown to contain niches of stem/progenitor cells in the PBG
[42,87]. This makes PBG an interesting target for machine perfusion.
Addition of agents that stimulate proliferation and maturation of PBG
progenitor cells to the perfusion fluid, especially under normothermic
conditions, could initiate timely repair of injured biliary epithelium,
preventing the development of NAS.
5.2. Prevention of bile salt-mediated injury
To minimize bile salt induced injury of the biliary epithelium during
donor liver preservation, it is current practice to flush the biliary tree
during organ procurement. Most surgeons flush the bile ducts with either a standard organ preservation solution or saline. Most of these
Y. de Vries et al. BBA - Molecular Basis of Disease 1864 (2018) 1507–1515
1513

solutions, however, are pH neutral or slightly acidotic, while bile is
usually alkalotic and biliary epithelial cells protect themselves against
bile salt toxicity by providing an alkalotic layer on their luminal
membrane (so called bicarbonate umbrella). Therefore, it can be
questioned whether current organ preservation fluids have the optimal
composition and pH to protect and flush out the bile ducts. Ideally, a
specific preservation fluid to flush the bile ducts which is not too viscous or acidotic should be developed.
6. Conclusion and future perspectives
Post-transplant cholangiopathy remains to be the most challenging
complication after liver transplantation with high morbidity and mortality rates. Post-transplant cholangiopathy includes a spectrum of abnormalities of the macroscopic donor bile ducts, ranging from biliary
stricture and cast formation to full thickness bile duct necrosis with
leakage of bile into the liver parenchyma. By definition, post-transplant
cholangiopathy occurs in the presence of a patent hepatic artery.
Nevertheless, ischemia-reperfusion injury has been identified as one of
the most important underlying causes of this type of biliary complication. Other factors involved in the pathogenesis are bile salt toxicity and
immune-mediated injury. Since treatment options for post-transplant
cholangiopathy are limited and often not successful, emphasis should
lie on prevention. Experimental and first clinical research data have
provided good hope that machine perfusion technology for organ preservation enables better protection of donor bile ducts and will reduce
the incidence of biliary complications after transplantation.
