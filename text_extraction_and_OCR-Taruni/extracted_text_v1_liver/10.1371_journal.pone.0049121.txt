Abstract
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most successful treatments for severe obesity and associated comorbidities.
One potential adverse outcome, however, is increased risk for alcohol use. As such, we tested whether RYGB alters
motivation to self-administer alcohol in outbred dietary obese rats, and investigated the involvement of the ghrelin system
as a potential underlying mechanism. High fat (60%kcal from fat) diet-induced obese, non-diabetic male Sprague Dawley
rats underwent RYGB (n = 9) or sham operation (Sham, n = 9) and were tested 4 months after surgery on a progressive ratio10 (PR10) schedule of reinforcement operant task for 2, 4, and 8% ethanol. In addition, the effects of the ghrelin-1a-receptor
antagonist D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (50, 100 nmol/kg, IP) were tested on PR10 responding for 4% ethanol. Compared to Sham,
RYGB rats made significantly more active spout responses to earn reward, more consummatory licks on the ethanol spout,
and achieved higher breakpoints. Pretreatment with a single peripheral injection of D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 at either dose was
ineffective in altering appetitive or consummatory responses to 4% ethanol in the Sham group. In contrast, RYGB rats
demonstrated reduced operant performance to earn alcohol reward on the test day and reduced consummatory responses
for two subsequent days following the drug. Sensitivity to threshold doses of D-[LYS3]-GHRP-6 suggests that an augmented
ghrelin system may contribute to increased alcohol reward in RYGB. Further research is warranted to confirm applicability of
these findings to humans and to explore ghrelin-receptor targets for treatment of alcohol-related disorders in RYGB
patients.

Introduction
The epidemic of obesity and its associated health consequences
represent a major cause of preventable death. At present, Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is the most effective method
to achieve significant, long-term weight loss [1]. It is estimated that
over 200,000 procedures were performed in the United States in
2009 [2]. Following RYGB, patients typically lose approximately
30% of total body weight or 60–70% of excess body weight [3].
Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, it is believed
that factors other than restriction and malabsorbtion of the
ingested food may contribute to the beneficial effects of RYGB
surgery [4,5]. Following RYGB, patients voluntarily restrict
consumption of calorie-dense, highly palatable foods such as fats,
concentrated carbohydrates, ice cream, and sweetened beverages
[6,7,8,9]. Such behavioral changes seem to be independent of
perioperative counseling of the patients, as they also occur in
animal models of RYGB.
Specifically, recent reports have demonstrated reduced preferences and motivation for sugars and fats following RYGB in
normal weight or obese rats [8,10,11,12,13]. Thus, it appears that
RYGB may reduce hedonic (palatability) and/or incentive
(rewarding) effects elicited by certain foods. Conversely, concerns
have been raised by clinical reports of an increased risk for ethanol
(EtOH) consumption following RYGB surgery [14,15,16,17]. Due
to these concerns, ethanol abuse represents a relative contraindication for surgery in most bariatric surgery programs [18].
Currently, discrepancies exist in the literature with respect to
actual consumption of alcohol following surgery. Several investigations indicate there is increased risk for alcohol following RYGB
surgery [14,15,16,17,19]. However, other studies show no change
in risk for alcohol following RYGB [20,21]. However, the broader
consensus is that RYGB patients have higher and longer-lasting
blood alcohol concentrations, and a shorter period of onset than
non-surgical controls when consuming similar amounts of ethanol
[22,23,24,25]. Changes in alcohol’s pharmacokinetics may alter
not only the bioavailability and stimulating properties of EtOH

acting directly on the brain, but may also influence the neuronal
and hormonal signals upstream of the reward system. To our best
knowledge, there are only two animal studies that have
investigated alcohol intake in a rat model of RYGB. One report
indicates that there is actually decreased risk for alcohol abuse
following RYGB surgery in ethanol preferring rats [26]. In
contrast, using a two-bottle choice paradigm in outbred high fat
diet-induced obese rats we found that RYGB rats preferred lower
concentrations of alcohol (2 and 4%) and consumed twice as much
as sham-operated obese controls and 50% more than normal-diet
lean controls [27].
Of special relevance, recent imaging studies have revealed
changes in RYGB patients dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)
expression in the ventral striatum and caudate nucleus [28,29],
an area involved with alcohol’s rewarding effects [30] and also
associated with susceptibility for alcohol use and abuse
[31,32,33,34]. Furthermore, hormones that have been shown to
change after RYGB, such as leptin and ghrelin [35,36,37], are also
known to modulate the dopaminergic reward system [38,39,40,41]
as well as alcohol consumption [41,42,43]. Therefore, it is quite
surprising that the extent to which RYGB may alter the
motivation to consume alcohol has only been investigated in two
studies none of which assessed either incentive or consummatory
aspects of reward directly [26,27]. The study by Davis et al.
compared self-reported alcohol consumption before and after
bariatric surgery in moderate drinkers and used conditioned place
preference (CPP) as a measure of alcohol reinforcement in a
selectively-bred alcohol preferring rat strain. Our previous study
[27] used normal outbred dietary obese Sprague Dawley rats,
which would be more representative of the RYGB patient
population not expressing increased susceptibility to alcohol use,
but our study only investigated the 2-bottle choice-preferences
between alcohol and water.
Accordingly, the present study utilized an operant self-administration task to directly evaluate the incentive motivation and drug
reinforcement of orally self-administered alcohol after RYGB or
Sham operations. Furthermore, a progressive ratio schedule of
reinforcement operant licking paradigm originally developed by
Sclafani and Ackroff [44] was used, as it has been utilized
successfully in our laboratory to measure the reinforcing value of
sucrose solutions [45]. Progressive ratio schedules offer information concerning the degree to which a pharmacological agent is
reinforcing by defining a breakpoint, or the number of operant
responses at which the subject ceases to engage in drug-seeking
behavior. In other words, the breakpoint is a measure of how
willing the animal is to work for the reward. Therefore, in the
present study we measured both operant responses for reward and
lickometer responses for EtOH intake, which we believe captures
both the appetitive and consummatory aspects of motivation,
respectively.
An additional aim of the study was to test the potential
involvement of ghrelin in increased alcohol self-administration
following RYGB. Ghrelin, a hormone produced mainly by the
stomach, was first identified as endogenous ligand for the cloned
growth hormone [46] and has been shown to increase food
intake in both rodents [47] and humans [48]. In human,
however, there is an inverse relationship between circulating
ghrelin levels and fat mass [49] suggesting that obesity is not
caused by hyperghrelinaemia. Recent literature shows ghrelin
increases ethanol consumption and ghrelin 1A receptor (GHSR1A) antagonists block the rewarding effects of alcohol in
rodents [43,50]. Most studies find changes in plasma ghrelin
concentrations after RYGB (see, [35] for a review), either in the
fasted state or following a meal [36,51,52]. Previous reports have
shown that ghrelin resistance can occur following diet induced
obesity in rodents [53]. This effect may be reversed by RYGB,
perhaps resulting in increased responsiveness to ghrelin effects
following the surgery. We hypothesized that if enhanced
sensitivity to the rewarding effects of alcohol following RYGB
is related to improved ghrelin signaling on GHS-R1A, RYGB
and Sham-operated controls would display differential sensitivity
to the effects of blockade of endogenous ghrelin receptor
activation with the selective GHS-R1A antagonist D-[Lys3]-
GHRP-6 during alcohol self-administration sessions.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and
Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and approved
protocols.
Subjects
A total of 25 (4 weeks of age) male Sprague-Dawley rats
(Charles River, Wilmington, MA) weighing 250–275 g at the
beginning of the study were used. Rats were housed in individual
cages and maintained on a 12:12-hr light-dark cycle (lights on at
0700) in a temperature and humidity-controlled vivarium.
Maintenance diet and water was available ad libitum throughout
the experiment except prior to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
when food was removed overnight (,16 hrs) and during the
operant test sessions when food and water were removed (for 2 hrs
in the morning). Additionally, the rats were put on a waterrestriction regimen limiting water access to 2 hrs in the afternoon
during an initial habituation period (4 days) to the self-administration continuous access licking task.
Diet
All rats included in the study were maintained on a nutritionally
complete high fat diet (#D12492; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) consisting of 5.24 kcal/gram (60% kcal from fat,
20% kcal from carbohydrates and 20% kcal from protein). High
fat diet feeding began at 5 weeks of age, and animals were
maintained on this diet for at least 26 weeks prior to experiments
and throughout the whole study.
Body Weight and Food Intake
Body weight and food intake were measured weekly except
during the perioperative period (3 weeks) and the EtOH testing
period (3 weeks) when measurements were taken daily.
Figure 2. RYGB rats worked harder for, and consumed more alcohol during oral self-administration. a) EtOH intake, measured by the
number of licks made on the spout containing ethanol during PR testing, was averaged and presented as Mean 6 SEM. RYGB rats made more licks for
2% (Day 1), 4% (Days 5–6), and 8% EtOH(Days 8–9). b) Active spout licks, presented as Mean 6 SEM. RYGB rats made more licks on the active spout
than Sham rats for 2% (Days 1–2), 4% (Days 5–6), and 8% EtOH (Day 9). c) The number of cycles completed by the rats (breakpoint) presented as
Mean 6 SEM. RYGB rats displayed significantly higher breakpoints than Sham rats for 2% (Day 1), 4% (Days 4,6), and 8% EtOH (Days 8–9). d) Inactive
spout licks, presented as Mean 6 SEM. There were no significant differences in the number of inactive licks made between RYGB and Sham rats.

Drugs
Sucrose (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) used for selfadministration operant training was diluted in deionized water
to 10% w/v and prepared daily. Ethanol (95%, Pharmco Products
Inc., CT) was diluted in deionized water to 2, 4, 8% v/v and
prepared weekly. The selective GHS-R1A antagonist D-[Lys3]-
GHRP-6 (His-D-Trp-D-Lys-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2; Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline and
administered intraperitoneally (IP) at doses of 50 nmol/kg and
100 nmol/kg, 30 min prior to the Progressive Ratio-10 (PR10)
sessions.
Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery
Animals were maintained on the high fat diet for 26–28 weeks
prior to receiving either RYGB or Sham operation. A detailed
description of the surgical technique and perioperative care for
RYGB has been published, except that Sprague-Dawley rats were
used in the present investigation [10]. Briefly, rats were fasted
overnight, but allowed ad-lib water prior to the surgery.
Anesthetized rats (isofluorane: 3% for induction, 1.5% for
maintenance) were maintained under sterile conditions and were
pretreated with a prophylactic antibiotic (Ceftriaxone: 100 mg/kg,
im; Roche, Nutley, NJ). An abdominal incision was made on the
midline and, in the RYGB surgeries, the stomach was divided to
create a reduced (20%) gastric pouch using a blue load GIA stapler
(ETS-Flex Ethicon Endo surgery, 45 mm). Measuring from the
ligament of Trietz, the small intestine was divided to create a
15 cm biliopancreatic limb and a 15 cm alimentary ‘‘Roux’’ limb,
with the remaining segment (65–70 cm) forming the common
channel. The gastrojejunal and jejunojejunostomies were performed end-to-side using interrupted 5–0 polypropylene sutures
and the abdominal wall and skin were closed using 3–0 silk and 5–
0 nylon. The Sham operated controls received manipulation of the
stomach and a transverse enterotomy at the same position of the
proximal jejunum; however, this was reclosed with interrupted 5–0
polypropylene sutures without forming an anastomosis. The
stomach was freed from caudal attachments, and a space along
the lesser curve was cleared of attachments as if a stapler was to be
inserted. However, the stomach was then replaced to its anatomic
location without further manipulation.
All surgical incisions were treated with 0.5 ml of subcutaneous
0.25% bupivicaine to minimize postoperative pain. Further
postoperative care included treatment with normal saline (sc;
50 ml/kg, immediately prior to surgery and after surgery, and on
postoperative day 1) and buprenorphine (0.5 mg/kg, im) as
needed for pain. Animals were given 24 hrs for the anastomoses
to heal before being allowed to eat or drink, at which point
animals were maintained on a liquid diet consisting of BOOSTH
(Nestle Nutrition, Minneapolis, MN) and ad lib water for 3 days.
On postoperative day 3, the Boost was removed and animals were
returned to their high fat diet.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
To test if impaired glucose control (i.e. due to high fat diet and/
or obesity) was present and could potentially contribute to
behavioral differences observed between surgical groups, an oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed 3 weeks before the
beginning of the alcohol tests (,3 months postoperatively, and
,40 weeks on the diet). For the test, the rats were fasted overnight
for a minimum of 16 hours and then given glucose (1.25 g/kg,
500 g/l) by intragastric gavage. Blood was taken from nicks made
in the tail without anesthesia at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after
glucose administration. Blood glucose levels were determined
using a glucometer (OneTouch, LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA).
Animals were classified as diabetic if the peak plasma glucose level
was above 16.8 mmol/l (300 mg/dl) at any time point after
glucose administration or a glucose level of 11.2 mmol/l (200 mg/
dl) at 120 min or later following glucose administration.
Apparatus
Testing took place in one of six identical operant chambers
(MED Associates, St. Albans, VT) in a testing environment
separate from the colony room starting about 4 months after the
surgeries (i.e. about 10 months on the high fat diet). All chambers
had clear Plexiglas tops, front, and back walls. The chambers
measured 30.5624.0629.0 cm (length x width x height) with a
grid floor above a removable waste tray. Each chamber was
equipped with three retractable sipper spouts that entered through
1.3 cm diameter holes placed 16.4 cm apart. Each chamber was
equipped with a 25W house light within a light and sound
attenuated cubicle fitted with a white noise source (75 dB). Ethanol
reinforcement was monitored by a lickometer circuit in which licks
on an empty bottle (the active or operant spout) triggered
deployment of a second bottle containing 2, 4, or 8% EtOH for
10 seconds, during which time licks from the EtOH spout were
recorded.
Figure 3. Antagonism of ghrelin receptors resulted in decreased reward and delayed reductions of EtOH-motivated behaviors with
an overall increased sensitivity in RYGB rats. a) EtOH intake, measured by the number of licks made on the spout containing ethanol during PR
testing was measured following peripheral (IP) injection of the ghrelin receptor antagonist D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (GHRP-6) and presented as Mean 6 SEM.
A delayed within group effect was observed in RYGB rats 2 days after testing with 50 nmol D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6, and 1 day after testing with 100 nmol D-
[Lys3]-GHRP-6, while RYGB and Sham rats showed significant between group differences during several test sessions. b) Active spout licks, measured
following peripheral (IP) injection of the ghrelin receptor antagonist D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (GHRP-6) and presented as Mean 6 SEM. RYGB rats showed
significant reductions immediately following 100 nmol D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 and made significantly fewer licks on the days following both doses. c) The
number of cycles completed by the rats (breakpoint), measured following peripheral (IP) injection of the ghrelin receptor antagonist D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6
(GHRP-6) and presented as Mean 6 SEM. RYGB rats demonstrated reduced breakpoints on subsequent days following D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 at both doses.

Training, PR, and Drug Schedule
Our standard progressive ratio (PR) training and testing
procedures have been described in detail [54]. Briefly, rats were
overnight water deprived for continuous access training. For four
days, rats received 30 min access to water in the operant
chambers, with an additional 2 hrs of access to water each
afternoon in their home cages to ensure proper hydration.
Following the 4 days of water training, rats were returned to ad
libitum water access, except that during the testing period subjects
were water and food deprived for 2 hr each morning. Sucrose
training then commenced, with rats given six consecutive days of
training using 10% sucrose on a PR10 schedule of reinforcement
to ensure thorough shaping of the operant response. Although
stepwise (,2% reduced during each phase) sucrose fading is
commonly used for ethanol self-administration due to the aversion
that rats initially display for ethanol taste, we followed a previously
established modified sucrose fading protocol in which rats are first
trained to self-administer sucrose in operant chambers, are briefly
exposed to 10% sucrose and 10% ethanol for 3 days, the sucrose is
then faded to 5% for one day, and the rats are subsequently moved
immediately to ethanol self-administration [55]. There were no
significant differences between RYGB and Sham rats during the
operant shaping procedure.
Once stabilized lick responses were obtained, training on a
PR10 schedule of reinforcement began. Rats were placed in the
operant chambers with three spouts: Spout 1 (left – ‘‘ethanol’’
spout) contained one of the three ethanol concentrations, while
spouts 2 (middle – ‘‘active/operant’’ spout) and 3 (right –
‘‘inactive’’ spout) were empty. Upon program activation, empty
spouts 2 and 3 were presented, with licks on the inactive spout
producing no programmed consequences and licks on the active
spout counting towards completion of the PR10 lick contingency
schedule, meaning the requirement for sucrose access increased by
10 licks per reinforcement (PR10: i.e. 10, 20, 30, etc.). If a subject
did not meet the scheduled requirement after 10 minutes, the
session was terminated without a reinforcement reward, providing
the animals’ breakpoint (operationally defined as the number of
reinforcement cycles completed). Assuming the subject reached
the active spout requirement, the ethanol spout was presented for
a 10 s interval, during which time the licks for ethanol were
recorded. At the end of the 10-s interval, the spout retracted and
the procedure was repeated. Licks on all three spouts were
measured. Three concentrations of alcohol (2, 4, and 8%) were
tested in increasing order by concentration, and each concentration was tested for 3 consecutive days for a total of nine days on the
PR10 ethanol schedule.
Following PR testing for alcohol concentrations, the rats were
injected intraperitoneally (IP) with the GHS-R1A antagonist D-
[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (50, 100 nmol/kg) or vehicle (sterile isotonic
saline) 30 minute before initiation of a PR10 session. These doses
were chosen based on previous studies demonstrating the efficacy
of this drug to reduce alcohol preference and consumption in
rodents [56]. A within-subject design was used where the same rats
were tested each day, first with vehicle (3 days), then with the low
and high dose of D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (once each), separated by
4 days with vehicle injections to maintain baseline and record
delayed effects from drug injections. Following the second (high
dose) of D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 injection, the rats received two
additional test days with vehicle injections.
Data Analysis
Body weight (g) and food intake (kcals) were measured daily and
are presented as Mean 6 SEM of Group (RYGB or Sham) and
were analyzed using ANOVA with Group (RYGB or Sham) and
ethanol Concentration (2%, 4% or 8% EtOH) as the independent
factors.
During phase one of the experiment, responses for EtOH
concentrations were measured and are presented as Mean 6 SEM
of Group (RYGB or Sham). The number of licks made on the
active, inactive, and EtOH spout, as well as the number of cycles
completed, were measured and analyzed as dependent factors
using two-way factorial ANOVAs with Group (RYGB or Sham)
and Concentration (2%, 4% or 8% EtOH) as the independent
factors.
During phase two of the experiment, the responses to 4% EtOH
were measured following vehicle (saline) or a Ghrelin receptor
antagonist (D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6). The number of licks made on the
active, inactive, and EtOH spout, as well as the number of cycles
completed were analyzed as dependent factors using two-way
factorial ANOVAs with Group (RYGB or Sham) and Drug
(vehicle, 50 nmol or 100 nmol D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6) as the independent factors. Data are presented as Mean 6 SEM of Group
(RYGB or Sham). All significant findings were further analyzed
using Fisher’s LSD post hoc testing. All analyses were conducted
using Statistica 8.0 (StatSoft, Inc; Tulsa OK).
Results
Body Weight and Food Intake
Preoperative body mass for RYGB and Sham was
741.5368.47 g, and 729.77612.35 g, respectively, and groups
did not significantly differ. All rats lost weight uniformly by the end
of the first post op week (RYGB: 660.75610.34 g, Sham:
678.43616.73 g). In contrast, by the end of the 3rd postoperative
week RYGB rats displayed a loss of 18% from their pre-surgical
weight, whereas the Sham-operated rats fully regained body
weight to the preoperative level (data not shown).
Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests
Fasting blood glucose levels and responses to intragastric glucose
load were tested in each rat 3 weeks prior to the behavioral test,
i.e. ,3 months after the surgeries. Fasting blood glucose levels
were normal and did not differ between groups (RYGB:
89.1466.16 mg/dl, Sham: 96.7564.16 mg/dl; F1,6= 0.006,
P = 0.940). Blood glucose concentrations were not statistically
different at 30 and 60 min after glucose challenge between RYGB
and Sham cohorts (30 min: 137.3566.81 vs. 144.7565.31,
60 min: 119.5767.01 vs. 120.7565.26, 90 min: 107.7166.62 vs.
118.3365.94, 120 min: 105.7965.58 vs. 114.5066.37).
During the experiment, body weight was significantly lower in
RYGB rats as revealed by ANOVA. We found a significant effect
of Group (F(3,51) = 20.8274, p,0.001), but not EtOH (2%, 4%,
or 8%) Concentration (F(6,98) = 1.6339, p = 0.15) nor a Group by
Concentration interaction (F(6,98) = 0.4745, p = 0.83) on body
weight. Post hoc testing revealed that RYGB rats had a lower body
weight across all days of testing (p,0.001; Fig. 1a). Figure 1b
depicts high fat diet intake by RYGB and Sham groups
throughout the study, presented in kilocalories consumed across
a 24 hour period. The multivariate ANOVA revealed a significant
effect of Concentration (F(6,98) = 4.0388, p,0.01) but not Group
(F(3,51) = 2.0012, p,0.13) nor a Group by Concentration
interaction (F(6,98) = 1,4579, p = 0.20). Post hoc analysis revealed
that on Day 4 (Day 1 of testing 4% EtOH), RYGB rats ate
significantly more in HF diet (kcals, p,0.05; Fig. 1b).

but not Group by EtOH Concentration interaction
(F(6,92) = 1.6440, p = 0.1439). Post hoc analysis showed that
RYGB rats made significantly more licks on the spout containing
2% EtOH (Day 1: p,0.01), 4% EtOH (Day 5: p,0.05; Day 6:
p,0.01) and 8% EtOH (Day 8: p,0.05; Day 9: p,0.01; Fig. 2a).
Figure 2b represents the average number of licks made on the
active spout by RYGB and Sham rats. The factorial ANOVA
revealed a significant effect of Group (F(3,46) = 5.5204, p,0.01)
and EtOH Concentration (F(6,92) = 3.5126, p,0.01) but not an
interaction effect (F(6,92) = 0.6858, p = 0.6615). Post hoc analysis
showed that RYGB rats licked significantly more on the active
spout to access 2% EtOH (Day 1: p,0.01, Day 2: p,0.05), 4%
EtOH (Day 6: p,0.01, Day 7: p,0.05) and 8% EtOH (Day 9:
p,0.05; Fig. 2b). Post hoc tests also revealed that on the first day
of exposure for each EtOH concentration, RYGB rats made more
licks for 2% EtOH (Day 1) compared to 4% EtOH (Day 4,
p,0.01) and 8% EtOH (Day 7, p,0.001).
The average number of completed cycles for RYGB and Sham
rats is depicted in Figure 2c. ANOVA revealed a significant effect
of Group (F(3,46) = 7.5465, p,0.001) and EtOH Concentration
(F(6,92) = 4.4775, p,0.001) but not an interaction effect
(F(6,92) = 1.0528, p = 0.3968). Post hoc tests revealed that RYGB
rats completed more cycles when testing for 2% ETOH (Day 1:
p,0.01), 4% ETOH (Day 4: p,0.05; Day 6: p,0.01) and 8%
ETOH (Day 8: p,0.05; Day 9: p,0.01, Fig. 2c). Post hoc testing
also revealed that both groups completed more cycles for 2%
EtOH (Day 1), but only on the first day of exposure. Both RYGB
and Sham rats completed less cycles when working for 4% EtOH
(Day 4, RYGB: p,0.01; Sham: p,0.05) and 8% EtOH (Day 7,
RYGB: p,0.001; Sham: p,0.05).
For the number of licks made on the inactive spout (for which
there were no programmed consequences or rewards; Fig. 2d),
ANOVA revealed no significant effect of Group (F(3,46) = 1.3549,
p = 0.2684), EtOH Concentration (F(6,92) = 1.9012, p = 0.0889)
or interaction effect (F(6,92) = 0.2872, p = 0.9417).
Experiment 2: Effects of D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 on PR10
responses for EtOH
In the second study, animals were injected with vehicle or one of
two concentrations of the Ghrelin receptor antagonist D-[Lys3]-
GHRP-6. Figure 3a depicts the number of licks made on the
reward spout containing 4% EtOH following injection of vehicle
(saline; ip on baseline and post- D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 days) or D-
[Lys3]-GHRP-6 (50 nmol or 100 nmol; ip). The factorial
ANOVA revealed a significant effect on EtOH licks made by
RYGB and Sham rats (F(1,119) = 40.410, p,0.001) and an effect
of Drug (F(6,119) = 2.3402, p,0.05) but not a Group by Drug
interaction (F(6,119) = 0.5190, p = 0.7930). Compared to vehicle,
D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 did not significantly alter EtOH licks on the
day that it was given for either dose tested in both RYGB and
Sham rats. However, it reduced the number of EtOH licks made
by RYGB rats the day after administration of 100 nmol (Post-D1-
100: p,0.05) and two days after administration of 50 nmol (PostD2-50: p,0.05), indicating a possible delayed, carry over effect of
the Ghrelin receptor antagonist. Post hoc testing showed that
RYGB rats made significantly more licks for EtOH on all but the
day immediately after D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 injections (Vehicle:
p,0.001; 50 nmol: p,0.01; Post D1-50: p = 0.07, Post D2-50:
p,0.05; 100 nmol: p,0.05; Post D1-100: p = 0.10; Post D2-100:
p,0.01).
D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 also reduced the number of licks made on
the active spout towards the completion of the requirement for an
EtOH reward (Figure 3b). The factorial ANOVA revealed a
significant effect of Group (F(1,119) = 27.5315, p,0.001) and
Drug (F(6,119) = 2.1824, p,0.05) but not a Group by Drug
interaction (F(6,119) = 1.5942, p = 0.1547). Post hoc tests revealed
that D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 reduced the number of licks made by
RYGB rats on the active spout following 100 nmol (p,0.05) and
on the days following both doses (Post D1-50: p,0.05; Post D2-50:
p,0.01; Post D1-100: p,0.05). Overall, RYGB rats made more
licks on the active spout compared to Sham rats after injection of
vehicle (p,0.001) and 50 nmol (p,0.001) and again on the last
day of testing (Post D2-100: p,0.01).
Figure 3c shows the average number of completed cycles by
RYGB and Sham rats following peripheral injection of D-[Lys3]-
GHRP-6 or vehicle. The factorial ANOVA again revealed
significant effect of Group (F(1,119) = 38.1615, p,0.001) and
Drug (F(6,119) = 2.9284, p,0.01) but not a Group by Drug
interaction (F(6,119) = 0.5650, p = 0.7574). Post hoc analysis
showed that although D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6did not alter the number
of cycles completed on the day of injection, there again appeared
to be a carry-over effect on days following the injections (Post D2-
50: p,0.05; Post D1-100: p,0.05). We also found that RYGB rats
completed more cycles on several days independent of Drug
(Vehicle: p,0.01; 50 nmol: p,0.01; 100 nmol: p,0.05 and Post
D2-100: p,0.01).
Table 1 shows the number of licks made on the inactive spout
on each day of D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 testing. The factorial ANOVA
found no significant effect of Group (F(1,119) = 3.3284, p = 0.071),
Drug (F(6,119) = 1.1026, p = 0.3639) or Group by Drug interaction (F(6,119) = 0.3313, p = 0.9193), indicating that the reductions
in EtOH licks and completed cycles on the post-D-[Lys3]-GHRP6 were not due to general inactivity.
Discussion
To our knowledge, the data presented here represent the first
direct assessment of incentive motivation and consumption of
ethanol following the increasingly popular Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass procedure in an outbred dietary obese rat strain. Although
our rats did not differ in preoperative body weight, significant
differences were observed after postoperative week three, and
continued throughout the course of our experiments. As can be
seen in Fig. 1a, RYGB rats had significantly lower body weights
than their Sham counterparts throughout the 20 experimental
days, indicative of successful surgical results and corroborated by
other RYGB studies that consistently show decreased body weight
following RYGB surgery [5,8,10,27,36]. Although our rats did
display the characteristic changes in body weight, these were not
accompanied by significantly increased high fat diet consumption
during testing, as our subjects only showed significantly increased
diet consumption on one of the 20 test days (Fig. 1b).
Perhaps of more interest, we found that RYGB rats displayed
significantly increased drug-seeking behavior when compared to
their Sham controls. As can be seen from Fig. 2b, rats that
underwent RYGB made significantly more responses on the active
spout to earn an alcohol reward during the majority of the testing
sessions for 2, 4, and 8% ethanol. Accordingly, subjects that
Gastric Bypass Increases Alcohol Reward

underwent RYGB also had significantly higher breakpoints (cycles
completed) than their Sham controls during the majority of the test
sessions, and particularly for 4 and 8% ethanol, as can be seen in
Figure 2c. Increased active spout responding and higher breakpoints denote that RYGB subjects were more willing to work for
ethanol reward than controls, indicative of increased incentive
motivation or ‘‘wanting’’ of the drug. Thus, although the literature
suggests that RYGB may reduce the incentive (rewarding) effects
elicited by certain foods, the converse may be true with regard to
alcohol. Our current data corroborate recent clinical reports that
show increased susceptibility to alcohol abuse following gastric
bypass surgery [14,15,16,19] and are consistent with observation
of augmented alcohol preference in dietary obese rats that received
RYGB [27].
Also of interest was that our RYGB subjects showed significantly increased consummatory behavior when compared to
Sham controls. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, RYGB rats made
more licks on the ethanol spout than Sham control subjects.
Although this is an operationally defined measure of intake, the
results show that particularly once acclimated to the behavioral
paradigm, RYGB rats made significantly more lick-responses for
4% and 8% ethanol on the last five test days. It could be suggested
that the augmented intakes are due to increased caloric need.
However, the rats consume such little ethanol during the
30 minute behavioral sessions due to the high PR requirement,
which makes it highly unlikely that caloric need is the decisive
factor. Indeed, recent clinical studies found no correlation between
increased alcohol use and the degree of weight loss [17].
Moreover, distinct to RYGB patients there were no changes in
alcohol use reported in patients that underwent a laparoscopic
adjustable gastric band [16], which indicates that increased
alcohol intake is not a compensation for restricted meal-size.
Rather, these observations of increased responding for ethanol
reward, and increased consummatory behavior are more likely a
result of changes in incentive motivation which is mediated
through the DA reward system and modulated by peripheral
hormones involved in the gut-brain system.
We next measured the responses of RYGB and Sham rats to
work for and consume 4% EtOH following intraperitoneal
injection of the GHS-R1A antagonist D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6. Rats
working for 4% EtOH on a PR-10 schedule of reinforcement did
not reduce intake immediately following either dose of D-[Lys3]-
GHRP-6 (Fig. 3a), but RYGB rats did reduce the number of licks
made on the active spout following 100 nmol D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6
whereas the same dose was ineffective on the Sham rats (Fig. 3b).
Furthermore, for all behavioral measures RYGB rats showed
significant reductions in the days following D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6
injections (Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c). This delayed response could be
due to a carry-over effect from the D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 injections
(for the higher dose), and may also indicate that the ghrelin system
is involved in long-term (associative and learning) aspects of
ethanol-seeking and consumption. Furthermore, these data posit
that RYGB rats may be more sensitive to inactivation of the
ghrelin system, strongly indicating a change in ghrelin sensitivity
following RYGB surgery.
While our observation of increased alcohol reward after RYGB
is supported by various human studies, several factors may explain
the differential results seen here from those in a prior rodent study
[26]. One likely factor is the selectively bred rat strain used in the
Davis et al. study, which is quite different than the diet induced
obese Sprague Dawley rats used in the current investigation, and
therefore, differential results could be expected. Another factor
could be differences in procedures between these two studies, i.e.
no sucrose fading was used in the Davis et al. investigation.
Although EtOH preferring rats seem more likely to readily
consume ethanol, it is known to be aversive to rats, which is why
some form of sucrose fading is used in most EtOH ingestion
paradigms involving rodents. Additional differences in the
paradigms include the use of a two bottle test as a measure of
ethanol intake, while CPP was used as a measure of reward. Thus,
strain and procedural differences are likely to underlie the
discrepancies between these two studies.
RYGB has gained popularity due to its ability to produce longlasting changes such as reduced appetite, decreased body weight,
improved glucose control, and changes in taste preference [57,58].
Despite its increasing popularity, the precise underlying mechanisms through which RYBG may produce these changes remain to
be determined. Reports indicate that a number of gastrointestinal
hormones change following surgery, including the orexigenic
hormone ghrelin [59,60]. Since recent studies in rodents showed
that ghrelin increased their ethanol consumption and ghrelin
antagonism blocked alcohol’s rewarding effects [43,50], we
investigated how ghrelin influenced EtOH intake in our surgical
model.
Ghrelin may influence both food intake and the motivation to
obtain palatable foods and rewarding substances through its
actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) where the cell bodies
of the dopamine reward system are located [61,62,63,64,65,66].
Ghrelin has been shown to stimulate dopamine neurons and to
increase dopamine release in terminal areas of the mesolimbic
dopamine system, including the nucleus accumbens [67,68,69].
Indeed in obese subjects a recent PET study reported that ghrelin
levels were inversely associated with D2R availability in limbic
brain regions including ventral striatum (location of the nucleus
accumbens), such that higher levels were associated with lower
D2R availability presumably from increased dopamine release and
receptor occupancy [41]. Because of the multiple factors that
modulate the activity of dopamine neurons, it is remarkable that
ghrelin exerts such a strong stimulatory influence on alcohol
reward as evidenced by the lack of alcohol-induced dopamine
increases in ghrelin knock-out mice [70]. Our finding that RYGB
rats were more sensitive to D-[Lys3]-GHRP-6 in reducing their
alcohol intake compared to controls suggests improvement in
ghrelin signaling after the surgery. Irrespective of whether such
improvements affect peripheral or central ghrelin signaling or
both, it may also influence the neuronal and hormonal signals
upstream of the reward system. Should this effect (i.e. increased
alcohol reward) rely on the dopamine system, then it may be that
RYGB can improve the sensitivity of the dopamine system, which
is believed to be blunted in obesity [71,72,73]. In fact, gastric
bypass has been shown to increase the expression of dopamine D2
receptors in the ventral striatum and caudate nucleus, although the
reports are still mixed [74]. As the ventral striatum is believed to
be involved in modulating alcohol’s rewarding effects, such
changes could be especially impactful on alcohol intake and abuse
potential [30].
In summary, we show that RYGB rats increased alcohol reward
and consumption of low EtOH concentrations compared to their
dietary obese controls, which supports the clinical findings that
bariatric surgery is associated with an increased risk for alcohol
abuse. We also found that changes in the responsiveness of the
ghrelin system may be partly involved in the modulation of alcohol
intake following RYGB, although further studies are needed to
determine the precise role of ghrelin on these responses.
