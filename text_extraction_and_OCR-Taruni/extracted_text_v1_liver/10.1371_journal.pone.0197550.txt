Abstract
Purpose
The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the
utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients
before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.
Materials and methods
A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic
liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months
after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.
Result
Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ±
5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively.
Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased
(P < 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness
measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of
correlation r = 0.701 (P < 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement
did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively,
while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after

angioplasty was significantly decreased (P < 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though
still in the cirrhotic range.
Conclusions
The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis. Shear wave
elastography may be effective in monitoring short- and long-term treatment outcomes in
Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Introduction
Elastography uses ultrasound to estimate the stiffness of a material when a mechanical stress is
applied. Shear wave elastography (quantitative elastography), such as transient elastography
(TE), real-time shear wave elastography (SWE), and point shear-wave elastography (pSWE), is
a noninvasive methodology that has been used to monitor liver stiffness in patients with
chronic viral hepatitis [1–3]. Transient elastography (Fibroscan; Echosense, Paris, France) is
the earliest and the most validated elastography imaging technique for liver stiffness [4]. The
European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines for patients with chronic
hepatitis B and C [4,5] recommend TE as an alternative to liver biopsy to assess liver stiffness
owing to its accuracy, non-invasiveness and easy acceptance among patients. However, it is
impossible to obtain results from patients with ascites, and its use with a one-dimensional
ultrasound system has certain limitations [5].
SWE is the most recently developed technique [6]. Like TE, SWE calculates the speed of a
shear wave to provide a quantitative estimate of tissue stiffness. Unlike TE, SWE makes breakthroughs in the following aspects [7]: the equipment is incorporated into the ultrasound system with the use of an ultrafast, ultrasonic scanner and the final display includes both colorcoded images and numeric values. It can also be used in the presence of ascites. Studies of the
use of SWE in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and correlations between liver stiffness and
fibrosis [8,9] have suggested a stronger and more accurate correlation between LSM and fibrosis with SWE compared with TE [10,11].
However, recent studies have found that LSM is not only affected by the fibrosis stage but
also by other confounding factors, such as the levels of aminotransferases [12,13], extrahepatic
cholestasis [14], food intake [15–17], breath holding [18], and intake of beta-blockers [19]. In
addition, previous studies have found that hepatic congestion can lead to an increase in LSM
[20–22], but patients’ hepatic venous pressures were not measured, and the relationships
among LSM, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis were not analyzed.
We collected Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) patients who have undergone balloon angioplasty. BCS is defined as any level of hepatic venous outflow obstruction from the junction of
small vein to the inferior vena cava and the right atrium, regardless of the cause of obstruction
[23]. This leads to an increase in hepatic vein pressure, and, if prolonged, it will result in fibrosis [23]. For patients with short-segment stenosis, balloon angioplasty with or without stenting
is considered ideal to restore venous outflow in the stenotic hepatic vein or inferior vena cava
(IVC) [24, 25]. Hepatic venous pressure (cmH2O) can be measured during balloon angioplasty, and a decline in hepatic venous pressure is considered to be reliable sign of successful
vessel dilatation [23].

Therefore, the first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships among LSM, hepatic
venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to evaluate the usefulness of SWE for
evaluation of patients with BCS before and after balloon angioplasty.
Materials and methods
Ethical statement
This prospective single-institution study was performed in strict accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital. All study participants provided written
informed consent.
Patients
Between October 2013 and May 2015, patients with primary BCS who were scheduled to undergo balloon angioplasty and liver biopsy in the Department of Interventional Radiology in
Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital were prospectively considered for this study.
Inclusion criteria were incomplete obstruction of a hepatic vein or retrohepatic segment of the
IVC. These patients were candidates for balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The exclusion criteria were: liver biopsy specimens with a length < 1.5 cm and/or including < 6 complete
portal triads, hepatic space-occupying lesion measuring > 3cm, portal vein thrombosis, congestive heart failure, biliary tract obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis, and other diseases that affect
hepatic sinusoidal pressure.
Liver histological analysis
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy was performed using 16-gauge Magnum needles
(Bard, Covington CA, USA) in the right anterior lower lobe (S5) or right posterior lower lobe
(S6) of the liver (according to the Couinaud system of liver segmentation) [26]. The interval
between liver biopsy and balloon angioplasty was < 14 days. As stated above, only liver specimens with a length  1.5cm and including at least six complete portal triads were considered
adequate for the study [27].
The specimens were fixed in formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The specimens were
reviewed using the Metavir scoring system [28] by two pathologists who were blinded to the
results and had 12 and 15 years of experiences, respectively. Fibrosis was staged as follows: F0,
no fibrosis; F1, portal fibrosis without septa; F2, portal fibrosis and few septa; F3, numerous
septa without cirrhosis; and F4, cirrhosis. When there was a divergence of opinions, the higher
level of fibrosis stage was adopted.
SWE
SWE was performed 2 days before angioplasty, and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after
angioplasty. Two radiologists (H. W. and J. C.) performed the procedures independently. Both
two radiologists had at least 7 years of experience in ultrasound examination of the liver and at
least 2 months of experience in SWE. They were blinded to the baseline data and biopsy results
of the patients.
An ultrasound system (Aixplorer, SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) was used
for SWE with a convex probe (SC6-1, 1–6 MHz). Liver stiffness was expressed as Young’s
modulus according to the formula E = 3ρC2
, where E is Young’s modulus (kPa), ρ is tissue
density (kg/m3
); and C is shear wave velocity (m/s). The tissue density was assumed to be 1000
kg/m3 with the ultrasound system [7].

All patients fasted for at least 8h before SWE. The right arm was placed in maximum abduction to enlarge the space between the ribs. An intercostal space was located in the right anterior
lower lobe (S5) or right posterior lower lobe of the liver (S6) (according to the Couinaud system of liver segmentation) and 1.5–3 cm below the liver capsule. A 4cm×3cm SWE box was
used to define a 2 cm-diameter circular region of interest (ROI), known as the “Q-box”. The
mean, maximal and minimal values of Young’s modulus within the Q- box were measured
during a breath hold. Five measurements were performed for each patient with the mean calculated and used for analysis. The Q-box was placed away from the hepatic blood vessels and
gall bladder. If the box was not filled completely with color, the measurement was considered a
failed measurement, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Interventional treatment
All patients underwent balloon angioplasty with or without stenting 2 days after satisfactory
SWE using the following procedures: modified Seldinger technique was used for puncture of
the right femoral vein or the right jugular vein, followed by angiography of the IVC and
hepatic vein to locate the site and extent of obstruction. Then the occluded segment(s) were
expanded with balloon catheters (Cook Medical, Inc., Winston-Salem NC, USA) to diameters
up to 25mm. Hepatic venous pressure (cmH2O) was measured during and after angioplasty
using a manometer.
Repeat angiography was performed after angioplasty, and unobstructed blood flow was
considered a successful angioplasty result. All patients underwent conventional ultrasound
examination and SWE at 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. If a recurrence was
suspected, venography was conducted for confirmation.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software (IBM SPSS, version 22.0; IBM,
Armonk NY, USA). Patient characteristics are reported as mean ± standard deviations. Shapiro–Wilk testing was conducted on all the data. Repeated measures of ANOVA were conducted for liver stiffness at each time point before angioplasty, and 2 days, 3 and 6 months
following angioplasty. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences in preprocedure
LSMs and pressure values among the different METAVIR fibrosis stages. Least-significant-difference (LSD) post-hoc analysis was employed for pairwise comparison. The LSM of two cases
that failed angioplasty before and after surgery was compared using a t-test. The correlation
between SWE measurements and venous pressure was analyzed by Pearson correlation. SWE
measurements and biopsy results were compared by Spearman correlation. The correlation
between preprocedure and postprocedure LSM differences and fibrosis severity was analyzed
using the Spearman correlation. P < 0.05 indicated a significant difference.
Results
Baseline data
Thirty-seven patients were eligible during the recruitment period (Fig 1). Five patients met the
exclusion criteria, including two patients with biopsy samples < 1.5 cm long or with < six portal areas under the microscope, one with unsatisfactory SWE images and detection data, and
two patients with failure of balloon angioplasty due to length of stenosis. Thus, the final cohort
consisted of 32 patients. Shapiro–Wilk testing found that LSM and pressure values conformed
to a normal distribution but that fibrosis stages and the elasticity difference before and after
angioplasty did not. The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

LSM
Thirty-two patients underwent successful balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. LSM
after angioplasty decreased significantly (Fig 2A and 2B), with liver stiffness of 35.17 ± 10.60
kPa at 2 d before angioplasty and 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa 2 d after angioplasty (P < 0.001). The mean
liver stiffness at 3 months after angioplasty was 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa showing a marked further

decrease compared with the measurement at 2d after angioplasty (P < 0.001). The liver stiffness at 6 months after angioplasty was stable at 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa, with no significant differences
with the measurement at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636) (Fig 3).
Balloon angioplasty failed in two patients as a result of long-segment stenosis, with LSM of
52.21 kPa, 37.14 kPa before angioplasty and 50.09 kPa, 38.67 kPa after angioplasty, respectively
(Fig 3).
Recurrence was detected on angiography in one patient at 6 months after angioplasty. The
LSM had been approximately 40.12 kPa at 2d before angioplasty, 14.57 kPa at 2d after angioplasty, 15.14 kPa at 3 months after angioplasty and 33.32 kPa at 6 months after angioplasty.
Since the patient was intolerant of warfarin anticoagulation, conservative treatment was
administered instead of a second balloon angioplasty.

before angioplasty was 27.18 ± 8.47 cm H2O, and that immediately after angioplasty was

venous pressure before angioplasty was r = 0.701, (P < 0.001) (Fig 4).
Correlation between LSM and liver fibrosis
Before angioplasty, LSM did not correlated with the degree of fibrosis in the histologic specimens (r = −0.170, P = 0.22). Two days after surgery, LSM still did not correlated with the degree
of fibrosis (r = 0.223, P = 0.220). There was no significant difference in hepatic venous pressures
among the different fibrosis stages before angioplasty (F = 1.536, P = 0.227); there was no significant difference in LSM among different fibrosis stages before angioplasty (F = 0.400, P = 0.754).
After successful balloon angioplasty, there was no significant difference in hepatic venous pressure among the different fibrosis stages (F = 0.400, P = 0.754); there was no significant difference
in LSM among the different fibrosis stages (F = 0.915, P = 0.446). However, LSM difference
before and 2 d after angioplasty was negatively correlated with fibrosis (r = −0.502, P = 0.003).
Discussion
In this study we assessed liver stiffness before and after balloon angioplasty in 32 patients with
BCS using SWE. Preprocedure mean LSM was obviously increased above the cut-off value of
10.4 kPa [29, 30] above which is generally considered to reflect F4 fibrosis (liver cirrhosis) in
these patients (35.17 ± 10.60 kPa), with one case reaching 67.10 kPa. In patients with congestive
heart failure, reversal of cardiac decompensation leading to a significant decrease of the initially
increased LSM has been reported [22], but patients’ hepatic venous pressures were not measured, and the relationships between LSM, hepatic venous pressure, and liver fibrosis were not

analyzed. We looked at BCS, which causes serious liver congestion, and we found that LSM correlated with hepatic venous pressure (r = 0.701, P < 0.001) rather than with the degree of fibrosis in BCS patients. We speculated that the rise in hepatic sinus tension accompanying
congestion and the rise in the viscous elasticity of hepatic tissue resulting in an elevated elastic
modulus may explain the increased LSM in BCS patients, but this remains to be investigated.
Because fibrosis does not change over a short period of time, the correlation between liver
fibrosis revealed by biopsy and LSM before angioplasty and LSM at 2 d after surgery was investigated. We found LSM did not correlated with fibrosis (r = −0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223,
P = 0.220) before and 2 d after angioplasty, respectively. Our findings do not reproduce previous results suggesting that LSM positively correlates with the degree of fibrosis [9, 29]. The reason may be that LSM is more affected by hepatic venous pressure.
Nevertheless, the difference in elasticity 2 d before and 2 d after angioplasty was negatively
correlated with the degree of fibrosis (r = −0.502, P = 0.003). Thus the more severe the fibrosis,

the smaller the change in liver stiffness after recanalization will be. This is probably because
severe fibrosis causes compression and obstruction of the intrahepatic vein and the portal vein
still maintains a high pressure even after recanalization. Moreover, at 2 d after recanalization
with balloon angioplasty, although the LSM after successful recanalization decreased significantly (20.15 ± 5.47 kPa), it remained far above the cut-off value for liver cirrhosis. One patient
showed an obvious increase in liver stiffness during reexamination with SWE 6 months after
angioplasty. This patient was diagnosed as having had a recurrence of thrombosis according to
the ultrasound. Therefore, SWE may be a method for monitoring the recurrence of BCS patients
after angioplasty. Color Doppler ultrasound is less satisfactory in detecting the recurrence of
obstruction in BCS patients [31], while LSM can detect it based on its effect on liver stiffness.
The evaluation of the effectiveness of BCS treatment is generally based on symptoms, which
inevitably introduces subjective factors and errors [32]. Although Doppler ultrasound has
unique advantages as a preferred test for BCS, it has certain technical limitations when used in
follow-up examination. Doppler ultrasound may be affected by imaging depth and angle; it
has less value in patients with porous and/or membranous lesions of the IVC, and is operatordependent [31]. Moreover, for lesions with less significant hemodynamic changes, Doppler
ultrasound lacks sensitivity in evaluating short- and long-term outcomes after therapy [31].
We discovered that, though unrelated to the degree of liver fibrosis, LSM is highly sensitive to
the changes in hepatic venous pressure. Therefore, efficacy of treatment based on SWE can not
only improve the outcome evaluation, but also reduce invasiveness.
We are aware of the limitations of our pilot study. First, different in obstruction sites were
present among the recruited BCS patients. Despite these differences, liver stiffness was measured uniformly in the right lobe. It was uncertain whether the change in hepatic venous pressure would be uniform for different sites of obstruction. To control for potential differences,
LSM was performed at the same site for all patients and IVC was the site of recanalization in
most patients (26/32). Among the remaining six patients, four had obvious intrahepatic collateral circulation, so we believe that the site of obstruction was less likely to affect the experimental result. Second, the small sample size is also a limitation. And, there was only one recurrent
case. The value of SWE in monitoring BCS recurrence remains to be investigated.
In conclusion, liver stiffness in BCS patients, measured by SWE, decreased considerably
after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure
though not with degree of fibrosis. SWE may be effective in monitoring short- and long-term
treatment outcomes of BCS.
