* Donor characteristics accounted for in reallocation schemes included donor gender, race/ethnicity, 
cause of death, share type, split vs whole organ, DDCD status and diabetes status 
†Reallocation scheme #1: in recipients <40 years, all donors ≥60 years (N=444) are replaced by donors 
<40 years; in recipients ≥60 years, 444 donors <40 years are replaced by donors ≥60 years 
‡Reallocation scheme #2: in recipients <40 years, all donors 40-59 (N=1,585) and ≥60 years (N=444) are
replaced by donors <40 years; in recipients ≥60 years, 444 donors <40 years are replaced by donors ≥60 
years and 1,585 donors <40 years are replaced by donors 40-59 years
