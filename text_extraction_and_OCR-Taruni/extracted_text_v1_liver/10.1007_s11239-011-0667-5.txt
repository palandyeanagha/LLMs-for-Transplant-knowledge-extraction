Introduction
Platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation play a pivotal
role in atherothrombosis. Intracoronary atherothrombosis is
the most common cause of the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and plays a central role in complications occurring around percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) including recurrent ACS, procedurerelated myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis [1].
Inhibition of platelet aggregation by medical treatment
impairs formation and progression of thrombotic processes
and is therefore of great importance in the prevention of
complications after an ACS or around PCI [2, 3]. Platelet
inhibitors include thromboxane inhibitors (aspirin); adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists (or P2Y12
inhibitors) such as the thienopyridines (clopidogrel and
prasugrel) and the nonthienopyridines (elinogrel, ticagrelor
and cangrelor); the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; and
medication working through other pathways and include
dipyridamole, cilostazol, protease-activated receptor
antagonists and the platelet adhesion antagonists [4].
The platelet inhibitor of choice, the optimal time of
initiation and the duration of treatment depend on the
indication for therapy and patient characteristics. In recent
years, bleeding has been identified as an important risk
factor for adverse outcomes and has led to a renewed
emphasis on individual bleeding risk in choosing appropriate therapy [5]. Current European treatment guidelines
recommend dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and
clopidogrel for patients with ACS and patients who
undergo PCI with stent placement [2]. The efficacy of this

combination in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina has
been shown in multiple large clinical trials [6–8]. Despite
the efficacy of the aforementioned combination, there are
important pharmacological limitations associated with
clopidogrel use. Newly developed P2Y12 inhibitors such
as prasugrel, ticagrelor and cangrelor, are more potent and
have a faster onset of action than clopidogrel. The objectives of this review are to discuss the limitations of clopidogrel, and describe alternative P2Y12 inhibitors and the
clinical implications of the introduction of these new
medicines.
Pharmacology of P2Y12 inhibitors
An essential part in the platelet activation process is the
interaction of ADP with the platelet P2Y12 receptor [9].
The P2Y12 receptor is the predominant receptor involved
in the ADP-stimulated activation of the glycoprotein IIb/
IIIa receptor [10]. Activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
receptor results in enhanced platelet degranulation and
thromboxane production, and prolonged platelet aggregation [11]. Thienopyridines inhibit the platelet activation
and aggregation by antagonizing the platelet P2Y12
receptor. This prevents the binding of ADP to the receptor
which attenuates platelet aggregation and reaction of
platelets to stimuli of thrombus aggregation such as
thrombin [4].
Pharmacological limitations of clopidogrel
Despite proven clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in patients
with an ACS or after PCI, either as monotherapy or in
combination with aspirin, pharmacological limitations of
clopidogrel prevent this medication from always being
fully effective [12]. Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires a
2-step hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the
platelet P2Y12 receptor [13]. Before intestinal absorption,
85% of the pro-drug is hydrolyzed by esterases to an
inactive carboxylic acid derivate. Because of these pharmacodynamic characteristics of clopidogrel, several hours
pass between ingestion and reaching therapeutic levels.
This results in suboptimal platelet aggregation inhibition
during acute PCI for ACS and a higher risk for acute stent
thrombosis. Moreover, the longer period up to therapeutic
levels may raise the bleeding risk during acute coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG) if necessary based on coronary anatomy. Second, there is a substantial variability in
clopidogrel response between patients. Accumulating evidence shows that a suboptimal response to clopidogrel is
associated with worse clinical outcomes such as coronary
ischemia or stent thrombosis [14–17]. This suboptimal
therapeutic response is a consequence of the variation in
the CYP gene [18]. This gene codes for the CYP-450
enzymes involved in the biotransformation of the prodrug
clopidopgrel to the active metabolite. Particularly polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 allele are associated with a
reduced activity of clopidogrel. Three large studies have
shown that clopidogrel users who are carrier of the loss-offunction CYP2C19 allele endure more ischemic events
compared with patients without this mutation, with the
genetic substudy of the PLATO (Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial showing that these were
mainly early events (within 30 days) [19–21]. Treatment
strategies tailored to the heterogeneity in clopidogrel
response were investigated in the GRAVITAS (Gauging
Responsiveness with A VerifyNow Assay—Impact on
Thrombosis and Safety) trial [22]. This trial analyzed
whether tailored platelet aggregation inhibition on the basis
of platelet function testing using a point-of-care assay
(VerifyNow, Accumetrics Inc, San Diego, CA, USA)
improved cardiovascular outcomes after drug-eluting stent
placement during urgent or elective PCI. However, in
patients with a high residual platelet activity, a higher
clopidogrel dosing (loading dosis 600 mg post-PCI, followed by 150 mg daily) did not reduce the incidence of
ischemic outcomes compared with a lower clopidogrel
dosing (loading doses 150 mg post-PCI, followed by
75 mg daily). In order to overcome the described limitations of clopidogrel, alternative antiplatelet treatments have
been developed.
Pharmacology of prasugrel
Prasugrel is a third generation thienopyridine. Rapidly after
ingestion, prasugrel is hydrolyzed in the gastro-intestinal
system into an intermediary metabolite. This intermediary
metabolite is hepatically activated in a single-step and
forms an active metabolite that binds to the P2Y12 receptor
on the platelet. This irreversible bond with the receptor
inhibits activation and aggregation of the platelet [18]. The
peak concentration of the active metabolite of prasugrel is
reached after 30 min, and the final concentration is linearly
dependent on the prasugrel dose which varies between 5
and 60 mg. If not bound to the receptor, active metabolites
have a half life of approximately 7 h [18]. A maximum of
60–70% platelet inhibition is usually achieved within
2–4 h [11]. There are important differences in the metabolic process between prasugrel and clopidogrel. First, with
the initial hydrolization of clopidogrel, a substantial fraction is inactivated. Second, the activation of clopidogrel
involves two CYP dependent steps, in contrast to a single
CYP-dependent step with prasugrel [23]. This results in a
144 P. Damman et al.
123

more rapid and consistent activation of prasugrel, with
more receptor blocking active metabolite [24]. Third,
genetic CYP variants do not have a significant influence on
the active metabolites of prasugrel, subsequent platelet
aggregation and clinical outcomes [25].
As a consequence, more effective platelet aggregation is
achieved with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel both
after the loading dose and with maintenance dose, as shown
by research in patients with stable coronary disease [25]
and elective PCI [26].
Pharmacology of the direct-acting P2Y12 inhibitors
ticagrelor and cangrelor
Ticagrelor is a compound that directly and reversibly binds
to and inhibits the P2Y12 receptor at a site distinct from the
ADP binding site [11]. The compound is orally active
without the requirement of metabolic activation [27]. It
undergoes enzymatic degradation to at least one active
metabolite which is approximately as potent as its parent
compound [27]. The maximum plasma concentration and
maximum platelet inhibition is reached 1–3 h after treatment, and the plasma half-life is 6–13 h [11]. In patients
with ACS, ticagrelor exhibited greater inhibition of platelet
aggregation than a standard regimen of clopidogrel [28].
Moreover, CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genotypes, known to
influence the effects of clopidogrel, did not influence the
effect on ischemic outcomes in ACS patients [20].
Much like to ticagrelor, the intravenous agent cangrelor
directly and reversibly antagonizes ADP binding to the
P2Y12 receptor. Cangrelor rapidly reaches steady state
plasma levels and platelet aggregation inhibition within
30 min of onset of infusion without the need for a bolus
dose, and the plasma half-life is short, being approximately
less than 9 min [29]. Maximal platelet inhibition is
achieved within 15 min. In patients with ischemic heart
disease a substantially greater P2Y12 receptor blockade
was achieved with cangrelor compared with clopidogrel
[30].
Clinical trials
Prasugrel
The more effective platelet inhibition with the new P2Y12
inhibitors potentially results in a reduction of ischemic
events and, the downside, more bleeding events. The safety
and antiplatelet effects of prasugrel were investigated in
two phase II studies, the JUMBO-TIMI 26 [31] and the
PRINCIPLE-TIMI 44 [26]. The JUMBO-TIMI (Joint
Utilization of Medications to Block Platelets Optimally—
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 26 was a
dose-ranging safety trial comparing different prasugrel
doses with clopidogrel (loading dose 300 mg, maintenance
dose 75 mg) in patients undergoing PCI [31]. At 30 days
after PCI, no statistical difference was observed in nonCABG-related (TIMI major plus minor) bleeding events
when comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel. However,
bleeding events were numerically higher with prasugrel
use. Access site bleeding occurred most frequently.
Importantly, because of evidence available at the time of
enrolment in JUMBO-TIMI 26, there was an increased use
of higher-than-approved doses of clopidogrel (loading dose
600 mg) in clinical practice. In the second phase II study
involving prasugrel, the PRINCIPLE-TIMI (Prasugrel in
Comparison to Clopidogrel for Inhibition of Platelet Activation and Aggregation—TIMI) 44, a 60 mg prasugrel
dose was compared with a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel [26]. Among patients planned for PCI, loading with
60 mg prasugrel resulted in greater platelet inhibition than
a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose. Daily maintenance
therapy with prasugrel 10 mg resulted in a greater antiplatelet effect than 150 mg daily clopidogrel.
As in the previous investigation, numerically higher
bleeding was observed with prasugrel, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The overall
positive results from the JUMBO-TIMI 26 trial resulted in
a large phase III efficacy and safety trial, the TRITONTIMI (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic
Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with
Prasugrel—TIMI) 38 [32]. In this trial, 13,608 patients
with moderate and high-risk ACS were randomized to
prasugrel (60 mg loading dose and 10 mg daily maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and
75 mg daily maintenance dose) for 6–15 months (median
14.5 months). Randomization took place after coronary
angiography and before PCI. The main efficacy endpoint
was cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke.
Major bleeding (definition: TIMI major bleeding not related to CABG), was included as the key safety endpoint.
The use of prasugrel was associated with a significant
reduction of the main efficacy endpoint, with an event rate
of 12.1% in the clopidogrel group versus 9.9% in the
prasugrel group (P\0.001). This was mainly driven by a
reduction in MI and stent thrombosis, no difference was
observed in mortality. However, the reduction in ischemic
endpoints with prasugrel was accompanied by a higher
incidence of TIMI defined major bleeding, occurring in
1.8% of the patients in the clopidogrel group versus 2.4%
in the prasugrel group. This translates into a risk of three
extra major bleeds per 1,000 patients with prasugrel use,
keeping in mind that patients at high risk for bleeding were
excluded. As a consequence the bleeding risk with prasugrel could be potentially higher in clinical practice,
although the same is true for the benefits [33]. This balance
P2Y12 platelet inhibition 145
123

has received increasing attention as many of the established
risk factors for ischemic events are also suggestive of
higher bleeding risk [34]. Especially noteworthy in this
regard are the higher incidence of fatal and CABG-related
bleeding observed with prasugrel. In an exploratory analysis, three subgroups of interest were identified that had
less clinical efficacy and greater absolute levels of bleeding
than the overall cohort, resulting in less net clinical benefit
or in clinical harm. These included patients with a history
of stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients aged
75 years and older, and patients with a body weight of less
than 60 kg. Subanalyses from the TRITON-TIMI 38 are
summarized in Table 1.
Ticagrelor
The safety, tolerability and efficacy of ticagrelor were
investigated in the DISPERSE-2 (Dose confirmation study
assessing anti-platelet effects of AZD6140 vs. clopidogRel
in non-ST-segment Elevation myocardial infarction) phase
II trial [35]. In this trial patients with a NSTE-ACS were
randomized to receive ticagrelor 90 or 180 mg twice a day,
or clopidogrel 75 mg once a day for up to 12 weeks. At
4-week follow-up, no difference was observed in major
bleeding although an increase in minor bleeding was
observed at the higher ticagrelor dose. On the other side,
encouraging results were observed on the secondary end
point of MI. Both doses of ticagrelor achieved a greater
mean inhibition of platelet aggregation than clopidogrel in
the ACS patients [28]. Ticagrelor was compared with
clopidogrel in 18,624 patients with ACS in the multicenter
randomized PLATO (Study of Platelet Inhibition and
Patient Outcomes) [36]. Patients on maintenance treatment
or who had received loading doses of clopidogrel were
accepted. After randomization, the patients received
ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily
thereafter) or clopidogrel (300–600 mg loading dose,
75 mg daily thereafter). Patient randomization took place
as early as possible after the index event. The main outcome at 12-month follow-up was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke which occurred in 9.8% of
patients receiving ticagrelor as compared with 11.7% of
those receiving clopidogrel (P\0.001). This significantly
lower event rate was driven by lower cardiovascular mortality, MI and stent thrombosis rates. The mortality benefit
(4.5% with ticagrelor vs. 5.9% with clopidogrel) contrasts
with the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, were no differences in
mortality were observed. Mechanisms for the reduction in
mortality potentially include the favourable balance
between the atherothrombotic effect and bleeding risk due
to the faster speed of action or the higher potency of
platelet inhibition with ticagrelor, or mechanisms beyond
pure P2Y12 receptor inhibition [37]. It might be directly
related to the metabolism of adenosine. In addition to
causing reversible platelet inhibition, adenosine is involved
in numerous biological activities including cardioprotection from reperfusion injury, apoptosis, myocyte regeneration, improved myocardial contractility, and electrical
stability. Another explanation might be the small difference in bleeding. Major bleeding, according to the PLATO
study definition, occurred in 11.6% of the patients in the
clopidogrel group versus 11.2% in the ticagrelor group (2.2
vs. 2.8 if the TIMI non-CABG-related major bleeding
definition is used). In contrast to the use of prasugrel in
TRITON-TIMI 38, there was no increased risk of
CABG-related bleeding with ticagrelor. Comparable with
prasugrel, non-procedure-related bleeding, including gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding, were numerically
higher with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel, although not
statistically significant different. The prevention of ischemic events with ticagrelor is achieved by a greater antiplatelet effect in the first hours of treatment and during
maintenance therapy [38]. Notably, ticagrelor was associated with dyspnea resulting discontinuation in 0.9% of the
patients. Finally, ventricular pauses were observed more
frequently in the ticagrelor group. In 3,000 patients with
available continuous ECG monitoring, these were predominantly asymptomatic pauses, sinoatrial nodal in origin, and nocturnal that occurred most frequently in the
acute phase of the index ACS. There were no clinical
consequences related to the excess of these ventricular
pauses in patients assigned to ticagrelor [39]. Subanalyses
from the PLATO trial are summarized in Table 1.
Cangrelor
The comparison between cangrelor and clopidogrel have
been described in the large phase III CHAMPION
(Cangrelor versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal
Management of Platelet Inhibition) PCI and CHAMPION
PLATFORM trials [40, 41]. The major difference between
the two trials was the timing of the administration of the
study drugs. In the CHAMPION PCI trial, cangrelor or
clopidogrel (600 mg) was started within 30 min before
PCI. In the CHAMPION PLATFORM trial, cangrelor was
started at the beginning of PCI, while clopidogrel (600 mg)
was administered at the end of PCI. In the 8,877 patients
enrolled in CHAMPION PCI and 2655 enrolled in
CHAMPION PLATFORM, no reduction in ischemic outcomes was observed at 48 h when comparing cangrelor
with clopidogrel. In CHAMPION PLATFORM, cangrelor
use was associated with reductions in the prespecified
secondary outcomes stent thrombosis and death. Similar to
the observation in PLATO, transient dyspnea occurred
more often with cangrelor use.

Clinical practice
The choice of drug, initiation, and duration of P2Y12
inhibition depend on the clinical setting (urgent or elective
intervention) and patient-related factors such as the ischemic risk, bleeding risk and other baseline clinical characteristics. The levels of recommendation regarding P2Y12
inhibition are according to the European Society of Cardiology 2010 guidelines on myocardial revascularization.
STEMI
The preferred treatment for patients with STEMI is
mechanical reperfusion by primary PCI. Thus fast acting
P2Y12 inhibitors are of paramount importance in these
high-risk patients who require urgent intervention. In
STEMI patients, prasugrel (60 mg loading dose, followed
by 10 mg daily) or ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily) are recommended as P2Y12
inhibitors (both class I, level B). Both agents have been
shown to reduce ischemic outcomes in STEMI patients,
without increasing the bleeding risk significantly [42, 43].
Clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg
daily) should be used primarily if the more effective
ADP receptor blockers are contraindicated or unavailable
(class I, level C).
NSTE-ACS
The choice of P2Y12 inhibition in patients presenting with
NSTE-ACS depends on the chosen treatment strategy.
Presently, there are three trials with long-term follow-up
after a routine or selective invasive management in these
patients [44–46]. Based on these clinical trial results and a
large patient-pooled meta-analysis, current guidelines recommend a routine invasive strategy, consisting of routine
coronary angiography and PCI if suitable, in high-risk
NSTE-ACS patients [2, 47].
High risk of ischemic heart disease is associated with
ST-segment changes, elevated troponin, diabetes, and a
GRACE risk score of more than 140. ACS patients
undergoing a routine invasive management have been
analyzed in subgroup analyses from PLATO and TRITONTIMI 38. In PLATO, NSTE-ACS patients comprised
around 50% of the ACS population, while around 75%
were NSTE-ACS patients in TRITON-TIMI 38 [26, 48].
Compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel reduced
ischemic outcomes in these patients. For prasugrel and ticagrelor, there is respectively a class IIa, level B and class
I, level B recommendation. However, in patients with a
history of stroke and TIA, or prasugrel is contraindicated
and in patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg, and
patients aged C75 years, prasugrel should be used with
caution with a 5 mg dose because of an increased bleeding
risk. Prasugrel should also be avoided in patients referred
for CABG. If prasugrel is used, it should be administered
after coronary angiography.
Patients triaged to the selective invasive strategy
undergo coronary angiography only in case of hemodynamic or electrical instability, or a positive ischemia
detection test. With the latest trials focusing mainly on
patients undergoing invasive management, less data is
available on conservatively managed patients. However a
substudy from PLATO in ACS patients intended for noninvasive management showed that the benefits of ticagrelor
over clopidogrel are consistent, and with a greater absolute
benefit with those from the overall PLATO results [49].
This indicates that ticagrelor can be recommended unless
there are contra-indications to this agent.
Regardless of the intended treatment strategy in NSTEACS, a large proportion of the patients do not undergo
revascularization during initial hospitalization. Because the
optimal approach to antiplatelet therapy for high-risk,
medically managed NSTE-ACS patients remains uncertain,
the TaRgeted platelet Inhibition to cLarify the Optimal
strateGy to medicallY manage Acute Coronary Syndromes
(TRILOGY ACS) trial currently enrols medically managed
NSTE-ACS patients who are randomized to prasugrel and
aspirin versus clopidogrel and aspirin for a median duration
of 18 months [50]. Regarding ticagrelor, the abovementioned PLATO substudy in ACS patients intended for a
non-invasive management showed a consistent benefit of
ticagrelor regardless of revascularization.
Elective PCI
After diagnostic coronary angiography, the majority of PCI
procedures ultimately result in stent placement. The current
European guidelines for myocardial revascularization recommend a clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg administered at least 6 h before the procedure (class I, level c) [2].
A 600 mg loading dose may be preferred if given within
6 hours. If no intervention is planned after coronary angiography, clopidogrel can be stopped. In patients with a
high thrombotic risk (diabetics, patients after recurrent MI,
after stent thrombosis, complex lesions such as left main
stenting, or in life threatening situations should an occlusion occur) or patients with a high on treatment platelet
reactivity, clopidogrel might not optimally protect against
thrombotic complications. However, the role of currently
available platelet reactivity assays are unclear as the predictive accuracy of platelet function tests for ischemic
outcomes is only modest [51]. This point was made clear in
the aforementioned GRAVITAS trial, showing a higher
clopidogrel dosing in patients with a high residual platelet
activity did not reduce ischemic outcomes. In addition, the
P2Y12 platelet inhibition 149

Testing Platelet Reactivity In Patients Undergoing Elective
Stent Placement on Clopidogrel to Guide Alternative
Therapy With Prasugrel (TRIGGER-PCI) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00910299) was recently terminated because of low event (6 month cardiovascular death
or MI) rates. Although these trials question the use of
routine platelet testing in elective PCI, it must first be
mentioned that it has been shown that the predictive
accuracy of platelet function tests for ischemic outcomes is
only modest. Moreover, no test is able to identify patients
at high risk for bleeding. Second, no data is available in the
abovementioned patients at high risk for ischemic events,
including comparisons between prasugrel and ticagrelor
with clopidogrel. Third, although genotyping might assist
in identifying patients with a low response to clopidogrel,
CYP2C19 polymorphisms explain around 5.2% of the
antiplatelet response [52]. No data is currently available
regarding ticagrelor, prasugrel, or a high dose clopidogrel
after platelet function testing in patients at high risk for
ischemic events.
Other clinical considerations in the choice of P2Y12
inhibition
Diabetic patients, especially those with an ACS, are at a
high risk for (recurrent) ischemic events. This can partly be
attributed to increased platelet reactivity [53]. Substudies
of PLATO and TRITON-TIMI 38 in diabetic patients
confirmed this higher risk in diabetic patients. Ticagrelor
reduced ischemic outcomes in ACS patients, irrespective of
the diabetic status, when compared to clopidogrel but
numerically more in patients with poor metabolic control
(HbA1c [6%) [54]. Total major bleeding events were
similar, but non-CABG related major bleeding events were
numerically more frequent with ticagrelor. When comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel in diabetic patients, a lower
number of ischemic and similar bleeding events were
observed [55]. Possible explanations for the similar
bleeding rates remain speculative, but have been ascribe by
investigators as possibly due to higher body weight or
greater baseline platelet reactivity among diabetics, or
simply the play of chance. The latter explanation is supported by the similar relative increase in the combination
of major or minor bleeding among diabetics and nondiabetics and the higher major bleeding rate among diabetics
compared with nondiabetics on clopidogrel. These findings
were not expected if related to platelet reactivity only.
Moreover, there was no significant interaction regarding
the main outcome.
A high risk subgroup for bleeding events, often excluded
from major clinical trials, are patients with an impaired
renal function. The extent of renal dysfunction is related to
cardiovascular outcomes, as illustrated in patients with
renal dysfunction who presented with a MI [56]. Importantly, the initial dose of an antithrombotic drug does not
add to the risk of bleeding in cases of renal dysfunction [2].
In contrast, repeated dosing results in accumulation of
drugs and its associated increased bleeding risk. Dose
reductions could potentially mitigate the accumulation of
drugs. However, in patients with a glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) of 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m2
, no information is available about dose reductions for prasugrel. Moreover,
prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with severe renal
dysfunction (GFR of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
).
Regarding clopidogrel, no information is available about
dose reductions in patients with renal dysfunction. Finally,
for ticagrelor no reduction is required in patients with a
GFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and the benefit was
sustained and in fact numerically enhanced in this high risk
subset of patients [57].
Ticagrelor is dosed twice daily which requires good
adherence to medical therapy to ensure a reduction in risk
of ischemic events, although this might also be true for the
other medication required once daily. Treatment with any
of the more potent P2Y12 inhibitors results in higher risk
for spontaneous bleeding events, accumulating over time
which should be considered in frail patients.
In patients with ACS, in which an invasive management
is planned, the presence of shock, vomiting or sedation
might prevent oral intake of P2Y12 inhibitors. In these
patients, intravenous cangrelor might prove to be an
alternative for the oral agents. However, cangrelor is currently not approved for clinical practice.
Conclusions and remaining questions
New P2Y12 inhibitors have decreased ischemic events
after PCI compared with clopidogrel [58]. On the horizon
is elinogrel, a novel P2Y12 inhibitor that has passed the
dose-escalation study ERASE MI (Early Rapid Reversal of
Platelet Thrombosis with Intravenous Elinogrel before PCI
to Optimize Reperfusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction)
[59]. Results of ERASE MI were incorporated into the
design of the phase II nonurgent INNOVATE PCI trial
(INtraveNous and Oral administration of elinogrel, a
selective and reversible P2Y [12]-receptor inhibitor, versus
clopidogrel to eVAluate Tolerability and Efficacy in nonurgent Percutaneous Coronary Interventions; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00751231) were both IV and oral
dosing of elinogrel are compared with clopidogrel (presented by Rao SV et al., at European Society of Cardiology
Conference 2010). Patients treated with elinogrel, a
reversible and competitive P2Y12-receptor antagonist
which requires no metabolic activation, had greater inhibition of platelet aggregation than those treated with
150 P. Damman et al.
123

clopidogrel. At 120 days, there was no difference in major
bleeding, minor bleeding, or bleeding requiring medical
attention among those treated with elinogrel and those
treated with clopidogrel. Currently, a phase III trial is
planned.
Despite the improvement in clinical outcomes with the
new P2Y12 inhibitors, remaining questions are the possibility to switch drugs, different doses, duration of therapy,
optimal time of initiation (in NSTE-ACS), and costeffectiveness.
Regarding the duration of therapy, current clinical
practice guidelines recommend 12-month treatment with
dual antiplatelet therapy in the setting of ACS. However,
the optimal duration after PCI and the extent to which dual
antiplatelet therapy confers benefit against ischemic events
(including stent thrombosis) beyond 12 months is not
known. The DAPT study is currently enrolling patients to
assess the impact of 30 versus 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing PCI with stent
placement [60].
Cost-effectiveness of the novel agents ticagrelor and
prasugrel have been recently described. From the US
healthcare perspective, treatment with prasugrel versus
clopidogrel for a median of 14.7 months appeared to be an
economically dominant treatment strategy, resulting in
both lower costs and greater life expectancy [61]. The
lower costs were mainly due to a reduction in the costs of
repeat PCIs. A cost effectiveness study of ticagrelor from
PLATO showed that treating ACS patients with ticagrelor
for 12 months is associated with a gain in 0.13 qualityadjusted life year in a lifetime perspective compared with
generic clopidogrel (presented by Henriksson M et al. at
the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and
Outcomes Research Conference 2011). Regarding the cost
per quality-adjusted life year gained, ticagrelor was highly
cost-effective applying conventional thresholds of costeffectiveness.
