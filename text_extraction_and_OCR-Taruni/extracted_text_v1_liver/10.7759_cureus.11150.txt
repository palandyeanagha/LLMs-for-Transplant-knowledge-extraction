Abstract
The treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation is difficult due to the
lack of effective treatment options. The available evidence on the emerging immunotherapy in liver
transplantation is based on anecdotal experiences and requires additional investigations. To determine the
efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in liver transplant recipients, we report three cases of recurrent
metastatic HCC after liver transplantation who were treated with nivolumab as off-label salvage therapy.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked first among primary hepatic cancers, involving more than half a
million patients per year [1]. Several early-phase clinical trials have investigated the value of
immunotherapy in advanced HCC, as it represents the example of inflammation-induced cancers [2]. Liver
transplantation is the treatment of choice for localized HCC in the absence of contraindications [3]. The
recurrence rate after liver transplantation for HCC, despite the strict eligibility criteria, is high, varying
between 6% to 18% [4]. The treatment of recurrent HCC after liver transplantation is a real challenge for the
clinical practice, given the absence of any therapeutic standards [5].
The principle of immunotherapy consists of the induction of an anti-tumor immune response using
monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints present on the surface of T-cells. Immune-checkpoint
inhibitors include two major families of antibodies targeting either the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [6]. Nivolumab is the first recombinant
human monoclonal antibody developed in the world that targets PD-1 [7]. The response rate with this
molecule reached 20% with two complete responses in phase I/II trial (CheckMate-040 trial) in advanced
HCC. These results seemed extremely promising for the advanced stage of this malignancy known by its poor
survival [8]. Nivolumab is also characterized by its persistent effect in responders, which
encouraged scientists-clinicians to continue patients’ enrollment for this setting. At the Congress of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 2017, the updated data of this study confirmed satisfactory
results for overall survival (OS) with a median of 28.6 months in the first line of treatment and 15.6 months
in the second line [9]. The nivolumab positioning in the first-line versus sorafenib is under investigation in
phase III [10].
It is actually known that the tolerance of transplant organs involves the modulation of cell-mediated
immunity [11-12] and that the transplant rejection’s risk may be caused by the deregulation of these
processes [13]. The fear of transplant rejection leads to the exclusion of the recipient's solid organ transplant
from the clinical trials of immune checkpoints inhibitors [14]. The current data on immunotherapy after
hepatic transplantation are lacking and are limited to case reports and small published series [15-16].
In this paper, we describe three cases of recurrent metastatic HCC after liver transplantation in whom
nivolumab was used as off-label salvage treatment.

Child A and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 7. He was treated with three courses of arterial
chemoembolization, followed by a complete hepatectomy and an orthotopic liver transplant. After 33
months of transplantation, the patient had rising alpha-fetoprotein and the presence of liver metastasis on
surveillance imaging. The diagnosis consisted of recurrent metastatic HCC. The patient received sorafenib as
first-line treatment. As a second-line treatment, the patient received six cycles of gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin. However, his disease progressed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), and he was treated with regorafenib. After metastatic disease progression, the patient was treated
by salvage nivolumab at 240 mg every two weeks. The patient continued the immunosuppression of
tacrolimus. The patient presented right-sided abdominal pain, and liver enzymes and total bilirubin were
elevated after four doses of nivolumab. The patient was then treated with a pulse of high-dose steroids.
Therefore, nivolumab treatment was interrupted. The patient was followed up and died four months after
tumor progression.
Case 2
A 62-year-old female with a history of hepatitis B virus and multifocal HCC Child B and MELD 14, underwent
liver transplantation. One year after, surveillance imaging revealed adrenal and pulmonary metastasis and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She received first-line treatment using sorafenib for six months. Because of
tumor progression, a second-line treatment by regorafenib was decided. However, the disease progressed
and alpha-fetoprotein rose after nine months of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). She was treated
by chemotherapy (5 fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) for six cycles. After progression, a multidisciplinary teambased discussion decided to start nivolumab while maintaining immunosuppression by tacrolimus. She
received five cycles of nivolumab 240 mg every two weeks, with continuous monitoring of serum tacrolimus
concentration and liver function. No graft rejection or immune adverse events was observed in this case.
However, her metastatic disease progressed. A fifth-line treatment by lenvatinib was started. This patient is
still alive with clinical-radiological disease stability.
Case 3
This was a 66-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus, with Child B and MELD 20
HCC. After two courses of arterial chemoembolization, a total hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant
were performed. Two years later, the patient presented with hepatic and pulmonary metastases. The patient
was treated with first-line sorafenib for two years. A second-line treatment by Regorafenib was
administrated for 9 months. After progression on chemotherapy (gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) used in the
third-line, the patient received nivolumab every two weeks. He continued immunosuppression using
tacrolimus. The PD-1 inhibition by nivolumab did not induce immune adverse events. His tumor progressed
after six cycles of nivolumab and a new therapeutic line using cabozantinib has been started.
Discussion
Nivolumab was the first PD-1 inhibitor approved for HCC treatment by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in September 2017 because of the trial CheckMate 040 outcomes [2-8]. The nivolumab EMA approval
has not yet been received even after CheckMate 459 trial data demonstrated clinical improvement in OS and
overall response rate (ORR) with nivolumab compared to sorafenib in the first-line setting for advanced HCC
[10]. Initially, solid organ transplantations were the exclusion criteria in immune checkpoint inhibitors due
to immunosuppressive agents administration [17-18].
The administration of nivolumab after liver transplantation poses the question of its tolerance and
efficacity. In our three cases, no severe adverse effects with nivolumab were observed. Notably, liver
transplant recipients may, therefore, be included in immunotherapy clinical trials. However, appropriate
patient selection, strict laboratory, clinical monitoring, and the use of low immunosuppressive drug dosing
during nivolumab therapy are needed.
Immunosuppression and immunotherapy are two crucial conditions in the identification of patients that
may receive immunomodulatory agents in this setting [19]. However, the immunogenicity of transplant
organs differs. It appears that the liver grafts are less immunogenic as compared to other organs, such as the
heart, the kidneys, or the lungs, which leads us to discuss the possibility of less aggressive
immunosuppressive treatment use [20].
None of our patients showed a significant benefit under immunotherapy, probably due to a late introduction
in the third or fourth-line for aggressive diseases. The small patient sample does not support our conclusion
on the efficacy of immunotherapy in hepatic transplant patients. Further studies with a large patient cohort
are awaited.
Conclusions
Overall, the use of immunotherapy in HCC recurrent after liver transplantation is not recommended in light
of current data but medicine is one of the most evolving areas where the guidelines change overnight.
Therefore, to define the feasibility of immunotherapy in hepatic transplants for HCC, clinical trials including

this specific population are needed.
