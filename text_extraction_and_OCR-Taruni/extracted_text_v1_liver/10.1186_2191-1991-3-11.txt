Abstract
Background: The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its inadequate management results in a heavy burden of
the disease for the patients, the health and the productive system and the overall community. Consequently, it is
necessary to have new effective drugs to treat people with diabetes to decrease such burden. DPP-4 inhibitors can
help to cope with this demand, but its usage is challenged by its apparent high cost. The aim of the current study
was to compare a simulated cost-effectiveness ratio of metformin (MET) plus one drug of the DPP-4 inhibitors
family, saxagliptin (SAXA) or sulfonylurea (SU) treatment during a 20-year period, from the perspective of the social
security system, in a cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who did not attain glycosylated hemoglobin
treatment target values only with MET.
Methods: A discrete event simulation model (Cardiff diabetes model) based on UKPDS 68 was used to simulate
disease progression and to estimate the economic and health treatment consequences in people with T2DM. The
clinical efficacy parameters for SAXA administration were obtained from the literature; local standard costs were
considered for drug acquisition, adverse events (AEs), and micro/macrovascular complications. Costs were expressed
in US dollars (2009) with an annual 3.5% discount and a 20-year time horizon.
Results: The SAXA + MET treated group had a lower number of non-fatal events than the SU + MET treated group.
The model also predicted a lower number of fatal macrovascular events for the SAXA + MET group (149.6 vs. 152.8).
The total cost of the SAXA + MET cohort was 15% higher than that of the SU + MET cohort. Treatment with SAXA +
MET resulted in a higher number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (9.54 vs. 9.32) and life-years gained (LYGs)
(20.84 vs. 20.76) compared to those treated with SU + MET. The incremental cost per QALY and LYG gained was
$7,374 and $20,490, respectively.
Conclusions: According to the criteria proposed by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, the use of
the combination SAXA + MET is highly cost-effective in Argentina.

Background
The prevalence of diabetes is growing continuously
worldwide and in Argentina this prevalence rose from
8.4% in 2005 to 9.6% in 2009 [1,2]. Although tight glycemic control has been shown to decrease significantly
the development and progression of diabetes-related
complications with the consequent decrease in costs of
treatment [3], such control remains elusive for many
people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In fact, the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
2003–2004 found that only 57.1% of patients with diabetes had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level below
the current treatment target of 7.0% [4]. A comparable
situation has been recorded in Argentina [5,6]. Consequently, the availability of effective drugs to attain treatment target values became an urgent demand that
triggered the continuous development of new products
by the pharmaceutical industry.

In an attempt to increase the percentage of people
with HbA1c value at target recommendations, antihyperglycemic drug therapy has become more aggressive in
recent years: initial treatment prescription of metformin
(MET) associated to lifestyle changes is currently
recommended by most international guidelines [7]. Additionally, the available evidence that combinations of different classes of oral agents are more effective to lower
glucose than maximal doses of a single drug, lead to recommend early or even initial prescription of combined
therapies for the treatment of people with T2DM [8-12].
Although usually effective, this prescriptive attitude increases markedly treatment costs. Additionally, newer
classes of drugs such as those of the incretin family,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-receptor agonists and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, are now available but at a higher cost than other drugs with many years
in the market. Consequently, several authors have studied
the cost-effectiveness of adding incretins to the treatment
of patients with HbA1c above those recommended by the
International Diabetes Federation [13,14].
On account of the above mentioned data, the aim of
the current study was to compare, from the perspective
of the social security system, the simulated costeffectiveness ratio of the treatment with saxagliptin
(SAXA) versus sulfonylureas (SU) as add-on therapy to
MET (SAXA + MET versus SU + MET in a cohort of
people with T2DM who did not attain HbA1c treatment
target values with metformin alone in a 20-year period.
Methods
Model structure and results
We used a stochastic simulation model especially designed to evaluate the impact of new therapies in people
with T2DM (Cardiff Diabetes Model). A detailed description of its characteristics has been previously
reported [15-17]. In brief, the model is a fixed-timeincrement stochastic simulation based on the UKPDS 68
study [18]. The time increment is yearly and the model
is designed to simulate a cohort of patients with T2DM
(up to 10,000) over a 40-year time horizon. In general,
the model runs twice; firstly for the ‘control’ group and
secondly for the ‘treatment’ group.. Standard prediction
from the model include the incidence of chronic microvascular (blindness, end-stage renal disease [ESRD] and
neuropathy) and macrovascular (congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, stroke and ischemic heart disease)
complications, diabetes-specific mortality, and all-cause
mortality. The model estimates costs and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each treatment strategy, using only direct medical costs. Outputs
include point and probabilistic estimates for costeffectiveness.
Population data and treatment strategy
The patient population included in the analysis has the
demographic and associated cardiovascular risk factor
(CVRF) (HbA1c level, overweight/obesity and hypertension) profile of people with T2DM who need an add-on
to MET treatment to achieve an HbA1c treatment goal
according to international guideline recommendations
(Table 1). The cohort simulated has not a background of
chronic complications or related events (Atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease,
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke,
amputation, blindness and ESRD) [13]. The treatment
strategies considered in the study were combination of
SAXA + MET and SU + MET. Both treatment strategies
were replaced by a rescue NPH insulin therapy when
HbA1c reached a pre-specified threshold value of 7.5%,
as recommended by the national [19,20], as well as international guidelines for diabetes treatment [21].
Treatment effectiveness and adverse effects
The model uses an effectiveness profile defined for each
treatment (Table 2) that represents the impact on HbA1c
and body weight [14,25-29]. Additionally, adverse events
(AE) associated to each treatment and their discontinuation probabilities are also defined for each effectiveness
profile. By default, values for each treatment were taken
from the single currently available head-to-head trial comparing saxagliptin plus metformin with sulfonylurea plus
metformin [25]. Also, based on previously published data
[26-30], in our simulation study we assumed that people
treated with SAXA + MET should start this insulin rescue
three years later than those receiving SU + MET.
Regarding the treatment effect upon HbA1c, it was
assumed that in people with diabetes its values increase
progressively and gradually [32]. To consider such progression, the model incorporates a “gradual increase

delay” function, which allows the user to specify when
HbA1c starts its increment. For the current analysis, it
was assumed that complete treatment effect occurs and
is completely attained during the first year of treatment.
Further, this value was considered as 0, assuming that
the gradual HbA1c increase as well as the change induced by SU + MET are immediate. In the case of SAXA +
MET, such value was considered as 3. Figure 1 represents the effect of the different treatments mentioned in
Table 2 upon HbA1c.
Utilities
Since there are no specific utilities estimates from
Argentina for diabetes and its complications, baseline
utility was modelled using the mean EQ-5D values
reported by the 2003 England Health Survey for people
with diabetes and without major chronic complications,
stratified by age group [31]. Utility decrements associated with complications were taken from the UKPDS
study [32] with the exception of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and blindness [33]. By default, subsequent events
incurred the same utility decrement as in the initial
event.
Costs
Input data costs are those related to drug acquisition,
AE and complication consequences. In the analysis,
all costs are expressed in 2009 US dollars ($). Costs
were initially calculated on Argentinean pesos and
thereafter converted to US dollars at the official exchange rate of December 2009 ($1 = 3. 82 Argentinean pesos). All costs considered in the analysis are
shown in Table 3.

For drug cost acquisition, unadjusted retail price was
considered, in order to provide an approach for any kind
of perspective by adjusting the scaling effect on total
drug cost. The annual cost of drugs corresponded to the
weighted cost of each drug, based on a combination
dose of each one. The drug costs were obtained from
Alfabeta.net, a private internet database which is the
main source of drug pricing in the Argentine market.
We considered the same price for saxagliptin and
sitagliptin. Costs related to macrovascular and microvascular events were classified into fatal or non-fatal and
applied to the year in which the event occurred. Maintenance costs for subjects who survived were applied in
all subsequent years until the end of the simulation
horizon or until the patient died. Costs of macrovascular
and microvascular events were obtained from the
reimbursement values paid in 2009 by a large local
organization (Instituto de Obra Médico Asistencial
[IOMA]) that belongs to the Argentinean social security
health subsector at subnational level. Costs associated to
microvascular events include costs caused by blindness/
retinopathy, nephropathy, amputation and hypoglycemia. Maintenance costs are estimated based on expert
opinion and values paid by IOMA. This includes physician visits, drugs and laboratory test. Indirect costs were
not estimated.
Discounting, Time Horizon, and Perspective
The analysis was taken from the perspective of Argentina
social security health care system. The time horizon of the
model was set to 20 years. Both costs and effects were
discounted at a 3.5% annual rate.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed one-way sensitivity analyses to examine
the robustness of results to variation in parameters and
model assumptions. A one-way sensitivity analysis was
performed for demographic (age and sex) and CVRF
profile (HbA1c, systolic blood pressure [SBP], total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and body mass index [BMI])
variables, all costs and utilities (reported in detail in
Figure 2). Additionally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis

was performed using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate
the multivariate uncertainty in the model, i.e., input
parameters were varied simultaneously over specified
ranges. Various probability distributions were chosen
based on assumptions for each of these input parameters. A Normal, Gamma and Beta distribution was
specified for demographics, costs and utility data, respectively. The Monte Carlo simulation drew values for
each input parameter and calculated expected cost and
effectiveness for each arm of the model. This process
was repeated 10,000 times to give a range of all expected
cost and effectiveness values and the results were illustrated as a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.
Results
Base case
Over a 20-year time horizon, the model estimated
that there will be less non fatal macrovascular and microvascular events in the group treated with SAXA + MET
than in that treated with SU + MET (Table 4). Although only minor differences between groups were
recorded in the number of events, those related to
congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction were
significantly lower in the SAXA + MET group. This fact
could be ascribed to the different effect of the SAXA +
MET and of the SU + MET combination upon body
weight.

Similarly, the model predicted less number of deaths
caused by macrovascular events in the group treated
with SAXA + MET than in the SU + MET one (149.6 vs.
152.8).
Total costs were $12,327,677 for SAXA + MET and
$10,694,769 for SU + MET. Table 4 shows that larger
cost values corresponded to drug utilization, followed by
myocardial infarction and nephropathy.
On the other hand, the number of QALYs per patient
for SAXA + MET was larger than that of SU + MET
(9.54 vs. 9.32) (Table 5). Also, the addition of SAXA
resulted in a greater number of LYG per patient compared to SU (20.84 vs. 20.76). The QALY gain with
SAXA + MET compared with SU + MET treatment was
0.22 per patient. There was only a small difference in
LYG (0.08 LYG per patient).
Considering that mean incremental cost was $1,632,
the cost per QALY gained with SAXA + MET was
$7,374 (Table 5).
Sensitivity analysis
The consequences of modifying parameters applied in
the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 2. While the
largest variations were associated to HbA1c values, age,
costs and utility values, negligible impact were associated
to HDL-cholesterol, BMI and Total cholesterol changes.
Anyhow, the analysis suggests that cost-effectiveness
results remain robust to plausible variations of the main
assumptions used in the model.
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve illustrates a
probability of less than 58% that SAXA + MET is
cost-effective compared with SU + MET (Figure 3), considering a willingness to pay of $7,626 (Gross Domestic
Product per capita for Argentina) per QALY.
Discussion
Based on the overall safety and effectivity of incretinbased therapies to achieve the treatment target value of
HbA1c, earlier and more frequent prescription has been
recommended for the treatment of people with T2DM
[34]. Even when incretins have additional clinical value
as repeatedly demonstrated [35], as any innovative
pharmacotherapy its use increases the cost of treatment
with the consequent negative impact upon health care
budgets [36,37]. Therefore, different strategies have been
used to demonstrate the relativity of such negative impact, based mainly on the verification of two key components: a) whether there is enough available evidence to
support conclusions about the effectiveness of a given
drug/intervention (adequacy of evidence), and b) whether
that evidence implies about effectiveness (magnitude of
benefit) [38,39]. This approach represents a marked
change from earlier times when the doctor’s beliefs
about the value of a drug/intervention were sufficient to
establish medical necessity. Although different groups
do not always reach the same conclusion about a particular drug/technology as well as on the suitability of
the processes used to evaluate evidence, it is widely
accepted that coverage determinations should be based
on the results of carefully designed studies rather than
on the expert opinion. The evidence-based evaluation is
also used by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the approval process of a drug and by the
Canadian and US task forces on preventive services
[40,41]. In this context, our study analyzed the costeffectiveness ratio of SAXA as add-on therapy to MET
versus addition of SU in a cohort of people with T2DM
who did not attain, in Argentina, treatment target values
of HbA1c with MET alone. The results indicate that the
combination SAXA + MET produced a greater number
of LYG and QALYs than that of SU + MET, with an
incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) equal to $ 7,374.
Since in Argentina there is not an accepted universal
criterion to define a threshold for cost-effectiveness ratio, we used guidelines specifically intended for international comparisons, as proposed by the Commission
on Macroeconomics and Health [42]. This criteria considered a strategy as "cost-effective" when the ICER was
less than three times the gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita, and as "very cost-effective" if the ICER was
less than the GDP per capita [42,43]. Since in Argentina
the GDP per person (current dollars) in 2009 was $7,626
[44], our SAXA + MET treatment strategy would be considered “very cost-effective”. Further, the sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes
in input parameters.
Although in Latin America there are no similar studies
to compare with, our results are similar to those reported

by Schwarz et al. in a European population [14]. These authors evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of
adding SITA to patients with HbA1c > 6.5% while on MET
in six European countries, using a discrete event simulation model which employed the UKPDS Outcomes Model
risk equations for predicting risks of diabetes-related complications. They found that the discounted ICERs associated with the addition of SITA to MET, compared with
adding a SU, the values ranging from €5,949 to €20,350
per QALY across countries. The sensitivity analyses
showed that these results were robust to changes in input
parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility
weights for both diabetes-related complications and
hypoglycemia.
On the other hand, the NICE assessment group compared the rosiglitazone plus MET and a SU with
sitagliptin plus MET treatment using the acquisition cost
of the combined rosiglitazone/MET formulation for the
analysis. They noted that the comparison of sitagliptin
and rosiglitazone as well as that of vildagliptin and
pioglitazone did not consider side effects associated with
the use of thiazolidinediones. It was found that the
sitagliptin intervention was the dominant option (i.e.,
more effective and less costly than rosiglitazone), with or
without considering complications at baseline [21].
Two simulation studies performed in Sweden and
Germany using a similar approach to the one employed
in our study were recently reported [45,46]. Although
with differences in the monetary units used, in both
cases the authors’ conclusions support our data, i.e., over
a patient's lifetime, the addition of SAXA to MET is associated with improvements in QALYs compared with
SU in people with T2DM. Additionally, SAXA treatment
was also a cost-effective alternative for this type of
patients not well-controlled on MET alone.
Despite all the significant differences mentioned above,
we must accept that the model used, and consequently
the results/conclusions obtained, have some limitations,
namely: 1) it only considered direct costs from a third
party payer´s perspective; 2) it does not include
nonmedical costs such as productivity lost and consequently it likely underestimates costs from a societal
perspective; 3) the costs included in the analysis were
obtained from a single institutional source (IOMA), no
matter that IOMA is one of the most important institutions of social security system of Argentina and it is a
reference for other institution. However, the update of
the model results with additional sources of costs will
improve its external validity; 4) data regarding utilities
came from European population, which could be different for Argentinean one and thus it could have biased
our results. In this regard we could argue that utility
values were varied in the sensitivity analysis to show the
impact on the outcomes of the model, and all the results
of such sensitivity analysis variations confirmed those of
our base case analysis. On the other hand, despite great
efforts have been currently made to use the most accurate and up-to-date data sources to provide a realistic
simulation of T2DM in Argentina, the model has a limitation shared by most modeling studies, namely, the uncertainty around projecting long-term outcomes based
on clinical input data from a short-term study. This
situation is conditioned by the absence of lifetime
follow-up data from a well-designed clinical or epidemiological study. All these concerns suggest that the
current results might be used with caution to avoid

misleading conclusions rather than to deny their real
value for decision makers and administrators.
Conclusions
In brief, the data currently obtained using a stochastic
simulation model designed to evaluate the impact of
new therapies in people with T2DM [15-17] and local
costs of drugs and diabetes-related events in a 20-year
time horizon, strongly suggest that according to the criteria proposed by the Commission on Macroeconomics
and Health, the use of the combination SAXA + MET in
Argentina is very cost effective. We expect that these results will prompt our health care organizations to use
these data, and also apply a similar procedure to the one
currently described to take decisions on drug coverage.
Implementation of such procedure would help to establish appropriate priorities to allocate economic resources
based on objective evidence.
