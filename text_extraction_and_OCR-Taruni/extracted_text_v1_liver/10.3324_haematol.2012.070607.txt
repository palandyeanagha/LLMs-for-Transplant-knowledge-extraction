Thalassemia Syndromes
Introduction
Patients with b-thalassemia major require regular transfusion
therapy to sustain life.
1,2 While such therapy effectively treats
their anemia, the iron present in the hemoglobin of the transfused blood is retained in the body, since there is no physiological means of excreting it.
3 Iron accumulates primarily in the
liver and spleen, and to a lesser extent in the heart, pancreas,
and other organs.
4 This excess iron catalyzes the formation of
reactive oxygen species,
5 which damage a variety of macromolecules and cell structures leading to hepatic cirrhosis, endocrine
abnormalities,
2,6 cardiac disease2,7 and eventually premature
death.
7 The use of chelating agents has proven to be highly
effective, being associated with reductions in both morbidity
and mortality.
7-9 However, the available chelating agents have
significant limitations. Deferoxamine (DFO), introduced in the
1960s, was the mainstay for more than 30 years. Regular use,
with improved clinical management, essentially doubled the
average lifespan of patients.
8,10 Unfortunately, DFO must be
given parenterally, the most effective regimens involving daily
subcutaneous infusion over 8 to 12 h, at doses of 40 to 60
mg/kg/day.
2,4,11,12 Needless to say, lifelong adherence is problematic with few patients getting the maximum benefit from their
use of DFO.
13
To overcome this hurdle, attempts to develop safe and effective oral agents have been ongoing since the mid 1970s.
3,14-16
The first candidate to receive regulatory approval was
deferiprone (DFP). It is generally recommended that this drug
be taken at doses of 75 to 100 mg/kg/day in three divided
doses, 5 to 7 days a week.
17,18 While DFP is not as effective as
DFO in most patients,
19 adherence to its use is somewhat better.
7,8,20 With prolonged use, it is quite clear that body iron load
is reduced and cardiac function is improved.
7,8,21 It does, however, have side effects that limit its usefulness. Chief among these
are musculoskeletal (arthralgia, arthropathy), gastric (nausea,
vomiting) and hematologic (neutropenia, agranulocytosis)
effects.
22,23 Thus, up to 30% of patients discontinue its use for
one reason or another.
In an effort to optimize the use of DFP, we conducted a series
of metabolic iron balance studies to evaluate its relative effectiveness, alone and in combination with DFO.
24-26 These studies
demonstrated that iron excretion varied widely at all doses of
DFP (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day) and DFO (40 and 60
mg/kg/day) evaluated, and that not all patients were in net negative iron balance when taking DFP alone, even at a dose of 100
mg/kg.
25,26 On the other hand, combination therapy, employing
the same dosing schedules used when studying the individual
drugs, placed every patient in net negative iron balance at all

Patients with b-thalassemia require iron chelation therapy to protect against progressive iron overload and nontransferrin-bound iron. Some patients fail to respond adequately to deferoxamine and deferasirox monotherapy
while others have side effects which limit their use of these drugs. Since combining deferiprone and deferoxamine
has an additive effect, placing all patients into net negative iron balance, we investigated the possibility that combining deferasirox and deferoxamine would lead to similar results. We conducted 34-day metabolic iron balance
studies in six patients in whom the relative effectiveness of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day) and deferoxamine (40
mg/kg/day) was compared, alone and in combination. Patients consumed fixed low-iron diets; daily urinary and
stool iron excretion were determined by atomic absorption. Red blood cell transfusions were given prior to each
drug treatment to minimize the effects of ineffective erythropoiesis. Serial safety measures, hematologic parameters, serum chemistries, ferritin levels and urinalyses were determined. All patients were in negative iron balance
when treated with deferoxamine alone while four of six patients remained in positive balance when deferasirox
monotherapy was evaluated. Daily use of both drugs had a synergistic effect in two patients and an additive effect
in three others. Five of six patients would be in negative iron balance if they used the combination of drugs just 3
days a week. No significant or drug-related changes were observed in the blood work-ups or urinalyses performed.
We conclude that supplementing the daily use of deferasirox with 2 – 3 days of deferoxamine therapy would place
all patients into net negative iron balance thereby providing a convenient way to tailor chelation therapy to the
individual needs of each patient. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00738413

Toward optimizing the use of deferasirox: potential benefits
of combined use with deferoxamine

combinations studied.
25,26 Overall, the results suggested that
a variety of dosing schemes would achieve the levels of iron
excretion needed to eliminate iron overload while minimizing side effects. Subsequent long-term clinical studies have
substantiated these expectations.
9,27-33
The approval of deferasirox (DFX) as an orally effective
iron-chelating drug in 2005 promised to improve the management of iron overload as this drug could be taken once
daily and apparently had few side effects.
34,35 Moreover, it
proved to be non-inferior to DFO in a large, multicenter,
randomized controlled trial involving roughly 600 patients;
the doses of DFO and DFX ranged up to 60 and 30
mg/kg/day, respectively.
36 Many patients subsequently
switched to DFX. Significant reductions in body iron load
were achieved37-40 with some patients showing improvement in cardiac function.
39 However, it is clear that DFX has
its own limitations. While a wide variety of side effects
have now been observed, it is primarily gastrointestinal and
renal disturbances that limit the use of this drug in some
patients.
37,38 In addition, a number of patients exhibited rising serum ferritin levels suggesting that net negative iron
balance was not being achieved.
41,42 Based on our previous
studies, we speculated that supplementing the use of DFX
with one or more days of DFO therapy would lead to net
negative balance in all patients. Accordingly, we undertook
a metabolic iron balance study in which the relative effectiveness of DFX and DFO was compared, alone and in combination, with each patient serving as his/her own control.
Design and Methods
Patients
Six patients (2 males/4 females) with b-thalassemia major, 27 to
34 years of age, were recruited from the Ospedale Regionale
Microcitemie, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy. The patients selected for the
study were drawn from a larger pool of eligible patients based on
their availability and willingness to travel to New York City as well
as an assessment of their preparedness for the rigors of a 34-day
stay in our metabolic research unit. Their weight, yearly transfusion requirement, screening serum ferritin level, hepatitis C virus
status and hemoglobin level upon admission are presented in Table
1. None of the patients was splenectomized. Their most recent
chelation regimens were daily DFX (one patient), daily DFP (three
patients), and daily DFP supplemented with intermittent subcutaneous infusion of DFO (two patients). None of the patients had a
history of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
endocrine, oncologic, infectious, pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, other than conditions associated with b-thalassemia and/or
iron overload, such as compensated cirrhosis, endocrine insufficiency and diabetes. Moreover, no patient had a history of tuberculosis, epilepsy, psychosis, glaucoma or any other condition,
which in the opinion of the investigators, would jeopardize the
safety of the patient or affect the validity of the study results. None
was positive for human immunodeficiency virus or being treated
for hepatitis C. The study (NCT00738413) was approved by the
Institutional Review Board and the Scientific Advisory Committee
of the Weill Cornell Medical College. Written informed consent
was obtained from each patient. All travel-related expenses
incurred by the patients as well as all costs related to the 34-day
hospital stay were paid for by research grants. The patients
received no compensation for their participation.
Study design
This metabolic iron balance study involved a 34-day stay in our
Clinical Research Unit, a component of the Clinical and
Translational Science Center. Three 6-day drug dosage periods
were preceded and followed by a 4-day washout. The duration of
the washout periods was chosen to include the gastrointestinal
transit time of most patients with thalassemia. Throughout the
study, the patients consumed a fixed low-iron diet (11-15 mg of
iron/day) consisting of four rotating meal plans designed by our
nutritional staff in consultation with the individual patient. The
patients could choose whatever they wished to eat, the iron content of the meals being regulated by portion sizes. Each meal plan
contained 50% more calories than needed according to the individual’s body mass index. The patients were not, therefore, expected
to consume all of the food provided. All uneaten food was collected and its iron content determined to assess the amount of iron
excreted. A unit of blood was given on days 1, 11, 21 and 31 to
ensure that the hemoglobin level/degree of erythropoiesis was the
same prior to each drug treatment.
DFO (40 mg/kg/day) was infused subcutaneously over 8 h at
night during the first drug dosage period (days 5-10). On days 15-
20, DFX (30 mg/kg/day) was given orally 30 min prior to breakfast.
The combination of drugs was given on days 25-30, the dosages
and dosing schedules being the same as those used previously.
Twenty-four-hour collections of urine and stool were made each
day, their iron content being determined by atomic absorption.
Each bowel movement was collected and analyzed separately. A
stool marker, Brilliant Blue, was given before the first dose of drug
on days 5, 15 and 25, and after the last dose of drug on days 11, 20
and 31, to aid in assessing drug-induced stool iron excretion.
Specimens of blood and urine were collected on days 1, 6, 10, 14,
16, 20, 24, 26, 30 and 34 for determination of safety measures.
Serum analyses included measurements of sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood-urea nitrogen, creatinine,
phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, uric acid, bilirubin (total), bilirubin (direct), protein (total), albumin, aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, copper and zinc.

Serum iron, the total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation
and ferritin were also determined. Hematologic parameters
included a complete blood count with differential, reticulocyte and
platelet counts. Urinalyses included a determination of protein, b2-
microglobulin, glucose, ketones, hemoglobin, pH, specific gravity
and bacteria as well as creatinine and creatinine clearance (calculated). All of the analyses were carried out in the central laboratories
of the New York Presbyterian Hospital. Physical examinations
were conducted on admission and after each drug dosage period.
Determination of urine,stool and dietary iron
Complete meal plans were homogenized in deionized water
(MilliQ). The homogenate was weighed and an aliquot (approximately 5 mL) was then placed in a tared porcelain crucible. The
weight of the aliquot was determined after which it was dried
overnight in an oven at 110ºC. The dried residue was then ashed
in a Muffle furnace (model 62700, Barnstead-Thermolyne Corp.,
Dubuque, IA, USA) at 550ºC for 16 h. The ash was dissolved in 3
N HCl and the solution transferred to a 50-mL volumetric flask.
The crucible was washed twice with 0.36 N HCl and the washings
were added to the flask. The volume in the flask was brought to
50 mL with deionized water after which the iron content of the
solution was determined by flame atomic absorption (model 3100,
Perkin-Elmer Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). Uneaten food and stool
specimens were treated similarly. The volume of 24-h urine specimens was measured and then a 3-mL sample was added to 9 mL
of 0.6 N HCl. After standing overnight, the contents were centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The iron content of the supernatant was
determined directly by atomic absorption. The urine, stool and
residual food specimens were analyzed in duplicate, the complete
meal plans in triplicate.
Determination of drug-induced urine and stool iron
excretion
Drug-induced urinary iron excretion was determined by subtracting the mean daily excretion of iron during the washout periods from the mean daily excretion during the drug treatment periods. In order to take into consideration the gastrointestinal transit
times and stooling patterns of each individual, net stool iron excretion was determined as follows. The total amount of iron excreted
between the marked stools was calculated. The dietary iron consumed over the period of drug treatment was subtracted from this,
the assumption being that dietary iron absorption was minimal in
well transfused patients with b-thalassemia major. The resulting
value was divided by the duration of drug treatment in days in
order to determine the daily drug-induced excretion of stool iron.
Statistical methods
Given the small sample size and wide patient to patient variability, no attempt was made to assess the statistical significance of the
differences seen. Simple means and standard deviations are presented. The excretion data are net values, taking into account iron
excretion during non-drug days as well as the iron content of all
uneaten food and the transit times of each individual. Iron balance
was then calculated as the ratio of total net excretion to the
amount of iron received in the form of transfused red cells, values
greater than 100% representing negative iron balance. The effectiveness of combination therapy was assessed by comparing total
net excretion in response to the combination with the sum of the
observed excretions due to the individual drugs, values greater
than 125% being deemed to indicate a synergistic response, those
less than 100% a less than additive response. The effect of days of
use was calculated arithmetically.
Apart from the issue of statistical significance, the small sample
size and nature of the studies lend themselves to questions regarding reproducibility of the results. Given the duration and complexity of the studies, it was not feasible to evaluate this issue formally.
Instead we have relied upon consistency. Over the course of more
than 50 such evaluations of iron balance involving DFO as a comparator for four experimental drugs, the responses to DFO varied
significantly, stool iron excretion ranging from 31% to 79% (mean
61%) of the total in individual patients. In 13 cases, the patient
being studied had volunteered for the second or third time. In
these patients the excretion patterns and total amounts of iron
excreted were quite similar, the differences being less than 10%
despite an intervening time of 2 years or more. Furthermore, when
different doses of DFP were being evaluated, the excretion patterns
in response to the latter drug were consistent from dose to dose,
total iron excretion increasing with dose. Finally, in two patients
three doses of DFP (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day) were compared
over the course of the 34-day stay. Here, too, only the total iron
excretion varied significantly, the percentage of stool iron remaining largely unchanged. Of added assurance, when one of these
patients was studied again 2 years later, very similar results were
obtained. Accordingly, we feel confident that our results accurately
reflect the relative effectiveness of the drugs/drug regimens being
compared.
Results
Safety measures
No significant, consistent or drug-related changes were
seen in any of the safety measures assessed (data not shown).
As expected, serum iron levels were generally higher than
normal as were the levels of transferrin saturation. These
values tended to fluctuate during drug administration with
increases in some patients and decreases in others,
undoubtedly reflecting a contribution from the iron chelation regimen being studied. The changes observed were not
consistent from one drug regimen to another. The only
other parameter that tended to fluctuate in response to drug
administration was the level of serum zinc. Again, however, the changes lacked consistency. In two patients zinc levels tended to increase after beginning each drug regimen
while in two others only DFO seemed to cause an increase.
None of the other serum parameters evaluated appeared to
change in a consistent or drug-related manner. Except for b2-
microglobulin, all of the urinary parameters measured were
within normal limits and no consistent or drug-related
changes were noted. b2-microglobulin levels were high in
two patients, very low in two and mid-range in the others
with greater fluctuation seen in those with higher values.
Most importantly, no evidence of increased toxicity was
observed upon giving the drugs in combination, a finding
that must be further assessed in dedicated long-term clinical
trials.
Drug-induced iron excretion
Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the net mean daily amounts of
iron excreted in urine and stool following administration of
DFO (40 mg/kg/day), DFX (30 mg/kg/day), and DFO (40
mg/kg/day) plus DFX (30 mg/kg/day), respectively, for 6
days. The post-transfusion hemoglobin level together with
the daily input of iron from transfusion therapy are also
shown. The hemoglobin levels of each patient 3 days prior
to the beginning of each drug regimen exceeded 11 g/dL,
ensuring that absorption of dietary iron would not affect
the results. Iron balance is defined as the ratio of the total
amount of iron excreted to that received from the transfuCombined use of deferasirox and deferoxamine

sions. Expressed as a percentage, net negative iron balance
is, therefore, any value exceeding 100%.
Iron excretion in response to DFO at a dose of 40 mg/kg
was sufficient to place all patients into net negative iron balance (Table 2). In other words, iron excretion exceeded
transfusional iron intake (125% - 219%). On a weekly
basis, however, the effectiveness of DFO depends upon the
days of usage. Thus, two of the patients (1 and 4) would not
achieve net negative iron balance if they infused DFO only
5 days a week (Table 5). If used less frequently, a greater
percentage of the patients would fail to maintain balance.
With just 4 days of use, only two patients (2 and 5) would
achieve negative balance while none would do so if the
drug were used only 3 days a week. In agreement with earlier studies, approximately 60% of the iron excreted
appeared in the stool.
11,25
In a large randomized, controlled trial, the oral chelator
DFX was found to be non-inferior to DFO at doses of 20
and 30 mg/kg/day.
36 Our results, comparing the relative
effectiveness of the two drugs in the same patient, are
somewhat different (Table 3). While taking DFX, patient 2
was in significant negative balance (129%) and patient 6
was just in balance (102%), but the other four patients
remained in positive balance (<100%), meaning that their
body iron load continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate.
DFX (30 mg/kg) proved to be less effective than DFO (40
mg/kg) in all six patients, the relative effectiveness ranging
from 23% to 60% (Tables 2 and 3). While two of the six
patients would be in negative iron balance with daily use of
the oral drug, none would achieve negative balance (20% to
92%) if using it only 5 days a week (Table 5). This result is
not surprising considering that two of seven patients failed
to achieve net negative iron balance when given DFX daily
at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day in our previously reported balance studies.
43 As in earlier studies, nearly all of the iron
excreted in response to DFX appeared in the stool.
34,41
The results obtained upon giving the drugs in combination are shown in Table 4. Combining the drugs, using the
same doses and dosing schedules as those employed when
giving the drugs individually, resulted in a marked increase
of iron excretion. If the iron excreted upon giving the combination is compared to the sum of the excretions when
the drugs were given individually, this parameter was synergistic (more than 125%) in patients 1 and 4, essentially
additive in three and less than additive in patient 2, the
patient who responded best to DFX alone. In fact, five out
of the six patients would be in net negative iron balance if
they used the combination just 3 days a week with no
chelation the other 4 days (Table 5). The excretion pattern
mimicked the situation seen when DFO was given alone
with roughly 60% of the iron excreted appearing in the
stool. Individually, the percentage of iron in the stool
increased approximately 20% in three patients, remained
the same in two and decreased by approximately 25% in
one (patient 4).
Discussion
Comparing the efficacy of iron chelators is different from
comparing the efficacy of drugs used to treat diseases/disease symptoms because the former act stoichiometrically,
with iron being constantly lost and gained. This difference
is compounded by the high degree of variability among
patients when evaluating the relative effectiveness of a
given chelator. A number of factors, such as the effect of

food on drug absorption,
44 ineffective erythropoiesis,
splenectomy45 and overall iron burden, contribute to such
variability. In 2008, Cohen et al. showed that the rate of
transfusion correlates with the effectiveness of DFX and
DFO.
45 They found that negative iron balance was
observed in a smaller proportion of patients as the rate of
transfusion increased. For example, neutral or negative iron
balance was found in roughly 80% (DFX) and 90% (DFO)
of those who were heavily transfused, not unlike the proportions (67% and 100%, respectively) reported here.
However, one cannot conclude from their data that the relative effectiveness of the two drugs in individual patients
within similarly transfused groups would necessarily follow
the same pattern. Individual eating habits (DFX), infusion
rates (DFO) and tissue distributions as well as the aforementioned factors could affect the effectiveness of one or
both drugs. While the factors cited undoubtedly influence
patient-to-patient variability, they do not negate the important differences associated with comparing group means to
the relative effectiveness seen in a specific patient. Despite
patient-to-patient variability, and studies like that of
Cappellini et al. our results lead us to conclude that, in most
patients, infusing DFO daily is more effective than using
DFX. The clinical results with DFX reported post-registration lend support to our findings. It appears that more than
30 mg/kg/day are required to achieve net negative balance
in a substantial percentage of patients, as evidenced by the
failure of liver iron and serum ferritin levels to decline
appropriately over time.
41,42,46 Even at a dose of 40
mg/kg/day, however, not all patients achieve net negative
iron balance.
43 Moreover, increasing the dose of the drug is
problematic as evidence of toxicity has also increased.
47 The
efficacy of DFX might also be increased by splitting the
dose. Chang et al. reported that serum ferritin levels
declined by nearly 40% in 11 patients, who were unresponsive to once daily doses of DFX, after treatment for 6
months with twice daily dosing, the total dosage being the
same.
48 Further studies involving the measurement of iron
excretion and non-transferrin-bound iron would be
required to validate this approach.
With adherence to the use of DFO being a major issue in
the management of b-thalassemia,
13,49 our results highlight
the need for more patient-friendly chelation regimens. The
issue, then, is how best to optimize the use of the oral
agents. Our approach has been to supplement their use
with limited infusion of DFO. This promises to increase
iron excretion and, depending upon the results achieved, to
allow for reducing the dose of one or both drugs in order to
minimize toxicity, if observed. Thus, heavily iron loaded
patients could benefit from a more rapid removal of toxic
iron stores while those in whom such stores have been normalized could benefit from a maintenance regimen tailored
to their particular needs/lifestyles.
The results reported here are similar to those we

observed when studying the effects of combining DFP and
DFO.
24-26 In these studies, some patients who exhibited evidence of synergy had a significant decrease in the percentage of iron excreted in their stool when given the combination of drugs. This led us to suggest that DFP could “shuttle”
iron to DFO in the bloodstream for excretion in the urine,
the free ligand then being available to chelate more iron.
25
While virtually all of the iron complexed with DFX in the
bloodstream is protein bound,
50 the results seen in patient 4
suggest that under some circumstances DFX too may “shuttle” iron to DFO for excretion in the urine. As in the aforementioned studies, this was not always the case. Patient 1
also showed evidence of synergy when given the combination of drugs but had only a minimal shift toward urinary
excretion of iron. In the other four patients, only fecal excretion of iron increased, the smallest increase being seen in
patient 2, the one who responded best to DFX alone.
While eliminating the need for chelation 2 or more days
each week may sound attractive to many patients, this
approach would allow non-transferrin-bound iron, a
potentially toxic form of iron, to accumulate in the plasma
when no chelator is present.
4,51,52 Non-transferrin-bound
iron has been linked to uptake of iron into the heart.
4,53 To
obviate such a situation, DFX could be taken daily, supplemented with DFO two or three times a week, preferably
on alternate days to minimize injection-related side
effects. As shown in Table 6, two of four patients not in
balance on DFX alone would achieve balance with 2 days
of DFO supplementation, the others with 3 days of supplementation. As the body iron load is reduced, DFO
could be given less frequently. Should hepatic and/or cardiac iron not decrease appropriately, the regimen could be
modified accordingly.
Various regimens combining DFP and DFO have been
used.
27 The two drugs have been given on the same day
(simultaneous therapy) and sequentially on different days
(alternating therapy), the pattern of administration/days of
usage differing widely. While the primary goal may have
been directing chelation to the liver or heart, or to minimizing toxicity in the face of declining body iron burden,
tailoring the regimen to the lifestyle of the patient may be
just as important. A similar approach could be taken with
the combined use of DFX and DFO. Maintaining some
measure of daily chelation is undoubtedly the best
approach. With values of liver and heart iron available, the
physician and the patient should be able to agree upon an
appropriate/flexible regimen to deal with the situation at
hand. Finally, in the long run, combining DFX and DFP, the
two oral chelators, may prove to be the most versatile
approach to chelation therapy. Preliminary studies are
encouraging.
