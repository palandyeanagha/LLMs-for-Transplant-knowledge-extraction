Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
comprising a spectrum of conditions ranging from pure
steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, has reached
epidemic proportions and represents the most common
cause of chronic liver disease in the community. The
prevalence of NAFLD has been estimated to be between
20% and 30% in the general population, but this value is
much higher (∼70–80%) in type 2 diabetic patients, who
are also at higher risk of developing advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis. Increasing recognition of the importance of
NAFLD and its strong relationship with the metabolic
syndrome has stimulated an interest in the possible role
of NAFLD in the development of cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Several epidemiological studies indicate that NAFLD,
especially in its more severe forms, is linked to an increased
risk of CVD, independently of underlying cardiometabolic
risk factors. This suggests that NAFLD is not merely a
marker of CVD, but may also be actively involved in its
pathogenesis. The possible molecular mediators linking
NAFLD and CVD include the release of pro-atherogenic
factors from the liver (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and other inflammatory
cytokines) as well as the contribution of NAFLD per se to
whole-body insulin resistance and atherogenic dyslipidemia,
in turn favouring CVD progression. The clinical impact of
NAFLD on CVD risk deserves particular attention in view of
the implications for screening and surveillance strategies in
the growing number of patients with NAFLD.

Introduction
The importance of the liver in the regulation of metabolism
has been recognised for over a century and a half; several
pathological conditions are associated with intra-hepatic
triacylglycerol accumulation, but fatty liver has long been
considered a trivial finding. It has recently been shown that
fatty liver may occasionally be accompanied by necroinflammation and fibrosis, with histological lesions resembling those observed in acute alcohol intoxication. The term

‘non-alcoholic fatty liver disease’ (NAFLD) is used to
describe a variety of liver diseases of different severity,
from pure steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis
and, rarely, hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. This metabolically derived liver disease is becoming a major problem in
liver units, accounting for a huge number of consultations,
day-hospital admissions for liver biopsy and, lately,
admission for liver failure or transplantation [1].
The large majority of patients with NAFLD are overweight/
obese or have type 2 diabetes; another common associated
clinical feature is atherogenic dyslipidaemia (i.e. high
triacylglycerol, low HDL-cholesterol and increased small
dense LDL-cholesterol levels). A large body of evidence
suggests that NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the
metabolic syndrome [2]. Notably, NAFLD is associated with
insulin resistance in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals,
suggesting that NAFLD may be an early predictor of
metabolic disorders and diseases in the normal-weight
population [3]. Accordingly, the cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk dictates the outcome(s) of these patients more
frequently and to a greater extent than does liver disease
progression. There are two key questions. (1) is NAFLD
associated with CVD as a result of shared risk factors or does
NAFLD per se exacerbate CVD independently of these
factors? (2) Is CVD risk also present in pure steatosis, or is
the necro-inflammation characteristic of NASH the necessary
pro-atherogenic stimulus?
In this article we shall review the clinical and epidemiological evidence for an association between NAFLD and CVD, to
promote a greater awareness for the need for comprehensive
surveillance of patients with this multi-organ abnormality.
Epidemiology and natural history of NAFLD
The value reported for the prevalence of NAFLD in the community varies according to the criteria used for its assessment.
Two different datasets may be considered: (1) the presence of
‘bright’ liver on ultrasound examination; and (2) raised serum
levels of liver enzymes in individuals with no evidence of
liver disease of well-defined aetiology. These two criteria do
not necessarily overlap, i.e. individuals with ‘bright’ liver may
not have elevated liver enzymes.
In the community, the prevalence of ultrasound-diagnosed
NAFLD is ∼30%, this figure being largely influenced by
obesity and/or alcohol consumption [4]. If cases of excessive
alcohol consumption are excluded, the prevalence is not
systematically different between individuals with and without increased levels of liver enzymes [5]. When tested by
proton magnetic resonance imaging, the prevalence of
NAFLD is high, but again, over 60% of cases have normal
serum levels of liver enzymes [6].
The use of serum liver enzymes as markers of NAFLD
may produce a systematic bias. They are frequently the sole
evidence of a totally asymptomatic disease, and are the
most common reason for specialist consultation. The
amount of liver fat is proportional to the number of features of the metabolic syndrome and is closely correlated
with serum liver enzyme levels [7], which are subject
to large inter-individual variability. On average, patients
with NAFLD are more likely to have excess intraabdominal visceral fat and inflammatory changes in adipose
tissue [8]; fat accumulation in the liver rather than in
skeletal muscle is associated with features of the metabolic
syndrome [9].
Metabolically induced liver disease may also act as a
contributing factor in the progression of liver disease of a
different aetiology [5, 10]. Because of the high prevalence
of metabolic diseases in the adult population, there is a
frequent chance association, and there is evidence that the
progression of viral or genetic liver diseases may be more
severe in individuals with steatosis, leading to an underestimation of the overall clinical impact of NAFLD on
morbidity and mortality [5, 10].
The natural history of NAFLD remains largely
undefined. Population and cohort-based studies suggested
that the regular course is relatively benign in pure
steatosis [10, 11], with a long-term prognosis similar to that
for the general population [11]. However, a few clinical
series observed that hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for
NAFLD progression, mainly in the presence of obesity and
type 2 diabetes [12]. Liver fat content is ∼80% higher in
type 2 diabetic patients than in age-, sex- and BMImatched non-diabetic patients with NAFLD, and their
serum liver enzymes are not as representative of the
severity of intra-hepatic fat accumulation [13]. These data
explain why type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for NAFLD
progression, and are consistent with studies reporting a high
standardised mortality ratio for liver disease in type 2
diabetes [14].
NAFLD progression may eventually result in hepatocellular carcinoma [12], the incidence of which is lower than
expected on the basis of the prevalence of the underlying
cryptogenic cirrhosis, possibly as a result of slow disease
progression [15] and CVD-related mortality.
Evidence linking NAFLD with CVD
The main cross-sectional [16–31] and prospective [11, 32–
43] studies on the association between NAFLD and
intermediate markers of CVDor clinical outcomes are
shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the Electronic supplementary
material.

NAFLD, endothelial dysfunction, early carotid
atherosclerosis and left ventricular dysfunction
NAFLD is associated with circulatory endothelial dysfunction [16, 17], a marker of early atherosclerosis. Compared
with non-steatotic controls, non-diabetic patients with
NAFLD show a significant decrease in brachial artery
flow-mediated vasodilation, which is related to the severity
of NAFLD histology, independently of age, sex, BMI and
HOMA-IR [16]. Moreover the same study reported that the
10 year probability of CVD events (calculated using the
Framingham risk score) is moderately increased in
NAFLD, particularly in NASH [16]. Similarly, in patients
with metabolically well-controlled type 2 diabetes, mildly
elevated levels of serum liver enzymes are associated with
abnormal brachial flow-mediated vasodilation, independently of whole body insulin sensitivity, as measured by
the euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp method, and
other prognostic factors [17].
Carotid artery intima–media thickness (IMT), another
marker of early atherosclerosis, is also markedly increased
in patients with NAFLD patients compared with that in age-,
sex- and BMI-matched healthy controls [20–25], and
NAFLD histology predicts carotid IMT independently of
traditional risk factors, HOMA-IR and features of the
metabolic syndrome [24]. Similarly, patients with NAFLD,
also in the absence of obesity, hypertension and diabetes,
exhibit echocardiographic features of early left ventricular
dysfunction [18] and impaired energy metabolism as measured by cardiac 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy [19].
These studies provide strong evidence for an increased
risk of CVD in patients with NAFLD, and most of these
patients are expected to develop CVD events in the long
term. Obviously, they also raise the question of whether
CVD events will occur prior to the development of
advanced liver disease and whether aggressive treatment
of underlying CVD risk factors is an important treatment
modality for all patients with NAFLD.
NAFLD and increased prevalence of clinical CVD
In both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic individuals, those
with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD have a higher prevalence of clinical CVD than do their non-steatotic counterparts, and this association is independent of obesity and
traditional risk factors [26, 29]. In patients consecutively
submitted to undergo elective coronary angiography,
NAFLD was correlated with a greater severity of coronary
artery disease, independently of traditional risk factors and
components of the metabolic syndrome [30]. Moreover,
fatty liver is independently associated with lower insulinstimulated myocardial glucose uptake and reduced coronary
functional capacity in type 2 diabetic patients with known
CVD [27]. Finally, a recent autopsy study of 742 children
found that the prevalence of coronary heart disease is
twofold higher in those with NAFLD [31].
These studies further suggest that NAFLD patients are at
a higher risk of CVD. However, the cross-sectional nature
of the studies calls for caution in interpreting the data, and
large prospective studies are needed to assess whether CVD
risk affects long-term survival.
NAFLD and increased incidence of CVD
Overall, NAFLD patients have a higher risk of all-cause
death than the general population, mainly due to CVD or
liver-related causes. In a community-based NAFLD cohort
followed for 7.6 years, the rate of all-cause mortality, most
commonly due to malignancy and CVD, was significantly
higher than in the general population [35], and mortality
rates from CVD were the second most common cause of
death in 132 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD followed
for 18 years, with rates equalling those of liver-related
deaths [33]. Furthermore, the 14 year risk of CVD mortality
was doubled in 129 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD
and elevated liver enzymes compared with that in the
general population [38].
These studies examining the natural history of NAFLD
are limited by the relatively small number of patients and
by the fact that they originate from tertiary specialist
centres, thus limiting their external validity. However, a
strong association between elevated levels of serum liver
enzymes and increased CVD risk has been reported by
numerous population-based studies [32, 36, 39–41]. For
example, in a study of 163,944 middle-aged participants,
mildly elevated levels of liver enzymes were independently
associated with an increased CVD mortality rate in both
sexes [36]. These results have been confirmed in the Hoorn
Study [40] and in the Framingham Heart Study [41], both
of which reported that raised serum levels of liver enzymes
predicted an increased risk of CVD, independently of
traditional risk factors and components of the metabolic
syndrome.
In the Valpolicella Heart Diabetes Study, the presence of
ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in a large cohort of type 2
diabetic individuals was associated with an increased
incidence of CVD events, independently of a broad number
of confounding factors [37, 42]. Almost identical results
were reported in a community-based cohort of 1,637 nondiabetic individuals [43].
Notably, these studies indicate that NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of CVD, independently of
Diabetologia (2008) 51:1947–1953 1949

several established risk factors, thus suggesting that
NAFLD might confer an excess risk over and above what
would be expected to be associated with the underlying
CVD risk factors. Patients with NAFLD should be candidates not only for aggressive treatment of their liver
disease, but also for aggressive treatment of underlying risk
factors, as many patients with NAFLD will have major CVD
events and die prior to the development of advanced liver
disease.
Biological mechanisms potentially responsible
for accelerated atherogenesis in NAFLD
Current understanding of the pathogenesis of NAFLD
implies that lipids accumulate in hepatocytes, mainly in the
form of triacylglycerol, in the presence of insulin resistance.
The close inter-relationships between NAFLD, insulin
resistance and the metabolic syndrome make it extremely
difficult to dissect any cause–effect relationship leading to
the increased CVD risk. The biological mechanisms potentially responsible for accelerated atherogenesis in NAFLD
may either have origins in the visceral adipose tissue or in
the liver, or have the liver as the target of systemic abnormalities, with both sites expanding the defects (as shown
schematically in Fig. 1). A leading role in the development
of insulin resistance, inflammation and NAFLD is likely
to be played by excess adiposity, including ectopic fat
deposition—principally in abdominal depots but also in the
heart, skeletal muscle and other organs. In fact, ectopic fat
deposition is a source of multiple factors involved in atherogenesis, such as NEFA, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines [44].
Intra-hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation (fatty liver) is
the result of an increased flux of NEFA mainly derived
from the lipolysis of expanded abdominal adipose tissue,
which occurs in response to insulin resistance, but also from
dietary chylomicrons and de novo intrahepatic lipogenesis
[1, 45]. In turn, NAFLD, especially in its necro-inflammatory
form (NASH), may cause further increases in whole body
insulin resistance and promote systemic inflammation
through the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic
factors [44–46]. Indeed, liver fat content in non-diabetic
obese individuals is the best predictor of insulin action in the
liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, independent of
percentage body fat [47].
Patients with the metabolic syndrome typically have
atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which is characterised by high
triacylglycerol, low HDL-cholesterol, increased small dense
LDL particles, and increased apolipoprotein B100 concentration. The pivotal abnormality is an increased rate of
hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis and VLDL particle production, which results in secondary abnormalities characterised by low HDL-cholesterol levels and increased LDL
particle number and density [44, 45, 48]. As mentioned
above, insulin resistance is regarded as a major driving
force for atherogenic dyslipidaemia, because it increases
NEFA release, which stimulates hepatic triacylglycerol

output [44, 45, 48]. Increased lipid availability within the
liver and insulin resistance also inhibit apolipoprotein B
degradation, stabilising the formation of more VLDL [45,
48]. The ability of insulin infusion to suppress VLDL1
secretion is impaired in individuals with high vs low liver
fat content, resulting in VLDL1 overproduction [45].
Accordingly, it has been shown that hepatic steatosis in
type 2 diabetes is a better predictor of the severity and
composition of dyslipidaemia than are hyperglycaemia or
insulin resistance as measured by the euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp [49]. Liver fat content is a close correlate of postprandial lipaemia and increased levels of
oxidised LDL after an oral fat load, much better than
measures of glucose metabolism or body adiposity [50, 51].
Parallel to changes in metabolic substrates, chronic
inflammation is causally involved in insulin resistance and
the metabolic syndrome, as mainly demonstrated by
mechanistic studies in animal models [52]. Ectopic fat
deposition in visceral adipose depots, heart and other
depots increases the expression of several pro-inflammatory
mediators such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
IL-6, leading to local macrophage infiltration and associated systemic chronic inflammation [8, 44, 45, 53, 54].
Specifically, recent human data suggest that abdominal
obesity is associated with increased levels of circulating
IL-6 [53, 54]. Adipose tissue inflammation is one of the
earliest steps in the chain of events leading to whole body
insulin resistance [52]. Activation of pro-inflammatory
pathways is mediated by cytokine receptors and pattern
recognition receptors, including toll-like receptor and
receptors for advanced glycation endproducts [44, 52].
These pathways converge on two main intracellular signalling pathways, namely, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK contributes to insulin
resistance via direct phosphorylation and degradation of
IRS1, dampening the intracellular signalling pathway downstream of the insulin receptor [52]. NF-κB activation has
been demonstrated in the liver of patients with NASH [55],
and leads to increased transcription of numerous proinflammatory genes that amplify the response [52]. In the
presence of systemic inflammation, the liver is again both the
target of and contributor to inflammatory changes. Hepatic
steatosis is associated with increased production of IL-6
and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by hepatocytes and
non-parenchymal cells, including Kupffer cells and hepatic
stellate cells. Increased intra-hepatic cytokine expression
results from local NF-κB activation, mediated by hepatocellular damage and fat-derived factors [46, 56, 57], and is
likely to play a major role in NAFLD progression [1, 46, 56]
and CVD pathogenesis. Along these lines, an atherogenic
role of liver inflammation is supported by the observation
that CVD risk is greater in NASH than in pure steatosis
[33, 34, 38], and it is strongly associated with elevated serum
liver enzymes, a surrogate marker of liver necro-inflammation [32, 36, 39–41]. Consistent with the hypothesis that liver
inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of CVD, we
have also demonstrated that both patients with NASH and
those with chronic viral hepatitis B and C have markedly
greater carotid IMT values than do healthy controls [58].
Another effect of adipose tissue expansion and inflammation is an imbalance in the secretion of different
adipokines, which could contribute to the NAFLD progression and the resulting increase in CVD risk [46, 56].
Patients with NAFLD exhibit reduced adiponectin levels,
which are inversely correlated with the severity of NAFLD
histology [59]. The reduced production of adiponectin
associated with obesity may contribute to the progression
of NAFLD [46, 56, 59] and CVD [60], since this hormone
appears to exert strong anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic
effects. In contrast, leptin levels are increased in NAFLD,
and may play a role in the progression from pure steatosis
to NASH, at least according to studies in animal models
[46, 56].
The liver is central for the production of classical
biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction,
the secretion of which partly depends on factors that are
upregulated in the presence of insulin resistance and the
metabolic syndrome. IL-6 and TNF-α are the major stimuli
responsible for increased hepatic production of C-reactive
protein (CRP), fibrinogen and other acute-phase proteins
[44, 52]. It has been shown that fibrinogen and CRP levels,
which are known CVD risk factors, are increased in NAFLD
patients, particularly in those with NASH [61, 62]. The
liver is also an important site of production of plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), another known risk factor for
CVD [44]. Plasma PAI-1 concentrations are remarkably
elevated in NAFLD patients, and correlate with the
histological severity of NAFLD independently of traditional risk factors, HOMA-IR and components of the metabolic
syndrome [62].
Conclusions
The introductory key questions were whether NAFLD plays
a direct role in CVD pathogenesis and whether an inflamed
liver (NASH) adds to the CVD risk above the effect of
steatosis alone. The answer is affirmative: current evidence
indicates a strong, graded relationship between the histological severity of NAFLD and atherosclerosis, but NAFLD
remains associated with an increased CVD risk after
adjustment for traditional risk factors and components of
the metabolic syndrome. The biological link may be the
shared metabolic and prothrombotic inflammatory factors
and the common molecular events playing a role in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD and CVD. However, there is now
Diabetologia (2008) 51:1947–1953 1951

growing evidence that NAFLD/NASH per se can exacerbate
CVD risk, independently of shared metabolic risk factors,
through the release of pro-atherogenic factors.
NAFLD and CVD share similar treatment strategies
aimed primarily at improving insulin resistance and
modifying the cardiometabolic risk factors. Pharmacotherapy should probably be reserved for those patients at
highest risk of complications, i.e. those with NASH, type 2
diabetes, dyslipidaemia and obesity. The lack of adequately
powered randomised controlled trials of sufficient duration
and with histological end-points makes definitive recommendations difficult at present [1]. Current treatment
recommendations are limited to gradual weight reduction,
regular exercise and to the tight control of each component
of the metabolic syndrome. Insulin-sensitising agents (metformin and glitazones) also seem to be effective in the
treatment of NAFLD [1]; however, it is not known whether
improving NAFLD will ultimately prevent the development
and progression of CVD. From a clinical practice standpoint,
it is crucial that specialists and practising clinicians be aware
of the strong association between NAFLD and increased
CVD risk, given the growing number of patients with
NAFLD in the community. Hepatic steatosis is an occasional
finding; this should prompt clinicians to define underlying
CVD risk factors, which warrant evaluation and treatment as
much as liver disease itself. Liver disease surveillance is
necessary, given the long-term risk of advanced disease, but
tight control of underlying CVD risk factors also remains
essential.
