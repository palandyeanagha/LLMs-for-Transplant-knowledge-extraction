Abstract
A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for an evaluation of progressive renal insufficiency and
elevated liver enzymes. A renal biopsy revealed chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Her laboratory
findings indicated primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which was confirmed with a liver biopsy. CD4+ T cells
and CD8+ T cells with granuloma formation were the predominant cells infiltrating into the interstitium of the
kidneys and liver. The etiology of tubulointerstitial nephritis in the present patient was not clear; however, it
might have shared the same pathogenesis as PBC due to the relatively close onset, the similar profiles of infiltrating cells and the presence of granulomas.

Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a liver disease that is
characterized by the progressive destruction of the bile
ducts, most likely due to an autoimmune mechanism. A T
cell-dependent immune reaction has been incriminated as
the major mechanism of bile duct destruction (1). PBC is
often associated with extrahepatic autoimmune disorders
such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, thyroiditis
and Sjögren’s syndrome (2-4). Renal involvement in patients
with PBC is not rare, as distal tubular acidosis is found in
up to 33% of cases, usually without any clinical consequences (5). Additionally, some cases of PBC and Fanconi
syndrome have been reported (6-9). The primary renal manifestation of Sjögren’s syndrome is tubulointerstitial nephritis; thus, it is likely that patients with PBC associated with
Sjögren’s syndrome will exhibit tubulointerstitial nephritis.
However, there are few reports of patients with PBC with
apparent tubulointerstitial nephritis without Sjögren’s syndrome (6-10). A case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis
associated with PBC is herein described. Regarding histology, the similar profiles of infiltrating cells and granuloma
formation in the kidneys and liver suggested a shared pathogenesis.
Case Report
A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for an
evaluation of renal insufficiency and elevated liver enzymes
in September 2011. She was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst
and prescribed dienogest in July 2009. She was first found
to have elevated liver enzymes, including an aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) level of 54 IU/L, an alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) level of 103 IU/L and a γ-GTP level
of 312 IU/L. Treatment with dienogest was discontinued in
May 2010 because drug-induced liver damage was suspected. The patient’s health check-up indicated an increased
serum creatinine (Cr) level, from 0.86 mg/dL in May 2010
to 1.2 mg/dL in May 2011. She was referred to our hospital
in August 2011, where further examinations showed slightly
positive urinary protein (0.15 g/gCr) without hematuria, a

A physical examination performed on admission showed
a blood pressure of 89/58 mmHg, a regular pulse rate of 77
beats/min and no lymphadenopathy. A laboratory test
showed the following results: blood urea nitrogen: 17.0 mg/
dL, serum Cr: 1.13 mg/dL, total protein: 7.7 g/dL, serum albumin: 4.1 g/dL, potassium: 3.9 mEq/L, calcium: 9.2 mg/

AST: 38 IU/L, ALT: 50 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP):
694 IU/L, γ-GTP: 190 IU/L, total cholesterol: 218 mg/dL,
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 4.6%, fasting blood
sugar: 94 mg/dL, angiotensin converting enzyme: 16.4 IU/L
(normal: 8.3-21.4 IU/L), IgG: 1,341 mg/dL, IgA: 224 mg/
dL, IgM: 966 mg/dL, hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dL, white blood
cell count: 7,000/μL and platelet count: 21.1×104
/μL. Serological tests revealed the presence of antinuclear antibodies
with a cytoplasmic pattern at a titer of 1/320, an antimitochondrial antibody titer of 1/160 and an antimitochondrial
M2 antibody titer of 143 IU/L. Tests for anti SS-A and anti
SS-B antibodies were negative. An arterial blood gas analysis showed a PH of 7.36, a partial pressure of oxygen
(PaO2) level of 95 mmHg, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level of 46 mmHg, a HCO3
- level of 25.3
mmol/L, a base excess (BE) level of 0.1 mmol/L and an anion gap of 7.7 mmol/L. A urinalysis revealed proteinuria of
175 mg/day without hematuria. The patient’s creatinine
clearance was 57.9 mL/min. The urinary chemistry was
as follows: N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase: 11.1 U/L, α1-
microglobulin: 67.6 mg/L and β2-microglobulin: 20,975 μg/
L. The fractional excretion of uric acid (normal: <10%) and
% tubular reabsorption of phosphate (normal: 81-90%) were
17.0% and 85.2%, respectively. The level of urinary glucose
was 400 mg/day. No panaminoaciduria was detected. A
chest X-ray examination was normal. Abdominal echography showed that both kidneys were of normal size and
shape. An ophthalmological examination did not reveal
uveitis or sicca syndrome on Schirmer’s test or the Rose
Bengal staining test, respectively. Taken together, the diagnoses of Sjögren’s syndrome, renal tubular acidosis and
Fanconi syndrome were excluded.
A renal biopsy was performed in September 2011. The
light microscopic findings of the renal biopsy showed only a
mild increase in the mesangial matrix in some glomeruli
along with the presence of foci of mononuclear interstitial
cell infiltration with small non-necrotizing granulomas and
moderate interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 1A, B). The immunofluorescence findings showed slight staining for IgM in the mesangium (not shown). Electron microscopy showed no
electron-dense deposits in the examined glomeruli or tubular
basement membranes. Mitochondria with normal profiles
were contained in one proximal tubule (Fig. 2A), whereas
various sized and shaped mitochondria with irregular cristae
and some lucent matrices were found in another proximal

tubule (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemical staining of CD4+,
CD8+ and CD20+ revealed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dominant
infiltration in the interstitium compared with that observed
for CD20+ B cells (Fig. 3A-C). Chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis was diagnosed, although the patient had
no obvious contributing factors, such as granulomatosis with
polyangiitis or sarcoidosis.
To confirm the diagnosis of PBC, which was suggested
by several laboratory findings, a liver biopsy was performed.
An examination of the liver specimen revealed moderate inflammatory infiltrations primarily composed of lymphocytes
in the portal area. Interface hepatitis, slight nonsuppurative
cholangitis, epithelioid granuloma formation (Fig. 1C) and
atypical cholangiolar hyperplasia were also found in association with partial bridging fibrosis and cellular infiltration of
hepatocytes. These features were compatible with stage II to
III PBC. Immunohistochemistry showed that the infiltrating
cells were primarily composed of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T
cells compared with CD20+ B cells (Fig. 3D-F).
The patient was given only oral ursodeoxycholic acid for

PBC because no tubulitis was found, and the efficacy of
corticosteroids for treating chronic granulomatous interstitial
nephritis is considered questionable. Her progressive renal
function decrease stopped, and other parameters, including
urinary β2 microglobulin and liver enzymes, did not worsen
over the 11 months following her discharge. At the last
follow-up in August 2012, the levels of AST and ALT were
normal, the levels of ALP and γ-GTP were 389 IU/L and
190 IU/L, respectively, and the level of urinary β2 microglobulin was 3,743 μg/L.
Discussion
PBC is often associated with extrahepatic autoimmune
disorders (2, 3) such as Sjögren’s syndrome. The tubulointerstitial nephritis observed in Sjögren’s syndrome (11, 12) is sometimes found in patients with
PBC (13). Tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by Sjögren’s
syndrome is associated with inflammatory cell infiltration
consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes (12).
Nine cases of biopsy-proven tubulointerstitial nephritis,
which were unrelated to Sjögren’s syndrome (6-10), have
been reported in association with PBC, six of which involved Fanconi syndrome (6-9). Lino et al. examined the
profile of infiltrating cells in the renal interstitium and reported marked interstitial cellular infiltration composed primarily of CD3+ lymphocytes (8). Lino et al. also mentioned
two possible mechanisms underlying the genesis of tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by PBC (8). First, autoreactive T lymphocytes driven by abnormal antigen expressions
in both hepatocytes and renal tubular cells might be involved, leading to T lymphocyte infiltration into the renal
interstitium. Second, antimitochondrial antibodies, especially
antimitochondrial M2 antibodies, might thus play a role in
the genesis of tubulointerstitial nephritis, which could significantly reduce the activities of three mitochondrial enzymes. This explanation suggests that PBC might contribute
to Fanconi syndrome, as Fanconi syndrome and tubulointerstitial nephritis are typical renal features of mitochondrial
cytopathies (14).
A T cell-dominant profile of infiltrating cells and (epithelioid) granuloma formation were found in both the interstitium of the kidneys and portal areas of the liver in the present patient. In addition to macrophages, T cells are thought
to contribute to granuloma formation (15). Based on the histological features and the relatively close onset of the renal
and hepatic symptoms, the present case might therefore support the first hypothesis regarding the involvement of autoreactive T lymphocytes proposed by Lino et al. In addition,
electron microscopy showed altered mitochondrial morphology in the proximal tubules. The second hypothesis involving decreased mitochondrial activity caused by antimitochondrial antibodies suggested by Lino et al. might also explain the tubulointerstitial nephritis observed in this case to
some extent. The phenotype of the disease might depend on
the severity of dysfunction. In the present case, the mitochondrial damage in the tubules might not have been severe
enough to result in the clinical appearance of Fanconi syndrome and/or renal tubular acidosis. After being treated with
ursodeoxycholic acid, the patient’s levels of transaminases
normalized and the serum creatinine level stabilized for the
next 11 months. It is unlikely that ursodeoxycholic acid has
immunological actions in both PBC and interstitial nephritis.
If the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial nephritis in this case
is completely in accord with that of PBC, then tubulointerstitial nephritis is less likely to show spontaneous remission
since spontaneous remission of PBC is not widely accepted.
Therefore, fluctuating factors other than factors related to
PBC might also contribute to the progression of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
The case of a patient who was simultaneously diagnosed
as having granulomatous interstitial nephritis and PBC was
herein described. The etiology of these conditions might
have partly shared the same pathogenesis and developed insidiously at an early stage. Much attention should be paid to
the diagnosis of related complications in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis or PBC, and further investigations are
necessary to explore the possible common pathogenesis of
these diseases.
