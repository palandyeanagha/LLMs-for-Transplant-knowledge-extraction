ABSTRACT
Management of Helicobacter pylori infection is evolving
and in this 4th edition of the Maastricht consensus
report aspects related to the clinical role of H pylori were
looked at again in 2010. In the 4th Maastricht/Florence
Consensus Conference 44 experts from 24 countries
took active part and examined key clinical aspects in
three subdivided workshops: (1) Indications and
contraindications for diagnosis and treatment, focusing
on dyspepsia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or
aspirin use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and
extraintestinal manifestations of the infection.
(2) Diagnostic tests and treatment of infection.
(3) Prevention of gastric cancer and other complications.
The results of the individual workshops were submitted
to a final consensus voting to all participants.
Recommendations are provided on the basis of the best
current evidence and plausibility to guide doctors
involved in the management of this infection associated
with various clinical conditions.
Management of Helicobacter pylori infection is
evolving and so is our understanding of the role of
the bacterium in various clinical conditions.
The European Helicobacter Study Group first
took the initiative in 1996 in Maastricht to gather
dedicated experts in the field and to review and
discuss all relevant clinical data to arrive at
recommendations for the clinical management
of H pylori infection.1 The Maastricht
conference has since been repeated at intervals of
4e5 years.2 3
Aspects related to the clinical role of H pylori
were re-examined in Florence 2010 with the
Maastricht methodology. The meeting focused on
indications, diagnostics and treatments of H pylori
infection with additional emphasis on disease
preventiondin particular, prevention of gastric
cancer.
In the 4th Maastricht/Florence Consensus
Conference 44 experts from 24 countries took
active part. Experts invited were chosen for their
expertise and contribution to H pylori research and/
or guideline methodology.
METHODOLOGY AND STRUCTURE OF
CONFERENCE PROCESS
Current guidelines from Japan, Asia-Pacific, North
America and Europe, as well as the ‘Maastricht
methodology’ were reviewed at an introductory
plenary session.
Working groups examined the following three
topics relating to H pylori infection:
< Indications and contraindications for diagnosis
and treatment, focusing on dyspepsia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
or aspirin use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
and extraintestinal manifestations of the
infection.
< Diagnostic tests and treatment of infection.
< Prevention of gastric cancer and other
complications.
Individual questions were submitted to all
participants, debated and modified according to
a standard template. After a thorough discussion
of each statement in one of the three working
groups the strength of recommendations and the
strength of the supporting evidence were graded
according to the slightly modified system, used in
our previous report3 (table 1). In a few statements
where there are only experimental studies in
support of the biological plausibility but no
treatment studies, we did not quote the evidence,
but graded the recommendation for
the statement. For some statements the grade of
recommendation did not match the level of
evidence because either studies focusing on the
same topic reported conflicting results or the
interpretation of the studies by the experts led
to a different grade of recommendation than
expected from the level of evidence. Aspects
related to the implementation of recommendations in daily clinical practice have also been
taken into account.
The statements and recommendations were
edited and finally agreed at the concluding
plenary session. Consensus was defined as support
by 70% or more of the experts. The recommendations resulting from this rigorous process are
reported in the manuscript.
Commentaries on statements were written by
the chairmen of individual workshops based on
the data presented by the person assigned to
elaborate the question; they include the
conclusion of discussions held at the meeting.
Coauthors were involved in the final editing of the
commentaries. The previous strong recommendations for H pylori eradication, such as in
patients with peptic ulcer disease,3 has been
reconfirmed.

THE TEST-AND-TREAT STRATEGY (WORKSHOP 1)
Statement 1: A test-and-treat strategy is appropriate for uninvestigated dyspepsia in
populations where the H pylori prevalence is high ($20%). This approach is subject to
local costebenefit considerations and is not applicable to patients with alarm
symptoms, or older patients (age to be determined locally according to cancer risk)
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 2: The main non-invasive tests that can be used for the test-and-treat
strategy are the UBT and monoclonal stool antigen tests. Certain validated serological
tests can also be used.
Evidence level: 2a Grade of recommendation: B
H pylori is the most successful human pathogen infecting an
estimated 50% of the global population. It is a common and
potentially curable cause of dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease.
Test and treat is a strategy involving a non-invasive test being
carried out in patients with dyspepsia to assess whether H pylori
is present and then treatment of the infection if it is found; it
thus avoids the cost, inconvenience and discomfort of endoscopy. The test-and-treat strategy is appropriate in situations
where the risk of the patient having gastric cancer is low; in
most countries this means dyspeptic patients below a locally
determined age cut-off point (depending on local incidence of
gastric cancer in different age groups) and without so-called
‘alarm’ symptoms or signs which are associated with an
increased risk of gastric cancer. These include weight loss,
dysphagia, overt GI bleeding, abdominal mass and iron deficient
anaemia. In young patients with dyspepsia, testing for and
treating H pylori is preferable to a strategy of just prescribing
a proton pump inhibitor where the H pylori prevalence is $20%.
The Urea Breath Test (UBT) and stool antigen testing are
acceptable non-invasive tests for H pylori infection in this
setting. For UBT, sensitivity is 88e95% and specificity 95%e
100%.4 Stool antigen testing may be somewhat less acceptable
to patients in some cultures but is equally valid, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92%.5 A significant symptom
benefit can be obtained from a test-and-treat strategy. This has
been validated in a primary care cohort, which is the setting
where most dyspeptic patients present.6 Test and treat must be
used cautiously in populations with a low H pylori prevalence as
it becomes less accurate in this setting.7 In patient groups with
an increased risk of gastric cancer (over a local age cut-off point
or with alarm symptoms or signs), the test-and-treat strategy is
not recommended and a strategy of ‘endoscope and treat’ is
preferred.8 In addition, non-invasive tests are less accurate in
older adults.9
Acid and functional dyspepsia
Statement 3: H pylori eradication produces long-term relief of dyspepsia in one of
12 patients with H pylori and functional dyspepsia; this is better than any other
treatment.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 4: H pylori can increase or decrease acid secretion depending on the
intragastric distribution of inflammation.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
Many dyspeptic patients found to be infected by H pylori have
functional dyspepsia (FD) rather than peptic ulcer disease. The
benefit from eradication treatment is less clear in these patients
than in those with peptic ulcer. At a population level, there is a
significant improvement in the resolution of persistent symptoms in the H pylori eradication group (95% CI 6% to 14%)
compared with placebo, with a number needed to treat of 12.10
Treatment response is difficult to predict for the individual
patient. H pylori eradication led to a 25% reduction in dyspepsia
consultations between 2 and 7 years of follow-up in a randomised controlled trial.11 Another study suggested that H pylori
eradication provides a similar long-term symptom reduction in
patients with dyspepsia and duodenal ulcer.12 The cost-effectiveness of H pylori eradication in FD varies between regions. In
Europe H pylori eradication is cost-effective compared with
offering no treatment but in the USA it is less certain that this is
a cost-effective approach owing to the higher cost of eradication
treatment.13 Overall response, however, is much better in
regions where H pylori is highly prevalent and this is where it
may be most cost-effective. Patients with FD in Asia would
benefit from treatment for H pylori infection with an increased
chance of symptom resolution as high as 3.6e13 after its
eradication.14 15
Successful treatment of H pylori infection may increase,
decrease or have no overall effect on acid secretion. The effect on
acid secretion depends upon the initial pattern of gastritis.
People with an antral-predominant, body-sparing, non-atrophic
gastritis have high stimulated acid production due to low
somatostatin production in the antrum, higher gastrin levels
compared with non-infected controls and so higher acid
production by the uninflamed gastric corpus. Clinically,
duodenal ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia are common in this
group. In contrast, people with body-predominant and atrophic
gastritis affecting the gastric body have low acid production
despite the same hormonal changes. This phenotype is associated with premalignant gastric lesions and with an increased

risk for gastric cancer.16 17 Therefore it can be concluded that the
pattern of gastritis and associated disturbance in acid secretion
determine disease outcomes. In both situations, treatment of
H pylori resolves the gastritis and leads to an, at least partial,
correction of the high or low acid state. While interesting, these
changes in acid production after H pylori treatment have no
proven clinical relevance and they should not be used as an
argument to treat or not to treat H pylori.
H pylori and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Statement 5: On average, H pylori status has no effect on symptom severity, symptom
recurrence and treatment efficacy in GORD. H pylori eradication does not exacerbate
pre-existing GORD or affect treatment efficacy.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 6: Epidemiological studies show a negative association between the
prevalence of H pylori and the severity of GORD and incidence of esophageal
adenocarcinoma.
Evidence level: 2a Grade of recommendation: B
At a population level, H pylori and GORD are negatively
associated,18 and this is most marked for cytotoxin-associated
gene product (CagA)-positive strains of H pylori. A review of 26
studies showed a rate of H pylori infection in patients with
GORD of 39% compared with 50% in controls.19 Similarly, the
sequelae of GORD, such as Barrett’s oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, are also less common in infected individuals.20 However, eradication of H pylori in populations of
infected patients, on average, neither causes nor exacerbates
GORD.21e23 Therefore the presence of GORD should not
dissuade practitioners from H pylori eradication treatment where
indicated. In addition, the long-term efficacy of proton pump
inhibitor (PPI) maintenance treatment for GORD is not influenced by H pylori status.24 An interesting phenomenon has been
observed whereby some H pylori-positive patients may develop
a sudden-onset, transient epigastric pain shortly after the start
of PPI treatment for reflux, but this again should not affect
decisions on management, and more studies are needed to
confirm and explore this phenomenon.25
H pylori, aspirin and NSAIDs
Statement 7: H pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of uncomplicated
and complicated gastroduodenal ulcers in NSAID and low-dose aspirin (acetosalicylic
acid (ASA)) users.
Evidence level: 2a Grade of recommendation: B
Eradication reduces the risk of complicated and uncomplicated gastroduodenal ulcers
associated with either NSAID or low-dose ASA use.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 8: H pylori eradication is beneficial before starting NSAID treatment. It is
mandatory in patients with a peptic ulcer history.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
However, H pylori eradication alone does not reduce the incidence of gastroduodenal
ulcers in patients already receiving long-term NSAID treatment. They require continued
PPI treatment as well as eradication treatment.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 9: Testing for H pylori should be performed in ASA users with a history of
gastroduodenal ulcer. The long-term incidence of peptic ulcer bleeding is low in these
patients after receiving eradication even in the absence of gastroprotective treatment.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
Both H pylori infection and NSAID use are independent risk
factors for the development of peptic ulcer disease and associated
bleeding and these conditions are uncommon in those who do not
have either risk factor. It has been shown that there is an increased
risk when these factors are both present.26 There is a difference
between naive users and those receiving long-term NSAID
treatment in the benefits of searching for, and eradicating, H pylori.
In naive users it is clearly beneficial to eradicate H pylori.
27 28 In
those who are already long-term users there is no clear
benefit.29e31 A meta-analysis showed, however, that eradication
seems less effective than treatment with a maintenance PPI for
preventing NSAID-associated ulcers.32 Further research is needed
on whether selective cyclo-oxygenase-2-inhibiting NSAIDs may
be safer options. For aspirin, even given at low dose, H pylori
eradication can prevent gastropathy and should be undertaken in
patients with a history of peptic ulcers.33 34 In such patients, the
residual risk of peptic ulcer bleeding due to continued aspirin use
after H pylori has been successfully treated is very low.35
H pylori and PPIs
Statement 10a: Long-term treatment with PPIs in H pylori-positive patients is
associated with the development of a corpus-predominant gastritis. This accelerates
the process of loss of specialised glands, leading to atrophic gastritis.
Evidence level: 1c Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 10b: Eradication of H pylori in patients receiving long-term PPIs heals
gastritis and prevents the progression to atrophic gastritis. However, there is no
evidence that this reduces the risk of gastric cancer.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
Acid suppression affects the pattern and distribution of gastritis
and favours corpus-predominant gastritis. It may accelerate the
process of loss of specialised glands, leading to atrophic gastritis.
In H pylori-positive patients, active inflammation increases in
the corpus and decreases in the antrum during PPI treatment.36 37
This shift in gastritis appears to be accompanied by an increase
in corpus atrophy.38 39 Studies in H pylori-infected Mongolian
gerbils showed that PPI treatment accelerated the progression to
gastric cancer.40 41 But there are no such data in humans.
H pylori and intestinal metaplasia
Statement 11a: There is accumulating evidence that after H pylori eradication, corpus
function may improve. However, whether this is associated with regression of atrophic
gastritis remains equivocal.
Evidence level: 2a Grade of recommendation: B
Statement 11b: There is no evidence that H pylori eradication can lead to regression of
intestinal metaplasia.
Evidence level: 2a Grade of recommendation: B
H pylori eradication has the potential to prevent gastric
cancers.42 A study on the effect of H pylori eradication on
patients with premalignant lesions showed that eradication may
prevent their progression.43 It is thought though that a so-called
‘point of no return’ may exist in the histological cascade from
chronic gastritis to adenocarcinoma after which eradication is
unlikely to prevent gastric cancer. It appears that by the time
intestinal metaplasia (IM) has become established eradication,
although retarding the progression of IM, cannot completely
prevent gastric cancer.44 45 This is not necessarily true for gastric
atrophy, where there appears to be a discrepancy between the
effect of eradication in the corpus and in the antrum. A metaanalysis of 12 studies on 2658 patients concluded that eradication
of H pylori results in significant improvement in atrophy in the
corpus but not in the antrum, but has no effect on gastric IM.46
H pylori and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
lymphoma
Statement 12: H pylori eradication is the first-line treatment for low-grade gastric
marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma.

Low-grade MALT lymphoma accounts for approximately 50% of
cases of gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Most are
linked to H pylori infection and in the early (lugano I/II) stage
low-grade MALT lymphoma can be cured by H pylori eradication
in 60e80% of cases.47e49 When the t(11,18) translocation is
present, however, H pylori eradication is usually ineffective and
these patients need adjunctive and alternative treatments.50 All
patients should be followed up intensively after H pylori treatment and given alternative treatments (chemotherapy or
radiotherapy) if the lymphoma fails to respond or progresses.51
H pylori and extragastric diseases
Statement 13: There is evidence linking H pylori to the aetiology of otherwise
unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and
vitamin B12 deficiency. In these disorders, H pylori should be sought and eradicated.
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
ITP
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Evidence level: 3b Grade of recommendation: B
The evidence available shows no unequivocal causative association between H pylori
and other extragastric disorders, including cardiovascular and neurological disorders.
Statement 14: The evidence available shows no definite causative protective effect of
H pylori against the following disorders nor that its eradication causes or worsens
them. However, further research is needed.
1. Asthma and atopy
2. Obesity and related illnesses
Statement 15: In H pylori-positive patients eradication treatment improves the
bioavailability of thyroxine and l-dopa.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
The association of H pylori with unexplained iron-deficiency
anaemia has been conclusively proved in adult and paediatric
populations. Two separate meta-analyses in recent years have
supported this association with one illustrating a clear link
between H pylori infection and iron- deficiency anaemia and the
other showing that H pylori eradication increases haemoglobin
levels in these patients.52 53 Similarly, for adults with ITP,
systematic reviews of past literature have shown an overall
platelet response in more than 50% of the patients successfully
treated for the infection and increased response rates in countries
with a high prevalence of H pylori infection in background
populations.54e56
Interesting associations have been noted between H pylori and
several neurological conditions, including stroke, Alzheimer’s
disease and idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. However, these are
insufficient to make a clear causal or therapeutic link.57e59 A
similar situation pertains with respect to ischaemic heart
disease, with several studies showing an association with
disease.60e62 The strongest link between these conditions and H
pylori infection pertains to infection with a CagA-positive strain.
One study showed that seropositivity to CagA was significantly
associated with the occurrence of acute coronary events.63
Inverse associations have been observed between the declining
rates of H pylori infection in some communities and the
increasing prevalence of certain diseases such as asthma and
obesity. Childhood infection with H pylori was negatively
associated with asthma and allergy in a widely reported US
cohort.64 However, this phenomenon was not observed in a
longitudinal community-based study which looked at serological
markers of H pylori infection in Europe.65 A large, populationbased US cohort failed to show an association between H pylori
status and body mass index (BMI).66
H pylori infection has been linked with impaired absorption of
certain drugs. The mechanism for this probably lies in decreased
acid secretion in infected patients.67 Clear associations have been
observed between H pylori infection and poor bioavailability of
both thyroxine and l-dopa, whereas H pylori treatment improves
the bioavailability of both these drugs.68 69 However, there is no
evidence that this is of direct clinical benefit to patients.
H pylori virulence factors and host genetic polymorphisms
Statement 16: Certain H pylori virulence factors and certain host genetic
polymorphisms are known to affect the risk of any specific individual developing H.
pylori-associated disease. However, there is no evidence that strategies based on
testing for these factors are useful for an individual patient.
Across populations, numerous studies have linked bacterial
virulence factors and host genetic polymorphisms to patterns of
gastritis and risk of disease, particularly peptic ulcer and gastric
cancer.70e74 When combined, these markedly affect disease
riskdfor instance, one study showed an increased risk of gastric
cancer with an OR of 87 when patients who were infected with
strains with a particular vacuolating cytotoxin genotype
(vacA s1) also happened to have a specific interleukin 1b genotype (the T carrier polymorphism of IL-1B-511).75 However, it is
not yet possible to define a clinical role for testing for either
bacterial virulence factors or host genetic polymorphisms in the
management of individual patients.
MANAGEMENT OF H PYLORI INFECTION (WORKSHOP 2)
Diagnosis non invasive tests
Statement 1: The diagnostic accuracy of the stool antigen test (SAT) is equivalent to
the UBT if a validated laboratory-based monoclonal test is used.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Several non-invasive H pylori tests are established in clinical
routine.
The UBT using essentially [13C]urea remains the best test to
diagnose H pylori infection, has a high accuracy and is easy to
perform.76 During recent years new formats of the SAT using
monoclonal antibodies instead of polyclonal antibodies, which
lead to a constant quality of the reagents have been developed.
The two formats available are: (1) laboratory tests (ELISAs) and
(2) rapid in-office tests using an immunochromatographic
technique. A meta-analysis of 22 studies including 2499 patients
showed that laboratory SATs using monoclonal antibodies
have a high accuracy both for initial and post-treatment diagnosis of H pylori.
77 These data have been confirmed by more
recent studies.78 79 In contrast, the rapid in-office tests have a
limited accuracy.80 81
Therefore, when a SAT has to be used the recommendation is
to use an ELISA format with a monoclonal antibody as reagent.
Statement 2: The serological tests are not all equivalent. Only validated IgG serology
tests should be used owing to variability in the accuracy of different commercial tests.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: B
Statement 3: A validated IgG serology may be used in the setting of recent use of
antimicrobial* and antisecretory drugs, or ulcer bleeding, atrophy and gastric
malignancies.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: B
*Expert opinion (5D).
Serology is the third method commonly used as a non-invasive method to diagnose H pylori infection. Given that this
infection is a chronic infection, IgG detection is only considered
and the favoured method is ELISA.

Commercial tests use different antigen extracts. It appears
that those with high and low molecular weight are more
specific. The accuracy of the various commercial tests has been
compared using well-documented serum samples,82 83 and
showed marked variability. There are, however, several kits with
an accuracy >90%. Only these validated commercial tests
should be used.
As was already stated at previous Maastricht conferences,
serology is the only test which is not affected by local changes in
the stomach that could lead to a low bacterial load and to falsenegative results of the other tests. This is owing to the fact that
antibodies against H pylori and especially against its most
specific antigen CagA, remain elevated despite transient
decreases of the bacterial load and even for long periods (months,
even years) after the disappearance of H pylori from the
stomach.84
Decreases of the gastric H pylori bacterial load arise from the
use of antimicrobial agents, of antisecretory drugs and ulcer
bleeding (see also the ‘Treatment’ section). Also, bacterial load
may be permanently low in premalignant and malignant lesions,
including extensive IM or MALT lymphoma.85 86
H pylori serology combined with serum pepsinogen I/II ratio
may constitute a non-invasive method to detect premalignant
conditions, although it has a limited sensitivity.87
< Test-and-treat strategy (cf. Statement 1, workshop 1)
This approach proposed at the Maastricht 2 Conference2 is
reviewed in the first part of this article.
< Diagnosis of H pylori infection in patients treated with PPI
Statement 4: In patients treated with PPIs: (1) if possible, PPI should be stopped for
2 weeks before testing by culture, histology, rapid urease test, UBT or stool test.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
(2) if it is not possible, validated IgG serology can be performed.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
PPIs are now widely available since some are generic drugs and
even over-the-counter drugs in some countries. Because of their
efficacy in treating pain and heartburn, they are widely used for
symptomatic treatment of dyspepsia. As a consequence, when
a patient consults for dyspeptic symptoms, there is a good
chance that she/he is receiving a PPI treatment.
Several studies have shown that by increasing the gastric pH,
PPI use leads to local changes in the stomach. The bacterial load
decreases, especially in the antrum, causing false-negative results
of the diagnostic tests, with the exception of serology.
Most of the studies have been carried out with UBT and
showed a 10e40% rate of false-negative results.88 89 Similar
results were obtained with the SAT90 91 and it has also proved to
be the case with biopsy based tests (including culture, rapid
urease test and histology)92 but PCR has not been evaluated.
Histology leads to more controversial results: the pathologists
specialised in this field still consider this method suitable for
diagnosing H pylori in the absence of detectable bacteria but in
the presence of surrogate features (ie, polymorphonuclear cells),
whereas other pathologists may not share the same opinion.
Given that H pylori antibodies remain present for months after
suppression and even eradication of H pylori, serology is the only
test not to be affected.
However, stopping PPIs 2 weeks before testing allows the
bacteria to repopulate the stomach and the tests previously
negative (UBT, SAT, rapid urease test, histology, culture) can
once again become positive. Furthermore, no study has evaluated the washout period necessary after long-term PPI
treatment. For UBTa study claimed that the use of a more acidic
test meal would overcome the problem of false-negative tests.93
Anti H2 drugs may also lead to some false-negative results but to
a much lesser extent94 95 and the panel did not find it necessary
to stop them before testing if using citric acid.
Endoscopy-based strategy
Statement 5: (1) It is important to perform culture and standard susceptibility testing to
antimicrobial agents in a region or population of high clarithromycin resistance before
prescription of the first-line treatment if the standard clarithromycin-containing triple
therapy is being considered. Furthermore, culture and standard susceptibility testing
should be considered in all regions before second-line treatment if endoscopy is carried
out for another reason and generally when a second-line treatment has failed.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
(2) If standard susceptibility testing is not possible, molecular tests can be used to
detect H pylori and clarithromycin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance directly on gastric
biopsies.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
When an endoscopy is performed, biopsy-based tests such as
a rapid urease test, histology and culture can be carried out.
The interest of culture is mainly due to the possibility of
performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The rationale
relates to the fact that in the case of clarithromycin resistance
the rate of success of the clarithromycin-containing triple
therapy is very low, in the range of 10e30%.96 97 Several
studies using tailored treatments based on H pylori susceptibility to antibiotics in comparison with standard empirical
triple therapy have shown a better eradication rate98 and may
be cost-effective. While the cost-effectiveness may vary
according to the cost of care in a given country, it is the expert’s
opinion that this approach is economically and ecologically
sound in countries of high clarithromycin resistance or in
specific populations in some areas.
After a first failure, if an endoscopy is carried out, culture (and
standard susceptibility testing) should be considered in all
regions before giving a second-line treatment because the chance
of having a resistant organism is high, in the range of 60e70%
for clarithromycin.
After a second failure, it should be performed in all cases as
already recommended at the previous Maastricht conference.3
If culture (and standard susceptibility testing) is not possible,
molecular tests (including fluorescence in situ hybridisation) can
be used to detect H pylori and clarithromycin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance in gastric biopsies. Such tests have been
developed recently99e101 and kits are commercially available,102 103
but it must be noted that the accuracy of fluoroquinolone
molecular testing is not as reliable as for clarithromycin.
Attempts have been made to use stools instead of gastric
biopsy specimens.104 Owing to an improved sensitivity, molecular tests may detect resistant organisms when they constitute
a small proportion of the total bacterial load present. Further
studies will determine if molecular tests predict failure more
accurately or not than phenotypic tests.105
It must be stated that there is a cross-resistance in each family of
antibiotics because the same resistance mechanism occurs: resistance to clarithromycin indicates resistance to all macrolides,
resistance to levofloxacin indicates resistance to all fluoroquinolones
including moxifloxacin, for example. There is no cross-resistance
between different families of antibiotics which have different
resistance mechanisms.106 However, it is important to use the
compound indicateddthat is, clarithromycin for macrolides,
tetracycline HCl and not doxycycline, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin
but not ciprofloxacin for fluoroquinolones to get good results.

Statement 6: (1) If H pylori is cultured from gastric biopsy specimens, antibiotic
susceptibility testing should include metronidazole.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
(2) If susceptibility for clarithromycin is assessed by molecular tests, the addition of
culture for the assessment of metronidazole resistance is not justified.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
The rationale is that standard metronidazole susceptibility
testing lacks reproducibility107 and no molecular alternative
exists.
It was shown, however, that globally metronidazole resistance, as determined, is associated with a lower H pylori eradication rate (from 5% to 25%)96 also in sequential treatment108
compared with cases where the strain is metronidazole susceptible and that increasing metronidazole dosage and treatment
duration may partially overcome resistance.
Treatment
Regimens available
< The triple treatment including PPI-clarithromycin and
amoxicillin or metronidazole proposed at the first Maastricht
conference1 to treat H pylori infection has become universal
since it was recommended by all the consensus conferences
held around the world. However, the most recent data show
that this combination has lost some efficacy and often allows
the cure of only a maximum of 70% of the patients, which is
less than the 80% rate aimed for at the beginning and far
below what should be expected for an infectious disease.109
< While no new drug has been developed for this indication,
a number of studies have been carried out in recent years
using different combinations of known antibiotics. Most data
were obtained with the so-called ‘sequential treatment’
which includes a 5-day period with PPI amoxicillin, followed
by a 5-day period with PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole (or
tinidazole).110 111
< It was also proposed that the three antibiotics should be
taken simultaneously together with a PPI (non-bismuth
quadruple therapy).112 113
< There was also a renewal of the old recipedthat is, the
bismuth-containing quadruple therapy following the development of a gallenic formulation including bismuth salts,
tetracycline and metronidazole in the same pill.114e116 A
summary of treatment strategies is shown in tables 2 and 3.
Statement 7: PPI-clarithromycin-containing triple therapy without prior susceptibility
testing should be abandoned when the clarithromycin resistance rate in the region is
more than 15e20%.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
There are several explanations for the decrease in efficacy of the
standard triple therapy: compliance, high gastric acidity, high
bacterial load, type of strains, but by far the most important is
the increase in H pylori resistance to clarithromycin. The global
clarithromycin resistance rate in Europe increased from 9% in
1998117 to 17.6% in 2008e9.118 Resistance increased in most
parts of Europe, but it has now reached a prevalence >20% in
most countries in Central, Western and Southern Europe,
which is considered a high resistance rate. In Northern European countries it is <10%, which is considered a low resistance
rate.97
Following the European Medicines Agency recommendation
on evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of
bacterial infection, three categories of bacterial species can be
defined according to their susceptibility to a given antibiotic:
usually susceptible (0e10% resistant), inconstantly susceptible
(10e50% resistant) and usually resistant (>50% resistant).
H pylori now falls into the second category, except for Northern
Europe.119
In order to take into account the CIs of the prevalence
obtained and the regional differences in a given country,
a threshold of 15e20% was recommended to separate the
regions of high and low clarithromycin resistance (figure 1).
Regions of low clarithromycin resistance
First-line treatment.
Statement 8: In areas of low clarithromycin resistance, clarithromycin-containing
treatments are recommended for first-line empirical treatment. Bismuth-containing
quadruple therapy is also an alternative.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
In these regions the standard PPI-clarithromycin-containing
regimen is still recommended as the first-line treatment as well
as bismuth-containing regimens.
Different ways of improving the PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin/metronidazole regimens have been proposed:
< Increase the dose of PPI.

Statement 9: The use of high-dose (twice a day) PPI increases the efficacy of triple
therapy.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
There is indirect and direct evidence that high-dose PPI can
improve the cure rates of H pylori treatment.
Indirect evidence comes from old multiple studies showing
that high-dose PPI was necessary for the efficacy of dual therapies and the meta-analysis showing that twice-a-day PPI was
better than a single daily dose in triple therapy.120 In addition,
cure rates of standard triple therapy depend on the availability of
PPI, which itself depends on the CYP2C19 and MDR polymorphisms. A meta-analysis showed that extensive PPI metabolisers had lower eradication rates, while the difference was only
seen with omeprazole.121 A lower eradication rate was also
obtained when the MDR T/T genotype was present compared
with the T/C and C/C genotypes.122
Direct evidence comes from a meta-analysis showing that
high-dose PPIs increase cure rates by around 6e10% in
comparison with standard doses.123 A subanalysis of these data
showed that the maximal effect was seen in the studies
comparing high doses of the more potent second-generation
PPIsdnamely, 40 mg of esomeprazole twice a day, with a standard dose of a first-line PPI also twice a day.123 The rationale for
this finding is that the difference in the degree of gastric secretion between arms is more important when using double doses
of more potent PPIs. According to the data of this last subanalysis, increasing the dose of PPI from, for example, 20 mg
omeprazole twice daily to 40 mg of esomeprazole or rabeprazole
twice daily may increase cure rates by 8e12%.
< Increase the length of treatment.
Statement 10: Extending the duration of PPI-clarithromycin-containing triple therapies
from 7 to 10e14 days improves the eradication success by about 5% and may be
considered.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Four meta-analyses have been carried out and yielded very
similar results, that is, a 10-day treatment improves the eradication rate by 4% and a 14-day treatment improves the eradication
rate by 5-6%, in comparison to a 7-day treatment.124e127 There
was no difference regarding the rate of side effects. While the
difference in efficacy is statistically significant, they may be
considered relevant or not, according to other factors such as cost.
< use metronidazole instead of amoxicillin as the second
antibiotic.
Statement 11: PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole (PCM) and PPI-clarithromycinamoxicillin (PCA) regimens are equivalent.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
The meta-analysis of Gisbert et al128 was updated for the
Maastricht IV conference. A subanalysis was performed on the
trials using the same high dose of clarithromycin (500 mg) in
both arms, showing an eradication of 71% for PCM and 65% for
PCA, but the difference did not reach statistical significance
(OR¼0.82 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.16)).
When the PCM and PCA regimens were compared in patients
with clarithromycin-resistant strains, a statistically significant
difference was seen (p<0.001), but this difference may be due to
the heterogeneity of the studies. The few comparative studies
analysed could not ascertain whether the differences observed
were truly due to an effect of treatment or to confounders.
< Adding an adjuvant treatment.
Statement 12: Certain probiotics and prebiotics show promising results as an adjuvant
treatment in reducing side effects.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
Lactoferrin has been used to improve H pylori treatment. Two
meta-analyses obtained the same results and showed that
lactoferrin increases the efficacy of PPI-clarithromycincontaining triple therapies.129 130 However, the poor quality of
many trials and the limited number of centres involved should
be emphasised and preclude giving a positive recommendation.
Meta-analyses on the studies where Lactobacilli were used are
heterogeneous as they mix different species and strains. Additional work needs to be performed to determine the strain, dose
and administration to be used.131 131a
A meta-analysis on the use of Saccharomyces boulardii as
adjuvant to triple therapy showed promising results (OR¼0.46
(95% CI 0.3 to 0.7)).132
All these treatments are most likely to lead to a decrease of
adverse events, especially diarrhoea and indirectly may help to
improve the eradication rate. More studies need to be performed.
< Other factors.
Statement 13: PPI-clarithromycin-containing treatments do not need to be adapted to
patient factors except for dosing.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
Besides the CYP2C19 and MDR1 polymorphisms, which
affect the availability of the PPI administered, and the interleukin (IL)-1b polymorphisms, which affect the intragastric
acidity present in the stomach in the case of H pylori infection,
other factors have been considered: type of disease, BMI and
smoking status.
Treating patients with peptic ulcer disease shows a consistently better outcome than treating patients with FD. Several
studies have shown an association between clarithromycin
resistance and FD status of the patients133 without pinpointing
the causes.
In patients with high BMI, especially obese people, the
distribution volume of the drugs being higher, it is most likely
that the concentration at the gastric mucosal level will be lower
and the risk of failure higher.134 In contrast, Asian patients who
usually have a lower BMI will have a better outcome.
Smoking is also a risk factor for failure. The summary OR for
eradication failure among smokers versus non-smokers was 1.95
(95% CI 1.55 to 2.45) corresponding to a mean difference of 8.4%
in eradication rate in a meta-analysis.135 The reason may be a
reduction of antibiotic delivery due to a decreased gastric blood
flow, a decrease in intragastric pH in cases of smoking, and
nicotine could potentiate the vacuolating toxin activity of H pylori
in gastric cells. It may also be a marker of poor compliance.
Second-line treatment.
Statement 14: (1) After failure of a PPI-clarithromycin-containing treatment, either
a bismuth-containing quadruple therapy or levofloxacin-containing triple therapy is
recommended.

The rationale is to abandon clarithromycin in an empirical
second-line-treatment because there is a likelihood that selection
of a clarithromycin-resistant strain occurred. Three pragmatic
studies have evaluated the Maastricht 3 guidelinesdthat is, the
sequence of triple therapy followed by quadruple therapy, in
routine clinical practice.136e138 The three studies show that
a high rate of eradication success can be achieved with the
Maastricht 3 approach. Studies from Asia suggest that
quadruple therapy is also effective as a second-line treatment in
Asia.139 A recent meta-analysis of quadruple therapy showed
that metronidazole resistance had limited effect on the outcome
when adequate dosages and durations are used. This metaanalysis also showed that compliance with quadruple therapy is
high.116 140 Recent studies of quadruple therapy using a single
capsule preparation have shown good efficacy114e116 This
treatment meets the proposed criteria for a second-line treatment136: it does not contain the key antibiotic of the original
regimen (clarithromycin),137 the treatment is not affected by
clarithromycin resistance,139 metronidazole resistance in vitro
does not affect the outcome of quadruple therapy significantly,140 compliance with the regimen is high115 and the
regimen is effective in most parts of the world.
Use of 10-day PPI-levofloxacin-amoxicillin is the other alternative second-line treatment based on the results obtained in
recent years.141 142 However, the rapid acquisition of resistance
may jeopardise its future efficacy. It is strongly advised that
levofloxacin should not be used in a patient with chronic
infectious bronchopneumopathy who may have received fluoroquinolones. Whenever possible it is recommended to test
levofloxacin susceptibility before to prescribe it.
Third-line treatment.
Statement 15: After failure of second-line treatment, treatment should be guided by
antimicrobial susceptibility testing whenever possible.
Evidence level: 4 Grade of recommendation: A
After two treatment failures, it appears recommendable to
empirically prescribe antibiotics not previously used but,
whenever possible, to obtain gastric biopsy specimens to culture
H pylori and perform susceptibility testing.143 144 It will enable
the best choice to be made among the various antibiotics that
can be used and to which H pylori may develop resistance.
Besides clarithromycin and levofloxacin already mentioned,
rifabutin is another candidate that may be used.138 145 146
Regions or populations of high clarithromycin resistance
First-line treatment.
Statement 16: In areas of high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth-containing quadruple
therapies are recommended for first-line empirical treatment. If this regimen is not
available, sequential treatment or a non-bismuth quadruple therapy is recommended.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
In regions of high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth-containing
quadruple therapies are the first choice. It appears mandatory to
avoid clarithromycin use in the standard regimen under such
circumstances if this antibiotic cannot be tested. The treatment
recommended contains bismuth salts for which no resistance
has been described, tetracycline for which resistance is seldom
found in Europe and metronidazole for which in vitro resistance
is common but can be overcome by increasing the length of
treatment.
Several studies have shown good results with such regimens.
Furthermore, despite the number of pills, the compliance was
satisfactory and the bismuth-containing regimens do not lead to
more adverse events than the standard clarithromycincontaining triple therapy.147
However, bismuth drugs may not be available in some areas.
It is then necessary to prescribe sequential treatment. While not
ideal because it contains clarithromycin, it has been shown that
clarithromycin resistance could be overcome in a number of
cases. Indeed, the success rate with clarithromycin-resistant
strains was 75%.110 Non-bismuth quadruple therapy (the so
called ‘concomitant’ treatment) is also an option.
Second line therapy.
Statement 17: (1) In areas of high clarithromycin resistance after failure of bismuthcontaining quadruple therapy, levofloxacin containing triple therapy is recommended.
Evidence level: 5 Grade of recommendation: D
(2) Rising rates of levofloxacin resistance should be taken into account.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
After failure of the second-line treatment (with bismuthcontaining quadruple regimen), it is recommended to use the
PPI-containing levofloxacin regimen.141 142 However, given the
rise in resistance to this antibiotic, the prevalence must be taken
into account.
Third-line therapy.
Statement 18: After failure of second-line therapy, treatment should be guided by
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whenever possible.
Evidence level: 4 Grade of recommendation: A
The recommendation is the same as in areas of low clarithromycin resistance.
Treatment options in patients with penicillin allergy
Statement 19: In patients with penicillin allergy, in areas of low clarithromycin
resistance, for a first-line treatment, a PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole combination
may be prescribed and in areas of high clarithromycin resistance, the bismuthcontaining quadruple therapy should be preferred.
As a rescue regimen, in areas of low fluoroquinolone resistance, a levofloxacincontaining regimen (together with a PPI and clarithromycin) represents a second-line
alternative in the presence of penicillin allergy.
Evidence level: 2c Grade of recommendation: B
In this relatively common subgroup of patients, a triple therapy
including a PPI, clarithromycin and metronidazole represents
one of the most frequently recommended regimens in areas of
low clarithromycin resistance.148 A PPI, tetracycline, metronidazole regiment149 is a better alternative in areas with high
clarithromycin resistance, as well as the bismuth-containing
quadruple therapy.
As a rescue treatment, levofloxacin is a good alternative150 but its
efficacy might be jeopardised by high resistance rates in some areas.
Follow-up after H. pylori treatment
Statement 20: The UBT or a laboratory-based validated monoclonal stool test are both
recommended as non-invasive tests for determining the success of eradication
treatment. There is no role for serology.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Statement 21: The time for testing the success of H pylori eradication after the end of
treatment should be at least 4 weeks.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B

has been diagnosed, follow-up is necessary with upper digestive
endoscopy and then biopsy-based tests can be performed for

confirmation of H pylori eradication. In other situations,
a non-invasive test is used.
There is now overwhelming evidence that UBT is an excellent
test for follow-up after H pylori eradication.76 The discussion
concerns the timing after the end of eradication treatment. The
relapse rate seen in the 6 months or the year after H pylori eradication is mainly related to recurrence of the same infection rather
than a true reinfection. The proposed period of 4 weeks has therefore been questioned and proposals have been made to extend it to 6
or 8 weeks. However, recent data do not support this proposal.
Statement 22: (1) In uncomplicated duodenal ulcer (DU), prolonging acid inhibition with
PPI is not recommended after H pylori treatment.
Level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
(2) In gastric ulcers (GUs) and complicated DUs, prolonging PPI is recommended.
Level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
H pylori is the key factor in peptic ulcer development and
eradication is recommended for both DUs and GUs, as it has
been shown that H pylori eradication effectively achieves ulcer
healing rates of >90%.151 152 Moreover, prolonged acid inhibition with PPI is not required after successful H pylori eradication
in uncomplicated DU.153 154
On the other hand, data on the need to prolong PPI for GU
healing after successful eradication are controversial.154e156
GU requires longer acid inhibition for healing than DU and
endoscopic follow-up is needed to ensure complete GU healing.
H pylori eradication should be confirmed in GU. However,
prolonged PPI is also beneficial for improving healing when
eradication has failed. Similarly, studies on complicated DU and
GU also recommend prolonged PPI treatment after eradication.157 158 Therefore, PPI treatment should be continued after
eradication treatment in GU until complete healing is achieved
and in complicated DU until H pylori eradication is confirmed.
Statement 23: H pylori eradication treatment should be started at reintroduction of oral
feeding in cases of bleeding ulcer.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
Bleeding is a common and severe complication of peptic ulcer
disease. It is well established that H pylori eradication can
effectively prevent bleeding recurrence in infected patients.3 159
As the effect of PPI in preventing recurrent bleeding seems to be
greater in H pylori-positive patients, the possibility of leaving H
pylori infection untreated until the ulcer is completely healed has
been hypothesised.160 However, it has been shown that H pylori
infection/eradication has no effect on early rebleeding rate in
patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after endoscopic haemostasis.161 162 On the other hand, delaying treatment to after
discharge leads to reduced compliance or loss to follow-up
without receiving treatment.163 Based on a decision analytic
model, it has been recently proposed that empirical treatment of
H pylori infection in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, immediately after feeding is restarted, is the most cost-effective
strategy for preventing recurrent haemorrhage.164 The most
influential variable in this analysis was the prevalence of H pylori
infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. In patients with
peptic ulcer bleeding the prevalence of H pylori infection appears
to be lower than in patients with uncomplicated peptic ulcer
disease, varying, in recent European studies, from 43% to 56%,
possibly explained by NSAID use.165
In areas of low H pylori infection, instead of an empirical
treatment, a test-and-treat strategy should be considered. In the
setting of peptic ulcer bleeding, histology and rapid urease test
maintain a high specificity, but are affected by a low sensitivity,
possibly leading to undertreatment.166 167 Serology seems not to
be influenced by upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and has
been recommended in this setting by previous Maastricht
consensus reports. The accuracy of the UBT remains very high in
these patients, despite PPI treatment.168 Current consensus in
upper gastrointestinal bleeding recommends performing
a delayed test, 4d8 weeks after the bleeding episode.169

PREVENTION OF GASTRIC CANCER AND OTHER
COMPLICATIONS (WORKSHOP 3)
Statement 1: H pylori infection is the most consistent risk factor for gastric cancer. Its
elimination is therefore the most promising strategy to reduce the incidence of gastric
cancer
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Based on unequivocal scientific evidence, this statement was
first released in the Maastricht 3 consensus report and has since
been adopted by several international guidelines, including
a recent S3-guideline.3 170e172 Scientific data collected since then
reinforce the statement that H pylori infection is the most
common proven risk factor for human non-cardiac gastric
cancer.
The evidence is based on epidemiological data, experimental
models in vitro and in vivo. There is biological plausibility from
clinical observations and in therapeutic trials.173 174
In the original epidemiological reports the risk for non-cardiac
gastric cancer in H pylori infection was estimated to be threefold
but based on more accurate methodologies and with proper
controls epidemiological studies indicate the risk to be 20-fold or
even higher.84 175 H pylori is confirmed to be a risk factor if the
lesion is gastric in nature and to originate from below the
cardia.176
In vivo experimental models have demonstrated the causal
role of H pylori infection in the cascade leading to gastric
cancer.40 177 The transgenic expression of IL-1b (a proinflammatory and acid-suppressive cytokine) in parietal cells lead
to spontaneous gastritis, mobilisation of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells and gastric dysplasia. These lesions progress to
carcinoma when infected with Helicobacter felis.
178 In a mouse
model of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer bone marrowderived cells were implicated as the potential origin for gastric
cancer.179
Observational and controlled trials
Eradication treatment is effective in preventing gastric cancer if
it is given before preneoplastic conditions/ lesions have had
time to develop. Intervention studies completed in
Columbia,180 China181 and Japan182 all suggest that H pylori
eradication is the most effective approach to gastric cancer
prevention, but that it is more effective in those who do not
have atrophic gastritis or IM at baseline. A pooled analysis of
six studies with a total of 6695 (mostly Asian) participants
followed up for 4e10 years showed that the RR for gastric
cancer after H pylori eradication was 0.65 (95% CI 0.43 to
0.98).183 After eradication a significant reduction in cancer
incidence was seen only in subjects with normal serum
pepsinogen levels. This suggests that cancers developing after
eradication are related to the presence of extensive atrophic
gastritis present before the eradication treatment was given.
H pylori eradication is beneficial in most subjects who have
normal serum pepsinogen I and those with only mild
atrophy.184
Early eradication of H pylori in gastric cancer prevention has
also been shown to be successful in experimental studies using
Mongolian gerbils and mice.185 186
Statement 2: There is strong evidence that H pylori infection exerts direct mutagenic
effects in animal models and cell lines.
Evidence level: not quotable Grade of recommendation: C
H pylori causes direct mutagenic effects in mice.187 188 This is
related to the duration of infection and the gender of the
animal.189 Genetic instability of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
has also been reported in studies conducted on gastric cell
lines.190 191 H pylori causes preneoplastic lesions and cancer in
experimental in vivo models, demonstrating the causal role of H
pylori infection in the cascade leading to gastric cancer. The most
important single carcinogenic factor of H pylori may be CagA,
which is injected by the bacteria into the host mucosal epithelial
cells. Recently, transgenic expression of CagA has been shown to
lead to carcinoma in the absence of coexisting gastritis in mice.
This indicates that CagA is a bacterial oncogene.192
There is no supportive human evidence to date, mainly
because transgenic CagA expression is too artificial to be
extrapolated into the human situation.
Statement 3: The risk for gastric cancer development is influenced by bacterial
virulence factors, but no specific bacterial virulence markers can be recommended for
clinical practice.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
Among bacterial pathogenetic factors that carry an increased
risk for gastric cancer, CagA and VacA75 193 194 are by far the
most important.
The oncogenic potential of bacterial virulence factors relates
to distinct polymorphisms of CagA and VacA.195e197 EPIYA
repeats of CagA enable differentiation to be made between
Eastern and Western CagA-positive strains. This work indicates
that Eastern strains have a much higher virulence than Western
ones. The importance of geographical variability in the oncogenic potential of bacterial virulence is reflected by the difference
in cancer incidence.198 199
Statement 4: The risk of gastric cancer is influenced by host genetic factors but in
clinical practice no specific marker can be recommended for genetic testing at present.
Evidence level: 1b Grade of recommendation: A
The impact of a familial risk driven by the presence of H pylori
infection is well established200 and is associated with host
cytokine gene polymorphisms. The first observation of a polymorphism leading to an increased risk of atrophy and gastric
cancer was IL-1b. Since then other genes have been reported
in this context, including tumour necrosis factor a, IL-10,
interferon g, IL-8.201e203
Studies in a variety of geographical areas have shown wide
variation in the OR for gastric cancer development that is
related to altered gene expression of defined cytokine
haplotypes.204e206
Also, polymorphisms of immune regulatory genes, including
pattern recognition factors initiating the innate immune system,
are reported to be associated with an increased risk for gastric
cancer.207
Statement 5: The influence of environmental factors is subordinate to the effect of
H pylori infection.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
A number of nutritional and environmental elements
contribute to the development of gastric cancer to various
degrees. They include N-nitroso compounds, sodium and salted
foods, tobacco, alcohol and others.208e213 There is a strong
association between smoking and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma.

In contrast, the association between smoking and gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma is less consistent.212 Most studies
analysing the relationship between gastric cancer and environmental factors have not dealt with the presence or absence of
H pylori infection.
Some nutritional substrates are claimed to provide some
degree of protection against gastric cancer but there is little
prospective evidence to support this.214 215 The essential information gathered from a more recent European study is that the
effect of all nutritional components is strictly dependent on the
presence of H pylori infection and that nutrition has only a small
contributing role in the absence of the infection.216 217
In October 2009, the International Agency for Research on
Cancer, which forms part of the World Health Organization, classified acetaldehyde included in, and generated endogenously from,
alcoholic beverages as a group I human carcinogen. This compound
is found in alcoholic beverages and is also generated endogenously
from them. Acetaldehyde which is also related to H pylori is a relevant carcinogen especially in patients with atrophic gastritis.218
Regular NSAID intake may be beneficial in preventing gastric
cancer. There is some evidence for this in patients with gastric
ulcer, particularly in those infected by H pylori.
A recent meta-analysis concluded that the regular use of
aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of non-cardiac gastric
cancer, especially among Caucasians.219
Statement 6: Histopathological changes at the morphological level indicate that:
1. gastric cancer is rare in the absence of chronic active gastritis;
2. the extent and severity of the gastritis together with atrophy and IM is positively
associated with cancer.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: A
Gastric cancer is a multistep and multifactorial disease. H pylori
infection is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of
chronic gastritis42 43 220 and is an essential factor in 71e95% of all
gastric cancers.84 H pylori induces chronic active gastritis in all
those infected.221 Patients with corpus-dominant H pylori gastritis
are at a substantially increased risk for gastric cancer.222 Prospective data indicate that H pylori-infected subjects with atrophy and
IM (5e6 3 risk), pan-gastritis (15 3 risk) and corpus-dominant
gastritis (34 3 risk) have a significantly increased risk developing
gastric cancer.223 IM and atrophy are indicators of an increased risk
of malignant transformation and serve as precancerous markers.224
IM, which occurs as a result of H pylori infection and after the
development of atrophic gastritis,225 is common in the human
stomach and is associated with an increased risk of gastric
cancer.226 227 Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is often preceded or
accompanied by metaplastic changes, whereas diffuse-type
adenocarcinoma can arise in non-metaplastic gastric mucosa.
However, some cases of intestinal-type adenocarcinoma do arise
from the gastric mucosa without IM.228
Less than 1% of gastric carcinomas can be attributed to
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. This is an autosomal dominant
condition and is not related to H pylori infection or gastritis. The
lifetime risk for gastric carcinoma for individuals with mutation
of the CDH-1 gene is 40e70% for men and 60e80% for
women.229e232
Statement 7: Mechanisms at the functional level indicate:
1. atrophic corpus gastritis causes hypochlorhydria;
2. hypochlorhydria allows the overgrowth of non-H pylori organisms that are capable of
producing metabolites with a carcinogenic potential.
Evidence level: 2c Grade of recommendation: A
There is direct and indirect evidence of atrophic corpus
gastritis leading to hypochlorhydria.233 Patients with a hypochlorhydria have an overgrowth of salivary and faecal-type
organisms in the gastric lumen. Studies that have compared
individuals receiving acid suppression or after truncal vagotomy
with controls confirm that hypochlorhydria also leads to bacterial overgrowth. Some of these organisms can reduce nitrate to
nitrite, causing a rise in intraluminal nitrite. Nitrosating bacteria
present in the lumen are capable of generating potentially
carcinogenic N-nitrosamines and reactive oxygen species.234e240
Overgrowth in several bacterial species cohabiting with
H pylori has been shown in conditions of hypochlorhydria and
pharmacological acid suppression.241 242
The hypochlorhydric stomach contains reduced or absent
concentrations of the free oxygen scavenger ascorbic acid.
Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant that scavenges carcinogenic
N-nitrosamines and reactive oxygen species. It is concentrated in
the gastric mucosa, and in the healthy stomach luminal
concentrations are higher than in plasma. Infection with H pylori
causes the luminal concentration to fall. In the achlorhydric
stomach it disappears almost completely.243e249
Statement 8: H pylori eradication abolishes the inflammatory response and slows or
may arrest the progression of atrophy. In some cases it may reverse atrophy.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
In the absence of preneoplastic conditions successful H pylori
eradication restores the inflamed gastric mucosa to normal. The
active inflammatory process characterised by infiltration with
polymorphonuclear cells is usually abolished within 4 weeks but
chronic inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration often
persists for up to 1 year.250
The changes associated with atrophy do regress to a certain
extent, but reports are conflicting.46 251 252 Data are limited
because usually only a small number of biopsy specimens have
been taken and this may lead to observer bias in its assessment.
A recent meta-analysis indicated that gastric atrophy may be
reversible only in the corpus, but not in the antrum. There is
uniform agreement that IM is irreversible.46 250 251 253e266
Statement 9: There is strong evidence that H pylori eradication reduces the risk of
gastric cancer development.
Evidence level: 1c Grade of recommendation: A
The plausibility of H pylori eradication in the prevention of
gastric cancer was initially suggested based on the evidence
obtained from epidemiological and interventional studies in
animals and from observational studies in humans.42 Randomised controlled trials have further proved the beneficial effect
of H pylori eradication on preneoplastic conditions43 44 180 and in
primary and secondary gastric cancer prevention.45 267 Moreover,
several important cohort studies have all confirmed the positive
effect of H pylori eradication in the prevention of gastric
cancer,182 184 223 268e272 and related aspects have been critically
evaluated in meta-analyses183 251 and reviews.252 273
Statement 10: The risk of gastric cancer can be reduced more effectively by employing
eradication treatment before the development of preneoplastic conditions.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: A
A number of cohort studies have shown a decreased risk of
gastric cancer development after H pylori eradication. A recent
meta-analysis demonstrated that H pylori eradication leads to
the reduction of gastric cancer risk.183 In one study a significant

reduction of gastric cancer after treatment was shown only in
the group without preneoplastic conditions (lesions).45 Early
eradication of H pylori was shown to prevent gastric cancer in
patients with peptic ulcer disease.182 272 The more advanced the
preneoplastic condition is the more likely it is that the development of gastric cancer cannot be halted.172 274 The exact point
of no return has not been identified.
Statement 11: H pylori eradication for gastric cancer prevention is cost-effective in
certain communities with a high risk for gastric cancer.
Evidence level: 3 Grade of recommendation: B
The incidence of gastric cancer differs widely between populations and there is a wide range in the prevalence of H pylori
infection between children and adults.275 When considering
a H pylori eradication strategy, differences in H pylori virulence
factors must be taken into account together with the effects
of global population migration patterns and the available
healthcare resources.
Screening young adults for H pylori could prevent one in every
four to six gastric cancers in China and would represent a costeffective strategy.276 In selected populations at very high risk of
developing gastric cancer (eg, resected early gastric cancer),
H pylori eradication should be reimbursed to prevent subsequent
cancer and in order to reduce healthcare costs.277 Early once-in-alifetime H pylori eradication is more cost-effective than
a surveillance strategy. However, this approach is still subject to
the risk of reinfection, the ability to detect early gastric cancer
and the timing of intervention.278 H pylori eradication for gastric
cancer prevention is cost-effective in certain communities at
high risk for gastric cancer.
Statement 12: H pylori eradication offers additional clinical and financial benefits in
addition to gastric cancer prevention.
Evidence level: varies with disease
(1a to 4)
Grade of recommendation: A
H pylori eradication treatment offers additional clinical and
financial benefits besides gastric cancer prevention, as outlined in
the section on indications.
Eradication prevents future H pylori-induced peptic ulceration of the stomach and/or duodenum.279 Patients with GI
risk factors taking ASS are often not provided with concomitant gastroprotective drugs and thus at increased risk for
mucosal lesions in the presence of H. pylori.280 Furthermore,
because prophylactic eradication reduces the risk of ASS, ulcer
eradication indirectly prevents possible interaction between
PPIs and dual antiplatelet treatment.281 Eradication treatment
reduces the risk of FD and prevents gastric MALT lymphoma.
Iron-deficiency anaemia, ITP, lymphocytic gastritis and
Morbus Menetrier may be prevented by eradication treatment
as well. Finally, H pylori eradication heals gastritis (ICD-10)
and may prevent the spread of the infection and reduces
future costs arising from treatment of later H pylori associated
disease. One prospective study has shown that a community
test-and-treat policy in a developed country would pay for
itself over 10 years.282e284
Statement 13: A screen-and-treat strategy of H pylori should be explored in
communities with a significant burden of gastric cancer
Evidence level: 2c Grade of recommendation: A
Population-based screening is probably the best option for the
primary prevention of gastric cancer. However, there are large
differences in incidence between populations and this is mainly
attributable to differences in H pylori virulence and dietary
factors.199 217 285 The Asian-Pacific consensus172 has already
recommended a policy of H pylori eradication in populations at
high risk of gastric cancer. This approach should be considered in
other high-risk areas around the world, including Europe.
Statement 14: Validated serological tests for H pylori and markers of atrophy
(ie, pepsinogens) are the best available non-invasive tests to identify subjects at high
risk of gastric cancer.
Evidence level: 1a Grade of recommendation: B
Measurement of serum pepsinogen I detects severe preneoplastic conditions (ie, severe atrophy) and has gained attention
as a candidate screening test for gastric cancer.286 Most cases
detected by the pepsinogen method in Japan are asymptomatic
early gastric cancers limited to the mucosa and these are
particularly well suited for endoscopic treatment.287 288
Serological screening is suitable for clinical use in countries
with a relatively low incidence of gastric cancer because it
enables endoscopic follow-up of cases with an abnormal serological profile suggestive of atrophic gastritis.289 Regionally
validated serological testing for H pylori and markers of atrophy
(ie, pepsinogens) together are therefore the best non-invasive

tests to identify subjects at high risk for gastric cancer. Subjects
with severe gastric atrophy, in whom H pylori has disappeared
and who are therefore serologically negative for H pylori, are at
a particularly high risk.
The combination of H pylori infection and atrophic gastritis
determined by serological examination is suitable for the
identification of subjects with a high risk of gastric cancer.
Statement 15: Risk stratification of patients with premalignant gastric conditions is
useful and should be based on the severity and distribution of lesions.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
Patients with preneoplastic changes of the gastric mucosa are
at an increased risk of developing gastric cancer.274 H pylori
eradication treatment has the potential to prevent gastric cancer.
However, recent reports after long-term follow-up have
suggested that H pylori eradication does not prevent gastric
cancer development in all infected patients, especially in those
who have preneoplastic changes of the gastric mucosa before
eradication treatment is given.45 Therefore, risk stratification of
patients with premalignant gastric conditions is useful and
should be based on the severity and distribution of lesions.
The gastritis OLGA-staging conveys useful information on
the potential clinicopathological outcome of the gastritisdin
particular, the likelihood of progression to gastric cancer. The
adoption of this system is therefore useful for patient management. According to OLGA-staging and H pylori status, patients
with gastritis can be confidently stratified and managed
according to their cancer risk. This has been shown for separate
populations with different gastric cancer risk.290e292 More
recently the OLGIM histological staging has been shown to be
of similar value. In this histological system IM is used as the
preneoplastic marker instead of atrophy.293
Statement 16: H pylori eradication to prevent gastric cancer should be considered in
the following:
first-degree relatives of family members with a diagnosis of gastric cancer;
patients with previous gastric neoplasia already treated by endoscopic or subtotal
gastric resection;
patients with a risk of gastritis: severe pan-gastritis, corpus-predominant gastritis,
severe atrophy;
patients with chronic gastric acid inhibition for more than 1 year;
patients with strong environmental risk factors for gastric cancer (heavy smoking, high
exposure to dust, coal, quartz, cement and/or work in quarries);
H pylori-positive patients with a fear of gastric cancer.
Evidence level: 1a to 4 Grade of recommendation: A
H pylori eradication to prevent gastric cancer should be
undertaken in patients at high risk. A first-degree relative of a
family member with a diagnosis of gastric cancer is at high
risk.294 First- degree relatives have a two to three times increased
risk of developing gastric cancer.295e300 If more than one firstdegree relative has contracted gastric cancer the risk for others is
increased by a factor of 10. Patients with the CDH-1 mutation
should be offered genetic consultation and prophylactic
gastrectomy.301e307
There is an absolute indication for eradication treatment in
patients at high risk, but they also require follow-up. Patients
who have had a previous gastric operation, prior gastric
neoplasia (MALT lymphoma, adenoma, cancer), pan-gastritis,
corpus-dominant gastritis and in conjunction with IM and
atrophy are all at high risk.308e311
Patients who have been receiving acid inhibition for >1 year
and those who will be given long-term acid inhibition for
>1 year are at increased risk.312 Patients exposed to one or more
strong environmental risk factors for gastric cancer such as
heavy smoking, a high exposure to dust, coal, quartz, cement
and/or work in quarries and those who live in a geographical
area with a high incidence of gastric cancer should undergo
eradication treatment.172 313 314
Finally, H pylori-positive patients with fear of gastric cancer
should receive eradication treatment.
Statement 17: H pylori eradication to prevent gastric cancer should be undertaken in
populations at high risk.
Evidence level: 1c Grade of recommendation: A
H pylori infection is a necessary but not sufficient cause for
gastric cancer. Recent H pylori guidelines recommend population
screening and treatment for H pylori in high-risk regions.172 This
strategy would be cost-effective where gastric cancer rates are
high and most effective before the development of gastric
atrophy. H pylori eradication for gastric cancer prevention should
be undertaken in populations at high risk.
Statement 18: Factors to be considered for prevention strategies include:
the incidence of gastric cancer in the community to be targeted;
likely future trends in cancer incidence if intervention is not employed;
the availability of primary care facilities and other logistics;
the likely compliance of the chosen population;
the availability of funding;
the possibility of retesting and re-treatment in the event of eradication failure.
Evidence level: not quotable Grade of recommendation: A
Several factors should be considered when identifying populations in whom a prevention strategy is planned. The incidence
of gastric cancer in the community to be targeted is relevant.199
The likely future trends in the incidence of gastric cancer if
intervention is not provided must be considered and the general
availability of primary care facilities and other logistics such as
funding are also important.315e317
The likely compliance of the target population is another factor
to be taken into consideration. Reinfection with H pylori after
eradication is rare in developed countries but more common in
developing countries at around 13%. So the need for retesting and
re-treatment in the event of eradication failure or reinfection must
be kept in mind when considering a preventive strategy.318
Statement 19: The antibiotic combination should be chosen according to local H pylori
antibiotic resistance patterns.
Evidence level: 2b Grade of recommendation: B
Antibiotic resistance is the most important factor responsible
for the falling success rate of H pylori eradication treatment.319 320
Local surveillance of H pylori antibiotic resistance is mandatory
and the antibiotic combination for H pylori eradication treatment should be chosen according to the local resistance patterns.
A wider range of effective treatments is urgently required.
Statement 20: Vaccination would be the best option for eliminating H pylori infection in
the population. A major effort to develop a vaccine should be made.
Evidence level: 4 Grade of recommendation: A
In 2010, the worldwide prevalence of H pylori infection ranged
between 7% and 87%. The average prevalence in Europe is
around 30%, a high immigration background needs to be taken
into account.321 A vaccination strategy would be the best option
for eliminating H pylori infection in the population.322 A vaccine

treatment. Its potential in humans requires further research.323 324
A major effort should be made to develop a vaccine against H
pylori in humans.
Statement 21: (a) Preneoplastic high-risk conditions require endoscopic follow-up.
(b) Prospective studies are needed to determine the correct timing of follow-up.
Evidence level: 2c Grade of recommendation: A
Patients with high-risk conditions such as atrophic
gastritis and IM are at an increased risk of developing gastric
cancer.17 223 325
Whether these lesions merit endoscopic follow-up and the
optimal timing for this, require evaluation in prospective
studies.
< Preneoplastic conditions to be considered for endoscopic
follow-up
– when there is a firm diagnosis of pernicious anaemia with
histological confirmation of type A autoimmune atrophic
gastritis;
– if there are histological and/or serological signs of subtotal
or total atrophic gastritis with hypo- or achlorhydria;
– if there has been a diagnosis/removal of gastric adenoma(s).

atrophy at 2e3 years intervals and 3e6 month intervals
where there is dysplasia.
