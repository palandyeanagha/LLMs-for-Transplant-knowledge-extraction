Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of
major public health interest. However, studies comparing hepatic resection (HR) and
radio-frequency ablation (RFA) applied to multifocal HCC are limited. This study aimed to
compare the efficacies of HR and RFA in patients with multifocal HCC.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results database between 2004 and 2015. Disease-specific survival and overall
survival rates were assessed before and after propensity score matching (PSM).
Results: In total, 2,201 patients with multifocal HCC treated with HR (n = 1,095) or RFA
(n = 1,106) were included; 1,096 patients were identified after nearest-neighbor PSM at
a ratio of 1:1 (HR: n = 548; RFA: n = 548). In the multivariate Cox regression model,
HR was associated with significantly improved disease-specific survival [before PSM:
hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57–0.79, p < 0.001; after PSM: hazard
ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.82, p < 0.001] and overall survival (before PSM: hazard ratio
0.67, 95% CI 0.58–0.78, p < 0.001; after PSM: hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.59–0.80, p <
0.001) compared to RFA in patients with multifocal HCC. In the survival curve analysis, the
disease-specific survival of the HR group was similar to that of the RFA group before PSM
(p = 0.936, log-rank test) but was significantly longer after PSM (p < 0.001) in all patients.
Multivariate analyses revealed that differentiation grade, alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size,
and tumor extension were independent predictors of poor prognosis in patients with
multifocal HCC.
Conclusions: The long-term survival rate of HR is better than that of RFA in patients with
multifocal HCC. HR may serve as a first-line treatment for patients with multifocal HCC.
The presence of large tumors and vascular invasion are not contraindications for HR.

Yue and Zhou Resection and RFA for HCC
INTRODUCTION
According to global cancer statistics in 2018, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the
fourth primary cause of cancer-related mortality with more than
841,000 newly diagnosed cases, accounting for 5.7% of all cancer
patients, and 781,000 deaths annually, accounting for 8.2% of all
cancer-related deaths (1, 2).
According to the Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer (BCLC)
staging system which is endorsed by the American Association
for the Study of Liver Disease, European Association for the
Study of Liver Disease, and European Society for Medical
Oncology, HCC patients with BCLC very-early-stage (stage
0, single tumor < 2 cm in size) and early-stage (stage A,
no more than three tumors each <3 cm in size) carcinoma
and without major vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis
are recommended to undergo hepatic resection (HR), liver
transplantation, or radio-frequency ablation (RFA). However, for
FIGURE 1 | Flow chart of the sample selection procedure.
patients with BCLC intermediate-stage (stage B) and advancedstage (stage C) disease, trans-arterial chemoembolization is the
first-line therapy; therefore, HR, liver transplantation and RFA
may not be performed (3–5).
Recently, several studies have reported that HR is more
favorable than RFA and trans-arterial chemoembolization
regardless of BCLC stage, which expands the application of HR
to intermediate-stage (stage B) HCC (6–10). Moreover, a recent
study has proven that HR plus RFA resulted in better long-term
survival than trans-arterial chemoembolization in patients with
multifocal HCC with tumors <5 cm or >5 cm in size; however,
their sample size was very small (11). Another study found that
HR plus RFA were superior to HR alone regarding the outcome
of HCC patients; however, only 73 subjects were included (12).
Few studies have directly compared the efficacies of HR and RFA
in multifocal HCC tumors; moreover, some studies have shown
that HR is similar to RFA, while others have suggested that HR
is superior to RFA in multifocal tumors <=3 cm in size (13, 14).

In addition, few studies have focused on the differences in the
outcomes of HR and RFA in multifocal tumors sized 3–5 cm,
and no study has compared the efficacy of HR with that of RFA
in multifocal tumors >5 cm in size, especially in tumors with
extrahepatic metastasis and vascular invasion.
Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database, the biggest cancer surveillance program that covers
∼34.6% of the population in the United States, we conducted
a comprehensive comparison of the efficacies of HR and RFA
applied to multifocal HCC tumors of any size using a large realworld sample. The primary aim of the study was to compare
the effectiveness of HR and RFA in patients with multifocal
HCC, and the secondary aim was to assess confounding factors
influencing survival outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We obtained a case listing of patients with liver cancer from the
SEER program of the National Cancer Institute between 2004 and
2015. Patients were filtered using inclusion criteria as follows:
(1) patients with a primary site code C22.0 and International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition histology
codes 8170-8175, (2) SEER Collaborative Stage (CS) Extension
Codes 390, 400, 420, 440, 630, and 635 for multifocal tumors, and
(3) SEER Surgery of Primary Site Codes 20–26, 30, 36–38, 50–52,
and 59–60 for HR and 16 for RFA. RFA also includes microwave
ablation. We excluded samples based on the following criteria:
(1) the presence of more than one primary cancer, (2) 0 months
of survival, and (3) younger than 18 years old. All patients in
this study were collected from the SEER database, and we signed
the “Data-use Agreement for the SEER 1973–2015 Research Data
File” and received permission.
The primary outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS),
which was the time until death attributed to HCC. The secondary
outcome was overall survival (OS), which was the time until
death caused by any disease. Variables in the analysis were age,
marital status, gender, race, tumor differentiation grade, lymph
nodes, distant metastasis, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, alphafetoprotein (AFP) level, fibrosis score, tumor size, and tumor
extension. Tumor extension indicated the extent of contiguous
growth of the primary tumor within the liver or its direct
extension into neighboring organs. The meaning of tumor
extension are as follows: 390, confined to one lobe without
intrahepatic vascular invasion (IVI); 400, confined to one lobe
with IVI; 420, extension to gallbladder with or without IVI; 440,
extension to multiple lobes or on surface of parenchyma; 630,
confined to one lobe with major vascular invasion (MVI); 635,
extension to multiple lobes or on surface of liver parenchyma,
with MVI.
We categorized patients by tumor size using 2, 3, and 5 cm
as cut-off values. We selected these cut-offs, because some
guidelines maintain that RFA is the first-line therapy rather than
HR for tumors sized <2 cm (BCLC stage 0) and <3 cm (BCLC
stage A) (3–5, 15). Additionally, some studies insist that RFA is
more beneficial for tumors <5 cm in diameter, while others argue
that HR is preferable to RFA for tumors 2–5 cm in size (13, 16).
Moreover, we also wanted to compare the efficacies of HR and
RFA for multifocal tumors >5 cm in size.
Statistical Analyses
We used nearest-neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) at
a ratio of 1:1 and dropped 50 percent of the HR observations
at which the propensity score density of the RFA observations is
the lowest by applying “psmatch2” command with the option of
“common trim(50).” Finally, all the variables achieved a complete
balance between the HR and RFA groups.
All statistical analyses and figure rendering were carried out
using STATA software, version 15 (StataCorp, College Station,
Texas). The demographic and clinical characteristics between HR
and RFA cases were compared using Pearson’s chi-square test.
Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and the significance of the differences in survival rates was
examined using the log-rank test. We carried out multivariate

Cox proportional hazards regression to explore the efficacy of the
HR and RFA, and control for confounding factors correlating to
DSS and OS. Corresponding hazard ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated from the Cox model, too. A twotailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline Demographic and Clinical
Characteristics
The sample selection procedure was illustrated in Figure 1.
Of the 59,914 patients with HCC between 2004 and 2015,
we obtained 2,201 patients meeting inclusion criteria for final
analysis. Of them, 1,106 cases underwent RFA and 1,095
underwent HR; after PSM, there were both 548 cases in RFA and
HR groups.
The baseline demographic and clinical data are presented
in Table 1. Before PSM, the RFA group contained more young
patients; had a higher proportion of divorced, widowed, or
separated persons; had a higher percentage of men, white people,
and patients with unknown tumor differentiation grade; had
a higher level of alpha-fetoprotein; were more likely to have
liver cirrhosis and smaller tumor size; more likely to undergo
chemotherapy; and had a higher proportion of people with
tumor extension 390 and 440 than the HR group. After PSM,
all variables were completely balanced between the HR and
RFA groups.
Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards
Regression of Disease-Specific Survival
and Overall Survival
In the Cox analysis of DSS, before PSM, patients who underwent
HR had a significantly longer survival outcome than did those
who underwent RFA (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.57–0.79, p
< 0.001). Lower tumor differentiation grades, higher alphafetoprotein level, bigger tumor size, and higher tumor extension
were all significantly correlated with poor prognosis. After
PSM, HR was still associated with prolonged survival (hazard
ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.82, p < 0.001) compared to RFA.
Lower tumor differentiation grades, higher alpha-fetoprotein
level, bigger tumor size, and higher tumor extension remained
significantly associated with worse survival (Table 2).
In the Cox analysis of OS, before PSM, patients in the HR
group had significantly improved survival than those in the RFA
group (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.58–0.78, p < 0.001). Similarly,
after PSM, patients treated with HR had a better prognosis
than did those treated with RFA (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI
0.59–0.80, p < 0.001). Moreover, tumor differentiation grade,
alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor size, and tumor extension were all
significantly associated with survival both before and after PSM
(Table 3).
Survival Curve Analysis of
Disease-Specific Survival
Among all the patients, the long-term survival rate of the HR
group was not significantly different from that of the RFA group
(p = 0.936, log-rank test). However, after PSM, we observed a
significant improvement in the survival rate in patients treated
with HR (p = 0.003) (Figure 2).
Subgroup Survival Curve Analysis of
Disease-Specific Survival After Propensity
Score Matching
Because the effect size of HR was very similar for DSS and OS, we
only analyzed the DSS survival curve. We conducted a KaplanMeier survival curve analysis and log-rank test stratified by tumor
differentiation grade, tumor size, and extension.
Within each subgroup of tumor differentiation grade, the
survival rate of the HR group was higher than that of the RFA
group, but only the difference in the moderate differentiation
subgroup was statistically significant (p = 0.015) (Figure 3).
In patients with tumors sized 3–5 cm and >5 cm, HR was
significantly associated with a higher survival rate (p < 0.001
and p = 0.041, respectively). There was no notable difference
in prognosis between patients who underwent HR and RFA for
tumors 0–2 and 2–3 cm in diameter (Figure 4).

In patients with tumor extension 390, 630, and 635, HR led to
significantly prolonged survival compared to RFA (p = 0.008, p
= 0.025, and p < 0.001, respectively). However, in patients with
other tumor extensions, HR resulted in a comparable survival
rate with RFA (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
In this investigation, we evaluated the efficacies of HR and RFA in
patients with multifocal HCC with the presence of big tumor size
and vascular invasion. We found that HR was superior to RFA
for the treatment of multifocal HCC sized 3–5 cm and larger than
5 cm, while HR had comparable efficacy with RFA for multifocal
HCC sized 0–2 and 2–3 cm.
Generally, HR and RFA are recommended as primary
therapies for very-early- and early-stage HCC; however, the
efficacies of HR and RFA applied to multifocal HCC tumors have
not been adequately elucidated. In our study, we adjusted for age,
race, marital status, tumor differentiation grade, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, distant
metastasis, and tumor extension. Tumor extension indicates the
status of tumor invasion into both lobes, intrahepatic vascular,

PSM did not affect the effectiveness of HR on DSS and OS. We
found that HR was a more favorable treatment modality for
patients with multifocal HCC than RFA, which was consistent

with the findings of other studies of non-multifocal HCC with
similar tumor size (9, 10, 13, 14, 22, 23).
As a non-invasive treatment, RFA is recommended as the firstline treatment by the American Association for the Study of Liver
Disease, European Association for the Study of Liver Disease, and
European Society for Medical Oncology for HCC of BCLC stage
0 and A. Recently, the application of RFA has expanded to tumors
sized >5 cm, and it is considered to be as favorable as stereotactic
body radiotherapy for BCLC advanced-stage HCC, while the
application of HR has remained unchanged (24, 25). The efficacy
of RFA is affected by tumor size, the number of nodules and
the location of the tumors, and it may not be applicable for
multifocal tumors in a central location or those invading both
lobes (5). Our study proved that RFA was associated with a
worse prognosis in most patients as compared with HR after
considering multifocality, tumor size and vascular invasion.
According to some studies, RFA and HR have similar efficacies
for single tumors smaller than 2 cm without macrovascular
invasion or extrahepatic metastasis. Although the sample sizes
of these studies were small and the multifocality status of the
participants was unknown, they did reveal the potential feasibility
of HR for tumors <2 cm (26, 27). In our study which focused
on patients with multifocal HCC, we also found HR led to
a similar survival outcome as RFA in patients with tumors
sized <3 cm; however, HR resulted in a considerable survival
advantage over RFA among patients with HCC tumors sized 3–
5 and >5 cm. In patients with tumors larger than 3 cm in size
but not exceeding 5 cm, those who underwent HR had a superior
outcome compared to those who underwent RFA in both the
multivariate regression and subgroup analysis, consistent with
previous research (13, 14, 22, 28). Moreover, a novel finding of
our study was that HR was a valuable treatment modality superior
to RFA for multifocal HCC sized larger than 5 cm. In summary,
the efficacy of HR maintained robust with increasing tumor size,
while the efficacy of RFA declined, which was probably due to that
large tumors raise the possibility of excessive distance from the

In our study, HR included wedge resection, segmental
resection, lobectomy and hepatectomy, because there is no
prognostic difference between anatomical and non-anatomical
HR for HCC according to published literature (29, 30). For
multifocal HCC, a large part of the liver will be excised by
HR, resulting in a higher risk of liver function loss, especially

in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic failure is the most severe
complication of HR; however, conservative treatment following
HR can result in recovery. Studies have argued that HR
could result in a long survival time even for HCC in BCLC
intermediate-stage, with the presence of distant metastasis and
portal vascular invasion, but multifocality was not mentioned
(28, 31, 32). Until now, data for survival outcomes related to
the treatment of multifocal HCC have been limited. The present
study proved that HR is superior to RFA for multifocal HCC
tumors, which extended the application of HR for multifocal
HCC tumors from early-stage to advanced-stage and validated
the expandability of HR (14, 33).
Our multivariate Cox analyses to identify prognostic factors in
multifocal HCC patients came to similar conclusions as previous
studies that level of AFP and vascular invasion were independent
predictors of prognosis. Patients with higher levels of AFP and
vascular invasion had significantly worse outcomes than did
other patients (7, 17, 30). Vascular invasion as a poor prognostic
factor is because vascular invasion is attributed to the recurrence
of HCC, which is the primary inducement of postoperative
death. According to this study together with other published
researches (7, 8, 26), we could conclude vascular invasion was not
a contraindication of performing HR in patients with multifocal
HCC. Besides, patients with HCC with macrovascular invasion
could benefit significantly from HR according to multivariate
model as well as subgroup analysis.
A previous study showed that patients younger than 65 years
with tumors could benefit more from HR than RFA; however,
it did not take into consideration lymph nodes, multifocality,
distant metastasis, and vascular invasion (16). By accepting
these characteristics into account in our study, we identified a
significant disparity between the prognosis associated with HR
and RFA. However, age did not affect the effectiveness of HR and
RFA in our research.
This study has some limitations. First, many of the factors
involved in determining the course of treatment were not
captured in the SEER registry, including patient performance,
physician recommendations, comorbidities and proximity to
treatment providers, which could have biased the treatment
allocation (34). Second, the information on details about HR
and RFA procedures such as resection margin status, rate
of satisfactory ablation, the frequency used and temperature
achieved for ablation, as well as complications were all not
recorded in the SEER database; however, those were very
important confounding factors for assessing the effectiveness
of HR and RFA. Finally, the tumor extension does indicate
tumor growth, but it does not contain the exact number of
nodules, the accurate location of tumors within both lobes,
and the comprehensive position of vascular invaded by tumors.
Therefore, we could not consider these characteristics within
PSM in our analysis.
Despite its limitations, our study adds to our understanding
of the efficacy of HR and RFA for multifocal HCC. HR could
lead to a promising prognosis in patients with multifocal
HCC. Further prospective studies are needed to verify the
survival benefits of HR over RFA in patients with multifocal
HCC, controlling for the status of resection margin, rate of
satisfactory ablation, frequency used for ablation, number of
nodules, tumor size, vascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and
simultaneous resection.
