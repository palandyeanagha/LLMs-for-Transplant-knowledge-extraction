ABSTRACT
Machine learning is where a machine (i.e., computer) determines for itself how input data is 
processed and predicts outcomes when provided with new data. An artificial neural network 
is a machine learning algorithm based on the concept of a human neuron. The purpose of 
this review is to explain the fundamental concepts of artificial neural networks.
Keywords: Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Neural Networks; Deep Learning
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MACHINE 
LEARNING AND A COMPUTER PROGRAM?
A computer program takes input data, processes the data, and outputs a result. A 
programmer stipulates how the input data should be processed. In machine learning, input 
and output data is provided, and the machine determines the process by which the given 
input produces the given output data.1-3 This process can then predict the unknown output 
when new input data is provided.1-3
So, how does machine determine the process? Consider a linear model, y = Wx + b. If we are 
given the x and y values shown in Table 1, we know intuitively that W = 2 and b = 0.
However, how does a computer know what W and b are? W and b are randomly generated 
initially. For example, if we initially say W = 1 and b = 0 and input the x values from Table 1, the

predicted y values do not match the y values in the Table 1. At this point, there is a difference 
between the correct y values and the predicted y values; the machine gradually adjusts the 
values of W and b to reduce this difference. The difference between the predicted values and 
the correct values is called the cost function. Minimizing the cost function makes predictions 
closer to the correct answers.4-7
The costs that correspond to given W and b values are shown in the Fig. 1 (obtained from 
https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/general_concepts/gradient-optimization/).8-10
Given the current values of W and b, the gradient is obtained. If the gradient is positive, 
the values of W and b are decreased. If the gradient is negative, the values of W and b are 
increased. In other words, the values of W and b determined by the derivative of the cost 
function.8-10
ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
The basic unit by which the brain works is a neuron. Neurons transmit electrical signals 
(action potentials) from one end to the other.11 That is, electrical signals are transmitted from 
the dendrites to the axon terminals through the axon body. In this way, the electrical signals 
continue to be transmitted across the synapse from one neuron to another. The human brain 
has approximately 100 billion neurons.11,12 It is difficult to imitate this level of complexity with 
existing computers. However, Drosophila have approximately 100,000 neurons, and they are 
able to find food, avoid danger, survive, and reproduce.13 Nematodes have 302 neurons and 
they survive well.14 This is a level of complexity that can be replicated well even with today's 
computers. However, nematodes can perform much better than our computers.
Let's think of the operative principles of neurons. Neurons receive signals and generate other 
signals. That is, they receive input data, perform some processing, and give an output.11,12
However, the output is not given at a constant rate; the output is generated when the input

exceeds a certain threshold.15 The function that receives an input signal and produces an 
output signal after a certain threshold value is called an activation function.11,15 As shown 
in Fig. 2, when the input value is small, the output value is 0, and once the input value rises 
above the threshold value, a non-zero output value suddenly appears. Thus, the responses of 
biological neurons and artificial neurons (nodes) are similar. However, in reality, artificial 
neural networks use various functions other than activation functions, and most of them use 
sigmoid functions.4,6 which are also called logistic functions. The sigmoid function has the 
advantage that it is very simple to calculate compared to other functions. Currently, artificial 
neural networks predominantly use a weight modification method in the learning process.4,5,7
In the course of modifying the weights, the entire layer requires an activation function that 
can be differentiated. This is because the step function cannot be used as it is. The sigmoid 
function is expressed as the following equation.6,16
Biological neurons receive multiple inputs from pre-synaptic neurons.11 Neurons in artificial 
neural networks (nodes) also receive multiple inputs, then they add them and process the 
sum with a sigmoid function.5,7 The value processed by the sigmoid function then becomes 
the output value. As shown in Fig. 3, if the sum of inputs A, B, and C exceeds the threshold 
and the sigmoid function works, this neuron generates an output value.4
A neuron receives input from multiple neurons and transmits signals to multiple neurons.4,5

The models of biological neurons and an artificial neural network are shown in Fig. 4. 
Neurons are located over several layers, and one neuron is considered to be connected 
to multiple neurons. In an artificial neural network, the first layer (input layer) has input 
neurons that transfer data via synapses to the second layer (hidden layer), and similarly, 
the hidden layer transfers this data to the third layer (output layer) via more synapses.4,5,7
The hidden layer (node) is called the “black box” because we are unable to interpret how an 
artificial neural network derived a particular result.4-6
So, how does a neural network learn in this structure? There are some variables that must 
be updated in order to increase the accuracy of the output values during the learning 
process.4,5,7 At this time, there could be a method of adjusting the sum of the input values or 
modifying the sigmoid function, but it is a rather practical method to adjust the connection 
strength between the neurons (nodes).4,5,7 Fig. 5 is a reformulation of Fig. 4 with the weight 
to be applied to the connection strength. Low weights weaken the signal, and high weights 
enhance the signal.17 The learning part is the process by which the network adjusts the 
weights to improve the output.4,5,7 The weights W1,2, W1,3, W2,3, W2,2, and W3,2 are

emphasized by strengthening the signal due to the high weight. If the weight W is 0, the 
signal is not transmitted, and the network cannot be influenced.
Multiple nodes and connections could affect predicted values and their errors. In this case, 
how do we update the weights to get the correct output, and how does learning work?
The updating of the weights is determined by the error between the predicted output and the 
correct output.4,5,7 The error is divided by the ratio of the weights on the links, and the divided 
errors are back propagated and reassembled (Fig. 6). However, in a hierarchical structure, 
it is extremely difficult to calculate all the weights mathematically. As an alternative, we can 
use the gradient descent method8-10 to reach the correct answer — even if we do not know 
the complex mathematical calculations (Fig. 1). The gradient descent method is a technique 
to find the lowest point at which the cost is minimized in a cost function (the difference 
between the predicted value and the answer obtained by the arbitrarily start weight W). 
Again, the machine can start with any W value and alter it gradually (so that it goes down 
the graph) so that the cost is reduced and finally reaches a minimum. Without complicated 
mathematical calculations, this minimizes the error between the predicted value and the

answer (or it shows that the arbitrary start weight is correct). This is the learning process of 
artificial neural networks.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the learning process of an artificial neural network involves updating the 
connection strength (weight) of a node (neuron). By using the error between the predicted 
value and the correct, the weight in the network is adjusted so that the error is minimized and 
an output close to the truth is obtained.
