C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important mediator and a hallmark of the acute-phase
response to inflammation. High-sensitivity assays that accurately measure levels of CRP
have been recommended for use in risk assessment in ischemic stroke patients. Elevation
of CRP during the acute-phase response in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is also
associated with the outcomes such as death and vascular complications. However, no
association has been found with the increased risk of ICH. The aim of this review is to
synthesize the published literature on the associations of CRP with acute ICH both as
a risk biomarker and predictor of short- and long-term outcomes as well as its role as
a pathogenic determinant. We believe before any clinical utility, a critical appraisal of the
strengths and deficiencies of the accumulated evidence is required both to evaluate the
current state of knowledge and to improve the design of future clinical studies.

INTRODUCTION
Inflammation is recognized to play a major role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease
(1, 2). C-reactive protein (CRP), which is produced in the liver, is a hallmark of the acute
inflammatory response, and represents an extensively studied systemic marker of inflammation
(3). The significance of elevated CRP as a marker of inflammation in the clinical setting has been
suggested in the literature (4–6). Notably, over recent decades CRP has been the focus of an intense
investigation to explore its role in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and currently is
proposed as a risk assessment tool and prognostic marker (7).
The aim of this review is to synthesize the available literature examining the association of
monomeric CRP with acute ICH as a risk assessment biomarker and predictor of short- and
long-term outcomes as well as its role as a pathogenic determinant.
STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF CRP
CRP and serum amyloid P (SAP) component are the main pentraxins (PTX) in humans. PTX
represent an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins mostly involved in immunological
responses. They have a unique pentameric structure and bind to their ligands in a calciumdependent manner (8, 9). CRP and SAP are soluble pattern-recognition proteins of pathogenic

bacteria or damaged cells and, therefore, interact with the
complement pathway and Fcγ receptors to activate the innate
immune system (10, 11). CRP, also known as PTX1, primarily
exists in two structurally and functionally independent forms:
(1) net anti-inflammatory, serum-associated native pentameric
CRP (npCRP), and (2) pro-inflammatory tissue-associated,
monomeric CRP (mCRP) (10, 12).
DEFINITION OF npCRP/mCRP
npCRP is an acute phase PTX produced mainly by the liver in
response to inflammatory infection in humans. It is composed
of five none-covalently linked identical subunits. It is plasmasoluble, and its concentrations are linked to level of systemic
inflammatory response. Serum npCRP concentrations have been
shown to increase from <3 to >100µg/ml within 8–72 h from
the onset of an inflammatory response (13, 14). Its physiological
role is to bind to phosphocholine, expressed on the surface of
dead or dying cells, stimulating the activation of the complement
system via the C1Q complex.
mCRP is a monomer of the parent molecule npCRP.
mCRP is mainly tissue-associated, as its formation requires a
conformational change that renders the protein largely insoluble
(15, 16). The circulating 115 kDa npCRP homopentamer
irreversibly dissociates into 23 kDa monomers upon binding to
pathogenic membranes, damaged or apoptotic cell membranes,
activated platelets, or blood-derived microparticles (MPs).
Due to contact with cells and tissue, it converts to the
monomeric-biological form where it can remain chronically.
Specifically, on contact with cell membranes, npCRP undergoes
an intermediate conformational change through hydrophobic
insertion, maintaining pentameric status but acquiring the
properties of mCRP, this is followed by loss of the pentameric
form by breakage of the intrasubunit disulphide bond. The
reduced form of mCRP (rmCRP), where the intra-subunit
disulphide bridge is broken (e.g., on contact of reducing
agents such as thioredoxin), binds strongly to the cholesterol
binding motif of membrane lipid rafts and actively stimulates
cell signaling, following unlocking of the lipid raft interaction
motif through multiple mechanisms (17). Amongst others,
rmCRP/mCRP has been shown to stimulate inflammation
directly, induce aberrant angiogenesis and promote platelet
activation and aggregation. Importantly, standard clinical high
sensitive (hs)-CRP assays cannot detect mCRP or ureasolubilized mCRP on MPs. hsCRP assays, therefore, can only
measure the portion of total CRP in plasma that is in the
soluble pentameric form (soluble npCRP). Currently, only by
using flow cytometry and antibodies it is possible to measure
both forms of CRP (npCRP and mCRP) on MPs to revealing
a compartment of CRP not currently measured with hs-CRP
technique (18).
ROLE OF CRP IN INFLAMMATION
CRP shows unique properties amongst the PTX family. Thiele
et al. (19) published information showing that dissociation
of pentameric to monomeric CRP localizes and aggravates
inflammation. This work provides in vivo evidence of a
powerful pro-inflammatory effect of mCRP in striated muscle,
atherosclerotic plaque and infarcted myocardium (human and
rat tissues). Agrawal et al. (20, 21) reported that in an in
vitro acidic solution, npCRP was able to bind to various
types of proteins with altered conformations in a calciumindependent manner. Taking into account acidic pH at
inflammatory sites, npCRP protects against toxic conditions
caused by protein misfolding and aggregation maintaining
extracellular proteostasis of the inflammatory site by inhibiting
the aggregation of unfolded/misfolded proteins (22). In addition,
a dramatic increase in expression of mCRP has been observed
in blood vessels of damaged brain regions. Furthermore, mCRP
is highly angiogenic, unlike the native molecule, and may affect
tissue survival and development by influencing vascularization
and remodeling (23). Krupinski et al. (24) demonstrated a
strong expression of mCRP within microvessels with unstable
plaques whilst normal looking arteries and stable fibrous lesions
contained a significantly lower expression. The mCRP was
mainly associated with inflammatory cells and newly formed
angiogenic microvessels within unstable plaque regions (24).
This suggested that mCRP may have a pathological role in the
development of unstable atherosclerosis and/or increased risk of
plaque thrombosis. mCRP specifically increases the activation of
the inflammation both in vitro and in vivo, getting deposited
chronically within the brain after ICH (25), and may play a role
in perpetuating neuroinflammation after brain injury.
The liver is the primary site of CRP synthesis in humans.
However, it is also expressed, albeit at low levels, in the CNS. In
the brain, mCRP is produced in large quantities after an ischemic
insult and in response to inflammation, becoming indefinitely
attached to cellular components and within the extracellular
matrix (ECM) (26). After ICH onset, CRP could be clearly
localized inside blood vessels and in the cytoplasm of activated
astrocytes and neurons within the perihematoma regions (27).
CRP has also been detected in a number of neurodegenerative
diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (28–31), amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (32), and multiple sclerosis (33). Using unspecific
and specific CRP antibodies against mCRP, immunoreactivity
has been detected in the neurofibrillary tangles of AD patients
(31) and elevated CRP concentrations have been associated with
increased risk of developing dementia in older people. Increased
concentrations of serum CRP have recently been associated
with cerebral microstructural disintegration, suggesting an
involvement of CRP in silent stroke-associated vascular dementia
and, possibly, hemorrhagic stroke (27, 34). However, these
findings do not exclude the systemic origin of CRP. It has
been shown that CRP may reach the brain tissue from the
circulation by activating the endothelial contractile machinery
in both an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model and in an
isolated whole brain preparation (35, 36). In summary, these
data are consistent with the hypothesis that npCRP may be
a member of extracellular chaperones protecting against toxic
conditions caused by protein misfolding and aggregation in
acidic inflammatory environments. npCRP dissociates to mCRP
at sites of inflammation, which is then deposited in brain

parenchima at the level of ECM and via its proinflammatory
effects acts to amplify and localize inflammation.
npCRP-mCRP CELLULAR BINDING AND
MECHANISM OF ACTION
mCRP binds to macrophages via integrin α5β3 and subsequent
AKT signaling inducing a pro-inflammatory status and
chemotaxis (37). In addition, the immuno-modulatory effect of
CRP is also mediated through its ability to interact with FcyRs
(similar to the G class of IgGs), and to stimulate phagocytic cells
(e.g., macrophages). CRP acts as an opsonin for N. meningitides
and other bacteria. Therefore, as CRP-opsonized bacteria showed
increased uptake by human macrophages and neutrophils, this
could be useful regarding potential clearing mechanisms via
enhanced macrophage engulfment and phagocytosis after
antibody binding. Reduction of the intra-subunit disulfide bond
which occurs on cellular contact (after calcium-dependent
npCRP binding), allows unlocking of the lipid raft interaction
motif enhancing significantly the cellular uptake and signal
activation in macrophages/endothelium (38, 39). In endothelial
cells, mCRP and specifically rmCRP is known to bind to
membrane-associated enriched lipid rafts and stimulate cellular
activation through phospholipase C, MAP kinase, and NF-κB
(39). In addition, as previously shown in a monocyte cell line
(37), integrins may also mediate the binding of monocytic
cells and other cell types via α5β3 integrin binding to mCRP,
and mediate pro-inflammatory signaling upon binding to
mCRP.
ANATOMO-PATHOLOGICAL STUDY IN ICH
Published data has shown that mCRP is strongly expressed in
the brain parenchyma (neuronal nucleus and cytoplasm and
angiogenic microvessels co-localized with CD105) of patients
following ischemic stroke in the damaged core and penumbral
regions (26). The mCRP remained visible and in significant
quantities several months after the event. mCRP levels were
also increased in brain tissue parenchyma after ICH (27), and
was present in large amounts in perihematomal regions and
within neurons and glia of patients who died within 12 h of
spontaneous ICH (7, 27). Circulating levels of npCRP also
predicted hematoma growth and outcome. mCRP was abundant
in the walls of microvessels from the perihematoma region of
the metabolic penumbra of patients who died soon (2 days) after
stroke (Figure 1). mCRP may be responsible for increases in
vascular permeability and aberrant angiogenesis leading to vessel
structural instability and hemorrhagic conversion after stroke. In
vivo/ex-vivo effects on vascular development include the findings
that NCAM becomes over-activated, linked to pathological,
aberrant angiogenesis, the FITC-dextran permeability assay
showed that mCRP increased monolayer permeability, sprouting
angiogenesis assays and gap junction spacing between cells,
whilst dorsal matrigel implants containing mCRP produced
hemorrhagic lesions (while nCRP and VEGF did not show a
similar effect; see Figure 2).
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CRP AND
ICH RISK
Spontaneous ICH accounts for approximately 20% of all
strokes, and it is characterized by high rates of mortality
and residual disability among survivors (43, 44). Furthermore,
unlike ischemic stroke, ICH typically has no identifiable
premonitory signs or symptoms. Accordingly, the identification
of individuals at risk of ICH, prior to the occurrence of the
event, represents a striking clinical issue. On these grounds,
older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, alcohol
intake abuse and smoking have been associated with higher
risk of ICH (45). Nonetheless, predictive models based upon
conventional risk factors are still inadequate and, as such,
there is a need for developing early preventive strategies. Lowgrade inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key player
in the pathophysiology underpinning many different medical
conditions. Serum biomarkers related to increases in systemic
inflammatory activity are significant predictors of cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) and mortality (46). In this respect, the serum CRP
concentration has close associations with the risk of coronary
heart disease, ischemic stroke, and vascular mortality (47).
On the contrary, there is no evidence providing a clear-cut
relationship with the risk of ICH. In the last decade, a number
of epidemiological studies across multiple ethnicities have been
conducted, but none demonstrated a meaningful link between
circulating CRP levels and ICH risk.
Based on 6,430 participants as part of the elderly populationbased Rotterdam Study, Bos et al. (48). evaluated whether the
risk of stroke varied with baseline CRP serum levels and whether
that can helpful in the prediction of risk in individual stroke.
During an average follow-up of 8.2 years, 498 first-ever strokes
occurred, of which 51 (10%) were sub-classified as hemorrhagic.
CRP levels were significantly associated with incident stroke
and ischemic stroke, but not with ICH. The sex-specific hazard
ratios for the associations between one standard deviation (SD)
increase in logarithmically transformed CRP and ICH were
1.36 (0.87–2.14) and 0.81 (0.57–1.17) in men and women,
respectively.
In a 12-years follow-up examination of a Japanese population
in the town of Hisayama, from December 1988 through to
November 2000, Wakugawa et al. (49) demonstrated that
elevation of serum CRP levels was an independent risk factor for
future ischemic stroke in men, whereas no association between
serum CRP levels and the risk of future hemorrhagic stroke in
either sex was observed. The age-adjusted incidence rates of firstever hemorrhagic stroke according to quintiles of baseline serum
CRP were 2.4, 1.1, 2.2, 1.9, and 2.7 per 1,000 person-years for
men, and 1.1, 2.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 per 1,000 person-years for
women with no significant trends in either sex.
Associations of CRP levels with risks of total stroke and its
subtypes were examined in the Circulatory Risk in Communities
Study (49), prospective nested case-control study of 13,521
Japanese men and women aged 40–85. A total of 261 incident
strokes were identified, of which 67 were ICH and 29 were
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). After adjustment for known
cardiovascular risk factors, CRP predicted the incidence of total

diffuse neuropil staining was present, together with almost all cells’ silhouettes taking up the stain (A). Further away from the hemorrhagic core, the diffuse staining
pattern diminished, but with some neurons clearly retaining an affinity for the antibody. Although distant from the hemorrhage, white matter fiber tracts showed
relatively intense staining for CRP, especially those surrounding intracallosal vessels (B). Focal intravascular staining sometimes was observed (C), and only on
occasion were microglia-like cells immunoreactive for CRP (D). By immunofluorescence, CRP could be clearly localized inside blood vessels (K), and in the cytoplasm
of activated astrocytes (L) and neurons (M). On the contrary, in the region immediately surrounding an ischemic area, a high number of gemistocytic astrocytes was
noted (E), while further away from the lesion core numerous neuronal silhouettes were observed (F–H). On occasion, diffuse staining could be noted along the white
matter tracts and blood vessels. In the control brain, and in the hemispheres contralateral to the lesion, only occasional neuronal silhouettes were stained, with their
respective densities being clearly lower compared to the lesioned (ipsilateral) hemispheres (I,J). Scale bars, 20µm. Reproduced with permission from (27).
and ischemic strokes, while no associations were associated with
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
The role of hemostatic and inflammatory indices as predictors
of ICH was addressed by analyzing data from the Cardiovascular
Health Study (50), a randomly selected population-based cohort
study from four US communities, which recruited 5,201
participants aged 65 years or older. Among the considered
biomarkers, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor but not
CRP, factor VII, and white blood cell count were significantly
associated with incidence of ICH.
In a prospective, population-based study nested within the
Northern Sweden Cohorts, Andersson et al. (40) explored the role
of CRP as a determinant of first-ever stroke and the relationships
between the 1444C > T polymorphism, CRP levels, and stroke.
CRP concentrations were categorized as <1, 1–3, and >3 mg/L
for low, average, and high risk, respectively. Three hundreds
and eight cases of ischemic stroke, 61 cases of ICH with time
from ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were 52 and 50 months,
respectively. A total of 749 matched referents were defined as
control. In a multivariate model including traditional risk factors,
CRP was significantly associated with the risk of having a first
ischemic but not ICH [OR for the highest CRP group: 2.58
(1.74–3.84) for ischemic stroke and 0.97 (0.30–3.11) for ICH].
Additionally, the CRP 1444 (CC/CT vs. TT) polymorphism was
associated with plasma levels of CRP but not with ischemic stroke
or ICH.
CRP levels and risk of mortality from CVD were investigated
as part of the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for evaluation
of cancer risk (51). A total of 39,242 subjects of 40–79 years of
age provided serum samples at baseline between 1988 and 1990;
controls were matched for sex, age, residence area and year of
serum storage. During the 13-years follow-up, the total strokes
cases comprised of 214 hemorrhagic (119 ICH and 95 SAH) and
294 ischemic strokes. Higher serum CRP levels were associated
with higher mortality from CVD, but not ICH. Multivariable odd
ratios for one SD increment of CRP were 1.36 (0.75–2.48) in men
and 1.50 (0.99–2.28) in women. The impact of CRP on risk of
stroke, stroke subtypes, and ischemic heart disease in middleaged Japanese was further explored in a prospective, populationbased Study (52). A total of 1,341 CVD events occurred between
1990 and 2007 among subjects included in the study, including
494 hemorrhagic strokes (344 ICH and 150 SAH). The main
finding was the lack of any association between CRP and risk of
hemorrhagic stroke.

A longitudinal study from June 2006 to October 2007 based
on the Kailuan community, in Tangshan city, included 90,
517 Chinese adults, with no history of stroke or myocardial
infarction (MI) at baseline (53). During a total follow-up
of 362,163 person-years and a median of 49 months per
participants, 1,472 incident strokes were documented, of which
383 (26.0%) were ICH and 40 (2.7%) were SAH. The ageand sex-standardized incidence per 1,000 person-years of ICH
increased with CRP concentrations, being 3.04, 4.36 and 4.61
(p-value for trend = 0.04) for <1, 1–3 and >3 mg/L groups,
respectively. After adjusting for covariates, CRP concentrations
≥1 mg/L were associated with increased risks of all stroke but
were not associated with ICH or SAH, regardless of hypertensive
status.
A recent aggregate data meta-analysis considered prospective
observational studies that enrolled participants from the general
population, measured hs-CRP levels and reported adjusted
estimates of stroke risk in at least three CRP categories (54).
Four studies were included in the meta-analysis with a total of
40,002 subjects that 655 were ICH cases. Elevated CRP levels were
associated with excessive risk of ischemic but not hemorrhagic
stroke. The pooled adjusted risk ratio of hemorrhagic stroke
comparing the highest with the lowest CRP category group was
0.82 (0.59–1.13; p = 0.217) in a fixed-effect model, with no
evidence of heterogeneity. Although serum levels of CRP do not
seem to predict the risk of future ICH, it is noteworthy that none
of the aforementioned studies provided data on ICH etiology.
The main causes of ICH (i.e., hypertension, lipohyalinosis
of small vessels, and amyloid angiopathy) have different risk
factor profiles and underlying pathophysiological pathways (55).
Accordingly, the involvement of the inflammatory response and,
in turn, the predictive role of serum CRP may differ according to
the ICH subtype. Indeed, associations between serum CRP levels,
cerebral small vessel disease, and lobar or deep micro-bleeds
have been inconstantly reported highlighting the need for further
investigations before drawing concrete conclusions (56–58).
Finally, although hypertension and smoking may accelerate
the development and growth of intracranial aneurysms (59),
which are a main cause of SAH, the relationship between an
atherosclerosis and the intracranial aneurysm is weak (60).
This can explain the lack of a clear association between CRP
levels and SAH. Finally, the lack of a significant association
between ICH and CRP can also be due to clinical hs-CRP
assays that only measure the portion of total CRP in plasma in
the soluble pentameric form (18). The insoluble component of
CRP, npCRP and mCRP, on MP is not currently measured in
clinical settings that may have a relevant pathogenetic role that
is different from soluble pentameric form in ischemic vascular
disease (18).
CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE AND
GENETICS OF CRP
Several studies of CRP genetics have focused on genetic
polymorphisms and development of CVD. The impact of genetic
variants of CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as
rs1800947, rs1417938, rs1130864, and rs3093077 on circulating
protein level and outcome has been recently assessed in a cohort
of in-patients with CVD. It was found that both CRP level ≥5
mg/L and SNP rs1800947 of the CRP gene were independent risk
factors for further adverse vascular events among patients with
CVD within a 3 years follow-up (61).
The 717A > G polymorphism, which is located in the
promoter region of the CRP gene, has been associated with
ischemic stroke and it was an independent predictor of cerebral
ischemia among Chinese population. Although in hemorrhagic
stroke patients the frequency of haplotype H5 (A-T-C) was lower
compared to controls, it was not an independent protective
factor against cerebral hemorrhage. Accordingly, H3 haplotype
(G-C-C) could be an independent risk marker for ischemic
stroke, and the H5 haplotype (A-T-C) could act as a prognostic
marker of hemorrhagic stroke (38, 62).
CRP levels differ in individuals and this inter-individual
variation is genetically controlled with a substantial heritability
score (63, 64). The CRP gene that controls its blood levels is
localized at chromosome position 1q21–1q23, spans 1.9 kb and
exhibits two exons. Twenty-nine different polymorphisms have
been assessed within the CRP gene, however, so far there is
a paucity of robust studies clarifying the genetic consequences
of CRP gene vis-à-vis ICH. Four genetic studies have been
conducted hitherto, one of which has shown that haplotype
ATC of CRP SNPs (rs2794521, rs3091244, and rs1205) is an
independent prognostic marker for hemorrhagic stroke (38).
Another prospective population-based study on a Swedish
cohort has examined the contribution of 1444C/T polymorphism
of the CRP gene for the risk of ischemic stroke and ICH. Using a
multivariate model including traditional risk factors, CRP levels
were found to be significantly associated with ischemic stroke
(OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.29–3.29), whilst the 1444C/T polymorphism
failed to correlate with ICH (40). Das et al. (41) investigated
the 1059G/C polymorphism of the CRP gene in relation to
its contribution for the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke in an Indian population. Results of this study showed
that CRP levels were increased significantly in hemorrhagic
stroke patients (p < 0.001) when compared with controls, but
the CRP gene polymorphism was not found to be associated
with hemorrhagic stroke. A case-control study involving 236
hemorrhagic stroke patients in a community of Han Chinese
population revealed that SNP rs3091244 (−286C/T/A) of the

CRP gene was significantly associated with elevated CRP levels
in male patients (42). Summarizing the above data (see Table 1),
the studies investigating CRP gene polymorphism as the genetic
determinant of ICH are inadequate. The inferences drawn from
these studies can only be considered as suggestive rather than
conclusive due to the unchecked false positive cases and lack
of proper statistical power. More genetic studies in different
populations after adjusting risk concomitants will enhance our
knowledge regarding the contribution of the CRP gene and its
underlying contribution to the prognosis and prediction of ICH.
CRP STRATIFICATION IN ACUTE ICH:
SHORT AND LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS
Early prediction of ICH outcome is a clinical priority to stratify
patient risks, objectively design individual management, assess
patient prognosis with reasonable accuracy, and standardize
communication among healthcare providers. The evidence that
ICH prognosis cannot be fully explained by traditional baseline
hematoma features alone has prompted to look for adjunctive
biochemical (65, 66), radiological (67, 68), clinical (67–70), and
therapeutic (71, 72) variables that could characterize and inform
the secondary-induced brain injury and improve outcome
prediction.
The local and systemic inflammatory response that takes place
shortly after the ICH onset can enhance the brain injury and
post-stroke complications (73). Immune biomarkers, including
fever, white blood cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,
interleukin-6 and fibrinogen have been shown to improve
outcome prognostication (74–77). On these grounds, the specific
relationship between CRP and short- and long-term ICH
outcome has been also extensively explored over the past few
years.
In a cohort of 399 patients presenting with primary or
vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-associated ICH plasma CRP levels,
measured within 6 h from onset were significantly associated
with the occurrence of hematoma growth and neurological
worsening (7). In the final model accounting for age, sex, VKA
use, GCS score, ICH volume, midline shift, intra-ventricular
hemorrhage, time of sampling and white blood cells count,
CRP > 10 mg/L independently predicted hematoma growth
[OR 4.71 (2.75–8.06); p < 0.0001] and neurological worsening
[OR 2.70 (1.50–4.84); p = 0.0009), both of which increased
the risk of mortality. Alexandrova et al. (78) examined 46
patients with ICH within 48 h after onset of symptoms and
found admission serum CRP level to be a strong predictor
of short-term fatal outcome. A 5.2% increase in the odds
of first-week mortality was associated with an increase of
CRP concentration by 1 mg/L. A prospective, multicenter,
international, longitudinal study analyzed CRP kinetics and its
association with short-term prognosis after ICH (27). A total
of 223 patients were recruited, and CRP was evaluated at
admission, 24, 48, and 72 h after symptom onset. Plasma CRP
increased markedly from 48 to 72 h from admission, and the
magnitude of the response was related to hematoma volume
at later time points. Higher levels of CRP were independently
associated with higher mortality and poor functional outcome
at 30 days. From a clinical perspective, it is noteworthy to

Di Napoli et al. mCRP in ICH
mention that serial CRP measurements during the acute ICH
stages could provide different predictive utility: admission CRP
values were only weakly related to mortality and did not
predict functional status, CRP at 24 h was a better predictor of
mortality and unfavorable outcome, and predictability improved
further with the obtained CRP levels at 48 or 72 h that was
stronger for mortality than for functional recovery (27, 79,
80).
CRP has also been demonstrated within neurons and glial
cells around the hemorrhagic lesion in an immunostaining
analysis of brain tissue of patients who died within 12 h of
ICH (27). The early presence of CRP—which could reflect
either the local synthesis triggered by the hematoma or the
conversion of the circulating soluble pentameric form to its
insoluble and monomeric form—further supports the active
role of CRP in defining the extent of damage. The addition of
CRP concentration to the ICH-score significantly increased the
ability to predict 30-days mortality by about 8% (80). The net
benefit in prognostic accuracy was greater in patients classified
as being at low to moderate risk using the ICH-score alone
compared with the highest risk patients, in whom the severity
of ICH could reasonably be the major determinant of death,
and the lowest risk category, in which comorbidities could
represent the major determinants of prognosis. Acute phase
reaction biochemical markers including CRP were significantly
associated with a 3-months good prognosis [modified Rankin
scale (mRS) score ≤2] in the bivariate analysis performed
by Castellanos et al. (81) to identify outcome predicting
variables in patients presenting with primary medium to large
spontaneous hemispheric ICH within the first 12 h of symptom
onset.
Löppönen et al. (82) identified 807 subjects who suffered
primary ICH between 1993 and 2008 among the population of
Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland, and extracted the CRP values
within 24 h after symptom onset from the records. The analysis
confirmed high serum CRP levels as an independent predictor of
unfavorable 3-months outcome. The interconnections between
infections, CRP levels, and ICH outcome were addressed by
Diedler and colleagues (83). In a cohort of 103 patients with
supratentorial hematoma, infections occurred during a hospital
stay in 52 cases. Patients classified as having poor status
(mRS > 2) at discharge had a higher incidence of infections
and higher baseline (median 6.2 vs. <0.2 mg/dl; p = 0.001)
and maximal CRP levels (median 79.6 vs. 7.6 mg/dl; p < 0.001)
compared to patients with good prognosis. A similar pattern
was also observed for the 1-year assessment [median baseline
CRP 7.0 vs. 1.0 mg/dL (p = 0.006) and median maximal CRP
91.3 vs. 9.5 mg/dL (p < 0.001) for poor vs. good outcome].
The multivariate logistic regression model showed that maximal
CRP levels were independent predictors of scanty functional
outcome and mortality at discharge and long-term followup.
In a prospective study conducted at Sarawak General Hospital,
Malaysia, from April 2013 to April 2015, 60 patients with a
diagnosis of supratentorial ICH within 24 h after symptom onset
were recruited to determine mortality and morbidity at 6 months
(84). Admission and 72-h CRP levels were found to be the
main determinants of 6-months functional outcome and overall
survival, alongside baseline GCS, hematoma volume, and total
leukocytes (84). The relationship between CRP and long-term
ICH outcome was further explored in a prospective, multi-center,
case-cohort study for the assessment of stroke risk factors, which
enrolled 291 patients with first-ever stroke (196 ischemic and
95 hemorrhagic) between November 2000 and July 2001 from
five medical centers in Hubei province in China (85). Patients
were followed for 5 years, and the primary outcome included
the occurrence of acute MI, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke,
and death. The mean plasma CRP levels in patients with and
without endpoint events were 4.4 and 2.7 mg/L (p < 0.01),
respectively, and the relative risk of death or vascular events
during the 5-years follow-up was 3.01 (1.60–5.64; p = 0.001) in
patients with CRP > 3 mg/L compared to patients with CRP < 1
mg/L.
CONCLUSIONS
CRP seems to be an independent predictor of ICH outcome
that is a reliable, easily accessible prognostic tool. The values
of CRP concentrations for the prediction of ICH prognosis
have been recognized in a variety of ethnic groups with
conflicting results, so there is a possibility that it predicts different
ICH phenotypes in different populations. The concentrations
of CRP and its predication values on variety of stroke
phenotypes are influenced by the ethnic genome background
in the different racial groups, sex, and the environment. Based
on the current report, CRP should be used while taking
in mind these limitations. Furthermore, it is important to
understand whether CRP polymorphisms affect the expression
level or function of the CRP and whether single plays a key
role or multiple polymorphisms act together. Finally, before
routine use of CRP measurements in ICH prognostication,
the clinical bioassays of circulating CRP should be refined.
Actual hs-CRP assays do not reveal all the components
of CRP subtypes. As discussed here, this aspect appears
more relevant in ICH than in ischemic stroke. However,
the inclusion of CRP subtype assays to aid in diagnosis or
treatment of ICH relies on further studies. CRP does not
simply reflect the strength of the acute-phase reaction but
also correlates with the inflammatory response in the brain
tissue. CRP can directly be involved with neuroinflammation
and secondary-induced damage by activating the complement
cascade and microglia, promoting leukocyte chemotaxis and
adhesion molecule expression, stimulating cytokines release,
inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis, BBB disruption, and
brain edema formation. The downstream effects of mCRP within
the damaged brain tissue can be blocked by preventing its cellular
binding via lipid rafts and associated cell signaling soon after
ICH onset. In this way, we can nullify the neurodegenerative
cascade via a dual action of protecting neurons and preventing
further re-bleeding thereby reducing the risk of hematoma
expansion. This should be achievable through production of
a specific blocking antibody, which could be delivered intraarterially to bind to mCRP released into the extracellular
matrix to phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells from the
