ABSTRACT
Background: Sarcopenia is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis. 
However, it is not known whether the rate of skeletal muscle depletion is also associated 
with a poor prognosis. We investigated the prognostic impact of the rate of skeletal muscle 
depletion in patients with liver cirrhosis.
Methods: We included retrospectively all patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent 
both multiple computed tomography scans and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) 
measurements.
Results: A total of 131 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled. The mean age of the 
patients was 53.7 years and alcoholic liver disease was the most common cause (61.8%). 
Sixty-four patients (48.9%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The median changes in skeletal 
muscle area per year (ΔSMA/y) were −0.89%. During a median follow-up period of 46.2 
months (range, 3.4–87.6), 45 patients (34.4%) died. In multivariate analyses, age, ChildPugh score, HVPG, presence of sarcopenia and ΔSMA/y were independently associated with 
mortality. Cumulative mortality was significantly higher in patients with ΔSMA/y < −2.4% 
than those with ΔSMA/y ≥ −2.4% (log-rank test, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Both the presence and rate of change of sarcopenia are independently associated 
with long-term mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

INTRODUCTION
Sarcopenia, defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflects low physical performance and 
malnutrition.1 It has long been thought that sarcopenia is caused by aging processes or the 
development of disease,2 and many studies have shown that muscle mass, especially sarcopenia, 
affects outcomes in chronic diseases and malignancy.3,4 Because of this, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) have 
designated a new code for the disease, which is a combination of low muscle mass and weakness.5

Adequate prognostic assessment in patients with liver cirrhosis is difficult because the 
factors affecting disease progression are diverse e.g., liver function, portal hypertension, 
cause of the disease, reversibility of the underlying process, and hepatic malignancy.6,7
In clinical practice, the prognosis has been mainly made using liver function assessed by 
Child-Pugh (CP) score8 or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score9 and the degree 
of portal hypertension, represented by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).10
These prognostic tools each have their advantages and disadvantages. The CP score has been 
widely used for prognostic evaluation, but may include subjective factors such as ascites and 
hepatic encephalopathy, which observers may evaluate differently.11 Although MELD score 
assesses liver function and renal function objectively, it does not reflect the degree of portal 
hypertension; hence patients with low MELD scores may have a high mortality rate.7 HVPG 
is the best indicator of portal hypertension and the best prognosticator for cirrhotic patients, 
but it does not reflect liver function.12,13 One of the most important limitations of all these 
prognostic tools is that they do not reflect nutritional status and physical performance.7
Sarcopenia is one of the most common features of patients with cirrhosis, and is caused by 
reduced total energy intake, malabsorption, decreased muscle formation, and increased 
muscle breakdown.14 It has also been associated with the development of complications 
such as infection, and reduced quality of life.15,16 Furthermore, post-liver transplantation 
outcomes were worse for patients with sarcopenia than for those without sarcopenia.17
Moreover, sarcopenia is associated with mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis, 
independent of liver function such as CP score or MELD score.16,18 For these reasons, 
interest in sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis has increased. However, it is not known 
whether the rate of skeletal muscle depletion, in addition to the presence of sarcopenia, is 
associated with a poor prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, we investigated 
the prognostic impact of the rate of skeletal muscle depletion in patients with liver cirrhosis 
and compared it with the impacts of CP score, MELD score and HVPG.
METHODS
Patients
We collected retrospectively from electronic medical records and picture archiving and 
communication systems a total of 173 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent multiple 
computed tomography (CT) scanning and HVPG measurement between December 2009 
and March 2015. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by liver biopsy or by imaging findings 
suggestive of cirrhosis, including surface nodularity, or by clinical manifestations of portal 
hypertension and hepatic decompensation. CT scans were mainly performed for surveillance 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HVPG was performed in patients with high risk varices 
or signs of decompensation. All patients were in a stable hemodynamic state and not active 
drinkers. Of the 173 patients, 42 were excluded for the following reasons (Fig. 1): i) invalid 
HVPG value (n = 1), ii) loss to follow-up within 3 months (n = 2), iii) serum creatinine 
(sCr) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (n = 1), iv) transfer to another hospital for liver transplantation (n = 5), v) 
malignant disease including HCC at enrollment, or past history of HCC (n = 33). Finally, 131 
patients were included in the analysis. The last follow-up date was 31st December 2016.
Clinical and laboratory parameters
We collected the following clinical and laboratory data from electronic medical records; age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), cause of cirrhosis, history of ascites, variceal bleeding and hepatic

encephalopathy, platelet (PLT) count, serum albumin, serum total bilirubin, prothrombin time 
(international normalized ratio [INR]), sCr, and serum sodium. Blood samples were taken less 
than 1 day after HVPG, and MELD was calculated from the same samples.
Measurement of SMA on CT scans, and diagnosis of sarcopenia
All patients underwent initial CT scans within 2 months of their initial laboratory examinations 
and HVPG measurement. Transverse CT images at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) 
were used to evaluate skeletal muscle area (SMA), and these are known to represent wholebody skeletal muscle mass accurately.19 The authors of this study used self-produced image 
analysis software, which permits measurement of tissue demarcation by Hounsfield units (HU) 
within the drawn boundary, to measure the cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscles (cm2). 
Skeletal muscle was identified and quantified using HU thresholds of −29 to 150.20 The skeletal 
muscles at the L3 level consist of the psoas, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, transversus 
abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique and rectus abdominis. The skeletal muscle index 
(SMI) was defined as muscle mass area/height (cm2/m2). Sarcopenia was defined by sex-specific 
cut-offs of ≤ 52.4 cm2/m2 in men and ≤ 38.5 cm2/m2 in women.16,21 The SMA of the initial CT 
scans and the final CT scans during the follow-up period were measured regardless of the 
interval between both CT scans (mean interval between both CT scans, 37 ± 24 months). The 
relative change in skeletal muscle area per year (ΔSMA/y) was calculated from the equation: 
(SMA at final CT scan – SMA at initial CT scan)/SMA at initial CT scan × 100/interval between 
CT scans (years).22 In this study, 1 quartile, median, and 3 quartile of ΔSMA/y were −2.44%, 
−0.89%, and 1.15%, respectively. Thus, the patients with ΔSMA/y < −2.4% could be regarded as 
the high risk group for loss of skeletal muscle mass.
HVPG measurement
HVPG was measured at the outset of the study by a board-certified interventional radiologist 
with experience of more than 100 HVPG measurements. Briefly, under fluoroscopic guidance, 
a 6-Fr balloon-tip catheter (Arrow International, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was inserted via a

7-Fr sheath placed in the right internal jugular vein and advanced into the right hepatic vein. 
The balloon-tip catheter tip was located less than 5 cm from the junction of the right hepatic 
vein and inferior vena cava (IVC). Free and wedged hepatic venous pressures were measured 
during balloon deflation and inflation, respectively, using an electronic barometer built into 
the patient-monitoring equipment (Pulscan-combo; Scionic Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea). All 
measurements were performed 3 times and were represented as means. HVPG was determined 
by subtracting the free hepatic venous pressure from the wedged hepatic venous pressure. The 
pressure in the IVC at the level of hepatic venous drainage was also measured for comparison 
with the free hepatic venous pressure, to evaluate whether that measurement was accurate.
Statistical analysis
Categorical and continuous variables are given as frequencies (%) and mean values with 
standard deviations (SDs), respectively. Spearman's coefficient was used to test the 
correlation between ΔSMA/y and each parameter. To assess risk factors for long-term 
mortality, univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used. We 
included in multivariate analysis any variable that is associated with the outcome at a P
value of < 0.20 in the univariate analysis, regardless of whether or not the variable has been 
shown to be associated with the risk factor. However, the variable associated with clinical 
relevance can be included in multivariate analysis regardless of their statistical significance. 
The multivariable analysis was performed by backward stepwise regression in to avoid 
multicollinearity, and cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Overall survivals according to the independent risk factors were compared using the log-rank 
test. Statistical significance in 2-sided tests was defined as P < 0.05. All statistical analyses 
were performed with SPSS version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Hanyang University Guri 
Hospital (IRB No.: 2014-04-009). As this is a retrospective study, it was not feasible to obtain 
informed consent.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
The baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the 131 patients are shown in Table 
1. The mean age of the patients was 53.7 years, with men predominating (n = 94, 71.8%). 
Alcoholic liver disease was the most common cause of cirrhosis (n = 81, 61.8%). A history 
of decompensation was identified in 115 (87.8%) patients, and 50, 49, and 32 patients were 
in CP class A, B, and C, respectively. The mean values of CP scores, MELD scores and HVPG 
were 7.6 ± 2.1, 10.7 ± 4.4, and 15.2 ± 5.6 mmHg, respectively.
Sarcopenia and ΔSMA/y
Mean SMIs in men and women were 50.5 ± 10.1 cm2/m2 and 43.3 ± 7.4 cm2/m2, respectively. 
Sixty-four patients (48.9%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia, which was more common in men 
than in women (58.5% vs. 24.3%; P < 0.001). The mean BMI of the patients with sarcopenia 
was lower than that of those without sarcopenia (P < 0.001). Also, sarcopenia was more 
common in alcoholic liver cirrhosis than in liver cirrhosis due to other causes (P < 0.001). 
Serum sodium was significantly lower in the patients with sarcopenia (P = 0.001) but there 
were no significant differences between patients with and without sarcopenia in age, history

of decompensation, CP score, MELD score, HVPG and laboratory parameters other than 
serum sodium.
The mean ΔSMA/y was −0.88% ± 8.69%. There was no significant difference in ΔSMA/y 
between patients with sarcopenia and those without sarcopenia. ΔSMA/y was weakly positively 
correlated with total bilirubin (r = 0.252; P = 0.004), prothrombin time (INR) (r = 0.217; 
P = 0.013) and MELD score (r = 0.238; P = 0.006), but CP score (r = 0.157; P = 0.074) and 
HVPG (r = 0.148; P = 0.092) were not significantly correlated with ΔSMA/y (Table 2). 
The mean ΔCP score/y and ΔMELD score/y were 0.25% ± 2.29% and −0.01% ± 5.40%, 
respectively. ΔSMA/y was strongly positively correlated with ΔCP score/y (r = 0.643; P < 0.001) 
and ΔMELD score/y (r = 0.453; P < 0.001).
Survival of patients with cirrhosis
During a median follow-up period of 46.2 months (range, 3.4–87.6), 45 patients (34.4%) 
died, and the cumulative survival rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were 95.3%, 76.5%, and 62.6%, 
respectively. The causes of death were liver failure (n = 14), infection (n = 5), HCC (n = 4), 
variceal bleeding (n = 2) and others (n = 20; 2 cardiac disease, 1 cerebral hemorrhage, 1 lung 
cancer, and 16 unknown).
Cumulative survival was significantly higher in patients without sarcopenia than in those 
with sarcopenia (log-rank test, P = 0.025) (Fig. 2A). Survival rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were 
98.5%, 82.9%, and 73.7%, respectively, in patients without sarcopenia, and 91.9%, 69.6%,

and 51.3%, respectively, in patients with sarcopenia. Also, cumulative survival differed 
significantly according to the rate of skeletal muscle depletion (log-rank test, P < 0.001) 
(Fig. 2B). Survival rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were 91.0%, 59.0%, and 28.2%, respectively, in 
patients with ΔSMA/y < −2.4%, and 96.9%, 82.5%, and 73.5%, respectively, in patients with 
ΔSMA/y ≥ −2.4%.
We also identified other prognostic factors for survival. Survival was significantly higher in 
patients with CP class A than in those with CP class B or C (log-rank test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). 
Similarly, the survival of patients with HVPG < 12 mmHg was significantly higher than that of 
those with HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg (log-rank test, P = 0.034) (Fig. 2D).
Factors predicting mortality in liver cirrhosis
In univariate analysis, serum albumin, PT-INR, serum sodium, CP score, MELD score, 
HVPG, and sarcopenia were significantly associated with mortality (Table 3). Two models 
were constructed to avoid collinearity and multivariate analysis was performed (Table 3). In 
model 1 analysis excluding serum albumin, PT-INR, serum Na and MELD score, age (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.08; P = 0.019), CP score (HR, 1.23; 
95% CI, 1.05–1.44; P = 0.012), HVPG (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.15; P = 0.007), presence 
of sarcopenia (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.17–4.40; P = 0.015) and ΔSMA/y (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.91–0.99; P = 0.010) were independently associated with mortality. In model 2 analysis 
excluding serum albumin, PT-INR, serum Na and CP score, age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01–1.08; 
P = 0.008), HVPG (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05–1.18; P < 0.001), presence of sarcopenia (HR, 2.75; 
95% CI, 1.44–5.23; P = 0.002) and ΔSMA/y (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.99; P = 0.013) were 
independent prognostic factors for mortality.
Survival according to the combination of the presence of sarcopenia and its 
rate of change
We classified the patients into three group according to the presence of sarcopenia and its 
rate of change: group 1, patients without sarcopenia & ΔSMI/y ≥ −2.4%; group 2, patients

overall survival according to ΔSMA/y and presence of sarcopenia (Fig. 3). Post hoc analysis 
was additionally performed to assess the difference in survival for each group. Group 1 
and group 2 had significantly higher survival rates than group 3 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, 
respectively) and group 1 had significantly higher survival rates than group 2 (P = 0.006).

DISCUSSION
We have investigated the prognostic impact of the rate of skeletal muscle depletion compared 
with CP score, MELD score and HVPG in patients with liver cirrhosis. Our findings confirmed 
other reports that the presence of sarcopenia, as well as conventional prognostic factors 
reflecting liver function and portal hypertension, were independently associated with longterm survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. Moreover, the rate of change of skeletal muscle 
mass was also independently associated with prognosis. These results show that not only 
presence of sarcopenia but also its rate of change are associated with long term mortality of 
patients with liver cirrhosis, independent of liver function and portal hypertension.
Sarcopenia has been associated with the development of complications such as infection, 
reduced quality of life, and post liver transplantation outcomes.15-17 It is also known to be 
associated with mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis, independent of liver function such 
as CP score or MELD score.16,18 The mechanism why sarcopenia causes poor prognosis 
is not clear. However, the skeletal muscle is an organ that secretes many cytokines and 
peptides. When sarcopenia occurs, it induces hormonal and biochemical alteration and 
increases circulating endotoxins. This leads to an increased risk of infection due to a 
decrease in immune function and an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy.14 Sarcopenia 
also aggravates the progression of liver fibrosis and increases the development of HCC.15
Therefore, many efforts have been made to improve sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. 
In addition, Hanai et al.22 recently reported that the rate of change of skeletal muscle mass 
affected the prognosis of cirrhosis patients independent of CP or MELD. Similarly, in this 
study we evaluated the prognostic impact of skeletal muscle mass change in patients with 
cirrhosis compared with HVPG, which is known to be the most accurate test for portal 
hypertension, CP score, and MELD score, and showed that skeletal muscle mass change 
affected the prognosis of the patients independent of these other predictors. Therefore, in 
addition to the presence of sarcopenia, evaluating skeletal muscle change may be useful in 
predicting the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis.
Sarcopenia is more common in patients with cirrhosis than in the general population.23 A 
gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs in the general population from about 30–40 years 
of age.24,25 This age-related loss has been estimated at about 0.3%–0.8% per year up to the 
age of 60–70 years, after which the loss increases to 1.5% per year.24,25 This study showed that 
the annual rate of skeletal muscle decline in patients with cirrhosis was 0.89% per year, only 
slightly higher to that of the general population. On the other hand, Hanai et al.22 reported 
a skeletal muscle decline of 2.2% per year, which was higher than the rate in this study. The 
discrepancy between two studies was probably due to the younger age of the patients in this 
study compared to those of Hanai et al.22 (median age 52 years vs. 65 years). This suggests 
that muscle weakness may be more severe in older patients with cirrhosis than in the general 
population. Another reason for this difference could be the fact that the cause of cirrhosis in 
the study by Hanai et al.22 was mainly hepatitis C, whereas in this study it was mainly alcohol 
and hepatitis B, and it is likely that most of the cirrhotic patients in the study by Hanai et al.22
might not be treated with direct acting agents against their hepatitis C whereas our patients 
were treated for the causes of their cirrhosis, by, for example, active abstinence and hepatitis 
B antiviral therapy, along with nutritional support in the form of branched chain amino 
acid (BCAA). In this study, 61.8% (n = 81) of patients were prescribed BCAA for at least one 
month. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether aggressive treatment for the cause 
of cirrhosis slows the loss of muscle mass.

Sarcopenia and Its Rate of Change in Liver Cirrhosis

Although aging is a well-known risk factor of sarcopenia, age was not associated with the 
presence of sarcopenia in this study. It may be related to the relatively younger mean age (53.7 
years) of the subjects in this study. Like this, other studies on clinical relevance of sarcopenia 
in patients with liver cirrhosis showed similar results.16,18,26 This suggests that sarcopenia 
in patients with liver cirrhosis seems to be due to severity or etiology of liver disease, 
malnutrition, or presence of alcohol intake rather than age.
There is also a report that reversal of sarcopenia improves survival and clinical outcome.27
Likewise, the results of this study suggest that efforts to reverse muscle mass loss improve 
the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, more aggressive treatment is needed to 
increase muscle mass. Some guidelines recommend high-energy and high-protein diets.28,29
However, it is unclear whether nutritional support improves prognosis. A recent metaanalysis showed that the use of BCAA, which is commonly recommended for treatment of 
sarcopenia, also had no effect on mortality or nutritional parameters.30 However, several 
other studies have provided evidence that BCAA promotes protein synthesis and prevents 
proteolysis31,32 and long-term BCAA administration with leucine has been shown to improve 
prognosis and reduce complications such as sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis.26,33,34
Therefore, long-term BCAA administration holds promise for reducing muscle loss in 
cirrhotic patients.14 Although TIPS has been reported to improve sarcopenia and increase 
survival, further validation is needed.27 Testosterone and growth hormone have also been 
proposed as treatments for sarcopenia.35,36
Although more than half of patients had decompensated liver disease in this study, the sCr 
was not associated with mortality. In recent studies, sCr ≥ 1.5 mg/dL is associated with a 
worse prognosis than a sCr < 1.5 mg/dL in patients with liver cirrhosis and AKI stage 1.37,38
Therefore, patients with sCr ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, which is a risk of deteriorating renal function due 
to the use of contrast in CT scans or HVPG measurement, were excluded in this study. In 
addition, most of the patients (94.7%; n = 124) had a sCr ≤ 1.0 mg/dL. For these reasons, 
not only sCr but also MELD score, a significant predictor of mortality in patients with liver 
cirrhosis, were not predictors of mortality in this study.
This study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study involving a relatively 
small number of patients in a single center. In particular, because of this, the presence of 
sarcopenia was not associated with the liver function, such as CP or MELD score. Second, 
there is a possibility of selection bias because only cirrhotic patients who underwent multiple 
CT scans and HVPG measurement were enrolled. Thirdly, the SMI cutoff level for our 
patients was based on Western criteria rather than Asian ones. Fourthly, there is a possibility 
of the interobserver or intraobserver variability for SMA measured by CT. However, most 
other studies have measured SMA in the same way as in this study and in several studies for 
intraobserver agreement for SMA measured by CT, the intraobserver coefficient variation was 
only 1.3%–2.0%.39,40 Finally, sarcopenia in this study was evaluated only in terms of muscle 
mass not muscle function.
In conclusion, both the existence of sarcopenia and its rate of change are associated with 
long term mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis, independent of liver function and portal 
hypertension. We therefore suggest that efforts to improve sarcopenia are needed to improve 
the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis.
