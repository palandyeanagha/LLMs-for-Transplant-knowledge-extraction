Abstract
The omentum is a sheet-like tissue attached to the greater curvature of the stomach and contains secondary lymphoid
organs called milky spots. The omentum has been used for its healing potential for over 100 years by transposing the
omental pedicle to injured organs (omental transposition), but the mechanism by which omentum helps the healing
process of damaged tissues is not well understood. Omental transposition promotes expansion of pancreatic islets,
hepatocytes, embryonic kidney, and neurons. Omental cells (OCs) can be activated by foreign bodies in vivo. Once activated,
they become a rich source for growth factors and express pluripotent stem cell markers. Moreover, OCs become engrafted
in injured tissues suggesting that they might function as stem cells. Omentum consists of a variety of phenotypically and
functionally distinctive cells. To understand the mechanism of tissue repair support by the omentum in more detail, we
analyzed the cell subsets derived from the omentum on immune and inflammatory responses. Our data demonstrate that
the omentum contains at least two groups of cells that support tissue repair, immunomodulatory myeloid derived
suppressor cells and omnipotent stem cells that are indistinguishable from mesenchymal stem cells. Based on these data,
we propose that the omentum is a designated organ for tissue repair and healing in response to foreign invasion and tissue
damage.

Introduction
The healing potential of the omentum has been utilized
clinically by transposing the omental pedicle or flap to injured
organs (omental transposition) for many decades [1–3]. It is
located in the peritoneal cavity and is known for its diverse
functions of controlling the spread of inflammation, and promoting revascularization, reconstruction and tissue regeneration [4,5].
Omental transposition has been used to treat infections such as
mediastinitis and chronic cranial osteomyelitis. In addition, it has
been used in brain surgeries [6–9], for revascularization of
ischemic brain and myocardium, lower and upper extremities
[10–12], and for reconstruction of head and neck defects [13,14].
Further, the omentum has also been used to support regeneration
of neurons across a freshly transected spinal cord in experiments in
cats and also in one patient [15–17] resulting in the unexpected
recovery of limb function. The production of a variety of growth
factors by the omentum provides a possibility to sustain
transplanted pancreatic islets, expand cultured hepatocytes and
regenerate liver, and grow embryonic kidney and pancreas
anlagen into adult organs [18–22].
Despite reports of the benefits of omental transposition in acute
injury, studies addressing the mechanism by which the omentum
exerts such effects are lacking. Recently investigators have shown
that the omentum can be activated in the presence of foreign
bodies injected in the peritoneal cavity of rats. Once activated, the
flimsy sheet like organ enlarges in size and mass wherein the new
cells are predominantly non-fat stromal cells [23,24]. These
stromal cells are a rich source of growth factors like fibroblast
growth factor (FGB) and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and express adult stem cell markers including SDF-1a,
CXCR4, WT-1, as well as pluripotent embryonic stem cell
markers, Nanog, Oct-4, and SSEA-1 [23,25,26]. Further, they
were engrafted in injured tissues showing that they function as
stem cells in vivo [23,25]. Together, the data suggest that the
omentum contains the potent ability of tissue regeneration and
may be useful for treatment for various types of diseases involving
tissue damages.
In this study, we further characterized the anti-inflammatory
and tissue healing properties of cells derived from the omentum.
We determined that there are multiple subsets of cells that
accumulate in the activated omentum with different roles in
attenuating inflammation and supporting tissue regeneration.

Results
We tested the effect of omentum cells in tissue repair by using an
acute lung injury model with intratracheal (IT) injection of
bleomycin [27]. To collect sufficient numbers of omentum cells,
the omentum was expanded in mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of polyacrylamide beads as reported for rats [23]. Seven
days after injection, both the greater and lesser omentum were
expanded in mice as in rats (Fig. S1). Single cell suspensions were
made from expanded omentum, and cells were adoptively
transferred into mice that were administered with bleomycin
(Fig. 1). Compared to mice injected with bleomycin alone, mice
that received adoptive transfer of omentum cells showed a
significant reduction in the level of tissue inflammation and
cellular accumulation in the lung (Fig. 1a). Only a few
inflammatory areas (arrows) in the parenchyma were apparent.
Morphometric analysis by volume density of lesion and the
number of cells detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)
revealed a significant reduction in the extent of inflammation in
the lung (Fig. 1b and c). All T cell subsets, CD4, CD8, and cd T
cells in BAL were reduced (Fig. 1d). Cytokine profiles in BAL
showed that injection of omentum cells reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-12 p40 (Fig. 1e). In
addition, the concentration of CCL2 (MCP-1) and G-CSF was
significantly reduced in the omentum cell-treated group compared
to the bleomycin only group (Fig. 1f). Together, the data suggest
that transferred omentum ameliorates bleomycin-induced lung
injury either by reduction of immune/inflammatory responses
and/or accelerated recovery of the damaged lung.
T cells play critical roles in inflammation and following fibrosis
in the bleomycin-induced tissue injury models [28–30]. To
elucidate the mechanism by which omentum cells helped healing
of the lung, we determined if omentum cells suppress T cell
proliferation and function. CFSE labeled splenocytes were
stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody to induce proliferation in the
presence or absence of omentum cells. After 3 days, the
proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was dramatically reduced
in the presence of omentum cells (Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a). Inhibition
of T cell proliferation was observed when omentum cells were
added as low as 1/10 of splenocytes and correlated to the
omentum cell numbers added to the culture (omentum:splenocytes
ratios ranged from 1:10,1:1) (Fig. 2a). Inhibition of cell
proliferation was not due to the deterioration of culture conditions
since addition of the same number of suspended lung cells had no
effect on T cell proliferation (Fig. 2b). Further, inhibition of T cell
proliferation by omentum cells was not observed when cells were
separated in a transwell culture system (Fig. 2c) suggesting that
cell-cell contact or locally acting factors are important for T cell
suppression.
These data suggest that the omentum is a potent immunoregulatory organ, and not what has been postulated as a cluster of
adipocytes associated with secondary lymphoid organs [31]. We
therefore compared surface antigen expressions by activated and
naı¨ve omentum cells, because only activated omentum cells
suppressed proliferation of T cells (data not shown). Previous
reports showed the presence of cells with stem cell functions in the
omentum [24,25]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) known to have
immunoregulatory functions, have been characterized as
CD452Cd34+ in C57BL.6 mice [32]. Thus, we analyzed CD45
and CD34 expression by the omentum and identified three subsets
of cells in naı¨ve omentum: CD452CD34+
, CD45+CD342, and
CD342CD452 cells (Fig. 3b). In activated omentum,
CD45+
CD342 cells were substantially increased (Fig. 3b). Few,
if any lymphocytes were found in either naı¨ve or activated
omentum (data not shown). Since increase of CD45+ cell number
and suppression of T cells by omentum cells correlated positively,
we sorted omentum cells into CD45+ and CD452 cells and
determined which subset suppresses T cell activation. When
separated, CD45+ omentum cells suppressed splenic T cell
proliferation as effectively as whole omentum cells while CD452
cells did not (Fig. 3c).
Recent reports have identified an immunoregulatory CD45+
cell subset called myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [33].
MDSCs consist of a mixture of cells including granulocytes,
monocytes and dendritic cells and are defined in mice on the basis
of CD11b and Gr1 expression and their ability to suppress T cell
proliferation [34,35]. Among activated omentum cells, approximately 50% of CD45+ cells were Gr1+ and CD11b+ (Fig. 3d).
MDSCs are further divided into polymorphonuclear (PMNMDSCs) or mononuclear (MO-MDSCs) MDSCs [33]. PMNMDSCs express low or intermediate Ly6c while MO-MDSCs are
Ly6chigh. Data show that 16% of omentum cells are Gr1+
Ly6c+
while only 2% is GR1+ Ly6c2, thus a majority of Gr1+ cells from
omentum are Ly6chigh, suggesting that they are MO-MDSCs
(Fig. 3d). MO-MDSCs are known to suppress T cell proliferation
in an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dependent manner
dependent in response to IFNc exposure [36,37]. Indeed, CD45+
,
but not CD452, omentum cells express iNOS when treated with
IFNc (Fig. 3e). Moreover, an inhibitor for iNOS (L-NAME)
abrogated suppression of T cell proliferation by CD45+ omentum
cells (Fig. 3c). Addition of anti-IFNc antibody also abrogated T
cell suppression by omentum cells (not shown). Based on these
data, we hypothesized that suppression of splenic T cells by
omentum cells is mediated by MO-MDSCs. Indeed, when we
separated omentum cells by Gr1 expression, Gr1+ cells but not
Gr12 cells, suppressed T cell proliferation (Fig. 3f).
Adoptive transfer of omentum cells imposed a profound effect
on bleomycin-induced lung inflammation. Recent studies revealed
the significance of Th17 cells in this disease model [38]. Thus, we
tested if omentum cells also inhibit activation/proliferation of
already differentiated effector/regulatory T cells. When naive
CD4+ T cells were differentiated into effector/regulatory T cells in
vitro, and then co-cultured with omentum cells for 5 days, a
significant reduction in cell numbers and expression of IFNc (Th1
cells) and IL-17 (Th17 cells) was found (Fig. 4a, b). Little effect on
Th2 cells was observed. Importantly, no effect on Foxp3
expression or numbers of Foxp3+ iTreg cells was detectable.
Spleen-derived nTregs showed a mild increase in cell number
when co-cultured with omentum cells. Together, the data show
that omentum cells have cell type specific inhibition on effector
type T cells.
As we observed for total splenic T cells, suppression of Th1 cells
by omentum cells was iNOS dependent since addition of an iNOS
inhibitor lead to a significant increase in the frequency of IFNc+
cells (21.9% vs. 58.1%). In a clear contrast, the frequency of
omentum-treated IL-17+ cells did not change between carrier
control samples and the iNOS inhibitor treated samples (2.5% and
2.5%, respectively) (Fig. 4c). Moreover, while CD45+ omentum
cells are responsible for suppression of naı¨ve T cells and Th1 cells
(Fig. 4d), they showed little, if any, effect on Th17 cells. In
contrast, CD452 subset of omentum cells reduced IL-17+ cell
activation and expansion. Together, the data demonstrate that
there are CD452 immunoregulatory cells present in the omentum
that block Th17 cells in an iNOS independent manner.
Amelioration of bleomycin-induced lung injury by adoptive
transfer of omentum cells could also be promoted by potentiating
tissue regeneration processes. Previous reports suggest that rat
omentum contains cells that have stem cell functions to

differentiate into nerve cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes [39–41].
To determine if mouse omentum contains stem cells, we cultured
omentum cells in medium conditioned to induce differentiation
into lung epithelial cells [42,43]. After 28 days, we determined
expression of a lung specific antigen, clara cell secretory protein
(CCSP). Cells maintained in the lung epithelial-inducing medium
clearly expressed CCSP detected both by immunofluorescent
analysis and by RT-PCR (Fig. 5a, b). We also cultured omentum
cells in medium inducing differentiation into osteoblasts [44]. 2
weeks after the start of culture, we observed a high level of
osteopontin expression (Fig. 5c). The data show that a subset of
omentum cells is omnipotent in differentiation. To determine the
phenotype of the stem cell subset, we separated omentum cells into
CD45+ and CD452 subsets. A previous report showed that bone
marrow derived MSCs from C57BL/6 mice are CD452CD34+
,
although CD34+ cells are considered to be hematopoietic stem
cells in other strains of mice and in humans [32]. Thus, we further
separated CD452 cells into CD34+ and CD342 subset. In the lung
epithelial-inducing medium or in basal medium, CD45+ cells died
within 2 weeks of culture. CD452CD342 cells survived the culture
but showed no expansion. Cells derived from CD452CD34+ cells
expanded under these conditions and differentiated into CCSP+
cells (Fig. 6, Fig. 5d). Together, the data show that CD452CD34+
cells are the major source of stem cells from activated omentum.
Lastly, we tested if omentum cells were integrated into lung
tissues when injected into bleomycin-injected animals. To test this,
we used omentum cells from transgenic mice that express GFP in a
tissue non-specific manner [45]. When we adoptively transferred
GFP+ omentum cells into bleomycin-injected animals, we detect
the presence of GFP+ cells in the lung of bleomycin-injected
animals (Fig. 7). Thus, a subset of the omentum cells, either as
hematopoietic cells or lung epithelium cells, can migrate into the
lung tissue.
Discussion
Identified as the ‘policeman’ of the abdomen over a hundred
years ago [46], the omentum has since been used clinically for its
ability to seek and contain the site of injury. While expression of
stem cell markers and angiogenic growth factors have been
identified to explain some of its regenerative and revascularization
properties, little is understood about the mechanisms of its antiinflammatory and wound healing properties. Here we demonstrated that activated omentum has at least three functionally
distinct groups of cells that can facilitate regeneration of damaged

tissue: immunomodulatory CD45+ Gr1+ MDSCs; CD452 cells
that have the ability to suppress Th17 cells; and CD452CD34+
cells that show MSC-type stemness (???). A striking feature of
omentum is that, unlike secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph
nodes or spleen, it enlarges in response to foreign objects and
acquires a large number of immunomodulatory cells along with
cells with stem cell function. This type of response has not been
recognized for any other organ and is quite unique to the
omentum. The data reported here reveal the cellular subsets that
are recruited to the omentum and explain how the omentum
provides support for tissue healing/regeneration as observed by
many in clinical setting.
Naı¨ve omentum consists of adipocytes with some ‘milky spots’
predominantly consisting of cells characterized as macrophages
[47]. Upon activation with foreign bodies, the non-adipose areas
expand, with a dramatic increase in the percentage of CD45+ cells
within the omentum cell population. A subset of CD45+ cells
suppress naı¨ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and Th1 cell proliferation
in an iNOS dependent manner. Surface antigen expression of
CD11b and Gr1 by these cells suggests that these cells are MDSCs
[34]. MDSCs play important roles in suppressing airway
inflammation [48], suggesting MDSCs may be the cells responsible for inhibiting inflammation in our lung injury model.
Activated omentum also contain cells with stem cell functions
among the CD452CD34+ subset. Surface antigen expression
matches that of MSCs, which have potential to differentiate into
bone, fat and cartilage [49,50]. Recent studies have shown that
MSCs not only differentiate into cells of mesodermal lineage, but
also cells of endodermal and ectodermal lineages, including
cardiomyocytes [51,52], lung epithelial cells [53–55], hepatocytes
[56,57], neurons [58,59], and pancreatic islets [60,61]. MSCs
were originally identified from bone marrow (BM) but cells with
similar characteristics have been isolated from other mesodermal
tissues such as adipose tissue [62]. MSCs secrete a variety of
factors including those with immunosuppressive functions [63] and
provide a regenerative microenvironment for injured tissues to
limit the area of damage and to mount a regenerative response
[64]. Our data suggest that the presence of functional MSCs is a
part of the mechanism by which the omentum imposes tissue
healing support on the damaged tissues.

The omentum also contains CD452 cells that inhibit Th17
cells. The effect is independent of iNOS. Currently, it is not clear
whether this function is derived from MSCs. The effect of MSCs
on Th17 is controversial [34,35,36] and will require further
investigation.
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that shows colocalization of MSCs and MDSCs in a normal tissue in a large
scale. Co-presence of these two groups of cells provides an
explanation for why omentum has the ability to support healing of
damaged tissues. Cells that expand in the omentum, mainly
MDSCs, are regulatory toward inflammatory and immune
responses, and MSCs can function as the source of trophic
activity. How these immunomodulatory cells and stem cells are
recruited and function together in the omentum is a question of
significant implications in clinical applications since elucidation of
the mechanism will lead to development of effective methods for
tissue regeneration and repair. Whether these MDSCs and MSCs
originate from the omentum or other tissues is currently under
investigation. MDSCs accumulate in tumors and participate in the
suppression of immune responses to tumor antigens [34]. In
addition, MDSCs also expand in acute and chronic inflammatory
sites [65]. In contrast, MSCs are known to be adherent and
fibroblast-like from their in vitro observations and how they migrate
and/or expand in vivo is not well understood [66]. In this
manuscript, omentum activation was carried out by injection of
polyacrylamide beads. Polyacrylamide microcapsule has been
tested for biocompatibility and was found mildly inflammatory but
did not provoke significant proliferation of immune cells [67].
Polyacrylamide gel was initially infiltrated by macrophage and
slow integrated within its host tissue via a thin fibrous network
[68]. It is considered biologically inert and used as a tissue filler.
How the omentum recognizes polyacrylamide beads is not clear,
but it is well known that the omentum responds to foreign noninfectious objects such as catheter tubing in patients during
peritoneal dialysis [69]. Either MDSCs or other phagocytic cells
may be the initial group of cells that encounter the beads and
expand and/or recruited to the omentum. After this, MSCs within
the omentum might expand and/or are recruited from other
tissues.
Together, these data demonstrate that the omentum is equipped
to help tissue healing, as observed clinically in various settings, and
that the function results from multiple subsets of cells that
specialize in immune modulation and tissue regeneration. In the
future, cells from the omentum may be applicable for use in
support for tissue healing and regeneration in a variety of
inflammatory disorders. Recent advances in stem cell research
have also highlighted the role played by such cells and their
microenvironment termed the stem cell niche where tissue renewal
takes place. Understanding of how to provide the proper niche for
stem cells is critical information for regenerative medicine and
determination of how the omentum works could provide some
physiological answers to this profound question.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All experiments were performed in accordance with the
guidelines and under approval of the IACUC of Loyola University
Chicago Stritch School of Medicine (#2009073).
Mice
C57BL/6 mice at 8–10 weeks were obtained from Harlan
Laboratory (Madison, WI). All procedures were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Loyola University, Chicago.
Isolation of cells from the omentum
C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of
polyacrylamide bead slurry (Bio-gel P-60, Biorad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, 1:1 in 16PBS). Mice were sacrificed at day 7 and
the omentum harvested. Omentum cells were isolated using a
modified method from Garcia-Gomez et al [70]. Briefly, omentum
was chopped into small pieces and digested in 1 mg/ml
collagenase type I (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 minutes at
37uC. Cells were then washed and separated over a ficoll gradient.
Cells from the interface were passed through a cell strainer and
surface stained for phenotypic analysis or put into culture in
complete RPMI media (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), beta-mercaptoethanol (50 mM),
glutamine, sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and amino acids (Invitrogen).
Cell culture
Splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice were labeled with 2 mM CFSE
and cultured with omental cells in a 1:1 ratio in complete RMPI
1640 media with or without 1 mg/ml anti-CD3 unless mentioned
otherwise. In some experiments 0.1 mM L-NAME (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) was added. For some experiments, CD45 positive and
negative fractions were sorted using the IMag Cell Separation
System (BDbiosciences, San Jose, CA). Cell purity was .90%.
Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and the total
number of live cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion,
and then labeled and analyzed on the FACSCanto flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

ml), hTGFb (2.5 ng/ml), anti-IL-4 (2 mg/ml), anti-IFNc (2 mg/
ml); iTreg: hTGFb (2.5 ng/ml), mrIL-2 (10 mg/ml), anti-IL-4
(2 mg/ml), anti-IFNc (2 mg/ml). nTreg was expanded by the
method described previously [71]. On 5th day of culture,
omentum cells were added at a ratio of 1:1, for a total of 26106
cells in differentiation media for 2 days. Then, Th1, Th2 and
Th17 cells were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin/monensin for
4 hours and applied for cytokine expression analysis by intracellular staining.
Bleomycin induced lung injury model
All experiments were carried out in C57BL/6 mice weighing
22–25 g. Lung injury was induced by intratracheal administration
of bleomycin. Mice anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane
inhalation (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) were given an incision in
the neck region to expose the trachea. 0.04 U bleomycin (SigmaAldrich Inc. St. Louis, MO) was instilled IT in 30 ml sterile isotonic
saline as previously described [27]. The volume density of lesion
was carried out as described previously [72]. Point counting
techniques were used to estimate the volume density, VV, of lesion
using the formula VV = PP = PN/PT where PP is the point
fraction of PN, the number of test points hitting a lesion divided by
PT, the total number of points hitting the section. A lesion was
defined as a cluster of four or more inflammatory cells in either
interstitium or airways. The slide was systematically scanned with
a 49- point square lattice until all fields of the section were
counted.
Cell lysis and western blot
For western blot analysis, cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer
(containing 4%SDS, 10% beta-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol,
and 125 mM Tris, pH 6.8), boiled, and frozen at 220uC until
analysis. Lysates from equal number of cells were loaded in each
well, followed by electrophoresis and blotting onto PVDF
membrane. Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for
iNOS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich
Inc. St. Louis, MO), followed by the appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Cell signaling, Danver, MA) and SuperSignal West Pico or SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (Pierce,
Rockford, IL).
Lung and osteoblast differentiation culture media
Magnetic bead separation (IMag separation system) was
performed on whole omentum isolating first those cells expressing
CD45 from those not expressing, and a second separation was
then performed on the CD452 cells isolating those cells expressing
CD34 from those not expressing CD34. Whole omentum cells and
sorted omentum cells were placed into culture with either basal
media or media enhanced to encourage differentiation into airway
epithelial cells. Lung differentiation media was a succession of
three different media formulations described previously [42]
including media enhanced with activin A (R&D Systems, MN)
and small airway growth media (Cell N Tec, Bern, Switzerland) as
final inducing media. Medium inducing osteogenic differentiation
consisted of Minimum Essential Medium, Fetal Bovine Serum,
penicillin and streptotomycin, L-glutamine, and osteogenic supplements (R&D Systems) [44]. Cultures were maintained for five
weeks at 37uC and 5% CO2 and then analyzed for expression of
CCSP.
Analysis of CCSP expression by RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted and purified by mMACS mRNA
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Firststrand cDNA was synthesized with random primers and reverse
transcriptase (Promega, WI). CCSP and GAPDH were amplified
by PCR (Initial denaturation at 95uC65 mins, then 35 cycles of
95u630 sec, 62uC630 sec, 72u630 sec, final extension with
72u67 mins) with Taq polymerase. Primer sequences
CCSP : F : GCC TCC AAC CTC TAC CAT GA
R : CTC TTG TGG GAG GGT ATC CA
GAPDH : F : GCT GAG TAT GTC GTC GAG TCT
R : ATC ACG CCA CAG CTT TCC AGA
Analysis of CCSP and Osteopontin expression by
immunofluorescent staining
Omentum cells cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized
with 0.5% DAKO Tween 20 in PBS for 10 minutes followed by a
series of washings. Samples were then blocked with 5% normal
donkey serum, 0.5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Goat anti-rat
CCSP (courtesy of Barry Stripp, Duke University) at 1:1000
dilution or Goat anti-mouse Osteopontin (R&D System) at 1:200
dilution was applied and incubated overnight in the dark at 4uC in
dilutent buffer. Following a series of washings with PBS the
Figure 7. Presence of omentum-derived cells in the bleomycininjured mouse lung. Omentum cells from transgenic mice that
express GFP in non-hematopoietic cells or PBS (Bleo only) were injected
into mice that underwent bleomycin-induced lung injury. 1 week after
cell injection, mice were analyzed for the presence of GFP+ cells (green
cells). (610).

secondary antibody, donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen) at
1:250 dilution was applied and incubated for 2 hours at RT in the
dark. Following a series of washings, the specimens were mounted
with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and
analyzed with Zeiss confocal microscopy.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Flow Cytometry
Animals were euthanized by injecting an overdose of pentobarbital. The abdominal vein was cut and the chest opened. The
trachea was exposed and intubated with a 14 gauge catheter.
Lungs were then lavaged with 561 ml ice-cold PBS and 4–4.5 ml
were recovered. BAL was centrifuged and cells were counted using
a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electornics, Hialeah, FL). The
supernatant was either analyzed by ELISA or frozen for later
analysis.
T cell subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry using a
five-color staining protocol with CD4-Pacific orange/CD3-PECy7/CD45-APC/CD8-APC-Cy5.5/cd-Alexa750 and analyzed
with a CyFlow ML (Partec Inc. NJ). Gates were set around the
lymphocyte population and at least 3000 CD3 positive cells were
analyzed. The total number of CD4, CD8, and cd T cells was
calculated by multiplying the total BAL cell number by the
proportion of CD45 and CD3 and by the proportion of the
analyzed subpopulation respectively.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis of more than
one group of samples. For all other data, unpaired t test was used.
p value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
