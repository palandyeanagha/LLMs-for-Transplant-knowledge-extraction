Abstract
Background: The objectives of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and SBRT combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for advanced HCC with
portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).
Methods: Thirty one patients with HCC who were treated with SBRT were used for the study.
We studied 32 HCC lesions, where 23 lesions (22 patients) were treated targeting small nonresectable primary HCC, and 9 lesions (9 patients) targeting PVTT using the Cyberknife. All the 9
patients targeting PVTT received TACE for the advanced HCC. Tumor volume was 3.6–57.3 cc
(median, 25.2 cc) and SBRT dose was 30–39 Gy (median, 36 Gy) in 3 fractions for consecutive days
for 70–85% of the planned target volume.
Results: The median follow up was 10.5 months. The overall response rate was 71.9% [small HCC:
82.6% (19/23), advanced HCC with PVTT: 44.4% (4/9)], with the complete and partial response
rates of 31.3% [small HCC: 26.1% (6/23), advanced HCC with PVTT: 11.1% (1/9)], and 50.0% [small
HCC: 56.5% (13/23), advanced HCC with PVTT: 33.3% (3/9)], respectively. The median survival
period of small HCC and advanced HCC with PVTT patients was 12 months and 8 months,
respectively. No patient experienced Grade 4 toxicity.
Conclusion: SBRT for small HCC and SBRT combined with TACE for advanced HCC with PVTT
showed feasible treatment modalities with minimal side effects in selected patients with primary
HCC.

Background
Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which comprises 90% of all malignant cancers developed in the liver,
is a fatal disease that might cause death with severe complications unless treated properly [1,2]. Many modalities
such as surgical resection, percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), Y90 microspheres,
external radiation therapy (RT) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) have been tried in the treatment
for HCC [3-8], but the optimal treatment approach
remains controversial.
Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT), for benign and
malignant diseases, was initially used only for intracranial
lesions. With the advent of advanced imaging techniques
and robotic image-guided radiation technologies, the
Cyberknife has extended highly conformal radiosurgery
to extracranial SRT applications [9]. Stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) is now being extended to more
patients and clinical targets [10,11]. To date, there are
only a few reports in the literature that assessed the
response of HCC to SBRT [12-16]. We have employed
SBRT, using the LINAC-based SBRT since 1995, with a
special focus on liver tumors [17,18]. We performed
LINAC-based SBRT for 20 primary HCC patients with the
result of 80% local control, thus confirming that SBRT is
helpful in the treating primary HCC.
Expanding our experience further, we have attempted
SBRT alone for small primary non-resectable HCC, and
used the combined therapy of TACE and SBRT for
advanced HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis
(PVTT). Therefore, we evaluated the response rate and toxicity of SBRT for small primary non-resectable HCC and
SBRT combined with TACE for advanced HCC with PVTT.
Methods
Patients eligibility
From March 2004 to March 2005, 31 patients participated
in a retrospective study at the Cyberknife center, Catholic
University. We treated 32 HCC lesions with the Cyberknife (Accuray Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) SBRT: 23 lesions (22
patients) of small non-resectable primary HCC were
treated by SBRT while 9 lesions (9 patients) of PVTT in
advanced HCCs were treated by SBRT combined with
TACE. The criteria for patients to be included in the study
were as follows: (1) patients with histologically proven
primary HCC by ultrasound guided percutaneous needle
biopsy of liver, (2) patients with active, enhancing HCC
by radiography, (3) patients with PVTT surrounding near
the HCC, not located at the distant, separate parenchyma,
(4) patients not showing extrahepatic metastases, (5)
patients with tumor size (maximal diameter) ≤ 5 cm, (6)
age < 75, (7) patients with HCC that did not develop
within the transplanted liver, (8) patients who had ECOG
score ≤ 3, (9) patients with no previous experience of radiotherapy and (10) patients with leukocytes ≥ 4,000/μl,
platelet ≥ 50,000/μl. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients before therapy.
Treatment and dose prescription
In terms of previous treatment before SBRT, 17 of our
patients had received TACE, 3 patients PEI, 6 patients RFA,
and 5 patients had not received any previous treatment.
All of these patients were those who needed another treatment modality such as conventional RT or SBRT because
they, despite previous treatment, were either experiencing
progression due to treatment failure or had refused further
treatment due to poor tolerable state. TACE to gain a synergistic local effect and to visualize the location of the target. After the placement of a catheter, an emulsion of 10–
20 mg adriamycin in 3–10 ml lipiodol was infused into
the artery that supplied the tumor. Then, embolization
was performed with a variable amount of gelfoam
depending upon the tumor size. TACE (range: 1 – 4 times,
median: 2 times) was performed after SBRT in patients
with advanced HCCs with PVTT, whereas the patients in
small HCC were treated with SBRT alone. The interval
between TACE and SBRT was at least 4 weeks.
SBRT was administered using the Cyberknife image
guided radiosurgery system. The treatment was planned to
enclose the planning target volume (PTV) by the 70–85%
(median, 80%) isodose line as the prescribed dose. Gross
tumor volume (GTV) is defined as the tumor volume,
which enhanced contrast at computer tomography (CT)
scan. The PTV is defined as a 5 mm margin around the
GTV. The total doses administered were 30–39 Gy
(median, 36 Gy) at PTV with the prescription isodose level
range of 70–85% (median, 80%) in 3 fractions over three
consecutive days. The total treatment time per fraction
was 2–2.5 hours and the inter-fraction interval was 24
hours at least.
SBRT procedure and breath-holding technique
Frameless SBRT was carried out at our institution using
the Cyberknife SBRT system. Liver parenchyma around
the tumor was implanted with four gold markers, which
acted as radiographic landmarks for the image guidance
system. In image-guided SBRT, the tumor position during
treatment is always defined relative to the abdominal CT.
The CT image was taken when breathing from the patient
reached the maximum expiration. Treatment was delivered in the step, image and shoot sequence. First, the
robot positioned the linear accelerator at a fixed beampointing position. Then, the patient took a breath and
held it in exhalation while the imaging system acquired
the targeting data. The patient then took a resting breath,
followed by an RT breath-hold in exhalation, during
which the treatment beam was turned on. Anywhere from

10 to 50 monitor units of RT were delivered at each beam
position, broken up into breath-holding periods of 10–15
sec, depending on the pulmonary capacity of the patient.
Once the complete dose for a particular beam direction
had been delivered, the robot advanced the LINAC to the
next beam position and the imaging/treatment cycle was
repeated. The beam pointing during each RT breath-hold
in exhalation was based on the tumor position observed
during the most recent prior imaging during a breath-hold
in exhalation. And the reproducibility of breath hold
assessed was checked by skin marker and correlated,
matched dot drawn on the monitor at the control room.
Dose limitation to normal tissues
The liver, stomach, duodenum, intestine, kidney, and spinal cords were contoured during the planning process and
dose-volume histograms (DVH) were used to ensure that
normal tissue tolerances were not exceeded.
Liver
Doses of 30–35 Gy in the whole liver with conventional
fractionation are often considered to be the limit of liver
tolerance. Kazunari Yamada et al. reported that the volume of the liver receiving a dose in excess of 30 Gy, with
conventional fractionation, could be used as a predictive
test for damage in liver function [19]. We evaluated V20
as a predictor for liver damage accrued from the SBRT in
our study: in the α/β ratio of 3, 30 – 35 Gy with conventional fractionation is equivalent to a dose of 3 × 6 Gy
(total, 18 Gy) in the whole liver. The V20 was limited so
as not to exceed 50% of the functional whole liver tissue.
Stomach, duodenum and intestine
Due to the lack of clinical data on the effect of very high
fraction doses exceeding 8 Gy, the dose of 7 Gy was chosen based on the experience in brachytherapy [20]. Therefore, the maximum dose to the stomach, duodenum,
small or large bowel was limited to below 7 Gy per fraction (total, 21 Gy) to avoid serious side effects.
Kidney
Emani et al. suggested 23 Gy for TD5/5 for whole-kidney
irradiation [21]. Cassady reported that a threshold dose of
15 Gy delivered with conventional fractionation appeared
reasonable [22]. As renal toxicities are usually related to
the total volume of treated kidney, DVH are essential to
predict renal toxicities. In this study, at least 2/3 of the
right kidney was limited to receive a dose of less than 5 Gy
per fraction (total, 15 Gy): in the α/β ratio of 3, 23 Gy with
conventional fractionation is equivalent to a dose of 3 × 5
Gy (total 15 Gy).
Spinal cord
The maximum dose to the spinal cord was limited to
below the 7 Gy per fraction from the linear-quadratic formula of Withers et al: for an α/β ratio of 3, 42 Gy with
conventional fractionation is equivalent to a dose of 3 × 7
Gy (total, 21 Gy) [23].
Response and toxicity evaluation
Patients underwent abdominal CT scans 1 month after
completion of SBRT, and then tumor response was
checked at 2–3 month intervals. Tumor responses were
classified according to modification of the World Health
Organization response evaluation criteria, as follows.
Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of the irradiated tumor, partial response (PR)
corresponded to more than 50% reduction in tumor volume, stable disease (SD) was defined as a decrease less
than 50% or more than 25% in tumor volume, and progressive disease (PD) as more than 25% increase in tumor
volume. CR and PR were defined as objective response.
For the 9 patients with advanced HCC with PVTT, final
responses were analyzed after combined modality, SBRT
and TACE were performed. Toxicity was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria for Events Version 2.0.
Analysis was performed after 31 patients had been
enrolled. The survival time was measured as the period
from the date of first SBRT to the date of death or the last
follow-up. The survival rate was calculated according to
the Kaplan-Meier method using SAS for window 8e.

Patients characteristics
Pretreatment characteristics of patients and tumors are
summarized in Table 1. The median age was 59 years
(range, 44–74 years), and males were predominant. The
general condition of most patients was good, with 24
patients having ECOG scores of 0–1. The median target
volume was 25.2 cc (range, 3.6–57.3 cc), 23.5 cc (range,
3.6–57.3 cc) in small HCC and 32.8 cc (range: 3.9–47.7
cc) in PVTT. The median follow-up for 31 patients was
10.5 months (range, 2.0–18.5 months), 11.5 months
(range, 2.0–18.5 months) in small HCC and 8.5 months
(range, 2.0–15.0 months) in PVTT. The summary of SBRT
of patients is shown in Table 2.
Tumor response and survival to treatments
The overall response rate (CR plus PR) was 71.9% (23/32)

for advanced HCC with PVTT was 8 months and 43.2%
(Figure 3). Local recurrence was observed in 3 lesions,
observed in small HCC (1) and advanced HCC with PVTT
(2). At the time of analysis, 6 patients had died of disease
and 25 patients were alive.
Toxicity
The frequency of treatment related toxicities including
liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin, leukocytes, platelets,
and nausea toxicities is presented in Table 4. Of the 31
patients, one patient experienced grade 3 liver enzymes
toxicity in small HCC. There were no treatment related
deaths.
Five patients (16.1%) showed progression of Child-Pugh
classification from A to B within 3 months after SBRT (3
small HCC, 2 advanced HCC with PVTT). Three of them
had progressive disease in 1–2 months after SBRT. Progression from Child-Pugh classification B after SBRT was
not observed.
Discussion
Surgical resection has been considered a preferred modality of treatment for long-term control of some limited
HCCs. However, less than 20% of patients are surgical
candidates at diagnosis. In recent years, a number of alternative local modalities including PEI, TACE and RFA have
been developed. These local treatments have shown local
control rates of 86% after PEI [4], local control rates for
liver metastasis of 70% after RFA [5] and 55% after TACE
[6]. Seong JS et al. studied the combination of conformal
RT with TACE for HCC and local control rates of 66%
have been reported in patients [24]. As a result of our
study, the local control rate was observed to be 71.9%,
which is at least equivalent to the invasive local therapies.
Therefore, considering the quality of life during and following treatment and the noninvasive, painless approach
associated with SBRT, this technique may be a preferred
treatment modality for primary HCC.
Clinically, the biologic advantage of a larger volume of
potential normal tissue repair, such as that occurs with
conventional RT, is of particular importance when the
safety margin is small between tumor and normal tissue.
If the irradiated volume is restricted to the tumor with a
very small security margin, sublethal damage repair is not
a first-line aim because complete cell damage is intended.
SBRT can create a high-gradient dose falloff in the target
tumor with a very small security margin.
Dose escalation appears to be a very important issue for
local control rates. If HCC is treated with RT alone, it
requires normal liver tissue-sparing radiation techniques,
because the tolerance dose of the liver declines with the
volume irradiated [25]. However, dose escalation with

conventional RT is limited by prolonged treatment time
(accelerated tumor cell repopulation) and increase of the
dose to the functional liver tissue (impairment of liver
function). SBRT can deliver a high dose of radiation to the
target tissue with a high degree of precision within the
body [26], while sparing most of the adjacent organ,
resulting in potentially better local control and lower risk
for RT toxicity.
Published clinical data on SBRT, especially for liver
tumors, is limited [12-16]. Blomgren et al. published the
first experiences of use of stereotactic RT for liver tumors
[27]. They recommend a hypofractionated RT approach
with an inhomogeneous dose distribution in the target.
Herfarth KK et al. used a stereotactic single dose RT
approach in the treatment of liver tumors [12]. In these
studies, both demonstrated high local tumor control rate
and low morbidity. The present study on SBRT was
attempted based on the results from the above researches,
and the results of this study confirmed that SBRT is indeed
helpful in the patients of small HCC.
The presence of PVTT is an extremely poor prognostic factor, because it can lead not only to, the wide dissemination of tumors throughout the liver due to the presence of
arterioportal shunting, but also to marked worsening of
the liver function as a result of decreased portal flow. In
patients with PVTT, TACE was considered a contraindication because it could theoretically result in hepatic damage resulting from hepatic ischemia [28]. TACE is less
effective in patient with PVTT, and local RT may make
TACE more effective if portal vein disease can be eradicated [29]. Tazawa et al. reported a retrospective study of
combined therapy (local RT + TACE) in 24 patients with
PVTT [30]. In their study, the survival rate was significantly better in the responders than the non-responders.
However, Yamada et al. reported 19 patients who had
combined therapy (local RT + TACE) with PVTT; They
found no significant difference in overall survival between
the responders and non-responders [19]. However, one
significant finding in this study was that on follow-up
angiograms, the protrusion of PVTT into the main portal
trunk decreased in all cases. Combined therapy (local RT
+ TACE) may prevent PVTT from spreading to the main
trunk, suggesting a further benefit of TACE. Because the
time frame for the RT period in this study was at least 6
weeks, in many cases, the tumor outside the RT fields continued to be enlarged after RT. A shorter fractionation
schedule of SBRT like our study will be able to resolve this
problem. Our policy, in combining RT with TACE, was to
use SBRT solely to treat PVTT in a short treatment period,
whereas intralobar HCC was treated with TACE. SBRT, for
primary HCC with PVTT, has shown acceptable local control.
In our study, we observed three patients with local recurrence in tumor of left hepatic lobe of the liver. All of the
local recurrence are regarded to resulting from marginal
recurrence due to inaccurate treatment of a moving target
and the poor breathing capacity of the patients. The magnitude of respiration-induced target motion could be as
large as 2–3 cm, peak-to-peak. Various methods have
been proposed to control or mitigate target motion. These
include active or passive breath-holding techniques [31],
respiratory gating [32] and 4 dimension or tumor tracking
[33]. Breath-holding techniques, by either actively or passively suspending the patient's respiration, allow treatment during this interval. A study examining intra- and
interfraction reproducibility of diaphragm position
within a fraction can be reproduced satisfactorily. However, daily imaging and repositioning are still required in
order to achieve any appreciable reduction in treatment
margin for precise treatment. Meanwhile, we suggest to
select future patients with well tolerable breathing or train
patient to maintain stable breathing, in order to avoid
inaccurate treatment of a moving target.
Conclusion
Our study shows that SBRT for small HCC and a combination of SBRT with TACE for advanced HCC with PVTT
are feasible and effective treatments. Further study is necessary to define the role of dose administered as well as
fractionation and side effects in selected patients with
small primary HCC and advanced HCC with PVTT.
