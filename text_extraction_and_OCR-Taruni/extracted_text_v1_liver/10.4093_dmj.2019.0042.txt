Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is currently the 
leading cause of obesity-related cancer deaths in middle-aged men. 
Methods: Probiotics with lipid-lowering function were screened from the fecal microbiota of healthy adults. Polysaccharide from 
different sources was screened for improving insulin resistance. The combination of probiotics and Salvia miltiorrhiza polysaccharide (LBM) was investigated for alleviating hepatic steatosis.
Results: First, Bifidobacterium bifidum V (BbV) and Lactobacillus plantarum X (LpX) were obtained from the fecal microbiota of 
healthy adults. Second, to improve insulin resistance, a Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide showing good performance in 
reducing insulin resistance was obtained. The liver total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) levels and the serum levels of 
free fatty acid, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and TC can be significantly 
reduced through supplementation with LpX-BbV (LB) in NAFLD mice. Interestingly, the function of the probiotic LB can be enhanced by S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide. Furthermore, the gut microbiota was modulated by LpX-BbV+S. miltiorrhiza
Bunge polysaccharide (LBM). The lipopolysaccharide concentration of the LBM group was decreased by 73.6% compared to the 
NAFLD group. Ultimately, the mRNA concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β 
[IL-1β], and IL-6) decreased with LB and LBM treatment. 
Conclusion: The results of this this study indicate that the LBM combination can be used as a therapeutic for ameliorating 
NAFLD via modulating the gut microbiota and improving insulin resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by 
hepatic steatosis in the absence of a history of significant drinking (alcohol) or other known history liver diseases. NAFLD resembles alcohol-induced fatty liver damage, which can develop 
into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and, eventually, hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. NAFLD is the most common cause 
of chronic liver disease worldwide. Approximately 20% to 30% 
of adults in developed countries suffer from NAFLD [2], and 
the prevalence of NAFLD in obese adults and those suffering 
from type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased to 75% and 50% to 
75%, respectively [3,4]. NAFLD is a multifactorial disease [5].

Combination of probiotics and polysaccharide alleviates NAFLD

factors and diets (the most important factor) have been considered in its pathogenesis. Up to 80% of obese people suffer 
from NAFLD disease [6,7]. NAFLD is a new challenge in the 
field of modern medicine. There are two routes to relieve 
NAFLD: one route is inhibiting triglyceride (TG) synthesis, 
and the other one is promoting the metabolism of TGs. Hepatic steatosis can be improved by inhibiting lipid synthesis and 
promoting fatty acid oxidation, especially β-oxidation [2]. 
NAFLD is an acquired metabolic stress-induced liver injury 
associated with insulin resistance and genetic susceptibility 
[8,9]. Endogenous ethanol [10], gut microbiota [5], and hepatic tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) [11] play important roles 
in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Systemic inflammation can be 
induced by high-fat diets (HFDs); insulin resistance, weight 
gain, and nonalcoholic fatty liver can be caused by disturbed 
metabolic homeostasis and gut microbial derangements. In 
patients with fatty liver, intestinal bacterial overgrowth is common [12,13]. Intestinal permeability is associated with a fatty 
liver. The risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be increased by the increased intestinal permeability [14]. In addition, the bacterial endotoxin has been considered as a hepatotoxin [15], which is produced by gram-negative bacteria. Considerable evidence shows that the balance of gut microbiota 
and insulin resistance is considered a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH [5,16]. 
Fortunately, accumulating evidence has shown that probiotics are able to inhibit harmful bacteria and improve gastrointestinal barrier function [17]. In particular, various Lactobacilli
isolates attenuated liver pathology via stabilization of the intestinal barrier and anti-inflammatory actions [18]. A study demonstrated that alanine transaminase (ALTase), aspartate transaminase (ASTase), TNF-α, and total cholesterol (TC) of NAFLD 
patients were reduced by Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and 
Streptococcus [19]. Previous studies found that the serum lipid 
profiles can be influenced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
[20]. 
Probiotics should impart the ability to tolerate gastric acidity 
and bile toxicity, survive under stressed conditions of the intestine and have antimicrobial effects against pathogens [21]. In 
this study, we attempt to relieve NAFLD by blocking TG synthesis (or enhancing TG metabolism) and reducing insulin resistance. The probiotics from the fecal microbiota of healthy 
adults were screened for cholesterol and TG clearance. Moreover, polysaccharides were also screened for insulin resistance 
improvement. We aim to quickly establish methods for probiotic screening, and the effect of a probiotic combination (Lactobacillus plantarum+Bifidobacterium bifidum+polysaccharide) 
on the mitigation of NAFLD was examined.
METHODS
Isolation of probiotics from fecal microbiota of healthy 
adults
Samples were collected from fecal microbiota in healthy adults. 
To ensure general health, the vital signs of volunteers were assessed and inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 20 to 30 years 
of age; (2) free of known gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases, no history of gastrointestinal or metabolic disorders; (3) 
avoid taking medications; (4) limit alcohol consumption; (5) 
agree to avoid any changes in chronic medications; (6) willing 
to fill out all necessary research questionnaires and donate 
stool specimens; and (7) voluntary signing of written informed 
consent prior to participation in the study. Stool samples were 
harvested in sterile transparent-glass tubes (20 mL) and stored 
at 4°C. Stools were diluted by 10−4 to 10−6 with sterilized saline. 
Then, 50-μL dilutions were spread onto the MRS (de MAN, 
ROGOSA and SHARPE) broth, and MRSP (MRS broth was 
added with 1.8 mmol/L sodium thioglycolate, 2.8 mmol/L Lcysteine hydrochloride, and 0.9 mmol/L CaCl2) and M17 agar 
plates in anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 48 hours.
Probiotics and polysaccharide screening
The cholesterol-lowering capability of the candidate strains determined by the ferric ammonium sulfate [22,23]. Briefly, isolates were inoculated (1%, v/v) into MRSC broth (MRS broth 
supplemented with 1.0 g/L cholesterol) and incubated at 37°C 
for 48 hours anaerobically. Next, 200-μL cultures were mixed 
with 4,800 μL ethanol after incubation. Then, the cells were removed by centrifugation (4,500 rpm, 20 minutes) at 4°C. Next, 
4 mL of supernatant was slowly added to 2 mL of ferric ammonium sulfate reagent (Aladdin, Shanghai, China) and mixed 
well. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured by a 
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 560 nm. The 
uninoculated samples were used as a negative control. Cholesterol clearance (CC) was calculated by the following formula: 
CC=[(Ao–A)/Ao]×100%, where Ao and A are the absorbance 
of uninoculated and inoculated samples, respectively.
The TG-reducing activity was tested according to the Saravanan and Ponmurugan [24] method. Isolates were inoculated 
(1%, v/v) into 25 mL of MRST broth (MRS broth supplemented

with 1.0 g/L TG) and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Samples 
cultured in MRS medium were used as a negative control. The 
supernatant of the cultures obtained by centrifugation (4,500 
rpm, 20 minutes, 4°C) was saponified by adding 0.5 mL saponification reagent (50 g of potassium hydroxide, 400 mL isopropanol, 600 mL distilled water) followed by 0.5 mL of acetylacetone reagent (0.75 mL of acetylacetone, 40 mL of isopropanol, 
60 mL distilled water). Evenly mixed mixtures were kept at 
65°C for 1 hour in an oil bath and cooled. The blank control 
and a series of standard concentrations of triolein were treated 
using the same method, and absorbance at 420 nm was read: 
C×T=cholesterol reduction rate (%)×TG reduction rate (%). 
Polysaccharides from Dendrobium officinale, Talinum triangulare, and other sources were prepared according to the report [25]. Briefly, the D. officinale or other medicinal plant 
powder (20 g) was boiled three times with 600 mL distilled 
water for 3 hours. The polysaccharide was obtained by ethanol 
precipitation. After an 8-hour fast, mice were injected with 
glucose (3 g/kg), and after 15 minutes of glucose loading, an 
equal amount of polysaccharides was given by intragastric administration for 4 weeks. After the last administration, all the 
mice were fasted strictly but allowed free access to water as 
usual for 4 hours. Blood was collected for measurement of fasting glucose and insulin levels 12 hours after the last polysaccharide administration. 
An insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
kit (TSZ, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to determine the 
fasting insulin (FINS). To select the polysaccharide with a good 
performance on reducing insulin resistance, the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated according to the following formulas: ISI=Ln [1/(FBG×FINS)] [26,27], where FBG was the 
level of fasting blood glucose (mg/dL) and FINS was the level 
of FINS (mIU/L). The index of insulin resistance was calculated by the following formulas [28]: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)=FINS (mIU/L)×FBG 
(mmol/L)/22.5.
Screening and identification of the candidate strains 
The effect of bile salts on the growth of these tested strains was 
carried out using a method described by Bao et al. [29]. After 
culturing in MRS broth at 37°C for 12 hours, the bacterial concentration was adjusted to 108
 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL. 
Afterward, samples were inoculated into (1%, v/v) MRSB 
broth (MRS broth supplemented with 0.3% bile salts [oxgall]). 
Samples inoculated into MRS broth were used as controls. 
Strains were incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 24 hours. To 
monitor bacterial growth, the optical density (OD620nm) was 
measured with a spectrophotometer. Survival percentage 
(%)=S/So×100%, where S was the OD620nm of the MRSB culture and So was the OD620nm of the MRS culture (control). Genomic DNA of the strain was extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the method of 
Huang et al. [30]. After cloning, the candidate strains were 
identified by DNA sequencing (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, 
China) [31], and the sequence was compared to the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. 
Oral glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test
Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were measured at 0 to 6 
weeks after treatments. Glucose load (2.0 g/kg of body weight) 
was conducted after 12 hours of fasting by oral gavage. After glucose administration, blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 
60, 90, and 120 minutes. Concentrations of glucose were measured, and the total glucose area under the curve (AUCglucose) 
were calculated. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) was completed after 6 hours of fasting. Next, 1.5 IU/kg insulin was infused 
into mice, and glucose was measured intraperitoneally. The 
constant rate for glucose disappearance during the ITT (KITT) 
was calculated using the formula 0·693/t1/2, where t1/2 was calculated from the slope of the least square analysis of the blood 
glucose levels during the linear decay phase of decline. 
Mice and treatments
Forty male C57BL/6N mice (pathogen-free) were purchased 
from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China). The average initial body weight of the mice was approximately 18.5 g. The mice were housed in clean, sterile, polypropylene cages under controlled conditions with a room temperature of 20°C to 24°C and a cycle of 12/12 hours light-dark. 
Moreover, the experimental group and the control group were 
housed under the same conditions. During the first week, all 
mice were fed the same normal diet (ND). Afterward, the mice 
were randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group). The 
ND group received the normal diet, while the HFD group received the HFD diet; the HFD+(L. plantarum X [LpX]-B. bifidum V [BbV] [LB]) group received an HFD diet supplemented 
with LB via intragastric administration, and the HFD+(LpXBbV+Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide [LBM]) group 
received an HFD supplemented with LBM via intragastric administration. LB was a mixture of 1×108
 CFU/mL of LpX and

2×108 CFU/mL BbV; LBM was composed of LB (1×108 CFU/
mL LpX+2×108 CFU/mL BbV) plus S. miltiorrhiza Bunge 
polysaccharide (50 mg/kg/day). After 30 minutes of LB administration, S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide was given 
by intragastric administration. After the end of the experiment, all mice were sacrificed after fasting for 12 hours. The 
mice’s livers were collected, weighed and stored at –80°C. For 
bacterial DNA and RNA extraction, the small intestinal and 
liver were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. All animal 
experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Southern Medical University Affiliated Nanfang Hospital (approval 
no. 20180415-NF325). All animal treatments were carried out 
in accordance with the Guidelines on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the Chinese Council on Animal Research and the Guidelines of Animal Care. 
Measurement of biochemical parameters in the serum and 
liver 
The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The mice’s liver homogenate (1 g of liver tissue and 10 mL of sterilizing saline) was added into Folch solution (chloroform: formaldehyde=2:1 [v/v]), mixed well and centrifuged (4,500×g, 5 minutes). The supernatant of the liver was collected. The levels of 
high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and TC, TG and 
ASTase activity and ALTase activity were determined using test 
kits (Biosino Biotechnology and Science Inc., Beijing, China). 
Endotoxin levels (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) were measured by 
using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay endotoxin assay 
kit (Charles River Lab, Wilmington, MA, USA). The concentrations of acetate and butyrate were analyzed by Agilent 1260 
Infinity high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; 
Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the report of 
Adler et al. [32]. 
Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction
Total RNA of the collected tissue was extracted by using a 
TranZol RNA Extraction Kit (Trans Gen Biotech, Beijing, China). Afterward, cDNA was obtained from the total RNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio, 
Dalian, China). Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), TNF-α, and IL-6 were 
completed by using SYBR premix from Takara Bio. Primer sequences used for mRNA quantification are presented in Supplementary Table 1. 
Sequences of the primers used in the lipid metabolism gene 
detection are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Fecal DNA 
was isolated using the QIAmp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed 
using different genus- and phyla-specific primers for different 
bacterial groups according to the Kump et al. [33]. 
Statistical analysis 
The software package SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL, USA) was used for data analysis. All data are presented as 
the mean±standard deviation, and statistical significance was 
performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed 
by least significant difference for multiple comparisons. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. 
RESULTS
Screening of probiotics from the fecal microbiota of 
healthy adults 
High levels of cholesterol and TGs were associated with the 
formation of hyperlipidemia [34]. To obtain the strain with a 
highly effective lipid-lowering function, 47 candidates isolated 
from fecal samples were examined. The results are shown in 
Fig. 1A. Isolate V exhibited the highest activity on TG clearance (68% TG clearance, 25% CC). The IX isolate showed the 
highest activity on CC. Interestingly, isolate X exhibited outstanding performance, with cholesterol and TG clearance of 
57% and 53%, respectively. The selected candidate isolates (X, 
IX, V) were cultured in the simulated gastric fluid. Fortunately, 
the survival rates of isolates V and X were up to 87.4% and 
78.6%, respectively. However, the IX isolates had relatively low 
bile resistance (survival rates <20%). Meanwhile, ∆lag phase 
of the tested isolates was investigated. The results showed that 
the growth of isolates X was slower than that of isolates V with 
a long ∆lag phase of 2.1 hours (Fig. 1B). Based on the 16S 
rDNA sequence identification, strain V, X was B. bifidum and 
L. plantarum, respectively. To enhance the performances of the 
strains synergistically, the ratio of LB was optimized in vitro. 
The result showed that the cholesterol-TG clearance rate was 
up to the highest with a C×T value of 0.47, while the ratio of 
LB was 1:2 (Fig. 1C). 
Insulin resistance is a cardinal feature of NAFLD [35]. Insulin resistance plays an important role during the development 
of NAFLD and progression to NASH [36]. To increase insulin 
sensitivity, polysaccharides derived from different sources were 
screened. The results showed that most of the tested polysac-

charides can improve insulin resistance. In particular, compared to the other sources, the S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide showed good performance with an ISI value of –4.26 
was selected to reduce insulin resistance (Fig. 1D). Next, 50 
mg/kg/day S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide was observed 
to improve insulin resistance (Fig. 1E). 
Effects of probiotic combination (LBM) on body index
After HFD-induced treatment, the liver weight and body 
weight in the HFD group mice were significantly higher than 
those fed the ND. However, after LB or LBM treatment, a reduction in body weight was observed (Table 1, Fig. 1F). The 
total body weight of the LB group and LBM group was reduced 
by 12.5% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to the HFD 
mouse models. This weight loss was not related to reduced 
food intake (Fig. 1G) [37]. In addition, compared to the HFD 
group, a significant reduction of the liver was observed in the 
HFD+LB group. Moreover, S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide contributed to reducing the liver index values of HFD 
groups; however, the promoting effect was not significant (Table 1). The liver TC levels and liver TG levels were increased in 
the HFD group compared to the control group. In contrast, the 
liver TC and TG levels can be decreased by LB (1:2) in mice fed 
a HFD (Fig. 2A and B). The lipids can be reduced by LB or 
LBM, where the increased total short-chain fatty acid concentration (the metabolism products of lipids) in cecal content has 
been observed (Fig. 2D). After 6 weeks of HFD consumption, 
the mice showed increased glucose blood levels and insulin resistance. After LB or LBM treatment, the blood glucose levels 
were reduced (close to the control group), and the insulin resistance was improved. Compared to the HFD group, HOMAIR in the LBM group was reduced by 66.3%, LBM has the potential to reduce insulin resistance and improve insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2E, F, and J). In addition, NAFLD mice fed with LB 
(1:2) promoted excretion of cholesterol and total bile acid (Fig. 
2C). Insulin sensitivity, as determined by the glucose disappearance rate (KITT) (Fig. 2I), ISI, or HOMA-IR (Fig. 2F and 
J), was decreased in HFD group mice and showed improvement after LB or LBM treatment. In the OGTT, the blood glucose increased to a maximum after 30 minutes of oral administration of glucose in all groups (Fig. 2G and H). This increased blood glucose in the HFD group was significantly decreased after administration of LBM (Fig. 2G). The inhibitory 
effect of LBM on blood glucose elevation by HFD treatment 
has been clearly reflected by the AUCglucose values (Fig. 2H). 
Effects of probiotic combination (LBM) on lipid profiles
The results showed that the serum TC, low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), and TG levels of the HFD group decreased significantly by treatment with probiotic LB (1:2) (Table 
2). Compared to the ND group, the HDL level decreased 
significantly in the HFD group. In contrast, the HDL level of 
HFD-treated mice increased when supplemented with LB (1:2). 
Furthermore, serum free fatty acid (FFA), ALTase, ASTase, 
LDL-C, TG, and TC levels in the HFD group were reduced by 
supplementation with LBM significantly. 
Effect of combination (LBM) on gut microbiota
The relative abundance of gut microbiota at the phylum and 
genus levels was investigated. For the ND group, Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes (with 80% to 90% abundance) were the main 
members of the gut bacteria community presenting in the feces at the phylum level. Moreover, compared to the ND group, 
the abundance of Cyanobacteria was increased by 68.75% in

the HFD group (Fig. 3A). After administering the probiotic 
combination (LBM), the abundance of Cyanobacteria in HFDfed mice was reduced. 
Moreover, the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in the HFD 
group decreased by 42.6% compared to the ND group. However, the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes was increased by 
14.3% and 34.04% relative to the HFD group via administration probiotics LB and LBM, respectively. At the genus level, 
the expression profiles of each group (16 highly abundant species >1.0% abundance), including the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, and Alistipes, 
were analyzed (Fig. 3B). Of those species, the abundance of 
Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides was increased 
by treatment with LB probiotics, while the Oscillospira and 
Alistipes were decreased by LBM. 
Effects of probiotic combination (LBM) on endotoxin and 
liver inflammation
The concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and LPS were investigated. The total concentrations of acetate and butyrate were significantly reduced by 81.7% and 80% in the HFD groups compared to the ND group. The acetate and butyrate concentrations 
of NAFLD mice were increased by supplementation with LBM 
(Fig. 4A and B). Moreover, the HFD group with a high LPS 
concentration was significantly reduced by probiotic (LB). 
Moreover, the ability of probiotic LB was enhanced by S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide, the LPS concentration of LB 
group (0.23 endotoxin unit [EU]/mL) decreased by 73.6% compared to the HFD group (0.87 EU/mL); however, the difference 
between LB and LBM is not significant (P>0.05) (Fig. 4C). 
Based on the changes in short-chain organic acid concentrations and gut microbial abundance in HFD-treated mice, we 
were trying to reveal the global influence of LBM on liver inflammation. Inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) 
of the liver were investigated. The results showed that inflammatory markers were modulated by the probiotic combination 
(LBM). Compared to the HFD group, the mRNA concentrations of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) were reduced by LB

the LBM group was significantly lower than that in the ND 
group. 
The effect of LBM on lipid metabolism was investigated (Fig. 
4E), and the results are shown in Fig. 4F. In the way of de novo
synthesis, increased hepatic expression of the four genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FAS], stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 [SCD-1], and sterol regulatory element

of ACC, FAS, and SREBP-1c was clearly reduced after LBM 
treatment. The change in SCD-1 gene expression between the 
HFD group and the HFD supplemented with LB or LBM 
group was not significant (P>0.05). Compared to the HFD 
group, a significant decrease in the hepatic expression of 
SREBP-1c was induced by LBM (P<0.01) (Fig. 4E and F). Regarding oxidation metabolism, genes associated with fatty acid 
oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α
[PPARα] and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a [CPT-1a]) 
showed a significant improvement with the help of LBM 
(P<0.05) (Fig. 4F). 
DISCUSSION
Blood cholesterol can be reduced by various strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, which is safe for consumption, such as 
Lactobacilli rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. casei, and L. plantarum
[38,39]. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been used for the 
treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis [40], which highlighted a disease improvement or resolution rate of 83% to 92% [41]. Therefore, 
the fecal microbiota of healthy adults was selected for the 
screening of probiotics (Lactobacillus), and most of the isolates 
performed a high CC capability in this study. 
In addition, insulin resistance has been regarded as a key 
factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome [11]. Hepatocyte injury and inflammation could be promoted by hepatic 
insulin resistance [16,42]. It has been reported that different 
sources of polysaccharides (such as Ganoderma lucidum) 
could improve insulin resistance by regulating gut microbiota 
composition and inflammatory cytokines [43]. In the present 
study, different polysaccharides were screened, and the insulin 
sensitivity was improved by polysaccharides from S. miltiorrhiza Bunge, which was the outstanding performer among the 
tested polysaccharides. Finally, the FFA, ALTase, ASTase, LDLC, TG and TC levels of HFD-treated mice in serum were significantly reduced by LB (1:2). The function of the probiotic 
LB was enhanced by S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide. In 
previous research, polysaccharides have been used to reduce 
IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α concentrations in plasma [43]. TNF-α
expression and hepatic inflammation can be reduced by L. 
rhamnosus and other probiotics [44]. Our research showed 
that the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 can be reduced by LBM; we speculate that it was the result of the synergy between L. plantarum-B. bifidum and S. miltiorrhiza Bunge. 
Furthermore, it was shown that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can be regrouped by LBM in this study. The 
abundance of Cyanobacteria in HFD-fed mice was reduced by 
administering LBM. Previous studies indicated that microbiota composition is related to insulin resistance. Increased Cyanobacteria (gram-negative bacteria) have been demonstrated 
as contributors to increased LPS levels, and all types of Cyanobacteria can produce various toxins, which are involved in various human diseases via increasing the hepatic damage triggered by hepatotoxins [45]. Moreover, we found that Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes can be increased by LB and LBM. Numerous studies have suggested that Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios 
are a compositional biomarker for obesity [46] and type 1 diabetes mellitus [47]. Moreover, fecal extracts of ulcerative colitis 
patients were characterized by reduced levels of butyrate, acetate, methylamine, and trimethylamine in comparison with a 
control population [48,49]. The acetate and butyrate concentrations of NAFLD mice were increased by supplementation 
LBM in this study. This result was consistent with the report of 
Turnbaugh et al. [49] and de Wit et al. [50]. Therefore, LBM 
combination has the potential to be used as a therapeutic for 
ameliorating NAFLD via modulation of the gut microbiota 
and improvement of insulin resistance.
