Abstract
Background: The Infectious Diseases Society of America published in 2000 practical guidelines for the management of
cryptococcosis. However, treatment strategies have not been fully validated in the various clinical settings due to exclusion
criteria during therapeutic trials. We assessed here the optimal therapeutic strategies for severe cryptococcosis using the
observational prospective CryptoA/D study after analyzing routine clinical care of cryptococcosis in university or tertiary
care hospitals.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Patients were enrolled if at least one culture grew positive with Cryptococcus neoformans.
Control of sterilization was warranted 2 weeks (Wk2) and 3 months (Mo3) after antifungal therapy onset. 208 HIV-positive or
-negative adult patients were analyzed. Treatment failure (death or mycological failure) at Wk2 and Mo3 was the main
outcome measured. Combination of amphotericin B+flucytosine (AMB+5FC) was the best regimen for induction therapy in
patients with meningoencephalitis and in all patients with high fungal burden and abnormal neurology. In those patients,
treatment failure at Wk2 was 26% in the AMB+5FC group vs. 56% with any other treatments (p,0.001). In patients treated
with AMB+5FC, factors independently associated with Wk2 mycological failure were high serum antigen titer (OR
[95%CI] = 4.43[1.21–16.23], p = 0.025) and abnormal brain imaging (OR = 3.89[1.23–12.31], p = 0.021) at baseline.
Haematological malignancy (OR = 4.02[1.32–12.25], p = 0.015), abnormal neurology at baseline (OR = 2.71[1.10–6.69],
p = 0.030) and prescription of 5FC for less than 14 days (OR = 3.30[1.12–9.70], p = 0.030) were independently associated with
treatment failure at Mo3.
Conclusion/Significance: Our results support the conclusion that induction therapy with AMB+5FC for at least 14 days
should be prescribed rather than any other induction treatments in all patients with high fungal burden at baseline
regardless of their HIV serostatus and of the presence of proven meningoencephalitis.

Introduction
Major information on the best therapeutic strategies for
cryptococcal meningoencephalitis derives from therapeutic trials
involving HIV-positive [1,2,3] or HIV-negative patients [4].
According to the current Infectious Diseases Society of America
(IDSA) guidelines, the treatment should depend on anatomic site
and host’s immunological status. Induction therapy using a
combination of amphotericin B (AMB, 0.7–1 mg/kg/d) and
flucytosine (5FC, 100 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks followed by a
consolidation phase of 10 weeks by fluconazole (FCZ, 400 mg/d)
should be prescribed for central nervous system infection (CNS) in
both HIV-positive and -negative patients, based mostly on data
extrapolated from trials in HIV-infected patients [5] and retrospective studies on HIV-negative patients [6,7]. Alternative options to the
AMB+5FC combination are advocated and the place of 5FC is still
questioned by numerous clinicians especially in HIV-negative
patients or in case of mild-to-moderate symptoms, even if
AMB+5FC combination therapy is the most fungicidal regimen
for CNS infections [8]. Since they are excluded from therapeutic
trials, data are missing on the optimal antifungal treatment for non
CNS infections and for the most severe cases of meningoencephalitis.
Finally, the trials design made mandatory the switch from induction
to consolidation treatment on day 15. Thus, culture results for
samples collected at that time are not taken into account whereas
they influence subsequent outcome [9].
Using data from a prospective observational cohort of HIVpositive and -negative patients treated in France for cryptococcosis
with or without CNS involvement, we previously showed that lack of
5FC was an independent factor of mycological failure at Wk2
whatever the HIV status and the clinical presentation at baseline
[10]. We also defined criteria of severity at baseline that go beyond
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2870

the documentation of CNS infection or abnormal neurology. We
here analyzed the impact of antifungal treatment strategies
prescribed in routine clinical practice on outcome 2 and 12 weeks
after the diagnosis of cryptococcosis, based on appraisal of CNS
involvement, IDSA guidelines and our previously defined severity
criteria [10].
Methods
Study design
The CryptoA/D study enrolled HIV-positive or -negative adults
experiencing a first episode of culture-proven cryptococcosis and
treated in French university hospitals or tertiary care centers [10].
The design of the study has already been detailed [10]. Briefly, for
each patient, a workup including culture of blood, cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and urine was requested at baseline to systematically
evaluate fungal burden and dissemination. Controls of sterilisation
for all initially infected body sites (i.e. those with positive culture)
were systematically done two weeks (Wk2) and three months
(Mo3) after the onset of antifungal therapy. Other investigations
and all therapeutic decisions (choice of drugs, duration and
dosage) were left to the clinician in charge. All data were recorded
until Mo3 through a standardized questionnaire by the local
investigators. Missing information was systematically checked with
both the clinician and the microbiologist. The study was approved
by the local ethical committee and notified to the French Ministry
of Health (registration # DGS970089). Written informed consent
was obtained for all patients.
Definitions
A case was defined by isolation of C. neoformans from at least one
body site. Cases were classified as meningoencephalitis (C. neoformanspositive CSF culture, positive direct examination, and/or CSF
antigen testing) or as extrameningeal cryptococcosis. A threshold of
$1:512 for serum or CSF antigen titer was selected since it is linked
to prognosis [10] and subsequent relapse [11]. Abnormal neurology
was defined by presence of seizures, abnormal mental status and/or
neurological defect. Results of brain imaging were reported after
evaluation by the local radiologist. Our criteria of severity included
abnormal neurology, meningoencephalitis, fungemia, dissemination,
high antigen titer [10]. Induction therapy defined the regimen
prescribed between baseline and the Wk2 evaluation. Consolidation
therapy followed the Wk2 workup. Only prescriptions lasting at least
5 days were taken into account. Optimal induction treatment was
defined for AMB and 5FC in terms of dosage (0.7–1 mg/kg/d for
AMB and 100615 mg/kg/d for 5FC) or duration (1462 days)
according to the 2000 IDSA guidelines [5]. Intralipids did not
modify the optimal dosage of AMB, whereas 5mg/kg/d of
amphotericin B lipid complex (AbelcetH) and 3 mg/kg/d of
liposomal amphotericin B (AmbisomeH) were required to be
considered optimal. Cumulative doses were calculated as: [duration
in days6daily dosage in mg/kg6weight in kg].
Mycological outcome was only evaluated in patients for whom at
least one body site was sampled at the time of workup. Mycological
failure meant that at least one of the cultured samples contained
viable yeasts. Mycological failure or death up to 4 days after Wk2
workup was recorded as treatment failure at Wk2. Mycological
failure or later death was recorded as treatment failure at Mo3.
Statistical analysis
We first described and compared the major characteristics of
the patients and the Wk2 outcome according to the induction
therapy strategies. We then assessed how the current IDSA
guidelines [5] were followed and the factors influencing treatment’s choice. Finally, we investigated the determinants of Wk2
and Mo3 outcomes.
Clinical presentation and outcome were compared according to
therapeutic regimens with the x2 test for qualitative parameters (or
the Fisher’s exact test when necessary) or the Kruskal-Wallis’s or
the Mann-Whitney’s test for quantitative parameters. Multinomial
logistic regression [12] was used to analyze the influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on induction therapy (AMB
or FCZ vs. AMB+5FC) in the assessable population as a whole and
in the subpopulation of HIV-positive patients with meningoencephalitis. Logistic regression models were performed to investigate the
factors associated with mycological failure at the Wk2 workup and
those associated with treatment failure at the Mo3 workup [13]. All
regression final models were obtained using the backward
procedure. First, all covariates with a p-value under 0.25 in
univariate analysis and 2 order-interactions with a p-value under
0.05 were simultaneously entered into the regression model. Next,
the set of covariates with the largest p-value was iteratively removed
from the model until all of the covariates (or blocks of covariates)
remaining in the reduced model had a p-value under 0.05. A p-value
of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed with Stata software, Version 9.0.
Results
Population
Induction therapy was assessable for 208 patients including a
majority of HIV-positive male patients with meningoencephalitis
(Table 1, Figure 1). At the time of the Wk2 workup, 10 patients
had died, and 184/198 patients alive were assessable for
mycological outcome. At the time of the Mo3 workup, 9 patients
were lost to follow-up, 20 had died, and 148/169 patients alive
were available for mycological evaluation (Figure 2).
Induction therapy and its influence on outcome of
patients with cryptococcosis
Induction therapies included AMB (159/208, 76%) mostly
associated with 5FC (98/159, 62%) or FCZ (75/208, 36%) mostly
alone (41/75, 55%) (Table 1). AMB was sometimes administered
in intralipids (n = 31), liposomal amphotericin B (n = 10) or
amphotericin B lipid complex (n = 7). French clinicians followed
the IDSA guidelines (AMB+5FC) for 85/173 (49%) of the patients
with meningoencephalitis. Only 87 (46.5%) of the 187 patients
fulfilling our severity criteria [10] received the AMB+5FC
combination. Prescriptions were not different in tertiary care
centers or university hospitals (data not shown).
Despite more severe infections based on our criteria, mycological failure at Wk2 was significantly less frequent among patients
treated with AMB+5FC than any other regimen (20/86 (23%) vs.
47/100 (47%), p,0.001) (Table 1). This was still true with the
same yield of sterilisation for patients with meningoencephalitis
and even those with abnormal neurology at baseline, whereas in
the case of abnormal neurology the percentage of mycological
failure increased from 42% to 75% in patients treated with FCZ
alone, and from 59% to 77% in those treated with AMB alone.
The highest rate of mycological failure was observed for AMB
alone. Addition of AMB to FCZ did not better than either drug
alone. The small number of patients treated with FCZ+5FC (n = 8)
or AMB+FCZ+5FC (n = 5) prevents definitive conclusion but
none of these treatments did better than AMB+5FC, especially in
the most severe cases. There was no statistical differences for
patients treated by AMB+5FC with AMB in lipid formulations
(n = 22) or AMB deoxycholate (n = 71) in terms of disease severity
or outcome (data not shown). When we analyzed the proportion of

treatment failures, AMB+5FC did better than any other treatment
regimen in patients with meningoencephalitis and abnormal
neurology (10/40 (25%) vs. 26/36 (72%), p,0.001). With
extended criteria of severity, AMB+5FC still did better than any
other regimen (22/84 (26%) vs. 52/93 (56%), respectively,
p,0.001). In the multivariate analysis involving all patients
(n = 171), independent parameters of treatment failures at Wk2
were lack of induction therapy with AMB+5FC vs. any other
induction therapies (OR [95% CI] = 5.16 [2.44–10.91],
p,0.0001), presence of meningoencephalitis (OR = 4.45 [1.34–
14.79], p = 0.015) and high serum antigen titer (OR = 2.99 [1.43–
6.24], p = 0.003) at baseline. In the multivariate analysis involving
patients with meningoencephalitis (n = 123), independent parameters of treatment failures at Wk2 were lack of induction therapy
with AMB+5FC vs. any other induction therapies (OR [95%
CI] = 51.25 [9.67–271.52], p,0.0001), abnormal brain imaging
(OR = 4.18 [1.33–123.17], p = 0.014), presence of fungemia
(OR = 3.07 [1.13–8.31], p = 0.027) and high CSF antigen titer
[17.80 [3.79–83.54], p,0.0001) at baseline. For both models (all
patients or patients with meningoencephalitis), interactions
between covariates were checked. None was significant.
Determinants of induction therapy’s choice
The majority of patients (n = 174) were treated with AMB or
FCZ alone, or AMB+5FC. Patients treated with AMB did not
significantly differ from those treated with the combination
therapy except for the lower percentage of patients with high
CSF antigen titer in the AMB-treated group (Table 2). By contrast,
compared to patients treated with the combination, the proportion
of HIV-infection, abnormal neurology, meningoencephalitis,
fungemia, high serum or CSF antigen titers was significantly
lower in patients treated with FCZ whereas the proportion of older
patients was higher. In the multinomial logistic regression
comparing the 3 treatment groups with the AMB+5FC combination as the reference, the presence of high CSF antigen titers, and
an age under 40 years were the only factors associated with the
prescription of the combination vs. FCZ alone and only the
presence of high CSF antigen titers was determinant for the
prescription of the combination vs. AMB alone.
In HIV-infected patients with meningoencephalitis who received as induction therapy either AMB or FCZ alone or the
combination AMB+5FC (n = 120), factors which significantly
discriminated between combination and FCZ alone in the
univariate analysis were the presence of fungemia, high serum or
CSF antigen titer, and hospitalization in university hospitals with a
trend towards modification of prescription in older patients, while
only high CSF antigen titer was identified as a factor associated
with the initiation of combination therapy vs. AMB alone (Table
S1). In the multinomial logistic regression, the presence of high
CSF antigen titer and an age under 40 were independently
associated with combination therapy vs. FCZ alone while only
high CSF antigen titer was determinant for the prescription of
AMB+5FC compared to AMB alone.
Determinants of early outcome (Wk2) after induction
therapy with the AMB+5FC combination therapy
Among the 86 patients given AMB+5FC and assessable at Wk2,
the proportion of men, and high serum or CSF antigen titer was
significantly higher than with other treatments. There was also a
trend towards more disseminated infections and infection by
serotype A among those who experienced mycological failure at
Wk2 than among those who were cured. An optimal duration and
dosage of each drug in the combination had no impact. Factors
independently associated with mycological failure at Wk2 were
high serum antigen titer (OR [95%CI] = 4.43 [1.21–16.23],
p = 0.025) and abnormal brain imaging (OR [95%CI] = 3.89
[1.23–12.31], p = 0.021) at baseline (Table 3).

meningoencephalitis (CSF pos) or with no proven central nervous system involvement (CSF neg) were enrolled in the prospective multicenter
CryptoA/D observational study. The Wk2 workup requested control of sterilisation of the body sites infected with C. neoformans at baseline.
Treatments prescribed for more than 5 days included amphotericin B (AMB), flucytosine (5FC) and/or fluconazole (FCZ). Overall, of the 208 patients
eligible for analysis at baseline, at the time of the Wk2 workup, 184 were alive with mycological outcome assessed, 14 were alive without mycological
evaluation and 10 had died.

Strategies of consolidation therapy and their influence
on Mo3 outcome
Of 189 patients surviving the Wk2 workup by more than 4 days,
168 were eligible for analysis of Mo3 outcome (Figure 2). The
induction treatment was sometimes protracted in the consolidation
phase. Four groups were considered: FCZ all along (FCZ(1)FCZ(2)),
AMB followed by FCZ (AMB(1)FCZ(2)), AMB+5FC followed by
FCZ (AMB+5FC(1)FCZ(2)) and ‘‘miscellaneous’’ corresponding to
other induction therapies and/or multiple changes preventing
further description.
Considering the first 3 treatment groups, patients in the
AMB+5FC(1)FCZ(2) group had significantly the more severe
infections, and those in the FCZ(1)FCZ(2) group the less severe ones
(Table S2). Mycological failure was 2.5-fold less frequent in the
AMB+5FC(1)FCZ(2) group (20%) than in the AMB(1)FCZ(2) group
(52%) despite no significant difference in the cumulative dose and
duration of AMB. Of note, direct examination of the Wk2 CSF
samples was still positive in almost 3/4 and 1/2 of the cases in
AMB+5FC(1)FCZ(2) and AMB(1)FCZ(2) treated patients, respectively.
There was a trend toward less treatment failures recorded at Mo3 in
the AMB+5FC(1)FCZ(2) group than in the others.
In the univariate analysis, the proportion of abnormal neurology at
baseline, haematological malignancies and 5FC prescription lasting
less than 14 days was significantly higher in patients recorded as
treatment failures at Mo3 than in the others (Table 4). There was a
trend towards a higher proportion of mycological failure at the Wk2
workup in those who were subsequently recorded Mo3 failures than
in those who were not. Mean duration and cumulative dose of FCZ
were significantly lower in case of treatment failure at Mo3 compared
to treatment success, as expected since FCZ duration was shorter in
patients dying between Wk2 and Mo3. In the multivariate analysis
haematological malignancy (OR [95%CI] = 4.02 [1.32–12.25],
p = 0.015), abnormal neurology at baseline (OR [95%CI] = 2.71
[1.10–6.69], p = 0.030) and prescription of 5FC for less than 14 days

Discussion
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is still a major health
problem in developed countries with the burden of the AIDS
epidemics reaching a prevalence of up to 18% in the most severely
immunocompromised patients [14]. Almost 20% of the patients
die within the first 3 months [10,15,16]. That figure has not been
changed by the introduction of HAART even if long term survival
of HIV-infected patients has increased drastically [11,17].
Mortality rate is even higher in HIV-negative patients especially
for patients with haematological malignancy [7,10,18] and in
developing countries [15,19]. Improving the prognosis of cryptococcosis relies upon three factors, and first, the control of the
underlying immunodeficiency [20,21] as shown by the beneficial
effect of HAART (with the remaining question of the best timing
for its introduction [22]), and preliminary results obtained with
administration of gamma interferon or monoclonal antibodies
[23,24]. The other two parameters are a better appraisal of disease
severity at baseline and optimization of antifungal treatment
strategies which we aim at deciphering here. Results obtained
from the analysis of an observational cohort are not biased by a
series of entry criteria in therapeutic protocols and show the actual
outcomes of cryptococcosis in the general medical community
[20]. One should keep in mind however that the study design

the induction phase and 9 were lost to follow-up leaving 189 patients for the description of disease and outcome. At the Mo3 workup, 168 patients
were assessable including 148 patients alive with mycological assessment and 20 who had died. The remaining 21 patients alive were not included in
the final analysis since they had no mycological evaluation at the Mo3 workup.

cannot provide equal figures in each treatment group with the risk
of influencing significance. Thus, the most useful and relevant data
obtained through observational cohorts are those confirming
results established during randomised therapeutic trials. Furthermore, they can guide the redaction of future practical guidelines
by showing how clinicians interpret the current recommendations.
Evaluation of cryptococcosis severity represents a major factor for
the management of the patients. Many parameters are predictive of
treatment failure including underlying malignancy, cranial hypertension, dissemination, and high antigen titer [3,7,9,10,18,25]. High
serum or CSF antigen titers at baseline have been associated with
early mycological failure regardless of the HIV serostatus [10], in
HIV-infected patients with meningoencephalitis [9,26] and in the
subgroup of patients treated with AMB+5FC as induction therapy,
while high serum antigen titer over time is an independent
parameter predictive of cryptococcosis relapse in HIV-infected
patients [11].Abnormal brain imaging at baseline previously
associated with an increased probability of death [10] was here
associated with treatment failure at the Wk2 workup in patients with
meningoencephalitis including the subgroup of patients given
AMB+5FC, yet considered the optimal induction treatment. Of
note, the presence of cryptococcosis-related lesions has been
significantly associated with high serum or CSF antigen titer
independently of abnormal neurology [27]. Altogether, these data
suggest that investigating brain lesions may be critical for optimal
management of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
Initial antifungal treatment strategy is a critical determinant of
outcome. Major studies supporting the prescription of 5FC in
combination with AMB for the induction treatment of cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis in HIV-positive [2] or -negative [4] patients
have been published. Addition of 5FC during the induction phase
was an independent factor of sterilisation at Wk2 [2]. AMB+5FC
was the most fungicidal treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in
Thai patients not receiving HAART [8]. Furthermore, the factor
best associated with relapse was the patient having not received
flucytosine during the induction phase [28]. One should however
keep in mind that therapeutic trials exclude patients with severe
abnormal neurology. Furthermore, in routine clinical practice,

prescription of 5FC is often restricted to the most severe patients and
to patients without haematological disorders(despite limited side
effects outside the setting of renal failure ever since the recommended
daily dosage has been dropped to 100 mg/kg/d). Finally, treatment
is often stopped when the isolate is tested resistant to 5FC, while the
combination can still be synergistic in vitro and in vivo [29,30].
Thus, convincing data showing that AMB+5FC is the optimal
treatment in the ‘‘real life’’ is probably warranted. We analyzed what
determined the prescription of AMB +5FC versus that of AMB or
FCZ alone for induction treatment. In the multinomial logistic
regression, the parameter independently associated with prescription
of AMB+5FC rather than AMB was a high CSF antigen titer
regardless of the HIV serostatus. Those independently associated
with the prescription of AMB+5FC rather than FCZ were a high
CSF antigen titer and an age under 40 years suggesting that the
‘‘older’’ patients were not given the current best therapeutic option.
We indeed showed that outcome at Wk2 was statistically better
with AMB+5FC compared to any other regimen including AMB
alone despite more severe infections in the former group.
Furthermore, the proportion of Wk2 mycological failure did not
increase in the most severe cases treated with AMB+5FC in
contrast to what occurred in all other treatment groups except
FCZ+5FC. The drastic difference in outcome between the two
groups is probably due to the fact that more severe cases than
those usually enrolled in the therapeutic trials were considered
here with 40% of abnormal neurology compared to less than 20%
in previous studies [2,8]. Furthermore, fungal burden was also
increased based on a higher proportion of patients with high
antigen titers and positive India ink staining in the AMB+5FC vs.
the AMB group. Given the better fungicidal efficacy of AMB+5FC
this is likely to have increased the differences. We analyzed how
taking into account severity criteria influenced outcomes. Compared to patients treated with other regimens, the percentage of
treatment failure was significantly lower in patients with
meningoencephalitis treated with the AMB+5FC combination as
recommended by IDSA [5]. With criteria of severity extended
beyond CNS involvement [10], AMB+5FC still did better than
any other regimen. Altogether these data suggest that AMB+5FC
is the optimal treatment for severe cryptococcosis.
In the setting of a therapeutical trial on cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in HIV-positive patients, AMB compared favourably
with FCZ, the latter being associated with more frequent early
deaths and delayed CSF sterilization [1]. Disappointing results
were obtained with AMB alone in Thailand [19]. And our data
show that, AMB alone did not better than FCZ alone in patients
with meningoencephalitis in terms of mycological sterilization at
Wk2, both being by far less efficient than AMB+5FC. It is unlikely
that this poor efficacy of AMB alone was related to AMB resistance,
since very few resistant isolates have been described. Furthermore,
there is no correlation between in vitro and in vivo results [31]
except with a recently modified broth macrodilution method [32].
Whether this technique can be used routinely and applied to other
antifungal drugs remains to be determined. The use of lipid
formulations of AMB is another issue. Here, there was no
difference in terms of outcome when comparing patients treated
with AMB+5FC as AMB deoxycholate or administered in lipid
formulations. Use of intralipids was dropped at the end of the 90s
because of no substantial beneficial effect over the use of AMB
deoxycholate [33]. Data on amphotericin B lipid complex [34] and
liposomal AMB [35] are limited. Whether any lipid AMB
formulation should be used rather than AMB deoxycholate in
the AMB+5FC combination is a real question, often answered
empirically to prevent side effects when cost is not a major issue.
When considering the other strategies, our results demonstrate
that FCZ alone was associated with 42% mycological failure at
Wk2 despite the fact that 40% of the patients in that group did not
have meningoencephalitis and that only 15% had high antigen
titers. Keeping in mind the small number of patients in each of the
FCZ+5FC, AMB+FCZ or AMB+FCZ+5FC groups, none of the
combination did better than AMB+5FC. Of note, Bicanic and
colleagues recently underlined in South Africa the high relapse
rates after treatment with FCZ alone at conventional dosages [36].
Increasing the doses of FCZ improved efficacy of the AMB+FCZ
combination in one still unpublished report [37]. In our study, the
second best regimen for which mycological failure did not increase
with disease severity was FCZ+5FC. Keeping in mind that FCZ is
less active in case of high fungal burden [38], one may wonder if
increasing FCZ doses could improve efficacy of the FCZ+5FC
combination as reported in the experimental model [39]. This
alternative regimen should be studied in poor resources areas
where AMB use remains difficult. Of note, oral and intravenous
formulations of 5FC do not differ in a major way in terms of
pharmacokinetics and efficacy [40]. It will require however that
5FC was made commercially available in these countries [21].
Another issue in the optimization of treatment strategies for
cryptococcosis is the potential utility of protracting induction

regimen. Indeed, current recommendations are based on results
obtained in a therapeutic trial where switch from AMB65FC to
azoles was mandatory at Wk2 whatever the culture results at that
time [2]. The association between mycological failure at Wk2 and
treatment failure at Mo3 demonstrated by Robinson et al.[9] and
shown here in an observational cohort as a trend suggest that
continuation of the optimal therapy until sterilisation has been
demonstrated may be the best option. In addition to recently
showing that the lack of 5FC was deleterious for mycological
outcome at Wk2 [10], we showed here that less than 14 days of
5FC was independently associated with treatment failure at Mo3.
This suggests not only that AMB+5FC should be the first choice
for induction treatment in the most severe cases, but that 5FC
could be added secondarily if omitted at first and should
prescribed for at least 14 days.
Thus, this observational study with its limitation compared to a
randomized therapeutic trial but the assets of the ‘‘real life’’
confirms that the AMB+5FC combination is the optimal
antifungal strategy for the induction treatment of severe
cryptococcosis [5]. In addition, our data strongly suggest that
recommending the AMB+5FC combination therapy for at least 14
days for patients with cryptococcosis fulfilling extended criteria of
severity [10] decreased the rate of mycological failure at Wk2 and
could potentially improve outcome at Mo3.
