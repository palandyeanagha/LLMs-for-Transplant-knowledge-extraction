Abstract
Background: Though several cases of upper gastrointestinal tract injury caused by transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE) have been reported, gastric perforation is very rare. Herein, we report the case of TEE-associated gastric
perforation that was successfully treated conservatively.
Case presentation: An 82-year-old man underwent mitral valve repair. Postoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and computed tomography revealed gastric perforation. Surgical treatment was initially considered, but
conservative management was selected to avoid increasing operative stress, to minimize the need for total
gastrectomy (including the lower esophagus), and to minimize the risk of a potential intraperitoneal infection
spreading to the thoracic cavity.
Conclusion: Conservative management of gastric perforation can be successful even when the perforation is
recognized later than 12 h following the event, provided that there are no abdominal symptoms and no
signs of peritoneal effusion or sepsis. Our experience suggests that conservative management is a feasible
option for treating TEE-associated gastric perforation in appropriately selected cases.

Background
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is widely used
for perioperative hemodynamic monitoring in clinical
settings [1]. However, numerous complications including
oropharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, and gastric injury
have been reported [2], as TEE is a semi-invasive monitoring modality, unlike transthoracic echocardiography.
While several reports have described TEE-associated
upper gastrointestinal tract injuries including bleeding,
erosion, laceration, and perforation, gastric perforation
represents a very rare complication [2–5]. Herein, we report a case of gastric perforation by TEE that was
treated conservatively, without surgical procedures.
Case presentation
An 82-year-old man (height, 167 cm; weight, 58 kg) was
scheduled for mitral valve repair due to exacerbated
heart failure symptoms. His past medical history included aortic valvular stenosis with post-aortic mechanical valve replacement and atrial fibrillation treated with
oral warfarin. The patient had no upper gastrointestinal
symptoms or related medical history. Written informed
consent was obtained from the patient.
Four days before mitral repair surgery, warfarin was replaced with intravenous heparin (10,000 units/day), which
was administered until 6 h preoperatively. Under general
anesthesia, a TEE probe was inserted, without resistance, to
evaluate perioperative cardiac function and residual regurgitation using mid-esophageal and trans-gastric views, as
appropriate. The inferior vena cava (IVC) could not be visualized in trans-gastric view, despite several manipulations
of the probe with the venous cannula placed into the IVC.
After cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), an unexpectedly large

echo-free space in the stomach was detected on TEE. The
mitral valve repair was successfully undergone, the TEE
probe was removed, and a nasogastric tube was inserted.
Surprisingly, 700 mL of dark brown blood was aspirated
from the nasogastric tube. We suspected upper gastrointestinal injury, but the patient was transferred to the intensive
care unit, as the blood was dark brown and the bleeding appeared to have stopped.
Approximately 6 h postoperatively, another 100 mL of
fresh blood was aspirated from the nasogastric tube. Thus,
we immediately performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination and computed tomography
(CT) scan. The EGD examination showed a mucosal laceration spanning from the esophagogastric junction to
the gastric body, with a perforation in the center of the laceration (Fig. 1). On this occasion, a clip was placed to
stop the hemorrhage from the injured area, but the perforation was too large to close with the clip under EGD. The
CT scan showed localized free air in the abdominal cavity,
which helped establish a definite diagnosis of gastric perforation (Fig. 2). Initially, surgical treatment was considered for the repair of the perforation. However, we
selected conservative management to avoid increasing operative stress, to minimize the need for total gastrectomy
(including the lower esophagus), and to reduce the risk of
infection spread. Fortunately, spontaneous closure was expected, as there were no abdominal symptoms and the
perforation site was covered with the lesser omentum and
inferior surface of the liver.
Nasogastric tube aspiration was continued postoperatively, and the patient was administered total parenteral
nutrition. On the day of surgery, the patient received
hemostatic therapy with carbazochrome sodium sulfonate
hydrate (100 mg) and tranexamic acid (0.5 g), as well as
routine antibiotics including sulbactam sodium (0.5 g) and
ampicillin sodium (1.0 g). Tazobactam sodium (0.5 g) and
piperacillin sodium (4.0 g) were initiated after diagnosis of
gastric perforation and continued until the perforation site
had healed. Intravenous omeprazole sodium (20 mg) was
used as a proton pump inhibitor until oral intake. On
postoperative day 1, hemostatic therapy included carbazochrome sodium sulfonate hydrate (200 mg), tranexamic
acid (1.5 g), and menatetrenone (20 mg). As there were no
persistent abdominal symptoms and the nasogastric aspirate contained no blood, the tracheal tube was removed on
postoperative day 3. A follow-up CT scan revealed a reduction in the echo-free space in the abdominal cavity,
and upper gastrointestinal examination revealed no leaking of the contrast medium into the abdominal cavity.
Thus, the patient began enteral nutrition on postoperative
day 10 and oral intake on postoperative day 12. To
prevent rebleeding, anticoagulation was restarted only
after enteral nutrition was established (warfarin, 3 mg). To
protect the gastric mucosa, oral esomeprazole (20 mg)
and ecabet sodium (2000 mg) were started upon establishment of oral intake and continued until after discharge. A
follow-up EGD examination on postoperative day 23
revealed that the perforation site had healed, with
scarring (Fig. 3). The patient recovered without any
complications and was discharged from the hospital
on postoperative day 24.
Discussion
The present report described the successful conservative
management of TEE-associated gastric perforation. The

unexpectedly large echo-free space and continuous bleeding from the nasogastric tube were indicative of perforation. EGD and CT were useful imaging modalities for
establishing a definite diagnosis. We selected conservative
management to avoid highly invasive procedures and
minimize the risk of a potential intraperitoneal infection
spreading to the mediastinum, implanted mechanical
valve, and mitral ring. Furthermore, the patient presented
no typical abdominal symptoms including pain, muscular
guarding, or Blumberg’s sign, and the perforation site was
covered by the lesser omentum and inferior surface of the
liver. Conservative management was considered successful, as the patient had recovered sufficiently to resume oral
intake by postoperative day 12.
TEE is widely used in cardiac surgery. Although TEE is
considered minimally invasive, some complications have
been reported. The overall incidence of TEE-associated
morbidity and mortality is 0.2 and 0%, respectively [2]. The
most common complication is severe odynophagia (0.1%),
followed by dental injuries (0.03%), endotracheal tube malpositioning (0.03%), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage
(0.03%), and esophageal perforation (0.01%) [2]. In addition,
one report described splenic injury caused by the TEE
probe [6]. While upper gastrointestinal perforation is an
unusual complication in TEE, it can often become severe.
In the present case, the perforation may have been caused
by the TEE probe being advanced and withdrawn repeatedly to maintain an anteflexed position in the stomach,
allowing visualization of the venous cannula in the IVC. In
order to prevent such complications, it is necessary to select the appropriate TEE probe size, as well as to insert and
operate the TEE probe gently.
Min et al. reported that the risk factors for TEE-associated
perforation were advanced age, prolonged CPB or ventilatory
support, intracardiac procedures, post-CPB hypotension, low
cardiac output, use of vasopressors or an intra-aortic balloon
pump, emergency operations, and systemic anticoagulation
or aspirin therapy [7]. Several of these risk factors were
present in the case reported here, including advanced age,
prolonged CPB (154 min), and anticoagulation therapy
(warfarin).
Many reports have described upper TEE-associated
gastrointestinal perforation [8–11]. Here, we report on
TEE-related perforation of the stomach. Gastric perforation is a clinical condition different from esophageal
perforation. Several cases involving esophageal perforation by TEE were reported, including a few cases with
successful conservative management of the perforation
[8, 9]. On the other hand, gastric perforation is a very
rare complication in TEE, with only three such cases being reported, all treated via surgical intervention [10,
11]. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, the present
case report is the first to describe the successful conservative management of iatrogenic gastric perforation by
TEE. In previously reported cases, open or laparoscopic
surgery was performed for iatrogenic gastric or esophageal perforation by TEE [10, 11], in an effort to prevent
severe infection-related complications such as mediastinitis, peritonitis, and septic shock, which may occur
when treatment for upper gastrointestinal perforation by
TEE is delayed.
The surgical management of gastrointestinal tract perforations is now often replaced by conservative therapy [12].
For example, Merchea et al. reported that non-operative
management of EGD-associated upper gastrointestinal perforation can be successful when there is no evidence of
contrast extravasation or free fluid on radiographic studies
[13]. According to the European Society of Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy Position Statement, conservative management
of iatrogenic gastric perforation by EGD is recommended
as a first-line treatment when the following criteria are satisfied: late recognition of perforation (> 12 h), asymptomatic
presentation, and no signs of peritoneal effusion or sepsis
[14]. Clipping under EGD or surgery may also be recommended in some cases of EGD-associated gastric perforation, depending on clinical symptoms or the size of the
perforation site [14]. The incidence of perforation is very
similar between TEE and EGD examinations [2, 7, 8, 14], as
such examinations have much in common, including the
size of the probe and the period of fasting. Therefore, as
with EGD-associated perforation, TEE-associated gastric
perforation may also be amenable to conservative management. In the present case, asymptomatic iatrogenic perforation was diagnosed at > 12 h following mitral valve repair.
Moreover, open abdominal surgery was considered too invasive and might have allowed a potential intraperitoneal
infection to spread to the implanted mechanical valve.
Thus, we decided to perform conservative management in

an effort to reduce the risk of severe complications. Had
the patient presented abdominal symptoms of peritonitis
(abdominal pain, Blumberg’s sign, muscular defense, fever,
tachycardia), an invasive procedure to repair the perforation
would have been required, per the current guidelines [14].
In conclusion, based on our experience with the patient described in this report, iatrogenic TEE-associated
gastric perforation, which is a very rare complication of
TEE, can be successfully managed conservatively even
when the perforation is recognized later than 12 h following the event, provided that there are no abdominal
symptoms and no signs of peritoneal effusion or sepsis.
