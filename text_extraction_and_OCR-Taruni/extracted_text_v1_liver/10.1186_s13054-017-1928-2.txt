Perioperative fluid management in kidney
transplantation: a black box
Maria Helena Calixto Fernandes1*, Thomas Schricker1, Sheldon Magder2 and Roupen Hatzakorzian1,2
Abstract
The incidence of delayed graft function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation remains significant. Optimal
fluid therapy has been shown to decrease delayed graft function after renal transplantation. Traditionally, the
perioperative volume infusion regimen in this patient population has been guided by central venous pressure as an
estimation of the patient’s volume status and mean arterial pressure, but this is based on sparse evidence from
mostly retrospective observational studies. Excessive volume infusion to the point of no further fluid responsiveness
can damage the endothelial glycocalyx and is no longer considered to be the best approach. However,
achievement of adequate flow to maintain sufficient tissue perfusion without maximization of cardiac filling remains
a challenge. Novel minimally invasive technologies seem to reliably assess volume responsiveness, heart function
and perfusion adequacy. Prospective comparative clinical studies are required to better understand the use of
dynamic analyses of flow parameters for adequate fluid management in kidney transplant recipients. We review
perioperative fluid assessment techniques and discuss conventional and novel monitoring strategies in the kidney
transplant recipient.

Background
Despite improvements in outcomes for patients undergoing renal transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) remains a significant complication and is a predictor of the
subsequent clinical course [1]. Delayed graft function is
associated with decreased graft and patient survival, impaired long-term function and increased acute rejection
[2, 3]. Optimized perioperative hemodynamic management is effective for prevention of DGF [4, 5], but optimal
fluid therapy remains a challenge.
The kidneys receive approximately 25% of the body’s
total cardiac output (CO) and are essential for maintaining tonicity of body fluids and for adjusting extracellular
volume. Patients with renal failure often have electrolyte
imbalances and tend to oscillate between hypovolemia
and hypervolemia [6]. This results in a very narrow margin of safety for intravenous fluid resuscitation and
maintenance. Patients undergoing kidney transplantation
are at risk of developing DGF, acute kidney injury (AKI)
and fluid overload. Hypovolemia can lead to further kidney injury, but excessive fluid therapy can result in pulmonary edema. Optimal fluid management is essential
to reduce perioperative complications.
Central venous pressure (CVP)-guided volume infusion is the traditional approach in renal transplantation
[7, 8] and involves intraoperative infusion of large volumes of fluid. Maximal volume infusion to the point of
no further fluid responsiveness has long been considered
the best approach [9–11], but this can lead to excess
fluid which can damage the endothelial glycocalyx and
lead to a fluid shift into the interstitial space [12]. Furthermore, in this range, CO cannot be modified when
needed by changes in cardiac filling pressure alone.
Previous studies on the assessment of intravascular
volume and optimization of CO and renal blood flow
have indicated that conventional monitoring provides insufficient data for adequate fluid management [13–16].
However, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials
indicate that approaches which include measurement of
CO and calculate oxygen delivery to guide intravenous

Main text
Delayed graft function
The definition of DGF is not consistent in the literature.
At least 18 different heterogeneous criteria were identified
in a systematic review [20]. Delayed graft function is most
commonly used to describe the failure of the transplanted
kidney to function promptly after transplantation, leading
to dialysis within 1 week after transplant [20, 21].
The reported incidence of DGF varies from 2 to 70%
in deceased kidney transplants [22, 23], not surprising
given the wide range of definition. Outcomes are best in
living donor transplantation, in which rates are 4–10%
[23]. Despite improvement in transplantation techniques, the incidence of DGF has not decreased. A possible explanation may be the increasing number of grafts
from expanded criteria donors and nonheart-beating donations [23, 24].
The underlying pathophysiology of DGF can be donor,
recipient or surgeon related and can be due to
hemodynamic (ischemic–reperfusion) or immunological
(particularly T-lymphocyte) processes. A key factor is occult imbalance between oxygen delivery and consumption in the graft [25].
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common
cause of DGF. Acute tubular necrosis can be already
present at the time of organ procurement if the deceased
donor’s kidney is injured. Prolonged warm and cold ischemia time, as well as the manner of preservation, also
can lead to ATN [23]. Acute tubular necrosis of the
transplanted kidney can be diagnosed initially by nuclear
renal scan which shows gradual uptake but minimal or
no excretion of the tracer [26]. The hemodynamic status
of the recipient during renal transplantation, the time
following kidney implantation and completion of the
anastomosis, and reperfusion injury all can effect graft
perfusion [27] and the development of DGF [4, 5, 28].
Furthermore, the transplanted kidney is denervated and
lacks neurogenic regulation of renal blood flow [29]. The
vasodilation caused by mediators that accumulate during
the ischemia period, and the increase in vascular permeability, might contribute to the invariable decline in
CVP, from the operating room to the postanesthesia care
unit [30]. Continuous monitoring is therefore highly recommended in postoperative care.
Several epidemiological studies in different patient
populations have confirmed an association between
stages of AKI and short-term and long-term outcomes
[31–33] as well as the independent association of AKI
with higher mortality risk [34]. This is likely also true in
kidney transplantation. Once the donated kidney has
reached the implantation unit, donor and graft characteristics are no longer modifiable, and hemodynamic
management becomes an adjustable portion of the
process (Fig. 1).
In summary, DGF is predominantly caused by ATN.
Adequate perfusion of the transplanted kidney is required, but to date no specific therapeutic intervention
has reduced the incidence of ATN and recovery [35].
The role of health care professionals involved in perioperative fluid management of kidney transplantation is
to identify the perfect balance of fluid therapy.
Perioperative intravascular fluid assessment
The assessment of a patient’s intravascular volume for
achievement of appropriate fluid management is a major
challenge for the clinician and has been shown to improve
postoperative outcomes [12]. Understanding of the following four definitions is essential in perioperative care:
1. Euvolemia: a state in which the vascular volume is
adequate for filling of the heart and maintenance of
an appropriate CO to generate the appropriate
oxygen supply for tissue needs.
2. Fluid responsiveness: a state in which an increase in
vascular volume increases the stroke volume (SV)
and CO. The notion of fluid responsiveness does not
necessarily mean that the patient will benefit from
or need fluid therapy. Parameters of perfusion
should guide the decision to assess the fluid
response rather than responsiveness in a
compromised patient.
3. Fluid overload: a state in which excessive
accumulation of fluid in the vascular system is
caused by excessive parenteral infusion or
deficiencies in cardiovascular or renal fluid volume
regulation.
4. Hypovolemia: a state in which effective circulatory
volume is decreased and there is insufficient oxygen
delivery to tissues, possibly resulting in organ
dysfunction.
Despite a clear definition, there is no gold standard for
the diagnosis and treatment of hypovolemia. Both acute
and chronic conditions interact with fluid homeostasis,
and medical history must always be considered. Progressive loss of renal function results in various adaptive and
compensatory changes to maintain homeostasis with
glomerular filtration rates below 10 ml/min, and these abnormalities typically have clinical consequences. A patient
with end-stage renal disease has a disturbed acid–base
and electrolyte balance and compromised hemodynamic
autoregulation. Inflammatory mediators can alter renal
Calixto Fernandes et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:14 Page 2 of 10

hemodynamics and cause glomerular, tubular and interstitial damage, if uncontrolled [36].
In addition to the uncertainty associated with the patient’s volume state, appropriate targets remain unclear.
To determine which monitoring method provides the
most accurate information in the context of kidney
transplantation, and which target to rely on, we will review previously implemented methods, their advantages
and disadvantages, and their relative utility in predicting
fluid responsiveness and tissue perfusion. Methods range
from conventional techniques such as clinical history
and physical examination, measurement of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), urine output (UOP), CVP
and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), to novel technologies such as echocardiography, cardiorespiratory interactions and dynamic analyses of flow parameters.
Conventional monitoring and targets
Clinical experience and use of traditional parameters
such as BP, HR, UOP, CVP [37] and PAP to guide perioperative fluid therapy in kidney transplantation have
been shown to be unreliable.
Hypovolemia in the perioperative setting often can be
misdiagnosed clinically [38] due to a lack of obvious
fluid loss in the context of altered systemic vascular resistance associated with capillary leak. An observational
study in healthy volunteers during progressive
hemorrhage showed that blood loss of 25% can appear
with minimal clinical impacts on BP and HR, despite
worsening microcirculatory flow [39]. Hypotension is
not present in all patients in shock. If the physician waits
for hypotension to start treating hypovolemia, tissue
hypoxia will already be present [40].
In the case of hypovolemia and hypoperfusion, physiological compensatory mechanisms can maintain effective
vascular volume and perfusion by increasing the vascular
retention of an infused volume and decreasing vascular
capacitance. Plasma levels of renin and aldosterone increase and atrial natriuretic factor decreases, followed by
arterioconstriction which decreases precapillary hydrostatic pressure and filtration [41, 42]. A 30–50% reduction in glomerular filtration, and an increase in fluid
reabsorption from the interstitial space, can also help
avoid tissue edema [42, 43]. These compensatory mechanisms are highly compromised in end-stage renal disease
and in the postischemic kidney.
Blood pressure is the most commonly used vital parameter for organ perfusion, and functions as an indirect
measurement of renal perfusion in clinical practice. Although classic physiological studies suggest that autoregulation of renal blood flow is maintained at lower levels
of mean arterial pressure (MAP 50–60 mmHg) [44, 45],
retrospective data suggest that intraoperative MAP < 55
mmHg is associated with AKI and myocardial injury

[46]. In a prospective randomized controlled trial in
which MAP targets of 65–70 mmHg were compared to
MAP targets of 80–85 mmHg in septic patients, there
were no significant differences in mortality [47]. Renal
replacement therapy was less commonly required in patients with chronic hypertension whose MAP was maintained at values of ≥ 80 mmHg [47]. However, raising
MAP by increasing the systemic vascular resistance does
not necessarily improve flow and potentially also not
renal perfusion.
Given the expected large oscillations in hemodynamic
parameters during kidney transplantation, invasive arterial BP monitoring is commonly used. In a recent study
of the biochemical outcomes of renal transplant recipients, no difference was observed in the creatinine levels
of patients with a MAP between 95 and 131 mmHg, but
MAP was continuously maintained at > 95 mmHg via
the judicious use of fluids and dopamine [27]. Consistent
with other studies, Campos et al. [4] observed that MAP
< 93 mmHg is associated with poor graft function. In an
earlier study, Tóth et al. [11] observed stable creatinine
levels in patients with a MAP of 80–100 mmHg, but an
increase in creatinine in patients with MAP < 80 mmHg.
However, these associations do not imply that raising
pressure would restore function. The optimal measurement to evaluate renal microcirculation is unclear, as
well as it being unknown which individual MAP could
prevent AKI during different medical conditions.
Earlier studies have indicated that the magnitude of
UO is one of the most clinically used predictors for graft
function immediately after reperfusion [48] and proposed the use of CVP and PAP values to predict diuresis
[8, 10]. Although aggressive volume expansion to a target CVP of 10–15 mmHg [49] and PAP > 20 mmHg [10]
at the time of reperfusion were associated with improved
renal blood flow and better graft outcomes, targeting
these values was not recommended by other authors. A
twofold greater risk of kidney dysfunction was observed
with CVP ≥ 11 mmHg [4]. Overinfusion can lead to tissue edema with decreased tissue oxygenation [50] and
subjects vulnerable patients to complications such as
pulmonary edema, infections, myocardial ischemia, ileus,
compromised renal flow, renal injury and even increased
mortality [4, 12, 51–53].
A decrease in CVP in the post-transplant period is observed in a majority of kidney recipients, independent of
their intravascular fluid status [30], but this does not
mean the patient needs fluid. The etiology is unclear, but
might be related to increased vascular permeability or
the release of vasodilator mediators during the ischemic
period. An increase in vascular capacitance also could be
a factor [54]. Overemphasis on CVP as a goal can lead
to excess infusion of fluid and increased capillary leakage, which can promote further fluid administration.
Use of pulmonary artery catheters has fallen out of
favor due to concerns about complications such as pulmonary embolism among high-risk patients [55], pulmonary artery rupture [56] and cardiac perforation [57],
and a frequent misinterpretation of the waveforms [58].
Static cardiac filling pressures such as CVP and PAP
correlate poorly with the intravascular volume and are
notoriously unreliable in predicting accurate fluid responsiveness compared to dynamic parameters [59, 60].
In a recent meta-analysis of the correlation between
CVP and changes in cardiac performance, Marik and
Cavallazzi [15] showed that only 57% of high-risk patients in the intensive care unit and operating room who
appeared to be hypovolemic based on CVP were fluid
responders, whereas the other half were unnecessarily
loaded with fluids. However, a high CVP could potentially compromise renal flow, particularly when the arterial pressure is low.
Thus, the CVP should not be used alone to guide fluid
responsiveness [15] and should not be a target for clinical decisions regarding fluid management [61]. Although the conventional parameters discussed
previously are relevant to the hemodynamic assessment,
none are good predictors of fluid responsiveness [59],
which has prompted a search for alternative methods.
There currently is increasing use of measurement of CO
and SV with the aid of less invasive and easier to use devices. Use of these novel technologies to guide therapy is
becoming vital in modern medical practice.
Physiological background for a novel approach to fluid
administration
The primary goal in the perioperative setting is to avoid
tissue hypoxia, the major cause of organ dysfunction.
Traditional indicators can be normal in the presence of
tissue hypoxia and cannot be used to predict an imbalance between oxygen demand and consumption, particularly if they are not interpreted in the context of
perfusion markers such as CO, lactates and central venous saturation [13–15, 61].
Sufficient oxygenation and tissue perfusion are crucial
for all metabolic needs of cells and are based on
hemoglobin concentration, arterial oxygen content and
CO. Therefore, the percent change in any one of these
three variables equally alters oxygen delivery, with CO
usually having the largest changes [62]. As CO is the
product of SV and HR, it can also be influenced by
changes in preload, contractility and afterload. A mismatch between tissue needs and oxygen delivery leads to
tachycardia and hypotension in most patients. Thus, an
increase in preload with fluid therapy is only one part of
treatment. An increase in contractility with inotropes remains the only therapeutic option when cardiac function
is volume limited [62].
Calixto Fernandes et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:14 Page 4 of 10

According to Frank–Starling’s law of the heart, administering fluids can increase the preload and thereby increase SV and CO. Under physiological conditions, both
ventricles work on the ascending portion of the Frank–
Starling curve, and afterload, contractility and HR are
assumed to remain constant during the volume infusion
[63]. This mechanism represents the functional preload
reserve for the heart under stress conditions. If the patient is a fluid responder, this mechanism translates to a
shift to the right of the venous return curve relative to
the cardiac function curve and intersects it on the steep
part of the cardiac function at a higher value [64]. A patient is considered a fluid responder when SV increases
by at least 10–15% in response to volume expansion
[65]. However, when the venous return intersects the flat
part of the cardiac function curve there is no increase in
CO and there even can be a decrease in ventricular performance and an increase in tissue edema and consequent tissue dysoxia. In nonresponders, CO only can
rise by an increase in contractility or HR. The change in
CVP in response to a fluid bolus can help interpret what
happened with the fluid bolus when used in combination
with the CO response.
Among the many devices and monitors currently available for measuring cardiac function and output, we will
review the intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and emphasize the utility of noninvasive devices that calculate reliable trends in CO and
dynamic indices based on simple physiology.
Transesophageal echocardiography
Transesophageal echocardiography can be a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating right and left heart function,
potential outflow tract obstruction and the presence of a
pericardial effusion. It also can be used to obtain Doppler measurements of CO. However, TEE is operator
dependent, and errors in the measurement of the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract skew results.
Presence of an irregular HR also affects the final calculation of CO.
Use of intraoperative TEE on renal allograft outcomes
has only been evaluated in one study, in which living
donor renal transplants were examined. Guiding fluid
therapy in 110 patients by corrected flow time obtained
with continuous transesophageal Doppler (TED) monitoring did not improve immediate graft function compared to fluid administration guided by CVP. However,
significantly less fluid was used in the TED-monitored
group, and the incidence of postoperative complications
related to fluid overload was reduced [66].
Transesophageal eechocardiography does not permit
continuous monitoring for instantaneous evaluation of
fluid responsiveness. Transesophageal echocardiography
is also time consuming and expensive, and requires
intensive operator training. Careful attention must be
given to the limitations of the assessment of CO by TEE,
which may be beyond the level of expertise of a physician with only moderate experience. New studies with
more robust data are required to support the use of TEE
for fluid management in this patient population.
Noninvasive dynamic CO technology
Cardiac output alone can be a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness, although its response to a preloadmodifying maneuver such as mechanical ventilation can
provide useful information about fluid responsiveness
without the administration of fluid [67].
Currently there are several noninvasive CO monitoring technologies including pulse contour analysis (PCA),
pulse wave transit time, thoracic electrical bioimpedance/bioreactance and CO2 rebreathing [68]. We will
focus on parameters derived from technology using PCA
to calculate CO. The SV is derived from the arterial
waveform signal using the area under the systolic part of
the arterial pressure curve. There are few devices using
PCA technology: FloTrac/Vigileo/EV1000 system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA), LiDCOrapid
(LiDCO, Cambridge, UK), MostCare (Vygon, Vytech,
Padua, Italy) and ProAQT/PulsioFlex (Pulsion/
MAQUET, Rastatt, Germany). Although the absolute
CO values may not be as accurate as those derived by
pulmonary artery catheter, these devices are very useful
in providing acceptable trending abilities to follow
changes in CO and SV. More studies are warranted to
determine the effectiveness of these devices in improving
patient outcomes [69].
Dynamic variation of arterial waveform-derived parameters (i.e., systolic pressure variation (SPV), pulse
pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation
(SVV)) in mechanically ventilated patients provides a
precise indication of fluid responsiveness, particularly
when compared to static indices [59]. However, SPV,
PPV and SVV only can predict variations in the stroke
volume index and cardiac index when the patient receives controlled ventilation and has no spontaneous respiratory efforts (Fig. 2). The percentages by which both
parameters are likely to increase can also be predicted.
The fundamentals underlying these parameters are
based on simple physiology and are well represented in
the Frank–Starling curve (Fig. 3). The cyclic positivepressure ventilation intermittently increases pleural
pressure and alters the filling conditions of the left and
right ventricles. The increase in pleural pressure decreases venous return and right ventricle (RV) preload.
Additionally, the RV afterload can increase due to an inspiratory rise in transpulmonary pressure. The decrease
in the RV preload and the increase in the RV afterload
decrease the RV SV, with minimum values reached endCalixto Fernandes et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:14 Page 5 of 10

inspiratory. The inspiratory reduction in the RV ejection
will in a few beats decrease left ventricle (LV) preload
and SV. The respiratory changes in the LV SV indicate a
biventricular preload dependence and only occur in the
ascending portion of the Frank–Starling curve [70].
Dynamic analyses of flow parameters need to be restricted to patients under controlled mechanical ventilation
with tidal volumes between 8 and 10 ml/kg ideal body
weight because heart–lung interactions are more complicated with spontaneous breathing efforts with or without a
ventilator [71]. When right ventricular insufficiency is
present, an experimental study of anesthetized pigs indicated that PPV and SVV only can be used to assess volume
responsiveness during a volume-loading maneuver [72].
The use of PPV may be preferable to SPV and SVV
because it is measured directly from the arterial pressure
tracing and uses more advanced digital software [59].
Despite limitations in the use of dynamic indices and the
inability to assess global ventricular function, SPV, PPV
and SVV are currently the most precise predictors of
fluid responsiveness [59], and their use does not require
any specific training or the physical presence of the clinician during measurements.
In a recent study from Japan, SVV was compared with
CVP and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure as estimates of the right and left ventricular preload in patients
undergoing renal transplantation. As expected, SVV better predicted volume responsiveness [60]. A retrospective study from 2014 questioned whether SVV can be an
alternative to CVP in kidney transplant recipients [73].

outcomes is presented in Table 1. Most trials have been
retrospective cohort studies. Errors due to bias and confounding variables are common and likely affect the results obtained using this study design. More robust
clinical trials are necessary to better understand fluid
management in kidney recipients.
Flow-directed fluid strategy: a more tailored approach
than goal-directed fluid therapy?
Accumulating evidence supports the concept that fluid
therapy should be individualized and based on dynamic
indices of the intravascular volume. Conventional monitoring does not provide sufficient information for this
approach, but novel technologies may allow titration of
therapeutic interventions to ensure that oxygen delivery
matches tissue need. One approach using dynamic indices has been goal-directed therapy (GDT). Goal-directed
therapy decreased postoperative complications, hospital
length of stay, mortality and hospital costs in high-risk
surgical patients [17–19]. However, Pearse et al. [74]
found no decrease in mortality after use of a CO-guided
hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual
care. Goal-directed therapy protocols are often associated with an increased infusion volume, and often include significantly more colloids than crystalloids [75]. A
factor that needs to be discussed in fluid management is
not only the total amount of fluid infused but how, when
and to which patient the volume is administered. There
are no studies of GDT in kidney transplantation.
In contrast to GDT, which is guided by “goals”, flowdirected therapy dictates fluid administration based on
“triggers” [62]. The triggers indicate that the clinical
state has fallen below an acceptable level and may benefit from increased volume with an increase in CO. It
does not aim for a higher than normal target, but rather
is based on the clinical impression that the flow is inadequate for tissue needs and asks whether a given volume
increased flow [62]. The change in CO is used as an indicator of the effectiveness of the therapy and not as the
primary objective [62]. Thus, when the patient reaches
the plateau of the Frank–Starling curve and the SV does
not show a change after a fluid bolus, volume expansion
is no longer the therapy of choice. Disregard for the status of fluid responsiveness before administering fluids
can lead to the unnecessary delivery of fluids, even in
GDT protocols. We advocate a flow-directed responsive
protocol to be used in the management of perioperative
fluid in kidney transplantation. Noninvasive CO monitoring is used to measure perfusion and assess fluid responsiveness when clinically indicated. After a volume is
given (500 ml of crystalloid) the response of CO is
checked. A 15% increase in CO with a CVP rise of at
least 2 mmHg constitutes a positive response. When
there is no appropriate response other therapies should
be chosen (i.e., vasopressor and/or inotropic therapy to
treat hypotension).
Conclusions
By optimizing perioperative hemodynamic management
in kidney transplantation, we hopefully can improve patient and kidney outcomes. The most recent studies of
fluid therapy in the perioperative setting provide more

questions than answers and challenge faith in traditional
concepts. Effective perioperative fluid administration in
kidney transplantation remains a black box, reinforced
by the fact that fluid requirements are highly variable
among patients and surgical procedures and the assessment of an individual patient’s intravascular volume remains challenging. It is unlikely that there will be a
standardized all-inclusive algorithm, and a more highly

individualized evidence-based approach adapted to each
patient’s physiological needs and responses to volume
and pharmacological therapy might be more helpful.
Prospective comparative clinical studies are warranted
to better understand the use of dynamic analyses of flow
parameters for optimal fluid management in specific patient populations such as kidney transplant patients,
who often have impaired cardiovascular physiology and
reduced hemodynamic autoregulation due to end-stage
kidney disease.
