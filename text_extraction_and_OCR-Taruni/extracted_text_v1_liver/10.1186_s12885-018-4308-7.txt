Abstract
Background: Sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) might both provide survival benefit for
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Adopting either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource
implications. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib and TACE in advanced HCC.
Methods: A Markov model was constructed in a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 60 years with advanced HCC
and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis over a 2-year time frame. Three strategies (full or dose-adjusted sorafenib and TACE)
were compared in two cost settings: China and the USA. Transition probabilities, utility and costs were extracted
from systematic review of 27 articles. Sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis were conducted.
Results: Full and dose-adjusted sorafenib respectively produced 0.435 and 0.482 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
while TACE produced 0.375 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of full-dose sorafenib versus TACE
was $101,028.83/QALY in China whereas full-dose sorafenib is a dominant strategy (ICER of -$1,014,507.20/ QALY)
compared with TACE in the USA. Compared to full-dose sorafenib, dose-adjusted sorafenib was the dominant
strategy with the negative ICERs in both China (−$132,238.94/QALY) and the USA (−$230,058.09/QALY). However,
dose-adjusted sorafenib is not available currently, so full-dose sorafenib should be compared with TACE. As the
acceptability curves shown, full-dose sorafenib was the optimal strategy at the accepted thresholds of WTP in these
two countries. Specifically, full-dose sorafenib was the cost-effective treatment compared with TACE if a WTP was
set above $21,670 in the USA, whereas in China, TACE could be more favorable than full-dose sorafenib if a WTP
was set below $10,473.
Conclusions: Dose-adjusted sorafenib may be cost-effective compared to full-dose sorafenib or TACE for advanced
HCC patients. However, when confining the comparisons between full-dose sorafenib and TACE, full-dose sorafenib
was cost-effective for these patients, under the accepted thresholds of WTP.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cancer-related
cause of death, and carries a substantial healthcare
spending burden worldwide [1]. Despite recent improvements in surveillance programs, a considerable proportion of patients have vascular invasion or extrahepatic
metastasis (advanced stage) at time of diagnosis [2, 3].
Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, is the standard
systemic therapy in the treatment of advanced HCC,
based on two multicenter randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), which demonstrate improved overall survival of
full-dose sorafenib compared with best supportive care
(BSC) [4, 5]. In routine clinical practice, sorafenib is recommended to be administered as 800 mg daily, based
on the RCT data. However, a substantial portion of patients receiving sorafenib require dose adjustment due to
the relatively high rate of adverse effects during the
treatment period in the real clinical setting. Moreover,
the high cost of full-dose sorafenib is a heavy financial
burden for patients with advanced HCC. Recent studies
have suggested that a dose-adjusted sorafenib regimen
might achieve a better efficacy-safety balance [6–8].
Nevertheless, dose-adjusted sorafenib has not been recommended by the current guidelines due to lack of
enough robust data.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for patients with intermediate-stage HCC
[9]. However, intrahepatic tumor control with TACE
might be reasonable and beneficial for advanced HCC
considering the fact that more than two-thirds of patients with advanced HCC die of liver failure or intrahepatic tumor progression [10–12]. Some studies have
already reported the potential benefits of TACE for patients in this stage [12–21], even after sorafenib was universally established as the first-line treatment. Although
several comparative studies tried to compare efficacy between TACE and sorafenib in advanced HCC [14, 15,
22, 23], results were controversial and no RCT has been
performed to address this question. It remains unknown
how TACE compares with sorafenib for treatment of advanced HCC. Particularly, dose-adjusted regimen is not
available when sorafenib is first administered, so fulldose sorafenib will be compared with TACE. Moreover,
there may be a significant difference in costs among
these three treatments, which may significantly impact
the treatment selection due to practical considerations.
Until now, no cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis has been
performed on this issue. The Markov model would be a
proper solution for this issue. By dividing a disease into
distinct states and assigning transitions probabilities for
movement between those states, then attaching estimates of costs and health outcomes to the states and
running the model over many cycles, the model is able
to estimate the long-term costs and outcomes associated
with that disease and the related healthcare interventions [24]. The advantage of Markov model by taking
into accounts both costs and outcomes over a period of
time makes it particularly suited to evaluate the costeffectiveness of strategies in the treatment of chronic
disease. For example, Markov model is widely adopted
in the evaluation of disease screening or treatments
around the world [25–27]. Therefore, we aimed to construct a Markov model to evaluate and compare the CE
of full-dose, dose-adjusted regimens of sorafenib and
TACE for advanced HCC, in order to provide useful information for patients and healthcare providers in the
current era of limited health resources.
Methods
Model construction
A Markov model (Fig. 1) was designed to estimate the effects and costs of TACE and sorafenib in a hypothetical
cohort of adult patients with advanced HCC (Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C, patients with ChildPugh class A/B liver function with vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread or symptoms (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 1–2)) over a 2-year
time frame. The outcome measures were life year gain
(LYG), quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The model consisted of three decision strategies including full-dose
sorafenib, dose-adjusted sorafenib and TACE. Since liver
function and tumor burden are the two main factors associated with survival and costs [28, 29], four health states
were derived such as compensated cirrhosis (defined as
Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis) with or without progression,
decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C cirrhosis) and
death. Tumor progression was defined according to the
modified Response Evaluation Criteria of Solid Tumor
(mRECIST) [30]. Tumor progression was not considered
in the state of decompensated cirrhosis because decompensation was the major life-threatening factor, and the
utility and total costs of patients in this state with or without progressive HCC would not be much different [31].
The treatment response was evaluated by mRECIST in
compensated cirrhotic patients after administering sorafenib or TACE for HCC. Patients with progressive HCC or
decompensated cirrhosis were assumed to receive no further active treatments. Considering the poor prognosis of
advanced HCC, the cycle time was set to be one month. A
2-year follow-up duration was assumed because the median survivals of advanced HCC patients were generally
less than 10 months. In each cycle, patients in one health
state might be transitioned to another, or could occupy
the same state, according to transition probabilities. Each
health state had its corresponding costs and utilities.
Monthly transition probabilities were estimated from the

original data using the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy (DEALE) equation [32]. The TreeAge–Pro–2011 software (TreeAge Software Inc.,
Williamstown, MA, USA) was applied to create a Markov
model.
Literature review
Transition probabilities, utilities and costs (Tables 1, 2 and
3) were derived from published articles identified through
PubMed and Cochrane Library database with the latest
search performed on July 15, 2016. The medical subject
heading (MESH) or their free text variants such as “Carcinoma, Hepatocellular”, “BCLC C” or “advanced HCC”, “sorafenib”, “Transarterial chemoembolization” or “TACE”,
and “costs and cost analysis” were applied. Reference lists
of the included studies were hand-searched to identify further relevant articles. More details of literature review were
in Additional file 1. The details of references used to extract
various probabilities were reported in Additional file 2:

Parameter estimation
Double arcsine transformations were performed on the
extracted transition probabilities before pooling them for
variances stabilisation because the inverse variance weight
in the pooling is suboptimal when low prevalence rates
are involved and the transformed probabilities are
weighted very slightly towards 50%, making it feasible to
include studies with prevalence rates of zero [33]. The
Wilson score method was also used to calculate the 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) of these probabilities because of
the values below zero produced by the asymptotic method
[34]. After obtaining the above estimates, STATA software
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used to pool
the data using the random-effect model. SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to apply the Wilson
score method and calculate the 95% CIs.

Summary of transition probabilities
Common transition probabilities
The common probability for these three therapies was the
mortality of the general population [35] and of decompensated cirrhotic patients. Advanced HCC patients with decompensated cirrhosis were regarded as candidates with
terminal stage HCC without chances to receive further effective interventions, so the natural mortality of terminalstage patients was adopted [36, 37].
Transition probabilities in TACE arm
Studies on the risk of transitioning from compensated to
decompensated state for cirrhotic patients with advanced
HCC were unavailable. The monthly decompensated rate
for compensated cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC
but without tumor progression after TACE was 2.40%,
extracting from the large HCC database of South China
(http://hcc.medidata.cn/). This is a constantly updated
database comprising primary and recurrent HCC patients
treated in a tertiary medical center. There are 1694 patients with follow-up data by May 2017. Some of the data
in our study are extracted from the cohort of primary
advanced-stage HCC patients treated with sorafenib or
TACE in this database. The monthly mortality of patients
without progression after TACE was estimated as 11.5%
after pooling the data from nine included studies[16–19,
38–40]. The progression rate after TACE was transformed
from the time to progression (TTP) of 3.2 months reported by Zhou et al. [41, 42]. There was no study specifically reporting the mortality rate of progressive disease
after TACE, so we assumed that the mortality was comparable to the median of natural mortality of advanced
and terminal stage HCC since there was no further treatment for post-progression patients in this model [36, 37,
43].
Transition probabilities in full-dose/adjusted-dose Sorafenib
arm
Studies on the risk of transitioning from compensated to
decompensated state for cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC were unavailable. The monthly decompensated rate for compensated cirrhotic patients with
advanced HCC but without tumor progression after sorafenib treatment was 0.90%, extracting from the large
HCC database of South China (http://hcc.medidata.cn/).
For the full-dose sorafenib cohort without progression,
the median survival of 9.7 months and the TTP of 4.
9 months were extracted from a sub-analysis of the
SHARP trial [42]. Other studies have applied the supplemental survival and progression data for analysis [4, 39,
44–46]. For the monthly mortality of patients without
progression after taking adjusted-dose sorafenib, 6.5%
was resulted after pooling all the data from included
studies, [6–8]. The TTP of 9.2 months was derived from
the SOFIA study in Italy and its 95% confidence interval
(CI) was used to perform a sensitivity analysis [8]. Median post-progression survival was consistently reported
as 4.6 months in two studies [46, 47]. We assumed that
the survival of patients after sorafenib failure in both
arms shared the same scenario.
Costs and utilities
This study was conducted from the perspective of a
healthcare system; therefore, only direct medical costs
were included. Since China and the USA present with different medical charging systems with different costs for
procedures, administering the treatment (that includes
doctor visits) and follow-up monitoring, we performed
two cost scenarios: in China and the USA. Monthly costs
were estimated with the frequency and unit cost of drugs
and procedures (that include treatments for HCC, cirrhosis and adverse events derived from associated drugs and
procedures), inpatient and outpatient visits, laboratory
testing and imaging examination, and all were converted
to U.S. dollars in 2016. The costs in China were extracted
from a previously published Chinese study [48], supplemented by the data in the large HCC database of South
China (http://hcc.medidata.cn/). The median cost of one
session of TACE was $3347.97. The market price for a
package of sorafenib is $3792.66 in China. We also considered the cost reduction due to the sorafenib assistance
program for patients without progression until 3 months
in China during the analysis. In this program, patients
need to pay the drug cost for the initial 3 months, and
then are free of charge until the end of treatment. The
cost estimates in the USA were obtained from costrelative studies specific for the USA. The median cost of
one session of TACE was $25,961 [49] and the market
price for a tablet of sorafenib is $38.27 [50]. Other costs
were also available in the literatures [49, 51]. The base
case estimates and sensitivity ranges of utilities were extracted from the literatures [52, 53]. A discount rate was
set at 3% yearly for both costs and utilities to inflate costs
to 2016 dollars.

Cost-effectiveness analysis
With the above parameters input into the model, effectiveness measures of LYG and QALY and CE measure of
ICER were estimated. The ICER was calculated using the
difference in costs divided by the corresponding difference
in QALY. The relative cost-effectiveness among the three
strategies were compared with one another in order of increasing effectiveness [54]. Subsequently, one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of each
parameter preset in our model. To reduce the ambiguity
of the mathematical uncertainty of ICER, a new assessment criterion, net monetary benefits (NMB), was used.
The formula of NMB combines cost, effectiveness and
willingness to pay (WTP). The strategy with the higher
NMB is more cost-effective given the fixed WTP value.
Results were presented in the form of a tornado diagram
and the corresponding cutoffs were determined. For probabilities and utilities, we changed the value of each parameter over the range extracted from the included studies.
For costs, considering the lack of reported range data, a
wide range of 50%–200% on the base case value was applied as Lim et al. [49] described. Furthermore, Monte
Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to
estimate the total impact of parameter uncertainties on
the model results with 10,000 simulations. Findings were
presented on a CE acceptability curve and a CE plane. A
gamma distribution was employed for cost estimates and
a beta distribution for efficacy estimates.
An external CE threshold, that is, the largest sum of
money you are willing to pay for gaining one QALY was

were analyzed. The length of colored bar for each factor represents the extent of its effect on NMB. A wider bar of the corresponding variable indicates the larger potential effect on NMB

utilized to compare with ICER to decide whether one
strategy is cost-effective. For the USA, the commonly
cited threshold of $50,000/QALY was used [49, 55, 56].
For China, we adopted the threshold of $24,840.27
which is the 3 times per capita GDP of China according
to the WHO guidelines for CE analysis [48, 57].
Results
Base case analysis
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results of base case analyses. For LYG, the dose-adjusted -sorafenib strategy provided an average of 7.898 months while TACE and fulldose sorafenib strategies offered 6.357 months and 7.
236 months, respectively. Regarding QALY, full-dose sorafenib and dose-adjusted sorafenib treatments produced
relatively better results (0.435, 0.482) than TACE (0.375).
In China, full-dose sorafenib brings 0.060 of a QALY per
person at a cost of $ 6061.73 per person when compared
to TACE, which yields an ICER of $101,028.83 per QALY
whereas in the USA, full-dose sorafenib is a dominant
strategy (ICER of -$1,014,507.20/ QALY) compared with
TACE. Compared to full-dose sorafenib, dose-adjusted sorafenib was the dominant strategy with the negative ICERs
in both China (−$132,238.94/QALY) and the USA
(−$230,058.09/QALY).
One-way sensitivity analysis
Fig. 2 demonstrates the tornado diagrams of all the parameters for China and the USA. The mortalities of
compensated cirrhotic patients without and with progression taking dose-adjusted sorafenib lay in the top
three sensitive parameters in both countries, reflecting
that the treatment efficacy was a vital factor when considering the sorafenib strategy. For both China and the
USA, the NMB of dose-adjusted sorafenib treatment
was always larger than those of full-dose sorafenib and
TACE regardless of the monthly mortality of compensated cirrhotic patients with progression taking doseadjusted sorafenib (Additional file 11: Figure 1A, B), suggesting dose-adjusted sorafenib was the dominant strategy over the range we tested. Besides, the cost of
sorafenib was the third sensitive parameter in China. If
the expenditure of full-dose sorafenib treatment increased and reached the cut-off value of $13,973.90,
TACE could become more competitive (Additional file 12:
Figure 2A). In the USA, TACE was apparently not a
good treatment under the given scenarios reagardless of
the cost of full-dose sorafenib treatment (Additional file 12: Figure 2B).
Two-way sensitivity analysis
The top three sensitive parameters were further included
in the two-way sensitivity analysis. In the USA scenario,
the analysis demonstrated that dose-adjusted sorafenib

was always the cost-effective treatment no matter how the
post-progression survivals of sorafenib treated HCC patients changed (Fig. 3a). In China, most scenarios suggested that dose-adjusted sorafenib mode was more costeffective. However, when assuming the lowest mortality to
patients with progression taking full-dose sorafenib,
adjusted-dose regimen remained cost-effective until the
monthly mortality reached 18.6% (Fig. 3b). For TACE and
full-dose sorafenib therapies, if the drug cost of full-dose
sorafenib was kept at $15,200.8, the monthly mortality of
advanced HCC patients without progression would need
to be kept below 12.3% for TACE to be cost-effective in
China (Fig. 3c).
Monte Carlo analysis
The median ICERs of full-dose sorafenib and TACE
compared to dose-adjusted sorafenib were − 6623.21(−
25,354.58,12,108.17)and − 377.23(− 477.03,-277.42)in
China and 583,742.25 (− 535,297.82,1702,782.31) and −
65,695.39 (− 70,138.02,− 61,252.76) in the USA, respectively. For both China and the USA, the acceptability
curve showed that dose-adjusted sorafenib always had a
higher probability of being more cost-effective than the
other two therapies regardless of WTP (Fig. 4a, b).
Moreover, in the USA, TACE could be as cost-effective
as full-dose sorafenib if the WTP was below $21,670
while full-dose sorafenib was always cost-effective compared with TACE if the WTP was set above $21,670.
Nevertheless, in China, TACE could be more favorable
than full-dose sorafenib if a WTP was set below $10,473
(Fig. 4a). Despite the above disparities, the common
finding in these two countries was that dose-adjusted sorafenib was the cost-effective strategy at the preset WTP
values in China and USA, and when confining the comparisons between full-dose sorafenib and TACE, fulldose sorafenib was cost-effective for these patients.
Discussion
Our study shows that dose-adjusted sorafenib is costeffective compared to full-dose sorafenib or TACE for
advanced HCC in both China and the USA based on the
base case analysis, sensitivity analysis and WTP analysis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
compare the CE of sorafenib with TACE. Previous CE

studies have confined the comparison of sorafenib to
BSC [48, 50, 55, 58]. However, since BSC is simply a
form of palliative treatment without offering improvement in health outcomes, comparing an active treatment
like TACE to sorafenib is a better strategy when investigating the current most appropriate therapy for advanced HCC. Moreover, it is also the first study to
compare sorafenib in different doses (full-dose and doseadjusted) with TACE in the treatment of advanced HCC.
Regarding the CE of full-dose sorafenib itself, a QALY
of 0.435 gained at a cost of $16,703 in China in our
study was similar to that in the previous Chinese study
(QALY, 0.45; cost, $19,149) [48], but was not consistent
with that in the Italian study (QALY, 0.16; cost, $14,841;)
[55]. The poorer efficacy of full-dose sorafenib for Italian
patients represented by the much shorter QALY could
explain the inconsistency. Meanwhile, for the doseadjusted sorafenib group, its CE in China in our study
were better than that in the Italian study [55], which
might be explained by the higher expenditures (Italy:
$16,625 vs. China: 10,488) but lower QALY in Italy
(Italy: 0.440 vs. China: 0.482).
In terms of the relative CE between therapies, the Italian study and the Chinese study both suggested that
full-dose sorafenib was not a cost-effective treatment
compared to BSC [48, 55]. However, the Italian study
considered sorafenib as cost-effective under the doseadjusted condition. Similarly in our study, dose-adjusted
sorafenib was cost-effective whereas full-dose sorafenib
and TACE were not. It might be due to the similar or
higher survival benefit provided by dose-adjusted sorafenib at a lower cost. Sorafenib therapy within its licensed
dose is effective but costly, thus, it is of great importance
to find a way to improve its CE. Half-dose sorafenib with
the comparable or even better efficacy and substantial
expenditure reduction is clearly a good option. However,
the issue of optimal sorafenib dose remained to be further investigated in the future studies.
Concerning the role of TACE in advanced HCC, our
study revealed that TACE produced slightly shorter life
expectancy and QALY to sorafenib. Although TACE
could eradicate viable tumors to some extent, the promotion of proliferation and metastasis of remaining
tumors by over-expressed angiogenic and inflammatory
factors after TACE restricted the prolongation of the
overall survival. Moreover, when taking the cost into
consideration, TACE was not the cost-effective treatment under the current WTP set in the USA as shown
in the acceptability curve because one session of this
procedure ($25,961) costs more than 5.5 times of the
monthly cost of full-dose sorafenib ($4592). Interestingly, in China, TACE was cost-effective compared to
full-dose sorafenib if the WTP was set below $10,473.
The underlying reason behind the difference between
China and the USA might be the different medical charging system between these two countries representing by
the relative cost of TACE and sorafenib. Unlike the high
expense of TACE in the USA [49], the price of TACE including the costs of procedure, hospitalization, specialist
visits and various examinations during hospital stay
($3170) in China is even lower than the monthly cost of
dose-adjusted sorafenib ($4060). However, under the accepted threshold of WTP in both countries, full-dose
usage of sorafenib is still the cost-effective strategy compared with TACE for most patients. Only for some poor
patients with the willingness to pay less $10,473 in
China, TACE could be the cost-effective treatment.
Data constraints inevitably lead to several limitations
within our model. First, there were limited studies that
specifically reported TACE and sorafenib outcomes for
compensated cirrhotic patients with or without progression. Such a limitation was unfortunately unavoidable in
our type of analysis. This limitation obliged us to use the
best available data in the literature review. The resulting
uncertainties were not significant, which was confirmed
by the unchanged results in the probabilistic sensitivity
analysis. Second, the utility estimates for compensated
cirrhosis with or without progression were extracted
from NICE for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma with sorafenib or BSC as the two previous relevant
articles did. This adoption may not be the most rational
because utilities might vary between populations with
two different diseases. The third limitation concerns the
paucity of data on cost estimates for each health state in
different countries. It is well known that costs may vary
with different regions and treatment plans. Thus, it

restricted us to make comparisons among more countries. Despite these, we have performed the analyses on
two different cost scenarios including the USA and
China, representing the Western and Eastern countries
to some extent, and have detected some differences between these two countries. Moreover, we have considered the uncertainties of costs in sensitivity analyses by
inputting a wide range of cost values (50%–200% of
base-case value). In a sense, our model could be applied
in those countries with efficacy and cost data falling
within the ranges we have set. Fourth, we assumed that
the effectiveness estimations such as LYG and QALY
were the same between China and the USA, however,
there might be differences in these efficacy results between these two countries. Thus, more specific data for
individual countries are required to obtain more accurate results for different countries respectively. Fifth, most
of the included studies were retrospective and the analyses based on these retrospective data would inevitably
result in selection bias. Sixth, the lack of information on
vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread and/or symtoms
in TACE versus sorafenib patients was present in our
study, which required more detailed characteristics of
patients to compare these two treatments in future
studies.
Conclusions
In conclusion, dose-adjusted sorafenib may be costeffective compared to full-dose sorafenib or TACE for
advanced HCC patients. However, dose-adjusted sorafenib is not available currently, so full-dose sorafenib
should be compared with TACE. When confining the
comparisons between them, full-dose sorafenib was
cost-effective compared with TACE for advanced HCC
patients, under the accepted thresholds of WTP. Our
findings will require further high–quality studies to
validate.
