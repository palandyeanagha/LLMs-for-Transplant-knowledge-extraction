Abstract
A 59-year-old man developed acute hepatitis with reactivated hepatitis B virus (HBV) following administration of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody). The patient was diagnosed with malignant lymphoma
in 1998, and virus marker testing indicated HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative and anti-HBs antibody
(anti-HBs)-positive results when chemotherapy including rituximab was started. Levels of aminotransferases
were elevated, and HBsAg results turned positive. Despite therapy for late-onset hepatic failure, the patient
died. Rituximab appears likely to have induced HBV reactivation in this case. Anti-viral agents should be administered for both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive patients who are scheduled to receive rituximab.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prevalent viral
causes of hepatitis. Approximately 350 million people
worldwide are living with chronic HBV infection (1). The
majority of these cases are associated with alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels within normal ranges, antiHBV envelope (HBe) antibody-positive status and low viral
load (inactive HBV carrier or asymptomatic HBV carrier
with anti-HBe-positive status). Reactivation of HBV in such
HBV carriers is infrequent, but frequently occurs during immunosuppressive therapy. HBV reactivation occurs in 14%
of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients and in
70% of HBsAg-positive patients (2).
Reactivation of HBV in anti-HBs antibody (anti-HBs)-
positive patients is extremely rare and has been described in
very few reports (3-6). Herein we report a case of HBV reactivation induced by chemotherapy including rituximab in a
patient who had been anti-HBs-positive. Administration of
anti-viral agents appears warranted in patients undergoing
treatment with rituximab.
Case Report
A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with
icteric symptoms. Malignant lymphoma was diagnosed in
1998 and was treated using chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, lymph nodes were reduced in size and remission was
considered to have been achieved. The patient was defined
as HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-positive (×16 passive hemagglutination method), with anti-HBc antibody (anti-HBc)
99.8% in undiluted serum (not examined in ×200 diluted serum) in April 2000. Malignant lymphoma recurred in 2001
and aminotransferase levels were normal during chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 6300 mg, vincristine 8 mg and mitoxantrone hydrochloride 60 mg intravenously, prednisolone
300 mg orally). In 2003, chemotherapy (irinotekan 740 mg,
dexamethasone sodium phosphate 140 mg and vincristine 8
mg intravenously) was administered with no reduction
lymph node swelling. In January 2004, chemotherapy was
re-administered (dexamethasone sodium phosphate 100 mg
and vincristine 10 mg intravenously, prednisolone 20 mg/
day orally), then in April 2004 the regimen was changed

(etoposide 2400 mg intravenously, prednisolone 10 mg/day Table1. LaboratoryDataonAdmission
orally). In July 2004, the patient was treated with chemotherapy including rituximab, to prevent recurrence of malignant lymphoma (rituximab 3600 mg, etoposid 1400 mg and
dexamethasone sodium phosphate 70 mg intravenously,
prednisolone 15 mg/day orally). As of 2 months later, in
September 2004, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were elevated,
and the patient was transferred to our hospital in November
2004 (Fig. 1). He was icteric on admission, and laboratory
data revealed: HBsAg-positive; anti-HBs-negative; HBVDNA, 6.9 log copies/ml; anti-HBe-negative; HBe antigennegative; HBV genotype C; core promoter mutationpositive; precore mutation-positive; total bilirubin, 26.4 mg/
dl; ALT, 359 IU/l; prothrombin time, 35.8%; antinuclear antibody (ANA)-negative; CD19+ cell, 0%; and CD 20+
cell,
0% (Table 1). Lamivudine (100 mg/day) was administered
from October 8 and steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 5250 mg over 10 days) was started after admission.
Levels of AST, ALT and HBV-DNA improved during therapy, but prothrombin time and total bilirubin levels did not
improve. Hepatic encephalopathy appeared from November
26, so late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF) caused by HBV reactivation was diagnosed. Plasma exchange therapy with
fresh frozen plasma and continuous hemodiafiltration
(CHDF) were initiated to improve encephalopathy, but the
patient died in January 2005 from liver failure. HBV-DNA
levels were high during therapy. Autopsy revealed atrophic
changes in the liver, which weighed 909 g. Histological examination identified multilobular necrosis (Fig. 2).
Discussion
The present report describes a case of HBV reactivation
after immunosuppressive treatment including rituximab.
HBV causes persistent infection in the human body, so reactivation can occur under immunosuppressive conditions.
However, patients infected with HBV and displaying antiHBs-positivity have been considered to display few copies
of HBV, and HBV rarely reactivates under such circum722

stances. Some reports have discussed reactivation of HBV
despite the presence of anti-HBs after solid-organ transplantation, bone marrow transplantation or during the clinical
course of AIDS (7-9). Anti-cancer drugs like cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone can reactivate HBV in
patients with leukemia, even under HBsAg-negative status
(10). In addition to such drugs, immunosuppressive drugs
used for organ transplantation and HIV or other immunosuppressive viruses can also reactivate HBV proliferation.
Rituximab induces suppression of B cells, and has thus been
used to treat malignant B-cell lymphoma. The characteristics
of rituximab suggest that this agent could readily induce reactivation of persistent viral infections. Acute hepatitis occurring in an anti-HBs-positive patient receiving rituximab
treatment was first reported in 2001 (3). A case in which the
use of fludarabine likely contributed to HBV reactivation
has also been reported (11). However, whether rituximab
alone or the combination of rituximab with other anti-cancer
drugs like VP-16 induced reactivation in the present case is
unclear. The possibility of sexual transmission could be excluded. B-lymphocytopenia by rituximab appears to inhibit
the production of virus-specific antibody, facilitating HBV
reactivation (5). In the present case, the population of CD20+
cells remained at 0%, and serum immunoglobulin levels
were low during the stay in our hospital. Before admission
to our hospital, IgG level was 1047 mg/dl in November
2001, 1068 mg/dl in July 2003, and 479 mg/dl in November
2004 (normal range: 870-1700 mg/dl). Zinc sulfate turbidity
test (ZTT) yielded results of 8.2 U in August 1998, 5.4 U in
September 2001, 4.6 U in July 2004, 5.1 U in September
2003 and 1.6 U in August 2004 (normal range: 4-10 U).
These data indicate impairments in the number and function
of B cells at the time of HBV reactivation. Clinical course
indicated that aminotransferase levels became elevated after
rituximab administration, but no other chemotherapies had
previously induced adverse effects. These findings support
the contention that HBV reactivation was caused by rituximab. The possibility that the patient was in a carrier state of
mutant HBV in the S region (escape mutant) could not be
excluded. Anti-HBs was positive in this case, meaning that
the possibility of an escape mutant was quite low, since
anti-HBs can neutralize HBsAg from the S region of escape
mutant HBV.
HBV is widely believed to be completely cleared during
acute viral hepatitis. However, HBV can persists for dacades
after recovery from acute viral hepatitis (12). Another report
has mentioned that HBV exists in the liver of healthy
HBcAb-positive, but HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-negative individuals, and HBV can reactivate after liver transplantation
by immunosuppressive treatment (13). The present case patient was anti-HBs-positive, yet HBV was reactivated. In
this case, anti-HBs turned negative during therapy with rituximab, then HBV was reactivated. When immunosuppressive drugs like rituximab are used even for anti-HBs-positive
patients, care should be taken regarding the possibility of
HBV reactivation, and the levels of anti-HBs must be monitored during therapy (14).
Rituximab has recently been expected to prove useful not
only in treating malignant lymphoma, but also in collagen
diseases (15, 16). HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive
status is usually considered to indicate that the patient has
been infected with HBV previously, but is not currently a
carrier of HBV. In such cases, rituximab is readily used, and
the number of therapies using rituximab appears likely to in723

crease in the future. Using HB immunoglobulin while monitoring anti-HBs titer should provide good treatment. However, HB immunoglobulin is expensive and not particularly
easy to use. Novel anti-viral drugs such as lamivudine and
adefovir are now available for HBV treatment. In patients
undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, use of these kinds
of anti-viral drug should be considered before treatment
(17). As indicated by the present case, care is required when
dealing with patients with HBV, even if anti-HBs-positive
status is identified. In Japan, around 20% of HBV patients
display anti-HBs-positive results. As HBV is readily reactivated in anti-HBs-positive patients under immunosuppressed
conditions, this finding is extremely important, since > 50%
of all Japanese are anti-HBc-positive carriers (18).
In addition, lymphoma, male gender, young age (<44-
years-old) and HBe antigen seropositivity have been identified as risk factors for HBV reactivation in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy (19). However, anti-viral treatment should be considered even in patients with reduced
risk of HBV reactivation. Evaluation of anti-viral pretreatment with rituximab requires numerous cases and analysis
of the pharmacokinetics between HBV and rituximab.
The present case suggests that prophylactic administration
of anti-viral agents should be considered for patients who
are scheduled to receive rituximab, not only in HBsAgpositive patients, but also in anti-HBs-positive patients.
