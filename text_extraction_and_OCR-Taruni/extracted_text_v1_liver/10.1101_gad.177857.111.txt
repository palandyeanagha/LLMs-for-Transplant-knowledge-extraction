Certain white adipose tissue (WAT) depots are readily able to convert to a ‘‘brown-like’’ state with prolonged cold
exposure or exposure to b-adrenergic compounds. This process is characterized by the appearance of pockets of
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive, multilocular adipocytes and serves to increase the thermogenic capacity of
the organism. We show here that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays a physiologic role in this thermogenic
recruitment of WATs. In fact, mice deficient in FGF21 display an impaired ability to adapt to chronic cold
exposure, with diminished browning of WAT. Adipose-derived FGF21 acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to
increase expression of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes in fat tissues. FGF21 regulates this process, at least in
part, by enhancing adipose tissue PGC-1a protein levels independently of mRNA expression. We conclude that
FGF21 acts to activate and expand the thermogenic machinery in vivo to provide a robust defense against
hypothermia.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized tissue that
dissipates chemical energy to protect against hypothermia and obesity through a process termed nonshivering
thermogenesis. Active BAT burns lipids to produce heat,
resulting in an increase in energy expenditure. Many
studies have shown that changes in BAT activity can profoundly affect body weight and glucose homeostasis
(Lowell et al. 1993; Kopecky et al. 1995; Cederberg et al.
2001; Feldmann et al. 2009). Cold exposure activates the
sympathetic nervous system, resulting in the stimulation
of b-adrenergic receptors on brown adipocytes. This process induces mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1),
which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ATP
production, releasing chemical energy as heat. The expression of UCP1 is driven by several transcriptional components, including the coactivator PGC-1a, which is strongly
induced by cold exposure and/or b-adrenergic signaling
(Barbera et al. 2001). Additionally, PGC-1a regulates
oxidative metabolism by coordinately increasing mitochondrial gene expression and function (Wu et al. 1999).
PGC-1a and UCP1 are highly expressed in BAT, which contains multilocular adipocytes enriched with mitochondria.
It is now clear that there are two distinct types of brown
adipose cells. One is the classical brown fat that arises
from a myf5, muscle-like cell lineage (Seale et al. 2008;
Lepper and Fan 2010). This is exemplified by the interscapular BAT depots and the perirenal BAT depot, a depot
that contains a mixture of classical brown and white
adipocytes (Seale et al. 2008; Cinti 2009). In addition,
UCP1-positive, brown fat-like cells can emerge in most
white fat (white adipose tissue [WAT]) depots upon prolonged cold exposure or b-adrenergic receptor activation
(Cousin et al. 1992; Ghorbani and Himms-Hagen 1997;
Barbatelli et al. 2010). These brown fat cells, which are
not derived from a myf5-positive lineage, are designated
beige or brown-in-white (brite) cells (Petrovic et al. 2010;
Seale et al. 2011). The propensity to accumulate brite/
beige cells differs between WAT depots in rodents. A large
accumulation of brown-like cells during cold exposure
can be found most readily in the subcutaneous inguinal

adipose tissue, but is rather seldom observed in epididymal/perigonadal adipose tissue (Seale et al. 2011). Notably, an increase in the abundance of brite/beige cells in
WAT (‘‘browning’’) has been observed in a large number of
knockout (KO) strains that show resistance to diet-induced
obesity and improved glucose metabolism (TsukiyamaKohara et al. 2001; Hansen et al. 2004; Christian et al.
2005; Wang et al. 2008; Romanatto et al. 2009).
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has emerged as an
important regulator of metabolic processes (Kharitonenkov
et al. 2005; Badman et al. 2007; Inagaki et al. 2007). Systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of
this factor leads to weight loss in obese mouse models
through increases in energy expenditure without alterations in food intake (Kharitonenkov et al. 2005; Coskun
et al. 2008). Thus far, the known target tissues of FGF21
action are liver, epididymal WAT (Fisher et al. 2010), and
the pancreas (Wente et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2009). The
hepatic effects of FGF21 are dramatic, leading to increased
fatty acid oxidation (Coskun et al. 2008; Potthoff et al.
2009). Although FGF21 was originally found to stimulate
insulin-independent glucose uptake in adipocytes through
induction of GLUT1 expression (Kharitonenkov et al.
2005; Moyers et al. 2007) and to inhibit liploysis (Arner
et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009), little is known about further
functions of FGF21 in adipose tissue (Kharitonenkov
et al. 2005).
We recently showed that both BAT and WAT express
high levels of the critical coreceptor b-klotho and are
sensitive to exogenous FGF21 stimulation (Fisher et al.
2011). FGF21-KO mice have larger BAT depots containing
larger lipid droplets, suggesting a function for FGF21 in
this tissue (Badman et al. 2009). In addition, two recent
reports demonstrated that FGF21 is synthesized in BAT in
response to cold exposure and b-adrenergic stimulation;
however, little effect of either stimulation was observed on
visceral WAT depots (Chartoumpekis et al. 2011; Hondares
et al. 2011).
Since FGF21 increases energy expenditure and is expressed in cold-stimulated BAT, we investigated in detail
the role of FGF21 in regulating the thermogenic activity
of adipose tissue. Here we show that FGF21 treatment
stimulates UCP1 gene expression in both BAT and WAT. It
dramatically increases the appearance of brown-like adipocytes in subcutaneous WAT. Moreover, FGF21 plays an
important role in the cellular and molecular adaptation of
adipose tissues to cold exposure. Interestingly, FGF21 does
not regulate PGC-1a mRNA levels but post-transcriptionally increases the protein content of this key regulatory
protein in adipose tissue.
Results
Pharmacologic treatment of FGF21 induces
thermogenic gene expression and browning of WAT
FGF21 is a critical regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the
liver during periods of nutritional deprivation or consumption of a ketogenic diet (Inagaki et al. 2007; Badman
et al. 2009). However, the role of FGF21 in adipose tissue
function remains poorly understood. Since BAT uses fatty
acids as fuel for nonshivering thermogenesis, we investigated whether FGF21 affects the thermogenic activity of
adipose tissue. In BAT, 3-d infusion of FGF21 mildly
increased expression of key thermogenic genes UCP1
and DIO2 (Fig. 1A). In addition, FGF21 increased the
expression of CPT1a and CPT1b, similar to what has
been described in the liver and consistent with the idea
that FGF21 mobilizes fatty acid usage. Interestingly,
a much greater induction of thermogenic gene expression
occurred in the inguinal WAT (IWAT) (Fig. 1B). FGF21
administration resulted in a 20-fold increase in UCP1

expression and a 10-fold increase in DIO2 expression in
this depot. Notably, molecular markers of brown-like
adipocytes, such as CIDEA and Cox7a, were also significantly increased. Additionally, we observed a 1.4-fold
increase in PGC-1a mRNA levels in IWAT of FGF21-
treated mice (Fig. 2B). A similar induction of gene expression was seen in perirenal adipose tissue (PRWAT),
which consists of a mixture of myf5-positive brown
adipocytes and classical white adipocytes (Fig. 1C; Seale
et al. 2008). The observed induction of genes characteristic of brown/beige fat suggested an overall browning of
these adipose tissues. Indeed, the histology revealed
a substantial increase in the appearance of pockets of
multilocular, UCP1-expressing adipocytes in the IWAT of
FGF21-treated animals (Fig. 1D). FGF21 also induced
UCP1 and DIO2 expression in epididymal WAT (EWAT);
however, even the induced levels of these genes were
insignificant compared with the expression levels observed in IWAT and PRWAT (Supplement Fig. 1A,C). In
addition, we did not see an increase in the expression of
markers of brown adipocytes (CIDEA, Cox8b, and Cox7a),
nor did we observe the histological appearance of any
‘‘brown-like’’ adipocytes in EWAT (data not shown).
To investigate whether these alterations in gene expression were mediated by an indirect effect or are direct
effects on the adipocytes, we treated primary BAT, IWAT,
and EWAT adipocytes with FGF21 and assessed the
patterns of thermogenic gene expression. A 2-d FGF21
treatment induced UCP1 and CIDEA mRNAs twofold to
fourfold in differentiated brown, inguinal, and epididymal
white adipocytes (Fig. 2A–C). CPT1a and CPT1b mRNA
levels were also increased in brown and inguinal white
adipocytes, similar to that observed in vivo. The extent of
differentiation was not visibly affected by FGF21 treatment, and general adipose differentiation genes such as
aP2 were not altered. Interestingly, we did not observe an
increase in PGC-1a, Cox7a, and Cox8b mRNA levels in
any of these cultures. Taken together, these data demonstrate that FGF21 can induce thermogenic gene expression and augmentation of a brown fat-like phenotype in
white adipose cells and tissues.
FGF21 expression is induced by cold exposure
and b-adrenergic stimulation in BAT and
thermogenically competent WAT depots
Thermogenic activation of brown and beige fat is critical
in the adaptive response to cold environments. In addition, two recent reports demonstrated that FGF21 mRNA
expression is induced in classical BAT upon cold stimulus
(Chartoumpekis et al. 2011; Hondares et al. 2011). We
therefore analyzed the expression of FGF21 in adipose tissue
depots during a cold challenge. Indeed, a robust induction of
FGF21 mRNA expression (threefold) was observed in BAT
after 3 d of cold exposure (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, FGF21
mRNA levels were also increased dramatically in the WAT
tissue depots that have an enhanced capacity to convert to
a ‘‘brown-like’’ state, such as IWAT (fivefold) and PRWAT
(16-fold) (Fig. 3A). Notably, the visceral depot EWAT, which
has a low thermogenic capacity, does not express higher
levels of FGF21 as a consequence of cold exposure. Increased FGF21 expression in adipose tissue was evident
with as little as 6 h of cold exposure (data not shown). Coldinduced FGF21 expression was restricted to the adipose
tissues as FGF21 mRNA levels decreased in the liver, in
contrast to the observed cold-induced gluconeogenic gene
expression (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the enhanced expression
of FGF21 mRNA in WAT and BAT did not lead to increased
circulating levels of FGF21 (Fig. 3C). Additionally, adipose
FGF21 mRNA levels also increased upon CL316243 injection, confirming that expression is regulated by b3-
adrenergic signaling (Fig. 3D).

To verify that FGF21 is synthesized and secreted by
adipocytes, we treated differentiated primary brown and
inguinal white adipocytes with isoproterenol (b-agonist).
FGF21 mRNA levels were robustly increased 6 h posttreatment in differentiated primary BAT (26-fold) and IWAT
(ninefold) adipocytes (Fig. 3E). Increased FGF21 levels
were also found in the medium of isoproterenol-treated
primary adipocytes (Fig. 3F), indicating that adipocytes
are indeed capable of synthesizing and secreting FGF21.
This suggests that adipose FGF21 may act mainly in a
paracrine/autocrine manner. These data show that FGF21
gene expression is induced in adipocytes upon cold stimulus
and is linked to the endogenous thermogenic response.
Genetic ablation of FGF21 leads to an impaired
adaptation to cold exposure
We next asked whether FGF21 is required for coldinduced adaptive thermogenesis. To do this, we exposed
FGF21-KO mice to an ambient temperature of 5°C for
3 d. Mice were implanted with telemetry probes to continuously monitor core body temperature. At temperatures close to thermoneutral (27°C), when adaptive
thermogenesis is not required, gene expression and morphology were very similar between wild-type and FGF21-
KO mice (Fig. 4E). However, robust differences were apparent after a 3-d cold exposure. The FGF21-KO mice were
colder than their wild-type littermates by ;0.5°C throughout the duration of the experiment, although this effect
did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.057) (Fig. 4A).
FGF21-KO mice were less active during cold exposure
and had increased circulating creatine kinase activity
levels (Supplemental Fig. 2A,B), which is indicative
of enhanced shivering (Cannon and Nedergaard 2011).
Although differences in cold-induced thermogenic gene
expression was not apparent in the intersacpular BAT of
FGF21-KO mice (Fig. 4B), the expression of UCP1, DIO2,
and CPT1b was significantly reduced in the IWAT and
PRWAT of the cold-exposed FGF21-KO mice (Fig. 4C,D).
Indeed, the induction of IWAT UCP1 mRNA was reduced
by nearly 50% in the FGF21-KO mice, compared with
controls. In addition, FGF21 ablation resulted in reduced
expression of genes that are indicative of browning (Cox7a,
Cox8b, and CIDEA), suggesting that the adaptive browning of the perirenal and inguinal fat depot is impaired. This
was also indicated by a large reduction in the amount of
UCP1-positive multilocular adipocytes in the IWAT of the
FGF21-KO mice (Fig. 4E). In EWAT, a fat depot that is not
very responsive to cold stimulation and in which FGF21
gene expression is not induced upon cold stimulation, the
expression of thermogenic genes and tissue morphology
was similar between control and knockout mice (Supplemental Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data show that
FGF21 expression is required for normal adaptations to
cold in thermogenically competent white fat pads.

PGC-1a is required for the thermogenic effect of FGF21
on adipose tissue
PGC-1a is a critical transcriptional regulator of oxidative
metabolism and adaptive thermogenesis. PGC-1a itself is
highly induced during cold exposure and has been found
to coactivate many DNA-binding transcription factors
required for thermogenesis, including PPARg, PPARa,
and ERRa. We therefore asked whether PGC-1a is required
for the thermogenic effects of FGF21. Primary differentiated brown and inguinal adipocytes derived from fatspecific PGC-1a-KO (aFKO) and control PGC-1a Flox
(aFlox) mice were treated with FGF21. As shown in Fig. 5,
A and B, FGF21-induced expression of UCP1, CIDEA, and
CPT1b was reduced in the absence of PGC-1a in both
brown and inguinal white adipocytes. To investigate the

requirement of PGC-1a for this response in vivo, we
treated aFKO mice with FGF21 for 3 d. Figure 5C illustrates that FGF21-mediated induction of thermogenic
genes was attenuated in the IWAT of the aFKO mice.
However, the response of BAT to FGF21 in the absence of
PGC-1a was only marginally attenuated (Fig. 5D), although it should be noted that FGF21 induces UCP1
expression to a far greater degree in IWAT. These data
indicate that PGC-1a is required for the FGF21-induced
thermogenic gene program in susceptible WATs.
FGF21 regulates PGC-1a at a post-transcriptional level
in BAT and WAT
The regulation of PGC-1a during thermogenesis has
mainly been studied and observed at the mRNA level.
Although PGC-1a is clearly required for some FGF21-
mediated effects on thermogenic gene expression, PGC-1a
mRNA does not increase after 48 h of FGF21 treatment in
culture (Fig. 2). In addition, we were not able to see any
increase in PGC-1a mRNA level after 8 h and 24 h of
FGF21 treatment (Supplemental Fig. 3A). The induction
of PGC-1a mRNA by FGF21 in vivo is marginal, failing to
reach significance in some of the depots. To investigate
whether FGF21 preferentially alters the PGC-1a protein,
we analyzed protein levels in cultured cells and in vivo.
Indeed, in the primary BAT and IWAT adipocytes where no
effect was observed on PGC-1a mRNA (Fig. 6A), a striking
increase in PGC-1a protein was apparent with FGF21
treatment (Fig. 6B). In vivo, where FGF21 trended to increase PGC-1a mRNA in BAT and IWAT (Fig. 6C), PGC-1a
protein levels were increased to a far greater extent (Fig.
6D). These data suggest that the role of FGF21 during cold
exposure is to enhance PGC-1a protein levels within
thermogenically active fat depots. This notion is further
supported by the attenuated induction in PGC-1a protein
content in the BAT and IWAT of FGF21-KO mice (Fig. 6F),
despite little effect on mRNA expression (Fig. 6E).
To test the hypothesis that increased PGC-1a protein
accumulation was due to enhanced protein stability, the
turnover of PGC-1a protein was investigated with a cycloheximide chase experiment. Since PGC-1a protein levels
are very low in brown and white differentiated adipocytes
in culture, we used forced expression of adenoviral-driven
PGC-1a in immortalized brown adipocytes (imBATs). As
shown in Supplemental Figure 3B, FGF21 treatment enhanced thermogenic gene expression in these immortalized cells, similar to what we observed in primary adipocytes. In addition, despite similar levels of PGC-1a
mRNA overexpression, higher amounts of PGC-1a protein were detected after FGF21 treatment (Supplemental
Fig. 3C). However, the results show that PGC-1a protein
stability was not increased in FGF21-treated adipocytes
(Supplemental Fig. 3C,D). These data suggest that FGF21
regulates PGC-1a protein by post-translational mechanisms other than protein degradation.
Since FGF21 signaling results in Erk phosphorylation
and activation (Fisher et al. 2011), we investigated whether
Figure 5. PGC-1a is required for the FGF21-mediated induction of thermogenic genes. To assess whether PGC-1a mediates the thermogenic effects of FGF21 in vitro, primary adipocytes sourced from aFKO mice were treated with FGF21 for 48 h. Real-time quantitative
PCR analysis is shown from primary brown (A) and inguinal white (B) adipocytes. To test the effects in vivo, aFlox and aFKO mice were
treated for 3 d with either saline or FGF21. mRNA expression of PGC-1a target genes is shown from IWAT (C) and BAT (D). Data are

Erk activation is required for FGF21-mediated thermogenic gene expression and for the enhancement of PGC-1a
protein levels. To this end, we treated imBATs with FGF21
in the absence and presence of the Erk inhibitor UO126. As
the data in Supplemental Figure 3, E and F, show, neither
FGF21-driven gene expression nor PGC-1a protein stabilization was suppressed by Erk inhibition.
Discussion
FGF21 has been described as an endocrine hormone with
beneficial metabolic actions. We report here that adipose
FGF21 is a critical paracrine/autocrine-acting component
of the endogenous cold response and is required for normal adaptations to cold exposure. FGF21 expression is
also necessary for the cold-induced recruitment of brownlike (beige) adipocytes in IWAT. In fact, pharmacologic
doses of FGF21 are able to induce a thermogenic gene response in both BAT and thermogenically competent WAT
depots. This process is associated with a large induction
of PGC-1a protein with little effect on PGC-1a gene
expression. FGF21 is the only known cold-induced secreted protein that functions to increase the appearance
of brown-like/brite adipocytes in WAT depots. The lack of

alteration in circulating FGF21 upon cold exposure suggests that this factor acts on the adipose tissues via autocrine or paracrine signaling. Presumably, this evolved to
expand the thermogenic machinery in vivo and provide
a more robust defense against hypothermia than can be
provided by the classically understood sympathetic nervous system–BAT pathway.
While the phenomenon of increased FGF21 expression
in BAT has been observed recently (Chartoumpekis et al.
2011; Hondares et al. 2011), little was known as to the
function and importance of this process. In agreement
with Hondares et al. (2010), we found that FGF21 can
increase thermogenic gene expression, such as UCP1
and CIDEA, in BAT and primary classical brown adipocytes. Interestingly, however, we found that FGF21 had
far more profound effects on thermogenic gene expression in specific WAT depots (IWAT and PRWAT) that are
thermogenically competent. Indeed, FGF21 appeared to
induce the expression of many genes associated with the
function of the brown/beige adipocytes. Furthermore,
using immunostaining for UCP1, we found that this was
due to a large increase in multilocular, brown-like
adipocytes in the inguinal fat pads of the FGF21-treated
mice.
FGF21 not only has the ability to induce a brown-like
phenotype in WAT pharamologically, but is required for
this physiological adaptation to occur during cold exposure. When cold-exposed, the FGF21-KO mice trended to
be a little colder. Although pharmacologic doses of FGF21
enhance thermogenic gene expression in BAT, this process was not attenuated in the cold-exposed FGF21-KO
mice, suggesting that compensation may be occurring in
this tissue. Nevertheless, cold induction of thermogenic
genes, including UCP1 and other markers of brown-like
adipocytes, was significantly attenuated in IWAT and
PRWAT of FGF21-KO mice. When viewed in total, our
data clearly show that FGF21 plays a far more important
role in thermogenically competent WAT-containing tissue depots, such as inguinal subcutaneous and perirenal
fat. In addition to adipose tissue thermogenesis, FGF21
may regulate lipolysis in vivo. However, the exact role of
FGF21 in regulating lipolysis remains controversial, with
reports of FGF21 both activating (Inagaki et al. 2007) and
inhibiting (Arner et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009) this process
in adipocytes. In the context of the time courses and
treatment regimes that we used, we saw no evidence to
suggest either scenario during FGF21-mediated thermogenesis (data not shown).
PGC-1a has been recognized as a critical regulator of
thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism. It is therefore
not completely surprising that this coactivator of transcription is important to the thermogenic effects of FGF21
both in culture and in vivo. This thermogenic response is
not completely attenuated in the absence of PGC-1a and
may be caused by redundancy to the second member of the
PGC-1 family, PGC-1b. Most interesting, however, is the
manner by which FGF21 regulates PGC-1a levels. Our
data suggest that the role of FGF21 is mainly to increase
PGC-1a protein rather than gene expression. Additionally,
in cold-exposed knockout mice, the absence of FGF21
results in diminished PGC-1a protein levels, suggesting
that this is an important function for FGF21 during a
response to cold temperatures. How this occurs remains a
subject of further investigation, but our experiments
suggest that PGC-1a is not regulated on the level of
protein stability. It is thus likely that other post-translational mechanisms, such as selective translation, may
contribute.
The beneficial affects of FGF21 on glucose metabolism
and body weight have evoked a substantial interest in
FGF21 as a potential treatment for diseases such as obesity
and diabetes (Coskun et al. 2008; Berglund et al. 2009; Xu
et al. 2009). Our data support a clear function for FGF21 in
regulating chronic adaptive thermogenesis by increasing
the transcription of thermogenic genes and enhancing the
thermogenic capacity of the organism by ‘‘browning’’ white
fat. It is tempting to speculate that the thermogenic effects
of FGF21 on adipose tissue may underlie many of its
beneficial effects observed in vivo. Thermogenesis is intimately linked with energy expenditure and may explain
the weight loss effects of FGF21 in mice. Further work will
be required to delineate the role of adipose tissue thermogenesis in FGF21-mediated weight loss and glycemic
control, and whether FGF21 could be used in the therapy
of obesity.

All studies were carried out using male C57Bl/6 mice obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained on a 12:12-h light–
dark cycle at 24°C. FGF21-KO mice were generated as previously
described (Badman et al. 2009). Briefly, mice were generated by
deletion of a 1200-base-pair (bp) region of FGF21, including the
39 section of exon 1, all of exon 3, and the 59 region of exon 3.
Founders were then back-crossed 10 times onto a C57Bl6 background. aFKO mice were generated by crossing female mice
homozygous for the floxed allele with heterozygous floxed male
mice carrying a transgene expressing cre-recombinase under
control of the adiponectin promoter. All animals were allowed
ad libitum access to food unless otherwise stated. All studies
were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Recombinant FGF21 protein
Recombinant FGF21 protein was generated by expression of
human FGF21 in Escherichia coli and was subsequently refolded
in vitro as previously described (Kharitonenkov et al. 2005).
Subcutaneous FGF21 infusion
FGF21 infusion for 3 d was delivered using Alzet miniosmotic
pumps (Durect Corporation). Pumps were filled with either
FGF21 (1 mg per hour; 24 mg per day) or vehicle (saline) and
primed for 4–6 h at 37°C before implantation. The pump was
inserted into the interscapular region under isoflurane anesthesia.
Briefly, the surgical area was shaved and cleaned with povidone–
iodine and an alcohol swab. A small lateral incision was made (10
mm) and the pump was carefully inserted. The incision was
closed with silk sutures, and mice were allowed to recover from
anesthesia in their home cages.

Cold exposure studies
Eleven-week-old wild-type and FGF21-KO mice were implanted
with TA-F10 telemetry transmitters (Data Sciences International). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and their
abdominal regions were shaved and prepped with betadine. A
small vertical incision was then made in the center of the abdomen, and the peritoneal cavity was opened. A sterile telemetry
probe was then carefully placed to one side of the peritoneum. The
peritoneum was then closed with absorbable sutures before final
closure of the abdomen with wound clips. Mice were allowed to
recover from anesthesia in their home cages and were kept for
a further 7 d at room temperature until recovery, and the wound
clips were removed. Mice were then placed in an incubator for 6 d
at 27°C before switching for a 72-h period to 5°C. Throughout this
period, the telemetry probes were set to record the activity and
core body temperature of the mice every minute. After 72 h of
cold exposure, mice were euthanized and tissues were harvested.
Temperature and activity data were analyzed by calculating the
hourly average and binning each 24-h period. Statistics were
analyzed via repeat measure ANOVA (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Stromal–vascular (SV) culture and white adipocyte
differentiation
Inguinal or epididymal SV fractions from 6- to 8-wk-old male
mice were obtained by the following procedure. Dissected fat tissue
from two or three mice (four to six fat pads total) was washed,
minced, and then digested for 45 min at 37°C in PBS containing
10 mM CaCl, 2.4 U/mL dispase II (Roche), and 1.5 U/mL collagenase D (Roche). Digested tissue was then filtered through a 100-mm
cell strainer to remove undigested tissues. The flow-through was
then centrifuged at 600g for 5 min to pellet the SV cells. The SV
cells, resuspended in complete SV culture medium (DMEM/F12
[1:1; Invitrogen] plus glutamax, pen/strep, and 10% FBS), were
then filtered through a 40-mm cell strainer to remove clumps and
large adipocytes. Following centrifugation as above, SV cells
were then resuspended in SV culture medium and plated onto
a 6-cm tissue culture dish.
For adipocyte differentiation assays, SV cells were plated and
grown to confluence in SV culture medium. At confluence (day
0), cells were exposed to the adipogenic cocktail containing 1 mM
dexamethasone, 5 mg/mL insulin, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (DMI), and 1 mM rosiglitazone in SV culture medium.
Forty-eight hours after induction, cells were maintained in SV
culture medium containing 5 mg/mL insulin. At day 6 of differentiation, cells were treated for two consecutive days with 50 nM
FGF21 and harvested at day 8. For isoproteranol treatments, cells
were treated with 1–5 mM isoprperanol for 6–8 h.
SV culture and brown adipocyte differentiation
The interscapular brown fat pad (total of six to eight fat pads) was
dissected from newborn mice (postnatal days 2–4), minced, and
then digested for 45 min at 37°C in isolation buffer (123 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM glucose, 100 mM
HEPES, 4% BSA, 1.5 mg/mL collagenase B [Roche]). Digested
tissue was then filtered through a 100-mm cell strainer to remove
undigested tissues. The flow-through was then centrifuged at
600g for 10 min to pellet the SV cells. The SV cells were then
resuspended in complete SV culture medium (DMEM/F12 [1:1;
Invitrogen] plus glutamax, pen/strep, and 10% FBS) and plated
onto a 10-cm tissue culture dish.
For brown adipocyte differentiation assays, SV cells were plated
and grown to confluence in SV culture medium. At confluence
(day 0), cells were exposed to the adipogenic cocktail containing
5 mM dexamethasone, 0.02 mM insulin, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 nM T3, 125 mM indomethacin, and 1 mM rosiglitazone
in SV culture medium. Forty-eight hours after induction, cells
were maintained in SV culture medium containing 0.02 mM
insulin and 1 nM T3. At day 6 of differentiation, cells were treated
for two consecutive days with 50 nM FGF21 and harvested at day
8. For isoproteranol treatments, cells were treated with 1–5 mM
isoprperanol for 6–8 h.
For differentiation of imBATs, preadipocytes were plated at
a density that allowed them to grow to confluence within 24–
48 h. At confluence, cells were differentiated using the abovedescribed brown fat differentiation cocktail. At day 6 of differentiation, cells were treated for two consecutive days with 50 nM
FGF21 and harvested at day 8. For adenoviral infections, adipocytes were transduced overnight at day 5 of differentiation with
1 3 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) per 10-cm dish of PGC-1aexpressing virus. For the cyclohexamide chase, adipocytes were
infected with PGC-1a adenovirus, treated for 2 d with FGF21, and
subsequently incubated in medium containing 20 mg/mL cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and
cell lysates were applied for Western blotting. b-Tubulin was used
for loading control. The quantification of the signal intensity
was done using ImageJ software. To block Erk activation, differentiated adipocytes (day 6) were simultaneously incubated
with 50 nM FGF21 and 10 mM UO126 until harvesting.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA from cultured cells or mouse tissues was isolated by
Qiazol extraction and purification using Qiagen RNeasy minicolumns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). For
quantitative real-time PCR analysis, 1–1.5 mg of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). SYBR Green reactions using the
SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems) were assembled along with 250 nM primers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and were performed using an ABI 7900 HT machine.
Relative expression of mRNAs was determined after normalization
to Rps18 or TBP. Student’s t-test was used to evaluate statistical
significance. All primer sequences are available on request.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from cells by homogenization
in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl,
1% NP40, 20% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT, supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). For
immunoprecipitation, the lysate was diluted 1:5 with an immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCL,
20% glycerol, and 2 mM EDTA. Two milligrams of diluted total
protein lysate was incubated overnight at 4°C with 2 mg of antiPGC-1a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The next morning,
20 mL of equilibrated Sepharose beads were added, followed by an
additional 4 h of incubation at 4°C. The beads were then washed
five times with 1 mL of immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended
in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an
immobilon P membrane (Millipore). For PGC-1a immunoblots,
membranes were blocked in 5% milk/0.1% Tween in PBS for >1
h and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-PGC1a monoclonal antibody (EMD) diluted 2 mg/mL in 3% BSA/0.1%
Tween in PBS. Proteins were visualized using the Supersignal
West Dura HRP Detection kit (Pierce).
Immunohistochemistry
For histological analysis, adipose tissue was fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut to 6-mm sections on slides.
