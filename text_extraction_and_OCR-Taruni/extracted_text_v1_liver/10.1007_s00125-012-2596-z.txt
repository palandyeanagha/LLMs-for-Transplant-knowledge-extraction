Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to examine the
prevalence of and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in
people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, using
Scottish national data.
Methods We identified individuals diagnosed with type 2
diabetes mellitus in Scotland between January 2005 and
May 2008 using data from the national diabetes database.
We calculated the prevalence of retinopathy and ORs for
risk factors associated with retinopathy at first screening.
Results Of the 51,526 people with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes mellitus identified, 91.4% had been screened by 31
December 2010. The median time to first screening was
315 days (interquartile range [IQR] 111–607 days), but by
2008 the median was 83 days (IQR 51–135 days). The
prevalence at first screening of any retinopathy was 19.3%,
and for referable retinopathy it was 1.9%. For individuals
screened after a year the prevalence of any retinopathy was
20.5% and referable retinopathy was 2.3%. Any retinopathy
at screening was associated with male sex (OR 1.19, 95% CI
1.14, 1.25), HbA1c (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08 per 1%
[11 mmol/mol] increase), systolic BP (OR 1.06, 95% CI
1.05, 1.08 per 10 mmHg increase), time to screening (OR
for screening >1 year post diagnosis01.12, 95% CI 1.07,
1.17) and obesity (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82, 0.93) in multivariate analysis.
Conclusions/interpretation The prevalence of retinopathy at
first screening is lower than in previous UK studies, consistent with earlier diagnosis of diabetes. Most newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in Scotland are screened
within an acceptable interval and the prevalence of referable
disease is low, even in those with delayed screening.

Introduction
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading preventable
causes of visual impairment in the UK [1]. Treatment can
prevent vision loss, but requires early detection and careful
monitoring to be most effective [2]. The prevalence of
diabetic retinopathy at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is a
useful indirect measure of how well a healthcare system is
performing with respect to diabetes detection; where type 2
diabetes is present for a long time prior to diagnosis prevalence rates of diabetic retinopathy at diagnosis will be
high [3]. Prevalence at diagnosis also indicates to what
extent there is an urgency to perform retinal screening after
diagnosis. Finally, understanding the characteristics of those
patients with type 2 diabetes who have diabetic retinopathy
at diagnosis is of practical use for targeting of screening.
The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and
determinants of diabetic retinopathy among people with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Scotland (population
5.1 million). We also assess the coverage, uptake and rapidity
of retinal screening delivery in this population.
Methods
The data used were from an anonymised extract of the
Scottish Care Information – Diabetes Collaboration (SCIDC), a clinical database that holds data on people diagnosed
with diabetes in Scotland. The SCI-DC database was rolled
out across Scotland from 2000 and the estimated coverage of
the total diabetic population is around 99%. SCI-DC captures
key diabetes-related data items, such as BMI, HbA1c, lipids
and BP, from all hospitals and 1,100 general practices in
Scotland. SCI-DC data were linked to death records held by
the National Records of Scotland using probabilistic linkage.
The national roll out of the Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy
Screening (DRS) programme to improve the availability of
high-quality retinal screening in Scotland [4] began in 2006,
attaining nationwide coverage by January 2007. All eligible
patients (aged 12 years and over) registered on the SCI-DC
are invited to participate in this programme. All new registrants are automatically entered as new patients on the DRS
database, which triggers the appointment process. Those
who are already attending eye clinics for diabetic eye disease, those declining screening and those who are too unfit
or frail for screening are suspended from the programme,
with their status reviewed at least every 3 years. The retinal
examination involves a single-field digital photograph, with
mydriasis if required, with centralised grading [5] or, when
photographic images are ungradable, slit-lamp examination.
Slit-lamp examination gradings were not available for all
health boards for the whole period of the study, but were
included for analysis when available. The use of a single
central-field digital photograph for the detection of sightthreatening retinopathy has been validated [6–8]. The
programme includes quality-control protocols to ensure the
quality of the photographs and the grading [9].
Each eye is given a retinopathy and a maculopathy grade.
The subsequent action taken is determined by the most
severe finding in the worst eye. The grading scheme for
the DRS programme is shown in Table 1. Visual acuity is
often unaffected during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, but may deteriorate as the severity of the retinopathy
and maculopathy worsens with proliferative retinopathy
(R4) and referable maculopathy (M2), both of which are
sight-threatening conditions. Previous analyses from the
pilot phase of the DRS programme estimate the prevalence
of diabetic retinopathy at 20% [10] and the referral rate for
eye disease at 3% [5]. The most recent data for the years
2009–2010 indicate a stable referral rate of 3.5% [9].
For this analysis, the retinopathy/maculopathy grade for
an individual was defined as the grade of the worst eye. We
extracted data on all those registered on SCI-DC with type 2
diabetes diagnosed between 1 January 2005 and 31 May
2008 (the most recently available capture of new patients).
DRS data for this cohort were available up to the end of
2010, as were data for other covariates including sex, age,
BMI, HbA1c, BP, total cholesterol and socioeconomic status
(as assessed by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation
[SIMD], a measure indexed by residence [11]). For covariates, the measurement used was the one made at the time
nearest to the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. When no measure was available within 180 days of diagnosis, the data
were considered to be missing; the exception was BMI, for
which data were considered missing when no observation
was available within 365 days of diagnosis. For individuals
diagnosed prior to the launch of the DRS programme, the
time to screening was calculated as the time from diagnosis
to the first SCI-DC entry representing retinal examination,
regardless of the source; for those diagnosed after the launch
of the DRS programme, the time to screening was calculated
as the time to first DRS screening.
The primary date of type 2 diabetes diagnosis was based
on the date entered into the SCI-DC by clinicians; if multiple dates were entered we took the earliest date. This date
2336 Diabetologia (2012) 55:2335–2342

was checked against multiple data sources including
prescription and hospital discharge records for any prior
evidence of type 2 diabetes. We excluded 2,406 individuals
(4.4% of potentially eligible individuals) where there was
significant discrepancy over the date of diagnosis (i.e. a
difference in date of diagnosis of >120 days). Where there
was a discrepancy of <120 days we selected the earliest date
for our analyses. Diabetes type was determined according to
type recorded in SCI-DC with the addition of an algorithm
to identify individuals at high risk of being mislabelled
based on age of diagnosis and early use of insulin.
Approval was obtained from the Scotland A Research
Ethics Committee, the Caldicott (data privacy) Guardian for
the 14 Scottish Health Boards and the ISD Privacy Advisory
Committee.
Statistical analysis We used t tests to compare continuous
variables and χ2 tests to compare dichotomous variables
among people screened within 1 year of diagnosis vs those
screened later, and people who had successful screening vs
those with ungradable photographic images. Logistic regression was used to examine independent associations of variables with the prevalence of retinopathy at screening. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to examine independent associations of variables with time from diagnosis to
first retinal screening. To control for observed clustering of
times to first screening, associated with the year of diagnosis
(i.e. the strong relationship between time to screening and
year of diagnosis), we fitted a multivariate mixed-effects
Cox proportional hazards model, with year of diagnosis
taken as a random effect, and age, sex and any of the
variables that were significantly associated in univariate
analysis entered as fixed effects. All statistical analysis
was undertaken using the R statistical package [12].
Results
There were 51,526 people with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes eligible for the study. Over half were male (n0
28,576 [55%]) and the mean age at diagnosis was 61.8 years
(SD 12.8 years). As of 31 December 2010, 47,090 (91.4%)
people had attended a retinal screening examination, with
25,322 (53.8% of the screened population) screened within
1 year of diagnosis. A total of 4,436 (8.6%) had not attended
a DRS screening (Table 2). The leading reason for not being
screened related to ill health, with 2,143 (4.2%) dying prior
to the end of 2010. (Among those who died before screening, the median time from diabetes diagnosis to death was
375 days, interquartile range [IQR] 169–657 days.) Suspension from the programme because of eye clinic attendance

affected only 0.8% of the population. The proportion of
unscreened individuals declined over time: of all individuals
diagnosed in 2005, 1,917 (12.1%) had not been screened as
of 31 December 2010, while for subsequent years those
numbers fell to 1,283 (10.1%) in 2006, 941 (8.2%) in
2007 and 238 (5.4%) in 2008.
Complete covariate data for the period around diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes were available for the majority of individuals with a record of screening (n040,194, 85.4%). The
proportions of missing data by variable were: 8.5% for
HbA1c (n04,006); 6.3% for total cholesterol (n02,981);
6.0% for BMI (n02,832); 5.2% for BP (n02,470); and
0.6% for SIMD (n0293).
Time to screening Of the 47,090 who were screened, the
median time to first retinal screening was 315 days (IQR
111–607 days). However, time to first screening was
strongly related to year of diagnosis (Fig. 1); individuals
diagnosed in 2005 had a median time to any documented
screening of almost 18 months (median0540 days, IQR
258–747) falling to <3 months (median083 days, IQR 51–
135) in 2008. In a mixed-effects multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, with year of diagnosis treated as a
random effect and the other variables as fixed effects, male
sex (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05), older age (HR 1.01, 95%
CI 1.00, 1.02 per 10 years of age), systolic BP ≥135 mmHg
(HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.10), diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg (HR
1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.04), total cholesterol ≥4.5 mmol/l (HR
1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.07) and lower socioeconomic status
(HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.04) were all statistically significantly associated with longer time to screening, while
obesity was associated with a shorter time to screening
(HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95, 0.99) within a multivariate model
(p<0.05). HbA1c at diagnosis was not associated with time
to screening.
Prevalence of retinopathy and maculopathy The prevalence
of any diabetic retinopathy at first screening was 19.3% and
that of referable diabetic retinopathy was 1.9% (Table 3),
with only 0.7% having R3 or R4 grade retinopathy.
The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy varied by time to
screening; for individuals screened within 1 year of diagnosis (n025,322) the prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy
was 18.3% and 1.6% for referable diabetic retinopathy vs
20.5% and 2.3%, respectively, for people screened more
than a year after diagnosis (p<0.0001 for both comparisons).
The prevalence was highest for those first screened >2 years
after diagnosis (n07,512) who had a prevalence of any
diabetic retinopathy of 20.7% and of referable diabetic retinopathy of 2.7%. Individuals screened within 3 months of
diagnosis (n09,354) had a prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy of 18.5% and referable diabetic retinopathy of 1.4%.
Details of the diagnosis for the eye disease causing
follow-up with the eye clinics were not available for 0.8%
of this population. If we assume all these people (n0399
[see Table 2]) are attending an eye clinic because of diabetic
retinopathy, then the upper limit of any diabetic retinopathy
for the population is 20.0% and 2.6% for referable diabetic
retinopathy.
Ungradable images (R6) Not all screening examinations
resulted in gradable images. When the DRS programme
does not obtain satisfactory photographs, slit-lamp examinations are undertaken. However, results from these examinations have not routinely been entered into the central
database until recently. Within the current analyses 578
individuals had results available from slit-lamp examinations and are categorised according to the retinopathy status

found by slit-lamp examination. Overall, 7.6% of those
screened during the study period had an ungradable image
and no slit-lamp examination result available. Individuals
with ungradable images were older (mean age 72 years), had
higher systolic BP (140.7 mmHg), lower diastolic BP (mean
77.8 mmHg), lower total cholesterol (mean 4.99 mmol/l),
lower HbA1c (7.9% [63 mmol/mol]), and lower BMI (mean
30.1 kg/m2
) when compared with those who had successful
screening (p<0.001 for all differences using the t test).
Of the 3,567 people with ungradable images at their first
screening, 2,198 (61.6%) had no diabetic retinopathy at their
next screening, with 356 (10.0%) having evidence of
diabetic retinopathy, while the remaining 1,013 (28.4%)
had persistently ungradable images. If we assume that this
subsequent finding of referable diabetic retinopathy had
been present at the first examination and that persistently
ungraded eyes all represent diabetic retinopathy then the
overall rate of diabetic retinopathy at first screening in the
study would increase from 19.3% to 19.9%.
Risk factors associated with early diabetic retinopathy In
univariate logistic regression models the following variables
were associated with the presence of retinopathy at first
screening: male sex, lower BMI, higher HbA1c, longer time
to first retinopathy screening, lower socioeconomic status
and higher systolic and diastolic BP. There was no association with age at diagnosis or total cholesterol (data not
shown). In a logistic regression model that included all the
variables associated with retinopathy in the univariate analyses, together with age, the factors independently associated
with retinopathy were male sex, lower BMI, higher HbA1c,
higher systolic BP and longer time to first retinopathy
screening (Table 4). When those not screened because of
eye clinic attendance were included in the above model as
having retinopathy these risk factor relationships did not
change appreciably (data not shown).
Discussion
Diabetic retinopathy remains a major complication of type 2
diabetes and requires early detection for best treatment [2].
The DRS programme had screened 91.4% of all people in
Scotland newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by 31 December 2010. The median time from diabetes diagnosis to
retinopathy screening declined throughout the study period,
with participants diagnosed in 2008 having a median wait to
screening of 83 days. The prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy among people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes was 19.3%, which is almost half the prevalence of any
diabetic retinopathy, 35–39%, reported by the UKPDS [13].
The major strengths of the current study are its use of
national-level data, which include the results of retinal photography screening for diabetic retinopathy and covariate
data from the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis. The DRS
is the only form of diabetic retinopathy screening recognised
for primary care payments in Scotland, so it is the dominant
method of diabetic retinopathy screening. Scotland also has
a means for linking an individual’s medical data from a
variety of sources via a unique medical identifier, which
allows the incorporation of data from many sources. The
richness of the data sources allowed us to use a variety of data
to determine diabetes type. This meant we were able to exclude individuals from the study who showed strong evidence
for having type 1 diabetes even if originally classified as
having type 2 diabetes. Similarly, we could interrogate a
number of data sources to ensure that the individuals included
in the study had a consistent date of diagnosis.

There are also weaknesses of this study to consider. The
DRS programme is aimed at detecting sight-threatening
diabetic retinopathy and relies on a single-field photograph
per eye, as has been validated as a means for identifying
sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy [6–8]. This approach
is less sensitive than the seven-fields-per-eye approach
used in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic
Retinopathy [14] and will miss mild disease, such as
peripheral microaneurysms. We also lack data for the
presence of diabetic retinopathy among the small proportion
of individuals in Scotland who obtain their screening
outside the DRS programme. This is primarily via ophthalmology clinics and, as <1% of the population attend such
screenings, even if we assumed all of these individuals had
diabetic retinopathy it would not make a major difference to
our prevalence estimate (20.0% vs 19.3%).
In the UKPDS, which recruited patients with new-onset
type 2 diabetes aged 25–65 between 1983 and 1991, the
prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy was 35% in women
and 39% in men [13]. The UKPDS excluded individuals
with severe diabetic retinopathy at baseline. Our data are not
directly comparable as the UKPDS used four fields and so
was more likely to detect early grades of peripheral diabetic
retinopathy than our study. However, much has changed
since the UKPDS, including the diagnostic criteria for diabetes as well as health policy in the UK. There is now a
greater emphasis on screening for type 2 diabetes. Unlike
the NHS in England and Wales, the NHS in Scotland has not
adopted systematic screening for type 2 diabetes [15]; however, risk profiling for cardiovascular disease, including
testing for type 2 diabetes, has been encouraged [16]. Identifying obese patients who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes
is also included in the Quality and Outcomes Framework, a
series of standards for primary care practices that provides
additional funds on the basis of meeting specific targets
[17]. The lower prevalence of diabetic retinopathy at
diabetes diagnosis reported in the current study suggests
that these system-wide changes have reduced delays in
diabetes diagnosis.
Our findings are in line with reports from recent population studies in which the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy
ranged from 6% to 23% [3, 14, 18–21]. The lowest estimates (6.2% in Australia [18] and 10.2% in the USA [20])
come from studies that undertook simultaneous diabetes
diagnosis and retinal screening. Diabetic retinopathy also
occurs in non-diabetic populations [22, 23], with estimates
ranging from 5.2% in the Pima Indians [21] to 8% in the
general US population [24]. In Australia the prevalence of
diabetic retinopathy was 5.8% for those with normal glucose
tolerance and 6.7% in people with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose [18]. This suggests that
even with moves to minimise delay in diagnosis of diabetes
through diabetes screening programmes we would not
anticipate achieving a prevalence of diabetic retinopathy at
the time of diagnosis of less than 5%. It also raises the
question of whether factors other than dysglycaemia may
be relevant to the development of diabetic retinopathy in
some individuals.
The importance of glycaemia, blood pressure and diabetes duration as risk factors for diabetic retinopathy is already
well established [13, 14, 25–27]. Male sex has also been
reported as a risk factor in other studies [27]. Results
concerning the relationship between BMI and risk for diabetic
retinopathy are inconsistent, with both positive [26, 28] and
negative associations [29–31] reported. We have not reported
the associations with smoking or triacylglycerols because
there were insufficient data for individuals in the study at the
time of diagnosis.
Of the risk factors for delays in screening found in the
current study only high systolic BP was also associated with
the presence of diabetic retinopathy at first screening and
none of the factors measured had a clinically significant
impact on delays in screening. While delays in screening
are a concern, the knowledge that the prevalence of diabetic
retinopathy and sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy is low
even for those screened after 24 months is reassuring. The
USA has now started diagnosing diabetes based on the
presence of an elevated HbA1c [32]. It is unknown how
HbA1c criteria will impact on time to diagnosis in the population and the net effect could be earlier diagnosis because of
greater ease in carrying out the test (i.e. no requirement for
fasting or glucose challenge), or later diagnosis as HbA1c
diagnosis detects fewer individuals than the standard glucose
tolerance tests [33]. Our data suggest that a delay in diagnosis
of up to 2 years would have a minimal impact on the prevalence of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy.
Conclusions
The nationwide DRS programme has successfully screened
over 90% of individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Scotland, with the majority being screened within
12 months of diagnosis. Delays in screening have become
less common over time, indicating improvements in the
system as the DRS programme attained full national coverage, with a current median time to screening of <3 months.
When diabetic retinopathy screening was within 3 months
of diabetes diagnosis, the prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy was 18.5% and 1.4% for referable diabetic retinopathy.
While these prevalences are much lower than those reported in
the past they remain higher than estimates from population
screening, suggesting that there is still room for earlier diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population. However, even
among individuals not screened until after a year of diagnosis
the prevalence of referable eye disease remains very low.
