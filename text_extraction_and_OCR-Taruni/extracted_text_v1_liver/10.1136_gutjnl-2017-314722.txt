ABSTRACT
Clinical history, questionnaire data and response 
to antisecretory therapy are insufficient to make a 
conclusive diagnosis of GERD in isolation, but are of 
value in determining need for further investigation. 
Conclusive evidence for reflux on oesophageal testing 
include advanced grade erosive oesophagitis (LA grades 
C and D), long-segment Barrett’s mucosa or peptic 
strictures on endoscopy or distal oesophageal acid 
exposure time (AET) >6% on ambulatory pH or pHimpedance monitoring. A normal endoscopy does not 
exclude GERD, but provides supportive evidence refuting 
GERD in conjunction with distal AET <4%and <40 reflux 
episodes on pH-impedance monitoring off proton pump 
inhibitors. Reflux-symptom association on ambulatory 
reflux monitoring provides supportive evidence for 
reflux triggered symptoms, and may predict a better 
treatment outcome when present. When endoscopy 
and pH or pH-impedance monitoring are inconclusive, 
adjunctive evidence from biopsy findings (histopathology 
scores, dilated intercellular spaces), motor evaluation 
(hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter, hiatus hernia 
and oesophageal body hypomotility on high-resolution 
manometry) and novel impedance metrics (baseline 
impedance, postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic 
wave index) can add confidence for a GERD diagnosis; 
however, diagnosis cannot be based on these findings 
alone. An assessment of anatomy, motor function, 
reflux burden and symptomatic phenotype will therefore 
help direct management. Future GERD management 
strategies should focus on defining individual patient 
phenotypes based on the level of refluxate exposure, 
mechanism of reflux, efficacy of clearance, underlying 
anatomy of the oesophagogastric junction and 
psychometrics defining symptomatic presentations.
Introduction
GERD has an estimated worldwide prevalence 
of 8%–33%, involves all age groups and both 
genders1
 and carries a price tag estimated at >US$9–
US$10billion/year in the USA alone, largely related 
to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use and diagnostic 
testing.2
 The current paradigm of GERD diagnosis hinges on the identification of oesophageal 
mucosal lesions or troublesome symptoms caused by 
gastro-oesophageal reflux.3
 A putative GERD diagnosis is bolstered by a favourable response to PPI 
therapy.4
 The primary determinant of mucosal injury 
is excessive oesophageal acid exposure attributable to 
anatomical or physiological defects of the oesophagogastric junction (EGJ) and oesophageal peristalsis.5
GERD symptoms, however, have multiple potential determinants including the number of reflux 
episodes, the proximal extent to which the refluxate 
migrates, the acidity of the refluxate, oesophageal hypersensitivity and cognitive hypervigilance. 
Consequently, depending on the clinical context, the 
defining features of GERD can be pathology, physiology or symptomatology. In this paradigm, oesophageal testing is often undertaken to define optimal 
management, be that PPI therapy, antireflux surgery 
(ARS) or cognitive behavioural therapy.
The aim of the GERD consensus process was 
to determine modern indications for oesophageal 
testing in GERD, and as an extension to that aim, 
to define criteria for a clinical diagnosis of GERD. 
The consensus process started in 2014, when the 
primary aims were formulated, followed by a 
literature search and grading of evidence. There 
was extensive discourse within a multinational 
group of GERD experts over 2 years, following 
which consensus statements were developed and 
published.6–8 These consensus statements were 
adapted for the practising gastroenterologist by a 
cohort of international experts at the Lyon GERD 
consensus meeting in November 2017, the conclusions from which are presented in this manuscript.
Diagnosis of GERD
GERD is empirically diagnosed and treated in 
clinical practice based on the clinician’s symptom 
assessment. Indications for testing include treatment failure, diagnostic uncertainty and treating 
(or preventing) complications of GERD. However, 
diagnostic testing may or may not support the initial 
diagnosis, as the criteria defining GERD are specific 
to each testing modality. Consequently, understanding the performance characteristics of each 
diagnostic modality and recognising evidence that 
supports or refutes the clinical impression of GERD 
is crucial. The Lyon Consensus evaluated GERD 
diagnostic tests from that perspective, and test 
results were categorised as being adequate to establish or refute a GERD diagnosis or inconclusive in 
the absence of additional supportive evidence.
The primary focus of oesophageal testing has 
hitherto been restricted to detection of excessive 
acid reflux as indicative of pathological GERD, 
supported by reflux-symptom association analysis. 
The threshold value discriminating abnormal from 
normal oesophageal acid exposure with 24hour
pH-metry was initially selected based on evidence 
that higher acid exposure is associated with the presence of reflux oesophagitis.9
 However, the focus of

Recent advances in clinical practice
current GERD management is on healing mucosal disease and on 
managing symptoms. The association of oesophageal acid exposure 
with patient symptoms is weak,10 11 making sole reliance of this 
metric problematic. Expansion of testing to include oesophageal 
mucosal impedance, manometry, histopathology and psychometrics may help in this regard, potentially identifying distinct GERD 
phenotypes with unique management implications. Each test adds 
a piece to the overall puzzle of symptom generation, disease pathophysiology and precision management.
Clinical history and questionnaires
Typical GERD symptoms (heartburn and acid regurgitation) are 
more likely than atypical symptoms to respond to treatment, 
emphasising the value of an accurate clinical history.5
 However, 
when compared with objective evidence of GERD defined by 
pH-metry or endoscopy, even an expert history by a gastroenterologist has only 70% sensitivity and 67% specificity,12
reiterating the distinction between a physiology-based and a 
symptom-based GERD diagnosis. Likewise, questionnaires such 
as the reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease questionnaire (GERDQ) have similar limitations 
when compared with physiological testing.12–14 However, in 
clinical practice, diagnosing and treating GERD based on typical 
symptoms is pragmatic and endorsed by societal guidelines,4
even though these symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific 
for objectively defined GERD.12
Proton pump inhibitor trial
Although pragmatic, symptomatic response to PPI therapy does 
not equate to a GERD diagnosis, exhibiting an imperfect correspondence with objectively defined disease. On average, 69% 
of patients with oesophagitis, 49% of patients with non-erosive 
reflux disease (NERD) and 35% of patients with normal endoscopy and pH-metry gain symptom relief from a PPI trial.15 Hence, 
when evaluated as a diagnostic test for GERD among patients with 
heartburn, an empiric PPI trial has a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of only 44% compared with the combination of endoscopy 
and pH-metry.12 16 With atypical symptoms (chest pain, chronic 
cough, laryngitis, etc), PPI response rates are much lower than 
with heartburn, thereby diminishing the utility of that approach to 
diagnosis.17 A major limitation of the ‘PPI test’ is the strong modulation of symptoms by oesophageal hypersensitivity18 19; there is 
also variation in PPI dosing and duration of the test.20 Nonetheless, 
despite low specificity and high placebo response,21 the empiric 
PPI treatment approach is less costly than diagnostic testing22 and 
is endorsed by societal guidelines4
 undoubtedly leading to the 
overdiagnosis of GERD and overuse of PPIs.
Endoscopy and biopsy
When putative GERD symptoms do not respond to empiric PPI 
therapy, upper endoscopy (EGD) is advised both to evaluate for 
GERD complications and to detect potential alternative diagnoses that might redirect therapy. High-grade oesophagitis (LA 
grades C or D), Barrett’s oesophagus or peptic stricturing are 
considered confirmatory evidence for GERD.6
 However, erosive 
oesophagitis is found in only 30% of treatment-naïve patients 
with heartburn and in <10%when already taking a PPI.23 24
Furthermore, most of that is low-grade, and lower grades of 
oesophagitis, particularly LA grade A, are non-specific, found 
in 5%–7.5% of asymptomatic controls.25–27 When accurately 
defined, LA grade B oesophagitis provides adequate evidence 
for initiation of medical management of GERD, but problems 
with interobserver variability led an expert panel to conclude 
that additional pH-metry evidence is requisite prior to pursuing 
ARS.28 Barrett’s oesophagus is observed in 5%–15% of patients 
with chronic GERD,29–31 but histological confirmation is documented in only 50% of these. In summary, EGD findings can be 
clinically important and specific for GERD, but EGD has a low 
sensitivity in GERD diagnosis.
The Rome IV consensus recommended oesophageal biopsies during EGD to rule out eosinophilic oesophagitis.32 Biopsies may also have value in differentiating NERD (with positive 
pH-metry) from reflux hypersensitivity, functional heartburn 
and controls when scored using a structured histopathological 
protocol evaluating papillary elongation, basal cell hyperplasia, 
dilated intercellular spaces, intraepithelial inflammatory cells, 
necrosis and erosions33 34; changes that resolve following adequate 
GERD therapy.35 However, histopathological findings can overlap 
between the groups studied, and are not conclusive of GERD. 
Identification of dilated intercellular spaces on electron microscopy 
suggests mucosal injury from reflux,36 37 but clinical application is 
limited. The widespread adoption of histopathological examination for GERD injury is hindered by the cumbersome protocol and 
need for a dedicated oesophageal pathologist.33 38 39
Ambulatory reflux monitoring
Ambulatory reflux monitoring can provide confirmatory 
evidence of GERD, in patients with normal endoscopy, atypical symptoms and/or when contemplating ARS.6
 Reflux monitoring demonstrates the consequence of GERD pathophysiology, 
evident as either excessive oesophageal acid exposure time 
(AET) or reflux episodes, rather than the mechanism by which 
that occurs. Reflux-symptom association uses simple ratios and 
statistical tests to determine whether reflux episodes co-occur 
with symptoms, and adds value to ambulatory reflux monitoring. Hence, reflux monitoring can confirm or exclude pathological GERD, although not always conclusively.
The primary outcome of a 24-hour pH-metry study is the AET. 
Extending recording time to 48 or 96hours with the wireless pH
monitoring system increases the diagnostic yield40–42 and test reproducibility,43 and is particularly useful when a transnasal catheter 
was not tolerated or yielded a negative result despite high suspicion of GERD.40 44 However, wireless pH monitoring is expensive, 
limiting its availability. Another variation on reflux monitoring is 
pH-impedance monitoring, which characterises reflux events with 
both a pH electrode and a series of impedance electrodes. Since 
pH-impedance detects all reflux (liquid, gas or mixed) regardless of 
acidity, and defines the direction of flow, it is considered the gold 
standard.6 45 However, the added yield is limited,46 47 the test is not 
widely available and the interpretation is laborious.
Reflux monitoring can be done ‘on’ or ‘off’ PPI therapy in 
patients with persistent and/or atypical symptoms despite PPI 
therapy. The Lyon Consensus proposes that testing always be 
performed off therapy to demonstrate baseline AET in ‘unproven 
GERD’, meaning no (or low-grade) oesophagitis at endoscopy, 
and no prior positive pH testing.8
 Testing off therapy is also 
recommended when done to evaluate for ARS.6 32 In contrast, 
the Lyon Consensus proposes that patients with ‘proven GERD’ 
(prior LA grade C or D oesophagitis, long segment Barrett’s 
oesophagus or prior abnormal pH-metry) be evaluated on 
double-dose PPI therapy to establish correlation between refractory symptoms and reflux episodes and/or to exclude inadequate acid suppression or poor compliance as the mechanism 
of persisting symptoms. This assessment requires pH-impedance 
(vs pH) monitoring since most reflux episodes on PPI therapy 
are weakly acidic (pH 4–7).48 49

Recent advances in clinical practice
Assessment of proximal oesophageal or pharyngeal reflux 
has also been proposed, but methodology and interpretation 
have not been standardised, and outcome studies are currently 
lacking.50–53 An additional problem with the pharyngeal pH 
probe designed to evaluate both aerosolised and liquid acid 
reflux54 is that it detects pharyngeal pH drops in the absence 
of concomitant oesophageal pH-impedance events,55 56 even in 
patients post-gastrectomy, raising questions about its accuracy.57
Interpretation of pH and pH-impedance monitoring
Among the pH monitoring metrics, AET is the most reproducible,58 is reliably extracted from automated analysis and is predictive of response from medical and surgical reflux therapy.59 60
However, the significance of an abnormal AET is proportionate 
to the degree of abnormality, and the Lyon Consensus proposes 
that AET <4% be considered definitively normal (physiological) 
and >6% be considered definitively abnormal6
 with intermediate values between these limits being inconclusive. Another 
outcome metric of pH-impedance monitoring is the number of 
reflux episodes (acidic, weakly acidic or weakly alkaline) with 
the caveat that this is overestimated by the automated analysis 
and requires manual review of the tracing.61 The Lyon GERD 
Consensus proposes that >80reflux episodes per 24hours are 
definitively abnormal, while a number <40 is physiological6
and intermediate values inconclusive. The clinical relevance of 
an abnormal number of reflux episodes remains incompletely 
defined, although recent preliminary data demonstrate improvement of regurgitation verified by increased reflux episodes 
following magnetic sphincter augmentation.62 Consequently, 
this is considered an adjunctive measure to be used when AET 
is inconclusive (ie, between 4% and 6%). pH-Impedance monitoring assists diagnosis of belching disorders and rumination, 
which can mimic reflux disease. Additional impedance parameters such as bolus exposure, baseline impedance and postreflux 
swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) also have potential as 
reflux metrics, but outcome data are currently limited.
Reflux-symptom association
Both pH monitoring and combined pH-impedance monitoring 
provide analysis of the temporal association between symptoms 
with a crisp onset (eg, heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, cough 
or belching) and reflux episodes.63 The time window applied for 
reflux-symptom association analysis is 2min.64 65 The Symptom 
Index (SI) is the percentage of symptom events preceded by reflux 
episodes,66 and the optimal SI threshold for heartburn is 50%.67
The disadvantage of the SI is that the number of reflux episodes 
is not considered leaving open the possibility of chance association. The Symptom Association Probability (SAP) and the Ghillebert Probability Estimate (GPE), also known as Binomial Symptom 
Index (BSI), use more complex statistical calculations to express 
the probability that symptom events and reflux episodes are associated68 69 and are considered positive if the probability (P value) 
of the observed association occurring by chance is <5%. Both SAP 
and GPE/BSI take all relevant components, that is, total numbers 
of symptom events, reflux episodes and reflux-related symptom 
events, into account. In summary, SI is a measure of ‘effect size’, 
whereas SAP is a measure of probability. As such the two metrics 
are complementary, measure different things and cannot be 
compared with each other. The combination of a positive SI and 
positive SAP provides the best evidence of a clinically relevant association between reflux episodes and symptoms.6 70 71 Both the SI 
and SAP are predictive of the effect of medical and surgical antireflux therapy, independent of AET.72–75
The reliability of reflux-symptom association analysis is critically dependent on proper execution of the reflux monitoring 
procedure and meticulous analysis protocols including careful 
selection of symptoms of interest. Patients must be instructed 
to use the symptom event button on the portable data logger 
accurately and to fill in the symptom diary accurately. The 
outcome of symptom association analysis is more reliable when 
at least three symptom events occur during the test.6
 When 
cough is the symptom of interest, an automated acoustic or 
manometric cough monitor is necessary to accurately capture 
cough events.76 77 Prolonged wireless pH monitoring increases 
the yield of symptom association analysis,40 41 as does combined 
pH-impedance monitoring with the detection of weakly acidic 
reflux episodes.78 This requires manual analysis, as automated 
analysis significantly overdetects weakly acidic reflux episodes 
and inaccurately reports association with non-acid reflux events 
in nearly 20% of cases.61 However, ‘rapid’ visual analysis limited 
to the 2min window preceding each symptom event yields 
SI and SAP values concordant with a full visual analysis, with 
excellent intraobserver and interobserver agreement.79 Although 
pH-impedance monitoring provides analysis of symptom-reflux 
association on PPI therapy, testing off PPI therapy increases the 
number of symptoms reported, which increases the chance of a 
positive symptom-reflux association.80
Reflux-symptom association analysis has a high degree of 
reproducibility, the SI being somewhat less reproducible than 
the SAP.81 Monte Carlo simulations have identified limitations of 
reflux-symptom association analysis, especially when acid exposure is low and symptom events are few.82 83 If new methods 
for reflux-symptom association are developed in the future, 
rigorous outcome testing will be needed to define superiority to 
the existing metrics.
Novel metrics
Two novel impedance-detected parameters, the PSPW index and 
baseline impedance have been investigated within GERD phenotypes.84 85 These metrics may augment the diagnostic value of 
impedance-pH testing, especially in discriminating patients with 
GERD from those with functional heartburn.86–88 In health, reflux 
episodes trigger primary peristalsis to neutralise acidified oesophageal mucosa with saliva. This is evident as the antegrade progression of impedance decline within 30s of a reflux episode (PSPW) 
on a pH-impedance study.87 The PSPW index, which currently 
requires cumbersome manual calculation as it is not programmed 
into the analysis software, consists of the proportion of reflux 
episodes on pH-impedance monitoring followed by a PSPW. The 
PSPW index reflects the integrity of primary peristalsis stimulated 
by reflux episodes, correlates with contraction reserve assessed 
using multiple rapid swallows (MRS)89 and has excellent performance characteristics in differentiating erosive oesophagitis and 
pathological acid exposure from functional heartburn and controls 
(sensitivity 99%–100%, specificity 92%).87 90
Baseline impedance values reflect the permeability of the 
oesophageal mucosa, both in animal models and healthy volunteers, with lower values found in erosive and non-erosive 
GERD.91 92 Low baseline oesophageal mucosal impedance has 
been linked to alteration in intercellular space and tight junctions93 94 and to reflux symptoms.95 Since frequent swallows and 
reflux events impact measurement, baseline impedance is best 
measured from pH-impedance tracings during sleep, termed 
mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) when averaged 
from three 10min periods spaced an hour apart.84 MNBI is 
lower in persisting erosive oesophagitis compared with healed

oesophagitis,96 in PPI-responsive NERD and chronic cough 
compared with PPI-refractory states,84 97 and in erosive oesophagitis, NERD and reflux hypersensitivity compared with functional heartburn and healthy controls.86 87 93 Low MNBI (<2292 
ohms) independently predicts response to antireflux therapy,98
links PPI responsive heartburn to reflux better than AET90 and 
improves with healing oesophagitis.99 100
Baseline impedance can also be directly measured from the 
oesophageal mucosa. Initially, this was done using probes with 
impedance sensors that were passed through the endoscope. 
Subsequently, the design has improved using two radial sensors 
mounted on a 10cm balloon that is inflated to insure optimal 
contact with a long segment of oesophageal mucosa. Baseline 
mucosal impedance values correlate with oesophageal mucosal 
inflammation, differentiating erosive and non-erosive GERD 
from eosinophilic oesophagitis and normal patients with better 
specificity (95% vs 64%) and positive predictive value (96% vs 
40%) compared with pH monitoring.101–103 Similar to baseline 
impedance from pH-impedance monitoring, values normalise 
following PPI therapy. Although normative values are not yet 
available, ongoing studies should clarify the role of mucosal 
impedance measurements in GERD management.
Oesophageal high-resolution manometry
A common indication for high-resolution manometry (HRM) is 
to accurately place pH or pH-impedance catheters. HRM is also 
used to assess peristalsis and to detect alternative major motor 
disorders prior to ARS or when symptoms do not improve with 
GERD therapy. Consequently, HRM studies are often performed 
in the setting of GERD. Nonetheless, although fundamental to 
GERD pathophysiology, a pathophysiological classification of 
motor findings in GERD was only recently described.7
EGJ barrier function
The most fundamental abnormality in GERD is incompetence of 
the EGJ as an antireflux barrier, making quantifying EGJ competence an attractive biomarker. However, the EGJ is a complex 
sphincter composed of both the crural diaphragm (CD) and 
lower oesophageal sphincter (LES), the relative dominance of 
which varies with circumstance. The EGJ pressure varies with 
time, respiration and swallowing;, similarly the EGJ morphology 
can also vary over time, transitioning between superimposed and 
separated CD and LES elements.104 Furthermore, some degree of 
EGJ incompetence is physiological, evident by the phenomenon 
of transient LES relaxation (TLESR), reflex relaxation of both 
Figure 1 Oesophagogastric junction morphology as depicted in HRM. With type 1 morphology the crural diaphragm (CD) component, evident 
during inspiration (I), is completely superimposed of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) component such that the magnitude of the actual LES 
pressure is not discernible. With type 2 morphology, there is partial separation of the LES and CD constituents, but the respiratory inversion point 
(RIP) remains at the level of the CD, evident by the decrease observed in the LES pressure band during inspiration. Other characteristics of type 2 
morphology are that the LES-CD separation is <3 cm and that the pressure trough between the LES and CD is greater than intragastric pressure. With 
type 3 morphology, there is ≥3 cm separation between the LES and CD and the pressure trough between the two is equal to intragastric pressure 
during expiration (E). However, the RIP remains at the level of the CD in type 3a and elevated to the level of the LES pressure band with type 3b. This 
is evident by the decreases in LES pressure during inspiration in type 3a and increases in LES pressure during inspiration in type 3b.

the LES and CD that facilitates gas venting from the stomach.105
Clearly, there are challenges to quantifying EGJ barrier function.
No single HRM metric adequately summarises EGJ competence. Hence, the Lyon Consensus proposes adopting two metrics, 
one expressing the anatomical morphology of the EGJ and the 
second summarising its contractile vigour. EGJ morphology, 
defined by the relationship between the LES and CD, has been 
characterised into three subtypes on HRM106 107: type 1 with 
superimposed LES and CD, type 2 with axially separated LES and 
CD pressure signals separated by <3cm and type 3 with a ≥3cm
separation between the LES and CD pressure signatures (figure 1). 
Type 3 EGJ morphology is associated with reduced LES pressure 
and lower inspiratory augmentation, which correlates with reflux 
severity.106 108 109 However, this relationship is not linear and there 
are clear exceptions.
The second HRM metric to quantify EGJ barrier function is 
the EGJ contractile integral (EGJ-CI) (figure 2). The EGJ-CI is 
calculated using methodology analogous to that for calculating the 
distal contractile integral (DCI) with the DCI box set to encompass 
the LES and CD over a period of three respiratory cycles above a 
threshold of gastric pressure. The calculated ‘DCI’ is then divided 
by the duration of the three respiratory cycles to make it independent of time and expressed in units of mm Hg·cm.110 Several 
groups of investigators have subsequently tested the performance of 
the EGJ-CI in segregating GERD populations (table 1),110–114 with 
general agreement that this metric identifies a subset of patients 
with severe barrier dysfunction prone to either endoscopic oesophagitis or unequivocally abnormal reflux testing. However, it is also 
evident from the spread of normal ranges reported among these 
studies that there are likely methodological discrepancies in exactly 
how the EGJ-CI is calculated. In view of this, the Lyon Consensus 
concluded that the EGJ-CI is a promising metric, but needs further 
research before widespread adoption. In an attempt to standardise 
methodology among groups, they recommended exclusion of CD 
component of the EGJ in instances of type 3 EGJ morphology and 
calculation of EGJ-CI above the gastric baseline pressure.
Further insight into the genesis of the EGJ-CI has been gleaned 
through studies using three-dimensional (3D)-HRM.115 Isolation 
of the CD component of the composite EGJ signal on 3D-HRM 
concluded that approximately 85% of overall EGJ contractility 
was attributable to the CD.116 Furthermore, analysis of 3D-HRM 
recordings differentiating the CD and LES constituents of the 
EGJ pressure complex demonstrated that the CD component 
correlated strongly with the EGJ-CI, suggesting that both are 
largely determined by CD contractility.117 Together, these studies 
provide physiological support for adopting the EGJ-CI as a good 
summary metric of EGJ barrier function, although with the 
caveat that the metric is largely an indicator of CD contractility.
Oesophageal peristaltic function
Oesophageal peristalsis can be characterised by the DCI which 
summarises the vigour of post-transition zone contraction 
(figure 2).107 A DCI threshold of 450mm Hg·cm·s correlates 
with an averaged distal peristaltic amplitude of 30mm Hg118, 
Figure 2 High-resolution manometry metrics used in the motor classification of GERD. The oesophagogastric junction contractile integral (EGJ-CI) 
measures vigour of the EGJ barrier using a software tool that encompasses length and vigour of the EGJ above the gastric baseline. The measurement 
is made over three respiratory cycles during quiet rest, and corrected for duration of respiration. The distal contractile integral (DCI) measures vigour 
of smooth muscle contraction taking length, duration and amplitude of contraction into consideration. Following a series of repetitive swallows 
(multiple rapid swallows (MRS)), DCI augments higher than mean DCI from single swallows when there is contraction reserve.

the original manometric threshold defining ineffective swallows. When abnormal, oesophageal peristalsis is often weak in 
GERD,119–121 with poor and/or delayed formation of post-transition zone contraction segment.122 This can result in major 
breaks (>5cm) in the peristaltic contour even when contraction 
vigour is preserved, a condition termed fragmented peristalsis 
when ≥50% of test swallows demonstrate this finding.107
Peristaltic dysfunction becomes progressively more common 
going from NERD to erosive oesophagitis, to Barrett’s oesophagus.123 124 High proportions of ineffective contractions increase 
the likelihood of abnormal AET, particularly while supine,125
and increase the likelihood of reflux symptoms.126 The Chicago 
Classification defines ineffective oesophageal motility (IEM) 
as ≥50% of test swallows with DCI <450mm Hg·cm·s, inclusive of any combination of weak (DCI 100–450mm Hg·cm·s) or 
failed (DCI <100mm Hg·cm·s) sequences.107 Failed sequences 
are more predictive of an abnormal AET than a similar proportion of weak sequences.127 The greatest reflux burden is seen 
with absent contractility (100% of test swallows with DCI 
<100mm Hg·cm·s).128
Provocative tests
The physiological phenomenon of deglutitive inhibition is more 
pronounced with multiple swallows in rapid succession such 
that the oesophagus remains in inhibition until after the final 
swallow, which is then followed by a peristaltic contraction.129
MRS and rapid drink challenge (RDC) are two provocative tests 
of the integrity of deglutitive inhibition during HRM.130 With 
MRS, five 2mL swallows are taken <4s apart and with RDC 
200mL of water is swallowed within 30s. The Lyon Consensus 
proposes that every HRM study should be accompanied by at 
least one of these provocative tests.
Post-MRS contractions are an indicator of ‘contraction 
reserve’ in the oesophagus, the phenomenon wherein the 
post-MRS contraction has greater DCI than the preceding test 
swallows (figure 2).131 Recent data suggest three MRS sequences 
for reliable assessment of contraction reserve.132 The absence 
of contraction reserve in IEM is predictive of the poor efficacy 
of promotility drugs,133 higher AET in NERD,89 outlet obstruction and subsequent benefit from dilation following ARS134 135
and persistence or development of IEM after ARS.136 Absent 
contraction reserve is also the most common manometric finding 
in systemic sclerosis.137 The Lyon Consensus accepted the value 
of adopting MRS into HRM protocols for determining contraction reserve in IEM or absent contractility,107 acknowledging 
that MRS is the most widely studied provocative test,131 135 138
provides a computationally simple endpoint (peristaltic augmentation ratio: post-MRS vs pre-MRS)137 and is quick and easy to 
perform.
In contrast to MRS, the most important clinical application 
of RDC is in distinguishing EGJ obstruction from achalasia, by 
identifying LES relaxation in the former, and an exaggerated 
pressure gradient across a non-relaxed EGJ in the latter.139–141
Therefore, RDC is most helpful in detecting panoesophageal 
pressurisation in achalasia, identifying increased resistance to 
EGJ outflow and uncovering latent hypercontractility.139 Additionally, RDC may offer supportive evidence for erosive GERD; 
effective post-RDC peristalsis was seen in 83% of healthy 
controls compared with 70% of patients with NERD and only 
30% of patients with erosive oesophagitis.142 Solid test meals 
have also been used as provocative tests during HRM, mainly 
in evaluating transit symptoms.142–145 Normal values of oesophageal pressure responses to RDC and solid meals have been 
recently reported in normal healthy volunteers.145 146
HRM studies performed during the postprandial period could be 
of interest for identification of pathophysiological mechanisms in 
GERD,147 148 particularly reflux episodes that tend to be postprandial. A reflux episode may occur during a TLESR, from low LES 
pressure, or in conjunction with rumination (increased gastric pressure with or without decreased thoracic pressure) or supragastric

Table 3 Comparison of the Porto and the Lyon Consensus conclusions
Porto Consensus Lyon Consensus
No discussion of endoscopy Conclusive endoscopic criteria for GERD
► LA grade C or D oesophagitis;
► Biopsy-proven Barrett’s oesophagus;
► Peptic stricture.
Oesophageal impedance monitoring is the only recording method that can 
achieve high sensitivity for detection of all types of reflux episodes while pH 
monitoring is required for characterisation of reflux acidity. However, the role 
of impedance monitoring in the management of patients with GERD still needs 
to be defined.
pH-impedance monitoring is the gold standard for detection and characterisation of reflux 
episodes but is expensive, not widely available and interpretation is time consuming.
When reflux monitoring is indicated on PPI, pH-impedance should be performed.
When reflux monitoring is indicated off PPI, the choice between catheter-based pH-monitoring, 
wireless pH monitoring and pH-impedance monitoring is dependent on cost and availability.
No discussion of the conditions (off or on PPI) to perform reflux testing Reflux monitoring is recommended off PPI in instances of ‘unproven’ GERD and on PPI in 
instances of ‘proven GERD’ (previous LA grade C or D oesophagitis, biopsy-proven Barrett’s 
oesophagus, peptic stricture or AET off PPI >6%).
No discussion of normal values An AET <4%is normal and an AET >6%is abnormal (whatever the type of reflux monitoring and 
whether the study was performed off or on PPI).
No discussion of normal values Reflux episodes >80/24 hours is abnormal and <40 is physiological on pH-impedance performed 
off or on PPI. Number of reflux episodes is an adjunctive metric to be used when AET is borderline 
or inconclusive.
Basal intraluminal impedance is abnormally low in patients with oesophageal 
mucosal abnormalities such as Barrett’s oesophagus or oesophagitis.
Measurement of baseline mucosal impedance (using either through the scope device or MNBI 
during ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring) is an adjunctive metric for the diagnosis of GERD.
No discussion of reflux-symptom association A combination of a positive SI and positive SAP provides the best evidence of clinically relevant 
association between reflux episodes and symptoms.
Using manometry, common cavities occur during a higher proportion of reflux 
episodes in neonates and infants than in adults.
No discussion of oesophageal motor function in GERD
Oesophageal high-resolution manometry is not useful for the direct diagnosis of GERD but can 
provide adjunctive information:
► to assess EGJ barrier function including its morphology (type I to III) and its vigour (using 
EGJ-CI);
► to evaluate oesophageal body motor function (intact, ineffective, fragmented or absent 
contractility) that correlates with oesophageal reflux burden;
► adjunctive tests should be included in the HRM protocol;
► to evaluate the contractile response (multiple rapid swallow);
► to evaluate EGJ obstruction (rapid drink challenge test).
Bilitec is a monitoring system that can detect duodeno-gastro-oesophageal 
reflux by using the optical properties of bilirubin.
Bilitec is no longer considered a reliable diagnostic tool for GERD and was not discussed.

belching (air swallowing to initiate belching).147 Postprandial HRM 
has also been used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs targeted to 
TLESRs, rumination and supragastric belching.149 150 However, 
several limitations exist, including lack of normative postprandial 
HRM data, difficulties with standardisation of the test meal and 
unclear optimal duration of the recording period.
Classification of motility findings in GERD
The most common motility pattern in GERD is a normal study. 
However, either the EGJ or the oesophageal body, or both can be 
abnormal. The EGJ can be hypotensive, with or without a hiatus 
hernia. Peristalsis can be fragmented, ineffective or absent, with 
or without contraction reserve. The Lyon Consensus endorses the 
hierarchical classification of motility findings in GERD first evaluating EGJ morphology and function with LES-CD separation 
and the EGJ-CI, second characterising the integrity of peristalsis 
as normal, weak, fragmented or absent and third, evaluating for 
contraction reserve7
 (table 2). This classification is intended to 
be used in conjunction with the Chicago Classification.
Advances since the Porto Consensus
The Lyon Consensus builds on the Porto Consensus of 2002,45
providing recommendations for the use and interpretation of reflux 
testing techniques in 2018 including oesophageal HRM and baseline impedance measurement that were not widely available in 2002 
(table 3). The primary indication for reflux testing is in distinguishing 
among patients with pathological reflux burden, reflux-mediated 
hypersensitivity and functional syndromes (table 4).151 The Lyon 
Consensus attempts to augment this approach by stratifying the 
significance of findings into those that are conclusive of pathological GERD, as opposed to suggestive of the diagnosis (figure 3). The 
Lyon Consensus also proposes the concept of ‘borderline’ or inconclusive evidence when additional evidence can sway the final judgement towards or away from GERD. This is an area where novel 
metrics and diagnostic techniques may prove helpful. Conditions 
that can mimic GERD, such as achalasia, supragastric belching and 
rumination syndrome need to be excluded with appropriate testing.
Optimisation of GERD testing
GERD symptoms are diverse, response to treatment is variable, 
pathogenesis is heterogeneous and mechanistic phenotypes are 
heavily influenced by hypersensitivity and hypervigilance. Because 
simple algorithms starting with a PPI trial do not consider these 
complex phenotypes of GERD, they often lead to inappropriate PPI 
utilisation, delayed diagnosis and inaccurate diagnoses.152 The Lyon 
Consensus opines that the optimal initial testing for PPI non-responders with no prior endoscopic or pH-metry demonstration 
of GERD is pH or pH-impedance monitoring done withholding 
antisecretory therapy. A key potential outcome of that testing is to 
rule out GERD and to redirect management towards weaning off 
PPIs, using neuromodulators and/or cognitive behavioural therapy 
as appropriate. In contrast, optimal testing in poorly responsive 
patients with a prior demonstration of GERD is the combination 
of EGD, HRM and pH-impedance monitoring done on twice-daily 
PPI therapy. This combination of tests serves both to redirect therapy 
towards alternative diagnoses and to mechanistically subtype 
patients in terms of poor clearance, excessive reflux episodes and 
hypersensitivity (table 4), each of which can trigger specific management options. The precise roles of baseline impedance, PSPW index 
and provocative manoeuvres on HRM remain to be clarified with 
future research.
Outcome measures in GERD
The optimal use of diagnostic testing may translate into better therapeutic outcomes, but appropriate outcome measures are necessary to properly evaluate that improvement. Oesophagitis healing 
is a common measure for therapeutic trials, but visible oesophagitis is rare in patients with refractory GERD symptoms,24 and 
the objective of the evaluation is to determine if refractory symptoms are attributable to GERD or not. Hence, potentially relevant 
Figure 3 Interpretation of oesophageal test results in the context of GERD. Any one conclusive finding provides strong evidence for the presence 
of GERD. While a normal EGD does not exclude GERD on its own, this provides strong evidence against GERD when combined with AET <4%and 
<40 reflux episodes on pH-impedance monitoring off proton pump inhibitor therapy. When evidence is inconclusive or borderline, adjunctive or 
supportive findings can add confidence to the presence or absence of GERD. Histopathology as an adjunctive measure requires a dedicated scoring 
system (incorporating papillary elongation, basal cell hyperplasia, DIS, intraepithelial inflammatory cells, necrosis and erosions) or evidence of DIS 
on electron microscopy. However, adjunctive findings, particularly histopathology and motor findings in isolation, are not enough to diagnose GERD.

outcome measures are symptom description,153 symptom questionnaires,154 pictograms with visual depictions of symptoms155 156
and ambulatory reflux monitoring with analysis of reflux-symptom 
association.74 157 Outcome measures typically used in GERD therapeutic trials have included individual symptom assessment with 
Likert or visual analogue scales,158 global outcome evaluations 
on Likert scales,159 adequate versus inadequate relief, disease-specific questionnaires160 and quality of life questionnaires. Looking 
to the future, regulatory agencies have stipulated that validated 
patient-reported outcome questionnaires (PROs) and quality of life 
questionnaires will be requisite in future therapeutic trials. Such 
PROs require a fastidious approach that includes item generation, 
testing for reliability, responsiveness, validity and interpretability 
and finally, cross-cultural adaptation when applicable, for each 
diagnostic category.161
Conclusions and future direction
GERD is a complex disease with a heterogeneous symptom 
profile and a multifaceted pathogenic basis that defies a simple 
diagnostic algorithm or categorical classification. The Lyon 
Consensus defines parameters on oesophageal testing that 
conclusively establish the presence of GERD and characteristics 
that rule out GERD. Additional evidence from reflux-symptom 
association, motor findings on HRM, novel metrics from 
pH-impedance monitoring, baseline mucosal impedance and 
PPI response complement oesophageal testing when pH-metry is 
borderline or inconclusive. While acknowledging the limitations 
of currently available oesophageal testing in GERD, the Lyon 
Consensus proposes this model as a guide to direct management.
The future approach to phenotyping patients with GERD 
should focus on assessing important physiological biomarkers 
and PROs to categorise patients based on the severity of 
refluxate exposure, mechanism of reflux, effectors of clearance 
and underlying EGJ pathophysiology (table 4), while recognising 
that no single approach is perfect. Novel metrics assessing tissue 
resistance, oesophageal clearance, peripheral and central neural 
integration and psychometrics will allow for a tailored therapeutic approach including pharmacological treatments, surgical/
endoscopic interventions and behavioural strategies targeting 
the underlying defect(s) in the antireflux barrier, oesophageal 
clearance, visceral sensitivity and cognitive response to reflux. As 
newer metrics emerge, the Lyon Consensus plans future meetings to update and adapt the consensus conclusions. Collaboration between high volume medical centres involved in GERD 
testing has opened possibilities for more robust normative data 
and for validation of conclusions and recommendations from 
the Lyon Consensus. As the GERD diagnostic paradigm evolves, 
using diagnostic testing to define a precision approach tailored 
to the individual patient becomes possible. The goals of evaluation should therefore transition towards defining GERD phenotypes to facilitate tailored treatment.
