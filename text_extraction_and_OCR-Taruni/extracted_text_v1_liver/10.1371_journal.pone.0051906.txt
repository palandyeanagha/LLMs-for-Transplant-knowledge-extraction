Abstract
Background and Aims: Chronic liver diseases are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic liver injuries that often result in
liver cirrhosis with its associated complications such as portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy still
represents the reference standard for fibrosis staging, although transient elastography is increasingly used for non-invasive
monitoring of fibrosis progression. However, this method is not generally available and is associated with technical
limitations emphasizing the need for serological biomarkers staging of liver fibrosis. The enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score
was shown to accurately predict significant liver fibrosis in different liver diseases, although extracellular matrix components
detected by this score may not only mirror the extent of liver fibrosis but also inflammatory processes.
Methods: In this prospective biopsy-controlled study we evaluated the utility of the ELF score in comparison to transient
elastography to predict different stages of fibrosis in 102 patients with chronic liver diseases.
Results: Both techniques revealed similar area under receiver operating characteristic curve values for prediction of
advanced fibrosis stages. Compared to transient elastography, the ELF score showed a broader overlap between low and
moderate fibrosis stages and a stronger correlation with inflammatory liver injury.
Conclusions: Both the ELF score as well as transient elastography allowed for high quality fibrosis staging. However, the ELF
score was less discriminative in low and moderate fibrosis stages and appeared more strongly influenced by inflammatory
liver injury. This should be considered when making clinical interpretations on the basis of ELF score values.

Introduction
Liver fibrosis is the consequence of a variety of chronic liver
diseases and can result in liver cirrhosis. Early detection of fibrosis
progression and development of cirrhosis are crucial for management of patients with chronic liver diseases since advanced fibrosis is
associated with clinical complications and formation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although liver biopsy remains the reference
standard for evaluating liver fibrosis, it is limited by sampling errors
and risk of complications [1,2]. In addition to sampling errors, intraand interobserver variability may lead to misinterpretation of the
fibrosis stage [3–6]. One reason for the difficulties in correctly
assessing the fibrosis stages might base on biopsy specimen that only
represents 1/50.000 of the total liver mass [1].
The liver volume explored by transient elastography is
estimated to be 100 times larger compared to liver biopsy and
might thus be more representative of the entire organ [7]. Fibrosis
is a dynamic process and monitoring of fibrosis is desirable to
obtain information not only about disease progression but also
about treatment efficacy. Much attention has therefore been
focused on the development of non-invasive methods to detect
liver fibrosis. Measurement of liver stiffness by transient elastography is a widely accepted method for non-invasive liver disease
staging. However, this technique is cost-intensive and its
availability is largely limited to liver centers. Moreover, liver
stiffness measurements can be difficult or impossible in obese
patients, in those with narrow intercostal space or in patients with
ascites [8] and a failure rate up to 18.9% has been reported

following a review of 13,369 examinations over a 5-year period
[9]. Substantial effort has been devoted to develop routine
laboratory tests for fibrosis assessment, including the FibroTestH,
HepascoreH and markers of extracellular matrix components or
enzymes involved in their degradation or synthesis [10–15]. The
combination of some of those parameters, such as hyaluronic acid
(HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and
aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type III (PIIINP), has
been recently proposed for fibrosis detection [16,17]. A simplified
version of this panel – called enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) scorewas shown to accurately predict significant liver fibrosis in different
liver diseases [11,18–21].
Extracellular matrix components may not only mirror the
extent of liver fibrosis but are also involved in inflammatory
processes. For instance, direct immunological impact of HA by
regulating inflammatory cell recruitment and release of inflammatory cytokines has been described [22]. Vice versa, a variety of
cytokines play a role in activating hepatic stellate cells for
extracellular matrix production [23–25]. Moreover, hepatocyte
apoptosis, which plays a role in inflammatory liver injury, has been
mechanistically linked to stellate cell activation and increased
fibrogenesis [26]. Activated hepatic stellate cells not only regulate
fibrosis by secretion of extracellular matrix components but also
induce an inflammatory response by expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptors [27,28]. Thus, multiple pathways of
interaction between extracellular matrix production and inflammatory responses exist.
In the present study we have evaluated the performance of the
ELF test against transient elastography for non-invasive assessment
of fibrosis in a prospective biopsy-controlled manner. In this
context we have analyzed the influence of possible confounders,
such as liver inflammation or steatosis, on fibrosis detection by
ELF score and transient elastography.
Methods
Patient Characteristics and Analysis of Liver Fibrosis
We investigated sera from 102 patients (52% male, age 18–75
years, mean 46.661.3 years) with chronic liver diseases (viral
hepatitis, n = 55; autoimmune hepatitis, n = 7; Wilson’s diseases,
n = 4; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, n = 22; unknown origin,
n = 14). Serum samples were analyzed for markers of the ELF
score, including tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1
(TIMP-1), hyaluronic acid (HA), and amino-terminal propeptide
of type III collagen (PIIINP). The proprietary assays developed
for the ELF test by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.
(Tarrytown, New York, USA) were used and analyses were
performed on an Immuno-1 auto-analyser (Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, New York, USA). Results were
entered into the established algorithm and expressed as score as
described.16 In addition to the ELF score alanine and aspartate
aminotransferase (ALT, AST) levels were determined. At the
time of blood withdrawal, all patients obtained liver biopsy and
liver stiffness measurement using the Fibroscan (Echosens, Paris,
France). The fibrosis stage (F1–F6) was determined according to
Ishak et al. [29]. The percentage of liver steatosis was assessed
by the same pathologist. Patients were divided in low (F0-1;
n = 68), moderate (F2-4; n = 23) and severe fibrosis (F5-6;
n = 11). Demographic and clinical features of the patients are
shown in Table 1. No significant differences in ALT levels,
percentage of steatosis and body mass index (BMI) were
observed between the different fibrosis groups. All liver stiffness
(LS) measurements were performed by a single experienced
investigator (M.D.) as described [8]. The result of liver stiffness
determination was expressed in kPa and was the median of at
least 10 individual measurements with a success rate of .60%.
Valid LS values were obtained for all patients included in this
study. Written consent was obtained from the patients
participating in this study, and the consent procedure and
study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hannover
Medical School.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed by using Graphpad Prism
5.0 and SPSS 19.0 software and confirmed by a professional
statistician. Data are presented as box plot and whiskers analysis as
well as mean 6 standard error of the mean (SEM). The results
obtained with the different serum markers or liver stiffness
measurements were compared using the Mann-Whitney’s U test.
Regression analyses were performed to calculate the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient. Receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) analysis was calculated. A P value ,0.05 was considered
significant. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in order to adjust for variables found to be associated with
fibrosis.
Results
Non-Invasive Assessment of Fibrosis Stages in Chronic
Liver Diseases by ELF Test and Transient Elastography
The ELF test was compared with transient elastography for
detection of different fibrosis stages in patients with chronic liver
diseases (n = 102). Transient elastography allowed a better discrimination between low (F0-1; mean liver stiffness (LS)
6.960.4 kPa) and moderate (F2-4; mean LS 11.761.6 kPa) and
between moderate and high fibrosis stages (F5-6; mean LS
27.364.8; Figure 1A) compared to the ELF score (F0-1: mean
8.660.1; F2-4: mean 9.360.3 and F5-6:11.060.3; Figure 1B).
Although both noninvasive methods could significantly discriminate between the different fibrosis stages, transient elastography
revealed a higher significance (p,0.001) to distinguish between
low and moderate fibrosis stages compared to the ELF score
(p,0.05). Accordingly, the ELF score showed a broad overlapping
range of F0-1 (6.3–11.2) and F2-4 (7.6–12.9) which was not
observed for transient elastography (F0-1:3.2–16.3 kPa and F2-
4:4.0–43 kPa). In line with this observation, regression analyses
showed a significant correlation between transient elastography or
ELF score and ISHAK fibrosis stages as well as between transient
elastography and ELF score (Table 2).

Predictive Value of the ELF Score and Transient
Elastography to Detect Clinically Relevant or Progressed
Fibrosis Stages
We then calculated the cut-off values of the ELF Score and
transient elastography to correctly predict clinically relevant stages
of fibrosis ($F2) or progressed fibrosis/cirrhosis ($F5) with the
best compromise sensitivity/specificity. To this end, we performed
a ROC plot analysis including all patients (n = 102) with different
fibrosis stages. The cut-off value of transient elastography of
8.5 kPa correctly predicted fibrosis stages of $F2 with a sensitivity
of 86% and a specificity of 73% (AUC 0.92, confidence interval
(CI) 95%: 0.85–0.98; Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained
for the ELF score with a cut-off value of 8.99 that predicts
clinically relevant fibrosis stages with a sensitivity of 86% and
a specificity of 70% (AUC 0.87; CI95%: 0.78–0.96; Figure 2B).
Compared to transient elastography that revealed with a cut-off
value of 17.45 kPa a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 100%
(AUC 0.95; CI95%: 0.87–1.0) for prediction of fibrosis stages of
$F5 (Figure 2C), the ELF score showed a cut-off value (9.39)
with higher sensitivity (100%) but lower specificity (77%; AUC
0.93; CI95%: 0.88–0.99; Figure 2D) for detection of progressed
fibrosis/cirrhosis. However, the cut-off value of the ELF score to
predict $F2 (8.99) was close to the cut-off value to predict $F5
(9.39). In contrast, the cut-off values of transient elastography for
prediction of $F2 or $F5 fibrosis stages showed higher
differences.
Influence of Liver Inflammation on Transient
Elastography and ELF Score
To analyze a potential influence of liver inflammation on ELF
score and transient elastography, we performed regression
analyses comparing ALT or AST levels with ELF score and
transient elastography. Both methods of fibrosis detection significantly correlated with AST and ALT levels (Figure 3). The ELF
score showed a higher correlation with aminotransferase levels
compared to transient elastography (Table 3). Similarly, the ELF
score revealed a significantly higher correlation with inflammatory
liver injury (ISHAK A-D) compared to transient elastography
(Table 3). Thus, these data imply that the ELF score is more
strongly influenced by inflammatory disease activity compared to
transient elastography. In contrast to the ELF score, liver stiffness
showed a weak but significant correlation with the percentage of
liver steatosis (Table 3). To analyze the influence of inflammation
or steatosis on prediction of relevant ($F2) or progressed ($F5)
fibrosis stages, we performed a multivariate logistic regression
analysis. This analysis showed that neither transient elastography
nor the ELF score were significantly influenced by steatosis or
inflammation (ISHAK A-D or ALT levels) in prediction of
relevant or progressed fibrosis stages.
Discussion
Chronic liver diseases represent a substantial public health
problem with a worldwide mortality of around 800.000 deaths per
year [30]. A common pathological feature of chronic liver disease
is fibrosis which is characterized by the progressive development of
collagen-rich extracellular matrix and decreased matrix degradation due to an increase of inhibitors of matrix degradating
enzymes, e.g. TIMPs [31]. Progression of liver fibrosis can result in
liver cirrhosis with clinical complications due to loss of liver

function and portal hytertension. Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis are
also considered a pre-cancerous state that provides a microenvironment which allows for the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma. Thus, screening for fibrosis progression with noninvasive methods in everyday general practice is required to
identify patients with increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis
and associated complications. Vice versa, there is increasing
evidence indicating that successful treatment of various chronic
liver diseases is associated with fibrosis regression [32]. Moreover,
novel antifibrotic agents targeting different factors of fibrogenesis
revealed promissing results in animal models [33]. Monitoring of
fibrosis regression during therapy of chronic liver diseases might be
therefore also important for evaluation of treatment efficacy.
Ideally, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis should be liverspecific and easy to perform with high diagnostic performance
(compromise sensitivity/specificity) for accurate fibrosis staging.
Among the most studied non-invasive detection methods of liver
fibrosis is transient elastography. A prospective study in patients
with chronic liver diseases demonstrated that measurement of liver
stiffness by transient elastography is a reliable method to predict
moderate or severe fibrosis stages, but shows less accuracay to
differentiate between lower fibrosis stages according to METAVIR
[7,34], which was in line with observations of other studies [35–
37]. In our prospective study of patients with chronic liver diseases,
transient elastography was able to significantly (p,0.01) discriminate not only between moderate and high but also between low
and moderate fibrosis stages according to Ishak classification [29].
Differences in the applied fibrosis scores as well as interobserver
variability might account for the lower overlapping range between
minimal and moderate fibrosis stages observed in the present
compared to the latter studies. Indeed, interobserver agreement
for transient elastography was found to be significantly reduced in
patients with lower degrees of hepatic fibrosis [38,39].
Compared to transient elastography, the ELF score revealed
a lower significance (p,0.05) for discrimination between low and
moderate fibrosis stages and showed a broad overlapping range for
those stages. Nevertheless, AUC values for prediction of relevant
fibrosis ($F2) are high for both non-invasive methods with similar
sensitivity and specificity. Both transient elastopgraphy and ELF
score showed also a comparable high diagnostic accuracy to
predict progressed fibrosis/cirrhosis ($F5). The cut off-value of
transient elastography for prediction of progressed fibrosis

evaluated in this study was nearly the same (17.5 kPa) compared to
that (17.6 kPa) of a previous study [7]. However, transient
elastography showed a lower sensitivity for detection of fibrosis
$F5 compared to the ELF score.
A recent study showed lower diagnostic performance for
transient elastography in detection of liver cirrhosis compared to
lower fibrosis stages [40]. One explanation for this observation
could be that liver stiffness measurement topographically reflects
liver architecture which is characterized by fibrotic septa and
regenerative nodules in cirrhosis. Moreover, the architecture of
liver cirrhosis shows differences between various liver diseases
which might influence the sensitivity of cirrhosis detection by
transient elastography. In contrast to transient elastography, the
ELF score showed a lower specificity to predict progressed fibrosis.
In this context it is interesting to note that the ELF score showed
a higher correlation with ALT levels and with histological
inflammatory liver injury compared to transient elastography.
Thus, inflammatory disease activity might account for the lower
specificity to detect progressed fibrosis by the ELF score. This
might also be the reason for the lower performance of the ELF
score compared to transient elastography in prediction of
advanced fibrosis which has been recently demonstrated in
patients with chronic hepatitis B [41].
There is also increasing evidence that liver stiffness is influenced
by acute exacerbation of liver disease with ALT flares resulting in
overestimation, e.g. up to three fold increase, of liver stiffness
values [42–44]. Nevertheless, in acute liver failure it has been
observed that liver stiffness correlates with tissue repair, e.g.
markers of fibrogenesis [45]. However, we found a weaker
correlation of transient elastography with ALT values and

histological disease activity compared to the ELF score. This might
be explained by the lack of disease flares with only moderately
increased aminotransferase levels in the present study. In line with
this observation, liver stiffness was not correlated with histological
activity in chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients that usually
do not show ALT flares [35,36]. Instead, we found a weak but
significant correlation of transient elastography with steatosis
which was not observed with the ELF test.
It has been reported that liver stiffness values are higher in
subjects with enhanced BMI or metabolic syndrome [39,46]. A
multivariate analysis in patients with alcoholic liver disease showed
a significant influence of steatosis on liver stiffness measurement
[47]. In contrast, other studies did not reveal an influence of
steatosis on fibrosis stage assessment by transient elastography
[8,36,37]. Further studies are therefore needed to evaluate the
influence of different grades of steatosis on liver stiffness
measurements. A recently performed study comparing ultrasound-based methods with ELF score appeared confirming the
diagnostic accuracy of those non-invasive methods for prediction
of relevant fibrosis or cirrhosis [48]. However, the number of nontransplant patients with chronic liver diseases included in this
study was lower (n = 59) compared to our study (n = 102), and
unfortunately no information about possible variables that might
influence fibrosis such as inflammation or steatosis was provided.
Furthermore, the discriminative power of both methods for lower
fibrosis stages, which is often relevant for clinical decision-making,
remains unclear in this report.
Our present large biopsy-controlled prospective study showed
that the ELF score reveals similar diagnostic accuracy to predict
relevant ($F2) or advanced ($F5) stages of fibrosis compared with
transient elastography. However, the cut-off values of the ELF
score to predict relevant stages of fibrosis are close to the cut-off
value for detection of progressed fibrosis whereas the respective
cut-off values for transient elastography showed a higher difference. The ELF score appears less discriminative in lower fibrosis
stages compared to transient elastography. Furthermore, the ELF
score showed a higher correlation with inflammatory liver injury
compared to transient elastography. These observations should be
considered when making clinical interpretations or decisions on
the base of ELF score values.
