Abstract
The cause of disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia in patients with type II diabetes is controversial. To examine
whether increased b cell demand might contribute, we measured proinsulin and insulin concentrations in clinically
healthy humans who had undergone hemipancreatectomy
for the purpose of organ donation, a procedure previously
demonstrated to increase b cell demand and diminish insulin secretory reserve capacity. Subjects were studied at least
1 yr after hemipancreatectomy. Seven donors were followed
prospectively and served as their own controls. Nine additional donors were matched with normal controls (crosssectional group). Fasting serum concentrations of intact
proinsulin and conversion intermediates (total) were measured by a two-step radioimmunoassay; independent determinations of intact proinsulin and 32,33 split proinsulin were
performed using an immunoradiometric assay. Serum total
proinsulin values were significantly greater in hemipancreatectomized groups than controls (prospective group: predonation 5 6.2461.14 pM, postdonation 5 34.63617.47 pM,
P , 0.005; cross-sectional group: controls 5 5.7861.12 pM,
donors 5 15.2265.20 pM, P , 0.025). The ratio of total proinsulin to immunoreactive insulin was directly correlated
with fasting plasma glucose and showed a significant inverse relationship to secretory reserve capacity. Both absolute and relative hyperproinsulinemia is found in hemipancreatectomized donors. These data demonstrate that partial
pancreatectomy with its associated increase in b cell demand raises measures of proinsulin in humans. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Hyperproinsulinemia may be either absolute, relative, or both.
In simple obesity, there is a proportionate increase in proinsulin, and, therefore, only absolute hyperproinsulinemia is
present (1). In type II diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia,
there is a disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia relative to insulinemia even in lean type II patients without absolute hyperinsulinemia or hyperproinsulinemia (2). Disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia has also been found in women with a
history of gestational diabetes (3) and in the first-degree relatives of patients with type I diabetes (4–7), and it predicts the
transition from impaired glucose tolerance to non–insulindependent diabetes mellitus in Japanese Americans (8). Because each of these groups has diabetes or is at risk for the
development of the disease, disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia has been advanced as an early marker for b cell dysfunction (9). However, the cause of this relative hyperproinsulinemia is unknown. Some investigators believe it arises
from increased demand on the pancreatic b cell and is the result of premature release of immature insulin secretory granules (10), whereas others suggest it occurs as a result of a defect in proinsulin processing in the b cell (9). To investigate the
causes of this type of hyperproinsulinemia, we asked whether
disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia develops in clinically
healthy humans undergoing hemipancreatectomy for the purpose of organ donation. Because human pancreas donors have
reduced glucose- and arginine-induced insulin secretion and
decreased maximum b cell secretory reserve capacity, as measured by glucose potentiation of arginine-induced insulin secretion (11), they experience increased secretory demand on
their b cells after hemipancreatectomy. In this study we hypothesized that enhanced demand would increase serum proinsulin levels disproportionately after hemipancreatectomy.
Methods
Subject recruitment. Subjects were recruited from the University of
Minnesota registry of hemipancreatectomized organ donors who had
given half their pancreas to a diabetic family member with type I diabetes mellitus. The selection criteria for these subjects has previously
been described (12, 13). In brief, all were in good health and had normal fasting glucose and insulin values, normal oral glucose tolerance
tests, and normal insulin-secretory responses to glucose before surgery. Subjects were required to be 10 yr older than the age at which
the proposed recipient developed diabetes mellitus. In all cases,
transplantation was at least 10 yr after diabetes onset in the recipient.
The majority of donors included in this investigation was found to
have HLA haplotypes positive for DR3 and/or DR4, and all have
participated in a larger ongoing study chronicling the metabolic effects of hemipancreatectomy on healthy humans (11, 13, 14). Two
groups of donors were selected for this study. The first, termed the
prospective group, was chosen because of the availability of fasting
serum samples obtained both before and after hemipancreatectomy.
In the second donor group, termed the cross-sectional group, only
postoperative serum samples were available for study. They were sePreliminary reports of these data were presented at the meeting of
the Western Section of the American Federation of Clinical Research, 10–12 February 1994, and at the national meeting of The
American Diabetes Association, 11–14 June 1994.

lected based on the availability of fasting serum samples obtained
from matched control subjects at the same approximate point in time.
Control subjects were originally recruited into the study by advertisement and were matched to the donors with respect to age and body
mass index. No control subject had a first-degree family member with
type I diabetes mellitus. The Committee on the Use of Humans in
Research at the University of Minnesota approved this investigation.
Metabolic tests. Arterialized blood samples were obtained for
glucose, insulin, and proinsulin determinations in the morning after
an overnight fast. Plasma was separated from blood for glucose determinations within 10 min of acquisition. Serum samples for hormones
were allowed to clot for 30 min after collection and were stored at
2208C until assayed. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in
donors before and after surgery as previously described (13). b cell
reserve function was assessed by the method of glucose potentiation
(15, 16) as modified by Seaquist and Robertson (11), by which the
maximal acute insulin response to an intravenous bolus of arginine
(AIRmax)
1
 is determined after infusing sufficient glucose (as 20% dextrose in water) to achieve a serum glucose concentration $ 27 mM.
Assays. Glucose values were measured by an Autoanalyzer
(Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Serum immunoreactive
insulin (IRI) was determined by a modification of the double-antibody method of Morgan and Lazarow (17). In this assay, the insulin
antibody detects proinsulin and its conversion intermediates on an
equimolar basis with insulin. Thus, IRI measurements reflect the total
amount of insulin, intact proinsulin, and proinsulin conversion intermediates present in the specimen. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) of this assay are 8 and 12%, respectively. Intact proinsulin and proinsulin conversion intermediates were
determined by previously described methods (18), whereby serum is
first immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against C-peptide, and quantitation is then obtained by radioimmunoassay of the
resuspended pellet using an antibody directed against insulin. This assay has intra- and interassay CV values of 10 and 14%, respectively.
Since the antibody used in this assay does not discriminate between
intact proinsulin and its conversion intermediates, they are all included in the “proinsulin” measured in this assay. To determine
whether hemipancreatectomy alters the normal sequential processing
of proinsulin (19), samples from six of the prospectively studied
donors were also assayed for 32,33 split proinsulin, proinsulin, and insulin using a two-site immunoradiometric assay. This assay has intraand interassay CVs of , 10 and , 15%, respectively (20). The concentration of 32,33 split proinsulin intermediates detected by this
assay includes des-31,32, and 32,33 split proinsulin (19). Serum concentrations of islet cell antibodies were kindly determined by Dr.
Noel Maclaren using an indirect immunofluorescent assay previously
described (21).
Data analysis. Data are presented as mean6SEM. The proportion of proinsulin that comprised IRI (PI/IRI) was calculated as PI/
IRI 3 100 and is expressed as a percentage. The ratio of proinsulin
secreted to true insulin secreted was calculated as PI/(IRI 2 PI).
AIRmax is the mean of the peak three insulin values measured within
5 min after the administration of arginine at serum glucose $ 27 mM,
with the prestimulus insulin value subtracted. Differences between
groups were determined by nonparametric analysis. A P value , 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Seven hemipancreatectomized human donors were studied
both before and after organ donation (Table I). These subjects
were studied 1865 mo after surgery. Fasting glucose values
were elevated on follow-up in each of the donors as compared
with their predonation value, and three subjects demonstrated
a diabetic response to an oral glucose tolerance test at the time
of the postdonation exam (Table II). None of these subjects
were receiving treatment for diabetes at the time of study. All
five donors studied prospectively by the potentiation protocol
demonstrated a decrease in their AIRmax after hemipancreatectomy. None of these subjects had detectable serum concentrations of islet cell antibodies at the time of their postdonation
study.
Nine additional donors were matched to nine control subjects with respect to age and body mass index (Table I). These
subjects were studied 6068 mo after surgery and had higher
fasting glucoses than did their controls (P , 0.05). Two of
these donor subjects were found to have a diabetic response to
an oral glucose tolerance test at the time of the follow-up investigation, but none were receiving treatment for diabetes at
the time of study (Table II). Donors had a significantly lower
AIRmax than did controls (P , 0.001). Donors did not have detectable serum concentrations of islet cell antibodies at the
time of study.
Proinsulin values were significantly higher in both donor
groups after hemipancreatectomy as compared with their respective controls (Figs. 1 and 2). In those subjects studied prospectively, proinsulin increased from 6.2461.14 pM before donation to 34.63617.47 pM after donation (P , 0.05). In the
cross-sectionally studied group, donors had a proinsulin concentration of 15.2265.20 pM, and controls had a value of
5.7861.12 pM (P , 0.025). Interestingly, the mean proinsulin
value measured in donors before undergoing hemipancreatectomy was not different from that measured in normal controls
(6.2461.14 pM vs 5.7861.12 pM, P 5 NS).
IRI was the same in donor groups and their respective con1. Abbreviations used in this paper: AIRmax, maximal acute insulin response; CV, coefficient of variation; IRI, immunoreactive insulin.

trols (Figs. 1 and 2). The proportion of IRI comprised of proinsulin (PI/IRI) was found to be significantly higher in both donor groups when compared with their respective controls
(Figs. 1 and 2). This proportion increased from 7.861.7% preoperatively to 26.967.5% postoperatively in those donors
studied prospectively (P 5 0.05). Controls in the cross-sectionally studied group had a proportion of 9.762.0%, as compared
with a value of 21.964.1% in donors (P 5 0.01). When the ratio of circulating proinsulin to true insulin is compared, hemipancreatectomized donors also had higher values than did
their controls, although statistical significance was achieved
only in the cross-sectionally examined group. This ratio in
donors before surgery was 0.0960.02, as compared with 0.476
0.17 after donation (P 5 NS). The ratio in cross-sectionally
studied donors was 0.3160.07, as compared with 0.1160.02 in
their controls (P 5 0.01).
A positive significant correlation was found between the
PI/IRI and fasting glucose (r 5 0.54, P , 0.01, Fig. 3). A similar relationship was also found between the PI/IRI and AIRmax
(r 5 0.62, , 0.01, Fig. 4).
Proinsulin measurements made by the two-site immunoradiometric assay yielded similar results to those made by the
two-step assay using an antibody directed against C-peptide.
Six donors were studied prospectively using this two-site assay,
and intact proinsulin values were found to increase significantly after hemipancreatectomy (preoperative value: 3.261.6
pM vs postoperative value of 9.463.7 pM, P 5 0.025). 32,33
split proinsulin also increased after hemipancreatectomy in
these donors (10.066.8 pM before surgery vs 45.4621.7 pM after surgery, P 5 0.05). In addition, the proportion of IRI comprised of proinsulin and 32,33 proinsulin was higher after donation than before (10.161.4% vs 37.2610.8%, n 5 6, P 5
0.05).
Discussion
In our investigation we found that total serum proinsulin, intact proinsulin, 32,33 split proinsulin, and the proportion of
IRI comprised of proinsulin are all increased in human donors
after hemipancreatectomy. These subjects, who were clinically
healthy individuals with normal glucose tolerance and insulin
secretory profiles before organ donation, demonstrated relative hyperglycemia and diminished maximal b cell reserve capacity when compared with matched controls or their own predonation values. Since an increase in b cell demand per cell
would be expected to follow hemipancreatectomy, our data
demonstrate that hyperproinsulinemia is associated with increased b cell demand. These data are the first to document
such an occurrence in hemipancreatectomized humans and
may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of hyperproinsulinemia.
The mechanism responsible for relative hyperproinsulinemia to insulinemia has been the subject of much debate. Originally described in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (22–
24), relative hyperproinsulinemia has been proposed to arise
as a result of an intrinsic b cell defect in insulin processing
present in this disease (9). Supporters of this hypothesis have
suggested that individuals with disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia release greater than normal amounts of proinsulin
from the b cell because of an abnormality in posttranslational
modification of the proinsulin molecule leading to a proinsulin-rich granule. In addition, they propose that hyperproinsulinemia may be a marker for later abnormalities in glucose
tolerance. Supporting this theory are the findings of disproportionate levels of proinsulin in subjects believed to be at risk for
the development of diabetes mellitus, such as women who
have previously experienced gestational diabetes (3), firstdegree family members of individuals with type I diabetes mellitus (4–7), and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance who
progress to type II diabetes (8).
Other investigators have suggested that disproportionate
hyperproinsulinemia occurs as a result of increased demand on
the b cell and the subsequent release of immature insulinsecretory granules (10). Support for this hypothesis comes
from investigations in animals with experimentally produced
hyperglycemia (10, 25) and from human studies in which proinsulin concentrations were measured in first-degree relatives
of patients with type II diabetes and found to be elevated only
in those with hyperglycemia (26). Insulin resistance may also
increase demand on b cells, and absolute proinsulin concentrations have been demonstrated to increase in obesity (1). However, these elevations are proportional to an associated rise in
Figure 3. The ratio of total proinsulin to IRI correlates with fasting 
glucose concentrations. The ratio of total proinsulin to IRI increased 
as a function of fasting glucose concentration in donor (h) and control groups (1).

insulin unless there is hyperglycemia. Some forms of druginduced insulin resistance also produce disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia in humans (27); others do not (28, 29).
In our population, we found the absolute concentration of
intact serum proinsulin, 32,33 split proinsulin, and the ratio of
total proinsulin to IRI were increased in the donor groups
compared with their preoperative control values or with measurements made in age and body mass index–matched controls. Since donors experience a decrease in AIRmax and stimulated insulin secretion after hemipancreatectomy, our data
support the hypothesis that hyperproinsulinemia may be the
result of increased b cell demand in these subjects. However,
because our subjects are at increased genetic risk for the development of type I diabetes, it could also be suggested that hyperproinsulinemia is a marker for early dysfunction caused by
the autoimmune destruction of b cells. Detracting from such a
conclusion is our finding of undetectable concentrations of islet cell antibodies in the serum of hemipancreatectomized donors at the time of study. These observations argue against
isletitis as the cause of the b cell dysfunction and hyperproinsulinemia found in the hemipancreatectomized donors. Furthermore, whereas AIRmax was lower in the prospectively studied donor groups compared with the cross-sectional control
group, the preoperative proinsulin measures were indistinguishable, suggesting that b cell function was normal before
hemipancreatectomy in these first-degree relatives of patients
with type I diabetes. Therefore, our findings of relative hyperproinsulinemia in donors with normal preoperative b cell function and an absence of immunologic evidence of isletitis postoperatively supports the hypothesis that hyperproinsulinemia
developing after hemipancreatectomy is the result of reduced
islet mass and the subsequent increase in b cell demand.
It should be noted that previous investigators have found
disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia in the first-degree relatives of patients with type I diabetes and have used these observations to suggest that this finding may be an early sign of
b cell dysfunction associated with type I diabetes (4–7). Whereas
this conclusion may apply to the observations made in other
groups of relatives of patients with type I diabetes, we do not
believe it is relevant in our subjects, since they were selected
based on variables that correlate with a lower risk for the development of type I diabetes (30) to insure that donors have
normal pancreatic function before surgery. Consequently, they
were older and more distant in age from the age of diabetes
onset of the affected family member than were the family
members included in other investigations of proinsulin in firstdegree relatives of patients with type I diabetes (4–7). However, even though our subjects were at a lower risk to develop
diabetes than the subjects included in other studies and had
normal preoperative b cell function and no postoperative islet
cell antibodies, one-third were found to have a diabetic response on an oral glucose tolerance test at the time of follow-up.
Interestingly, most of these subjects with diabetic glucose tolerance have not developed fasting hyperglycemia, implying
that their defect was mild. Thus, we conclude that absolute and
relative hyperproinsulinemia developed after hemipancreatectomy as a result of the intervention in these subjects, which
produced a reduction in maximal b cell reserve capacity.
In this investigation, we demonstrate the presence of a significant positive relationship between PI/IRI and fasting glucose values, as has been previously been defined in humans (1,
2, 31–33) and rodents (10). Our data also define a significant
relationship between PI/IRI and AIRmax, a measure of maximal pancreatic b cell reserve capacity. We found that humans
with the lowest AIRmax values tended to have the greatest degree of disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia. These data differ from those obtained in two-thirds pancreatectomized dogs,
in which no differences were found in the PI/IRI measured before and after surgical reduction of b cell mass (29). It seems
possible that dogs may have an adaptive response to such surgery. Alternatively, insufficient time may have elapsed after partial pancreatectomy and the development of reduced AIRmax
in the dogs for the effects of increased b cell demand to be expressed as a change in PI/IRI. Ward et al. examined the dogs 1
and 6 wk after surgery (34), whereas the humans in the current
investigation were studied no earlier than 12 mo and up to 96
mo after hemipancreatectomy. Regardless of these observations in canines, our data demonstrate that hyperproinsulinemia is significantly associated with fasting hyperglycemia and
reduced maximal b cell reserve capacity in hemipancreatectomized humans who served as donors to a family member with
type I diabetes.
In conclusion, we have found that relative and absolute hyperproinsulinemia develops in clinically healthy human donors
after hemipancreatectomy. Our observations support the hypothesis that disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia may result
from increased b cell demand in humans.
