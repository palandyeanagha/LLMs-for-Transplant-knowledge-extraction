Purpose: Donors whose diagnosis of death is based upon 
neurologic criteria are the primary source of organs for human 
transplantation. The current measure of effectiveness of organ 
donation programs is the crude statistic, donors per million 
population (DPMP). This statistic represents the number of 
available donors, divided by the potential donor population. 
Comparisons between transplantation programs are done using 
the DPMP statistic. We sought to determine if variance in organ 
donation rates, reported as DPMP could be accounted for by 
differences in population demographics, specifically age and 
gender-specific mortality rates. 
Methods: We obtained the population distribution and deaths 
for the year 2000 for the Calgary Health Region (CHR) and 
the country of Spain. Expected deaths were then calculated by 
standardizing the sample, based upon weighted averages of age, 
gender and cause-specific mortality rates. 
Results: In 2000, Spain reported a crude organ donation rate 
of 33.9 DPMP. Standardizing the observed deaths in Spain 
using the CHR population distribution and calculating expected 
deaths based on the CHR rates, resulted in an adjusted rate of 
19.2 DPMP (P < 0.05). 
Conclusions: These results bring into question the reliability of 
using crude DPMP as a measure of organ and tissue donation 
program performance. Alternative measures of benchmarking 
performance in organ donation programs should be considered.
Objectif : Les donneurs dont la mort est diagnostiquée selon 
des critères neurologiques sont la principale source d’organes 
pour la transplantation chez les humains. La mesure courante de 
l’efficacité des programmes de dons d’organes est la statistique 
brute, les donneurs par million de population (DPMP). Cette 
statistique représente le nombre de donneurs existants divisé 
par la population de donneurs potentiels. Les comparaisons entre 
les programmes de don utilisent la statistique des DPMP. Nous 
voulions déterminer si la variance des taux de dons d’organes, 
présentée comme les DPMP, peut s’expliquer par les différences 
démographiques des populations, spécialement les taux de mortalité spécifiques à l’âge et au sexe.
Méthode : Nous avons obtenu la distribution de la population 
et les décès pour l’an 2000 dans la région sanitaire de Calgary 
(RSC) et en Espagne. L’estimation des décès a été calculée par 
l’uniformisation de l’échantillon fondée sur les moyennes pondérées 
des taux de mortalité moyens spécifiques à l’âge, au sexe et à la 
cause du décès.
Résultats : En 2000, l’Espagne a rapporté un taux brut de don 
d’organes de 33,9 DPMP. L’uniformisation des décès observés en 
Espagne selon la distribution de la population de la RSC et le calcul 
des décès attendus selon les taux de la RSC ont fourni un taux 
ajusté de 19,2 DPMP (P< 0,05).
Conclusion : Ces résultats remettent en question la fiabilité de 
l’usage des DPMP bruts comme mesure de la performance du 
programme de don d’organes et de tissu. Des mesures différentes 
de la performance comparative des programmes de don d’organes 
doivent être envisagées.

THE majority of organs procured from cadaveric donors are from individuals determined 
dead by neurologic criteria (brain-stem 
death).1 Two causes of death, transport/
motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and deaths from cerebrovascular disease, represent the majority of patients 
whose diagnosis of death is based upon neurologic 
criteria, and from whom organs can potentially be 
procured. Organ donation is managed by regional 
or national programs, and the effectiveness of these 
programs is often measured according to the number 
of donors per million population (DPMP); simply, 
the number of donors divided by the potential donor 
population. However, DPMP is a crude estimate of 
the rate of organ donation, and makes three assumptions: 1) that age and gender distribution is similar for 
all populations; 2) that age and gender-adjusted death 
rates from traumatic or cerebrovascular brain injury 
are similar for all populations; and 3) that all programs use the same definition of organ donor.1 These 
assumptions have important limitations.
In 1989, Spain introduced a process of quality improvement in the identification and processing 
of organ donors. The Organización Nacional de 
Transplantes has been responsible for increasing organ 
donation rates in Spain. The Spanish DPMP of 33.6 
is one of the highest in the world, and is now considered a benchmark for other programs.2,3 Inferentially, 
it has been suggested that organ donation programs 
with DPMPs substantially below 33.6 may be failing 
patients awaiting a transplant. 
Due to concerns of the validity of the crude metric of DPMP in comparing transplant programs, we 
undertook a study to determine whether the variance 
in published DPMP rates in different jurisdictions 
may be influenced by differences in population demographics. Specifically, we sought to compare DPMP 
data from Spain, with a documented high DPMP, to 
that of a major urban centre in Canada.
Methods
The DPMP data for the Calgary Health Region 
(CHR) were obtained for the year 2000 from the 
CHR health systems and analysis unit. The CHR 
administers medical and surgical services to the residents of the cities of Calgary and Airdrie, and 20 
nearby small towns in Southern Alberta (total population 930,000). The study population was defined as 
individuals with a postal code in the CHR geographic 
domain. Deaths were classified by the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision.4 All deaths 
in categories I60–I69 (cerebrovascular disease) and 
V00–V99 (transport accidents) were determined. 
Deaths in Spain for the calendar year 2000 were 
obtained from the website of the Instituto Nacional 
de Estadistica (www.ine.es). Causes of death attributed to enfermedades cerebrovasculares (cerebrovascular disease), and accidentes de traffico de vehiculos 
de motor (MVAs) were included.5 The population 
in Spain in 2000 was 39,927,392. The two causes 
of death (transport/MVAs and deaths from cerebrovascular diseases) were selected for this analysis, since 
cumulatively, they represent the majority of patients 
from whom organs can potentially be procured. Given 
that organ donors are generally not accepted above 
the age of 69, this analysis was restricted to data from 
donors between 15 to 69 yr of age. 
To test the dependency of DPMP on population distribution, as well as age and gender-specific 
mortality rates, direct standardization was used.6 For 
example, to standardize the CHR population, proportions of the total population were calculated for each 
age and gender group in Spain. This proportion was 
then multiplied by the total population of the CHR, 
from which the standardized population of the CHR 
was determined. The reverse was done for Spain. To 
calculate the expected deaths in the CHR, the mortality rate in Spain for each cause, age and gender group 
was multiplied by the new standard population for 
the CHR. Again, the reverse was done for Spain. The 
adjusted DPMP was then calculated based upon the 
percent difference between observed and expected 
deaths, and the proportional distribution of brain 
death by etiology. 
Data were compared using Fisher’s exact test. 
Statistical significance was assumed when P < 0.05.

Results
The population distributions according to age were 
similar when comparing CHR to Spain for the 
year 2000 (Figure 1). The observed and standardized population distribution in Spain and the CHR 
(restricted to ages 15–69), stratified by age and gender, is presented in Table I. The number of observed 
and expected deaths from MVAs and cerebrovascular 
causes, stratified by gender, is presented in Table 
II. There were 5,292 deaths from MVAs and 4,383 
cerebrovascular deaths in the year 2000 in Spain. 
Once standardized according to age, gender and 
cause-specific mortality rates observed in the CHR, 
the expected deaths in Spain decreased by 55% for 
MVAs and by 54% for deaths of cerebrovascular origin (Figure 2). In 2000, the reported crude DPMP 
in Spain was 33.9. In Spain, 26.1% and 55% of brain 
deaths were due to MVAs and deaths of cerebrovascular origin, respectively. Therefore, correcting for the 
decrease in expected deaths (from the standardization 
procedure), Spain’s adjusted DPMP would decrease 
to 19.7, which is significantly different from the crude 
DPMP of 33.9 (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.03). 
The reverse analysis also held true. If the CHR 
had the age and gender cause-specific mortality rates 
observed in Spain, the expected deaths in the CHR

would have increased 218% and 284%, for deaths due 
to MVAs and cerebrovascular origin, respectively. To 
adjust the DPMP, the same method as above was 
applied. In the CHR, 33% and 42% of brain deaths were 
due to MVAs and cerebrovascular causes. Therefore, 
correcting proportionately for the increase in deaths, 
the adjusted DPMP in the CHR for the year 2000 was 
32.8. This value is significantly greater than the crude 
DPMP of 17.4 (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.03).
Discussion
A twofold difference in crude DPMP rates existed in 
the year 2000 between the CHR and Spain. However, 
our analysis demonstrates that at least some variance 
in the crude DPMPs can be explained by differences 
in the mortality rates from the major causes of brain 
death: traumatic brain injury from MVAs and cerebrovascular accidents. 
Geographical differences in the incidence of potential organ donors have been recognized from other 
jurisdictions.1 As shown with our analysis, differences 
in deaths due to MVAs can account for a portion of 
the DPMP. Deaths from MVAs per million population in Spain in 1998 exceeded those of Canada by 
one third.7 These differences may have been due to 
multiple factors including variable adoption of public health preventative practices (mandatory use of 
seatbelts, reduction of speed limits) that affect the 
incidence of MVAs.7
Discrepancies in definitions may also account for 
observed differences between published crude DPMPs. 
For example, Spain defines a cadaveric donor as “one 
from whom at least one vascularized solid organ 
was recovered for the purpose of transplantation”.8
Therefore, in those instances where an organ was recovered but not transplanted, the patient was still defined 
as a donor. In contrast, the definition in Canada is “a 
solid organ donor is one where at least one solid organ 
has been used for transplant”.9 If a condition renders 
a potential donor or a recovered organ unsuitable 
and no transplantation occurs, that patient cannot be 
counted as a donor, even though an organ was recovered. Unlike underlying demographic patterns of a 
population, data reflecting these differences were not 
available, and therefore adjusting the crude DPMPs for 
these discrepancies was not possible. 
Our results demonstrate that crude DPMP is an 
imperfect measure of organ donation program performance. Although it is a commonly-used benchmark, it may not truly reflect the effectiveness of a 
program from one region or country to another, 
nor the reality of the donation demographics.10 The 
National Coordinating Committee for Organ and 
Tissue Donation set a target goal for Canada of a 
crude cadaveric donor rate of 25 DPMP.11 If the 
death rates observed in the CHR are consistent across 
Canada, this rate may not be feasible. Moreover, 
as demonstrated herein, crude DPMP may not be 
the appropriate performance measure. The effectiveness of organ donation programs should be based 
upon standardized key performance indicators. Key 
performance indicators, which are usually expressed 
as proportions, have been previously described and 
include: the identification of brain death, the approach 
to families for consent and consent success, and the 
number of organs retrieved and transplanted.12 For 
example, in the CHR, the average consent rate over 
the years 2000 to 2002 was 81.6% compared to 78.2% 
in Spain. During the same time period, there was 
one more organ transplanted per donor in the CHR 
(3.5 organs per donor) than in Spain (2.5 organs per 
donor). Unfortunately, the reporting of many of these 
variables has not been required of health systems, or as 
part of vital statistics. 
The Organización Nacional de Transplantes program in Spain is a fine example of a national program 
to enhance organ donation rates, and has forced the 
health system to report and be accountable for the 
organ donation process. However, our data suggest 
that comparisons in performance based on crude 
DPMP may not fairly reflect the variance in the incidence of brain death, and the effectiveness of organ 
donation programs. We suggest that other key performance indicators, as described above, be used.
