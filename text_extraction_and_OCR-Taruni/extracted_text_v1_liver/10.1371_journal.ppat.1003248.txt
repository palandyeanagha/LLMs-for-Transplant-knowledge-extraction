Abstract
Upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic
acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory
cytokines. These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can
modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus
(HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that
HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV
replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced
type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling
components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCe/JNK/c-Jun and PKCa/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our
results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-a signaling through MyD88
and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.

Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped positive-sense
RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family (Hepacivirus genus) [1,2].
Since its discovery in 1989 [3], HCV has been revealed as a
primary cause of chronic hepatitis, end-stage cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Worldwide, an estimated 200
million persons (approximately 3% of the global population) are
chronically infected with HCV, and 3 to 4 million persons are
newly infected each year [4,5]. Naturally occurring variants of
HCV are classified into six major genotypes. The 9.6-kb HCV
genome encodes a large polyprotein that is processed by viral and
cellular proteins to produce the virion structural proteins (core
protein and glycoproteins E1 and E2) and nonstructural (NS)
proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [3,4].
Innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses are essential for
host survival during viral infection. Upon recognition of viral
components, host cells are activated to produce type I interferon
(IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby upregulating a
family of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that exert pleiotropic
inhibitory effects on viral replication in neighboring cells [6,7].
Type I IFN production requires tight control to achieve the
appropriate immune response to invading pathogens without
triggering an immune disorder [8]. Consequently, viruses have
developed strategies to evade and antagonize the host immune
response and resist the antiviral actions of IFN therapy. However,
the mechanism(s) underlying such immune evasion is not clear.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of highly
conserved small non-coding RNAs. They function primarily by
binding to the 39 untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs to
achieve post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [9].
Many miRNAs have been reported to regulate a wide range of
biological processes, including development [10], cell differentiation [11], proliferation, and apoptosis [12–14]. Many miRNAs,
including miR-146 [15], miR-155 [16–18], miR-98, and let-7
[19], participate in innate and adaptive immune responses [20–
22]. miR-21 was found to be more strongly expressed in HCC
specimens than in non-tumorous tissues [23], and participates in
HCC development by regulating the phosphatase and tensin
homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene [24]. miR-21 is
also overexpressed in HCV-positive liver biopsy samples, as
assessed by microarray analysis [25]. Although these results
suggest the involvement of miR-21 in antiviral responses, no
studies have reported the mechanism that underlies the regulation
of type I IFN signaling mediated by miR-21 or the antiviral
response of miR-21 to type I IFN signaling.

In the present study, we analyzed the miR-21 expression profile
in human hepatocytes during HCV infection and found that miR21 was rapidly upregulated following HCV infection. Upregulated
miR-21 suppressed MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in hepatocytes, which subsequently repressed type I IFN effector gene
expression and the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, thereby
promoting viral replication. In addition, miR-21 also enhanced the
replication of other viruses such as enterovirus 71 (EV71), human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) by repressing type-I IFN production. To the best of our
knowledge, this report is the first to show that miR-21 is
upregulated upon RNA virus infection and acts as a negative
regulator of type I IFN signaling by targeting MyD88 and IRAK1.
Results
HCV infection upregulates miR-21 expression
Although miR-21 is highly expressed in HCC [24] and
overexpressed in HCV-positive liver biopsy specimens, as assessed
by microarray analysis [23,25], the mechanism involved in the
regulation of miR-21 by HCV infection is still unknown. To
determine the relationship between HCV infection and miR-21
activation, we determined the levels of miR-21 in hepatocytes
infected with the virus. The results from quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that miR-21 levels were
increased in human Huh7 hepatocytes 1 h after infection HCV
strain JFH-1 and reached a peak 6 h after HCV exposure
(Figure 1A); this response was dose-dependent (Figure 1B). To
understand the kinetics of miR-21 induction in HCV infection, we
measured the expression of primary miR-21 (pri-miR-21) and
miR-21 precursor (pre-miR-21). The induction of pri-miR-21 and
pre-miR-21 were coincided with that of mature miR-21 and
occurred as early as 2h.p.i. (Figure S1A). We cannot rule out the
possibility that the increased miR-21 induced by HCV infection
was due to nonspecific effects. To assess this possibility, a random
non-HCV-related miRNA (miR-93) was analyzed after HCV
infection (Figure S1B). Moreover, cells inoculated with UVirradiated inactive HCV were also used as another negative
control. As the same result of miR-93, the expression level of miR21 was shown to have no significant changes (Figure S1C). These
results indicated that HCV activated miR-21 expression in
hepatocytes.
To confirm the above results, the effect of a small interfering
RNA directly targeting HCV (si-HCV) on the HCV-regulated
induction of miR-21 was examined. Huh7 cells were transfected
with pFL-J6/JFH59C19Rluc2Aubi RNA and si-HCV or control
siRNA (si-Ctrl). The results showed that Renilla luciferase activity
was inhibited by treatment with si-HCV, but not with si-Ctrl
(Figure S1D), indicating that HCV replication was inhibited by siHCV. The results from qPCR showed that miR-21 levels were
also significantly reduced in the presence of si-HCV (Figure S1E),
suggesting that HCV activated miR-21 expression.
The HCV NS3/4A and NS5A proteins activate miR-21
expression through the c-Fos and c-Jun signaling
proteins
Because HCV is involved in the regulation of miR-21
expression, we next wanted to determine which, if any, of the
HCV proteins was responsible for such regulation. Huh7 cells
were co-transfected with plasmids expressing each of the 11 HCV
proteins and miPPR21, which containing the miR-21 promoter
spanning the 2410 to +38 bp region. Luciferase activity assay
indicated that the NS3/4A complex and NS5A protein, exert the
most stimulatory effects on the activation of the miR-21 promoter
(Figure 2A, left panel). qPCR analysis also showed that the NS3/
4A complex and NS5A protein can enhance the expression of
miR-21 (Figure 2A, right panel).
Several conserved regulatory elements that have previously
been reported [26] were found in the consensus sequence of
miPPR-21 (Figure 2B), including binding sites for activation
protein 1 (AP-1), an E-twenty six family transcription factor (Ets/
PU.1), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), nuclear
factor I (NFI), signal recognition particle (SRP), the p53
transcription factor (p53), and signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3). To analyze the roles of these regulatory
elements in the regulation of HCV-mediated miR-21 expression,
we constructed a series of reporter plasmids (f1–f4) in which either
full-length miPPR-21 or truncation mutants of this promoter were
fused to the 59 end of the firefly luciferase gene (Figure 2C, upper
panel). Full-length miPPR-21 displays clear NS5A (Figure 2C,
right panel) or NS3/4A (Figure 2C, left panel) inducibility, which
is decreased by truncations of this promoter region, indicating that
the distal AP-1 site is involved in the induction of miR-21 by
NS5A and NS3/4A. Similar results were obtained from a different
experiment showing that AP-1 was involved in the activities of
HCV NS5A and NS3/4A proteins (Figure S2).
It has been well established that AP-1 functions synergistically
with members of the Ets/PU.1 family. Experiments using another
set of reporters, where several binding sites for AP-1 or Ets/PU.1
were mutated (f5–f10) indicated that the AP-1 elements in miPPR21 are crucial for its NS5A and NS3/4A inducibility (Figure 2C
middle panel). In addition, some mutations in the NFI and C/
EBPa binding sites (f11–f14) in miPPR-21 showed no significant
effects (Figure 2C lower panel).
Because AP-1 consists of two subunits, c-Jun and c-Fos, it was
necessary to find out which subunit of AP-1 is responsible for the
HCV-mediated activation of miPPR-21. Western blot analysis was
used to determine the expression levels of c-Jun and c-Fos as
regulated by NS5A and NS3/4A, respectively. The levels of both
Author Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of chronic hepatitis,
end-stage cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, has
chronically infected 200 million people worldwide and 3–4
million more each year. When triggered by viral infection,
host cells produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines to antagonize the virus. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying HCV immune
system evasion remains elusive. Our results provided the
first direct evidence that microRNA-21 (miR-21) feedback
inhibits type I IFN signaling when cells are challenged with
HCV, thus promoting the infection. MicroRNA is a kind of
endogenous non-coding small RNA that regulates a wide
range of biological processes and participate in innate and
adaptive immune responses through complementarily
pairing with target mRNA, which can regulate its expression or translation. Currently, miRNAs have intrigued many
scientists as potent targets or therapeutic agents for
diseases. In our study, the targets of miR-21, myeloid
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are important for
HCV-induced type I IFN production, have also been found.
Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, AP-1, which
is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to
HCV infection. Taken together, our research has provided
new insights into understanding the effects of miRNA on
host-virus interactions, and revealed a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.

phosphorylated and total c-Jun, but not c-Fos, were activated by
NS5A in a time-dependent fashion (Figure 2D, left panel). In
addition, the levels of phosphorylated and total c-Fos, but not cJun, were stimulated by the NS3/4A complex in a time-dependent
fashion (Figure 2D, right panel). These results suggested that the
NS5A and NS3/4A proteins may stimulate the miR-21 expression
through the same AP-1 element site, but the specific protein
involved in this pathway may be different.
In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed to confirm that the binding of c-Jun to the miPPR-21
promoter was enhanced by the NS5A protein, and the binding of
c-Fos to miPPR-21 promoter was stimulated by NS3/4A complex
(Figure 2E, left panel). In contrast, the promoter region of a HCVnoninducible housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was not coimmunoprecipitated by any of these factors (Figure 2E, right panel).
Together these results demonstrated that both NS5A and NS3/4A
proteins of HCV stimulate miR-21 expression through AP-1, but
NS5A regulates miR-21 mainly through c-Jun and NS3/4A
mediates miR-21 mainly through c-Fos.
PKC-JNK and PKC-ERK signaling pathways are involved in
the activation of miR-21 regulated by HCV NS5A and
NS3/4A proteins
It is well known that members of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) family regulate transcription factors that are
important in the regulation of AP-1 activation and expression,
which has been shown to depend on different kinase activators in
various cell types. Based on our finding that NS5A-regulated
activation and NS3/4A-regulated activation of miR-21 required cJun and c-Fos, respectively, we investigated the roles of kinases and
the molecular mechanisms underlying this event.
Cells co-transfected with the reporter plasmid miPPR-21 and
pCMV-NS5A or pCMV-NS3/4A were treated with inhibitors of
different signaling pathway components, including LY-294002
(Phosphoinostitde 3-Kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor), H-89
(cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-specific inhibitor),
SP600125 (Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-specific inhibitor),
U0126 (MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal regulated
kinase (ERK)-specific inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK-specific inhibitor), SB203580 (P38 MAP kinase-specific inhibitor), MG132
(nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) specific inhibitor), and GF109203
(protein kinase C (PKC)-specific inhibitor). The results from
luciferase activity assays showed that the miR-21 promoter activity
induced by NS5A decreased significantly in the presence of
SP600125 and GF10203 (Figure 3A, left panel). Additionally, the
miR-21 promoter activity up-regulated by NS3/4A was clearly
repressed by U0126, PD98059, and GF10203 (Figure 3A, right
panel). Western blot and qPCR analyses revealed a reduction of
the phosphorylation and total protein levels of c-Jun or c-Fos with
a corresponding decrease in the expression level of miR-21
stimulated by NS5A (Figure 3B, left panel) or NS3/4A (Figure 3B,
right panel), respectively.
The roles of ERK and JNK in the NS5A- and NS3/4Amediated activation of miR-21 were further examined using three
dominant kinase-inactive mutants of ERK or JNK (mERK1,
mERK2, and mJNK), the expression of which can block kinase
activities by competing with endogenous kinases. Cells were cotransfected with pCMV-NS5A or pCMV-NS3/4A, miPPR-21,
and each of the three kinase mutants. Reporter gene expression,
measured as luciferase activity, was reduced by the JNK or ERK
mutants in cells transfected with NS5A (Figure 3C, left panel) or
NS3/4A (Figure 3C, right panel), respectively, and this response
was dose-dependent. Taken together, these data suggested that
ERK, JNK and PKC are involved in HCV-induced miR-21
activation, while the NS5A protein may specifically trigger the
PKC-JNK pathway and NS3/4A may trigger the PKC-ERK
pathway.
NS5A- and NS3/4A-stimulated the phosphorylation of
JNK and ERK1/2 results in the binding of AP-1 to the miR21 promoter via the PKCe and PKCa signal transduction
pathways
To further investigate the role of the two HCV proteins in the
activation of signal transduction pathways, we determined the
phosphorylation status of JNK and ERK1/2 in Huh7 cells via
Western blot analysis using antibodies specifically recognizing
phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2. The results showed that the
levels of phosphorylated JNK or phosphorylated ERK1/2
increased in a time-dependent fashion in the presence of NS5A
(Figure 4A) or NS3/4A protein (Figure 4E), respectively.
Phosphorylation of JNK was blocked by both SP600125 and
GF109203 (Figure 4D, left panel). Accordingly, the level of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by PD98059,
U0126, and GF109203 (Figure 4H, left panel). These results
indicated that the JNK and ERK phosphorylation induced by the
two HCV proteins is dependent on the PKC transduction
pathway.
The PKC family has been shown to be involved in signal
transduction associated with a wide range of biological responses,
triggering changes in cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation [27,28]. As NS5A and NS3/4A-activated ERK and JNK
were dependent on PKC, we extended our study to identify the
specific isozymes of PKC involved in the HCV-regulated
activation of miR-21 using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach.
Molecules of small interference RNA (siRNA) that specifically
knock down genes encoding each PKC isozyme were designed and

used to study the function of PKC, based on a previous study [29].
We previously demonstrated that these siRNA molecules were
specific and effective [30,31]. Our results indicated that PKCespecific and PKCa-specific siRNA (PKCe RNAi and PKCa
RNAi, respectively) were able to significantly inhibit the induction

NS5A (Figure 4B) or NS3/4A (Figure 4F), respectively. Western
blot analyses were used to detect the phosphorylation or total
protein levels of c-Jun or c-Fos induced by NS5A (Figure 4C,
upper panel) or NS3/4A (Figure 4G, upper panel), respectively.
The miR-21 expression levels stimulated by these two proteins
were measured by qPCR (Figure 4C and 4G, lower panel). These
results confirmed the reduction seen in the corresponding
luciferase reporter assays.
The effects of PKCe and PKCa on the phosphorylation of JNK
and ERK were also evaluated using another RNAi approach. The
results from the Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylated
JNK levels stimulated by the NS5A protein were significantly
decreased upon treatment with PKCe-specific siRNA (PKCe
RNAi) (Figure 4D, right panel). Similarly, the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 activated by the NS3/4A protein was inhibited by
PKCa-specific siRNA (PKCa RNAi) (Figure 4H, right panel). All
of these results suggested that PKCe is the upstream kinase
involved in NS5A-induced JNK/c-Jun activation, and PKCa is
the upstream kinase in NS3/4A induced ERK/c-Fos activation.
miR-21 suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production
in hepatocytes
It is known that miRNAs regulate a wide range of biological
processes, including development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Some miRNAs, including miR-146, miR-155,
miR-98, and let-7, participate in the innate and adaptive immune
responses. Although our results demonstrated that miR-21 was
activated by HCV proteins through two signaling pathways, the
biological effects of miR-21 have not previously been studied.
Thus, we investigated the role of miR-21 in the regulation of
innate and adaptive immune responses during HCV infection.
First, the effects of synthetic miR-21 mimics and miR-21
inhibitor on the expression of miR-21 were evaluated. miR-21
inhibitor is a synthetic oligonucleotide with exact sequence
complementarity to miR-21. Such inhibitor oligonucleotides have
been shown to sequester intracellular miRNAs and to inhibit their
activity in the RNA-interfering pathway [32]. Huh7 cells were
transfected with miR-21 or nonspecific control RNA oligonucleotides (miR-Ctrl) and miR-21 inhibitor or Ctrl-inhibitor, respectively. As expected, the miR-21 mimics increased miR-21
expression significantly in Huh7 hepatocytes, whereas miR-21
inhibitors decreased miR-21 expression (Figure 5A). To determine
whether HCV infection stimulates IFN-a expression, Huh7 cells
were infected with the JFH-1 HCV strain at a high multiplicity of
infection (MOI = 1), and IFN-a expression was monitored. Time
course analysis revealed that IFN-a was rapidly induced, reaching
peak concentrations within 12 h (Figure 5B). However, the levels
of IFN-a mRNA and protein were not significantly affected in
Huh7 cells inoculated with UV-inactivated HCV (Figure S3A).
As a comparison, we also examined the effects of transfection of
the pFL-J6/JFH59C19Rluc2AUbi on the induction of miR-21 and
IFN-a in Huh7 cells. The results revealed that the levels of miR-21
(Figure S3B, left panel) and IFN-a (Figure S3B, right panel)
rapidly increased in Huh7 cells transfected with pFL-J6/
JFH59C19Rluc2AUbi and reached a peak at 12 h post-transfection (Figure S3B). The ability of the plasmids to replicated HCV
infection was confirmed by Renilla luciferase activity assay (Figure
S3C). These results demonstrated that the effects of pFL-J6/
JFH59C19Rluc2AUbi on the induction of miR-21 and IFN-a
were equivalent to that of the JFH-1 HCV strain. To ensure HCV
production, FL-J6/JFH59C19Rluc2AUbi transfection was primarily used in the subsequent experiments, which required short
investigation time.
The effects of miR-21 and HCV on the expression of IFN-a
were then determined. Huh7 cells were infected with the JFH-1
HCV strain and treated with miR-21, miR-Ctrl, miR-21 inhibitor,
and Ctrl-inhibitor, respectively. Our results indicated that miR-21
overexpression reduced IFN-a mRNA and protein levels in HCVexposed cells (Figure 5C), whereas miR-21 inhibitors caused a
modest but reproducible enhancement of IFN-a expression
(Figure 5D). These results demonstrated that HCV infection
activates miR-21 expression and miR-21 suppresses the production of type I IFN.
We further investigated the effect of miR-21 on HCV induction
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in Huh7 hepatocytes. Huh7 cells were transfected with pFL-J6/JFH59C19Rluc2Aubi and treated with miR-21 or miR-Ctrl. Similar to its effect
on type I IFN, miR-21 suppressed the HCV-induced production
of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and IL-8
(Figure S3D and S3E). Moreover, miR-21 decreased HCVinduced NF-kB p65 phosphorylation, indicating that NF-kB
signaling is also negatively regulated by miR-21 (Figure S3F).
These results suggest that miR-21 downregulates a range of
responses to HCV infection in hepatocytes.
miR-21 facilitates HCV replication by counteracting
antiviral activity of IFN-a
To determine whether miR-21 facilitates HCV replication and
expression, Huh7 cells were transfected with miR-21 and then
infected with HCV (MOI = 1). Intracellular HCV RNA levels
were determined by qPCR, and HCV core protein expression was
determined by Western blot analysis. The results showed that
miR-21 overexpression significantly upregulated HCV replication
and core protein expression (Figure 6A and B), indicating that
miR-21 can facilitate HCV replication.
To evaluate the effects of IFN-a on HCV replication in the
presence of miR-21, Huh7 cells were transfected with either miR21 or miR-Ctrl and then infected with HCV, followed by
treatment with or without IFN-a (100 U/ml). The results from
qPCR analysis showed that there was a 5-fold reduction in HCV
replication after IFN-a treatment in control cells, but only a 2-fold
reduction in HCV replication of miR-21-overexpressing cells
(Figure 6C). These results demonstrate that miR-21 counteracts
the effects of IFN-a treatment on viral replication.
To further characterize the biological significance of the
observed up-regulated miR-21 expression and the subsequent
impairment of HCV-triggered type I IFN production, we further
investigated the effects of inhibiting the miR-21-inducible expression on HCV replication and the role of IFN-a. We transfected
HCV-infected Huh7 cells with the miR-21 inhibitor and
determined the level of HCV replication in the cell culture
medium by qPCR. We found that inhibiting miR-21-inducible
expression, the same as by adding of recombinant IFN-a,
suppressed HCV replication; however, this effect was reversed
by anti-IFN-a-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that miR-21
promotes HCV replication by downregulating IFN-a production
(Figure 6D). Intracellular HCV replicates were similarly affected
by the miR-21 inhibitor and anti-IFN-a-neutralizing antibodies
(Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that HCV-induced miR-21
expression promotes HCV replication in hepatocytes by suppressing type I IFN production.
The antiviral responsiveness of IFN-a is attenuated by
miR-21 overexpression
The IFN-a/b subtypes activate a common type I IFN receptor,
which consists of two subunits (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2). The type I

IFN receptor is expressed on the surface of virtually all host cells
[33] and is essential for the antiviral activity of IFN-a [34,35]. We
used qPCR, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses to elucidate the
effects of miR-21 on IFNAR1/IFNAR2 expression. The Sendai
virus (SeV), which triggers the IFN response, was used as a positive
control. As shown in Figure 7, IFNAR1/IFNAR2 expression was
significantly reduced in cells overexpressing miR-21 (left/top
panel) and increased in cells expressing the miR-21 inhibitor
(right/low panel).
Binding of type I IFN to IFNAR initiates a signaling cascade
that leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes
[36]. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
proteins are transcription factors that are important in IFN
signaling; genetic defects in STAT-1 result in death by viral disease
at an early age [35]. Double-stranded RNA-activated protein
kinase (PKR), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and myxovirus
resistance protein (Mx) also mediate the antiviral effects of IFN-a
[37–39]. Therefore, we assessed the effect of miR-21 on these
proteins in Huh7 cells. Our results demonstrated that miR-21
attenuated the IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2
(Figure S4A) and the expression of PKR, OAS, and Mx (Figure
S4B). In addition, we observed that although the phosphorylation
of STAT1 and STAT2 was downregulated by miR-21, the total
STAT protein levels were relatively unaffected, indicating that
JAK-STAT signaling activity is negatively regulated by miR-21.
These results demonstrate that miR-21 suppresses the antiviral
response mediated by IFN-a.
miR-21 regulates the expression of components of the
Toll-like receptor signaling cascade
After detection of viral ssRNA, the endosomal single-stranded
RNA receptor, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), uses the MyD88
adaptor protein, to initiate IFN-a synthesis via interleukin-1-
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, IRAK4, tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF6), and the interferon
regulatory factor (IRF) 7 transcription factor [40]. TLR7 is
expressed in HCV-infected hepatocytes [41], therefore, we

evaluated proteins in this signaling cascade to identify potential
targets of miR-21. As shown in Figure 8, the mRNA levels of
MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 were decreased by miR-21
overexpression and increased by miR-21 inhibition. We also
evaluated the gene expression of TLR7 in the same experimental
samples using qPCR and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. TLR7
expression did not show any significant changes in hepatocytes in
which miR-21 was over-expressed or silenced compared with the
control cells transfected with miRNA-control (data not shown).
Since miRNA mimics were small chemically modified doublestranded RNAs, and the sequence of miR-21 mimic did not
contain the 59-UGUGU-39 internal motif [42], we deduced that
miR-21 mimic could not activate TLR7 signaling as ssRNA.
IRF-7 is an ISG that is expressed in HCV-infected hepatocytes,
and its expression in the liver is IFN-dependent [43,44]. IRF-7
promotes the expression of various IFN subtypes, which further
amplifies the host response and prolongs IFN production [44].
Here, we investigated the effect of miR-21 on the expression of
IRF-7. qPCR (Figure S5A) and RT-PCR (Figure S5B) results
showed that the levels of IRF-7 mRNA were decreased upon
treatment with miR-21 and increased upon treatment with miR21 inhibitor. The results of a Western blot analysis showed that the
nuclear translocation of IRF7 was attenuated by miR-21 (Figure
S5C, left panel) and stimulated by miR-21 inhibitor (Figure S5C,
right panel). These results suggested that miR-21 mediates host
antiviral responses by suppressing the expression of genes involved
in the TLR signaling cascade.
Additionally, as TLR signaling components were found to be
regulated by HCV-induction of miR-21, HCV infection itself may
also reduce the expression of these signaling components.
Following treatment of Huh7 cells with FL-J6/JFH59C19Rluc2AUbi for 24 h, qPCR results confirmed our hypothesis (Figure
S6A). The same effect was shown with respect to the IRF7 nuclear
translocation mediated by HCV activation (Figure S6B).
MyD88 and IRAK1 are targets of miR-21
Next, we investigated potential targets of miR-21 involved in
modulating HCV-triggered type I IFN production. We used
RNA22 and FINDTAR3 software to predict miR-21 targets and
found putative miR-21 binding sites in the 39 UTRs of human
MyD88 and IRAK1 (Figure 9A). To verify the possibility that
MyD88 and IRAK1 were regulated post-transcriptionally by miR21, we constructed reporter plasmids by cloning these miR-21
binding sites into the 39 UTRs of firefly luciferase or green
fluorescent protein (GFP). A four base pair mutation (mutant type)
was introduced into the miR-21 binding site within the 39UTR of
IRAK1 or MyD88 cDNA (Figure S7A). After co-transfecting the
luciferase reporter plasmids into Huh7 cells with vectors expressFigure 6. miR-21 stimulates HCV replication and attenuates the HCV response to IFN-a treatment. (A) Huh7 hepatocytes were
transfected with control RNA (miR-ctrl) or miR-21 mimics (final concentration, 50 nM). After 48 h, cells were infected with HCV (MOI = 1) for 2 h and

control. (B) Huh7 hepatocytes were transfected as described in (A) and infected with HCV (MOI = 1) for 2 h. After 48 h, HCV core expression was

control RNA (miR-ctrl) (final concentration, 50 nM). After 48 h, cells were infected with HCV (MOI = 1) for 2 h and washed before adding fresh medium

(100 neutralizing units/ml) as indicated. After 72 h, RNA was isolated from the cell culture medium, and supernatant HCV replicates (D) were
measured by qPCR. Intracellular HCV RNA replicates (E) were quantified by qPCR using GAPDH as internal control. Data are presented as the
means+SD (n = 3) from one representative experiment. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. **, p,0.01; *, p,0.05.

ing miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, we observed that miR-21 mimics
markedly decreased luciferase expression, whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased luciferase expression (Figure 9B). miR-21 mimics
also downregulated GFP gene expression when the 39-UTR of
MyD88 or IRAK1 was cloned into the 39-UTR region of GFP in
HEK293 cells, as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 9C).
Paralleling the previous results, neither luciferase nor GFP gene
expression could be regulated by miR-21 with a mutant-type
39UTR (Figure S7B and S7C). Furthermore, transfection of miR21 mimics decreased MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in Huh7 cells
in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Figure 9D),
whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased MyD88 and IRAK1
expression (Figure 9E), suggesting that MyD88 and IRAK1
expression could be inhibited by miR-21 via both translational
inhibition and mRNA degradation. Taken together, these results
show that miR-21 regulates the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1,
suggesting the possibility that human MyD88 and IRAK1 are new
targets of miR-21.
Besides, we confirmed that HCV alone does, indeed, downregulate MyD88 and IRAK1 expression (Figure S6C). The suppression of MyD88 and IRAK1 caused by HCV infection was almost
eliminated in miR-21 inhibitor transfected cells but not in negative
inhibitor control transfected cells or the mock transfected cells at
24 h.p.i. (Figure S6D). This result was in agreement with our
hypothesis that upregulation of miR-21 by HCV results in the
downregulation of these two factors.
Regulation of IFN signaling by miR-21 is mediated by
MyD88 and IRAK1
To verify the roles of MyD88 and IRAK1 in IFN signaling,
we silenced these genes and examined the effects on HCVtriggered type I IFN production. Small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) effectively inhibited MyD88 and IRAK1 expression
in Huh7 cells (Figure 10A). Knockdown of MyD88 or IRAK1
significantly decreased the levels of IFN-a mRNA and protein
(Figure 10B), which produced effects similar to those of miR-21
overexpression. Increased IFN-a expression due to miR-21
inhibition was suppressed by siRNAs against MyD88 or IRAK1
(Figure 10C). These results suggest that knockdown of MyD88
or IRAK1 phenocopied the attenuated IFN signaling effect of
induced miR-21 and counteracted the effect of miR-21
inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that virally
induced miR-21 regulates IFN signaling through suppression of
endogenous MyD88 and IRAK1, thereby inhibiting type I IFN
production.

mimics or control mimics, miR-21 inhibitor or control inhibitor (final concentration, 50 nM), as indicated. After transfection for 30 h, the cells were
treated with recombinant human IFN-a (100 U/ml) or infected with Sendai virus (SeV), as indicated. After 12 h, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 mRNA and protein
expression was determined by qPCR (A, B), RT-PCR (C) and Western blot analysis (D), respectively. Data are shown as the means+SD (n = 3) from one
representative experiment. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. **, p,0.01; *, p,0.05.

It is known that type I IFN production through the Toll-likeinterleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor (TRIF) plays a
crucial role in mounting an antiviral response against HCV and
the virus has evolved to cripple this pathway [45]. To test whether
this pathway also affect the IFN-a meditated by the miR-21 on
MyD88 pathway, TRIF or IRF was knocked down in Huh7 cell
lines, which were then treated with miR-21 and HCV. The level of
IFN-a protein was decreased by miR-21 and this regulation was
not affected by treatment with TRIF or IRF3 siRNA compared to
the control (Figure S8). Thus, the mechanism by which miR-21
uses MyD88 and IRAK1 to counter the type I IFN-associated
antiviral response during HCV infection is an independent
pathway of the TRIF pathway.
miR-21 enhances the replication and production of other
viruses by hampering the antiviral activity of IFN-a
Because miR-21 disrupts antiviral function by inhibiting type I
IFN, we speculated that miR-21 may exhibit a broad range of
functions involved in regulating the replication and production of
other viruses. To confirm this hypothesis, three additional viruses,
EV71, HIV-1, and VSV, were included in our analyses.
First, we examined the effects of miR-21 on EV71 replication in
RD cells. miR-21 effectively stimulated viral VP1 mRNA and
protein levels (Figure 11A left panel). The suppression effect of
IFN-a treatment on virus replication was weakened by miR-21
over-expression (Figure 11A, right panel). Next, we assessed the
effects of miR-21 on HIV production in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A reporter plasmid containing an
HIV-1 clone, pNL4-3.luc.R-E-, was introduced into PBMCs
together with a control Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid (pRL)
as a loading control. Luciferase activity was measured in the
presence of cotransfected synthetic miR-21 or negative control,
treated with or without IFN, respectively. The results from the
luciferase assays showed that HIV-1 transcription was induced in
the presence of miR-21(Figure 11B, left panel), and miR-21 also
counteracted the IFN-a anti-HIV activity (Figure 11B, right
panel). VSV is a pathogen that is extremely sensitive to the action
of type-I IFNs. Thus, we finally investigated the effect of miR-21
on VSV production. Similar to the results obtained for EV71 and
HIV, miR-21 overexpression in Huh7 cells resulted in increased
virus titers (Figure 11C, left panel), and decreased the effects of
IFN-a on VSV.
These results suggested that miR-21 activates the replication
of EV71, HIV-1, and VSV by suppressing the antiviral activity
of IFN-a. The effects of EV71, HIV-1, and VSV on the
expression of miR-21 were also investigated in this study. RD,
PBMCs, and Huh7 cells were infected with EV71, HIV-1, or
VSV, respectively. qPCR results indicated that the levels of
miR-21 were induced significantly by both HIV-1 and VSV, but
not by EV71.

Discussion
In response to viral infection, signaling pathways in mammalian
cells direct a variety of intracellular events that generate an
immune response within infected cells. This host response
represents our first line of defense against viral infection, and if
successful, results in an abortive infection. However, viruses adopt
various strategies to evade host defenses [46]. Molecular mechFigure 9. miR-21 targets human MyD88 and IRAK1. (A) Sequence alignment of miR-21 and its binding sites in the 39 UTRs of MyD88 and IRAK1,

anisms by which viruses trigger and regulate these antiviral
processes have recently been characterized. The host response
launches an innate immune defense against HCV infection [47],
and HCV evades the host response through a multifaceted process
that includes signaling interference, effector modulation, and
continuous genetic variation. These evasion strategies promote the
persistent infection and spread of HCV; therefore, identifying the
precise molecular mechanisms by which HCV regulates the host
response may reveal novel therapeutic targets. The TLR-MyD88
signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in virus recognition and
initiation of the antiviral response in immune cells. Although HCV
was previously shown to modulate the TLR-MyD88 antiviral
response [48], the precise mechanism involved remains unclear,
and additional negative regulators need to be identified.
miR-21 is overexpressed in breast, colon, lung, pancreas,
prostate, and stomach tumors, as well as in cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines, indicating that miR-21 may play a key role in tumor cell
behavior and malignant transformation. Inhibition of miR-21 also
increases cell growth in other cancer types [49] and exerts antiapoptotic effects in glioblastoma and cholangiocarcinoma [50,51].
Thus, altering miR-21 expression can produce diverse effects on
tumor cells. Here, we revealed that miR-21 expression is
stimulated by HCV infection in human hepatocytes, and showed
that miR-21 is also activated in cells infected HIV-1 or VSV.
Thus, we provided a direct evidence for the association of miR-21
expression with viral infection.
The mechanism involved in the activation of miR-21 mediated
by HCV infection was further investigated. Our results showed
that AP-1 is at least partially responsible for the upregulation of
miR-21. Recently, some researchers have demonstrated that AP-1
activates the miR-21 transcription in conjunction with the switch/
sucrose non fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, after phorbol 12-
myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation through the conserved AP1 and PU.1 binding sites in the promoter. Hence, it is possible that
posttranscriptional processing and/or decay of miRNAs may also
contribute to the unequal upregulation of miR-21 during HCV
infection. AP-1 is a cellular transcription factor complex involved
in several cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and differentiation. It has recently been reported that AP-1 is
induced during infections by various viruses, including hepatitis B
virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), and HIV, and that this induction promotes viral replication.
Many viral proteins can induce multiple signaling pathways, which
may cross-talk with each other or converge on common
downstream effectors. In the present study, we demonstrated that
AP-1 is essential for NS5A and NS3/4A protein-induced miR-21
expression, as mutations in AP-1 binding sites eliminated the
protein-induced activation of miR-21 promoter activity. Based on
our finding that the NS5A and NS3/4A proteins activate c-Jun
and c-Fos expression, respectively, we further investigated the roles
of different MAP kinases in the activation of miR-21 by the two
proteins. The results suggested that ERK, JNK, and PKC were all
involved in the HCV-mediated activation of miR-21. Additionally,
active PKCa/ERK was required for the binding of c-Fos to the
miR-21 promoter in response to NS3/4A protein stimulation; the
PKCe/JNK pathway is the important signaling pathway in the
regulation of c-Jun by the NS5A protein. According to our
confocal immunofluorescence results, NS3/4A and NS5A were
distributed in the cytoplasm evenly (Figure S10), and this
observation was consistent with the previous results [52,53].
However, there is also evidence that the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) of NS5A can be detected in the nucleus, though the fulllength NS5A protein is localized in cytoplasm [54]. This,
therefore, suggests that NS5A may have the ability to translocate
Figure 10. Regulation of IFN signaling by miR-21 is achieved
primarily through MyD88 and IRAK1. (A) Huh7 hepatocytes were
transfected with nonspecific control siRNA or siRNA against MyD88 or
IRAK1, as indicated. After 24 h, MyD88 and IRAK1 mRNA levels were

times, and IFN-a expression and secretion were determined by qPCR
and ELISA, respectively. Data are the means+SD (n = 3) of one
representative experiment. Similar results were obtained in three
independent experiments. **, p,0.01; *, p,0.05.

into the nucleus and function as an activator of transcription when
the NLS is exposed.
Several genes have been identified as miR-21 targets, suggesting
the multifaceted function of miR-21; however, the target profile of
miR-21 does not appear to be complete. The major targets and
functions of a specific miRNA vary under different physiological
or pathological conditions and in different cell types. miR-21
appears to participate in various biological processes by targeting
different genes, including PTEN [24], DNMT1 [55], PDCD4 [56]
and FasL [57]. The abundance of different miRNAs following
HCV infection has already been examined [58,59], and the
overexpression of miR-21 has also been shown. However, the
upregulation of miR-21 to downregulate specific proteins involved
in the IFN response has not been described. In the present study,
we demonstrated that miR-21 functions as a negative regulator,
targeting MyD88 and IRAK1 in HCV-infected hepatocytes to
attenuate IFN signaling, thereby facilitating HCV evasion of
antiviral responses. Our findings contribute to the understanding
of the role of miR-21 in host–virus interactions.
We found that miR-21 attenuated the expression of the IFNstimulated genes PKR, Mx, and OAS (Figure S4B), which limit
HCV replication by disrupting viral RNA translation and
inhibiting viral genomic RNA synthesis [60–62]. We then checked
upstream by examining the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and
STAT2. miR-21 decreased STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation, but
had little effect on total STAT protein levels (Figure S4A). The
activation of STAT1 and STAT2 mainly occurs through the IFNJAK/STAT pathway, so we evaluated the initiation point of this
pathway, IFN-associated receptors (IFNARs), and found that miR21 overexpression reduced IFNARs expression (Figure 7). According to these results, the induction of miR-21 can disturb the
JAK-STAT pathway, which is a logical reason for its upregulation
on HCV upon replication.
Activation of certain TLRs induces type I IFNs, which are
known to inhibit HCV infection. Upon binding with a specific
ligand, most TLRs recruit the common TLR adaptor MyD88,
which in turn recruits IRAK and TRAF6 proteins and triggers
MAPK and NF-kB signaling to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines [63,64]. Therefore, suppression of MyD88 and IRAK1
by inducible miR-21 attenuates antiviral immunity and renders
the immune response less effective.
Several viral proteins also counteract TLRs and their downstream signaling events. Measles virus and respiratory syncytial
virus inhibit TLR7-dependent and TLR9-dependent IFN signaling stimulated by resiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in
primary human plasmacytoid dendritic cells [65]. Here, we report
the novel regulation of TLR-MyD88 signaling by miRNA. First,
we found that HCV infection upregulated miR-21 expression in
hepatocytes. Second, we demonstrated that miR-21 suppresses
HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thereby promoting HCV
replication, and thus, demonstrating a novel mechanism for viral
immune evasion. Third, we demonstrated that both human
MyD88 and IRAK1 are targets of miR-21. In this new model of
HCV infection, HCV is first identified by TLRs and retinoic-acidFigure 11. Effects of other viruses on the regulation of miR-21 expression. (A) RD cells were transfected with miR-21 mimics or control RNA
(final concentration, 50 nM) and further treated with or without IFN-a (100 U/ml) 24 h later. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were infected
with EV71 (MOI = 1) for 2 h and then washed. Cells were harvested at 12 h post-infection. EV71 RNA levels were quantified by qPCR (upper panel), and
the viral VP1 protein expression was measured by Western blot (lower panel). (B) PBMCs were co-transfected with pNL4-3.luc.R-E- and miR-21 mimics
or control RNA (final concentration, 50 nM) for 24 h and treated with or without IFN-a (100 U/ml). Luciferase activity was then measured. (C) Huh7
cells were transfected with miRNA or control RNA as indicated (final concentration, 50 nM). After 24 h, cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 1) for 2 h
and washed before treatment with or without IFN-a (100 U/ml). Supernatants were harvested at 24 h post-infection and analyzed for VSV production
using standard plaque assays. (D) VSV and HIV, but not EV71 induced miR-21 expression. RD cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 1) for 6 h. Huh7 cells
were infected with VSV (MOI = 1) for 6 h. PBMCs were transfected with pNL-luc-E-R+ plasmids for 48 h. miR-21 expression was determined by qPCR.

MiR-21 Inhibits IFN Signaling via MyD88 and IRAK1
PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 April 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e1003248

inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), which in turn initiate type I IFN
production against HCV infection. Meanwhile, HCV infections
can also upregulated the expression of miR-21, which counteracted the IFN-mediated antiviral response by inhibiting TLRMyD88 signaling. Consistently, miR-21 overexpression stimulated
replication and production of HCV, VSV, HIV and EV71.
Intriguingly, unlike the other three viruses, levels of miR-21 were
not induced significantly by EV71 (Figure 11). As it has been
reported that EV71 fails to stimulate the expression of type I IFN
in mammalian cells [66], the upregulation of miR-21 expression
may not be required after EV71 infection. Induction of miR-21
expression may be a new survival strategy of the virus to escape the
antiviral immune response of the host.
The host response is the first line of immune defense against
viral pathogens, and it imposes several barriers that HCV must
subdue to replicate and persist. HCV evades the host response
through a complex combination of virus-host interactions that
disrupt intracellular signaling pathways and attenuate the antiviral
actions of IFN. Viral regulation of the host response impairs the
crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity and provides a
foundation for HCV replication and spreading. It is generally
thought that miRNAs target multiple mRNAs, termed the
targetome, to regulate gene expression. A single miRNA might
fine-tune the protein synthesis of thousands of genes directly or
indirectly [67]. In the present study, human MyD88 and IRAK1
were shown to be novel targets of miR-21, contributing to the
negative regulatory feedback function of miR-21 in TLR-MyD88
signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-21 may be
a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention; however,
this needs to be verified in future studies.
The interaction between the HCV and TLR/RIG-I pathways is
well documented, and expression of the HCV NS5A and NS3/4A
proteins may disrupt TLR-dependent and TLR-independent
signaling pathways, respectively. For example, the NS3/4A
protease disrupts the TLR3 and RIG-I cascades by cleaving the
essential adaptor proteins TRIF and mitochondrial antiviral
signaling protein (MAVS), respectively [45,68]. Furthermore, the
NS5A protein was shown to inhibit the TLR-MyD88 signaling
pathway through a direct interaction with the death domain of
MyD88 through the interferon sensitivity-determining region
(ISDR) [48]. In this study, we found that the functional
mechanism of miR-21 action through MyD88 and IRAK1, which
was also modulated by NS3/4A and NS5A protein expression,
could be another mechanism independent pathway of the TRIF
pathway for impairing the type I IFN-associated antiviral response
during HCV infection (Figure S7).
In conclusion, we have identified a virus-host interaction
pathway wherein HCV infection results in the stimulation of two
signaling pathways: the NS5A/PKCe/JNK/c-Jun pathway and
the NS3/4A/PKCa/ERK/c-Fos pathway. After infection, c-Jun
and c-Fos bind to the AP-1 binding sites in the miR-21 promoter
and evoke AP-1 mediated miR-21 induction, leading to the
silencing of MyD88 and IRAK1, which play a major role in the
initiation of the antiviral response in host cells and increased virus
production (Figure 12).

Cell culture and transfection
Huh7 human hepatoma and HEK293 human embryonic
kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate
at 37uC in 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (4.06105
cells/well) and grown to 80% confluence. Then, the cells were
seeded into 24-well plates (26105 cells/well) and incubated
overnight. Cells were subsequently transfected with Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of
expression of transfected HCV proteins were similar to those of
endogenous HCV proteins during peak viral expression (Figure
S9). Transfection with synthetic oligonucleotides did not exhibit
significant cytotoxicity, as revealed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, which showed no
significant differences in terms of growth and viability of the cells
that were not treated with any oligonucleotides and those cells that

were treated with 10–100 nM miR-21 mimics, miR-21 inhibitor,
or the control molecules.
HCV stock preparation
Huh7.5.1 cells were infected with HCV (JFH-1 strain;
MOI = 0.1–10) and propagated for 10 days. Stock virus was
prepared by collecting and filtering the cell culture supernatant.
Aliquots were stored at 280uC until use.
Isolation and culture of PBMCs
PBMCs were obtained from blood samples diluted with
pyrogen-free saline by Histopaque density centrifugation
(Haoyang Biotech Co. Ltd.). Cells were washed twice in saline
and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin. PBMCs were then seeded into 6-well
plates (16107
/plate), infected with HCV, and incubated at 37uC.
In vitro transcription
RNA was transcribed with a MEGAscriptTM t7 kit (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) and purified with a MEGS clear kit (Ambion)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. FL-J6/JFH-59C19Rluc2AUbi RNA was extracted by lithium chloride precipitation and
quantitated by UV light absorbance. Aliquots of RNA were stored
frozen at _80uC for further experiments.
Luciferase reporter assays
Both the full-length and a series of truncated miPPR-21
fragments were PCR-amplified from 293T genomic DNA using
the primers listed in Table S1. The fragments were then digested
by KpnI and XhoI and cloned into the KpnI/XhoI site of pGL3-
basic (Promega). The mutant miPPR-21 insets were generated by
site-directed mutagenesis using specific primers listed in Table S1,
and the experiment was performed as previously described [71].
Figure 12. Proposed model for the activation of miR-21 expression upon HCV infection and the role of miR-21 in the regulation of
the antiviral activity of type I IFN. During HCV infection, the virus is first recognized by TLRs and RIG-1, which in turn activates MyD88 and IRAK1
to initiate IFN-a synthesis, resulting in the activation of ISGs and the inhibition of HCV replication. In addition, miR-21 expression is activated during
HCV infection through two signaling pathways: the PKCe/JNK/c-Jun pathway and the PKCa/ERK/c-Fos pathway. The HCV NS5A protein activates PKCe
to enhance the expression of JNK and c-Jun, while the HCV NS3/4A complex stimulates PKCa to promote the production of ERK and c-Fos. The two
subunits (c-Jun and c-Fos) of AP-1 join together to recognize the miR-21 promoter and activate the expression of miR-21, which represses the
expression of MyD88 and IRAK1 via imperfect base pairing between miR-21 and the 39UTR of MyD88 and IRAK1. The reduction in MyD88 and IRAK1
causes a reduction of type-I IFN production and ISG expression that might contribute to viral pathogenesis and virus propagation.

MyD88 and IRAK1 39 UTR luciferase reporter constructs were
generated by cloning PCR-amplified human MyD88 or IRAK1
mRNA 39 UTR target sites into the XbaI site of pGL3-Basic
(Promega). Huh7 cells were cotransfected with the luciferase
reporter plasmid (80 ng), pRL-TK Renilla luciferase control
plasmid (40 ng), and the indicated RNAs (final concentration,
20 nM). After 24 h, luciferase activities were determined with the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized for
transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity with
that of Renilla luciferase.
RNA quantification
Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using the Roche
LightCycler 480 and SYBR RT-PCR kits (DBI Bioscience); each
20-ml reaction contained 0.5 mM of each PCR primer, 10 ml of
SYBR Green PCR master mix, 1 ml of diluted template, and
RNase-free water. Primers are shown in Table S2. Target gene
expression was normalized by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression.
Quantification of miRNAs and Pri-miRNA was performed by
qPCR using miRNA analysis kits (Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of pre-miRNA
was performed using Qiagen miScripte Precursor Assay (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The relative expression of miRNAs were normalized to that of
internal control U6 snRNA within each sample using the 22DDCt
method, and then standardized to the miRNA levels in mock
infected or control miRNA treated cells. [72].
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from Huh7 cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), treated with DNase I, and reverse-transcribed with
MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random primers
(Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). PCR was performed in 25-ml
reactions with the primers shown in Table S3. IFNAR1 and
IFNAR2 primers were the same as those used for qPCR (Table
S2). Target gene expression was normalized to that of the internal
control b-actin. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis
on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Huh7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (26105 cells/well,
0.5 ml volume), incubated overnight, and then transfected as
previously described. After 48 h, the cells were infected with HCV
for the indicated time periods. IFN-a level in the cell culture
medium were measured with an ELISA kit (PBL InterferonSource).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Western blot
analysis
ChIP assays were performed using reagents commercially
obtained from Upstate, essentially according to the manufacturer’s
instructions but with the following modifications. Huh7 cells were
cross-linked in 1% formaldehyder for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, the cells were lysed with 200 mL of SDSlysis buffer and the chromatin/DNA was sonicated to around
500 bp. Immunopreciptatins were performed by incubating
sheared chromatin (26106 cells) overnight at 4uC with 2 mg of
antibody followed by binding to 60 mL of salmon sperm DNA/
protein G Sepharose beads. The immunopreciptates were washed
and eluted in a solution containing of 1% SDS and 0.1 M
NaHCO3 and incubated overnight at 65uC with 20 mL of 5 M
NaCl for reverse cross-linking. DNA was purified with QIAquick
columns (Qiagen) and each fragment was PCR-amplified using the
primer pairs listed in Table S1.
Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with PBS
(pH 7.4) containing 0.01% Triton-100, 0.01% EDTA, and 10%
cocktail protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentration was
determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Redmond, WA BioRad). Cell lysates (100 mg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE
and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham,
Bucks, U.K.). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried
milk before incubating with target-specific antibodies. Protein
bands were detected with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent reagents
(Pierce).
Flow cytometry
MyD88 and IRAK1 39 UTR GFP constructs were generated by
cloning the PCR-amplified human MyD88 or IRAK1 mRNA 39
UTR target sites into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1
(Promega). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with control plasmids
(GFP-empty) or GFP-MyD88/IRAK1 39 UTR plasmids, together
with miR-21 mimics or nonspecific RNA oligonucleotides. At 24 h
post-transfection, cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
to determine mean fluorescence intensity and the percentage of
cells expressing GFP.
miRNA mimics and inhibitors
miR-21 mimics (double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides) and
miR-21 inhibitors (single-stranded chemically modified oligonucleotides) (final concentration, 50 nM; GuangZhou RiBo Biotech
Co. Ltd, GuangZhou, China) were transfected into Huh7 cells for
miR-21 overexpression and inhibition, respectively. Nonspecific
RNA mimics or inhibitors were transfected as negative controls.
They had similar chemical properties as the miR-21 mimics or
miR-21 inhibitor, respectively. All miRNAs were purchase from
RiboBio (GuangZhou Ribo Biotech Co. Ltd.).
RNA interference
All siRNAs and the control siRNA (si-Ctrl) were purchased
from RiboBio (GuangZhou RiBo Biotech Co. Ltd.).To knock
down IRF3, TRIF, HCV, MyD88 and IRAK1, the following
siRNAs were used: IRF3, 59- AGA CAU UCU GGA UGA
GUU A-39 [73]; TRIF, 59- GAC CAG ACG CCA CTC CAA C
-39 [74]; HCV, 59-CCT CAA AGA AAA ACC AAA CTT -39;

MyD88, 59-AAG GCA AUG AAG AAA GAG UUC-39;
nonspecific control sequence, 59-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC
ACG U-39 [76]. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All siRNAs were tested and verified to
reduce expression in Huh7 cells by Western blot analysis (.80%
protein reduction) or qPCR (.50% mRNA). Huh7 cells were
transfected with 50 nM of each siRNA 48 h before HCV
infection.
HCV yield qualification

previously described. Viral RNA in the cell culture medium was
isolated with the RNApure Virus Kit (CW Biotech), and HCV
RNA replicates were quantified by qPCR as previously
described.
