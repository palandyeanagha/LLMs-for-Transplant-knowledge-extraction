Background: The mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) receptor is dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and
tivantinib (ARQ 197) is an oral, selective, MET inhibitor.
Methods: This Phase-1b study assessed tivantinib safety as primary objective in patients with previously treated HCC and ChildPugh A or B liver cirrhosis. Patients received oral tivantinib 360 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Results: Among 21 HCC patients, common drug-related adverse events (AEs) were neutropaenia, anaemia, asthenia, leucopaenia,
anorexia, diarrhoea, and fatigue. No drug-related worsening of liver function or performance status occurred, but one Child-Pugh
B patient experienced drug-related bilirubin increase. Four patients had drug-related serious AEs, including one neutropaeniarelated death. Haematologic toxicities were more frequent than in previous tivantinib studies but were manageable with prompt
therapy. Best response was stable disease (median, 5.3 months) in 9 of 16 evaluable patients (56%). Median time to progression
was 3.3 months.
Conclusion: Tivantinib demonstrated a manageable safety profile and preliminary antitumour activity in patients with HCC and
Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis.
The current standard of care for patients with advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is systemic treatment with
sorafenib (Bruix and Sherman, 2011; EASL-EORTC, 2012;
Forner et al, 2012). Sorafenib significantly improved overall
survival compared with placebo in two large, randomised, phase
3 trials (Llovet et al, 2008; Cheng et al, 2009). There is no standard
therapy for patients who are intolerant of sorafenib or experience
disease progression after sorafenib treatment (NCCN, 2011).
The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/mesenchymal-epithelial
transition factor (MET) receptor tyrosine kinase pathway is
frequently dysregulated in human cancers and has a critical role
in the pathophysiology of HCC (Boix et al, 1994; Wang et al, 2001;
Xie et al, 2010). In HCC, activation of the HGF/MET pathway is
associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis
(Kaposi-Novak et al, 2006). Tivantinib (ARQ 197) is an oral,
selective, MET inhibitor that disrupts MET-dependent downstream signalling by inhibiting constitutive and HGF-mediated
MET phosphorylation (Munshi et al, 2010). Tivantinib inhibits
MET activation in human HCC and other tumour cell lines and
has demonstrated antitumour activity in human tumour xenograft
models (Munshi et al, 2010; Previdi et al, 2012; Salvi et al, 2007). In
clinical studies, tivantinib appears to be well tolerated and has
antitumour activity as monotherapy or in combination with other
agents (Rosen et al, 2011; Sequist et al, 2011; Yap et al, 2011).

In dose-escalation studies, the recommended phase 2 dose
(RP2D) of tivantinib was defined as 360 mg twice daily (BID)
(Rosen et al, 2011; Yap et al, 2011). However, these studies did not
include many patients with HCC and chronic liver disease, which
may affect drug metabolism (Verbeeck, 2008). This phase 1 study
evaluated the safety of tivantinib in patients with documented
HCC and liver cirrhosis, focusing especially on the effect of
tivantinib on liver function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Adult patients (X18 years of age) with histologically or
cytologically confirmed advanced HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver
Cancer (BCLC) stage A–C (Forner et al, 2012), and Child-Pugh A
cirrhosis with no clinical ascites were eligible (see Online
Supplementary Information for additional eligibility requirements). The protocol was later amended to include patients with
Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (without ascites at physical examination)
and to allow validated non-pathologic HCC diagnosis ((Bruix and
Sherman, 2005; Forner et al, 2008). This open-label, single-arm
study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00802555) was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical
practice, and all patients provided written informed consent.
Study design and treatment. Oral tivantinib (360 mg BID) was
administered 1 h before or 2 h after eating in 28-day treatment
cycles. Dose reductions (up to 2) were allowed in patients with
grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events (AEs) with no dose
re-escalation (see Online Supplementary Information). The
primary objective was safety, with the goal of defining the RP2D
in cirrhotic HCC patients. If during the first month of treatment no
more than two of 25 patients experienced a drug-related decrease
in liver function, hepatic AE, or two-point decline in performance
status, 360 mg BID would be the RP2D (see Online Supplementary
Information). Secondary objectives included time to progression
(TTP), objective response rate, disease control rate, and tivantinib
pharmacokinetics.
Patient assessments. Adverse events were assessed using National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0 (CTCAE, 2006). Clinically significant laboratory
abnormalities were reported as AEs. The efficacy population
included all patients who received at least one complete cycle of
therapy and had at least one post-baseline tumour assessment.
Tumour response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumours version 1.1 every 8 weeks until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or study withdrawal.
Pharmacokinetic assessments. Blood samples (6 ml) for 24 h
pharmacokinetic analysis were collected on study days 1/2 and
15/16 (see Online Supplementary Information). Plasma concentration-time data were analysed by non-compartmental methods
using WinNonLin 4.0 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View,
CA, USA).
Statistical analysis. Data were analysed using standard statistical
methods (see Online Supplementary Information).
RESULTS
Demographics and baseline characteristics. Twenty-one patients
were enrolled between March 2009 and November 2010, of whom
19 (91%) had received previous sorafenib therapy and seven had
received more than one previous therapy. Demographics and
baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Four patients
had Child-Pugh B status (with p8 points), eight had distant
metastases, and seven had vascular invasion at study entry.
Median baseline plasma alpha-fetoprotein level was 234 ng ml  1
(range, 2–63,918 ng ml  1) and was higher than 200 ng ml  1 in 11
patients.
Treatment duration and dose modifications. At time of analysis,
all patients had discontinued study treatment: 17 (81%) because of
radiographic or clinical disease progression, and four (19%)
because of AEs. Overall, 16 patients (76%) received at least two
cycles of study drug (range, 1–15 cycles), and median treatment
duration was 1.8 months (range, 0.1–15.9 months). Nine patients
(43%) were treated for 42 months; two patients continued to

receive treatment for 1.5 months and 424 months, respectively,
after confirmed radiographic disease progression because of
continued clinical benefit. Five patients (24%) required tivantinib
dose reductions because of AEs, and eight (38%) required dose
interruptions (o2 weeks) because of AEs and subsequently were
able to resume treatment at the same dose.
Safety and tolerability. All patients received at least one dose
of tivantinib and were evaluable for safety. The most common
drug-related AEs were neutropaenia, anaemia, leucopaenia,
asthenia, anorexia, diarrhoea, and fatigue (Table 2). Grade 3 or
greater drug-related AEs were observed in 11 patients (52%),
including neutropaenia in eight patients (38%). Neutropaenia was
the primary reason for dose reduction, interruption, or
discontinuation.
Serious AEs that were definitely, probably, or possibly related to
tivantinib in the opinion of the investigator were reported in four
patients (19%). These included grade 3 anaemia (n ¼ 1); grade 3
anaemia and grade 4 neutropaenia (n ¼ 1); grade 4 leucopaenia
and grade 4 neutropaenia (n ¼ 1); and grade 4 leucopaenia, grade 4
neutropaenia, and grade 5 septic shock (n ¼ 1). Septic shock
secondary to neutropaenia was the only drug-related AE leading to
death.
A total of 77 myelosuppression events considered related to
study drug were reported in 14 patients. Additionally, four cardiac
events were reported that were considered possibly or probably
related to study drug. No patient experienced drug-related
worsening of liver function or decreased Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status during the first cycle, except
for one patient with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis who experienced
elevated bilirubin that was considered possibly drug related.
Pharmacokinetics. The plasma concentration-time profile of
tivantinib was characterised by mean peak levels occurring 4 h and
2 h post dose on days 1 and 15, respectively (Supplementary Figure
S1). However, considerable interpatient variability (coefficient of
variation range, 43–73%) was observed in tivantinib pharmacokinetic
parameters (Supplementary Table S1). Significant tivantinib accumulation in plasma was observed after multiple oral doses.
Tumour response. Sixteen of 21 patients (46%) were evaluable for
tumour response. Among five non-evaluable patients (24%), three
had no post-therapy tumour assessment and two had not
completed one full cycle of treatment at the time of confirmed
disease progression. No objective responses were reported. Best
response of stable disease was observed in nine of 16 evaluable
patients (56%; Figure 1). A tumour reduction of B20% was
observed in one patient who experienced prolonged stable disease.
Median TTP was 3.3 months (range, 1.7–5.3 months) in the
evaluable population (Supplementary Figure S2) and 1.8 months
(range, 1.6–5.3 months) in the intent-to-treat population.
DISCUSSION
Oral tivantinib was found to have a manageable safety profile
(based on prospectively defined liver function criteria) and
preliminary antitumour activity in patients with HCC and ChildPugh A or B liver cirrhosis (up to 7 points), and 360 mg BID was
considered the RP2D in this patient population. These results are
encouraging and support further investigation of tivantinib in this
setting. Neutropaenia, which occurred primarily within the first 30
days of treatment, was generally manageable with prompt dose
modification, growth factors, and antibiotics. However, the
frequency of grade 3 or greater neutropaenia (38%) was higher
than in previous single-agent, phase 1, dose-ranging studies, in
which grade 3 or greater neutropaenia occurred in o5% of
patients (Rosen et al, 2011; Yap et al, 2011). Moreover, one patient
in the current study died from septic shock secondary to
neutropaenia. In a subsequent phase 2 study in previously treated
patients with HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, the tivantinib dose
was reduced to 240 mg BID and a modified dose-reduction schema
was implemented because of grade 3 or greater neutropaenia
(Santoro et al, 2012).
Pharmacokinetic data indicated plasma accumulation of
tivantinib after multiple doses, with an area under the plasma
concentration-time curve among HCC patients approximately
two-fold higher than in patients with other solid tumours, but
there was high interpatient variability. Although data are limited,
there was no indication of a link between drug-related AEs and
dose, tivantinib exposure, or Child-Pugh status, or a link between
baseline demographic variables and tivantinib exposure. However,
a population pharmacokinetics analysis subsequently showed that
tivantinib exposure correlated with the incidence of grade 3 or
greater neutropaenia (Zahir et al, 2012). These findings are
consistent with evidence that tivantinib is extensively metabolised
in the liver (Bagai et al, 2010; Bathala et al, 2012). Thus, a tivantinib
dose of 240 mg BID with careful monitoring of haematologic toxicity
is recommended in HCC patients with liver cirrhosis.
