ABSTRACT
Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is an established
therapeutic option for chronic disease resulting
from end-stage organ dysfunction. Long-term use
of immunosuppression is associated with posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), placing
patients at increased risk of infections, cardiovascular disease and mortality. The incidence rates for
PTDM have varied from 10 to 40% between different studies. Diagnostic criteria have evolved
over the years, as a greater understating of PTDM
has been reached. There are differences in pathophysiology and clinical course of type 2 diabetes
and PTDM. Hence,managing this condition can be
a challenge for a diabetes physician, as there are
several factors to consider when tailoring therapy
for post-transplant patients to achieve better glycaemic as well as long-term transplant outcomes.
This article is a detailed review of PTDM, examining the pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and
management in light of the current evidence. The
therapeutic options are discussed in the context of
their safety and potential drug-drug interactions
with immunosuppressive agents.

Key Summary Points
Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus
(PTDM) is a known complication of solid
organ transplantation.
PTDM is associated with infections,
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
There is an overlap of risk factors for type 2
diabetes mellitus and PTDM; however, the
pathophysiology and clinical course are
different; hence, it is important to be
aware of PTDM and understand how it is
diagnosed and treated.
Treatment strategies should be tailored to
the individual.
There are opportunities for prevention of
PTDM by modifying risk factors.

INTRODUCTION
Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is now an
established and routine therapeutic option that
has transformed the survival and quality of life
of patients with end-organ dysfunction [1]. It
however requires the long-term use of
immunosuppression with inherent morbidity
that may affect transplant outcomes. These
include post-transplant diabetes mellitus
(PTDM), hyperlipidaemia and hypertension,
placing patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. PTDM is also associated with reduced kidney graft survival [2, 3]
and infections [4, 5]. Emphasis has been placed
on trying to identify those patients who are at
risk of PTDM to improve their outcomes. Furthermore, improvements in immunosuppressive protocols have seen a decline in the rates of
PTDM.
There have been changes in the nomenclature of PTDM over the past 50 years. More
recently, it was known as new onset diabetes
after transplantation (NODAT). However, it was
thought that this terminology implied that
diabetes mellitus was excluded prior to transplantation and only developed subsequently. As
many centres did not screen patients prior to
transplantation at the time, this nomenclature
was misleading. Therefore following on from
the International Consensus Meeting in 2013,
the first recommendation was to change the
terminology back to PTDM, as it was originally
known [6]. This is a more inclusive term for
diabetes that is diagnosed after transplantation
without specific reference to any previous history of diabetes. The consensus provided a
streamlined guidance for PTDM to align the
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced in
management of this condition.
This article aims to review the current literature on PTDM to provide guidance on the
diagnosis, prevention and management. It is
based on previously conducted studies and does
not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the
authors.
DIAGNOSIS
Historically, there has been a lack of clear
guidance on the criteria to diagnose PTDM. The
early definition was simply based on a need for
insulin or oral therapy after transplantation
leading to considerable under-diagnosis of the
condition. Previous consensus reports in 2003
[7] and 2005 [8] recommended the use of the
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to be performed twice according to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) criteria. In 2012 the
American Diabetes Association and WHO added
HbA1c as a test for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) (Table 1) [9].
The differences in pathophysiology between
type 2 diabetes and PTDM suggest the same
criteria may not simply be applied to both
conditions. This led to the International Consensus Meeting in 2013, which aimed to address
these issues and provide a clearer directive. The
consensus recommends delaying the screening
and diagnosis of PTDM until at least 45 days
after transplantation to allow for immunosuppression levels to be stabilized [6]. OGTT is the
gold standard for diagnosis as this method is
able to identify more patients with PTDM than
fasting glucose alone [10, 11]. The difference in
pathophysiology between type 2 diabetes mellitus and PTDM means that the detection of
PTDM is higher using OGTT [12, 13].
A further advantage of an OGTT is being able
to diagnose impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),
which is an independent risk factor for longterm development of PTDM, CVD and mortality
both prior to transplantation and after

[2, 14, 15]. A recent review from Jenssen et al.
recommended the use of an OGTT, 2 months
post-SOT [16]. Furthermore, they recommend if
resources are limited, the OGTT, which can be
time consuming, may be reserved for patients
with a HbA1C [5.7% (39 mmol/mol) as this
method will detect 90% of all individuals with
PTDM whilst administering an OGTT in only
half of the patients who have had a transplant
[10, 17].
The use of HbA1c to diagnose PTDM has also
attracted controversy. In 2012, both the ADA
and WHO advocated the use of HbA1c as the
primary test to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in the 2014 consensus report it
was decided that HbA1c should not be the sole
criterion and must be used with caution in the
post-transplantation phase. In particular, a
HbA1c done within the first 12 months of
transplantation may underestimate PTDM and
needs further tests for corroboration [6]. The
fallacies of using HbA1c early post-transplantation are due to the effects of post-transplant
anaemia on red blood cell turnover as well as
dynamic renal allograft function. Janssen et al.
suggest that HbA1c could be an adequate diagnostic tool however in a stable phase such as
1 year after transplantation [16]. Although the
2014 consensus report has streamlined the
diagnosis of PTDM there still needs to be further
evidence to establish which tests to use at which
time and perhaps a combination of HbA1C,
OGTT ± fasting/random glucose could be
used C 45 days after transplantation (Table 2).
There is no consensus as to when the end
date for diagnosis of PTMD should be. However,
it is thought that actual PTDM occurs within
6 months of transplantation as a result of the
high doses of induction and maintenance
immunosuppression during this period. It is
interesting that 6 months after transplantation
the annual incidence of diabetes is similar to
those on the waiting list (approximately 6%)
[18]. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish
whether this diabetes is transplant-related or
whether it is type 2 DM that would have
occurred despite transplantation. Furthermore,
perhaps emphasis should be placed on excluding DM prior to transplantation as the disease
process and outcomes in PTDM are different to
type 2 DM. This may also guide the choice of
immunosuppressive agents.
INCIDENCE
There is considerable variation in the reported
incidence of PTDM reflecting the considerable
heterogeneity in reports due to a historical lack
of diagnostic criteria, length of follow-up, type
of organ transplanted and immunosuppressive
regimen. The reported rates of PTDM after kidney transplantation are 10–40% [19] (Fig. 1).
Vincenti et al. reported an incidence of 20.5% at
6 months after renal transplantation [17]. After
heart transplantation, when OGTT has been
used as the diagnostic criterion, the incidence
has been reported at 20–28% at 5 years [20–22].
However, 5 years after liver transplantation the
incidence of PTDM is reported at almost 40%

[23, 24]. PTDM after lung transplantation has
an accumulated incidence of 20–40% [16].
There has however been a decline in the incidence of PTDM, which may be related to the
refinement of modern immunosuppression
protocols and the embracement of revised
diagnostic criteria. In studies using OGTT for
diagnosis, the incidence of PTDM after kidney
transplantation in 1995 was 18% [25], which
has reduced to 11% in 2012 [26].
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PTDM
The pathophysiology of PTDM is multifactorial.
Throughout this discussion, we will consider
risk factors for the development of disease, preand post-transplantation, in addition to factors
associated with the allograft itself (Fig. 2).
Pre-Transplantation Risk Factors
PTDM is more likely to occur in patients with
pre-existing risk factors for the development of
type 2 DM including increased age, family
history of type 2 diabetes, high-risk ethnicities
and obesity. The incidence of PTDM is considerably higher in patients of African-American,
Asian and Hispanic ethnicity, recipients aged [
40 years and those with a BMI [ 30 kg/m2
[27, 28].
Genetic Risk Factors
Studies have demonstrated an association
between single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in candidate genes implicated in the
pathogenesis of non-transplant-associated diabetes mellitus and the development of PTDM.
One study demonstrated that polymorphisms
in the HNF-4A gene and the insulin receptor
substrate 1 gene were significantly associated
with the development of PTDM in renal allograft recipients of Hispanic ethnicity [29].
Additional SNPs that increase the risk of PTDM
have been found in genes including TCF7L2,
KCNJ11-Kir6.2, IL and NFATc4 [29–32]. Patients
carrying multiple predisposing SNPs have a
greater risk of PTDM.

OGTT as the gold standard for diagnosis

Pre-Transplantation Medical Comorbidities
Pre-transplantation medical comorbidities have
been shown to influence the risk of PTDM
development. In particular, hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection, cystic fibrosis (CF) and polycystic kidney disease (PCKD) are thought to
increase the risk of diabetes after transplantation [33].
HCV infection is recognised to have a predisposition to the development of diabetes in nontransplant patients. Furthermore, evidence suggests that HCV infection increases the risk of
PTDM [34]. A meta-analysis of liver-transplant
recipients demonstrated that the prevalence of
PTDM in HCV-positive patients was higher than
the prevalence in HCV-negative patients [34].
HCV infection has also been shown to be a risk
factor for the development of PTDM in patients
after renal transplantation [35]. Studies investigating the pathogenesis of PTDM have shown
that HCV-positive organ recipients have significantly reduced insulin sensitivity compared with
matched HCV-negative recipients. Conversely,
HCV infection has not been shown to influence
insulin secretion or hepatic insulin uptake [36].
Transplantation-Associated Risk Factors
Allograft-associated factors, including graft
type, have been shown to affect the incidence of
PTDM. It is well established that deceased donor
allografts express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with living donor
allografts, and it has been hypothesised that the
resulting proinflammatory state predisposes to
the development of PTDM. This is supported by
markedly increased rates of PTDM in recipients
of deceased donor grafts compared with living
donor grafts, with some studies demonstrating a
relative risk of nearly four [37].
Post-Transplantation Risk Factors
Post-transplantation risk factors include the
immunosuppressive regimen used for induction
and maintenance, cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection and episodes of rejection.
Steroids
Corticosteroids have a dual role in transplant
immunosuppression. High-dose steroids are
used in the induction of immunosuppression
perioperatively and lower and tapering doses
are used for long-term maintenance therapy.
Corticosteroids are well known to cause
hyperglycaemia and predispose to the development of diabetes. The mechanisms underlying
corticosteroid-induced diabetes include
Fig. 2 Risk factors for PTDM. HCV hepatitis C virus, PCKD polycystic kidney disease, CNI calcineurin inhibitor, mTOR
mammalian target of rapamycin, CMV cytomegalovirus
Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801 783

impaired insulin sensitivity, increased hepatic
gluconeogenesis and appetite stimulation with
resulting weight gain. As the hyperglycaemic
effect of glucocorticoids is dose-dependent,
induction protocols have a greater diabetogenic
potential than long-term maintenance doses
[33]. Trials of early steroid discontinuation postoperatively have shown limited success in
reducing rates of PTDM with marginal non-significant rates of efficacy [27, 38]. High-dose
steroid pulses are also given during the maintenance phase to treat rejection episodes. These
can precipitate the onset of diabetes.
Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNIs)
CNIs currently form the mainstay of most
immunosuppressive regimens for the prevention of organ rejection. The two main CNIs
include tacrolimus and cyclosporine. Extensive
evidence supports the efficacy of CNIs in the
prevention of immunological rejection but
have highlighted adverse effects including predisposition to the development of PTDM. The
diabetogenic potential of CNIs varies between
medications and evidence suggests that tacrolimus is more diabetogenic than cyclosporine. A
large meta-analysis of renal transplantation
patients, comparing data from 30 randomised
control trials, demonstrated that tacrolimus was
more efficacious at preventing graft loss and
acute rejection than cyclosporine. However, the
incidence of insulin-treated diabetes was greater
in the patients receiving tacrolimus, at 1 year
following transplantation (RR 1.86) and
increased with higher doses of tacrolimus
(p = 0.003) [39].
CNIs are thought to promote the development of PTDM through multiple mechanisms.
CNIs have been shown to impair insulin secretion in clinical studies of patients receiving
tacrolimus [40]. Both animal and human studies, analysing pancreatic histology sections,
have demonstrated increased islet cell apoptosis
and decreased beta cell mass in groups receiving
CNIs [41, 42].
At a molecular level, calcineurin is thought
to play an important role in the survival of beta
cells in the pancreas through the activation of
the transcription factors nuclear factor of
activated T-cells (NFAT) and cAMP response
element binding protein (CREB) (Fig. 3).
CREB is believed to mediate the proliferative
effects of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and
transgenic mice that express a dominant negative CREB protein develop diabetes with apoptosis of beta cells secondary to reduced insulin
receptor substrate (IRS2) expression [43]. Studies
in animal models suggest that NFAT also stimulates IRS2 transcription and CNIs are thought
to downregulate IRS2 expression through the
inhibition of both NFAT and CREB [44]. Current
data suggest that IRS2 stimulates insulin secretion via the P13K/Akt pathway. Supporting
evidence includes studies where calcineurin
inhibition has been shown to reduce Akt phosphorylation in both murine and human islets
[44].
Mixed evidence exists regarding the effect of
CNIs on peripheral insulin sensitivity. In vitro
analyses suggest that therapeutic levels of
cyclosporine and tacrolimus inhibit glucose
uptake into adipose cells through the stimulation of endocytosis of GLUT 4 transporters from
the cell surface [45]. Conversely, clinical studies
have failed to demonstrate a significant in vivo
effect of CNIs on insulin sensitivity. Rickels
et al. investigated insulin sensitivity in patients
after islet cell transplantation using an insulinmodified IV glucose tolerance test. The results
revealed no significant difference in insulin
sensitivity among the three groups tested (islet
cell transplant patients immunosuppressed
with CNIs, type 1 diabetic patients and healthy
controls) [46]. Further clinical studies are
required to clarify the in vivo relevance of CNIs
on insulin sensitivity.
Electrolyte abnormalities associated with
tacrolimus use are thought to increase the risk
of hyperglycaemia and PTDM. Hypomagnesaemia is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus
use and has been identified as an independent
risk factor for insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia [47]. Van Laecke et al. have demonstrated that hypomagnesaemia within the first
month post-transplant was associated with the
development of PTDM [48].
784 Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Inhibitors
(mTORi)
mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, are used in
several immunosuppressive regimens both with
and without CNIs. Extensive clinical evidence
suggests that sirolimus is an independent risk
factor for the development of PTDM. A large
retrospective 10-year study found sirolimus
therapy to be as important a risk factor for the
development of PTDM as obesity or older age
and demonstrated an interactive effect with
concomitant CNI therapy [49]. The diabetogenic effect of sirolimus may be lower than that
of CNIs and case reports suggest that conversion
to sirolimus from CNIs improved glycaemic
control in patients with PTDM [50].
mTOR inhibitors are thought to influence
the development of PTDM via multiple mechanisms, including impaired insulin secretion
and reduced insulin signal transduction (Fig. 2).
Like CNIs, mTOR inhibitors have been shown to
induce apoptosis of rat and human pancreatic
islet cells in vitro [51]. Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that sirolimus impairs pancreatic
ductal proliferation and reduces ductal cell
numbers in culture. This evidence translated to
impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
in mice treated with sirolimus [52].
The effect of mTOR inhibitors on insulin signalling is thought to be of a greater importance
that the effect on insulin secretion. Like CNIs,
mTOR inhibitors act on the insulin receptor-IRSPI3K-Akt pathway. Evidence has shown that stimulation of the mTOR-containing complex
(mTORC1) is required for the activation of Akt and
the resulting simulation of protein synthesis.
Through binding to mTOR, sirolimus stimulates
the phosphorylation and inhibition of IRS-1 leading to the inhibition of P13K/Akt signalling [33].
Support for this model comes from animal
studies where it has been shown that treatment
with sirolimus results in a dose-dependent
increase in hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, in response to oral glucose challenge,
suggesting impaired insulin sensitivity [41].
Furthermore, sirolimus has been shown to

suppress Akt phosphorylation secondary to
insulin secretion [53] and interfere with the
phosphorylation of mTORC2, reducing insulinmediated inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis
[54]. Some human studies have not reported an
effect of sirolimus on insulin sensitivity
including a study in healthy, slim individuals
[55]. These negative results have led to the
question of whether underlying susceptibility to
type 2 diabetes, which is common after transplantation, is required for the pathogenesis of
disease in the context of sirolimus therapy.
CMV Infection
CMV is an opportunistic infection associated
with transplantation and immunosuppression.
Evidence that CMV infection plays a role in the
pathogenesis of PTDM is mixed but larger metaanalyses and observation suggest that CMV
infection is an independent risk factor for the
development of PTDM. One meta-analysis
included results from 1389 renal transplant
recipients and found that CMV-positive
patients had a relative risk of 1.94 of developing
PTDM compared with CMV-negative patients
[56]. Possible mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effects of CMV infection include
CMV-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta
cell or the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, but further work is required to
investigate these mechanisms further [33].
Rejection
Rejection after transplantation has been shown
to predispose to the development of PTDM. A
large study calculated a hazard ratio of 3.7 of
developing PTDM in patients with acute cellular
rejection [57]. However, these results are hard to
interpret as it is difficult to disentangle the
effects of rejection versus the effects of anti-rejection therapy, which involves high-dose steroid pulses and increased CNIs.
In conclusion, many factors influence an
individual’s risk for the development of PTDM.
Identification and optimisation of risk factors
before transplantation and early post-transplant
are vital to prevent the onset of PTDM and
improve glycaemic control once established. An
awareness and identification of high-risk
individuals can lead to early recognition,
prompt diagnosis and effective therapy, which
contributes to improved quality of life, extended graft life and reduced mortality.
COMPLICATIONS OF PTDM
Graft and Patient Survival
Several studies have shown that PTDM is associated with greater mortality, reduced survival
[58–62], poor graft outcomes [61–63] and deathcensored graft failure [62]. The increased rate of
mortality has been attributed to cardiovascular
events [5, 60, 63], increased risk of opportunistic infections and sepsis-related mortality
[5, 63]. In one study, rates of death and graft
loss were shown to be lower in patients with
PTDM than without [38].
A later observational study examining the
relationship among PTDM patients treated with
medications, PTDM patients managed without
medications and those without diabetes, on
overall survival and survival with a functioning
graft, showed no significant difference in allograft survival, death-censored allograft failure
among these groups; but drug-treated PTDM
was independently associated with shorter
patient survival with a functioning allograft,
higher all-cause mortality and death [64].
There is a recognizable trend for later studies to
show better graft survival and mortality rates
because of the following factors: change in the
diagnostic criteria for PTDM, more efficacious
immunosuppression, greater awareness of this
condition leading to earlier detection and treatment, a greater variety of glucose-lowering agents
available and pro-active management of PTDM.
Many of the studies are limited in their
ability to give conclusive answers because of
small sample sizes or short follow-up times or
inherent designs.
Microvascular Complications
De novo nephropathy has been described in
transplant kidneys following development of
PTDM [65, 66]. A recently published
786 Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801

longitudinal study has shown that patients with
PTDM develop long-term microvascular complications of neuropathy, nephropathy of a
milder form compared with type 1 and type 2
DM [67].
MANAGEMENT
Prevention
Strict attention to diabetes reduction strategies
will reduce individual patient morbidity, costs
in the management of diabetes and improve
long-term quality of life (QoL), patient and graft
survival.
Despite the importance of PTDM as a major
cause of post-transplant morbidity, mortality,
increased cost and patient anxiety, there is a
paucity of randomised controlled trials exploring interventions that can attenuate the development of diabetes in these metabolically highrisk post-transplant recipients.
The cardiometabolic milieu of transplantation patients is different from that of the general population because of immunosuppressant
side effects, weight gain and fatigue being more
common post-transplantation.
Diet, Physical Activity, Lifestyle Intervention
Transplantation poses many metabolic challenges to the recipient: changes in energy
expenditure, hormonal and fluid/electrolyte
changes and the effects of immunosuppressive
therapy. Low glycaemic diet in non-transplant
patients with type 2 DM and hypertension is
associated with lower micro- and macrovascular
complications [68, 69]. In post-transplant
patients, there is no published randomized
controlled trial (RCT) that has explored dietary
changes to the incidence of PTDM.
In the Diabetes Prevention Programme
(DPP), lifestyle intervention has been shown to
delay the onset of diabetes by 58% and this
effect can persist for at least 10 years [70]. In
kidney transplant recipients, lifestyle intervention can reduce the incidence and ameliorate
existing glucose intolerance or PTDM [71].
Weight gain in the range of 6–10 kg is common in the first 6 months after kidney
transplantation [72]. Early dietetic intervention,
recommendation for an exercise programme
and weight loss advice would be beneficial.
Patients with a BMI [30 should be encouraged
to lose weight before surgery.
Post-transplant weight gain, particularly visceral fat gain, increases the risk of developing
PTDM, dyslipidaemia and CVD [72]. Hence,
lifestyle modification including dietetic input
and weight loss advice should be part of routine
care for patients with PTDM.
Treatment of Hypomagnesaemia
Hypomagnesaemia associated with CNI treatment is a known risk factor for PTDM. Randomized controlled trials have so far not
conclusively proven that oral magnesium supplementation in the post-transplant period
improves insulin resistance or secretion [73, 74].
Further research through large prospective
studies is required to ascertain whether correction of hypomagnesaemia would prevent
PTDM.
Treatment of CMV and HCV Infection
Gursoy et al. have shown that HCV-infected
patients who did not receive interferon (IFN)
had a higher frequency rate of PTDM [75]. CMV
prophylaxis with valganciclovir has not shown
any effect on incidence of PTDM [76].
Gut Microbiome
It has been shown experimentally in SpragueDawley rats that probiotic use can reverse
hyperglycaemia by reversing the altered biodiversity associated with tacrolimus and sirolimus
use [77]. It has yet to be proven experimentally
in humans and is an area for further research.
Pharmacotherapy
Metformin has been shown to improve tacrolimus/sirolimus-induced hyperglycaemia in
Sprague-Dawley rats and reduces exocrine
apoptosis [53]. It has also been shown to
improve glucose intolerance caused by sirolimus in genetically heterogeneous HET3 mice
[78].
Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma
(PPARc) receptor activation with rosiglitazone
Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801 787

has been shown to attenuate glucose intolerance induced by sirolimus in rats [79].
Hecking et al. showed that use of isophane
insulin in the immediate-post-operative phase
was associated with 73% lower odds of developing PTDM (odds ratio, 0.27) in comparison to
a control group, which consisted of patients
who were treated with short-acting insulin ±
oral agents. The treatment group showed better
b-cell function throughout the 1-year follow-up
and were insulin independent [80]. It was
hypothesized that insulin therapy afforded
beta-cell protection by reducing glucotoxicity
and associated apoptosis.
A placebo-controlled RCT showed non-significant decrease in the 2-h plasma glucose with
vildagliptin and pioglitazone [81].
Individualized Immunosuppressive Therapy
Modern immunosuppression should be individualized taking into consideration specific
factors that could be modulated for optimum
outcomes. Diabetes prevention is one such
important factor. It has been proposed that
cyclosporine should be considered for
immunosuppression in patients with a greater
diabetes risk due to a reduced risk in causing
PTDM compared with tacrolimus [82]. However, over time glucose intolerance begins to
manifest even with cyclosporine therapy [83].
Conversion from a CNI to sirolimus in
patients could significantly improve the metabolic parameters of patients with PTDM, without increasing the risk of acute rejection [50].
A Cochrane review of 83 studies that
involved 16,156 participants did not show any
difference among CNI withdrawal, low-dose
CNI and standard regimes on the incidence of
diabetes [84].
A meta-analysis, examining 11,337 patients
from 56 randomized controlled trials, demonstrates that all evaluated protocols (CNI avoidance, minimization and delayed introduction)
are effective in improving renal function without increasing the incidence of rejection. CNIsparing protocols were not associated with different rates of PTDM compared with CNI-based
regimens when 38 studies (n = 7305) were
analysed. However, eight studies (n = 2943) that
specifically utilized current diagnostic
guidelines for PTDM demonstrated reduced
rates of PTDM with reduced exposure CNI [85].
A recent post hoc analysis from two large multicentre trials have shown no difference in the
incidence or severity of PTDM with early conversion from a cyclosporine-based regimen to
everolimus or in the progression of pre-existing
diabetes [86].
A Cochrane review looking at 5 studies
involving 521 patients, comparing belatacept
with other CNIs in kidney transplant patients
has shown a lower incidence of PTDM with
belatacept. Belatacept-treated patients had a
better graft function, better blood pressure and
lipid profile [87].
Glycaemic Management
In the peritransplant phase in the hospital,
hyperglycaemia is attributed to induction
agents, steroids and underlying recipient diabetogenic morbidity, and glycemia is usually
well controlled with insulin therapy. The diagnosis of PTDM may be delayed until after discharge, when the patient is stable and
immunosuppression is reduced to maintenance
doses, with stable allograft function without
infections. This review will cover outpatient
management, with the currently available
pharmacotherapy (Table 3). We propose a flow
diagram for the glycaemic management of
patients after transplant surgery, based on our
experience (Fig. 4).
Metformin
There is no particular algorithm agreed by
consensus for the management of PTDM.
Metformin, a first-line therapy for treatment
of type 2 diabetes in non-transplant patients has
been used for treatment of PTDM [9]. Metformin exerts pleiotropic actions beyond its
glucose-lowering agent effect leading to several
clinical benefits including anti-neoplastic, cardiovascular protection, lipid-lowering benefits,
anti-inflammatory and attenuation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and anti-endothelial
function [88].
Weight gain is common among organ
recipients, with average weight gains of 8–14 kg

in the first-year post-transplantation [89]. A
recent Cochrane review and meta-analysis,
which included randomized controlled trials of
over 12-week duration [90], found metformin to
be weight neutral compared with placebo or
diet in the general population. Compared with
sulphonylureas, metformin had a weighted
mean difference in weight of * 2.9 kg (95% CI
- 4.4 to - 1.1).
Fig. 4 Flow diagram depicting proposed glycaemic management after transplant surgery
790 Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801

In the post-transplant phase, with delayed
graft function, infections and the use of contrast
agents, the use of metformin could be associated
with lactic acidosis. Hence, caution is advised
especially at times of critical illness as it can be
associated with 30% mortality [91]. However, a
large registry analysis in the USA of 47,000
patients showed that there was no difference in
patient or allograft survival between metformin
users and non-users [92]. A small retrospective
study of metformin safety and effectiveness in
renal transplant patients has not shown a significant of side effects or change in HbA1c after
16.4 months of metformin use [93].
Metformin is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine. Though it is a
substrate for multiple transporters in the gut,
liver and kidney, i.e. plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), organic cation
transporter (OCT) 1–3 and multidrug and toxin
extrusion transporter (MATE)-1 and -2 K, it does
not cause any drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents [94].
Sulphonylureas and Glinides
Sulphonylureas and glinides provide their
therapeutic action by stimulating pancreatic
insulin secretion. Sulphonylureas can be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and
loss of durability after prolonged use [95, 96].
All sulphonylureas except for gliquidone are
excreted by the kidney; there is the potential
risk of prolonged hypoglycaemia in the context
of renal insufficiency [97]. Long-acting agents
such as glibenclamide should be avoided in
view of this risk. The Glinides, repaglinide and
nateglinide, on the other hand, are shorter
acting and are eliminated extensively by the
liver. They are a substrate for the enzyme
inducers CYP3A4, -2C8 CYP2C9, -3A4 and the
intestinal transporter TP1B1 (OATP1B1);
thereby, concomitant CNI use can increase the
risk of exposure to these agents. Despite these
theoretical risks, clinically significant risk has
not been noted with repaglinide [98].
Glitazones
The glitazones work by increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in muscle and
adipose tissue along with lowering circulating
and hepatic free fatty acids (FFA). Dose adjustment is not required in renal impairment. Both
rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been shown
to be effective in the management of PTDM in
small studies [99, 100]. The significant side
effect profile of oedema, weight gain and
increased fracture risk, which is inherently high
in patients after transplantation [101], makes
them less favourable agents for therapy in
PTDM.
Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors
DDP-4 inhibitors act by increasing the half-life
of the native incretin hormones GLP-1 and
gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) by inhibiting the degradation by inhibition of the enzyme
DPP-4 in a glucose-dependant manner. All the
DDP-4 inhibitors expect linagliptin are excreted
by the kidney and require dose adjustment in
renal impairment. They have been found to be
effective and safe in the treatment of PTDM
[102]. Sitagliptin has been shown to be effective
and safe in short-term retrospective studies
[103, 104].
Vildagliptin has been shown to significantly
and safely lower HbA1c and 2-h plasma glucose
in a phase II, placebo-controlled RCT [105]. In a
non-randomized, controlled retrospective trial
in patients after cardiac transplantation, vildagliptin has been shown to be effective in
reducing HbA1c and mean blood glucose levels,
without affecting the weight, lipid profile or
immunosuppressive drug levels [106].
Linagliptin was evaluated in a retrospective
study of 21 patients on tacrolimus and was
found to effectively reduce fasting, post-prandial glucose and HbA1c, without causing significant altering tacrolimus levels or side effects
[107].
Sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein
and organic anion transporter-3 (OAT3),
OATP4C1, whereas all the other gliptins are a
substrate for p-glycoprotein. A CNI such as
cyclosporine is a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein. However, concomitant use does not
affect the pharmacokinetics of the gliptins in a
clinically meaningful way [94]. Studies to date
have shown that gliptins probably have no significant effect on CNI or mTORi metabolism
Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801 791

with the possible exception of sitagliptin and
cyclosporine (increase in cyclosporine trough
levels) as well as tacrolimus and vildagliptin
(decrease in tacrolimus trough levels) [94].
GLP-1 Receptor Agonists
GLP-1 receptor agonists function by delaying
gastric emptying, promoting insulin secretion
in a glucose-dependant manner and suppressing glucagon secretion and appetite. They have
also been shown to be protective on beta cell
function in the long term. In an experimental
study GLP-1 infusion reduced glucagon concentrations and increased first- and secondphase insulin secretion in patients with PTDM
[108].
Liraglutide [109], semaglutide [110] and
more recently albiglutide [111] have been
shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Besides the glucose-lowering effect, they have non-glycaemic benefits
such as improvement in insulin resistance,
weight loss, reduction in blood pressure,
improved lipid profile and direct effect on the
heart and the vascular endothelium. Dose
adjustment of liraglutide and semaglutide is not
required for mild, moderate to severe renal
impairment.
There is a concern that delayed gastric emptying caused by GLP-1 agonists can affect
absorption of orally administered immunosuppressive agents, potentially leading to insufficient peak levels within a narrow therapeutic
window. A case series demonstrated that tacrolimus trough levels are not affected by co-administration of liraglutide [112]. A real-world
retrospective study has shown that both
liraglutide and dulaglutide are safe, efficacious
and well tolerated in patients with SOT without
any interference with immunosuppressive
therapy [113]. With dulaglutide, there was sustained reduction in weight, BMI, insulin
requirement and HbA1c compared with
liraglutide. GLP-1 agonists are potential agents
for treatment of PTDM given their multifaceted
effects and minimal renal clearance, but further
research is required to establish their safety,
efficacy and long-term effects on micro- and
macrovascular complications.
Insulin
Insulin therapy is required if other treatments
are not tolerated or contraindicated or because
of renal impairment precluding the use of oral
agents. In PTDM, glucose levels have been
shown to be lowest between 2:00 and 8:00 and
highest between 14:00 and 20:00 [114]. Hence,
insulin with a pharmacokinetic profile resulting
in a peak after mid-day such as a biphasic
insulin administered in the morning would be
more useful. The treatment regimen would have
to be tailored on an individual basis.
SGLT2 Inhibitors
There is presently no robust research evidence
to support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in PTDM.
In patients with heart transplants, empagliflozin was shown to produce clinical reduction
in body weight and blood pressure and a nonsignificant reduction in HBA1c. After 147
cumulative months of empagliflozin use, no
adverse events such as diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) or genitourinary infections were reported
[115]. They are promising agents because of
specific benefits, i.e. weight loss, low risk of
hypoglycaemia, renoprotection, cardioprotection, and reduction in incidence and admissions with heart failure [116–118]. They cannot
be initiated in patients with an eGFR \60 ml/
min/1.73 m2 and should be discontinued when
eGFR \ 45 ml/min/1.73 m2
. Notably, in the
EMPA-REG study, patients with an eGFR of
30 ml/min/1.73 m2 were part of the study [116].
No clinically meaningful interaction was noted
between cyclosporine and canagliflozin in
healthy participants [119].
In small experimental studies, empagliflozin
has been shown to alleviate tacrolimus-induced
renal and pancreatic cell injury, thereby stabilising and improving the resulting renal dysfunction and hyperglycaemia [120].
Bariatric Surgery
Randomized controlled trials in patients with
type 2 DM undergoing bariatric surgery have
shown sustained diabetes remission in 30–63%
of the patients [121]. Although there are no
studies formally assessing metabolic surgery in
PTDM, this can be offered as a mean for diabetes
792 Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801

amelioration/remission in obese patients (BMI
C 35) affected by obesity-related complications
and impaired QoL [122].
Prevention of CV Disease
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is quite
prevalent in patients after kidney transplantation. Aspirin reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in patients with known CVD [123].
Low-dose aspirin is therefore recommended for
secondary prevention [124].
Management of Dyslipidaemia
Following transplantation, in addition to the
elevated triglycerides and decreased HDL
cholesterol, the non-HDL cholesterol and total
cholesterol are frequently elevated. This is contributed by the use of immunosuppressive
therapy, relative insulin deficiency associated
with PTDM and other risk factors in this population such as obesity and advancing age.
Cyclosporine increases LDL cholesterol via both
increased production and decreased clearance.
Corticosteroids increase TC, VLDL and
triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent manner
by exacerbating insulin resistance. The adverse
effects of cyclosporine and corticosteroids on
lipid levels appear to be additive [125]. Tacrolimus and azathioprine appear to have less
induction of dyslipidaemia than cyclosporine
[126]. Sirolimus increases both cholesterol and
triglycerides, in part due to decreased LDL
clearance [127].
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) guidelines recommend checking the
lipid profile at 2–3 months after transplantation
or change in treatment and at least annually
thereafter [128]. All renal transplant patients are
considered at high risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The guidelines recommend treating
LDL cholesterol to a target of \100 mg/dl
(2.59 mmol/l) [129]. The medication of choice
is a statin, the starting dose of which has to be
calculated bearing in mind potential drug-drug
interaction in patients treated with cyclosporine or tacrolimus. A long-term follow-up study
in renal transplant patients with fluvastatin has
shown that major adverse cardiac events and
mortality were reduced [130]. Pravastatin and
simvastatin have demonstrated improved outcomes in cardiac transplant patients [131, 132].
A Cochrane database review has shown a strong
trend towards reduced CVD events and mortality with statins in renal transplant patients
[133].
Severe hypertriglyceridaemia, which can be
associated with sirolimus and everolimus therapy, should be treated first to avert the potential
risk of pancreatitis [134]. Fibrates can be used
with immunosuppressants but have to be used
cautiously with statins because of the increased
risk of statin-induced myopathy with the combination. Fish oils lower triglycerides but their
effect on graft function in renal transplant
patients is unknown [135].
Drug interactions must be borne in mind as
cyclosporine and tacrolimus are metabolized by
CYP3A4 and can potentially increase systemic
exposure to a statin increasing the risk of
myopathy. Fluvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin
and rosuvastatin have less potential for interaction [136].
Ezetimibe has been shown to be a well-tolerated and efficacious alternative in those who
are intolerant to statin or in whom this is contraindicated [137].
Sometimes severe dyslipidaemia may warrant change in the immunosuppressive therapy
or steroid dose reduction or withdrawal
[138, 139].
It has been shown that circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
is significantly associated with development of
PTDM in renal transplant patients [140], but
there is no intervention study that has tested
whether its inhibition would reduce the incidence of PTDM.
Management of Hypertension
Hypertension is common in patients before and
after kidney transplantation. Post-transplant
factors that contribute to it are use of
immunosuppressive agents, use of steroids,
weight gain, renal artery stenosis, graft rejection
or chronic allograft nephropathy. KDIGO
Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:779–801 793

recommends measuring blood pressure at every
clinic visit. It also suggests maintaining blood
pressure at \ 130 mmHg systolic
and \ 80 mmHg diastolic if C 18 years of age
[141]. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for CVD after kidney transplantation [142].
The choice of the initial antihypertensive
agent depends on associated co-morbid conditions, the presence or absence of proteinuria,
and post-transplant complications that may
contraindicate the use of a particular antihypertensive agent. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1
receptor blockers have no particular role in
patient or graft survival following renal transplantation [143]. A Cochrane review has shown
that calcium channel blockers improve graft
function and reduce the risk of graft loss compared with ACEi which were associated with
worsening eGFR, low haemoglobin and
increased risk of hyperkalaemia [144]. Calcium
channel blockers may be the first-line agents for
hypertensive kidney transplant patients. Antihypertensives such as beta-blockers and thiazide
diuretics may be associated with hyperglycaemia. Beta-blockers that have a neutral effect
or favourable effect on glucose homeostasis
include carvedilol, labetalol, pindolol and
nebivolol.
CONCLUSION
PTDM affects graft survival and mortality and is
associated with long-term complications. The
need to manage transplant-induced diabetes
detracts from the quality of life achieved by
transplantation. Consensus criteria for the
diagnosis of post-transplant diabetes are now
firmly established and their implementation
allows for timely diagnosis and treatment. This
should improve long-term outcomes. Awareness that transplantation could be associated
with the onset of diabetes prior to transplantation can lead to early implementation of a prevention strategy with dietary and lifestyle
changes as part of the overall post-transplant
management. Although tailored individual
immunosuppressive therapy would help, the
priority of care after transplantation should be
focussed on using the most appropriate combination of agents to prevent graft failure, even it
if comes with an attendant risk of PTDM.
Management of PTDM can be complex given
the other problems related to transplantation
such as profiles of immunosuppressive agents
including steroid-associated metabolic changes,
variable kidney function, drug interactions,
changes in activity, exercise and body habitus.
Treatment strategies should be individualized to
the patient. We advise a collabortive multidisciplinary approach to the care of such patients,
involving members of the specialist diabetes
and transplant teams. Further research in this
field will definitely add to the current repertoire
of knowledge and management strategies in
what is an important post-transplant morbidity.
