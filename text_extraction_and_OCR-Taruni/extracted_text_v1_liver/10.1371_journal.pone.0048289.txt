Abstract
A combination of Sanger and 454 sequences of small subunit rRNA loci were used to interrogate microbial diversity in the
bovine rumen of 12 cows consuming a forage diet. Observed bacterial species richness, based on the V1–V3 region of the
16S rRNA gene, was between 1,903 to 2,432 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) when 5,520 reads were
sampled per animal. Eighty percent of species-level OTUs were dominated by members of the order Clostridiales,
Bacteroidales, Erysipelotrichales and unclassified TM7. Abundance of Prevotella species varied widely among the 12 animals.
Archaeal species richness, also based on 16S rRNA, was between 8 and 13 OTUs, representing 5 genera. The majority of
archaeal OTUs (84%) found in this study were previously observed in public databases with only two new OTUs discovered.
Observed rumen fungal species richness, based on the 18S rRNA gene, was between 21 and 40 OTUs with 98.4–99.9% of
OTUs represented by more than one read, using Good’s coverage. Examination of the fungal community identified
numerous novel groups. Prevotella and Tannerella were overrepresented in the liquid fraction of the rumen while
Butyrivibrio and Blautia were significantly overrepresented in the solid fraction of the rumen. No statistical difference was
observed between the liquid and solid fractions in biodiversity of archaea and fungi. The survey of microbial communities
and analysis of cross-domain correlations suggested there is a far greater extent of microbial diversity in the bovine rumen
than previously appreciated, and that next generation sequencing technologies promise to reveal novel species,
interactions and pathways that can be studied further in order to better understand how rumen microbial community
structure and function affects ruminant feed efficiency, biofuel production, and environmental impact.

Introduction
The bovine rumen harbors a diverse population of microorganisms that converts ingested plant biomass to protein, short
chain volatile fatty acids, and gases (e.g., CO2, NH3, and CH4) via
fermentation. End-products of rumen microbial fermentation
provide the host with essential nutrients for metabolism, but are
also released into the environment. Studying the microbial
populations associated with the bovine gastrointestinal tract
(GIT) holds vast potential for answering questions associated with
improving animal production [1] and increasing the efficiency of
animal feed [2,3]. Additionally, it stands to foster an understanding of the impact of the host on GIT bacterial populations [4]. The
ultimate implications of these studies include improving renewable
fuel production, including conversion of cellulosic waste to biogas
[5], and reduction of greenhouse gas production and emissions.
The bovine rumen microbiome is estimated to contain more
than 1010 bacteria, 109 phage, 108 protozoa, 107 archaea, and 103
fungal spores per ml [6,7]. Both 18S and 16S small subunit (SSU)
rRNA surveys of the bovine rumen suggest extensive microbial
diversity of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic fractions, far greater
than has been suggested using traditional culturing methods
[8,9,10,11,12]. Estimates of the number of rumen microbial
species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences vary from 300–400
with Sanger [10] to 500–1000 [12,13,14], and 12000 [11] with
454 pyrosequencing. By pooling rumen bacterial 16S rRNA data
from the RDP database, Kim et al. calculated 5271 species-level
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) [15]. Low G + C Grampositive bacteria (54%) and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides
genera (40%) appear as the most abundant Bacteria [16]; Archaea,
particularly methanogens, are estimated to comprise approximately 0.3–3% of the biomass [9,17]. Brulc et al., [13] identified a
limited number of eukaryotic phylotypes (<1.3%), most of which
were similar to Viridiplantae (i.e., plant feed), Metazoa (i.e., bovine),
and Fungi.
With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, it is
now feasible to conduct in-depth sequencing and data analysis on

samples derived from any environment of choice, including the
rumen microbiota, at a deeper level than previously performed.
Available rumen SSU-based microbiome studies have provided an
incomplete picture of the microbial community structure, only
focusing on one microbial domain at a time [11,12,13,14,18,19].
In the present study, SSU rRNA sequencing was used to provide a
comprehensive assessment of rumen microbial diversity, including
Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi. We compared data from 12 cows to
previously identified rumen taxa from public repositories and
found novel taxa from each microbial domain. To determine how
microbial domains partitioned between solid and liquid fractions
of bolus, microbial taxonomic profiles were compared per animal
and between solid and liquid fractions. Integration of prokaryotic
and fungal data sets highlighted the cross-domain correlations
among the abundances of rumen inhabitants. A phylogenetic
analysis of potentially novel fungal taxa was also presented.
Results and Discussion
DNA from rumen solid or liquid material was extracted for
PCR amplification with primers specific for prokaryotic 16S
rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA genes. Sequences were trimmed for
quality using LUCY [20], which has been shown to help reduce
overestimation of OTUs [21] that commonly occur from 454
pyrosequencing errors [21,22,23]. All primer-trimmed sequences
that passed the length cut-off were analyzed with MOTHUR [24],
with a species-level OTU definition of 97% sequence identity (i.e.,
3% divergence).
Assessment of Current Publicly Available Ruminal SSU
rRNA Sequences
NCBI, SILVA and RDP repositories of bacterial 16S sequences
were queried to retrieve nucleotide sequences annotated as
ruminal (see Materials and Methods for search terms) in order
to compare new data to existing data. The query resulted in
22485, 12153 and 15637 sequences respectively (Table S1). The
sequences from all three public repositories were combined to
form a reference dataset (indicated as ‘‘REF’’ in Table 1 and
Table S1). These reference sequences from all three repositories
were then aligned against a reference 16S sequence alignment.
Based on this alignment (Figure S1), the V1–V3 region of the 16S
sequence seemed to be slightly overrepresented in the public
repositories. In general, the sequences deposited in the three
repositories spanned the length of the entire 16S sequence.
Overall, the public repositories contained 14332 unique sequences
aligning to the V1–V3 region of the 16S gene (Figure S1). These
previously discovered sequences were compared to the sequences
generated in this study. Utilizing an OTU approach to cluster the
publicly available sequences based on their sequence similarity, the
public repositories contained approximately 4670 distinct, ruminal, species-level bacterial OTUs, a number slightly less than
previously reported from the public domain [15]. This difference
may be due to the way the reads were processed. In this study,
only those reads mapping to the V1–V3 region were clustered,
while Kim et al. did not single out a specific region, leaving the
potential for reads originating from the same species, but mapping
to different regions of the SSU rRNA gene, being clustered into
different OTUs due to a lack of sequence overlap. In addition, the
Kim et al. dataset was based on a multiple sequence alignment
against the Greengenes database [25], while this study used CDHIT [26] to determine sequence identity.
Ruminal archaeal and eukaryotic SSU rRNA sequences were
retrieved from public repositories using keyword searches similar
to those used for bacteria (above). A total of 4198 ruminal archaeal
SSU rRNA sequences in NCBI, 1120 in SILVA and 3703 in RDP
were retrieved. A reference dataset, combining the sequences from
the three repositories (‘‘REF’’ in Table 1), contained 2484 unique
sequences that aligned to the V1–V3 regions (Figure S2).
Subsequent analysis of the 2484 sequences clustered at 97%
identity detected 486 ruminal OTUs in the three repositories. A
search for eukaryotic 18S sequences of the rumen in SILVA and
NCBI databases yielded 1027 and 1803 sequences, respectively.
Only approximately 10% of the eukaryotic sequences retrieved
were annotated as fungal. RDP was not queried for eukaryotic
sequences, as it does not house 18S rRNA sequences. Based on the
alignment to the 18S reference sequence, a region matching the
region sequenced in this study (Figure S3) yielded 168 OTUs.
Detailed results of the overlap of OTUs per repository for SSU
rRNAs are presented in Table S1 and Figure S4. For each
microbial domain, NCBI consistently had the greatest number of
unique OTUs, but not all-inclusive, justifying combining all three
databases. Representative bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic
OTU sequences from each repository were pooled to generate
three reference datasets, which were subsequently used as a
benchmark for diversity found in the current study.
Current Study Versus Public Repositories
To determine if maximal microbial species-level OTU richness
within the rumen has already been obtained, SSU rRNA was
sequenced from rumen contents of 12 individual animals and
compared to the same region (V1–V3) of the public repository
OTU representative reads. Because there was variation in
sequencing depths among the samples in this study, a random
set of 5520 bacterial, 82 archaeal and 1046 fungal sequences were
chosen based on the sample with the fewest sequence reads before
entering the QC pipeline. Random subsampling of libraries to
equalize the number of reads per sample has been suggested as one
solution to obtaining unbiased non-parametric richness estimates
of microbial community diversity from NextGen sequencing data
[27]. Upon completion of the QC pipeline (see methods), a total of
23493, 138, and 2089 unique bacterial, archaeal, and fungal
sequences were identified, respectively. The reads were subsequently clustered into 4367, 20, and 52 species-level OTUs,
respectively (Table 1). Good’s coverage [28], a measure of
coverage of dominant taxa (i.e., those OTUs with more than one
sequence), was 67% for Bacteria, and higher in Archaea (98%) and
Fungi (100%), compare to 81–85% from the public repositories
(Table 1). This disparity in coverage may be explained in part
because the public repository sequences originated from a diverse
group of ruminant animals (yellow cattle, reindeer, cattle, etc.) from
different geographical locations. Except for Bacteria, species
richness and evenness of the public domain dataset is greater
than that observed from the animals in this study as noted by
greater values of all four diversity estimators used.
Out of 4367 bacterial species-level OTUs found in this study,
only 1262 (29%) were shared with the three public repositories
(Figure 1A). Moreover, for every OTU found in the public
repositories, a novel one was discovered from the new data, while
still far from maximal Good’s coverage. Conversely, the majority
of the archaeal OTUs (90%) found in this study were previously
observed in the public databases with only 2 new OTUs added; 1
Methanobrevibacter and 1 Thermogymnomonas, (Figure 1B). For Fungi,
only 1 OTU was shared between the public repositories and the
animals investigated in this study, suggesting the scientific
community is only beginning to realize the extent of fungal
diversity of ruminants (Figure 1C). It should be noted that, of the
168 ruminal eukaryotic OTUs in public repositories, roughly 10%
Bovine Rumen Prokaryotic and Fungal Diversity

were fungal, which further highlights the paucity of rumen fungal
rRNA sequences in these databases.
Per-animal Bacterial Species Richness
Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from the solid and liquid
fractions from each animal were pooled and sampled to generate
OTU-based diversity calculations (Table 2). As indicated in the
‘‘# of usable sequences’’ column of Table 2, almost all animals
had at least 5199 LUCY-trimmed, unique, chimera-checked
bacterial 16S sequences that were used in the final microbial
species richness estimators. The observed number of OTUs
ranged from 1903 to 2432 (Table 2). The Chao1 non-parametric
richness estimator predicted as many as 3116 to 5439 species-level
OTUs (Table 2). Good’s coverage was between 69–82%,
indicating that by using ,5000 bacterial sequences, the dominant
bacterial community within the rumen of an individual animal was
insufficiently sampled. Taxonomic profiling indicated that Prevotella, Oscillibacter, Coprococcus, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, and
Butyrivibrio were the top five most abundant bacterial OTUs
present in the rumen, comprising close to 40% of all bacterial taxa
observed (Figure 2A).
Per-animal Archaeal Species Richness
An analysis of archaeal diversity was performed and summarized in Table 2, by clustering the sequences generated from PCR
of the 16S rRNA gene using archaeal-specific primers A109F and
A934R [29]. Anywhere between 8 and 13 species-level OTUs
were found per animal at an indicated coverage of 89–96%. When
counting the genus-level taxonomy of these OTUs, a total of 5
archaeal genera were observed with the majority of OTUs being
composed of Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera species. Thermogymnomonas species were observed in 4 of the 12 animals
(Figure 2B).
Per-animal fungal species richness. An OTU analysis
analogous to those performed on bacterial and archaeal 16S
rRNA gene sequences was performed on fungal 18S rRNA gene
sequence reads and summarized in Table 2. Briefly, only between
21 and 40 OTUs were identified despite using about a 1,000
sequences per animal. The Good’s coverage [28] estimates of
98.4–99.9% indicated that nearly the full extent of fungal diversity
in the rumen of 12 animals using primers EF4a and fung5a was
captured. In the top 10 genera (Figure 2C), 5 were potentially
novel, marked as unclassified at some taxonomic level. Among the
known fungal genera, Nectria, Penicilliopsis, Cystofilobasidium and
Delphinella were the most abundant, comprising over 25% of the 46
fungal genera detected (Figure 2C).
Rumen Solid Versus Liquid Phase Species Richness
Samples of ruminal content from all 12 animals were separated
into solid and liquid fractions (Text S1). To determine if observed
differences in bacterial OTUs between liquid and solid fractions as
measured by taxonomic profiling and PCA were statistically
significant, the Wilcoxon non-parametric t-test corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing [29] was implemented. Bacterial
biodiversity of seven genera differed significantly (P,0.05)

between liquid and solid fractions of the rumen contents
(Figure 3A, Table S2), while there was no statistical difference
observed between the liquid and solid fractions in biodiversity of
Archaea (Figure 3B), and Fungi (Figure 3C). Prevotella and
Tannerella (both members of the order Bacteroidales) were overrepresented in the liquid fraction of the rumen (Figure 3D).
Conversely, Butyrivibrio and Blautia (both members of the order
Clostridiales) were significantly overrepresented in the solid fraction
of the rumen. These results are consistent with previous
observations that Prevotella are more prevalent in the liquid
fraction of pasture-fed cows [11] and bermudagrass hay- or
wheat-fed steers [12]. Likewise, Butyrivibrio, a member of the family
Lachnospiraceae, was also shown to be more abundant in the solid
fraction of pasture-fed cows [11] and bermudagrass hay- or wheatfed steers [12]. However, the Tannerella and Blautia (a.k.a.
Ruminococcus) results vary more across these studies. This may be
due to differences in geographical location, diet, time of sampling
post feeding, and the genetic background or sex of the animals.

Cross-domain Analysis of the Microbiome
Little is known regarding cross-domain interactions among the
inhabitants of the bovine rumen. To address this void, a
comprehensive analysis of the patterns of abundance of Bacteria,
Archaea and Fungi were determined across the 12 animals. Based on
comparison of the relative abundance of OTUs in different
domains, especially in the case of Bacteria and Archaea whose
abundances differed by several orders of magnitude, a log
transformation was applied to the raw OTU counts. These logtransformed abundances observed across 12 cows were then
hierarchically clustered based on distance calculated as 1– |r|
(where r is the linear correlation coefficient) of any combination of
two microbial taxa and represented as a heatmap (Figure 4). To
determine statistical significance of observed correlations, fdrtool
[30,31] was used to calculate false discovery rate-corrected (FDR)
q-values for each correlation coefficient. In all, 74691 pairwise
combinations of genera were analyzed to produce 1424 significant
(qval ,0.05) correlations (Table S3), too many to interpret
manually. However, on a taxonomic level of class, 1275 possible
correlations were calculated and 10 were significant (qval ,0.05)
(Table S4, and noted with asterisks and boldface in Figure 4).
Notably, abundance of an unclassified fungal class of subphylum
Pezizomycotina was inversely correlated with Caldilineae and
Verrucomicrobia Subdivision 5 Bacteria (RDP taxonomy from
MOTHUR). The Subdivision 5 is a class of uncultured
Verrucomicrobia that was first identified from a hydrocarbonTable 2. Sampling microbial diversity across 12 cows.

contaminated aquifer [32]. Abundance of the fungal class
Tremellomycetes was positively correlated with abundance of
bacterial class Verrucomicrobiae and negatively correlated with
abundance of bacterial class of Gemmatimonadetes. On the other
hand, abundance of one member of Pezizomycetes (fungal class) was
positively correlated with abundance of Halobacteria and Thermoprotei (two members of the Archaea). Both Halobacteria and
Thermoprotei were observed in only one animal (C9, Figure 2B) as
Halogeometricum and Caldivirga, respectively. Future studies are
needed to verify these cross-domain correlations and to provide a
biological explanation for them (e.g., which community members
are potentially metabolically interchangeable).
Novel Fungal Taxa
To investigate the striking disparity between the fungal
sequences identified in the current study and the sequences
currently available in the public repositories (Figure 1C), a
phylogenetic tree was inferred, illustrating taxonomic relationships
among the representative OTU sequences (Figure 5). Of the 71
total fungal OTUs identified in this study, only 53 grouped near a
previously deposited sequence (gray and black leaves, Figure 5).
The most abundant OTU identified in this study represented by
over 4620 sequences and present in all 12 animals with sequence
similarity to Aschochyta pisi, a known fungal pathogen responsible
for blight of common crops such as peas. The second most
abundant fungal OTU identified in this study resembled a recently
characterized species of Aspergillus (PSBORB-4, Genbank accession
HQ393873.1, unpublished). This OTU was represented by 4612
sequences and was also identified in all 12 animals. Aspergillus
isolate PSBORB-4 clustered with Aspergillus proliferans; however,
based on read counts, PSBORB-4 was over 220 times more
abundant. Furthermore, two additional OTUs that were classified
as ‘‘Ascomycota’’ and ‘‘Aspergillus’’ clustered with PSBORB-4 and
A. proliferans, alluding to potentially novel Aspergillus species that are
yet to be discovered.
Close to 40% (black leaves in Figure 5) of the 53 BLASTmatched OTUs were rudimentarily annotated in the public
repository (e.g., ‘‘uncultured soil fungus’’, and without any definite
taxonomic classification). The remaining 20 OTU-representative
sequences did not match any known targets in the recent release of
the nt database at NCBI (red and blue leaves in Figure 5). For
these 20 sequences, least common ancestor (LCA) analysis
revealed a possible taxonomic placement for 11 sequences
(indicated as blue leaves in Figure 5) leaving 9 sequences as
unclassifiable, (red leaves in Figure 5), representing presumably
novel taxa of the bovine rumen. Our analysis showed that the
current landscape of the fungal diversity in the rumen is largely
incomplete. Specifically, that there is a greater than previously
appreciated diversity of Pleosporales, Neocallimastix, Sordariomyceteideae,
Udeniomyces and others.
Conclusion
Sequencing of the SSU rRNA gene of Bacteria and Fungi from
bovine rumen suggests that the compositional characterization of
the rumen microbiome is incomplete with several novel fungal
taxa being discovered despite targeting the less specific 18S rRNA
gene. In contrast, a comparison of archaeal SSU rRNA sequences
with sequences from three public repositories resulted in only 2
new species. Bacterial community profiles differed between liquid
and solid (fiber) fractions while the archaeal and fungal
communities appeared indifferent. Integration of prokaryotic
and fungal data sets highlighted the cross-domain correlations
among the abundances of rumen inhabitants. Future studies
should focus on exploring these dependences further via
metagenomic and functional analysis of the bovine rumen.

Research Laboratory (LARRL) Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) under approval number 21308-1. For this
series of experiments, rumen samples were obtained from 27
month old crossbred Bos taurus (.75% Black Angus with the
remainder being Hereford, Red Angus, Charolais, and Tarentaise)
ruminally-cannulated multiparous beef females designated Cows
1–12. Cows were adapted to their diet and environment for at
least 14 days before sample collection.
Sample Preparation
Rumen samples from 12 different animals were obtained
from ruminally-cannulated animals consuming harvested forage
(Text S1). Rumen contents were mixed by hand before an
aliquot was removed from the rumen. The liquid fraction of
each animal was separated from the solid contents by filtration
through sterile 90-grade cheesecloth. All samples were transported on dry ice to the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in
Rockville, MD for DNA extraction, amplification and analysis
(Text S1). SSU rRNA genes representing the diversity of
Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi were amplified for sequencing.
Samples from the solid and liquid phases were handled
separately through sequence completion.
PCR Primers
Bacterial diversity was established by sequencing PCR
amplicons generated using primers 27F [AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG] [33] and 534R [ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG] [34], which target the highly variable V1–V3 region of the 16S gene [34] (Text S1). Fungalspecific primers for 454 pyrosequencing were used to PCR
amplify an approximately 500 bp region of the 18S rRNA gene
using primers EF4a [GGAAGGGRTGTATTTATTAG] and

then column purified (Qiaquick, Qiagen), quantified (Tecan
Group Ltd.), and normalized in preparation for emPCR and 454
pyrosequencing. The archaeal 16S rRNA gene was amplified for
Sanger sequencing using the following primer pairs: A109F
[ACKGCTCAGTAACACGT] and A934R
[GTGCTCCCCCGCCAATTCCT] [29] and column purified
as above.

bootstrapping was .50%. The width of the branch is proportional to the number of animals (1–12) that exhibited a given OTU. This number of
animals is also indicated in the last part of the OTU label. Gray- and black-labeled OTUs were classified using BLAST and at least 97% identity to a
target sequence. Black labels highlight a subset of these OTUs with vague annotation. OTUs labeled in blue did not match a target using BLAST, but
were subsequently classified using LCA based on 90% identity to a SILVA database match. OTUs in red failed both BLAST and LCA and are
presumably novel taxa.

DNA Sequence Processing
A rigorous sequence-processing pipeline was adapted that
utilized LUCY [20,21] and sequence base quality information to
trim each read, remove low quality and short (,100 bp) reads.
The subsequent quality control (QC) steps collapse sequencerinduced PCR duplicates using MOTHUR v1.22.2 [24] and
further filter out sequence fragments using CD-HIT-454 [36].
While MOTHUR is capable of removing sequence fragments,
the CD-HIT suite of tools [26] was found to be orders of
magnitude faster with more modest hardware requirements,
facilitating rapid, high-throughput analysis with comparable
results to those of MOTHUR (data not shown). Subsequently,
the remaining filtered reads were aligned against a SILVA
database of 16S or 18S sequences [24,37] to verify that the reads
were indeed 16S or 18S and to determine that they map to the
correct region of the respective rRNA gene. Subsequently, the
pipeline utilized MOTHUR’s implementation of chimera slayer
[24,38] to filter out potentially chimeric reads. The entire rRNA
sequence-processing pipeline is freely available as a part of the
YAP package [39]. The processed 16S rDNA data from this
study can be obtained at NCBI under BioProject ID
PRJNA173217.
OTU-based Sequence Analysis
A module of the CD-HIT suite [26], called CD-HIT-EST, was
used to perform the read-clustering. The workflow engine that
manages the succession of steps and their dispatch to grid nodes
was implemented in python via YAP. An identity threshold of
97% was used to identify OTUs at approximately the species level
[40].
Taxonomic Classification of OTU Representative Reads
Taxonomic classification of the final set of representative reads
was performed using MOTHUR’s version of the RDP Bayesian
classifier [24], using a RDP training dataset number 6 [41]
normalized to contain 6 taxonomic levels for each sequence. A
similar approach was used for the 18S sequences, except they were
classified using ARB [42] and BLAST [43] against the current
NCBI nt database.
Sequences Obtained from Public Repositories
Three repositories (SILVA [37,44], RDP [45] and NCBI [46])
were queried to identify the bacterial and archaeal ruminal 16S
sequences, and two repositories (SILVA and NCBI) were queried
to identify all eukaryotic ruminal 18S sequences. Search terms
included ‘‘organism domain’’ and ‘‘rRNA’’ where appropriate,
‘‘rumen,’’ ‘‘rumenal,’’ or ‘‘ruminal.’’ The sequences were then
aligned to their respective set of 16S or 18S SILVA references
using the MOTHUR aligner. The alignment was then trimmed
based on the coordinates of the alignment so that only the
sequences that could potentially be amplified using the primer sets
used in this study were kept for subsequent analyses. (Figures S1,
S2, S3, and-S4, Table S1).
Phylogenetic Tree Building and Annotation
SSU rRNA gene sequences were aligned using SINA [47], a
sequence alignment tool that considers primary and secondary
sequence attributes incorporated into the SILVA rRNA reference
compiled using ARB. Based on the alignment, a bootstrapped
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was subsequently inferred using
paupFasta, an in-house wrapper script around the PAUP*
program as described [48,49], and edited using FigTree [50].
The annotation of tree leaves was performed using TimeLogicTM
TERA-BLAST of OTU representative sequences against the
November 2011 release of the NCBI nt database. For each of the
sequences, one representative database hit was kept if fewer than
3 mismatches per 100 nucleotides were observed between it and
the query. For all of the sequences that did not have a database
match with fewer than 3 mismatches per 100 bases, a least
common ancestor (LCA) analysis with a threshold parameter 0.9
was performed using SILVA taxonomy at the SILVA web site
[44].
Cross-domain Correlations
The analysis of cross-domain correlations was performed using
a script written in the R statistical computing language [51]. All
OTU abundances were converted to log base 10, using a standard
R function, log10. All non-redundant combinations of any two
genera were listed, and the correlations of OTU abundances
across the 12 cows were calculated. A function, cor, part of the
default installation of R, was used to calculate the Pearson
correlation coefficients (r) of every listed combination. The R
package fdrtool [30,31] was used to correct for multiple hypothesis
testing and to generate q values for each correlation. In addition to
the pair-wise analysis, a hierarchical clustering of genera, based on
their abundance patterns across 12 cows, was performed. To
group multiple genera together based on the OTU abundance
patterns, the heatmap.2 function, a part of the gplots R package,
available via CRAN, was used. The distance function supplied to
the heatmap.2 function as an argument was defined as ‘‘1– |r|’’ of
the OTU abundances between any two genera across 12 cows.
The standard hclust R function with an argument ‘‘average’’, for
average linkage clustering, was supplied to the heatmap.2 function
to compare the distances between any two genera and to produce
the dendrogram visible in the heatmap figure.
