Abstract Voiding urosonography (VUS) encompasses examination of the urinary tract with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA) for diagnosis of
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The real breakthrough for
US examination of VUR came with the availability of
stabilized UCAs in the mid-1990s. This article presents a
comprehensive review of various procedural aspects of
VUS. Different US modalities are available for detecting
the echogenic microbubbles: fundamental mode, colour
Doppler US, harmonic imaging and dedicated contrast
imaging with multiple display options. The reflux is graded
(1 to 5) in a similar manner to the system used in voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG). The most commonly used
UCA for VUS, Levovist, is galactose-based and contains
air-filled microbubbles. The recommended concentration is
300 mg/ml at a dose of 5–10%, or less than 5%, of the
bladder filling volume when using fundamental or harmonic imaging modes, respectively. There are preliminary
reports of VUS using a second-generation UCA, SonoVue.
Here the UCA volume is less than 1% of the bladder filling
volume. There is no specific contraindication to intravesical
administration of UCA. The safety profile of intravesical
Levovist is very high with no reports of side effects over a
decade of use in VUS.

Introduction
Diagnostic imaging for vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a
common procedure in children. Currently, three modalities are
available for reflux diagnosis, namely voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), radionuclide cystography (RNC) and
voiding urosonography (VUS). The last of these is carried
out using US in combination with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA). This allows the use of
ionizing radiation to be avoided, which is not the case in
RNC and VCUG. However, in VCUG a marked reduction
in radiation dose has been achieved with the introduction of
digital pulsed fluoroscopy.
The first attempts at the implementation of US for the
diagnosis of VUR began in the mid-1970s. A comprehensive
account of the evolution of this undertaking over the
subsequent two decades has been presented by Darge [1].
The indirect methods for reflux diagnosis were based on US
of the urinary tract, without administration of any kind of
substance into the bladder. These included depicting various
sonomorphological changes of the urinary tract as a result of
VUR, detecting newly appearing or an increase in existing
ureteral or pelvicalyceal dilatation during voiding and
assessing ureteric jet changes with duplex and colour
Doppler US. The direct means used to diagnose VUR
required instilling different substances intravesically. The
most frequently administered fluid was physiological saline
solution. Ballooning of the renal pelvis during the filling of
the bladder was the criterion for diagnosis of VUR.
Application of air bubbles, by shaking the normal saline
before administration or adding carbon dioxide, were also
tried. US studies were also carried out, in which the empty
bladder was solely filled with air. In addition to low
diagnostic accuracy, all the above methods had major

procedural drawbacks making them impractical for widespread integration into routine imaging.
The intravesical use of a UCA consisting of sonicated
albumin (Albunex; Molecular Biosystems, San Diego,
Calif.) for VUS in a child was first reported in 1994 [2].
Another UCA used in the past was Echovist (Schering,
Berlin, Germany), which is composed of galactose with
incorporated microbubbles [3]. Its very short imaging
window of approximately 5 min, however, prevented its
routine application. The breakthrough in US diagnosis of
VUR in children came about the mid-1990s with the
availability of UCAs containing stabilized microbubbles.
Levovist (Levograf, Schering Spain, Madrid, Spain; SHU508-A, Schering, Berlin, Germany) was the first such
UCA to become available for clinical use in Europe. This
opened the door for rapid development of VUS and its
introduction as part of the routine diagnostic imaging
option of VUR.
A number of different names and acronyms have been
put forward to denote US examination for the diagnosis of
VUR using intravesical UCAs. These include simply
“sonography/ultrasound” [4–6], “reflux sonography” [7],
“cystography” [8–10], “cystosonography” [11–15],
“cystourethrosonography” [16] and “urosonography” [17–
23]. They are more often used in combination with one or
more of the following terms: “echo-enhanced”, “contrastenhanced” and “voiding”. Depending on the US technique
employed further descriptions such as “colour Doppler US”
or “harmonic imaging” are added. The most widely applied
name “voiding urosonography” with the abbreviation
“VUS” was proposed for the first time in 2000 [24]. The
selection of this particular designation was based on careful
consideration of various factors. The prefix “uro-” is used
to denote the bladder, ureters and kidneys. “Sonography”
was chosen rather than “ultrasonography” as it is a shorter
form. Thus “urosonography” correctly describes the fact
that in this examination US of the bladder, ureters and
kidneys takes place independent of the absence or presence
of VUR. “Voiding” was selected instead of “micturating” as
it is used more commonly in the medical literature. Despite
the fact that for VCUG x-ray contrast agent is necessary,
this is not directly added to the name VCUG in the form of,
for example, contrast-VCUG. Likewise, the terms “contrast” or “echo-enhanced” were not added by default to the
basic term “voiding urosonography”. The abbreviation
“VUS” is not only similar to the most common acronym
used for the radiological reflux examination, namely
VCUG, but had also not been used in the medical literature
to denote something else [25]. For the sake of minimizing
the confusion of names and facilitating communication,
literature search and procedural standardization, the use of
one name for the same procedure, “voiding urosonography”
(“VUS”) is recommended.
This article is part I of a comprehensive review of all
currently available literature on VUS and prepares the
ground for objective evaluation and decision-making. In
this part (part I) a detailed procedural description is
presented, including discussion of the pros and cons of
the various examination steps and imaging modalities for
VUS. The measures undertaken to optimize VUS are
elaborated. Furthermore, studies dealing with adverse
events of intravesical administration of UCAs are reviewed.
In part II a review of comparative studies between VUS and
RNC/VCUG is presented [26].
US contrast agent
The most widely used UCA for VUS is Levovist. This firstgeneration UCA was introduced for intravenous (IV) use in the
mid-1990s and from 1999 started to obtain approval for
intravesical application in children successively in 13 European
countries and Australia. Levovist consists of dry granules made
of galactose and palmitic acid [27]. The granules easily
disintegrate into microparticles upon preparation. They form
porous structures, which are necessary for the formation of
bubbles. Gas bubbles are formed within the pores during
suspension of the granules, while dissolution of the galactose
particles begins simultaneously. The Levovist bubble is a
microbubble of air—65% nitrogen and 35% oxygen—
stabilized by palmitic acid. One gram of Levovist granules
contains 999 mg D-galactose and 1 mg palmitic acid. The
concentrations of microbubbles in freshly prepared batches
(300 mg/ml) are within the range of approximately 1–2×108
microbubbles per millilitre of suspension. The Levovist
suspension should always be freshly prepared prior to intravesical administration. The steps of preparation, as outlined by
the manufacturer, must be strictly adhered to in order to avoid
any reduction of contrast enhancement due to improper
handling [28]. The administration of freshly prepared UCA
has to be carried out within 30 min [29].
Concentration
The recommended concentration of Levovist for VUS is
300 mg/ml [28]. This concentration has been used for VUS
in most studies. A concentration of 200 mg/ml seems to
result in faster dissipation of microbubbles, as found in invitro experiments (unpublished data). In only three studies
has a concentration of 200 mg/ml been used [13, 15, 30].
Bosio initially used this concentration, but later changed to
the higher one as the conspicuity of refluxing microbubbles
in fundamental mode was inadequate [13]. In another study
in adults with transplanted kidneys this concentration in
combination with an increased volume, i.e. 10–15% of
bladder filling, was used [30]. The combination of colour
Pediatr Radiol (2008) 38:40–53 41

Doppler US with the burst technique administering 200 mg/ml
selectively in infants has been reported, but the results using
just this concentration were not analyzed separately [15].
The utilization of the higher concentration of 400 mg/ml
has only been reported once without any additional
advantages being mentioned [31]. Probably, the disadvantage would be an increase in UCA volume leading to an
unwarranted increase in cost.
Dosage
The volume of UCA administered has been rather variable.
Some have applied a fixed dose for all, independent of the
patient’s age, weight and bladder volume [4, 5]. In one
study the volume was calculated in terms of body weight
[13]. In most studies the volume of bladder filling is taken
as the decisive factor [1, 12, 28]. This is very logical when
considering intravesical administration of UCA and contrast enhancement of bladder content. It is possible to
directly measure the bladder volume using the formula for
an ellipse (length×width×height×0.5], note the total volume
of normal saline administered in the bladder and also
calculate in a simple way the maximum bladder capacity:
volume in millilitres = (age in years +2)×30 [32].
Furthermore, using the bladder volume for calculation of
UCA dose makes comparison between studies much easier.
Nakamura et al. [21] carried out simultaneously VCUG
and VUS in 56 children. The fundamental (i.e. conventional) imaging modality was used for VUS. They initially
administered Levovist into an almost empty bladder
followed by continuous infusion of the radiographic
contrast agent. They simultaneously monitored the appearance of reflux during VUS, relating it to the concentration
of the UCA in the bladder. The concentration of UCA in
the bladder at one point in time ranged form 1.8% to 23%.
All false-negative results in the VUS were associated with a
Levovist volume of <5% of the total bladder filling. Thus a
volume of UCA between 5% and 10% of the bladder filling
is required when performing VUS using fundamental
imaging. As there is a clear correlation between the
experience of the sonographer and the sensitivity of VUS,
it is advisable for beginners to start with the highest
recommended volume of 10% and with increasing experience to reduce the amount, but without going below 5% of
the bladder filling when using fundamental imaging. It
seems possible to reduce the UCA volume when adding
colour Doppler US [15]. There is clear evidence that when
using harmonic imaging, 5% or less of UCA with respect to
the bladder filling will suffice [18, 33]. Preliminary
experience with dedicated contrast imaging modalities such
as cadence agent detection imaging (ADI) (Acuson;
Siemens, Mountain View, Calif.) point to the potential of
further dose reduction [34].
Physicochemical properties
UCAs were primarily developed for IV use and, consequently,
preclinical studies were aimed at elucidating problems that
could potentially have been encountered during administration
via this route. Intravesical use is different and has its own
peculiarities one must be aware of. An in-vitro study was
carried out with Levovist to measure how variations in US
machine setting, transducer choice, mode of application and
bladder content may affect the microbubbles [35]. The effects
of power output, transducer frequency and injection rate were
found to be comparable to those during IV administration. The
physicochemical properties of particular relevance for intravesical use are described below.
Interaction with normal saline solution
Unlike in VCUG and direct RNC, normal saline plays an
important role in VUS. It is the actual bladder filling
medium in which the microbubbles are injected. In an invitro study the median contrast duration when the UCA was
mixed with normal saline solution from glass containers
was 30 s, whereas when the same UCA was added to
normal saline solution from a plastic container the median
contrast duration increased to 11 min [36]. None of the
plastic containers were sealed under vacuum. In contrast,
most of the glass containers were sealed under vacuum. The
mean pO2 of the normal saline solutions from vacuumsealed containers was found to be 50% less than the pO2 of
the normal saline solutions from plastic containers. The airfilled microbubbles of Levovist are permeable to air, and
gas is exchanged with the atmosphere until equilibrium is
reached [27]. Thus, in normal saline solution with low air
saturation the microbubbles tend to collapse promptly [37].
Collapse of the microbubbles means that echo enhancers
are not available. In practice, the use of normal saline
solution from plastic containers is preferred.
Interaction with urine
Contrast duration of the UCA has been found to be more
than four times longer in urine than in normal saline. It has
been shown that simply adding urea to buffer the solution
significantly increases contrast duration [38]. It is postulated that urea affects the bonding between water molecules
and facilitates the formation of more microbubbles. Thus,
having some urine in the bladder when performing VUS
actually has a positive effect on imaging.
Ascent of microbubbles in the ureter
Once reflux of microbubbles takes place from the bladder into
the distal ureter, the question as to whether the microbubbles
42 Pediatr Radiol (2008) 38:40–53

can ascend passively to the proximal ureter and renal pelvis
while the refluxed fluid stays in the distal ureter has been
raised [39]. Given constancy of gravity, the density difference between gas and fluid and the viscosity of fluid, the
velocity of ascent is proportional to the square of the
microbubble radius. The typical microbubble radius of
Levovist is 1–2.5 μm. Calculation of velocity of ascent
indicates that for all practical purposes passive ascent can be
excluded. Furthermore, in an in-vitro simulation of VUS
with a set-up imitating the worst-case scenario (90°, glass
tube (no adsorption), constant stirring of fluid suspension,
and absence of counter-flow) the possibility of passive ascent
was evaluated using an ultraviolet spectrometer for the
detection of microbubbles. The result of this experiment was
also negative. These findings suggest that the microbubbles
in the ureter do not ascend passively and that reflux pressure
is necessary for propagation, particularly in vivo with a
constant counter-flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the
bladder.
Procedural details
VUS entails four major basic steps: (1) scan of the urinary
tract before contrast agent administration, (2) intravesical
administration of prewarmed physiological saline solution
and UCA, (3) scan of the urinary tract after administration
of UCA, and (4) scan of the urinary tract after administration of UCA during and after voiding [28, 40]. Optionally, a
transperineal US of the urethra and/or cyclical filling of the
bladder may be added. Various US modalities are available
for performing VUS. The main differences between the
modalities are in the degree of conspicuity of the microbubbles and sensitivity of reflux detection.
US scan modalities
Fundamental imaging
This conventional modality in B-mode is the earliest and
most widespread modality employed for VUS. In the case
of fundamental imaging it is important to use the same scan
planes and magnification of the ureters and renal pelves
before and after UCA administration in order to facilitate
comparison of the images (Fig. 1). This is particularly
important when the reflux is not obvious.
Colour Doppler US
The microbubbles increase the backscattered signal from
the urine giving it a characteristic chromatic effect, e.g. a
set of blue and red punctiform colour collection [32]. This
makes recognition of the urine flow direction easier and
enhances the visualization of the microbubbles in the
pelvicalyceal system. It is recommended that the Doppler
US settings be optimized to perform VUS [31, 41].
Currently, there are five reports in which colour Doppler
US alone or in combination with fundamental imaging have
been used for VUS [11, 14, 31, 41, 42]. The diagnostic
accuracy of colour Doppler US was compared with
fundamental imaging in only one study [41]. In the same
group of patients VUS without and with colour Doppler US
followed by VCUG was carried out. With VCUG as the
reference method, the diagnostic accuracy was found to be
96% with colour Doppler US and 90% without. In another
study, no significant increase was found in the sensitivity
and specificity of VUS when adding colour Doppler US
[42]. In one study a modified colour Doppler US
examination was used employing a high mechanical index
(MI) burst contrast technique based on stimulated acoustic
emission (SAE), in which the microbubbles are made to
burst creating strong acoustic signals [15]. It was possible
to detect more reflux with the burst colour Doppler US
compared to regular colour Doppler US or fundamental
imaging and even VCUG. No systematic evaluation is
available regarding the application of power Doppler US
for VUS. Overall, adding optimized colour Doppler US to
fundamental imaging seems to have some advantage and
should be tried when other contrast-specific modalities are
not available.
Harmonic imaging
The nonlinear propagation property of US waves is the
basis of harmonic imaging [43]. This may be optimized to
receive harmonics from either tissue or microbubbles, thus
creating “tissue-specific harmonic imaging” or “contrastspecific harmonic imaging”, respectively. Some US
machines only use the second harmonic for imaging
(narrow band), whereas others are capable of implementing
a wider range of harmonics (wide band). There may be
some degree of difference in image quality between these
different technical approaches, in general the latter being of
higher quality.
Harmonic imaging increases contrast and spatial resolution and also results in a reduction of artefacts [43]. The
resulting images are clearer and crisper. The advantage of
this modality compared to fundamental imaging for
scanning the urinary tract in children has already been
shown [44]. Due to attenuation, at a certain depth the
positive effect of harmonic imaging will disappear. Regarding contrast-enhanced imaging, there is distinctly increased
conspicuity of the microbubbles with harmonic imaging
(Fig. 2). Air-filled bowel can be a disturbing factor,
particularly when imaging the retrovesical space, requiring
adjustment of the gain. Darge et al. [17] compared
Pediatr Radiol (2008) 38:40–53 43

fundamental and harmonic imaging options in 54 children
undergoing VUS. In all cases the conspicuity of the
microbubbles was much higher with harmonic imaging
than with the fundamental modality. Moreover, there was
an increase in the reflux detection rate of 30% (from 19 to
27 pelvic-ureter units, PUUs). In this study the volume of
Levovist used was 10% with respect to bladder filling.
Even reducing the volume of UCA, more reflux episodes
were detected in VUS with harmonic imaging than in
VCUG [18, 33]. If available, harmonic imaging should be
chosen in preference to the fundamental modality for VUS
[17, 18, 33].
Dedicated high-MI contrast imaging with multiple
display options
In recent years, there have been major developments in US
technologies for contrast-enhanced US. One such US
modality uses high-MI imaging resulting in destruction of
microbubbles and depicts the bubble destruction signature
as a colour overlay with the possibility of visualizing the
grey-scale image alone, the grey-scale image together with
the microbubbles with colour overlay or just the microbubbles with colour overlay alone. Additional features may
be real-time dual imaging in which two of the above
modalities can be used in parallel and the possibility to
switch between the three different presentations after having
acquired an image in just one option (Figs. 3 and 4). This
modality is named differently by different manufacturers:
for example, agent detection imaging (ADI; Sequoia,
Acuson Siemens), contrast tissue enhancement imaging
(CTEI; Technos MPX, Esaote), rate subtraction imaging
(RSI; Aplio, Toshiba), true agent detection (TAD; Logiq 9,
GE), etc. [45]. The increase in microbubble conspicuity
with this modality is so striking that even a beginner should
find the examination easy to perform. The potential for
further reduction of the dose of UCA and duration of
examination are enormous and require future evaluation. If
available, this US technique is preferred for VUS using
Levovist. This feature is also available with low-MI
imaging, which is important when using newer generation
UCAs.

Procedural steps
Precontrast scans of the bladder, ureters and kidneys
The necessity to perform a detailed scan of the urinary tract
arises when the VUS is combined with a follow-up US of
the urinary tract, for example after pyelonephritis or when
there is a need for comparison with the postcontrast images.
The scan before contrast agent administration should be
carried out in accordance with standard US of the urinary
tract in the supine position (and/or the prone position), in
both the transverse and longitudinal planes [28]. Particular
attention should to be paid to documentation of subtle
changes in the retrovesical region, the vesicoureteric
junction and any dilated ureter. The renal pelves (and/or
the calyces) are imaged with maximum magnification. A

agent administration in fundamental mode (a, c) and with
harmonic imaging (b, d) of the
bladder and right dilated ureter

kidney (c, d) with a multicystic
dysplastic upper moiety. Reflux
in the right ureter and in the
lower moiety of the duplex
kidney (grade II, arrow) are
much more conspicuous with
harmonic imaging (b, d). Note
also the crisper depiction of the
cysts in the upper moiety with

Pediatr Radiol (2008) 38:40–53 45

scan in the supine position may suffice if adequate
visualization of the renal pelves on both sides is possible,
even though scanning the kidneys with the child in the
prone position definitely allows better demonstration of the
pelvicalyceal system. It should always be kept in mind that
not performing a precontrast scan reduces the duration of
the whole examination. This should be the case whenever
harmonic or other dedicated contrast imaging is used.
Intravesical administration of normal saline and US
contrast agent
The UCA and normal saline are administered via a
transurethral catheter, but suprapubic puncture is also
possible. The administration of UCA is carried out under
US monitoring. The aim should be to have homogeneous
strong contrast agent density of the bladder contents. Early
studies advocated filling the bladder to the maximum prior
to injecting the UCA [13, 28]. This makes the calculation of
UCA volume to be administered easier, but has the
disadvantage that low-pressure reflux may be obscured.
Moreover, in neonates and infants due to repeated voiding
at small bladder filling volume, there is insufficient time to
administer UCA and scan the urinary tract. Increasingly, a
more fractional approach to administering UCA is being
practised [21, 40]. It is important to note that emptying the
bladder for the sake of UCA administration is not
mandatory as explained above. It is helpful to inject UCA
into a bladder that is not completely empty in order to have
better visualization of the microbubbles and avoid a strong
dorsal acoustic shadow. Using a three-way valve it is easy
to alternately administer normal saline and UCA adjusting
the volume of UCA to the bladder filling volume and in the
end reaching the recommended dose. The Levovist suspension should be administered slowly for two reasons: first,
to minimize the destruction of the microbubbles and
Fig. 4 VUS with the use of a
dedicated contrast imaging modality using high-MI (agent detection imaging, ADI). Note the
time and number of the images

has been documented it is possible as a postprocessing option
to switch between the different
modalities for display: a “greyscale + contrast” and b “contrast
only” options. In this case of

second, to reduce settling of the suspension at the bottom of
the bladder that would create an acoustic shadow that
temporarily obscures the retrovesical region [28]. In such a
case, turning the child several times from side to side
hastens the homogeneous distribution of the UCA in the
bladder. The administration of normal saline is continued
until the child has the urge to micturate or there is the first
slight sign of back pressure to the infusion or injection.
Postcontrast scan of the bladder, ureters and kidneys
The US scan after contrast agent administration is basically
carried out in the same manner as that before contrast agent
administration. There are minor procedural variations
depending on the type of US modality utilized. The
diagnosis of reflux is made when echogenic microbubbles
appear in a ureter or renal pelvis. When a ureter is distinctly
visible behind the bladder, the microbubbles render the
echo-free lumen echogenic. When the ureter is not clearly
visible as a round echo-free structure, VUR can be
demonstrated if microbubbles are seen entering the vesicoureteric junction or if just behind this junction, one can
depict a round echogenic spot in transverse section, which
can be differentiated from its surroundings by its strong
echogenicity and possibly constant movement of microbubbles [28]. When the reflux reaches the kidney the
echogenic microbubbles can be detected in the pelvicalyceal system. In a recent study by Kopac et al. [23] the need
for UCA to demonstrate reflux was again emphasized.
They compared indirect non-contrast VUS with contrastenhanced VUS in 47 children with 93 PUUs. In the former
there was no catheterization and bladder filling and any
increase in renal pelvic and proximal ureteric width during
voiding was considered as a sign of VUR. Compared to VUS
with UCA this was found to have low diagnostic accuracy of
only 59%, which is not sufficiently reliable for routine use.
Postcontrast scan of the bladder, ureters and kidneys
during and after voiding
The US examination is continued during and after voiding
in a similar manner as above, always scanning the right and
left kidneys alternately, and also the bladder if the patient’s
position allows. If cyclic filling is not planned, the catheter
can be removed prior to micturition. Most children can void
around a thin catheter on the examination table while lying
supine, prone or on the side [28]. Other alternatives to
consider are to have the child sit on a potty and to scan the
kidneys from the back. A “music potty” that signals
voiding with music is helpful. In older boys the option to
micturate into a urine bottle while standing and being
scanned from the back may be offered. At the end the
bladder is checked for residual urine.
Postcontrast scan of the urethra during voiding
(urethrosonography)
The main focus in VUS has been on detection of reflux. In
the past, transperineal imaging of the urethra was not given
as much consideration during VUS. The lack of urethral
imaging in VUS was regarded as a drawback compared to
VCUG [46, 47]. In recent years there has been an increased
interest in the inclusion of urethral imaging. To date, six
studies are available that deal exclusively or partly with
contrast-enhanced voiding US of the urethra [16, 19, 48–
51]. In these studies the urethra was examined in a total of
847 children comprising 647 (76%) boys and 200 (24%)
girls (age range 1 day to 15 years). Levovist in combination
with fundamental imaging was used in all children. In half
of the studies, both boys and girls were included and in the
remainder only boys [19, 48, 49]. An unbiased comparison
of all cases with VCUG was carried out in only two studies
[48, 49]. In three studies just those children with pathological findings of the urethra by voiding urethrosonography
underwent VCUG [19, 50, 51]. In the remaining one study
the selection for comparison was not clearly presented [16].
The diagnosis of posterior urethral valve was made in 22
boys (3.3%) using transperineal contrast-enhanced voiding
urethrosonography (Fig. 5). This was also found to be
suitable for assessment of the urethra after valve resection
[48, 49]. Other diagnoses in boys were anterior urethral
valve and urethral stenosis [48]. All diagnoses were
confirmed by VCUG. However, the urethral pathologies
detected were not only too few, but also the range of
pathologies encountered was small [47]. Other urethral
pathologies such as paraurethral cysts, diverticula, double
urethra, urethral fistula, and complex anorectal and cloacal
malformations are still missing in these series. Urethrovaginal reflux was evaluated in two studies and was found to
be present in 67 of 165 girls (40.6%) [19, 49].
The most important study comparing contrast-enhanced
voiding urethrosonography and VCUG is that by Berrocal
et al. [49]. In this prospective study a total of 146 children
(87 boys, 59 girls) with a mean age of 3.3 years (8 days to
14 years) were recruited. In the voiding part of VUS,
primarily transperineal US of the urethra was performed.
During voiding the catheter was removed. The diameters of
the anterior and posterior parts of the urethra were
measured at maximum dilatation during voiding. In boys
the normal value was found to be 6.1±0.8 mm (2.8–
7.1 mm) and 6.3±0.67 mm (3.7–7.2 mm), respectively. In
girls the urethral diameter was 4.2±1.0 mm (2.5–7.8 mm).
This was the basis for evaluation of pathological changes in
the urethra. In all children the US study was followed by
VCUG. There were three boys with posterior urethral
valves detected on US with dilated posterior urethra,
reduced diameter of the anterior urethra and delay in
Pediatr Radiol (2008) 38:40–53 47

UCA flow at the valve. Furthermore, urethral stenosis was
diagnosed in two boys. Seven children were evaluated after
resection of the posterior urethra valves and were found to
have a normal posterior urethral diameter in the presence of
dilatation of the anterior part without any flow delay. In all
children these findings were confirmed on VCUG. All girls
and 75 boys showed a normal urethra at both transperineal
US and VCUG. Thus sensitivity and specificity were each
100%. The approximate mean duration for VUS including
transperineal voiding US was 30 min. In conclusion,
transperineal contrast-enhanced VUS of the urethra has
not only been shown to be possible but also to be a
potential adjunct to VUS in routine examinations.
Cyclical filling of the bladder
VUR is an intermittent phenomenon. Differences in
presence and degree of reflux on repeated examinations
have been reported in both VCUG and RNC [52, 53]. In
general, cyclical filling results in an increase in reflux
detection rate. Repeated filling of the bladder may be
necessary when there is marked discrepancy in kidney size
and/or intermittent dilatation of the ureters on US and a
negative result during the initial examination. VUS has a
specific advantage in this regard as it is not associated with
repeated exposure to radiation. Three studies have evaluated the value of cyclical filling in VUS [54–56]. In two of
the studies, two cycles of bladder filling including Levovist
administration were carried out with scanning in fundamental mode [54, 55]. One study was performed in 27
patients with transplanted kidneys [54]. This group comprised eight children (age range 12.2–18.3 years) and 19
adults (age range 19.2–54.8 years). The reflux detection
rate in the first and second cycles was 17 and 16 of 27,
respectively, and thus not very different, but there were
significantly higher reflux grades in the second cycle. So
the conclusion was that cyclical filling in VUS with
fundamental imaging did not result in increased reflux
detection rate. In another study with a greater number and
wider spectrum of patients, exclusively children, the
opposite was found. Novljan et al. [55] evaluated cyclical
filling in 49 children (age range 1.4–15.8 years, mean
4.1 years) with 98 PUUs. A total of 35 PUUs with reflux
were detected when taking both cycles into account. In the
first cycle 28 of 35 and in the second 33 of 35 of the PUUs
were positive. In the first cycle only just 2 of 35 refluxes
(both grade II) were detected. The VUR diagnosed in the
second cycle alone comprised six PUUs with grade II and
one PUU with grade III reflux. Not only were 25% more
refluxing units detected in the second cycle but also 50%
more grade III refluxes.
When the bladder is completely emptied one can often
still find residual echogenic UCA lining the bladder mucosa
which together with the hypoechoic wall resembles the
mouth part of a “smile sign” (Fig. 6). This so-called “smile
sign” indicates that there is still enough UCA in the bladder
to facilitate repeat filling with normal saline alone and
allow another cycle of VUS. Papadopoulou et al. [56]
found that in 112 of 117 children (96%) undergoing
cyclical harmonic VUS the residual UCA in the bladder
was sufficient to allow a second filling with normal saline
only. In the 112 children (224 PUUs) they compared the
results of the first cycle with Levovist and normal saline
administration with those of a second cycle with administration of only normal saline. VUR was detected in 57 PUUs
in the first cycle, and of the remaining 167 nonrefluxing
PUUs, 12 showed VUR in the second cycle (one grade I,
nine grade II, two grade III). Only one PUU reflux (grade

II) was diagnosed in the first cycle but missed in the second
cycle. Considering all refluxing units as true positives, the
sensitivities of the first and second cycles were 87% and
98% and the negative predictive values 84% and 98%,
respectively. Thus a second cycle of harmonic VUS with no
addition of UCA reveals significantly more PUUs with
VUR at almost no additional cost for the examination.
From the current standpoint of available data, cyclical
filling in VUS, particularly when using harmonic imaging,
seems to be a very promising adjunct.
Grading of reflux
VUR grading is necessary because the severity of reflux
correlates with prognosis and consequently serves as a basis for
therapeutic decision making. It is also essential to have a
uniform grading system for comparison between different
research studies. The reflux gradings are based on the degree of
pelvicalyceal and ureteral dilatation. Intrarenal reflux is not
taken into consideration for grading purposes. It is to be noted
that it is possible to depict intrarenal reflux in VUS, particularly
when using harmonic imaging and other high-MI modalities
[13, 57]. No systematic evaluation of intrarenal reflux in VUS
is available. The first grading system for VUS was proposed
in 1985 by Beyer et al. [58]. Here grading was for VUS with
administration of normal saline only into the bladder. This
sonographic grading has five levels based on the extent of
dilatation of the renal pelvis, calyces and ureters. Taking this
grading system and in conformity with the international reflux
grading for VCUG, a five-level grading system was also
adapted for contrast-enhanced VUS [59, 60]. The diagnosis of
reflux is based on the presence of microbubbles and the
severity of the reflux determined by taking primarily the
pelvicalyceal and secondarily the ureteric dilatation into
account (Table 1). This grading system for VUS has gained
widespread acceptance. With the severity of reflux being a
continuum, no sonographic measurements have been proposed for differentiating between the grades. Unavoidably, as
in VCUG, there is a certain element of subjectivity in the
grading system and also some reflux episodes do not fall
precisely within one of the five grades. The attempt to
differentiate between reflux in dilated and nondilated systems
has not become widely used, probably due to lack of
immediate consequence of such an addition [60].
Duration of VUS examination
In four comparative studies, in which VUS and VCUG
were carried out successively, the duration of each
procedural step was recorded [12, 28, 31, 42]. In two of
the studies VUS was carried out using fundamental mode
[12, 28]. The other two studies incorporated colour Doppler
US [31, 42]. In these studies the durations of VUS,
including catheterization, were in the range 26–34 min
with the precontrast US taking up almost one-third of the
time. The durations of VCUG, adding the time for
catheterization, were in the range 13–20 min. In one other
study VUS and VCUG were carried out simultaneously and
here the duration of one such examination including
catheterization was 9 min [61]. Novljan et al. [55]
performed VUS with cyclical filling (two fillings) and the
mean duration of the VUS was 24 min (range 15–30 min).
Overall, these studies show that the duration of VUS shows
a wide range and is longer than that of VCUG. As
mentioned above the precontrast US may not be necessary
when using harmonic or other dedicated contrast imaging
modalities, resulting in a reduction of the duration of VUS
by almost one-third. This would put the duration of VUS
equivalent to that of VCUG.

Fig. 6 At the end of VUS and bladder emptying there can still be a
“layer” of UCA lining the mucosa of the empty bladder. The
configuration of the bladder in transverse section in combination with
the remaining echogenic UCA resembles the mouth part of a “smile
sign”. This sign indicates that there is still sufficient UCA in the
bladder and if considered necessary a second filling with normal saline
only would suffice to carry out cyclical VUS

VUS with a second-generation US contrast agent
(SonoVue)
In 2001 a second-generation UCA—SonoVue (Bracco,
Milan, Italy)—was approved in the European Union for
IV use in adults. SonoVue is now widely used, the main
application being for the evaluation parenchymal abdominal lesions [62]. Even though it has not been approved yet
for use in children one in-vitro and four clinical studies
point out potential advantages compared to the use of the
first-generation UCA, Levovist [63–67]. SonoVue is composed of a stabilized aqueous suspension of sulphur
hexafluoride (SF6) microbubbles with a phospholipid shell
and is available as a package comprising one vial with
granules and a 5-ml syringe prefilled with normal saline
[62]. In an in-vitro comparative study with Levovist (5%
volume) the contrast duration with SonoVue was seven
times longer at a dose that was 80% lower [63]. It was
found that UCA at 0.25–1.0% of the filling volume would
provide adequate contrast. Moreover, the contrast duration
of a freshly prepared suspension of SonoVue was stable
over 6 h, whereas Levovist showed a significant reduction
after 30 min.
The first clinical studies [64–67], in total comprising 210
children, have shown that low-MI imaging is the most
favourable US modality for VUS when using SonoVue [67]
(Fig. 7). Although it is possible to use all other modalities
with this UCA, the highest contrast difference between
tissue and microbubbles seems to be achieved with low-MI
imaging, in which the tissue is suppressed and the microbubbles become more conspicuous. During intravesical
administration of SonoVue there is a minor difference
compared with Levovist. With the patient in the supine
position at the beginning of injection the UCA accumulates
at the roof of the bladder and thus does not reach the
vesicoureteric junctions [65]. Only after starting normal
saline infusion can a homogeneous distribution of the
microbubbles be observed. Not much acoustic shadowing
of the retrovesical space is encountered. The intravesical
dosages that have been successfully used in clinical studies
are 1% of bladder filling [65] and 1 ml per bladder filling
[67]. This implies that with a 5-ml suspension from one vial
that is stable over 6 h there is the potential for performing
several studies from the one vial. If one vial can be used for
more than one patient, the cost of the UCA, a major
obstacle to the widespread use of VUS, could be reduced. It
is important to note that in some countries there may be
restrictions regarding the use of one vial for more than one
patient.
Contraindications and adverse events from intravesical
administration of US contrast agents
There are no specific contraindications as such to the
intravesical administration of Levovist. There are five
clinical studies including a total of 626 patients with an
age range of 2 days to 20 years, in which systematic
monitoring for possible adverse events related to intravesical administration of Levovist were carried out [12, 20,
28, 41, 42]. The evaluation incorporated all or some of the
following: various levels of vital sign monitoring [12, 28],
assessment for possible signs and symptoms during and
after the procedure, observation for up to 12 h as inpatient
[42], and request to the patient and parents to report any
symptoms in the next 24 h and an active 24-h follow-up by
phone. This evaluation was carried out within the context of
comparative studies, in which VCUG was performed
following VUS. All patients were catheterized for the
examinations. There were 15 patients with transient visible
haematuria during or at completion of voiding at either
VUS or VCUG and one patient each with transient mild
Fig. 7 VUS using the second-generation UCA, SonoVue. The scan
before contrast agent administration (a) uses the tissue harmonic
imaging (THI) modality and the scan after contrast agent administration (b) uses echo contrast imaging (ECI). In the former the MI
(arrow) is high (1.1) while in the latter a low-MI (0.2) technique is
applied. In THI the kidney and particularly the renal pelvis are very
well depicted. The refluxing microbubbles of the second-generation
UCA are displayed most conspicuously using the low-MI imaging
modality

abdominal and urethral pain. For these observed adverse
events the catheterization was primarily to blame rather
than the UCA [68]. No substance-specific adverse events
definitely related to the intravesical administration of
Levovist were observed.
The osmolality of Levovist in solution is about five
times higher than that of blood [37]. This osmolality
corresponds to that of previously used ionic radiographic
contrast agents, which were likewise instilled into the
bladder. No adverse events attributable to the osmolality
were observed with these agents. Apart from this, the
amount of UCA administered is small and in the bladder
there is usually urine and/or normal saline, resulting in
dilution of the hyperosmolar solution. Hyperosmolality of
the UCA can, therefore, be ignored in VUS, particularly as
it lies approximately in the physiological range of osmolality of urine. No animal study has been published on the
potential effect of insonation of the urothelium in the
presence of microbubbles, particularly at high MI settings.
Potential alterations of the urothelium cannot be excluded
with absolute certainty. Over the last 10 years, predominantly in Europe, it is roughly estimated that some 20,000
VUS examinations have been conducted in children
(publications, reports and personal communications). There
have been no reports of clinical adverse effects related to
the intravesical administration of Levovist.
Experience with the new UCA, SonoVue, for VUS is
still very limited. Contraindications for the IV administration are known hypersensitivity to sulphur hexafluoride and
certain cardiopulmonary disorders [29]. Recently, a largescale retrospective analysis showed that IV SonoVue has a
good safety profile in abdominal applications [69]. In the
small number of VUS studies with a total of 210 children
no adverse events directly related to the UCA have been
reported [64–67]. There are, as yet, no detailed studies
regarding any possible interaction with urine and the
urothelium.
Conclusion
It is important to realize that a breakthrough to implement
US for reflux diagnosis, which had began in the late 1970s,
only came with the availability of a stable UCA. Advances
in US technology resulting in marked improvement in the
depiction of microbubbles have facilitated many procedural
aspects in addition to the diagnostic accuracy of the
modality. Furthermore, the first results of VUS with the
use of a more stable second-generation UCA point to
further procedural and diagnostic progress. Like VCUG and
direct RNC, it is still necessary to catheterize the bladder or
perform suprapubic puncture for VUS. This is a major
drawback of all direct reflux examinations and one that
makes them invasive. Attempts to generate bubbles
exogenously using high-intensity focused US would solve
this problem, but have not yet moved beyond the stage of
animal studies [70].
