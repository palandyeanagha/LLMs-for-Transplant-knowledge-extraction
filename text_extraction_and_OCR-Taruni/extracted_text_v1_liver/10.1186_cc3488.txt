Abstract
Introduction Our aims were to assess risk factors, clinical
features, management and outcomes in critically ill patients in
whom Aspergillus spp. were isolated from respiratory
secretions, using a database from a study designed to assess
fungal infections.
Methods A multicentre prospective study was conducted over
a 9-month period in 73 intensive care units (ICUs) and included
patients with an ICU stay longer than 7 days. Tracheal aspirate
and urine samples, and oropharyngeal and gastric swabs were
collected and cultured each week. On admission to the ICU and
at the initiation of antifungal therapy, the severity of illness was
evaluated using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II score. Retrospectively, isolation of Aspergillus spp.
was considered to reflect colonization if the patient did not fulfil
criteria for pneumonia, and infection if the patient met criteria for
pulmonary infection and if the clinician in charge considered the
isolation to be clinically valuable. Risk factors, antifungal use and
duration of therapy were noted.
Results Out of a total of 1756 patients, Aspergillus spp. were
recovered in 36. Treatment with steroids (odds ratio = 4.5) and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio = 2.9) were
significantly associated with Aspergillus spp. isolation in
multivariate analysis. In 14 patients isolation of Aspergillus spp.
was interpreted as colonization, in 20 it was interpreted as
invasive aspergillosis, and two cases were not classified. The
mortality rates were 50% in the colonization group and 80% in
the invasive infection group. Autopsy was performed in five
patients with clinically suspected infection and confirmed the
diagnosis in all of these cases.
Conclusion In critically ill patients, treatment should be
considered if features of pulmonary infection are present and
Aspergillus spp. are isolated from respiratory secretions.
Introduction
Aspergillus is a genus of mitosporic fungi, some species of
which are known to cause infections in humans, particularly
Aspergillus fumigatus (85% of cases) followed by A flavus
and A niger [1]. Aspergillus spp. are responsible for a broad
spectrum of illnesses, from saprophytic colonization of the
bronchial tree to rapidly invasive and disseminated diseases.
Invasive aspergillosis remains a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in immunosuppressed patients with profound granulocytopenia secondary to haematological malignancies, or
solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. Outbreaks of
aspergillosis in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs)
have been reported [2]. Aspergillus spp. can also cause pneumonia in ICU patients without classical predisposing factors,
as well as community-acquired pneumonia in otherwise immunocompetent healthy individuals [3,4].

Because the mortality rate with invasive aspergillosis remains
high, even in the face of therapy, the work up must be prompt
and aggressive. The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult because definitive diagnosis is based on histological documentation of typical hyphae and a culture positive
for an Aspergillus sp. Uncertainty in disease definition is a key
contributor to the controversy regarding the optimal method
for establishing the diagnosis of invasive infection.
Standard definitions of opportunistic fungal infections in
immunocompromised patients with cancer and haematopoietic stem cell transplants were recently proposed [5]. 'Proven'
aspergillosis requires histopathological or cytopathological
examination showing hyphae with evidence of associated tissue damage, or a positive culture result from a sample
obtained using sterile technique along with suggestive clinical
or radiological evidence of infection. In addition, 'probable'
aspergillosis requires the presence of risk factors in the host,
isolation of an Aspergillus sp. and suggestive clinical or radiological findings; 'possible' aspergillosis requires the presence
of risk factors in the host and isolation of an Aspergillus sp., or
suggestive clinical and radiological findings [5]. Serology is
not useful in the diagnosis of aspergillosis, and data regarding
the clinical utility of detection of Aspergillus antigenaemia is
limited to patients with neutropenia [6].
Treatment is mandatory in severely immunocompromised
patients (those with neutropenia or prolonged use of immunosuppressants) with suggestive clinical manifestations or isolation of Aspergillus spp. in respiratory secretions. However, the
therapeutic approach is not well defined in critically ill patients
without neutropenia or transplantation in whom Aspergillus
spp. are cultured in bronchial secretions [7]. Therefore, using
data from a large multicentre study designed to assess risk
factors and the impact of isolation of fungi in ICU patients, the
present study was performed with the following objectives: to
determine risk factors for respiratory isolation of Aspergillus
spp.; to assess clinical features, treatment and outcomes in
patients with Aspergillus spp. recovered from respiratory
secretions; and to evaluate the correlation between isolation
of Aspergillus spp. in respiratory samples and histopathological findings.
Materials and methods
Study population
A total of 1765 patients older than 18 years of age who were
admitted for at last 7 days to 73 medical/surgical ICUs in certain Spanish hospitals between May 1998 and January 1999
were included in the study. The institutional review board of
each hospital approved the protocol and waived the need for
informed consent.
Design
This was a prospective, cohort, observational, multicentre
study. Based on diagnosis at the time of ICU admission,
patients were classified as medical, surgical, or trauma. The
severity of illness on ICU admission was calculated using the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
scoring system [8]. The definitions of severe sepsis and septic
shock used were those of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference [9].
In all patients, samples obtained from sputum, tracheal aspirates (intubated patients), urine, pharyngeal exudates and gastric aspirates were cultured for fungi each week. The initial
samples were obtained 8 days after admission to the ICU and
once a week thereafter. Other samples of peripheral blood or
from other infectious foci were obtained at the discretion of the
attending physician. Samples were processed by the various
reference clinical microbiology laboratories of the participating
hospitals using standard procedures, including Sabouraud
agar culture and BACTEC method (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Paramus, NJ, USA), for the isolation of fungal species. The A20C system (Byomerieux, Lyon,
France) was used for species identification. Candida infection
was defined as recovery of Candida spp. from blood samples
(in one or more culture bottles), or evidence of endophthalmitis, or a positive culture of tissue specimens or peritoneal fluid
culture, or obstruction of the urinary tract by fungal balls.
Risk factors
Various risk factors before ICU admission and during the ICU
stay were recorded. These are summarized in Table 1.
Clinical features
Patients with Aspergillus spp. isolated from respiratory samples were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical significance
of recovery of Aspergillus spp. was determined individually by
the physician in charge, who established whether isolation of
Aspergillus spp. represented a case of colonization or infection. Colonization was deemed to be present when the patient
did not fulfil criteria for pneumonia; if the patient fulfilled criteria
for pneumonia and the clinician in charge considered the isolation of Aspergillus spp. to be clinically valuable, then the
patient was considered to be infected. Specific recommendations regarding therapeutic approach when fungi were isolated from culture were not given, and so the decision
regarding antifungal treatment was made on an individual
basis by the physician in charge. In patients treated with antifungal drugs, adverse events, clinical cure and microbiological
eradication (weekly cultures becoming negative) were
recorded. For each patient in whom an Aspergillus sp. was
detected, clinical data as well as radiographic and computed
tomography findings were retrospectively recorded by means
of a questionnaire completed by the clinician in charge. Radiographic findings included normal chest radiograph, lobar
consolidation, unilateral consolidation, bilateral consolidation
and ill-defined nodules [10].

Patients were followed until discharge from the hospital or
death during the hospital stay. In patients who died with
proven fungal infection or with high suspicion of fungal infection, an autopsy examination was sought.
Statistical analysis
Qualitative variables are expressed as the percentage distribution in each category, and quantitative variables are expressed
as mean ± standard deviation in normally distributed variables
or median (range) when the distribution was not normal. The
Student's t-test or the Mann–Whitney U-test was used for the
comparison of categorical and normally distributed and nonnormally distributed variables, respectively. Analysis of variance or the Kruskal–Wallis test was used in the comparison of
three groups. The χ2 test or the Fisher's exact test was used in
the comparison of categorical variables. A comparison of risk
factors for the isolation of Aspergillus spp. between groups of
patients with Aspergillus spp., patients with Candida spp.
infection, and noncolonized, uninfected patients was conducted. For this purpose, a binary logistic regression analysis
prior to the bivariate analyses was performed. Variables were
included in the model if P ≤ 0.05. Results are expressed as
odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI). P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (version 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
The study population included 1765 patients (1178 [67%]
men; mean [± standard deviation] age 57.8 ± 17.3 years).
Underlying diseases were classified as medical in 44% of
patients, surgical in 47% and trauma in 9%. A total of 1045
patients were classified as colonized or infected with fungi,
and 720 were classified as noncolonized, uninfected patients.
Colonization with Candida spp. was diagnosed in 880
(49.8%) patients, Candida spp. infection in 105 (5.9%), and
infection with fungi other than Candida spp. in 60 (3.4%). In
this group of 60 patients, in whom fungi other than Candida
spp. were isolated, Aspergillus spp. were recovered in 38
(63.3%). An Aspergillus sp. was isolated from respiratory
secretions in 36 patients (tracheal aspirate 35, sputum 1). A
fumigatus was isolated in 35 patients and A niger in one. The
length of ICU stay was similar between patients infected with
Aspergillus spp. and those infected with Candida spp. (32.1
± 21.4 days versus 32.8 ± 22.6 days), but it was significantly
longer than in noncolonized, uninfected patients (18.4 ± 14.1
days; P < 0.001; Table 2).
Compared with noncolonized, uninfected patients, patients
with Aspergillus spp. infection had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (69.4% versus 33%; P < 0.001) and ICU mortality (52.8% versus 24.7%; P < 0.001) rates. Patients with
Candida spp. infection also had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (60.9% versus 33%; P < 0.001) and ICU mortality

(53.3% versus 24.7%; P < 0.001) rates than did noncolonized, uninfected patients.
Risk factors
The frequency of risk factors for fungal infection before ICU
admission were similar in the three groups of patients (Table
2), except for significantly higher rates of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppression and transplantation in the patients with Aspergillus infection, and a
greater prevalence of solid neoplasms in the patients with
Candida infection. With regard to risk factors present during
the ICU stay, neutropenia and treatment with steroids were
significantly more frequent in the Aspergillus group, and total
parenteral nutrition was significantly more common in the Candida group (Table 2). Duration of steroid administration was
also significantly longer in the Aspergillus group (Table 3). In
multivariate analysis, independent factors significantly associated with recovery of Aspergillus spp. compared with noncolonized, uninfected patients were treatment with steroids (OR
= 4.5, 95% CI = 1.73–11; P = 0.002) and COPD (OR = 2.9,
95% CI = 1.06–8.08; P = 0.03). When comparisons with
patients with Candida infection were performed, immunosuppression (OR = 12.9, 95% CI = 1.34–25; P = 0.001), neutropenia (OR = 9.4, 95% CI = 1.9–19.9; P = 0.02) and COPD
(OR = 9.2, 95% CI 1.36–62.5; P = 0.02) emerged as independent factors significantly associated with isolation of
Aspergillus spp.
Clinical characteristics
Aspergillus spp. were isolated from respiratory samples in
severely ill patients, with a mean APACHE II score on ICU
admission of 21.6 ± 6.9 and a mean age of 58.7 ± 16.6 years.
Apart for eight patients with Aspergillus infection, the remaining 28 patients had debilitating underlying disorders, with
COPD (n = 16), immunosuppression (n = 20) and chronic
renal failure (n = 10) being the most common. During their stay
in the ICU, 25 patients received steroids and all but one were
mechanically ventilated. The mean length of ICU stay before
isolation of Aspergillus spp. was 32.1 ± 21.4 days. Previous
use of fluconazole was recorded in eight of the 36 patients
(22.2%) with isolation of Aspergillus spp., and in 41 of the
105 patients (39%) with invasive candidiasis.
In 14 patients without clinical symptoms of pneumonia, isolation of Aspergillus spp. was interpreted by the clinician in
charge as colonization. In two patients Aspergillus spp. were
recovered 24 hours before the patient's death, and so the clinical manifestations could not be evaluated. The remaining 20
patients had signs of severe sepsis or septic shock unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics in association with clinical
manifestations suggestive of pneumonia. In these cases, isolation of Aspergillus spp. was interpreted to represent infection,
and treatment with antifungal agents was started. In seven of
these patients, however, bacteria in association with Aspergillus spp. were isolated from the tracheal aspirates, including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n
= 1), Acitenobacter baumannii (n = 1), Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia (n = 1), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.
and Haemophilus spp. (n = 1). The most frequent radiographic findings were unilateral consolidation and bilateral
consolidation.
Treatment and outcome
In the group of 14 patients with Aspergillus colonization, the
in-hospital mortality rate was 50% (three patients died in the
ICU). Eleven patients were not treated with antifungal drugs,
although risk factors were present in seven. Liposomal amphotericin B was prescribed to three patients (one of these
patients with predisposing risk factors died in the ICU). The

mean cumulative dose of amphotericin B lipid formulation was
3100 mg and the mean duration of treatment was 9 days.
Of the 20 patients with Aspergillus spp. infection 16 died,
yielding an in-hospital mortality rate of 80%. All patients were
given amphotericin B except one patient, who was treated
with intraconazole. Details of treatment are shown in Table 4.
The mean APACHE II score at the beginning of antifungal
treatment was 22.7 ± 8, as compared with 14.3 ± 2.3 in
treated patients colonized with Aspergillus spp. The first
choice antifungals were amphotericin B deoxycholate (administered to eight patients), liposomal amphotericin B (eight
patients) and amphotericin B lipid complex (three patients).
Two patients treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate developed renal failure and treatment was changed to liposomal
amphotericin B in one and amphotericin B lipid complex in the
other. One patient initially treated with amphotericin B lipid
complex was switched to liposomal amphotericin B because
of persistence of infection, with positive cultures, after 2
weeks of treatment. After 3 weeks of treatment with liposomal
amphotericin B, cultures were negative. Eleven patients died,
and in the remaining nine patients treatment was discontinued
after clinical cure. Mean duration of treatment in these nine
patients was 18 days (range 8–35 days). Clinical resolution of
symptoms was achieved with amphotericin B deoxycholate
only in one patient and with the lipid formulation in eight (P <
0.05).
Autopsy was performed in five patients with Aspergillus spp.
infection. In all cases the examination revealed characteristic
hyphae elements within the lung parenchyma with vascular
invasion, which is compatible with the diagnosis of invasive
aspergillosis. All were COPD patients and had been treated
with corticosteroids in the ICU. One patient had a lung cancer.
None of these five patients had neutropenia or haematological
malignancy.
Discussion
This is the largest study to date in which Aspergillus spp. were
isolated from respiratory secretions in a cohort of critically ill
patients, including a large number of immunocompetent
patients. In this group, isolation of Aspergillus spp. mostly
occurred in those with COPD who were treated with steroids

during their ICU stay. However, only 13.8% of patients had
neutropenia – a classic risk factor for Aspergillus infection.
Various small series and case reports have shown that invasive
aspergillosis commonly occurs in critically ill patients admitted
to the ICU because of acute exacerbation of COPD and
treated with intravenous corticosteroids [11-14]. In those
patients steroids were given for a short period (1 week),
whereas in our patients treatment was prolonged (3 weeks). In
contrast, in a recent study of 250 patients with COPD admitted to the ICU because of acute respiratory failure [15], which
did not report on the use of corticosteroids, Aspergillus spp.
were not isolated in any respiratory sample. On the other hand,
prior treatment with fluconazole was not associated with a
higher rate of isolation of Aspergillus spp., as was previously
reported in patients with neutropenia [16].
In one-third of cases in the present study recovery of Aspergillus spp. in respiratory secretions, in the absence of signs of
pneumonia, was considered to represent colonization. However, three of these patients were given antifungal treatment
because of underlying risk factors. An important finding of the
study is that systemic antifungal agents were employed in
patients with Aspergillus spp. colonization with clinical signs
of respiratory infection, despite the fact that associated bacterial pathogens were cultured in almost one-third of cases.
Although autopsies were performed in only five patients with
Aspergillus infection, histopathological findings confirmed the
clinical diagnosis in each case. Our findings are in agreement
with those of a recent autopsy study [17] that confirmed the
diagnostic value of Aspergillus spp. in respiratory secretions
of COPD patients admitted to the ICU and treated with corticosteroids. In contrast, in a study conducted Petri and
coworkers [18] in 435 non-neutropenic ICU patients, fungal
colonization with Aspergillus spp. was found in 4% of cases,
but in none of the patients was a diagnosis of invasive
aspergillosis made.
In one study [19], because of the lack of reliable diagnostic
tools, up to 60% of patients with invasive aspergillosis diagnosed at autopsy had not received antifungal treatment. Isolation of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory secretions has been
regarded as being of limited usefulness in the antemortem
diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. In a study conducted in the
1980 s, Yu and coworkers [20] evaluated 108 patients in
whom Aspergillus spp. were isolated from respiratory secretions, but invasive aspergillosis was not demonstrated in nonimmunosuppressed patients. In a recent study [21], however,
it was shown that malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary
disorder, or corticosteroid use were underlying risk factors for
invasive aspergillosis in patients in whom Aspergillus spp.
were isolated from respiratory secretions. On the other hand,
invasive aspergillosis does not only occur in immunocompromised patients [3]. In a cohort of 439 non-ICU patients with
invasive aspergillosis [22], nine had no apparent underlying
conditions before diagnosis. Likewise, acute communityacquired pneumonia due to Aspergillus spp. – a rare infection
– has been reported in 12 immunocompetent hosts [4].
It is well known that neutropenia is the main risk factor for
aspergillosis because polymorphonuclear neutrophils and
macrophages are the first immunological line of defence
against Aspergillus spp. [6]. However, T-cell mediated,
acquired immunity also plays a role in protecting against fungal
infection [23]. Critically ill patients with prolonged stays in the
ICU exhibit a complex decrease in immune function, with deactivation of macrophages and altered cellular response [24]. In
addition, the immune function of peripheral neutrophils is influenced by acute hyperglycaemia [25]. Furthermore, it has been
shown that corticosteroids suppress neutrophil action against
Aspergillus hyphae [26]. These mechanisms may explain why
Aspergillus infection occurs in ICU patients with a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome or immunoparalysis
during multiorgan failure but without any predisposing factors
[27,28]; they may also account for the association between
corticosteroid use and this invasive fungal infection.
Invasive aspergillosis in ICU patients carries a very high mortality [4,28,29], with an attributable mortality of 18.9% after
adjusting for confounding factors [30]. In non-immunocompromised patients, the success of antifungal treatment depends
on early diagnosis. However, because delayed diagnosis is the
rule, if therapy is not promptly initiated then patients may die
from the disease. Amphotericin B deoxycholate was the only
therapeutic option in the past and was the antifungal agent
used in series with a reported mortality of as high as 100%. In
the present study, although there were no differences in inhospital mortality according to antifungal drug used, clinical
cure rates were higher in patients treated with amphotericin B
lipid formulations. In two patients amphotericin B deoxycholate
was withdrawn because of nephrotoxicity, which increases
mortality significantly [31]. Although greater efficacy of
amphotericin B lipid formulations compared with amphotericin
B deoxycholate in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis has
not been demonstrated [7], the use of the lipid formulations
appears preferable, especially in critically ill patients, because
of better tolerance [32]. New antifungal agents with good
activity against Aspergillus spp. have recently become available. Initial treatment of invasive aspergillosis with voriconazole
led to better response and improved survival than with the
standard approach of initial therapy with amphotericin B [33].
Caspofungine was also effective as salvage therapy in invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis, as compared with standard therapy
[34].
One of the main limitations of the present study was the retrospective design, in which diagnostic and treatment
approaches were not standardized. Also, there were few
cases in which the clinical diagnosis of invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis was confirmed by histopathological evaluation.

Third, mortality rates may be biased by differences in antifungal treatments used at each centre. Nevertheless, the present
data add valuable information regarding the significance of
isolation of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory samples in critically ill patients.
Conclusion
In summary, COPD and treatment with corticosteroids are
major predisposing factors for Aspergillus spp. colonization/
infection in critically ill patients. For this reason, in ICU patients
with these risk factors, antifungal treatment should be considered in the presence of clinical features of pneumonia and isolation of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory secretions. In
contrast, antifungal treatment should not be initiated when
Aspergillus spp. are recovered from bronchial aspirates of critically ill patients without predisposing risk factors and in the
absence of clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia. In
these cases, isolation of Aspergillus spp. should be interpreted as colonization.

Key messages
• COPD and treatment with corticosteroids, and neutropenia are major predisposing factors for respiratory colonization/infection with Aspergillus spp. in critically ill 
patients.
• In ICU patients with these risk factors, antifungal treatment should be considered in the presence of clinical 
features of pneumonia and isolation of Aspergillus spp. 
from respiratory secretions.
• The crude mortality associated with this entity is still 
very high.
