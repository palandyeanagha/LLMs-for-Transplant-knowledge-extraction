Background: The rising prevalence of cirrhotic cases related to non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis has led to an increased number of cirrhotic patients with coexistence of
obesity and muscle mass loss, known as sarcopenic obesity (SO). In patients undergoing
liver transplantation (LT), the presence of SO may worsen prognosis, and increase
morbidity and mortality.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effect of the presence of pre-transplant SO on the
outcomes of LT.
Methods: A comprehensive search was performed in seven medical databases for
studies comparing morbidity and mortality of patients with and without SO after LT.
The primary outcome was overall mortality in the short- (1 year), intermediate- (3 years),
and long- (5 years) term. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was quantified with I2-statistics.
Results: Based on the analysis of 1,515 patients from three articles, SO increased
overall mortality compared to non-SO at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up
(RR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.28-3.33; RR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10-2.51; and RR = 2.08,
95% CI: 1.10-3.93, respectively) without significant between-study heterogeneity for the
short- and intermediate- term (I2 = 0.0% for both) and considerable heterogeneity for
long-term follow-up (I2 = 81.1%).
Conclusion: Pre-transplant SO proved to be a risk factor after LT and was associated
with two times higher mortality at short- and long- term follow-up. Since SO worsens
the prognosis of patients after LT, the inclusion of body composition assessment before
LT may help to plan a more individualized nutritional treatment, physiotherapy, and
postoperative care and may improve morbidity and mortality.

Hegyi et al. Sarcopenic Obesity and Liver Transplantation
INTRODUCTION
Obesity and metabolic syndrome, which can lead to
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are becoming
increasingly common medical problems in the Western world.
Approximately 25% of adults with NAFLD will progress to
inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which
facilitates the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and
end-stage liver disease and, therefore, liver transplantation
(LT). NASH has become the second leading underlying
cause of liver disease among adults on the LT waiting list
in the United States (1–3), and it is expected to become the
leading indication for LT by 2030 (4, 5). These patients often
develop obesity and sarcopenia simultaneously, coined as
sarcopenic obesity (SO) (6).
In western countries, overweight and obesity are now endemic
(7). Although obesity is often seen in transplant recipients, there
is a lack of accurate long-term data on the body composition
of patients after the procedure. Obesity is considered to be
among the most significant threats in healthcare today (8).
More than 32% of the US population is considered to be
obese, based on the body mass index (BMI) cut-off of 30
kg/m2(9, 10). It is common knowledge that obesity increases
the risk of perioperative complications (11) but how it affects
the outcomes of LT in the long-term remains unclear. Studies
have demonstrated that sarcopenia is an independent predictor
of mortality, sepsis, and a more extended hospital stay after
living donor LT (12–14). However, the exact mechanisms by
which sarcopenia elicits poor prognosis are unclear (15). In
the meta-analysis of van Vugt et al. (16), who discuss the
association of skeletal muscle mass and the outcomes of LT
in subjects from 19 studies (3,803 patients), sarcopenia was
common with a prevalence ranging from 22 to 70%. The analysis
revealed an inverse association of low muscle mass with postLT mortality as well as a borderline inverse association with
waiting list mortality [pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were HR = 1.84, CI: 1.11-3.05 and
HR = 1.72, CI: 0.99-3.00, respectively] (16). However, the
authors did not analyze the impact of SO and assessed only
overall survival.
Even though malnutrition and sarcopenia play an essential
role in determining the prognosis of patients with liver
cirrhosis (17), body composition analysis is frequently missing
in clinical assessment, partly because it is often a clinical
challenge to determine cirrhotic patients with fluid retention
(18). Moreover, patients with NASH cirrhosis may develop
a parallel loss of skeletal muscle and gain adipose tissue,
which means that they develop SO (8). Sarcopenic muscle
depletion is characterized by undesired changes on the body,
such as reduced muscle size and an elevated intermuscular to
intramuscular fat ratio, mitochondria dysfunctions, and systemic
inflammation (19).
Based on the suggestions of other studies, this meta-analysis
and systematic review explores whether SO is predictive of
increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis (20, 21). The review
focuses on current knowledge regarding the clinical impact of
pre-transplant SO on post-transplant outcomes in LT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This meta-analysis and review are reported following the
PRISMA Statement (2009) (22). This study is registered in
PROSPERO priori under registration number CRD42019137574.
Search
A systematic literature search was conducted by two independent
reviewers (PH and ZS) for articles that discussed the effect of SO
on outcomes of LT up to March 27, 2019. The search covered
seven databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus,
Web of Science, WHO Global Health Library, ClinicalTrials.gov,
and CENTRAL) with the query “liver transplantation” AND
(sarcopeni∗ OR sarcopaeni∗ OR myopeni∗ OR myopaeni∗
OR “body composition” OR “lean body” OR “muscle mass”
OR “muscle atrophy” OR “muscular atrophy” OR “muscle
depletion” OR “core muscle” OR “muscle strength”) AND (obes∗
OR “fat mass” OR overweight∗). No restrictions were imposed
on the search.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We used the PECOS format to formulate our review question. We
included studies which (P) discussed adult patients after LT with
different etiology [due to alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral
hepatitis, NASH, and autoimmune hepatitis and also patients
transplanted because of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)], and
compared (E) patients with radiologically-proven SO to (C)
those with non-SO body composition. We considered patients
to have SO by adhering to the definitions of individual studies,
all other patients were included in the non-SO group. Outcomes
(O) included peri- and post-transplant clinical outcomes. The
primary outcome was overall mortality on short- (1 year),
intermediate- (3 years), and long-term follow-up (5 years).
Additional outcomes included operation time, perioperative
blood loss, intraoperative erythrocyte transfusion requirement,
and cold ischemic time. As regards the study design (S), we
narrowed the focus to case-control studies and prospective
and retrospective cohort studies (regardless of the publication
type, i.e., abstract or full-text format). If there were multiple
publications on the same cohorts of patients, the larger study
population was included.
Selection
Duplicates were removed with EndNote X7.4 (Clarivate
Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, US), then title, abstract and full-text
screening was performed by the two reviewers (PH and ZS)
against the eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved
by consensus.
Data Collection
Data were independently extracted from studies and added to
a pre-defined Excel datasheet (Office 365, Microsoft, Redmond,
WA, US) by two reviewers in duplicate (PH and ZS). These
included data on study setting (design, geographical region,
centers, recruitment period), the essential characteristics of the
study population (age, gender distribution, and etiology subtypes
for LT), diagnostic criteria for SO, and outcomes with timing. We

Hegyi et al. Sarcopenic Obesity and Liver Transplantation
attempted to contact the corresponding authors of the relevant
articles via email to obtain further data (20, 23, 24).
Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment
We used Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) to assess the
studies included as per the manual of use (25). Details of
assessment are presented in Supplementary Appendix 1.
Statistical Analysis
All meta-analytical calculations were performed by Stata 15.1
data analysis and statistical software (Stata Corp LLC, College
Station, TX, USA) by a statistician (AS).
The available data allowed us to perform the analysis only on
overall mortality. The reference group of comparison was the
SO group. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) with CIs with
the random-effects model using the Der Simonian–Laird method
(26). The result of the meta-analysis was displayed graphically
using forest plots. We performed separate analyses for short-,
intermediate-, and long-term follow-up, as defined in the PECOS
(see above).
Heterogeneity was tested by using Cochrane’s Q and the
I
2
statistics, where I
2 = 100% × (Q–df)/Q, and represent
the magnitude of heterogeneity (moderate: 30–60%, substantial:
50–90%, considerable: 75–100%) (27).
If at least three studies were included in an analysis, we
performed a sensitivity analysis by testing the effect of each study
on the main association.
RESULTS
Search and Selection
The flow chart of the selection process is detailed in Figure 1.
Using the search query, we identified 697 records in seven
databases for evaluation, 66 in MEDLINE, 219 in Embase, 8 in
CENTRAL, 226 in Scopus, 163 in Web of Science, 13 in WHO
Global Health Library, and 2 in ClinicalTrials.gov. After the
removal of duplicates and careful selection, 5 articles were judged
to be eligible for inclusion (20, 21, 23, 24, 28), 2 of which discussed
an overlapping study population (21, 24), from these, we kept the
article including more patients (24) and excluded the other (21).
Altogether, four papers were included in the systematic review,
three of which were eligible for meta-analysis.
Characteristics of the Studies Included
The main characteristics of the studies included are summarized
in Table 1. Two articles recruited subjects from North-America
(20, 28), another two from Japan (23, 24). All were retrospective
cohort studies. By etiology of liver disease, 3 papers included
mixed populations (20, 24, 28), while 1 included only patients
with HCC (23).
Body composition was assessed with CT scan in all studies
approximately at the level of L3 vertebra, complemented with
dual X-ray absorptiometry in 1 study (28). Sarcopenia was
defined based on skeletal muscle mass index, while obesity was
defined based on BMI and/or the visceral fat area in the articles.
Since the cut-off values of the metrics differed across studies, SO
was not uniformly defined in the individual articles, as detailed
in Table 1.
Findings of the Meta-Analysis and
Systematic Review
In our meta-analysis, we included 3, 2, and 3 articles to calculate
mortality for short- (23, 24, 28), intermediate- (23, 28), and
long-term follow-up (23, 24, 28), respectively. There were 114
vs. 498 patients in short-, 108 vs. 227 patients in intermediate-
, and 114 vs. 498 patients in long-term follow-up in the SO and
non-SO groups, respectively. SO significantly increased mortality
on short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up (19 vs. 14%,
RR = 2.06, CI: 1.28-3.33; 30 vs. 16%, RR = 1.67, CI: 1.10-2.51
and 39 vs. 24%, RR = 2.08, CI: 1.10-3.93, respectively) (Figure 2).
When we omitted the studies one-by-one in sensitivity analysis,
the direction of the main association changed only if we removed
the study of Itoh et al. (23) from the analysis on long-term
mortality (RR = 2.12, CI: 0.97-5.70), while [I2] reduced from 81.1
to 0.0%.
Three studies reported Kaplan-Meier curves for long-term
follow-up (5 to 12 years). Although lower survival rates were
reported for sarcopenic patients, there was no statistically
significant difference between the groups in the analysis by
Carias et al. (28). In the analysis provided by Kamo et al. (24),
SO patients only had significantly worse survival compared to
non-sarcopenic non-obese patients if the visceral fat area was
used over the skeletal muscle index (p < 0.01 vs. p = 0.338) (24).
Patients transplanted for HCC with low skeletal muscle massto-visceral fat area ratio (SVR) had significantly worse overall
and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01) (23). In
this study, SO proved to be an independent negative predictor of
both recurrence-free survival and post-transplant mortality on a
median follow-up of 5 years (HR = 5.26, CI: 2.03-13.8, p < 0.001
and HR = 2.58, CI: 1.17-5.52, p = 0.019, respectively).
One study reported that post-transplant mean survival (114
vs. 132 months, p = 0.1), length of hospital stay (35 vs. 31
days, p = 0.6), length of intensive care unit stay (8 vs. 8 days,
p = 0.9), and the rate of bacterial infection (26 vs. 19%, p = 0.2)
were statistically not different between SO and non-SO groups,
respectively (20). In another study, perioperative mortality was
higher in the SO group compared to non-SO patients (5.0 vs.
0.6%, respectively; p-value was not reported) (28).
Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment of the
Individual Studies
The summary of our risk of bias assessment is shown in Table 2.
The adapted QUIPS tool and the details of the assessment can
be found in Supplementary Appendix 1. The domain “study
attrition” not fitting our meta-analysis were omitted due to
the retrospective design of the included studies. Based on our
analysis, the studies of Kamo et al. (24) and Carias et al. (28) were
the highest-rated, with only one unclear domain of high risk of
bias, while the studies of Itoh et al. (23) and Montano-Loza et al.
(20) showed worse results, having two domains which carried
high and another domain which carried an unclear risk of bias.
Additionally, all the studies included were judged to be at high

risk in one domain or more. The domain “study participation”
had the highest-rate, as all the included studies were judged to
be at low risk of bias. On the contrary, 100% of the studies were
judged to be at high risk in terms of “study confounding,” since
they failed to report how significant confounders were adjusted
for and if an adequate method was used for treating missing data.
“Prognostic factor measurement” and “outcome measurement”
domains were assessed as having a low risk of bias in 75% of
all studies. All studies carried an unclear risk of bias concerning
“statistical analysis and reporting.”

DISCUSSION
Summary of Findings
The effect of body composition changes, especially the wasting of
skeletal muscles (sarcopenia) has been investigated and reported
for various diseases (8).
Our meta-analysis is the first to examine the impact of SO,
which is defined by the combination of low skeletal muscle mass
index and either high visceral fat area or high BMI, on mortality
after LT. The meta-analysis identified that pre-operative SO
is associated with an almost two times higher mortality rate
at short- intermediate- and long-term follow-up compared to
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 599434

Hegyi et al. Sarcopenic Obesity and Liver Transplantation
non-SO groups (RR = 2.06, CI: 1.28-3.33; RR = 1.67, CI: 1.10-
2.51; and RR = 2.08, CI: 1.10-3.93, respectively; Figure 2).
There are currently no generally accepted criteria for
sarcopenia, which results in heterogeneous protocols and hinders
efforts to generalize evidence. Measuring muscle strength
remains easier and cheaper than measuring muscle mass. In the
case of a more detailed and thorough clinical examination, the
use of functional tests and more sophisticated methods (such as
DEXA or computed tomography) should be considered (29).
Despite the rising prevalence of SO among LT patients,
especially in the subgroup of NASH (11), the optimal
management of obese and overweight LT candidates remained
undetermined. Increased body mass index is commonly observed
after LT (30), and it appears that much of this weight gain is an
increase in fat mass (31). Although muscle function improves
after organ transplantation within the first 3 months, the skeletal
muscle remains below pre-transplant values (32). In an article
by Carias et al. analyzing 207 patients, half of the patients were
obese, 59% had sarcopenia, and SO was detected in 13% of
them pre-transplant. Six months after transplantation sarcopenia
was found in 95% of previously sarcopenic patients, of which
41.7% fulfilled the criteria for SO (28). Several studies identified
independent pre-transplant predictors of mortality for post liver
transplant patients. Kamo et al. (24) undertook a multivariate
analysis and found that ABO incompatibility, low skeletal muscle
mass index, high intramuscular adipose tissue content, and
high visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio, were
independent risk factors of death. In a univariate analysis, BMI<
25 kg/m2, graft type other than right graft, and operation time
<12 h were also found to be risk factors. Itoh et al. (23) identified
low muscle mass-to-visceral fat area ratio as an independent
risk factor among cancer-specific variables. Chae et al. have
found that more than 11.7% of the perioperative decrease of
the psoas muscle index was also independently associated with
survival after LT (33). Krell et al. found that pretransplant
total bilirubin level is independently associated with a risk of
developing severe infections and a worse 1-year survival rate (34).
It is important to emphasize that appropriate post-transplant
intervention, including nutritional therapy, rehabilitation with
an evaluation of skeletal muscle mass and muscle functions,
and physical activity interventions are recommended for better
outcomes. Patients may benefit from inpatient rehabilitation
programs that have been shown to decrease 30-day readmission
rates (35). Although physical activity generally increases after LT,
more than 75% of patients remain sedentary (36, 37). Regular
exercise can optimize functioning after LT and should optimally
begin in the pre-transplant setting (38). These justify the role of
body composition measurements as part of the pre-transplant
risk stratification and draw attention to the potential beneficial
effect of the post-transplant correction of SO. The prognostic role
of body composition was highlighted in HCC patients too. Based
on the adjusted analysis of data on 1,257 patients, sarcopenia
was an independent predictor of mortality (HR = 1.52; CI:
1.18-1.96) (39). Sarcopenia is also known to be associated with
a higher complication rate, including hepatic encephalopathy,
ascites formation, and infectious complications. SO is a risk
factor not only for cirrhotic patients but also for those with
cardiovascular diseases. Upadhya et al. confirmed the consistency
between SO and the pathogenesis of exercise intolerance in heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction in the elderly (40). Farmer
et al. conducted a cohort study using the UK Biobank. They
concluded associations between SO and the risk of cardiovascular
disease and mortality. SO carried a high risk of developing
heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, and impaired exercise
capacity (41).
Strengths and Limitations
This analysis is the first to assess mortality in sarcopenic obese
patients who underwent liver transplantation. We distinguished
between short-, intermediate-, and long-term mortality.
Although the original objective of this work was to analyze
the effect of SO in patients who underwent LT due to NASH
(as declared in the PROSPERO record), we were unable to
perform the analysis due to lack of data. For the same reason,
we could not compare patients with SO to those with normal
and pathological body compositions (including sarcopenia and
obesity alone). Instead, we performed an unplanned subgroup
analysis on mortality for different time intervals.
The present meta-analysis involved data from only four
articles. It must be noted, however, that we detected significant
differences despite the limited study populations, excluding the
chance of beta-type error. The number of studies prevented us
from analyzing publication bias (<10 studies).
Since there is no consensus for the definition of SO (42), it was
not uniform across studies nor was the way of body composition
analysis (methodological heterogeneity, see in Table 1). This may
also explain the divergence in the reported survival rates.
This study also has some limitations. The heterogeneity
detected in the analysis of long-term survival may be explained
by clinical heterogeneity due to the fact that the study of Itoh S et
al. only included HCC population (23) (see, results of sensitivity
analysis). On the other hand, there was no heterogeneity
detected in the analysis of short- and intermediate term survival
(homogenous datasets, see in Figure 2).
All the articles were published in North-America (20, 28) and
Japan; (23, 24), meaning that data may not be representative of
other geographical regions (6).
We do not have detailed information about the effects
of covariates affecting survival (selection bias). However, the
only study that adjusted the results for significant covariates,
does agree with our results (23). Finally, all the included
articles were retrospective cohort analysis, indicating a low level
of evidence.
CONCLUSION
Implications for Practice
In conclusion, patients with SO showed worse survival after LT
compared with non-SO patients. Abnormal body compositions
including low skeletal muscle mass and visceral adiposity have
substantial negative impacts on survival after LT, SO is associated
with two times higher mortality both at short and long-term
follow up. However, due to the coexistence of obesity with
muscle mass depletion, sarcopenia might be overlooked. Since
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 7 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 599434

Hegyi et al. Sarcopenic Obesity and Liver Transplantation
a CT scan is mandatory before LT, data are available on muscle
mass, estimating body composition, and diagnosis of SO for
all patients before LT. Clinicians should use this advantage by
combining other simple-to-perform methods such as mid-arm
muscle circumference measurements or assessment of skeletal
muscle contractile function using a Handgrip strength method
to detect malnutrition and take the available information into
account when making a plan for the management of these
patients both pre and post-transplant (43).
Implications for Research
These results imply that the incorporation of body composition
assessment into complex clinical prognostic scores (e.g., MELD
or Child-Pugh score systems) may be beneficial, and should
be tested under various clinical settings. Considering the global
epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, NASH is expected
to become one of the leading causes of LT both for endstage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,
it is desirable to initiate further extensive prospective studies
to explore the effect of all aspects of body composition,
malnutrition, and SO on various outcomes of LT. Furthermore,
the relationship between pre-transplant steroid therapy and
the types of immunosuppressive treatment used after LT and
SO should be investigated. Follow-up of body composition
after transplantation (e.g., sarcopenia, obesity, and SO) should
be undertaken to understand the complex effects of the
pathophysiologic and therapeutic changes on sarcopenia after LT.
Further research is needed to find out what factors affect the
development of sarcopenic obesity after liver transplantation and
what interventions could help reduce the high post-transplant
mortality in patients with SO, using a standardized approach.
