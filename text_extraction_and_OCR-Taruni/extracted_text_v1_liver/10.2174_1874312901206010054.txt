Abstract: Objective: Given the difficulties regarding the interpretation of common laboratory test results in polymyositis 
(PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) in clinical practice, we assessed their range of abnormalities, differences among 
phenotypes and interrelationships in a large referral population. 
Methods: We retrospectively assessed 20 commonly measured blood laboratory tests in 620 well-defined PM/DM patients 
at different stages of illness and treatment to determine the frequency, range of abnormalities and correlations among 
clinical, gender, racial and age phenotypes. 
Results: Myositis patients at various stages of their disease showed frequent elevations of the serum activities of creatine 
kinase (51%), alanine aminotransferase (43%), aspartate aminotransferase (51%), lactate dehydrogenase (60%), aldolase 
(65%) and myoglobin levels (48%) as expected. Other frequent abnormalities, however, included elevated high white 
blood cell counts (36%), low lymphocyte counts (37%), low hematocrit levels (29%), low albumin levels (22%), high 
creatine kinase MB isoenzyme fractions (52%), high erythrocyte sedimentation rates (33%) and high IgM and IgG levels 
(16% and 18%, respectively). Many of these tests significantly differed among the clinical, gender, racial and age groups. 
Significant correlations were also found among a number of these laboratory tests, particularly in the serum activity levels 
of creatine kinase, the transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase and aldolase. 
Conclusion: Laboratory test abnormalities are common in PM/DM. Knowledge of the range of these expected 
abnormalities in different myositis phenotypes, gender and age groups and their correlations should assist clinicians in 
better interpretation of these test results, allow for a clearer understanding what level of abnormality warrants further 
evaluation for liver or other diseases, and may avoid unnecessary laboratory or other testing.

INTRODUCTION 
 The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a 
group of autoimmune muscle diseases of which polymyositis 
(PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the most frequently 
recognized forms [1]. Although the IIM are the most 
commonly acquired muscle diseases in adults, they are still 
rare in the general population with an estimated annual 
incidence of only 10 new cases per million persons. These 
diseases are difficult to diagnose and categorize into 
predictive groups [2]. Their diagnosis and treatment are 
often delayed because patients initially present with vague or 
nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, and 
arthralgias, which are also common in other types of 
illnesses [3]. 
 The serum activity level of creatine kinase (CK) is the 
most commonly performed enzyme test for the diagnosis and 
monitoring of myositis [1, 4, 5]. This is due to the relative 
muscle specificity of the enzyme and the infrequent

involvement of other organs that can generate CK (brain, 
cardiac muscle) in patients with IIM [6]. Although elevations 
of CK and other serum muscle enzyme activities are used as 
one criterion for diagnosis [7], few studies have assessed the 
other laboratory blood tests often ordered in myositis 
patients, leading to misconceptions and a lack of 
understanding of the meaning of the test results obtained [5]. 
Our anecdotal experience is that many unnecessary tests are 
performed on myositis patients to assess for other conditions 
in response to laboratory abnormalities that are actually the 
result of the myositis. For example, elevations of serum 
activities of the so called “liver enzymes”, the transaminases 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) in myositis patients due to 
myoblast activation, have resulted, and in our experience 
continue to result, in the misdiagnosis of liver disease and 
inappropriate liver biopsies [1]. Likewise, elevations in the 
serum activity of the CK-MB fraction isoenzyme (CK-MB) 
can result in the misdiagnosis of myocardial infarction [8]. 
The current study was conducted to address these issues by 
assessing the results of 20 routine blood laboratory tests 
from a large group of myositis subjects evaluated at the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH). This population would 
be representative of a referral population at different stages 
of disease progression and with various levels of disease 
activity undergoing different treatments. Our findings of

frequent abnormalities in these tests and differences among 
phenotypes should aid clinicians in better understanding the 
utility of various laboratory tests in myositis patients seen in 
clinical practice. 
MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY 
 Patient population. The participants in the study were 
620 patients (181 men and 439 women; 351 with PM and 
269 with DM; 427 Caucasians, 130 blacks and 63 of other 
races) of the initial 800 consecutive individuals with 
myopathies who were evaluated in natural history and 
therapeutic research protocols in the National Institute of 
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) 
between 1985 and 2005. All subjects signed informed 
consent for NIAMS institutional review board approved 
protocols. Most subjects were referred for recommendations 
for therapy, possible inclusion in therapeutic trials or for 
diagnostic purposes. Selection criteria for this study included 
adult patients with the diagnosis of PM or DM on the basis 
of the exclusion of other forms of myopathy and meeting 
probable or definite Bohan and Peter criteria [9], and who 
had results for at least 15 of the 20 laboratory tests 
commonly assessed in myositis patients at the NIH. All 
laboratory tests were performed in the NIH Department of 
Laboratory Medicine of the NIH Clinical Center and data 
from the first time that at least 15 concurrent laboratory test 
values were available were used. Subjects with criteria for 
possible myositis (n=35), muscular dystrophies (n=29), 
inclusion body myositis (n=28), cancer-associated myositis 
(n=9), juvenile myositis (n=5) metabolic myopathies (n=4), 
PM or DM but fewer than 15 concurrent laboratory tests 
available (n=27), and undefined myopathies (n=43) were 
excluded from study. 
 Data recording. Data collected in this retrospective 
cohort study included demographics (age, gender and race), 
clinical information (the presence of Gottron’s papules or 
sign or Heliotrope rash to define DM), and 20 laboratory 
tests commonly performed on myositis patients at the NIH. 
The laboratory tests included were serum levels of albumin, 
creatinine, aldolase, CK (total level and isoenzymes CK-BB, 
CK-MB, CK-MM), quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM 
and IgA levels), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total 
white blood cell count (WBC) and differential (including 
percent basophils, lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes), hematocrit, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), LD, and myoglobin. When 
the normal reference ranges changed during the study period, 
laboratory results were expressed in relation to the upper 
limits of the normal range and recalculated based upon the 
current normal range. 
 Statistical analysis. Data analyses were performed using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 
10.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL.), following the SPSS Base 
10.0 for Windows User's Guide (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL.), 
and Stata version 11 (Austin, TX). Because analyses using 
the Shapiro-Wilk test showed that all 20 of the laboratory 
measurements were not normally distributed, the summary 
measures reported are medians and interquartile ranges. The 
proportions of subjects with abnormally high and low values 
were calculated based on the normal ranges established for 
healthy individuals at the NIH Department of Laboratory 
Medicine (established to cover 95% of normal individuals). 
Due to the non-normality of the distribution of 
measurements, the primary analyses to assess possible 
differences in laboratory tests in demographic groups (i.e., 
male and female gender; Caucasian, black, and other races; 
age tercile groups of <37, 37-50, and >50 years) and in 
clinical groups (i.e., PM and DM), were performed via the 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (for two groups), the 
Kruskal-Wallis test (for the three unordered racial 
categories), or Kuzick’s nonparametric trend test (“nptrend” 
test in Stata) for the three ordered age categories. 
 Correlations of selected laboratory values used 
Spearman's rank correlation to accommodate the 
non-normality of the values. For this study we defined 
Rho correlations as falling into four categories: 
0.7-1.0 = high correlation; 0.5- <0.7 = moderate correlation; 
0.3- <0.5 = low correlation; and <0.3 = little correlation [10]. 
 Additional analyses used multiway ANOVA or 
prediction intervals based on linear regression models. For 
these analyses either logarithms of the raw values were used 
(14 of the parameters) or the inverse hyperbolic sine 
transformed-values were used (for six parameters: basophils, 
lymphocytes, Polys, ESR, and the three CK isoenzyme 
values; this transformation is very similar to a log 
transformation, but is more flexible in allowing 0, or even 
negative, values). As indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test and 
other confirmatory tests, these transformations greatly 
reduced the skewness of the distributions and resulted in 
more Gaussian-like distributions. The multiway ANOVA 
analyses were used to confirm the primary univariate group 
comparisons, by including in each analysis gender, race, and 
diagnosis. In assessing the effect of age, all three factors of 
gender, race, and diagnoses were taken into account. 
 Because this was an exploratory study, a two-sided p
value of <0.05 was considered significant for these analyses, 
with no correction for multiple comparisons. 
RESULTS 
 Laboratory test abnormalities in IIM patients. As 
expected, many of the IIM patients frequently had various 
enzyme values above the normal limits (Table 1). The 
abnormal laboratory results included skeletal muscle markers 
such as aldolase, CK, CK-MB, LD, myoglobin, and 
transaminases (ALT and AST), as well as acute and chronic 
inflammatory markers (WBC count, polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes, ESR, and immunoglobulins IgG and IgM). 
 In contrast, a number of other test results were frequently 
below the normal range. Of these, low CK-MM levels, 
lymphocyte counts, and creatinine levels have been 
previously reported in patients with IIM [5, 11, 12]. Low 
hematocrit and serum albumin levels, however, have not 
been systematically described in myositis. 
 Differences in laboratory test results among gender, 
race, age, and IIM clinical groups. CK levels were 
significantly higher in men compared to women, in blacks 
compared to Caucasians and in PM compared to DM (Fig. 
1), as previously described [13]. CK-MB levels were also 
significantly higher in men compared to women with IIM. 
The median aldolase levels were also above normal in all 
groups and they were significantly higher in men, blacks and 

56 The Open Rheumatology Journal, 2012, Volume 6 Volochayev et al. 
in patients with PM. Age also seemed to impact the aldolase 
levels. There was a significant trend for values to go down in 
older age groups primarily due to the oldest age tercile (>50 
years) being significantly lower than the other two terciles. 
Similar age-related trends were seen in all three skeletal 
muscle markers (CK, CK-MB and aldolase; Fig. 1). 
 The median values tended to be borderline high for both 
AST and ALT in most groups, while above normal for LD in 
all groups (Fig. 2). There were statistically significant 
differences in gender, race and clinical diagnosis groups for 
AST and ALT. Men had higher levels of these enzymes than 
women, as has been described in healthy populations [14]. 
On the other hand, LD was significantly higher only in 
blacks and in patients with PM. Higher serum LD in blacks 
compared to Caucasians is consistent with the observation 
that enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic (CK) and 
glycolytic (e.g., LD) metabolic pathways have significantly 
higher activities (by 30-40%) in skeletal muscle biopsy 
tissue of Africans compared to Caucasians [15]. 
 Although all subgroup medians fell within the respective 
normal reference intervals, there were several statistically 
significant differences for WBC count, percent lymphocytes, 
and ESR (Fig. 3). WBCs were higher in males than females 
and in Caucasians than blacks, while lymphocytes were 
lower in males than females and tended to decrease with age. 
This conflicts with data in other populations describing 
higher WBC counts in women [16]. ESR levels were higher 
in females compared to males and in blacks compared to 
Caucasians, as previously reported for healthy populations 
[17]. 
 The median values were within the respective reference 
intervals for serum albumin and hematocrit, but they were at 
the low end of the reference interval for serum creatinine, 
consistent with the expected loss of muscle mass in myositis 
patients. On the other hand, serum albumin levels were 
significantly higher in Caucasians than blacks and 
significantly lower in PM compared to DM patients. Similar 
to a healthy population, serum creatinine levels were

significantly higher in men than women with IIM, likely due 
to the larger muscle mass in men. Creatinine levels were 
higher in those older than 50 years, possibly due to declining 
renal function. The hematocrit was significantly higher in 
males compared to females with IIM, as described in healthy 
populations [18]. 
 In order to assess the relative contribution of diagnosis, 
age, gender and race to the differences in certain laboratory 
measures, we compared P-values based on the log values of 
laboratory measures. These analyses showed that CK and 
aldolase were most different among the diagnostic groups (P 
= 1.2 X 10-17 and P = 5.3 X 10-9, respectively). Nonetheless, 
CK and aldolase also differed among races (P = 4.1 X 10-9
and P = 0.0086, respectively), and by gender (P = 0.002 and 
P = 0.005, respectively), but both of these were less 
significant than the differences among diagnostic groups. 
Hematocrit differed most between males and females (P = 
8.4 X 10-13), but less so among races (P = 0.00008), age 
groups (P = 0.001) and diagnostic groups (P = 0.035). 
 The parametric multiway ANOVA analyses, always 
taking into account the factors of gender, race, age and 
diagnosis, confirmed all of the statistically significant 
univariable results, with confirmatory P-values <0.05, except 
in the following 3 cases where the multivariable P-value did

not reach significance: (1) the effect of age on lymphocytes 
(P = 0.082); (2) the effect of gender on WBCs (P = 0.088); 
and (3) the effect of gender on lymphocytes (P = 0.061) were 
not significant. The number and magnitude of these changes 
in P-values are quite minor, and serve to strongly confirm 
the primary univariable results. 
 Correlations among laboratory test results. A number 
of significant correlations among the laboratory tests studied 
were identified in the IIM (see Table 2 where only 
correlations greater than 0.5 in absolute value are shown). 
Moderate to high correlations were observed among

correlated highly, as expected. Aldolase correlated 
significantly with 14 of the other laboratory tests and

test result may be considered to be outside the expected

for liver disease may be warranted. Although only limited 
data were available in this retrospective study, the medical 
records of the 17 individuals who had ALT, AST or LD 
levels higher than the 99% prediction interval were 
examined to assess the possibility of liver disease. Of these 
17 individuals, four had documented liver disease (one each

DISCUSSION 
 This study assessed routine laboratory test results in a 
comparatively large referral population of the IIM at various 
stages of illness to identify possible associations with disease 
not previously noted, to determine if laboratory test values 
vary among gender, racial, age and clinical groups, and to 
define possible correlations among these tests. 
 It is commonly accepted that CK, aldolase, ALT, AST, 
and LD are muscle-derived enzymes in myositis whose 
levels tend to indicate disease activity [3, 19]. Thus, not 
surprisingly, patients with PM, who typically have more 
severe muscle disease, were found to have higher levels of 
these enzymes than DM patients [1]. Another possible 
explanation, however, is that patients with DM more 
frequently have circulating inhibitors or autoantibodies to 
CK or to other enzymes and these autoantibodies may result 
in lower serum enzyme levels [19, 20]. 
 In terms of the sex differences, males have higher 
elevations in enzymes (including CK, CK-MB, CK-MM, 
aldolase and transaminases) compared to females reflecting 
their greater average muscle mass [21]. The reasons for the 
lower immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte counts in men 
than in women and higher WBCs in men remain unclear. In 
the general population, men have higher hematocrit levels 
and lower ESR levels compared to women [22]. 
Leukocytosis has been associated with low-grade fever at the 
onset of myositis and in association with disease flares in 
certain groups [8]. Different tests were also found to vary 
with respect to race. It had been known that CK levels tend 
to be higher in blacks than Caucasians, likely as a result of 
greater muscle mass in the former [13, 23]. 
 Regarding the previously unreported abnormalities, 
although gender was an important determinant of hematocrit, 
we found that hematocrit is lower in DM than PM. Because 
PM tends to present with more severe disease activity than 
DM [1], a lower hematocrit as a result of the anemia of 
chronic disease might have been expected more often in PM 
patients. Perhaps because DM has more vasculopathy than 
PM [1], there might be less capacity to produce red blood 
cells or more gastrointestinal or other bleeding in DM. The 
more frequent vasculopathy seen in DM compared to PM 
[1], with resultant capillary leak in damaged capillaries in 
muscle and other target organs or abnormal gastrointestinal 
absorption, may be the etiology of lower serum albumin, 
which is a negative acute-phase protein, in patients with DM 
than in PM. Hematocrits were also higher in Caucasians 
compared to blacks, in patients >50 years of age, and in PM. 
Higher hematocrits were reported in healthy populations of 
Caucasians compared to blacks in both gender groups, but 
the same study failed to reveal a major age effect [18]. 
 We also noted significant correlations among various 
laboratory findings in the IIM. Moderate to high correlations 
were observed among aldolase and ALT, AST, CK, LD, 
myoglobin, Polys, and WBC. Thus, muscle enzymes and 
muscle breakdown products all correlated highly, as 

Laboratory Evaluation of PM/DM The Open Rheumatology Journal, 2012, Volume 6 61
expected. Muscle enzyme levels may be increased in patients 
with active disease not only due to skeletal muscle 
inflammation, but also due to release of these enzymes into 
the peripheral blood by regenerating myoblasts. CK-MB, 
aldolase, LD and other enzymes are known to be produced 
by myoblasts [24-27]. 
 The significant but low correlations of WBC and Polys 
with muscle enzyme levels and muscle metabolites such as 
myoglobin were unexpected. However, CK is expressed in 
WBC, including macrophages [28, 29], as well as in 
endothelial cells [30], and LD is also expressed by T and B 
lymphocytes [31]. Thus, while CK and LD may be increased 
due to active myositis and may correlate on that basis, there 
may also be several tissue sources outside the muscle for 
these enzymes, providing additional rationale for their 
correlation with WBC and other tests. 
 Although attempts were made to avoid possible 
confounding in all aspects of the study, there are limitations 
to the approaches used in this retrospective investigation. 
First, the data may not be reflective of a typical IIM 
population as subjects referred to the NIH may have more 
severe disease or were taking more medications that could 
have influenced the laboratory results. Second, missing data 
were inevitable in this retrospective approach, although 
adequate numbers existed for nearly all of the studies to 
allow for an appropriately powered analysis. Additionally, 
possible factors that could have also impacted the laboratory 
findings that could not be directly investigated in this 
retrospective study included: variations in clinical disease 
activity; the degree of muscle damage; disease duration; 
myositis autoantibodies; concomitant illnesses; lung or 
cardiac or other organ system involvement related to 
myositis; and medications or other treatment regimens. All 
of these important factors should be included in future 
prospective investigations in this area. 
 Nonetheless, this is the first study undertaken to describe 
the range of common laboratory findings from a 
comparatively large sample of myositis patients, in various 
myositis phenotypes, and involving a large number of 
variables. The results also serve as the foundation for future 
research in developing guidance to clinicians in diagnosing

myositis via laboratory tests. The close correlation of some 
of these tests, particularly CK levels and transaminases, 
lactate dehydrogenase and aldolase, allow for assessment of 
the expected ranges of abnormalities and better guidance as 
to when additional evaluation for possible liver or other 
disease is indicated. 
CONCLUSION 
 This study highlights the importance of understanding the 
range of expected routine laboratory test abnormalities in 
myositis patients and the differences among subgroups in 
order to effectively evaluate possible other causes of these 
abnormalities. Knowledge of the expected range of 
abnormalities of common laboratory tests may aid in 
avoiding unnecessary expensive and invasive diagnostic 
techniques in myositis patients.
