Abstract
The pathophysiological background of decompensated 
cirrhosis is characterised by a systemic proinflammatory 
and pro-oxidant milieu that plays a major role in 
the development of multiorgan dysfunction. Such 
abnormality is mainly due to the systemic spread 
of bacteria and/or bacterial products from the gut 
and danger-associated molecular patterns from the 
diseased liver triggering the release of proinflammatory 
mediators by activating immune cells. The exacerbation 
of these processes underlies the development of 
acute-on-chronic liver failure. A further mechanism 
promoting multiorgan dysfunction and failure likely 
consists with a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
dysfunction responsible for systemic cellular energy 
crisis. The systemic proinflammatory and pro-oxidant 
state of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is also 
responsible for structural and functional changes in the 
albumin molecule, which spoil its pleiotropic non-oncotic 
properties such as antioxidant, scavenging, immunemodulating and endothelium protective functions. 
The knowledge of these abnormalities provides novel 
targets for mechanistic treatments. In this respect, the 
oncotic and non-oncotic properties of albumin make it 
a potential multitarget agent. This would expand the 
well-established indications to the use of albumin in 
decompensated cirrhosis, which mainly aim at improving 
effective volaemia or preventing its deterioration. 
Evidence has been recently provided that long-term 
albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and 
ascites improves survival, prevents complications, 
eases the management of ascites and reduces 
hospitalisations. However, variant results indicate that 
further investigations are needed, aiming at confirming 
the beneficial effects of albumin, clarifying its optimal 
dosage and administration schedule and identify patients 
who would benefit most from long-term albumin 
administration.
Introduction
The concept of compensated and decompensated 
cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is characterised by a prolonged asymptomatic period of persistent liver inflammation, 
extracellular matrix remodelling and relentless 
deposition of collagen in the liver tissue. This 
fibrosis together with focal hyperplasia and proliferation of hepatocytes eventually disrupts the hepatic 
architecture leading to characteristic regenerative 
nodules.1
 During this period, the disease remains 
undiagnosed unless patients seek medical attention for another reason or are screened for liver 
disease because of risk factors.2
 Besides the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, complications 
develop when the disruption of the liver architecture is severe enough to markedly increase portal 
pressure.3
 The most common clinical presentation 
is ascites/oedema or, less frequently, bleeding from 
gastro-oesophageal varices. Late complications 
include jaundice, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial infections and acute kidney 
injury, particularly hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).4 5
Complications, after their first appearance, recur 
with increasing frequency and most patients die 
over a median period of about 2 years unless 
liver transplantation is performed.6
 The disease 
stage preceding the occurrence of complications is 
known as compensated cirrhosis, as opposed to the 
Key messages
Advances in the pathophysiology of 
decompensated cirrhosis
► Many complications of cirrhosis, such as renal 
dysfunction and ascites formation, have long 
been attributed to effective hypovolaemia due 
to peripheral arterial vasodilation.
► It is now clear that decompensated cirrhosis is 
characterised by a systemic proinflammatory 
and pro-oxidant milieu playing a major role in 
the pathogenesis of multiorgan dysfunction.
► The systemic spread of bacteria and/or bacterial 
products secondary to abnormal translocation 
from the gut and danger-associated molecular 
patterns from the diseased liver trigger the 
release of proinflammatory mediators by 
activating immune cells.
► The abrupt exacerbation of these abnormalities 
leads to the development of acute-on-chronic 
liver failure (ACLF), characterised by hepatic 
and extrahepatic organs/systems failure and 
high short-term mortality but with potential for 
reversibility.
► Systemic cellular energy crisis secondary to 
mitochondrial dysfunction likely contributes to 
multiorgan failure in this syndrome.
► The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying 
the clinical manifestations of decompensated 
cirrhosis and ACLF represent novel targets for 
mechanistic treatments.

Key messages
Potential role of albumin as disease-modifying agent in 
decompensated cirrhosis
► The well-established indications to the acute or short-term 
use of albumin in decompensated cirrhosis mainly aim at 
improving effective volaemia or preventing its deterioration.
► Serum albumin in decompensated cirrhosis undergoes 
structural and functional abnormalities endangering its nononcotic properties such as antioxidant, scavenging, immunemodulating and endothelium protective functions. As a result, 
due to both quantitative (hypoalbuminaemia) and qualitative 
changes, the amount of circulating ‘effective’ albumin can be 
dramatically reduced.
► The pleiotropic non-oncotic properties of albumin make it a 
potential multitarget agent for a mechanistic treatment of 
decompensated cirrhosis.
► It has recently provided evidence that long-term albumin 
administration to patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
improves survival, prevents complications, eases the 
management of ascites and reduces hospitalisations, thus 
being cost-effective.

are needed, aiming at confirming the beneficial effects of

decompensated stage during which patients develop complications. In addition to the array of complications related to portal 
hypertension, complexity of cirrhosis is amplified by the development of an acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a 
clinical syndrome characterised by rapid onset of failure of the 
liver and/or extrahepatic organs, including kidneys, systemic 
circulation or brain, within the context of an acute decompensation (AD) of the disease as defined by the development 
of ascites, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or 
bacterial infection.7
 ACLF often occurs in patients with prior 
history of decompensated cirrhosis but also develops without of 
previous decompensation. It is associated with high short-term 
(1month) mortality rate, being the most frequent cause of death 
of cirrhosis.8
The peripheral arterial vasodilation concept: the initial 
rationale for the use of albumin in cirrhosis
A major pathogenic event in the development of complications 
of cirrhosis is an impairment of circulatory function related to 
portal hypertension.9
 The dysfunction in the arterial circulation consists of a reduction in systemic vascular resistance due 
to primary vasodilation of the splanchnic arterial circulation 
(figure 1). This vasodilation is most likely due to an enhanced 
production/activity of vasodilator factors, particularly nitric 
oxide, endogenous cannabinoids and/or carbon monoxide, 
likely related to bacterial translocation mediated through portal 
hypertension, as well as dysfunctional contractile pathways.10–12
In decompensated cirrhosis, arterial pressure must be maintained by an increased activity of the systemic vasoconstrictor 
factors, namely the renin-aldosterone and the sympathetic 
nervous systems, and the non-osmotic secretion of antidiuretic 
hormone.9
 At this stage, cardiac output may also be impaired 
owing to the impairment in cardiac function related to cirrhotic 
cardiomyopathy.13
Understanding circulatory abnormalities in cirrhosis led 
to development of several therapeutic strategies, which are 
currently used in clinical practice, to improve/prevent kidney 
complications, including blockade of sodium retaining factors 
and/or treatment with vasoconstrictor drugs.14–16 Some of these 
strategies include the intravenous administration of albumin 
with the objective of improving arterial underfilling. Currently, 
accepted indications of albumin include prevention of circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, prevention of HRS in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
(SBP), and management of HRS in association with vasoconstrictor drugs.17
On this background, the current article reviews the new 
concepts on pathogenesis of cirrhosis progression, in particular 
the role of systemic inflammation in the development of complications of cirrhosis and ACLF, and the potential role of albumin 
to prevent disease progression and reduce the inflammatory 
status.
Pat hophysiology of AD and ACLF
The clinical course of decompensated cirrhosis is characterised 
by repeated episodes of AD, which may (30% of cases) or may 
not be associated with organ failure(s) (ACLF or ‘mere’ AD, 
respectively).18
Systemic inflammation
Systemic inflammation progressively increases with the progression of cirrhosis, arising in the compensated stage and becoming 
more marked in stable decompensated cirrhosis.19–21 Systemic 
inflammation further increased when an episode of AD develops 
and culminates with ACLF. In fact, patients with AD show more 
evident features of systemic inflammation (plasma levels of C 
reactive protein (CRP); soluble inflammatory signals (proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines)) 
and oxidative stress (irreversibly oxidised form of albumin and 
human non-mercaptalbumin 2 (HNA2)) compared with healthy 
subjects and stable cirrhotics (table 1).18 22 23 In turn, patients 
with ACLF show much higher blood levels of CRP, inflammatory 
molecules and HNA2 than those with AD.18 23 Moreover, while 
patients with AD have a peripheral blood white cell count within 
the normal range, those with ACLF exhibited leucocytosis. 
Together, these findings indicate that ACLF is characterised by 
full-blown systemic inflammation.18 Systemic inflammation in 
AD of cirrhosis and ACLF may overlap systemic changes occurring in sepsis; however, complications and outcome of patients 
with cirrhosis are very distinct from that of patients with sepsis 
without cirrhosis due to the presence of portal hypertension and 
liver failure, which are a hallmark of the liver disease.24
Little is known about the inducer(s) of systemic inflammation in AD.25 Bacterial infections are involved in 33% of cases 
of ACLF,18 even though the true prevalence is likely underestimated. Recent findings from the Predicting Acute-on-Chronic 
Liver Failure in Cirrhosis (PREDICT) study indicate that ACLF 
occurred in two distinct contexts: in one, ACLF was associated 
with bacterial infection, even if the reason for hospitalisation 
was severe alcoholic hepatitis or gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
while in the second, ACLF developed without any clear trigger 
such as infection, trauma, burns, pancreatitis or hypovolaemic 
shock (Trebicka J. Predicting acute-on-chronic liver failure 
in cirrhosis (PREDICT) study. 2019). In sepsis-related ACLF, 
the systemic inflammation already present in decompensated 
cirrhosis is likely accentuated by infective, live bacteria, while 
acute bursts of translocation of bacterial products (but not

Figure 1 Peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis. In patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, a peripheral arterial vasodilation, mainly 
occurring in the splanchnic circulatory area, endangers effective volaemia.9
 Qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal microbiota 
and impairment in intestinal mucosal barrier, translocation of bacteria or bacterial products, and local inflammation and release of inflammatory 
vasoactive mediators is likely the initial sequence of events leading to splanchnic arterial vasodilation in cirrhosis. With the progression of the disease, 
bacterial translocation increases, inflammation become systemic and effective hypovolaemia worsens. Activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis, widespread release of norepinephrine (NE) in the sympathetic nervous system terminals, increased adrenal secretion of epinephrine 
(E), activation of the renin–aldosterone system and increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) are the main homeostatic responses to restore 
arterial pressure, leading to renal fluid retention, which accumulates as ascites, dilutional hyponatraemia and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) as 
the most relevant consequences. The well-established indications for the use of albumin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis rely on this 
pathophysiological background and mainly aim at restoring effective volaemia. No, CO, H2

viable bacteria) from the gut to the bloodstream, a phenomenon related to systemic inflammation, are likely involved in 
ACLF without identifiable triggers.26 27 This interpretation was 
recently supported from a 3months longitudinal investigation 
showing transient peaks of serum interleukin (IL)-6 in patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis.28 Another factor driving the 
onset of accentuated systemic inflammation is the severity and 
type of hepatocyte cell death induced by both infection and liverdirected precipitating events such as alcoholic hepatitis, superimposed viral infections such as hepatitis B or E virus infection 
or drugs. The main form of cell death in AD seems to be apoptosis.29 However, more immunogenic forms such as necroptosis-
(regulated necrosis induced by stimuli including death receptors, 
interferons, toll-like receptors (TLRs), intracellular RNA and 
DNA sensors and mediated by receptor interacting protein 
kinase-3 and its substrate mixed lineage kinase like) and pyroptosis (programmed, non-apoptotic, lytic form of cell death 
occurring as a result of cleavage of the effector protein Gasdermin-D) are observed in ACLF.30–32 This releases proinflammatory 
substances collectively referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Therefore, sepsis-related and sepsisunrelated ACLF would share mechanistic commonalities, that is, 
the immune system response to pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs), either released by infecting bacteria or spread 
from the intestinal lumen, or DAMPs (figure 2).8
 However, it is 
still unclear why, in a given context (eg, SBP), ACLF exhibits a

Figure 2 Working hypothesis for the mechanisms of organ 
failures in ACLF. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS; 
eg, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) are specifically recognised by patternrecognition receptors (PRRs; eg, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 for LPS) 
expressed in innate immune cells and epithelial cells.4 7This process 
is called structural feature recognition. Damage-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMPs; eg, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), S100A8 
(MRP8, calgranulin A) and S100A9 (MRP14, calgranulin B)), are 
molecules resulting from stressed cells that, once released, follow a 
similar path. PAMPs are either released by an infecting alive bacterium 
or ‘translocated’ from the gut lumen to blood, while DAMPs are 
released from tissues where necroptosis and pyroptosis take place (liver 
and extrahepatic organs (not shown)). Whichever the origin of these 
molecular patterns, their recognition by PRRs results in the production 
of a broad variety of inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines 
and lipids), vasodilators and of reactive oxygen species, particularly in 
phagocytes. Intense systemic inflammation may cause collateral tissue 
damage (a process called immunopathology) and subsequently organ 
failures (hypothesis 1). Extrahepatic tissue damage can result in the 
release of DAMPs, which may perpetuate or accentuate PAMP-initiated 
and DAMP-initiated systemic inflammatory response (not shown).4 7
Systemic inflammation is energetically expensive, and the immune 
tissue can be prioritised for nutrient allocation at the expense of vital 
non-immune tissues. These may adapt to nutrient scarcity by reducing 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and therefore ATP 
production, which would contribute to the development of organ 
failures (hypothesis 2). Of note, the two hypotheses are not mutually 
exclusive. ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure.
stronger inflammatory response than AD. The intensity of the 
inflammatory response to PAMPs and DAMPs may depend on 
genetic host factors; single-nucleotide variants might modulate 
the amount of inflammatory molecules produced by innate 
immune cells or changes in the expression of pattern recognition 
receptors (PRRs) such as TLR.7 33 The quantity of exogenous or 
endogenous ‘invaders’ may also play a role; the higher bacterial 
burden or concentration of PAMPs, DAMPs or PRRs, the more 
intense the inflammatory response.
Immune paralysis and increased risk of bacterial infections
As reported above, AD and particularly ACLF are frequently 
precipitated by bacterial infections. Furthermore, nosocomial 
infections are the most frequent and severe complication of 
ACLF unrelated to bacterial infections at diagnosis, favouring 
progression to the most severe grade.34 The reasons of this high 
risk for bacterial infections is largely unknown.
Although peripheral blood leucocytosis is a hallmark of ACLF 
and a component of prognostic scores for ACLF and AD,35 36 its 
cell subsets are largely undefined and would merit investigation. 
Some studies showed that circulating monocytes in ACLF exhibit 
features of ‘immune paralysis’ in response to PAMPs. Namely, the 
frequency of CD14+ monocytes expressing the tyrosine-protein 
kinase Mer (hereafter called Mer) is increased.37 This protein, 
encoded by MERTK and belonging to TAM receptors family, 
inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-associated, TLR4-mediated, 
induction of inflammatory signals in immune cells. Consistently, 
Mer-expressing monocytes from ACLF patients had a depressed 
inflammatory response to LPS reverted by Mer pharmacological inhibition.37 In another study, the frequency of mononuclear CD14+ CD15-HLA-DR-myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
was increased in ACLF (representing half of CD14+ cells) and 
exhibited immunosuppressive properties. Indeed, T cell proliferation, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 production in response to TLR stimulation and uptake of Escherichia 
coli were reduced.38 A third study showed that monocytes from 
patients with ACLF had elevated frequencies of IL-10-producing 
cells, reduced HLA-DR expression and impaired phagocytic 
and oxidative burst capacity.39 Transcriptomic data revealed 
a profile of alternatively polarised, tolerant monocytes. Interestingly, the pharmacological inhibition of glutamine synthesis 
favouring glutaminolysis improved the monocytes phagocytic 
and inflammatory.39 Similarly, neutrophils from patients with 
ACLF present severe defects of phagocytosis and ability to kill 
ingested bacteria despite marked activation. Due to the importance of neutrophils in bacterial clearance, it is not surprising 
that the severity of this dysfunction define the risk of infection and mortality.40 Immune-suppressing signals to monocytes 
may also be involved; for example, decreased serum albumin 
in patients with AD (including ACLF) binds lower amounts of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The resulting increased bioavailability 
of PGE2 dampens the macrophage response to LPS.41 Innate 
immune cells (monocytes and neutrophils) play a major role 
in the host resistance against infection; in response to bacterial cues, monocytes produce a variety of molecules with to 
reduce the bacterial burden.42 Together, these studies show that 
ACLF is associated with increased frequency of certain subsets

of neutrophils and immune-suppressed monocytes, which may 
decrease host resistance capacity and increase susceptibility 
to bacterial infection. Notably, immune paralysis features are 
observed in less severely decompensated cirrhosis. Endotoxinaemia and metabolic disturbances (eg, hyperammonaemia 
and hyponatraemia) may contribute to immune paralysis and be 
reversed by albumin administration.43–45
Pathophysiology of end-organ alterations in AD and ACLF: 
immunopathology and cellular energetic crisis
The mechanisms underlying organ dysfunction in AD and organ 
failure(s) in ACLF are poorly understood. There is a close 
correlation between the intensity of systemic inflammation and 
end-organ dysfunction. Patients with AD and mild systemic 
inflammation often develop kidney dysfunction.25 In ACLF, the 
intensity of systemic inflammation is closely associated with the 
number of organ failures (figure 2).18 In the general population, 
cytokines released in response to bacterial cues in patients with 
sepsis and severe sepsis activate innate immune cells that further 
release cytokines, proteases and reactive oxygen species within 
vital organs. All these effects cause collateral tissue damage, a 
process called immunopathology.46 Similarly, systemic inflammation in AD and ACLF may cause tissue damage via immunopathology resulting in organ dysfunction or failure, respectively 
(hypothesis 1, figure 2).7 8 47 However, to date, no immunopathological studies performed in patients with AD or ACLF 
providing robust support to this hypothesis are available. Still, 
some studies showed that liver-derived systemic inflammatory 
markers are associated with the development of organ failures 
and especially cardiac dysfunction.48 49
In patients or animals with sepsis but without liver disease, 
systemic inflammation is energetically expensive because of the 
production of inflammatory molecules, respiratory burst, acutephase response, cellular migration and proliferation, requiring 
reallocation of nutrients to fuel the inflammatory response.42 50
Because systemic inflammation induces sickness behaviour of 
anorexia and asthaenia, which decrease food intake, mobilisation of stored fuels is critical for mounting the inflammatory response.42 50 This elicits proteolysis (skeletal muscles), 
lipolysis (adipose tissue) and glycogenolysis (liver), releasing 
amino acids, fatty acids and glucose to be used as fuels. This 
metabolic demand can be so high to exceed resources, so that 
nutrients are prioritised to immune tissues. Thus, non-immune 
tissues adapt by decreasing their energetic demand and reducing 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos).50 Results 
of high-throughput metabolomics and lipidomics performed 
in the sera from a large cohort of patients with AD or ACLF 
showed that ACLF was distinct from AD by a blood signature 
witnessing intense proteolysis, and lipolysis, and marked inhibition of mitochondrial OxPhos.51 Although these findings were 
similar to those reported in sepsis in the general population,50
it is relevant that the ACLF-associated blood metabolite signature was unrelated with the presence or absence of detectable 
bacterial infection, indicating that such a signature can be seen 
in both sepsis-related and ‘spontaneous’ ACLF. Moreover, in 
ACLF with single organ failure, the metabolite signature was 
detected whichever the failing organ (liver, brain and kidney), 
indicating that cellular metabolism abnormalities were very 
similar irrespective of the type of organ affected. Because the 
ACLF-associated blood metabolite signature is consistent with 
the existence of mitochondrial inhibition in various organs, this 
mechanism may play a crucial role in the development of organ 
failures (hypothesis 2, figure 2). However, these results require a 
cautious interpretation as, to date, they were reported in a single 
study and were based on the assumption that plasma metabolic 
alterations reflected what happened in tissues. As occurs with 
immunopathology, why a generalised metabolic dysregulation 
would affect different organs in different patients is unknown. It 
is noteworthy that hypothesis 1 (role of immunopathology) and 
hypothesis 2 (role of competition for metabolic resources) are 
similarly plausible and not mutually exclusive.
The concept of albumin as a drug
Biosynthesis and metabolism
Albumin is a globular, water-soluble 67kDa protein, negatively charged at neutral pH due to the abundance of aspartate and glutamate residues in its 609 amino acid sequence 
(figure 3).52 53 Albumin is the most abundant protein in serum 
(3.5–5.0g/dL, which represents approximately half of all serum 
proteins) and in extracellular fluids.52 Albumin is exclusively 
synthesised by hepatocytes, where it is translated from a single 
gene as preproalbumin, imported into the endoplasmic reticulum for cleavage of its N-terminal prepropeptide by a serine 
protease, transported to the Golgi and continuously secreted 
into the bloodstream.54 Serum albumin has a prolonged halflife of approximately 20days.55 Its persistence in the circulation 
derives from its constant uptake and recycling by hepatocytes, 
a process regulated in a pH-dependent manner by the neonatal 
crystallisable fragment receptor (FcRn) (figure 4).56 FcRn binds 
albumin on the surface of hepatocytes and endothelial cells, redirecting albumin into the vascular space and away from bile and 
extracellular space.56 57 Although renal tubular epithelial cells 
also express FcRn, the main contribution to albumin recycling 
and circulating levels steadiness derives from FcRn expression 
by hepatocytes and endothelial cells, since its absence leads to 
hypoalbuminaemia.57
Albumin as plasma expander, pleotropic scavenger, 
antioxidant and immunomodulatory molecule
Albumin accounts for approximately 75% of plasma oncotic 
pressure. A large evidence exists for its use as plasma expander in 
patients with cirrhosis, but recent data also support other indications.28 58 Indeed, albumin exerts several homeostatic functions 
as potent scavenger, antioxidant and immunomodulatory molecule. For example, albumin reversibly binds many molecules, 
permitting solubilisation and transport.58 This occurs principally at sites I/II but may also occur electrostatically through its 
negative charge (figure 3). Therefore, it modulates the activity 
of many drugs and binds a range of metallic ions, toxic metabolites and inflammatory mediators potentially affecting systemic 
inflammation, antioxidant and endothelial function.58 In particular, bilirubin, a toxic insoluble metabolite of haem breakdown, 
is bound and exclusively transported by albumin to hepatocytes 
for conjugation with glucuronic acid and elimination via the 
biliary–intestinal system.59 Moreover, albumin binds bile acids, 
maintaining their plasma concentration within normal levels and 
lower than in the portal circulation.60 In liver cirrhosis, serum bile 
acid concentrations increase to the levels seen in the splanchnic 
circulation.61 In this context, enhanced serum bile acid binding 
by albumin supplementation may decrease their possible adverse 
effects. Importantly, albumin possesses about seven binding sites 
for fatty acids with moderate to high affinity, enhancing the 
concentration of fatty acids in blood by several orders of magnitude.62 Finally, a number of metabolites with well-known effects 
on the immune system, such as those belonging to the tryptophan–kynurenine pathway, mostly circulate bound to albumin.

Figure 3 Endogenous and exogenous binding sites in the albumin molecule. Many of the physiological functions of human serum albumin rely on 
its ability to reversibly bind to an extremely wide range of ligands to increase their solubility in plasma, to transport them to specific tissues or organs 
or to dispose of them when they are toxic. Since ligands are frequently biologically active, albumin also modulates their pathophysiological effects. 
Panel A: molecular structure of human serum albumin with an indication of its subdomains (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA and IIIB), of the N and C termini and 
the main endogenous and exogenous compounds binding sites including the Sudlow’s sites I and II, the site III, the multimetal binding site (site A) 
and the CYS34 site. Panel B: albumin molecule shows seven long-chain fatty acid (FA) binding sites (FA1–FA7). In addition to transporting FAs, these 
sites also transport and inactivate biological active lipids involved in systemic inflammation including prostaglandins and PAMPs (lipopolysaccharide 
and lipoteichoic acid). Panel C: albumin is the most important regulator of extracellular oxidative stress and presents many binding sites for reactive 
oxidative species. The most important binding site is the Cys-34 residue, which can be reversible or irreversible oxidised giving rise to two molecular 
forms of oxidised albumin (HNA1
 and HNA2). Albumin images from: RCSB PDB (rcsb.org) of PDB ID 1E7I.53 PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns.
Therefore, their free serum levels in decompensated cirrhosis 
can be increased due to hypoalbuminaemia, structural changes 
of albumin or binding competition with endogenous and exogenous substances.63
Albumin is also antioxidant and its infusion reduces oxidative stress during the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin 
predominantly circulates in a reduced state with a free thiol 
group in the Cys-34 residue acting as a free radical scavenger 
for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Albumin also restricts 
oxidative stress damage by neutralising free copper and iron.58
Finally, albumin displays immunomodulatory properties. For 
example, albumin modulates innate immune responses to sepsis, 
and cirrhosis-associated PGE2-mediated immune dysfunction 
improved following albumin infusion.41
Effects on cardiocirculatory function and systemic 
inflammation
Albumin is frequently used in clinical practice as plasma 
expander, since its administration increases circulating blood 
volume. Studies performed in the 1980s demonstrated that 
albumin administration prevents paracentesis-induced cardiocirculatory dysfunction, an alteration characterised by a systemic 
haemodynamics impairment leading to effective hypovolaemia.

Figure 5 Effect of long-term albumin treatment on serum albumin concentration and inflammatory cytokines. Albumin was given at high dosage 
(HAlbD: 1.5 g/kg body weight (BW) every week) or low dosage (LAlbD: 1 g/kg BW every 2weeks) during 12 weeks to two groups of patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis. High albumin but not low albumin dosage was associated with normalisation of serum albumin concentration and 
significant decrease in the plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This figure 
was published in gastroenterology, vol 157, Fernández J et al, Effects of albumin treatment on systemic and portal haemodynamics and systemic 
inflammation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, page 149, Copyright Elsevier (2019).28
Figure 4 Albumin recycling by endothelial cells. Endothelial cell 
recycling is the mechanism maintaining high concentrations of healthy 
albumin within the systemic circulation. Albumin is synthesised by 
the liver and rapidly released to the intravascular compartment.52 The 
total amount of albumin in humans is approximately 360 g, 120 g 
being in the intravascular and 240 g in the extravascular compartment. 
intravascular albumin is constantly being exchanged (4%–5%/hour 
through the endothelium with the extravascular pool. In organs having 
sinusoids or capillaries with fenestrated endothelium, albumin can 
pass through the large capillary gaps. In the remaining capillaries 
with continuous endothelium, albumin is transported by an active 
transcytotic mechanism mediated by the gp60 receptor albondin (not 
shown). There is a second group of receptors (gp18 and gp30) expressed 
in many tissues that governs degradation of albumin. These surface cell 
receptors (not drawn in the figure) show 1000-fold higher affinity for 
chemically modified albumin (ie, oxidised albumin). Once internalised, 
this modified albumin is degraded in the lysosomes. Finally, a third 
type of albumin receptor (FcRn) that rescues albumin from lysosomal 
degradation contributes to extend the albumin half-life. The low 
endosomal pH promotes the link of healthy albumin and FcRn in the 
acidified endosome. When the recycling endosome contacts the higher 
plasma pH, healthy albumin is released to the systemic circulation.
Albumin prevents the decrease in cardiac output and the increase 
in plasma renin activity.64 Alternative plasma expanders are less 
effective and, therefore, are not recommended.65
Albumin also prevents renal dysfunction and death in patients 
with SBP.66 Its administration improves effective blood volume 
by attenuating peripheral arterial vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction (plasma von Willebrand factor reduction) and 
enhancing cardiac work, effects not observed with hydroxy-ethyl 
starch.67 Albumin administration also improves effective blood 
volume, thus leading to vasoconstrictor systems deactivation, 
and increases arterial pressure in patients with HRS treated with 
terlipressin, effects not observed with terlipressin alone.68 Experimental studies have also shown that albumin improves cardiac 
inotropism in cirrhotic rats with ascites independent of volume 
expansion and related to the reversal of the negative effects of 
TNF-α and oxidative stress on cardiac contractility.69
Albumin also attenuates systemic inflammation. Its administration (1.5g/kg/week) for 12 weeks improved markers of 
systemic inflammation (IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (G-CSF), IL-1ra and vascular endothelial growth factor) 
in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, an effect confirmed in 
a short-term investigation in patients with bacterial infections 
(figure 5).28 Notably, recent in vitro studies attribute the endothelial effects and anti-inflammatory properties of albumin to its 
uptake by endothelial and immune cells.70 The effect of albumin 
on endothelial cells is mediated through its antioxidant properties, while its ability to block endosomal TLR signalling acts in 
the immune cells (Clària J. The immunomodulation effects of 
albumin. 2019).
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of albumin: 
towards a personalised use of treatment in cirrhosis
The pharmacokinetics of infused albumin are principally determined by blood volume, serum albumin concentration and 
amount infused. In healthy volunteers, 50% of a 25g dose of 
albumin was lost from the vascular bed 240min after infusion 
compared with 65% of 50g. Conversely, after a rapid withdrawal of 900mL of blood followed by albumin infusion, 80% 
of a 50g dose and 65% of 100g remained at 240min. Hypovolaemia and hypoproteinaemia, similar to decompensated 
cirrhosis, produced a third set of results: after 25 or 50g albumin 
infusion, 40% remained in the vascular bed at 240min.71
The structural integrity of the albumin molecule is essential for its biological functions. Unfortunately, such a structure

is quite vulnerable to damaging toxins in a proinflammatory 
and pro-oxidant circulatory microenvironment, as occurs in 
decompensated cirrhosis.22 Oxidative damage of the Cys-34 
residue, the most common alteration, correlates to severity of 
cirrhosis and extent of systemic inflammation.22 72 73 Even more 
important, it independently predicts mortality up to 1year of 
follow-up.22 72 73 Besides the Cys-34 residue, post-transcriptional 
damage can simultaneously involve several other molecular 
sites (ie, truncation of the N-terminal and C-terminal portions, 
glycosylation and dimerisation).73 74 With the accumulation of 
damage in the total albumin pool, the portion maintaining a 
fully preserved structure (the so-called reduced native albumin) 
decreases in parallel.72 Moreover, oxidised forms of albumin 
enhance proinflammatory cytokine synthesis by peripheral 
human leucocytes, providing a rationale for replacement with 
reduced native albumin to limit systemic inflammation in 
cirrhosis.75 In parallel, impairment of albumin functions, such as 
binding and detoxification capacity, antioxidant function and the 
ability to chelate metal ions, develops and progresses in patients 
with increasing severity of cirrhosis.76
The assumption that the global function of albumin is related 
to its circulating amount and to its structural integrity leads 
to the concept that the ‘effective albumin concentration’. The 
proportion of albumin maintaining fully preserved structure and 
function is much lower than the serum albumin concentration 
routinely measured in clinical practice. Indeed, effective albumin 
concentration in decompensated cirrhosis was independently 
associated with disease severity and albumin function.77 Moreover, it was a better predictor of ACLF and short-term mortality 
than total serum albumin concentration.77 Based on these observations, future research on albumin should determine whether 
increasing effective albumin concentration represents a clinically 
relevant target of therapy and identify novel biomarkers of effective albumin concentration to be used in clinical practice.
First studies on the long-term administration of 
albumin in cirrhosis
A therapeutic strategy able to modify the natural history of the 
disease by preventing the development of complications, thus 
improving survival, quality of life and healthcare costs is still an 
unmet need in the management of patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis.17 In this perspective, after the long-term use of albumin 
was shown to be associated with a better control of ascites in two 
pivotal studies,78 79 and in parallel with the advancement in our 
knowledge of the relevance of albumin non-oncotic properties 
in the treatment of decompensated cirrhosis, two randomised 
clinical trials and one observational study recently evaluated the 
effects of long-term albumin administration in this setting.80–82
Such a therapeutic approach attempts to interrupt the pathophysiological cascade responsible for the clinical manifestations 
of decompensated cirrhosis through a mechanistic treatment. In 
the complex network of many interacting and redundant pathophysiological pathways that underlie decompensated cirrhosis,83
long-term use of albumin could antagonise several mechanisms, 
including systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.
In the human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients 
With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) study, a non-profit, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial, 431 patients with noncomplicated but persisting ascites despite diuretic administration 
were randomised to receive either standard medical treatment 
(SMT) or SMT plus albumin (40g twice a week for 2weeks and 
then 40g/week) for 18 months.80 A significantly better 18-month 
overall survival was seen in patients receiving albumin (77%) 
with respect to those receiving SMT (66%), corresponding to a 
38% reduction in the HR for mortality. The multivariable risk 
analysis for all-cause mortality considering transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and liver transplantation as 
competing events showed that albumin treatment was the sole 
protective variable. Long-term albumin use also improved the 
management of ascites, as the need of paracentesis and the incidence of refractory ascites declined by about 50%. Furthermore, 
the cumulative incidence of complications of cirrhosis, including 
SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, 
as defined by serum creatinine above 1.5mg/dL, HRS 1 and 
severe hepatic encephalopathy grade III or IV, as well as potential 
diuretic-induced side effects, such as hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, were reduced by 27%–70% in the albumin group. As a 
result, patients enrolled in the albumin arm had significantly less 
liver-related hospitalisations or days spent in hospital, so that the 
long-term albumin use proved to be also cost-effective. The core 
results of the ANSWER trial were confirmed by a prospective, 
non-randomised study that enrolled 70 patients with cirrhosis 
and refractory ascites.82 Patients who received SMT+albumin 
(20g twice weekly) had a significantly lower 24-month mortality 
than those receiving SMT. Treatment with albumin was the sole 
independent protective factor against death and was associated 
to a lower cumulative incidence of rehospitalisations due to any 
complication of cirrhosis with the exception of GI bleeding.
However, a placebo-controlled clinical trial (Midodrine and 
Albumin for CirrHotic patients in the waiting list for liver 
Transplantation (MACHT) study), which enrolled patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, challenged these results.81 In this study, 173 patients with ascites 
were randomised to receive either SMT plus albumin (40g/15 
days) and the α1
-receptor agonist midodrine (15–30mg/day 
according to pressor response) or SMT plus placebos. Treatment with midodrine and albumin was associated with a slight 
but significant suppression of plasma renin activity and plasma 
norepinephrine. However, neither arterial pressure nor plasma 
cytokine levels changed significantly. Finally, there were no 
significant differences between the two groups in the probability 
of developing complications of cirrhosis during follow-up or 
1-year mortality.
The comparison of the characteristics of these studies can 
provide some relevant topics in order to interpret their contradictory results (table 2). The most striking difference is related 
with the amount of albumin administered, being about half in the 
MACHT trial compared with the two other studies. Moreover, 
a loading dose was only used in the ANSWER study. This was 
the likely reason for a significant and sustained increase of serum 
albumin (0.6–0.8g/dL to a median value close to 4g/dL) seen in 
the ANSWER study, while no changes occurred in the MACHT 
study. The dose of albumin and its effect on serum albumin 
level are likely to be crucial for the full development of all the 
biological properties of the molecule. In fact, a recent real-world 
implementation study confirmed the results of the ANSWER 
study showing that improvements in effective volaemia and 
systemic inflammation in patients with stable decompensated 
cirrhosis were only achieved with a high dose of albumin (1.5g/
kg of body weight (BW)/week vs 1.0g/kg BW every 2weeks).28
On the basis of these findings, it is likely that the positive results 
of the ANSWER study could be even improved using higher 
albumin therapeutic schedules or adjusting albumin dosage to 
therapeutic response. In this respect, preliminary results from 
a post hoc analysis of the ANSWER database showed that the 
level of serum albumin level reached after 1month of treatment 
predicts the probability of 17-month overall survival, which was

greater than 90% in those patients presenting a level greater than 
4g/dL.77 Thus, a relevant lesson from the most recent studies is 
that the serum albumin concentration should be used as guide 
for monitoring albumin dosage during long-term albumin treatment in cirrhosis.
Future perspectives
The past 20 years have seen a huge change in our understanding, both of the biology of cirrhosis, its complications 
and also of albumin biology.84 The central feature, hitherto 
unrecognised is that cirrhosis is a state of systemic inflammation, which is heightened in patients with complications 
and in particular in those with ACLF.18 The above sections 
clearly highlight the importance of albumin therapy in patients 
with liver disease, which acts to correct both the circulatory 
dysfunction and also modulates inflammation. In addition 
to the use of albumin to prevent postparacentesis circulatory 
dysfunction,85 treat SBP66 and HRS,68 the recent suggestion 
that long-term outpatients albumin therapy may improve
their survival provides the impetus to develop a personalised 
approach to albumin replacement, optimise the albumin solution that is being administered, better understand albumin 
biology and await results of ongoing clinical trials.
Personalised approach to albumin therapy: the concept of 
‘effective albumin concentration’
At present, the target for albumin therapy is not clearly defined. 
The data from the two long-term infusion studies have shown
different results partly explained by the amount of albumin 
that was administered. In the ANSWER study,80 40 g twice
weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly of 20% albumin was
administered for up to 18 months whereas in the Barcelona 
study,81 40 g albumin was administered every 15 days for a
median follow-up of 80 days. In the former case, a significant reduction in mortality was observed, but in the latter, 
no differences in survival was found. One could interpret the 
data as suggesting that the amount of albumin administered 
matters. An alternative hypothesis may be that the lack of 
survival benefit in the Barcelona study is related to the inclusion of sicker patients. It is well known that these patients have 
worse albumin function in all its domains, bringing into discussion about the concept of ‘effective albumin concentration’,86
which is based on measurement of function rather than just 
the concentration.76 84 All the three main functional domains, 
that is, the metal binding domain, the Cysteine-34 domain and 
the binding sites are now possible to be assessed easily using 
a cobalt binding assay, high-performance chromatography or
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively.70
It should therefore be possible to generate models whereby the 
‘effective albumin concentration’ can be targeted rather than 
trying to achieve a given concentration. This sort of approach 
is likely to improve the efficacy and also significantly reduce 
the cost of albumin infusions.
Improving the quality of the commercially available human 
serum albumin
As albumin becomes more widely used as a therapeutic rather 
than just fluid, it is important to think how to improve the 
quality of the infused albumin. The process of production, maintaining stability and functionality of the commercially available 
albumin, has remained largely unchanged for many decades. 
For example, the albumin that is infused into patients contains 
caproylate and tryptophan, which have been suggested to have 
deleterious effects. In fact, a device has been developed to specifically remove these stabilisers (Albutec, Rostock, Germany). 
More significant is the observation suggesting that the commercially available albumins contains only about 50% albumin in 
the reduced, functionally active, mercaptalbumin form.87 Nearly 
40% is present as HNA1.87 Not only is this form non-functional, 
but it may have deleterious consequences as it can activate 
inflammatory cells.75 New research is urgently needed to find 
ways to improve the quality of albumin used in clinical practice, 
which will reduce costs and may implicate on further improving 
the efficacy of the infused albumin.
Further understanding of the mechanisms of 
hypoalbuminaemia in cirrhosis, pathophysiological basis of 
structural modifications and mechanisms of its pleiotropic 
effects
In patients with cirrhosis and particularly in those with superimposed inflammation, albumin levels can decline rapidly. Better 
ability to measure albumin turnover and define exact mechanisms of hypoalbuminaemia may allow alternative approaches to 
increasing albumin concentrations. The exciting observation that 
albumin acts intracellularly both in the immune and endothelial 
cells is extremely interesting.70 75 Many aspects need clarification 
about the ultimate mechanism within the cell it targets, its fate, 
the mechanism by which it enters the cell and how this influences its pleiotropic actions.
Further clinical trials of albumin therapy in the acute and 
chronic situations
The better understanding of albumin biology and the contradictory results of the ANSWER and MACHT studies provides the 
rationale and the urgent need to perform further trials of longterm albumin. They should better define its potential role in

clinical practice identifying patients who can benefit most from 
treatment and determining the criteria for selecting dose and 
frequency of albumin administration as well as for its discontinuation. The International PRECIOSA study has started to enrol 
and will provide the answer to this question (NCT03451292). 
The ATTIRE study, which explores the role of high dose albumin 
administration in patients with AD is being performed in the UK 
and has finished enrolling, randomising about 800 patients.88
The results are eagerly awaited.
Further clinical studies attempting to address albumin 
biology are using albumin in extracorporeal liver assist devices 
for patients with ACLF. The molecular adsorbent recirculating 
system (MARS) and Prometheus provided proof of concept 
that such a strategy could be successful but were not found to 
improve survival,89–91 but MARS reduced severity of hepatic 
encephalopathy. A novel device, DIALIVE, aims to remove and 
replace the damaged albumin while also removing DAMPs and 
PAMPs.92 A multicentre, randomised, controlled trial to assess 
safety and performance of DIALIVE in patients with ACLF 
versus standard of care is currently ongoing (NCT03065699). 
As an extension of the concept targeting replacement of the 
damaged albumin and removing DAMPs and PAMPs, a large 
phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group,
open-label study of plasma exchange using albumin 5% in ACLF 
patients has also recently been launched (NCT03702920). 
These clinical studies will provide further robust evidence for 
albumin therapy in patients with cirrhosis.
