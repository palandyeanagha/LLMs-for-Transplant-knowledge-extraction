Definition and Classification of Fatty
Liver Disease
If one examines the introductory text from almost any article
written about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), one is almost certain to
find a phrase that describes NAFLD as both “identical to
alcoholic liver disease” and “a spectrum of changes from
steatosis to NASH to cirrhosis.” Although there is some truth
to these phrases, both are problematic. Although there may
be significant overlap with features of alcoholic liver disease,
there are also distinctions between the two.1 Second, the
concept of the spectrum oversimplifies a complex disease,
and implies that there is a continuous and unbroken movement from steatosis on one end to cirrhosis on the other.
Further, it suggests a disease categorization that is onedimensional and limited to a few disease states. The natural
history of NAFLD on an individual patient level is largely
unknown and it is not clear that all patients with steatosis are
at risk for steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis. Patients with
steatohepatitis may cycle in and out of states in which that
diagnosis can be recognized histologically, depending on
therapeutic interventions and/or lifestyle modifications.
There may be more than one path to cirrhosis depending
on a variety of factors including the age of the patient. Disease
classification in NAFLD must be robust enough to account for
these possibilities.
In addition to these disease classification and natural
history issues, NAFLD itself is a histologically complex disease. Unlike chronic hepatitis, which can be adequately
graded and staged by characterizing the inflammation and
the fibrosis, the histologic characterization of NAFLD and

Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) results in histologically complex specific and
nonspecific injury patterns. In clinical research of NAFLD, the liver biopsy evaluation
provides a wealth of information on the architectural arrangement and severity of a
variety of histologic changes, including steatosis, inflammation, cellular injury, and
fibrosis. This information is summarized as an overall diagnostic category, such steatosis
or steatohepatitis and the severity of the injury can be graded and staged. Histopathologic disease classification in NAFLD is related to but separate from evaluation of
individual histologic lesions. The patient population under study may affect the
prevalence of histologic findings and in particular, pediatric patients with NAFLD may
show a higher prevalence of zone 1 steatosis and periportal fibrosis as compared with
adult populations. For the purposes of clinical research, it is important to provide the
pathologist with biopsies that are adequate to classify the disease process as well as to
grade and stage the changes. A current understanding of NAFLD pathologic classification, as well as nuances of grading and staging, is presented in this review.

NASH by definition includes description of steatosis and cell
injury in addition to inflammation and fibrosis. These histologic features are not specific by themselves and may be found
as components in other liver diseases. When they combine in
specific patterns, we can recognize specific disease states
such as steatohepatitis, even in conjunction with other diseases. At times, however, the pathologist may be limited to
describing the degree of necroinflammatory injury and carefully cataloguing the changes seen. We propose that, for the
purposes of clinical investigation, pathologists and clinicians
categorize the histologic changes from biopsies done to
evaluate NAFLD into sets of diagnoses as outlined
in ►Tables 1 and 2 and described in detail below. Because
many of the individual histologic features of NAFLD may occur
in other liver diseases and there remains no positive serologic
test for NAFLD, there should be adequate clinical exclusion of
other forms of liver diseases prior to categorizing a biopsy as a
type of NAFLD.
No Significant Evidence of Fatty Liver Disease
(Not NAFLD)
When patients with suspected fatty liver disease are biopsied,
one possible outcome is that there is no evidence of fatty liver
disease. This is known to occur in up to 10% of bariatric
biopsies and has been reported in nonmorbidly obese individuals as well.2–4 In addition, it might be the result of
effective therapy or might simply be the patient's true
baseline state. Minimal steatosis might be present and for
the purposes of clinical scientific study, the NASH CRN (Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network) has used
a literature based cutoff of 5% steatosis (meaning that less
than 5% of hepatocytes show steatosis) as the threshold.5,6
Other mild, but nonspecific changes (including minimal
inflammation or fibrosis) could be present without affecting
the categorization. These findings may represent prior injury
and resolution and may warrant a descriptive diagnosis and
comment in the pathology report. Diffuse glycogenosis might
be present and may provide an explanation for imaging
findings. In routine clinical practice in which patients are
screened by current generation imaging techniques prior to
biopsy, this diagnosis should be unusual. In the setting of
clinical research, patients who are at risk for NAFLD, but have
no histologic evidence of disease would make an excellent
control group for understanding the pathophysiology of
steatosis.
Steatosis
It is important to remember that steatosis is not a specific
feature of liver disease, but a histologic finding that can be
identified in various other liver biopsies for elevated liver
tests. In fact, zone 1 steatosis is a common distribution in
chronic hepatitis C. The pathologist should always be alert to
other possibilities, particularly when the clinical evaluation is
incomplete.
Many patients biopsied to evaluate NAFLD will have a
significant degree of steatosis, but will not have evidence of
steatohepatitis. There is macrovesicular steatosis that is
usually present in a zone 3 or panacinar distribution
(►Fig. 1).7 Steatosis in a zone 1 distribution should suggest
the zone 1, borderline pattern. Azonal steatosis is most often
seen in biopsies with advanced fibrosis, but the zonal distribution may also be difficult to discern when the steatosis is
either very mild or the biopsy is fragmented or inadequate.7
Spotty lobular inflammation is often present and can be in the
form of small collections of macrophages (microgranulomas)
or lymphocytes, similar to the spotty inflammation in chronic

Category Definition
No significant evidence of fatty liver
disease (Not NAFLD)
Insufficient steatosis for a diagnosis of steatosis (the NASH CRN uses a
threshold of 5% of hepatocytes showing steatosis), without other
changes (ballooning, fibrosis) that would suggest steatohepatitis.
Steatosis
• Steatosis with inflammation
• Steatosis with nonspecific fibrosis
Steatosis without specific changes to suggest a form of steatohepatitis.
This category may include spotty lobular inflammation and/or mild
degrees of fibrosis of uncertain significance.
Steatohepatitis
• Zone 3 borderline steatohepatitis
Form of steatohepatitis most common in adults; defined as a zone
3 centered injury pattern that includes steatosis, inflammation, ballooning
injury (often with Mallory-Denk bodies) with or without fibrosis. Borderline
steatohepatitis has some, but not all of the features that would allow a
diagnosis of steatohepatitis.
Zone 1, Borderline pattern Form of steatohepatitis that occurs mainly in young children, characterized by
zone 1-centered injury (portal inflammation, portal-based fibrosis, zone
1 steatosis, ballooning injury in zone 1 if present).
Cryptogenic fibrosis/cirrhosis Presence of fibrosis (usually advanced) or cirrhosis, with little to no steatosis
and no changes (ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies) that would suggest
borderline or definite steatohepatitis. Other explanations for fibrosis
(besides steatohepatitis) should be considered.

viral hepatitis. Portal in
flammation is usually mild or absent;
no ballooning injury suggests steatohepatitis. Fibrosis, if
present at all, should be limited to mild periportal or perisinusoidal fibrosis. In the Central Pathology Committee of
the NASH CRN, this category has been used for cases in
which there is clear zone 3 steatosis with or without
periportalfibrosis, but without perisinusoidalfibrosis. In
such cases, the criteria for steatohepatitis are incomplete,
and the temporal relationship of steatosis and thefibrosis is
not known. Because a biopsy withfindings in this category
shows generally nonspecificfindings, a descriptive diagnosis
and comment would be appropriate for the pathologist's
report.
Steatohepatitis
Steatohepatitis, as a name for a unique diagnostic pattern that
had been observed in nonalcoholic, overweight adult patients, was first proposed in a landmark study by the Mayo
Clinic.
8 However, the alcoholic-like pathology of steatohepatitis was described in overweight and/or diabetic patients
long before the study that popularized the term, steatohepatitis (see, e.g., early studies by Zimmerman9,10). Until recently,
it was the only pattern within NAFLD that was recognized to
be associated with the development of advancedfibrosis.
Unlike the steatosis category described above, steatohepatitis

even though a second liver disease may be present. The
presence of a characteristic ballooning injury is the key to
the diagnosis. Ballooning injury is a type of cellular change in
which the cells become enlarged and the cytoplasm becomes
irregularly clumped with optically clear, nonvesiculated
areas. Steatotic vacuoles may be seen in ballooned cells, but
they should not fill the cytoplasm. Early in the disease,
ballooned cells are seen most frequently in zone 3 near the
hepatic veins, but later in the disease or in very severe cases,
they may lose this clear zonal distribution. The most classic
appearing balloon cells will contain Mallory-Denk bodies
(MDBs), which are eosinophilic, ropey cytoplasmic inclusions
often found near the nucleus. MDBs are composed of hyperphosphorylated, misfolded cytokeratin 8 and 18 filaments.11
Normally, such aggregates would be degraded in the proteosome, but in steatohepatitis this process is blocked. MDBs
stain positively using antibodies against ubiquitin and p63,
both proteins involved in degradation pathways, as well as
with antibodies against cytokeratins 8 and 18.12 Using the
latter stain, the remaining cytoplasm in the cell will be
negative, whereas nonballooned hepatocytes will remain
diffusely stained.
Although the term steatohepatitis implies that steatosis
and inflammation are important parts of the injury, these
components may vary considerably in degree. A biopsy that
shows characteristic ballooning injury, but has little steatosis
or inflammation, may still be confidently classified as steatohepatitis. Early in the disease, when fibrosis is mild or
absent, the steatosis typically shows a zone 3 distribution; the
inflammation is predominantly lobular and associated with
the steatosis and ballooning.7 As the disease progresses, the
steatosis may lose this classical zonal distribution and the
portal inflammation may become more prominent. The
lobular inflammation may become so severe in zone 3 that
the pathologist may mistake inflamed perivenular areas for
inflamed portal areas and classify the biopsy as “chronic
hepatitis.” This pitfall can be avoided by looking for the
balloon cells, which are usually present in such cases as
well as the absence of the interlobular bile duct. As has
been recently documented, in severe inflammation, an arteriole may be prominent in zone 3.13
The pattern of fibrosis is also distinctive in steatohepatitis.
Although not required to make a diagnosis of steatohepatitis,
fibrosis is usually present and its presence can be very
helpful. Fibrosis begins in zone 3 as delicate strands of
collagen that isolate one or more hepatocytes. A good quality
Masson trichrome stain (or equivalent) is critical to find the
earliest evidence of fibrosis. Later, periportal fibrosis will
develop, with strands of collagen entrapping periportal
hepatocytes and extending into the surrounding parenchyma. At this stage, a component of ductular reaction may be
observed. Rarely, a case with characteristic ballooning injury
will show only periportal fibrosis—these cases should still be
classified as steatohepatitis. As the disease progresses, bridging fibrosis will form. Unlike viral hepatitis, in which the
fibrotic bridges are usually single, thick, collagen septations
of collapsed parenchyma and ductular reaction, the bridges
that form first in steatohepatitis may be extensions of the
perisinusoidal fibrosis that forms networks between adjacent vascular structures. Bridging fibrosis may be central–
central, with retention of hepatocytes within the complex
network of fibrosis; may be central–portal, with eventual
loss of hepatocytes, or may be portal–portal in which parenchymal loss and ductular reaction comprise the septal structures. Eventually, the trapped hepatocytes will be lost,
and regeneration will create solid nodules of hepatocytes,
so that the end stage may resemble cirrhosis resulting
from other forms of nonbiliary liver disease. Because the
fibrotic progression in steatohepatitis involves both portal
areas and hepatic veins (►Fig. 2), fibrosis staging systems
used for viral hepatitis are inadequate and fibrosis modeling
is nonlinear.

the chronic viral hepatitides. Solid arrows depict possible paths of progression, whereas hatched arrows indicate possible paths of regression.

When the histologic pattern is not distinct enough to make
an unequivocal diagnosis of steatohepatitis, but there are still
suggestive changes, the term, borderline steatohepatitis has
been utilized.14,15 In the NASH CRN it has been the practice of
the Central Pathology Committee to use this category for cases
with characteristic fibrosis, but in which no characteristic
ballooning injury is found. There is some variation in practice
on this point and many pathologists feel comfortable making
the diagnosis of steatohepatitis if characteristic fibrosis is
present in the absence of ballooning. In other cases, in which
the changes of ballooning and/or fibrosis are mild or equivocal,
borderline steatohepatitis may be a better diagnosis than
either definite steatohepatitis or steatosis alone. Studies
from the NASH CRN have demonstrated that patients with
biopsies that show borderline steatohepatitis have clinical
characteristics that fall between those with definite steatohepatitis and those classified as not having steatohepatitis.16
Other histologic features may be seen in biopsies of patients
with NAFLD, including nonzonal small patches of hepatocytes
with distinctly microvesicular steatosis, megamitochondria,
glycogenated nuclei, large lipogranulomas, and hepatocellular
glycogenosis, but these findings have little bearing on the
categorization of NAFLD or the diagnosis of steatohepatitis.
The cytoplasmic changes of microvesicular steatosis and glycogenosis deserve special mention. Microvesicular steatosis
results in a distinct alteration in hepatocytes: under low power
magnification, the hepatocytes are pale, but on higher magnification, an almost foamy appearance is noted. Although tiny
vesicles may be appreciated, it is a challenge to actually discern
individual fat vesicles, and one would not be able to count
them. The nucleus is commonly central in the cell. This form of
steatosis is quite distinct from the small droplets that can be
seen coalescing around the single large vesicle in macrovesicular steatosis, or the occasional droplets within hepatocytes
that do not alter the appearance of the cytoplasm otherwise.
Glycogenotic hepatocytes may mimic ballooned hepatocytes.
The glycogen lakes do not stain well with hematoxylin or eosin
and may cause the cytoplasm to have the clumped appearance
of true ballooning injury. Apoptotic hepatocytes are not included in the classification of steatohepatitis, but have been
shown in several studies and by a variety of methods to
correlate with severity of steatohepatitis.
Notably absent in noncirrhotic NAFLD biopsies are the
characteristic histologic features associated with alcoholic
hepatitis. In alcoholic hepatitis, steatosis is not necessarily
present, MDB-containing hepatocytes may not be ballooned
and may be surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(satellitosis); dense perisinusoidal fibrosis and not uncommonly, bilirubinostasis are also present. The prognostic lesion
of sclerosing hyaline necrosis of alcoholic hepatitis is not seen
in NAFLD. However, in most cases it will not be possible to
distinguish alcoholic from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis based
on the liver biopsy alone.1,17
Zone 1, Borderline Pattern
In 2005, Schwimmer and colleagues published a series of
cases of NAFLD in children.18 Although some of the children
had steatosis alone and some had steatohepatitis similar to
that seen in adults, some had a previously unrecognized
pattern of fibrotic fatty liver disease in which the injury
seemed to involve acinar zone 1 rather than acinar zone 3.
Since that time, these observations have been extended by the
NASH CRN and others with an incidence varying from 8 to
22% in the populations studied.19,20 Within the NASH CRN,
the pathology committee separated out these cases as “borderline, zone 1, steatohepatitis.”
19 The borderline term has
been used to indicate evidence of a potentially fibrotically
progressive NAFLD that lacked the full spectrum of features of
typical definite steatohepatitis. This pattern is seen most
often in younger, usually pre- or peripubertal children and
rarely in older teens and adults. Biopsies show steatosis that is
either zone 1 predominant or panacinar; in either case, the
steatosis is closely associated with portal areas and tends to
diminish around the hepatic veins (►Fig. 3). Ballooning injury
is unusual and MDB are essentially never seen in this pattern.
Portal inflammation is present, but usually mild, with little or

pattern. In both photomicrographs, portal areas are indicated as “P”
and central veins are indicated by “V.” (A) Steatohepatitis. There is
clear ballooning injury near the central vein, with inflammation and
steatosis nearby. The region near the portal area is devoid of these
findings. (B) Zone 1 borderline pattern. The portal area is expanded by
fibrosis and chronic inflammation. Steatosis completely surrounds the
portal area. In contrast, the central vein region shows none of these
findings.

no interface hepatitis. Because of the lack of ballooning, the
presence of fibrosis is the only feature that sets these cases
apart from the nonspecific pattern of steatosis described
above. The fibrosis is initially periportal and progresses to
portal–portal bridging fibrosis, with distinct sparing of the
hepatic veins. The natural history of the zone 1, borderline
pattern is unclear due to the lack of longitudinal studies
that include patients with this pattern of injury. It should be
noted that none of the existing imaging methods that can
identify steatosis or fibrosis in the liver would be able to
distinguish this zone 1, borderline pattern from classical
steatohepatitis.
Cryptogenic Fibrosis and Cirrhosis
Because of the temporally variable nature of steatosis and the
tendency of the characteristic lesions of ballooning, MDB and
perisinusoidal fibrosis to disappear along with acinar architecture as the disease progresses, there will be some cases of
advanced liver disease that lack sufficient changes to be
classified into one of the four groups outlined above. Histologically, there is advanced fibrosis present, usually cirrhosis
but sometimes only bridging fibrosis, minimal steatosis and
no features that would suggest steatohepatitis, such as ballooning injury or MDBs. When this occurs because of therapy
and a preceding biopsy shows steatohepatitis, a descriptive
diagnosis that includes the phrase “consistent with resolved
steatohepatitis” could be used. When either cryptogenic
fibrosis or cirrhosis is present at baseline, a diligent search
should be made to exclude other causes of advanced liver
disease before ascribing the case to previous fatty liver
disease that has now disappeared, as it is well-recognized
that other forms of chronic liver disease, such as alcoholic
cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis, may also “burn out.”
Evaluation of Liver Biopsies in NAFLD
Adequacy
Prior to evaluation of liver biopsies in any form of medical
liver disease, the pathologist must make a determination of
adequacy of sampling. This continues to be most relevant in
NAFLD due to the fact that clinical testing can only result in
exclusion of other liver disease and a strong likelihood of
NAFLD, but not a definitive diagnosis. For adequacy, therefore,
the biopsy must penetrate sufficiently below the capsule and
into hepatic parenchyma to avoid a purely subcapsular sample. Length of the sample can be considered a surrogate
parameter of adequacy; 1.5 cm is generally considered appropriate.21 The width of the biopsy is also important, as
narrow bore biopsies may not show complete acini and may
transect portal tracts, leaving the pathologist without a firm
assessment of architectural integrity.
Just as with other forms of chronic liver disease, the
process of NAFLD may not necessarily affect the liver parenchyma uniformly.22 However, a variety of techniques can be
utilized to minimize sampling “error.” These are particularly
important in clinical studies that include serial biopsies. The
biopsies should be obtained from subjects in a similar fashion; otherwise, a certain degree of variation may be due to the
difference in technique. These include the use of large bore
needles (16 gauge or wider) and a needle biopsy length of at
least 1.5 cm to 2.0 cm.23,24Recognition of the differences of
anatomy between the lobes highlights the potential for
greater fibrosis in left lobe biopsies, due to larger portal
structures near the capsule and higher capsule : parenchyma
ratio compared with a right lobe biopsy. Biopsies obtained
during ratio surgical procedure will result in clusters of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (known to pathologists as
surgical hepatitis) if care is not taken to perform the biopsy
as quickly as possible after induction of anesthesia.25 This
may result in inability to appropriately judge inflammation.
Failure to place the biopsy immediately in fixative may result
in autolysis, which will lower estimates of inflammation due
to lysis of lymphocytes. Finally, the significance of pathologist
expertise has been documented in this disease,26 just as in
other forms of chronic liver disease.27
Grading and Staging
The concept of grading and staging the histologic features in
NAFLD are theoretically similar to those for chronic hepatitis:
grade is a global measure of hepatocellular and necroinflammatory injury and reflects features that are potentially reversible. Stage is an assessment of fibrosis location (i.e., scar)
and architectural remodeling; thus, it is potentially irreversible. A subtle, but important distinction between grade and
stage, is the former describes amount, whereas the latter does
not. Stage, in all scoring systems to date, describes only
parenchymal location of collagen and matrix deposition,
and vascular/architectural alterations, but not absolute quantity.28,29Morphometric measurements of fibrosis in liver
disease require specialized techniques, which yield important, but different information than staging. Descriptors such
as mild, moderate, and severe can be utilized for grade,
whereas these should not be applied to stage because of
the inclusion of fibrosis location (zone 3 perisinusoidal, for
example), and architectural alteration(s) when present (i.e.,
cirrhosis).
In 1999, a classification of NAFLD was proposed30that
combined the necroinflammatory lesions and fibrosis. That
same year, a method of grading and staging NASH was
proposed.31 The two studies served separate purposes; the
latter was modeled upon the contemporaneous paradigms in
chronic hepatitis that separately assessed features of ongoing
injury (i.e., activity) and scarring (i.e., fibrosis; reviewed in32).
The 1999 proposal specifically focused on lesions that differed from those of portal-based chronic hepatitis scoring
systems. The NASH CRN further developed a semiquantitative
scoring system for evaluation of serial biopsies by routine
hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome stains from
patients in clinical trials.5 In this system, three features were
identified in a blinded, validated study that correlated with
the separately derived diagnosis of steatohepatitis/steatosis
amount, lobular inflammation amount, and ballooning injury
severity. The lesions are individually scored and the unweighted sum is the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). The fibrosis
score, as discussed and diagrammed in ►Fig. 2, reflects the
unique patterns of fibrosis that may occur in the variety of

conditions of NAFLD. ►Table 3 summarizes the NAS and
fibrosis scores.
NAS vs NASH: Or…NAS: Can It Be Considered an
Appropriate Replacement for the Diagnosis of NASH?
Prior to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus and the
widespread epidemic of obesity and associated dysregulated
lipids, liver test elevations could not always be explained by
serologic assays, however, there was a recognition that
“chronic hepatitis” existed and had prototypic characteristic
histopathologic features regardless of specific etiology. For
example, regardless of pathogenesis, “chronic hepatitis” is
characterized by portal chronic inflammation that breeches
the limiting plate (i.e., interface activity). One of the first
methods of semiquantitative evaluation was created to assess
treatment efficacy; this system was popularized as the Knodell Histologic Activity Index.33 Scores for activity could range
between 0 to 14, and those for fibrosis, 0 to 4. Interestingly, no
single HAI score was chosen as a diagnostic score of chronic
hepatitis; the diagnosis remains up to the pathologist after
clinical inclusion/exclusion by serologic testing.
When the NAS (0–8) was proposed, the study was based
on 32 adult biopsies read blinded twice by nine pathologists,
and clearly documented that biopsies with higher scores ( 5)
tended to be diagnosed as steatohepatitis, whereas biopsies
with lower scores (3) were generally not considered to be
diagnostic of steatohepatitis.5 However, there were several
biopsies in the NAS 3 to 5 range that overlapped all diagnostic
criteria. The relationship between the score and the diagnosis
is a consequence of how the score was created because the
score incorporated major histologic features (aside from
fibrosis) that pathologists use to make the diagnosis of
steatohepatitis. The NASH CRN has published a more recent
study of 934 noncirrhotic adult biopsies scored by the Central
Pathology Committee and contemporaneous demographic
and laboratory features. The findings support the concepts
that the NAS and the diagnosis are interrelated, but also do in
fact have distinct clinicopathologic meanings; thus, they
should not be considered interchangeable.34 Among cases
with NAS  5, 7% were diagnosed as “not steatohepatitis” and
38% as “borderline.” In the definite steatohepatitis category,
only 75% were NAS  5, thus the remaining 25% had scores
 4. The sensitivity and specificity of NAS  5 for definite
steatohepatitis were 0.75 and 0.83, respectively. By multivariable regression, it was shown that although both NAS and the
diagnosis correlated with elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, only the diagnosis of
steatohepatitis did so with metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
and insulin resistance as measured by either homeostasis
model assessment–insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or the
Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). These
findings have important implications for studies that
base entry criteria solely on the NAS, rather than on the
pathologist's separately derived diagnosis. Such studies
risk exclusion of cases with mild but definitive findings of
steatohepatitis, and inclusion of cases with marked steatosis
and inflammation but lack ballooning.
Other Lesions of Interest in NAFLD/NASH
Apoptosis
Apoptotic hepatocytes are readily noted in liver biopsies as
rounded, eosinophilic cytoplasmic fragments, which appear to
be free within the sinusoids or surrounded by Kupffer or other
inflammatory cells. In some instances, the apoptotic hepatocytes may contain pyknotic nuclear material; however, most
frequently they do not. Regardless of the method of ascertainment – the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay, serum keratin 18 fragments, or
simply recording apoptotic hepatocytes by light microscopy –
the severity of apoptosis has been shown to correlate with
other markers of severity in steatohepatitis.35–38

Inflammation
Inflammatory infiltrates can be noted in the hepatic acini/
lobules or the portal tracts. Specifically, the infiltrates are
predominantly of the chronic inflammatory cell phenotypes,
such as lymphocytes, monocytes, occasional eosinophils, and
macrophages/Kupffer cells. Rare polymorphs are noted; however, a lesion common to many forms of alcoholic hepatitis,
referred to as satellitosis because of polymorphs encircling
MDB-containing hepatocytes, is rare in NASH. Likewise, the
portal-based lesion of ductular reaction accompanied by
fibrosis and periductular polymorphs, pericholangitis, which
frequently occurs in alcoholic hepatitis,1 is a feature that
would raise a concern of pancreatitis or even alcoholic injury
in NASH. On the other hand, lipogranulomas of varying sizes
and distribution are common to both NAFLD and alcoholic
liver disease. Lipogranulomas not only consist of varying
amounts of vacuolated fat droplets, but also of admixtures
of mononuclear or eosinophilic white cells and varying
degrees of collagen. Lipogranulomas near a terminal hepatic
venule may initially raise a consideration of perisinusoidal
fibrosis without careful evaluation.6,39
Inflammation in portal tracts may or may not appear to
correlate with that in the lobules. In fact, chronic inflammation that is disproportionate to the above-described lesions of
activity deserves evaluation for a concurrent form of chronic
liver disease,40–42 as the recognized prevalence of NAFLD43
does not preclude that of the other liver diseases, such as
hepatitis C virus (HCV), autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and even ALD, to name a few. There are various
proposals in the pathology literature as to how to approach a
liver biopsy with a documented form of chronic liver disease
and NAFLD. Documentation of amount and location of steatosis may or may not serve as a clue to the “origin” of the
steatosis, as steatosis in HCV gt non3 is commonly periportal,
in contrast to perivenular in NAFLD. One group has suggested
that ballooning is sufficient to differentiate NASH from HCV.44
Another group has suggested stricter criteria, i.e., the presence
of zone 3 pericellular fibrosis as the lesion of distinction of
steatohepatitis from portal-based fibrosis of other forms of
chronic liver disease.40 The former will result in higher incidence of steatohepatitis than the latter, as hepatocellular
ballooning is a lesion known to occur in viral hepatitis.45
Residual portal chronic inflammation was noted to be
greater in relative proportion to lobular inflammation in liver
biopsies in otherwise successfully treated subjects in a small
medical treatment trial.46 This finding, although not directly
noted, can be found in other reports of surgical47 and medical
treatment trials in adults.48 Recently, the large database of
biopsies and matching demographic material from the NASH
CRN was studied for the significance of greater than mild
portal chronic inflammation in baseline biopsies of 728 adults
and 205 children. In both groups, the lesion was associated
with clinical and histologic features of severity and advanced
disease.49
Vascular Alterations
Recent work has highlighted the microscopic observation of
the intraacinar branch of the hepatic artery in the perivenular
region in active steatohepatitis (►Fig. 4).13 The finding
correlates with severity of disease. The presence of this vessel
alongside the outflow vein may lead to confusion for a portal
tract, particularly when perivenular inflammation is marked.
Thus, careful study to document the presence or absence of an
accompanying interlobular bile duct becomes crucial.
Implications of Histologic Evaluation for Designing
Treatment Trials
This topic was the focus of a recent AASLD Endpoints Workshop that was subsequently published.15 The definitions as
detailed above have been proposed in the article for steatosis
and steatohepatitis (definite and borderline). The use of the
NASH CRN scoring system has been discussed as a validated
method of objective semiquantitative assessment of histologic features that can be compared before and after treatment
intervention. The NAS itself has applied in a long-term
outcome study of 52 Asian subjects with repeated biopsies
at 36 months. The authors found moderate correlation of
change in activity score and serum keratin 18 levels, and
independent correlation with increase in body mass index in
subjects who showed progression over a 3-year period.50
Weight reduction was the most important variable in improvement or lack of worsening in both activity and fibrosis.
NAFLD in Lipodystrophy
Lipodystrophy encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases with abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution. The changes in subcutaneous fat may be localized,
partial (e.g., affecting major portions of the body), or general.
Partial and general forms of lipodystrophy may be the result
of congenital genetic mutations or may be acquired, often as a
medication side effect. One of the consequences of the loss of
adipose tissue is peripheral insulin resistance, as well as
decreased serum levels of adiponectin and leptin. Fat may
be stored in other organs, including the liver, skeletal muscle,
Figure 4 Perivenular fibrosis with a neo-artery. In this case of
steatohepatitis, there is a perivenular cuff of inflammation and fibrosis.
A small arteriole is present (arrow). No bile duct is seen. This
appearance of the central vein may cause an observer to mistakenly
conclude that this is a portal area, leading to a diagnosis of chronic
hepatitis rather than steatohepatitis.

and pancreas.51,52 Patients with lipodystrophy often have
type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia. Although
hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis have been recognized in
patients with lipodystrophy, most of the data are in the form
of case reports and small series. In recent a series of 10
lipodystrophic patients undergoing leptin therapy, liver biopsies were performed before and during therapy to assess
whether the systemic metabolic improvements were having
the expected effect on the liver.53 Of the 10 patients, eight
patients had steatohepatitis at baseline, one had only mild
steatosis, and one did not have NAFLD at all. Fibrosis was
common, with some degree of fibrosis in eight patients,
whereas three had bridging fibrosis and one had cirrhosis.
The pattern of injury was that of the classical steatohepatitis
described above, although only three had MDBs. Treatment
with leptin was associated with resolution of histologic and
biochemical features of liver disease. Other investigators have
also reported steatosis and steatohepatitis on biopsy in
patients with lipodystrophy.54,55 Ultrastructural studies
have demonstrated alterations in mitochondria including
abnormal cristae, matrix rarefication, and crystalloids, as
well as increased numbers of peroxisomes.56,57 Certain antiretroviral therapies used to treat human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection have been associated with acquired
forms of lipodystrophy and also with NAFLD, and NAFLD is
a common finding on liver biopsy in this population.58
Because NAFLD and NASH are common liver diseases and
HIV-infected patients may also have other predisposing
factors, a causal association between individual drugs and
liver disease is difficult to establish.
NAFLD in Bariatric Surgery Patients
Patients undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss are at
risk for NAFLD and often have other comorbidities related to
severe obesity, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
sleep apnea, and coronary artery disease. A high percentage
will have metabolic syndrome. Because the left lobe of the
liver is accessible to the surgeon during the procedure, biopsy
surveys have provided a window into the liver disease of
these patients. A meta-analysis of such surveys that included
1620 patients from 12 studies noted a high prevalence of
steatosis and steatohepatitis (91% and 37%, respectively).3
Although the proportion of patients with steatosis was high
across all of the studies (85 to 99%), the incidence of steatohepatitis varied from 24 to 98%. The incidence of individual
findings beyond steatosis varied considerably, with inflammation seen in 24 to 98% and fibrosis in 13 to 97% across
studies. These differences could represent differences in
operational histologic definitions, but may also represent
differences in populations undergoing bariatric surgery at
the various institutions. Despite the high prevalence of liver
disease, biopsy of the liver during the procedure is not
standard practice among surgeons. Visible inspection of the
liver by the surgeon is not sufficient to exclude liver disease. In
a study of 100 patients in which the external appearance of
the liver was systematically recorded by the surgeon, there
was no relationship between the gross appearance and the
presence or severity of liver disease on biopsy.59
Several studies have reported an increased prevalence of
periportal fibrosis (NASH CRN stage 1C) in morbidly obese
patients. Abrams and coworkers first brought attention to this
finding. In their cohort of 195 bariatric surgery patients, a
third had stage 1C fibrosis, most with some degree of
steatosis and inflammation.60 The proportion of early stage
fibrosis that is portal as opposed to perisinusoidal is
50%,61,62 which is a larger proportion than in nonbariatric
populations undergoing biopsy to evaluate NAFLD.14 The
clinical significance of this finding and how it relates to the
other features of NAFLD is unclear.
Summary
When liver biopsies are performed as part of clinical
studies of NAFLD, attention should be paid to the overall
disease classification according to the pattern of injury as
well as to the grade and stage of the disease. Individual
lesions can be evaluated for severity and distribution
within the acinar architecture of the liver. There may be
differences in the histologic features of various populations
such as bariatric surgery patients or pediatric patients as
compared with adult populations derived from hepatology
clinics or diabetes clinics. It is important to note that the
process of grading and staging is related to, yet separate
from the process of assigning a diagnostic pattern. Both are
important in the pathologic evaluation of NAFLD liver
biopsies.
