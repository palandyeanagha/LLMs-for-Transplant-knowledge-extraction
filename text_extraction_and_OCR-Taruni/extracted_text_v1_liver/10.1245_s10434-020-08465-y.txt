A consequence of the rapid technological advancements
and sub-specialization of oncology practice we have witnessed during the past two decades is the increased
complexity of care delivery. Patients and caregivers now
must navigate the care continuum of screening, treatment,
survivorship, and symptom palliation with a diverse group
of providers across multiple care settings. As a result,
effective co-coordination of care for patients with a diagnosis of cancer represents is one of the greatest challenges
facing contemporary health care systems.
Recognizing the complexity of coordinating stakeholders, both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and
the European Society for Medical Oncology have promoted multidisciplinary care as the gold standard and
framework for providing optimal cancer treatment.1 The
improved overall survival and patient outcomes associated
with multidisciplinary cancer care teams validate this
position.2–5 Although varying definitions exist for multidisciplinary care, the central tenets are bidirectional
communication across disciplines and a shared understanding of a patient-specific comprehensive treatment
plan.
The recent article by Retrouvey et al.6 draws attention to
a crucial but often overlooked topic in the spectrum of
cancer care (i.e., the role and utility of reconstructive
plastic surgeons). The value of reconstructive surgery in
oncology is increasingly gaining acceptance due to
improved oncologic survival and an accompanying shift in
focus to functional and quality-of-life outcomes for cancer
patients. Currently, many health systems still struggle to
identify and operationalize a role for plastic surgeons in an
interprofessional collaborative model for oncology care.
Breast reconstruction represents an ideal use case for
unpacking this issue given the annual incidence and policy
relevance of breast cancer. Through the years, improved
psychosocial outcomes (e.g., body image and psychosocial
well-being) and quality of life (e.g., physical and sexual
well-being) without adverse sequela of oncologic outcomes
have been associated with post-mastectomy reconstruction.7–9 These gains are heightened for patients with
oropharyngeal cancers and extremity sarcomas, with
modern reconstructive techniques (e.g., microsurgery,
three-dimensional modeling, and customized implants)
enabling modest to significant functional recovery (ambulation, speech, and smile). Finally, reconstructive surgery
through shared decision-making, allows for more personalized treatment decisions for cancer patients.
Patient access to post-mastectomy reconstruction has
received considerable attention during the past few decades. Despite mandated insurance coverage in the United
States through the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act,
socioeconomic, geographic, and health care barriers continue to limit access to these procedures.10–15 At a local
health care level, discussions about reconstruction during
the initial consultation with the breast cancer surgeon have
been shown to have significant impact on the likelihood of
patients receiving reconstruction.16 From this context,
Retrouvey et al.6 sought to explore the perceived role of
multidisciplinary collaboration in the delivery of these

procedures. Through qualitative interviews with 30 participants (22 physicians and 8 administrators), the authors
explored the attitudes, beliefs, and values of key stakeholders in the provision of breast cancer care to patients
from six centers across Ontario, Canada. The authors
should be commended for this important study, which
offers a nuanced understanding of the local contextual
factors that have an impact on access to these procedures.
The major findings of the study underscore important
challenges to interprofessional collaboration and care
coordination. At a physician level, the lack of role clarity,
the absence of an explicitly defined leader, and the varying
perceptions of the usefulness of breast reconstruction have
discouraged collaboration and rendered its delivery more
difficult. The authors also discovered inconsistent views
concerning the role of plastic surgeons on the oncologic
team. Although plastic surgeons considered themselves
members of the oncologic team, their colleagues generally
disagreed because reconstructive procedures have not been
considered cancer-related treatments. Most general surgeons thought it was their responsibility to discuss breast
reconstruction as an option with their patients, and
administrators appeared to play a key role in the delivery of
breast reconstruction conditional on their values and goals.
In the designing of multi-level strategies to improve
access to breast reconstruction, the findings from this study
might be best served by the framework of the adapted
model for the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases
(TICD).17–19 This model provides a number of potential
levers to improve interprofessional collaboration at the
local level (i.e., incentives, organization of professional
interactions, resources, and capacity for organizational
change).
In addressing professional interactions, strategies should
focus on improving communication and leveraging these
channels with the greatest influence. The National
Accreditation Program for Breast Centers has endorsed a
standard mandating that surgical oncologists offer a referral for plastic surgery at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.
Implementation of this standard in local health care settings
must entail regular audits of referral volume and the
reversal of any identified disincentives for referral to
plastic surgery. Furthermore, resources such as decisionsupport tools, patient education materials, and establishment of a longitudinal patient navigation program are
essential.
Organizational changes may require allocation or reallocation of authority to make referral decisions. It may be
helpful to appoint an implementation leader, such as an
administrator or clinical champion, to define clear guidelines for deciding who is accountable for initially
discussing the option of breast reconstruction with patients
considering mastectomy. The referral process should be
transparent, with consideration of individual feedback
loops to providers.
The role of health policy in promoting access to breast
reconstruction cannot be overstated, although it is uneven
because poor access for racial minorities and economically
disadvantaged women persist.11,12,15 Recognizing barriers
posed by communication and referral patterns in access to
breast reconstruction, the state of New York enacted Public
Health (NY PBH) Law 2803-O in 2010, which mandates
that surgeons communicate about reconstructive surgery
with patients undergoing mastectomy. Initial policy evaluations have shown that this approach likely reduced racial
and ethnic disparities in access to these procedures 20.
In conclusion, the challenges posed by care coordination
for cancer patients demand thoughtful solutions that
leverage principles of implementation science and, in some
cases, health policy. Given advances in modern-day
reconstructive techniques, nearly all patients with oncologic defects may benefit from consultation and
coordination with plastic surgery. Improving interprofessional collaboration between oncologic teams and plastic
surgeons represents another important opportunity to
advance patient-centered cancer care.
