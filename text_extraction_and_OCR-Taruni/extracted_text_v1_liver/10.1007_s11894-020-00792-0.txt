Abstract
Purpose of the Review Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) includes a heterogeneous group of conditions. The aim of this
paper is to make an overview on the denominations, diagnostical features and management of porto-sinusoidal vascular disease
(PSVD) and chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) being the main causes of NCPH in the Western world.
Recent Findings The management of NCPH consists in the treatment of associated diseases and of portal hypertension (PH). PH
due to PSVD or PVT is managed similarly to PH due to cirrhosis. TIPS placement and liver transplantation are considerable
options in patients with refractory variceal bleeding/ascites and with progressive liver failure. Anticoagulation is a cornerstone
both in the treatment of thrombosis in PSVD and in the prevention of thrombosis recurrence in patients with portal cavernoma.
Summary Physicians should be aware of the existence of PSVD and chronic PVT and actively search them in particular settings.
To now, the management of portal hypertension-related complications in NCPH is the same of those of cirrhosis. Large
cooperative studies on the natural history of NCPH are necessary to better define its management.

Introduction
The term non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) refers to a
heterogeneous group of liver disorders that primarily affect
the liver vascular system and that are classified anatomically
on the basis of site of resistance to blood flow, as pre-hepatic,
hepatic (pre-sinusoidal, sinusoidal or post-sinusoidal) and
post-hepatic [1, 2]. The causes of NCPH are listed Table 1.
For years they have been considered quite rare conditions, but
their scarce frequency was mostly due to the poor knowledge
and to the low grade of suspicion. However, in the last years,
the multicentric cooperation together with the unification of
the several terminologies and nomenclatures used to name
these diseases led to deepen the knowledge on the clinical
features, presentation and management of vascular liver
diseases.
The present paper represents an overview on the denominations, diagnostical features and management of portosinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) and chronic portal vein
thrombosis (PVT) that represent the most frequent causes of
NCPH in the Western world.
Porto-Sinusoidal Vascular Disease (PSVD)
Definition and Nomenclature
The term porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) regroups
several conditions characterized by alterations of the small
branches of portal veins previously named from an histological point of view as “obliterative portal venopathy”, “nodular
regenerative hyperplasia”, “hepato-portal sclerosis”, “non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis” and “incomplete septal fibrosis” or from

a clinical point of view as “idiopathic portal hypertension” and
“idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH)” [3•].
Almost recently, new diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the European Association for the Vascular Liver
Disease (VALDIG) [4••] that defines the diagnosis of PSVD
in the presence of one of the three following features:
i) Absence of cirrhosis at an adequate liver biopsy and at
least one specific sign of portal hypertension
ii) Absence of cirrhosis at an adequate liver biopsy and at
least one specific histological sign of PSVD
iii) Absence of cirrhosis at an adequate liver biopsy and at
least one non-specific sign of portal hypertension and at
least one non-specific histological sign of PSVD
Specific and non-specific clinical and histological signs are
reported in Table 2.
The term PSVD replaced the term INCPH in order to include the patients with specific histological features but no
clinical signs portal hypertension.
When to Suspect PSVD?
There are two clinical scenarios in whom PSVD can be
suspected: patients with chronic and unexplained alteration
of liver enzymes without portal hypertension and patients with
unexplained clinically evident portal hypertension. In both the
cases, known causes of chronic liver disease or portal hypertension should be excluded.
The alterations of liver tests are various, and in particular
they are represented by a mild elevation of ALT and AST, by
an elevation of alkaline phosphatase 2 times upper the normal
value or by an elevation of gamma-GT. These alterations are
not associated to signs of portal hypertension [5, 6].
Two recent European series showed that the histological
lesions usually observed in patients affected by PSVD with
portal hypertension (i.e. obliterative portal venopathy, OPV)
were present in the 19% [7] and 25% [5] of the liver biopsies
of patients with chronic elevation liver enzymes without cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Some of these patients developed clinical signs of portal hypertension during the followup. These observations suggest first of all that PSVD should
be suspected and actively searched among the patients with
chronic liver test abnormalities of unknown aetiology and no
signs of portal hypertension and that, such conditions, PSVD
with and without portal hypertension may be different stages
of the same disease where histological PSVD might represent
an “early” pre-symptomatic stage of PSVD with portal
hypertension.
PSVD should be also suspected in patients with unexplained portal hypertension.
The absence of a cause of chronic liver disease together
with the presence of a marked portal hypertension with normal
or only mildly altered liver function tests should raise the
suspicion of PSVD. If transaminases or cholestasis enzymes
could sometimes be elevated, the liver synthetic capacity is
usually preserved [8••]. In fact, in these patients, bilirubin and
albumin are quite normal, and prothrombin time is usually
superior up to 50%. Moreover, other laboratory alterations
such as anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are the
consequences of hypersplenism. On this basis, the distinction
between PSVD and cryptogenic compensated cirrhosis may
be very difficult and should always be supported by a liver
biopsy. However, liver elastography may be helpful in this
differential diagnosis at least to suspect PSVD and to select
patients to be submitted to liver biopsy. In fact, the presence of
a low liver stiffness (< 10 kPa) in patients with clinically evident portal hypertension may make the diagnosis of cirrhosis
unlikely [9].
Another challenge for the diagnosis of PSVD is with patients with chronic PVT. In fact, with new insights in the
natural history of PSVD and its physiopathology, it is known
that PSVD is frequently complicated by extrahepatic portal
vein thrombosis [6, 8••], and, hypothetically, if a certain

patient is investigated after PVT occurs, it may be impossible
to determine if a pre-existent PSVD is the cause of the vascular disease. In these cases, the only way to investigate PSVD
might be performing a liver biopsy. Hence, the presence of a
pre-existing, undiagnosed PSVD should be suspected in patients with acute or chronic PVT, and that is why, the criteria
of the patency of the portal vein has been eliminated in the last
definition of PSVD.
Moreover, PSVD is frequently associated with several systemic conditions and with the chronic exposition to various
drugs and toxins (Table 3) that may play a direct role in the
pathophysiology of the liver alterations. It has been reported
that more than a half of PSVD patients have an associated
disease [2, 6, 10]. As a practical consequence, in patients
affected by these diseases or exposed to these drugs, the
searching of signs of portal hypertension is suggested. In particular, physicians should be aware of the possibility to develop PSVD, and they should be careful about the presence of
liver tests alteration, of indirect signs of portal hypertension
such as thrombocytopenia and of splenomegaly or portal vein
dilatation, when an imaging technique is performed. When
one of these alterations is present, the patient should be referred to a hepatologist.
Diagnosis
For the diagnosis of PSVD, a combination of histological and
radiological findings is necessary.
Biopsy remains mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of
PSVD. Since the typical histological lesions cannot be all
always contemporary present and they are distributed in a
focal way, it is necessary to have an adequate liver specimen
(Table 2) [4••, 11•]. The optimal sample should measure more
than 20 mm of length and contain at least 10 portal spaces, and
it should be low fragmented. It is equally important that the
liver biopsy would be referred to an expert pathologist.
Unfortunately, there are not specific radiological signs of
PSVD, but the combination of several findings may suggest
the diagnosis of PSVD.
Doppler ultrasound is frequently the first examination performed in patients with suspicion of PSVD. In these patients,
the liver aspect may be either normal or inhomogeneous with
irregular surface due to the micronodular transformation, rendering very difficult to differentiate it from cirrhosis, and caudal
lobe hypertrophy and right hepatic lobe atrophy are present. In
PSVD the main findings are the signs of portal hypertension
such as splenomegaly, even more marked than in patients with
cirrhosis, and portal venous axis dilatation. Moreover, in
PSVD, the portal vein may appear markedly thickened with
hyperechoic walls, anomalies that are found also in its
intrahepatic branches, probably indicating periportal fibrosis.
Computed tomography (CT) would reveal vascular abnormalities especially on the peripheral intrahepatic portal
branches (i.e. heterogeneous hepatic enhancement, abrupt
narrowing of second-degree intrahepatic portal vein branches,
paucity of the medium size portal branches). Moreover, CT
has a better performance than Doppler ultrasound once a portal vein thrombosis is found, in order to assess its extension
and duration but also for the evaluation of porto-systemic
shunts. Finally, CT may be helpful to assess the presence of
benign hypervascular nodules due to the haemodynamic abnormalities [12, 13].
Liver stiffness may have a role in the diagnosis of PSVD at
least to rule out the presence of cirrhosis. In these patients,
liver stiffness can be normal or slightly elevated but surely
lower than cirrhosis [9]. The presence of clinically relevant
portal hypertension with normal or moderate elevated values
of liver stiffness should lead to exclude cirrhosis and to suspect PSVD. Furthermore, liver stiffness measurement would
be helpful also in the distinction between patients with PVT
caused and not caused by PSVD being it higher in patients
with PVT secondary to PSVD [14, 15].

Owing to the fact that patients with PSVD have a presinusoidal type of portal hypertension, the HVPG is normal
or slightly elevated, frequently < 10 mmHg [9, 16, 17].
Moreover, the presence of vein-to-vein communications, often seen in these patients with a frequency higher than in
cirrhotic patients, may further underestimate the value of
HVPG. Hence, contrarily to cirrhosis, haemodynamic studies
have scarce utility to indirectly evaluate the severity of portal
hypertension in patients with PSVD where the HVPG is not
correlated with clinical events such as the development of
oesophageal varices, variceal bleeding or ascites.
Chronic Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT)
Definition and Nomenclature
Portal vein thrombosis refers to a primary obstruction by a
thrombus located on the trunk or the left or right branches of
the portal vein in the absence of malignant invasion or constriction. The adjective “chronic” refers to a long-standing
thrombosis, and the term “portal cavernoma” (or
cavernomatous transformation of the portal vein) defines the
set of collateral veins replacing the portal vein. In adult patients, these two terms are synonymous, while in children,
portal cavernoma may be the consequence of a congenital
malformation as well as the sequel of PVT [18–20].
Aetiology
In 75% of patients with PVT and without an underlying liver
disease (cirrhosis or PSVD), a risk factor for venous thrombosis
is identified. Risk factors are various, and they are divided into
local and systemic [21]. Local risk factors are mainly represented
by inflammatory conditions affecting intraperitoneal organs, and
they can be found in only one-third of the patients. Systemic risk
factors are more frequent, and they are represented especially by
thrombophilic conditions (i.e. protein S or C deficiency,
antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden and prothrombin
mutation) and myeloproliferative neoplasm. However, in 25%
of patients, no aetiological factors for the thrombosis are identified despite an active search.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of chronic PVT is based on the findings of Doppler
ultrasound and axial CT or MR imaging using vascular contrast
agents. Diagnosis is based on the absence of blood flow into
portal vein and on the presence of numerous, serpiginous vascular
channels in porta hepatis corresponding to portal cavernoma
[22–24]. Once a portal cavernoma is identified at Doppler ultrasound, a CT scan or MR should be performed to more accurately
define the extension of the thrombosis and the identification of
signs of portal hypertension. Moreover, other less specific features
of the disease are the presence of a dysmorphic liver where segment 1 and segment 4 are enlarged but surface is smooth; a
mosaic pattern of parenchymal enhancement in the arterial phase,
with homogeneous enhancement at a later phase; an increased
enhancement of the peripheral parts of the liver at the arterial
phase; a dilated hepatic artery; and a mild irregular dilatation of
intra- and extrahepatic bile secondary to the compression by the
collateral veins constituting the cavernoma (portal biliopathy).
MR imaging cholangiography is the choice imaging for the diagnosis of portal biliopathy [25]. As further consequence, both the
gallbladder and pancreas may appear with thickened and heterogenous wall that should be differentiated from cholecystitis and
pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis, respectively.
Laboratory findings include a mild or absent liver dysfunction with normal levels of transaminases. These findings typically contrast with the severity of signs of portal hypertension. Alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase
may be altered in the presence of portal biliopathy.
In cases of pure portal vein thrombosis, liver biopsy shows an
essentially normal liver, and it is actually not indicated unless in
the presence of persistently abnormal liver tests, of a dysmorphic
liver or of abnormal results of liver elastometry in the suspicion
of an underlying liver disease (cirrhosis and PSVD) [18, 26, 27].
Non-invasive tests like elastometry would be most useful
in recognizing underlying liver disease [9, 15, 28].

Natural History and Management
General Management
Both in patients with PSVD and chronic PVT, the outcome is
mostly determined by age and the course of the underlying
disease. Therefore, the first step for the management of these
patients is the early detection and treatment of the diseases
known to be associated to PSVD and PVT (i.e. HIV infection,
immunodeficiency, haematological disorders).
Natural history of PSVD without portal hypertension is not
known [4••]. Probably a proportion of the patients with histological lesions will never develop portal hypertension.
However, as previously exposed, it has been reported that a
percentage of patients with histological PSVD developed
signs of portal hypertension during follow-up [5]. Hence, to
date, it is not clear what is the appropriate follow-up and
management of this kind of patients. Probably, a clinical, radiological and endoscopic follow-up is considerable at least to
early detect the development of signs of portal hypertension.
Natural history of patients with portal hypertension due to
PSVD or chronic PVT is better known, and it is mainly characterized by the complications of portal hypertension itself.
Oesophageal Varices and Variceal Bleeding
The main complication of the diseases is the gastrointestinal
bleeding from the rupture of oesophago-gastric varices. This
complication is highly frequent both in patients receiving and
not receiving a treatment for the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. It has been reported [8••] that the incidence of variceal
bleeding as well as the rate of development of varices at risk of
bleeding is higher than in patients with cirrhosis independently on the size of varices at the first endoscopy. The observation
of a more rapidly progression of varices in this kind of patients
should probably suggest the necessity of a different timing of
the endoscopical follow-up, maybe closer than in cirrhosis.
Nevertheless, in the absence of large prospective and cooperative studies in patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension,
current guidelines on vascular liver diseases suggest to manage this complication according to the guidelines of cirrhotic
portal hypertension [18, 20].
Regarding the type of prophylaxis, one study compared endoscopic variceal ligation versus endoscopic variceal ligation
plus non-selective beta-blockers for the primary prophylaxis
[29], and two studies did the same comparison in the setting
of secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding [29, 30] in patients with PSVD. All these studies did not provide solid conclusions due to the very small number of patients included.
Therefore, by extrapolating the recommendations for cirrhosis,
non-specific beta-adrenergic blockade or endoscopic band ligation is used for primary prophylaxis and their combination for
secondary prophylaxis in patients with NCPH [18–20].
Transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) is
to consider a valid option for the patients with variceal
bleeding not controlled by medical and endoscopical treatment. In this setting, the results are favourable in patients
with PSVD [31]. In fact, an international multicenter retrospective study showed an 80% 2-year survival in patients
with PSVD treated with TIPS [32]. Also, in patients with
chronic PVT, TIPS is a considerable option but not always
feasible due to the technical challenge of inserting a vascular prosthesis into the cavernomatous veins which may
compromise medium-term patency and efficacy of the
stent [33, 34]. Another possible indication to the use of
TIPS is to allow a lifelong anticoagulation therapy in selected patients with chronic PVT and high-risk varices.
However, these patients should be referred to selected units
with large experience in TIPS placement.
Finally, mortality due to variceal bleeding is significantly
lower than that observed in cirrhotic patients, likely because of
a preserved liver function, about 3% at 6 weeks [6, 8••, 35].
Ascites, Hepatic Encephalopathy and Other
Complications
Ascites is not a frequent complication of PSVD, and it usually
occurs during decompensating events such as infections or
variceal bleeding. In patients with chronic PVT, ascites is
probably even more infrequent and may develop with increasing age, prolonged duration of disease and development of
portal biliopathy, and such patients generally have reduced
hepatic cell mass and synthetic dysfunction [36].
Indeed, in the absence of solid studies, the management of
ascites is the same of cirrhotic patients. TIPS placement represents an option for PSVD patients with refractory ascites. In
this setting, the outcomes may be less favourable than in patients with variceal bleeding because the presence of severe
comorbidities and of renal impairment (creatinine ≥ 1.13 mg/
dL) has been associated with a poor survival after TIPS [32].
Hepatic encephalopathy, both overt and minimal, is a complication much less frequent than in cirrhosis, but it has been
reported to occur in 32% of patients with NCPH [37, 38]. The
development of HE in these patients is strictly related to the
presence of large porto-systemic shunt either spontaneous or
iatrogenic (type B HE). In fact, in the series of PSVD patients
undergoing to TIPS, the 31% of patients developed this condition following the stent’s placement. In most cases, it was
transient and easily managed with medical treatment [32].
Contrarily to cirrhosis, the risk of developing a hepatocellular carcinoma is very low, and only two cases have been
reported to date in patients with NCPH. On the contrary,
hypervascular benign lesions sharing the features of FNHlike lesions were seen in 14% of patients with PSVD and
not in patients with cirrhosis in a French’ series [12], and they
are a common finding also in patients with chronic PVT [39].
Curr Gastroenterol Rep (2020) 22: 56 Page 5 of 8 56

These lesions are the consequence of the haemodynamic alterations proper to the disorders, and when they are observed
in PSVD patients with morphologic liver changes similar to
those of cirrhosis, they are very difficult to distinguish from
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Moreover a recent study [40] reported that in patients with
NCPH, the prevalence of sarcopenia, a common complication
of cirrhosis, studied by CT scan, was similar (36%) to those
observed in cirrhotic patients and that it had a clinical negative
impact on the natural history of the disease being the main
predictor of refractory variceal bleeding independently on
well-known predictors of portal hypertension severity such
as the variceal size and use of beta blockers.
Finally, the evolution to progressive liver failure is rare but
possible, and it represents an indication to liver transplantation
in patients with PSVD together with the presence of intractable complications of portal hypertension [35, 41]. The number
of reported transplants in patients with PSVD is very low and
includes patients diagnosed after evaluating the explant in
patients with presumed cryptogenic cirrhosis [41]. There are
reported outcome recurrences of PSVD after liver transplantation [42, 43].
Overall outcome is relatively good both in patients with
NCPH. Five-year survival rates above 70% have been reported in large cohorts spanning over the last 20 years for patients
with chronic PVT [44–46], and 10-year survival rates above
56–82% have been reported for patients with PSVD [35].
Portal Vein Thrombosis and Anticoagulants
Porto-Sinusoidal Vascular Disease (PSVD)
The other main complication of PSVD is represented by extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. This event occurs in 30–
40% of patients, with an incidence much higher than in patient
with cirrhosis [6, 8••]. This higher incidence is sustained by
the strong association between PSVD, prothrombotic conditions and the slowing down of the blood flow in the portal vein
axis secondary to portal hypertension.
For an early detection of portal vein thrombosis, current
guidelines [18] suggest to perform Doppler ultrasonography
every 6 months even if no literature supporting this practice
exists until now.
Nevertheless, a prophylactic treatment with anticoagulants
is not recommended at this time, and long-term
anticoagulation should be considered when an underlying
prothrombotic disorder is diagnosed, and it is strongly suggested in patients who develop portal vein thrombosis [18, 20]
even if no studies demonstrated a clinical negative impact of
PVT on the natural history of the disease. However, in these
cases, anticoagulation should be carried on long life because
re-thrombosis is frequent at the withdrawal of the therapy.
Furthermore, in the future, it would be interesting to evaluate if the use of anticoagulants may play a role in the prevention of the progression to clinically evident portal hypertension in patients with histological signs of PSVD without portal
hypertension.
Chronic Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT)
In patients with portal cavernoma, the aim of anticoagulant
treatment is not to achieve the recanalization of the portal vein
axis as in acute portal vein thrombosis, but it is represented by
the prevention of the thrombotic extension and recurrence in
the splanchnic area. However, the indications for permanent
anticoagulation are still unclear. The discussion on a case-bycase basis should take into account the thrombotic potential of
the underlying conditions and the extension of the thrombus to
the superior mesenteric vein [47, 48]. In fact, at present, patients
with cavernoma with the poorest outcomes usually have involvement of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins.
Therefore, current guidelines suggest to consider long-term
anticoagulation surely in the presence of persistent
prothrombotic conditions and in patients with history of intestinal ischemia or abdominal pain. Uncertainty remains on the
indication of anticoagulation in patients without strong
prothrombotic conditions. The indication to the therapy
should also take into consideration the risk-benefit ratio of
anticoagulation in patients with portal hypertension even if it
has been reported that the risk of bleeding is not increased in
patients under anticoagulants when an adequate prophylaxis
for bleeding is performed [44–46]. Moreover, the severity of
bleeding is not increased by anticoagulation [42] that, on the
contrary, seems to have a favourable impact on survival in
these patients [49].
Regarding the type of anticoagulation for both patients
with chronic PVT and PSVD, the most commonly used are
heparin (un-fractioned heparin (UFH) and low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH)) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA).
There are few data on the use of direct oral anticoagulants
(DOACs) in patients with PSVD and non-cirrhotic portal vein
thrombosis. The use of DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban and
dabigatran) has been evaluated in splanchnic vein thrombosis,
but no solid conclusions can be made especially on the type
and dosage of the agent and on the adverse events’ monitoring/management. Based on the limited data, it is safe to only
conclude that the use of DOACs in patients with portal hypertension is feasible and that it does not increase the
haemorrhagic risk, but it should remain an individual option
[50•, 51, 52].
