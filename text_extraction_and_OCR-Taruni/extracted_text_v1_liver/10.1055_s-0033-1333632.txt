Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex and heterogeneous malignancy that arises in the context of progressive
underlying liver dysfunction. Given the asymptomatic nature
of early disease and the limited use of surveillance, the
majority of HCC cases present at advanced or incurable stages.
The prognosis of advanced-stage HCC is poor, with an overall
survival (OS) rate of < 5%,1 and in earlier stages, 5-year
recurrence rates of over 70% have been reported despite
surgical or locoregional therapies.2–4 The treatment options
for patients with recurrent or de novo advanced HCC are
limited, and until recently there were no systemic treatment
options that provided a clear survival benefit for these
patients. Systemic chemotherapy and hormone therapies
have not been effective in HCC, partly owing to the inherent
hepatic dysfunction and the chemoresistance of the tumor.5,6
However, in the last decade, a better understanding of the
molecular pathogenesis of HCC has led to the evaluation of
molecular targeted therapies in this setting. Although the
exact molecular mechanisms for hepatocarcinogenesis have
still not been defined, angiogenesis has been found to have an
integral role in HCC pathogenesis, making this a rational
therapeutic target in this disease.
Sorafenib is an antiangiogenic multikinase inhibitor that
targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor
receptor- (PDGFR-) β, RAF kinase, and stem cell factor receptor (c-kit). It was the first systemic therapy to demonstrate a
significant improvement in OS in patients with advanced
HCC. Two positive pivotal phase III trials (the Sorafenib HCC
Assessment Randomized Protocol [SHARP] trial and the AsiaPacific trial), and its subsequent approval represent a major
breakthrough in the treatment of advanced HCC.7,8 However,

Abstract Treatment of advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge
because of the complex nature of the disease and the lack of available therapies. The
antiangiogenic multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first therapy to demonstrate a
significant overall survival benefit in advanced HCC. However, new agents for both firstand second-line treatment of advanced HCC are needed. The multiple pathways
involved in HCC oncogenesis, proliferation, and survival provide many opportunities
for the development of molecularly targeted therapies. Many novel agents are under
investigation in phase III trials in advanced HCC, including antiangiogenic multikinase
inhibitors (e.g., brivanib, sunitinib, linifanib) and inhibitors of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (e.g., everolimus). Although these therapies have demonstrated some utility as single agents in advanced HCC, rational combinations of
therapies are likely to provide greater success. Current research efforts are directed
at combining agents targeting different molecular pathways (e.g., sorafenib in combination with erlotinib) and combining molecularly targeted agents with systemic
chemotherapy or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Therapies targeting other
molecular pathways in HCC are in early development; future research will focus on
discovering additional targets for therapy and identifying biomarkers that predict the
success of current therapies.

given the limitations of sorafenib therapy, such as resistance
and tolerability, there are still unmet medical needs in the
treatment of HCC. Our knowledge of the diverse etiologies
and the genetic heterogeneity of HCC and the multiple
molecular pathways implicated in HCC pathogenesis are
now being evaluated as potential targets for therapeutic
interventions, including the VEGF, fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), PDGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. This
review will examine our current understanding of these
pathways, the efficacy and safety data pertaining to the
most promising targeted agents beyond sorafenib, and novel
treatment combinations in clinical testing for HCC. There are
many other novel agents and targets in development, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC), c-Met inhibitors,
MEK kinase inhibitors, insulin-like growth factor receptor
(IGFR), arginine deiminase, and the anti-VEGF monoclonal
antibody bevacizumab. In this article, we will focus on those
agents currently in advanced phase III trials.
Signaling Pathways Involved in HCC
Pathogenesis
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly vascularized tumor, and
the central role of angiogenesis in its initiation, growth, and
subsequent dissemination to other tissues is well recognized.
Angiogenesis in HCC is dependent on endothelial cell activation, proliferation, and migration, which occur in response to
angiogenic cues (e.g., hypoxia and inflammation) and involves several molecular effectors such as growth factors,
extracellular matrix proteins, and proteases.9,10 Vascular
endothelial growth factor and its receptors are known to be
key mediators of HCC neovascularization, primarily through
their stimulation of endothelial cell growth and induction of
vascular permeability.9,10 Supporting the major role of VEGF
in hepatocarcinogenesis are reports of its increased expression from low-grade to high-grade dysplastic nodules to early
HCC, which correlates directly with increased neoangiogenesis and cell proliferation activity.11 Additionally, high serum
levels of VEGF have been shown to significantly correlate with
advanced tumor stage, recurrence of HCC following resection,
and presence of intrahepatic metastasis and venous invasion.12 Overexpression of VEGF and its receptors in tumor
tissue is also reportedly associated with worse OS and recurrence-free survival after surgical resection.13–15 Similarly, a
prospective study showed that pretreatment serum elevations in VEGF were associated with progressive disease and
poor survival in patients with inoperable HCC who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment.16
In addition to the VEGF pathway, FGF and its family of
receptors have been implicated also in augmenting HCC
growth, invasion, and angiogenesis, making it an attractive
candidate for therapeutic intervention.17 Activation of the
FGF pathway induces neovascularization through various
mechanisms, including stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary formation.18,19
Increased serum levels of FGF and concomitant activation
of FGF receptors are associated with tumor invasion and
recurrence, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis in
HCC.20,21 Synergistic interactions between FGF and
VEGF have been shown to drive HCC development and
angiogenesis.22,23 Compelling evidence indicates that induction of the FGF signaling pathways might represent a
resistance mechanism to the antiangiogenic effects of
VEGF-targeted agents in HCC.23,24 In addition, alterations in
ligand expression has been identified as a potential driver in
HCC.25 Together, these data indicate that concomitant inhibition of both the VEGF and FGF pathways might be more
efficient at controlling disease and overcoming resistance to
anti-VEGF therapies than targeting either factor alone.
Several other signaling pathways have been shown to be
involved in HCC pathogenesis; the most studied are the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR, EGFR, Ras/
Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and IGFR pathways.26 The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a major intracellular
signaling cascade that is involved in the regulation of cell
growth, proliferation, and survival.27 Mammalian target of
rapamycin is a potent inducer of angiogenesis through
upregulation of the hypoxia-induced gene HIF1-α.
28 The
mTOR pathway mediates its effects through activation of
various tyrosine kinase receptors, such as VEGFR, EGFR,
PDGFR, and IGFR.29 Nearly 50% of patients with HCC have
shown activation of the mTOR pathway, which may be
partially attributable to activation signals from receptor
tyrosine kinases such as IGFR and/or EGFR pathways.30
The activation of the mTOR pathway in HCC is associated
with aggressive tumor behavior and decreased survival,
supporting efforts to target this pathway for therapeutic
interventions.31 The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is
another important intracellular pathway. Ras activation and
subsequent downstream signaling may be mediated by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. As Raf is a potential target for
sorafenib, this observation may be another explanation for
sorafenib’s clinical activity in HCC.32,33 In addition, the aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway may also play a role in HCC
pathogenesis and is another potential target in HCC.34
cMET is a tyrosine kinase receptor, with its ligand
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), that has been implicated
in liver cancer. Most recently, randomized phase II data of
the cMET inhibitor, tivantinib, has demonstrated activity in
a subset of patients with advanced HCC that have progressed on sorafenib and had elevated expression of cMET
by immunohistochemistry.35
There has been considerable interest in targeting peptide
growth factor signaling via the EGFR and IGFR axis, which is
suggested by elevated levels of these receptors in HCC.36,37
The increasing awareness of the association of insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) in the development of cirrhosis and HCC also is
evidence that the IGFR pathway might have a causal role in
this process.38 Given the molecular heterogeneity of HCC, the
challenge is identifying in which patients any given alteration
is critical. It is unlikely that any of these targeted agents will
yield clinical success without selecting the patients whose
tumors are most dependent on these pathways and therefore

most likely to benefit, and the identification of predictive
markers of response is essential for successful development of
new targeted agents.
Emerging Molecular Therapies in Phase III
Development
There are currently a historic number of investigational
agents being tested in HCC, most of which are targeting the
previously described VEGF axis, FGF, EGFR, and mTOR signaling pathways (►Fig. 1).39 The most recent clinical data
relating to these novel agents, their combinations, and ongoing trials are outlined in ►Tables 1 and 2.
35,40–65
Sunitinib
Similar to sorafenib, sunitinib is an oral, multitargeted
inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, such as VEGF-receptors, PDGFR, and c-KIT, which are involved in regulation of
tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic invasion. Sunitinib showed promising antitumor activity in phase II
HCC studies, though there were significant toxicities seen,
such as bone marrow suppression and a small number of
grade 5 events.40,66 In addition, no one consistent dosing
scheme was used in these studies. With this in mind, it
may not be surprising that a phase III study comparing
sunitinib to sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC was
terminated early due to higher incidence of drug-related
serious adverse events and failure to demonstrate noninferiority of OS benefit (median OS in the intent-to-treat
population: 7.9 months vs 10.2 months; hazard ratio
[HR] ¼ 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99–1.30;
p ¼ 0.001).41 In an exploratory analysis, sorafenib substantially improved median OS in comparison to sunitinib in
patients with HCV infection (17.6 months vs 9.2 months;
HR ¼ 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09–2.13; p ¼ 0.0165), whereas in
patients with HBV infection, both agents were equally
effective (8.0 months vs 7.6 months; HR ¼1.10; 95% CI,
0.92–1.33; p ¼ 0.1714).41 Further analyses of this dataset
are ongoing, but the increased toxicity profile of sunitinib
as compared with sorafenib likely played an important role
in the results.
Brivanib
Brivanib is a selective dual inhibitor of the FGF and VEGF
receptors that is currently in late-stage clinical development.
In preclinical models, brivanib was shown to decrease tumor
growth and neovascularization, induce apoptosis, and decrease tumor cell proliferation.67 Brivanib entered several
phase III studies including testing in patients with HCC in both
the first-line and second-line settings.42,68 An initial phase II
open-label study evaluated brivanib monotherapy in two
patient cohorts with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic HCC; 55 patients received brivanib as first-line therapy
and 46 patients received brivanib as second-line therapy
(having received one prior regimen of antiangiogenic
therapy). Patients that received first-line brivanib therapy
had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.7 months
and a median OS of 10 months (►Table 1).42 The disease
control rate was 47%, including a complete response in
1 patient and partial responses in 3 patients; 22 patients
achieved disease stabilization. As second-line therapy, brivanib therapy resulted in a tumor response rate of 4.3% (all
partial responses) and a disease control rate of 45.7%. Median
OS was 9.8 months and the median time to progression (TTP)
was 2.7 months.68 Most common grade 3/4 adverse events
(AEs) were fatigue and hypertension, which were experienced by < 17% of patients, while only < 2% experienced
grade 3 hand–foot skin reactions.42,68

The promising results from the phase II study prompted the
BRISK (Brivanib Study in Patients at Risk) HCC program that
includes four large randomized phase III trials, three of which
evaluate the role of brivanib in advanced HCC (BRISK-FL, BRISKPS, and BRISK-APS).55–57 The BRISK-PS trial evaluated brivanib
versus placebo in 395 patients with Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh
B HCC for which prior sorafenib therapy had failed or whowere
intolerant to prior sorafenib therapy (NCT00825955). Although
this study did not meet its primary end point of improving OS
(9.4 months vs 8.2 months; HR ¼ 0.89; 95.8% CI, 0.69–1.15;
p ¼ 0.3307), treatment with brivanib resulted in improvements in TTP (4.2 months vs 2.7 months; HR ¼ 0.56; 95% CI,
0.42–0.78; p ¼ 0.0001) and response rate (12% vs 2%; odds
ratio ¼ 5.75; 95% CI, 1.40–23.62; p ¼ 0.0032), which were
secondary end points of the study.43 The toxicity profile of
brivanib and median survival for the brivanib group were very
similar to that seen in the phase II study in this population.
What was surprising and unexpected in BRISK-PS was the
median OS of 8.2 months in the control arm. This survival
would not be expected based on data from the SHARP or AsiaPacific sorafenib studies. Although there were some baseline
imbalances in the 2:1 randomized study that favored the
control arm (significantly fewer patients with portal vein
invasion versus the treatment group, 12% vs 25%, respectively),
this number also reflects the changing natural history of HCC in
the postsorafenib era. Similar to the BRISK-PS study, the BRISKAPS trial is evaluating second-line brivanib in 252 patients of
exclusively Asian ethnicity (NCT01108705).57 The BRISK-FL
trial (NCT00858871) was directly comparing the clinical outcomes of brivanib versus sorafenib in 1050 patients with
advanced HCC who received no prior systemic therapy.55
According to a July 2012 press release, this study did not
meet its primary end point of OS.56
Linifanib
Linifanib is a potent multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor that selectively blocks the activity of the VEGFR and
PDGFR families. Preclinical evidence indicates that linifanib
inhibits tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeability in HCC
experimental models.69 A phase II study was conducted in 44
patients with Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B liver disease to
evaluate linifanib activity in advanced HCC in the first-line
and second-line settings.44 Thirty-four percent of patients
with Child-Pugh A liver function remained progression-free

at 16 weeks, with median TTP and OS of 5.4 months and 9.7
months, respectively. Overall survival was comparable to the
results achieved in the SHARP study (median OS: 10.7
months).8 The most common grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension (18%), fatigue (14%), and diarrhea (4.5%). Based on these
results, an ongoing randomized phase III study is investigating linifanib as first-line therapy in > 1000 patients with
Child-Pugh A advanced HCC (NCT01009593).54 Although
final results are pending, this study was recently terminated
by the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC).
Ramucirumab
Ramucirumab is a recombinant humanized antibody that
specifically targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR2. In a
phase II study of 42 patients with unresectable HCC who
primarily presented with Child-Pugh A disease (74%) and
Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C (83%), first-line
ramucirumab therapy resulted in a disease control rate of
69%.49 The median OS for all patients was 14.9 months, and in
patients with BCLC C/Child-Pugh A and BCLC C/Child-Pugh B
HCC, it was 18.0 months and 4.4 months, respectively. Grade
3/4 toxicities included gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, and fatigue. These results may indicate a signal of
activity for ramucirumab in the front-line setting, though
this was a relatively small population of clinically heterogeneous patients. Despite no clinical data supporting ramucirumab’s activity in patients with HCC who have progressed on
sorafenib, an ongoing randomized placebo-controlled phase
III study (REACH) is evaluating second-line ramucirumab in
comparison to best supportive care (BSC) following failure of
prior sorafenib therapy in patients with Child-Pugh score <7
(NCT01140347).59

Everolimus
Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, such as everolimus, have demonstrated antitumor activity in several
malignancies. In HCC, two early clinical studies have shown
that everolimus monotherapy was tolerable and had activity
in patients who had received prior systemic therapy.50,70
Grade 3/4 AEs included lymphopenia, elevations in aspartate
transaminase, and hyponatremia. In both studies, the median
PFS and OS were 3.8 months and 8.4 months, respectively.
Though both studies were single-arm and uncontrolled, their
results suggested a potential clinical benefit with everolimus
in both patients who had received prior sorafenib therapy and
those who did not. An ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial (EVOLVE-1) is evaluating everolimus plus BSC in patients with Child-Pugh A HCC pretreated
with sorafenib (NCT01035229).58
ADI-PEG 20
ADI-PEG 20 is arginine deiminase (ADI) formulated with
polyethylene glycol (PEG). Its potential as an anticancer agent
is based on the hypothesis that HCC is deficient in argininosuccinate synthase and is, therefore, not capable of synthesizing arginine, and the relative arginine deficiency resulting
from ADI is toxic to cancer cells. A randomized study comparing two doses of ADI-PEG-20 was performed in a heterogeneous population of patients.51 Median survival for all
patients in this study was 15.8 months and the most common
events in this study related to the drug include transient and
reversible encephalopathy, skin irritation, or discomfort at
the site of injection combined with low-grade fever. A phase
III study of ADI-PEG-20 versus placebo in the second-line
setting is ongoing (NCT01287585).60
Combination Strategies
Although single-agent therapy has demonstrated some success
in the treatment of HCC, intensive research is now focused on
enhancing the clinical benefit of many therapies through
combination with other agents. The biologic rationale for
combination approaches might involve targeting the same
pathway at different points to achieve complete blockade of
a given pathway or interrupting two different pathways simultaneously in hopes of circumventing feedback loops.
Based on potential interplay between angiogenesis and
the EGFR signaling pathways, strategies targeting the VEGF
and EGFR axis are being evaluated. In a single-arm, singleinstitution, phase II study of 40 patients with advanced HCC,
erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination therapy was associated with a 16-week PFS of 62.5%, median PFS of 9.0 months,
and median OS of 15.65 months.71 Treatment-related grade
3/4 toxicities were mostly reminiscent of those related to
bevacizumab. Despite the lack of similar data with sorafenib
and erlotinib, a large phase III study evaluating the combination was launched. However, recently presented results of the
SEARCH trial (NCT00901901) demonstrated that the addition
of erlotinib to sorafenib did not prolong OS (HR ¼ 0.929;
p ¼ 0.204), which was the primary end point of the study.47 A
phase I study evaluating the combination of everolimus and
sorafenib as front-line therapy in advanced HCC did not move
on to phase II development because of unexpected toxicity
(thrombocytopenia), which prevented dose escalation of the
mTOR inhibitor.72
Although the role of chemotherapy has not been defined in
HCC, several strategies combining targeted and cytotoxic
agents are being evaluated. In a randomized phase II trial of
96 patients with advanced HCC, most of whom had ChildPugh A liver disease, the combination of sorafenib plus
doxorubicin as first-line therapy yielded a significant improvement in median OS, from 6.5 months to 13.7 months
(HR ¼ 0.49; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8; p ¼ 0.006), and prolonged PFS
(6.0 months vs 2.7 months; 95% CI, 1.4–2.8; p ¼ 0.006)
compared with doxorubicin alone. Though this study was
launched prior to the results of the SHARP study, given
sorafenib’s proven single-agent activity, the more appropriate control arm would have been sorafenib alone, not doxorubicin. Toxicity profiles were similar to those observed with
single agents; however, the combination of sorafenib/doxorubicin increased bone marrow suppression and all grade left
ventricular dysfunction (19% vs 2%, respectively).73 Nevertheless, these results have led to an ongoing Cancer and
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase III trial evaluating the
superiority of sorafenib plus doxorubicin versus current
standard of care, sorafenib, in a 480 patients with locally
advanced or metastatic HCC (NCT01015833).74 Several single-arm studies combining bevacizumab with cytotoxic
agents, including capecitabine, oxaliplatin/capecitabine, and
gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, have shown modest clinical activity;
however, bevacizumab-based combinations are not being
pursued further in phase III studies at this time.75–77
As previously discussed in this supplement, surgical
resection and local ablation are curative therapies for
early-stage HCC, whereas TACE is the backbone of the
management of patients with intermediate-stage HCC. Preclinical evidence indicates that TACE increases tumor hypoxic conditions, which then may elicit upregulation of
proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF and FGF, and ultimately
stimulate angiogenesis.78,79 It was found that patients with
lower plasma VEGF levels following TACE have significantly
longer survival compared with those with higher levels
following TACE (p ¼ 0.008).80 Taken together, these results
suggest that coadministration of an antiangiogenic agents
with TACE may block angiogenesis and prevent local recurrence and potentially distant metastasis. Several ongoing
clinical trials are testing different combinations of TACE (or
other locoregional therapies) and antiangiogenic agents. In
a single-center phase II trial, combining TACE with doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and sorafenib showed
promising efficacy with a disease control rate of 95% and
objective response of 58%.81 Toxicity was manageable and
mostly related to sorafenib; however, the authors noted
increased liver toxicity. Recently presented preliminary
efficacy results from the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II SPACE trial (Sorafenib or Placebo in
Combination with TACE) are less impressive. This trial of
307 patients with intermediate-stage HCC randomized patients to a combination of DEB-TACE/sorafenib or DEB-TACE/
placebo and showed a trend toward better objective

response (35.7% vs 28.1%), but did not significantly delay
progression with sorafenib (TTP; HR ¼ 0.797; 95% CI, 0.588–
1.080; p ¼ 0.072).82 A similar phase III study of sorafenib in
combination with TACE versus TACE alone performed in
Japan and Korea likewise did not demonstrate any benefit
with the combination.83 This approach is being further
evaluated in two ongoing phase III trials (NCT01004978
and NCT01324076).62,63 Another important phase III trial in
this population—with the primary end point of improving
OS—BRISK-TA is investigating brivanib versus placebo as
adjuvant therapy following TACE in 870 patients with
intermediate HCC (NCT00908752).64 TSU-68 (orantinib) is
an oral small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR
also currently being evaluated in phase III study in combination with TACE vs TACE alone (NCT01465464).65
Conclusion
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, both in
regard to its clinical manifestation with underlying liver
disease, and its complex pathogenesis involving aberrant
signaling in several molecular pathways. The introduction
of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC saw a paradigm
shift in its management. Based on new molecular knowledge
and recognition of the limitations of sorafenib, novel molecular targeted therapies and combination strategies have been
developed. Although early phase data with these agents have
looked promising, to date nothing has been shown to be
better than sorafenib in the front-line, and studies in the
second-line have been disappointing. Looking ahead, concerted research efforts must be focused, not only on identifying new molecular targets and therapeutic agents, but also on
understanding mechanisms of resistance to targeted agents.
In addition to a better understanding of the natural history of
HCC in the postsorafenib era, additional studies aimed at
identifying predictive markers for response to novel agents
are necessary. Incorporating these new agents into the presurgical or adjuvant setting also gives the opportunity for
tissue collection and correlative science that is pivotal for
increasing our understanding of these agents in HCC. Finally,
the best method of assessing the activity of molecular targeted agents in HCC remains to be determined.
