Acute heart failure after Orthotopic liver
transplantation: a case series from one
center
Sonal Sharma1, Kunal Karamchandani1, Ryan Wilson2, Sean Baskin1 and Dmitri Bezinover1*
Abstract
Background: Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) can develop acute heart failure (HF) in the
postoperative period despite having had a normal cardiac evaluation prior to surgery. End-stage liver disease is
often associated with underlying cardiac dysfunction which, while not identified during preoperative testing,
manifests itself during or immediately after surgery.
Case presentation: We describe three cases of non-ischemic acute HF developing shortly after LT in patients who
had a normal preoperative cardiac evaluation. The challenges associated with both diagnosis and management of
acute HF in the setting of a newly implanted graft will be discussed.
Conclusions: Diastolic dysfunction, QTc interval prolongation, and an increase in BNP may be predictive of
postoperative HF. Current recommendations for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation of transplant candidates
does not include studies examining these risk factors and should be revised. Further investigations are necessary to
evaluate these findings.

Background
Acute heart failure (HF) after liver transplantation (LT)
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1].
The etiology of HF in these patients is poorly understood. Despite extensive pre-operative cardiac evaluation, patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) can
have underlying cardiac dysfunction which is not identified during preoperative cardiac testing. There are a
number of specific cardiac conditions associated with
ESLD that can lead to acute cardiac deterioration in the
immediate postoperative period.
We report a series of three cases of acute HF after LT.
Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was normal in all
three patients before transplantation but deteriorated
dramatically in the immediate postoperative period after
an uneventful surgical procedure. Our experience with
these cases emphasizes the ambiguity associated with
normal preoperative cardiac testing in LT candidates.
Perioperative cardiac dysfunction specifically related to
LT should be the subject of intensive investigation.
Case descriptions
In all cases presented, patients received standardized intraoperative anesthetic management consistent with institutional protocol. After establishing noninvasive
monitoring, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl. Cisatracurium was used for muscle relaxation. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was
maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl, and a continuous infusion of cisatracurium.
In addition to routine non-invasive monitors, bilateral
radial arterial lines and a right internal jugular vein 9
French multi access catheter were placed. TEE was routinely used. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not
used routinely in our institution unless indicated by specific pathology. None of the patients in this series were
monitored with a PAC.

Case 1
A 54-year-old male, with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis
and a calculated Model for End- stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score of 28, presented for deceased donor LT.
ESLD was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and esophageal varices. A preoperative transthoracic
echocardiogram (TTE) performed 10 months before
transplantation demonstrated normal size and systolic
function of both ventricles (RV and LV), no valvular or
regional wall motion abnormalities, normal pulmonary
artery pressures, and a left ventricular ejection fraction
(EF) of 65%. The TTE did, however, demonstrate
bi-atrial dilatation, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction
with an E/A ratio of 0.9, a deceleration time (DT) of
278 ms, and tissue Doppler early diastolic velocities of
8 cm/s at the annulus and 12 cm/s at the septum indicating impaired relaxation. References for degree of diastolic dysfunction are provided in Table 1. A
dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE) was negative
for ischemia and an electrocardiogram (EKG) performed
at the same time as TTE demonstrated normal sinus
rhythm with a prolonged QTc interval of 476 ms.
Shortly after the beginning of pre-anhepatic phase,
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated an
EF of 40–45% with no wall motion abnormalities. The surgical procedure was complicated by blood loss of 5.5 l
with the patient receiving 3 L of crystalloids, 1 L of 5% albumin, 16 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 15 units of
packed red blood cells (PRBC), 3 units of platelet concentrate, and 3 units of cryoprecipitate. Despite the significant
blood loss and reduction in EF, hemodynamic stability was
maintained throughout the case with minimal vasopressor
support (norepinephrine (NE) infusion 0.02–0.05 mcg/kg/
min with intermittent boluses (10–20 mcg) during reperfusion). Hemodynamics and arterial blood gas data is presented in Table 2.
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit (SICU) for postoperative management in
stable condition.
In the SICU, the patient initially remained intubated
and sedated with propofol and fentanyl infusions titrated
to a Riker Sedation Score of 3–4. Weaning attempts
failed due to episodes of agitation and hypertension.
Despite a normal postoperative hepatic Doppler study
and both laboratory and clinical improvement in liver
function, the patient’s neurological status did not improve. A brain MRI performed on post-operative day
(POD) 3 was normal. On POD 5, the patient’s mental
status improved significantly and he was successfully
extubated. A few hours after extubation, however, the
patient complained of difficulty breathing and became
hypoxic with chest X-ray findings consistent with acute
pulmonary edema. This episode resolved with aggressive
diuresis and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
On POD 6, a similar episode occurred but was only
minimally responsive to escalating doses of diuretics and
CPAP.
TTE performed at that time demonstrated diffuse LV
hypokinesis, an EF of 25%, dilated left and right atria,
and a dilated RV with globally reduced function. EKG
demonstrated a prolonged QTc of 510 ms with no new
ST-T changes. Three sets of cardiac enzymes performed
4 h apart were negative. Later that day, the patient developed new onset atrial flutter with episodic arterial desaturation requiring re-intubation and mechanical
ventilation. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) was placed
and a dobutamine infusion was started with a goal to keep
the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg (PAC
data in presented in Table 3). Over the next few days, the
patient developed progressively worsening hypotension,
requiring escalating doses of vasopressors. Daily TTE
demonstrated continuing deterioration of cardiac function
with an EF as low as 10%. The patient’s renal function deteriorated and continuous renal replacement therapy
(CRRT) was begun.
Due to worsening cardiogenic shock, the patient was
placed on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) on POD 10. Despite ECMO support, the LV remained distended and globally

hypokinetic. An Impella® device (Abiomed, Danvers,
MA, USA) was placed to provide ventricular decompression. Over the course of the next few days, inotropic
support was weaned and TTE demonstrated decreased
LV dilation and an improvement in function (EF of
40%). The Impella® device was discontinued and a low
dose epinephrine infusion was started. The patient
tolerated a clamp trial and VA-ECMO was weaned. At
the same time, however, liver transaminases began to increase. Liver Doppler evaluation demonstrated thrombosis of the left portal vein and decreased flow in the
hepatic arteries. This was despite being maintained on a
heparin infusion with a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 50–60 s. His clinical condition

continued to deteriorate requiring an escalation of vasopressor support.
Postoperatively, this patient received 20 U PRBC (not
more than 2 U/day), 1 U of FFP (on POD 0), and 8 U of
platelets. Crystalloids were used as maintenance and
fluid management was directed using TTE. After extensive discussions with the family, care was withdrawn and
the patient expired on POD 31.
Case 2
A 47-year-old male, with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis
and a calculated MELD score of 39, presented for deceased donor LT. His ESLD was complicated by esophageal varices, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and SBP.
This patient’s abnormal laboratory studies included a
serum iron level of 144 mg/dl (normal range 49–
181 mg/dl), ferritin of 3670 ng/ml (normal range 17.9–
464 ng/ml), and iron saturation of 85% (normal range
20–55%). As a result of these abnormal lab results, genetic testing was performed to determine if there was any
genetic predisposition to hemochromatosis. Genetic testing did, in fact, reveal that the patient was heterozygous
for HFE (HFE-H63D) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (PiSZ),
predisposing him for hemochromatosis. Preoperative
TTE performed 2 months prior to LT demonstrated
mild left ventricular hypertrophy with an EF of 55%,
mild bi-atrial dilatation, and a dilated RV with normal
systolic function. There were no valvular abnormalities
and pulmonary arterial pressures were normal. In
addition, the TTE demonstrated some degree of diastolic
dysfunction (impaired relaxation) with an E/A ratio of
1.1, a DT of 228 ms, and tissue Doppler early diastolic
velocities of 6 cm/s at the annulus and 9 cm/s at the
septum. EKG demonstrated a prolonged QTc of 479 ms.
Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS) performed
3 weeks before LT demonstrated an EF of 54% with no
evidence of ischemia or infarction.
The surgical course was uneventful with an estimated
blood loss of 1.6 l. Intraoperatively, the patient received
5 units PRBC, 2 units of platelet concentrate, 1 L blood
from cell saver, 2000 mg of fibrinogen (RiaSTAP),
1000 units of prothrombin complex concentrate (Kcentra), and 1 L of crystalloid. Intraoperatively, this patient
required NE administration (0.02–0.08 mcg/kg/min with
0.2 mcg/kg/min for a short period of time during the
anhepatic phase). Hemodynamics and arterial blood gas
results are presented in Table 2. Intraoperative TEE
demonstrated normal cardiac function with an EF of
55% and no valvular abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the SICU for postoperative management where
he was extubated on POD 1.
On POD 4, the patient’s mental status decreased significantly and had an increasing oxygen requirement.
Auscultation of the lungs demonstrated wheezing in all
lung fields and chest X-ray findings were consistent with
acute pulmonary edema. TTE at that time demonstrated
a mildly dilated LV with diffuse hypokinesis and severely
reduced systolic function (EF 20%). The left atrium was
severely dilated and there was a moderate degree of mitral regurgitation. The RV was severely dilated and diffusely hypokinetic with reduced systolic function.
Troponins were mildly elevated (0.024 ng/ml (normal<
0.010 ng/ml)) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was
significantly elevated (7625 pg/ml (normal < 125 pg/ml)).
EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no ST-T
changes. The patient received aggressive diuresis along
with CPAP. A beta-blocker and heparin infusion was
started. Coronary angiography was performed which was
unremarkable.
Over the next few days, the patient’s cardiac function
remained unchanged (as assessed by serial bedside
TTEs), however, his hemodynamics continued to deteriorate. A PAC was placed and dobutamine and NE infusions started with a goal to keep the MAPs above
65 mmHg (please see PAC data in Table 4). After the administration of catecholamines, the patient continued to
deteriorate and was re-intubated. He also developed a
severe metabolic acidosis, supraventricular arrhythmias
requiring cardioversion, and acute renal failure requiring
CRRT. His liver function continued to deteriorate and
he became progressively encephalopathic. An abdominal
CT scan demonstrated a hepatic artery thrombosis. A
heparin infusion was started and titrated to target an
aPTT of 50–70 s. In view of a continued decline in cardiac and hepatic function, the decision was made to
withdraw care on POD 22.
Postoperatively, this patient received 5 U of PRBC and
2 U platelets. Cardiac function was evaluated by daily
TTE performed by a certified ICU physician. Fluid administration was also directed by TTE.
Microscopic examination of the explanted liver demonstrated signs of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (globules within hepatocytes) as well as very large amounts of
iron deposits within the hepatocytes; a sign of hereditary
hemochromatosis. Postmortem pathology demonstrated
an enlarged heart (490 g), RV hypertrophy, dilation of all
valves, and minimal atherosclerotic changes of the left
main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery,
and aorta. Microscopic examination of cardiac tissue
demonstrated stainable iron within both the myocytes
and cells of the conduction system.
Case 3
A 64-year-old male patient, with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with calculated
MELD score of 21, presented for a deceased donor LT.
His ESLD was complicated by recurrent ascites,
non-bleeding esophageal varices, portal hypertensive

gastropathy, and hepatic hydrothorax. His other medical
problems included a prior myocardial infarction (3 years
prior to LT) treated with a bare metal stent, Grave’s disease, and asthma. A TTE performed 3 months prior to
LT revealed a small LV cavity with normal systolic function (EF of 63%), no valvular or regional wall motion abnormalities, a small pericardial effusion, and normal
pulmonary artery pressures. The E/A ratio in this case
was 0.74 with a deceleration time of 289 ms. Tissue
Doppler early diastolic velocities were 8 cm/s at the annulus and 11 cm/s at the septum indicating impaired relaxation. Preoperative EKG demonstrated a prolonged
QTc of 467 ms. MPS performed 3 months before LT
demonstrated an unchanged fixed deficit in the
infero-lateral wall.
The patient’s surgical course was complicated by blood
loss of 5 l, primarily during the pre-anhepatic stage due to
significant adhesions from repeated paracentesis. He received 24 units of PRBC, 24 units of FFP, 3 units of platelet concentrate, 1000 mg of fibrinogen (RiaSTAP), and
4.5 L of crystalloid. Despite the significant blood loss,
hemodynamics was maintained within a normal range
with minimal vasopressor support (NE was administered
0.03–0.7 mcg/kg/min with 0.3 mcg/kg/min for a short
period of time during the anhepatic phase).
Hemodynamics and arterial blood gas analysis are presented in Table 2. Intraoperative TEE demonstrated an EF
of 65%. The patient was admitted to the SICU for postoperative management and was extubated on POD 1.
On POD 2, he developed acute respiratory distress
with hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%) and an increasing oxygen
requirement. Chest x-ray demonstrated acute pulmonary
edema with bilateral moderately sized pleural effusions.
TTE at this time revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle
with severely reduced systolic function (EF of 20%) and
diffuse hypokinesia. The RV was also dilated with reduced systolic function. Pulmonary artery pressures were
mildly elevated and there was no valvular dysfunction.
Other laboratory results obtained on the same day
demonstrated an elevated troponin (0.182 ng/ml) as well
as a markedly increased BNP (greater than 35,000 pg/ml).
EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged
QT of 488 ms. Troponins peaked at 0.463 on POD 3 and
then trended down. With aggressive diuresis and ventilator support, the episode resolved. Repeat TTE performed
3 days later demonstrated improving LV systolic function
(EF of 40%) and normalization of pulmonary artery pressures. The patient was discharged from intensive care on
POD 8, liver enzymes normalized by POD 13, and LV size
and function returned to normal (EF 55%) on POD 32.
Postoperatively, this patient received 1 U FFP on POD 6.
TTE was routinely performed to assess cardiac function
and direct fluid administration.
Discussion
We have described 3 cases of acute HF after LT presenting in the immediate postoperative period. Preoperative
cardiac evaluation was normal in all patients and, with
the exception of moderately large intraoperative blood
loss, each patient’s intraoperative course was uneventful.
One patient had a mildly reduced EF intraoperatively,
however, neither this patient nor the other two had any
significant hemodynamic alterations during surgery.
Post-operatively, all three patients developed acute HF
associated with biventricular dysfunction and dramatic
decreases in EF to about 20%. Two of the three patients
progressed to cardiogenic shock with multi-organ systemic failure and expired after maximal therapy. Only
one patient survived the acute episode.
These cases highlight the possibility that an unknown,
underlying cardiac condition was not identified by the
standard cardiac evaluation recommended for LT
candidates.
Despite US transplantation centers following the
guidelines for preoperative cardiac evaluation recommended by the American Association for the Study of
Liver Disease (AASLD) [2], up to 21% of all deaths after
LT are related to cardiac failure [3]. The overall

incidence of post-transplant HF has been reported to be
as high as 24% [4–6], with a reported mortality of up to
45% [1, 7]. Aside from negatively affecting a patient’s
overall prognosis, impaired cardiac function after LT is
also associated with the development of additional complications including acute kidney injury, life-threatening
arrhythmias, infections, and graft failure [8].
The etiology of acute HF after LT is not well understood. It is likely that HF presenting in the immediate
postoperative period, and HF remote from transplantation, have different origins.
The cause of HF in the immediate post-operative
period is likely multifactorial and can be directly related
to the patient, the graft, and surgical factors. Intraoperative management can also affect postoperative outcome.
ESLD itself is associated with significant changes in the
physiology of almost all organ systems. Patients with liver
failure are prone to hemodynamic instability due to profound vasodilatation related to both endotoxin release and
nitric oxide dysregulation [9, 10]. Despite these intrinsic
handicaps, LT candidates usually present well compensated and with stable preoperative hemodynamics, however, they may decompensate. Intraoperatively, however,
these patients frequently become hemodynamically unstable. LT itself is associated with acute changes in preload
as well as the release of cytokines and toxins that can lead
to acute decompensation in the form of post-reperfusion
or/and vasoplegic syndromes [11–15].
None of the patients in our series had any preoperative
findings that would have excluded them from transplantation. High quality grafts were used for all three cases and
the surgical procedure was, in general, uncomplicated.
There was no profound intraoperative hemodynamic instability. TEE was used to optimize intraoperative fluid
management; in particular, to avoid fluid overload.
While the exact cause of post-operative HF might be
unknown, there are a number of causes of ESLD that are
primarily associated with cardiac dysfunction and can be
broadly classified into ischemic and non-ischemic.
Ischemic causes of acute HF are relatively uncommon
in patients with ESLD. Because of the well-known association between coronary artery disease (CAD) and high
mortality rates in ESLD [16], a standard cardiac evaluation usually identifies patients with significant coronary
problems. A recent large multi-center retrospective
study performed by Wray, et al. has demonstrated that
LT performed in patients with CAD have better outcomes than previously estimated [17]. In our group of
patients, an ischemic etiology of HF was ruled out. Preoperative CAD testing was performed in all patients and
was negative. Patient 1 did not have any EKG changes or
troponin elevation, while patient 2 underwent cardiac
catheterization which did not show any signs of CAD.
Patient 3 had a history of ischemic heart disease with an
area of fixed defect on MPS but only developed a small
enzyme leak, with no EKG changes suggestive of ischemia, during the acute episode.
Non-ischemic causes include cardiomyopathy related
to hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, sepsis, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) and stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy
[18, 19]. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare condition
that can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It has been
previously described in patients undergoing LT [20].
This disorder can be associated with significant
hemodynamic instability, QTc interval prolongation, ST
segment elevation or depression, T-wave changes, and
increases in cardiac enzymes [21]. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with a typical echocardiographic
presentation that includes akinesis of the apical and distal anterior wall in combination with hyperkinesis of the
basal wall [22]. None of our patients had echocardiographic features consistent with this type of
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
Our patients did not demonstrate any clinical, laboratory or radiologic signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
HF can be the result of fluid overload. One of the reasons to use TEE for LT is to optimize fluid management.
Liver congestion due to fluid overload can lead to increases in portal pressure which result in graft dysfunction and coagulopathy. Transplanted graft also can be
affected by over-transfusion. Transfusion Related Lung
Injury (TRALI) and Transfusion Associated Circulatory
Overload (TACO) have been described in LT recipients
[23]. We used routinely TEE/TTE for the management
of all our cases and none of our patients had any signs
of TACO or TRALI. In addition, there was no indication
of fluid overload at any time during the intra- or postoperative management. Patients with these findings must
be managed very carefully with special attention to avoid
fluid overload. We believe the best way to achieve this is
with the routine use of TEE monitoring.
All three patients, however, had mild diastolic dysfunction as manifested by a low E/A ratio and prolonged deceleration time on their preoperative echocardiogram. In
each patient, there was preoperative prolongation of the
QTc interval, which increased significantly during the
acute episode. Both diastolic dysfunction and prolonged
QTc intervals > 450 ms have been associated with the
development of new-onset systolic heart failure after
liver transplantation [6, 7]. The etiology of diastolic dysfunction varied between patients, with one patient having cardiomyopathy related to hemochromatosis, and
the other two most likely having CCM.
Diagnosis of CCM is very challenging [24]. Standard
stress imaging, such as DSE (recommended by AASLD)
or MPS, is unable to fully evaluate the profound impact
Sharma et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:102 Page 6 of 8

of cirrhosis on myocardial integrity and reserve. There
are numerous reports of DSE not being able to accurately evaluate a blunted inotropic response to dobutamine in cirrhotic patients (one of the features of CCM),
yielding low negative predictive values because of the inability to reach the target peak double product [25]. Cardiac MRI and sophisticated imaging methods such as
strain and strain rate may identify subtle LV dysfunction
[26]. It is not routine practice to perform these imaging
techniques for all LT candidates, and the efficacy of this
test in patients with CCM is unclear. Dowsley, et al.
retrospectively demonstrated an association between
diastolic dysfunction and early postoperative HF in LT
recipients [4]. Other additional diagnostic indicators of
CCM include increased BNP levels to 400 pg/ml and
above [27], and elevations in high sensitivity troponin T
[28]. Although various retrospective studies have identified these features as risk factors for development of HF
after LT, there is no consensus on what next steps
should be taken with either preoperative assessment or
intraoperative management.
For patients with iron overload cardiomyopathy, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI)-derived T2 relaxation time is currently the mainstay for quantitative
assessment of myocardial iron deposition [29]. The elevated preoperative ferritin levels in one of our patients
was felt to be due to the large number of blood transfusions he received for variceal bleeding. Because of this, a
CMRI was not performed. Iron chelation therapy has
been effective in preventing the development of LV dysfunction and heart failure in patients with iron overload
[30]. It is unclear if chelation therapy would have been
helpful in our patient if myocardial iron deposits had
been identified before transplantation.
We recognize that not having a cardiac evaluation immediately before transplantation is a significant limitation in
this case series. The AASLD recommends an annual cardiac ultrasound for liver transplant candidates. Although
the majority of LT centers in the US base their guidelines
for preoperative evaluation on the AASLD recommendations, the timing of the preoperative cardiac ultrasound varies significantly. Unless a patient has a particular indication
to perform this examination more frequently, it should be
performed yearly. In our case series, a TTE was performed
between 2 and 10 months before transplant. When the high
mortality associated with HF in patients undergoing LT is
taken into consideration, the current guidelines should be
revised to include a TTE evaluation close to the time of
transplant. The treatment for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy developing after LT is symptom based. This includes
inotropic support, cautious use of diuretics, and careful
management of preload and afterload [31, 32]. In patients
with worsening organ function and delayed cardiac recovery, early institution of advanced hemodynamic support
techniques such as ECMO may be valuable options. It has
been demonstrated that cardiac dysfunction after LT, in
most patients with cirrhosis, is reversible with full recovery of functional, structural, and electrophysiological abnormalities and normalization of liver function [33, 34].
Although one of our patients recovered cardiac function
upon institution of ECMO support, he succumbed to
acute graft failure due to hepatic artery thrombosis. Further data is needed before ECMO can be routinely recommended in these patients.
Conclusions
We have presented three patients who underwent LT
and developed HF in the immediate post-operative
period. They all underwent a complex preoperative
evaluation and an uneventful transplantation, and were
hemodynamically stable throughout surgery. Postoperatively, all three patients developed acute HF associated
with dilated cardiomyopathy. Only one patient recovered
from the acute episode. Although risk factors for development of acute HF after LT have been identified in
retrospective studies, there is still a lack of clarity concerning optimal evaluation and management. Questions
regarding the threshold for ordering specialized cardiac
studies and the efficacy of these studies, as well as withholding candidacy for LT in these patients, remain
unanswered.
Based on our current knowledge, the combination of
diastolic dysfunction, QTc interval prolongation (above
450 ms), and an increased BNP level (above 400 pg/ml)
are predictive of HF in the postoperative period. Patients
with these findings must be managed very carefully with
special attention to avoid fluid overload. We believe the
best way to achieve this is with the routine use of TEE
monitoring. Once acute HF has occurred, multidisciplinary management is recommended. In patients with delayed cardiac recovery and worsening organ function,
the use of advanced hemodynamic support techniques
(ECMO) is controversial and needs further research.
