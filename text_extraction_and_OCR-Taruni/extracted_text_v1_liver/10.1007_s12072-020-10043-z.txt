Abstract
Annually, around 850 liver transplantation is performed in Beijing, China. Recently, the new coronavirus pneumonia 
(COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has afected nearly 200 countries worldwide. 2019-nCov 
can cause severe lung disease, multiple-organ damage, and signifcant mortalities. Liver transplant recipients, because of 
long-term oral immunosuppressant efects, may be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection and have a worse prognosis 
than the general population. It is urgent to set up guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in 
liver transplant recipients. In this article, we reviewed the clinical aspects of 2019-nCoV infection, characteristics of liver 
transplant recipients, immunosuppressant usage, and potential drug interactions to provide recommendations to clinical staf 
managing liver transplant recipients during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Introduction
The pathogen causing a “mysterious” pneumonia in Wuhan, 
Hubei, since December 2019, has been identifed as a novel 
coronavirus [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
named this virus the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
and the new coronavirus pneumonia as COVID-19. COVID19 has been included in the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the 
Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and is managed as a Class A infectious disease [1].
The COVID-19 epidemic has spread rapidly in China 
and other countries worldwide. With efective measures, 
the number of new cases in China has decreased signifcantly. However, with the sharp increase in other countries, 
imported cases increase markedly in China.
Early diagnosis, early quarantine, and early treatment 
are important in COVID-19 prevention and control. Understanding its biological characteristics and clinical manifestations is crucial to set up proper guidelines [2]. This article 
summarized recent relevant publications and put forward 
Hongling Liu and Xi He contributed equally to this study.

recommendations for management of liver transplantation 
during COVID-19 epidemic period.
2019‑nCoV and its pathogenesis
2019-nCoV is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA, betatype coronaviruses. It has four major structural proteins, 
namely fbrillin (S), envelope protein (M), small envelope 
protein (E), and nuclear protein (N). The initial attachment 
to the host cell is via binding of S protein to ACE2 receptor 
on host cell membrane [3].
2019-nCoV is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. It can 
be inactivated by ether, 75% alcohol, 56 °C for 30 min, and 
chlorine-containing disinfectant, chloroform [1]. The main 
transmission routes are droplet transmission and mucosal 
contact transmission [4]. There is also the possibility of 
aerosol transmission after exposure to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment for long 
period. 2019-nCoV nucleic acid sequences can be detected 
in patients’ eye secretions and feces, but whether transmission can occur remains to be confrmed [4]. 2019-nCoV 
infects all age groups, particularly the elderly and those with 
underlying diseases [4]. Organ transplant recipients are susceptible population.
Whether organ transplantation should be carried out 
during the COVID-19 epidemic remains controversial [1, 
4]. Due to the unknown risks, some experts suggested that 
transplantation should be suspended. Alternatively, the 
recently released guidance [4] suggested that transplantation 
surgery could be carried out after careful risk assessments.
Clinical characteristics of COVID‑19 in liver 
transplant recipients
Currently, the number of confrmed COVID-19 cases after 
liver transplantation is limited. In general, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were similar to general population.
Incubation period
The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infection is 1–14 days, 
mostly 3 to 7 days. Transmission can occur during the incubation period [1]. There is no evidence that the incubation 
period in liver transplant recipients is diferent.
Clinical manifestations
Fever
Fever is the frst symptom of 2019-nCoV infection in most 
patients. However, in organ transplant recipients, there may 
be only low-grade fever or no fever at all [2]. Therefore, 
transplant physicians cannot relax their vigilance in afebrile 
patients [1, 2].
Dry cough
Dry cough is the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 
in the general population and transplant recipients [1, 5].
Loss of smell and taste, and other symptoms
Loss of smell and taste has been observed in many COVID19 patients.
Due to the immuno-suppressive state, COVID-19 may 
progress rapidly to acute ARDS in transplant recipients [1, 
5].
Other common symptoms include fatigue, anorexia, nausea, nasal congestion, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea.
Imaging fndings
The imaging fndings of COVID-19 have common features 
with other viral pneumonia. Multiple small patchy shadows 
and interstitial changes with prominent extrapulmonary 
bands appear in early phase. Multiple ground-glass shadows, 
infltrates, and lung consolidation occur during the progress 
phase. Pleural efusion is rare. Chest CT is the recommended 
imaging procedure. Compared with the general population, 
liver transplant recipients have more extensive lung lesions, 
multiple lesions, and more lower lobes involvement [1, 6].
Laboratory tests
Leucocyte count is normal or low. Lymphopenia is common. Some patients have elevated liver enzymes, muscle 
enzymes, myoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase. Most have 
elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate. Severe and critically ill patients are more likely to have 
elevated D-dimers, progressive lymphopenia, and increase 
in infammatory markers [1, 5].
Diagnosis of COVID‑19 in liver transplant 
recipients
Suspected case
A suspected case is a subject with epidemiological history 
mentioned in Sect. 3.1.1 and any two of the clinical manifestation criteria mentioned in Sect. 3.1.2. If there is no clear 
epidemiological history, the subject must have all three clinical manifestations [1].

434 Hepatology International (2020) 14:432–436
1 3
Epidemiological history
In the 14 days before illness onset
1. History of residence in or entry and exit from a country 
with documented COVID-19 cases or
2. History of residence or visits to Wuhan and surrounding 
areas or
3. History of contact with COVID-19 patients or
4. Contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms 
from countries with case reports of COVID-19 or
5. Contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms 
from Wuhan and surrounding or
6. Residence or work in areas of suspected COVID-19 
outbreaks (for example, two or more cases in the same 
building, school, or ofce).
Clinical manifestation
1. Fever or respiratory symptoms.
2. Normal or decreased leucocyte counts: lymphopenia.
3. One or more of the imaging characteristics described in 
Sect. 2.3.
Confrmation of suspected case
COVID-19 is confrmed if
1. Real-time fuorescent RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV 
nucleic acid is positive or
2. Gene sequences from patient’s specimen and 2019-
nCoV are highly homologous or
3. Serum 2019-nCoV-specifc IgM antibodies and IgG 
antibodies are positive (IgG seroconversion or there is a 
fourfold increase from baseline).
COVID-19 is excluded if two consecutive tests of 2019-
nCoV nucleic acid (sampling time at least 24 h apart) are 
negative, and 2019-nCoV-specifc IgM/IgG antibodies are 
still negative after 7 days of onset.
2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection is performed in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, other lower respiratory tract 
secretions, blood, stool, and urine. Lower respiratory 
tract specimens (sputum or airway extracts) are preferred. 
Specimens should be submitted to testing centers as soon 
as possible after collection to maximize detection rates [1].
Diferential diagnosis
Infections with influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Pneumocystis carinii, and other pathogens 
must be ruled out.
2019-nCoV testing is recommended in symptomatic liver 
transplant recipient with COVID-19 epidemiological history, even if the tests for common respiratory pathogens are 
positive [1, 2].
Liver dysfunction is observed in up to 50% of COVID-19 
patients [5, 7], mainly hepatocellular pattern, usually mild 
and resolves in 2–3 weeks. If a liver transplant recipient 
develops cholestatic liver injury or liver function deteriorates 
rapidly, other etiologies must be excluded before attributing 
to COVID-19.
Management of liver transplant recipients 
during 2019‑nCoV epidemics
Prevention of CoVID‑19
Travel advice
1. Liver transplant recipients and their family members in 
the same household should abide by the travel advisories 
issued by their government agencies and cancel unnecessary trips. Avoid travel on cruise ships and to places 
with 2019-nCoV outbreaks.
2. All patients who have returned from countries with 
COVID-19 should contact the transplant centers by 
phone or electronic messages regarding follow-up 
arrangements.
Hospital visits
Telemedicine is preferred over face-to-face consultations to 
avoid cross-infection during hospital visits.
Recommendations:
1. Reduce the frequency of examinations and imaging as 
much as possible.
2. If blood tests or imaging is required, perform them at a 
low-risk hospital or have blood samples taken at lowrisk centers and then deliver to the relevant hospital.
3. Telemedicine if possible.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle
1. Regular exercise at home:
 regular meals, avoid cold food, raw seafood and wild 
animals;
 regular sleep schedule.
2. Pay attention to hand hygiene; wash hands frequently; 
wear a mask when going out; avoid contact with patients 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:432–436 435
1 3
with cough, fever, or infectious diseases; keep social distancing; regularly disinfect the environment.
3. Check body temperature daily.
4. Contact transplant centers promptly if develop fever and 
respiratory symptoms.
Transplant center setup
Recipients should be placed in single isolation rooms with 
bathroom facilities.
Close liaison with auxiliary departments such as radiology department so that the liver transplant recipients are 
separated in time and space from other patients.
Transplant team
Reviewing the reports published on SARS, MERS, and 
COVID-19, no mention is made on immunosuppression 
as a risk factor for mortality, and no fatality is reported 
to be linked to transplantation or other conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Risk factors for poor 
outcome include advanced age, male sex, and presence of 
comorbidities [8–10].
Recommendations:
1. Treat any liver transplant candidate or recipient presenting with epidemiology history or clinical manifestations 
mentioned in Sect. 3.1 as suspected case.
2. Wear complete personal protective equipment during 
patient’s care until 2019-nCoV infection is excluded.
3. Should self-quarantine after unprotected contact with 
a confirmed or suspected case until COVID-19 is 
excluded.
Evaluation of potential liver transplant recipients 
and patients on transplant waiting list
Currently, there is limited information on the impact of 
2019-nCoV on patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, 
chronic liver disease, with decompensated liver cirrhosis or 
transplant candidates on waiting list.
Recommendations:
1. Follow measures mentioned in Sect. 4.1 to reduce the 
risk of 2019-nCoV infection.
2. Prescribe enough basic medicines such as antiviral drugs 
for 2–3 months to reduce visits.
3. Avoid consulting potential liver transplant recipients or 
donors at liver clinic if they have fever and respiratory 
symptoms.
4. Living donation should not be performed on either a 
donor or recipient who has returned from countries with 
COVID-19 outbreaks or who have been exposed to confrmed or suspected COVID-19 within 14 days. Donors 
should not be considered if they have fever and/or respiratory symptoms unless 2019-nCoV is excluded.
Management of COVID‑19 liver transplant recipients
Currently, it is unclear whether transplant recipients are more 
likely to develop more severe COVID-19. Only one case of 
fatal SARS [11] in liver transplant recipient is reported and 
none with MERS. As for 2019-nCoV, an experience in Bergamo shows that three of two hundred transplant recipients 
were tested positive for 2019-nCoV [10]. It is well known 
that immunocompromised people were susceptible to viral 
infection. However, immunosuppressed patients>60 years 
of age are at higher risk of infection with 2019-nCoV, and 
may have prolonged virus clearance [1, 5].
Recommendations:
1. Follow measures mentioned in Sect. 4.1 to reduce risk 
of 2019-nCoV infection.
2. No need to adjust the dose of immunosuppressive drugs.
3. Emphasize preventive measures mentioned in Sect. 4.1.
4. Transplant patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms should inform the transplant centers promptly and 
avoid unscheduled visit to the clinic avoid inadvertent 
exposures.
Immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplant 
recipients with COVID‑19
Currently, the impact of immunosuppressant on COVID-19 
is unclear, and the recommendations for SARS/MERS are 
not validated because of short epidemic durations with limited cases. The potential role of corticosteroids in preventing 
mild COVID-19 from developing into severe pneumonia is 
controversial. WHO recommends avoiding the use of corticosteroids while treatment protocols in China recommend 
use for a short period of time in patients with rapid disease 
progression and evidence of marked infammations. Also, 
there is concern that reducing or discontinuing immunosuppressant may cause acute graft rejection [1, 2]. EASLESCMID position paper advises against immunosuppressive 
therapy reduction [12].
Recommendations:
1. No need to adjust the dose of immunosuppressive drugs 
in transplant recipients without COVID-19.
2. For patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, keep current immunosuppressant dosage and monitor patient’s 
condition closely. Avoid prescription of medications that 
cause large fuctuations in tacrolimus plasma concentrations.

436 Hepatology International (2020) 14:432–436

3. For patients with severe or rapidly progressing COVID19, reduce the amount of calcineurin inhibitor and consider stopping anti-metabolic drugs.
4. If decided to reduce the dose of steroids, keep at least a 
daily dose of 10 mg prednisone or equivalence to avoid 
adrenal insufciency.
5. Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies 
can be re-initiated with caution when the potential benefts outweighing their risks of discontinuation.
COVID‑19 therapy and potential drug interactions 
in liver transplant recipients
The results of randomized controlled trials showed that 
lopinavir/ritonavir did not show clinical beneft in patients 
with severe COVID-19, and in some patients, treatment 
were discontinued early due to adverse drug reactions [13]. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and tacrolimus dose should be signifcantly reduced if lopinavir/
ritonavir is used. Animal studies have shown that ACEI and 
ARB can prevent severe pulmonary complications caused 
by COVID-19, and no data are available in humans. The 
European College of Cardiology Hypertension Committee 
recommends that patients with COVID-19 should continue 
to receive conventional antihypertensive treatment, including ACEI and ARB drugs.
Recommendations:
1. The current evidence does not support the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in liver transplant recipients with COVID19.
2. Continue the use of ACEI and ARB.
3. Use of traditional Chinese medicine therapy without 
evidence-based data is not recommended.
4. Do not stop or adjust the immunosuppressive regimen 
without consulting the doctors.
5. Avoid medicines that have an impact on immunosuppressive drug concentrations.
