Background/Aims: Several noninvasive methods have recently been developed for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. 
The accuracy of transient elastography (TE), acoustic-radiation-force impulse (ARFI) elastography, and real-time 
elastography (RTE) in predicting liver fibrosis were evaluated. 
Methods: Seventy-four patients who had undergone a liver biopsy within the previous 6 months were submitted to 
evaluation with TE, ARFI, and RTE on the same day. 
Results: There were significant correlations between fibrosis stage and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using the 
three tested methods: TE, r2=0.272, P=0.0002; ARFI, r2=0.225, P=0.0017; and RTE, r2=0.228, P=0.0015. The areas under 
the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2, Metavir stage) by 
TE, ARFI, RTE, TE/platelet count (PLT), velocity of shear wave (Vs)/PLT, and elasticity score (Es)/PLT were 0.727, 0.715, 
0.507, 0.876, 0.874, and 0.811, respectively. The AUROC for the diagnosis of cirrhosis by TE, ARFI, RTE, TE/PLT, Vs/PLT, 
and Es/PLT were 0.786, 0.807, 0.767, 0.836, 0.819, and 0.838, respectively. Comparisons of AUROC between all LSMs for 
predicting significant fibrosis (≥F2) produced the following results: TE vs. RTE, P=0.0069; ARFI vs. RTE, P=0.0277; and 
TE vs. ARFI, P=0.8836. Applying PLT, the ability of each LSM to predict fibrosis stage significantly increased: TE/PLT vs. 
TE, P=0.0004; Vs/PLT vs. ARFI, P=0.0022; and Es/PLT vs. RTE, P<0.0001. However, the ability to predict cirrhosis was not 
enhanced, combining LSM and PLT. 
Conclusions: TE and ARFI may be better methods for predicting significant liver fibrosis than RTE. This predictive 
ability increased significantly when accounting for platelet count. However, all of the measures had comparable 
efficacies for predicting cirrhosis. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2013;19:156-164)

INTRODUCTION 
Liver fibrosis is a product of liver cell injury and healing. The 
measurement of liver fibrosis is generally used for therapeutic decision or the prognosis of patients with chronic liver diseases.1,2
Therefore, the accurate staging of liver fibrosis is critical for both 
patients and physicians.
Although there have been many efforts for the direct or indirect 
measurement of liver fibrosis, liver biopsy is still considered as a 
gold standard method for the assessment of liver fibrosis.3 However, it has some disadvantages such as its invasiveness, serious 
complications, intra- and interobserver variability, and sampling 
errors.3-9 Therefore, non-invasive diagnostic tools such as direct fibrosis markers, biomolecular markers or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) have been developed as a substitute of liver biopsy. 
There are several ultrasound based elastography for the evaluation 
of liver fibrosis such as transient elastography (TE),10-12 acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)13-16 and real time elastography (RTE).17-
21 TE is a method that concerns acquisition of pulse-echo ultrasound signals to measure liver stiffness. ARFI technology involves 
the mechanical excitation of tissue with the use of short duration 
acoustic pulses producing shear wave propagation away from the 
region of interest. RTE compares and analyze echo signals before 
and under slight compression to show the physical property of tissue with conventional ultrasound probes. However, the clinical 
usefulness of these utilities was not fully documented. 
The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of TE, ARFI 
and RTE, for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with 
chronic liver diseases. We also attempted to find out any clinical 
factor to improve the ability to estimate fibrosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We consecutively enrolled 74 patients with various chronic liver 
diseases who underwent liver biopsy from October 2010 to March 
2011 in Soon Chun Hyang University Bucheon Hospital. 
Blood biochemistry was carried out at enrollment including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
albumin, total bilirubin, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time 
(INR, international normalized ratio).
TE, ARFI and RTE were performed in each patient at the same 
day by an experienced physician. Within six months after liver biopsy, liver stiffness was also measured on the right lobe of the liver where liver biopsy had been performed. The staging of fibrosis 
from all biopsy specimens was interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Platelet count is known to predict liver fibrosis more accurately when it is combined with LSM.22 We defined TE/PLT as 
[kilopasckal (kPa)/PLT (×109/L)]×102 in TE, Vs/PLT as [velocity of 
shear wave (m/s)/PLT (×109/L)]×102 in ARFI, and Es/PLT as Es/PLT 
(×109/L)×102 in RTE. Informed written consent for enrolling the 
study of LSM was obtained from all patients. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital.
Transient elastography
TE was carried out in all patients with a FibroScan® (ECHOSEN 
FIBROSCAN 502, Paris, France). Ten valid measurements were 
performed, and median of liver stiffness was calculated as described before with results expressed in kilopascals (kPa) in each 
patient.23 Only patients who had a success rate > 60%, with an 
interquartile range (IQR) < 30% were included in this study.
Acoustic radiation force impulse
ARFI was carried out in all patients with SIEMENS ACUSON 
S2000 ultrasound system. Liver stiffness was measured on right 
lobe of liver through intercostal space in left lateral decubitus position with the right arm in maximum abduction. The ultrasound 
probe automatically generates shear-waves which propagate into 
the liver. The propagation speed increases with fibrosis. The operator can select the depth at which the liver elasticity is evaluated 
by placing a “measuring box” (10 mm long and 5 mm wide) in the 
desired place. Its speed, being expressed in meters/second (m/s), 
is displayed on the screen. Ten valid measurements were performed in each patient, and median values were calculated. A 
measurement depth of 5 cm below the liver capsule was chosen 
to standardize the examination. Success of ARFI was judged by 
the same criteria as TE.
Real time elastography
RTE was carried out in all patients with HITACHI HI VISION-Preirus and EUP-L52 linear probe (3-7 MHz). Liver stiffness was measured in supine position with the right arm elevated above the 
head. After examination in B-mode, the mode was switched to 
elastography. The probe was placed on the right intercostal space, 
and scanned vertically from the epigastrium to observe a sagittal 
section of the right hepatic lobe. An identical area where the liver 
tissue was at least 6 cm thick and was free of large blood vessels

was set as the region of interest (ROI) for all subjects. The colors 
in the ROI include the following: red (soft), blue (hard) and green 
(intermediate, normal). The degree of the hardness can be gained 
on the monitor in color by analyzing the relative hardness. The 
elasticity score was determined on a scale of 0 to 5. Ten valid 
measurements were performed in each patient, and median values were calculated.
Liver histology
Liver biopsy was performed in all 74 patients with sonographic 
guidance. Only liver specimens at least 2 cm in size were considered adequate for pathological interpretation. They were stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin, and reviewed blindly by an experienced pathologist.
Fibrosis staging was scored on an F0-F4 using the METAVIR 
scoring system: F0, no fibrosis; F1, portal fibrosis without septa; 
F2, portal fibrosis with few septa; F3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; and F4, cirrhosis.24
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We 
investigated clinical parameters to find out significant predictor for 
liver fibrosis. Significant factors remained in univariate analysis 
were entered into a multivariate analysis. Spearman’s correlation 
analysis was used to assess relationships between LSM and liver 
fibrosis stage. The diagnostic performance of the non-invasive 
methods was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves . AUROC were built for the detection of 
significant fibrosis (F≥2) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively. An AUROC over 0.8 indicates an excellent diagnostic test, and an AUROC between 0.7 and 0.8 should be considered clinically useful. 
Optimal cut-off value used for the detection of significant fibrosis 
and cirrhosis were selected based on the sensitivity (Se), specificity 
(Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value 
(NPV). Statistical analysis of the differences between AUROC 
curves was performed using MedCalc version 11.4 (MedCalc Software bvba, Mariakerke, Belgium) based on the theory of generalized U-statistics. The cut-off for statistical significance was set at 
P<0.05. 
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Our group included 74 patients (35 males and 39 females, mean age 47.3 
years). The etiologies of chronic liver diseases were classified as 
follows: chronic viral hepatitis (n=49, 66%), alcoholic liver disease 
(n=3, 4%), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n=13, 18%), autoimmune hepatitis (n=2, 3%), toxic hepatitis (n=6, 8%), and unknown (n=1, 1%). The stage of fibrosis was as follows; 2 (2.7%) in 
F0, 15 (20.3%) in F1, 21 (28.4%) in F2, 15 (20.3%) in F3, 21 
(28.4%) in F4. The patients having significant fibrosis (≥F2) was 
57/74 (77%). The mean elapsed time from the liver biopsy to the 
onset of LSM was 3.1±1.8 months.

Clinical parameters to predict liver fibrosis 
stage
All clinical factors were investigated to identify the relation with 
significant fibrosis stage (≥ F2).
In univariate analysis, PLT and INR were closely associated with 
significant fibrosis. Adjusting with INR, PLT was only significant 
predictor for liver fibrosis (F2 or more) in this data (OR; 1.027, 
95% confidence interval; 1.014 to 1.046, P-value <0.001) 
(Table 2).

P<0.0001), in Es/PLT (r2= 0.336; P<0.0001). Although there was a 
significant correlation between all LSMs and fibrosis stage, especially TE and ARFI can better predict the fibrosis stage as compared to RTE. This predictive ability was enhanced when accounting for platelet count. The values of R2
 to explain regression were 
increased when PLT was incorporated into LSM. 
AUROC analysis to predict significant fibrosis 
and cirrhosis
The diagnostic accuracy to predict significant fibrosis (≥F2) and 
cirrhosis (F4) was evaluated using ROC curve analysis. The cut-off 
values for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2) were as follows; TE, 7.50 kPa (AUROC of 0.727, with a Se of 64.9%, Sp of 
70.6%); ARFI, 1.19 m/s (AUROC of 0.715, with a Se of 78.9%, Sp 
of 58.8%); RTE, 2.54 (AUROC of 0.507, with a Se of 64.9%, Sp of 
35.3%) (Table 3). Comparing with AUROC of each LSM for predicting significant fibrosis (≥F2), TE is superior to RTE (P=0.0069), 
ARFI to RTE (P=0.0277). However, TE is not significantly different 
with ARFI (P=0.8836) (Table 4). When incorporating PLT, the results of LSM/PLT were as follows; TE/PLT, 4.19 (AUROC of 0.876, 
with a Se of 77.2%, Sp of 88.2%); Vs/PLT, 0.80 (AUROC of 0.874, 
with a Se of 80.7%, Sp of 88.2%); Es/PLT, 1.42 (AUROC of 0.811, 
with a Se of 79.0%, Sp of 64.7%). LSM/PLT showed a better preTable 3. Comparisons of diagnostic performance for the prediction of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis between TE, ARFI, RTE, TE/ PLT, Vs/PLT,

(P=0.0004), Vs/PLT to ARFI (P=0.0022) and Es/PLT to RTE 
(P<0.0001) (Fig. 3A) (Table 4).
The cut-off values of TE, ARFI and RTE for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were 8.60 kPa (AUROC of 0.786, with a Se of 81.0%, Sp of

66.0%), 2.79 (AUROC of 0.767, with a Se of 81.0%, Sp of 64.2%) 
respectively. Comparing with AUROC of each LSM for predicting 
cirrhosis, all methods are not significantly different (Table 4). 
When divided by PLT, the cut-off values of LSM/PLT for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were as follows; TE/PLT, 6.02 (AUROC of 0.836, 
with a Se of 90.5%, Sp of 66.0%); Vs/PLT, 1.28 (AUROC of 0.819, 
with a Se of 76.2%, Sp of 77.4%); Es/PLT, 2.20 (AUROC of 0.838, 
with a Se of 85.7%, Sp of 81.1%). The ability to predict cirrhosis 
was not significantly different between LSM alone and LSM/PLT 
(Fig. 3B) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Recently, several noninvasive methods for replacing liver biopsy 
have been actively studied. Among them, TE, ARFI and RTE measure liver stiffness using velocity of wave produced by ultrasound. 
TE is one of extensively applied non-invasive methods using the 
FibroScan® device, and its usefulness has been widely reported.25,26 Two meta-analyses11,27 showed it is satisfactory for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, it was difficult to measure liver stiffness in patients with a morbid obesity, 
severe hepatic atrophy and ascites.28
ARFI is a relatively new technology that has been recently introduced for evaluation of liver fibrosis. There is no need to get a 
special equipment to assess liver stiffness since the function to 
generate a wave is integrated in the probe that an ultrasound machine provides. One of great advantage of ARFI is that it is available even in patients with ascites or severe obesity.29 Though several studies have evaluated the application of ARFI in the 
assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic diffuse liver diseases, its 
usefulness is not well established yet.14-16,30-40 In a preliminary 
study performed by Friedrich-Rust et al,13 in which ARFI was compared to liver biopsy in 86 patients with chronic viral hepatitis, the 
Spearman correlation coefficient between the histological fibrosis 
stage and ARFI, TE were statistically significant. The AUROC and 
cut-off values for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis of ARFI, TE 
were 0.82, 0.84, respectively and 1.37 m/s (Se 68.5%, Sp 92.6%), 
6.3 kPa (Se 83.3%, Sp 74.1%), respectively. 
RTE is also a recently developed utility for the assessment of liver fibrosis.17,41,42 It does not require special technique. It is easy to 
verify the position because the images are juxtaposed with Bmode reference images. RTE also can evaluate liver fibrosis patients with ascites or severe obesity just as ARFI. According to 
Friedrich-Rust et al,41 the AUROC for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis of TE, RTE were 0.84, 0.69, and 0.97, 0.65, respectively. It means that RTE was less accurate for the prediction 
of liver fibrosis than TE.
In our study, TE, ARFI and RTE showed good correlations with 
histologic fibrotic stages. The optimal cut-off values for significant 
fibrosis (≥F2) were 7.5 kPa for TE (AUROC=0.727), 1.19 m/s for 
ARFI (AUROC=0.715) and 2.54 for RTE (AUROC=0.507). TE and 
ARFI had a better predictive value than RTE for predicting significant fibrosis (≥F2) (p=0.0069, P=0.0277). This result also demonstrated that TE and ARFI had a better performance to predict significant fibrosis than RTE. That’s because LSM by RTE is based 
upon the propagation wave from patient’s heartbeat which can 
vary depending on individuals. When we combined LSM and 
platelet count to enhance the ability of prediction for significant fibrosis (≥F2), LSM/PLT showed a more accurate prediction than 
LSM alone. Liver stiffness measured by 3 kinds of utilities predicts 
cirrhosis relatively well. The optimal cut-off values for cirrhosis 
were 8.6 kPa for TE (AUROC=0.786), 1.39 m/s for ARFI (AUROC=0.807) and 2.79 for RTE (AUROC=0.767). TE, ARFI and RTE 
for predicting cirrhosis did not show statistically significant difference from each other. Additionally, we assessed the performance

of TE/PLT, Vs/PLT and Es/PLT using platelet count for predicting 
cirrhosis as platelet count is expected helpful in diagnosing cirrhosis. However, a mathematic combination of LSM and platelet 
count did not show better performance than LSM alone. Our study 
illustrates that LSM itself has a good diagnostic accuracy to predict cirrhosis (F4) rather than significant fibrosis (≥F2).
There are several limitations in this study. First, our study is a 
retrospective study which can be biased in terms of selection, information, time-interval from biopsy and LSM. And also we had a 
small study population which might be responsible for type II error. The failure to enhance the ability to predict cirrhosis in spite of 
accounting for PLT might be attributed to small sample size. The 
other limitation is that our study population consisted of patients 
who had a various etiology of liver disease. Considering the optimal cut-off value of AUROC for fibrosis stage is quite different between viral hepatitis and fatty liver disease, putting various kinds 
of liver diseases together would lead to unintended or undesirable 
results. Lastly, internal validity for the interpretation of fibrosis 
stage and LSM was not performed. Since a pathologist and a physician were involved in this study, we had no chance to compare 
the agreement between observers. However, we applied TE, ARFI 
and RTE to estimate liver fibrosis in 74 patients with various liver 
diseases at the same time and evaluated how well they predict the 
fibrosis stage accurately. We also suggested that PLT would be 
useful to increase the ability of LSM. To our knowledge, this is the 
first article to compare TE, ARFI and RTE for the evaluation of liver 
fibrosis. 
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that TE and ARFI rather 
than RTE are useful as modalities for the assessment of liver fibrosis noninvasively. When platelet count was accounted, TE/PLT, Vs/
PLT and Es/PLT were more helpful for predicting significant fibrosis 
(≥F2) than LSM alone. More studies with LSM for estimation of 
liver fibrosis stage are needed for enhancing diagnostic performance.
