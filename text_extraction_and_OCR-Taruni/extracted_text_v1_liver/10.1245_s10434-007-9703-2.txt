Several recent studies have indicated that a margin
less than 1 cm is not a contraindication to resection of
colorectal liver metastases (CLM).1–3 In the one study2
that appropriately excluded from analyses those patients with positive margins, only number of metastases and extrahepatic disease - not margin width less
than 1 cm - predicted outcome. In our own series of 557
patients undergoing resection of CLM, patients with a
less-than-5-mm negative margin who underwent
resection infrequently experienced recurrence locally
(5%). Of note, the incidence of local recurrence was
similarly uncommon (11%) in patients resected who
had positive margins. Important, however, was the
finding that only 17% of patients with a positive margin
were alive after 5 years.1 In contrast, those patients
with a negative margin had a 5-year survival of 64%,
regardless of the width of the surgical margin. In
multivariate analysis, tumor number greater than 3
and tumor size equal to or more than 5 cm, but not
positive margins, were the main predictors of adverse
outcome. In aggregate, these data strongly suggest that
aggressive biological factors, and not necessarily
margin status itself, dictate outcome following hepatic
resection of CLMs. While adequate surgical margins
are clearly important, the actual width may not be as
critical in resecting CLMs because these lesions are
histopathologically well circumscribed,4 only 16%
have satellitosis,5 Glisson sheath extension is uncommon (14.5%) and limited (5 mm or less),6 and micrometastases are rare (2%).6 As such, the currently
available data support the concept of limited complete
resection utilizing a planned approach that encompasses all tumor-bearing liver parenchyma.
In this current issue of Annals of Surgical Oncology,
Elias et al. address the issue of surgical margin as it
relates to preoperative cross-sectional imaging. Specifically, Elias et al. have compared the preoperative
margins as defined by computed tomography and the
final margins as defined by pathological evaluation of
the resection specimen. The authors note that
approximately 5–8 mm of tumor-free hepatic parenchyma will ‘‘disappear’’ during hepatectomy. Given
this, the authors recommend a planned preoperative
surgical margin of 7–10 mm using preoperative computed tomography. However, many factors may have
contributed to the difference between the radiological
measurement of margins using preoperative computed tomography and the surgical margin as measured based on the pathology specimen.
Evaluation of preoperative margins is directly related to image quality. Thin cuts (2.5 mm), high
quality bolus of intravenous contrast and appropriate
scanning delays (ideally triple-phase, liver imaging
technique) are needed to assure accurate definition of
tumor contours and enhancement of the hepatic
veins. It is unclear whether Elias et al. used a uniform

imaging technique, which would have provided the
optimal evaluation of the tumor contours and the
tumor-major hepatic veins relationship. The authors
also used the ‘‘crushing technique’’ of parenchymal
transection, which does not necessarily minimize tissue loss and tumor exposure. Some ‘‘disappearance’’
of the tumor-free margin may, therefore, be attributable to the chosen technique of hepatic transection.
In our series of 557 liver resections using mostly the
ultrasonic dissector for parenchymal transection,1 we
had a margin-positive rate of only 8%, which compares favorably to other series.3 As such, whether the
findings of the report by Elias et al. are broadly
applicable to patients undergoing hepatic resection
using techniques other than the ‘‘crushing technique’’
remains undefined. Elias et al. also note that resection
occurred ‘‘within 3 mm’’ of the middle hepatic vein;
however, the middle hepatic vein along Cantlies line
was not universally and strictly exposed. Frequently,
main tributaries to the middle hepatic vein or the
cephalad extent of the dissection near the hepatocaval
junction can cause the surgeon to course away from
the middle hepatic vein toward the right or left portal
fissure planes during the dissection. Finally, while the
authors mention the use of intraoperative ultrasound
(IOUS), they do not report the distance between the
tumor and the middle hepatic vein as measured by
IOUS. This is important, as IOUS arguably is the
modality that most accurately defines the tumorvessel relationship. Using ultrasonography-guided
liver resection, Torzilli et al.7 recently advocated
resection of the hepatic vein only when tumor was
inseparable from the vessel wall. They reported a 0%
local recurrence after a median follow-up of 18
months.
What is the most efficient surgical technique and
what are the pitfalls to avoid incomplete resection of
hepatic CLMs? The combined use of preoperative
and intraoperative imaging is critical to define and
clarify the tumor-vessel relationship. If the portal
phase of the preoperative computed tomography
does not define the relationship between the tumor
and the vein (which can occur in cases of severe steatosis and hemodynamic variations affecting contrast
enhancement of the hepatic veins), a magnetic resonance image should be obtained. If the hepatic vein is
involved (e.g., tumor is inseparable from the hepatic
vein) a planned resection including the middle hepatic
vein should strongly be considered. This may involve
a central resection,8 an extended resection after portal
vein embolization9 or a segmental resection of the
hepatic vein if reversed portal flow is demonstrated
intraoperatively.10
If on preoperative imaging the tumor is close to the
middle hepatic vein, IOUS should ultimately define
the surgical approach. In this context, we would not
consider radiofrequency-assisted metastasectomy, as
advocated by Elias et al. Radiofrequency ablation
can be associated with distortion of the hepatic
parenchyma along the course of the major vessel,
thereby making dissection along this plane more
difficult. We therefore prefer the technique that was
recently described as the ‘‘two-surgeon technique’’,
which allows for dissection along the hepatic veins
(with or without extrahepatic control of the vein at
the hepatocaval junction).11 This technique of
parenchymal transection combines the saline-linked
cautery and the ultrasonic dissector, and is associated
with reduced blood loss as well as shorter parenchymal transection times. In addition, the ‘‘two-surgeon
technique’’ optimizes the surgical exposure and
facilitates dissection along the hepatic veins up to the
hepatocaval junction.
Elias et al. should be congratulated for emphasizing the need for a systematic planned approach to
achieve a margin-negative (curative) resection. The
surgical strategies outlined above should contribute
to achieving this goal.
