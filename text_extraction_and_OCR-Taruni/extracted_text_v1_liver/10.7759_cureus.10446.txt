Abstract
Statins, the lipid-lowering drugs, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), a lipid-related pathology, share a complex relationship, one known to be
hepatotoxic and other being hepatic injury. NASH is an unresolved mystery in terms of treatment. Could
statins prove to be a promising solution due to their pleiotropic properties in addition to the cholesterollowering effect? This study aims to find statin effectiveness in NAFLD/NASH treatment and prevention of
associated adverse outcomes. An extensive data search was done to identify the studies assessing statin
effect on NAFLD/NASH and then analyzed to establish the relationship. Several studies demonstrated a
reduction in NAFLD/NASH-associated inflammation and fibrosis with statin treatment. These antiinflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects were through their pleiotropic properties, which were in addition to
their cholesterol-lowering effect. In various animal studies, statins were found to improve hepatic
lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and fibrosis associated with NASH through multiple
pathways. Statins exert these protective effects by recovering the gene expression level of peroxisomal
proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and therefore restore the mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty
acid oxidation (FAO). Statin treatment also increased the levels of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an antioxidant and
antiatherogenic enzyme that is reduced in NAFLD as well as encounter the hepatic lipotoxicity by resolving
cholesterol crystals and Kupffer cells (KCs) with crown-like structures (CLSs). They exhibited antitumor
properties by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and vascular proliferative factors. Moreover, they
restored a healthy liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) along with
inhibiting the activation of HSC via modulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and expressions of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Besides, they were protective against cardiovascular disease
(CVD)-related morbidity and mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and metabolic syndrome (MS)
associated with NAFLD/NASH. NASH and its precursor, NAFLD, could be treated and prevented with statins
owing to their pleiotropic properties. This study helps to prove this by looking back at different literature
and has successfully enlightened the point. Once proved through large clinical trials on humans, it could
revolutionize the NASH therapy.

Introduction And Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of liver disease globally, is becoming the most
common indication for a liver transplant due to its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It
affects 25% of adults worldwide, 25% of which may progress to NASH [1]. NAFLD is characterized by the
accumulation of fat (>5%) in hepatocytes, called hepatic steatosis, without other causes of liver disease like
viral hepatitis, increased alcohol consumption, or any chronic liver disease [2]. However, it may progress to
NASH or steatohepatitis, which is hepatic steatosis with severe hepatic injury (balloon degeneration of
hepatocytes), hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. Further progression may lead to liver cirrhosis, end-stage
liver disease, portal hypertension (PH), and rarely hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD/NASH is also
found to be associated with other medical conditions like metabolic syndrome (MS), cardiovascular disease
(CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity [3]. Being closely linked with insulin resistance (IR) and central
obesity, it is regarded as an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis. In fact,
NAFLD/NASH has the highest risk of mortality in NAFLD/NASH patients with CVD than liver disease alone.
The development of NAFLD and its progression to NASH is not very well understood. Several mechanisms
play a role in liver damage. Different factors that impact the development of hepatic steatosis and its
progression to NASH could be presence of free fatty acids (FFA) due to IR and increased peripheral lipolysis,
increased synthesis and decreased triglycerides export through very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL),

inflammatory cytokines and adipokines production, hepatic oxidative stress, mitochondrial and peroxisomal
dysfunction, and intestinal microbiota (IM) [4]. The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is made through features of
MS without chronic liver disease and excessive alcohol consumption, imaging studies with evidence of liver
steatosis, liver enzymes, fatty liver index, and NAFLD fibrosis score, but it can only be confirmed with liver
biopsy [5]. Intrahepatic fibrosis is an established risk factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lifethreatening liver failure. However, in NAFLD patients, fibrosis stage is reported to be a superior predictor for
overall and liver mortality [6-8].
Currently, the front line management of NAFLD/NASH includes lifestyle modifications with decreased
dietary energy intake, weight loss, and exercise. No pharmacological treatment has been approved but the
use of insulin-sensitizing agents, lipid-lowering agents, and antioxidants is in practice [9]. There is a need to
find a pharma therapy that targets the underlying pathophysiology of this increasingly prevailing disease
and can halt its progression to lethal pathologies. Statins could prove to be a strong candidate in that
perspective as they are lipid/cholesterol-lowering agents being 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG
CoA) reductase inhibitors, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and also have pleiotropic effects.
Their pleiotropic effects include anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, antioxidant, anti-thrombotic, anticancer, and immune modulation, hence decreasing inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD/NASH patients
[10]. According to different studies, statins decrease hepatic steatosis by decreasing oxidative stress through
increased hepatic antioxidant paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity [11] and increase mitochondrial and
peroxisomal oxidation and induction of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a fatty
acid oxidation (FAO) regulator [12]. They also decrease hepatic inflammation by decreasing the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and transforming
growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) [13]. Moreover, statins improve fibrogenesis in NASH by improving
endothelial dysfunction with the restoration of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) and hepatic stellate
cells (HSC) phenotype and increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity [14-16]. Statins are
thought to be protective against HCC as they decrease hepatic expression of angiogenic factors like vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) [13]. In addition to that, statins also decrease isoprenoid levels [17] and resolve
cholesterol crystal, crown-like structures (CLSs) [18] and inactivate hepatic stellate cells (HSC) [19] which
prevents inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD/NASH. In the light of the above findings, statins might play an
important role in preventing, delaying, and transforming hepatic steatosis into NASH. Since they are
considered hepatotoxic, statins are not prescribed as frequently in a patient with liver disease, but recently
several studies have shown they are beneficial and safe in preventing and treating hepatic inflammation and
fibrosis associated with NAFLD and NASH [20]. Additionally, statin treatment is reported to decrease the risk
of atherosclerotic disease and NAFLD related CVD morbidity and mortality. As a matter of fact, they are the
only class of antihyperlipidemic that decreases CVD in NAFLD [21].
Statins are mainly considered antihyperlipidemic and their pleiotropic properties are not well appreciated.
This study aims at reviewing medical literature to discover different pathogenic pathways of NAFLD and its
progression to NASH and to find out the effectiveness of statins in such cases (Figure 1). Hopefully, this will
help justify more diversified use of statins and subsequently increase awareness of their use in NAFLD and
NASH. Since NAFLD/NASH are becoming a growing public health issue therefore to prevent and effectively
pretreat, statins use might be a breakthrough as NASH has the highest CVD risk but dyslipidemia remains
undertreated.

Method
Search Sources and Search Strategy
This study was conducted by using PubMed as the main database exclusively and was last searched on June
25, 2020, to find the related articles. Keywords used were NAFLD, NASH, statins, steatosis, fatty acid
oxidation, and cytokines. The search with the last 10 years inclusion criteria yielded 18,918 articles with
NAFLD, 10,308 articles for NASH, and 30,537 articles for the keyword statins. Then we searched using the
combination of keywords to narrow down our data. NASH and statins yielded 112 articles and NASH, statins,
and steatosis listed 91 published articles. Combining NASH, statins and fatty acid oxidation just listed 13
articles and NASH, statins, and cytokines came up with 12 articles only.
Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria
All studies were selected related to the topic of NAFLD/NASH and statins and all unrelated studies were
excluded. We just selected the studies which were peer-reviewed and any grey literature was excluded as
well. All selected articles were in the English language only. Moreover, no geographical or global
considerations were made. The studies were included without the restriction of study type, including
investigation of clinical trials, systematic review, and meta-analysis. Age, gender, and ethnicity were also
not taken into consideration while selecting the studies.
The articles were selected as full text as well as abstracts. Approximately 112 articles were identified, but
only those that reported original study data results with clear methodology conducted in the last 10 years
were included. In addition to those, we included studies from references of selected articles, that were from
earlier publication dates, which were considered critical to the summary of the effects of statins. From
finally selected articles, any non-peer-reviewed and duplicate papers were excluded. That narrowed the data
to 50 articles including both full texts as well as abstracts. The focus of the study was on the effects of statins
on NAFLD/NASH through different mechanisms, targeting the pathogenesis of the disease. We focused only
on those studies that show the effectiveness of statins and the studies of other drugs' effects on
NAFLD/NASH were excluded. Moreover, the data was collected ethically and legally following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist for quality appraisal.

Discussion
Pathogenesis and Future Molecular Targets
NAFLD, a new epidemic, histologically ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and then to cirrhosis.
The liver pathology starts with fat accumulation in the liver, with possible causes being increased hepatic
free fatty acids (FFA), increased synthesis and decreased release of triglyceride (TG) through very-lowdensity lipoprotein (VLDL), decreased hepatic beta-oxidation and increased liver de novo lipogenesis (DNL).
Moreover, NAFLD is usually associated with insulin resistance (IR) that will increase lipolysis from adipose
tissue, which in turn increases FFA that is taken up by the liver and causes lipid peroxidation, increasing the
production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine. The FFA increase might as well exceed mitochondrial betaoxidation which results in a further increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. IR also increases the liver
DNL by stimulating the enzymes in its pathway resulting in increased TG synthesis but decreased VLDL
secretion with resultant TG accumulation in the liver.
NASH or steatohepatitis progression depends on different factors such as FFA, inflammatory cytokines and
adipokines, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction [3]. FFA after beta and omega-oxidation
accumulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [22]. Proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are produced by the liver and adipose tissue from nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, are usually elevated and also associated with IR. In addition, adiponectin,
an anti-inflammatory adipokine produced by adipose tissue, is decreased which further decreases FFA
oxidation and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Recently, intestinal microbiota (IM) is suggested to play a role in
NAFLD pathogenesis by various pathways [3]. Several animal studies have proved cholesterol to be lipotoxic
and promote NASH development by forming cholesterol crystals in steatotic hepatocytes, which
activates nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing
protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and Kupffer cells (KCs) enlargement forming “crown-like structures”
(CLSs), and resulting into chronic inflammation and fibrosis [23]. The fibrogenic mechanisms in NASH are
complex but include IR, oxidative stress, cytokines specially adipokines. Many studies have shown that an
increase in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in hepatic tissue and serum, activates hepatic stellate
cells (HSC), a major source of extracellular matrix (ECM), whose altered deposition can increase fibrosis and
hence cirrhosis [19]. All the above studies explained the development of steatohepatitis through different
mechanisms with the main cause being excessive fat accumulation in the liver and its strong association
with IR which results in FFA availability that increases oxidative stress by proinflammatory cytokines,
mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. IM and cholesterol crystallization contributes to chronic inflammation and
fibrosis with HSC activation adding up to later. Summarizing all these studies we can say that there is no
single pathway for NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis. All the above studies complement each other in that
respect.

In the future, NASH is expected to be more common and there is no effective treatment so far. Current
research focuses on an agent that can target nuclear transcription factors, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress,
metabolic and inflammatory response; an agent that can prevent, resolve, and reverse inflammation and
fibrosis in the liver [24]. Multiple therapeutic approaches are considered. Statins could be one of those due to
their pleiotropic effects on inflammation and fibrosis, in addition to the antihyperlipidemic effect they are
used more commonly for.
Statins Pleiotropy
Statins, 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, are primarily used for
primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Over a while, several studies have shown that
they are more than cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors. They exert effects that are beyond lipid-lowering.
These cholesterol independent effects are called "pleiotropic" effects and include anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, antiproliferative, anti-thrombogenic, and immunomodulatory effects with plaque stability and
normalization of sympathetic outflow as well [25,26].
Target points for statin effects in NAFLD/NASH are the following:
Statins and Small Guanine Triphosphate Binding Proteins (GTPases)
Statins have been shown to have a protective effect on NAFLD/NASH through inhibition of small GTPases
(family of hydrolase enzymes that bind to the nucleotide guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hydrolyze it to
guanosine diphosphate) such as ras homologous family member A (RhoA) and rat sarcoma protein (Ras) by
decreasing the isoprenoid levels. Prenylation is an important reaction that allows anchoring of proteins such
as small GTPases to cell membranes and their interaction with downstream effectors. Thus, statins modify
intracellular signaling of different receptors and therefore, decrease inflammation and fibrosis due to
inhibition of RhoA and Ras downstream signaling. The study was performed by Robert Schierwagen et al., on
twelve-week-old mice after feeding them with a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet for seven weeks to develop
NASH. The liver biopsies were taken and the effects of different interventions were studied. It is thought
that small GTPases like Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), Ras, and RhoA play an important
role in the development of metabolic syndrome (MS). Different inhibitors were used to find the role of each
GTPase including NSC 23766 trihydrochloride (NSC), a selective inhibitor of RAC1, and Clostridium sordellii
lethal toxin (LT), that inhibits RAC1 and Ras at the same extent, and lastly simvastatin (SMV), an inhibitor of
RAC1, Ras, and RhoA. The study results showed that SMV decreased inflammation and fibrosis through
inhibition of Ras extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (Ras/ERK) and RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathways
but RAC1 inhibition had no effect. Moreover, no effect of the small GTPase inhibition was detected on
steatosis. Thus simvastatin exhibited anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in NAFLD by inhibition of
RhoA- and Ras-mediated pathways without changing steatosis [17].
Statins and Proliferator-Activated Receptor α (PPARα)
Another mechanism by which statins may exert their pleiotropic effect is via increasing the gene expression
of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), the master regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
hence improving the peroxisomal and mitochondrial FAO, that is decreased in NASH patients. The
mitochondria play an important role in steatohepatitis by the accumulation of cholesterol. Whereas
peroxisomes exert their metabolic effect by the degradation of very long chain and branched-chain fatty
acids, which cannot be instantly oxidized in mitochondria. Peroxisomes also play a critical role in the
maintenance of intracellular redox balance. A study was conducted by Park et al. on seven-week-old mice
after giving them normal chow or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD) with or without various
statins like fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) for six weeks.
Histological lesions were analyzed and mitochondrial and peroxisomal FAO were measured in the liver. The
results showed an increase in hepatic mitochondrial and peroxisomal FAO via induction of PPARα and its
target genes by statins. Furthermore, out of all the statins, fluvastatin was found to have the most effect.
Thus the study found that statin treatment decreases both hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. This study
indicated a possibility that improving peroxisomal and mitochondrial function by statins increases the
hepatic FAO which may prevent NASH [12].
Statins and Paraoxonase 1 (PON1)
Statins increase the levels of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an antioxidant and antiatherogenic enzyme synthesized
mainly in the liver and hydrolyze peroxides and lactones associated with lipoproteins, and is therefore
linked to a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation. It is also associated with high-density
lipoproteins (HDLs) in the blood, resulting in an atheroprotective effect. The study by Milaciu et al. was a
clinical trial conducted on 50 patients with NAFLD and 20 normal subjects matched for age and sex. NAFLD
patients were further divided into two groups (25 patients each), one of which received atorvastatin 40 mg
tablet for eight months. The following investigations were performed: abdominal ultrasonography, serum
PON1 activity level, liver function tests, serum lipid profile, fasting, and postprandial blood glucose and
serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GP). Results showed a significant

decrease in serum PON1 activity with an increase in MDA and GP activity (i.e significant increase in lipid
peroxidation rate) in a non-interventional group but after atorvastatin therapy, there was a significant
increase in serum PON1 activity and a significant decrease in serum MDA levels. Therefore decreasing PON1
and increased MDA might be a biochemical marker for lipid peroxidation which could be improved with
statins resulting in the prevention of steatohepatitis. Moreover, LM + MM genotypes of the PON1 gene L55M
polymorphism were found to be an independent predictor for the presence of NAFLD [22]. So the study
proved the link of low PON1 concentrations and LM+MM genotypes of PON1 gene L55M polymorphism with
NAFLD while statins improved it.
Statins and Kupffer Cell Crown-Like Structures
Statins help ameliorate hepatic lipotoxicity, a mechanism for NASH development when the liver is exposed
to lipotoxic lipid species, by resolving cholesterol crystals and Kupffer cells (KCs) with crown-like structures
(CLSs) hence improving inflammation and fibrosis associated with it. Recent experimental studies suggest
that free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) is an important lipotoxic molecule that promotes the development
of NASH by enlarged KC surrounding steatotic hepatocytes containing cholesterol crystals and forming
characteristic crown-like structures similar to those recently described in inflamed visceral adipose tissue.
These enlarged activated KCs then take the appearance of the lipid-laden “foam cells” found in atheroma.
Moreover, the cholesterol crystals also appear to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in animal models of
atherosclerosis, therefore providing a mechanism by which exposure of KCs to cholesterol crystals could lead
to chronic inflammation and resultant fibrosis in NASH. In a study by Ioannou et al., mice were fed a high-fat
(23%) and 0.2% cholesterol-containing diet for 16 weeks and then assigned to four intervention groups for
eight weeks: a) vehicle control, b) ezetimibe (5 mg/kg/day), c) atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day), or d) ezetimibe
and atorvastatin. In vehicle-treated mice, the liver developed fibrosing NASH with cholesterol crystallization
in lipid droplets extending over 3.3% (SD, 2.2%) of liver surface area. The lipid droplets with cholesterol
crystallization were surrounded by TNFα-positive (activated) KCs forming CLSs (≥3 per high-power field).
KCs forming CLSs stained positive for NLRP3, showing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response
to cholesterol crystals. Whereas, mice treated with ezetimibe and atorvastatin showed almost complete
resolution of cholesterol crystals [0.01% (SD, 0.02%) of the surface area] and CLSs (0 per high-power field),
and improvement of fibrosis. But ezetimibe or atorvastatin alone had intermediate effects on cholesterol
crystallization, CLSs, and NASH [18]. This study indicated how hepatic cholesterol crystals activate the
NLRP3 inflammasome within the KCs that form CLSs which is found to be associated with the progression of
NASH. Moreover, it stresses the benefits of cholesterol-lowering drugs including statins in improving
NAFLD pathology and disease progression by preventing inflammation and fibrosis.
Statins and Profibrogenic Factors
Statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic effects and can prove to be protective against
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with advanced stages of NAFLD. Yokohama et al. conducted a
study on stelic animal model (STAM) mice after being fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to develop HCC. The
histological analysis of hepatic tissue, as well as blood samples, were obtained to find the effect of
rosuvastatin (Ros). The results have shown a decrease in the expression level of proinflammatory cytokines,
such as TNF-α, IL-6, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interferon gama (IFN-γ), and profibrogenic factor-like
transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) as well as angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), by almost 50% in the Ros group. This finding suggests that Ros, a statin, has an antitumor effect
mediated by the downregulation of vascular proliferative factors in addition to its antihyperlipidemic effect,
therefore protective against HCC associated with NASH [13].
Statins and Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell (LSEC)
Statins improve sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction and prevent portal hypertension (PH). Many studies have
verified that clinical complications of NASH are due to PH, which may precede fibrosis development and is
caused by liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) dedifferentiation/capillarization with decreased nitric
oxide (NO) production and subsequent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, resulting in increased
intrahepatic vascular resistance in cirrhosis and raising portal pressure (PP). A study was done by Bravo et
al. with rats on a high-fat glucose-fructose diet (HFGFD) or a control diet (CD) for eight weeks and then they
were treated with simvastatin (sim), atorvastatin (ato), or vehicle. Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction was
assessed in LSEC and HSC from the liver samples on a histological and biochemical basis while
hemodynamic changes were also analyzed. HFGFD rats demonstrated full NASH features without fibrosis
and increased portal pressure compared with CD rats (10.47 ± 0.37 mmHg vs 8.30 ± 0.22 mmHg; p < 0.001). In
addition, HFGFD rats showed a high percentage of capillarized (CD32b−/CD11b−) LSEC (8% vs 1%, p =
0.005), a phenotype associated with HSC activation. Statin treatments resulted in decreased portal pressure
(sim: 9.29 ± 0.25 mmHg, p < 0.01; ato: 8.85 ± 0.30 mmHg, p < 0.001), reversed NASH, along with LSEC
differentiation recovery and a HSC activation regressed to a more inert phenotype. The study results showed
that statins improved NASH histology as well as PH along with recovering sinusoidal endothelial function by
restoring a healthy LSEC and HSC phenotype which leads to a decrease in PP and improved prognosis [27].
Therefore, statins are vasoprotective to liver sinusoidal endothelium by maintaining LSEC differentiated
phenotype.

Statins and Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSC) Activation
Statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects that can help ameliorate steatosis-induced hepatic
fibrogenesis in NASH. Chong et al. investigated the anti-fibrotic properties of fluvastatin (Flu) in vitro and in
vivo. Human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) was grown and primary rat hepatocytes (PRHs) were collected and
cultured and treated with Palmitate (PA). Intracellular H2O2 levels for reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well
as changes in expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase gp91phox
subunit, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and nuclear factor-kappa (NFκB) p65 nuclear translocation were
measured. Moreover, expressions of pro-inflammatory genes, pro-fibrogenic gene, and protein expression of
α-SMA were also analyzed in cultured rat hepatic stellate cell (HSC), with or without Flu-pretreatment. In an
in vivo study, rats were fed choline-deficient L-amino acid defined (CDAA) diet to induce NASH and then
Wistar rats (n = 28) randomly assigned to normal controls (n = 4), CDAA diet with vehicles, and CDAA diet
with Flu (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) (n = eight each) for four or eight weeks. After that, livers were histologically
analyzed. Results of the study showed that, in vitro, Flu inhibited PA-induced free-radical production,
gp91phox expression, and NFκB p65 translocation in HepG2 and PRHs, as well as suppressed α-SMA protein
and pro-fibrogenic gene expressions in rat HSC. In vivo, Flu reduced steatosis and fibrosis scores, α-SMA
protein expression, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic genes in livers of CDAA rats
[10].
According to several previous studies, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is associated with chronic
liver diseases. NADPH oxidase gp91phox subunit, which is present in a variety of hepatic cells including the
Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and HSC, participates in liver inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover,
proinflammatory cytokines and NFκB activation are also related to inflammation and resultant activation of
HSC. α-SMA protein expression is a marker of HSC activation through the paracrine effect of the hepatocyte.
All these processes were suppressed by Flu treatment in the above study. Moreover, Flu inhibits HSC
activation which is associated with fibrogenesis, directly as well as through the paracrine effect of
hepatocytes. So, this study proved the anti-fibrotic effects of Flu in steatosis-induced hepatocyte damage
and showed that Flu decreases ROS production, gp91phox expression, NFκB activity, and pro-inflammatory
gene expressions, and reduce α-SMA protein expression and profibrogenic genes expressions in HSC. Thus
suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress which in turn reduce steatosis-induced hepatic fibrogenesis
[10]. In addition to its lipid-lowering effects, the results of the present study support the role of Flu as an
effective anti-fibrosis agent that has the potential to become a promising candidate for NASH therapy.
Another study by Wang et al. demonstrated a simvastatin role in liver fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro. Male
Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet to develop NASH related liver fibrosis and simvastatin (4mg·kg-1·d-1)
was given intragastrically until hepatic histological findings confirmed the fibrosis. Human hepatic stellate
cell (HSC) line LX-2 cells were cultured and treated with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), served as a
positive control, simvastatin, TGF-β1 plus simvastatin, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (LNAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase), and L-NAME with simvastatin. The expressions of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and Collagen І, as well as cellular αSMA, were measured in liver tissue and HSC. The results exhibit an increase in hepatic mRNA and protein
expressions of iNOS, α-SMA, and Collagen І and decrease in eNOS during NASH progression. While rats in
the simvastatin group had vise versa that is decreased expressions of iNOS, α-SMA, and Collagen І and
increased expressions of eNOS. In vitro, simvastatin inhibited LX-2 cell activation due to TGF-β1 or L-NAME
by increasing the expression of eNOS and decreasing the expression of iNOS. In conclusion, this study
proved the antifibrotic effect of simvastatin by decreasing the hepatic lipid deposition, hepatic
inflammation, and the development of fibrosis by inhibiting the activation of HSC via modulating iNOS and
eNOS [19].
All the above studies elicited the benefits of statin use in NAFLD/NASH exhibiting different pathways
(Figure 2). All were within the last seven years. Most of these were animal studies except the one by Milaciu
et al. [22], which is a human study but had several limitations such as not using liver biopsy to establish
NAFLD diagnosis as the rest of the studies did, hence need to be proved by larger clinical trials on humans.

Statins in a Protective Role
NAFLD is found to be strongly associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic
syndrome. It is also associated with CVD, making it the leading cause of mortality in NAFLD. NASH, the
more severe form is related to cirrhosis and an increased risk of HCC. Therefore, it is important to identify
and proactively treat NAFLD/NASH to prevent all the above-associated risk factors [20]. Currently, no
effective treatment for NAFLD/NASH has been approved. According to several studies statins have proven to
be effective in treating as well as preventing many risk factors associated with NAFLD/NASH. A narrative
review by Athyros et al. assessed the evidence supporting statin use for the treatment of NASH and the
reduction of the high CVD risk. The data for animal studies indicated the benefit of statin use in improving
liver histology. In humans, post hoc analyses of three randomized controlled trials (n=1,600, n=1,123,
n=8,864) found that atorvastatin (even in 80 mg/day) improves the liver enzyme and ultrasonographic
findings in NAFLD/NASH. Moreover, statin treatment decreases the CVD morbidity and mortality to half in
statin-treated NAFLD/NASH patients. The results of the study show the protective effect of statin treatment
on steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis and improve or cure NAFLD/NASH, as well as significantly reduce
CVD morbidity and mortality [28]. Another literature review by Doumas et al. analyzed the statin effect on
NAFLD and NASH. After reviewing three post hoc clinical trials it concluded that statins (specifical
atorvastatin) reduce CVD as much as twice than those with normal liver function. Moreover, statin
treatment may also be protective against HCC related to NAFLD/NASH [29]. In a randomized clinical trial by
Kargiotis et al., 20 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and biopsy-proven NASH were treated with
rosuvastatin (10 mg/d) monotherapy for one year and followed up with repeat liver biopsy and
ultrasonography. The results showed complete resolution of NASH and normalization of liver enzymes, lipid
profile, serum uric acid (SUA), and blood glucose levels in 19 patients whereas no patient had MS at the end
of the study, suggesting that rosuvastatin monotherapy could improve NASH and completely resolves MS
within 12 months. The study results further strengthen the role of statins in NAFLD/NASH treatment and
thier effectiveness against the reduction of the associated risk factors like MS [30].
We reviewed four studies to find statin effectiveness in improving the risk factors. Three of these were
narrative reviews based on previous clinical trials with large samples, hence can be considered powerful.
One was a randomized controlled trial but with a small sample size (20 patients) therefore, results need to
be confirmed with larger prospective studies. The last study also lacked a control group because based on
lipid guidelines it was unethical to deprive statin treatment in NASH patients with MS.
Statins and Liver Safety
Statins have always been a safety concern for NAFLD/NASH patients as they are considered hepatotoxic.
NAFLD has higher CVD risk but statins are not often prescribed especially in patients with high plasma

Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology

aminotransferase levels. Therefore, patients are deprived of an effective and most needed therapy which
could be preventing future complications and may reverse the present pathology. To evaluate the safety of
statins, a randomized controlled trial was done by Bril et al. including 101 patients with biopsy-proven NASH
and prediabetes/T2DM were followed for up to 36 months, out of which 86 were receiving statins. The
patients were assessed for biochemical and histological changes. Results showed no changes in liver
histology or hepatic insulin resistance in patients with NASH, newly started on a statin, or receiving a
placebo during the study. The study concluded that statins can be safely used in patients with NASH and not
be denied to these patients, who already have a very high risk for cardiovascular disease [31]. A metaanalysis by Eslami et al. concluded that statins may improve serum aminotransferase levels as well as
ultrasound findings in NASH patients [32]. According to other review studies by Athyros et al. [28] and
Doumas et al. [29], statin administration is an effective lifesaver in NASH patients and as safe as in the
general population.
The first study was a large prospective study and called for changing the current practice encouraging the
use of statins in NASH patients as they have the highest CVD risk but dyslipidemia remains often
undertreated. The second was a meta-analysis including two trials with a high risk of bias and a small
number of participants.

Limitations and considerations
More than 90% of studies included in this review are animal studies so in the future, there is a need for
larger high-quality human clinical trials to establish clinical care. We also did not consider studies with other
lipid-lowering agents, insulin resistance treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid, probiotics, and synbiotic, which
have beneficial effects and could be accounted for in combination with statin therapy, but not been
approved yet. This review might help answer a critical question of statins and NAFLD/NASH relation in
terms of treatment but another one arises as we move further. So far, we have concluded that statins can be
protective and effective in NAFLD but can statins be considered as an option for the future standard of care
for NAFLD once diagnosed, and if it does then which one, as different statins have different potencies?
Conclusions
Could statins prove to be preventive and therapeutic in NAFLD and NASH? This review proves the
effectiveness of statins through their pleiotropic and antihyperlipidemic effects against NAFLD/NASHassociated inflammation and fibrosis. Statins achieve this goal through actions on different target points
whether its RhoA and Ras inhibition, increasing PPARα expression, decreasing PON1 levels, preventing
LSEC dedifferentiation and HSC activation, or resolving KCs crown-like structures. Moreover, they also
improve the NASH-associated adverse outcomes like MS, CVD morbidity and mortality, and HCC prevention
and are found to be safe. This study's results have taken the drug closer to resolving the question, setting a
course for future researchers to follow and encouraging clinicians to use statins as a routine care for
NAFLD/NASH. If confirmed further with larger human clinical trials, it might prove to be a promising drug in
the treatment of NASH, which is still an unresolved mystery.
