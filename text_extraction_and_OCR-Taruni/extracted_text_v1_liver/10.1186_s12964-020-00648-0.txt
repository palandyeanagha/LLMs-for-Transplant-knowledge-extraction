Abstract
Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-mediated liver disease is a toxic “gain-of-function” inflammation
in the liver associated with intracellular retention of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin. The clinical presentation of the
disease includes fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure. However, the pathogenic mechanism of AATD-mediated liver
disease is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in progression of
AATD-mediated liver disease.
Methods: EVs were isolated from plasma of AATD individuals with liver disease and healthy controls. Their
cytokines and miRNA content were examined by multiplex assay and small RNA sequencing. The bioactivity of EVs
was assessed by qPCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescent experiments using human hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs) treated with EVs isolated from control or AATD plasma samples.
Results: We have found that AATD individuals have a distinct population of EVs with pathological cytokine and
miRNA contents. When HSCs were cultured with AATD plasma derived-EVs, the expression of genes related to the
development of fibrosis were significantly amplified compared to those treated with healthy control plasma EVs.
Conclusion: AATD individuals have a distinct population of EVs with abnormal cytokine and miRNA contents and
the capacity to activate HSCs and mediate fibrosis. Better understanding of the components which cause liver
inflammation and fibrogenesis, leading to further liver injury, has the potential to lead to the development of new
treatments or preventive strategies to prevent AATD-mediated liver disease.

Background
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), is primarily produced in the
liver, contributing to the innate immune system as an
anti-inflammatory protein by inhibiting destructive
neutrophil proteases [1]. Moreover, AAT has been shown
to have anti-inflammatory properties independent of its
antiprotease activity through modulating cellular processes
like apoptosis and cytokine expression [2, 3]. Alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common inherited
cause of liver disease and the most frequent genetic
etiology for pediatric liver disease and transplantation [3].
Z mutation - the most common deficiency allele - results
in accumulation of misfolded ZAAT in hepatocytes and
monocytes and low levels of circulating AAT which, leads
to uncontrolled proteolytic activity in different tissues
especially in lungs [1]. The histological features of the liver
disease are characterized by the accumulation of

aggregated ZAAT within hepatocytes accompanied by
hepatic injury and inflammation. A “two-hit model” has
been postulated as a potential mechanism responsible
for liver disease pathogenesis, in which the first “hit” is
provided by accumulation of misfolded ZAAT in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, and the
second hit, which can include oxidative stress and inflammation [4]. The extrahepatic inflammation may
affect liver function via secreted soluble factors leading
to the activation of inflammatory pathways and facilitating progression of hepatic injury [5]. Studies from
human AAT transgenic mice show that intrahepatic accumulation of ZAAT is associated with liver injury in
these mice [6]. We have also shown a complex relationship between the accumulation of ZAAT, steatosis, and
fibrosis in AATD individuals [7].
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) localize to the perisinusoidal space and are the primary source of activated
myofibroblasts that drive liver fibrogenesis. Activated
HSCs are a major source of collagen, ECM proteins, and
tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases promoting liver
remodeling in response to inflammatory mediators
released from neighboring cells [8] as well as cells from
different organs [9]. Although the mechanisms defining
fibrogenesis initiated by HSCs is unclear, recent studies
have explored potential roles for Extracellular Vesicles
(EVs) in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis initiated by
activation of HSCs [10].
EVs are membrane vesicles naturally released from
every cell type, with diameters ranging from 30 to 200
nm. They are enriched in nucleotides, lipids, and proteins from their cells of origin which characterizes them
as distinct organelles [11]. They act as local immune
modulators by delivering their cargo to adjacent recipient cells or enter in a biological fluid thus reaching
distant sites [11]. Recent research has implicated that
EVs released by activated immune cells and injured
parenchymal cells act in a paracrine manner [12] to
stimulate liver fibrosis. Signs of immune-mediated
complications are uniquely present in AATD patients
[13, 14] and suggest a contribution from a variety of
activated immune cells as well as liver parenchymal cells.
Thus, whether EVs may be modulated by AATD disease
state remains to be determined as does the contribution
of circulating modulated EVs to immune responses in
AATD-mediated liver disease.
In this study we test the hypothesis that immune
complications and injured hepatocytes associated with
AATD, results in release of EV population carrying
pathological cargo. We show that the AATD individuals
exhibit a pro-fibrogenic EV cytokine and miRNA profile.
Furthermore, we show that AATD plasma derived EVs
have the ability to promote liver fibrosis by inducing
HSCs migration, trans-differentiation and activation
in vitro. Our results suggest that in the pathogenesis of
AATD-mediated liver disease, EVs play an important
role in modulating a cross-talk network in liver fibrosis.
These findings begin to explain how immune complications associated with AATD may regulate organ crosstalk and provide a mechanism by which circulating EVs
carrying pathological cargo modulates HSCs activation
initiating liver fibrosis.
Material and methods
Clinical samples
Age and sex matched healthy subjects with an MM
genotype and no family history of AATD were selected
from the Alpha-1 Foundation DNA and Tissue Bank for
use as a control group. Study subjects were chosen from
a clinical study based at the University of Florida that
followed patients with AATD over a 3-year period to
evaluate progression of liver disease (Table 1). Plasma
from subjects with a ZZ genotype and liver biopsies
indicating presence of fibrosis and high levels of PASD
positive cells were used [7]. All AATD individuals
confirmed by genetic testing who were age 21–71, from
the US or Canada, and willing to consent to a liver
biopsy were eligible. Decompensated liver disease
(ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy,
hepatocellular carcinoma) was excluded. Recipients of a
liver or lung transplant were excluded. A total of 26
patients were included. All participants gave informed,
written consent prior to enrolling. The study was
approved by the University of Florida institutional IRB

Cell culture
Human LX-2 cell line, purchased from MilliporeSigma
(Burlington, MA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% FBS
and 1% Primocin™ from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA), at
37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. iPSCderived HSCs were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [15]. Briefly, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells-derived iPSCs provided by iPSC core
at the University of Florida were incubated with BMP4
from StemCell Technologies (Vancouver, BC) for 4 days
to induce mesodermal progenitors. Following this step,
the cells were subsequently incubated with BMP4, FGF1,
and FGF3 until day 6 to induce a liver mesenchymal
submesothelial phenotype. From days 6 to 8, the cells
were incubated with FGF1, FGF3, retinol, and palmitic
acid, from StemCell Technologies (Vancouver, BC). The
final step of differentiation was modeled by incubation
of the cells with retinol and palmitic acid from day 8 to
day 12. We next characterized differentiated iPSC-HSCs
on day 12 (Supplementary Figure 1a and B). iPSC-HSCs
were analyzed for the expression levels of markers associated
with HSCs (Supplementary Figure 1C) including TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of Metallopeptidase Inhibitor 1), CoL1A1(Collagen type1 Alpha1), α-SMA (Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin)
and LRAT (Lecithin: Retinol Acyl Transferase).
Isolation of EVs
EVs were isolated from approximately 3 mL of cryopreserved plasma by differential centrifugation [16]. Briefly,
the plasma was diluted in PBS (1:1) and centrifuged at
2000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and at 12,000 rpm for 30 min
at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected into ultracentrifuge
tubes and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-40Ti swinging
rotor ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 110,000 x g
for 2 h at 4 °C. Resuspended pellets in PBS were filtered
through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and
centrifuged at 110,000×g for 70 min at 4 °C. EV pellets
were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 110,000×g for
70 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. EV
preparations were conserved at − 80 °C for later use.
Particle number and size measurement
The size distribution and concentration of the isolated
EVs was analyzed by Nanosight NS300 system (Nanosight and Malvern, United Kingdom). Briefly, purified
EVs were homogenized by vortexing followed by dilution of 1:100 in sterile PBS. Each sample analysis was
conducted for 60 s. Data was analyzed by Nanosight
NTA 2.3 Analytical Software with the detection threshold optimized for each sample and screen gain at 10 to
track as many particles as possible with minimal background. A blank 0.2 μm- filtered 1x PBS was also run as
a negative control. At least five analysis were done for
each individual sample.
Transmission electron microscopy
Purified EVs were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. A
20 μl drop of the suspension was loaded onto a formvar
coated grid, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl
acetate, and examined under a Hitachi 7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies,
Schaumburg, IL) equipped with a Macrofire monochrome
progressive scan CCD camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA)
and AMTV image capture software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA).
EVs RNA isolation, small RNA library preparation,
sequencing, and bioinformatics
RNA was isolated using exoRNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen)
from purified EV fractions derived from 4 MM healthy
and 5 ZZ plasma samples. The quantity and quality of
the RNA were determined using the Agilent RNA 6000
Pico Kit and a Small RNA Kit Chip on the Agilent Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing
libraries were constructed using ∼2 ng of total EV RNA
with Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina kit (New
England BioLabs) and were sequenced using Illumina
Miseq 1 × 150 cycles V3 kit at the University of Florida
Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. The
expression of the miRNAs was obtained using miRDeep2 software [14] and differential analysis was performed using the exact test from edgeR package [17].
We performed enrichment analysis using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
(IPA) system. Redwood, CA: Ingenuity Systems, Inc.;)
package using the miRNA-mRNA target link module to
link the discovered significantly differentially expressed
miRNAs with their mRNA target genes. Because IPA
does not include prediction scores, to validate the
miRNA target genes, we performed additional computational analysis using TargetScan (Release 7.1. Jun, 2016.)
to identify target genes with good predicted scores. In
addition, we used IPA to identify miRNA-mRNA target
genes which have been experimentally confirmed.
Real-time qPCR validation of selected miRNAS from small
RNA-sequencing
Reverse transcription reactions were performed using
the TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays kit (Applied
Biosystems. Inc., CA; USA) using 2 μL of cell-free RNA
extracted from exosomes. Real-time PCR reactions were
performed in duplicate in 20 μL reaction volumes using
10 μL SensiFAST Probe Lo-ROX 2x PCR Master Mix
(Bioline, Memphis, TN), 1 μL TaqMan Advanced miRNA

assay (20x) (Applied Biosystems. Inc., CA; USA), 4 μL of
nuclease free water and 5 μL of RT product after a 1:10
dilution. Real-time PCR was carried out on an Applied
BioSystems 7500 Fast thermocycler (Applied Biosystems.
Inc., CA; USA) programmed as follows: 95 °C for 20 s
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s.
We used hsa-miR-21-5p and hsa-miR-26a-5p, two of the
most stable miRNAs in terms of read counts, as a
endogenous controls. All fold-change data were obtained
using the delta-delta CT method (2 − ΔΔCT) 28. Five
differentially expressed miRNAS detected after small
RNA-seq were validated using RT-qPCR (hsa-miR-128-
3p, hsa-miR-6809-5p, hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-151a-5p
and hsa-miR-99a-5p).
Cytokine measurement
We first identified priority cytokine candidates based on
known liver fibrosis pathophysiology and previously
published literature, then selected from the assays available at Myriad-RBM, which were primarily multiplexes
(Luminex, Myriad-RBM Inc., Austin TX). Then purified
EVs from 20 MM and 20 ZZ plasma samples (Table 1),
were suspended in a mixture of water and PBS (1:2).
EVs in solution were lysed using an equal volume of IP
lysis buffer. Lysed EV samples to which Triton X was
added at final concentration of 1% were run on the
MilliPLEX Human High Sensitivity T Cell Magnetic
Bead Panel Luminex kit for measurement of 21 unique
cytokines per plex according to manufacturer’s instructions (EMD Millipore, St. Louis, MO).
Labeling of EVs and uptake
Purified EVs from plasma (109 CD63-positive particles)
were incubated with Fast DiO membrane dye (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 2 μg/mL for 1 h at room
temperature. The purification process of washing and
ultracentrifugation was repeated twice before the labeled
EV pellet was resuspended in PBS [18]. For microscopic
analysis, LX2 cells were incubated with DiO-labeled EVs
for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed with
PBS to remove unbound labeled EVs and subsequently
imaged with a Keyence fully motorized BZ-X800 microscope (KEYENCE America, Chicago, USA).
For flow cytometry analysis, LX2 cells were seeded in
six-well plates and grown overnight and DiO-labeled
EVs (2 × 107
) in 100 μL PBS/well (CD63-positive) were
added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells stained
directly with 1 μL/well DiO (1 μg/mL) served as a
positive control, and unstained cells as a negative
control. Cells were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter
Gallios Flow Cytometer using Kaluza acquisition software and Flow Jo for analysis. Each experimental group
was performed in triplicate.
Co-incubation of human plasma-derived EVs with hepatic
stellate cells
HSCs were plated at the cell concentration of 200,000
per well in 12-well plates. Isolated EVs (pooled from 5
control or AATD individuals (isolated from 250 μL
plasma) were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C [16]. HSCs were incubated with
the same volume of PBS and have been used as negative
control.
Cell migration and proliferation assay
Cell migration was assessed by measuring the repair of a
linear wound generated in the confluent monolayer of cells.
Hepatic stellate cells were (LX-2) plated at an equivalent
density on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Westmont, IL), and
incubated with or without plasma derived EVs for 4 h
before the application of a linear scratch in cell monolayers
using a sterile plastic pipette tip. Cell migration was
recorded for 4, 8, 16 and 24 h using an Applied Precision
deconvolution microscope. To assess the proliferation rate
of the cells, 4 different fields of each condition has been
subjected to cell counting for 4, 8, 16 and 24 h and the
mean values have been recorded as the total number of
cells.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara,
A7603–1), and reversely transcribed through SuperScript
VILO™ kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR
analyses were performed with SensiFAST qPCR Master
Mix (Bioline, Memphis, TN) on a 7500 Real-time PCR
system, Applied Biosystems. Probes used for human Acta2
(Hs00426835_g1), Col1a1 (Hs00164004_m1), Timp1 (Hs
01092512_g1) and LRAT (Hs00428109_m1) detection
were purchased from Thermofisher (Carlsbad, CA).
Immunoblotting
LX-2 cells and iPSc-derived HSCs were seeded at 3 × 105/
well in 6-well plates with or without MM or ZZ plasmaderived EVs for 24 h. Protein levels in the cell lysate homogenates utilizing RIPA buffer were determined using
the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used to
detect total and phospho-IKK [19], p65, p50 [20], total
and phospho-STAT [21], total and phospho-JAK [21] and
GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), CD81 [22], CD63
[23] and TSG101 [24] (Proteintech, Chicago, IL). Proteins
were detected by using a Super Signal West Dura
Extended Duration Substrate Kit from Thermo Scientific.
Immunostaining and immunofluorescence microscopy
LX-2 cell line treated with or without MM or ZZ plasmaderived EVs were grown on glass coverslips. After 24 h,
the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
Khodayari et al. Cell Communication and Signaling (2020) 18:140 Page 4 of 18

20 min. The cells were incubated for 1 h with blocking
buffer at room temperature, followed by incubating
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1:400). The
cells were washed with 1X PBS and incubated for 1 h with
secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse
IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG). Images
were collected using a Keyence fluorescence microscope
(Osaka, Japan). Images were processed for brightness and
contrast and filtered for noise following good practices as
outlined by Rossner and Yamada.
Histology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded liver tissue sections were routinely
de-paraffinized with xylene and a graded series of
ethanol. Some tissue sections were stained with
hematoxylin–eosin (HE) for simple morphological examination. For immunostaining on paraffin-embedded liver
tissues, paraffin blocks were sliced into 5 μm sections,
deparaffinized with xylene, and rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol in water. Antigen retrieval
was achieved by incubation for 20 min in hot (95 °C)
sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and 20 min of cooling at
room temperature. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched
by incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min. Sections
were washed with PBS. Primary antibodies were applied for
60 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After
rinsing the slides in PBS, they were incubated in secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with
PBS, slides were incubated with Vectastain ABC (Vector
Laboratories) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, color
development was achieved by applying diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Vector Laboratories) for two to 5
min. Images were acquired and the signal intensity was
quantified using a Keyence BZ-X700 microscope.
Plasma levels of CRP quantification
Plasma samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10
min to remove fibrin or debris. Samples (100 μL) were
then loaded undiluted and CRP levels measured using
the Cardio Phase hsCRP assay on a Siemens Nephelometer calibrated with the Rheumatology Standard according to manufacturer’s directions. The assay has a range
of 0.1–50 mg/L.
Plasma levels of CXCL10 quantification
CXCL10 levels were measured in the plasma of ZZ
patients with liver disease and MM controls using an
ELISA kit from R&D Systems according to manufacturer’s instruction. Samples were diluted 1:2 in assay
diluent before being applied to the assay plate for 2 h incubation at room temperature. The plate was washed,
Human IP-10 Conjugate added to each well, and the
plate incubated for another 2 h at room temperature.
The plate was washed again and substrate solution
added to each well. The plate was incubated for 30 min
in the dark before adding stop solution. The optical
density was measured using a SpectraMax spectrometer
at 450 nm and the sample concentrations calculated
based on the standard curve.
Liver histology
A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed with a 16 gauge
BioPince™ core biopsy needle after using ultrasonography
to mark the location. The sample was fixed in formalin and
processed for examination. Stains included H&E, trichrome, PAS/PAS + D and Prussian blue. Portal inflammation and hepatocyte degeneration were noted [7].
FibroScan and ultrasound
Liver stiffness measurements (LSM) were performed by
using FibroScan device powered by vibration controlled
transient elastography (Echosens). Two individuals
performed the procedure after training on proper
technique. LSM were considered reliable if the following
three criteria were met: at least 10 valid measurements,
≥60% success rate, IQR/median ≤ 30% [13].
Data analysis
We extracted data on sample size, mean cytokine
concentration, standard deviation (SD), and p-value to
calculate the effective size (ES). The sample size, mean
cytokine concentration, and SD were used to calculate
the ES. Two-sample t test for mean difference with unequal variance was used to test the power of each group
sample size of 20 using the usual significance level
alpha = 0.05. Power analysis and statistical analyses were
performed using SAS and GraphPadPrism 8 software
(San Diego, CA). If cytokine concentration data were
not available, the ESs were generated by sample size and
p-value. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8 by Student
t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Values of P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Power analysis
showed the power of > 0.842.
Results
Isolation and characterization of plasma EVs
EVs were isolated from plasma of 26 control subjects
(MM) and 26 AATD individuals (ZZ) with liver disease
by a combination of filtration and ultracentrifugation
(Fig. 1a) and were characterized by analyses for particle
size, distribution, and concentration using Nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). EVs isolated from both MM and ZZ
groups of subjects were within the normal range for EV
size (30–200 nm in diameter) and the EV recovery from
plasma in ZZ individuals was the same as those in MM
control group (Fig. 1b). Negative staining of classic TEM

demonstrated cup-shaped, round particles (Fig. 1c). The
presence of EV markers was also investigated by western
blot analysis. The results confirmed abundant CD63,
CD81, and TSG101 expression in all EV fractions.
Among detected EV protein markers, TSG101 was
enriched in ZZ plasma derived-EVs compared to EVs
isolated from MM healthy controls (Fig. 1d).
Comparison of EV-associated and plasma cytokines and
chemokines between control and AATD subjects
The diagnosis of AATD individuals was confirmed by
phenotyping and the prevalence of clinically significant
liver disease was determined by liver biopsy. Histologically, insoluble ZAAT proteins are characterized by
globules which stain bright pink with periodic acid–
Schiff’s reagent, which are resistant to diastase treatment
(PAS + D) (Fig. 2a). PAS + D globules present in a highpower field were scored from 0 to 3 as follows: 0-None,
1-Rare: < 5 hepatocytes with globules, 2-Few: 5–20
hepatocytes with globules, 3-Numerous: ≥20 hepatocytes
with globules [7]. IHC staining showed evidence of
aggregated ZAAT in all AATD subjects. After evaluating
PAS + D accumulation in AATD individuals, we
measured CRP levels of healthy control and AATD individuals. The univariate analysis revealed that the AATD
individuals are divided into normal (< 0.4 mg/dL) and
elevated (≥0.4 mg/dL) CRP levels. Approximately onethird of patients (32%) had CRP levels ≥0.4 mg/dL, indicative of inflammation. All healthy controls (100%) had CRP
levels (< 0.4 mg/dL), indicative of a healthy condition with
no sign of inflammation (Fig. 2b). Then, utilizing western
blot analysis we evaluated the presence of AAT protein in
the plasma derived EVs pooled from 4 MM and four ZZ
individuals with PAS + D scores of 3 and found that the
total levels of AAT is higher in EVs isolated from ZZ
individuals. Furthermore, non-denaturing western blot

analysis showed that ZZ plasma derived EVs carry significant amounts of AAT aggregates (Fig. 2c). We also evaluated absolute amounts of each cytokine in the EV fraction
versus the un-encapsulated (soluble) form from 20 MM
and 20 ZZ plasma samples. Distribution of each cytokine
between the free and EV-encapsulated form is a
characteristic of a system, rather than of the cytokines
being secreted by the same pathway in all systems
[25]. We found that in our study groups, the levels of
EV-associated INF- γ, IL1- β, and TNF- α cytokines
were significantly higher in AATD individuals, whereas
there was no difference between the levels of free form of
the same cytokines in the control group. The level of both
free form and EV-associated IL-8 was significantly higher
in AATD individuals (Fig. 2d).
Differential miRNA expression profiles among plasma
derived EV miRNAs from healthy and AATD individuals
To explore the expression profile of miRNAs in plasmaderived EVs from MM and ZZ individuals, we isolated
EVs as previously described. The EVs were then
validated by NTA and electron microscopy analyses. We
then performed high-throughput sequencing of smallRNA transcriptomes (≤50 nt) for miRNA expression
profiles. A total of 869 miRNAs in MM and ZZ groups
were identified at the threshold of > 1 CPM (Counts Per
Million) in at least half of the samples and the whole
distribution of differentially expressed miRNAs was visualized in the volcano plots (Fig. 3a). We identified 44 differentially expressed miRNAs, independent of age and
sex, at thresholds of fold change > 2 and q value < 0.05

in the plasma derived EVs from the healthy MM individuals compared with ZZ individuals. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, 23 were upregulated and 21
were downregulated (Fig. 3b) in the EVs of the ZZ individuals. The top 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were the
hsa-miR-125 family, hsa-miR-335-3p, hsa-miR-339-5p,
hsa-miR-4433b-5p, hsa-miR-130b-5p, hsa-miR-658, hsamiR-6809, and hsa-miR-6510-5p (Table 2). Five differentially expressed miRNAs identified by NGS were validated
using q-PCR (Fig. 3c). As compared to healthy MM
subjects, miR-128-3p, miR-125a-5p and miR-99a-5p were
significantly up-regulated in ZZ subjects. These results are
congruent to the pattern obtained from miRNA sequencing. To examine the potential biological functions of the
select miRNAs, the data was subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The selected genes were then further
grouped into functional categories and plotted as a bar
graph (Fig. 3d). This analysis revealed several different
functional categories including cancer, respiratory disease,
immunological disease, inflammatory response, hepatic
system disease, and others. As in other diseases, certain
miRNAs can participate in different pathophysiological
events in more than one organ, and therefore, it is not
uncommon that IPA analysis reveals additional diseases
besides liver disease that might be associated with certain
miRNAs. Additional enrichment analysis was completed
to further characterize the relationship between dysregulated miRNAs in ZZ plasma derived EVs and HSCs
activation. The results of network analysis are presented
in Fig. 3e. Consistent with our hypothesis, the IPA analysis
revealed molecular networks targeted by miRNAs involved in HSCs activation. The networks contained genes
predicted to be involved in ECM synthesis, Inflammatory
pathways and cellular growth and proliferation.

hepatic stellate cells in vitro
In order to evaluate the interaction and possible uptake
of plasma derived-EVs by cultured HSCs, purified EVs
were labeled with DiO and incubated with the LX-2 cells
[26] for fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry
analysis. Fluorescence microscopy images of the treated
LX-2 cells exhibited green spots or small patches. In
contrast, the HSCs treated with DiO alone showed a
homogeneous green fluorescent staining. HSCs incubated with DiO-labeled EVs were also analyzed by flow

cytometry to provide quantitative measurement of the
above internalization. HSCs treated with DiO-labeled
EVs produced lower fluorescent intensity compared to
cells stained with DiO only (Fig. 4a). Residual dye was
substantially eliminated after a second wash, suggesting
that the signal from DiO EVs was from the DiO associated with EVs. To further evaluate the bioactivity of the
plasma-derived EVs, quiescent LX-2 cells and iPScderived HSCs were incubated with or without MM or
ZZ plasma-derived EVs for 24 h and cell morphology
was monitored by light microscopy. Images taken from
different treatment conditions showed that quiescent
iPSc-derived HSCs incubated with ZZ plasma-derived
EVs exhibited an elongated, fibroblast-like shape after 8
h, indicating an activated state. In contrast, the iPScderived HSCs incubated without EVs or with MM
plasma-derived EVs exhibited a more rounded morphology suggestive of a more quiescent state (Fig. 4b). The
activation status of HSCs was determined by quantifying
α-SMA and Col1A1 mRNA expression, markers of
stellate cell activation [27]. They were found to be
significantly increased by incubation with ZZ plasmaderived EVs after 24 h compared to control and MM
plasma-derived EV treatment (Fig. 4c). Next, we investigated the effect of ZZ plasma-derived EVs on the protein
levels of α-SMA in HSCs using fluorescence microscopy.
Consistent with our findings above, only cells incubated
with ZZ plasma-derived EVs had significant increase of

NF-κB and JAK/STAT-dependent regulation of activation
and migration of HSCs
Although LX-2 cell line enjoys great popularity among
researchers interested in the elucidation of mechanisms
underlying stellate cell biology and liver fibrosis, it
expresses a-SMA, vimentin, GFAP, and PDGFRb suggesting that cell line retains key features of activated/
transdifferentiated HSC. As a consequence, key results
obtained with these cell line should be validated in primary cells if possible [26]. Therefore, to investigate the
signaling pathways likely to be responsible for HSCs activation by ZZ plasma-derived EVs, we quantified the
signaling molecules involved in the canonical NF-κB and
JAK/STAT signaling pathways in iPSC-derived HSCs
treated with or without plasma-derived EVs. At different
timepoints following incubation with no EVs, MM
plasma derived EVs or ZZ plasma derived EVs, HSCs
were subjected to western blot analysis and intracellular
levels of phosphorylated of IKK, which is central to the
NF-κB signaling pathway, and nuclear translocation of
p50 and p65 subunits [28], were measured. Phosphorylation of IKK and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65
subunits were all significantly increased in iPSC-derived
HSCs treated with ZZ plasma-derived EVs compared to
HSCs treated with MM plasma-derived EVs and control
HSCs (Fig. 5a and c). The phosphorylation of JAK and
nuclear STAT1 were also slightly elevated in iPSCderived HSCs treated with ZZ plasma-derived EVs
compared to control groups (Fig. 5b and c). Thus, ZZ
plasma-derived EVs regulate the transition process of
HSCs from a quiescent to activated state through canonical NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Wound
healing assays and cell counting revealed that ZZ
plasma-derived EVs significantly enhanced the migratory
and contractile capacities of LX2 cells (Fig. 5d and e).
Furthermore, HSCs migration and proliferation require
stimulation of the CXCR3 receptor on HSCs with the
CXCL10 ligand [29]. Therefore, we detected the over
expression of CXCL10 mRNA, which is downstream of
the NF-κB signaling pathway, to confirm migratory
augmentation of HSCs after 24 h of incubation with ZZ
plasma-derived EVs by qPCR (Fig. 5f). We have also
confirmed the expression of CXCR3 receptor in our
HSC model (Fig. 5g).
Plasma CXCL10 and EV-associated cytokine levels are
associated with AATD-mediated liver fibrosis in AATD
individuals
It has been shown that the IFN- γ inducible chemokines
CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are up-regulated in
patients with chronic liver diseases, and their serum
levels are closely associated with the degree of hepatic
fibrosis. Among these chemokines which share the
receptor CXCR3, CXCL10 appears to be profibrogenic
by direct effects on HSCs. Within the liver, hepatic
stellate cells express CXCR3 which promotes HSC
migration through interaction with CXCL10 ligand [29].
To further identify the potential association between
CXCR3-associated CXCL10 and HSC activation and migration, we evaluated the plasma levels of CXCL10 in
samples obtained from 44 ZZ individuals and 36 healthy
MM controls. We observed that the mean CXCL10
plasma level was significantly higher among the ZZ individuals compared to the healthy MM group (Fig. 6a).
Among the ZZ individuals, we quantified the association
between activated HSCs by investigating intrahepatic αSMA positive cells as well as fibrosis score and the
plasma levels of CXCL10 in ZZ individuals from whom
biopsy samples were available. As expected, we observed
that the numbers of intrahepatic α-SMA positive cells
and fibrosis score are corelated to the plasma levels of
CXCL10 (Fig. 6b). We also identified correlation
between plasma EV- associated upregulated cytokines
and fibrosis score among the ZZ individuals (Fig. 6c).
Immunohistochemical staining of the liver biopsies from
ZZ individuals demonstrated that those with higher
plasma levels of CXCL10 had substantially greater intrahepatic α-SMA positive cells compared to those with
lower plasma levels (Fig. 6d).
Discussion
In this study 1) Plasma circulating EVs from ZZ
AATD individuals have pathologic immunomodulator
contents; 2) Pro-fibrotic cytokines and microRNAs
are upregulated in ZZ plasma-derived EVs; 3) ZZ
plasma-derived EVs contribute to HSCs activation
and liver inflammation, thus AATD-mediated liver
fibrosis pathology.
Recent studies have shown that in addition to AATDmediated liver disease and lung disease, immune complications and systemic inflammation are also prevalent in
many patients with AATD [30]. It is thought that increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and
immunomodulators released by injured lung and liver
parenchymal cells, is involved in inflammatory liver
diseases physiopathology [31]. Although these secreted
proinflammatory factors play critical roles in intercellular communications, here we focus on the contribution
of EVs as unappreciated cell-cell communication mediators to AATD related liver disease.
In this study, we used serial ultracentrifugation and
filtration to isolate EVs from plasma, which is a state-ofthe-art method that does not modify the original sample.
We used a variety of EV characterization methods based
on morphology, size, number, and expression of EVKhodayari et al. Cell Communication and Signaling (2020) 18:140 Page 11 of 18

enriched proteins. Electron microscopy and NTA analysis showed that EVs isolated from plasma samples are
< 200 nm in size. This particle size is consistent with
previously reported exosome subpopulation size measurements and is in close agreement with EM data.
Western blot analysis revealed that among the surface
molecules on plasma derived-EVs, Tumor Susceptibility
Gene 101 (TSG101) was enriched in the EV population
isolated from the plasma sample of ZZ individuals
compared to controls. Endosomal Sorting Complexes
Required for Transport (ESCRT), such as TSG101
recognize and sort ubiquitinated cargo destined for
lysosomal degradation. The increased levels of TSG101
expression in the EVs from ZZ individuals could be due
to the presence of ZAAT ubiquitinated cargo in ZAAT
expressing cells as we have previously shown [32].

A large body of evidence has supported the involvement of EVs in the protein aggregate spreading, contributing to the disease progression [33]. We observed that
AATD individuals exhibited a significant amount of
AAT aggregates in plasma derived EVs providing evidence of their pathogenic potential. AAT is primarily
produced by hepatocytes. Presence of AAT aggregates in
plasma EVs shows that injured hepatocytes are one of
the major sources of plasma EVs in AATD individuals.
In our study and consistent with previous studies [34],
elevated levels of CRP indicate a systemic inflammatory
state in AATD individuals compared to control. Elevated
cytokine levels are one of the characteristics of chronic
immune system activation [35]. AAT is a known acutephase protein with important anti-inflammatory and
immune-modulating properties. Hence, considering the
immune-modulating function of AAT an immune activation plays a role in the inflammation of different tissues especially lungs in individuals with AATD [36].
While cytokine levels in the plasma of AATD individuals
have been the subject of investigation, the results presented here demonstrate that a significant number of cytokines/chemokines are not released in free form but are
associated with EVs. Given the increased stability of
molecules carried by enclosed membrane compartments
such as EVs [37], it is plausible that association of cytokines and chemokines with EVs would imply their increased half-life, as well as their wider distribution to
specific target cells and organs distal from the producer
cells. The higher concentration of EV associated INF- γ,
IL1- β, TNF- α and IL-8 in the plasma of AATD individuals indicates a potentially significant role of EVs in mediating the effect of these cytokines on recipient cells.
These data also indicate that activated immune cells
from different tissues such as lungs can be the other
source of plasma EVs in AATD individuals. These cytokines are initiators of acute phase inflammatory response
in the liver, including apoptosis of hepatocytes, steatosis
and inflammation as well as activation of HSCs [38].
Our result show that the plasma levels of EV-associated
proinflammatory cytokines such as INF- γ, IL1- β, TNFα are correlated with the fibrosis levels of the liver in
AATD individuals. Thus, it demonstrates that EVs associated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with progression of liver inflammation in AATD individuals.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, non-coding, RNA that
function as regulatory molecules and are involved in a
series of vital processes and in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated
the significant role of miRNA in liver diseases [39]. It
has been also shown that there is a correlation between
the expression of inflammatory miRNAs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and severity of lung disease
in AATD individuals [40]. In this study plasma
circulating EV-associated miRNAs were profiled in
healthy MM individuals compared to ZZ individuals
with liver disease. The expression pattern of plasma circulating EV-associated miRNAs is substantially different
in AATD mediated liver disease. These miRNAs are
consistent with known characteristics of ZZ individuals
with liver disease such as HSCs activation, fibrosis and
cirrhosis, and HCC which shows the possibility of using
EVs as a potential source of biomarkers for early diagnosis of disease progression. Importantly, we identified that
of the 44 miRNAs whose levels change in the plasma
EVs of AATD individuals, 5 which were higher in AATD
individuals (miR-125a, miR-125b1, miR-125b2, miR-128
and miR-130b) and 1 lower (miR-6809) appear to play
important roles in liver fibrosis [41–45]. A large body of
evidence supports the implication of the miR-125 family
and miR-130b [46] in different liver diseases, including
ALF [47], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [48], cholestasis [49], and HCC [50]. miR-125b has been also shown
to have a central role in the regulation of HSC’s transdifferentiation during liver fibrogenesis and a promotive
function in HSC activation and production of α-SMA
during the progression of liver fibrosis [41]. Furthermore, increased expression of miR-128 has also been observed during liver fibrosis and found to be associated
with chemokines and chemokine receptors regulating inflammation during fibrosis [51]. Other miRNAs are concomitant with liver homeostasis, including miR-6809-5p
that has been shown to play a role in suppressing HCC
cell growth. miR-6809-5p directly targets the FLOT1
gene through inhibiting signaling pathways including
JNK and NF-κB/p65 [44]. Our IPA analysis results consistent with our hypothesis, also revealed NF-κB molecular network is being targeted by a group of differentially
expressed miRNAs (Supplementary Figure 2).
Downregulation of flotillin protein in human monocytes and fibroblasts also impairs collagen uptake by
promoting lysosomal degradation of the endocytic collagen receptors, a characteristic of many fibrotic diseases
like liver fibrosis [52]. Such an alteration in circulating
miRNA profile could be used to evaluate the risk of developing liver disease in AATD individuals, which may
improve prediction and prevention among individuals at
high risk of the disease.
In liver fibrosis, altered cellular cross-talk is a key
feature of pathological wound healing and fibroblast
activation and proliferation [53]. In this study, we
describe that activated immune cells resulting from
AATD-mediated immune complications and injured hepatocytes are a source of pro-inflammatory EVs and
demonstrate paracrine effects of EVs on HSCs activation
and trans-differentiation. Similarly, colangiocyte-derived
EVs were found to promote HSC activation and cholestatic liver fibrosis [54]. HSCs are pericyte-like cells in
Khodayari et al. Cell Communication and Signaling (2020) 18:140 Page 14 of 18

the space of Dissé (located between hepatic sinusoidal
endothelial cells and hepatocytes), and they are usually
in the quiescent state. However, HSCs which undergo
trans-differentiation and activation are characterized by
increased migratory capacity and deposition of extracellular matrix components during liver inflammation [55].
Extracellular signals from injured resident epithelial cells
and inflammatory cells further play an important role in
modulating HSC activation [56]. EVs are increasingly
implicated in a variety of liver pathobiological conditions, including liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and
HCC [57]. Our study adds to these existing models by
showing a role for plasma circulating EVs in signaling
relevant to AATD-mediated liver fibrosis through mechanistic studies that elucidate possible signaling pathways
involved in EV-mediated HSC activation.
Many immunomodulators, including TNFα and IL-1β,
promote activation of HSCs by stimulating nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) and downregulating pro-apoptotic
genes [58–61]. NF-κB represents a family of inducible
transcription factors, which regulates a large group of
genes involved in different processes of the immune and
inflammatory responses. The primary mechanism for
canonical NF-κB activation is nuclear translocation of
the NF-κB executor transcription factors. This process
subsequently activates the transcription of many proinflammatory genes [28]. Here, our western blot analysis
revealed the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65
transcription factors in HSCs treated with ZZ plasmaderived EVs. Furthermore, similar results were obtained
by examining the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HSCs
treated with ZZ plasma-derived EVs compared to no
treatment or treatment with healthy MM plasmaderived EVs. We found that ZZ plasma-derived EVs
elevated the nuclear levels of phosphorylated STAT-1
and JNK, indicating activation of JAK/STAT pathway.
The perpetuation phase of HSC activation overlaps with
the signals of survival, migration, proliferation, fibrogenesis, and retention of an activated phenotype as the
injury stimulus persists and activates critical pathways of
HSC proliferation/migration such as the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway [59].
Cell migration is a crucial step in the development and
aggravation of several diseases, from organ fibrosis to
cancer. Persistent HSCs migration contributes to the
progression of fibrotic areas in the liver, resulting in excessive tissue remodeling and fibrotic scarring [62].
Therefore, we evaluate the migration of HSCs treated
with or without ZZ plasma-derived EVs compared to
healthy MM plasma-derived EVs. Our migration study
based on a wound healing assay revealed that HSC’s migratory function and proliferation rate are augmented by
incubation with ZZ plasma-derived EVs compared to
control. Interestingly, quantitative PCR analysis showed
upregulation of CXCL10 in the activated HSCs, consistent with our ELISA results showing elevated plasma
levels of CXCL10 in AATD individuals compared to
control population. Previous studies have shown that
CXCL10 stimulation of the CXCR3 receptor leads to migration of primary HSCs [29, 63]. It has also been reported that IFN- γ induces CXCL10 expression through
activation of JAK/STAT-1a pathway [64, 65], which is
also activated in HSCs treated with ZZ plasma-derived
EVs in our study. Thus, IFN- γ associated with EVs from
ZZ plasma-derived EVs may contribute to induction of
CXCL10 production by activated HSCs, regulating their
migratory function in an autocrine effect. In response to
their activation HSCs show an intense cytoplasmic αSMA immunoreactivity. α-SMA is a specific marker for
activated HSCs that show a myofibroblastic phenotype
[66]. α-SMA-positive HSCs are responsible for fibrotic
tissue accumulation in human chronic liver disease and
correlate with the extent of fibrosis [67]. Our data agree
with the models of fibrogenesis proposed by several
authors where the activation of HSCs is the central event
in hepatic fibrosis and shows that the number of αSMA-positive HSCs mildly correlates with plasma levels
of CXCL10 in AATD individuals enrolled in our study.
On the other hand, our data suggests that during phases
of hepatic insult, activated HSCs may amplify the
response to liver injury producing pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as CXCL10.
While various imaging modalities are widely used for
assessment of liver fibrosis, these techniques lack sensitivity and specificity for early stages of fibrosis and are
not able to determine liver inflammation and hepatocellular injury [68]. Studies have shown that sampling errors alone causes a diagnostic error greater than one
stage of fibrosis in as high as in 33.1% of the biopsy samples from liver patients [69]. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of liver fibrosis, a biopsy may not reflect the
entire liver and therefore individual biopsies often
missed fibrotic areas present elsewhere. Processing of
tissue samples, including fixation and paraffin embedding, may also limit subsequent molecular analysis. Finally, tissue biopsy limits tissue analysis to a single point
in time, whereas a time series measurement of fibrosis of
the same individual to monitor fibrosis progression is
helpful to track the potential response to the treatment
[68]. Therefore, now is the time to develop innovative
ways that may perhaps replace biopsy as an invasive gold
standard for comparisons, and come up with more precise and noninvasive novel metrics to evaluate fibrosis
levels. For example, Liquid biopsy, referring to analysis
of patient liquid specimens such as blood instead of
surgical biopsy specimens, offers the promise of diagnosis in a less invasive manner. With the progress in the
novel therapies for various chronic liver diseases, the
Khodayari et al. Cell Communication and Signaling (2020) 18:140 Page 15 of 18

development of liquid biopsy tools has evolved into a
key priority in the field of hepatology such as AATDmediated liver disease. Non-invasive reliable biomarkers
that can supplement and eventually replace invasive liver
biopsy are crucial for selection of the high risk AATD
patient and monitoring their liver condition. Circulating
EVs have emerged as attractive liquid biopsy candidates
because their cargo contains many of the key characteristics of an ideal biomarker [68]. In this study we successfully isolated and purified EVs from AATD plasma
with a ZZ genotype and healthy MM individuals, which
were characterized by various approaches to prove the
high quality of the isolated EVs.
Conclusion
Our study presents evidence for a new role of plasma
circulating EVs in modulating the immune response of
the liver through HSC activation (Fig. 7). Therefore,
plasma circulating EVs may represent a target for antiinflammatory therapy in liver fibrosis. This is related to
the fact that plasma-derived EVs contain dysregulated
immunomodulator contents, such as cytokines and miRNAs, in AATD individuals. This later finding is important since there are very few human studies in the
literature that evaluated biomolecular cargo of plasma
EVs as biomarkers of liver disease. We are aware of no
studies evaluating plasma-derived EV cargo for
biomarkers of AATD-mediated liver disease. Further
studies should be conducted to validate some candidate
prognostic markers in a separate cohort of AATD individuals and confirm the functional roles of EVs in the
AATD-mediated liver disease. More patients should be
included to reduce bias and enhance the reproducibility
and reliability of the study, particularly for proteomic
analysis. Limited sample size may compromise the
robustness.

Fig. 7 Plasma derived EV mediated liver fibrosis in AATD individuals. EVs are small vesicular structures that are shed by different cells and provide
various autocrine and paracrine signaling cues. AATD mediated immune complications, such as lung disease, panniculitis, cardiovascular risks, and
mesangial-capillary glomerulonephritis suggest a contribution from a variety of activated immune cells as well as parenchymal cells. EVs released
by activated immune cells and injured parenchymal cells carry a pro-fibrotic cargo with the ability to promote liver fibrosis through activation of
HSCs. AATD plasma derived EVs induced HSC trans differentiation and activation leading to deposition of ECM and fibrotic phenotype
