Abstract
Identifying influential nodes in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such
as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding
hierarchical organization of social and biological networks. Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree,
closeness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already
take into account the influences of a node’s neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it’s
neighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically
that it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking
algorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors’ influences,
but also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant
infectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale
short-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such
as PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority
of ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only
making use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with
about 107 nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.

Introduction
With great theoretical and practical significance, the studies on
epidemic and information spreading in biological, social and
technological networks become one of the most exciting domains
in many branches of sciences [1–4]. Therein how to control the
spreading process is of particular interests [5], where the
identification of influential nodes is a crucial issue according to
the assumption that highly influential nodes are more likely to be
infected and to infect a larger number of nodes [6–8].
A number of centrality indices have been proposed to address
this problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality [9],
betweenness centrality [10], and eigenvector centrality [11].
Degree centrality is a straightforward and efficient metric but less
relevant. Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes
have positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks
[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play
a more important role than its degree. For example, a node
located in the center of the network, having a few highly influential
neighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger
number of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak
et al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core
decomposition to quantify a node’s influence based on the
assumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence
and nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.
This method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all
nodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence
according to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically
organized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have
much higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semilocal index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which
can well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give
more elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental
results demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as
global indices while has much lower computational complexity,
and thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.
Recently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number
and path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in
networks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.
The ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with
some well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and
LeaderRank.

With explosive data growth, the design of efficient and effective
ranking algorithms on very large-scale networks is becoming a big
challenge nowadays [16]. The representative methods include the
well-known HITs [17] and PageRank [18], as well as some
recently proposed algorithms like LeaderRank [7,19] and
TwitterRank [20]. All these algorithms are diffusion based (or
say random-walk based), with a common assumption that a node is
expected to be of high influence if it points to many highly
influential neighbors (here, a link from i to j indicates that j is a
follower of i). It has been demonstrated that these methods
outperform out-degree centrality in terms of ranking effectiveness.
In addition to the direct influential scores of neighbors, the
interactions among neighbors may also play a significant role. The
density of interactions among neighbors can be characterized by
the local clustering coefficient [21], which has great impacts on
network dynamics, such as game theory [12,13,22–24], cascading
[25], synchronization [26,27] and spreading [28–31]. Empirical
analysis also shows that nodes with smaller clustering have higher
ability to attract new connections [32,33].
Keeping this in mind, in this paper, we propose a local ranking
method, named ClusterRank, to identify influential nodes in
directed networks by taking into account the effects of local
clustering on information propagation. Besides the localization of
our algorithm, another distinguishable difference from the abovementioned diffusion-based algorithms is that the clustering
coefficient is directly involved in the definition of a node’s
influence in ClusterRank. We apply the SIR spreading model with
constant infectivity to test the effectiveness of our method on four
real networks, including two large-scale directed networks (a social
network extracted from delicious.com consisting of 6|105 nodes and
a short-message communication network containing about 107
nodes) and two undirected networks (one is collaboration network
from condensed matter e-print archive consisting of about 3|104
nodes [34] and the other is an undirected version of the social
network from delicious.com). Experimental results show that
ClusterRank performs much better than the simplest degree
centrality, and the top-L influential nodes identified by ClusterRank lead to much wider and faster spreading than those by
PageRank or LeaderRank. Besides, the computations of ClusterRank on the network with 10 millions of nodes can be finished in
191 seconds by using C#.net language on a Core II 2.0 GHZ
CPU processor with 2 GB memory, more than 15 times faster
than PageRank algorithm.
Materials and Methods
1.1 Empirical Analysis
Many social networks can be represented by directed networks
where a link from i to j means j is a follower of i, indicating that j
receives information from i. We denote Ci as the set of followers of
i and the density of interactions among i’s followers can be
characterized by the local clustering coefficient of i. Based on the
original definition of clustering coefficient [21], the clustering
coefficient of node i in a directed network is extended as:
ci~DfejkDj, k[CigD
kout
i (kouti {1) , ð1Þ
where kout
i is the out-degree of i, namely the number of followers
of i, and fejkDj, k[Cig is the set of links connecting two of i’s
followers. Let ci~0 if kout
i ƒ1. According to Eq. (1), a reciprocal
link j<k is counted as two separate links j?k and k?j.
The local clustering has remarkable impacts on network
structure and functions. Studying the effects of clustering
coefficient on the network evolving can provide insights into the
understanding of growing mechanism and further help us to
design better link prediction algorithms [35–37] and to explain the
observation on information spreading through online social
networks [30]. Some literatures showed that the clustering has
negative correlation with degree in undirected networks [38] or
with total degree in directed networks [39]. Here, we take two real
evolving networks as examples to analyze the effect of clustering
coefficient. One is a collaboration network from condensed matter
e-print archive (Cond-mat for short) [34], the other is a shortmessage communication network (SM for short) from a mobile
company in eastern China city. For each network, we consider two
snapshots which contain the data starting from a given date (T0)
but ending with different dates (i.e., T1 and T2 respectively).
Specifically, the first network of Cond-mat is from Jan. 1st, 1995
(T0) to Dec. 13th, 1999 (T1) containing 16264 nodes and 47594
links, and the second network of Cond-mat is from Jan. 1, 1995
(T0) to Jun. 30, 2003 (T2) containing 30460 nodes and 120029
links. Similarly, for SM, the first network consists of the data from
Dec. 8th to Dec. 17th, 2010 with 3612863 nodes and 7472808
links, and the second network is from Dec. 8th, 2010 to Jan. 6th,
2011 with 9193545 nodes and 22901318 links. Here, Cond-mat is
undirected and SM is directed where a link from i to j represents
that i has sent at least one message to j.
In the first network (from T0 to T1), we denote N(k) the set of
nodes with degree k. Without specific statement, a node’s degree
in a directed network stands for its out-degree. Note that, we here
only consider the nodes with degrees larger than 1. Denote Q(k)
the set of node pairs (i,j) such that civcj and ki~kj~k, clearly,
DQ(k)Dƒ1
2 DN(k)D(DN(k)D{1). For each pair (i,j)[Q(k), there are
three cases according to i’s and j’s degrees (denoted by ~ki and ~
kj)
in the second network (from T0 to T2): (i) ~
kiw~kj indicating that the
node with lower clustering coefficient attracts more connections
during the period T1?T2; (ii) ~
kiv~kj indicating that the node with
higher clustering coefficient attracts more connections during the
period T1?T2; (iii) ~
ki~~kj indicating that these two nodes have
the same ability to attract new connections. Accordingly, we define
a score fk to see whether nodes with lower clustering coefficients
have higher ability to attract more connections. It mathematically
reads
fk~ 1
DQ(k)D
X
(i,j)[Q(k)
hij, ð2Þ
where hij is the score depending on the aforementioned cases, as
hij~
1, ~kiw~
kj
{1, ~kiv~kj
0, ~ki~~kj
:
8
><
>:
ð3Þ
Obviously, fkw0 indicates that nodes having lower clustering
coefficients are more likely to attract new connections than those
(with the same degree) having higher clustering coefficients, while
fkv0 is the opposite situation. The correlation between fk and
degree k is shown in figure 1 where the area of a circle is
proportional to the number of nodes with the corresponding
degree. As shown in figure 1, in Cond-mat, fk is larger than zero
for 2ƒkv20 which covers 95% of all nodes with degree larger

than 1 and in SM, fk is larger than zero for 2ƒkv5 which covers
60.3% of all nodes with degree larger than 1. In addition, for small
k, the statistics are more reliable since the number of samples is
large while fk displays large fluctuations for large k where the
statistics are less reliable due to the limited statistical samples. The
majority of node pairs with positive fk indicates that a node with
smaller clustering coefficient statistically has higher ability to
attract new connections. In figure 2, we show the increment of
degree, Dk, from T1 to T2. These nodes are of the same degree
(k~5) but different clustering coefficients at time T1. Generally
speaking, Dk decreases with the increasing of clustering. In a word,
the above empirical results (see figures 1 and 2) demonstrate that a
node with smaller clustering coefficient is likely to attract more
connections in the future.
1.2 Cluster Rank Algorithm
Based on the empirical observation, we here propose a local
ranking index, named ClusterRank, to quantify the influence of a
node by taking into account not only its direct influence (measured
by the number of its followers) and influences of its neighbors, but
also its clustering coefficient. Mathematically, the ClusterRank
score si of node i is defined as:
si~f (ci)
X
j[Ci
(kout
j z1), ð4Þ
where the term f (ci) accounts for the effect of i’s local clustering
and the term ‘+1’ results from the contribution of j itself. Usually,
the local clustering plays a negative role in spreading [28,29,40]
since if i’s followers closely interact with each other rather than
with other nodes, the spreading initiated from node i is more likely
to be confined in a local region. On the contrary, if i’s neighbors
are mostly connected with nodes other than i’s neighbors, the
information will quickly spread to a large scope. For example, in
figure 3, although node 0 has the same out-degree with node 37,
node 37, with lower clustering, is of higher influence than node 0,
since most of node 37’s neighbors point to nodes other than
themselves and thus can send the information to wide audiences.
We here adopt a simple exponential function, namely
f (ci)~10{ci , a decreasing function of ci. Actually, we can apply
a more complicated form by introducing a new parameter, such as
a{ci or ca
i . However, it adds little value to rank nodes but make
the analysis more complicated. Indeed, the perspective and results
of this paper are not limited by a very specific function of ci.
For comparison, we briefly introduce two benchmark ranking
algorithms on directed networks, PageRank [18] and LeaderRank
[7]. PageRank is depicted as a random walk on hyperlinked
networks. Each web page (i.e., a node) is assigned a score
according to its relative importance. A parameter c is introduced
as the probability for which a web page surfers to jump to a
random web page, and for probability 1{c a web page surfers to
continue browsing through hyperlinks. Therefore, in our case the
score si(t) for node i at time step t is given by:
si(t)~cz(1{c)
XN
j~1
aij
kin
j
1{dkin
j ,0  z
1
N dkin
j ,0 " #sj(t{1), ð5Þ
where kin
j is the in-degree of node j (i.e., the number of leaders of
node j), N is the number of nodes of the network, aij~1 if there
exists a link from i to j (indicating the information flow is from i to
j), otherwise aij~0, and dkin
j ,0~1 if kin
j ~0, otherwise dkin
j ,0~0.
Initially, si(0) is set to be 1 for each node i, and the parameter c is
always fixed as 0.15 in the experiments.
LeaderRank is also a random-walk-based ranking algorithm [7].
On the basis of PageRank, LeaderRank introduces a ground node
g, which has two directed links egi and eig to every node i in the
original network, so that the network will become strongly
connected. The score si(t) of node i at time t is given by
(according to a purely random walk process):
si(t)~
N
Xz1
j~1
aij
kin
j
sj(t{1): ð6Þ
Initially, sg(0)~0 for the ground node g, and si(0)~1 for every
other node i. At the steady state, the score of the ground node is
equally distributed to all other nodes to conserve scores on the
nodes of interest. Therefore, the final score of node i, called its
leadership score, is defined as
Si~si(t?)zsg(t?)
N , ð7Þ

where si(t?) is the score of node i in the steady state according to
Eq. (6). Notice that, although LeaderRank is similar to PageRank,
it is able to dig out more influential nodes and is more stable to
noise and more robust to attacks than PageRank [7]. More
significantly, LeaderRank is a parameter-free ranking method.
Comparing with PageRank, LeaderRank just introduces a small
modification yet leads to considerable improvements.
1.3 Data Description
To evaluate influences of different groups of top-ranked nodes
respectively obtained by out-degree centrality, PageRank, LeaderRank, k-core decomposition and ClusterRank, experiments are
carried out on two real directed social networks and two
undirected networks. (i) Delicious: a directed social network
extracted from the web site delicious.com, where the primary
function of users is to collect useful bookmarks with tags. Users can
select other users to be their ‘‘opinion leaders’’ of web browsing, in
the sense that the bookmarks of the leaders are often useful and
relevant. The subscriptions to leaders’ bookmarks can be made
automatically. Of course users who select their leaders can in turn
be the leaders of others. In that way, the users form a large-scale
directed social network with information flows from leaders to
followers. (ii) SM: a directed short-message communication
network of a mobile company in 31 days from Dec. 8th, 2010
to Jan. 7th, 2011. In this network, each node corresponds to a
mobile phone number, and a link from i to j means that i has sent
at least one short message to j during these 31 days. We are
interested in this data set because the information such as rumor
may spread out in this communication network via message
forwarding and influential spreaders play an important role in the
Figure 2. The increment of degree Dk in the period T1?T2 of nodes with the same degree (k~5) but different clustering coefficients
at time T1. Dk is the average value of a bin (size = 0.1) on clustering coefficient. For example, the value of Dk corresponding to c~0:1 is the average
value of Dk of the nodes with clustering coefficient in (0:05,0:15. The error bars stand for standard errors.

spreading process. (iii) Cond-mat: a collaboration network of
scientists who have posted preprints on the condensed matter
archive at www.arxiv.org between Jan. 1st, 1995 and Jun. 30th,
2003. In this network, a node represents an author, and an edge
connecting two authors if they have co-authorized at least one
paper. The academic perspectives and the news of academic
activities may propagate in this collaboration network and some
key authors play the central role in the propagation. (iv)
DeliciousUN: the undirected version of Delicious network where
the directed links are transformed into undirected links. Some
basic statistical features of these four networks, including the
number of nodes, the number of links, maximum out-degree (or
maximum degree for undirected network) kmax, average outdegree (or average degree for undirected network) SkT and
average clustering coefficient ScT, are shown in Table 1.
Results
2.1 Evaluation on Directed Networks
The computation times of four ranking algorithms on Delicious
and SM networks are shown in Table 2. Out-degree is the fastest
with runtime less than a second. Comparing with the diffusionbased methods (i.e., PageRank and LeaderRank), the time
complexity of ClusterRank is much lower (a magnitude reduction).
Therefore, the ClusterRank may be a promising method for very
large-scale networks.
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is usually used to
mimic the spreading processes of disease where infected nodes will
either get immunity or die [41]. Individuals in SIR model are
classified in three classes according to their states: susceptible (will
not infect others but can be infected), infected (have infectivity),
recovered (recovered from the illness and got immunity thus will
not take part in the epidemic process, or died and thus removed
from the systems). The simulation runs in discrete time steps. At
each time step, every infected node randomly selects a follower
and transmit the information or disease to her with probability m if
this follower is a susceptible one. At the same time, each infected
node recovers with probability b, and the infected rate l is defined
as m=b. The simulation stops when there is no infected node
anymore. Notice that this model is slightly different from the
standard SIR model where all the followers of an infected node
have the chance to be infected. The present mechanism is usually
used to mimic the limited spreading capability of individuals
[42,43].
To investigate the ability of identifying influential nodes of a
ranking method, we focus on top-L ranked nodes by out-degree
centrality. Here we set L = 20 and 50 as two examples. The ranks
of these L nodes by other ranking methods can be obtained via
selecting them from the whole ranking lists. Then we can calculate
the correlation between each pair of ranking methods by Kendall’s
tau, as shown in Table 3. It can be seen that LeaderRank and
PageRank are highly correlated. The correlation between
ClusterRank and out-degree centrality is low in Delicious while
relatively high in SM, this is because of the small clustering
coefficient of SM which makes f (ci) play little role in Eq. (4). For
the L nodes with maximal out-degrees, we also investigate the
correlation between the ranking scores provided by different
methods and the real spreading abilities, see Table 4. The ratio
between the number of infected and recovered nodes and the total
number of nodes at time t, denoted by F(t), can be considered as
an indicator to evaluate the influence at time t. Clearly, F(t)
increases with t, and eventually gets steady. The final coverage
Fi
(tc) of node i is used to represent the real spreading ability of i
where i is set to be infected initially. Higher Fi
(tc) indicates higher
influence of node i. Overall speaking, the Kendall’s tau for
ClusterRank is the largest.
To investigate the influence of a group of nodes in information
spreading, we initially set these nodes to be infected. We use the
steady value, F(tc), to evaluate the eventual influence of these
initially infected nodes. Higher F(tc) indicates higher influence.
We choose the top-L (this paper considers L~20 and L~50)
ranked nodes, which are respectively identified by out-degree
centrality, PageRank, LeaderRank and ClusterRank, and set them
as initially infected nodes in the experiments. Figure 4 compares
F(t) with the top-L ranked nodes as the initially infected ones by
out-degree, PageRank, LeaderRank and ClusterRank for Delicious and SM networks. From figure 4, one can see that the initial
seeds obtained by ClusterRank result in faster and wider spreading
than by other ranking methods.
Since there are a considerable number of overlapped nodes in
top-ranked lists of any two algorithms (see Table 5), we next

compare the spreading processes resulted from non-overlapped
nodes in the top-ranked lists. That is, each time when we compare
the ClusterRank and another algorithm, the nodes appeared in
only one list are set to be the initially infected ones. For example,
for Delicious, considering the top-20 lists for out-degree centrality
and ClusterRank, there are 8 non-overlapped nodes, we compare
the spreading processes respectively resulted from the 8 nodes
appeared only in the list by ClusterRank and the 8 nodes appeared
only in the list by out-degree centrality. Figure 5 shows the ratio
between the total number of infected and recovered nodes of
ClusterRank and those of the other ranking algorithms, namely
FClusterRank(t)=F(t), where FClusterRank(t) is the ratio of the total
number of infected and recovered nodes to all nodes at time t for
ClusterRank, and F(t) stands for the corresponding quantity of
the compared algorithm (i.e., out-degree centrality, PageRank or
LeaderRank). Therefore, the degree to which FClusterRank(t)=F(t)
exceeds 1 indicates how much better ClusterRank performs than
other methods. From figure 5, one can see that in most cases the
ratio is obviously larger than 1.
Figure 6 shows F(tc) resulted from the top-50 most influential
nodes at different infected rates l. It can be seen that F(tc) resulted
from the top-50 most influential nodes by ClusterRank is larger
than that by other ranking algorithms. Figure 7 shows the ratio of
the number of ever infected (i.e., finally recovered) nodes resulted
from top-ranked nodes by ClusterRank to those by other ranking
algorithms at different infected rates l. Note that, in figure 7, only
non-overlapped node appeared in the top-50 lists by ClusterRank
and other ranking algorithms are initially set to be infected. The
ratio is up to 2 when l~1:4 for Delicious network (see figure 7(a))
and it approaches 20 (surprisingly high) when l~1:9 for SM
network (see figure 7(b)). In fact, some nodes in the SM network
are of very large out-degree but the out-degree of their followers
are very small. These nodes are not as important as their outdegrees indicate, and ClusterRank could dig out really influential

Here we focus on the ranks of the top-L (L= 20 and 50) nodes with maximal
out-degrees. We abbreviate ClusterRank, LeaderRank, PageRank and Outdegree centrality by CR, LR, PR and DR, respectively.

nodes and assign the high-degree-yet-low-influence nodes low
ranks.
2.2 Evaluation on Undirected Networks
Above analyses show that ClusterRank is more effective than
other well-known ranking methods such as out-degree centrality,
PageRank and LeaderRank, in directed networks. In this
subsection, we will further show the superiority of ClusterRank
on undirected networks by comparing it with degree centrality and
k-core decomposition. Here, we don’t consider PageRank and
LeaderRank because they all degenerate to degree centrality in
undirected networks. We use two types of initialization for SIR
experiments. In the first case, we directly set the top-L (we set
L~50 in the experiment) ranked non-overlapped nodes to be
initially infected regardless of how they connect with each other.
The selection method for initial seeds is similar to what we have
used in figure 5. In the second case, we only consider a group of
nodes with no connection between any two of them as initial seeds.
Specifically, there are two steps. In the first step, for each ranking
method, we select L nodes who are highly ranked nodes but not
connected with each other according to the following process: (i)
Select the top ranked node v in the current network; (ii) Remove v
and all her neighbors from the network; (iii) Repeat step (i) and
step (ii) until L nodes have been selected. The second step is to
identify the non-overlapped nodes between ClusterRank and other
compared methods. For more details of how to select the initial
seeds, readers could refer to Ref. [44].
Figure 8 shows the dependence of FClusterRank(tc)=F(tc) on l
for the undirected Delicious network and Cond-mat network,
where FClusterRank(tc) is the ratio of the total number of infected
and recovered nodes to all nodes at time tc for ClusterRank, and
F(tc) stands for the corresponding quantity of degree centrality or
k-core decomposition. For the first case, see figures 8(a) and 8(c),
the eventually infected size of ClusterRank is larger than that of
degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In DeliciousUN, the

largest value for k-core decomposition is 3.97 which is about 2.5
times larger than that for degree centrality. This reminds us that as
a group of initial infected nodes, k-core decomposition may
perform even worse than degree centrality [6], since the selected
nodes identified by k-core decomposition are usually in the same
core and thus densely connected with each other while the nodes
selected by degree centrality or ClusterRank are usually located at
different cores and thus sparsely connected. Apparently, ClusterRank is much more advanced than degree centrality. Similar
results are also found in Cond-mat network, see figure 8(c). Note
that, Cond-mat network is highly clustered with clustering
coefficient ScT~0:6461, because there are many cliques each of
which is constituted by a group of co-authors of a paper. Therefore
the authors whose collaborators closely collaborate with each other
will be highly depressed by ClusterRank due to their high
clustering coefficients. The researcher with diverse collaborators
who are usually belong to different communities will be more
influential than those who only collaborates with people in one
community. For the second case, with the consideration of the
nodes that are not directly connected with each other the
performance of k-core decomposition is improved. Specifically,
in DeliciousUN, ClusterRank performs much better than degree
centrality especially for the middle region of l and better than that
of k-core decomposition for 1:0ƒlƒ1:7. In Cond-mat network,
the results of ClusterRank are still better than degree centrality
and k-core decomposition in the middle region of l, and for other
region, their performances are comparable. The investigations for
very small or very large infected probability l are meaningless.
When l is too small (e.g., lv1), it will be hardly spread out from
any group of initial nodes, and for large l, most of the nodes will
get infected and thus the difference resulted from initialization will
become less significant. The results shown in figure 8 demonstrate
that ClusterRank also performs better than degree centrality and
k-core decomposition in undirected networks.
Discussion
Identifying most influential nodes in very large-scale directed
networks is a key issue in network analysis, disease control, and so
on. An effective and efficient ranking algorithm is proposed in this

paper which emphasizes the negative effects of local clustering on
spreading dynamics. Experimental results on Delicious and SM
networks demonstrate that the information can spread more
quickly and broadly from top-L nodes obtained by our method
than that by out-degree centrality, PageRank or LeaderRank.
Furthermore, the method presented in this paper can be easily
extended to undirected networks, for which PageRank and
LeaderRank all degenerate to degree centrality. Experiments on
the Cond-mat and undirected Delicious networks show that the
performance of our method is also better than that of degree
centrality and k-core decomposition for undirected networks.
How to effectively and efficiently identify influential nodes in
very large-scale networks is a long-standing challenge. Lastly we
list some open issues that may become the near-future focuses in
this field. (1) Algorithms from general to specific. With
different motivations and requirements, the ranking methods
should be different. In our paper, we applied SIR model to
evaluate the ranking performance, which actually implies that we
want to find influential nodes for this specific dynamic process–the
information spreading in the SIR matter. With this motivation, we
find that ClusterRank is very effective. Some recent studies [30,45]
showed that in the presence of social reinforcement, the clustering
may to some extent accelerate behavior propagation in online
social networks. In this case, or the cases asking for critical nodes in
synchronization and transportation, the ClusterRank may not be
as effective as in the current case (or may be even more powerful).
In real systems, users may have different preference on different
topics, a topic-related ranking method will be more appropriate
[46]. Furthermore, different individuals may influence other
individuals through different relationships, how to make use of
profiles of individuals in ranking algorithms is also interesting and
challenging [8]. (2) Algorithms on disparate types of
networks. With different network structures, suitable ranking
methods might also be different. Besides the simple undirected and
directed networks, ranks are required for more complicated
networks including weighted networks [47], bipartite networks,
multi-level networks, temporal networks [48], networks with
community structure [49], and so on. Some progress has been
made in this direction [50], but systematic analyses are still
lacking.
