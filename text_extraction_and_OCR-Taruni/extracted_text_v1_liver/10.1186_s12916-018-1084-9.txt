Abstract
Background: Existing evidence remains inconclusive as to the association between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We prospectively examined the association between chronic
HBV infection and CKD risk, and the joint associations of HBV infection with established risk factors of several
lifestyle factors and prevalent diseases on CKD risk.
Methods: Participants from the China Kadoorie Biobank were enrolled during 2004–2008 and followed up until 31
December 2015. After excluding participants with previously diagnosed CKD, cancer, heart disease, and stroke at
baseline, the present study included 469,459 participants. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was qualitatively
tested at baseline. Incident CKD cases were identified mainly through the health insurance system and disease and
death registries.
Results: During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (4.2 million person-years), we documented 4555 incident cases of
CKD. Cox regression yielded multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared
with HBsAg-negative participants, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for CKD was 1.37 (1.18, 1.60) for HBsAgpositive participants. The association was stronger in men (HR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.43, 2.20) than in women (HR = 1.10; 95%
CI: 0.88, 1.36). HBsAg-positive participants, with or without hepatitis or cirrhosis, whether or not under treatment, all
showed increased risk of developing CKD. We observed positive additive interactions of HBsAg positivity with smoking,
physical inactivity, or diabetes on CKD risk. Compared with HBsAg-negative participants who were nonsmokers, more
physically active, or did not have diabetes at baseline, the greatest CKD risk for HBsAg-positive participants was for
those who were smokers (HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.38), physically inactive (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.40), or diabetic
(HR = 6.11; 95% CI: 4.47, 8.36).
Conclusions: In countries with a high endemicity of HBV infection, kidney damage associated with chronic HBV
infection should be a non-negligible concern. Our findings also highlight the importance of health advice on quitting
smoking, increasing physical activity, improving glucose control, and early screening for CKD in people with chronic
HBV infection.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which has important
health and economic implications [1], had a prevalence of
10.8% in China in 2010 [2], as high as that in developed
countries such as the USA (13.1%) and Norway (10.2%)
[3, 4]. CKD is a general term for heterogeneous disorders
and defined based on the presence of kidney damage or
decreased kidney function for 3 months or more [5].
Several risk factors for CKD have been identified, including diabetes, hypertension, older age, tobacco smoking,
obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nephrotoxic drugs or
toxins [5, 6]. However, possible effects of more adverse
factors on the CKD risk remain to be clarified.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been shown to
have negative impacts on renal funtion [7–9]. A recently
published systematic review showed that two prospective
studies consistently linked HBV infection to increased
risk of end-stage renal disease [10]. However, another
two prospective studies examining the association between HBV infection and a broader CKD outcome
showed mixed results [11, 12].
China is a higher-intermediate HBV endemicity country, with an estimated seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 5.49% [13]. If chronic HBV
infection is causally related to CKD risk, this may partially explain the high burden of CKD and may guide
prevention efforts in China. In the present study, we
prospectively examined the association between chronic
HBV infection and CKD risk in the China Kadoorie
Biobank (CKB) study of 0.5 million adults. We additionally examined the joint associations of HBV infection
with established risk factors of several lifestyle factors
and prevalent diseases on CKD risk, applying both
multiplicative and additive interaction analyses.
Methods
Study population
Detailed descriptions of the CKB have been given elsewhere [14, 15]. Briefly, a total of 512,891 participants
aged 30–79 years were recruited in 2004–2008 from five
urban and five rural regions in China. Eligible participants were invited to a community assessment center
and completed an interviewer-administered electronic
questionnaire, physical measurements, and blood spot
tests for random blood glucose and HBsAg. A 10 ml
non-fasting blood sample for each participant was also
collected and shipped to the central blood repository for
long-term storage. The study protocol was approved by
the Ethics Review Committee of the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) and the
Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University
of Oxford (UK). All participants provided written informed consent before taking part in the study.
In the present analysis, we excluded participants who
reported having been diagnosed with CKD (n = 7577),
heart disease (n = 15,472), stroke (n = 8884), or cancer
(n = 2577) by a qualified doctor. We also excluded participants with missing data or an unclear result for
HBsAg (n = 11,136) or missing data for body mass index
(BMI; n = 2), plus one participant who was lost to
follow-up shortly after baseline (n = 1). After these exclusions, 469,459 participants remained for the final analyses.
Assessment of exposure
At baseline, the whole venous blood of participants was
qualitatively tested for HBsAg using on-site rapid test strips
(ACON dipstick, USA) (negative, positive, or unclear). All
participants also completed interviewer-administered
laptop-based questionnaires and were asked if they had
ever been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis (not limited to
chronic viral hepatitis) or liver cirrhosis (yes or no) by a
doctor. For those who reported a prior medical history of
the disease, we further asked their age at the first diagnosis,
and if they were still on treatment (not specifically
anti-HBV treatment; yes or no).
Assessment of covariates
Covariate information was obtained from the baseline
questionnaire, including socio-demographic status (age,
sex, education, occupation, household income, and
marital status), lifestyle behaviors (alcohol consumption,
tobacco smoking, physical activity, and intake of red
meat, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables), personal medical
history (hypertension, diabetes, and rheumatic arthritis)
and women’s menopause status. In the present analysis,
we included in the current smoker category former
smokers who had stopped smoking due to illness to
avoid a misleadingly elevated risk. The daily level of
physical activity was calculated by multiplying the metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) value for a particular type
of physical activity by hours spent on that activity per
day and summing the MET-hours for all activities.
Trained staff undertook baseline measurements of body
weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure.
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of the height in meters. Prevalent hypertension was
defined as measured systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg,
measured diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, self-reported
prior diagnosis of hypertension, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication at baseline. Prevalent diabetes was
defined as measured fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l,
measured random blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l, or
self-reported prior diagnosis of diabetes at baseline.
Ascertainment of incident chronic kidney disease
Incident CKD cases were identified by linking local disease and death registries, linking the national health
Si et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:93 Page 2 of 8

insurance (HI) system, and by active follow-up (i.e., visiting local communities or directly contacting participants). In particular, the electronic linkage with the HI
claims database is one of the most important means of
ascertaining CKD cases in the present study. The HI
data are comprehensive and contain information on all
diagnoses and treatments prescribed to patients who
sought health care in a hospital. Successful linkage to
the HI system was achieved for more than 96% of the
CKB participants in 2015, which was similar across ten
survey sites. Trained staff blinded to baseline information coded all diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The
outcome of the present analysis was CKD, including diabetes mellitus with renal complications (E10.2, E11.2,
E12.2, E13.2, and E14.2), hypertensive renal disease (I12
and I13), glomerular disease (N03, N04, N05, and N07),
renal tubulo-interstitial disease (N11, N12, N13, N14,
and N15), and renal failure (N18 and N19).
Statistical analysis
Participants contributed person-time from baseline until
the date of CKD diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or
31 December 2015, whichever came first. We used a
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI), with age as the underlying time scale, stratified by
5-year age groups and ten survey sites. The proportional
hazards assumption for the Cox model was checked
using Schoenfeld residuals, and no violation was found.
Multivariable models for association between chronic
HBV infection and CKD risk were adjusted for age; sex
(for whole cohort); level of education; marital status; alcohol consumption; smoking status; physical activity;
frequencies of intake of red meat, fresh fruit, and fresh
vegetables; menopausal status (for women only); BMI;
prevalent diabetes; and prevalent hypertension. We further explored whether the association was mediated by
the presence of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis by adjusting for a composite variable of disease duration and
treatment status at baseline.
In the sensitivity analyses, we excluded participants
whose outcome occurred during the first 2 years of
follow-up. We additionally adjusted for occupation,
household income, waist circumference, systolic blood
pressure, and prevalent rheumatic arthritis at baseline
separately. We further included participants with medical histories of heart disease or stroke at baseline and
additionally adjusted for these two variables. The risk estimates did not change materially (data not shown).
We examined whether the association of HBsAg status
with CKD risk differed by demographics, lifestyles, and
co-morbidities on both multiplicative and additive scales.
Prespecified baseline subgroups included sex (men or
women), age at baseline (<50 or ≥50 years), residence
(urban or rural), smoking status (daily smoker or not), alcohol consumption (daily drinker or not), level of physical activity (categorized using sex-specific tertile cutoffs, the
lowest tertile or others), BMI (<24.0 or ≥24.0 kg/m2
), prevalent diabetes (presence or absence), and prevalent hypertension (presence or absence). We tested multiplicative
interaction by using likelihood ratio test comparing models
with and without a cross-product term. We assessed additive interaction by estimating the relative excess risk due to
interaction (RERI) [16]. A RERI of 0 indicates no interaction on the additive scale and >0 indicates a synergistic
interaction. We further decomposed the joint effect of two
exposures, that is, comparing both exposures present to
both absent, into three components: the proportions attributable to HBsAg positivity alone, to the prespecified baseline variable alone, and to their interaction [16, 17].
We used Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp, TX, USA) to
analyze the data. Statistical significance was set at
two-tailed P < 0.05.
Results
Of all 469,459 participants, 41.0% were men, and 56.4%
resided in rural areas. HBsAg-positive participants were
more likely to be men and urban residents, and report
having prevalent chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis.
Among participants with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, HBsAg-positive participants were more likely to
be under treatment at baseline (Table 1).
During a median of 9.1 years (interquartile range
1.88 years; 4.2 million person-years) of follow-up, we
documented 1762 incident CKD cases among men and
2793 among women. In the multivariable-adjusted model,
HBsAg positivity was significantly associated with a higher
risk of incident CKD (Table 2). In all eligible participants,
compared with HBsAg-negative participants, the HRs
(95% CIs) for CKD were 1.37 (1.18, 1.60) for
HBsAg-positive participants. The association between
HBsAg status and CKD risk was stronger in men
(HR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.43, 2.20) than in women (HR = 1.10;
95% CI: 0.88, 1.36) (P = 0.007 for interaction with sex). Further adjustment for the presence of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis at baseline did not change the association materially.
We further examined the joint association of HBsAg
status and presence of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and
its treatment status with CKD risk (Table 3). Compared
with HBsAg-negative participants without chronic
hepatitis or cirrhosis, those who were HBsAg positive
and had chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis under treatment at baseline had the greatest risk of developing
CKD (HR = 4.74; 95% CI: 2.68, 8.36). The magnitude of
risk was similar in men and women (P = 0.061 for interaction with sex). Male participants who were HBsAg positive but without chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis or not on
Si et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:93 Page 3 of 8

treatment also showed a moderate increase in the CKD
risk. HBsAg-positive participants who had been diagnosed
with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis for ≥15 years had a
slightly higher risk of developing CKD compared with
those diagnosed for <15 years (see Additional file 1).
We examined the association between HBsAg status
and CKD risk according to potential baseline risk factors.
Notably, the effect of HBsAg positivity interacted with the
effect of smoking, physical inactivity, or prevalent diabetes
on CKD risk, on multiplicative and/or additive scales
(Table 4). The positive association between HBsAg
status and CKD risk was stronger in those who were
smokers, less physically active, or diabetic. Compared
with HBsAg-negative participants who were nonsmokers, more physically active, or did not have diabetes at baseline, HBsAg-positive participants had the
greatest risk of developing CKD if they were smokers
(HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.38), physically inactive
(HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.40), or diabetic (HR = 6.11;
95% CI: 4.47, 8.36). We observed positive additive interactions of HBsAg positivity with smoking, physical inactivity,
or diabetes on CKD risk, with all corresponding RERI > 0.
The proportion of risk (%) in the doubly exposed group
attributable to the interaction with HBsAg positivity was
66.3 (32.4, 100.3) for smoking, 79.1 (50.5, 107.7) for physical inactivity, and 48.0 (27.7, 68.3) for diabetes, respectively. No statistically significant interaction was observed

Discussion
In this large prospective Chinese adult cohort, we found
that chronic HBV infection was associated with a 37%
increased risk of CKD. The association was stronger in
men than in women. In addition, the joint effects of
chronic HBV infection with smoking, physical inactivity,
or prevalent diabetes on CKD risk were more than the
addition of the risk associated with each of these factors.
To our knowledge, only two prospective studies have
examined the association between HBV infection and
CKD risk. In a study using claims data from the Taiwan
National Health Insurance Research Database, 17,796
adults with untreated HBV infection and 71,184
matched controls were compared and showed an increased risk of CKD associated with chronic HBV infection (HR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.95, 3.42) during a mean
6.5 years of follow-up [11]. However, in another study
conducted for 4329 adults who received regular healthy
check-ups in a Chinese hospital, occult HBV infection,
defined as seropositive for antibodies to the HBV core
antigen, was not associated with CKD in the subsequent
5 years (odds ratio = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.95) [12]. In the
present study, we associated chronic HBV infection,
characterized by HBsAg positivity, with a higher risk of
incident CKD over a period of close to 10 years. The risk
estimates of CKD did not change materially after adjusting for chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis at baseline, suggesting that these conditions might not be the causal
intermediates from HBV infection to CKD. The presence
of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and receiving treatment
at baseline might be an indicator of long-term active
virus replication with a higher risk of causing damage,
and was associated with the greatest CKD risk in the
present population. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that some medications for chronic liver diseases
are nephrotoxic. However, in the present study,
HBsAg-positive participants, without hepatitis or cirrhosis or not on treatment at baseline, still showed an increased risk of developing CKD.
The pathogenesis of HBV-associated nephropathy remains unclear, and several mechanisms have been implicated. Steatosis, a typical feature of chronic HBV
infection, could induce lipid peroxidation and increase
plasma inflammatory biomarkers, leading to endothelial
dysfunction and renal injury [18]. It is also suggested that

HBV carriers are more likely to have increased insulin resistance and a higher circulating level of transforming
growth factor ß, contributing to the potentiation of apoptosis and renal fibrosis [19, 20]. It has been shown that
men are more likely to develop steatosis [21] and have a
lower HBV clearance than women [22]. It is consistent
with our findings that the association between HBV infection and CKD is stronger in men than women.
Our in-depth analyses suggested important interactions
of chronic HBV infection with tobacco smoking, physical
inactivity, or diabetes on the CKD risk on both multiplicative and additive scales. The additive interaction is more
relevant to public health measures than the multiplicative
interaction. We found that about two-thirds of CKD cases
among a population with chronic HBV infection who
smoke tobacco would occur if both exposures were
present but not if only one or the other was present. A
similar additive interaction was found for HBV infection
with physical inactivity or with diabetes on the CKD risk.
These findings imply that the public health consequences
of quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, and improving glucose control would be larger in participants
with chronic HBV infection.
The synergistic effects of chronic HBV infection with individual lifestyle factors and conditions on CKD risk are
biologically plausible, consistent with previous studies that
the pathogenesis of HBV-associated nephropathy depends
on interactions between viral, host, and environmental
factors [23]. The adverse impact of chronic HBV infection
on CKD might be exacerbated by smoking-induced renal
atherosclerosis [24] and endothelial dysfunction [25], and
attenuated by reduced oxidative stress and reduced

Defined as <13.4 or <12.4 MET-h/day for men or women respectively
Multivariable model was adjusted for: age (years); sex (men or women, for whole cohort); level of education (no formal school, primary school, middle school, high school,
college, or university or higher); marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or never married); alcohol consumption (less than weekly drinker, weekly drinker,
daily drinker with an intake of <15, 15–29, 30–59, or ≥60 g/day); intake frequencies of red meat, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables (daily, 4–6 days/week, 1–3 days/week,
monthly, rarely, or never); body mass index (kg/m2
); menopausal status (premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal; for women only); and prevalent hypertension
at baseline (presence or absence). The variables of smoking status (nonsmoker, former smoker having quit smoking ≥5 or <5 years previously, or current daily smoker
smoking <15, 15–24, or ≥25 cigarettes or equivalents per day), physical activity (MET-h/day), and prevalent diabetes were adjusted for in the multivariable model except for
their own subgroup analysis

inflammation with increasing physical activity [26].
Similarly, HBV infection and hyperglycemia-induced
metabolic and hemodynamic pathways might be interwoven together in the pathogenesis of kidney injury [27,
28]. The mechanisms for their synergistic effects on CKD
still warrant further elucidation.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study has
been, by far, the largest prospective study examining the
association between chronic HBV infection and CKD
risk. For the first time, this study provides compelling
evidence of the synergistic effects of chronic HBV infection with tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, or diabetes on CKD risk. Strengths of the study include its
prospective design, large sample size, long follow-up
period, the inclusion of a geographically spread Chinese
population living in urban and rural areas, and careful
adjustment for potential confounders.
This study acknowledges some limitations. We used an
on-site HBsAg rapid test because it was feasible for a
large-scale population study, but there was the possibility
of misclassification. However, measurement errors in the
prospective study may be nondifferential on subsequent
disease status and may have attenuated our findings towards the null. Participants were excluded from the study
based on self-reporting of a prediagnosed CKD at baseline.
Underreporting of the subclinical or early stage of CKD
might exist, leading to overestimation of CKD incidence
during the follow-up. However, after excluding participants whose outcome occurred during the first 2 years of
follow-up, the risk estimates remained largely unchanged.
Also, the incident cases of CKD in this study were mainly
identified using a linkage with the HI system. Some
asymptomatic or mild cases might have been missed,
resulting in nondifferential outcome misclassification and
attenuation of the effect estimates. Lack of detailed information about viral load, antiviral treatment (especially the
use of nephrotoxic drugs), or any biochemistry data indicating liver function precluded further analysis.
Conclusions
In this large prospective study, we found that participants with chronic HBV infection had an increased risk
of CKD. HBV infection exhibited noticeable synergistic
effects with smoking, less physical activity, or diabetes
on the CKD risk. In countries with an intermediate and
high endemicity of HBV infection, kidney damage associated with chronic HBV infection should be a
non-negligible concern. Our study also highlights the
importance of health advice on quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, improving glucose control,
and early screening for the CKD in people with chronic
HBV infection. More studies are warranted to confirm
the results of this study and clarify the underlying mechanism of the association.
