Abstract The diverse microbial community that inhabits 
the human gut has an extensive metabolic repertoire that is 
distinct from, but complements the activity of mammalian 
enzymes in the liver and gut mucosa and includes functions 
essential for host digestion. As such, the gut microbiota is 
a key factor in shaping the biochemical profile of the diet 
and, therefore, its impact on host health and disease. The 
important role that the gut microbiota appears to play in 
human metabolism and health has stimulated research into 
the identification of specific microorganisms involved in 
different processes, and the elucidation of metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with metabolism of dietary components and some host-generated substances. In 
the first part of the review, we discuss the main gut microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and microbial pathways 
associated with the metabolism of dietary carbohydrates 
(to short chain fatty acids and gases), proteins, plant polyphenols, bile acids, and vitamins. The second part of the 
review focuses on the methodologies, existing and novel, 
that can be employed to explore gut microbial pathways of

Introduction
The human colonic microbiota is a large and complex 
microbial community. In total, over 1000 bacterial species have been identified of which many remain uncultured, with about 160 species being found in the gut of any 
individual [1]. The gene set of the gut microbiota (the gut 
microbiome) is estimated to be about 3 million genes −150 
times larger than that of the human genome [2]. This large 
and diverse microbial community has an equally extensive metabolic repertoire that complements the activity of 
mammalian enzymes in the liver and gut mucosa [3]. The 
gut microbiota makes an important contribution to human 
metabolism by contributing enzymes that are not encoded 
by the human genome, for example, the breakdown of polysaccharides, polyphenols and synthesis of vitamins. The 
evidence for the role of the microbiota in metabolism of 
dietary components and for its impact on health is derived 
from comparative studies in germ-free and conventional 
microbiota, or human microbiota-associated animals, and 
from in  vitro studies using human faecal incubations or 
more complex continuous culture gut models. Furthermore, 
observational studies comparing the faecal microbiota of 
healthy subjects with those of patients strongly suggest that 
the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the aetiology 
and/or development of a range of gastrointestinal diseases 
and conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colon cancer, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. More recently evidence has been 
accumulating that the microbiota may also be involved in 
obesity and diabetes [4, 5].
The critical role that the gut microbiota appears to play 
in human metabolism and health has stimulated research to 
identify the microorganisms involved and their functionality, in relation to metabolic pathways, particularly those 
associated with metabolism of dietary components. These 
areas are the focus of the present review.
Carbohydrates
Bacteria in the large intestine mainly rely on dietary substrates that are undigested in the upper digestive tract for 
survival. Saccharolytic bacterial fermentation produces 
generally beneficial metabolites, whereas if there is limited 
carbohydrate, bacteria turn to alternative energy sources 
resulting in the production of other metabolites that may 
be more detrimental to human health [6]. The key bacterial 
fermentation products following the fermentation of dietary 
carbohydrates are short chain fatty acids and gases (Fig. 1).
Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
The three most abundant SCFAs detected in faeces are 
acetate, propionate, and butyrate, normally present in molar 
ratios ranging from 3:1:1 to 10:2:1. This ratio is consistent 
with values observed within the intestine in early sudden 
death victims [7]. These three main SCFAs perform very 
different but important roles in the human body. Butyrate 
is arguably the most important SCFA for human health. 
It forms the key energy source for human colonocytes 
and also has potential anti-cancer activity via the ability 
to induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells and its ability to 
regulate gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylases [8]. There is also evidence that butyrate can activate 
intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) via a cAMP-dependent 
mechanism with beneficial effects on glucose and energy 
homeostasis [9]. Propionate is also an energy source for 
the epithelial cells, but is also transferred to the liver where 
it also plays a role in gluconeogenesis. It is also increasingly thought to be an important molecule in satiety signalling due to interaction with the gut receptors (G proteincoupled receptor, GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43, also known 
as Fatty Acid Receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3, which may, 
in turn, activate intestinal IGN [9–11]. The conversion of 
propionate to glucose in intestinal gluconeogenesis directly 
promotes energy homeostasis by reducing the production 
of hepatic glucose, and consequently reduces adiposity 
[9]. Acetate is the most abundant SCFA, and is an essential co-factor/metabolite for the growth of other bacteria. 
For instance, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii will not grow 
in pure culture in the absence of acetate [12]. Within the 
human body, acetate is transported to the peripheral tissues 
and used in cholesterol metabolism and lipogenesis, and 

Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24 3

recent evidence from studies in mice indicates that it also 
plays a significant role in central appetite regulation [13].
Bacterial cross‑feeding
Bacteria produce intermediate fermentation products 
including fumarate, succinate, and lactate, but these are 
normally detected at low levels in faeces from healthy 
individuals due to extensive utilization of them by other 
bacteria. For example, lactate is typically converted into 
either propionate or butyrate by other bacteria, and is thus 
present at negligible levels in adult faeces. However, in 
patients with ulcerative colitis, lactate can be detected in 
significantly higher amounts [14] and could potentially be 
an indicator of disease. Co-culture cross-feeding studies 
illustrate the impact of bacterial interactions on final SCFA 
detection. Lactate produced by Bifidobacterium longum
during growth in pure culture on fructo-oligo-saccharides 
(FOS) completely disappeared in co-culture with Eubacte‑
rium hallii, and was replaced by significant butyrate levelsdespite the fact that E. hallii alone could not grow on the 
carbohydrate substrate [15]. Growth of Roseburia intesti‑
nalis is stimulated by acetate and in co-culture with a different strain of B. longum, growth of the R. intestinalis on 
FOS was delayed until sufficient acetate, produced by B. 
longum, accumulated in the growth medium [16].
Specificity of SCFA production by intestinal species
Acetate is produced by many bacteria, but propionate and 
butyrate tend to be produced by specific bacteria [17, 18;]. 
Within the gastrointestinal environment, the predominant 
butyrate producers are Firmicutes including some Lachnospiraceae and also Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whilst propionate is produced by Bacteroides species, Negativicutes, 
and also some Clostridium species. Metagenomic screening of more than 3000 sequenced bacterial genomes identified many other species containing butyrate production 
pathways, with no consistency within families [19]. Since 
the production of SCFA is not defined by bacterial phylogeny, different methods targeting key genes are required to 
enumerate bacteria with specific metabolic activities. Louis 
and co-workers identified two main routes of butyrate production [20], and three pathways for propionate production [18], amongst the colonic microbiota. The primers 
designed against key metabolic genes in these pathways 
can help to enumerate functional groups of bacteria in different cohorts. This approach may prove more useful than 
Fig. 1 Pathways of carbohydrate metabolism [156]

the current focus on the 16S rRNA gene, which provides 
information about the bacterial composition but indicates 
nothing about fluctuations in metabolic activities.
It is important to note that propionate and butyrate 
are also formed from peptide and amino-acid fermentation by certain Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes species [21]. 
In  vitro studies indicate that aspartate, alanine, threonine, and methionine are the main sources of propionate, 
whereas butyrate is predominantly derived from fermentation of glutamate, lysine, histidine, cysteine, serine, and 
methionine.
A targeted gene approach revealed that most bacteria either had the capability to produce propionate or 
butyrate—very few had genetic capacity to produce both 
[18]. Some bacteria can, however, alter their fermentation 
and produce different SCFA under different, substratedependent, growth conditions. Roseburia inulinivorans is a 
butyrate producer, but during growth on fucose, it is able 
to completely change its gene expression pattern, switching 
on a set of genes capable of utilizing fucose as an energy 
source, and producing propionate and propanol via a propanediol utilization pathway [22]. Ruminococcus obeum
produces acetate, formate, and lactate during growth on 
glucose on pure culture, but additionally produces propionate during growth on fucose, again using the propanediol 
utilization pathway [18]. Fucose is a particularly important 
alternative dietary substrate, since many of the epithelial 
glycoconjugates are fucosylated. The ability of a bacterium 
to flick a metabolic switch and change its metabolism, and 
metabolic products, may give the bacterium a competitive 
advantage during times of low substrate availability. In 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, the presence of fucose as a 
growth substrate not only stimulates expression of genes 
involved in fucose metabolism, but intracellular fucose levels are also critical in activating a signalling mechanism to 
the host, increasing synthesis of fucosylated glycans [23] 
and thus ensuring a continued supply of substrate to the 
bacterium. This entire alternative metabolism is upregulated during periods of nutrient depletion, and it may also 
be important in early colonization events in the infant gut 
[24].
Altering the carbohydrate content of the diet can also 
alter the faecal SCFA profile by affecting the bacterial composition. Reducing the carbohydrate content of the diet significantly reduced both faecal butyrate concentrations and 
numbers of the Roseburia/E. rectale group in human studies [25], while wheat bran supplementation (consisting of 
>70% arabinoxylan oligo-saccharides; AXOS) increased 
the abundance of all three predominant SCFAs and thus 
also total SCFA concentrations [26]. However, it is probable that the indiscriminate increases in faecal SCFA concentrations observed in studies where the fibre content 
of the diet is increased are at least partly caused by the 
increased faecal bulking and reduced transit time resulting 
in decreased colonic absorption of SCFAs. The FODMAP 
diet, a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-saccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols, and thus designed 
to reduce large intestinal bacterial fermentation, is increasingly used as an effective therapy to treat IBS. Although the 
diet is associated with increased faecal pH, presumably due 
to less bacterial fermentation, the actual faecal concentration of different SCFAs is similar to the control diet [27], 
illustrating the complex association between SCFA production, absorption, and excretion. Total numbers of bacteria 
declined on the FODMAP diet compared to the habitual 
Australian diet, with the proportion of a few specific bacterial groups significantly affected [27].
Bacterial gas production in the intestinal tract
Gas is an inevitable product of microbial fermentation in 
anaerobic ecosystems, including the alimentary tract. For 
example, hydrogen is an important fermentation intermediate and interspecies hydrogen transfer occurs when electron 
flow shifts from reduced organic products towards proton 
reduction. This can be achieved through the production of 
further gases like H2S or methane. This disposes of excess 
reducing power generated in reactions involving the oxidation of organic material.
Gas formation is not a universal trait among bacteria 
growing anaerobically and the biochemistry of some species involves no gas generation at all [28]. This is the case 
for common probiotics like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. It is, therefore, theoretically feasible that probiotic or 
prebiotic use may reduce gas occurrence in the gut and 
also help negate odoriferous problems. Gas generated as 
a consequence of anaerobic bacterial fermentation may be 
partially excreted via the lungs or as flatus. In the healthy 
human, investigations have indicated that the volume of flatus excreted can reach up several litres per day [29]. The 
majority of bacterially generated gas comprises hydrogen, 
carbon dioxide, and methane, all odourless gases. In general, less than 1% of flatus is oxygen, which together with 
nitrogen, accounts for only about 26% of flatus [30]. While 
odoriferous gases constitute less than 1% of total flatus and 
include NH3, hydrogen sulphide, indole, skatole, and volatile amines, their accumulation is certainly noticeable. Key 
noxious, as well as potentially toxic, constituents are the 
sulphides, which also act as precursors for other S-based 
components like mercaptans.
Hydrogen
The hydrogen composition of flatus ranges up to 40% and 
it seems that it is exclusively of microbial origin [31, 32]. 
Hydrogen is produced by a variety of gut bacteria, the most 

Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24 5
1 3
predominant including Bacteroides and Clostridium. These 
genera are common components of the microbiota, implying that they are the principal source of microbial gas [33]. 
The theoretical rate of hydrogen production far exceeds 
what is actually excreted, as it can be re-utilized by the 
gut microbiota. The removal of hydrogen allows a more 
complete oxidation of organic substrates and, therefore, a 
higher energy yield from anaerobic fermentation.
There are three main microbial routes by which hydrogen can be removed to enable a depletion of electron sink 
products such as lactate, succinate, and ethanol, and allow 
more efficient energy recovery from organic substrates. 
These are dissimilatory sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, and acetogenesis.
Dissimilatory sulphate reduction is carried out by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). These microorganisms 
utilize sulphate (as opposed to oxygen used in the conventional aerobic respiration) as an electron acceptor for the 
dissimilation of organic compounds and hydrogen [32]. 
The main genus of gut SRB is Desulfovibrio [31]. Sulphate 
can be provided in the diet or released following microbial 
metabolism of sulphated mucins. These are glycoproteins 
that line the gastrointestinal tract, acting as lubricant as 
well as a protective barrier between the mucosal surface 
and the luminal contents.
The utilization of hydrogen to reduce sulphate to sulphide has effects on overall colonic gas production by 
reducing the amount of free hydrogen in the colon, thereby 
helping to prevent excessive gas build up:
However, the highly toxic nature of the hydrogen sulphide that is generated can have pathological consequences 
for the host.
Methanogenesis is a further mechanism of hydrogen disposal in the colon, also reducing overall gas accumulation, 
which is carried out as follows:
Methanogens and sulphate reducers thus compete 
for hydrogen in the gut and the process that dominates is 
dependent on the amount of sulphate available [34, 35]. 
When sufficient sulphate is available SRB out-compete 
methanogens for hydrogen due to their greater substrate 
affinity. While methanogenesis and dissimilatory sulphate 
reduction are the principle means by which hydrogen is 
utilized, when either of these mechanisms are in play acetogenesis (the third mechanism of hydrogen utilization) is 
also feasible. In terms of host health, acetogenesis is likely 
to be the most favourable mode of hydrogen recycling. The 
reason for this lies in the fact that, in this process, carbon 
dioxide and hydrogen are converted into acetate with no 
evolution of gas [33]:
4H2 + SO4
2− + H+ → HS− + 4H2O.
4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O.
However, this reaction is energetically less favourable 
than dissimilatory sulphate reduction or methanogenesis.
Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide is another quantitatively significant gas 
that is expelled in flatus. Carbon dioxide can account 
for between 5 and 50% of the total flatus volume and as 
shown above is recycled with hydrogen via methanogenesis and, to a lesser extent, acetogenesis [36].
In contrast to hydrogen and methane, carbon dioxide 
can be generated by a number of processes, not just bacterial metabolism. Three potential sources of carbon dioxide include its diffusion from the blood into the colonic 
lumen, the acidification of bicarbonate in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and bacterial metabolism [30]. Some 
species of clostridia (e.g., C. sporogenes, C. butyricum, 
and C. perfringens) produce both carbon dioxide and 
hydrogen in their metabolic pathways.
Clinical aspects
Gas production by the colonic microbiota can exert clinical consequences for the host. For example, a common 
feature of IBS is excessive gas production and flatus, and 
is associated with bloating and abdominal distension. An 
absence of bacterial hydrogen recycling can lead towards 
pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis which is characterized by excessive gas production and the presence of gas 
filled cysts on the colonic wall [37]. In this instance, an 
absence of SRB, methanogenic bacteria, and acetogens 
causes the individual to produce between 5 and 10 times 
more gas than is usual.
Recycling of hydrogen via dissimilatory sulphate 
reduction generates hydrogen sulphide, which is a cell 
signalling molecule of emerging physiological importance [38], but also is highly toxic to colonic cells and 
is potentially implicated in inflammatory bowel disease, 
since sufferers of ulcerative colitis have a universal carriage of SRB [39, 40]. The presence of methane in the 
colon has been linked with colorectal cancer, although 
the association may be a consequence of the disease 
rather than causal, since patients with the condition 
have slower colonic transit times [41]. This would assist 
growth of methanogens in the gut due to their slow growing nature. Individuals with lactose intolerance have 
increased gas production, since the defective absorption 
of lactose in the upper GIT means that lactose reaches 
colonic bacteria, and is fermented forming gas.
4H2 + CO2 → CH3COOH + 2H2O.

Proteins
Early work with human gut contents by Macfarlane and 
Cummings [42] showed that the colonic microbiota has 
considerable proteolytic power, converting ingested dietary 
protein and endogenous protein from host enzymes, mucin, 
and sloughed off intestinal cells into shorter peptides, amino 
acids and derivatives, short and branched-chain fatty acids, 
and gases, including ammonia, H2, CO2, and H2S [42]. This 
early work was limited at the time to culture-based microbiology techniques, but the authors identified Bacteroides
and Propionibacterium species as the predominant proteolytic species in faecal samples, with proteolysis common 
also amongst clostridia, streptococci, staphylococci, and 
Bacillus species. Gibson et  al. [43] showed that the proteolytic activity of the faecal microbiota differed, both in 
quantity and quality of protein degradation, from that in the 
ileum. Faecal proteolyis was more efficacious at degrading 
the highly globular protein bovine serum albumin, despite 
having lower overall proteolytic activity compared to ileal 
effluent. In 1996, the Macfarlane team also provided some 
of the only information on the metabolic processes governing amino-acid fermentation by gut bacteria using both 
pure cultures of intestinal bacteria and in vitro gut models 
inoculated with human faeces [44]. They successfully characterized dissimilatory aromatic amino-acid fermentation 
by these bacteria and measured their production of phenols 
and indoles upon fermentation of aromatic amino acids 
using GC-MS. They also measured the impact of pH, carbohydrate availability, and gut model retention time on this 
activity, and found a preference for amino-acid fermentation at higher ranges of colonic pH and a 60% reduction 
in this fermentation and end product production (phenols 
and indoles) when fermentable carbohydrate was available 
[44]. In seminal work involving intestinal contents from 
two sudden death victims, Macfarlane et al. [7] reported the 
metabolic potential of different regions of the colon. The 
proximal colon was predominantly saccharolytic by nature, 
whereas protein fermentation increased distally, as did pH, 
through the transverse colon and into the distal colon. This 
protein fermentation was associated with increased concentrations of branched-chain fatty acids, phenol, and indole 
derivatives of amino-acid fermentation and ammonia.
Recently, evidence has emerged that aromatic amino 
acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) can be fermented to phenylpropanoid metabolites, phenylacetic acid, 
and 4-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid, which are abundant in 
faeces [45]. The organisms involved include several species of Bacteroides, Eubacterium hallii, and Clostridium 
barlettii. Interestingly, these phenolic compounds are the 
same as those generated by microbial breakdown of plant 
polyphenols.
The complexities of amino-acid utilization and subsequent availability to the host are now becoming apparent 
and warrant more in-depth scrutiny in specifically designed 
mechanistic studies (Fig.  2; [46]). Dai et  al. [47] showed 
that bacterial conversion of free amino acids into polypeptides contributes considerably to amino-acid metabolism and bioavailability in the mammalian gut. They also 
found that the relative concentrations of different amino

1 3
acids available to intestinal bacteria can impact greatly on 
overall amino-acid utilization at the community level [48]. 
For example, they found that L-glutamine regulates small 
intestinal bacterial metabolism of arginine, serine, and 
aspartate, and reduced the catabolism of essential and nonessential amino acids. This is especially relevant given the 
fact that modern food processing has a dramatic effect on 
the relative concentrations of amino acids present in commonly consumed processed foods and recent evidence for 
important physiological roles for both essential (e.g., tryptophan) and non-essential amino acids in mammalian nutrition [49–51].
Vitamin synthesis
It has been known for over 40 years, via studies in germfree and the conventional rodents and in human volunteers, 
that the gut microbiota can synthesize certain vitamins, 
notably vitamin K, and B group vitamins including biotin, 
cobalamin, folates, nicotinic acid, panthotenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamine [52]. These vitamins are 
clearly important for bacterial metabolism, but there is evidence for the metabolic and physiological significance of 
some of these pathways in mammals. For example, germfree rats reared without a dietary supplement of vitamin K 
have low prothrombin levels and develop haemorrhages, 
while their conventional counterparts have normal prothrombin levels and normal clotting activity [53]. Furthermore, human subjects on low vitamin K diets for 3–4 weeks 
did not develop vitamin deficiency, but those treated with 
a broad-spectrum antibiotic to suppress the microbiota 
showed a significant decrease in plasma prothrombin levels 
[54]. Metagenomic sequencing has recently been used to 
provide insight into pathways for vitamin synthesis by the 
gut microbiota. Le Blanc et al. [55] explored the metabolic 
potential of gut microbial sequences from two subjects and 
found that their microbiomes were enriched for a variety of 
clustered orthologous groups (COGs) involved in the synthesis of deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate, a precursor of thiamine and pyridoxal.
Magnusdottir et  al. [56] have systematically explored 
the genomes of 256 common gut bacteria for the presence of biosynthetic pathways for eight B vitamins, 
namely biotin, cobalamin, folate, niacin, pantothenate, 
pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamin. This allowed the 
authors to predict the proportion of each phylum containing potential producers of each vitamin. Some genomes 
contained all eight pathways, others none. The most commonly synthesised vitamins were riboflavin (166 potential producers) and niacin (162 producers). For riboflavin 
and biotin, virtually all microbes from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria possessed the 
necessary pathways, with a much smaller proportion of 
the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria having the potential 
for vitamin B biosynthesis. In the case of vitamin B12, 
all the Fusobacteria, compared with 10–50% of the other 
four phyla were predicted to be producers. Overall, Bacteroidetes appeared to be the phylum with the greatest 
number of predicted B vitamin producers. Excluding 
vitamin B12, over 90% of Bacteroidetes were predicted 
to be producers.
Interestingly, the authors identified several pairs of 
organisms whose vitamin synthesis pathway patterns 
complemented each other [56]. This implies cross-feeding between gut microbes, providing essential vitamins 
for growth. This, in turn, suggests that a major proportion 
of the microbially produced vitamins are utilized by other 
non-vitamin producing bacteria. Such utilization limits their availability for the host. The authors estimated 
the percentage of human daily reference intake of each 
vitamin obtained from the gut bacteria [56]. Of the eight 
studied, without considering bacterial utilization, the gut 
microbiota were estimated to contribute over a quarter of 
the suggested dietary intake for four vitamins (Table  1, 
[56]). In addition, there is evidence from studies using 
a various human and animal colon preparations that the 
colonic epithelium can absorb a range of B vitamins, 
including folate, riboflavin, biotin, niacin and thiamine, 
via specific carrier-mediated mechanisms [57].

Bile acids
Bile acids are classical examples of trans-genomic metabolites arising from the interactive metabolism between 
the host genome and the gut microbiome. As outlined in 
Fig. 3, bile acids are synthesised in the liver from cholesterol to form the two primary bile acids cholic acid (CA) 
and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Prior to secretion 
into bile, N-acyl amidation occurs conjugating the carboxyl group of the bile acids to a molecule of either taurine or glycine. This conjugation step produces a molecule that is fully ionised at physiologic pH, enhancing 
the amphipathic nature and, therefore, detergent properties of the molecule. Upon ingestion of a meal, bile acids 
stored in the gall bladder are secreted into the small intestine to facilitate lipid digestion and absorption. While

the majority of bile acids are actively absorbed in the 
distal ileum and recycled back to the liver, a small fraction (1–5%; 200–800  mg daily in humans) escapes this 
enterohepatic circulation and enters the colon. It is here 
that a bidirectional relationship exists between the gut 
microbiota and the bile acids. The colonic microbiota 
are able to modify the structure and properties of the bile 
acids, while the bile acids possess antimicrobial characteristics and can exert selection pressures on the community structure of the gut microbiota. These characteristics 
include detergent effects on bacterial cell membranes 
and the ability to induce DNA damage and disruption to 
protein structures [58–60]. Interestingly, the potency of 
deoxycholic acid (DCA), a microbially derived secondary bile acid, is tenfold greater than that of its precursor, 
CA, due to its greater detergent properties [61]. Hence, 
greater microbial interaction with the enterohepatic circulation enhances its antimicrobial properties, potentially 
providing a feedback mechanism to control bacterial 
populations.
Microbial biotransformation of bile acids includes 
modification to both the side chain and the steroid nucleus 
(Fig. 3). At the side chain, a number of gut bacteria possess bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes that are capable of 
hydrolysing the amide bond between the bile acid and its 
conjugated amino acid [62]. BSH genes have been identified in the main bacterial genera of the microbiota including Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacil‑
lus, and Listeria [63], and most hydrolyse both glyco and 
tauro-conjugates. This deconjugation step provides bacteria 
with a mechanism to reduce the toxicity of the bile acids 
and is a source of nitrogen, sulphur and carbon atoms [64, 
65]. Deconjugated bile acids can be absorbed and returned 
to the liver for re-conjugation before re-entering the enterohepatic circulation or undergo further bacterial processing.
At the steroid nucleus, a range of microbially mediated 
modifications can occur resulting in secondary bile acids. 
Following deconjugation, the C7 hydroxyl group of the 
bile acid becomes available for microbial dehydroxylation. 
Genera such as Clostridium and Eubacterium transform 
CDCA and CA to the secondary bile acids lithocholic acid 
(LCA) and DCA, respectively [66]. This 7α dehydroxylation activity is thought to provide these bacteria with an 
ancillary electron acceptor [65, 67]. These secondary bile 
acids are potentially cytotoxic for the host and have been 
associated with colon cancer and cholesterol gallstone 
formation [68, 69]. To reduce their toxicity, these secondary bile acids undergo further processing in the liver. 
The inability of the liver to re-hydroxylate secondary bile 
acids preserves the diversity of the bile acid pool instead, 
and secondary bile acids are detoxified through conjugation with glycine or taurine, and in some instances sulphate 
[70]. Another bacterial modification to bile acids is the 
epimerization of hydroxyl groups from the α to β orientation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most common 
secondary bile acid produced through this action following 
the epimerization of the 7α hydroxyl group on CDCA [71]. 
This action decreases the toxicity of the bile acid producing 
a more favourable microenvironment for the bacteria.
Overall, the circulating and hepatic bile acid pool contains more than 30 known bile acids and the gut microbiome is responsible for driving the majority of this diversity [72]. Variation in bile acid composition has potential 
to modulate the physico-chemical properties of the overall 
pool. Bacterial deconjugation reduces the efficiency of bile 
acids for the emulsification of dietary lipids and micelle 
formation. This can modify the digestive function of the 
host as bile acids have key roles facilitating the absorption of dietary lipids, nutrients, and lipid-soluble vitamins. 
Bile acids are also recognised as important signalling molecules serving as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid 
X receptor (FXR), and the plasma membrane bound GPR 
TGR5 [73, 74]. Through binding to these receptors, bile 
acids can regulate genes critical to their synthesis, conjugation, transport, and detoxification [75–77] as well as lipid 
[78, 79] and glucose metabolism [80, 81] and energy homeostasis [82]. Variation in the bile acid signature induced by 
the gut microbiota can, therefore, have downstream effects 
on a range of host metabolic processes. The global signalling function of bile acids throughout the host metabolic 
system is suggested by the expression of receptors, transporters, and tissue-specific bile acid signatures outside of 
the enterohepatic circulation, including in the kidney and 
heart [83]. These observations demonstrate the systemic 
regulatory role of bile acids providing a biochemical bridge 
for the gut microbiome to influence the metabolic status of 
the host.
Phytochemicals/polyphenols
Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables are the subject of 
intensive research due to their putative bioactivities and 
their relatively high intake levels, about 820 mg/day [84]. 
Most polyphenols are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and pass into the colon [85]. Studies in germ-free and 
human microbiota-associated animals and in  vitro faecal 
incubations provide evidence that parent polyphenols are 
extensively metabolized by the colonic microbiota, which 
can affect their bioactivity [86, 87].
Polyphenols exhibit structural diversity, which impacts 
on bioavailability, metabolism, and bioactivity [85]. The 
main groups comprise phenolic acids, flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, anthocyanidins, 
and flavonols), stilbenes, lignans, and secoiridoids (Table 2, 
[88]). Most polyphenols are present in food as glycosides

(especially flavonoids), i.e., conjugated to various sugars 
including glucose, galactose, rhamnose, and rutinose. The 
hydroxycinnamic acids are usually esterified with sugars, 
organic acids, or lipids. Other polyphenols such as proanthocyandins and ellagitannins are in the form of high 
molecular weight oligomers and polymers. These conjugated and polymeric forms are generally poorly bioavailable and must be converted to aglycones before absorption. Although for some glucosides, this can be catalysed 
by intestinal mucosal enzymes, the majority of conjugates, 
and esters are not absorbed and pass into the colon where 
they are hydrolyzed by the colonic microbiota [88]. Microbial species involved in hydrolysis include Bacteroides 
distasonis, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, 
Enterococcus casseliflavus, Eubacterium cellulosolvens, 
Lachnospiraceae CG19-1, and Eubacterium ramulus [88, 
89].
Once the polyphenols have been metabolized to their 
aglycones or the polymers have been converted to monomers, they are extensively degraded by other components 
of the colonic microbiota via dehydroxylation, decarboxylation, and ring breakage ultimately generating simpler 
phenolic compounds, such as hydroxyphenyl-acetic acids 
and hydroxyphenylpropionic acids. An example of such a 
pathway is shown for quercetin (Fig. 4; [90]), but equivalent reactions are seen for other flavonoids, phenolic acids 
and lignans [89–91]. In Table  1, organisms identified as 
participating in these reactions are shown. It should also 
be noted that these phenylacetic- and hydroxyphenyl-acetic 
acids can also be derived from fermentation of aromatic 
amino acids ([45]; see “Protein” section).
It is evident from several studies that the complete 
metabolism of polyphenol glycosides in the gut requires 
the involvement of a consortium of microbes. For example, in the case of the lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, the initial deglycosylation is catalysed by three Bac‑
teroides species (B. distasonis, B. fragilis, and B. ovatus) 
and two strains of Clostridium (C. cocleatum, C. saccha‑
rogumia). Demethylation of the lignan aglycone involves 
strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium 
callanderi, Eubacterium limosum, Blautia producta, and 
Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of secoisolariciresinol is catalysed by Clostridium scindens and 
Eggerthella lenta and the final step, dehydrogenation of 
enterodiol to enterolactone, and closure of the lactone ring 
is catalysed by subdominant populations of Clostridiales, 
in particular Lactonifactor longoviformis (Fig. 5; [92–94]).
Human dietary intervention trials and in  vitro faecal 
metabolism studies with dietary plant polyphenols including flavonoids, isoflavones, lignans, hydroxycinnamic 
acids, ellagotannins, and anthocyanins have revealed large 
inter-individual variations in absorption, metabolism, and 
excretion which have been ascribed to differences in gut 
microbiota [90, 94–97]. The most well-studied example 
of such inter-individual variation is the microbial metabolism of the soy isoflavone daidzein which is metabolized 
by two different pathways depending on the gut microbiota 
of the subjects [96]. A majority of subjects convert daidzein to O-desmethylangolensin with a Clostridium species 
involved. However, about 30% of subjects convert daidzein 
to (S)-equol via dihydrodaidzein and tetrahydrodaidzein 
resulting from the activities of a wide range of organisms 
including Streptococcus intermedius, B. ovatus, Rumino‑
coccus productus, Eggerthella sp. Julong732, Adlercreut‑
zia equolifaciens, Slakia isoflavoniconvertens, and Slakia 
equolifaciens. One study [98] found that a consortium of 
Lactobacillus mucosae, Enterococcus faecium, and Fine‑
goldia magna EPI3 Veillonella sp. was sufficient to effect 
the conversion.
Inter-individual variation is also apparent in the conversion of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid to the gut 
microbial derivatives urolithins. Subjects can be divided 
into three main phenotypic groups. Group A (25–80% of 
subjects depending on the trial) produces only urolithin A 
conjugates, and group B (10–50% of subjects) produces 
isourolithin A and/or B as well as urolithin A, whereas 
group 0 (5–25% of subjects) produces no detectable urolithins [97].
There is growing evidence that the metabolism of polyphenols by the microbiota can influence their bioactivity; consequently, inter-individual variation in microbial 
metabolism could have significance for the health benefits 
of phytochemicals. Perhaps, the best example is again the 
soy isoflavone daidzein. There is evidence that equol is 
more bioactive than its parent isoflavone in a range of areas 
including oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic activity, antioxidant capacity and potential anti-cancer effects [99]. Studies of equol producers versus non-producers have suggested 
that equol production may be important in determining 
benefits of soy consumption in terms of bone health, menopausal symptoms, and breast cancer, although the data are 
not consistent [100]. The major metabolites of ellagitannins and ellagic acid, urolithins, are better absorbed than 
the parent compounds and there is evidence that they are

group 0 (see above) who do not produce urolithins might 
be expected not to benefit from intake of ellagotannins.
Methodologies
Isolation of gut organisms involved in metabolizing 
dietary components
Studies on the metabolism of the soy isoflavone daidzein 
to equol provide good examples of methods commonly 
used to identify specific organisms involved in gut microbiota metabolism of dietary compounds. The identification 
of equol-producing organisms has been the subject of several studies as a consequence of the potential importance 
of equol in human health and the intriguing observation 
that only about 30% of people appear to be capable of its 
production.
Matthies et  al. [102] isolated a novel strain from an 
equol-producing subject, by serial dilution of a faecal 
homogenate and incubation in a nutrient broth containing 100 uM daidzein and tetracycline. The latter inhibited 
the growth of the majority of the faecal microbiota without affecting the metabolism of daidzein. From the highest 
dilution that contained equol-producing microorganisms, 
further serial dilutions were prepared and repeated until a 
pure culture was obtained. On the basis of phenotypic and 
phylogenetic characterization, the culture was identified as 
a new species and named Slackia isoflavoniconvertans.
In their study to identify equol-producing organisms, 
Decroos et  al. [98] serially diluted a faecal sample from 
an equol producer and plated on a nutrient agar. Single 
colonies from the plates were tested for ability to metabolize daidzein. From one such colony a stable, mixed culture capable of converting daidzein to equol was obtained 
and shown to comprise four bacterial strains identified as 
Lactobacillus mucosae, Enterococcus faecium, Finegoldia 
magna, and a Veillonella sp. The first three were obtained 
as pure cultures, but interestingly, none was capable of producing equol in pure culture, and the complete consortium 
was required for the conversion. These isolation attempts 
illustrate the difficulties that can be experienced in obtaining a pure culture of a bacterium that is intimately dependent on another bacterial species/strain to provide essential 
growth co-factor(s).
Enrichment techniques have been used extensively in 
environmental microbiology to isolate organisms capable 
of degrading contaminants and other xenobiotics in the 
environment. These techniques usually involve either suspension batch cultures or continuous culture enrichment 
methods in which the mixed culture is incubated with the 
xenobiotic as a selection factor, usually as the sole carbon 
source [103]. These techniques would lend themselves to 
the isolation of organisms or consortia capable of metabolism dietary compounds, but they have not been widely 
used in the human gut microbiota area. A recent study by 
Ziemer [104] illustrates the potential of the technique as 
applied to the ruminant gut. In this study, continuous culture fermenters containing nutrient medium with cellulose 
or xylan-pectin as sole carbon sources were inoculated with 
cattle faeces and run for 8  weeks under operating conditions that modelled the caecum and colon of cattle. Samples 
were then serially diluted and plated onto carbohydratespecific agar to isolate colonies that were then identified by 
16S rRNA gene sequencing. The communities that arose 
during the enrichment had a broad microbial diversity representing six phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Synergistetes, and Fusobacteria). Many 
of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes isolates were related 
to species demonstrated to possess enzymes involved in 
fermenting plant cell wall components, but interestingly 
did not exhibit a high identity to cultured bacteria with 
sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project and so represented novel genera or species. In fact, over 98% of the 
isolates were not previously cultured. This methodology, 
therefore, could provide new opportunities to characterize 
the metabolic capacities of members of the gut microbiota.
Although the approach of isolating strains capable of 
metabolizing dietary components provides insight into the 
potential microorganisms involved in vivo, there are drawbacks, in particular, it clearly focuses only on those gut 
microorganisms that can be cultured in vitro. Furthermore, 
the ability of a single strain to metabolize a compound 
in vitro may not translate into metabolism in the different 
physico-chemical conditions in the host-gut, and when in 
the presence of millions of other bacteria, which may be 
competing for the substrate or acting in partnership to 
degrade it [105].
Gut microbial enzyme activity
Much of the focus of recent microbiota research has utilized sequencing methods to describe the composition and 
relative abundance of the colonic community. Less attention has been paid to the assessment of specific microbial 
functions, which could be more useful in elucidating the 
gut metabolism of dietary components and links between 
the microbiota and health.
Measurement in faecal or colonic samples of the activity 
of enzymes involved in metabolism of dietary and endogenous compounds has been described for many years. The 
enzymes β-glycosidase (catalysing the hydrolysis of plant 
polyphenol glycosides), β-glucuronidase (cleavage of glucuronidated hepatic dietary metabolites), and various 

14 Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24
1 3
polysaccharide-degrading enzymes have been particularly 
well described [106]. In most cases, this approach of assaying enzyme activities ignores the contribution of individual 
bacterial types and focuses instead on overall activity in 
faecal samples. One of the limitations of this approach is 
that the activities are measured in  vitro in faecal suspensions usually using model substrates so may not reflect 
the activity in  vivo where the substrate concentrations 
and environmental conditions such as pH could be very 
different.
Studies have also been conducted using a range of gut 
bacterial isolates to identify the main organisms involved. 
For example, Dabek et  al. [107] screened 40 bacterial 
strains representative of the main bacterial groups in 
human faeces for β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase activity. There was a higher prevalence of β-glucosidase producers (23/40 strains, including most of the Bifidobacterium
spp. and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and over half of low 
G+C% Gram-positive Firmicutes) than β-glucuronidase 
producers (9/40 strains mainly members of clostridial clusters XIVa and IV). There was also evidence of dramatic 
strain specificity in β-glucuronidase activity in three F. 
prausnitzii isolates. The study also tested whether exposure 
to glycoside and glucuronide substrates induced enzyme 
activity. While there was no effect on most strains, a few 
exhibited several fold (4–12) increases in activity suggesting that changes in overall faecal enzyme activities in 
response to dietary exposure may be due to changes in the 
number of microbes possessing those activities and also 
enzyme induction in certain strains. McIntosh et al. [108] 
combined an enzymatic approach and a clone library analysis to study distribution of the β-glucuronidase genes gus
and BG in the microbiota. Firmicutes accounted for 96% of 
amplified gus sequences, while 59% of BG sequences were 
attributed to Bacteroidetes.
It should be noted that measurement of enzyme activities of individual strains in vitro does not necessarily reflect 
activity in vivo where the environmental conditions, including pH, and relative abundance of the microbial types may 
be very different. For example, Cole et al. [105] compared 
the activity of enzymes measured after in vitro culture and 
also after the same strains has been introduced into germfree rats and found significant differences.
More recently, a variety of molecular methods have been 
exploited to explore enzymatic diversity in the highly complex gut ecosystem. El Kaoutari et al. [109] have designed a 
custom microarray of non-redundant DNA probes for over 
6500 genes coding for enzymes involved in dietary polysaccharide breakdown. It allows the detection of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes present in low abundance bacterial species in the gut. Alternatively, gene-specific primers 
can be used to enumerate all bacteria capable of performing 
a specific role in the gut, using qPCR, as has been done for 
butyrate producing bacteria [17]. However, both these techniques only identify the presence of genes, and not whether 
they are actively expressed at a specific time.
Omics approaches
There is a growing awareness of the importance of the 
gut microbiome in the overall system of the host. This has 
led to the inclusion of top-down approaches studying the 
composition and functionality of the microbiota, so-called 
‘-omics’ approaches. Metagenomics provides insight into 
the genes that could be expressed, while metatranscriptomics reveals information about regulatory networks and gene 
expression and combined with metaproteomics, and metabolomics informs about the functionality of the microbiota 
and, therefore, provides some strong insights into microbial 
activities in the gut.
Studies are performed in an unbiased fashion with the 
focus on hypothesis generation rather than hypothesis testing. This has proven particularly effective for studying the 
gut microbiota due to the relatively limited understanding 
of this multi-dimensional dynamic variable. Each ‘-omic’ 
technology provides its own unique perspective of the 
microbiota and its impact on the host, so to fully exploit 
their potential multiple ‘-omic’ approaches can be applied 
simultaneously and results integrated, preferably from the 
same sample. With the help of mathematical modelling, 
this enables a comprehensive understanding of the microbial ecosystem to be gleaned and its contribution to the 
overall biological system to be studied at the molecular 
level. This represents a significant technical and bioinformatic challenge, although a new methodological framework developed by Roume et al. [110] for the co-extraction 
of DNA, large and small RNA, proteins, and polar and nonpolar metabolites from single samples of microbial communities represents a significant step in this process.
Metagenomics
Metagenomics has extensively been used to investigate 
differences in microbiota composition in disease states 
such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and diabetes 
compared to healthy individuals, but it has also revealed 
novel changes in microbiota function in some diseases 
[111]. For example, Wei et al. [112] reported that the faecal microbiota of 20 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis of 
the liver showed enrichment of metabolism of glutathione, 
branched-chain amino acids, nitrogen, lipids, and gluconeogenesis, and a decrease in aromatic amino acids and bile 
acid-related metabolism in comparison to control subjects.
Metagenomic analysis is being increasingly used to 
study functional genes of the gut microbiota. Jones et  al. 
[63] used this methodology to study the distribution of BSH 

Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24 15
1 3
genes. Via metagenomic analyses, they identified functional BSH in all the main bacterial divisions and Archaea 
in the gut and demonstrated that BSH is a conserved adaptation to the amount of conjugated bile acids in the gut and 
exhibits a high level of redundancy. Of particular relevance 
to the present review is the approach taken in a recent paper 
by Mohammed and Guda [113]. The authors developed 
an ensemble of machine learning methods termed ECemble (Enzyme Classification using ensemble approach) to 
model and predict enzymes from protein sequences and 
identify enzyme classes and subclasses at high resolution. 
The method was then applied to predict enzymes encoded 
by the human gut microbiome from gut metagenomic samples, and to study the role of microbe-derived enzymes in 
the human metabolism. They identified 48 pathways that 
have at least one bacteria-encoded enzyme. The pathways 
were primarily involved in the metabolism of amino acids, 
lipids, co-factors, and vitamins. Subsequently, the methods 
were used to demonstrate differences in the profiles of gut 
microbiota-derived enzymes in lean and obese subjects 
and in patients with IBD. For example, the microbiota of 
obese subjects was enriched in polygalacturonase, which is 
encoded by Bacteroides and Prevotella species. In contrast, 
urease-encoding bacteria were found in fewer numbers in 
obese versus lean subjects.
A number of metagenomic studies have focused on socalled carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) due to 
the critical role that the gut microorganisms play in the 
breakdown of dietary fibre and other non-absorbed carbohydrates in the gut. Such an approach is not restricted to 
the study of the enzymatic activity of cultivable microbes 
and has revealed a wide diversity of CAZymes of at least 
81 families of glycoside-hydrolases. For example, Tasse 
et al. [114] using in-depth pyrosequencing, discovered 73 
CAZymes from 35 different families and also identified 18 
multigenic clusters encoding complementary enzyme activities for fibre degradation.
Single cell genomics is an emerging technology in which 
single microbial cells are isolated from a sample, their 
DNA extracted and amplified and then shotgun sequenced 
[115]. The advantage of this approach is that genomic data 
can be placed in a phylogenetic context even where the 
function of a putative gene is unknown and information 
from rare or uncharacterized species can be obtained. This 
has the potential to complement metagenomics by aiding 
the functional assignment of metagenomic data.
Although metagenomics is a powerful tool for investigating the gut microbiota, it does have limitations. These 
have been discussed in detail by Wang et  al. [111] but 
include the requirement for sufficient high-quality DNA, 
the impact of different DNA extraction methods and kits on 
results, and of particular relevance for functional metagenomics, the limitations in the size and quality of reference 
databases, which impedes the assignment of functions to 
the data obtained. Finally, the presence of a gene does not 
inform us about gene expression patterns. Metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabonomics enable the latter to be more effectively addressed.
Metatranscriptomics
Metatranscriptomics extracts and sequences mRNAs 
from a microbial ecosystem to determine the genes that 
may be expressed in that community. It usually involves 
reverse transcription to generate cDNA, which is then 
sequenced using similar methodologies as for metagenomics. Metatranscriptomics allows the identification of novel 
non-coding RNAs, including small RNAs thought to play 
important roles in biological processes such as quorum 
sensing and stress response [116]. The approach has mostly 
been applied to samples from water and soil environments 
and less frequently to the gut microbiota [117, 118] and the 
microbiota studies need to be interpreted with considerable 
caution, given the major limitation of the short half-life of 
bacterial mRNAs, although this is less of an issue for studies using ribosomal RNAs, which are more stable.
Gosalbes et  al. [118] performed a metatranscriptomic 
analysis of faecal microbiota from 10 healthy subjects. 
Microbial cDNAs from each sample were sequenced by 
454 methodology and analysis of the 16 S rRNA transcripts 
revealed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the sources 
of the greatest number of transcripts (49 and 31%, respectively) with smaller numbers from Proteobacteria (3.7%), 
Actinobacteria (0.4%), and Lentisphaerae (0.2%). The 
majority of the Firmicutes sequences fell into the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, which contain 
pectin and cellulose degraders. In the Bacteroidetes phylum 
Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rickenellaceae families were functionally the most important. Interestingly, the 
most active families were the same in all the volunteers.
The non-ribosomal transcripts from the faecal samples 
were searched by BLASTX against an established NCBI 
COG database to obtain a functional distribution for each 
sample. The pattern was very similar for all the samples 
with carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, and synthesis of cellular components being the main activities. Other areas such as amino 
acid and lipid metabolism, cell motility, and secondary 
metabolite biosynthesis were underrepresented in the 
metatranscriptome. These results are consistent with an 
earlier, smaller study by Turnbaugh et al. [117] in monozygotic twins in which the genes with higher relative expression included those for carbohydrate metabolism, energy 
metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and those associated 
with essential cell processes, e.g., RNA polymerase and 
glycolysis.

As with all the ‘-omics’ approaches, metatranscriptomics has its limitations and studies are challenging both 
technically and in terms of bioinformatics. The short halflife of mRNA leads to difficulty in the detection of shortterm responses to environmental changes, consequentially 
extrapolating results obtained from transcriptional analysis 
of faecal samples to functions within the large intestine 
itself can present problems [115, 117].
Metaproteomics
Metaproteomics aims to characterize the complete profile 
of gene translation products and can yield additional information about post-translational modifications and localization over that provided by metatranscriptomics measurements [119]. One of the advantages of metaproteomics 
is that it is possible to link proteins to specific taxonomic 
groups, thus providing insight into the microbes at species 
and strain level involved in specific catalytic functions and 
pathways, i.e., genotype–phenotype linkages [120].
Methodologies for metaproteomics are in a state of 
development, but typically they involve heat treatment of 
the faecal sample and extensive bead beating to extract 
and denature the proteins, which are subsequently enzymatically digested to peptides. Peptide analysis is usually 
by nano-2D-LC-MS-MS and COG assignments are determined for each peptide sequence by BLAST against the 
NCBI COG database. Microbial community functions are 
analyzed by grouping proteins into COG categories.
Metaproteomic studies on the gut microbiota to date 
have been performed in small numbers of subjects (usually 
n=1–3), which limits the conclusions that can be drawn, 
but the results have shown some consistencies. Verberkmoes et al. [121] conducted a faecal metaproteomic analysis of a pair of adult female monozygotic twins. Analysis 
was by nano-2D-LC-MS-MS and the proteins identified 
by database searches were classified into COG categories. 
In both subjects, the most abundant COG functions were 
energy production, amino-acid metabolism, nucleotide 
metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and 
protein folding. The authors compared the metaproteomic 
profile with a previously published metagenomic profile of 
two individuals which revealed that in contrast to the most 
abundant functions identified in the metaproteome above, 
the metagenome was dominated by proteins involved in 
inorganic ion metabolism, cell wall and membrane biogenesis, cell division, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
Kolmeder et  al. [122] investigated composition and 
temporal stability of the faecal metaproteome in samples 
collected at 2 time points from 3 healthy subjects over a 
period of 6–12 months. The results indicated that the faecal 
metaproteome is subject-specific and is stable over a 1-year 
period. A stable common core of about 1000 proteins was 
recognised in each of the subjects. The most abundant core 
protein was found to be glutamate dehydrogenase, and this 
enzyme showed high level of redundancy in the intestinal 
tract, since it was associated with a number of microbial 
families, Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococ‑
caceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae. Other high abundance 
proteins included pyruvate-formate lyase, which converts 
pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate, and chaperone proteins involved in protein folding and Fe-S cluster formation. About 10% of the total proteome comprised proteins 
involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism including ABC sugar transporters and glycolytic enzymes. When 
the COGs were mapped onto pathways, the main functional 
categories were metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides, 
energy, amino acids, and co-factors and vitamins (especially B12 and folic acid).
Metaproteomics has also been applied to faecal samples 
from a lean and an obese subject and to comparisons of 
Crohn’s Disease patients and healthy subjects (reviewed by 
Xiong et al. [119]). Young et al. [120] used shotgun proteomics to characterize the functional changes in the faecal 
microbiota 7–21  days after birth of a preterm infant. The 
results suggested that the developing microbial community 
initially focuses its resources on cell division, protein production, and lipid metabolism later switching to more complex metabolic functions, such as carbohydrate metabolism, 
and secreting and trafficking proteins. It is noteworthy that 
this functional distribution seen after 3 weeks was similar 
to that observed in the adult human gut [121].
Metaproteomics is a developing technology and has its 
limitations, in particular there is no reference protocol, so 
it can be difficult to compare studies and the bioinformatic 
systems for metaproteomics are less well developed than 
those for metagenomics. Kolmeder and de Vos [123] have 
discussed in detail published methodologies, highlighting 
the importance of sampling techniques and sample preparation and processing.
Metabolic profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics)
Metabolic profiling has emerged as a powerful systems 
biology approach simultaneously measuring the lowmolecular weight compounds in a biological sample, 
capturing the metabolic profile or phenotype. In the host, 
these metabolic signatures contain thousands of molecular components that arise from endogenous and exogenous metabolic processes, environmental inputs, and 
metabolic interactions between the host and environment. 
The environmental inputs can include dietary components 
and products of gut microbial activity. A major strength 
of using metabonomics to study the gut microbiota is the 
ability to measure metabolites in host samples that derive 
directly from the microbiome, for example the SCFAs. This 

Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24 17
1 3
provides a direct read-out of gut microbial activity and variations due to diet. Furthermore, upon absorption from the 
gut, microbial products can enter host metabolic processes 
resulting in downstream metabolic perturbations and the 
generation of microbial-host co-metabolites, all of which 
can be captured by metabolic profiling.
Practically, metabolic profiling can be applied to a range 
of different sample types and experimental models. It can 
be used to characterize the metabolites in samples from 
in  vitro experiments, including pure cultures and complex gut models, and various sample types collected from 
in vivo studies [13]. In vivo samples can include biofluids, 
such as urine, blood, faecal water, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid, and various tissue samples such as those collected 
from the gut, liver and brain. To measure the metabolic 
profile of a sample, two analytical platforms are typically 
used, 1HNMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy (MS). 
Both techniques are capable of simultaneously capturing 
quantitative and structural information on a broad range 
of metabolites in an unbiased manner in a single measurement. Comprehensive reviews on these analytical techniques have been published [124–126]. 1
H NMR spectroscopy measures protons (1
H) on metabolites in a sample and 
MS measures the exact mass of molecular ions in a sample 
and how they fragment. This information can then be used 
to identify the metabolites present and their abundance. 
MS is usually preceded by a separation step to allow the 
analysis of complex mixtures, which includes liquid or gas 
chromatography, or in some cases capillary electrophoresis. 
Although a single analytical technique is routinely applied 
in metabonomic studies, these two techniques are complementary and their parallel application can provide wide 
metabolome coverage.
The metabolic phenotype acquired from these techniques is multivariate in nature containing hundreds 
to thousands of metabolites. To extract latent information associated with gut microbial function or their influence on host metabolism from this multi-dimensional 
data, a range of pattern recognition techniques are applied 
[127–129]. Standard multivariate statistical techniques 
used for metabolic profiling studies include the unsupervised approaches, principal components analysis (PCA), 
and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and the supervised approach, projection to latent structures (PLS) analysis. Unsupervised methods are concerned with modelling 
variation within the data and have no a priori knowledge of 
sample classification. In contrast, supervised methods use 
known information of the samples (e.g., germ-free versus 
conventional status; placebo versus prebiotic intervention) 
to extract information in the metabolic data that are related 
to this information.
The utility of this approach for studying the microbiome has been demonstrated in animal models of altered 
microbial status, such as germ-free, gnotobiotic, antibiotictreated animals, and also in human studies [82, 130–132]. 
These studies have shown the extensive reach of the gut 
microbiota throughout the metabolic system of the host and 
the diverse pathways modulated. This is not just restricted 
locally to the immediate environment of the gut but systemically to peripheral tissues such as the heart and brain. For 
example, dietary choline from sources such as red meat and 
eggs can be metabolized by the microbes in the gut to trimethylamine and dimethylamine. Trimethylamine is toxic 
and requires oxidation in the liver by the flavin-containing 
monooxygenase 3 (FMO 3) enzyme before being excreted 
as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO can be used 
as an electron acceptor by Escherichia coli, and, interestingly, has been implicated as a risk factor for CVD [133].
A vast amount of information is captured with metabolic profiling and various inherent (e.g., genetic constitution, age, and gender) and environmental (e.g., diet, alcohol 
intake, and drug therapy) factors can influence the metabolic phenotype. Unrelated variation in these metabolic 
signatures can often mask or obscure the variation resulting 
from gut microbial activity. As such, careful study design 
is essential when investigating the role of the gut microbiota on host metabolism to minimise this unrelated noise. 
Although this can be tightly controlled in animal studies, 
it represents a major challenge for human studies. One 
way to overcome this issue is through the use of statistical approaches. Orthogonal projections to latent structures 
(OPLS) is one such method applying an orthogonal signal 
correction (OSC) to remove metabolic variation unrelated 
to the variable being studied. This improves the interpretation of the data enabling the influence of the gut microbiota to be illuminated. Another limitation in metabolic 
profiling studies is the metabolite identification stage. Once 
significant metabolic associations are discovered assigning an identity, pathway and/or function to these features 
can represent a bottleneck in the metabonomic workflow. 
Advancements in databases, software platforms, and analytical approaches are helping to overcome these limitations and expedite this process.
Stable isotope probing (SIP)
The use of stable isotopes (e.g., 13C, 15N, and 18O) can help 
elucidate the fate of specific compounds within complex 
microbial systems such as the gut and can be particularly 
useful if combined with ‘-omics’ techniques [115]. Tannock et  al. [134] used the technique to identify the main 
microbial users of inulin in the rat gut. Inulin labelled with 
13C was fed to rats and RNA extracted from caecal contents 
by isopycnic buoyant density gradients was used to detect 
labelled RNA from cells that had metabolized the inulin. 
16 S rRNA genes amplified from cDNA from the labelled 

18 Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24
1 3
fractions were sequenced and showed that Bacteroides uni‑
formis, Blautia glucerasea, Clostridium indolis, and Bifido‑
bacterium animalis were the main species utilizing inulin 
in these rats.
Use of mathematical modelling to mimic the gut 
ecosystem
Meta-omic analyses have resulted in a tremendous amount 
of data on the composition, encoded functionalities, and 
metabolic output of the human gut microbiota [135]. However, the inherent complexity of the gut ecosystem hinders 
the interpretation of this wealth of data [136]. A systemslevel understanding of the microbiota has to include the 
underlying complex interactions, since the gut ecosystem 
as a whole is more than the sum of its parts [136]. A complete, integrated view of the human gut microbiota requires 
the use of mathematical models.
Identifying novel food ingredients which may have 
beneficial effects on the gut microbiota when provided as 
dietary supplements is often difficult due to the large number of variables that need to be compared in well-designed 
controlled human intervention studies. Experimental models (small animals and fermenter systems) have proved 
extremely useful, but even they prove time consuming and 
not all variables can be compared. Mathematical models 
offer an alternative to try and evaluate bacterial interactions 
and the impact of different dietary components on microbial composition and activity, at least with the aim of refining the choices to be used in the experimental situation.
One approach applied to simulate the behaviour of gut 
microbial communities is kinetic modelling. A kinetic 
model showed the role of bacterial cross-feeding in the 
conversion of lactate to butyrate by two distinct but abundant human gut bacteria, Eubacterium hallii and Anaero‑
stipes coli [137]. Kettle et al. [138, 139] created a minimal 
model of the intestinal ecosystem, distilling the microbiota 
down into 10 bacterial functional groups, each comprising 
of a mixture of at least 10 bacteria. Pure and mixed culture data was used to provide assumptions of growth rates, 
substrate specificity and metabolic activities for each of 
the functional groups. The model successfully predicted 
the switch between high butyrate production at pH 5.5 and 
high propionate production at pH 6.5 that had occurred 
in a previous continuous flow fermenter experiment [139, 
140]. The model was also used to estimate the effect of 
removing entire functional groups (or single strains within 
a functional group) on the community profile and activity, 
revealing changes in both SCFA concentrations and abundances of other groups [139]. Such models could be of 
huge benefit in assessing the consequence of bacterial species shown to be missing, or extra, in disease states on the 
development of the disease. They would also show whether 
simply adding back a ‘missing’ bacterium would be sufficient to potentially change the course of the development 
of the disease. Such models could also be used to illustrate 
the potential consequences to microbial composition and 
metabolite production during periods of starvation or substrate depletion or replacement.
Agent‑based modelling
Agent-based modelling (ABM) is another approach frequently employed to study the dynamic behaviour of 
ecological systems in silico. In ABM, objects with welldefined properties (representing, e.g., bacterial cells), are 
allowed to interact with each other, resulting in a dynamic 
model that can depict real-time behaviour of a biological 
system [141]. A recent study used ABM to simulate the 
positive (e.g., mutualistic) and negative (e.g., competitive) 
interactions between two bacteria representing a typical 
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, respectively [141]. A simulation of exposure to antibiotics and subsequent recovery 
confirmed that feedback mechanisms between bacterial 
species enabled the restoration of system stability after 
antibiotic perturbation [141].
Topological analysis of metabolic networks
A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction summarizes 
known biochemical reactions of a target organism in a wellstructured manner. Several studies have applied metabolic 
networks of the human gut microbiome, revealing topological properties of its global metabolic network and characterizing the microbiome’s metabolic potential (reviewed in 
Manor et al. and Heinken and Thiele [136, 142]). Recently, 
metabolic networks of gut microbes have been integrated 
with a Boolean dynamic model constructed from time 
series metagenomic data [143]. The model predicted that 
the commensal Barnesiella intestinihominis can inhibit the 
growth of Clostridium difficile, which was validated experimentally [143]. Another study integrated community-wide 
metabolic networks with metagenomic and metabolomic 
data and the community-wide metabolic turnover was 
subsequently predicted for the vaginal and the gut microbiome [144]. While correlation-based statistical analyses 
of metabolomic measurements are not mechanistic, this 
framework has the advantage of proposing mechanisms for 
the contributions of species to the turnover of particular 
metabolites [144].
Modelling emerging phenotypic properties
The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) 
approach uses genome-scale reconstructions (GENREs) 
that are constructed from the genome of a target organism 

Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24 19
1 3
and curated and validated against the available literature 
[145]. More than 20 GENREs have been built for microorganisms inhabiting the human body [142]. GENREs are 
converted into mathematical models that are tailored to specific conditions by enforcing constraints: physico-chemical 
(e.g., mass–charge balance), environmental (e.g., nutrient 
availability), and regulatory (e.g., gene expression) [145]. 
By defining an objective, e.g., biomass production, metabolic fluxes through the network that satisfy this objective 
are predicted [146]. For instance, by imposing constraints 
on nutrient availability, the growth requirements of a reconstructed organism can be predicted. This approach resulted 
in the prediction and subsequent experimental validation of 
a defined medium for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [147]. 
Moreover, GENREs enable the evaluation of a species’ 
functional repertoire. In a large-scale study, metabolic networks were retrieved from the genomes of 301 representative human gut microbes and their metabolic capabilities 
were systematically compared in the context of phylogenetic distance between species [148]. The analysis revealed 
an exponential relationship between metabolic and phylogenetic distance, with closely related species being more 
metabolically diverse than could be expected in a linear 
relationship [148].
Of particular interest is the prediction of in silico interactions in microbial communities, and between the gut 
microbiota and the human host. Similar to the kinetic 
model described above, such a multi-species model can 
predict the effect of perturbing community composition 
(e.g., the removal of key species). Moreover, the effects 
of varying nutrient environments (e.g., different diets) on 
the community can be explored. In a first effort to model 
a host-gut microbe symbiosis, a metabolic model of the 
mouse was joined with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and 
their mutually beneficial cross-feeding was simulated on 
five dietary regimes [149]. Moreover, the rescue of lethal 
host gene defects by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was predicted [149]. The effect of a simplified model gut microbiota on human metabolites was modelled by joining the 
human reconstruction Recon2 with 11 published, manually curated GENREs of gut microbes from three phyla 
[150]. The combined contribution of secretion products by 
microbes and dietary input on the host’s metabolome was 
quantified on four simulated diets [150]. The underlying 
mechanisms were predicted for the microbial contribution 
to host secretion for the examples of glutathione, taurine, 
and leukotrienes [150].
Constraint-based modelling is commonly applied 
to the in silico prediction of microbe–microbe interactions (reviewed in Heinken and Thiele, Biggs et  al., and 
Zomorrodi et al. [142, 151, 152]). Typically, two or more 
GENREs are joined to construct community models with 
well-defined species–species boundaries, thus allowing 
the prediction of metabolic cross-feeding between species 
[142]. To investigate the effect of varying metabolic environments on microbe–microbe interactions, 11 published 
gut microbe GENREs were joined in all pairwise combinations and the outcome (positive, neutral, negative interaction) was predicted [153]. The metabolic exchange and 
the distribution of resources between the pairs were simulated on four simulated gut microenvironments and three 
diets [153]. The model predicted that the need to regenerate 
reducing equivalents enforced mutualism in certain pairs 
under anoxic conditions [153]. In  vitro screens of pairwise interactions between microbes are laborious and the 
described in silico framework constitutes an important first 
step for the prediction of candidate pairs of interest that 
would be subsequently validated experimentally.
GENREs also provide a useful framework for the contextualization of meta-omic data, with a variety of constraint-based methods for the integration of such measurements already available [154].
In summary, important advances have been made in 
the construction of mathematical models that capture key 
aspects of the gut microbiota and its interactions with its 
host, summarize the current knowledge on its metabolism, 
and propose hypotheses that can be experimentally validated. In future efforts, such models will result in the elucidation of previously unknown, non-intuitive relationships 
between the gut microbiota and host physiological states. 
Moreover, dietary and drug interventions to favourably 
manipulate the human gut microbiota may be predicted in 
silico prior to experimental validation. Knowledge of an 
individual’s microbial composition will ultimately enable 
models to be tailored to predict effects of specific diets or 
supplements at an individual level.
Conclusions
The wealth of metabolic functionality encoded within the 
gut microbiome extends the biochemical flexibility of the 
host to process a wide range of dietary substrates. Carbohydrate metabolism and transport is clearly a major catalytic 
function of the microbiota with important consequences for 
the host, and the metabolic pathways and end products have 
been well studied and are characterized by great flexibility 
in response to substrate availability. Similarly, pathways for 
metabolism of other dietary macromolecules, namely protein, have been elucidated as have those for vitamin synthesis. The microbiota also has extensive capacity to metabolize phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols, by diverse, 
well-characterized pathways. There is extensive evidence 
that inter-individual differences in metabolism of dietary polyphenols are largely a consequence of differences 
in gut microbiota composition and that these can have 

20 Eur J Nutr (2018) 57:1–24
1 3
implications for the effects of some polyphenols on health. 
It should be noted that the uptake and utilization of microbial metabolites by other members of the microbiota and 
absorption by the host result in a highly dynamic system 
of metabolic fluxes and makes determination of changes in 
concentrations of metabolites with time very difficult using 
current single snapshot analyses in faecal samples. Application of stable isotope probes in combination with mathematical modelling may prove valuable in this area.
Importantly, there exists a large amount of functional 
redundancy within the microbiota with different bacteria performing the same or similar functions. BSHs and 
CAZymes are a good example of this redundancy, being 
encoded in the genomes of bacteria from several different 
phyla [62]. As such, compositional variation may not necessarily translate into a functional variation relevant to the 
host. Furthermore, extensive cross-feeding networks exist 
within this dynamic ecosystem resulting in a range of possible outcomes for the same substrate depending upon the 
species present and their proximity. Accordingly, there is 
a growing appreciation that measuring composition alone 
is no longer sufficient to gain meaningful insights into the 
functional status of the gut microbiota, its metabolic interaction with the host, and its potential to modulate host 
health and disease.
Gut microbiota-derived products can be absorbed from 
the gut and enter host endogenous and exogenous pathways 
to influence the overall metabolic phenotype of the host. In 
addition, metabolites generated by the host can be secreted 
into the gut via the enterohepatic circulation and serve as 
substrates for the resident microbes. Collectively, these processes result in a biochemical cross-talk between the host 
genome and microbiome with the microbiota able to exert 
a strong influence on the metabolic phenotype of the host. 
For example, gut microbial BSH enzyme expression in 
mice altered plasma bile acid signatures and concomitantly 
the transcription of genes involved in host lipid metabolism 
and metabolic signalling pathways and also influenced cholesterol metabolism and weight gain [155]. Recent evidence 
indicates that the SCFAs acetate, propionate and butyrate 
can play a significant role in central appetite regulation (via 
hypothalamic neuronal activation patterning and changes 
in the expression profiles of regulatory neuropeptides) and 
energy homeostasis via influencing intestinal gluconeogenesis. Further study of these types of interactions is essential 
to understand how the gut microbiota influence host health 
and disease.
