Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. However, treatment options are limited and often
inefficient. The aim of this study was to determine current survival rates for patients diagnosed with HCC and to identify prognostic
factors, which will help in choosing optimal therapies for individual patients. A retrospective analysis of medical records was
performed on 389 patients who were identified through the central tumour registry at our institution from 1998 to 2003. Clinical
parameters, treatments received and survival curves from time of diagnosis were analysed. Overall median survival was 11 months.
Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 80.5% of all patients. A total of 170 patients received transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and/or
percutaneous ethanol injections (PEI) with a median survival rate of 16 months for patients receiving TACE, 11 months for patients
receiving PEI and 24 months for patients receiving TACE followed by PEI. Independent negative prognostic parameters for survival
were the presence of portal vein thrombosis, advanced liver cirrhosis (Child – Pugh score B or C) and a score of 42. This study will
help to estimate survival rates for patients with HCC according to their clinical status at diagnosis and the treatments received.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer
worldwide, and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related
death (Parkin et al, 2001; Bosch et al, 2004). Although HCC occurs
more frequently in Southeast Asia and Africa, its incidence in
Western countries has almost doubled in the past 20 years (ElSerag, 2004) due to an increase of hepatitis C virus and alcoholinduced liver cirrhosis (Morgan et al, 2004).
Curative resection of HCC is possible (Hoofnagle, 2004),
however the success of this approach is limited because of the
high rate of tumour recurrence or the development of new
tumours in the cirrhotic liver (Llovet et al, 2004). Liver
transplantation has become a frequently used alternative, but it
is clearly not possible for all patients and a significant number of
HCC reoccur in the transplanted liver (Schlitt et al, 1999).
Local ablative therapies are increasingly being used to treat
HCC, either as definitive therapy or as an intermediate step in
patients awaiting liver transplantation. There is no standard
treatment for unresectable HCC, but transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been shown to increase survival in a randomized
controlled trial (Llovet et al, 2002). Percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEI) has also proven to be relatively easy to perform and is
inexpensive (Lencioni et al, 2004). Retrospective data from one
Japanese centre suggests that percutaneous tumour ablation
methods can become as efficient as surgical procedures (Omata
et al, 2004).
In contrast to other cancers, the prognosis of patients with HCC
is not solely related to tumour stage. Cirrhosis underlies the
neoplasm in most cases and has major impact on the prognosis of
patients with HCC. Accordingly, different prognostic systems
assessing liver function and tumour stage have been developed
such as the Okuda staging (Okuda et al, 1985), CLIP score (2000)
and the BCLC (Llovet et al, 2004). Okuda staging is based on the
size of the tumour, presence of ascites, serum albumin and
bilirubin levels. CLIP score is based on Child – Pugh stage, tumour
morphology, the presence of portal vein thrombosis and the AFP
level, while the BCLC staging is similar to the Okuda staging
system but includes the presence of vascular invasion if present.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a major health problem around the
world. However, the biology of the disease varies between different
areas. In Asia, HBV infection is the major risk factor for HCC,
whereas HCV infection and alcohol use are more frequently the
cause for liver cirrhosis and HCC in the Western world (Wang
et al, 2002). Additionally, the application of treatment options and
the success with which they are applied varies as well, so that it is
essential to study not only responses to therapy and overall
survival in patients but also the prognostic risk factors (Stuart
et al, 1996). Until today there is only limited data available
describing the outcome related to baseline patient characteristics
among all patients with HCC in Western countries.

Clinical Studies

Therefore, we have collected data from a large group of HCC
patients, who were consecutively presented to our referral centre in
Germany between January 1998 and December 2003. We have
retrospectively examined the clinical baseline characteristics of 389
patients, as well as their respective forms of therapy and ultimate
outcomes. Using uni- and multivariate regression analysis, we have
attempted to construct both a descriptive evaluation of the
individual subgroups and their survival and to identify possible
clinically evident prognostic factors at the time of presentation.
These data will help to find optimal treatment modalities for
individual patients in the future and build a base for future clinical
trials, when different therapy algorithms will be evaluated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The central tumour registry at Medizinische Hochschule Hannover
has collected data from all patients, who were presented with HCC
at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology since 1997. We have examined the medical records of all
patients who were presented at our Department between January
1998 and December 2004 to confirm the diagnosis and relevant
clinical parameters. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed
according to EASL guidelines (Bruix et al, 2001). The following
parameters were examined: age, sex, clinical or pathological stage
using the Okuda and CLIP score systems (Okuda et al, 1985; The
Cancer of the Liver Italian Program, 2000). Presence or absence of
cirrhosis was analysed and, if cirrhosis was present, the extent was
classified according to the Child –Pugh classification (Child and
Turcotte, 1964). Any risk factors for developing cirrhosis were
registered including hepatitis B or C, haemochromatosis, alcohol
abuse or autoimmune hepatitis. Alpha-fetoprotein levels were
analysed in all patients in the central clinical biochemistry
laboratory of our institution. In addition, any form of therapy
undergone by the patient was recorded. Survival was determined
from the time of initial diagnosis. Actuarial survival was calculated
using the methods of Kaplan and Meier (1958). Baseline
parameters were analysed with the log-rank test to identify
potential prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis was then
performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox
and Oakes, 1984) including those parameters, which were
significant according to the univariate test.
Survival curves were compared using the Cox –Mantel log-rank
test. Univariate and multiple regression analysis of covariance
among patient characteristics were performed with the aid of SSP
Software.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Three hundred and eighty-nine patients were seen at the
Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology
between January 1998 and December 2003 with confirmed
diagnosis of HCC. Patient characteristics are summarised in
Table 1. The male to female ratio was 3.8 : 1 and liver cirrhosis was
present in 80.5% of the cases. Viral hepatitis and alcohol were the
most common cause for liver cirrhosis. The average age was 64
years old (mean 18 –85 years). In all, 52% of the patients had one
liver lesion, 42% had two or three lesions and the remaining
patients had more than three lesions. We have used Okuda staging
and CLIP score analysis to classify baseline parameters for those
HCC patients, for whom detailed staging information was
available. Of 319 patients, 24% were classified as Okuda I, 64%
as Okuda II, and 12% as Okuda III. Twenty (8%) patients had a
CLIP score of zero. Twenty-six (11%) patients had a CLIP score of
one. Sixty-five (27%) patients had a CLIP score of two and 129
(54%) patients had a CLIP score above two. A total of 33 (9%)
patients had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Complete
and partial portal vein thrombosis was found in 17 (4%) and 65
(17%) of all patients. AFP levels were elevated above 400 ng/ml in
137 (41%) patients and the elevated bilirubin levels were found in
49% of the patients.
Treatment
A total of 37 patients underwent surgical therapy including liver
transplantation in 12 cases. Patients, who were not eligible for
primary surgery, were treated according the algorithm shown in
Figure 1. If possible, all patients underwent primarily TACE
followed by PEI as previously suggested by Allgaier (Allgaier et al,
1998). If PEI was not possible after the first TACE, this treatment
was repeated if needed until the tumour progressed despite
treatment. Overall, TACE was performed in 103 patients. A
mixture of lipiodol, cisplatin and doxorubicin was used in most
cases and no TACE-related deaths occurred. Percutaneous ethanol
injection was performed in 121 patients, of which 52 patients
received both, PEI and TACE. Percutaneous ethanol injection was
repeated if new tumours appeared. Tables 3 and 4 show the
number of PEIs performed for each group of patients. Finally, 147
patients were not eligible for either of the three treatment options
(surgery, PEI and TACE) due to the extent of liver cirrhosis or
tumour and were treated with sandostatin, tamoxifen, pravasin,
systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care (Table 2).
Survival
Average follow-up for all HCC patients in this study was 20.4
months. Overall median survival of all 389 patients was 11 months
from the date of diagnosis. The 1-year survival rate was 49%, after
3 years 19% of all patients were still alive (Figure 2). Next, patients
were subdivided into different groups depending on their clinical
status at the time of initial presentation at our department. If liver
cirrhosis was present, the Child score system was used to
categorize patients into patients with Child A, Child B and Child
C cirrhosis, respectively. The 1- and 3-year survival rate differed
significantly between patients without cirrhosis or Child A
cirrhosis and those with Child B or C cirrhosis (Figure 3), while
there was no significant difference in survival between patients
with Child A cirrhosis and no cirrhosis with a median survival of
17 and 16 months, respectively. Patients with Child B cirrhosis had
a median survival rate of 6 months and patients with Child C
cirrhosis had the poorest median survival of 4 months.
Additionally, patient’s status at initial presentation in our
department was rated according to the CLIP score. As expected,
patients with a CLIP score of zero points had the best median
survival of 36 months (Figure 4). Patients with a CLIP score of 1 –2

had a median survival of 28 and 16 months and finally patients
with a CLIP score 42 points had only a median survival of 8
months.
We also compared the group of patients with partial and
complete portal vein thrombosis, since it has been previously
suggested that thrombosis of the portal vein is an independent

we were able to confirm this observation. Patients with portal vein
thrombosis had a significantly lower median survival of 6 months
in contrast to patients without portal vein thrombosis, who had a
median survival rate of 16 months (Figure 5).
Finally, patient survival was analysed on the basis of the
treatments that the patients received. As shown in Figure 6, there
was a significant segregation in survival curves. As expected,
patients who underwent surgical therapy, had the best median
survival rate of 52 months, followed by patients receiving TACE
and PEI (24 months), TACE (16 months) and PEI (11 months).
Patients, who were not eligible for surgery, TACE or PEI had a
median survival rate of 6 months.
Uni- and multivariate analysis of potential factors affecting
patient survival was performed in order to identify those risk
factors, which predict survival of patients. This analysis is
important to identify optimal therapies for patients with HCC.

of the tumour in the liver were all evaluated. Only, CLIP score,
Child stage and the presence of portal vein thrombosis were
identified to be independent risk factors affecting patient survival
as shown in Table 5 by multivariate analysis. Additionally,
bilirubin, number and size of individual intrahepatic tumours
were identified as independent risk factors by univariate analysis.
DISCUSSION
We have analysed 389 patients with HCC, who were treated at our
department between 1998 and 2003. In contrast to a series of other
published studies (Chevret et al, 1999; Llovet et al, 1999; The
Cancer of the Liver Italian Program, 2000; Villa et al, 2000; Rabe
et al, 2001; Herold et al, 2002), this study included a high number
of patients treated by TACE and PEI, which have become the most
frequently used treatments in the Western World. No patient was
excluded from our retrospective analysis in contrast to those
studies, who investigated only the effect of surgery or local ablative
therapy (Tanaka et al, 1998; Schlitt et al, 1999; O’Suilleabhain et al,
2003; Jaeck et al, 2004). Therefore, this data reflects the current
situation, for unselected patients with HCC similar to a different
study published 9 years ago (Stuart et al, 1996).
As previously reported for other non-Asian centres (Stuart et al,
1996; Rabe et al, 2001; Erhardt et al, 2002), our patient population
differed significantly from Asian centres (Sithinamsuwan et al,

2000) with less HbsAg-positive patients in our study population.
Moreover, the average age of our patients was 64 years old
indicating that currently HCC is more frequently diagnosed in
older patients as described by others (Dohmen et al, 2004).
In contrast to most retrospective reports, which focus on the
epidemiology and risk factors contributing to development of HCC
in Western countries (Kubicka et al, 2000; Rabe et al, 2001; Llovet
and Beaugrand, 2003; Caselitz et al, 2004), our analysis was
undertaken to analyse patient survival according to clinical stage
and possible treatment respectively and in order to identify
possible prognostic factors, which might prove to be helpful, when
the best possible treatment has to be chosen for patients with HCC.
According to tumour stage, extent of liver cirrhosis and other
clinical factors, different treatment options were chosen in this
study as indicated in Figure 1. Therefore different treatments were
not directly comparable and survival differences might be due to
different stages of the disease.
The number of patients eligible for surgical resection was much
smaller than the number of patients receiving TACE and PEI. In
addition, the tumour stage and cirrhosis differed between these
two groups leading to the observed differences in survival in
contrast to studies published by others (Llovet et al, 2004). Similar
to other reports, we saw a median survival of 24 months for the
patients receiving TACE followed by PEI (Allgaier et al, 1998). A
significant number of patients, who were not eligible for a
combined treatment of TACE and PEI due to their stage of
disease, were treated with TACE or PEI only. As expected these
patients had lower survival rates. However, with minor differences
depending on the group of patients selected and treatment
modalities chosen, similar results were reported by others (Stuart
et al, 1996; Allgaier et al, 1998; Bruix and Llovet, 2002; Herold et al,
2002; O’Suilleabhain et al, 2003).
Independent prognostic factors can help in assessing the
individual prognosis for patients with HCC and are therefore
critical for the patients. In our analysis we were able to identify
CLIP score, the presence of portal vein thrombosis and extent of
liver cirrhosis as independent prognostic factors and demonstrate
the pivotal role of liver cirrhosis for the prognosis of patients with
HCC, which has previously also been described by a number of
different groups (Bruix and Llovet, 2002).
In summary, our retrospective study provides important
information for the treatment of patients with HCC, while it
should be emphasised that firm definite conclusions should only
be drawn from prospectively randomized studies. Using a
significant number of patients we have calculated survival rates
for all patients with HCC regardless of therapy using different
criteria such as disease state and therapy options. These data will
form the basis for future randomised clinical trials evaluating new
therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC.
