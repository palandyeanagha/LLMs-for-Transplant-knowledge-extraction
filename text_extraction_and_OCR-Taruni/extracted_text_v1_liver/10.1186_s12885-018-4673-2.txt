Abstract
Background: The impact of sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who
receive transcatheter intra-arterial therapies, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and transcatheter
arterial infusion chemotherapy, remains unclear. We investigated the prognostic value of skeletal muscle loss (SML)
stratified by cutoffs for sarcopenia and rate of change in skeletal muscle mass over 6 months.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 102 patients with HCC treated with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies
between 2005 and 2015. Computed tomography images of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) were analyzed to obtain
the skeletal muscle area normalized for the height squared, defined as the skeletal muscle index at L3 (L3 SMI),
before and 6 months after treatment. Low or high SMI was defined using cutoff values of 42 cm2
/m2 in men and
38 cm2
/m2 in women. The rate of change in skeletal muscle mass (ΔL3 SMI) over 6 months was calculated. Overall
survival (OS) was compared in groups classified by baseline L3 SMI and ΔL3 SMI; prognostic significance was
assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses, using Cox proportional hazards models.
Results: OS did not differ significantly between groups with low (n = 31) and high (n = 71) SMI at baseline (P = 0.172),
but OS was significantly poorer in patients with SML (n = 41), defined as ΔL3 SMI < − 4.6% over 6 months than in those
without SML (n = 61, P = 0.018). On multivariate analysis, SML (hazard ratio [HR], 1.675; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.031–2.721; P = 0.037), serum alpha-fetoprotein ≥20 ng/mL (HR, 2.550; 95% CI, 1.440–4.515; P = 0.001), and maximum
tumor diameter ≥ 30 mm (HR, 1.925; 95% CI, 1.166–3.179; P = 0.010) were independent predictors of poor OS. Baseline
L3 SMI was not significantly associated with OS (HR, 1.405; 95% CI, 0.861–2.293; P = 0.174).
Conclusions: ΔL3 SMI was an independent prognostic factor in patients with HCC treated with transcatheter intraarterial therapies. Further study is required to reveal whether prevention of skeletal muscle depletion might be a new
therapeutic strategy to contribute to improved clinical outcomes in patients with HCC.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and a major cause of cancer
mortality [1]. Recent advances in therapeutic modalities,
including hepatic resection, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transplantation,
have substantially improved the prognosis of patients with
HCC [2–6]. Many patients with advanced HCC or severely impaired liver function, however, are beyond the indications for these radical treatments. Transcatheter
intra-arterial therapies, including transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE) and transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI), are widely used in advanced
HCC. Although these treatments are not curative and
yield a lower cumulative survival rate than surgical resection and local ablation therapies [7], the prognosis of patients receiving these interventions fluctuates according to
various factors, such as hepatic functional reserve; tumor
number, diameter, and distribution in the liver; and treatment efficacy [8–11].
Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome characterized by
progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass
and strength. The etiology of sarcopenia is multifactorial,
comprising primary causes associated with age and secondary causes related to reduced physical activity, diseases, and nutritional disorders [12, 13]. Several recent
studies have reported close associations between sarcopenia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with various types and stages of malignancies, including HCC
[14, 15]. Furthermore, loss of skeletal muscle mass has
been associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and
disease-free survival in patients with HCC treated with
surgical resection or RFA [16–20]. However, the impact
of sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with HCC
who receive transcatheter intra-arterial therapies has not
yet been assessed.
We hypothesized that sarcopenia may affect the clinical outcomes of patients with HCC who experience
gradual deterioration of hepatic function and nutritional
status during repeated rounds of transcatheter
intra-arterial therapy. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the prognostic significance of loss of skeletal
muscle mass in a group of these patients, stratified by
cutoff values for sarcopenia [21]. We also evaluated the
prognostic value of the rate of change in skeletal muscle
mass over 6 months in this group.
Methods
Patients
In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed patients
with HCC who underwent TACE and/or TAI as initial
treatment at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital between January 2005 and December 2015. HCC
was diagnosed principally based on its enhancement
pattern on dynamic computed tomography (CT) or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), exhibiting
contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by
rapid washout in the portal or equilibrium phase. Patients who had undergone a CT examination within
30 days prior to treatment and about 6 months (range,
90–270 days) after treatment were included in the study,
while patients who received treatment either initially or
additionally with curative methods, including surgical resection or RFA, were excluded.
This retrospective study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Niigata University School of Medicine
(approval number 2442) and was conducted in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Because of the
anonymous nature of the data, the requirement for additional informed consent to participate in the study was
waived.
Treatment procedure
TACE and/or TAI were performed according to the clinical practice guidelines for HCC of the Japan Society of
Hepatology [22]. Briefly, TACE or TAI is recommended
for patients with multiple tumors and Child–Pugh class
A or B hepatic impairment severity. The TAI procedure
consists of the injection of cisplatin (IA-call®; Nippon
Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), miriplatin (MIRIPLA®;
Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan),
or an emulsion of epirubicin (Farmorubicin®; Pfizer
Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) in lipiodol into hepatic arteries,
including tumor-nourishing arteries. TACE includes subsequent embolization of the feeding arteries with gelatin
sponge particles (Gelpart®; Nihonkayaku, Tokyo, Japan)
following the TAI procedure. TAI without embolization
was implemented when multiple tumors were extensively distributed bilaterally in the lobes of the liver, the
arterial anatomy precluded a super-selective injection, or
there were significant arteriovenous fistulas or tumor
thrombi in the main trunk of the portal vein.
Skeletal muscle mass measurement
Skeletal muscle areas were measured on axial sections at
the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) of pre- and
post-treatment CT images, using SliceOmatic software
(version 5.0; TomoVision Inc., Montreal, Canada). The
psoas, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, transversus
abdominis, external and internal oblique, and rectus abdominis muscles were delineated by density thresholds
ranging from − 29 to 150 Hounsfield units [23]. The
muscle area (cm2
) at the L3 level was normalized by the
square of height (m2
) to obtain the skeletal muscle index
at L3 (L3 SMI, cm2
/m2). Patients were classified into
low or high SMI groups based on cutoff values of
42 cm2
/m2 in men and 38 cm2/m2 in women, values

recommended in the guidelines for sarcopenia in liver disease described by the Japan Society of Hepatology [21].
The rate of change in skeletal muscle mass over
6 months was calculated using the following formula:
rate of change in skeletal muscle mass over 6 months
(ΔL3 SMI, %) = (L3 SMI on post-treatment CT − L3 SMI
on pre-treatment CT)/(L3 SMI on pre-treatment CT)/
(days between pre- and post-treatment CT examinations)
× 180 × 100. The cutoff value of ΔL3 SMI was determined
by optimal stratification of survival based on the most significant P value in log-rank statistics [24, 25].
Clinical data
Retrospectively collected demographic and clinical data
included age, sex, and body mass index (BMI); hepatitis
B virus (HBV) surface antigen; anti-hepatitis C virus
(HCV) antibody; serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, albumin, and
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); platelet count; Child–Pugh classification; TNM stage according to the Liver Cancer Study
Group of Japan [26]; maximum tumor diameter; number of
tumors; presence or absence of branched-chain amino acid
(BCAA) supplementation; number of sessions of transcatheter intra-arterial therapy between the pre- and
post-treatment CT examinations; transcatheter intra-arterial
treatment modality; treatment response evaluated according
to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [27]; and cause of death.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables expressed as median and range
were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests, and categorical variables expressed as number and percentage
were compared using Fisher’s exact tests or chi-squared
tests. Survival days were counted from the date of
pre-treatment CT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
to estimate survival rates, which were then compared
using log-rank tests. The prognostic significance of covariates was assessed with univariate and multivariate
analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model and
expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All variables significant in univariate analyses were entered into multivariate models. All
statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 21 Statistics software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). All tests were two-sided, and P values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

34–89 years), and 70 patients (68.6%) were men. The
median L3 SMI on pre-treatment CT in men and
women was 47.1 cm2
/m2 (range, 31.5–64.4 cm2/m2) and
36.5 cm2
/m2 (range, 25.6–55.6 cm2/m2), respectively.
Fifty-nine patients (57.8%) received a combination of
TACE and TAI. A total of 167 treatment sessions were
administered; among these, adverse events occurred in
nine sessions, including prolonged fever in six sessions
and liver function impairment in three sessions. No
treatment-related deaths occurred. Seventy-two patients
(70.6%) died during the study period, with liver-related
death (57 patients, 79.2%) the leading cause of mortality.
Association between baseline L3 SMI and survival
Thirty-one patients (30.4%; 14 men and 17 women) were
classified into the low SMI group at baseline, whereas 71
patients (69.6%; 56 men and 15 women) were classified
into the high SMI group (Table 2). Patient age (P =
0.001) and the proportion of women (P = 0.001) were
significantly higher in the low SMI group than in the
high SMI group. BMI was significantly higher in both
men (P < 0.001) and women (P = 0.009) with high SMI
than in those with low SMI. The most prevalent etiology
of HCC was HCV infection in the low SMI group, and
non-B non-C hepatitis in the high SMI group (P =
0.003). There were no significant differences in
Child-Pugh classification, TNM stage, or BCAA supplementation between the low and high SMI groups.
The OS rate tended to be higher in the high SMI
group than in the low SMI group (P = 0.172), as shown
in Fig. 1. Univariate analysis using a Cox proportional
hazards model revealed no significant association between baseline L3 SMI and OS rate (HR, 1.405; 95% CI,
0.861–2.293; P = 0.174).
Association between rate of change in skeletal muscle
mass and survival
The cutoff value for ΔL3 SMI was determined to be −
4.6% over 6 months, according to the optimization
method for classification [24, 25]. A sharp decrease in
skeletal muscle mass less than the cutoff value was defined as skeletal muscle loss (SML); other decreases were
defined as non-skeletal muscle loss (non-SML). Of the
102 study patients, 41 (40.2%; 30 men and 11 women)
were classified into the SML group, and 61 (59.8%; 40
men and 21 women) were classified into the non-SML
group (Table 3). Comparison of the demographic and
clinical characteristics of patients in the SML and
non-SML groups revealed that the observation period
was significantly shorter and the serum albumin level
significantly lower in the SML group than in the
non-SML group. The SML group was also characterized
by features of more advanced tumor progression, such
as higher serum AFP level and larger tumor size.
Univariate and multivariate analyses based on a Cox
proportional hazards model were performed to identify
independent predictors of survival (Table 4). Univariate
analysis showed that SML; serum level of total bilirubin
≥1.5 mg/dL, albumin < 3.5 g/dL, and AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL;
maximum tumor diameter ≥ 30 mm; and progressive
disease in response to treatment were significantly associated with poor OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that
SML (HR, 1.675; 95% CI, 1.031–2.721; P = 0.037), serum
AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL (HR, 2.550; 95% CI, 1.440–4.515; P =
0.001), and maximum tumor diameter ≥ 30 mm (HR,
1.925; 95% CI, 1.166–3.179; P = 0.010) were independently predictive of poor OS (Fig. 2).
Discussion
This retrospective study evaluated whether baseline skeletal muscle mass and its rate of change over 6 months
were prognostic factors for OS in patients with HCC
treated with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to show that the rate of
change in skeletal muscle mass over 6 months was an
independent indicator of clinical outcomes in these
patients.
Prognostic factors that have been previously identified
in patients with HCC treated with TACE or TAI include
hepatic functional reserve; tumor-specific factors, such
as number, diameter, vascular invasion, and distribution
in the liver; and serum AFP concentrations [8–11]. The
present study additionally revealed that the 6-month rate
of change in skeletal muscle mass was predictive of survival in these patients. In previous studies, an association
between change in skeletal muscle mass during chemotherapy and prognosis has been demonstrated in
patients with various malignancies other than HCC [28–
32]; these findings indicate that the same association
may be applied to predict outcomes in patients with
HCC undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment. Because
CT examinations are usually repeated at intervals
shorter than 6 months as part of the clinical workup for
patients with HCC, it is quite feasible to practically apply
our method of quantification of skeletal muscle mass.
Skeletal muscle mass has been reported to decline by
approximately 1.4% per year owing to physiological
aging [33]. In patients with cirrhosis, skeletal muscle is
lost more rapidly, declining by about 2.2% per year [34].
The present study found that patients with HCC treated
with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies showed drastic
decreases in skeletal muscle mass, with a median rate of
− 3.5% over 6 months. Furthermore, SML < − 4.6% over
6 months was significantly associated with poorer OS.
These findings suggest that a rapid loss of skeletal
muscle mass induced by deterioration of hepatic function is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients
with chronic liver disease.
Kobayashi et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:756 Page 4 of 9

In the current study, skeletal muscle mass at baseline
was not predictive of clinical outcomes, in contrast to
the findings of previous studies in which patients with
HCC were treated with modalities other than transcatheter intra-arterial therapies [14–20]. This discrepancy
may be the result of differences in hepatic functional reserve or tumor progression among the enrolled patients.
Guidelines for the treatment of HCC recommend radical
therapies in patients with preserved liver function and
limited tumor progression [22], who often have good nutritional status and preserved skeletal muscle mass. In
contrast, most patients who undergo transcatheter
intra-arterial therapies have more severely impaired liver
function, or tumors in more advanced stages. These adverse conditions may have a considerable impact on outcomes, irrespective of skeletal muscle mass at baseline.
Although we did not assess the mechanisms responsible for the rapid loss of skeletal muscle in the patients
with HCC in the present study, the phenomenon may be
associated with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM).
PEM is frequently observed in patients with liver disease, and facilitates catabolism and loss of skeletal
muscle mass [35–37]. In addition, patients with impaired
liver function are often deficient in vitamin D or carnitine, which might cause skeletal muscle atrophy [38, 39].

Most of the patients in our study had severely deteriorated liver function and HCC in advanced stages; these
detrimental conditions may have led to rapid depletion
of skeletal muscle.
Although prevention of SML has not been shown to
improve the prognosis of patients with HCC, dietary
supplementation with BCAAs in patients with cirrhosis
or HCC was found to preserve liver function and increase muscle protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling [40, 41]. Vitamin D
supplementation may also inhibit tumor progression
[42–44] and increase muscle mass and strength [45–47].
Furthermore, supplementation with L-carnitine may prevent skeletal muscle atrophy by activating the
insulin-like growth factor-1/AKT/p70S6 kinase pathway
[48]. Physical exercise also has beneficial effects on muscles through attenuation of signaling pathways associated with skeletal muscle proteolysis in cachectic
conditions and promotion of protein synthesis via
anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects [49, 50].
However, a recent study showed that exercise alone
could not prevent a reduction in skeletal muscle mass,
but that BCAA supplementation minimized skeletal
muscle depletion in patients with HCC [51]. It will be
necessary to investigate whether the conservation of
skeletal muscle with a combination of nutritional
support and exercise could improve the prognosis of patients with HCC, with the goal of developing a systematic strategy for the preservation of skeletal muscle in
these patients.
The present study had several limitations. First, the
study involved a relatively small number of patients who
were treated at a single institution. Second, our study
was retrospective in design, and we could not evaluate
skeletal muscle strength and function. The assessment of
not only skeletal muscle mass but also strength or function is needed to diagnose sarcopenia, according to
guidelines [21]. Prospective studies assessing skeletal
muscles comprehensively among larger numbers of patients with HCC are required to confirm our results.
Conclusions
In this study, we found that the rate of change in skeletal
muscle mass over 6 months was an independent

prognostic factor in patients with HCC treated with
transcatheter intra-arterial therapies. In contrast, SML at
baseline was not prognostic of clinical outcomes in these
patients. Further study is required to reveal whether prevention of skeletal muscle depletion might contribute to
improvement of clinical outcomes in patients with HCC,
as a new therapeutic strategy.
