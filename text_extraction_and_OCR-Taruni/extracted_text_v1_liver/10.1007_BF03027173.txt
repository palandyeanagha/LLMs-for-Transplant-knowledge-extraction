INTRODUCTION 
ALTHOUC~ SEVEnAL STUDIES have examined the hepatorenal iniury that may occur 
in man following exposure to anaesthetic drugs, most are tainted by the presence 
of other medications, the concomitant stress imposed by the operation or the prior 
existence of hepatic or renal disease. Other studies have failed to measure anaesthetic dose (alveolar or arterial concentrations) and the duration of anaesthetic 
exposure, although such measurements are necessary to quantitate the imposed 
time-dose stress. 
During our studies of the effects of various anaesthetics on cardiorespiratory 
function 1-7 we also evaluated the effects of these anaesthetics on subsequent hepatic 
and renal function. These measurements were made in healthy, young human 
volunteers and were uncomplicated by prior medication or concomitant operation. 
Anaesthesia was prolonged and at times profound. We present the results of the 
hepatic, renal and haematological studies in the following report. The findings 
suggest that small but significant differences exist among anaesthetics in their 
abilities to produce adverse effects. However, the changes seen were minimal, even 
with those agents which caused abnormalities. 
METHODS 
Many of the details of the methods used in this study have been described 
previously and only additions or deviations from prior protocols will be noted. 1-7 
Briefly, studies were made on healthy volunteers between 21 and 30 years of age. 
Blood and voided urine specimens were obtained immediately prior to anaesthesia. 
Anaesthesia was induced and maintained only with the agent under study which 
was isoflurane or halothane with or without nitrous oxide (70 per cent), fluroxene 
or diethyl ether (Table I). Anaesthetic concentrations as multiples of the minimal 
alveolar concentration (MAC) were altered according to the needs of the circulatory or respiratory studies. One group receiving isoflurane and oxygen was made 
hypercapnoeic (isoflurane-CO.,) and one was not. The group receiving halothane

DURATION OF ANAESTHESIA AND TIME-DOSE FACTORS OF 
ANAESTHETIC EXPOSURE FOR EACH GROUP. 
The time-dose factor was derived by multiplying the alveolar anaesthetic concentration by the 
duration (in hours) of exposure to that concentration and dividing by MAC. The time-dose 
segments for each volunteer were summed and from results for all volunteers in each group mean 
values 4- standard error were computed

in oxygen was also subiected to hypercapnia (halothane-carbon dioxide). In these 
two groups, hypercapnia resulted from maintenance of spontaneous respiration 
and from imposed increases in Pco~ to perform CO~ response tests. Subjects were 
hypercapnoeie throughout the study but the range of abnormality varied. At the 
deepest level of isoflurane anaesthesia, PaCO2 averaged 64.7 torr; during halothane 
it was 60.6 torr. The maximum PaCO., achieved during CO,, challenges was between 80 and 90 tort. A time-dose factor which combined two variables which may 
influence toxicity, duration and depth of anaesthesia, was derived for each anaesthetic group (Table I). This was obtained by multiplying the alveolar concentration by the duration of exposure to that concentration and then dividing by the 
MAC for each anaesthetic, s-N In these calculations we assumed that 70 per cent 
nitrous oxide equalled 0.45 per cent halothane and 0.75 per cent isoflurane. 1° An 
additional correction was made for the influence of age on MAC. TM Analysis of 
several such time-dose segments for each volunteer was necessary since one dose 
was not maintained for the entire duration of anaesthesia. All such segments for 
any one volunteer were added together. The mean values for all volunteers in each 
group were averaged to obtain the factors shown in Table I. 
The total volume of fuid administered intravenously during the period of study 
ranged from 2000-3000 ml and consisted of lactated Ringers" solution and 5 per 
cent dextrose in water to which 22 mEq sodium bicarbonate had been added. The 
volunteers were kept fasting until the morning after the study but during this 
recovery period they received an infusion of 5 per cent dextrose in water at a rate 
of 100 ml per hour. Blood and voided urine specimens were obtained the morning 
following anaesthesia and again seven days after anaesthesia in all volunteers. 
Blood samples were taken from some volunteers at other times as noted in the 
tables. 
Bromsulphthalein (BSP) was measured as per cent retention 45 minutes after 
injection of a 5 mg/kg dose. Serum glutamie oxaloacetie transaminase (SGOT), 
serum glutamie pyruvie transaminase (SGPT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 
alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum ereatinine, total serum 
protein, serum albumin, serum potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, and blear-

bonate content were measured as described by Smolelis and Hartsell. lz The 
rationale for lysozyme analysis was an increase in urinary lysozyme without a 
concomitant increase in plasma lysozymes would suggest cellular disruption 
in the genitourinary tract. Haematocrit determinations, leukocyte and differential 
cell counts and platelet counts were made. Not all analyses were performed in each 
anaesthetic group. In general, as these studies progressed, the evaluation became 
more comprehensive and included more analyses. 
Measurements of serum inorganic fuoride were made in four volunteers in the 
group anaesthetized with isoflurane-nitrous oxide. Samples were drawn prior to 
anaesthesia, at the end of anaesthesia and one, three, or seven days after anaesthesia. The samples were centrifuged, the serum was extracted, frozen and later 
analyzed with a fluoride electrode.* 
For intra-anaesthetic comparisons, t values were obtained by paired analyses. 
For inter-anaesthetic comparisons, t values were obtained by unpaired analyses. 
We accepted as significant any p value of less than 0.05. Mean values --+ one 
standard error are presented. 
I~ESULTS 
Hepatic Function (Table II) 
BSP increased significantly on the first post-anaesthesia day in the volunteers 
exposed to isoflurane-oxygen, halothane-earbon dioxide, halothane-nitrous oxide, 
and fluroxene, but not in the other groups. Increases in BSP retention were significantly greater in the halothane and fluroxene groups than in the isoflurane-oxygen 
group. I-Iypercapnia during isoflurane or halothane anaesthesia did not cause any 
greater increases in BSP than were observed at norrnocapnia when oxygen or 
nitrous oxide were administered with these agents. By the seventh day, only those 
volunteers who received halothane with carbon dioxide continued to have significantly high BSP values. Only fluroxene increased the mean SGOT value Significantly on the first post-anaesthesia day. This value was still greater than the 
preanaesthetie value on day seven. No significant changes were observed in SGPT, 
LDH, serum cholesterol or alkaline phosphatase values except for decreases in 
serum cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase in the group receiving isofluranenitrous oxide at one and three days post-anaesthesia. 
Renal Function (Table III) 
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) decreased significantly in all isoflurane groups and 
in the halothane-carbon dioxide and ether groups and had returned to control 
values by seven days in all but the isoflurane-carbon dioxide and isoflurane-nitrous 
oxide groups. Creatinine did not change significantly in any of the groups. Uric 
acid decreased significantly one day after isoflurane-carbon dioxide and isofluranenitrous oxide and increased significantly one day after halothane with carbon 
dioxide. Uric acid values were significantly higher the seventh day than the first 
day after isoflurane-oxygen. There were no significant changes in urine or plasma 
lysozyme levels nor were there significant differences among the groups. The urine 
pH tended to increase slightly and specific gravity to decrease on the first day

following exposure to isoflurane or halothane. These variables had returned toward 
control values by the seventh day after anaesthesia. Tests for occult blood, acetone, 
glucose, protein, bilirubin and microscopic examinations of the urine did not reveal 
significant abnormalities. No data from urinalyses were obtained for the fluroxene 
and diethyl ether groups. 
Blood electrolytes, protein, glucose (Table IV) 
Serum sodium and chloride values were unchanged throughout the period of 
observation for all anaesthetics. Potassium values increased significantly one hour 
after induction with isoflurane-nitrous oxide, the only group in which the measurement was made at that time. This may relate to the release of glucose (see below). 
Potassium values had increased on the seventh day after all anaesthetics. Bicarbonate content tended to increase on the first day after anaesthesia had increased 
further at seven days except in the group anaesthetized with halothane-nitrous 
oxide. Changes in both calcium and phosphorus values were small. Both decreased 
slightly at one day and had returned toward (phosphorus) or above (calcium) 
control values by seven days. Total serum protein and albumin values decreased 
significantly for all anaesthetics at one day. These changes probably refect effects 
of blood removal (200-400 ml) and its replacement with electrolyte solution. All 
values returned to or above normal by seven days. One hour after induction, at a 
time when glucose had not yet been administered intravenously, blood glucose 
values had increased significantly with all isoflurane groups and with halothanecarbon dioxide. However, the increases were significantly greater in the isofluranecarbon dioxide and isoflurane-nitrous oxide groups than in the halothane-carbon 
dioxide and halothane-nitrous oxide groups, respectively. The glucose was elevated 
one day after anaesthesia but this increase was clouded by the concomitant infusion 
of glucose. 
Blood Elements (Table V) 
Haematocrit values decreased in all groups at one day, probably again due to 
the 200 to 400 ml blood loss and replacement with electrolyte solution. By the 
seventh post-anaesthesia day the haematocrit values had returned toward control 
in all groups. Total leukocyte count increased in all groups at one day and had 
returned toward or below control values by the seventh day. Increases were 
greatest in the halothane-nitrous oxide and fluroxene groups on day one, due 
largely to increases in polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. Per cent increase of 
PMN was greater one day after halothane-carbon dioxide than after isoflurane but 
increases in absolute PMN were not different between these groups. There was no 
evidence of eosinophilia in any group. 
Serum fluoride values showed a small increase at some period following isoflurane anaesthesia in three of four volunteers (Table VI). Values returned to 
control levels by day three in one volunteer and day seven in the other. 
DISCUSSION 
The most striking conclusion from these studies is the relative innocuousness of 
halothane, fluroxene and diethyl ether as well as the new agent, isoflurane. Despite

prolonged anaesthesia, sometimes at profound levels, despite occasional hypotension and despite supra-imposition of hypercapnia there was little evidence of 
significant impairment of hepato-renal function. The greatest deviation from 
normal had been reversed by day seven in all groups except the group exposed to 
halothane-carbon dioxide in whom the average BSP retention, though much lower 
than on day one, was still slightly above normal. 
Although no serious deviations from normal hepatic function occurred either in 
individuals or in groups, the small differences between groups in BSP retention are 
noteworthy. Isoflurane anaesthesia was followed by the smallest increases in BSP 
retention. Several workers have suggested a possible causal relationship between 

STEVENS, et al.: COMPARATIVE TOXICITY OF ANAESTHETICS 365 
metabolism of anaesthetics and hepatic injury24-1.~ Halothane TM and fluroxene 2°,'-,1 
are both known to be metabolized whereas isoflurane metabolism is minimal or 
perhaps nonexistent."" Whether this explains the lower BSP retention following 
isoflurane remains unknown. Perhaps the explanation lies in the slightly smaller 
dose-time factor for the isoflurane groups (Table I). In any case, it appears that 
isoflurane is no more hepatotoxic in man than established agents. 
Others have suggested that hypercapnia or hypotension enhance the abnormalities in hepatic function associated with halothane. ''3 Our results do not support 
such a conclusion. Neither the isoflurane-carbon dioxide nor halothane-carbon 
dioxide groups differed from the isoflurane or halothane groups not subjected to 
hypercapnia. Further, the isoflurane-oxygcn groups had lower arterial pressures 
than the isoflurane-nitrous oxide group, yet failed to show differences in hepatic 
effects. 
The measures of renal function, with the possible exception of urine lysozymes, 
are not thought to be sensitive tests of renal injury. Would more sensitive tests 
have revealed differences between the agents studied? To this we have no answer. 
However, from review of other studies we believe that the tests we used would 
have demonstrated the nephrotoxicity of an agent such as methoxyflurane. Serum 
electrolytes, uric acid, and BUN all showed abnormalities in Mazze's ~4 studies after 
methoxyflurane anaesthesia. Despite a greater dose-time stress, these values were 
normal in our subjects except for a small increase in uric acid one day after 
halothane-carbon dioxide. 
It may be argued that our approach to the study of the hepatic or renal toxicity 
of anaesthetics has failed in that no hepatic or renal toxicity was revealed. This 
argument is especially pertinent in view of the accepted hepatotoxicity of halothane. 25 In part, we would answer that slight hepatotoxicity of halothane was 
demonstrated. In part the answer may lie in the mechanism by which halothane 
hepatotoxicity is produced. The rarity of this untoward event has suggested that 
certain individuals are peculiarly "sensitive" to halothane either by virtue of an 
allergic aberrancy '-''~ or a greater ability to metabolize halothane ~ and/or a decreased ability to withstand the noxious effects of its metabolites. The rarity of 
halothane hepatotoxicity suggests that more sensitive tests are unlikely to reveal 
this hepatotoxicity in a small group of healthy human volunteers. How to find the 
peculiarly sensitive individual either to protect him if he requires anaesthesia or 
to use him in a study of hepatotoxic effects is unclear. Such a person may be 
identified by a particular genotype; or the event may result from a prior drug 
exposure with consequent induction of enzymes which metabolize halothane. '-'6,'-'r 
Perhaps the primary usefulness of this report relates to the search for a better 
anaesthetic. ''s Acceptance of such an agent requires that its renal or hepatic toxicity 
be no greater than that produced by currently available anaesthetics. The values 
presented in this report may be used as standards against which any new agent can 
be compared. 
SU~MARY 
Comparisons of toxic effects of isoflurane, halothane, fluroxene and diethyl ether 
were made in human volunteers not undergoing surgical procedures. Comparisons 

366 CANADIAN ANAESTHETISTS' SOCIETY JOURNAL 
were made of effects on bromsulpthalein retention, serum glutamie oxaloaeetic 
and pyruvic transaminases, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, serum 
cholesterol, total serum protein and albumin, serum sodium, chloride, potassium, 
carbon dioxide content, urie aeid, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, ereatinine, 
fluoride, blood urea nitrogen, urine and plasma lysozymes, haematocrit, white 
blood eells, polymorphonuelear leukoeytes and urinalysis. 
We found greater increases in BSP after halothane and fluroxene than after 
isoflurane. Concomitant hypercapnia or hypotension did not influence the results. 
Serum glutamie oxaloaeetic transaminase increased only after fluroxene. We found 
elevated polymorphonuclear leukocytes after all anaesthetics. 
No serious toxicity occurred after any of the anaesthetics.
