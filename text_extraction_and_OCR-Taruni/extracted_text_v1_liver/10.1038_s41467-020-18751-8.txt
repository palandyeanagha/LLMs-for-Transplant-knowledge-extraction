Antagonism or agonism of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor
(GIPR) prevents weight gain and leads to dramatic weight loss in combination with glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists in preclinical models. Based on the genetic evidence supporting GIPR antagonism, we previously developed a mouse anti-murine GIPR antibody
(muGIPR-Ab) that protected diet-induced obese (DIO) mice against body weight gain and
improved multiple metabolic parameters. This work reconciles the similar preclinical body
weight effects of GIPR antagonists and agonists in vivo, and here we show that chronic GIPR
agonism desensitizes GIPR activity in primary adipocytes, both differentiated in vitro and
adipose tissue in vivo, and functions like a GIPR antagonist. Additionally, GIPR activity in
adipocytes is partially responsible for muGIPR-Ab to prevent weight gain in DIO mice,
demonstrating a role of adipocyte GIPR in the regulation of adiposity in vivo.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are gut-derived incretin
hormones, known to stimulate insulin secretion for glycemic control, and in the case of GLP-1, also recognized to
promote satiety, which has led to the development of a GLP-1
receptor (GLP-1R) agonist (GLP-1RA) as an obesity therapy1.
More recently, therapies targeting the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) have shown efficacy
preclinically in preventing weight gain2–5.
The GIPR locus has been identified in genome-wide association
studies to be associated with obesity and body-mass index (BMI)6
highlighting its importance as a regulator of adiposity in humans.
Alleles have been identified that both increase7 and, more
importantly, decrease BMI8, presenting support for potential
GIPR-directed therapies as weight loss agents. Furthermore, in
some studies, the lower BMI alleles have been associated with
either reduced expression6, signaling9,10, or incretin
function2,11,12. In alignment with the human genetic evidence,
mouse gene deletion studies of GIP, GIPR, or ablation of GIPsecreting K cells all demonstrate protection from diet-induced
obesity (DIO)13–16.
Based on the human and mouse genetic evidence supporting
GIPR antagonism6, we previously developed anti-GIPR antagonistic antibodies as a potential therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of obesity. A mouse anti-murine anti-GIPR antibody
(muGIPR-Ab) protected DIO mice against body weight gain,
improved multiple metabolic parameters, and was associated with
reduced food intake and resting respiratory exchange ratio2.
Interestingly, preclinical studies utilizing GIPR agonists3–5 display a similar response to muGIPR-Ab both alone and in combination with GLP-1RAs2. Moreover, the dual GIP/GLP-1 analog
tirzepatide has demonstrated enhanced weight loss both preclinically and clinically beyond GLP-RAs alone3,17, intensifying
the scientific debate surrounding the use of GIPR agonists or
antagonists for the treatment of obesity6.
The purpose of this work is to reconcile the similar preclinical
body weight effects of GIPR antagonists and agonists in vivo, and
here we show that a long-acting-(LA)-GIPR agonist (LA-Agonist)
desensitizes GIPR activity in primary adipocytes, both differentiated in vitro and adipose tissue in vivo, and functions like a
GIPR antagonist. Additionally, we establish that GIPR activity in
adipocytes is partially responsible for the ability of muGIPR-Ab
to prevent weight gain in DIO mice, demonstrating a role of
adipocyte GIPR in the regulation of adiposity in vivo.
Results
LA-Agonist has the same effect on body weight as muGIPR-Ab.
To compare the effect of a GIPR agonist head-to-head with the
GIPR antagonist muGIPR-Ab alone and in combination with
GLP-1RA liraglutide, we developed a tool molecule with high
potency and improved pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters that
combines a modified GIP peptide with an antibody against a
non-mammalian target to ensure maximal activation of the
GIPR. First, we tested our long-acting-(LA)-GIPR Agonist (LAAgonist) in vitro and determined its activity in cells overexpressing mouse GIPR compared to GIP (Fig. 1a) and determined its selectivity for GIPR over GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)
and glucagon receptor (Supplemental Fig. 1a–c). Using a pharmacodynamic (PD) assay with a GIP analog [D-Ala2]-GIP (DAGIP) as a control, DIO mice were injected intraperitoneal (IP)
with glucose and saline, glucose and DA-GIP, or glucose and the
LA-Agonist in a dose response to determine the PD effect. The
LA-Agonist was more potent at lowering blood glucose (Fig. 1b)
and increasing insulin secretion (Fig. 1c) at 50 and 150 nmol/kg
compared to DA-GIP (50 nmol/kg). We then established an
exposure-PD response relationship for blood concentration of
the LA-Agonist vs. the area under the curve for both glucose and
insulin (Fig. 1d, e). The LA-Agonist half maximal inhibitory and
effective concentration (IC50 and EC50) was 328 nM for glucose
and 212 nM for insulin, respectively. Utilizing a single-dose PK
study, the terminal half-life and bioavailability for the intact LAAgonist following IP injection were determined to be 71.3 h and
≈100%, respectively (Fig. 1f and Supplemental Table 1). In
conjunction with the PK-PD response, a 2-compartment PK
model was used to simulate exposure in a multiple dose efficacy
study. The dose and dosing frequency were evaluated to provide
target coverage greater than the IC50 for glucose response (328
nM). To ensure that we conservatively maintained maximal
efficacy, we selected a daily dose of the LA-Agonist ten times
higher than a dose needed to cover the IC50 of 328 nM (37.5 mg/
kg/day) at trough concentrations to compare against muGIPRAb. We previously reported that the muGIPR-Ab dose-dependently inhibited GIP-stimulated cAMP in vitro in the same assay
reported here in Fig. 1a with IC50 = 89.6 nM, and in vivo, the
maximum effect in the acute PD assay was achieved with
muGIPR-Ab (25 mg/kg), which correlated with a mean serum
concentration of 2250 nM, and allowed us to determine that
muGIPR-Ab dosed 25 mg/kg every six days was sufficient to
provide maximal target coverage2. Since 37.5 mg/kg of the LAAgonist (equivalent to 239.5 nmol/kg LA-Agonist) is a suprapharmacological dose, we confirmed that both DA-GIP and the
peptide portion of the LA-Agonist both at 250 nmol/kg robustly
stimulated insulin secretion in DIO mice, which was absent in
DIO mice with pancreatic Gipr β-cell knockout (GiprβCell−/−;
mice previously described2) (Supplemental Fig. 1d, e), confirming that high concentrations of GIPR agonists in vivo do not
activate GLP-1R mediated insulin secretion.
During chronic treatment in DIO mice fed 60% kcal from fat
diet for 12 weeks, the LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab both
demonstrated protection against body weight gain, while the
combination of LA-Agonist and the GLP-1RA liraglutide and the
combination of muGIPR-Ab and liraglutide groups both equally
lost a greater amount of weight than the combined effect of either
monotherapy alone (Fig. 2a). By measuring food intake over time,
all treatment groups, except muGIPR-Ab alone, showed a
significant reduction in food intake during treatment days 1–3
compared to vehicle (Fig. 2b). During treatment days 7–9, only
groups receiving liraglutide alone or in combination showed
reduced food intake, which returned to the same level as vehicle
by the end of the study. Notably, during days 13–15, food intake
for both the LA-Agonist in combination with liraglutide and
muGIPR-Ab in combination with liraglutide groups was still
decreased whereas it was not different in any of the monotherapy
groups.
On day 18, only mice that received liraglutide alone or in
combination had reduced fat mass, and LA-Agonist treated mice
did not differ from muGIPR-Ab treated mice alone or in
combination with liraglutide (Fig. 2c). At the end of the study,
both the LA-Agonist in combination with liraglutide and
the muGIPR-Ab in combination with liraglutide groups had
reduced subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) weights (Fig. 2d). All
treatment groups, except the LA-Agonist alone, had reduced
epididymal WAT (eWAT) weights at necropsy, and the LAAgonist did not differ from muGIPR-Ab alone or in combination
with liraglutide (Fig. 2e). Only mice treated with liraglutide alone
or in combination had reduced liver weights (Fig. 2f). Reflective
of reduced fat mass, all treatment groups had reduced plasma
leptin and resistin (Fig. 2g, h). Minimal differences from vehicle
were observed in plasma adiponectin and only mice treated with
muGIPR-Ab in combination with liraglutide had increased
adiponectin (Fig. 2i).

To determine the effect of GIPR agonism or antagonism on
GIPR incretin activity after 21 days, we conducted a PD assay by
injecting glucose and DA-GIP into all mice, and, as expected, the
muGIPR-Ab treated mice did not have increased insulin
concentrations after DA-GIP stimulation whereas the LAAgonist treated mice increased insulin concentrations to a similar
extent as vehicle-treated animals, indicating intact incretin
activity in LA-Agonist treated animals (Fig. 2j). All other
treatment groups had significantly reduced DA-GIP-stimulated
insulin concentrations (Fig. 2j). The LA-Agonist alone and both
combination groups had significantly reduced blood glucose after
80 min post-dose (Fig. 2k).
LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab have similar plasma metabolomics. To determine the metabolic alterations of GIPR agonism
compared to antagonism independent of body weight differences,
i.e., the LA-Agonist alone and muGIPR-Ab alone both had a
modest effect preventing body weight gain while the combination
with liraglutide yielded dramatic body weight loss, we utilized
untargeted metabolomics analysis of plasma samples from mice
chronically treated with vehicle, LA-Agonist, or muGIPR-Ab
collected 80 min after the glucose + DA-GIP challenge (shown in
Fig. 2). All plasma metabolomics data is available in Supplemental
Data 1. Compared to vehicle, plasma from mice treated with
muGIPR-Ab had n = 254 metabolites out of 671 detected metabolites significantly different from vehicle (p ≤ 0.05 and q ≤ 0.2;
Fig. 3a) and plasma from mice treated with LA-Agonist had n =
257 different metabolites out of 671 detected metabolites significantly different from vehicle (p ≤ 0.05 and q ≤ 0.2; Fig. 3b).
Notably, there were not any significantly different metabolites
detected between muGIPR-Ab compared to LA-Agonist treated
mice (p ≤ 0.05 and q ≤ 0.2; Fig. 3c). High level views of the
metabolome revealed that the plasma metabolic profiles from the
LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab treated mice were similar utilizing
principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 3d). Plasma samples
from mice treated with LA-Agonist or muGIPR-Ab clustered
similarly on the PCA plot and were distinct from plasma samples
from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3d), indicating limited differences
between GIPR agonism and antagonism signaling in vivo. Using
pathway enrichment analysis, the pathways found to be enriched
in muGIPR-Ab compared to vehicle were also found to be
enriched in LA-Agonist compared to vehicle with the highest
enrichment for both treatments including amino sugar metabolism; fatty acid metabolism (acyl choline); and fructose, mannose,
and galactose metabolism (Fig. 3e).
Since the plasma metabolomes were similar between muGIPRAb and LA-Agonist treated mice, we compared metabolites with
known relationships to GIPR activity, notably cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP)2, corticosterone18, and glycerol19. All
three of these metabolites have been shown to be increased by
GIP stimulation2,18,19 and therefore were expected to be increased
in LA-Agonist treated mice and decreased in muGIPR-Ab-treated
mice. However, all three of these metabolites were reduced after
DA-GIP stimulation in both LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab
treated mice compared to vehicle (Fig. 3f–h).
To confirm these reported relationships from the literature, we
stimulated naïve DIO mice with DA-GIP after an overnight fast,
and measured plasma corticosterone (Fig. 3i) and glycerol (Fig. 3j)
concentrations. We observed a dose-dependent increase in
corticosterone secretion and determined DA-GIP EC90 = 80
nmol/kg. To confirm the GIPR-specific response of these
metabolites, we pre-treated naïve DIO mice with muGIPR-Ab
or vehicle and repeated the assay using 80 nmol/kg DA-GIP.
Treatment with muGIPR-Ab significantly inhibited both DAGIP-stimulated corticosterone secretion (Fig. 3k) and glycerol
secretion (Fig. 3l), confirming that acute GIPR stimulation should
increase both metabolites in vivo and muGIPR-Ab antagonizes
this effect.
To confirm the effect of GIP to stimulate cAMP production,
we determined a GIP dose-dependent response in mouse primary
adipocytes differentiated in vitro for cAMP concentrations

(EC50 = 3.8 nM), and muGIPR-Ab dose-dependently inhibited
this effect at submaximal concentrations of GIP (Fig. 3m, n). In
adipocytes, high concentrations of cAMP leads to lipolysis of
stored triglyceride released as glycerol into the bloodstream20. We
then determined a GIP dose-dependent response on adipocyte
glycerol release from primary mouse adipocytes differentiated
in vitro (EC50 = 13 nM), and muGIPR-Ab dose-dependently
inhibited this effect at submaximal concentrations of GIP (Fig. 3o,
p). Overall, previous reports2,19 and our in vivo (Fig. 3h, j, l) and
in vitro (Fig. 3o, p) data demonstrate that GIP stimulates GIPRdependent increases in cAMP and lipolysis, and the chronic
treatment of muGIPR-Ab in vivo antagonizes this effect. Of note,
chronic treatment with the LA-Agonist did not increase in vivo
cAMP, corticosterone, or glycerol as might be expected as seen
with acute treatment with DA-GIP, but in fact reduced plasma
concentrations. Taken together, reductions in metabolites known
to be increased by GIP stimulation, including cAMP (Fig. 3f),
corticosterone (Fig. 3g), and glycerol (Fig. 3h), suggests functional
GIPR activity inhibition in adrenal glands and adipocytes
following chronic LA-Agonist treatment, reflecting similar levels
of metabolites seen in muGIPR-Ab treated mice. It is important
to note that there is no evidence in the literature that plasma
cAMP reflects the action of a single Gs coupled G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs), but the plasma cAMP data in Fig. 3f
is unequivocally lower then controls and is similar for chronic
GIPR agonism and antagonism.
GIP stimulates adipocyte fatty acid uptake. While GIP is known
to stimulate lipolysis in the absence of insulin19, physiological
GIP concentrations likely do not act to promote lipolysis in vivo
since the presence of high GIP will also stimulate insulin secretion, and insulin is a potent inhibitor of GIP-stimulated lipolysis21. Similar to insulin, GIP has also been reported to stimulate
fatty acid (FA) uptake and re-esterification in rat adipose
tissue22,23 and in mouse primary adipocytes ex vivo19,24. Therefore, we confirmed that GIP acutely stimulated FA uptake into
primary mouse adipocytes differentiated in vitro (Fig. 4a) and
muGIPR-Ab inhibited this effect in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4b). We translated this effect in vivo by establishing a FA
uptake assay in metabolic tissues of DIO mice using 14C-oleic
acid in olive oil. Overnight treatment of muGIPR-Ab significantly
inhibited DA-GIP’s incretin effect (Fig. 4c). DA-GIP significantly

promoted FA uptake into scWAT (Fig. 4d) without an effect in
eWAT (Fig. 4e), and this effect was blocked by muGIPR-Ab.
Interestingly, mice treated with muGIPR-Ab had increased FA
uptake into the liver compared to DA-GIP treatment alone
(Fig. 4f). No alterations in FA uptake in skeletal muscle, brown
adipose tissue, or heart were observed (Fig. 4g–i).
Since DA-GIP treatment in combination with olive oil by oral
gavage leads to insulin secretion, the FA uptake observed in
Fig. 4d could be a result of elevated insulin concentrations.
Therefore, we utilized Gipr β-cell knockout mice (GiprβCell−/−)
that do not secrete insulin in response to GIP stimulation in order
to tease out the effect of GIP-stimulated FA uptake independently
of DA-GIP-stimulated insulin secretion. In Gipr floxed control
mice (Giprfl/fl), GIP significantly stimulated insulin secretion, and
this effect was absent in muGIPR-Ab treated Giprfl/fl mice and
GiprβCell−/− mice with either treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2a, b).
Importantly, DA-GIP-stimulated FA uptake into scWAT was
reduced by muGIPR-Ab in both Giprfl/fl and GiprβCell−/− mice
compared to Giprfl/fl mice treated with DA-GIP only (Supplemental Fig. 2c), indicating that muGIPR-Ab inhibits GIPstimulated FA uptake into scWAT independent of insulin
secretion. Again, no effect was seen in eWAT or skeletal muscle
(Supplemental Fig. 2d, e), but GiprβCell−/− mice had significantly
reduced liver FA uptake compared to Giprfl/fl mice (Supplemental
Fig. 2f), indicating that hepatic FA uptake may depend on the
DA-GIP’s incretin effect.
To assess how chronic muGIPR-Ab treatment affects systemic
FA uptake, both lean and DIO mice were treated for 7 weeks.
While lean mice did not have a treatment effect on body weight
or tissue weights (Supplemental Fig. 2g–j), DIO mice treated with
muGIPR-Ab had reductions in body weight (Supplemental
Fig. 2g), scWAT weight (Supplemental Fig. 2h), and liver weight
(Supplemental Fig. 2j), but not eWAT weight (Supplemental
Fig. 2i) compared to vehicle-treated DIO mice. Consistent with
the acute single-dose study (Fig. 4c, d), chronic muGIPR-Ab
treatment inhibited FA uptake into scWAT (Supplemental
Fig. 2k) without an effect on eWAT or skeletal muscle
(Supplemental Fig. 2l, m). Again, consistent with the acute
single-dose study (Fig. 4f), muGIPR-Ab-treated DIO mice had
increased liver FA uptake compared to vehicle DIO mice
(Supplemental Fig. 2n), this effect was reduced in DIO mice
compared to lean mice, and notably, in the context of smaller
livers, suggestive that the increased FA uptake does not lead to
increased liver weight.
Adipocyte GIPR partially contributes to muGIPR-Ab’s effects.
Based on the direct actions of GIP on adipocytes and in scWAT
specifically, we generated Gipr adipocyte knockout mice
(GiprAdipo−/−) by crossing mice with a floxed Gipr gene (Giprfl/fl;
mice previously described2) with mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by the adiponectin promoter (described in Methods

section and Supplemental Fig. 3a–f). After high-fat diet (HFD)
feeding, GiprAdipo−/− mice had a significant reduction of Gipr
RNA expression in primary adipocytes isolated ex vivo (Fig. 5a)
and in primary pre-adipocytes differentiated in vitro (Fig. 5b)
without an alteration in adipocyte Adipoq expression (Fig. 5c) or
Gipr expression in other Gipr expressing tissues (Fig. 5d). GIPR
activity was ablated in response to GIP-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 5e) and GIP-stimulated FA uptake (Fig. 5f) in primary adipocytes differentiated in vitro. During HFD feeding,
GiprAdipo−/− mice did not have differences in body weight
(Fig. 5g), food intake (Fig. 5h), or lean mass (Fig. 5i) compared to
their Giprfl/fl littermates. However, GiprAdipo−/− mice do have
20% less fat mass after 12 weeks HFD feeding (Fig. 5j) as reflected
in significantly reduced scWAT (Fig. 5k). GiprAdipo−/− mice also
had 45% lower GIP-stimulated scWAT FA uptake (Fig. 5l),
indicating impaired adipocyte GIPR activity in vivo.
To understand the contribution of GIPR in adipocytes to the
effect of muGIPR-Ab to prevent weight gain in DIO mice, Giprfl/fl
and GiprAdipo−/− male littermates fed HFD for 12 weeks
(described in Fig. 5g–j) were treated with vehicle or muGIPRAb for 48 days. As expected, vehicle-treated Giprfl/fl mice gained
5% of their starting body weight over time and muGIPR-Ab
treated mice had significantly reduced weight gain with a 2%
reduction in their starting body weight over time, which
significantly differed from vehicle from day 10 throughout the
rest of the study (Fig. 6a). In GiprAdipo−/− mice, vehicle-treated
mice gained 4.8% of their starting body weight, similar to Giprfl/fl
mice, but muGIPR-Ab treated GiprAdipo−/− mice only had a
reduction of 0.5% of their starting body weight, which never
significantly differed from the vehicle-treated GiprAdipo−/− mice
over time up to day 48 (Fig. 6b). Utilizing two-way repeated
measures ANOVA, there is a significant treatment × genotype
interaction where p ≤ 0.0001 for data represented in Fig. 6a, b.
To confirm the difference in the response of male Giprfl/fl and
GiprAdipo−/− DIO littermates treated with muGIPR-Ab, we
repeated treatment in a different model of DIO utilizing female
Giprfl/fl and GiprAdipo−/− littermates fed HFD for 8 weeks then
treated with muGIPR-Ab for 67 days. Vehicle-treated female
Giprfl/fl mice gained 26.9% of their starting body weight while
female Giprfl/fl mice treated with muGIPR-Ab only gained 8.1%

of their starting body weight, a difference that showed
significance from days 49 throughout 67 days (Fig. 6c).
Vehicle-treated female GiprAdipo−/− mice gained 24.6% of their
starting body weight, similar to female Giprfl/fl littermates, but
female GiprAdipo−/− mice treated with muGIPR-Ab gained 13.8%
of their starting body weight, a difference that never significantly
differed from vehicle-treated GiprAdipo−/− mice throughout the
67 days (Fig. 6d). Utilizing two-way repeated measures ANOVA,
there is a significant treatment × genotype interaction where p ≤
0.0001 for data represented in Fig. 6c, d. Taken together in two
different models of DIO, this study demonstrates that mice with
adipocyte knockout of Gipr did not fully respond to the muGIPRAb, indicating a partial role for adipocyte GIPR for the effect of
muGIPR-Ab, but still leaves other tissues or cell types to also
partially contribute to the effect of muGIPR-Ab to prevent
weight gain.
Since there was increased liver FA uptake observed in wild-type
DIO mice pre-treated with muGIPR-Ab (Fig. 4f and Supplemental Fig. 2n), we utilized liver collected from the male Giprfl/fl
and GiprAdipo−/− DIO littermates treated with vehicle or
muGIPR-Ab for 48 days (Fig. 6a, b) where Giprfl/fl mice treated
with muGIPR-Ab had significantly reduced liver weight but
GiprAdipo−/− mice did not have differences in liver weight
(Fig. 6e). Since chronic treatment of muGIPR-Ab leads to
reduced liver weight (Supplemental Fig. 2j and Fig. 6e), but
increased liver FA uptake (Supplemental Fig. 3n), we explored
genes related to both hepatic FA oxidation and hepatic
lipogenesis. Interestingly, livers from Giprfl/fl mice treated with
muGIPR-Ab had a modest, but significant increase in many genes
associated with hepatic FA oxidation, including Ppara, Acaa2,
Acadm, and Cpt2 (Fig. 6f), without alteration in genes associated
with hepatic lipogenesis (Fig. 6g), suggesting that in mice
chronically treated with muGIPR-Ab, the reduced liver weight
is associated with increased FA uptake and increased hepatic FA
oxidation and is dependent on adipocyte GIPR activity.
Chronic GIPR agonism desensitizes adipocyte GIPR activity.
Based on data previously demonstrating ligand-mediated GIPR
desensitization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in vitro10,25,
we hypothesized that chronic GIPR agonism desensitizes GIPR
activity in adipocytes. Primary mouse adipocytes differentiated
in vitro were treated with or without DA-GIP (1 μM) for 24 h,
then stimulated with either mouse GIP or isoproterenol. Adipocytes incubated without DA-GIP demonstrated a significant GIP
dose-dependent increase in cAMP concentration while adipocytes
pre-incubated with DA-GIP had significantly reduced cAMP
concentrations after subsequent GIP stimulation (Fig. 7a). Both
pre-treatment with and without DA-GIP displayed similar maximal cAMP accumulation after isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 7a),
indicating intact response to other cAMP stimuli. Next, we
determined how long GIP-mediated GIPR desensitization persisted. Primary mouse adipocytes differentiated in vitro were
treated with or without DA-GIP (1 μM) for 24 h, then stimulated
with mouse GIP after different lengths of washout time. There
was a time-dependent increase in cAMP production in adipocytes
pre-treated with DA-GIP; however, these adipocytes did not fully
regain their sensitivity to subsequent GIP stimulation even after a
48-h washout period (Fig. 7b). To further understand the time
course of desensitization, primary mouse adipocytes were incubated with or without DA-GIP (1 μM) in a time course, then
stimulated with mouse GIP, and even after 1 h of DA-GIP
incubation, maximal responsiveness to GIP was blunted, but
longer incubation further reduced the responsiveness with maximal inhibition observed at 24 h (Fig. 7c). To determine the dose

response of desensitization, primary mouse adipocytes were
incubated with different concentrations of DA-GIP for 24 h, then
stimulated with mouse GIP, and even 10 nM DA-GIP incubation
blunted subsequent 100 nM mouse GIP stimulation with maximal inhibition observed at 100 nM and 1 μM DA-GIP pretreatment (Fig. 7d).

or without DA-GIP (1 μM) for 24 h, then stimulated with mouse
GIP or insulin and FA uptake rates were measured (Fig. 7e).
Adipocytes pre-treated with or without DA-GIP then stimulated
with insulin both had similar rates of FA uptake, whereas
adipocytes pre-treated with DA-GIP did not respond to
subsequent GIP stimulation seen in adipocytes without DA-GIP
pre-treatment (Fig. 7e). When compared to the same study design
utilizing muGIPR-Ab (Fig. 4b), chronic GIPR agonism functionally mimics GIPR antagonism in primary mouse adipocytes
differentiated in vitro.
To confirm that GIP-induced receptor desensitization is not a
mouse-specific phenomenon, we replicated the same experimental design in Fig. 7a in primary human adipocytes differentiated
in vitro. Human adipocytes incubated without DA-GIP demonstrated a significant GIP dose-dependent increase in cAMP
concentration while human adipocytes pre-incubated with DAGIP (1 µM) had significantly reduced cAMP concentrations both
with and without GIP stimulation and both conditions displayed
similar maximal cAMP accumulation after isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 7f).
To understand GIPR desensitization in other cell types, we
utilized mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma and rat INS1 832/13 islet
cell lines. Mouse Neuro-2a cells had similar cAMP sensitivity as
primary mouse adipocytes (Fig. 3m) to GIP (EC50 = 6.35 nM),
and also similar to primary adipocytes, pre-treatment with GIP
(1 µM) completely inhibited subsequent GIP stimulation (Fig. 7g).
However, rat INS1 832/13 cell lines had a greater sensitivity to
GIP (EC50 = 0.99 nM) than both primary mouse adipocytes and
Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, and notably, pre-treatment with
GIP (1 µM) for 24 h resulted in dramatically elevated basal cAMP
levels that did not further respond to the subsequent GIP
stimulation (Fig. 7h).
To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ligandinduced GIPR desensitization occurs, we utilized overexpressing
cell lines to detect membrane binding and employed imaging
techniques, which cannot be done in endogenous cell lines that
express relatively low levels of GIPR with current technology and
reagents. First, cells overexpressing GIPR were pre-treated with or
without DA-GIP (1 µM) then cells were washed and incubated
with 125I-GIP for 2 h. Membrane bound 125I-GIP was ~50%
lower in cells pre-treated with DA-GIP (Fig. 8a). Similarly, cells
overexpressing GIPR were pre-incubated with or without DAGIP (100 nM) for 24 h then incubated with Rhodamine-labeled
GIP for 60 mins on ice, and membrane bound Rhodamine-GIP
was also dramatically lower in cells pre-treated with DA-GIP
(Supplemental Fig. 4a). Additionally, cells labeled with a SNAP
Surface Alexa Fluor 647 substrate that only detects GIPR on the
plasma membrane were treated with or without DA-GIP (100

nM) for 24 h, and cells incubated with DA-GIP had dramatically
reduced plasma membrane SNAP-GIPR detection (Supplemental
Fig. 4b, c). After subsequent re-stimulation with GIP (10 nM),
cells that were not incubated with DA-GIP had significant
internalization of SNAP-GIPR with disappearance of SNAPGIPR from the plasma membrane and increased intracellular
SNAP-GIPR content (Supplemental Fig. 4b, c). These plasma
membrane binding and imaging studies suggest reduced availability of membrane GIPR after DA-GIP pre-treatment.
To confirm the hypothesis that DA-GIP pre-treatment reduces
plasma membrane GIPR, cells overexpressing GIPR were pretreated with or without DA-GIP (100 nM) for 24 h then cells were
fixed throughout subsequent re-stimulation with GIP (10 nM) for
imaging using a high content imaging analysis platform. After 24
h pre-treatment with DA-GIP, there was a significant reduction
in total, plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic GIPR as quantified
in Fig. 8b and imaged in Fig. 8c. After re-stimulation with GIP,
cells without DA-GIP pre-treatment had reduced expression of
membrane GIPR over time, indicating ligand-induced receptor
internalization, which brought membrane GIPR levels down to a
similar level as cells pre-treated with DA-GIP, and minimal to no
additional GIPR internalization was observed in DA-GIP pretreated cells (Fig. 8d, e). As previously reported in the
literature10,25, this data demonstrates ligand-mediated GIPR
desensitization due to ligand-induced internalization that, at
least in mouse primary adipocytes and Neuro-2a neuroblastoma
cells, occurs within 24 h (Fig. 7d, g) and does not regain
sensitivity for over 48 h (Fig. 7b), which explains why chronic
GIPR agonism functionally mimics GIPR antagonism.
To assess the desensitization effects of the LA-Agonist
treatment in vivo, DIO mice were treated with vehicle, LAAgonist, or muGIPR-Ab for 6 days. Cumulative food intake was
measured over time and both treatments equally reduced food
intake compared to vehicle (Fig. 9a) as previously reported2,3. The
LA-Agonist significantly reduced fasting blood glucose after
6 days while muGIPR-Ab did not (Fig. 9b) and neither treatment
altered fasting insulin levels (Fig. 9c). There were no differences in
body weight, scWAT, eWAT, or liver weight between groups
(Fig. 9d–g). As expected, DA-GIP significantly stimulated FA
uptake into scWAT compared to saline and muGIPR-Ab blocked
this effect; however, 6 days of treatment with the LA-Agonist also
completely inhibited GIP-stimulated FA uptake into scWAT like
the muGIPR-Ab (Fig. 9h) and no difference was observed in
eWAT (Fig. 9i). Hepatic FA uptake was significantly reduced by
GIP stimulation compared to saline (Fig. 9j), and no significant
differences in skeletal muscle FA uptake was observed (Fig. 9k).
Discussion
Here we demonstrate the in vivo and primary cell action of
chronic GIPR agonism to desensitize GIPR and appear functionally like a GIPR antagonist. Chronic GIPR agonism and
antagonism both provide similar efficacy regarding prevention of
weight gain alone or weight loss when combined with GLP-1RAs
as presented here and previously reported2–5. We hypothesized
that this is explained by agonist-induced desensitization of GIPR
where GIPR has a decreased response to an agonist upon repeated
stimulation compared to the initial exposure to the same agonist26. Indeed, Mohammed et al.10 demonstrated that an initial
GIP stimulation can impair subsequent GIP stimulations associated with disappearance of GIPR from the plasma membrane in
differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Importantly, it was shown that
GIPR is constitutively internalized, i.e., receptor internalization
even in the absence of GIP stimulation, which is an atypical
characteristic of most GPCRs. Additionally, important work from
another group with the peptidic antagonist GIP(3–30)NH2
demonstrated that an antagonist actually restores expression of
GIPR thus increases receptor surface expression27; however, we
speculate that the increased surface expression of GIPR with GIP
(3–30)NH2 is functionally inactive owing to the presence of the
peptide antagonist and thus renders the GIPR non-functional
despite the increase in surface receptors.
We extended the work by the McGraw lab10,25 and demonstrated that in primary mouse adipocytes differentiated in vitro,
in primary human adipocytes differentiated in vitro, and in

mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells that chronic GIPR agonism
impairs the ability of cells to produce cAMP in response to
subsequent stimulation and this functionally results in the
impairment of GIPR function to increase FA uptake into adipocytes. Using overexpressing cell lines, we confirmed by binding
and imaging studies that membrane GIPR expression is dramatically reduced after chronic GIPR agonism due to receptor
internalization. In vivo, both chronic GIPR agonism and antagonism resulted in decreased plasma cAMP, corticosterone, and
glycerol, and resulted in impaired GIP-stimulated subcutaneous
WAT FA uptake and reduction of food intake, a functional
marker of centrally mediated GIPR activity, indicating GIPR
desensitization in adipocytes, adrenal glands, and neuronal cells.
From the data demonstrating similarities in GIPR ligandmediated desensitization in primary mouse adipocytes, primary
human adipocytes, and mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell lines,
we hypothesize that pharmacological GIPR agonism does not
only desensitize GIPR in adipocytes, but may perhaps be a feature
of cell types with relatively low levels of GIPR expression. Both
the LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab display significantly reduced
cumulative food intake after 6 days of treatment (Fig. 9a), indicating that ligand-mediated desensitization in neuronal cell types
could potentially also occur as reflected by desensitization in
mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 7g). This is also
supported by recent work from two different groups demonstrating that central administration of either GIP28 and of an antiGIPR antibody29 both lead to a reduction in food intake, which
we hypothesize can be effectively explained by desensitization of
GIPR in neuronal cells by GIP leading to the same phenotype as
an anti-GIPR antibody. Conversely, in a pancreatic islet cell line,
rat INS1 832/13, cells appear to not desensitize, but rather display
high basal levels of cAMP after chronic GIPR agonism (Fig. 7h),
suggesting that GIPR continues to signal in these cells, although
high basal activity with GIP pre-treatment and lack of response to
fresh GIP represents desensitization to come extent, but the high
basal levels, in contrast to the low levels in the other cell types,
could reflect sustained activation, albeit not maximal. Similarly,
mice treated with LA-Agonist for 21 days were able to respond to
DA-GIP-stimulated insulin secretion 4 h after the last LA-Agonist
dose (Fig. 2j), which suggests that GIPR in pancreatic β-cells does
not desensitize in a manner observed adipocytes or neuronal cells.
We hypothesize that cell type differences in desensitization can be
explained by differences in GIPR expression where pancreatic
islets have dramatically higher levels of Gipr expression compared
to adipose tissue and brain sections (Supplemental Fig. 5).
However, this is a hypothesis that requires further work to
understand whether these cell type differences are due to differences in expression level or other components of cell signaling,

including β-arrestin recruitment and subcellular localization of
the ligand-receptor complex. We now conclude that anti-GIPR
antibodies do not require GIPR activity in pancreatic β-cells for
efficacy2, but rather partially depend on GIPR activity in adipocytes and further work is needed to find additional tissues or cell
types for which GIPR therapies are dependent on, such as neuronal subpopulations as investigated by recent literature28,29.
We and others have shown that GIP stimulates in vitro lipolysis in the absence of insulin19; however, physiological GIP
concentrations likely do not act to promote lipolysis in vivo since
the presence of high GIP will also stimulate insulin secretion, and
insulin is a potent inhibitor of GIP-stimulated lipolysis21. Similar
to insulin, GIP also stimulates FA uptake and re-esterification in
rat adipose tissue22,23 and in mouse primary adipocytes
ex vivo19,24. Nevertheless, the mechanism of GIP-stimulated
adipocyte lipolysis, rather than triglyceride storage, could
potentially be an anti-obesity mechanism for pharmacological
doses of GIPR agonists to overcome the anti-lipolytic effects of
insulin. On the contrary, here we have demonstrated that in fact
chronic GIPR agonism indeed decreases plasma glycerol, a
marker of adipocyte lipolysis, as well as inhibits adipose tissue FA
uptake, like a GIPR antagonist. Both acutely and chronically, the
inhibition of adipose tissue FA uptake leads to an increase in liver
FA uptake, and in chronic studies, results in reduced liver weight
and increased liver FA oxidation genes, suggesting a redistribution of FA from storage in adipose tissue to oxidation in other
tissues.
Additionally, it has been previously hypothesized that GIP’s
incretin action is responsible for decreased adiposity in Gipr
knockout animals30. However, we have now shown that indeed
GIP-stimulated insulin secretion is not required for FA uptake
into adipose tissue in vivo and insulin co-incubation with GIP is
not required for immediate GIP-stimulated FA uptake, which is
not to say that insulin may not modulate or augment either of
these effects acutely or chronically. Furthermore, mice with GIPR
ablation in adipocytes had reduced adiposity after chronic HFD
feeding, demonstrating regulation of adiposity, at least in part, by
adipocyte GIPR. Overall, this work is important to understand
the mechanism for clinical candidates targeting GIPR for the
treatment of obesity, either agonists or antagonists, that chronically both inhibit the activity of GIPR at least in adipose tissue
and potentially in others, such as adrenal glands or the brain.
Limitations of study. An important caveat is that these in vivo
studies were performed in mice while other GIPR antagonists
have been assessed in humans. GIP(3–30)NH2 is a well described
potent antagonist against human GIPR, and has been used
effectively in human studies to prevent GIP-induced insulin
secretion31 and triglyceride uptake in adipose tissue by altering
adipose tissue blood flow32. GIP(3–30)NH2 binds rodent GIPR
differentially (10–40 fold lower binding affinity as determined by
a radioligand competition assay27), possibly owing to the
sequence divergence of the rodent and human GIP peptides.
Despite the effectiveness of the GIP(3–30)NH2 in human, its poor
half-life limits its utility as both a pharmacological agent and a
tool compound for preclinical weight loss studies. We interpret
these species differences to possibly relate to sequence divergence
of the GIP ligand and the GIPR extracellular domain between
rodents and humans and may not represent an intrinsic difference in GPCR activation and G-protein recruitment. Based on
our previous work using a human anti-GIPR antibody in efficacy
studies in nonhuman primates that had improved efficacy on
weight loss compared to muGIPR-Ab in DIO mice2, we think the
use of a mouse-specific antagonistic antibody to GIPR (muGIPRAb) will translate to human studies, particularly since the GIP
EC50 for cAMP in mouse primary adipocytes (3.8 nM, Fig. 3m)
and in human primary adipocytes (1.3 nM2) are similar, and here
we have demonstrated identical ligand-induced GIPR desensitization in both mouse and human primary adipocytes (Fig. 7a, f).
However, differences in responsiveness between obese and diabetic individuals exist that cannot be accounted for by utilizing
DIO mice, though as shown in Supplemental Fig. 2g–n, lean mice
do not differ in body weight, adipose tissue or liver weight, or
GIP-stimulated FA uptake after treatment with muGIPR-Ab as
seen in DIO mice, suggesting inherent differences in GIPR signaling between lean and obese animals.
Additionally, here we focused on the direct effects of the LAAgonist and muGIPR-Ab alone and not in combination with
GLP1-RAs. We feel that this is important to understand the
biology of GIPR alone but recognize that co-administration of
GLP-1RAs could modulate the effects presented here either
directly or indirectly, though adipocytes do not express GLP-1R.
Moreover, many of the in vivo assays here used superphysiological concentrations of DA-GIP to develop these assays
and may not reflect physiological activity but do remain
important for considering the effects of GIPR agonists in vivo.
Methods
LA-agonist generation. Starting with the (G4S)3K(ivdde)-Rink amide resin subassembly (0.6 mmol, CEM), the remainder of the peptide (sequence: Y[Aib]EGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKGKKNDWKHNITQ) was built using DIC/
Oxyma chemistry in DMF on a Protein Technologies Tribute peptide synthesizer
and standard reagents for Fmoc-SPPS. For the final coupling in the sequence, BocY(OtBu)-OH was utilized. For each coupling, 5 eq of DIC, Oxyma, and amino acid
were used. Most couplings were performed at 75 °C with IR heating for 5 min (final
Boc-Y coupling was performed at 50 °C for 25 min, both H couplings were performed at 50 °C for 10 min). Double-couplings were performed after each aromatic
or beta-branched residue. Deprotections were performed at 50 °C with 20% 4-Mepiperidine in DMF.
After completion of the main chain, the resin was placed in a 100-mL synthesis
vessel and washed with DMF (30 mL x2). The resin was treated with 5% Hydrazine
in DMF (10 mL) and gently shaken at room temperature for 5 min. The solution
was drained under vacuum and the deprotection was repeated 10 times. The resin
was washed with DMF (100 mL x2) and DCM (100 mL x3). In a separate vessel, a
solution of DIC (0.935 mL, 6.00 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was slowly added to a
solution of bromoacetic acid (1.667 g, 12.00 mmol) in DCM (30 mL) (exotherm
produced). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min then added to
the previously deprotected resin. The reaction was shaken at room temperature for
18 h, then the solvent was drained, and the resin was washed with DCM (50
mL x4).
The resin was treated with TIPS (2 mL), water (2 mL), and TFA (40 mL). The
mixture was kept at room temperature for 3 h with stirring. The cleavage solution
was drained into a 250-mL RBF and concentrated to about half of the original
volume on rotavap. Cold cyclopentylmethyl ether was added to the solution and
the suspension was filtered and washed with more CPME yielding 2.55 g of crude
material.
The crude peptide was dissolved in Water/MeCN (2:1) and injected onto a prep
HPLC column (Phenomenex Gemini, 5 µ, 250 ×30 mm (~300 mg/injection), and
A: 0.1% TFA in H2O, B: 0.1% TFA in CH3CN). The column was eluted with a
gradient of 20–40%B over 50 min with a 5-min flush and 10-min equilibration at a
flow rate of 60 mL/min. The fractions were analyzed by LC-MS. The purification
was repeated 10 times and the combined pool was lyophilized to give dry peptide.
The peptide was dissolved in water and submitted for cation exchange purification
(GE HiPrep 16/10 SP/HP column, 5 mL/min, A: 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0, B: 20 mM
NaOAc,1.0 M NaCl, pH 5.0, Gradient A– >B 0–50% over 50 min). The fractions
were desalted using Amicon Ultra-15 spin concentrators (MWCO = 3000) into
water before being freeze-dried by lyophilization, yielding 136 mg of pure Y[Aib]

Serum-free adapted CHOK1 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using a
lipid-based transfection reagent. After antibiotic selection, a stable pool expressing
the monoclonal antibody was propagated in proprietary in-house media. A 10-day
fed-batch production was carried out in GE Wave bioreactor. In a separate flask,
100 ml GenScript AmMag Protein A Magnetic Beads are sanitized with 0.2 N
sodium hydroxide, equilibrated and then slurried at 1:1 ratio in PBS, and finally
added to the 25 L Wave Bag ~18 h prior to harvesting. The following day, the
magnetic Protein A beads are trapped in the Wave Bag with a plate magnet while
the cells and spent media are drained. The 100 ml of Protein A beads are then

resuspended in 2.5 L of PBS and drained into a bottle as the starting material for
purification.
The Genscript AmMag Protein A Magnetic Beads in PBS are poured into a 10-L
Conical Tank customized for magnetic bead processing. Magnetic beads are held
within the tank with a ring magnet and the PBS is drained. Magnetic beads are then
resuspended and washed 2x with 2.5 L of de-ionized water. The beads are next
washed 3x with 2 L of 25 mM TRIS-HCl, 0.1 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 (TBS), and
followed by a final 5-L de-ionized water wash to remove all buffering components
of the TBS in preparation for the elution step.
To elute the antibody, the beads are rinsed from the tank with 200 ml of 0.1 M
sodium acetate, pH 3.6 into a 500-ml bottle and placed on a roller rack at 65 rpm
for 15 min. The beads are held in the bottle with a small circular magnet while the
elution is poured into another bottle. The elution is immediately neutralized with a
1% (v/v) addition of 3 M Tris Base. The elution step is repeated 3x to ensure full
antibody elution from Protein A beads. The material was buffer exchanged into 10
mM sodium acetate, 9% sucrose, and pH 5.2. Heavy chain sequence (conjugation

To a 500-mL bottle was added to 300 mL of 2.5 mM cystamine, 2.5 mM
cysteamine, 40 mM HEPES, pH 8.2, and an antibody with engineered cysteines
(Cys-mAb) (197.5 ml, 10.9 mg/mL, and 0.015 mmol). The mixture was shaken for
18 h at room temperature. The solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and
diluted with 100 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0, then loaded directly onto the CEX column.
The mixture was purified by cation exchange chromatography (GE 240 mL SP/HP,
A: 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0, B: A + 1.0 M NaCl, 0–30% over 10 CV, and 20 mL/
min). The fractions containing product were combined and buffer exchanged by
TFF (Millipore Pellicon3, Ultracel 30 kDa Membrane, 88 cm2) into 10 mM sodium
acetate, 9% sucrose, pH 5.2, yielding 450 mL of a solution of Cys-mAb-CA cap at
4.3 mg/mL (90% yield). LC-TOF MS: Predicted 144510, found: 144485.
To a 1000-mL reservoir on a TFF instrument was added 10 mM sodium acetate,
9% sucrose, pH 5.2 (100 mL), Cys-mAb-CA cap (232 ml, 6.88 µmol) and
triphenylphosphine-3,3′,3′′-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, 3.4 mM
in H2O; 8.09 ml, 0.028 mmol). The mixture was gently stirred for 90 min at room
temperature. When the reaction was complete by ion exchange chromatography,
the solution was concentrated to 100 mL and buffer exchanged by TFF (30 kD
MWCO, Millipore Ultracel membrane, 88 cm2) into 10 mM sodium acetate, 9%
sucrose, pH 5.2. To the solution was added 150 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2
mM EDTA, pH 7.5, followed by dehydroascorbic acid (Biosynth International, 4.0
mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5; 17.20 ml, 0.069 mmol).
The re-oxidation was monitored by HPLC to minimize the amount of free light
chain species in relation to fully intact Ab. When the reaction was sufficiently
complete, GIPR agonist peptide (2.0 mM in H2O; 20.64 ml, 0.041 mmol) was
added. The mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The solution
was concentrated to 100 mL and buffer exchanged into A5Su using TFF (MWCO
30,000). The concentrated solution was recovered from the instrument with several
washes. The solution was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and diluted with 2 M
ammonium sulfate, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0. The solution was purified using
hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Custom GE Sepharose butyl HP
column, 159 mL, ~35 mm × 200 mm). The solution was directly loaded onto the
column with a sample loading pump. The desired compound was eluted under
gradient conditions (12 mL/min, 100% A for 2 CV, 0–90% over 10 CV, hold for 2
CV, 100% for 2 CV, pure water for 2 CV, A: 1 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM
NaOAc, pH 5.0, B: 20 mM NaOAc, 10% CH3CN, pH 5.0). The fractions containing
DAR2 were pooled, combined with identical product runs, concentrated, and
buffer exchanged into 10 mM sodium acetate, 9% sucrose, pH 5.2 using TFF (30
kD MWCO, Millipore Ultracel membrane, 88 cm2). The purified product was
collected with washes to give 302 mL of a 3.4-mg/mL solution. The final
concentration was achieved by centrifugal ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15
spin concentrators (30000 MWCO) followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm
syringe filter to give 52 mL of 19.4 mg/mL LA-Agonist solution (50% yield overall).
96.1% purity by SEC, LC-TOF MS: predicted: 156,580, found: 156,574.
LA-Agonist in vitro selectivity. LA-Agonist activity was assessed in vitro in CHO
cells stably expressing mouse GIPR, mouse GLP1R, or human glucagon receptor
compared to mouse GIP (Phoenix), mouse GLP-1 (Phoenix), mouse glucagon
(Phoenix), human DA-GIP (Phoenix), and LA-Agonist peptide only. Briefly,
cAMP production was determined using a homogeneous time-resolved
fluorescence (HTRF) assay (Cisbio). Serial diluted agonists were incubated with
40,000 cells in assay buffer (0.1% BSA and 500 μM IBMX in DMEM) for 15 min at
37 °C. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer containing cAMP-d2 and cAMP
cryptate (Cisbio, Bedford, Massachusetts) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before measurement in the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
Massachusetts). The cAMP levels are expressed as a fluorescence ratio of 665/620
nm.
LA-Agonist in vivo studies. All studies using mice complied with all relevant
ethical regulations and approval for the studies performed were obtained from
Amgen’s IACUC institutional review board (Thousand Oaks, CA). Lighting in
animal holding rooms was maintained on 12:12 h light:dark cycle, and the ambient
temperature and humidity range was at 68–79 °F and 30–70%, respectively. Animals had ad libitum access to irradiated pelleted feed and reverse-osmosis
chlorinated (0.3–0.5 ppm) water via an automatic watering system. Cages were
changed weekly. Male C57Bl6/J DIO mice (stock #380050) or age-matched lean
controls (stock #380056) were purchased from Jackson laboratory. After arrival,
DIO mice were continued on high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat, Research Diets) or
lean controls fed standard chow diet (Envigo Teklad Global Rodent Diet-soy
protein-free extruded 2020X).
To assess in vivo selectivity, male DIO Giprfl/fl and GiprβCell−/− littermates
(mice previously described2) were fasted for 6 h, then baseline retroorbital (RO)
bleed taken (T0), and immediately IP injected with glucose (0.5 g/kg) and saline,
DA-GIP (250 nmol/kg), or LA-Agonist peptide only (250 nmol/kg) as indicated
then blood samples collected by RO bleed after 30 mins. Plasma insulin was
measured using the High Range Mouse Insulin ELISA (Alpco).
LA-Agonist pharmacodynamic (PD) assay for GIP-stimulated insulin secretion
where DIO mice fed HFD for 13 weeks were IP injected with saline or LA-Agonist
in escalating doses, fasted for 4 h, then baseline retroorbital bleed taken (T0), and
immediately IP injected with saline or DA-GIP (50 nmol/kg) and 2 g/kg glucose
then blood samples collected by RO bleed over time for blood glucose measured by
glucometer and plasma insulin. Plasma insulin was measured using the High Range
Mouse Insulin ELISA (Alpco).
LA-Agonist was administered as a single intravenous (IV) or IP injection of 5
mg/kg to male CD-1 mice (n = 3 mice/administration route/timepoint). Blood
samples for PK analysis were collected at serial time points up to 7 days post-dose.
Samples were processed to plasma and stored at ~−70 °C (±10 °C) until transferred
for subsequent analysis.
LA-Agonist concentrations in mouse plasma were determined by liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LA-Agonist stock
solution (1 mg/mL) was made from reference standards in 10 mM sodium acetate,
9% sucrose, pH 5 (A5Su) buffer and used to prepare a 100-μg/mL working solution
in A5Su buffer. Standard concentrations of 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, and 10,000
ng/mL were prepared by serial dilution of a freshly prepared 10,000 ng/mL solution
in mouse plasma using the 100-μg/mL LA-Agonist working solution. In all, 25 μl
mouse plasma samples were aliquoted into the appropriate well of a 96-well plate,
followed by immunoaffinity capture using Protein-A cartridges on an AssayMap
Bravo affinity purification system (Agilent). Samples were then eluted with 25 μl of
50% ACN 0.1% formic acid. The eluted samples were denatured using 0.1%
RapiGest (Waters) and reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and
followed by trypsin digestion. After quenching with formic acid, samples were
transferred to a 96-well plate. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed utilizing an
ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) and a Sciex 5500 QTrap MS system, the raw
data were collected using Sciex Analyst® v1.5. LC-MS/MS detection of intact LAAgonist was performed using a surrogate peptide of the GIP peptide N-terminus
with a sequence of Y[Aib]EGTFISDYSIAMDK. The concentrations of plasma
quality controls (QCs) and unknown samples were calculated using Watson (v7.4;
Thermo) by weighted linear regression with a weighting factor of 1/x2 from plasma
calibration standards run within the same batch.
LA-Agonist concentrations in mouse plasma samples collected during the PD
assay were determined as described above. The IC50 and EC50 of LA-Agonist in
relation to the glucose and insulin response, respectively, was calculated following
logarithmic transformation and nonlinear fit of data using a sigmoidal doseresponse model with variable slope in GraphPad Prism (v7.02; GraphPad
Software).
LA-Agonist PK was initially characterized utilizing noncompartmental analysis
(NCA) of observed data from the single-dose PK study in mice. Plasma
concentration-time data were subsequently fit by nonlinear regression to
alternative compartmental PK models, with model selection guided by goodnessof-fit diagnostics and parameter estimate precision. A 2-compartment PK model
with first-order elimination was found to best describe the LA-Agonist plasma
data. Ensuing PK modeling was performed to simulate LA-Agonist exposure and
predict dosing necessary to achieve target coverage in the chronic efficacy study.
PK parameter estimates generated from NCA are provided in Supplemental
Information (Supplemental Table 1). All PK analyses were conducted in Phoenix
WinNonlin (v6.4; Certara).
DIO mice fed HFD for 12 weeks at the start of the study dosed with vehicle
(saline 1x/day and vehicle 1x every 6 days), liraglutide (0.3 mg/kg liraglutide 1x/day
and vehicle 1x/day; Bachem), LA-Agonist (37.5 mg/kg LA-Agonist 1x/day and

day), LA-Agonist + liraglutide (37.5 mg/kg LA-Agonist 1x/day and 0.3 mg/kg
liraglutide 1x/day), and muGIPR-Ab + liraglutide (25 mg/kg muGIPR-Ab 1x every
6 days and 0.3 mg/kg liraglutide 1x/day) for 21 days. MRI measurement taken at
treatment days −2 and 18, and body weight and food intake measured over time.
On day 21, regular dosing followed by 4-h fast, then T0 RO bleed immediately
followed by IP injections of DA-GIP (50 nmol/kg) + glucose (2 g/kg) given to all
mice with a RO bleed at T15 and terminal decapitation blood collection at
T80 min, then tissues collected, weighed, and flash frozen. Plasma insulin was
measured by ELISA (Alpco) and plasma adipokines were measured using Milliplex
MAP Mouse Adipokine Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore Sigma).
Plasma metabolomics. Plasma metabolomics was performed on terminal decapitation blood collected 80 min post-glucose and DA-GIP injection as described
above by Metabolon using the Metabolon HD4 Platform. Plasma samples were
prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR® system from Hamilton Company.
Several recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction
process for QC purposes. Samples were extracted with methanol under vigorous
shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) to precipitate protein and dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein
matrix, followed by centrifugation to recover chemically diverse metabolites. The
resulting extract was divided into five fractions: two for analysis by two separate
reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods using positive ion mode electrospray
ionization (ESI), one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS using negative ion mode
ESI, one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS using negative ion mode ESI, and
one reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap® (Zymark) to
remove the organic solvent. The sample extracts were stored overnight under
nitrogen before preparation for analysis. Several types of quality control samples
were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples. These include: (1) technical replicate samples derived from a pool of well-characterized human plasma
(MTRX), (2) extracted water samples (process blanks) and solvent blanks; and (3) a
cocktail of QC standards, carefully chosen not to interfere with the measurement of
endogenous compounds, spiked into every analyzed sample, allowing instrument
performance monitoring and aiding with chromatographic alignment.
Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy
(UPLC-MS/MS): All methods utilize a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid
chromatography (UPLC) and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/
accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESIII) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution. The
sample extract was dried then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of the
four methods. Each reconstitution solvent contains a series of standards at fixed
concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. One aliquot
was analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions, chromatographically optimized
for more hydrophilic compounds. In this method, the extract was gradient eluted
from a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18–2.1×100 mm, 1.7 µm) using water
and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic
acid (FA). A second aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions
but is chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds. In this
method, the extract is gradient eluted from the aforementioned C18 column using
methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA and 0.01% FA, and was operated at an
overall higher organic content. A third aliquot was analyzed using basic negative
ion optimized conditions using a separate dedicated C18 column. The basic
extracts are gradient eluted from the column using methanol and water, however
with 6.5 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot was analyzed via
negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH
Amide 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 µm) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile
with 10 mM Ammonium Formate, pH 10.8. The MS analysis alternates between
MS and data-dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion. The scan range varies
slightly between methods, but covers ~70–1000 m/z.
Bioinformatics: the informatics system consists of four major components, the
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), the data extraction and
peak-identification software, data processing tools for QC and compound
identification, and a collection of statistical, visualization, and interpretation tools
for use by data analysts. The hardware and software foundations for these
informatics components are the LAN backbone and database servers running
Oracle 10.2.0.1 Enterprise Edition.
Data extraction and compound identification: raw data were extracted, peakidentified, and QC processed using Metabolon’s hardware and software,
Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards
or recurrent unknown entities. Metabolon maintains a library based on
authenticated standards that contains the retention time/index (RI), mass to charge
ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) on all
molecules present in the library. Furthermore, biochemical identifications are based
on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed
identification, accurate mass match to the library ±10 ppm, and the MS/MS
forward and reverse scores. MS/MS scores are based on a comparison of the ions
present in the experimental spectrum to ions present in the library entry spectrum.
Curation: a variety of curation procedures are performed to ensure that a highquality data set is made available for statistical analysis and data interpretation. The
QC and curation processes are designed to ensure accurate and consistent
identification of true chemical entities, and to remove those representing system
artifacts, mis-assignments, redundancy, and background noise. Metabolon data
analysts use internally developed visualization and interpretation software to
confirm the consistency of peak identification among the various samples. Library
matches for each compound are checked for each sample and corrected if
necessary. Peaks are quantified as area-under-the-curve detector ion counts.
Statistical analysis: all statistical analysis was performed by Metabolon, who
were blinded to the experimental treatments, and were not altered in any way by
Amgen or the authors. Standard statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio
on log transformed data using Welch’s two-sample t-test to test whether two
unknown means are different from two independent populations with p ≤ 0.05
indicating statistical significance. To correct for multiple comparisons, the q-value
method for False Discovery Rate was used at a cutoff q ≤ 0.233.
Pathway enrichment analysis: pathway enrichment was determined using
Metabolync software (Metabolon) where Enrichment Score = (k/m)/(n/N), where
k = number of significant metabolites in a pathway, m = total number of detected
metabolites in the pathway, n = total number of significantly different metabolites,
and N = total number of detected metabolites per pathway.
In vivo GIP-stimulated corticosterone and glycerol secretion. DIO mice fed
HFD for 12 weeks fasted for 10 h overnight then at 7 a.m., blood sample collected by
RO bleed then immediately IP injected with saline or DA-GIP in escalating doses, and
blood collected by RO bleed over time as indicated. Plasma metabolites corticosterone
(Alpco) and glycerol (Sigma) measured over time. DA-GIP EC90 for corticosterone
secretion was calculated determined following nonlinear fit of data using a sigmoidal
dose-response model with variable slope (GraphPad Prism). Subsequently, DIO mice
fed HFD for 12 weeks were pre-treated with vehicle or muGIPR-Ab 24-h before
baseline bleed collection (T0), fasted for 10 h overnight then at 7 a.m., blood sample
collected by RO bleed then immediately injected with saline or DA-GIP (80 nmol/kg),
and blood collected by RO bleed as indicated. Plasma metabolites corticosterone and
glycerol measured at T0 and 30 min post-dose.
Primary mouse pre-adipocyte isolation and differentiation. Using the method
originally described by Viswanadha and Londos34, the subcutaneous WAT was
isolated and dissected from male DIO mice, weighed, and immediately submerged
in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer at pH 7.4 with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 500 nM adenosine, and 5 mM glucose, and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and primary adipocytes were separated by collagenase digestion (1 mg/
mL KRB) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 1 h. After digestion,
the mixture was filtered through a 250-µm gauze mesh into a 15-ml conical
polypropylene tube and the infranatant containing the collagenase solution and the
SVF was carefully removed using a long needle and syringe. The SVF was cultured
as previously described by Hausman et al.35 where the SVF containing solution was
centrifuged at 200×g for 10 min to pellet the SVF cells, resuspended in 10 mL
plating medium (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS), then filtered through a sterile 20-μm
mesh filter into a sterile 50-mL plastic centrifuge tube. SVF cells were plated in 24-
well plate at 250,000 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight then
the plating medium and nonadherent cells where removed, replaced with DMEM/
F12 media + 5% FBS, and media was replaced every two days until cells reached
confluency (5–6 days after plating). Differentiation was induced by the addition of
differentiation media for 48 h (DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS + 17 nM insulin, 0.1 μM
dexamethasone, 250 μM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 60 μM indomethacin). After 48 h, the differentiation media was replaced by maintenance
media (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 17 nM insulin) for a total of 10 days with the
maintenance media replaced every 2–3 days.
Primary mouse adipocyte cAMP assay. cAMP assay was performed with HTRF
dynamic cAMP assay (Cisbio) as previously described with modification for a 24-
well plate2 where adipocytes were incubated in Ham’s F12 containing 0.1% BSA
and 0.5 mM IBMX plus mouse GIP (Phoenix) in triplicates for 30 min. For
muGIPR-Ab treatment, adipocytes were incubated with fresh maintenance media
containing muGIPR-Ab overnight, then the media was removed and replaced with
Ham’s F12 containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM IBMX plus mouse GIP (Phoenix) in
triplicates and incubated for 30 min. cAMP concentration of each well was
determined using the cAMP dynamic 2 kit (CisBio) following manufacturer’s
instructions as described above and data expressed as the ratio of 665 nm/620 nm,
which is inversely proportional to cAMP concentration where 0 represents maximal cAMP concentration.
Primary mouse adipocyte lipolysis. Mature primary adipocytes differentiated as
described above treated with mouse GIP (Phoenix) for 2 h compared to basal or after
overnight incubation with muGIPR-Ab then treated with 10 nM mouse GIP for 2 h in
Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer at pH 7.4 with 4% BSA (Sigma) and 5 mM
glucose (Sigma). Glycerol released into the medium was determined as lipolytic
activity using a fluorometric assay previously described36 where samples were
extracted by adding equal volume of 0.65 N perchloric acid, vortexed, incubated on ice
for 10 min, and then neutralized with imidazole-KCl-KOH to precipitate the BSA
from solution. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Samples
were aliquoted in 50 µL dilutions in triplicate to a flat white 96-well microplate, and
50 µL reaction mix (10 mL glycine buffer, 75. U glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase

type I, 15.3 U glycerol kinase, and 115 µL hydrazine hydrate) added to each well. The
plate was mixed on a rotor plate for 10 min at 200 rpm then fluorescence measured
(excitation: 350 nm, emission: 466 nm) for time 0 measurement. In total, 3 µL 2.5%
NAD+ was added to each well and the plate was mixed on a rotor plate for 10 min at
200 rpm then incubated at room temperature for a total incubation time of 45 min.
After 45 min incubation, fluorescence was measured (excitation: 350, emission: 466)
and time 0 measurement was subtracted from time 45 min measurement, and results
were calculated using an interpolated standard curve (sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log concentration) using GraphPad Prism v. 7.02.
Fatty acid uptake assay in mouse primary adipocytes. Primary adipocyte fatty
acid uptake was measured using the QBT Fatty Acid Uptake Assay Kit (Molecular
Devices) as previously described37 with modification for a 24-well plate. Briefly,
adipocytes were incubated with GIP or insulin in DMEM/F12 at 37 °C for 30 min
then 2X loading buffer (Molecular Devices) was added per well for a final 1X
dilution then the plate was immediately read for kinetic fluorescence (excitation =
485 nm, emission = 515 nm) every 20 s for 1 h. Fatty acid uptake rate was determined as the slope of the line from time 0–5 min (RFU/second).
GIP-stimulated fatty acid uptake assay in vivo. Fatty acid uptake in DIO mice
was performed as previously described38 with modifications optimized from
internal pilot studies. DIO mice fed HFD for 12 weeks pre-treated with vehicle or
muGIPR-Ab (25 mg/kg) for 24-h then were IP dosed with saline or DA-GIP (150
nmol/kg; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) and simultaneously oral gavaged with 200 µL
of 2 µCi 14C-oleic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in olive oil (ThermoFisher) after a 6-h fast to assess in vivo fatty acid uptake. Blood samples were
collected over time by RO bleed, and plasma insulin measured over time by ELISA
(Alpco) and plasma radioactivity measured over time by scintillation counting
(ThermoFisher). Radioactivity uptake into metabolically relevant tissues was
determined by CPM/mg tissue at necropsy (180 min post-dose) by digesting the
tissue using Biosol (National Diagnostics) and scintillation counting using Bioscint
(National Diagnostics) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For the 6-day LA-Agonist and muGIPR-Ab in vivo fatty acid uptake assay, mice
fed HFD for 11 weeks were acclimated to daily saline IP injections for 6 days prior
to the study, food intake was measured daily, and mice that shredded their food
during acclimation were removed before treatment began, as it made the food
intake assessment unreliable. On week 12 HFD feeding, mice were randomized into
treatment groups based on body weight and average food intake. Mice were IP
injected daily for 6 days with vehicle, muGIPR-Ab (25 mg/kg on day 1, vehicle on
days 2–6), or LA-Agonist (37.5 mg/kg/day), and body weight and food intake were
measured daily. On day 6, mice were dosed appropriately, fasted for 5 h, RO bled
for baseline glucose measurement, then the in vivo FA uptake assay was performed
as described above after a 6-h fast.
Generation of GiprAdipo−/− mice. Mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by the
adiponectin promoter were generated by Horizon Discovery (now Envigo). An
Adipoq-Cre BAC clone was prepared by insertion of Cre cDNA into the Adipoq
gene, purified, and the BAC DNA sequenced for confirmation. Embryos were
injected with a modified BAC containing the Cre sequence at the Adiponectin gene
locus. Specifically, the starting ATG and 222 bp of the Adiponectin gene sequence
in the BAC was replaced with Cre sequence. Animals were produced via pronuclear
microinjection into single-cell embryos followed by embryo transfer to pseudopregnant females. The resulting live births were screened for mutations by PCR and
genotyping of pups to identify animals positive for BAC insertion. The resulting F1
pups positive for BAC insertion (n = 4) were bred to wild-type C57Bl6/n mice
(Taconic), and the resulting pups were genotyped and Cre recombinase expression
was measured by RT-PCR, and the founder line with the highest expression was
chosen to ship to Charles River for backcrossing to C57Bl6/n mice.
A test mating was performed to confirm adipocyte-specific expression of
Adipoq-Cre by mating these Adipoq-Cre mice to R26R mice [purchased from
Jackson Laboratories B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor/J] to generate mice that
express lacZ in tissues that express Cre recombinase. Expression was confirmed by
staining for β-galactosidase in adipose tissue, pancreas, and reproductive tissues of
male and female mice (Supplemental Fig. 3a, b). Adipoq-Cre+ mice did not differ
from their wild-type Adipoq-Cre- littermates in their response to HFD body weight
gain, fat mass, lean mass, or blood glucose (Supplemental Fig. 3c–f).
Adipoq-Cre+ mice were mated to Giprfl/fl mice (previously described2) to
generate mice with heterozygous floxed Gipr gene with or without the Adipoq-Cre
transgene. Heterozygous floxed Gipr female mice with the Adipoq-Cre transgene
were mated to heterozygous floxed Gipr male mice without the Adipoq-Cre
transgene to produce homozygous floxed Gipr (Giprfl/fl) mice with or without the
Adipoq-Cre transgene. Subsequent progeny were generated by mating Giprfl/fl male
mice (no Adipoq-Cre) with female homozygous floxed Gipr mice with the AdipoqCre transgene (GiprAdipo−/−) to produce mice with adipocyte knockout of Gipr
(GiprAdipo−/−) and their wild-type Giprfl/fl littermates were used as controls for all
experiments. Primary adipocytes were isolated and pre-adipocytes were
differentiated in vitro as described above. Pancreatic islets were isolated as
previously described2 where mice were euthanized by terminal decapitation and
the peritoneal cavity exposed. The Sphincter of Oddi was clamped and 4–6 mL of
cold enzyme buffer (1X Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM HEPES, 100 mg/L
Dnase I, and 1×Penicillin/Streptomycin with Glutamine)/collagenase (1 mg/mL)
was introduced via the bile duct. Following inflation, the pancreas was removed
and transferred to a 50 mL falcon tube containing 5 mL enzyme buffer/collagenase
on ice. The pancreas was digested at 37 °C for 10–20 min and then the tube was
shaken by hand 5–10 times. The digestion was stopped by adding 50 mL cold
quenching buffer (enzyme buffer + 10% FBS). The islets were collected by
centrifugation at 500 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the islet
pellet was resuspended in 50 mL quenching buffer and spun again. Following the
two washes, the islet pellet was put on a 3 level histopaque (Sigma) gradient and
spun 30 min at 2200 rpm, with the centrifuge brake turned off. Following
centrifugation, the purified islets were removed from the middle layer and picked
into a fresh culture dish containing RPMI. From there, the islets were picked into 2
mL Eppendorf tubes and frozen at −80 °C in Trizol (Invitrogen) for RNA analysis.
RNA was isolated using RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) and was quantified by RT-PCR
as previously described2 where cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of RNA
using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and gene expression
quantified using PowerUp Sybr Green Reagents (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturers’ instructions. The following primer pairs were used for Gipr
expression normalized to Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (Eef2): Gipr F: TTGTG
TGGGAGCCAATTACA, Gipr R: ACCCAGGGAATGACGAAAAG, Eef2 F: AG
CGAGGACAAAGACAAGGA, and Eef2 R: GGGATGGTAAGTGGATGGTG.
Male mice were fed HFD for 12 weeks and female mice were fed HFD for
8 weeks during which body weight, fat mass, lean mass, and food intake was
measured over time. Mice were then IP injected with vehicle or muGIPR-Ab (25
mg/kg) every 6 days for 48 days for males and 67 days for females. At necropsy,
liver was dissected, weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver RNA was
isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and gene expression quantified using
Quantigene Plex Gene Expression Assay (Thermo Fisher) using manufacturer’s
instructions with 100 ng RNA per reaction and data normalized to Gapdh.
Human adipocyte cAMP assay. Human adipocytes differentiated in vitro were
purchased from Zen-Bio and cAMP assay performed as previously described2
where adipocytes were incubated in Ham’s F12 (Gibco) containing 0.1% BSA
(Sigma) and 0.5 mM IBMX plus human GIP (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) in triplicates for 30 min. cAMP concentration of each well was determined using the
cAMP dynamic 2 kit (CisBio) following manufacturer’s instructions as
described above.
Mouse endogenous GIPR cell lines cAMP assay. Mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells (ATCC) and rat INS1 832/13 insulinoma cells (EMD Millipore) were
used to measure GIP-stimulated cAMP production in a homogeneous timeresolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay (Cisbio,). Neuro-2a cells were cultured in
Minimum Essential Media (MEM) w/ Earle’s Salts, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and INS1 cells were cultured
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI-1640) medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES), and 0.05 mM βmercaptoethanol in a humidified incubator maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Each
cell line was plated at 40,000 cells per well and pre-incubated for 24 h with 1 µM of
mouse or rat GIP (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) in assay buffer (0.1% bovine serum
albumin in MEM or RPMI-1640 media). The GIP pre-incubation was removed,
and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then
incubated for 15 min with serially diluted GIP in assay buffer containing 500 µM 3-
Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer containing cAMP-d2 and cAMP cryptate (Cisbio) and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature before measurement in the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). The
cAMP levels were expressed as a fluorescence ratio of 665/620 nm. The data points
were then fit using a log (agonist) versus response, variable slope (4 parameters) in
GraphPad Prism to generate EC50 curves.
I-125 GIP membrane binding. HEK293T cells overexpressing GIPR were used to
determine homologous 125I-GIP membrane binding. Cells were treated with or
without 1 µM DA-GIP (Tocris 6699) in PDL-coated 96-well plates (Corning
354651) and incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM (GIBCO 11965084) in 5%
CO2 at 37 °C. The following day, unbound DA-GIP was washed off, and cells were
assayed binding using 125I-labeled human GIP (Perkin Elmer NEX402) in binding
buffer (50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.5% BSA) for 2 h in room
temperature. After incubation, cells were washed in ice-cold binding buffer and
lysed using 200 mM NaOH with 1% SDS for 30 min. Lysate samples were then
transferred to Polystyrene NBS plates (Corning 3600) prior to addition of WGA
PVT SPA beads (Perkin Elmer RPNQ0001) and incubated overnight in room
temperature. The radioactivity was measured as cpm in a TopCount NXT gamma
counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Concentration-response curves were fitted to
a nonlinear regression (one site—specific binding) in GraphPad Prism (version
7.04, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Rhodamine-GIP membrane binding. CHOK1 cells stably expressing human GIPR
(CHOK1 + GIPR) and CHOK1 cells were cultured in Ham’s F12 (Gibco)

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (PSG) with or
without 5 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well in
96-well plates and cultured for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow cell attachment prior
to treatment with vehicle (culture media) or 100 nM DA-GIP. After 24 h of
treatment, cells were washed three times prior to acclimation to assay buffer
(F12 + 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were then placed on ice for
another 15 min prior to treatment with a dose titration of Rhodamine GIP (8 nM to
2 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceutical) in ice-cold F12 + 0.1% BSA. Cells were incubated
with Rhodamine-GIP on ice for 60 min and then washed three times with cold PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed and stained with
Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher) for nuclei detection. Cells were imaged with
Operetta CLS high content imaging system (Perkin Elmer) and Rhodamine-GIP
fluorescence was quantitated using the Harmony analysis software (Perkin Elmer).
Data represented as relative fluorescence unit (RFU) with background fluorescence
(calculated from CHOK1 cells) subtracted.
GIPR subcellular localization and internalization imaging. GIPR subcellular
localization and internalization were assessed in CHOK1 cells stably expressing
human GIPR (CHOK1 + GIPR) or SNAP tagged human GIPR (CHOK1 + SNAPGIPR) with CHOK1 as the negative control for background determination. Cells
were cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PSG (CHOK1)
with 5 µg/mL puromycin (CHOK1 + GIPR), or 0.5 mg/mL geneticin (CHOK1 +
SNAP-GIPR). Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates
and cultured for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow cell attachment prior to treatment
with vehicle (culture media) or DA-GIP (100 nM). After 24 h of treatment, cells
were washed three times prior to acclimation to assay buffer (F12 + 0.1% BSA) for
30 min (CHOK1 + SNAP-GIPR) or 1 h (CHOK1 + GIPR) at 37 °C. CHOK1 +
SNAP-GIPR cells were incubated with a cell impermeable SNAP-SurfaceAlexa
Fluor 647 substrate (S9136S, New England Biolabs) in F12 + 0.1% BSA for 30 min
to label all cell surface GIPR and then washed to remove excess unbound labels.
After the acclimation/labeling, cells were re-stimulated with GIP (10 nM) and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde at the indicated timepoint. Cells were then washed 0.3
M glycine and permeabilized with 0.2% triton-X 100. To detect GIPR in CHOK1
+ GIPR cells, cells were first blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) for 1 h
at room temperature and incubated with a mouse anti-human GIPR monoclonal
antibody at 10 µg/mL (MAB8210, R&D Systems) at 4 °C overnight followed by 1 h
incubation with Alexa-Fluor 647 conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at 4
µg/mL (A32728, Thermo Fisher) for detection. Hoechst 33342 were used for nuclei
detection. Images were captured using Operetta CLS high content imaging system
(Perkin Elmer) and analyzed by using the Harmony analysis software (Perkin
Elmer) to quantify the subcellular GIPR content expressed as relative fluorescence
intensity unit (RFU) or internalized GIPR content as spots with background values
(calculated from CHOK1) subtracted.
Statistics and reproducibility. All values are presented as mean ± SEM. The
significance of differences was determined by an unpaired or paired two-tailed
Student’s t test for comparing two groups as appropriate, one-way ANOVA was
performed when there were 3 or more experimental groups with one experimental
outcome being measured, or two-way ANOVA was performed whenever an
experimental outcome being measured was influenced by two experimental variables followed by multiple comparisons test if applicable. Repeated measures oneor two-way ANOVA was performed if measuring multiple time points over time.
Differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. All statistical parameters can
be found in the figure legends. Data was analyzed using Graphpad Prism (versions
7.02 or 7.04).
For metabolomics analysis, all statistical analysis was performed by Metabolon,
who were blinded to the experimental treatments, and were not altered in any way
by Amgen or the authors. Standard statistical analyses were performed in
ArrayStudio on log transformed data using Welch’s two-sample t-test to test
whether two unknown means are different from two independent populations with
p ≤ 0.05 indicating statistical significance. To correct for multiple comparisons, the
q-value method for False Discovery Rate was used at a cutoff q ≤ 0.233.
The outcomes of all in vitro work presented have been replicated at least twice
and all attempts at replication were successful. For in vivo studies, outcomes have
been replicated using alternative experimental models as presented here (i.e. GIPstimulated fatty acid uptake in acute study, chronic study, and in both GiprβCell−/−
and GiprAdipo−/−). Studies using the LA-Agonist have not been replicated more
than once because material availability is extremely limited due to cost and degree
of difficulty for synthesis. Studies utilizing GiprAdipo−/− mice have been replicated
at least twice and all attempts at replication were successful.
