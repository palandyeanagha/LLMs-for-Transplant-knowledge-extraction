Abstract Over the past decade, atypical hemolytic uremic
syndrome (aHUS) has been demonstrated to be a disorder
of the regulation of the complement alternative pathway.
Among approximately 200 children with the disease,
reported in the literature, 50% had mutations of the
complement regulatory proteins factor H, membrane cofactor protein (MCP) or factor I. Mutations in factor B and C3
have also been reported recently. In addition, 10% of
children have factor H dysfunction due to anti-factor H
antibodies. Early age at onset appears as characteristic of
factor H and factor I mutated patients, while MCPassociated HUS is not observed before age 1 year. Low
C3 level may occur in patients with factor H and factor I
mutation, while C3 level is generally normal in MCPmutated patients. Normal plasma factor H and factor I
levels do not preclude the presence of a mutation in these
genes. The worst prognosis is for factor H-mutated patients,
as 60% die or reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within
the first year after onset of the disease. Patients with
mutations in MCP have a relapsing course, but no patient
has ever reached ESRD in the first year of the disease. Half
of the patients with factor I mutations have a rapid
evolution to ESRD, but half recover. Early intensive
plasmatherapy appears to have a beneficial effect, except
in MCP-mutated patients. There is a high risk of graft loss
for HUS recurrence or thrombosis in all groups except the
MCP-mutated group. Recent success of liver–kidney
transplantation combined with plasmatherapy opens this
option for patients with mutations of factors synthesized in
the liver. New therapies such as factor H concentrate or
complement inhibitors offer hope for the future.

Introduction
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by the
triad of hemolytic anemia with fragmented erythrocytes,
thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. The underlying
histological lesion is thrombotic microangiopathy. In
children, the most frequent form (90% of patients), called
typical or post-diarrheal (D+) HUS, is caused by infection
with Shiga-toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
[1]. It occurs mainly in children 6 months to 3 years of age,
and has a relatively favorable outcome, as rapid progression
to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) is exceptional and 75% of
patients make long-term full recovery [1–3]. The other form,
called atypical HUS (aHUS), (10% of children), occurs at

any age, may be sporadic or familial, and has a poor
prognosis, as approximately 50% of patients progress to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [3].
During the past 10 years, a clear link has been demonstrated
between aHUS and genetic abnormalities in complement
regulatory genes. Several studies have confirmed genetic
predisposition both in familial and sporadic cases, involving
factors implicated in the regulation of the alternative pathway
of the complement system (factor H (CFH) [4–11], CD46 (or
MCP for membrane cofactor protein) [12–14], factor I (CFI)
[15–17], and more recently factor B (CFB) [18] and C3 [19]),
which are implicated in the formation of the alternative C3-
convertase. In addition, acquired cases of aHUS associated
with CFH dysfunction due to anti-CFH autoantibodies have
been identified [20–22].
The aim of this review is to emphasize how progress in
the understanding of the pathophysiology of aHUS has led
to improved care of children with aHUS. This review also
addresses which investigations should be performed,
phenotype–genotype correlations, outcome and treatment.
Any child with aHUS should be thoroughly investigated,
since accurate diagnosis can affect the therapy of aHUS.
HUS due to defective complement regulation
Complement and its regulation
Complement is an efficient and rapidly responsive component of the innate immune system and underlies one of the
main effector mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity.
It has three over-arching physiologic activities: defense
against pyogenic bacterial infection, the bridging of innate
and adaptive immunity, and the production of anaphylatoxins. Complement is activated by three pathways: the
classical pathway, the lectin pathway and the alternative
pathway. These three pathways converge at the point of
cleavage of C3. Although the activation of the classical and
lectin pathways occurs after binding to immune complexes
or microorganisms, respectively, the alternative pathway is
continually activated and generates C3b, which binds
indiscriminately to pathogens and host cells. On a foreign
surface, i.e. a bacterium, C3b binds the CFB, which is then
cleaved by factor D to form the C3 convertase C3bBb,
providing exponential cleavage of C3b, and formation of
C5 convertase and of a lytic membrane attack complex. The
host cells are protected from the formation of C3 convertase
on their surface by soluble and membrane-associated
complement regulatory proteins [23] (Fig. 1) [24].
Mainly synthesized by the liver, CFH is a single-chain
serum glycoprotein of 150 kDa and is the most important
protein in the regulation of the alternative pathway in
serum. CFH inhibits the formation of the alternative C3-
convertase and accelerates its decay. CFH and CD46 serve
as cofactors for the CFI, which is a serine protease. Both
genes encoding CFH and CD46 are localized on the long
arm of chromosome 1 at 1q32, a locus called regulators of
complement activation (RCA) which contains genes encoding different regulatory proteins of complement activation.
These proteins are characterized by the presence of a
modular structure consisting of a tandem array of homologous units of approximately 60 amino acid residues, each
Fig. 1 Complement activation and control. aHUS is a disease
resulting from inefficient protection of the surfaces of the host’s
endothelial cells in the setting of complement activation. (1)
Activation of complement and covalent attachment of complement
C3 to the microbial surfaces. C3b binds CFB, inducing formation of
the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb) and amplification of the C3
cleavage. (2) Protection of self cell surfaces. Regulation of the
cleavage of C3 is critical. Under normal conditions the formation of
C3 convertase is tightly controlled by CFH, MCP, and CFI. (3) In the
case of aHUS, activation is uncontrolled and C3 convertase is formed,
resulting in formation of inflammatory mediators. CFH does not attach
to surfaces through its heparin/anionic-binding sites, and, thus, CFB
binds C3b. Degradation of C3b to iC3b is defective in the absence of
CFI and its cofactors (CFH and MCP) (from [24], with permission of
the authors and Wiley–Blackwell Publishing)
1958 Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:1957–1972

called a short consensus repeat (SCR), and by their capacity
to bind C3b, or C3 cleavage fragments.
aHUS is associated with mutations in complement
regulatory proteins
Presently, approximately 50% of aHUS patients have been
demonstrated to have mutations in the genes of complement
components and regulators (CFH, CFB, CFI, MCP and C3)
and 10% of childhood cases to have CFH autoantibodies,
highly suggesting that impaired control of the activity of the
complement amplification convertase C3bBb is the predominant factor predisposing individuals to the disease.
The year 2007 saw publication of a report on a transgenic
mouse model that spontaneously develops HUS, resulting
from CFH knock out (CFH −/− mice develop membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis but not HUS) with knock
in of a modified CFH that carries a deletion in SCR 16–20
[25]. In this mouse model, CFH regulates C3 activation in
the plasma but fails to bind to endothelial cells, similar to
mutated CFH of aHUS patients, thus highlighting the
dissociation of CFH metabolism and action in the plasma
and on the cell surface.
CFH
Since the report by Thompson and Winterborn [26], several
observations of complete or partial quantitative CFH
deficiencies have been reported in aHUS patients, all with
low serum C3 levels and normal C4 levels [27]. In 1998,
Warwicker et al. reported linkage of aHUS to a locus within
the RCA gene cluster containing the CFH gene, by genetic
study of three large kindreds exhibiting no evidence of
quantitative CFH deficiency and normal C3 levels [11].
They also found, in one of the families, a heterozygous
nucleotide substitution leading to the change of an amino
acid in the SCR 20. Additional genetic studies have also
found several different heterozygous missense mutations
within SCR 16 to 20 [8, 9]. At present, over 100 distinct
CFH mutations have been reported in aHUS patients [28].
All reported mutations were heterozygous, except in 15
patients (mostly from consanguineous families) with homozygous CFH deficiency (review in [29]). The majority of
mutations published up to now are located within the Cterminal domain of the protein, particularly in SCR 20. This
induces a reduced ability of CFH to bind to surface-bound
C3b and to the polyanions of the endothelial cells and, thus,
impairs the function of the CFH protein without modifying
its plasma level [7, 30]. As the majority of mutations are
heterozygous, it appears that 50% of normal CFH is not
sufficient to counteract the dysfunction of the mutated
CFH. A hybrid CFH-CFH R1 gene, due to either gene
conversion [31] or non-homologous recombination between
CFH and the gene of CFH-R1, has similar functional
consequences [10]. Fewer than 30% of mutations have been
associated with a quantitative CFH deficiency as defined by
antigenic plasma levels below half of normal [6].
However, the concentration of CFH and the distribution
of the molecular defect are more heterogeneous among
pediatric patients. The results of CFH mutations in two
independent cohorts of patients with pediatric onset aHUS,
one from Italy (111 patients, 77 pedigrees) [32], and one
from France (46 patients, 41 pedigrees) [33], are shown in
Fig. 2. While 71% of CFH mutations were located in the
exons encoding the SCR 18 to 20 in the Italian cohort, only
30% were located in SCR 20 in the French cohort, with
another 30% in SCR 15 and other mutations scattered over
the CFH gene. In addition, 70% of patients with CFH
mutation in the French cohort presented with quantitative
CFH deficiency [33], as opposed with approximately 20%
in the Italian cohort [32]. When the two cohorts were mixed
(Fig. 3), C3 levels were within the normal range in
approximately 70% of patients. These data indicate that
sequencing of CFH gene cannot be limited to SCR 18 to 20

in children with aHUS and that normal CFH and C3 level
do not exclude a mutation in the CFH gene.
It is interesting to note that some mutations have been
reported repeatedly in different studies [28]. All of them are
located in the SCR20. For instance, the mutation
Arg1210Cys has been reported in several unrelated aHUS
patients from distinct geographic origins and with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes [34].
In addition to mutations in complement regulators, CFH
autoantibodies leading to an acquired CFH functional
deficiency have been reported in aHUS patients [20–22].
The binding epitopes of the autoantibodies were localized
to the C-terminal recognition region of CFH, which
represents a hot spot for aHUS mutations.
MCP (CD46)
MCP is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein
that regulates complement activation by serving as a
membrane-bound cofactor for the plasma serine protease
CFI to cleave C3b (Fig. 1). Richards et al. have identified
for the first time functionally significant MCP mutations in
seven patients (three pedigrees) presenting a familial aHUS
with a recessive form of inheritance [14]. More than 20
different mutations in MCP have now been identified in
patients with aHUS [12, 13, 28]. Figure 4 shows the
mutations identified in the Italian and French pediatric
cohorts. Over 80% of the reported mutations caused a
reduction in MCP expression, due to homozygous, compound heterozygous or heterozygous mutations. This
deficiency of MCP leads to inadequate control of complement activation on endothelial cells after an initiating injury
(Fig. 1). As indicated in Fig. 3, C3 levels in MCP-mutated
patients were normal in the French cohort. Nevertheless,
lower-than-normal C3 levels were observed in approximately one-third of Italian childhood (3/8) patients [32].

function is unclear. It down regulates the alternative
complement pathway by cleaving the alpha chain of C3b
in the presence of cofactor proteins (i.e. CFH and MCP).
Fewer than 20 mutations in CFI have been reported in
patients with aHUS, all heterozygous [28] (Fig. 5), and CFI
mutations appear to be a less common cause of aHUS
(between 5% and 10%) than are CFH and MCP mutations
[15, 16, 32, 33]. CFI and C3 levels are most often normal
[32, 33] (Fig. 3). However, the majority of CFI mutations
induce a lack of protein synthesis, and only few mutations
have been associated with a functional deficiency [17].
Recent identification of two new susceptibility factors,
and the frequency of combined mutations
New complement genes associated with aHUS have
recently been described. Goicoechea de Jorge et al. found
a gain-of-function mutation (which increases C3bBb convertase stability) in CFB, associated with aHUS [18]. CFBmutated patients exhibit permanent activation of the
alternative pathway with low C3, while CFB plasma levels
are normal. Mutations in CFB are rare, accounting for 0%
to 3% of aHUS patients [28]. Approximately 10% of aHUS
patients, without a mutation in CFH, IF, MCP or CFB, are
found to have decreased serum levels of C3. Our group
therefore sequenced C3 coding exons in 30 such individuals from two independent cohorts (Newcastle and Paris)
and identified ten heterozygous C3 mutations [19].
It is important to note that at least 10% of patients have
combined mutations, especially of CFI mutation with either
CFH or MCP [32] or CFB or C3 (unpublished data from
the French Pediatric Registry).
In summary, aHUS is a disease where impairment of
alternative pathway regulation leads to the excessive liberation of different cleavage fragments of C3, such as C3a and
C5a, and to the formation of the C5b9 complex. These three
components generate endothelial damage and microangiopathic lesions [35–38].
Current diagnostic approach
In practice, in 2008, patients suspected of having aHUS are
screened by the measurement of plasma complement C3,
C4, CFH, CFI and CFB antigenic levels, membrane
expression of MCP (CD46) in blood leukocytes, by the
detection of CFH autoantibodies (Table 1) and by the
genetic testing of at least the three now well-known
susceptibility genes (CFH, CFI, and MCP) (Table 2).
Plasma levels of the complement proteins and MCP
expression according to mutation or the presence of antiCFH autoantibodies are summarized in Table 3. Four
considerations are important: (1) Assessment of plasma
levels of complement proteins is insufficient, and genetic
analyses are necessary for any patient with aHUS. (2) As
mutations have been identified everywhere in the three
genes, it is prudent for one to screen all exons of the genes,
including CFH. (3) Since at least 10% of patients have
mutations in two complement regulators, screening should
be done to seek out mutations in all known predisposing
genes. (4) The functional consequences of each genetic
abnormality should be determined in vitro by mutagenesis.
Our genetic screening strategy is more exhaustive than that
recommended by Kavanagh et al. for adults [39], as we
consider that all genes must be thoroughly screened in
children, especially before transplantation.
Although investigation guidelines are out of the scope of
this article, we point out that determination of the activity
of ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with
thrombospondin motifs) 13 and screening for defective
cobalamine metabolism are also mandatory in any child
with aHUS [1, 3, 40]. The list of laboratories providing
specialized investigations of the complement system and
ADAMTS 13 is available at http://espn.cardiff.ac.uk.
Clinical characteristics of aHUS associated with genetic
anomalies of complement proteins
In recent years, data from registries [32, 33, 41] and
individual centers have allowed the analysis of clinical
characteristics of aHUS in children according to the
identified risk factors.
Familial/sporadic aHUS, intrafamilial penetrance
and genetic variability
Gender ratio is equilibrated in aHUS of pediatric onset [33].
The incidence of familial aHUS was 25% in the French
Pediatric Registry [33] and 37% in the Italian Registry,

which includes that in both children and adults [32]. The
frequency of familial HUS is similar in the groups with
CFH, MCP and CFI mutations and in the group with no
mutation. Most frequently in familial aHUS, the disease
occurs in siblings. However, in several families, the disease
occurred in several different generations (Fig. 6). The
absence of familial history of HUS does not preclude the
possibility of a genetic transmission of the disease.
Penetrance of HUS associated with complement mutations has been shown to be approximately 50%. Only half
of the family members who carry the mutation manifest the
disease [38, 42, 43]. It has been suggested that polymorphisms of CFH and MCP influence the predisposition
of an individual to aHUS and provide an explanation for
the incomplete penetrance of the disease within families. In
some families, it appeared that the proband had inherited
the complement mutation from one parent and an allele
carrying the polymorphism of CFH and/or MCP from the
other parent, while the healthy mutation carriers did not
inherit the aHUS-associated CFH and MCP polymorphisms
[5, 34, 38, 42–44]. Another polymorphic variant of CFHrelated genes (deletion of CFH-R3 and R1) has been shown
to be more frequent in aHUS patients than in controls [45].
In practice, it is impossible for one to forecast the risk of
occurrence of HUS in family members presenting the
mutation. Another problem is that several mutations may
be present in one family, while some mutations are
unknown. For example, in two families from the French
Pediatric Registry, one child with aHUS had CFH or CFI +
C3 mutations, respectively, while a sibling also with aHUS
had no mutation ([33] and unpublished data). This shows
that other unidentified genetic risk factors may be present in
the patient and in healthy family members.
Age at onset
In the French pediatric cohort, patients harboring CFH or
CFI mutations were markedly younger at disease onset
(median age 6 months and 2 months, respectively) than
patients with MCP mutation (median age 4 years 6 months)
[33]. Noticeably, in the literature, the onset of the disease
did not occur in any of the patients with MCP mutations

before they were 1 year of age, except for one patient
(patient 6 in [12], who probably had another mutation in
addition to MCP mutation). Patients with no mutation in
CFH, MCP or CFI may manifest HUS at any age (from
25 days to 15 years) [33]. In practice, onset before 3 months
of age is highly suggestive of CFH or IF mutation.
Triggering events
Another interesting point is the high frequency of an
infectious triggering event. In the French and Italian
pediatric cohorts, HUS onset followed an upper respiratory
tract infection, fever, or diarrhea in 63% and 85% of
patients from all subgroups, respectively. Interestingly,
diarrhea preceded HUS in 13 (28%) patients from all
subgroups, including 0157:H7 E. coli-associated bloody
diarrhea in one child with an MCP mutation [33]. MCP
mutation could be a risk factor of STEC-induced HUS, and
possibly of severe forms, as a 4-year-old patient with an
MCP mutation died from multi-visceral involvement after
Stx-HUS [46]. Another observation, of an adult patient with
CFH mutation and severe D+ HUS, has also been reported
[47]. These observations show that the D+ or D−
classification of HUS may be misleading, and that postdiarrheal onset does not exclude the possibility of genetic
aHUS.
Clinical course and outcome
The overall prognosis of aHUS in these genotyped cohorts
is poor. Among the French pediatric cohort, four (8.6%) of
the 46 children died and 11 (24%) developed ESRD after
the first episode. Age at onset, familial or sporadic
occurrence of HUS and C3 level were not predictive of
outcome, while serum creatinine level at first flare was
significantly associated with the outcome at 1 year [33].
Relapsing HUS may occur whatever the genotype as well
as in patients with no identified mutations. However, the
number of relapses is significantly more important in the
MCP-mutated and in the non-mutated groups. Some of
these patients have severe hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia during HUS episodes, with acute renal failure

mostly due to hemoglobinuria (unpublished data from the
French Pediatric Registry). Relapses with complete recovery is characteristic of patients with MCP mutations and
some patients with no identified mutation. Extrarenal
involvement during HUS episodes (ischemic manifestations
in the central nervous system, multi-visceral manifestations
of thrombotic microangiopathy) is not frequent (fewer than
10% in pediatric onset aHUS [33]). However, some
observations suggest that complement dysregulation may
be responsible for atheroma-like vascular complications. A
child with a CFH mutation had an ophthalmologic
ischemic/hemorrhagic complication after 3 years on dialysis
[48], and a 10-year-old child with a mutation in CFB
developed diffuse arterial stenosis, affecting cerebral,
carotid, coronary and distal pulmonary arteries, celiac trunk
and splenic artery (unpublished data from a patient in the
French pediatric cohort).
The worst prognosis is in patients with CFH mutations.
Among French children, 60% of those with CFH mutation
had either died or had ESRD by 1 year after onset
(including 40% by as soon as the first episode) in
comparison with 50% of the CFI-mutated patients, 0% of
the MCP-mutated patients and 32% in the unexplained
group. At 5 years after onset, the percentage of patients
with ESRD was 73%, 50%, 38% and 32% in the CFH,
CFI, MCP and unexplained groups, respectively [33].
Similar data were derived from the Italian cohort of
pediatric patients, with, respectively, 68%, 67%, 10% and
28% of patients developing ESRD in the long term [32]. It
therefore appears that patients with CFH mutation are at the
highest risk for developing ESRD very early during the
course of the disease, while patients with CFI mutation and
patients with no mutation either develop ESRD during the
year of onset (50% and 30% risk, respectively) or will do
well during subsequent years, some of them (mainly
unexplained aHUS) with a relapsing course but preserved
renal function. MCP-mutated patients have a different
course: renal function is generally preserved in the first
year(s) of the disease, but approximately 30% of patients
will reach ESRD after a relapsing course over several years
[33].
In practice, it is clearly helpful for us to know which
complement mutation each individual patient has, so that
the outcome may be predicted and adequate therapeutic
decisions made.
aHUS associated with anti-CFH antibodies
The subgroup of aHUS associated with anti-CFH autoantibodies accounted for 6% of aHUS in the French pediatric
cohort [20] to 11% in the German cohort, including adults
and children [21, 22]. Clinical symptoms are not specific,
except that the disease usually presents when the child is
between 3 years and 14 years of age. C3 level is generally
slightly decreased, and CFH level in usually normal [20]
(Table 3). Interestingly, most patients with anti-CFH antibodies are homozygous for deletion of the CFHR1 and
CFHR3 genes [22]. Consideration of the therapeutic
implications (plasma exchanges, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive treatment), screening for anti-CFH antibodies in any child with aHUS, is mandatory.
Treatment
Plasmatherapy
There are many reports on plasmatherapy in aHUS, but
there are no controlled trials. These plasma-based therapies,
although evidence is lacking, remain the mainstay of
treatment for aHUS [49]. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
replaces defective CFH, CFI, CFB and C3. Plasma
exchange (PE) removes mutated CFH, CFI, CFB and C3,
anti-CFH antibodies and other triggers of endothelial
dysfunction, while restitution with FFP restores the functional proteins. In addition, PE prevents volume overload
and cardiac failure when large amounts of FFP are infused.
Logically, the few patients with a complete quantitative
deficiency of a complement protein such as CFH might do
well simply with FFP infusions that provide the normal
protein. However, the majority of patients have functional
deficiency of one or several complement proteins. These
mutant proteins are present in the circulating blood but also
on cell surfaces, where they interfere with the protective
function of the normal protein. PE could be necessary to
withdraw these mutant proteins.
Plasmatherapy in patients with CFH mutation
A limited number of case reports suggest that plasmatherapy can be effective to rescue and prevent aHUS flares in
CFH-mutated patients. As indicated in Table 4, four
patients with complete quantitative CFH deficiency benefited from FFP infusions [50–54]. In most of them, treatment
was started when serum creatinine level was normal or only
slightly increased. Another point is that follow-up under
plasmatherapy was only 7 months to 4 years. The patient of
Nathanson et al. was well for 4 years under weekly FFP
infusions [51]. Nevertheless, relapse of HUS when the
patient was aged 8 years was resistant to daily PE [52].
Reports on plasmatherapy in five patients with CFH
functional deficiency suggest that intensive plasmatherapy
might also be beneficial in this situation [55–58] (Table 5). In
a report by Davin et al. [58], two twin sisters were
successfully treated by PE with FFP, 40 ml/kg daily for
1964 Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:1957–1972

10 days, at their first episode of HUS. One twin subsequently
received FFP infusions only during recurrences of thrombocytopenia, but she progressed to ESRD after 4 months. The
other twin was maintained on PE every 2 weeks, which was
intensified to daily PE during two relapses. Serum creatinine
level was normal, and no relapses occurred during 3.6 years of
follow-up, suggesting that PE therapy has benefits over FFP
infusions [58]. Again, follow-up in these five patients was
only 1 year to 3.6 years, and it is not certain if the favorable
effect of plasmatherapy can be maintained for decades.
Plasmatherapy in patients with CFI, MCP or CFB mutation
As MCP is not a circulating protein, a beneficial effect of
plasmatherapy is unlikely to be expected in patients with a
mutation in MCP. Published data indicate that 70–80% of
patients undergo remission from acute episodes, whether or not
they have been treated with plasma [32]. Nevertheless, a
potential benefit of PE during relapses, to clear up noxious
entities such as aggregating factors/cytokines, remains possible.
The results of plasmatherapy in patients with the CFI
and CFB mutations are not well documented [16, 18, 59].
One may suspect that patients with a mutation in CFB need
large amounts of FFP and very frequent PE to overcome the
overproduction and resistance to decay of the alternative
pathway C3 convertase induced by the gain-of-function
CFB mutation. On the other hand, one could also speculate
that supplementation in C3 might, in fact, be deleterious by
bringing substrate to the unregulated activation of the
complement cascade.

Plasmatherapy in practice: when to start? How much?
How frequently? How long?
Recommendations can only be empirical. Recent guidelines
from the European Paediatric Study Group for HUS [40]
recommend that plasmatherapy be started as early as possible,
within 24 h of presentation, in parallel with conservative
treatment (dialysis, transfusion, antihypertensive treatment
etc.). First line treatment should be PE, with exchange of 1.5
plasma volume (60–75 ml/kg) per session, replaced by FFP.
When PE cannot be performed within 24 h of presentation,
plasma infusions of 10–20 ml/kg should be given if the
patient is not volume overloaded and/or hypertensive. PE
should be daily for 5 days, then five times a week for 2 weeks
and then three times a week for 2 weeks [40]. Further
frequency of PE would be predicted on an individual basis.
Prevention of infections, and vaccinations
Considering the frequency of relapses triggered by infections, eradication of adenoidal, tonsil and dental infections
is warranted. It is also justifiable that preventive plasmatherapy be intensified during infections (or at least
biological monitoring be intensified). A triggering effect
from vaccinations is possible, although rarely documented.
Probably, the beneficial effect of vaccination outweighs its
risk, as in other immunity diseases. The few patients with
permanent activation of the complement alternative pathway and very low C3 levels (patients with CFB mutation or
homozygous or compound heterozygous CFH mutations)
have to be considered as immunodeficient. These patients
must receive permanent preventive antibiotic therapy
(penicillin or macrolides in case of allergy to B-lactamines)
as well as vaccination against Neisseria meningitis and
Streptococcus pneumoniae [29].
Future treatments
CFH concentrate
A human plasma-derived CFH concentrate is being
developed by the Laboratoire Français du Fractionnement
et des Biotechnologies, and it received the European orphan
drug designation in January 2007. This will be an easier
option for patients with CFH mutation, although the
respective place of PE and CFH substitution will have to
be carefully thought about in patients with a functional
CFH deficiency.
Complement inhibitors
Monoclonal humanized antibodies against key activating
components of complement such as C5 should be beneficial, by decreasing the damage mediated by the anaphylatoxin C5a and preventing the formation of the membrane
attack complex on cell surfaces. Prevention of C5 activation
has been shown to ameliorate glomerulonephritis in CFH −/−
mice [60]. The long-term efficacy and tolerance of the antiC5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab has been demonstrated
in large cohorts of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria [61, 62].
Treatment of patients with anti-CFH antibodies
PE, logically, should be considered as first line treatment
for patients with anti-CFH antibodies. Steroids and various
immunosuppressive treatments, including rituximab, all
tried empirically, should be administered to prevent the
production of antibodies after PE cessation [20, 21, 63].
Transplantation
Post-transplantation recurrence of HUS and thrombosis
The post-transplantation course has been analyzed in
approximately 80 patients with aHUS screened for CFH,
CFI and MCP mutations, including children [33] or both
pediatric and adult onset aHUS [32, 64]. In the French
pediatric series, of the 24 renal transplantations performed
in 15 aHUS children, 16 (67%) failed. Of the 16 graft
failures, eight (50%) were due to graft vascular thrombosis
and five (31%) to recurrence of HUS [33]. The high
proportion of vascular thrombosis was most likely related
to the thrombogenic role of complement dysregulation.
A recent review of the literature indicated that, out
of 34 patients with CFH mutations, 26 (76%) had posttransplantation recurrence, and 21 of those (81%) lost the
graft within a year after recurrence [24]. Of eight patients
with CFI mutations, seven (88%) had recurrence, and all
lost their grafts due to recurrence within the year. On the
other hand, as non-mutated MCP is brought by the graft, no
post-transplantation recurrence is expected to occur in MCPmutated patients. Nevertheless, two of ten MCP-mutated
patients had post-transplantation recurrence. One of them
most probably had another complement anomaly, suggested
by biological signs of complement activation [12]. In the
other patient, endothelial microchimerism was suggested by
the colonization of the graft endothelia by the recipient’s
cells [65]. The risk of recurrence in CFB- and C3-mutated
patients is not well documented. The risk of recurrence in
patients with no CFH, CFI or MCP mutation is 30% [24].
Finally, the risk of recurrence in patients with anti-CFH
antibodies may be expected to be important if a high titer of
antibodies persists at the time of transplantation.

Kidney donation by living related donors is contraindicated
Considering the risk of graft loss due to recurrence, livingrelated kidney donation must be considered as contraindicated for patients with CFH, CFI, CFB and C3
mutation and questionable for patients with unexplained
aHUS. Living related kidney donation is debatable for
patients with MCP mutation. In addition, the risk that the
donor might develop HUS after kidney donation has to be
taken into account. This has been reported in four donors
aged 21–31 years, who had HUS 3 weeks to 10 months
after donation [24, 66]. CFH mutation was subsequently
demonstrated in one of the recipients and his donor.
Considering the incomplete penetrance of the disease, the
role of complement gene polymorphisms and the genetic
variability within members of a single family, it is
impossible to reach a 100% certitude of “no risk” for
living related donors. As indicated above, among siblings
with aHUS, it may be that some have mutations in the
complement system, while some have no mutation identified, which indicates that other unidentified risk factors are
present in the family, including the potential donor.
Can post-transplantation aHUS recurrence be prevented?
Bilateral nephrectomy of native kidneys is often performed
before transplantation because of severe hypertension or
ongoing hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. Unfortunately, it
does not appear to reduce the risk of recurrence of aHUS after
transplantation [24]. Avoidance of calcineurin inhibitors also
is not associated with a reduced incidence of HUS recurrence.
Plasmatherapy
Many genotyped patients of historical series have received
some form of plasmatherapy at the time of recurrence [33,
64]. As time at plasmatherapy initiation, modalities (PE or
FFP infusions), volume of FFP infused or exchanged,
frequency and duration were highly variable, the effect of
treatment is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, the efficiency of intensive prophylactic plasmatherapy started
before renal transplantation seems to have been demonstrated in one family [58, 67]. Three children of this family
had aHUS with CFH heterozygous S1191L mutation,
SCR20. The eldest child lost two grafts due to recurrent
HUS. One of the identical twins had preserved renal
function with prophylactic PE therapy (see above). The
second twin had renal transplantation with PE performed
just before surgery and maintained after surgery, 40 ml/kg
FFP, daily for 7 days, then every 2 weeks. There were two
recurrences of HUS during cytomegalovirus infection,
which were efficiently treated by daily PE. Weekly PE
was maintained subsequently, and serum creatinine was
120 µmol/l 5 years 8 months after transplantation ([67], and
personal communication J.C. Davin, 2008).
Three patients with CFI mutations lost their grafts,
despite having PE, but none of them was treated prophylactically [16, 59].
Combined liver and kidney transplantation
As CFH is synthesized in the liver, liver transplantation has
been proposed for patients with severe forms of HUS and
CFH mutation. The first three combined liver–kidney [2]
and auxiliary liver [1] transplantations were disappointing,
as one child had severe neurologic sequelae [68] and two
children died [69, 70] (Table 6). In one child who died from
primary liver non-function, diffuse hepatic thrombotic and
ischemic lesions were observed, most likely due to the
thrombogenic effect of complement activation products
deposited on liver vessels after transplantation [70]. These
initial experiences suggested that liver transplantation,
known to trigger complement activation, ought to be
performed under intensive plasmatherapy, to correct the
complement dysregulation before and during the operative
period. The first successful combined liver and kidney
transplantation in Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA,
was reported in 2006 by Saland et al. [71] in a 5.6-year-old
child who had lost a first kidney graft due to recurrence and
had received one PE with FFP just before surgery and FFP
infusion during surgery; plasma therapy was stopped
thereafter. Enoxaparin and aspirin were administrated
post-operatively. There was no HUS recurrence, and both
grafts had excellent function at a 4 year follow-up
examination ([71], and personal communication J. Saland,
2008). Another child in New York and two children in
Helsinki [72] have undergone combined liver and kidney
transplantation with similar protocols, with no recurrence of
HUS and excellent function of both grafts during 8 months
to 1.5 years of follow-up (Table 6).
In summary, combined liver–kidney transplantation covered by intensive peri-transplant plasmatherapy started
before the operation now appears as a reasonable therapeutic
option for patients with mutations in CFH and, possibly, for
patients with mutations in another factor synthesized in the
liver, CFI. The possibility to extend the procedure to patients
with CFB and C3 mutation is complicated by the not
negligible extrahepatic synthesis of these compounds.
Nevertheless, the decision between kidney transplantation
(with pre- and peri-operative plasmatherapy, subsequently
maintained life-long) and combined liver and kidney
transplantation (with pre- and intra-operative plasmatherapy)
has to be taken on an individual basis. The choice of
combined transplantation is logical if the patient or a family
member with the same mutation has lost a graft due to
recurrence. In all other situations, careful evaluation of the
Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:1957–1972 1967

potential risks and benefits is needed. In particular, the
decision of liver transplantation in patients with a CFH
mutation and preserved renal function is difficult. The
alternative of CFH concentrate infusions or anti-C5 monoclonal antibodies might be an easier option in the future.
Conclusion and recommendations in 2008
1. Determination of C3, CFH, CFI and CFB levels,
expression of MCP and screening for anti-CFH antibodies is indicated for all patients with aHUS. Normal
C3 level does not eliminate the presence of CFH or
CFI mutation or of anti-CFH antibodies.
2. Genotyping of CFH, CFI and MCP, and if possible
CFB and C3, is indicated for all patients with aHUS,
even if plasma levels are normal.
3. The identified mutation has to be regarded as a risk
factor for HUS, not as the direct cause. The association
of mutations in several genes is not exceptional.
Penetrance of the disease is 50% in patients with a
mutation in complement. Therefore, the risk of developing HUS is difficult to predict in family members
with the mutation.
Intrafamilial genetic heterogeneity exists, suggesting
that unknown genetic factors are present.
4. A post-diarrheal onset of HUS can be observed in all
groups. Therefore, genotyping must be performed for
patients with uncertain diagnosis of D + /STEC + HUS,
especially before transplantation.
The worst prognosis is in patients with CFH
mutation, who are at high risk of ESRD as soon as at
first flare or within the year of onset.
5. Plasmatherapy (PE with FFP) should be started as early
as possible. Although evidence is lacking, benefit is
expected mainly in CFH-mutated patients and in patients
with anti-CFH antibodies. Benefit is likely in all other
subgroups of aHUS, except the MCP subgroup, where
spontaneous remission generally occurs.
6. The risk of graft loss due to HUS recurrence or graft
thrombosis is high in patients with CFH and CFI mutations, while it is very low in patients with MCP mutations.
Family living donor transplantation is contraindicated,
because of the risk of graft loss due to recurrence and the
risk that donors themselves might have HUS after
donation, due to unknown genetic factors shared with
the recipient.
Kidney transplantation under pre-, intra- and postoperative intensive plasmatherapy may be successful in
some patients.

considered on an individual basis for patients with
mutations in other factors synthesized in the liver.

prevent ESRD, such as CFH concentrate or anti-C5
monoclonal antibodies.
