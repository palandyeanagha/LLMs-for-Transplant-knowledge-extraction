High hepatitis E (HEV) seroprevalence has been reported in the general population and in post-liver 
transplant (LT) cases in several regions, including Thailand, with genotype 3 being a predominant 
genotype. We hypothesized that HEV might persist at a subclinical level and might pose clinical risks in 
the post-LT period. We performed a cross-sectional study with 108 post-LT patients and found an IgG 
seroprevalence of 55.6%. Subsequently, 91 cases without clinical evidence of HEV-related hepatitis 
were enrolled in 1 year of prospective follow-up to determine clinical status, serologies and serum/feces 
HEV RNA every 4 months. HEV RNA was detected, indicating subclinical infections in patients with 
or without seropositivity, with an annual incidence of 7.7%. Our results suggest that subclinical HEV 
infection exists among LT patients in this high-prevalence area. Thus, clinicians should be aware of the 
possibility of disease reemergence and HEV viral transmission in LT patients.
It has been a decade since the emergence of evidence of the ability of hepatitis E virus (HEV) to cause chronic 
hepatitis and cirrhosis in immunocompromised hosts, including HIV and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, 
and especially in liver transplant (LT) recipients1,2
. Of the four genotypes of HEV causing hepatitis in humans, 
genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, causing endemic outbreaks and acute self-limited 
hepatitis of varying severity, and are common in tropical and non-industrialized countries, such as India and 
Pakistan3
. Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, with pigs, wild boar and other animals serving as their intermediate 
hosts and are transmitted through uncooked meat3
.
HEV genotype 3 is the specifc genotype causing chronic hepatitis, with a rare report of genotype 43,4
. It is commonly found and reported to cause chronic infection in SOT patients in several regions of Europe. Interestingly, 
Tailand has genotype 3 as a common genotype, unlike other neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, India 
and China5
. Tis gives unique insight into the hidden problems in SOT recipients that have never been explored. 
Te prevalence of positive HEV IgG antibodies in blood donors varies among the areas from 8.9–37.3% in the 
Tai population, which is quite high compared to 2–16% in some low-prevalence areas in developed countries 
in Europe6–9
.
Te HEV IgG seroprevalence in SOT and LT recipients has been reported in several studies in Europe and 
North America, varying from 3–28%, with a serum RNA detection rate of 0–2%, and the incidence of chronic 
hepatitis E is up to 3%10. Te positivity of HEV serology in this setting depends on the immunosuppressive status 
of the patients and the detection ability of the commercial tests11,12. Terefore, the diagnosis of the disease relies 
upon the detection of HEV RNA in the serum or stool3
.
Te signifcance of HEV infection and the clinical course of the disease in SOT patients are debated. Te 
variations in HEV seroprevalence and the incidence of active disease in diferent countries lead to diferent conclusions regarding the clinical signifcance and give rise to diferent views of the practical implications13,14. Te

clinical studies of HEV in SOT recipients thus far have addressed the problem of HEV from the perspective of a 
series of selected case reports, cross-sectional studies and retrospective cohorts10. Without a prospective study, 
it is challenging to determine the extent of the problem of diseases associated with HEV genotype 3 in the SOT 
population, whether the patients with IgG positivity can clear the virus, whether the patients without IgG seropositivity remain at risk without specifc RNA testing, and what are the clinical courses of the patients who are 
positive for HEV RNA. To clarify some of the above issues, we conducted a clinical study in post-LT patients to 
determine the seroprevalence. Subsequently, the patients were prospectively followed for 12 months, and the 
clinical changes, liver function tests, serum HEV serology and RNA, and stool HEV RNA were assessed.
Results
Of the 108 post-LT patients evaluated for HEV seroprevalence, 60 (55.6%) were seropositive [HEV IgG (+)], 
and 48 (44.4%) were seronegative [HEV IgG (−)] (Fig. 1). Seventeen patients were excluded before entering the 
follow-up study. Tree patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with HEV-related acute or chronic hepatitis. One patient 
with chronic hepatitis E, identifed as being caused by HEV genotype 3, was on the second month of treatment, 
and the other had previously been treated with ribavirin. A patient was diagnosed with acute hepatitis E and 
started the treatment at 10 weeks post-LT. Te other 14 patients included a patient who died a few months later 
from severe sepsis, a patient who had recurrent hepatoma, and 12 who were unable to undergo regular follow-up 
Figure 1. Flow diagram for patient recruitment and hepatitis E RNA assessment. Post-liver transplant patients 
were screened for serum hepatitis E IgG. Afer recruitment, all patients were assessed and followed-up every 4 
months for 12 months. All serum and fecal samples were collected per the protocol and assessed for HEV RNA 
at the end of the study using a commercial real-time RT PCR kit, COBAS HEV. If the test result was invalid, 
the sample was subsequently tested in-house by real-time RT-PCR. Te numbers of invalid samples, positive 
samples and patients in each step are shown.

visits. Ninety-one patients were recruited for the follow-up period. Of these, forty-eight patients (52.7%) were 
HEV IgG (+).
Te baseline characteristics of the HEV IgG (+) and HEV IgG (−) groups are shown in Table 1. Te two 
groups were not diferent in age, sex or time of recruitment. Tirteen patients (14.3%) had a previous history of 
ACR requiring steroid pulse therapy before enrollment. Tere was no signifcant diference between the groups. 
Te overall prevalence of diabetes in this study was 49.5%. Tere was no diference in the proportion of patients 
with diabetes between the groups.
The results of liver function tests were generally within the normal ranges, with some mild elevation of 
transaminase levels, and no diferences between the groups. Te MELD-Na score ranged from 6–40. Te calculation is based on the UNOS.org allocation calculator. Te median MELD-Na score at the time of enrollment in 
the current study was slightly elevated, at a score of 7. In addition, in some cases, the scores were as high as 10–15 
(dataset). Tese high levels stem from the increased creatine levels due to the efect of calcineurin inhibitors and 
were not related to liver disease.
A comparison of immunosuppressive drug use between the two groups showed that the seropositive group 
used slightly higher doses of mycophenolate mofetil (631±272 vs. seronegative group: 557±254 mg) and tacrolimus (2.5±1.6 vs. seronegative group: 1.6±0.9 mg), but the diference was statistically signifcant only for 
tacrolimus (p=0.009). None of the immunosuppressive drug levels were signifcantly diferent between the two 
groups (Table 1).
Twenty-three patients received ribavirin during the treatment of post-LT recurrent hepatitis C. Tirteen 
patients had received pegylated interferon/ribavirin a few years before starting the study, and 10 patients had 
12-week courses of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin during the study period. Tere was no signifcant diference 
between the groups in the proportion of patients who had received ribavirin for hepatitis C (Table 1).
All four cases of ACLF were caused by a severe hepatitis B fare-up with a high HBV viral load. Te explanted 
livers showed evidence compatible with severe hepatitis and evidence of HBsAg. Hepatitis E serology was examined in only one case, with negative results. Tis patient was later HEV IgG positive at the time of enrollment. Te 
other patients were not tested for hepatitis E infection before transplantation (Supplementary Table 1).

HEV RNA detection. Overall, 711 samples (serum 358 and feces 353) were initially tested for HEV RNA 
using commercial automated real-time RT-PCR and COBAS HEV (Fig. 1). Te results showed 5 positive samples 
(serum 4 and feces 1) from 5 patients. One hundred seventeen samples showed invalid results. Tese included 
17/358 (4.75%) serum samples and 100/353 (28.32%) feces samples. Subsequent in-house real-time RT-PCR of 
the 117 invalid samples showed 4 positive samples (serum 1 and feces 3) from 4 patients. When combining the 
results of the two methods, 7 patients had HEV RNA detected during the 12-month study period. Of these, HEV 
RNA was detected in the serum in 4 patients, in the feces in 2 patients, and in both the serum and the feces in 1 
patient. Overall, HEV RNA was detected in 7 patients (7/91, 7.7%) in both the HEV IgG (+) and IgG (−) groups.
HEV RNA detection in the HEV IgG (+) and IgG (−) groups. In the HEV IgG (+) group, HEV RNA 
was detected in the serum at the baseline in 2 patients (a, b) and in the feces at the 4th and 8th months in one 
patient (c), which could be considered chronic infections. Overall, RNA was detected in 3 patients in this group 
(3/48, 6.25%) (Table 2).
In the HEV IgG (−) group, HEV RNA was detected in the serum at the baseline in 1 patient (d) and 2 patient 
(e, f) at the 12th month and in the feces at the baseline in 1 patient (g) and at the 8th month in 1 patient (d). In the 
latter case (d), HEV was detected two times, 8 months apart, which could be considered either a chronic infection 
or separate episodes of acute infection (Table 2). Overall, RNA was detected in 4 patients in this group (4/43, 
9.3%)
Changes in HEV serology during the follow-up period. In the HEV IgG (+) group, there was a patient 
who was positive for HEV IgM at the baseline (42 months afer LT) without any RNA detected, but subsequent 
follow-up tests showed negative HEV IgM results. Tere were 2 patients with transient negative results for HEV 
IgG at the 8th month of follow-up who became positive again at the 12th month (Table 2).
In the HEV IgG (−) group, 12 patients (12/43, 27.9%) had transiently positive results for HEV IgG without 
any RNA detected, with 5 patients in the 4th month, 6 patients in the 8th month, and 1 patient in the 12th month 
(Table 2).
Details of HEV RNA-positive cases. Seven patients had detectable HEV RNA in either their serum or 
feces (Table 3). Six patients were asymptomatic with normal transaminase levels. Except for one patient (f), who 
had a mild elevation of ALT in a subsequent follow-up study, the transaminase levels became normal without 
specifc treatment. Te cause of mild transaminitis in this patient was not confrmed; however, non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis or statin-induced hepatitis was suspected. HEV RNA could not be amplifed from the samples for 
genotyping in all patients.
Of the seven patients in whom HEV RNA was detected, two had previous ACR requiring steroid pulse therapy, and one had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with lymphoma. Te latter patient also 
underwent high-dose steroid therapy and chemotherapy and was subsequently cured from the disease approximately 33 months before enrollment.
Efect of immunosuppressive drug levels on HEV RNA detection. Comparing the 7 patients with 
HEV RNA detected and the 84 patients without HEV RNA detected, there were no signifcant diferences in the 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus and sirolimus drug levels (Table 4).
Clinical course of the follow-up patients. During the 12-month follow-up period, there was no evidence 
of or treatment administered for signifcant hepatitis that was caused by hepatitis E.

Discussion
Te results of this post-LT hepatitis E study show high HEV seroprevalences (55.6%) and an active hepatitis rate 
of 2.8%. Further exploration in a prospective follow-up study for 12 months in 91 patients with asymptomatic 
post-LT cases revealed 7 patients (7.7%) with transient subclinical infection or chronic infection in both the HEV 
IgG (+) and HEV IgG (−) groups. As previously noted, the hepatitis E genotype 3 is the predominant genotype 
in Tailand, which is diferent from the other countries in Southeast Asia and the Indian continent15. Te post-LT 
HEV seroprevalence in this study is as high as in some areas in Europe in which chronic hepatitis E and cirrhosis 
in patients who had undergone organ transplantation was discovered16,17. In the Asian region, there is only one 
report of a low post-LT HEV seroprevalence (2.9%) and 2 cases of viral detection with chronic hepatitis (0.12%) 
in Japan13. Te HEV seroprevalence in the Tai general population varies from 10–50% depending on the area, 
culture and age group6
. Te HEV seroprevalence in post-LT patients in our study is quite high compared to that 
in the general Tai population6
. Tis means that over ffy percent of members in this group had been infected 
either before or afer their transplantation. Apart from food contamination, infection via the blood products 
received during the operative period might have contributed to the higher prevalence in this group18. However, 
the higher prevalence might also be partly explained by the high sensitivity of the test used in this study19,20. Te 
high seroprevalence and predominant genotype 3 likely come from the consumption of undercooked pork, which 
is also found in other regions21–23.
Tree patients with HEV-related hepatitis requiring therapy out of 108 post-LT recipients (2.8%) were discovered in our study. If patients with positive viral detection results were included among the asymptomatic patients 
(7/91 patients) during the prospective 1-year follow-up, the prevalence was 9.3% (10/108). Tis makes the rate of 
post-LT infection higher than in other reports, in which it varied from as low as 0.12% in Japan and up to approximately 3% in Europe13,14,24. Tere were two patients with chronic hepatitis E. One of the two patients, identifed 
as being infected with HEV genotype 3, had been misdiagnosed as having steatohepatitis for a few years, and the 
initial HEV serology showed a negative result. Tere was a patient with acute hepatitis E with high transaminase 
levels that were detected in approximately the 8th week post-LT. Tis patient might have been infected by the 
virus via a contaminated blood product administered during the operation. A recent systematic survey in Europe 
and Tailand found that the prevalence of HEV RNA-contaminated blood products vary from 0.2 to 0.69 and 
0.86 per 1000 donations, respectively18,25.
Te serological test results in this study suggest that HEV IgG (+) persisted for the whole period of 12 months, 
but there were some fuctuations of transient negativity in the two patients, possibly due to the degree of immune 
suppression (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). In the patients who were initially HEV IgG negative, 27.9% (12/43) 
had a transient HEV IgG positive result. Te results of the HEV serological tests indicate that, even though the 
test is reliable for prevalence studies, it could not be used for clinical confrmation of the disease in the post-LT 
setting, as suggested by another study26.
Te crucial point of this study was the prospective follow-up to explore the existence of HEV reactivation 
or reinfection (de novo infection), even in patients with HEV IgG (+). Our study demonstrated the existence 
of HEV RNA in the serum or feces of asymptomatic patients. Two of the 7 patients had positivity detected

approximately 4 months apart and could be considered to have chronic infection, according to a previous recommendation27. In this high seroprevalence area, a fgure of 7.7% (7/91 patients) for the annual incidence is a 
reasonable number to suggest the need for clinical vigilance. However, exploring more regarding the clinical 
outcomes, our data suggest silent or subclinical infections were more common than active disease during the 
12-month period. Te results suggest that the infection may exist and persist but that it is not necessarily a clinical 
issue if there no chronic hepatitis or acute hepatitis occurs during the course of clinical care.
Interestingly, a post-LT patient who had a previous HEV infection, whether the patient is HEV IgG (+) or not, 
still has a silent liver infection, which may emerge as a problem in the future. Tis is still inconclusive. Data from 
several animal and human studies have shown that natural HEV IgG develops afer an acute HEV infection as a 
protective antibody against one and several genotypes. Te level of protection depends on the antibody levels and 
wanes with time28,29. Tis partly explains the ability of the virus to cause chronic infection in immunocompromised hosts. Te HEV IgG (+) in this study could be classifed into 2 groups: the frst was generated from a past 
infection before the transplantation during the immunocompetent stage, and the second was generated from a 
post-LT de novo infection. Several strong pieces of evidence from an animal study demonstrated the occult presence of HEV inside the livers of hosts without viremia30. Even so, there are very few reports in humans suggesting 
the possibility of the virus surviving the immune response and becoming reactivated during the immunocompromised stage31,32. Te existence of occult HEV in patients with past HEV infection and its ability to become 
reactivated or to fare when the host is in an immunocompromised state remains a subject of debate.
A 12-month prospective study in Toulouse, France, in which high HEV seroprevalences in the general population (up to 50%) and in post-SOT patients (38%) were reported, explored the signifcant levels of HEV IgG 
needed for the prevention of HEV infection33. Twenty percent of the 263 patients were post-LT, and the rest were 
post-kidney transplantation. Approximately 2–3% of HEV de novo infections in the IgG (−) and reinfections in 
IgG (+) groups were identifed in patients with evidence of hepatitis and were mainly diagnosed by serum RNA 
assays. Te authors suggested that the low titers of HEV IgG failed to protect against de novo infection afer LT 
rather than reactivation from occult HEV. In our 12-month prospective study, in which we found a seroprevalence of 55.6%, afer excluding the patients with active disease, 3 patients (6.3%) in the IgG (+) group and 4 
patients (9.3%) in the IgG (−) group had asymptomatic infections or silent infections. Nearly all patients had 
normal transaminase levels. No patients with active acute or chronic hepatitis were discovered. Te discrepancy 
in the results between these two studies, especially with regard to the clinical outcome of hepatitis, might be 
because our study focused on only post-LT patients, who normally require less immunosuppression. As has been 
previously shown, not only humoral immune responses (HEV IgG) but also T-cell responses are required for the 
prevention of HEV infection or the development of chronic infection34,35. Better immune control in the post-LT 
setting might have resulted in only silent infections in both IgG (+) and IgG (−) patients in our study.
The technique for detecting HEV RNA in clinical samples has developed into a more standardized and 
automated method instead of a variety of in-house assays and a need for optimization with the World Health 
Organization (WHO) international standard HEV strains36. By the time of this study, a commercial kit for HEV 
detection had become available and was widely used as a standard method37. However, it was designed for use 
with serum or plasma samples. Our study yielded invalid results in approximately a quarter of the fecal samples. 
As the test was not developed for this purpose and there is a possibility of some inhibitors of the reactions, we 
decided to use an in-house real-time RT-PCR to confrm the presence of HEV RNA. Te test was previously 
standardized with the WHO’s standard samples and used for the assessment of HEV RNA in blood donors18. 
Using this method, two more patients were identifed, which yielded a total of 7 patients (7/91, 7.7%) in the fnal 
results. In another two patients with initially invalid results, HEV RNA was detected by both methods at diferent 
time points. Tese reafrmed the accuracy of the in-house test. Te HEV RNA was amplifed and characterized as 
HEV genotype 3 (Supplementary Fig. 1) in one of the two patients with chronic hepatitis E, who was categorized 
as having active disease a few months before the beginning of the study. However, the samples from the seven 
patients discovered to be positive during this cohort study did not yield amplifed RNA. Tis could be due to the 
very low level of RNA in silent infections.
Tere are some other limitations in this study. Twenty-fve percent of the patients had a history of hepatitis C 
treatment with either pegylated interferon/ribavirin or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) plus ribavirin. Of these, 
10 patients underwent a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin during the study period. A prolonged 
course of pegylated interferon or ribavirin could suppress or eliminate HEV infection38,39. In addition, recent data 
indicate that sofosbuvir can suppress and has a synergistic efect on HEV viral replication40. Tese medications 
might have inevitably afected the number of positive cases in this study. Last, because the HEV serologies of all 
patients were not assessed during the pretransplant period, the positive results for HEV IgG could not diferentiate between the pre- and posttransplant acquisition of HEV infections.
In summary, HEV genotype 3, which is known to cause chronic liver disease in immunocompromised hosts, 
is the major genotype among infected individuals in Tailand. Our study shows a very high HEV seroprevalence 
in post-LT cases. A further 12-month follow-up study in asymptomatic patients with mostly normal liver enzyme 
levels demonstrated a signifcant number of patients with silent infections. Te detection of HEV RNA in the 
serum or feces of the patients did not depend on the HEV IgG seropositivity. More importantly, these occult or 
subclinical infections did not become overt infections or clinically signifcant hepatitis.
Methods
Post-LT patients receiving care at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were approached for study enrollment between October 2015 and June 2016. Te study protocol is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 108 patients provided 
a 10-mL blood sample (for serum testing for HEV IgG and IgM antibodies, and HEV RNA detection) and a fresh 
feces sample (for HEV RNA detection). Each patient’s demographic and clinical data, including the patient’s medical history; current medication(s), especially immunosuppressive agents; and laboratory results were retrieved

from the medical records. Patients who had a previous relevant history, active acute or chronic hepatitis E, or 
active malignancy and those who were unable to attend regular follow-up visits were excluded from the study. 
Afer recruitment, the patients attended follow-up visits every 4 months for 12 months for a clinical assessment, 
basic laboratory tests, and blood/feces sample collection. All samples were stored at −70 °C and simultaneously 
tested at the end of the study.
Tis study was approved by the Chulalongkorn University Institutional Review Board, IRB number 028/59. 
Written (signature or thumbprint) informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study participation. 
Te study was registered with the Tai Clinical Trials Registry, TCTR20170112005, on 12 January 2017. During 
the 12-month follow-up period, all participants who had active hepatitis were investigated and treated according 
to standard medical care, including for hepatitis E-related diseases. Afer the fnal test results of the study were 
obtained, the patients were informed of their status and counseled according to the Declaration of Helsinki and 
Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research.
Laboratory methods. HEV serology assays. All serum samples were tested for the IgG and IgM HEV 
antibodies using an anti-HEV 96-well plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (WE-7296, WE-7196; 
WANTAI Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Te 
optical density/cut-of (OD/co) values above 1.1 were considered positive. Values between 0.9 and 1.1 were considered negative.
HEV RNA detection. Te levels of HEV RNA in the serum and feces samples were evaluated using the COBAS 
HEV Test, which is a fully automated molecular diagnostic system for the hepatitis E virus. Te assay was performed on the COBAS 6800 System, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Te 95% limit of detection (LoD) was 18.6 IU/ml. If the test showed invalid results, an 
in-house real-time RT-PCR was used for confrmation.
For the in-house real-time RT-PCR, the HEV RNA was detected by one-step real-time PCR for HEV 
ORF2/341. Te 95% LoD of HEV RNA detection, as calibrated against the WHO international standard sample, 
was 53.5 IU/mL18.
HEV genotyping. Te PCR product from a semi-nested RT-PCR was used to determine the genotype of HEV 
present in samples with the published primers for ORF1 and ORF242. Te amplicons were sequenced and analyzed with Chromas LITE (v2.1.1), BioEdit v.7.0.4.1 and subjected to a BLASTN search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov). Phylogenetic trees were generated from the partial nucleotide sequences of the ORF1 (315 base pairs) 
and ORF2 (417 base pairs) regions (Supplementary Fig. 1). Te neighbor-joining tree method was implemented 
in MEGA v.6.0. Te reliability of the phylogenetic trees was assessed by 1000 bootstrap resampling.
Statistical analysis. All data were collected in MICROSOFT EXCEL 2010 (www.microsof.com) and analyzed 
using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 for Windows, NY: IBM Corp, USA. Te continuous variables were compared 
using Student’s t test, and a p-value <0.05 was considered signifcant.
