INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causative agents
of chronic liver diseases, including asymptomatic carrier (ASC),
chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1). HBV infection is especially prevalent in African and Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China because most patients with chronic HBV
infection have acquired the infection perinatally from carrier mothers (2, 3). 
Liver injury associated with HBV infection is mediated predominantly through an immune mechanism (4). This immune response is influenced by age at infection, host genetic factorsand the genetic variability of the virus (5). 
The serological heterogeneity of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been well established. HBV isolates have
been classified into 9 different subtypes according to the antigenic determinants of their HBsAg (6, 7). However, the classification of HBV by serologic subtype is not rational because
a single point mutation at the S gene may result in a change
in subtype (8). Therefore, according to the molecular evolutionary analysis of the genomic DNA sequence, HBV strains
isolated in various countries are classified into 8 genotypes:
genotypes A to H (9-11). It is a distinct trend that the distribution of HBV genotypes throughout the world is specific to location. For example, genotype A is prevalent in the
United States, Europe, and Central Africa (10, 12, 13). The
incidence of genotype B and C varies markedly among Asian
countries (14, 15). 
Recently, the influences of HBV genotypes in manifestation of clinical liver disease have been reported (16-21). However, results concerning the distribution of HBV genotypes
and the association between the distinct genotypes and the
severity of liver disease in Korea remained unreported. A previous comparative study of HBV-associated liver diseases between the southern part of Korea and western part of Japan
has shown a difference in severity of liver disease. The HBsAg
positive rate of patients with LC and HCC was higher in

Hepatitis B Virus Genotype C Prevails Among Chronic Carriers of the
Virus in Korea
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causative agents of chronic liver diseases
in Korea. HBV has been classified into 8 genotypes by a divergence of >8% in the
entire genomic sequence, and have distinct geographic distributions. There are limited
data on the relevance between HBV genotypes and clinical outcomes in Korea. To
investigate the clinical feature relating to HBV genotype in Korea, a total 120 serum
samples with HBsAg (65 from Seoul and 55 from the other city in Korea) were obtained from each 30 chronic HBV carriers with asymptomatic carrier (ASC), chronic
hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV genotype
was determined by either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies against genotype-specific epitopes in the preS2-region or the direct
sequencing of small S gene. HBV genotypes were determined in 105 (87.5%) of 120
samples. HBV genotype C was identified in all HBV carriers with ASC, CH, LC, and
HCC. Genotypes A, B, D, E, F and G were not detected in any of them. Genotype C
HBV prevails predominantly among chronic carriers of the virus in Korea, irrespective of their clinical stages of liver disease and geographic origin.

Korea than in Japan (22). Moreover, mortality rates of HCC
among Koreans were higher than those among Japanese (23).
In the present study, we used a monoclonal antibody of the
epitopes specific for each HBV genotype and classified the epitopes into five serotypes: bsu, bm, bks, bksu, and bk, which are
equivalent to genotypes A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively. By
using this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we
investigated the prevalence of HBV genotypes and the association between distinct genotypes and the severity of liver
disease in Korea. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients 
A total of 120 serum samples with positive for HBsAg were
obtained from chronic HBV carriers (65 from Seoul and 55
from the other city in Korea) who underwent long-term follow-up at Kangnam St. Mary’s Hospital, the Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. They included 30 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASC, persistently normal serum alanine
aminotransferase levels for at least 2 yr in periodic biochemical
examinations every 3 or 6 months), 30 CH, 30 LC, and 30
HCC. Chronic hepatitis was diagnosed from liver biopsy samples by sono-guided needle aspiration. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by liver function and sonogram. The diagnosis of HCC
was established in liver-biopsied specimens, and typical features were noted on angiography. Serum samples from each
subject were taken and stored at -80℃ until virological tests
were performed. For patients with histologically verified chronic liver disease, serum samples were collected when liver
biopsies were performed.
Serological markers and detection of HBV DNA
HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were determined
by a commercially available kit (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott
Park, IL, U.S.A.). Detectable HBV DNA in serum was quantified by Quantiplex branched DNA assay (Bayer Diagnostics,
Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.; sensitivity 2.5 pg/mL)
Serological determination of the six HBV genotypes
The six major genotypes of HBV, i.e. A, B, C, D, E and F
were determined by ELISA with commercial kits (HBV Genotype EIA, Institute of Immunology, Tokyo, Japan) according to the method described by Usuda et al. (24). First,
HBsAg particles in test sera were captured by immobilized
antibody to the common determinant of HBsAg. Then, they
were subjected to binding with monoclonal antibodies
against five distinct preS2 epitopes, designated b, k, m, s,and u,
which were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
Since the expression of these five epitopes is influenced by
HBV genotypes, the combination thereof enables us to
determine the genotypes serologically. The epitope b is
shared by HBsAg of all genotypes. Genotypes A, B, C, D,
and F were distinguished by five serotypes recognized by
respective mAbs, i.e. bsu, bm, bks, bksu, and bk. Thus, the
serotype bsu is specific for genotype A, bm for B, bks for C,
bksu for D, E and bk for F. The validity of this ELISA for
serological determination of the five HBV genotypes has
been verified previously (24).
Determination of genotypes by HBV DNA sequences 
HBV genotype in six samples was determined by phylogenetic analysis using the method described previously (25).
Nucleic acids were extracted from 100 L of serum, using
a DNA extractor kit (Genome Science Laboratory, Fukushima, Japan). The entire small S gene (681 bp) was amplified
by two overlapping fragments. The PCR primers for the first
round consisted of sense: 5-AAG CTC TGC TAG ATC CCA
GAG T-3 (SS1: 18-39) and anti-sense: 5-CAT ACT TTC CAA
TCA ATA GG-3 (SS2: 989-970); the primers for the second
round were sense primer SS1, antisense: 5-GAA ACA TAG
AGG TGC CTT GAG CAG-3 (SS3: 557-634) and sense: 5-
TGC TGC TAT GCC TCA TCT T-3 (SS4: 414-433), antisense primer SS2 (25). Amplified HBV DNA fragments were
sequenced directly by the dideoxy method using a Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit and a fluorescent 3100
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.
A.). The primers used for the sequencing were the second set
of primers described above for PCR.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were examined by Student’s
t-test, Fisher’s exact probability test or the Mann-Whitney
rank test. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Data analysis was performed using
SPSS software (version 10.0, Chicago, IL, U.S.A). 
RESULTS
Clinical features of patients with chronic hepatitis B
The demographic, virological, and clinical characteristics
of the carriers with chronic hepatitis were summarized in Table
1. A family history of positive for HBsAg, as determined
through an interview during the first visit, was noted in 76
patients (63%). Incidence of alcohol consumption, operation
and transfusion history was present in 48 (40%), 34 (28%),
and 10 (8%) carriers, respectively. HBeAg and HBV DNA
were detected in 47 (39%) and 58 (48%) carriers, respectively. Clinical backgrounds in carriers with different stages of
liver disease are shown in Table 1. In each group, no statisti-

cally significant differences were observed between family history of HBV infection and history of transfusion, operation
and drinking. The level of albumin and -glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly lower in the group of LC and HCC
than in other groups (p=0.045 and p=0.039). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had tendency to increase in carriers
with CH, LC and HCC than that of ASC. The HBeAg positive rate was significantly higher in the carriers with CH and
LC than in those with ASC and HCC (p=0.001), and the HBV
DNA positive rate was significantly higher in the carriers with
ASC, CH and LC than in those with of HCC (p=0.032).
Distribution of HBV genotypes in 120 patients with 
chronic hepatitis B
HBV genotypes were determined by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies against pre S2 determinants. Of the 120
serum samples, 21 (17.5%) were negative for ELISA. Among
them, HBV DNA was amplified in 6 samples, and HBV
genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of the
small S gene (Table 2). Finally, the 105 patients (26 ASC, 30
CH, 30 LC and 19 HCC) were analyzed the genotypes of
HBV (Table 3). HBV genotype C was identified all of the
carriers with ASC, CH, LC and HCC. Genotypes A, B, D,
E and F were not detected in any of them. All HBV carriers
in Seoul and the other cities had genotype C. 
DISCUSSION
HBV strains isolated in various countries are classified into
8 genotypes: genotypes A to H (9-11). These genotypes are
recognized as distinct if differences of more than 8% exist in
the entire nucleotide sequence of approximately 3,200 nt. The
preS2-region has less constraint on the sequence and would
be more variable than the S gene, making it a better candidate
than the S gene as the basis of genotypic divergence. With
such a rationale, epitopes on the preS2-region product which
would reflect genotypes were selected. Monoclonal antibodies which recognized epitopes borne by the preS2-region product were obtained. The present study used an ELISA method
to classify HBV genotypes (24). ELISA is a rather simple method and takes only a short time (about 6 hr), although genotypes are currently determined by restriction fragment length
polymorphism (13, 26). With the methods in this study, it was
possible to classify HBV into five types: HBV genotypes A, B,
C, D, E and F based on a combination of epitopes detected
with monoclonal antibodies, for example, a common epitope
observed on all HBV genotypes, and a specific epitope on the
respective HBV genotype.

Hepatitis B virus Genotype in Korea 819
type throughout the world is specific to geographical location. Genotype A is prevalent in the United States, Europe,
and Central Africa (10, 12, 13). Genotype B and C are frequent in Asia, especially Southeast Asia and Far East Asia
(21), and D is prevalent worldwide, with particular presence
in the Mediterranean area, Central Asia, and South America.
Genotype E is restricted to West Africa, and genotype F prevails in Central and South America (27). Genotype G was determined very recently in France and Georgia of the U.S.A.,
and its distribution is yet to be investigated (10). 
The incidence of genotype C varies markedly among Asian
countries (16, 18, 21). In our study, we found that all 105
(100%) patients were HBV genotype C regardless of disease
severity in Korean and the outcome of this study is comparable with the results of previous studies in Korea (28, 29).
As in the results from Shanghai, China and Japan, genotype
C was found in most patients with chronic HBV infection in
Korea. As a note of comparison, genotype B was predominant
in Taiwan. Genotype C was especially predominant in the central regions of Japan, reaching a distribution of over 95% comparable to that in Korea, suggesting the migration from other
Asian countries to the Japanese archipelago. It was reported
that people from Northeast Asia migrated to Japan via the
Korean peninsula about 2,300 yr ago, displacing the people
to the south and north (30). Besides epidemiological distributions, HBV genotypes would also be able to trace the population movement; the route of infection is mainly found from
mother-to-infant perinatally in Asian countries (31), suggesting that the HBV genotype may be highly conserved in the
same population by vertical transmission from mother to
baby, especially in Southeast Asia, including Korea. There were
significant differences reported regarding geographic distribution; genotypes C and B were predominant in Japan, while
Korea expressed no difference in geographic distribution between in and around Seoul and Jeju island, which is located
far away from the Seoul, but close to Japan (28) and genotype
C prevailed. This study also shows the same result (Table 2,
3). The differences between the two close countries can be
associated with the route of migration; people from Northeast
Asia and Southern Asia migrated to Japan, but the migration
to Korea occurred only from Northeast Asia, with some subsequent migration to Japan (18). 
It has been reported that HBV genotypes exert their influence through a point mutation in the precore region for an
HBeAg-minus phenotype, from G to A nucleotide 1896,
which is associated with the loss of HBeAg. Li et al. was the
first to note that the HBV genome of genotype A had C 1858
and implicate it in a rare HBeAg seroconversion. Patients
with genotype A were significantly more likely to be HBeAgpositive at first examination compared with results in patients
with genotypes B and C (32). In contrast, genotype C strains
are heterogenous with respect to T or C as nucleotide 1858
mutations in the HBV genome were associated with HBeAg
as well as viral replication (33). The G1896A mutation changes a wobble G-T for a Watson-Crick A-T pair in genomes
with T1585, although it is precluded in those with C1858
because it results in a forbidden C-A pair. In addition, core
mutants were more frequent in genotype C strains and were
associated with more inflammation and fibrosis of the liver
than those in genotype B (34). These findings suggest that
pathogenic differences between genotypes may exist and the
core mutation may be useful as a marker for progressive liver
damage. Patients with genotype C appeared to be correlated
with lower seroconversion rates, severe liver damage, higher
replicative activity and more-severe liver inflammation than
those with genotype B (16, 34).
Cirrhosis was ascribed to HBV (58%), alcohol (26%), hepatitis C virus (11%) or both (2%), or was cryptogenic (3%)
in Korea (35). HCC is a major public health problem in Korea,
where it is the sixth most common cause of death, reported
by Korean National Statistical Office in 2002, and is probably
linked to the high prevalence of HBV infection (58%) and
to the culture which encourages high alcohol consumption.
The HBsAg positive rate of patients with liver cirrhosis and
HCC was higher in Korea than in Japan (22, 36). Mortality
rates of HCC among Koreans are also higher than those among
Japanese (23). These may be related to a higher rate of HBsAg
carriers, heavy drinking, and the predominance of genotype
C in Korea (23, 28, 37). Furthermore, low clearance of interferon-induced HBeAg loss in genotype C might be an additional factor of poor prognosis in patients with chronic HBV
infection (38). 
In conclusion, genotype C HBV prevails predominantly
among Korean chronic carriers of the virus, irrespective of
their clinical stages of liver disease and geographic origin, indicating that it may associate with more advanced liver disease
than any other country.
