Abstract
Introduction Normovolemia after major surgery is critical to avoid complications. The aim of the present study was to analyze
correlation between fluid balance, weight gain, and postoperative outcomes.
Methods All consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency major abdominal surgery needing intermediate care unit
(IMC) admission from September 2017 to January 2018 were included. Postoperative fluid balances and daily weight changes
were calculated for postoperative days (PODs) 0–3. Risk factors for postoperative complications (30-day Clavien) and prolonged
length of IMC and hospital stay were identified through uni- and multinominal logistic regression.
Results One hundred eleven patients were included, of which 55% stayed in IMC beyond POD 1. Overall, 67% experienced any
complication, while 30% presented a major complication (Clavien ≥ III). For the entire cohort, median cumulative fluid balance
at the end of PODs 0–1–2–3 was 1850 (IQR 1020–2540) mL, 2890 (IQR 1610–4000) mL, 3890 (IQR 2570–5380) mL, and 4000
(IQR 1890–5760) mL respectively, and median weight gain was 2.2 (IQR 0.3–4.3) kg, 3 (1.5–4.7) kg, and 3.9 (2.5–5.4) kg,
respectively. Fluid balance and weight course showed no significant correlation (r = 0.214, p = 0.19). Extent of surgery, analyzed
through Δ albumin and duration of surgery, significantly correlated with POD 2 fluid balances (p = 0.04, p = 0.006, respectively),
as did POD 3 weight gain (p = 0.042). Prolonged IMC stay of ≥ 3 days was related to weight gain ≥ 3 kg at POD 2 (OR 2.8, 95%
CI 1.01–8.9, p = 0.049).
Conclusion Fluid balance and weight course showed only modest correlation. POD 2 weight may represent an easy and
pragmatic tool to optimize fluid management and help to prevent fluid-related postoperative complications.

recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal care pathway
aiming to reduce perioperative stress response to decrease
surgery-related morbidity. Among a multitude of measures
aiming to simplify perioperative care, ERAS protocols endorse restrictive fluid management [7–11]. However, fluid
management remains poorly defined and highly variable
among institutions [12].
Postoperative fluid overload is a common problem in surgical patients, and physicians need reproducible, easy to monitor tools to prevent early complications and to guide further
therapies. In clinical practice, daily fluid balances, diuresis,
and body weight are commonly used to guide fluid management and diuretics therapy [13–15], but some studies showed
that these two surveillance tools may disagree [16–18].
Considering the potential for calculation errors and imprecision with regard to insensible fluid losses, stool quantity etc.,
monitoring body weight may be more representative to identify fluid overload and associated postoperative
complications.
Albumin is considered a negative acute-phase protein because its concentration decreases during injury and sepsis. The
decrease of serum albumin was shown to be associated with
postoperative outcomes and reflect extent of surgery [19–21].
Δ Albumin was used in the present study as a surrogate to
correlate the impact of surgery to the fluid balances and
weight evolution.
The aim of this study was to analyze daily weight variations and fluid balance during the first 3 postoperative days
(PODs) after major surgery in a surgical intermediate care unit
(IMC) of a high-volume institution and to correlate both measures to each other and postoperative outcomes. Whether one
measure is preferable or more reliable than the other has not
yet been assessed in the specific setting of a surgical intermediate care unit.
Methods
Consecutive adult (≥ 18 years) patients undergoing elective or
emergency major abdominal surgery (general anesthesia, >
2 h) with a request of direct postoperative surgical IMC at
Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) from 4 September
2017 to 30 January 2018 were eligible.
Patients hospitalized in external IMC wards outside the
dedicated visceral surgery unit, patients remaining in the
postanesthesia care unit (PACU) beyond the usual immediate
postoperative surveillance period of 2 h, patients immediately
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative
surveillance, and patients without informed consent for research participation were excluded. This is due to the data
allocation and consistency with medical personal. In our institution, postoperative patients in the ICU and PACU are primarily managed by intensive care physicians and anesthetists,
respectively, and therefore the patient’s weight protocols (i.e.,
timing, staffing, balance) are different. Patient admission to
either ICU or IMC depends on multidisciplinary clinical evaluation postoperatively after the routine 2-h PACU surveillance period. Patients were admitted to the divisional surgical
IMC (visceral surgery) based on this assessment.
This study was conducted as part of an institutional quality
improvement project and data extraction was approved by the
local Review Board (Commission cantonale d’éthique de la
recherche sur l’être humain CER-VD # 2018-00249).
Demographic and surgical data of each patient were reported in a prospective database. Body mass index (BMI) and
American Association of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification
were calculated during preoperative anesthesiologic evaluation. Surgical details including duration and type of surgery
were recorded. The duration of the procedure (from incision to
closure) was recorded at the time of surgery either by the
surgeon or the anesthetist in the institutional OR management
software. All procedures were performed (either directly or
under face-to-face supervision) by senior staff members of
the respective surgical specialty.
Analysis of cumulative fluid balance, weight evolution,
and composition of inputs/outputs were conducted only on
patients with IMC stay of at least 72 h.
Assessment of fluids and calculation of fluid balance
Intraoperative fluid balance was assessed and recorded by the
anesthesiology care team. For elective surgeries, institutional
surgical and anesthetic perioperative pathways, specific for
each intervention and according to ERAS recommendations,
were employed [7–11].
For emergency surgeries, perioperative fluid administration was guided by advanced hemodynamic monitoring (fluid
guidance), hemoglobin (Hgb), acid bases status with periodic
measurement of arterial blood gases, and urine output (>
0.5 ml/kg/h or up to discretion of treating anesthetist). If
deemed necessary, invasive monitoring was used [18, 22].
The amount of intraoperative fluid administration was related to weight of patient, duration of surgery, blood loss, and
urine output. Management was in line with recommendations
of current consensus on perioperative fluid management
[23–26]. Insensible losses were not taken into account for
intraoperative fluid infusion [4, 7, 27].
Daily postoperative fluid balance was prospectively calculated according to the institutional protocol from 12 am to
12 am at PODs 1, 2, and 3. On a routine basis, the nursing
staff in charge took into consideration all in/outputs.
Continuous fluid perfusions, intravenous medications, epidural anesthesia/patient controlled anesthesia (PCA), nasogastric
enteral feeding tube, oral intakes, and blood elements (packed
red blood cells (pRBCs), fresh frozen plasma and platelets)
were calculated and totaled for inputs. For output, calculation
1192 Langenbecks Arch Surg (2020) 405:1191–1200

were considered gastric aspiration, vomiting, stool (if quantifiable), drains (if quantifiable through emptying, i.e., Jackson
Pratt, intraperitoneal VAC, Penrose drain, chest tube, Redon
drain), and urines. Insensible losses, such as perspiration, were
not taken into account.
Transfusion thresholds for pRBCs were set in accordance
with the institutional protocol: Hgb < 70 g/L in healthy,
asymptomatic patients, Hgb < 90 g/L in polymorbid patients,
particularly those with ischemic heart disease.
Daily weight was prospectively assessed on routine basis for
all patients by the same standard scale every morning between
8 am and 12 am. In our institution, all elective patients are
mobilized at POD 0, according to ERAS protocol routinely
applied. The same strategy also applies to patients undergoing
emergency surgery. This approach made it possible to weigh
86% of patients during the morning of POD 1. Difference of
(Δ) weight was computed by comparing weight at PODs 1, 2,
and 3 to preoperative body weight (assessed during preoperative outpatient visits within 30 days prior to surgery).
Serum albumin was routinely obtained in the setting of preand postoperative laboratory analyses. Δ albumin was
assessed by comparing preoperative albumin (at POD − 1) to
albumin at POD 1.
No institutional protocol for management of patients with
fluid excess is currently available and diuretics administration
was considered case-by-case and therefore not standardized.
Outcomes/study endpoints
The primary outcome was the correlation between cumulative
fluid balance (ml) and daily weight (kg) variations. More specifically, weight at POD 2 (previously identified as most predictive cutoff to launch potential counter-regulatory measures)
was correlated with fluid balance at POD 1 (most accurately
representing perioperative fluid balance) [28–30].
Secondary endpoint was the impact of positive cumulative
fluid balance (ml) and weight gain (kg) on postoperative outcomes (complications and length of stay). Based on the results, cutoffs for the multinominal regression model were
pragmatically set at 3 L (POD 1) and 3 kg (POD 2), respectively. Complications were graded according to the Clavien
classification (grades I–V) [31] and the Comprehensive
Complications Index (CCI) [32]. Two subanalyses were made
to assess overall complications and major complications, as
grades I to II were classified as minor and grades III to V as
major, with grade V indicating death. Further outcomes of
interest were length of IMC stay and length of hospital stay
(LoS).
Outpatient control visits were routinely scheduled at 4–
6 weeks from discharge.
Demographic and surgical characteristics were compared
between two groups (< 24-h IMC stay vs. ≥ 24-h IMC stay) to
identify patients needing solely overnight IMC surveillance.
Subgroup analysis of patients with at least 72 h of
IMC stay
To assess the impact of fluid balance and weight gain on
postoperative outcomes, several subgroup analyses were performed in patients with IMC stay ≥ 72 h. In these patients,
extent of surgery (Δ albumin, duration of surgery) was studied and correlated with cumulative fluid balance and Δ weight
at POD 2 and postoperative morbidity (CCI).
Analyses were performed in the same group of patients to
study the correlation between cumulative fluid balance, Δ
weight and length of IMC/total length of stay at POD 2.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were reported as median (interquartile
range, IQR) and range or mean ± standard deviation (SD) as
appropriate for continuous variables and absolute or relative
frequencies for categorical variables. Continuous variables
were compared using the Student t test; categorical variables
through Fisher’s exact (chi squared) test. All tests were twosided and p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical correlations were tested by use of Pearson’s
rank correlation.
Multinominal logistic regression was performed to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
the 4 outcomes any complication, major complication,
prolonged IMC stay and prolonged total LoS, whereas
prolonged IMC stay was defined as ≥ 3 days and prolonged
LoS as ≥ 10 days (median total LoS for the whole cohort). For
each multivariable model, all univariate risk factors with
p < 0.1 for the respective outcome were included.
Data analysis was performed with the Statistical Software
for the Social Sciences SPSS Advanced Statistics 22 (IBM
Software Group, 200 W. Madison St., Chicago, IL; 60606
USA) and GraphPad Prism Software 8 (2365 Northside Dr.,
Suite 560, San Diego, CA; 92108 USA).
Results
Patients
In total, 165 patients fulfilling the study requirements were
admitted to IMC over the study period. Fifty-four patients
(32.7%) were excluded for denial/lack of consent, as outlined
in the flowchart in Fig. 1.
For the entire cohort, median cumulative fluid balance at
the end of PODs 0–1–2–3 was 1850 (IQR 1020–2540) mL,
2890 (IQR 1610–4000) mL, 3890 (IQR 2570–5380) mL, and
4000 (IQR 1890–5760) mL respectively, and median weight
gain was 2.2 (IQR 0.3–4.3) kg, 3 (1.5–4.7) kg, and 3.9 (2.5–
5.4) kg, respectively.

Of the 111 included patients, 50 (45%) were discharged
from IMC surveillance within 24 h, while 61 (55%) remained
beyond POD 1. Demographic data of the cohort are displayed
in Table 1. Patients in the longer surveillance group had a lower
BMI and underwent more often HPB, open and prolonged
procedures for malignant indications. Significant differences
in early postoperative fluid balances and weight gain were observed between the 2 groups, as summarized in Table 2. Only
16 of the 111 patients (14%) were not weighed at POD1 and
discharged from IMC surveillance before 12 AM.

Subgroup analysis of patients with ≥ 3 days of IMC
stay
Forty-six patients (41%) remained in the IMC for at least
3 days, and all of them were weighed until 12 AM, according
to study protocol. Detailed composition of fluid administration and fluid losses are displayed in Fig. 2.
Figure 3a outlines cumulative fluid balances and weight
evolution (Δ weight) from the day of surgery through POD
3, showing almost identical patterns. Figure 3b shows no correlation of cumulative fluid balance at POD 1 with weight at
POD 2 (p = 0.190).
Extent of surgery (as assessed through surrogates Δ albumin and surgical duration) correlated significantly with POD 2
fluid balances, as illustrated in Fig. 4 a and b. While POD 3
weight gain correlated with surgical duration, no significant
correlations were observed between POD 3 weight gain and Δ
albumin.
POD 2 weight gain did not significantly correlate with
surgical morbidity as assessed by the CCI as shown in Fig. 5.
A total of 13/46 patients (28%) with ≥ 3-day IMC stay
experienced major complications. Regression analysis was
not performed (small sample size/event rate).
Figure 6 correlates POD 2 weight gain to IMC stay (p =
0.054) and total hospital stay (p = 0.094) in the subgroup of
patients staying at least 3 days.
Seventy-five patients (66%) experienced any complication,
while 34 (31%) presented a major complication. Median IMC
stay for all patients was 3 days (IQR 1–5 days), while median
total LoS was 10 days (IQR 6–17 days).
The only independent risk factor for any complication was
open surgery (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.02–9.24, p = 0.045), while

open surgery (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.02–11.08, p = 0.046) and
preoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR 5.54, 95% CI 1.12–27.5,
p = 0.036) were identified as risk factors for major complications. Prolonged IMC stay of ≥ 3 days was related to weight
gain ≥ 3 kg at POD 2 (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.01–8.9, p = 0.049),
while prolonged total LoS was independently associated with
open surgery (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.22–7.28, p = 0.017), malignancy (OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.98–17.95, p = 0.001), and emergency surgery (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.14–22.05, p = 0.033).
Detailed results of multivariable analysis are displayed in online appendix 1.
Discussion
This retrospective analysis showed a weak correlation between postoperative fluid balance and weight change. No correlation was found between postoperative weight gain and
complications. However, increasing weight gain positively
correlated with prolonged length of hospital stay.
In clinical practice, both daily fluid balance and body weight
are used to guide fluid therapy [13–15]. Whether the more
complex and detailed calculation of fluid balance or simply
postoperative weight evolution is more predictive remains matter of debate. Calculation of fluid balance is complex, imprecise, and can be prone to systematic error. Considering the
potential for errors due to insensible fluid losses when calculating fluid balance, the objective, and reproducible weight-based
method may be more representative. Obtaining a reliable body
weight measurement requires compliance by nursing staff,
which is, sometimes, difficult for the workload and patient’s
clinical presentation, especially for hemodynamic condition. In
our experience, only 14% of patients were not weighed at POD
1, but all of them were discharged from IMC before 12 h, and
all patients were weighted at POD3. These results could be
explained by the routine use of the ERAS protocol since several
years, which focuses particularly on early postoperative mobilization of the patient already at the day of surgery, also if
hemodynamic support is needed. In the present study, the correlation between cumulative fluid balance and weight gain in
the first three postoperative days was weak. As illustrated in
Fig. 3a, the evolution of cumulative fluid balance appears to be
almost identical to weight gain through PODs 1–3, and Fig. 3b
shows a low correlation between fluid balance at POD 1 and
weight at POD 2. This can be explained by limitations related
to the small sample size. Furthermore, these findings suggest
that daily weight may be a simpler and more objective way to
measure postoperative fluid shifts. Several studies have reported a lack of accuracy in calculating fluid balances. Perren et al.
[33], in a study of 147 patients carried out in ICU, revealed that
daily and cumulative fluid balance were arithmetically incorrect in one third of cases. Similarly, Köster et al. [16] found that
cumulative daily fluid balances did not correspond with weight
changes in 106 ICU patients with length of ICU stay > 5 days,
even after consideration of insensible fluid losses. Tolstrup
et al. [17] revealed a significant discrepancy between the two
techniques on postoperative day 5 (> 2000 g/mL).
In the present study, positive fluid balance reflected the
extent of surgery (duration, Δ albumin). This is in line with
recent studies stressing the relationship between surgical stress
and postoperative albumin decrease. Mantziari et al. [34] reported on 70 patients undergoing seven different surgical

interventions to show a correlation between surgical stress and
biomarkers (CRP, albumin, and triglycerides). However, only
albumin changes (delta albumin) correlated with surgical access, peritoneal trauma, and organ resections. Lagbaa et al.
[19] analyzed 138 patients undergoing major surgery and
found a correlation between Δ albumin and surgical stress.
Further, the decrease of serum albumin was closely associated
with postoperative adverse outcomes in their analysis.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the findings of the present study
show a significant correlation between POD 2 fluid balance and both postoperative albumin decrease and operative time. This can be explained by the surgical stress response, which induces inflammatory and hormonal perturbation, which in consequence impacts on salt and water
metabolism [35]. Furthermore, a tendency to normalization
of weight at POD 3 as seen in Fig. 4 was observed. This
may reflect, besides the end of the early post-operative
inflammatory response, early triggering of counterFig. 4 Impact of extent of surgery on fluid balance and weight. a Delta

regulatory measures (i.e. diuretic therapy) and interruption
of IV infusion routinely initiated during surgery, in line
with the ERAS protocol [7–11, 36]. Similar findings were
described by Tolstrup et al. [17]: in their study, patient’s
weight decreased after POD3 while discrepancy between
body weight and fluid balance increased.
The population of the present study was separated in two
groups, based on the length of IMC stay. The two groups
differed regarding surgical details (malignancy, open approach, operation duration), but also BMI. This BMI difference can be explained by the institutional policy to systematically monitor bariatric patients with untreated sleeping apnea
for 24 h in IMC (12 patients, 10.8%).
The association between highly positive fluid balance and
poor outcome has been previously observed. Several studies
reported that positive fluid balance may result in worse outcome and prolonged length of stay [5, 8]. Köster et al. [16]
confirmed these results and showed increased survival and
reduced ICU stay in all comers experiencing weight loss of
1.8 kg at the time of discharge. Our group previously studied
effects of fluid balance on postoperative outcomes after
ileostomy takedown. Both excess fluids and weight gain were
found to be independent predictors of postoperative ileus and
emphasize the importance of stringent fluid management [6].
Weinberg et al. [37] studied 150 patients after Whipple’s
procedure and found better outcomes in terms of length of
hospital stay and postoperative complications in patients with
restrictive fluid management.
The present study further suggests that excessive weight
gain may be associated with prolonged IMC and hospital stay,
but our observations need to be confirmed by adequately
powered studies, as seen in Fig. 6.
Postoperative complications were more common after
open surgery and in malnourished patients as shown in
Table 1, while no significant association with weight gain
was observed as displayed in Fig. 5. Potential explanations
include routine use of ERAS protocols in our institution, with
implementation of a wide array of measures to counteract
positive fluid balances early in the postoperative course, including IV fluid lock at POD1 and both early resumption of
oral intake and mobilization [7–11, 36].
This study has several limitations. The modest simple size
makes the study prone to type II error, and larger studies are
needed to confirm these preliminary data. This pilot study
may be underpowered for some of the secondary outcomes,
which were only assessed in the subgroup of patients with ≥
3 days of IMC stay. This has to be considered when
interpreting the results, and future prospective studies with
predefined, adequate sample sizes for the respective outcome
of interest are mandatory. Furthermore, the specific setting of
a surgical IMC unit potentially represents a selection bias and
thus the results of the present study cannot be uncritically
extrapolated to other care settings (i.e., ICU, general wards).
The study is further limited by its retrospective design, despite
thorough prospective data gathering. Arguably, the study cohort is heterogeneous, however reflecting the diverse surgical
activity of the present institution.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that postoperative weight evolution may be sufficient as surveillance tool to predict complications in the early postoperative course. Larger studies are
needed to confirm these results.
