Liver transplantation, which inhibits the production of 
variant transthyretin (TTR), was conducted as a radical 
therapy for ATTRv in 2,136 cases from 1990 to 2015.3
Liver function in patients with ATTRv is usually normal, 
even though the liver produces variant TTR. Thus, livers 
removed from patients with ATTRv have been used for 
Hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTRv) 
amyloidosis is often first detected in patients during 
their 20s and 30s. There is a gradual progression 
in symptoms, such as sensory dominant neuropathy, 
autonomic dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction, with a 
mean survival of approximately 10 years without treatment.1,2

Background: Using transthoracic echocardiography, including 2D speckle tracking imaging (STI), this study examined cardiac 
function after domino liver transplantation (DLT) with liver grafts explanted from patients with hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin 
amyloidosis.
Methods and Results: In all, 14 patients who underwent DLT at Kumamoto University Hospital and for whom 2D STI information 
was available were enrolled in the study; time-dependent echocardiographic changes were evaluated in 7. Although left ventricular 
(LV) systolic and diastolic function did not differ between the pre- and post-DLT periods (mean [±SD] 5.4±1.0 years after DLT), there 
were significant (P<0.05 for all) increases in the post- vs. pre-DLT period in basal longitudinal strain (LS; −13.4±2.3 vs. −19.3±4.4), 
relative apical LS index (=apical LS/[basal LS+mid LS]; 0.75±0.20 vs. 0.58±0.08), and LV ejection fraction/global LS (3.91±0.58 vs. 
3.06±0.44). Age at the time of DLT was significantly higher in the group with impaired (>−14%) than preserved basal LS (57.2±3.5 
vs. 39.6±16.0 years; P<0.05). When control subjects (n=14) were added to the enrolled DLT recipients, multivariable logistic regression 
analysis revealed that a history of DLT was significantly associated with impaired basal LS (>−14%; odds ratio 28.39, 95% confidence 
interval 1.89–427.45, P<0.05).
Conclusions: LV systolic and diastolic function was preserved in the long term after DLT. However, 2D STI revealed subtle cardiac 
dysfunction in DLT recipients, which may be an early manifestation of cardiac amyloidosis.

there are only a few case reports of TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) after DLT.5,6 Thus, the safety of 
DLT has not been fully evaluated in the heart. The hallmarks 
of ATTR-CM on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 
are increased left ventricular (LV) thickness, left atrial

information regarding 2D STI evaluation in the post-DLT 
period. Thus, 14 DLT recipients were enrolled in this study. 
Of these 14 DLT recipients, 7 underwent TTE in both the 
pre- and post-DLT periods. Therefore, time-dependent 
changes in TTE findings were analyzed in these patients 
(Figure 2). In addition, randomly selected age- and sexmatched patients undergoing TTE at around the same time 
(i.e., month) as the 14 DLT recipients during the post-DLT 
period were included in the present study as controls. The 
14 control subjects had no cardiovascular diseases, including 
ischemic heart diseases, valvular diseases, cardiomyopathy, 
or arrhythmias.
The study protocol conformed to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kumamoto University (Reference 
no. 1588). This study was a retrospective observational study 
conducted using the opt-out method. The study protocol 
was publicized extensively at Kumamoto University and 
the Kumamoto University website (http://www2.kuh.

were provided the opportunity to withdraw from the study.

function.7,8 However, these findings can also be present in 
other disorders with increased afterload. The longitudinal 
strain (LS) pattern obtained by 2D speckle tracking imaging 
(STI) can be used to distinguish ATTR-CM from other 
causes of LV hypertrophy (LVH).9,10
The aim of the present study was to clarify both the 
time-dependent changes in cardiac function after DLT and 
the characteristics of cardiac impairment after DLT as 
evaluated using TTE, including 2D STI.
Methods
DLT Recipients and Control Subjects
Between 1998 and 2017, 30 patients with primary biliary 
cholangitis, biliary atresia, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis C, 
congenital absence of the portal vein, or primary sclerosing 
cholangitis underwent DLT with liver grafts obtained from 
ATTRv patients and were followed-up at Kumamoto 
University Hospital. Of these DLT recipients, 16 were 
excluded from the present study because of insufficient

using scatter plots. Patient clinical characteristics were 
compared between groups using Student’s t-test or the 
Chi-squared test.
Independent variables associated with impaired basal LS 
were assessed using logistic regression analysis. The following 
variables were initially incorporated into the univariable 
logistic regression analysis model: age, male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, dialysis, anticancer 
drug use, and history of DLT. Variables with P<0.10 were 
incorporated into the multivariable logistic regression 
analysis model. Intra- and interobserver variability for basal 
Echocardiographic Measurements
TTE was performed in stable patients using Vivid 7 or 
Vivid E95 (GE Vingmed, Horten, Norway), Aplio XG 
(Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan), or Epiq 7 (Philips, Washington, 
DC, USA) ultrasound systems equipped with a 2.5-MHz 
phased-array transducer. Chamber size, wall thickness, and 
LV systolic function, represented by LV ejection fraction 
(LVEF), were evaluated using standard procedures.11 LA 
volume index (LAVI), the ratio between E-wave velocity 
and A-wave velocity on pulsed-wave Doppler mitral flow 
imaging (E/A ratio), early diastolic velocity of the septum 
at the mitral annulus level (e’ wave velocity) on tissue 
Doppler imaging, the E/e’ ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation 
velocity (TRV) were calculated to quantify LV diastolic 
function.12,13 STI was performed by another operator 
who was blinded to patients’ clinical characteristics using 
vendor-independent software programs (2D Strain Analysis; 
TOMTEC Imaging Systems, Unterschleissheim, Germany) 
in patients with adequate endomyocardial border definition 
on TTE in the 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber apical views. Regional 
LS was determined in 16 segments of the LV in accordance 
with the American Society for Echocardiography guidelines.11 Global LS (GLS) was calculated as the mean LS of 
these 16 segments. Apical LS was calculated as the mean 
LS of the apical 4 segments. Mid LS and basal LS were 
calculated as the mean LS of the mid 6 segments and basal 
6 segments, respectively. The relative apical LS index 
(RapLSI; calculated as apical LS/[basal LS+mid LS]) and 
the ratio between LVEF and GLS were estimated as the 
hallmarks of CA on TTE.9,10
Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics as given as the mean±SD or number 
(percentage). Time-dependent changes in echocardiographic 
variables were analyzed using paired t-tests. Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients were used to investigate associations 
between absolute changes in basal LS and observation 
years after DLT, as well as between basal LS and several 
factors, namely age at the time of DLT, age at the time of 
TTE, and observation years after DLT, with results shown

period. The Supplementary Figure shows typical bullseye 
graphs of LS in DLT recipients (Patient No. 6 in Table 1) 
in the pre- and post-DLT periods. Absolute change in basal 
LS was significantly correlated with observation years after 
DLT (r=−0.95, P<0.01; Figure 3).
Clinical Characteristics in DLT Recipients vs. Control 
Subjects
The clinical characteristics of the DLT recipients and 
control subjects are given in the Supplementary Table. 
There were no significant differences in age at time of TTE 
and the proportion of men between the 2 groups. However, 
GLS (−17.1±2.1 vs. −19.4±2.1; P<0.01), basal LS (−14.7±3.8 
vs. −17.8±2.2; P<0.05), and the LVEF/GLS ratio (3.87±0.50 
vs. 3.35±0.43; P<0.01) were significantly higher in DLT 
recipients than in control subjects.
Comparisons Between DLT Recipients With Impaired and 
Preserved Basal LS
DLT recipients were divided into 2 groups based on the 
median basal LS value in the post-DLT period (−14%): the 
impaired basal LS group (>−14%) and the preserved basal 
LS group (≤−14%). Age at time of DLT (57.2±3.5 vs. 
39.6±16.0 years; P<0.05) and TTE (65.4±5.6 vs. 48.3±13.3 
years; P<0.01) was significantly higher in the impaired than 
preserved basal LS group (Table 3). There were no significant differences in other variables, including observation 
period after DLT and coronary risk factors, between the 2 
groups. Age at the time of DLT and TTE was significantly 
correlated with basal LS in DLT recipients (r=0.75 [P<0.01] 
and r=0.80 [P<0.01], respectively; Figure 4A,B). In contrast, 
there was no significant correlation between age at the time 
of TTE and basal LS in control subjects (r=−0.53, P=0.05; 
Figure 4C). Although there was no correlation between 
observation years after DLT and basal LS across all DLT 
recipients (r=−0.06, P=0.83; Figure 4D), there was a significant correlation between observation years after DLT and 
basal LS after in the middle aged and elderly (age >45 
years; r=0.69, P<0.05; Figure 4E).
LS was evaluated in 20 patients and assessed using intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICCs).
All analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows 
version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical 
significance was set at 2-tailed P<0.05.
Results
Clinical Characteristics of the DLT Recipients
The clinical characteristics of the 14 DLT recipients (11 
male, 3 female) enrolled in this study are given in Table 1. 
The mean age at the time of DLT was 48.3±13.9 years. 
Thirteen patients received domino liver grafts with the 
Val30Met mutation in the TTR gene, the most common 
type of TTR mutation worldwide, and only 1 patient 
received a graft with the Ser50Ile TTR mutation. The mean 
observation period after DLT was 8.4±1.0 years. Among 
the DLT recipients, 2 had received hemodialysis treatment, 
1 had moderate aortic stenosis, none had myocardial 
infarction, and 2 required hospitalization because of heart 
failure. One patient who received the graft with the Ser50Ile 
TTR mutation was positive for technetium pyrophosphate 
(99mTc-PYP) amyloid deposition in the heart (99mTc-PYP 
visual grade 2) and died from a cardiovascular event 17 
years after DLT. Another patient died from a non-cardiovascular event 11 years after DLT.
Time-Dependent Changes in Echocardiographic Findings in 
DLT Recipients
Time-dependent changes in echocardiographic findings 
after DLT were evaluated in 7 DLT recipients. All DLT 
recipients evaluated received domino liver grafts with the 
Val30Met TTR mutation. The mean observation period 
after DLT for these 7 recipients was 5.4±1.0 years. There 
were no significant differences in LVEF, E/A ratio, e’ wave 
velocity, E/e’ ratio, or TRV between the pre- and post-DLT 
periods (Table 2). In contrast, there were significant 
increases in GLS (−16.9±2.3 vs. −22.1±3.4; P<0.05), mid 
LS (−15.4±3.4 vs. −22.7±4.3; P<0.05), and basal LS 
(−13.4±2.3 vs. −19.3±4.4; P<0.05) in the post- vs. pre-DLT 
period. There were also significant increases in RapLSI

described TTR amyloid polyneuropathy. In contrast, there 
are only a few case reports on ATTR-CM after DLT.5,6,14
Therefore, the time-dependent changes in cardiac function 
after DLT have not been fully clarified. The present study 
showed that LVEF, the E/A ratio, the E/e’ ratio, e’ wave 
velocity, LAVI, and TRV did not differ significantly 
between the pre- and post-DLT periods, indicating that 
LV systolic and diastolic function was preserved in the 
long term after DLT. Although previous studies reported 
that the period from transplantation to development of 
amyloid polyneuropathy in DLT recipients was shorter 
than expected,15,16 cardiac function may be preserved in the 
long term after DLT. However, in the present study, 1 
patient was positive for 99mTc-PYP amyloid deposition in 
the heart and died from a cardiovascular event. This patient 
received a graft with the Ser50Ile TTR mutation for DLT. 
We previously reported that non-Val30Met mutations 
were important risk factors for cardiovascular events in 
ATTRv patients.17 Therefore, the DLT recipient who 
received a graft with the non-Val30Met mutation may have 
been at a higher risk of cardiovascular events than the other 
DLT recipients who received grafts with the Val30Met 
mutation.
RapLSI, a typical pattern of myocardial LS impairment, 
and the LVEF/GLS ratio can differentiate amyloid cardiomyopathy from other causes of LVH.9,10 The present study 
showed that RapLSI and the LVEF/GLS ratio were both 
increased in the post- compared with pre-DLT period. 
However, in the post-DLT period, the mean LVEF/GLS 
ratio and RapLSI did not reach the cut-off values for a 
diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy (cut-off values of 4.1 
Comparisons in All Subjects (DLT Recipients and Controls) 
Between Those With Impaired and Preserved Basal LS
Using the same cut-off value for basal LS, all subjects 
(DLT recipients and controls) were divided into an impaired 
(>−14%) and preserved (≤−14%) basal LS group. The 
proportion of subjects with a history of DLT was significantly higher in the impaired than preserved basal LS group 
(88% vs. 35%; P<0.05; Table 4A). Multivariable logistic 
regression analysis revealed that a history of DLT was 
significantly associated with impaired basal LS in all 
subjects (odds ratio 28.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.89–427.45, P<0.05; Table 4B).
Reproducibility
Analysis of intra- and interobserver variability for the 20 
reassessed subjects showed good correlations for basal LS 
measurements (mean ICC 0.88 [95% CI 0.71–0.95%] and 
0.93 [95% CI 0.82–0.97], respectively).
Discussion
The present study has several new findings. First, in many 
DLT recipients, cardiac systolic and diastolic function was 
preserved in the long term after DLT. Second, RapLSI and 
the LVEF/GLS ratio were increased in the post- compared 
with pre-DLT period. Third, the degree of impairment in 
basal LS was significantly correlated with the age at the 
time of DLT. Fourth, a history of DLT was significantly 
associated with impaired basal LS.
There are several reports about iatrogenic ATTR 
amyloidosis after DLT. However, many of these reports

Speckle Tracking Echocardiography and DLT 737
evaluate time-dependent changes in echocardiographic 
measurements for 7 DLT recipients. Consequently, there 
may be a bias related to the sample size. Validation using 
a similar cohort would be useful to support our results, but 
is not possible because there have only been case reports 
on cardiac function after DLT. Therefore, despite the 
small number of subjects, we believe that our results have 
significant value. Second, we did not evaluate cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in this study. CMR 
is an important imaging modality because of its high 
diagnostic performance for ATTR-CM. However, we were 
unable to evaluate CMR because many of the patients had 
no typical conventional echocardiographic findings of 
ATTR-CM and the cost of CMR is high. Third, we 
randomly enrolled control subjects after matching them 
with DLT recipients for age and sex. Thus, there were 
several differences (other than age and sex) between the 
DLT recipients and controls, such as morbidity rates of 
diabetes, dialysis, and malignancy, and these may have 
affected the findings of the present study. Despite these 
limitations, the present study is the first to demonstrate 
preserved LV systolic and diastolic function in the long 
term after DLT and subtle cardiac impairment evaluated 
by 2D STI in DLT recipients.
Conclusions
LV systolic and diastolic function was relatively preserved 
in the long term after DLT. However, 2D STI revealed 
subtle cardiac dysfunction in DLT recipients, which may 
be an early expression of cardiac amyloidosis.

and 1.00, respectively) and many of the DLT recipients 
were negative for 99mTc-PYP. Gillmore et al18 reported that 
combined findings of positive bone scintigraphy including 
99mTc-PYP and negative monoclonal protein in the serum 
or urine had 100% specificity and positive predictive 
value for ATTR-CM in patients with suspected amyloid 
cardiomyopathy. Therefore, many DLT recipients in the 
present study were thought to have no obvious amyloid 
deposition in their heart in the post-DLT period. In 
contrast, this study showed that basal LS was impaired in 
the post-DLT period. Although impaired basal LS is a 
typical finding of amyloid cardiomyopathy,19 various 
factors other than amyloid cardiomyopathy, such as coronary risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and anticancer 
drugs, affect basal LS.20–22 However, any coronary risk 
factors, the history of dialysis and the use of anticancer 
drugs had no association with impaired basal LS in the 
present study. Aging was also associated with impaired 
basal LS.23 However, there was no correlation between 
impaired basal LS and aging in the control subjects in the 
present study. In contrast, a history of DLT was significantly associated with impaired basal LS regardless of age. 
Therefore, impaired basal LS was thought to be caused by 
DLT, although many of the DLT recipients were negative 
for 99mTc-PYP. 99mTc-PYP is a useful modality to diagnose 
ATTR-CM. However, it cannot evaluate microscopic 
amyloid deposition in the heart. In contrast, LS can evaluate 
LV function accurately and is able to detect subtle regional 
and global LV dysfunction.24 Thus, the increases in 
RapLSI and the LVEF/GLS ratio in the post- compared 
with pre-DLT period in DLT recipients who did not reach 
the cut-off values for a diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy 
and impaired basal LS after DLT may indicate microscopic 
amyloid deposition in the heart that cannot be detected by 
99mTc-PYP.
Interestingly, the present study clearly demonstrated 
that the degree of impaired basal LS was significantly 
correlated with age at the time of DLT, indicating that 
older DLT recipients have more amyloid deposition. 
Misumi et al25 previously revealed that de novo amyloid 
deposition in areas other than the heart occurred earlier in 
older than younger DLT recipients. Consistent with that 
report, even in the heart, early amyloid deposition may 
occur in older DLT recipients. In general, age-related 
amyloid deposition can result from either the accelerated 
production or slowed clearance of amyloidogenic proteins. 
In the setting of TTR-related amyloidosis, reduced TTR 
clearance is presumably caused by aging because TTR 
production and serum concentrations decrease with aging.26
The present study may suggest the importance of reduced 
TTR clearance with aging for amyloid deposition even in 
DLT recipients.
This study revealed that a history of DLT was a potential 
risk for subtle cardiac dysfunction. However, DLT procedures with liver grafts from ATTRv patients are critically 
required because of the severe shortage of liver grafts. 
Thus, periodic follow-up by TTE may be important for 
these patients. Moreover, investigation of the precise clinical 
course of acquired ATTR-CM is necessary. Maurer et al27
reported the usefulness of tafamidis meglumine, a TTR 
stabilizer, for the treatment of ATTR-CM; as such, the 
usefulness of tafamidis meglumine for patients after DLT 
should be evaluated.
The present study had several limitations. First, the 
study was a single-center study. Thus, we were only able to
