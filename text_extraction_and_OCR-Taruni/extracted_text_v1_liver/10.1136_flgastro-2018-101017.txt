Background
Background The influence of Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapy for chronic hepatitis c
virus (HCV) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conflicting. Our objective was to 
determine the incidence or recurrence of HCC associated with oral DAA therapy.
Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. We 
searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase from inception to August 2017 to identify studies reporting
on HCC among patients with chronic hepatitis c virus treated with DAAs. Two independent 
reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Data were pooled by random-effects 
model. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with incidence or recurrence of 
HCC. This study is registered with PROSPERO number CRD42017057040
Results. After reviewing 2080 citations we included 8 controlled studies and 36 uncontrolled
studies. We limited the primary analysis to studies with a minimum follow up duration of 24 
weeks. The pooled proportion for incident HCC was 1.5 % [ 95% CI, 01.1% to 2.1%; I2=90.1%; 
n= 543/38177) from 18 uncontrolled studies, and 3.3% (95 % CI 1.2% to 9%; I2 =96%; n=109 
/6909) from 5 controlled studies, respectively. The pooled proportion for recurrent HCC was 
16.7% (95 % CI, 10.2% to 26%; I2=84.8 %; n=136/867) from 12 uncontrolled studies, and 
20.1% (95 % CI 5.5% to 52.1%; I2 =87.5%; n=36 /225) from 3 controlled studies, respectively. 
There was no statistically significant effect on the risk of recurrent HCC (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.16 
to 1.59; I
2 =73.4% ) in a meta-analysis of three studies. The quality of the evidence was low for 
each of the outcomes. The duration of follow-up may have been limited to detect the long-term 
risk of HCC. Conclusions. Our findings show low proportion of incident HCC, but high 
proportion of recurrent HCC on treatment with DAAs. Continued active surveillance for HCC 
after treatment with DAAs remains prudent.

Background: 
Approximately 2.7-3.9 million patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C in the US, a contributing 
cause for 19,659 deaths in 2014.1 The National Academy has set a goal of eradication of chronic 
hepatitis C by 2030 as a high priority because it is the leading cause of infectious disease 
mortality. 
The direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are considered a novel and innovative treatment for chronic 
active hepatitis C, which affects millions of people world-wide. Several randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) have established their efficacy on sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks or 
24 weeks after treatment. These agents have excellent tolerability for patients and have the 
unique ability to achieve viral clearance and maintain SVR remission. While they have the 
potential to reduce long term complications of end-stage liver disease a recent Cochrane review 
of 157 trials identified the lack of evidence on long term clinical outcomes.2 Randomized 
controlled trials have been of limited duration and are inadequately powered to assess long term 
outcomes and complications of chronic active hepatitis such as hepatocellular carcinoma.
The influence of sustained virologic response induced by oral direct acting antivirals on the risk 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with chronic hepatitis c is conflicting and is 
mainly derived from small case series and observational studies and few systematic reviews have 
rigorously and systematically evaluated this association. 3

Objective: Our objective was to determine the incidence or recurrence of HCC associated with 
oral DAA therapy among patients with chronic active hepatitis C in real world settings.\
Methods
Systematic review registration. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis 
according to a prespecified protocol. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO 2017 
CRD42017057040. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting the results. 
Eligibility criteria. Inclusions: We included any observational study including cohort and case 
control studies reporting on the association between direct acting antiviral use and incidence and 
recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The RCTs have been of limited duration and were not 
designed to measure HCC and will not be the focus of this review. A recent Cochrane review did 
not find sufficient data in the trials to inform on this outcome.2 Exclusions: We excluded case 
reports, cross sectional studies, narrative reviews and animal or pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic studies. We also excluded non-English articles, letters and those for which 
full text articles cannot be retrieved. For the analysis of incident hepatocellular carcinoma, we 
limited the sample size of uncontrolled studies to studies with sample size > 100 as smaller 
cohorts are unlikely to provide reliable estimates of the incidence of HCC, which is a rare 
outcome. We did not impose such sample size restrictions on the outcome of recurrent 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Participants. We included adult participants with chronic hepatitis C of any genotype treated 
with any of the direct acting antiviral agents alone or in combination. We did not impose any
restrictions based on Child-Pugh Curtis class and cirrhosis

7
Interventions:
We examined the following direct acting antivirals and their combinations shown in our 
protocol.
Comparators. These comprised of the group of participants not receiving DAAs. We also 
included studies in which interferon-based regimens were administered in both groups if the 
difference between the groups was the DAA or DAA combination alone. 
Outcomes. The co-primary outcomes were the incidence and recurrence of HCC as defined in 
the primary studies. We required a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment duration. We did not 
impose any lag period after exposure as the exact timing of occurrence of HCC after oral DAA 
exposure is unknown.
Systematic Searches. We searched multiple databases including Pubmed, Embase and Scopus 
using the search strategy outlined in Supporting information through August 24, 2017. An 
outline of the search strategy for PubMed is shown in the protocol. It was modified and adapted 
for various databases. Details of the search strategy for each database are shown in the 
Supporting Information, which also identifies the oral DAAs that were included. Additional 
searches were carried out by manually looking at the reference lists of included studies.
Data extraction. Studies were selected for inclusion based on the review of titles and abstracts
that were exported into a web-based data management repository (www.rayyan.qcri.org). 4 Two 
reviewers were independently involved in all stages of study selection, data extraction and 
quality assessment. All discrepancies were resolved with agreement after rechecking the source 
papers and further discussion among the reviewers with full consensus prior to inclusion. Data to 
be extracted included study design, location of the study, drug exposure, mean age of 

8
participants, duration of drug use and duration of follow-up and method of outcome 
ascertainment.
Risk of bias assessment. We used an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for 
evaluating the quality of included studies. 5 We also used the Eggers test and funnel plot to 
evaluate for publication bias. 
Data synthesis. All data were extracted into a pre-specified Excel data sheet. The unit of the 
analysis was the individual participant. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative synthesis. 
We considered reporting the results of meta-analysis when 2 or more studies could be pooled in 
the absence of both clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Examination for clinical heterogeneity 
included examination for differences in population, intervention, follow-up duration and other 
characteristics. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated using the I2statistic. We considered both 
random and fixed effects meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis of proportion to 
determine incidence and recurrence rates which were reported as pooled proportions. The 
primary analysis was focused on studies of more than 24 weeks follow up. In secondary analyses 
we pooled studies irrespective of duration of follow up. For studies with comparators we conduct 
meta-analysis using Risk ratios or odds ratio when appropriate. All analyses were conducted in 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, Englewood, NJ) and StatsDirect statistical software (England, 
StatsDirect Ltd, 2013
Strength of Evidence Rating. We also rated the strength of evidence on each of the primary 
outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation) approach using the major domains of risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, 
strength of association and publication bias.6

Ethical approval and Funding. We did not obtain ethical approval since the study was a 
systematic review of summary data. There were no sources of funding for this study.
RESULTS
Systematic search. We screened 2080 citations and identified 8 controlled studies and 36
uncontrolled studies that were eligible for inclusion. The process of study selection is shown in 
Figure 1. The baseline characteristics of the uncontrolled and controlled studies are shown in the 
Supporting Information Table 1 and Supporting Information Table 2, respectively. The 
incidence and recurrence of HCC associated with oral DAAs in controlled and uncontrolled 
studies are shown in the Supporting Information Supporting Information Table 3 and 
Supporting Information Table 4, respectively. The risk of bias of all included studies is shown 
in Supporting Information Table 5.
Study characteristics. 
There were 29 uncontrolled studies that evaluated incident HCC,7-11 12-36 while 12 studies 
reported on recurrent HCC.
9-11 14 17 29 37-42 Some studies reported on both incident and recurrent 
HCC. The uncontrolled studies encompassed a diverse range of patients, with some single-center
studies but also many other multicenter or global cohorts. Treatment durations tended to be 12-
24 weeks with different antiviral combinations in the cohorts. Follow-up was also highly varied, 
ranging from 12 weeks to 70 months. Among the 29 uncontrolled studies, 18 studies had a 
minimum follow up duration of 24 weeks. The mean age of participants in each study ranged
from about 50 years to 72 years.

10
Five controlled studies reported on incident HCC in those receiving DAA as compared to 
controls.22 38 43-45 Recurrent HCC was monitored in 3 studies, two of which were part of the 
ANRS cohort ( HEPATHER and CirviR).46 11 47The controlled observational studies were 
conducted in UK, Japan, US, and France. Treatment duration was typically 12-24 weeks, 
whereas follow-up ranged was up to 416 weeks. The average age of participants in the studies 
varied from 51 years to 73 years. A wide variety of oral DAAs were evaluated, whereas the 
control groups tended to be participants who did not have any treatment, historical controls or 
received combination of interferon and Ribavarin. 
Primary analyses
Proportion of incident HCC associated with DAAs in uncontrolled cohorts. A total of 543 
cases of HCC were reported in the 38177 participants on Oral DAAs among the 18 uncontrolled 
studies. The random effects meta-analysis of 29 studies yielded a pooled proportion of 1.5 % [ 
95% CI, 1.1%-2.1%; I2=90.1%) for incident HCC with evidence of substantial statistical 
heterogeneity among the included studies as shown in Figure 2.
Proportion of incident HCC associated with DAAs in controlled cohorts. Among 5 
controlled cohort studies the pooled proportion of patients who had incident HCC while on 
treatment with oral DAAs was 3.3% (95 % CI 1.2% to 9%; I2 =96%), with evidence of 
substantial statistical heterogeneity among the included studies as shown in Figure 3.
Proportion of recurrent HCC associated with DAAs in uncontrolled cohorts. There were
136 cases of recurrent HCC among 867 participants in 12 uncontrolled studies. The random 
effects meta-analysis of 12 studies yielded a pooled proportion of 16.7% (95 % CI 10.2% to 

11
26%; I2=84.8) with evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity among the included studies 
as shown in Figure 4. Estimates of individual studies ranged from as low as 0% (in a study that 
included only 8 participants with preexisting HCC41 to as high as 42.6%.39
Proportion of recurrent HCC associated with DAAs in controlled cohorts. There were 36 
cases of recurrent HCC among 225 participants on oral DAAs in the controlled cohort studies, 
which yielded a pooled proportion of 20.1% (95 % CI 5.5% to 52.1%; I2 =87.5 %) with evidence 
of substantial statistical heterogeneity among the included studies as shown in Figure 5.
Relative Risk of incident or recurrent HCC associated with oral DAA in controlled cohorts.
We did not conduct a meta-analysis of risk ratios or odds ratios comparing the oral DAA and 
control arms on incident HCC because of varying levels of clinical heterogeneity, follow-up and 
the choice of comparators.
22 38 43-45 Among the 5 controlled cohort studies that reported on 
incident HCC, there were 36 HCC recurrences in 225 patients having DAA, as compared to 253 
cases of HCC among 4828 control patients (5.2%). Kobayashi et al. reported no significant 
differences in newly diagnosed HCC between the DAA and IFN/RBV group at 3-year and 5-year 
follow-up. 44Similarly, Li et al. reported a hazard ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.08) for HCC in 
the DAA group as compared to IFN group.
22
Among the 3 studies that reported on recurrent HCC, 
46 11 47 there were 36 HCC recurrences 
(16%) in 225 patients having DAA, as compared to 80 recurrences (42.3%) in 189 control 
patients. The relative risk meta-analysis 46 11 47 of these showed RR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.16 to 1.59; I2
=73.4% ) for recurrent HCC which was not statistically significant as shown in Figure 6. 
Secondary analysis. 

12
Proportion of incident HCC associated with DAAs in uncontrolled cohorts irrespective of 
follow up duration
A total of 567 cases of HCC were reported in the 48 327 participants on Oral DAAs among the 
29 uncontrolled studies. The random effects meta-analysis of 29 studies yielded a pooled 
proportion of 1.2 % [ 95% CI, 0.09%-1.6%; I2=87.6%) for incident HCC with evidence of 
substantial statistical heterogeneity among the included studies as shown in Supplementary
Figure 1. The proportion varied from as low as 0.06% to 4.83% due to clinical heterogeneity 
and variation in method of and duration of follow-up. 
Sensitivity analysis. The results of the fixed effect analysis for the above outcomes are shown in 
Supplementary Table 6.
Risk of bias and GRADE assessment. Most of the studies were considered to have reliable data 
on the actual use of antiviral therapies. Selection of controls was not always well-defined and 
there were differences in the baseline variables between the DAA treated participants and the 
control group. The handling of confounding variables and statistical adjustment was poorly 
reported. Specific active ascertainment for HCC was performed in 6 controlled cohorts and 10 of 
the uncontrolled cohorts. The lack of active surveillance may result in an underestimate of the 
risk. The GRADE of evidence was designated as low for each of these outcomes because of 
imprecision of summary estimates, substantial heterogeneity, and high risk of bias.
DISCUSSION
Our findings show that the estimates for incident HCC range from ≈ 1. 5 % in uncontrolled 
cohorts to ≈ 3.8% in controlled cohorts in patients with chronic active hepatitis C. Our meta-

13
analysis shows that the estimates for recurrent HCC range from ≈ 16.7 % in uncontrolled cohorts 
to ≈ 21.7 % in controlled cohorts (Supplementary Figure 1). Assuming baseline proportions 
seen in the uncontrolled cohort studies, approximately 1 among 67 participants who use an oral
DAAs would develop incident HCC, and approximately 1 among 6 participants oral DAA users 
would develop recurrent HCC. The meta-analysis of recurrent HCC from controlled studies 
showed a ≈ 50 % reduction in the risk of HCC which was not statistically significant. The overall 
quality of the evidence was low for each of the outcomes and comparisons. In the absence of 
high quality-controlled cohorts with long term follow-up, our findings can neither confirm nor 
rule out, an increase or decrease in the risk of incident or recurrent HCC after oral DAA therapy.
Comparison with other studies. There are some similarities and differences between and our 
findings and other meta-analysis. A previous meta-analysis reported a low rate of 2.96/100 
Person-Years (95 % CI 1.76-4.96) for HCC occurrence from 9 studies and a rate of 12.16/100 
PYs / (95 % CI 5 to 29.8) for recurrent HCC from 10 studies. 3 Our database of included studies 
for the risk of HCC associated with oral DAAs was substantially larger (n=44), and we included 
participants irrespective of the stage of liver disease,
48 and also assessed HCC either as an 
adverse event or as a prespecified outcome irrespective of whether participants achieved SVR. In 
contrast, the other meta-analysis excluded patients without cirrhosis, or those who had a subset 
of cirrhosis, or those without clear delineation of HCC outcomes, and was restricted to 
participants with chronic HCV who had undergone curative treatment. Our findings should be 
interpreted in the context of the historical rates of HCC reported with untreated chronic hepatitis 
C or the risk of HCC reported with interferon-based treatments, although these populations are 
not directly comparable as patients treated with oral DAAs have more advanced liver disease as 
compared to historical interferon-based controls. Among patient chronic active hepatitis c, the 

14
rate of HCC is around 1-3% per year and higher among those with cirrhosis. In a Japanese cohort 
study, the presence of HCV antibody was associated with a more than fourfold increased risk of 
liver cancer (RR 4.09, 95 % CI 1.30 to 12.85) (age range = 40-79 years; % cirrhosis) over a 
three-year period.
49 The other meta-analysis reported incident rates for HCC occurrence 
[1.14/100 PYs [ 95% CI 0.86-1.52)] and recurrence [9.21/100 PYs (95% CI 7.18 - 11.81)] 
associated with interferon-based treatment3. Another meta-analysis of observational studies 
reported a substantial (≈ 77%) reduction in the risk of HCC with IFN-based treatments in 
patients with fibrosis and advanced liver disease compared to untreated controls. 50
The precise biological mechanisms by which oral DAA may influence the risk of HCC is 
unknown. Alterations in immunosurveillance that remove the protective effective of the hepatitis 
c virus may potentiate the risk of HCC by accelerating the process of regeneration. Studies have 
shown an increase in the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after 4 weeks of 
therapy with oral DAA therapy and alteration balance between inflammatory and antiinflammatory processes. 51 Additionally, it is possible that the immunostimulatory effects of 
interferon may have offered some protection in earlier studies. Several studies in our metaanalysis included participants who had undergone non-curative treatment of HCC, where HCC 
may reflect reactivation of residual foci of untreated HCC. The high proportion of recurrent HCC
among patients treated with oral DAAs may reflect the underlying severity of the disease being 
treated, as participants with advanced liver disease are eligible for treatment with DAAs, where 
such participants may have been ineligible for treatment with interferon-based regimens. Finally, 
ascertainment biases where some tumors which were previously undetectable were 

15
radiographically identified after treatment with oral DAAs may be another potential explanation 
of our findings. 
Limitations. Our meta-analysis has some limitations which primarily reflect the quality of 
reported data. The duration of follow-up may have been limited to detect the long-term risk of 
hepatocellular carcinoma as most of the included studies were of short duration. In the absence 
of patient-level data, we did not evaluate time to event, and determine the influence of 
geographic location, presence of genotype 1, alcohol use, concomitant hepatitis B, serum alphafetoprotein levels and stage of cirrhosis on the rate of development of HCC, as meta-regression 
based on summary data may be prone to ecological biases. 52 We cannot rule out the presence of 
length time bias because the data did not allow us to distinguish between the development of fast 
vs slow growing tumors, and distinguish between early recurrent HCC which may reflect tumor 
metastases (< 2 years) vs late development of second primary tumors (> 2 years). 53 The 
estimates for incident HCC may also reflect recurrent HCC as some studies did not clarify that 
they reliably excluded HCC at baseline. We excluded studies with < 100 participants for 
incident HCC, as these studies may be susceptible to small study effects. We did not evaluate the 
differences in rates between individual members of the class of DAAs although there are no 
biological reasons to suspect any such differences on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We 
did not include non-English studies which may have biased our estimates.
Implications. Our findings have implications for clinical practice and research. Our findings 
demonstrate that recurrent HCC is common in patients who are taking oral DAAs, and clinicians 
should therefore remain vigilant and implement regular monitoring even after achieving a 

16
sustained virologic response. Future studies should be designed with adequate follow up and 
latency as HCC occurring immediately after treatment may reflect preexisting HCC.
53
Such studies should use standardized definitions of HCC, conduct periodic surveillance using 
established radiographic protocols, and evaluate the influence of DAAs on clinical outcomes
beyond sustained virologic response. 2 Studies should also evaluate the influence of other 
variables such as presence of GT1, alcohol use, concomitant hepatitis B, serum alpha-fetoprotein 
levels and stage of cirrhosis. Study designs that incorporate the evaluate the potential therapeutic 
benefits of oral DAAs earlier during the course of chronic hepatitis C, before the development of 
advanced cirrhosis vs strategies that involve treatment with oral DAAs after the onset of more 
advanced liver disease may offer additional insight. Finally, the influence of SVR induced by 
these agents on other important patient centered outcomes such as hepatic encephalopathy, liver 
failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal 
syndrome and mortality should also be evaluated in such studies.
Conclusions. Our findings show low proportion of incident HCC, but high proportion of 
recurrent HCC on treatment with oral DAAs in patients with chronic active hepatitis C. 
Regardless of the whether high proportion of recurrence of HCC reflect the influence of the drug 
or the severity of the disease continued active surveillance for HCC after treatment remains 
prudent.
