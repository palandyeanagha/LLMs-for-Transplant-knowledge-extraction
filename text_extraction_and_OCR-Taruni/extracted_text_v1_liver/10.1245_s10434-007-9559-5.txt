Background: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the best available option for early
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its application is limited by stringent selection
criteria, costs, and deceased donor graft shortage, particularly in Asia, where living donor liver
transplant (LDLT) has been developed.
Methods: This article reviews the present standards for patient selection represented by sizeand-number criteria with particular references to Milan Criteria and novel prediction models
based on results achieved in patients exceeding those limits, with consideration of the expanded indication represented by the UCSF Criteria.
Results: The expected outcomes after deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) or LDLT
are favorable if predetermined selection criteria are applied. However, selection bias, difference in waiting time, and ischemia-regeneration injuries of the graft among DDLT vs LDLT
may influence long-term results. In the article, the differences between East and West in firstline treatments for HCC (resection vs transplantation), indications, and ethics for the donor,
are summarized as well as possible novel predictors of tumor biology (especially DNA
mutation and fractional allelic loss, FAI) to be considered for better outcome prediction.
Conclusions: Liver transplantation remains the most promising product of modern surgery
and represents a cornerstone in the management of patients with HCC.
Key Words: Hepatocellular—Hepatoma—Transplantation.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most
common cause of cancer-related death worldwide.1
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the best
therapeutic option for early, unresectable HCC, although it is limited by graft shortage and the need for
appropriate patient selection. In the late 1980s, the
results after OLT for HCC were disappointing, with
high early recurrence and 5-year survival rates ranging between 18 and 40%.
2 This discouraging experience and shortage of deceased donor grafts compelled
the transplant community to establish stringent
selection criteria to predict posttransplant survival of
HCC patients. Recognizing that patients with small,
incidentally found tumors had survival rates after liver transplantation equivalent to those after transplantation for benign disease, Mazzaferro et al. in
Milan established criteria for OLT in a landmark

study published in 1996.3 They showed that a subgroup of patients with radiologic evidence of a single
tumor £5 cm in diameter, or two to three tumors £3
cm in diameter had 5-year and recurrence-free survival rates of 75 and 83%, respectively. The Milan
criteria were subsequently adopted by the United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) staging system
for allocating organs for OLT in the United States.
OLT is limited by a shortage of deceased donor
liver grafts, particularly in Asia, where the rate of
deceased donors is negligible. To overcome this
shortage, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)
has been developed with favorable preliminary results. Other areas of study include expanding the
criteria for liver transplantation to include larger tumors, as shown by the group from the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) and molecular
profiling of HCC to improve prognostication and
patient selection.
MILAN CRITERIA FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN HCC
In the past 10 years, results of OLT have improved
steadily because of careful patient selection pioneered
by the introduction of the Conventional Milan Criteria (CMC) in 1996.3 The aim of these criteria was to
achieve a good outcome in patients who fulfilled the
criteria and avoid a poor prognosis in patients who
exceeded them. This aim was achieved by the Milan
group, who showed that the 10-year overall survival
surpassed 70% in 300 liver transplants for HCC that
fulfilled the CMC. Such good results have been
confirmed worldwide.4,5 The elements of the CMC,
namely size and number of tumors, have been shown
in multivariate analysis to be the only independent
variables predicting patient survival and tumor
recurrence, with other biological prognostic factors
playing a role only within the ‘‘size and number’’
limits (Table 1).
The successful outcome of OLT based on the CMC
has led to more patients with HCC being routed to
transplantation and an increasing number of proposals for expansion of the CMC.6,7 None of these
expanded criteria are, however, supported by a robust statistical sample size or prospective validation.
In order to investigate proposals to expand the CMC,
an unprecedented multicenter study has been conducted in 24 European centers, collecting data from
466 patients transplanted for HCC whose tumors
exceeded the CMC at posttransplant pathologic
assessment (http://www.hcc-olt-metroticket.org).5,7
The results have been plotted in a tumor size-andnumber Cartesian contour plot showing the 5-year
survival probability according to the size and number
of HCC nodules detected in the explanted liver.
Based on a preliminary analysis, a ‘‘HCC forecast
chart’’ has been developed, which can predict 5-year
posttransplant survival rates on the basis of morphological tumor characteristics (Fig. 1). It is conceivable that similar chart models obtained from
large sample sizes could replace the CMC for OLT in
patients with HCC. Unlike the CMC or expanded
proposals, which are based on tumor morphology,
these chart models can incorporate important variables for OLT in HCC, including priority score for
HCC and dropout rate based on donor availability at
different centers. Preliminary ad interim analysis
shows a significant shift of the isograms of the proposed chart depending on the presence of vascular
invasion in explant specimens, confirming the need
for reliable biological markers of important tumor
characteristics, such as vascular invasion.
MILAN VERSUS EXPANDED CRITERIA FOR
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Following the 1996 publication by the group from
Milan, using a restrictive set of criteria for OLT in
patients with HCC, excellent 5-year posttransplant
patient survival of at least 70% has been reported
from many centers.4,5 The growing experience and
success of OLT for HCC have fueled controversies
related to expansion of the Milan criteria for OLT,
since many studies have suggested that tumor stage
beyond the Milan criteria does not necessarily predict
worse survival after OLT.8,9 Among the proposed
expanded criteria, the UCSF criteria (single tumor
nodule up to 6.5 cm; or three or fewer tumors, the
largest of which is £4.5 cm with the sum of the tumor
diameters £8 cm) reflect a modest expansion of tumor

size limits beyond the Milan criteria.6 At least three
transplant experiences from Europe and the United
States, however, underlined the limitations of applicability of the UCSF criteria in the pretransplant
setting, considering that most of the patients adhering
to the UCSF were also within the Milan criteria.10–12
Even though the UCSF criteria have been independently validated in several studies, the overlapping
population of patients adhering to the UCSF but not
the Milan criteria is often negligible and estimated to
be <10% of the total transplanted population.12,13
Such a limitation was evidenced by a multicenter
study from France, in which 39 of 461 patients (8.7%)
had explanted tumors beyond the Milan but within
the UCSF criteria.10 Although the 5-year survival of
67% for patients within the UCSF criteria was
equivalent to that of the 183 patients meeting the
Milan criteria (and significantly better than the 34%
5-year survival rate among 238 patients exceeding
both criteria), the 44 patients meeting UCSF but
exceeding Milan criteria at pretransplant staging had
a 5-year survival rate of only 48%, compared with
60% observed in the 272 patients within Milan criteria and with 37% in the 121 patients beyond both
criteria.
The limitations of pretransplant imaging studies,
exemplified by tumor understaging in 20% of patients, have been a major concern for liberalizing the
existing criteria for OLT.5 The UCSF group applied
their proposed criteria according to preoperative
imaging in 138 patients over a 5-year period; the 1-
and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities were 95 and
91%, and the respective probabilities for recurrencefree survival were 91 and 80%.
14 The 106 patients
with HCC meeting the Milan criteria (T1/2) had 1-
and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities of 96 and
90%, respectively, compared with 93% at both 1 and
5 years for patients with HCC exceeding Milan but
meeting UCSF criteria (T3A). Understaging by preoperative imaging was observed in 21% of T1/2 and
28% of T3A tumors. When explant tumor stage exceeded the UCSF criteria, the 1- and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities were 79 and 61%, compared
with 98 and 97% within the UCSF criteria. Patients
meeting T3A criteria did not have a significantly
higher incidence of poorly differentiated tumor grade
or vascular invasion.
In the current era of increasing demand and
unrelenting organ shortage, the foundation of the
debate regarding expansion of the Milan criteria for
HCC may ultimately rest on what the transplant
community would consider an acceptable survival
after OLT for HCC. Some groups have proposed a
50% 5-year patient survival to be the minimum
acceptable cutoff.5 This mark may have been surpassed by the UCSF group, who have applied expanded criteria to benefit an additional 10% of
patients with HCC with respect to posttransplant
survival and tumor recurrence.
LIVING DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
FOR HCC: EASTERN EXPERIENCE
Liver transplantation offers the best chance of cure
for early unresectable HCC. However, its role has
been limited by the shortage of deceased donor liver
grafts, which is particularly severe in Asia, where the
deceased donor organ rates are fewer than 5 donors
per million population, compared with 10–35 donors
per million population in Western countries.15 In
most Asian countries, HCC is the most common
cancer and the most frequent indication for OLT,
aggravating the unmet demand for liver grafts. The
development of living donor liver transplantation
(LDLT), especially adult-to-adult right lobe liver
transplantation, has allowed more patients with HCC
to benefit from OLT.16 LDLT can theoretically provide an unlimited source of liver grafts and eliminate
the uncertainty of prolonged waiting times and the
risk of dropout due to tumor progression. However,
LDLT is a novel treatment for HCC with unresolved
issues regarding indications and results.

TRANSPLANTATION FOR HCC 1003
Ann. Surg. Oncol. Vol. 15, No. 4, 2008

Recent studies on LDLT for HCC suggest favorable long-term survival results.17,18 However, it remains unclear whether the outcome after LDLT for
HCC is equivalent to that of deceased donor liver
transplantation (DDLT). A study from a Korean
group reported similar 3-year survival rates after
LDLT and DDLT (91.4 vs 89.9%) in patients with
tumors fulfilling the Milan criteria, after excluding
perioperative mortality.13 However, others have
found significantly higher rates of tumor recurrence
after LDLT compared with DDLT for HCC.19 This
may be related to selection bias, as LDLT eliminates
the waiting period for grafts. In DDLT the waiting
period provides time for a natural selection process in
which patients with biologically more aggressive tumors drop out due to tumor progression. In addition,
the ischemic-reperfusion injury associated with smallfor-size grafts in LDLT and angiogenesis associated
with liver regeneration may theoretically promote
growth of tumors in the transplanted liver after
LDLT, although the actual clinical impact of such
biological processes remains unclear.20,21
Liver transplantation is conventionally offered to
Child-Pugh class C patients with unresectable early
HCC. Recently, there have been heated debates on
whether liver transplantation should be used as firstline therapy for Child-Pugh class A patients with
early HCC.22 While some previous studies showed
that liver transplantation for early HCC may achieve
better survival compared with resection, this may be
partly related to selection bias in favor of transplantation because patients with more aggressive tumors
drop off the waiting list for DDLT.19 Recent studies
suggest that for patients with preserved liver function
and early stage HCC, hepatic resection can achieve a
5-year survival rate of 70%, comparable to that after
OLT.13,23
The availability of grafts from dedicated live donors has been considered one of the main arguments
favoring LDLT as primary therapy for patients with
early HCC and preserved liver function. However,
even in Asian countries where LDLT is commonly
performed, up to half of the patients with early HCC
may not have suitable living donors for various reasons, including ABO-incompatibility, hepatitis serology, and patient refusal to accept living donation.18
Furthermore, the risks of donor hepatectomy, with
morbidity and mortality rates of 14–21% and 0.25–
1%, respectively, should be carefully balanced against
the benefit of LDLT.19 Risking the life of a donor for
HCC patients who have an alternative option of hepatic resection, which achieves long-term survival
equivalent to LDLT, is ethically not acceptable to
many Asian surgeons. Most Asian centers still consider resection as first-line treatment for HCC patients with preserved liver function and reserve LDLT
as an option for salvage transplantation in patients
with recurrent tumors.13,23,24
Another matter of debate in LDLT involves
expanding the indications beyond the CMC or UCSF
criteria. LDLT is currently being performed in some
Asian centers for patients with HCC beyond the
Milan criteria, with results that are expectedly worse
than those for patients within the Milan criteria.13,17
Some transplant surgeons argue that despite the
poorer results, LDLT for advanced HCC may be
justified, since donors voluntarily accept the risks of
donor hepatectomy to dedicate a graft for HCC patients, who may otherwise have no effective treatment
options. However, others argue that the medical
profession should not relegate the issue to individual
donor autonomy.25 With the lack of clear data
showing benefits of LDLT for advanced HCC, the
medical community should take a conservative moral
stand and limit the use of LDLT for HCC that meets
the same criteria as DDLT.
LIVING DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
FOR HCC: WESTERN EXPERIENCE
Over the past 10 years, LDLT has developed as an
alternative to DDLT because of the scarcity of deceased donor livers. Patient survival after LDLT is
similar to that after DDLT, despite data from the
UNOS database showing lower post-LDLT graft
survival, possibly due to the learning curve for LDLT
and lower graft-to-recipient body weight ratio.26 In
the United States, enthusiasm for LDLT peaked in
2001, when more than 500 LDLTs were performed;
the aftermath of a widely-publicized donor death in
2002 led to a nationwide retrenchment, with no more
than 325 procedures per year since then. Nevertheless, LDLT has an important role in the treatment of
HCC. While previously there was concern over possible tumor stimulation due to regeneration after
LDLT, it appears that the type of graft (living vs
deceased donor) has little, if any, impact on postOLT tumor progression.
Typically, LDLT results in a liver graft that is
smaller than the expected liver volume of the recipient. The outcome of a relatively small donor organ depends not only on graft size but also on the
recipients preoperative degree of liver failure and
portal hypertension. Compared with patients awaiting transplant for end-stage cirrhosis, candidates with
1004 V. MAZZAFERRO ET AL.
Ann. Surg. Oncol. Vol. 15, No. 4, 2008

HCC generally have better-preserved liver function
and less portal hypertension, and are thus better able
to tolerate a small graft.
Ready availability is the most important advantage
of LDLT for HCC. Posttransplant tumor recurrence is
tied to pretransplant tumor stage; progression of tumor while awaiting transplant can only worsen the
prognosis. This fact is reflected in the United States
allocation scheme for deceased donor livers, which
accords priority to patients with HCC meeting the
Milan criteria. Since adoption of the Model of EndStage Liver Disease organ allocation policy in 2002,
candidates with T2 HCC (1 nodule between 2 and 5 cm;
or 2–3 nodules, all £3 cm) have enjoyed priority such
that in many regions of the United States, waiting times
are short, obviating the need for LDLT.27 In some
regions, however, longer waiting times and attendant
higher dropout rates support the use of LDLT in cases
of HCC within the Milan criteria.
The Milan criteria were adopted because they identify a subgroup of candidates with HCC for whom
transplant results are similar to those in patients
transplanted for end-stage cirrhosis without HCC. It is
widely recognized, however, that many patients with
HCC beyond the Milan criteria can be cured by
OLT.8,9 In the United States, adoption of expanded
priority criteria for DDLT, as proposed by the UCSF
group, is currently under consideration. LDLT can be
undertaken in candidates who do not meet criteria for
waiting list priority. Broadening criteria based on tumor size and number will inevitably lead to more
recurrence; nevertheless, Roayaie et al. demonstrated
55% freedom from recurrence at 5 years in patients
transplanted with HCC between 5 and 7 cm and no
macroscopic vascular invasion.28 Based on data such
as these, many centers offer LDLT to patients with
HCC meeting expanded criteria that are estimated to
yield a 5-year survival of approximately 50%.
5
SELECTION IN HCC: BIOLOGY OR MORPHOLOGY
The distinction between biology and morphology in
simple terms can be described as behavior versus
appearance. Ultimately, the behavior of HCC is the
final deciding factor on patient outcome. The ability to
predict the biology of HCC is desperately needed for
patient selection in OLT. The current staging criteria
for HCC takes into account tumor morphology but
not tumor biology, with transplantable stages stratified
according to tumor size and number. For treatment
options other than liver transplantation (i.e., liver
resection, chemotherapy, and cytoablative therapies),
tumor morphology as described by the pathological
TNM staging system is reasonably adequate. For liver
transplantation, however, gross and microscopic
morphology are inadequate for predicting outcomes
because of the scarcity of the donor organs that must be
judiciously allocated. The issue would be less significant if resources were unlimited.
Ideally, the TNM or morphology-based staging
system would be able to stratify patients into homogeneous groups with the same outcomes. However,
the current staging systems are not precise enough to
segregate patients with HCC and cirrhosis into such
homogeneous groups. As almost all patients with
gross invasion of the hepatic venous system, positive
lymph nodes, or metastatic disease experience recurrence and are therefore not candidates for transplantation, the N and M components of the TNM
classification can immediately be eliminated from the
organ allocation scheme. This leaves only the T
component upon which we can base our biological
prediction, namely tumor size and number.
In our efforts to refine our current staging systems,
morphological or chemical factors have been studied,
including microscopic vascular invasion, encapsulation, plasma albumin mRNA, and serum alphafetoprotein.5 To date, however, none of these have
improved upon the current systems. Part of the
problem has been radiologic techniques are not yet
sufficient to perfectly define tumor number and size
and will never be able to determine microscopic
vascular invasion. Moreover, many new staging systems require pretreatment biopsy, which poses a
small but real risk of tumor seeding.
To understand the biological behavior and identify
genes associated with survival after OLT, Marsh and
colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh performed
microdissection on explanted tissue and studied DNA
mutations near 9 tumor-associated gene loci to create
an index of cumulative mutational damage, termed
the fractional allelic imbalance (FAI).29,30 They
found that FAI and vascular invasion were the
strongest independent predictors of tumor-free survival. Thus, incorporation of gene mutational data
allows desegregation of HCC patients from imprecise, morphology-based staging systems and allows
improved prognostication.
CONCLUSIONS
While patients with early resectable HCC and
preserved hepatic function should undergo surgical
TRANSPLANTATION FOR HCC 1005

resection, in those with unresectable disease due to
underlying liver dysfunction, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) offers the best chance for cure. In
the past 10 years, results of OLT have steadily improved because of careful patient selection pioneered
by the introduction of the Milan criteria in 1996.
Supported by studies showing that many patients
with tumor stage beyond the Milan criteria can be
cured by OLT, a number of expanded criteria have
been proposed. While expanding the criteria for OLT
allows more patients to be eligible for transplantation, arguments against expanding the criteria include
the increased risk of vascular invasion and tumor
recurrence at higher stages of HCC. The principal
limitation of OLT for HCC is the shortage of deceased donor living grafts, especially in Asia. The
development of LDLT has allowed more patients to
benefit from OLT with favorable preliminary survival
results. Given the shortage of organs available for
OLT and lack of predictive power of currently used
staging systems, improved prognostic tools are needed to predict outcomes after OLT. Molecular
markers of cancer progression may add significant
discriminatory power to the current staging systems
and may improve organ allocation schemes for patients with HCC.
