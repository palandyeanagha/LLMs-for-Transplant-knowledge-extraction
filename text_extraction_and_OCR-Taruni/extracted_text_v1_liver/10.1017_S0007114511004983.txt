Abstract
Studies in animals and human subjects indicate that gut-derived bacterial endotoxins may play a critical role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the present study, we investigated if the liver is also sensitised by other microbial components
during the onset of fructose-induced steatosis in a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were either fed with 30 % fructose solution or tap water
(control) with or without antibiotics for 8 weeks. Expression of toll-like receptors (TLR)1–9, TNF-a, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), myeloid
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and number of F4/80 positive cells in the liver were assessed. Occludin protein, DNA of microbiota in the
small and large intestine and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) in plasma were analysed using Western blot, DNA fingerprinting and ELISA,
respectively. F4/80 positive cells were determined by immunohistochemistry. The accumulation of TAG found in the livers of fructose-fed
mice was associated with a significant induction of TLR 1–4 and 6–8. Plasma RBP4 concentration and hepatic mRNA expression levels of
TNF-a, iNOS, MyD88 and number of F4/80 positive cells of fructose-fed animals were significantly higher than those of controls; however,
these effects of fructose were attenuated in antibiotic-treated mice. Whereas protein concentration of occludin was lower in the duodenum
of fructose-treated mice, no systematic alterations of microbiota were found in this part of the intestine. Taken together, these data support
the hypothesis that (1) an increased intestinal translocation of microbial components and (2) an increased number of F4/80 positive cells and
induction of several TLR and dependent pathways (e.g. MyD88 and iNOS) may be involved in the onset of fructose-induced NAFLD.
Key words: Toll-like receptor: Fructose: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Occludin
During the last three decades, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) has advanced to be among the most common liver
diseases worldwide. NAFLD usually develops in a setting of
obesity and insulin resistance(1) and comprises a continuum
of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis
and cirrhosis. Herein, steatosis is the earliest and most
common type of NAFLD and has long been thought to be a
relatively benign state of liver injury. However, in more
recent years, it became clear that fatty livers are more vulnerable to injury from various causes(2) and can progress to steatohepatitis, increasing the probability of further liver-related
morbidity and mortality(3). Despite the fact that NAFLD is a
common cause of chronic liver disease(4,5), the optimal treatment for NAFLD and strategies to prevent the onset and progression of NAFLD have not yet been established. A better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development
of the early stages of NAFLD (e.g. steatosis) might add not only
to therapies preventing steatosis but may also add to the development of strategies to prevent the progression of the disease.
Due to its anatomical links to the gut, the liver is constantly
exposed to gut-derived bacterial products and functions at
first line of defence. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages
of the liver, have been shown to be able to efficiently take
up endotoxin and phagocytose bacteria carried through the
portal vein, thereby playing a major role in the protection against systemic bacterial infection (for an overview, see
Mencin et al.(6)). Through pattern recognition receptors
(e.g. toll-like receptors (TLR)), immune cells like Kupffer
cells recognise molecular patterns, which are expressed in
pathogens(7). In the healthy liver, mRNA expression of TLR
such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 and
TLR10 is low in comparison to other organs. It has been proposed that the low expression of TLR signalling molecules
may contribute to the high tolerance of the liver to TLR ligands
from the intestinal microbiota to which the liver is constantly
exposed. In recent years, the specific ligands of these TLR
have begun to be better characterised: thus, TLR2 is essential
for the recognition of microbial lipopeptides and TLR1 and

6 combined with TLR2 distinguish the subtle differences
between triacyl- and diacyllipopeptides(8). TLR3 is involved
in the recognition of viral double-stranded RNA and TLR5
recognises bacterial flagellin(9,10). TLR4 recognises lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria(11). TLR7 and
TLR8 bind viral single-stranded RNA(12). Lastly, TLR9 recognises bacterial and viral DNA-containing unmethylated
cytidine phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs(13). The interaction
of TLR with their ligands results in an activation of myeloid
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and/or interferon regulatory
factor 3 and 7 and subsequently through the activation of
nuclear transcription factors to the release of numerous proinflammatory mediators such as TNFa, which in turn can
induce liver injury and fibrosis (for overviews, see Mencin
et al.(6), Nagata et al.(14) and Nagy(15)). However, whether the
liver is also sensitised by other microbial components besides
bacterial endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria
during the onset of fructose-induced NAFLD has not yet
been determined.
Results of recent human studies suggest that besides a
diet rich in fat, the intake of sugar, and herein particularly
fructose, may be a risk factor for the development of steatosis
(for an overview, see Spruss & Bergheim(16)), but may be even
more so for the progression of NAFLD to later stages of the
disease (e.g. fibrosis)(17). The hypothesis that the intake of
carbohydrates, and particularly of the mono- and disaccharides fructose and sucrose, might play a critical role in the
development of NAFLD is also supported by a number of
studies performed in animals(18–21). Indeed, in these studies
performed in rodents, it was shown that an increased consumption of fructose (e.g. up to 60 % of daily energy derived
from fructose) may result in increased lipid accumulation
in the liver, elevated plasma TAG levels and oxidative
stress(18–21). It was further shown that chronic intake of
fructose may lead to insulin resistance. Indeed, markers for
insulin resistance like retinol binding protein 4 and TNFa
were found to be markedly higher in plasma of fructose-fed
mice than in controls(22). Furthermore, we recently showed
that the development of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis is
associated with a partial loss of the tight junction protein
occludin in the upper parts of the small intestine and an
increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin(23). Similar
alterations were not found in mice exposed to a 30 % glucose
solution(20,23). In these studies, we further found that the
concomitant treatment of mice with antibiotics or the loss of
the endotoxin receptor, TLR-4, both markedly attenuated the
development of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis(20,22). In
fructose-fed TLR-4-mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice, hepatic steatosis
was significantly reduced in comparison to fructose-fed
wild-type mice, even though portal endotoxin levels were
similar in both groups(22). This protective effect of the loss
of TLR-4 was accompanied by decreased lipid-peroxidation,
MyD88 and TNFa levels(22).
However, whether alterations of the intestinal microbiota or
direct effects of fructose on the intestinal barrier are involved
in the increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin and if
other TLR besides TLR4 may also be involved in the onset
of fructose-induced NAFLD have not yet been clarified.
Starting from this background, the aim of the present study
was to determine (1) if the chronic intake of fructose results
in alterations of intestinal microbiota and (2) if the abundance
of other TLR in the liver besides TLR4 is also affected by
chronic exposure to fructose.
Materials and methods
Animals and treatments
C57BL/6J-mice (6 to 8 weeks old) (Janvier S.A.S., Le Genest
Saint Isle, France) were housed in a pathogen-free barrier
facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All procedures
were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Additionally to normal chow, C57BL/6J mice
were either fed with 30 % fructose solution (F) or with plain
tap water (control; C) for 8 weeks. In this model, total
energy intake was higher in fructose-fed mice compared to
water-fed controls (P,0·05 as tested with Mann–Whitney U
test; fructose-fed mice: about 17 %); however, weight gain of
control animals and mice fed with fructose did not differ, as
absolute weight gain varied considerably between
groups(20). Some fructose-fed animals (F þ AB) as well as
control mice (C þ AB) were additionally treated with a combination of the two antibiotics polymyxin B (92 mg/kg body
weight) and neomycin (216 mg/kg body weight). At the time
of killing, portions of liver tissue were frozen immediately in
liquid N2 and stored at 2808C, while others were frozenfixed in Tissue Tekw O.C.T.e compound (Sakura Finetek
Europe, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) for subsequent sectioning and mounting on microscope slides. Data
representing liver steatosis (e.g. liver: body weight ratio,
hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic TAG concentration)
have been published before(20) and are not further detailed
in the present study.
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue samples by a
guanidium thiocyanate-based method (peqGOLD TriFast;
Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically and after a DNase digestion
step (Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany), 1mg total RNA was
reverse transcribed using an Moloney murine leukaemia
virus (MuLV) RT and oligo (dT) primers (Fermentas). Primers
for TLR1–9, TNF-a, iNOS, MyD88, F4/80 and b-actin were
designed using Primer 3 (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research, Cambridge, MA, USA; Table 1). Sybrw Green Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany) was used to prepare the PCR mix. Primers were
added to a final concentration of 300 nM. The amplification
reactions were carried out in an iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Munich, Germany) with an initial hold step (958C for 3 min)
and fifty cycles of a three-step PCR (958C for 15 s, 608C for
30 s, 728C for 30 s). The fluorescence intensity of each
sample was measured at each temperature change to monitor
amplification of the target gene. The comparative CT method

was used to determine the amount of target, normalised to an
endogenous reference (b-actin) and relative to a calibrator
(22DDCt
). The purity of PCR products was verified by melting
curves and gel electrophoresis.
Immunostaining of F4/80 in liver tissue
To determine F4/80 positive cells, a marker of macrophages,
paraffin-embedded liver sections (5 mm) were deparaffinased
and rehydrated in ethanol solutions with decreasing concentrations. Liver tissue was stained for F4/80 by blocking slides
with 10 % bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0·1% Tween
20 (PBST; Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany)
for 30 min, washing with PBST and an overnight incubation
with a monoclonal primary antibody solution (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) in a humidified chamber at 48C. Liver sections
were washed and incubated with a biotinylated rabbit
polyclonal secondary antibody to rat IgG (Abcam). Peroxidase
was linked by incubating slides with streptavidine-horse
radish peroxidase (HRP) (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). To
detect specific binding of F4/80 antibody tissue sections
were incubated with diaminobenzidine (DAKO). The numbers of F4/80 positive cells were counted. Data from eight
fields (630x, Axio Vert 200M; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) of each
tissue section were used to determine means.
Retinol binding protein 4 determination
Plasma retinol binding protein 4 concentrations were
determined using a commercially available ELISA (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Western blot
To obtain samples of duodenal, ileal and colonic protein,
snap-frozen samples of tissue obtained from the duodenum, ileum and colon were homogenised in peqGOLD
TriFast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and protein was
isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein
lysates (10–30 mg protein/well) were separated in a
10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybonde-P
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amershan Biosciences,
Freiburg, Germany). The resulting blots were then probed
with antibodies against occludin (Zymed, San Francisco, CA,
USA) and bands were visualised using a Super Signal Western
Dura kit (Pierce; Perbio Science, Rockford, IL, USA). To ensure
equal loading, all blots were stained with Ponceau red; signals
of occludin were normalised to b-actin, which was detected
using a commercially available antibody (New England
Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Protein bands were analysed
densitometrically using Fluorchem Software (Alpha Innotech,
San Leandro, CA, USA).
Fingerprinting of bacterial DNA
Total bacterial DNA was isolated from the duodenum, ileum
and colon using a commercially available kit (QIAamp DNA
Stool Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 16S ribosomal
DNA (rDNA) was amplified using PCR with primers (16S
27F: 50
-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-30; 16S 1492R:
50
-TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-30), which are specific
for bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. PCR was performed by
using a polymerase master-mix (F-508; Finnzymes, Espoo,
Finland). The amplification reactions were carried out in a
thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with an initial hold step
(958C for 10 min), thirty-five cycles of a three-step PCR (948C
for 30 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 1 min) and a final hold step
(728C for 10 min). The purity of PCR products was verified
by gel electrophoresis. PCR products (20 ml) were digested
with 9 U of either Dde I
(24) (New England Biolabs), Alu I
or Rsa I
(25) (Fermentas) at 378C for 1·5 h and subsequently
inactivated by an incubation at 658C for 20 min. The length
of the DNA fragments was determined with a chip-based
(HT DNA 5k LabChip Kit; Caliper Life Sciences, Mainz,
Germany) microfluidic capillary electrophoresis (LabChip
GX; Caliper) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cluster analyses were performed using BioNumerics software
(Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). Pearson’s
similarity coefficient analysis and the unweighted pair-group
methods with arithmetic means were used to establish the
type of dendrogram.

Statistical analyses
All results are given as means with their standard errors. ANOVA
(one-way ANOVA) with the consequent post hoc test of Tukey
was applied for the determination of significance levels
(Graph Pad Prism Version 4.00; GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA). Value distributions within the single groups
were checked for homogeneity of variances (Bartlett’s test) to
meet the requirements for applicability of ANOVA. Post hoc
testing was done when the means were significantly different
in ANOVA. TheMann–Whitney U test wasused where appropriate to determine differences between two groups. Differences
were considered as significant if the P value was ,0·05.
Results
In previous studies, we found that chronic intake of F for
8 weeks resulted in a marked lipid accumulation in the
liver(20). The increased lipid accumulation was also associated
with significantly higher plasma levels of the insulin resistance
marker retinol binding protein 4 (about 1·5-fold, P,0·05).
Similar effects of the fructose feeding were not found in
mice concomitantly treated with antibiotics.
Effect of chronic fructose intake on protein levels of
occludin in the small and large intestine
Protein levels of the tight junction protein occludin were
significantly lower in the duodenum of mice exposed chronically to fructose (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a similar effect on
occludin protein levels was not found in the ileum or colon
of fructose-fed animals (Fig. 1). However, when comparing
water controls, protein levels of occludin were found to be
markedly lower in these regions of the gastrointestinal tract
in comparison to the duodenum (Fig. 1).
Effect of fructose intake on intestinal microbiota in the
duodenum, ileum and colon
As the results of others suggest that patients with NAFLD
more frequently have bacterial overgrowth than controls(26),
we determined if the chronic intake of fructose was associated
with alterations of the microbiota in the duodenum, ileum and
colon of mice using DNA-fingerprinting. Results are summarised in Figs. 2–4. As was to be expected in the duodenum,
concentration of bacterial 16S rDNA was low regardless of
the feeding regimen. Nevertheless, when analysing digested
16S rDNA samples using microfluidic capillary electrophoresis,
a specific band pattern was found in five out of six fructosefed mice and four out of six water-fed controls. However,
cluster analysis of bands revealed no group-specific patterns
between groups (Fig. 2). In contrast, in samples obtained
from the ileum, a similarity regarding band patterns was
found between most fructose-fed animals (Fig. 3). Furthermore, DNA band patterns of fructose-fed mice differed
markedly from that of water-fed controls in the ileum. Interestingly, a similar effect was not found when samples obtained
from the colon were analysed (Fig. 4). The intestinal microbiota was not analysed in mice that had been treated with
non-absorbable antibiotics to ‘sterilise’ the gut, as the
number of colony-forming units in faeces obtained from
these animals was markedly lower than in water controls
(about 2 90 %; data not shown); and we therefore did not

expect any detectable band patterns of restricted bacterial
16S rDNA in the duodenum or ileum.
Effect of the treatment with antibiotics on the expression of
toll-like receptor, myeloid differentiation factor 88, F4/80
and macrophage number in the liver of fructose-fed mice
To clarify if the increased accumulation of fat in the liver(20)
was also associated with increases in the expression of
different TLR in the liver, we determined expression levels
of TLR1–9 in whole liver homogenate of those mice that
were used in our previous study(20) (Fig. 5). Indeed, not
only expression of the bacterial endotoxin receptor TLR4
but also expression levels of TLR 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8
were significantly induced by about 2–4-fold in livers of
mice chronically exposed to the F in comparison to water
controls. Similar changes were not found for TLR 5 and
9 mRNA expression. The increased expression levels of
TLR (Fig. 5) and MyD88 (Fig. 6(a)) found in livers
of fructose-fed mice were associated with a markedly
increased mRNA expression of the macrophage marker
F4/80 (Fig. 7(c)) and an increased number of macrophages
as determined by staining of F4/80 (Fig. 7(a) and (b)).

treated with the non-resorbable antibiotics neomycin and
polymyxin B, which both destroy Gram-negative bacteria
as also Gram-positive bacteria, not only hepatic fat accumulation was markedly suppressed(20) but also expression
of the different TLR (Fig. 5), their adaptor protein MyD88
(Fig. 6(a)), and F4/80 (Fig. 7(c)) and the numbers of F4/80
positive cells were reduced almost to the level of water
controls (Fig. 7(a) and (b)).
Effect of the antibiotic treatment on TNFa and inducible

expression found in the liver after chronic fructose exposure
(Fig. 6(b) and (c)).

Discussion
Results of several studies in human subjects and animals
suggest that an increased dietary intake of fructose may be a
risk factor in the development of NAFLD(27–29). Indeed, a
recent study in US patients suggests that an increased consumption of fructose may even increase the risk of developing
fibrosis(17). Results of a small pilot study performed in patients
with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis suggest that a reduction of
fructose intake may exert beneficial effects on the progression
of this disease in humans(30). Similar to what was found for the
development of alcoholic liver disease (for an overview, see
Arteel(31)), results of our own group obtained in animal studies
suggest that an increased translocation of bacterial endotoxins
subsequently leading to a TLR-4-dependent activation of
hepatic Kupffer cells may contribute significantly to the development of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis in mice(20,23,22).
In animal models of alcoholic liver disease, it has been
shown that other TLR besides TLR4 in the liver may also be
involved in the development of steatosis(32). Whether other
TLR besides TLR4 in the liver are also affected by the chronic
intake of fructose and whether alterations of the microbiota in
the intestine are associated with the onset of fructose-induced
steatosis has not yet been clarified. In the present study, by
feeding mice with a moderately fructose-enhanced diet (e.g.
30 % fructose in drinking solutions) and concomitantly treating
them with non-resorbable antibiotics, we further tested the
hypothesis that the liver is also sensitised by other microbial

free fructose), this model can serve to identify potential mechanisms involved in the onset of NAFLD and as a screening tool
for new therapies. In mice chronically exposed to fructose,
mRNA expression of TLR 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 in the liver
was markedly higher than in controls. Interestingly, a similar
effect was not found for TLR 5 and 9. The lack of induction
of these two TLR may have resulted from a lack of a sufficient
concentration of inducers (e.g. flagellin, unmethylated CpG
motifs). However, the mechanisms involved in the lack of
induction of these TLR need to be addressed in future studies.
Furthermore, expression of the TLR-adaptor protein MyD88,
which has been shown before to be involved in the
rapid activation of NFkB and the subsequent increase of
TNFa expression(33,34) upon activation of TLR, was markedly
higher in fructose-fed mice. In line with these findings,
expression of iNOS and TNFa was also induced in livers of
mice fed chronically with fructose in comparison to water
controls. However, the degree of induction found for the
latter was markedly higher than that found for MyD88
mRNA expression. This apparent discrepancy might have
resulted from differences in the efficacy of the PCR-assay or
that MyD88 signalling is not only regulated by its expression
but also by its protein/phosphorylation status. The markedly
higher levels of TLR as also iNOS and TNFa mRNA expression
were associated with an increased number of F4/80 positive
cells, indicating that the number of macrophages, be it Kupffer
cells or infiltrating macrophages, was increased in mice fed
fructose. This is in line with the findings of Kohli et al.(35),
who found more macrophages in the livers of mice fed a
high-fat and high-fructose diet in comparison to high-fat-fed
animals. It was further recently reported by Ueberham
et al.(36) that mice fed a choline-deficient, ethioninesupplemented diet, which was shown before by other
groups to induce NAFLD(37), display an increased number of
F4/80 positive cells in the liver. The results of this study further
suggest that these F4/80 positive cells were Kupffer cells rather
than infiltrating macrophages. However, whether in the present study, the enhanced number of F4/80 positive cells are
infiltrating macrophages or proliferated Kupffer cells remains
to be determined. Interestingly, in fructose-fed mice concomitantly treated with antibiotics, not only hepatic lipid accumulation was reduced(20), but also expression of all TLR studied
as well as MyD88, iNOS and TNFa were at the levels of controls. In addition, the numbers of F4/80 positive cells were at
the level of controls. Taken together, these data support the
hypothesis that (1) an increased intestinal translocation of
bacterial endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria and
other microbial components and (2) an increased number
of F4/80 positive cells as well as higher concentration of
TLR and induction of dependent pathways (e.g. MyD88 and
iNOS) may be involved in the onset of fructose-induced
NAFLD. Our findings by no means precluded that fructose
may also lead to hepatic steatosis through mechanisms
depending on its insulin-independent metabolism (e.g.
through bypassing the main rate-limiting step in glycolysis
(for an overview, also see Basciano et al.(38))) in the liver;
rather our data suggest that chronic intake of certain
sugars (e.g. fructose) may at least in part contribute to the

development of the early phase of NAFLD through mechanisms involving an increased translocation of microbial components of intestinal origin.
How does chronic intake of fructose lead to an increased
translocation of intestinal microbial components?
Results of animal studies of our own group(23) and those of
others groups(39,40) suggest that the increased translocation
of bacterial endotoxin and activation of TLR-4-dependent
pathways in the liver found in mice displaying hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis are associated with an increased intestinal
permeability and a marked loss of tight junction proteins in
the intestine. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that
patients with NAFLD have an increased intestinal permeability
and that these alterations are not only associated with a higher
prevalence of small intestine bacterial overgrowth but also
lower levels of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1
in the duodenum(41). In the present study, protein levels of
the tight junction protein occludin were found to be markedly
lower in the duodenum of mice chronically exposed to fructose in comparison to water controls, whereas similar changes
were not found in lower parts of the small intestine (e.g. ileum)
or colon. Furthermore, it has been suggested by studies in
human subjects that NAFLD is associated at least in some
patients with small intestine bacterial overgrowth(41,26). In
line with these findings, changes in the composition of the
bacterial flora have been discussed to be associated not
only with the development of obesity (for an overview, see
Cani & Delzenne(42)), but also the onset of fat-induced
NAFLD in mice(40). In the present study, no systematic differences of DNA band patterns were found between controls or
fructose-fed animals in the duodenum or colon. However,
band patterns of 16 s rDNA samples obtained from the ileum
of fructose-fed animals were markedly different from those
of water controls. Taken together, these data suggest that
chronic intake of fructose is associated with a marked
reduction of the protein concentration of the tight junction
protein occludin in the duodenum but no changes in the composition of the microbiota in this part of the intestine. These
findings are also supported by earlier findings of our group
in which we showed that both chronic intake of glucose
and fructose can lead to increased portal endotoxin levels
and subsequently hepatic steatosis when the concentration
of the tight junction protein occludin in the duodenum is
decreased(23). These results also suggest that certain components of the diet (e.g. fructose) may affect tight junction
proteins in the intestine directly, subsequently leading to an
increased permeability. However, mechanisms involved in
the nutrition-dependent regulation of tight junction proteins
remain to be determined.
Conclusion
Taken together, our data further support the hypothesis
that a diet rich in fructose may at least in part add to the
onset of NAFLD through mechanisms involving an increased
translocation of intestinal microbial components, altered

concentration of TLR and activation of TLR-dependent signalling pathways. Our data further suggest that fructose may alter
intestinal permeability through altering tight junction proteins
(e.g. occludin) in the duodenum directly rather than altering
intestinal microbiota composition. However, additional studies
will be necessary to further explore the underlying mechanism
and possible resulting therapeutic and prevention strategies.
