Abstract
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inborn errors of ammonia detoxification/arginine synthesis due to defects affecting the
catalysts of the Krebs-Henseleit cycle (five core enzymes, one activating enzyme and one mitochondrial ornithine/
citrulline antiporter) with an estimated incidence of 1:8.000. Patients present with hyperammonemia either shortly after
birth (~50%) or, later at any age, leading to death or to severe neurological handicap in many survivors. Despite the
existence of effective therapy with alternative pathway therapy and liver transplantation, outcomes remain poor. This
may be related to underrecognition and delayed diagnosis due to the nonspecific clinical presentation and insufficient
awareness of health care professionals because of disease rarity. These guidelines aim at providing a trans-European
consensus to: guide practitioners, set standards of care and help awareness campaigns. To achieve these goals, the
guidelines were developed using a Delphi methodology, by having professionals on UCDs across seven European
countries to gather all the existing evidence, score it according to the SIGN evidence level system and draw a series of
statements supported by an associated level of evidence. The guidelines were revised by external specialist consultants,
unrelated authorities in the field of UCDs and practicing pediatricians in training. Although the evidence degree did
hardly ever exceed level C (evidence from non-analytical studies like case reports and series), it was sufficient to guide
practice on both acute and chronic presentations, address diagnosis, management, monitoring, outcomes, and
psychosocial and ethical issues. Also, it identified knowledge voids that must be filled by future research. We believe
these guidelines will help to: harmonise practice, set common standards and spread good practices with a positive
impact on the outcomes of UCD patients.

Introduction
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inborn errors of nitrogen
detoxification/arginine synthesis due to defects in the urea
cycle enzymes (Figure 1), carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1
(CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate
synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase
1 (ARG1), leading to respective deficiencies (abbreviated
CPS1D, OTCD, ASSD, ASLD and ARG1D; corresponding
MIM numbers, #237300, #311250; #215700; #207900;
#207800 respectively). They also encompass deficiencies of
N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) (MIM #237310), associated with lack of the N-acetylglutamate (NAG) essential
activator of CPS1 and of the mitochondrial ornithine/citrulline antiporter (ORNT1), causing the hyperornithinemiahyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
(MIM #238970). The prevalence of these disorders may
exceed the current estimates (1:8,000-1:44,000 births [1-3],

for all UCDs jointly) because of unreliable newborn
screening and underdiagnosis of fatal cases. Clinical features are typical in complete deficiencies, which present
with hyperammonemic coma a few days after birth with
~50% mortality [4-7], whereas the survivors experience severe developmental delay and recurrent hyperammonemic
crises [4-7]. Even in partial deficiencies, which have more
variable clinical presentations and later onset (any age),
there is increased risk of premature death [5,8]. The duration and severity of hyperammonemia strongly correlates
with brain damage [6,9,10]; prompt diagnosis and treatment of UCD is essential in order to optimise the outcome. [11]. However, the rarity of UCDs prevents single
centres or even countries to have all the expertise for
evidence-based management. Therefore, we have developed consensus guidelines based on the highest available
level of evidence, by pooling all the published evidence and
experience of leading centres from several European countries, to help standardise, systematise and harmonise across
Europe the diagnosis, therapy, procedures and management
of UCDs. These guidelines, developed with the Delphi
methodology are intended to be used by metabolic specialists, pediatricians, dietitians, neonatologists, intensive care
specialists, adult physicians, neurologists, nurses, psychologists and pharmacists involved in the care of UCD patients.
Excluded from these guidelines because of insufficient
European experience, or of tangential relationship with
UCDs are: citrin deficiency (citrullinemia type 2, MIM
#605814 and #603471), lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI,
MIM #222700), deficiencies of pyrroline 5-carboxylate
synthetase (MIM #610652) and ornithine aminotransferase
deficiency (OAT, MIM #258870), despite the fact that they
may cause hyperammonemia.

pediatric metabolic specialists (S. Baumgartner [Innsbruck, retired after the first meeting], AB, AC, CDV, S.
Grünewald, [London, retired after the first meeting], JH
[chairman], DK, ML [secretary], DM, PS, VV), a medical
biochemist (VR), a psychologist (MH), a specialist metabolic dietitian (MD), a metabolic specialist caring for
adult patients (AS) and a neuroradiologist (NB). Each
meeting was supervised by a moderator (P. Burgard, Heidelberg [first meeting] and RS) who oversaw the discussion but did not contribute to the content. In the initial
working meeting the GDG was trained on standardising
literature evaluation and working groups focusing on
specific topics were formed. Thereafter GDG members
discussed and performed systematic literature review and
drafted the guidelines. These drafts were further
reviewed by external specialists on intensive care (L.
Dupic, Paris), genetics (A. Gal, Hamburg), child neurology (A. Garcia-Cazorla, Barcelona), nephrology (S.
Picca, Rome), liver transplantation (J. de Ville de Goyet,
Rome), epidemiology (A. Tozzi, Rome) and ethics (C.
Rehmann-Sutter, Basel) and a patient group representative
(S. Hannigan, London). After further recommendations/
comments by three highly renowned external reviewers (C.
Bachmann, Bottmingen; J.V. Leonard, Oxford and H. Ogier,
Paris), the final version of the guidelines was written and its
applicability pilot-tested by non-specialist pediatricians in
training, with subsequent review and revision by the GDG.
The guidelines will be sent for endorsement to all European
societies for inherited metabolic diseases.
Systematic literature review and evidence grading
The guidelines evidence base was collected according to
the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN,
http://www.sign.ac.uk). Systematic literature review encompassing from each disease description until early 2011
was carried out using mainly Medline, Embase, the
Cochrane Library, MedLink, and Orphanet. Searches also
included websites of societies and parents groups for inborn errors. Relevant papers were evaluated by at least
two GDG members before considering conclusions as
evidence.
Evidence levels were classified in accordance with the
SIGN methodology:
"Evidence level & criteria"
1++ High quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of
randomized control trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very
low risk of bias.
1+ Well conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of
RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias.
1- Meta-analyses, systematic reviews or RCTs, or RCTs
with a high risk of bias.
2++ High quality systematic reviews of case–control or
cohort studies or high quality case–control or cohort
studies with a very low risk of confounding bias, or
chance and a high probability that the relationship is
causal.
2+ Well conducted case–control or cohort studies with
a low risk of confounding, bias, or chance and a
moderate probability that the relationship is causal.
2- Case–control or cohort studies with a high risk of
confounding, bias, or chance and a significant risk that
the relationship is not causal.
3 Non-analytic studies, e.g. case reports, case series.
4 Expert opinion.
Recommendations given in the guidelines are graded
depending on their level of evidence:
"Grade of recommendation & criteria"
A If level 1 evidence was found (not the case).
B If level 2 evidence was found.
C If level 3 evidence was found (mainly non-analytical
studies such as case reports and case series).
D If level 4 evidence was found (mainly expert opinion).
Disclaimer
These guidelines aim at helping decision making in
UCD patient care. Although based on the best available evidence, the recommendations given often reflect only expert opinion and are thus not meant to
be rigidly implemented. Furthermore, although as exhaustive as possible, these guidelines cannot include
all possible methods of diagnostic work-up and care
and may therefore fail to mention some acceptable
and established procedures. Guidelines cannot guarantee satisfactory diagnosis and outcome in every patient. Although helping optimise the care of individual
patients and assist decision-making by basing clinical
practice on the existing scientific and medical knowledge, they should not substitute well-informed, prudent clinical practice.
Diagnosis
The clinical picture
The clinical manifestations of UCDs (Table 1) can occur at
any age [12-16], with hyperammonemic crises being frequently triggered by catabolic events, protein overload or
certain drugs. Most symptoms are neurological but nonspecific. A UCD should be immediately suspected in neonates
if there are any neurological symptoms or at any age if there
is an acute encephalopathy. Hepatic-gastrointestinal and
psychiatric nonspecific manifestations (Table 1) are second
in frequency. Only the hair shaft abnormalities with hair
fragility (trichorrhexis nodosa) found mainly in ASLD
[12,17-19] and the progressive spastic diplegia beginning in
childhood (or later) in ARG1D and the HHH syndrome,
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 3 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

frequently without hyperammonemic episodes [20-22], are
specific manifestations of this group of diseases. Symptoms
can be subtle, particularly after the neonatal period, and in
some patients symptomatic episodes can resolve with nonspecific interventions. Women can first manifest a UCD as
acute unexplained neurological symptoms in the postpartum period (reported for CPS1D, OTCD, and ASSD [23-
25]). Variability in disease severity is characteristic for
OTCD heterozygous females (due to lyonization) [11,26],
but is also found in all UCDs, being mainly attributable to
differences in the severity of the genetic change [27-30].
However, the same genetic defect can yield both mild and
severe presentations even in different members of the same
family (reported for OTCD and for one CPS1D family)
Table 1 Clinical signs and symptoms of acute and chronic presentations of UCDs, and triggering factors for
hyperammonemia in UCD patients
Acute presentation Chronic presentation
• Altered level of consciousness (from somnolence and
lethargy to coma) mimicking encephalitis or drug
intoxication
• Confusion, lethargy, dizziness
• Migraine-like headaches, tremor, ataxia, dysarthria
• Acute encephalopathy (see below) • Asterixis (in adults)
• Seizures (generally not isolated but along with an
altered level of consciousness)
• Learning disabilities, neurodevelopmental delay, mental retardation
• Ataxia (generally associated with altered consciousness level) • Chorea, cerebral palsy
• Stroke-like episodes • Protracted cortical visual loss
• Transient visual loss • Progressive spastic diplegia or quadriplegia (described in ARG1D
and HHH syndrome)
• Vomiting and progressive poor appetite • Protein aversion, self-selected low-protein diet
• Liver failure • Abdominal pain, vomiting
• Multiorgan failure • Failure to thrive
• Peripheral circulatory failure • Hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes
• “Post-partum psychosis” • Psychiatric symptoms: hyperactivity, mood
alteration, behavioural changes, aggressiveness
• Psychiatric symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia,
mania, emotional or personality changes)
• Self-injurious behaviour
• Autism-like symptoms
In neonates: • Fragile hair (typical for ASLD)
• sepsis-like picture, temperature instability
• respiratory distress, hyperventilation
• Dermatitis
• Specific neuropsychological phenotype in heterozygous OTC females
• Episodic character of signs and symptoms
Potential triggers of hyperammonemic crises in UCD patients
• Infections
• Fever
• Vomiting
• Gastrointestinal or internal bleeding
• Decreased energy or protein intake (e.g. fasting pre surgery, major weight loss in neonates)
• Catabolism and involution of the uterus during the postpartum period (mostly OTC females)
• Chemotherapy, high-dose glucocorticoids
• Prolonged or intense physical exercise
• Surgery under general anesthesia
• Unusual protein load (e.g. a barbecue, parenteral nutrition)
• Drugs: Mainly valproate and L-asparaginase/pegaspargase. Topiramate, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoine, primidone,
furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide and salicylates have also been associated with hyperammonemic decompensation.

[31-33]. Acute liver failure has been reported as the presenting sign in patients with OTCD, ASSD and HHH syndrome
[34-39]. Although rare, a number of other presentations
have been reported in UCDs, including stroke-like episodes
(metabolic strokes) [10,40-44] that may resolve with treatment, chorea [45], cerebral palsy without hyperammonemia
or cerebral edema [46,47], episodic transient or protracted
cortical visual losses [48,49], dermatitis (most probably because of treatment-related malnutrition) [50,51], autism-like
symptoms [52,53], behavioural problems during childhood
[53] and in postpuberal patients and other episodic psychiatric symptoms that may be the only manifestation [54].
A careful medical and family history is mandatory
and should include questions about unexplained neonatal deaths, neurological or psychiatric disorders in
the family, consanguinity (frequent in all UCDs except
in OTCD, which is X-linked), evidence of protein
avoidance in patient and family members and drug intake by the patient.
Statement #1. Grade of recommendation: C
UCDs may present with acute or chronic presentations
at any age and are often triggered by catabolic events,
protein load or some drugs. In many cases a precipitating factor cannot be identified. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific and commonly neurological,
gastrointestinal or psychiatric. It is essential that healthcare professionals have an awareness of these diseases.
Key questions should be asked and a detailed family history with pedigree is mandatory.
Statement #2. Grade of recommendation: D
UCDs must be included in the differential diagnosis of
acute unexplained encephalopathy or acute psychiatric
illness at any age, which must prompt plasma ammonia
determination.
Laboratory findings
Hyperammonemia, a nonspecific marker of inadequate
nitrogen detoxification [55], is the hallmark for most
UCDs. The absence of hyperammonemia in symptomatic
newborn patients (but not in older patients) renders a
UCD highly unlikely. Rapid ammonia measurement in
an emergency setting is crucial since patient outcome
correlates with the duration and peak level of hyperammonemia [4,6,56]. Respiratory alkalosis in a newborn
should prompt immediate ammonia measurement because it is present initially in 50% of acute UCDs [5].
Otherwise the acid–base status is of limited use [57].
Statement #3. Grade of recommendation: C
Ammonia should be determined in an emergency setting
with results available in 30 minutes.
Statement #4. Grade of recommendation: D
Ammonia should be measured in patients of any age
presenting 1) an unexplained change in consciousness;
2) unusual or unexplained neurological illness; 3) liver
failure; 4) suspected intoxication.
If hyperammonemia is confirmed, determination of
plasma amino acids, blood or plasma acylcarnitines,
urinary organic acids and orotic acid should be urgently requested together with basic laboratory investigations, not waiting for the results (which should be
obtained in <24 h) for treating the patient. When taking samples after recovery from an acute episode,
plasma amino acid levels and/or urinary orotic acid
(measured with a specific method e.g. high performance liquid chromatography) can be particularly helpful for diagnosis. In patients with fatal outcome,
procurement of anticoagulated blood for DNA isolation and storage of frozen aliquots of all samples
obtained of plasma, serum, urine and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) is recommended [16,58].
Statement #5. Grade of recommendation: D
If ammonia is found elevated, further metabolic investigations should be immediately carried out without delaying specific treatment.
Differential diagnosis
The most common misdiagnosis of early onset UCD
patients is neonatal sepsis. A number of conditions
that increase ammonia production and/or secondarily
decrease ammonia detoxification can cause hyperammonemia and mimic a UCD [16,59-63]. Thus, neonatal hyperammonemia can be due to UCDs, to other
inborn errors that cause secondary hyperammonemia,
to liver failure or to congenital infection. Premature
infants can have transient hyperammonemia, a condition which is characterised by a normal blood glutamine level [64] and which is possibly due to ductus
venosus shunting of portal blood [65-67]. Late-onset
hyperammonemia can be triggered by most conditions
that can also cause neonatal hyperammonemia, by
chronic liver failure, exogenous intoxications (e.g.
amanita phalloides), drugs (e.g. valproic acid), portocaval shunt and Reye syndrome, by conditions that
vastly increase either direct ammonia production (e.g.
asparaginase treatment, urease-positive bacteria overgrowth or genito-urinary infection) or protein catabolism (e.g. myeloma, chemotherapy, steroid therapy,
trauma, gastrointestinal hemorrhage) and when there
is excessive nitrogen supply (reported in total parenteral nutrition or after glycine-solution irrigations in
transurethral prostate resection) [5,17,68-72]. Table 2
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 5 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

lists errors of metabolism leading to hyperammonemia, guiding bedside differentiation.
Statement #6. Grade of recommendation: C
In newborns with clinical distress where sepsis is suspected, hyperammonemia must always form part of the
initial differential diagnosis.
Standard clinical and analytical procedures generally
differentiate between hyperammonemia due to inborn
errors and that due to other conditions such as liver failure [1,16,73-75]. The algorithm given in Figure 2 guides
the identification of the specific defect when the hyperammonemia is due to an inborn error. ARG1D and
ASLD can be identified, respectively, by the high plasma
arginine or the high plasma/urinary argininosuccinate
(ASA) level. The finding of high plasma citrulline in the
absence of ASA is highly suggestive of ASSD. The combination of hyperammonemia with low plasma citrulline
and arginine is diagnostic of OTCD when orotic acid is
increased in the urine, whereas it strongly suggests
CPS1D or NAGS deficiency (NAGSD) when urinary orotic acid is low. The finding of high plasma ornithine and
hyperammonemia, (these two traits can also be found in
OAT deficiency) with high urinary homocitrulline is
characteristic of the HHH syndrome. When the metabolite pattern is not clear-cut, activity assays of urea cycle
enzymes in liver (all urea cycle enzymes), red blood cells
(ASL and ARG1; still very useful in ARG1D [76]),
intestinal mucosa (CPS1, OTC) or fibroblasts (ASS, ASL,
HHH) can clarify diagnosis, although enzyme assays have
generally been replaced by genetic testing. Enzyme analysis is now mainly reserved for the minority of cases in
whom genetic analysis fails to identify a specific UCD
(see below).
Statement #7. Grade of recommendation: D
Genetic testing is the method of first choice to confirm
the diagnosis. Liver tissue, intestinal mucosa, erythrocytes and fibroblasts can be used for enzyme activity
assays in UCDs if genetic testing does not identify a specific UCD, or if it is not available. In deceased patients
with a suspicion of UCD, fibroblasts and/or liver tissue
should be preserved frozen.
Molecular genetic analysis
Except for OTCD, which is transmitted in the Xchromosome, UCDs exhibit autosomal recessive inheritance [12-16]. Mutations in the corresponding genes
(homonymous with the enzymes) have been identified in
patients of all UCDs (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez?db=omim) including citrullinemia type 2
(SLC25A15 gene encoding citrin) and the HHH syndrome (SLC25A13 gene). Mutation detection has at least
~80% sensitivity [77] and permits carrier identification,
prenatal diagnosis, facilitating pedigree analysis, genetic
counselling and in some cases genotype-phenotype

In addition to the conditions indicated in the table, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects, citrin deficiency, lysinuric protein intolerance or ornithine
aminotransferase deficiency can also cause hyperammonemia.
Grade of recommendation, D. a In neonates ketonuria (++ or +++) suggests organic aciduria.

correlations [15,27,78], conceivably opening the way to
future therapies (e.g. nonsense read-through
approaches). DNA, generally from blood, is used, although the large number of CPS1 exons renders preferable the utilization of RNA from cultured fibroblasts for
CPS1D studies. For other UCDs RNA analysis (from liver
in the case of OTCD) is only carried out when DNA analysis is negative [79-81]. Prognostic judgements on the
disease-causing nature of missense mutations (the most
frequent ones) and of some splice-site mutations are difficult if not backed by in vitro expression studies of the mutant protein.
Statement #8. Grade of recommendation: C
Mutation analysis is the method of choice for definitive
diagnosis of UCDs, to help with genetic counselling and
in some instances indicate the prognosis.
Statement #9. Grade of recommendation: D
Mutation analysis has some pitfalls and limitations, including the difficulty in establishing the pathogenic potential of
a missense mutation. In vitro protein expression studies
and in silico analyses based on sequence conservation and
protein structure can help infer pathogenic potential but
are not part of routine clinical management.
Prenatal testing
Prenatal investigations in UCDs are available in many countries and may enable pregnancy termination of affected foetuses. These may also be indicated in milder UCDs or for
NAGSD (which has substitutive therapy) for psychological
reasons and to prepare for perinatal management [82-84].

the method of choice since it gives rapid and clear-cut
results relatively early on, with little fetal risk. Amniotic fluid
citrulline and ASA determinations are also suitable for respective ASSD and ASLD prenatal diagnosis [86-88].
Statement #10. Grade of recommendation: D
Prenatal testing requires joint careful counselling by clinical geneticists and metabolic specialists.
Statement #11. Grade of recommendation: C-D
Molecular genetic analysis is the preferred prenatal testing method for all UCDs. Investigations of metabolites in
amniotic fluid and of enzyme activities in chorionic villi,
cultured amniotic cells, fetal liver or fetal erythrocytes
can also be used.
Newborn screening (NBS)
UCD patients manifesting severe neonatal hyperammonemia benefit little from NBS or even from early diagnosis, because of their poor prognosis [89-91] although the
family would benefit from knowing the diagnosis. However, NAGSD, CPS1D and OTCD are generally not
screened for, given the instability of glutamine and the
low specificity and sensitivity for detection of decreases
in the citrulline level [92]. The benefits of screening for
ASSD, ASLD, and ARG1D, carried out in most US
states, Taiwan and Australia by assessing respectively
citrulline, ASA and arginine levels in dried blood spots,
have not yet been formally evaluated. Although for severe ASSD and ASLD there are few false positives and
no false negatives [93-95], ASLD screening was abandoned in Austria because of the high rate of positive
newborns probably having partial deficiency but
remaining asymptomatic [96]. The sensitivity of NBS for
ARG1D and HHH is unknown, since in these diseases
arginine and ornithine levels, respectively, may be normal in the first days of life [97]. A further difficulty with
HHH is the potential production of ornithine by red cell
arginase as the blood spot dries.
Statement #12. Grade of recommendation: D
Newborn screening for NAGSD, CPS1D and OTCD cannot currently be recommended.
Statement #13. Grade of recommendation: C
Newborn screening for ASSD, ASLD, and ARG1D may be
considered, but more information on the resulting benefits
and problems is needed.
Management of acute hyperammonemia
Initial management
Since prognosis is strongly influenced by the duration of
coma [6,56] and peak ammonia levels [9,98,99], therapy
must not be delayed. Pediatric hospitals should always have
first-line medications and consensus-based written protocols on how to proceed. Patients in hyperammonemic crisis
should be transferred without delay to a specialist centre
after:
1) stopping protein intake
2) starting intravenous (IV) 10% glucose
3) initiation of first-line medications as outlined in Table 4
4) plasma and urine collection for diagnostic purposes
without postponing treatment initiation.
The diagnostic workup of the specific defect and the
initial medical treatment should proceed simultaneously.
Statement #14. Grade of recommendation: C-D
Early clinical suspicion and prompt diagnosis of hyperammonemia are crucial for a favourable outcome. The
start of ammonia detoxification and of measures to reverse catabolism must not be delayed unless a decision
for withdrawal of treatment and for palliative care is
made.

Before treatment of acute hyperammonemia, the
prognosis and expected neurodevelopmental outcome
must be considered since it can influence the therapeutic decision. Prognosis is considered very poor if:
1. hyperammonemic coma has lasted more than 3 days
2. intracranial pressure is clearly increased
3. ammonia peaked at >1000 μmol/L [4,56] although
the impact of this level on prognosis depends on the
duration of hyperammonemia.
Statement #15. Grade of recommendation: C
Total duration of coma and peak ammonia levels are the
most relevant factors for neurodevelopmental prognosis.
More studies are needed to identify other potential contributing factors.
Drugs and dosages in acute UCD decompensations
The ammonia scavengers sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate or sodium phenylbutyrate (PBA) are the mainstay drugs for bypassing the urea cycle, by conjugation of
benzoate with glycine to generate hippurate, or of phenylacetate (phenylbutyrate is a precursor of phenylacetate)
with glutamine to generate phenylacetylglutamine. These
conjugates are excreted in the urine [1,16,73,75,98,100,101].
Arginine and/or citrulline administration aims at maximising ammonia excretion through the urea cycle [12-16],
whereas N-carbamylglutamate replaces the CPS1 activator
N-acetylglutamate ([12,16] and see below). The dose
ranges given in Table 5 reflect a consensus of this guideline
working group and are supported by several publications
[1,16,73,75,98,100,101]. Ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) may be
administered to avoid vomiting when boluses of the scavengers are administered [101]. Repeated boluses or very
high doses of benzoate, phenylbutyrate/phenylacetate can
saturate the scavenger-converting systems and increase
the risk of drug accumulation and toxicity [102].
Statement #16. Grade of recommendation: C
Administration of ammonia scavengers, of L-arginine or
L-citrulline and in NAGS deficiency, of carbamylglutamate,
is highly valuable for treating acute hyperammonemic decompensation. The potential toxicity of repeated boluses or
high doses of benzoate or phenylacetate should be taken
into account.

In severe acute decompensation both sodium benzoate and sodium PBA/phenylacetate should be given in parallel as “ultima ratio”. In less severe cases, a
stepwise approach with initial sodium benzoate and if hyperammonemia persists or worsens, the addition of sodium PBA/phenylacetate can be chosen. The doses
given can be used at the start of treatment but must be adapted depending on plasma ammonia and amino acids levels. Maximal daily dosages of sodium
benzoate, sodium PBA and L-arginine should not exceed 12g for each of the three drugs. Grade of recommendation, D. a If citrulline is given, there is usually no need for concomitant use of L-arginine.
b In undiagnosed patients, consider additional use of carnitine 100mg/kg IV, hydroxycobalamin 1mg IM/IV, and biotin 10mg IV/PO.
c If on hemodialysis/hemodiafiltration maintenance doses should be increased to 350mg/kg/day (or proportional increase for body surface-based dose calculation). d In ASLD, L-arginine therapy for acute decompensations might be sufficient for some patients.
e The risk for acute hyperammonemic decompensation is low in ARG1D.

cycle disorder’ (http://www.bimdg.org.uk/). The metabolic
history of the previous index case including specific diagnosis and pedigree analysis (same father?) should be taken.
Measures for minimising delivery stress should be considered, planning delivery in a hospital and having rapid access to a specialised metabolic unit. If there is risk of early
neonatal presentation, it is recommended to transfer the
newborn to the neonatal unit immediately after birth.
Within 30 min 10% glucose infusion (4 ml/kg/h) should
be started and after 4 symptomless hours, protein-free
feeds should be given, along with reduction of glucose infusion, and administration of PO 6-hourly 50 mg/kg of
both sodium benzoate and L-arginine. Plasma ammonia
should be measured at 6 h and if <80 μmol/L re-assay
every 6 h is recommended, while protein-free feeds are
continued 3-hourly, changing to normal feeding after 24 h
if ammonia remains <80 μmol/L. In contrast, if ammonia
reaches 80–150 μmol/L, a preanalytical problem should be
excluded, and re-assay in 4 h is recommended. If it
remains in this range, monitoring should continue at 6-
hourly intervals, whilst stopping protein containing feeds
and continuing glucose infusion. With ammonia >150
μmol/L or if the baby becomes unwell, plasma ammonia
levels should be repeated immediately. Feeds must be
stopped (but protein-free nutrition should not exceed 24–
48 hours) and actions taken as per Tables 4 and 5. Plasma
amino acids should be measured (quantitatively) urgently
at 12 h of age regardless of the plasma ammonia concentration. At the same time, blood samples for molecular
genetic diagnosis should be collected and sent (not cord
blood because of potential maternal contamination).
If a previous sibling had a late onset presentation, the
glucose infusion should only be started if the birth was
complicated. Otherwise, infant formula providing ≤2g
protein/kg/d or demand breast feeding should be started,
and plasma ammonia and amino acids (quantitatively)
measured at 24 h of age. If ammonia is <150 μmol/L,
re-analysis is indicated after 12 h but if ammonia >150
μmol/L or if the baby becomes unwell ammonia should
be repeated immediately and actions taken as per
Tables 4 and 5. If at 48 h ammonia is <80 μmol/L, milk
feeds should continue (providing ≤2g protein/kg/d),
whereas if ammonia is 80–150 μmol/L between 24 to 48
h and the baby is well, re-analysis at 12-hourly intervals
is indicated. The results of quantitative plasma amino
acids must be obtained, and feeds changed to a proteinfree formula. OTCD female patients have a low risk of
symptomatic hyperammonemia in the newborn period.
Extracorporeal detoxification
Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)
should be started in neonates and children who have ammonia levels of >500 μmol/L but at lower levels if there
has been an inadequate response to medical management
after 4 hours (this being the estimated time for preparing
dialysis, including vascular access [103]). The modality of
dialysis is partially determined by the local facilities, although hemodialysis in neonates is difficult and should
only be performed by experienced teams and peritoneal
dialysis is much less effective than other methods [56].
Statement #17. Grade of recommendation: C-D
In neonates and children with symptomatic hyperammonemia, dialysis should be carried out when ammonia
exceeds 500 μmol/L or when there is no response within
four hours after starting medical treatment.
In adults with acute decompensations, hemodialysis
(HD) or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)
are first-line treatments because of wider availability and
low risk, even if the diagnosis is not yet certain. Given the
susceptibility of adults to develop intracranial hypertension
and cerebral edema with hyperammonemia, dialysis
should be started quickly, even before transfer to a specialised center, if ammonia exceeds 200 μmol/L. Although
the decision to dialyze should consider also the existence
of co-morbidities and the availability of and the tolerance
to medications.
Statement #18. Grade of recommendation: C-D
Extracorporeal detoxification is the first line treatment in
acute hyperammonemic decompensations in adults.
HD is intermittent and gives the highest ammonia extraction, but some patients experience acute relapses after
its discontinuation. Due to frequent technical and
hemodynamic complications related to HD in infants [104]
ammonia removal in neonates may be more effective with
CVVH. CVVHDF is a continuous procedure with excellent
ammonia clearance and usually well tolerated in small
infants, for whom it is the preferred method of dialysis
[56,99,105].
Statement #19. Grade of recommendation: C
The method of choice for ammonia detoxification is
hemodiafiltration. Peritoneal dialysis is a far less effective
method. Exchange transfusion should not be used.
Dietary management of acute decompensation
The aim is to minimise protein (nitrogen) intake temporarily and prevent endogenous protein catabolism whilst providing enough energy to meet metabolic demands [106]. If
the patient starts to feel unwell but oral feeding is still possible, a high energy, protein free feeding regimen which is
based on glucose polymer (Table 6) should be immediately
given. In cases of impaired consciousness or vomiting, glucose should be infused (plus IV insulin at a starting dose of
0.05 units/kg/h in case of hyperglycemia) as soon as
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 11 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

possible to maximise energy intake [107]. IV lipids can also
be given to increase energy, at a dose of (1)-2-(3) g/kg/d.
Following improvement of hyperammonemia reintroduction of protein/essential amino acids (EAAs) should not be
delayed beyond 24 to 48 h. If the patient cannot be fed enterally, IV amino acids should be commenced, increasing
daily to the required amount.
Enteral feeding should be re-started as soon as possible. It may initially be protein-free (Table 6). Transient
nasogastric (NG) feeding may be necessary to achieve an
adequate intake. Enteral fluids should be increased as IV
fluids are decreased. The sodium given with nitrogen
scavengers (see Table 4) should be considered in calculating the total electrolyte intake. Osmotic diarrhoea because of over-concentrated feeds should be avoided. In
practice, once the blood ammonia has fallen to <100
μmol/L protein is usually re-introduced, to the ‘safe level
of intake’ (see below section on low protein diet) or the
child’s usual intake over 2–4 days, whilst monitoring ammonia. If ammonia levels increase during protein reintroduction, special mixtures of EAAs for UCDs can be
used instead of or in combination with natural protein.
The energy intake should aim to provide about 120% of
age-adjusted requirements.
Statement #20. Grade of recommendation: D
For treatment of acute hyperammonemia it is crucial to
promote and maintain anabolism by infusing high-dose
glucose plus lipids (if a fatty acid oxidation disorder has
been excluded). Protein should be reintroduced when
ammonia returns to <100 μmol/L. Ideally the period of
protein-free nutrition should not exceed 24–48 hours.
Long-term management of UCDs
The goals of long-term management are to achieve normal
development and to prevent hyperammonemia, whilst
providing a good quality of life and avoiding side-effects
and complications [12,16,108]. It is based on:
 low protein diet
 essential amino acids supplementation
 vitamin and mineral supplementation
 medications to increase waste nitrogen excretion
 caring for special situations and provision of
emergency regimen in intercurrent illnesses
 liver transplantation for selected patients.
A detailed, written day to day treatment plan and emergency regimen (see dietary management of acute decompensation above), including instructions on when and how
to contact the metabolic team or the local hospital should
be given to parents/caregivers and to the child’s nursery or
school.
Low-protein diet
This mainstay of long-term management is based upon
minimising the nitrogen load on the urea cycle. The
amount of natural protein tolerated by each patient must
be individually determined and by titration against
ammonia. The FAO/WHO/UNU 2007 have set ‘safe
levels of protein intake’ [109] calculated as an ageadjusted mean + 2-standard deviations (SD) (Table 7) and
can be used as a guide. Lower protein intakes may still
be adequate [106] but individualised over-restriction may
compromise growth and cause metabolic instability
[47,110]. If the intake is too low, EAA supplementation
may be indicated (see below). An adequate energy supply
must also be guaranteed to prevent catabolism and consequent hyperammonemia. The FAO/WHO/UNU 2007
Report [109] (summarised in Table 7) can be used as a
guide to energy intakes. Patients with reduced mobility
will have lower energy expenditures and therefore lower
energy requirements. To ensure sufficient energy and
protein intake NG tube or gastrostomy feeding (see
below) may be necessary. Ideally the diet should be provided by normal food, combining low and high biological
value protein foods, naturally low or protein free foods,
additionally for some patients, specially manufactured
low protein foods. The daily protein intake should if possible be divided equally between three meals and some
for snacks. Long fasts should be avoided, and a pre-bed
snack given to reduce the risk of overnight catabolism.

Regular monitoring of protein intake, growth and clinical
status are essential, because protein requirements and
tolerance vary with age, growth velocity, disorder nature
and severity and frequency of intercurrent illnesses.
Compared with older children, metabolic control may be
easier in early infancy, when their rapid growth results in
increased protein tolerance [16,109].
Statement #21. Grade of recommendation: C-D
Dietary treatment is a cornerstone of therapy. This warrants the particular expertise of a specialist metabolic
dietitian to finely balance nutritional requirements with
metabolic stability. The FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations can be used to guide the protein and energy
requirements.

Supplementation of EAAs and other essential nutrients
EAA supplementation is required when natural protein
tolerance is too low to achieve normal growth and metabolic stability. A reasonable approach [111] is to provide
20-30% of the total protein intake as EAA supplements,
except in ARGD1, when supplements of EAA can, if necessary, be increased to 50% of total protein because of the
severity of protein restriction (see below). EAA’s should be
given as an equally divided dose with 3 or 4 main meals to
enhance utilisation and prevent nitrogen overload. Plasma
levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, a subgroup
of the EAAs) are decreased in patients taking high doses
of sodium PBA [112], suggesting the potential need of
BCAA supplementation [113,114]. It has been advocated
that EAA supplements should be rich in BCAAs but not
in the neurotransmitter precursor amino acids tryptophan,
phenylalanine and tyrosine [114]. BCAA supplements are
available as single amino acids or complete mixture and as
per EAAs given as a divided dose.
Statement #22. Grade of recommendation: C
Essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acid
supplements can form part of the total protein intake if
natural protein tolerance is very low and the patient is
not metabolically stable.
UCD patients on low protein diets are at risk of vitamin
and mineral deficiencies particularly of Fe, Zn, Cu, Ca and
cobalamin [106] and supplementation will be required.
Additionally, they may be at risk of essential fatty acid
(EFAs)/long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiencies
[115,116]. These can be provided in the diet from EFAs/
(LCPUFAs)-enriched infant formulas, oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., walnut, rapeseed or sunflower
oils) or as a separate supplement of docosahexaenoic acid
and arachidonic acid.
Practical aspects of dietary management of low-protein
diet
The main protein source for infants should be either
breast feeding or standard infant formula.
Exclusive demand breast feeding [117,118] is possible
but this needs close analytical/clinical monitoring, and if
necessary protein intake can be limited by giving
protein-free infant formula prior to breast feeds. In bottle
feeding, the protein is given as limited volume of infant
formula (sometimes together with EAAs) and divided
evenly between the daily feeds. Each protein feed is followed by a nutritionally complete but protein-free formula to appetite. Combined the feeds should provide the
normal requirement for all nutrients. Normal weaning
practices can be followed by first introducing fruits and
very low protein vegetables [106] then gradually replacing gram by gram of protein from breast milk/infant
formula with protein-containing foods. Parents need
careful training and close supervision in calculating the
protein content of food, to allow this changeover from
feeds to food. Vitamin and mineral supplementation
should be started as weaning progresses and less milk
feeds are taken. Feeding problems do occur in patients
with UCDs and can cause inadequate nutrient intake
and metabolic instability. For some it is possible to give
concentrated energy supplements such as glucose polymer and/or fat emulsions but tube feeding may be essential (see below). The diet must be adjusted regularly
throughout childhood. Close monitoring is generally
needed in adolescence because of the tendency to poor
compliance, increased appetite and nutrient requirements of puberty thus an increased risk of metabolic instability. Late onset patients who are on a self-selected
low-protein diet generally require vitamin and mineral
supplements since they are likely to be deficient in cobalamin, iron and calcium, at least. Adolescent and adult
patients should know that unless treated by liver transplantation they will need life-long, low-protein diet and
regular dietary assessments. Pregnancy and lactation in
UCD patients [119,120] requires addressing special nutritional needs (Table 7), avoiding protein deficiency and
close monitoring of metabolic status, particularly during
and for five days post delivery to ensure prompt recognition and treatment of any hyperammonemia. In all
patients, the last meal of the day should aim to provide
~25% of the daily intakes of energy, natural protein,
(EAAs if taken), citrulline and/or arginine (see below) to
minimise catabolism during the overnight fast and to optimise urea cycle function.

and lactation necessitate careful, individualised dietary
management plans. Parents and patients should be
trained on food protein calculation and provision of adequate energy and nutrient intake. They need to be
aware of the need for life-long dietary treatment and
regular dietary assessments.
Tube feeding is essential in cases of: i) inability to suck
or swallow because of neurological handicap or developmental delay; ii) severe vomiting, reflux or retching; iii)
poor appetite and/or refusal of food, EAA supplement or
drugs; iv) emergency management during intercurrent
illnesses. In acute episodes, nasogastric tubes may help
expedite the transfer from parenteral to enteral nutrition.
If tube feeding is needed in the long-term, gastrostomy
is recommended despite the lack of controlled studies
and the risk of tube feeding-dependence [107]; oral food
and fluids can be offered in addition unless swallowing is

compromised. The pattern of tube feeding (bolus, continuous, during the day and night) should be based on
feed tolerance and consideration to the patient’s daily
routine.
Statement #24. Grade of recommendation: C-D
Tube feeding may be needed to: achieve nutritional adequacy, administer medications and supplements, prevent catabolism and maintain metabolic stability.
Pharmacotherapy for long-term treatment
The drugs used for acute detoxification are also utilised
as oral preparations for long-term treatment. Given the
multiplicity of oral preparations, their prescription
should be unambiguous [3,75].
Statement #25. Grade of recommendation: D
Written drug treatment sheets should be provided to parents, pharmacists and persons involved in patient care.
Among the nitrogen scavengers, sodium benzoate, although not a registered drug, has been used for decades
in UCDs, whereas sodium PBA is a licensed drug that
has more recently been introduced. Although in theory
phenylbutyrate can scavenge twice as much nitrogen as
benzoate [83,121], the superiority in vivo of PBA has
been questioned [122]. Many European centres as well
as a majority of guideline group members prefer sodium
benzoate because PBA is a histone 1,2 deacetylase inhibitor [123] that could have as yet unrecognized long-term
side effects. Nevertheless, at the recommended doses
(Table 8; [3,73]) both nitrogen scavengers appear safe.
Sodium benzoate is toxic only at plasma levels >2
mmol/L [124]. Sodium PBA causes menstrual dysfunction/amenorrhea in ~25% of postpubertal females [101],
and can decrease appetite, disturb taste and cause disagreeable body odour. Also it may deplete BCAAs and
increase the risk of endogenous protein catabolism [112].
Since both scavengers are esterified with CoA, they could
cause acetyl-CoA depletion, resulting in mitochondrial
dysfunction [125] and decreased NAG synthesis. Low albumin levels have been reported in some sodium PBAtreated patients [112,113,126], possibly because of
decreased leucine and glutamine availability.
Statement #26. Grade of recommendation: C
To avoid mucositis or gastritis, oral sodium benzoate
and sodium PBA (as granules, tablets, or undiluted liquid
preparations) should be taken 4-times daily during meals
with abundant fluids.
Hypokalemia can develop after repeated boluses of
scavengers and in long-term treatment, resulting from
increased renal loss of K+
. Metabolic acidosis has been
observed with high doses of both scavengers [100,101].
The doses given in Table 8 for these scavengers reflect

a literature- [1,100,101] and experience-based consensus. Despite anecdotal evidence of successful pregnancies of women taking sodium PBA [101], sodium
benzoate appears potentially a safer choice during
pregnancy.
Statement #27. Grade of recommendation: C
Use of nitrogen scavengers appears safe at the recommended doses.
Statement #28. Grade of recommendation: D
Information on nitrogen scavenger therapy during pregnancy is scarce. There is a compelling need for a registry
to collect all unreported cases.
L-arginine is an essential amino acid in all UCDs because of its impaired synthesis (except in ARG1D) and
must be supplemented as such or as its precursor /
L-citrulline [3,127-130]. In ASSD and ASLD, citrulline
and particularly ASA, respectively, serve as vehicles for
nitrogen removal via their excretion in the urine and
thus arginine administration reduces the frequency of
hyperammonemic episodes [3,128-130]. In these patients
fasting plasma arginine concentrations should be about
70–120 μmol/L [3]. In NAGSD, CPS1D, OTCD and the
HHH syndrome L-citrulline may be supplemented instead of L-arginine but there are no studies comparing
the efficacy of the two.
Statement #29. Grade of recommendation: C
All UCD patients should be monitored for plasma arginine
levels. Except in ARG1D, most will need L-arginine or
L-citrulline supplementation.
N-carbamyl-L-glutamate, also called carbamylglutamate
or carglumic acid is a deacylase-resistant NAG analogue
that is taken up enterally and replaces NAG in the activation of CPS1, thus being the definitive therapy for NAGSD
[131-133]. It is licensed in Europe by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and approved in the US by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). It can also be used as an
emergency medication and a tool for diagnosis of NAGS
deficiency in neonatal hyperammonemia [134]. Despite
the lack of controlled studies, its use should be considered
in severe hyperammonemic decompensations. In addition
to UCDs, N-carbamyl-L-glutamate is licensed by the EMA
for treatment of hyperammonemia in some organic acidurias [135]. There are no reports on long-term safety or
on adverse effects of this drug other than high dosetriggered Chinese restaurant syndrome [133].
Statement #30. Grade of recommendation: C-D
N-carbamyl-L-glutamate is the first line medication for
treatment of NAGSD and may also be used as an
emergency drug during acute neonatal hyperammonemia
of unknown etiology.
UCD patients may have carnitine deficiency [136-138]
because low protein diets can be low in carnitine and nitrogen scavengers also conjugate with carnitine. Plasma
carnitine should be monitored in UCD patients and severe
carnitine deficiency treated with carnitine supplements.
Statement #31. Grade of recommendation: D
In cases of proven plasma carnitine deficiency 25–50
mg/kg/d carnitine should be given.
Although neomycin and metronidazole have been
used to decrease the load of ammonia-producing bacteria in the colon, there is currently no good evidence to
support its use.
Caring for special situations and emergency regimen in
intercurrent illnesses
If there is an immediate risk of hyperammonemia as a
consequence of an intercurrent illness or other event,
the emergency regimen (Table 6) should be started without delay, even at home. If there is no prompt improvement the metabolic unit should be contacted urgently
(see above section on acute management).
Despite the potential risks of fever, vaccinations have
not been identified as causes of metabolic decompensation [139,140].
Statement #32. Grade of recommendation: B
Vaccinations do not substantially increase the risk of
decompensations and are recommended at the same
schedule as for healthy children. If temperature exceeds
38°C antipyretic treatment should be started.
To minimise decompensation risks [108], elective surgery
should be undertaken when the patient is completely well
including no minor intercurrent illness and has normal ammonia/amino acid levels. Surgery should only be carried out
in centres prepared for dealing with acute hyperammonemic decompensations. The day before surgery drug treatment should be switched to IV and glucose (10%) infused to
ensure anabolism. The patient should be first on the day’s
surgical schedule. Midazolam, s-ketamine, fentanyl and isoflurane in combination with surgical field infiltration with
ropivacaine have been reported [141] as safe anesthetic
agents. Post-surgery, close monitoring of the clinical status
and ammonia levels is required, shifting to oral medications
and diet and stopping the IV glucose administration only if
the patient is well and metabolically stable.

Statement #33. Grade of recommendation: D
Elective surgery in UCD patients should be performed in
centres with a metabolic department including emergency treatment options for hyperammonemia.
Liver transplantation for UCD patients
The role of liver transplantation
Liver transplantation, reported with all UCDs except
NAGSD and the HHH syndrome, is curative as far as enzyme deficiencies are concerned and allows termination
of the low-protein diet and regular alternative pathway
therapy, but does not reverse established neurological sequelae, [142]. Transplanted patients require immunological therapy and long-term follow-up. The inability to
synthesise arginine extrahepatically persists, but this
metabolic aberration has no recognized clinical impact.
Reported post-transplant survival in OTCD and in nonUCD patients has been the same [143,144], attaining
~95% at one year and ~90% at 5 years in large pediatric
liver transplantation programs [145] with “good” or “excellent” self-reported quality of life at 6–121 months post
transplant [144,146-149]. Thus, liver transplantation
offers severely affected UCD patients a better alternative
in terms of quality of life than medical treatment. Since
the pre-existing neurological damage appears not to reverse [150-157], it is essential to prevent endogenous catabolism and hyperammonemia prior to and during liver
transplantation. Transplantation during acute encephalopathy and/or acute liver failure has been carried out
[34], but these high risk situations require case-by-case
discussion of the need to transplant.
Statement #34. Grade of recommendation: C
The only available curative treatment for UCDs is liver
transplantation, allowing return to a normal diet and
stopping drug administration. Ideally it should be performed in a patient without severe neurological damage
whilst in a stable metabolic condition. In patients with
important neurological acute disease or sequelae, liver
transplantation has to be discussed.
Indications and age for liver transplantation
Liver transplantation should be deferred, if possible,
until 3 months of age and/or 5 kg body weight to avoid
the increased complications and lower survival rates
observed when performed before attaining this age and
weight [158,159]. Ideally, it should be done before 1 year
of age for best neurological outcome [155], especially in
CPS1D, in OTCD males, in patients with recurrent
metabolic decompensations despite treatment or when
treatment compliance is poor. In selected cases presenting with poor treatment compliance, diet-induced
growth retardation, poor school attendance, altered psychological status or problems with familial and social
integration, transplantation may be considered later, sometimes even during adolescence. OTCD females presenting
symptoms in the first 2 years of life have a second lethality
peak at 12–15 years of age [160] and thus they should also
be considered for liver transplantation.
Statement #35. Grade of recommendation: D
Liver transplantation should ideally be carried out before irreversible neurological damage and/or repeated crises, generally between 3 and 12 months of age. It may be
considered in all patients (excepting NAGSD) with severe
neonatal onset. It is also indicated for patients with progressive liver disease (e.g. ASLD), for those suffering recurrent
metabolic decompensations and hospitalisations despite
medical therapy, as well as those with poor quality of life.
Transplant type, donor and ethical issues
Standard orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is preferred
to auxiliary liver transplantation because it has fewer complications [144]. Transplantation of liver lobes from living
relatives can reduce waiting times and gives results comparable to those obtained with cadaveric organs [145], albeit
that it entails a small risk for donors [161]. Heterozygosity
for the disease in the living related donor is not a problem,
except in OTCD females, although asymptomatic OTC heterozygotes have been successful donors [162,163]. Decisions
on whether or not to perform liver transplantation entail
ethical considerations requiring individualised decision, in
particular when the child is already handicapped or when
living donor liver transplantation is considered.
Statement #36. Grade of recommendation: D
The recommended procedure is orthotopic liver transplantation. Ethical issues concerning the recipient and
the risk for living donors render essential careful pre and
post transplantation counselling.
Patient monitoring
Medically treated UCD patients require lifelong monitoring including anthropometric data, biochemical tests, dietary and drug review, history of intercurrent illnesses and
use of the emergency regimen. Visit intervals should be
individualised on the basis of age, growth, severity, metabolic stability and compliance with diet and drug therapy.
Young and severely affected patients may need monitoring
every 3 months, whilst annual reviews may be enough for
older or less affected patients.
Clinical monitoring should address: growth and head circumference, inspection for thin sparse hair, hair loss, skin
rashes and other signs of protein/vitamin deficiency, neurological examination and neurocognitive development, liver
size and structure (by ultrasound scan). Regular dietary
assessments are also essential, either by recall, or when nutritional or compliance problems are suspected, by recording
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 17 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

quantitatively diet, supplements and drugs taken in the 3–5
days preceding the visit. The diet needs to be adjusted for age
and growth (see below) [17,47,106]. Since low protein diets
may increase the risk of osteoporosis, bone density monitoring from time to time may be advisable [164,165].
Statement #37. Grade of recommendation: D
Clinical, biochemical and nutritional monitoring are essential and should follow an individualised plan.
Laboratory monitoring must include plasma ammonia
determination in venous samples (target level <80 μmol/L
[16,100]). Spurious elevations can be due to poor sample
processing, tourniquet, crying, struggling or convulsions
[166]. Sequential determination of ammonia for 24 h, including preprandial, postprandial and fasting samples, is
carried out in some centers but its value is uncertain. A
reflectometric device (Ammonia Checker™ II) [167] exists
that allows bedside approximate assessment of ammonia
in 3 min using 20 μl of venous blood (but upper limit of
detection of this device is 280 μmol/L). It is not recommended for home use since capillary samples are unsuitable because cell contents and sweat contamination can
lead to false high values.
The plasma amino acid profile should be determined to
ensure that enough arginine/citrulline and EAAs/BCAAs
are supplied. Arginine should be in the high normal range
and EAAs and BCAAs in the normal ranges. Rising glutamine may indicate impending hyperammonemia. Arbitrarily,
glutamine levels are considered tolerable when they do not
exceed 1000 μmol/L [16,73,100,168]. Since glutamine levels
change with the fasting/feeding status, being highest after
the overnight fast [169], sampling should be standardised,
ideally 3–4 h after the last meal [170,171]. It is important to
consider growth rate, age, actual protein intake and frequency of use of the emergency regimen when interpreting
plasma amino acids as low EAA levels do not always necessitate an increase in protein. Decreasing the nitrogen scavenger dose may also help to increase BCAAs
concentrations.
Other blood assays can include determination of vitamins (including cobalamin), minerals, trace elements,
carnitine, ferritin, cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma
and of EFAs in red blood cells and plasma. Blood urea
levels are of little value since they depend mainly on arginine intake and tubular urine flow rate. Blood sodium
benzoate and/or sodium PBA/phenylacetate assays may
be helpful to prevent toxicity in patients receiving high
dosages or repeated boluses [172].
Urine determinations: ketone bodies (done at home after
instruction of parents) might indicate a catabolic situation.
Hippurate quantitation allows assessing compliance with
benzoate treatment. Amino acid profiling is not recommended; the value of measuring orotate and orotidine
excretion is dubious, although increasing orotate excretion
should reflect greater ammonia load and carbamoylphosphate accumulation.
Statement #38. Grade of recommendation: D
Venous ammonia and amino acid levels should be monitored, aiming at levels of ammonia <80 μmol/L, glutamine <1000 μmol/L, arginine in the high normal range
and EAAs and BCAAs in the normal range. Rapid reflectometric ammonia assay in venous blood is useful, provided it’s limitations are known by the user.
Neuroimaging should assess possible neuroanatomical
alterations, providing "information about the timing, extent, reversibility and possible mechanism of neural injury .... and can be used as an adjunctive measure to
predict clinical and neurocognitive outcome” [173]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should ideally be performed systematically between days 1 and 4 of each coma
or stroke-like episode, to follow the changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). If general anesthesia is not
needed, it should be repeated at approximately 2 yearintervals to allow correlation of motor/language/cognitive
development with anatomic changes. MRI sequences
should include diffusion tensor imaging, axial T2 and
FLAIR, sagittal and axial T1, and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) [173-175]. In acute presentations, diffuse cerebral edema is seen as areas of cortex and the
underlying white matter presenting abnormal signal intensity, infarct-like aspect and restricted diffusion. These areas
are often multiple in one or both hemispheres and are
asymmetrical [176,177]. Basal ganglia involvement is
revealed on T2-weighted images by high intensity signals
in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and/or globus pallidus.
The deep sulci of the insular and perirolandic regions may
also display T1 shortening [176]. MRS can reveal highly
elevated brain glutamine levels [178,179]. These elevations
are helpful to detect subtle changes in OTC females
[174,175]. The thalamus, brainstem, the occipital region
and the cerebellum tend to be relatively spared and a few
months after acute hyperammonemia a very moderate residual hypersignal on the insula and rolandic region may
be observed [13,176]. Chronic hyperammonemia may convey defective myelination and progressive cerebral atrophy,
with nonspecific punctate white matter hyperintensities
seen in some patients [173,175].
Statement #39. Grade of recommendation: D.
To help predict clinical and neurocognitive outcome it
appears desirable to perform magnetic resonance imaging early on in each coma or stroke-like episode, and
at 2-year intervals. Investigations should include diffusion tensor imaging, axial T2 and FLAIR, sagittal and
axial T1 and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Cognitive outcomes and psychosocial issues in UCDs
Cognitive outcome appears to be poor for neonatal
onset patients, and less so for late-onset patients.
Thus, a study with 26 survivors of neonatal hyperammonemic coma found that ~79% were mentally
retarded and that the mean IQ value for the entire cohort was only 43 [180], whereas another study found
that ~50% of 33 neonatal patients but only ~25% of 59
late-onset patients presented moderate to severe intellectual disability [91]. The level and duration of hyperammonemia appear key determinants of the outcome
[13]. It was reported [4] that no UCD patient having
had >300 μmol/L initial or >480 μmol/L peak plasma
ammonia exhibited normal psychomotor development.
Nevertheless, another study [85] found average or
above average IQ values in 33%, 40% or 66% of the
ASSD, ASLD and OTCD patients studied, respectively,
although the predominance of late-onset OTCD presentations (81%) in that study might account for the
good outcome of these patients [91]. The importance
of assessing not only IQ and development but also the
specific patterns of neuropsychological strengths and
weaknesses was illustrated by the finding in late-onset
OTCD patients having normal IQ of deficits of motor
planning and execution [181] and a specific neurocognitive pattern that included weakness in fine motor
dexterity/speed and a trend towards weakness in nonverbal intelligence, visual memory, attention/executive
skills and mathematics, although verbal intelligence,
memory, learning and reading were strong [91]. In any
case, clinically asymptomatic OTC heterozygotes outperformed symptomatic heterozygotes and the performance improved with higher levels of residual urea
synthesis activity, assessed by stable isotope studies,
whereas neither the allopurinol test results nor the
mutation type correlated with neuropsychological performance in these patients [26].
Statement #40. Grade of recommendation: D
Neonatal onset and prolonged hyperammonemic coma
predict severe impairment of future neurocognitive performance. Patients with milder disease or heterozygous
carriers for OTCD may develop specific weaknesses in
several executive functions even if the IQ is normal.
Regular testing for IQ, development and specific abilities/weaknesses is recommended.
As is the general case for parents of chronically ill children
[182], UCD patients/families can have low health-related
quality of life (HrQuOL), with disease-imposed stresses perhaps amplified by delays in diagnosis and treatment resulting
from poor general awareness of these diseases [183]. Thus,
the recommendation for chronically ill patients and their families [184-186] of routine monitoring of emotional, behavioral
and psychosocial parameters also applies to UCD patients,
aiming at identifying and preventing psychosocial maladjustment [187]. Psychologists should be involved in patient care
early after diagnosis to cope with initial anxiety and with
later-developing psychological problems [186] and also to assess the cognitive level and neuropsychological functions of
the patient.
Statement #41. Grade of recommendation: D
Health-related quality of life, anxiety, stress and psychosocial
factors are important outcome parameters. Psychological
management is an important component of the care of UCD
patients and their families.
Recommendations for specific disorders
Unless indicated otherwise, these disorders require the
nutritional management given above. Table 8 gives specific recommendations for drug use in each disorder
under situations of chronic management.
NAGS and CPS1 deficiencies
These deficiencies have identical clinical and laboratory
manifestations (Figures 2). Administered carbamylglutamate can replace the missing NAG in NAGSD, and thus a
positive therapeutic response to carbamylglutamate indicates NAGSD [134]. However, one confirmed NAGSD patient was initially unresponsive to carbamylglutamate
[188] whereas some CPS1D patients gave positive
responses [189,190]. Confirmation of NAGSD or CPS1D
requires mutation analysis or enzyme activity assays on
liver biopsy when genetic diagnosis is inconclusive or rapid
diagnosis is required. However, NAGS assay is highly specialised and is performed in few laboratories. Furthermore,
abnormally low liver CPS1 activity has been reported in
patients with genetically demonstrated NAGSD [29,191] and
in the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome [192] (a
defect involving glutamate dehydrogenase). Figure 3 provides
an algorithm on how to proceed for differential diagnosis between NAGSD and/or CPS1D.
Statement #42. Grade of recommendation: D
Genetic analysis is virtually the only method of NAGSD
diagnosis, since NAGS activity assay is not generally
available.
Statement #43. Grade of recommendation: D
CPS1 assay can be faster than genetic analysis for confirming diagnosis of CPS1D, but it requires liver or intestinal mucosa. Genetic testing, although somewhat
cumbersome because of the large size of the CPS1 gene,
allows non-invasive confirmatory diagnosis.
NAGSD patients treated with carbamylglutamate
(available as oral medication) do not require protein
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 19 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

restriction or other medications except during metabolic
crises. The standard carbamylglutamate maintenance
dosage of 100–200 mg/kg/day (given in 3–4 doses)
[193], can be adjusted individually by progressive downtitration to the minimum dose required (as low as 10–15
mg/kg [194,195]) to maintain normal ammonia levels.
Long-term outcome data are scarce [194,196] but the
guideline group members know of twenty NAGSD
patients that follow this treatment approach, all of
whom are doing well. CPS1D therapy is as for other
UCDs (Tables 5 and 8). L-citrulline administration
would appear preferable over L-arginine since it
should allow for the incorporation of one nitrogen
atom into arginine and urea. However, L-citrulline is
more expensive than arginine, it is not available for
infusion and single reports indicate similar efficacy of
L-citrulline and L-arginine [128].
Statement #44. Grade of recommendation: C
Mono-therapy with carbamylglutamate is the treatment of
choice in NAGSD.
OTC deficiency
This is the most prevalent of the UCDs [1-3,197]. Due to its
X-linked nature, parental consanguinity is uncommon and
males are more frequently affected [77,197]. While neonatal
onset cases can generally be diagnosed reliably on biochemical grounds (elevated glutamine, very low/absent citrulline

and elevated urinary orotic acid; see Figure 2), diagnosis
may not be easy in the absence of a mutation in late onset
cases. OTCD can present with acute liver disease/failure that
generally recovers with metabolic management but that in
some cases required urgent liver transplantation [34]. In the
majority of female patients and in some male patients the
mutation appears de novo and the mother is not a disease
carrier [77]. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the mutation in DNA, an approach that permits detecting carrier
females and affected fetuses [197] and that can help even
genotype-based prognosis [77,198,199]. In ~20% of OTC
patients the mutation is not identified with standard techniques [77]. Liver tissue-derived RNA studies [81] or oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
[200] can be used to increase the mutation detection rate.
Liver/intestinal mucosa OTC activity assay allows diagnostic
confirmation in males, but gives less certain results in
females because of the mosaicism caused by the lyonization
process. Abnormal increases in urinary orotic acid/orotidine
excretion after allopurinol administration (the allopurinol
test) are also used to identify female carriers [201,202]. Although this test was reported initially as having 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity for OTCD [201,202], it is now clear
that false-negatives and false-positives are common ([203]
and R. Santer and V. Valayannopoulos, personal communications) and that the test is not completely specific, since
patients with ASSD, ARG1D, lysinuric protein intolerance or
the HHH syndrome can give a positive result [204]. A modified protein loading test has been reported to have increased
sensitivity [205] and to be less dangerous than older protein
loading tests [12].
Statement #45. Grades of recommendation: C-D
When genetic analysis fails, OTC enzyme activity assay in
liver or intestinal mucosa can help confirm the diagnosis.
Pedigree analysis and allopurinol testing are also helpful,
particularly for carrier identification if mutational analysis
and enzyme assays are unavailable or negative.
The treatment and the considerations concerning preference for L-citrulline over L-arginine are as for CPS1D.
Although many female patients have mild deficiency requiring little or no protein restriction, decompensation
risks dictates for these females lifelong prevention and
readiness for emergency measures, as well as twice a year
monitoring, with determination of plasma ammonia and
glutamine levels.
ASS deficiency (citrullinemia type 1)
Diagnosis is generally straightforward (Figure 2) because
of the combination of hyperammonemia and/or elevated
plasma glutamine with very high levels of plasma citrulline
and increased urinary orotic acid. ASSD can cause liver
damage and even acute liver failure [38,39]. Confirmatory
diagnosis by genetic or enzymatic methods enables prenatal testing [206] and can rule out citrullinemia type 2
(citrin deficiency). Since enzymatic analysis is complex
[207], mutation identification is preferred and may help
decide on the necessity of dietary therapy [27,78,206],
since certain genotypes are associated with a mild phenotype [27]. The report of fatal hyperammonemia under
severe catabolic circumstances in some of these asymptomatic patients [23,78,208,209] highlights the need for
appropriate monitoring and for adopting the emergency
protocol for hyperammonemia.
Statement #46. Grade of recommendation: C
Although in citrullinemia type 1 genetic analysis is the
method of choice for diagnostic confirmation and for
prenatal testing, it can reveal mild variants of citrullinemia type 1 that might need no therapy but are still at risk
of metabolic decompensation. Enzyme analysis using an
indirect assay in cultured fibroblasts can also confirm
the diagnosis.
ASL deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria)
High plasma and urine ASA levels are pathognomonic of
ASLD. Mutation identification facilitates prenatal testing
(amniotic fluid ASA level can also be used, see Table 3) and
can guide prognosis by associating specific mutations with
variant clinical courses [15,50,210,211], whereas enzyme
assay, by giving the residual ASL level, can guide management [50]. If arginine is supplied, hyperammonemia risk is
low in ASLD, since two waste nitrogen atoms are excreted
with each ASA molecule. Despite good ammonia control,
many ASLD patients experience unremitting intellectual decline, suggesting brain toxicity by ASA [130,212], decreased
amounts of guanidinoacetate [213], arginine therapy or
alterations in NO production [214]. Thus, dosages of Larginine exceeding those in other UCDs are not recommended, with a target plasma arginine level< 200 μmol/L
(generally considered a safe level, [108]). Some centers reduce protein intake when plasma ASA level is >400
μmol/L, but the benefit of this approach remains to be
proven. Neonatal (and apparently also late-onset) ASLD
patients can present with hepatomegaly and progressive
liver disease [215], the latter apparently associated with
elevated plasma triglycerides (C. Dionisi-Vici and J.V.
Leonard, personal communications). For unknown reasons
ASLD is occasionally associated with reduced serum
potassium requiring oral K+ supplementation (C. DionisiVici, personal communication).
Statement #47. Grade of recommendation: C
Neither genetic analysis nor enzyme activity determinations are needed to confirm the diagnosis of ASLD.
Genetic analysis is recommended for prenatal testing but
ASA determination in the amniotic fluid is also reliable.
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 21 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

Statement #48. Grade of recommendation: D
ASLD treatment exclusively with high-dose L-arginine
supplementation is not recommended because of possible
side-effects. For long-term management L-arginine should
be given at the same dosages as for other UCDs in combination with sodium benzoate and protein restriction.
Arginase 1 deficiency (argininemia)
ARG1D markedly differs from other UCDs in that it rarely
manifests in the neonatal period [216-218], causing progressive spastic paraplegia and developmental delay between 2 and 4 years of age, with hepatomegaly and in
some cases with hyperammonemic episodes [21] although
metabolic decompensations are rarer than in other UCDs
[21,219]. The increased plasma arginine level is the disease
hallmark, but this increase may be small [220], rendering
highly desirable the confirmation of the diagnosis by enzymatic assays easily carried out in erythrocytes [76] or by
genetic analysis [219,221]. Increased urinary orotic acid
excretion also supports the diagnosis [222].
Since arginine and its metabolites (e.g. guanidinoacetate,
also found elevated in ARG1D [21,223]) are likely to be
toxic, the goal is to reduce plasma arginine below 200
μmol/L. This requires severe natural protein restriction
[220] and increased use of EAA supplementation (up to
~50% of the protein requirement). Sodium benzoate and
sodium phenylacetate [224] are used to support this treatment, which should ideally halt disease progression [21] although it is uncertain if it can reverse the spastic diplegia.
Statement #49. Grade of recommendation: D
ARG1D manifestations differ remarkably from those in
other UCDs. Treatment follows the standard UCD
recommendations (without the use of L-arginine) but
requires particularly severe protein restriction to reduce
plasma arginine levels to <200 μmol/L.
HHH syndrome
The manifestations differ from those of other UCDs and
almost always include spastic paraparesis, which sets in
more slowly than in ARG1D, preceded by hyperreflexia
and other pyramidal signs [22,225]. Liver dysfunction and
coagulopathy, with defects of factors VII, IX and X, are
more common than in other UCDs [35,225]. The characteristic biochemical profile comprising a combination of
hyperammonemia, elevated plasma ornithine and urinary
excretion of homocitrulline and frequently also of orotate
[226], generally renders further confirmatory tests unnecessary (such as determination of 14C-ornithine incorporation into protein in cultured skin fibroblasts or liver
tissue [227], or mutation analysis [22,228]). Long-term
therapy, consisting of a low-protein diet and L-citrulline
supplementation (Table 8) prevents hyperammonemia and
liver disease but apparently not the spastic paraparesis
[22,225,229] although further studies are needed to assess
the impact of treatment on the neurological derangements.
Creatine deficiency was reported in this syndrome
[229,230], supporting creatine supplementation if plasma
creatine levels are low.
Statement #50. Grade of recommendation: D
Low-protein diet, L-citrulline and maybe also creatine
supplementation are recommended in the HHH syndrome. The impact of these measures on neurological
outcome remains to be ascertained.
New trends and emerging therapies
Potential new approaches for diagnosis, prognosis and
novel therapies
Whole body ureogenic flow, assessed by using heavy isotopes and mass spectrometry, was shown to detect poor
CPS1 activation in NAGSD [132,135,231,232] and was
potentially useful for measuring in vivo urea cycle function. Use of MRS to detect elevated glutamine and
decreased myo-inositol brain levels was reported to identify
symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects with partial OTCD
[173,174]. Advances in genotyping and in mutation analysis
techniques should increase the sensitivity of mutation identification [81,200,233]. The increasing number of “normal”
human genomes sequenced [234] should facilitate the distinction between polymorphisms and disease-causing mutations. Ongoing advances in modelling algorithms combined
with improved knowledge of protein structure allow increasingly accurate prediction of the consequences of point
mutations [235,236], although structures still remain to be
determined for ORNT1, NAGS and CPS1 (but the human
CPS1 C-terminal domain structure is known, see [237]).
Structural information may also open the way to diseaseand mutation-tailored pharmacological approaches [237].
Improved expression systems (see for example [238]) can be
the bases for screening the effects of novel agents on mutant proteins, as exemplified recently with phenylalanine
hydroxylase for treating phenylketonuria [239]. In this respect, the range of animal models for UCDs is still limited
and some do not accurately replicate the human deficiency
as in the case of the mouse knockout model for ARG1D
[240]. Therefore, the development of other models such as
conditional knockouts or transgenic mutants is essential.
Experimental therapies
Neuroprotective measures based on the use of pharmacological agents [241-245] or of hypothermia [246,247] are
under investigation to treat hepatic and hyperammonemic
encephalopathy. Mild systemic hypothermia (rectal
temperature of 34°C for 48 h), together with hemofiltration
in a neonatal UCD patient with hyperammonemic coma
was reported [248], resulting in a striking fall in plasma ammonia. A randomized controlled study for the use of
Häberle et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:32 Page 22 of 30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/32

hypothermia in neonatal hyperammonemia is planned in
the US (U. Lichter-Konecki, personal communication).
Statement #51. Grade of recommendation: D
Hypothermia might be a supportive therapeutic option
in acute hyperammonemia that is under study. Its use
cannot be recommended outside controlled studies.
Hepatocyte transplantation is being proposed [249-252]
as a bridging therapeutic measure in compromised UCD
patients while waiting for liver transplantation [251]. Currently, there are studies underway testing the safety and efficacy of the procedure.
Statement #52. Grade of recommendation: D
Hepatocyte transplantation is still an experimental technique that should only be used as a part of standardized
study protocols.
Gene transfer studies have been carried out in animal models of OTCD and ASSD [253-258], with report of long-term OTCD correction by using
woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE)-mediated overexpression and a
helper-dependent adenovirus [253]. One adenoviral
gene therapy study for OTCD carried out in humans
did not efficiently increase enzyme activity but caused
inflammation and death in one enrolled subject
[259,260]. Therefore, the promise of gene therapy
remains to be fulfilled for UCDs, although the encouraging results from animal studies support continued
efforts in this area.
Statement #53. Grade of recommendation: D
At present, there is no role for gene therapy in the treatment of UCDs.
Since arginase catalyzes a hydrolytic reaction, ARG1D is
the one UCD in which enzyme replacement therapy is most
likely to work. Prior attempts have been based on the use of
virus-encoded [261] or erythrocyte-contained arginase
[262,263]. Frequent blood transfusions help to almost
normalize plasma arginine [263] and might be useful for
gaining time in order to start definitive therapy [262]. However, pegylated human recombinant arginase 1 (PEG-BCT100) is now available and is being used in a clinical trial for
cancer (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00988195),
opening the way to potential testing of its efficacy in
ARG1D.
Statement #54. Grade of recommendation: D
At present, there is no role for enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of UCDs.
Closing remarks
Although these guidelines are the result of a three-year Delphi process aiming at delivering the best available level of
evidence for any given recommendation, the rarity of these
diseases, with little clustering of cases in single centers, has
resulted in mostly C or D levels of evidence for the statements made here, which correspond to inferences derived
from non-analytical studies such as case reports or case
series or from expert opinion. Therefore, the recommendations contained herein should not be considered infallible
or absolute. The working group of these guidelines commits
itself to revise the work in the future in an effort to preserve
the achieved quality and to search for higher evidence levels
that might accrue with time. Indeed, it is hoped that many
of the statements will be substituted in forthcoming years
by even more precise and effective recommendations to the
benefit of the patients. Moreover, the impact of these guidelines on patients’ outcome is planned to be evaluated after
some years which will in addition help to improve any
updated guidelines, possibly increasing also the level of
evidence.
