It is important that extrahepatic arteries are identified precisely at the time of graft procurement. We present a case where the 
accessory right hepatic artery of the liver was ligated leading to postoperative liver abscess formation in the liver graft. A forty-seven-year-old female patient diagnosed with liver cirrhosis underwent orthotopic cadaveric liver transplantation due to 
altered mentality. The donor graft showed a variant of the hepatic artery anatomy where an accessory right hepatic artery 
arose from the superior mesenteric artery. This artery was accidentally transected during procurement. Since the back bleeding test using perfusion fluid was good, the artery was ligated. Postoperative abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a 6 cm low attenuating lesion in the liver. The patient underwent conservative treatment. We believe that even small 
accessory arteries (1 to 2 mm) should be reconstructed whenever possible to avoid postoperative complications such as liver 
abscess.

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage liver disease. During the last decade, 
improvements in immunosuppressive drugs, surgical 
techniques, and preservation fluids have achieved better 
short-term and long-term outcomes. It is well known that 
during donor hepatectomy, recognition of hepatic arterial 
variations is mandatory for the safety of the graft and of 
the recipient. The absence of an adequate hepatic arterial 
supply usually results in graft loss or ischemic biliary 
injuries. Vascular complications after liver transplantation 
are associated with a poor outcome for both the graft and 
the patient. The most common vascular complication after 
liver transplantation is hepatic artery thrombosis, occurring in 2 to 12% of transplants [1].

The vascular anatomy of the liver is varied. The 
"normal" anatomy i.e., the common hepaticartery originating from the celiac trunk and branching close to the parenchyma into the left and right hepatic arteries is seen in 
55 to 80% of the cases [2-5]. Under variant patterns, the 
lobes may receive blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), left gastric artery, aorta, or other visceral branches. These vessels may be accessory, occurring in 
addition to the normal arterial supply, or replaced, representing the primary arterial supply to the lobe. It is important that extrahepatic arteries are identified precisely 
at the time of graft procurement to avoid injuries that 
might compromise liver function. Thus, the presence of all 
arteries that are accessory or replaced must be demonstrated. Whether an individual vessel is accessory or replaced is not always determined, because the intrahepatic 
branches are not dissected. In 42% of cases of variant hepatic arterial anatomy a reconstruction was required before 
liver transplant [2-5]. We present a case where the accessory right hepatic artery of the liver was ligated leading 
to postoperative liver abscess formation in the posterior 
section of the liver graft.

CASE REPORT
A forty-seven-year-old female patient diagnosed with 
cryptogenic liver cirrhosis underwent orthotopic cadaveric liver transplantation due to altered mentality. Her 
model for end stage liver disease score was 33. During the 
operation, the donor graft showed a variant of the hepatic 
artery anatomy where anaccessory right hepatic artery 
arose from the SMA presumably supplying the posterior 
section of the liver graft. This artery was accidentally 
transected during procurement. At the back table, anastomosis of the accessory artery, the size of which was 1 mm, 
with the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) or splenic artery 
was not possible due to size discrepancy. Since the back 
bleeding test using organ preservation fluid (Custodiol 
HTK solution, Dr. Franz Köhler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) was good, the artery was ligated. 
Although the initial aspartateaminotransferase and alanineaminotransferase levels were 2,871 IU/L and 1,539 IU/L, 
respectively, they began to decrease postoperatively. The 
postoperative doppler sonogram demonstrated normal 
wave form of the right and left hepatic arteries with a resistive index of 0.6 (Fig. 1). On the tenth postoperative day, 
an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan among 
other studies was performed due to persistent fever and 
positive blood cultures for enterococci. The CT scan revealed a 6 cm multilobulating low attenuating lesion in the 
right posterior section of the liver (Fig. 2A). With the impression of liver abscess, the patient underwent conservative treatment including antibiotic therapy using 
vancomycin and levofloxacin. On follow-up CT scans, the 
size of the lesion decreased without any draining procedure (Fig. 2B). 
DISCUSSION
Michels' classic autopsy series of 200 dissections, published in 1966, defined the basic anatomic variations in 
hepatic arterial supply and has served as the benchmark 
for all subsequent contributions in this area. Variant patterns occurred in 45% of cases, and arteries could be defined as accessory or replaced because dissection was carried into the liver substance. Michels' motivation was to 
maximize the database for surgeons performing procedures in and around the portahepatis, to avoid injury to 
vascular and ductal structures [2].
Complications associated with hepatic artery reconstructions are one of the major causes of graft loss and 
mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) [6]. 
Hepatic artery complications after OLT include hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, hepatic artery 
pseudoaneurysm, and hepatic artery fistula. The early 
complications of hepatic artery are usually caused by technical problems. The late complications of hepatic artery 
are usually associated with hypercoagulable state, over 
transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma during the 
surgery, severe rejection, and bileleakage [6]. The hepatic 
artery is relatively small (3 to 6 mm in diameter in adults) 
and has a very fragile intima that requires a careful atraumatic manipulating technique during reconstruction [7]. 
The anatomical variations, diameter and length of hepatic 
artery, and injury to vessels including prolonged clamping 
of hepatic artery, kinking of a long artery, and hematoma 
of the artery wall from improper flushing afterclamping 
during operation, and the quality of recipient vessels and 
mismatch between donor and recipient arterial vessels 
should be carefully considered and managed preoperatively and intraoperatively [6,7].
The detection of accessory hepatic arteries is an important issue during liver harvesting procedures [3,8]. The 
most frequent is the presence of an accessory artery supplying the left hepatic lobe from the left gastric artery [2]. 
This variation is not by itself an indication for vascular reconstruction [3,8]. What is important is the detection of an 
additional vessel supplying the right liver lobe from the 
SMA, which is also one of the most common anatomic variations of the donor hepatic artery in liver transplantation 
[2,3,8]. Most typically, this artery runs backward from the 
head of the pancreas to the rear portion of the hepatoduodenal ligament. This topographic pattern mayoften be difficult to diagnose; it is frequently responsible for 
inadvertent damage to the arterial system during the harvesting procedure [3,8]. Several methods for reconstruction have been described [6-8]. In a report by Di Benedetto 
et al. [8], after preserving the SMA stump (with the right

hepatic artery branching from the SMA) originating from 
the aorta during donor procurement, they proposed a 
method in which the recipient common hepatic artery is 
anastomosed to the distal end of the donor SMA, and the 
proximal end of the donor SMA is anastomosed to the donor proper hepatic artery. Since the accessory right hepatic 
artery was inadvertently transected away from the origin 
of the SMA during procurement, in addition to size discrepancy between the accessory right hepatic artery and 
GDA or splenic artery, reconstruction using the above 
methods was not possible. 
In a study by Ikegami et al. [9], during living-related liver transplantation (LRLT), where multiple graft arteries 
were present, both were anastomosed when the largest 
two were almost the same in diameter. When differences 
in diameter were noted among the graft arteries, the thickest one was reconstructed first. When pulsatile blood flowed from the stumps that had not been anastomosed the remaining arteries were not anastomosed. When pulsatile 
bleeding from the nonanastomosed stumps was not observed after rearterialization of the largest artery, all were 
anastomosed to the recipient hepatic arteries. They concluded that although several hepatic arteries may supply 
the potential allograft in LRLT, it is not always necessary to 
reconstruct all of them [9]. In the present case, back bleeding was tested using perfusion fluid. We believe that back 
bleeding might have been more accurately evaluated after 
reconstruction of the main hepatic artery.
However, Yanaga et al. [10] reported the clinical course 
of five patients with partial dearterialization of their hepatic allografts. One patient died and three others suffered 
serious morbidity as a direct or indirect result of this 
complication. They concluded that partial dearterialization of the liver allograft results in a serious and potentially life-threatening complication for which preservation 
of the complete hepatic arterial supply is important, even 
if this requires reconstruction of the aberrant vessels [10]. 
In addition, hepatic artery ligation can lead to liver infarction and subsequent liver abscess [10].
In conclusion, although the liver abscess subsided in 
our patient, since whether an individual vessel is accessory or replaced is not always determined, we believe 
that even small accessory arteries (1 to 2 mm) should be reconstructed whenever possible even if good back bleeding 
exists to avoid postoperative complications such as liver 
abscess.
