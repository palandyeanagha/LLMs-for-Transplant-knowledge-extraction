Abstract
Purpose of Review Accumulating evidence suggest that selected patients with nonresectable liver only metastases from colorectal cancer can be offered liver transplantation with acceptable outcome. This review provides an update on the scientific
literature.
Recent Findings The SECA-I study showed an estimated 5-year survival of 60% in a heterogenous patient population and guided
the development of the first clinical selection criteria. In the sequel SECA-II trial, an estimated 5-year survival of 83% was
obtained. A recent study shows that an Oslo score of 0–2, a metabolic tumor volume below 70 cm3 on PET-CT or Fong score of
0–2 at time of listing, can stratify patients with superior survival. Recurrence is common, but about 70% are slow-growing lung
metastases, whereof the majority are resectable.
Summary Liver transplantation for colorectal liver metastasis is an option in highly selected patients. Futile use of grafts can be
avoided by applying stringent selection criteria.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide with a particular high prevalence in the developed countries [1]. For the last decennials, there has been an
increase in cases in the younger age groups [2, 3].
Almost 50% of CRC patients will develop metastasis, and
the liver is the most often involved organ. The only treatment
option providing potential long-term survival for colorectal
liver metastasis (CRLM) is hepatic resection. The outcomes
in terms of overall survival rates (OS) following liver resection
are variable, ranging from about 30 to 60% at 5 years.
Prognostic factors influencing OS are metastatic tumor load
in terms of number of liver metastases and maximal size of the
largest lesion, plasma CEA levels, mutational status of the
RAS oncogenes, node status of the primary, presence of extrahepatic metastases, and sideness (right sided versus left
sided) of the primary tumor [4–8]. Well-selected patients
may obtain a 5-year survival rate between 50 and 60% [9].
Criteria for resectability have changed over time by the
introduction of efficient chemotherapy for downstaging and
techniques like two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) [8, 10].
Furthermore, the size of the future liver remnant (FLR) may
be augmented by portal vein embolization (PVE) or associating liver partition and staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) to increase resectability [11]. Nevertheless, only 20–25% of patients with CRLM are suitable for resection during the course
of the disease [12]. Hence, the standard treatment option for
most patients remains palliative chemotherapy and the 5-year
overall survival rates are about 10% [13].
The idea of LT to treat hepatic malignances is as old as
transplant itself [14], but the early enthusiasm was curbed by
dismal results. In 1991 the Vienna Group reported an OS at
5 years of 12% and recurrence rate over 60% for LT in patients
with unresectable CRLM [15]. In the same era, according to
European Liver Transplant Registry data, 45 patients

underwent LT because of CRLM and 3- and 5-year OS rates
were only 32% and 19%, respectively [16, 17]. Based on these
experiences, CRLM were considered a contraindication for
LT and for many years the Vienna study remained an isolated
experience.
Study Outcomes
The first proof of concept trial, the SEcondary CAncer
(SECA) I study, was started in Oslo in 2006 [18] The outcomes reported in 21 patients were beyond expectations for
unresectable CRLM with estimated OS of 95%, 68%, and
60% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The recurrence rate
was, however, high, with disease-free survival (DFS) as low
as 35% at 1 year. Most recurring patients developed slowgrowing lung metastases, and a large proportion of these were
resectable. Due to aggressive policy of resection of all possible recurrences, a favorable overall survival was obtained despite the short DFS. Based on the SECA-1 trial, the following
risk factors for poor outcome were identified [18]: maximal
tumor diameter > 5.5 cm, time from primary cancer surgery <
2 years, CEA levels > 80 μg/L, and progression disease after
chemotherapy at the time of LT. Assigning 1 point to each
adverse factor led to the development of the so-called Oslo
Score for risk stratification.
In the sequel trial (SECA-II), the Oslo score was not applied prospectively, but the more stringent inclusion criteria
resulted in selection of a cohort with an Oslo score of 0–2
[19••]. As anticipated, with stricter patient selection, survival
improved accordingly. The estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS
was 100%, 83%, and 83%, respectively. Median DFS was
13.7 months with 1-, 2-, and 3-year DFS of 53%, 44%, and
35%. Nevertheless, survival after relapse at 1, 2, and 4 years
was 100%, 73%, and 73%, respectively. Again, about 70% of
the recurrences observed were lung metastases and the majority were resected.
A comparison between patients transplanted for CRLMand HCC shows that patients with nonresectable CRLM with
a pre-transplant Oslo score of 0–2 had a 5-year survival rate
better than or similar to patients with HCC [20]. Even though
HCC patients have much better DFS, HCC recurrence after
transplant is associated with a dismal prognosis for almost all
patients since there is a lack of effective salvage treatment,
while the 2-year OS rate after relapse is 86% in wellselected CRLM patients.
The Controversy of Resectability of CRLM
The whole experience with LT for CRLM has been based on
patients with unresectable disease. The concept of
resectability of liver tumors has however changed considerably during the last 20 years.
A systematic review of the literature on TSH [21] reports a
median 5-year OS of 42% while 5-year DFS was reported
only in three studies of the aforementioned meta-analyses at
values of 13%, 14%, and 20%, respectively. Furthermore,
only 77% of the patients completed the two stages. More
recently, Regimbeau [22] analyzed the data from the international LiverMetSurvey registry. The scheduled TSH plan was
completed in 71.9% of the study population. The 5-year OS
rate after resection was 23%. No patient that failed to complete
the two stages survived for 5 years according to this study.
The overall perioperative safety seems to be better following TSH compared to ALPPS, but oncological outcomes including recurrence-free and overall survival are comparable
[23]. The first randomized controlled trial, comparing traditional TSH with the ALPPS procedure, shows that the resectability rate was significantly higher with ALPPS than with
TSH, with similar rates of severe complications, mortality,
and negative surgical margins in the liver [11]. Even if resectability rate can be greatly improved by extended techniques
like TSH and ALPPS, the outcomes are mostly inferior compared to upfront resectable patients.
The concept of tumor burden score was introduced by
Sasaki et al. [24]. Based on this concept, Oshi et al. [25]
demonstrate that the more the TBS increases, the less significant the margin status is for DSF and OS, while biological
factors, like KRAS status, CEA level and response to preoperative chemotherapy, gain significance accordingly.
Thus, there may be a threshold of tumor load for which liver
resection can yield acceptable outcomes, independent of technique. One might hypothesize whether LT could provide far
better outcomes than liver resection in a subset of patients with
borderline resectable disease. In fact, some of the best outcomes after LT for CRLM have been in patients previously
resected but finally becoming unresectable due to recurrence
in the liver. The concept of including a small subset of resectable patients is however highly controversial and still merely
an untested hypothesis. To our knowledge, no data are available on this topic but this might be a possible extension when
LT for CRLM gains broader acceptance.
The Impact of Recurrence
An Achilles heel of LT for CRLM may be the high recurrence
rate and relatively short DFS. Toso et al. reported a DFS of
56% ± 14%, 38% ± 15%, and 38% ± 15% at 1, 3, and 5 years
respectively [26•]. The OSLO experience, from the SECA II
trial is very similar [19••]. The median time to recurrence was
6 months, and the lung was the first single site of recurrence in
majority of cases [27]. It is noteworthy that the pattern of
recurrence is vastly different between liver transplantation
312 Curr Transpl Rep (2020) 7:311–316

and liver resection. In the transplant scenario, 68% were lung
metastases and liver was affected only in 5% of cases.
Thirteen (62%) patients had lungs as first metastatic site, and
50% of these did not develop other metastases. Both patients
treated with lung resection and those not resected were alive at
the end of follow-up. The 5-year survival of patients with lung
recurrence after LT was 72%. By retrospectively backtracking
pre-transplant thoracic CT scans, the presence of lung metastases at the time of LT did not seem to seriously affect survival
negatively and immunosuppression does not seem to accelerate their growth [28]. In contrast, liver recurrence after LT was
seen only as part of disseminated disease and had a very poor
prognosis [27].
In liver resection cohorts, the overall recurrence rate is
about 50–70% and about half of the relapses are new liver
metastases [29–31]. The 5-year OS after pulmonary recurrence in resected patients has been reported to be 40% [29].
Nonetheless, treatment of recurrence has proven to improve
survival after hepatic resection for CRLM [32, 33]; likewise,
the same strategy is effective for relapse after LT [19, 27].
There seems to be a low correlation between DFS and OS in
LT for CRLM. Consequently, DFS is not an optimal outcome
parameter to assess the efficacy of LT in CRLM [20, 34].
Strategies for Improving Access to Liver
Transplantation for CRLM
The limiting factor for a broader implementation of liver transplantation for CRLM remains the scarcity of liver grafts. To
overcome this problem, we need to move in two directions:
improve patient selection and expand the donor pool.
Essentially, improved patient selection implies a better understanding of the tumor biology to improve outcomes and
avoid the futile use of liver grafts. Within the Oslo Criteria, the
CEA level and the response to chemotherapy are surrogates
for the biological behavior of the disease. A Fong Clinical
Risk Score of 0–2 has also been shown to be associated with
superior long-term survival, and this score shares some factors
with the Oslo Score [5, 35]. Some other factors are distinctly
associated with inferior survival: right-sided primary tumor
location [35, 36] and a metabolic tumor volume (MTV) exceeding 70 cm3 on pre-transplant 18F–FDG PET/CT [37] are
both strong predictors of inferior outcome. Moreover, patients
that, on quality of life assessment with European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire version
3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) prior to transplant, display a high
score, and in particularly those that have loss of appetite, have
significantly worse survival [38••]. An overview of factors
important to patient selection is summarized in Fig. 1.
Dependent on which criteria are applied, the impact on the
transplant waiting list will vary accordingly. Based on stringent
selection, calculated based on SECA-studies and Norwegian
population, only 0.24 to 0.51 patient per 1 million people per
year would be eligible, representing 1 to 2% of yearly liver
transplants (based on US population) [35••], meaning that the
required resources do not necessarily negatively impact the
patients with conventional indications for LT.
Regarding the donor pool expansion, a logical solution
would be to use extended criteria donors (ECDs) for CRLM
patients [36••], assuming that these recipients will tolerate
ECD grafts better due to the absence of hepatic failure and
portal hypertension. Another, potentially promising approach
is based on split liver technique and auxiliary transplantation.
The novel concept of RAPID (Resection And Partial Liver
Segment 2/3 Transplantation With Delayed Total
Hepatectomy) technique [39] allows maintenance of adequate
metabolic liver mass during which a small auxiliary graft can
regenerate to allow delayed second stage hepatectomy.
Augmented regeneration of the graft is facilitated by diverting
portal blood flow from the liver remnant, but importantly, this
should be done under pressure guidance to avoid small-forsize syndrome (SFSS) damage to the graft [40]. As soon as the
graft has obtained a size approaching 0.8% of body weight (or

35 to 40% of recipient standard liver volume), the second
stage hepatectomy of the native liver remnant is completed
within 3 weeks. The concept has been further developed by
retrieving the left lateral graft from living donors. To date, 6
two-stage hepatectomies with auxiliary partial orthotopic liver
transplantation from a living donor (named LD-RAPID) have
been reported: 5 in Germany [41, 42] and 1 in Belgium [43].
The first results are promising, but still the experience with the
RAPID concept is limited and does not yet allow firm
conclusions.
Finally, conventional living donor liver transplantation
could be an option for centers that offer this option, and studies are currently ongoing within this area (Table 1).
Conclusion
Selected patients with CRLM with low Oslo score or low
Fong Clinical risk score at listing can be offered liver transplantation with survival outcomes comparable to conventional
indications for liver transplantation. Stringent selection criteria
are important to avoid futile use of grafts. Expansion of the
donor pool may be obtained through increased use of ECD
grafts, the RAPID technique, and living donor liver transplantation. To further improve the outcomes based upon shared
best practices, all transplants for this indication should be part
of prospective clinical trials.
