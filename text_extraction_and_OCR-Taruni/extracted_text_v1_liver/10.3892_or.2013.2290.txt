Abstract. The aim of the present study was to determine 
the treatment outcome and prognostic factors for survival 
in patients with peripheral intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(ICC). A retrospective chart review was performed for patients 
diagnosed with ICC between 2000 and 2009 at a single institution. We identified a total of 105 patients with ICC. Among 
them, 63.8% were older than 60 years of age, 50.5% were male 
and 88.6% were Caucasian. By preoperative imaging approximately half of the patients (50.5%) were surgical candidates 
and underwent resection. The other half of the patients (49.5%) 
were unresectable. The unresectable group received chemoradiotherapy (53%) and transarterial chemoembolization (7.7%) 
as palliative treatments while 23.0% of the patients (12/52) 
received best supportive care alone. The median survival rates 
were 16.1 months (13.1-19.2) for the entire cohort, 27.6 months 
(17.7-37.6) for curative resection, 12.9 months (6.5-19.2) for 
palliative chemoradiotherapy and 4.9 months (0.4-9.6) for 
best supportive care (P<0.001). Independent predictors on 
multivariate analysis were advanced stage at diagnosis and 
treatment received. In those patients who underwent resection, advanced AJCC stage and presence of microvascular 
invasion were also independent predictors of poor survival. 
We concluded that surgery offers the most beneficial curative 
option and outcome, emphasizing the importance of resectability as a major prognostic factor. The present study also 
revealed that use of chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting 
failed to improve survival but its palliative use in those patients 
with unresectable ICC offered a modest survival advantage 
over best supportive care. The overriding factors influencing 
outcome were stage and the presence of microvascular invasion on pathology.
Introduction
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) are the second most 
common primary liver malignancy, and they arise from bile 
duct epithelium within the liver. While 90% of primary liver 
cancers are hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), ICC cases 
account for the remaining 5-10% (1,2). ICCs are relatively 
rare malignancies with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 461 
per 100,000 individuals reported between 1973 and 2007, 
as per a recent SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End 
Results) report (2). While the incidence and mortality of the 
more common malignancies such as colon, breast and lung are 
reported to be on a decline nationwide, the incidence of ICC 
has been on the rise (3-5). In a study based on the SEER database, the incidence and mortality rates of ICC have markedly 
increased between 1973 and 1997, with an estimated annual 
percent change (EAPC) of 9.11 and 9.44%, respectively (4).
ICC usually presents sporadically as a discrete intrahepatic mass in patients over 65 years of age (6). These tumors 
are lethal malignancies with a median survival of 6.5 months 
from the time of diagnosis, in untreated patients (7). The 
main risk factor for ICC is primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC). Recent studies have reported a few additional risk 
factors including HIV infection, smoking, diabetes, cirrhosis 
and hepatitis C (HCV) infection (5,8-10). The association 
between HCV and ICC has gained special attention since the 
incidences of both are on the rise. A cohort study of a large 
group of US veterans suggested that HCV infection conferred 
a >2-fold rise in the risk of ICC (11). However, regardless of 
etiology, surgical resection offers the only prospect of cure. 
Yet, only a small percentage of patients with ICC are resectable at the time of diagnosis. For patients with unresectable 
disease, palliative chemoradiotherapy or palliative ablation/
chemoembolization are the major options.
Given the rising incidence of ICC, its poor prognosis and 
lack of adequate treatment options, further studies clarifying 
its risk factors, outcomes and prognostic factors are warranted. 
Most of the existing studies in the US are on surgical patients, 
and they usually span over a period of decades since this is 
a rare tumor. A number of questions remain regarding the 
Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors 
of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

pathogenesis, criteria for resectability, appropriate adjuvant 
therapy and palliative therapy. Hence, we conducted a 10-year 
retrospective study of all patients with ICC treated between 
2000 and 2009 at a single institution to evaluate the outcome 
of various treatments and to assess prognostic factors.
Patients and methods
The present study was conducted after obtaining approval 
from the University of Florida Institutional Review Board.
Patients diagnosed with ICC who underwent treatment at our 
institution between 2000 and 2009 were included in our study 
group. The following data were collected for all patients: age, 
gender, race, date of diagnosis, presenting complaint, liver 
function tests at diagnosis, CA 19-9 and CEA levels, stage at 
diagnosis, presence of metastases, resectability of tumor, date 
of surgery, pathologic characteristics of tumor, chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy, recurrence date and site, and date and cause 
of death.
At the time of diagnosis the tumor stage was assessed by 
abdominal computed tomography (CT) or abdominal magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with cholangiopancreatography 
(MRCP). Preoperative evaluation of vascular involvement 
was carried out with CT/MRI to determine resectability. In 
appropriate patients, the tumor was staged by an exploratory 
laparotomy with intra-operative ultrasound and biopsy. 
Pre-operative assessment was also performed for extrahepatic 
primary tumors and metastatic disease. The American Joint 
Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against 
Cancer (UICC) staging system (7th edition) TNM classification was used for staging the resected tumors in patients who 
underwent surgery (12).
The treatment modality that each patient received was 
determined by a multidisciplinary tumor board. Patients did 
not undergo curative resection if they had metastatic disease 
at diagnosis, or extensive local vascular invasion or multiple 
medical comorbidities making them poor surgical candidates. 
In patients who did not have any of the above, macroscopic 
curative resection was carried out. Hepatic resection was 
the main surgery performed, and its extent depended on the 
segments involved by the tumor. Extrahepatic bile duct resection with Roux-en-Y reconstruction was carried out in patients 
with bile duct invasion or lymph node metastases. All patients 
undergoing surgery underwent assessment of lymph node 
status unless intraperitoneal spread or clear unresectability 
was identified prior to lymph node assessment. Lymph node 
dissection included the hepatoduodenal ligament and the porta 
hepatis. Patients with nodal positivity or positive resection 
margins were considered to be at high risk for recurrence and 
were offered adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Patients with unresectable tumors were treated with palliative chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy or transarterial chemoembolization. Some 
patients declined these treatments and received best supportive 
care.
Pathologic examination was carried out on all resected 
tumors. They were examined for tumor size and number, 
histologic differentiation, and the presence of vascular and 
perineural invasion. In situations where nodes were dissected, 
they were examined for the presence of tumor. Surgical 
margins were examined for the presence of residual tumor. 
Surrounding liver parenchyma was examined for the presence 
of changes suggestive of PSC or cirrhosis or other predisposing 
factors.
After diagnosis, all patients were followed up closely in 
the clinic. Patients who underwent resection receive regular 
clinical follow-up along with blood draw for blood chemistry, 
liver function tests, CA 19-9 level and were screened for 
recurrence at 6 monthly intervals with CT scans of the chest, 
abdomen and pelvis.
Study objectives aimed to determine the risk factors, 
clinical features, treatment outcome and prognostic factors for 
survival in patients with ICC.
Statistical significance of the difference between the means 
of quantitative variables was tested using the independent t-test, 
and the Chi-square test was used for comparing categorical 
variables. A P-value of 0.05 was held as significant. The KaplanMeier method was used to estimate survival, and the duration 
of survival was derived from the survival curves. Survival of 
patients in the study group was calculated from the time of 
diagnosis. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank 
test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards method with backward Wald. Only factors found 
to be significant on univariate analysis were included in the 
regression mode,l and a P-value of 0.10 was used to determine 
if the variable was to be included in the next step.
Results
Of the 314 patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma during 
the study period, 105 (33.4%) had intrahepatic tumors. Table I 
describes the demographic and clinical features of the patients 
in the study group. An equal percentage of the genders was 
present (male 50.5%). The majority of patients were older than 
40 years (63.8%) and Caucasian (88.6%). The most common 
presenting complaint was abdominal pain (34.3%), and in a 
similar percentage of patients the tumor was found incidenFigure 1. Survival of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma based on

tally on imaging (30.5%). The tumors arose de novo in 82.9% 
patients without underlying hepatobiliary disease (87/105). 
Only a minority of the patients had underlying cirrhosis (9.5%) 
and PSC/UC (6.7%). A majority of patients presented with 
a solitary tumor (73.3%). The mean tumor size was 5.9 cm 
(range 1.8-15.0)
Median overall survival was 16.1 months (95% CI 
13.1-19.2). The survival rates were 63% at 1 year, 17% at 3 
years and 9% at 5 years. The median survival after surgical 
resection was 27.6 months (17.7-37.6), with palliative treatment it was 12.9 months (6.5-19.2) and with best supportive

care it was 4.9 months (0.4-9.7) (Fig. 1). Metastatic disease 
was present at diagnosis in 24 patients (22.9%). The most 
common sites of metastases were the lung in 8 patients 
(33.3%) and the peritoneum in 8 patients (33.3%). On 
univariate analysis, factors associated with survival included 
tumor stage at diagnosis (P<0.001), total bilirubin >2 mg/dl 
(P=0.032), presence of metastases at diagnosis (P=0.008) 
and treatment received (P<0.001) (Table II). Age, gender, 
ethnicity, albumin <3 gm/dl, underlying risk factors, and 
elevated CA 19-9 were not associated with survival. On 
multivariate analysis, advanced stage at diagnosis (P=0.027) 
and treatment received (P<0.001) were significant independent predictors of survival (Table II).
Of the 105 patients, 53 patients underwent curative surgical resection (50.5%). The type of surgery they

positive. Histopathologic examination revealed the presence 
of microvascular invasion in 54.7%. The distribution in the 
different AJCC 7 stages was as follows: I (34.7%), II (18.4%), 
III (12.2%) and IVa (34.7%). The median survival of patients 
with stage I was 36.3 months, stage II was 27.1 months, stage 
III 20.3 months, and stage Iva was 16.1 months (P<0.001). 
When tumors were classified on the basis of diameter of the 
largest lesion, 53.1% of tumors were found to be >5 cm. Yet, 
size was not noted to influence survival when considered 
as a continuous or as a categorical variable (0.875). Among 
the components of AJCC staging, nodal positivity was found 
to most strongly influence staging (P<0.001 on Chi-square 
test), and the strength of association as assessed by Kendall's 
Tau-B for this relationship was 0.753.
In 21 patients, surgery was followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (39.6%). The median survival after resection 
was 27.6 months (17.7-37.6). The survival rates were 82% 
at 1 year, 33% at 3 years and 19% at 5 years. The median 
survival in patients with a microscopic negative margin on 
final pathology (R0 resection) was 28.9 months (22.7-35.1). 
Table III describes the prognostic factors for survival after 
resection. On univariate analysis, the AJCC stage of the tumor 
(P<0.001), the presence of microvascular invasion (P=0.006), 
perineural invasion (P=0.004), nodal positivity (P=0.002) and 
positive margins (P=0.028) were factors influencing survival. 
On multivariate analysis, advanced AJCC stage (P=0.007) 
and presence of microvascular invasion (P=0.013) were found 
to be significant and independent predictors of poor survival 
(Figs. 2 and 3).

After resection, the tumor recurred in 24 patients (45.3%). 
The mean time to recurrence after resection was 16.7 months 
(0.7-125.9). The most common site of recurrence was the 
liver (75%) followed by the lung (25%). AJCC stage, tumor 
differentiation, microvascular invasion, perineural invasion, 
nodal positivity, positive margins after resection or adjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy did not influence the development of 
recurrence. 
Of the overall study group, 52 patients were not eligible for 
resection (49.5%). The median survival for patients not undergoing resection was 9.5 months (6.3-12.6). The survival rates 
were 45% at 1 year, 13% at 2 years and 2.6% at 3 years. The 
reasons for unresectability were the presence of metastatic 
disease (57.6%), local tumor invasion (28.8%) and presence 
of comorbidities (11.5%). Palliative chemo/radiotherapy was 
used in 28 patients (53.8%) and transarterial chemoembolization was performed in 4 patients (7.7%). A minority of patients 
received best supportive care alone (23.1%). The median 
survival of patients treated with palliative therapies was 
12.9 months (6.5-19.2), while the median survival with best 
supportive care alone was 5.0 months (0.4-9.6; P=0.007).
Discussion
The incidence of ICC is on the rise, generating clinical interest 
in improving outcomes and identifying prognostic factors. In 
this large series of ICC, we found that only 50% of the patients 
were resectable based on pre-operative imaging. Furthermore, 
approximately 60% of those operated on already had local 
invasion, microvascular invasion or lymph node involvement. 
Lymph node status was the most important component of 
staging, stressing the importance of intra-operative lymph 
node assessment. The most favorable survival was observed 
in patients operated on with single tumors without vascular 
invasion or nodal involvement who received R0 resection (with 
negative surgical margins) (38.5 months vs. 19.8 months). This 
experience confirms the importance of achieving R0 resection 
as the key treatment for optimal outcome. The present study 
also revealed that use of chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant 
setting failed to improve survival but its palliative use in 
those with unresectable ICC offered a modest survival advantage over best supportive care. While the size of the tumor 
was not a relevant prognostic factor, both stage and surgical 
treatment independently influenced survival. Furthermore, 
microvascular invasion on pathology also significantly and 
independently affected overall survival in patients who underwent resection.
Cholangiocarcinoma is well known to be a cancer more 
common in older patients (13). In our study, the mean age of 
patients at the time of ICC diagnosis was 61.8 years, but in those 
patients with underlying PSC or inflammatory bowel disease, 
ICC diagnosis occurred at an earlier age, with the mean age 
at presentation being 53.4 years. While painless jaundice is 
the most common presenting complaint in patients with hilar 
or distal cholangiocarcinoma, ICC is known to present more 
like hepatocellular carcinoma with symptoms of abdominal 
pain (13-15). Other common presenting symptoms were 
weight loss and jaundice. However, one third of the patients 
with ICC were asymptomatic and were incidentally diagnosed 
upon abdominal imaging. Traditionally, elevated CA 19-9 or 
high CEA or their combination has been used as diagnostic 
clues for ICC (14). In our study only about one third of the 
patients had an elevated CA 19-9 or CEA (36% had a CA 19-9 
>100 IU/ml and 30.5% had CEA >2.5 IU/ml) and fewer had 
an elevation in both, stressing the lack of useful biomarkers 
in this disease. The lack of specific presenting symptoms, 
absence of effective tumor markers and the non-existence of 
screening strategies together often leads to the late diagnosis 
of cholangiocarcinoma (16).
ICC developed in the background of cirrhosis in close 
to 10% of the patients, of which the majority (80%) were 
patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. Epidemiological studies 
from Eastern nations such as Japan have reported an even 
higher incidence of HCV infection up to 36% among patients 
with ICC (1,17-19). A recent large cohort study from the US 
which included 718,687 veterans also reported a significant 
association between HCV and ICC (11). HCV RNA has been 
detected in cholangiocarcinoma cells. This finding indicates 
that HCV may promote cholangiocyte proliferation and 
dysplasia of the intrahepatic bile duct epithelium that eventually leads to tumor development (20-22). We were unable to 
examine the association between HCV and ICC in our data 
due to the small number of patients with HCV and a lack of 
a control group.

In our study, 50.5% of patients underwent surgery with 
curative intent. Curative resection offers the best hope of 
cure in patients with localized disease. The 5-year survival 
rate among patients who underwent curative resection was 
19% with a median survival of 27.6 months. Previous studies 
report a variable 5-year survival ranging from 16 to 44% with 
a median survival rate ranging between 12-59 months (23-31). 
The AJCC 7th edition staging does not include the size of 
tumor as a factor for staging tumors when compared to the 
AJCC 6th edition. Keeping in line with this, we did not find 
tumor size to influence outcome. Patients who were considered to be at high risk for recurrence due to local invasion 
and/or positive surgical margins were treated with adjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy. We did not find a significant survival 
benefit for patients who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
over those who did not receive adjuvant therapy (Table III, 
P=0.174). However, the median survival was slightly longer 
in the group receiving adjuvant therapy when compared to 
the group not receiving treatment. The lack of difference in 
survival probably explains why margin positivity did not turn 
out to be a prognostic factor on multivariate analysis while 
AJCC stage and microvascular invasion were found to be 
predictors of long-term survival after curative resection. Other 
studies have reported nodal positivity to be an important 
prognostic factor (27,30,31) yet, this factor was not found to be 
independently predictive of survival on multivariate analysis. 
A possible explanation for this finding is the strong correlation 
between AJCC stage and nodal positivity, as demonstrated by 
the high Kendall's Tau-B for this relationship.
After curative resection, the tumor recurred in nearly 
half of the patients, but the recurrence did not adversely 
affect long-term survival. Most of the patients who developed recurrence were treated for disease control with 
palliative chemoembolization or systemic therapy. These 
interventions probably skewed the survival rates among 
these patients by eliminating the survival disadvantage one 
would expect with recurrence. In addition, the mean time to 
recurrence from surgery was relatively long. In this series 
established factors such as vascular/perineural invasion or 
size were not found to predict recurrence. However, most 
patients with these high-risk factors were treated with 
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy which probably decreased the 
chances of recurrence.
In our study, at the time of diagnosis a third of the 
patients had metastatic disease and about half the patients 
had unresectable tumors. Only 25% of these patients treated 
with supportive therapy alone were living at one year from 
diagnosis. A clear role for the use of palliative treatments in 
patients with ICC has not been defined. Most studies on palliative chemoradiotherapy concerned patients with hilar or distal 
cholangiocarcinoma. In this series we showed that palliative 
radiotherapy/chemotherapy were associated with a more 
favourable survival when compared with no treatment. Given 
the rarity of this cancer, prospective randomized clinical trials 
to confirm this result would be difficult to perform.
Limitations of the study include its small sample size and 
the long study period during which significant changes in 
therapy occurred. Yet, among the reported literature for this

rare cancer, our study has one of the largest cohorts. While our 
study included patients treated over the past decade it represents more recent data compared with the older US studies 
in the literature. Upon our review of the literature (Table IV), 
these earlier US studies from more than a decade ago had a 
smaller number of patients and included only patients who 
underwent resection. The present study presented outcomes 
for all stages and treatments, including the patients who 
receive palliative care.
In conclusion, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is 
associated with poor prognosis and demands improved understanding of the factors that determine development, outcomes 
and prognosis. In this large series concerning a rare malignancy, surgery offers the most advantageous curative option 
and outcome, emphasizing the importance of resectability 
as a major prognostic factor. The present study also revealed 
that use of chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting failed 
to improve survival but its palliative use in those with unresectable ICC offered a modest survival advantage over best 
supportive care. The overriding factors influencing outcome 
were stage and the presence of microvascular invasion.
