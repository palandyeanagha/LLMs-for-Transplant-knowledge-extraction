Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new type of cell death that was discovered in recent years and is usually accompanied by a large
amount of iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation during the cell death process; the occurrence of ferroptosis is
iron-dependent. Ferroptosis-inducing factors can directly or indirectly affect glutathione peroxidase through different
pathways, resulting in a decrease in antioxidant capacity and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
cells, ultimately leading to oxidative cell death. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to the
pathophysiological processes of many diseases, such as tumors, nervous system diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury,
kidney injury, and blood diseases. How to intervene in the occurrence and development of related diseases by
regulating cell ferroptosis has become a hotspot and focus of etiological research and treatment, but the functional
changes and specific molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis still need to be further explored. This paper systematically
summarizes the latest progress in ferroptosis research, with a focus on providing references for further understanding
of its pathogenesis and for proposing new targets for the treatment of related diseases.

Introduction
Whether under physiological or pathological conditions, cell death is an unavoidable and important link in
the process of life and marks the end of the life of a cell.
Traditionally, cell death has been divided into apoptosis
and necrosis. Recent studies have shown that in addition
to necrosis and apoptosis, there are also other new programmed death modes, such as autophagy, necrosis and
necrotic apoptosis, which have unique biological processes and pathophysiological characteristics. In 2012,
Dixon1 first proposed the concept of ferroptosis, an irondependent, non-apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Ferroptosis is obviously different from necrosis,
apoptosis, and autophagy in cell morphology and function
(Table 1)

cytoplasm and organelles and rupture of the cell membrane, nor does it have the characteristics of traditional
cell apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies and disintegration of the cytoskeleton. In contrast to autophagy,
ferroptosis does not have the formation of classical closed
bilayer membrane structures (autophagic vacuoles).
Morphologically, ferroptosis mainly manifests as obvious
shrinkage of mitochondria with increased membrane
density and reduction in or vanishing of mitochondrial
cristae, which is a different process from other modes of
cell death1,3,4
. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis
plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence and
development of many diseases and has become the focus
and hotspot of research on the treatment and prognosis
improvement of related diseases (Fig. 1). In view of this,
we reviewed the latest research progress on ferroptosis to
provide some references for further understanding of its
pathogenesis and for proposing new targets for the
treatment of related diseases.
An overview of ferroptosis
In 2003, Dolma5 et al. discovered a new compound,
erastin, which had a selectively lethal effect on RASexpressing cancer cells, but the manner of cell death was
different from what had been seen before. There were no
nuclear morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, and
caspase activation, and this process could not be reversed
by caspase inhibitors. Subsequently, Yang3 and Yagoda4
found that this cell death pattern could be inhibited by
iron chelating agents and found another compound,
RSL3, which could cause this pattern of cell death. In
2012, Dixon1 et al. formally named this cell death ferroptosis, according to its characteristics when studying
the mechanism by which erastin killed cancer cells with
RAS mutations. Ferroptosis is a new mode of cell death.
Morphologically, ferroptosis occurs mainly in cells as
reduced mitochondrial volume, increased bilayer membrane density and reduction or disappearance of mitochondrial cristae1,3
, but the cell membrane remains intact,
the nucleus is normal in size, and there is no concentration of chromatin; biochemically, there is intracellular
glutathione (GSH) depletion and decreased activity of
glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), lipid peroxides cannot
be metabolized by the GPX4-catalyzed reduction reaction,
and Fe2+ oxidizes lipids in a Fenton-like manner, resulting
in a large amount of ROS, which promotes ferroptosis3,6
;
and genetically, ferroptosis is a biological process regulated by multiple genes. Ferroptosis mainly involves
genetic changes in iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation metabolism, but the specific regulatory mechanism
needs to be further studied. A variety of substances that
induce ferroptosis can be divided into four categories.

ferroptosis inducer that reduces GSH levels by directly
inhibiting system Xc-. Erastin, however, also has another
target, voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs),
which induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Recently, it was
also found that activation of ferroptosis by erastin
increases the level of lysosomal-associated membrane
protein 2a, thereby promoting chaperone-mediated
autophagy, which in turn promotes the degradation of
GPX47
. The second category includes RSL3 and DPI7,
which directly inhibit GPX4 activity induce ferroptosis.
The third category includes FIN56, which has two
methods of inducing ferroptosis. First, FIN56 promotes
GPX4 degradation. Second, FIN56 binds to the enzyme
squalene synthase, which leads to the depletion of endogenous antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (COQ10). This process enhances cell sensitivity to FIN56-induced
ferroptosis8
. The final category includes FINO2, an
organic peroxide with many features in common with
artemisinin, which causes ferroptosis due to a combined
effect of the direct oxidation of labile iron and the inactivation of GPX48
. With the deepening of research on the
mechanism of ferroptosis, many specific inhibitors of
ferroptosis, such as ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), liproxstatin-1
and vitamin E, have been found, in addition to iron chelators. These substances inhibit ferroptosis by inhibiting
the formation of lipid peroxides (Table 2). In 2014, Skouta
et al. found that Fer-1 inhibited cell death in three in vitro
models of Huntington’s disease (HD), periventricular
white matter (PVL), and renal insufficiency. This provides
the basis for the use of ferrostatin in disease models, and it
is the first to address the importance of ferroptosis beyond
the cell culture level9
. In short, as a new manner of cell
death, the discovery of ferroptosis provides a new way of
thinking about and treating many diseases.
Mechanism
Inducing ferroptosis by suppressing system XcSystem Xc- is an amino acid antitransporter that is
widely distributed in phospholipid bilayers. It is part of an
important antioxidant system in cells and is a heterodimer
composed of two subunits, SLC7A11 and SLC3A2.
Cystine and glutamate are exchanged in and out of the
cell by system Xc- at a ratio of 1:11
. The cysteine that is
taken up is reduced to cysteine in cells, which is involved
in the synthesis of GSH. GSH reduces ROS and reactive
nitrogen under the action of glutathione peroxidases
(GPXs). Inhibiting the activity of system Xc- affects the
synthesis of GSH by inhibiting the absorption of cystine,
which leads to a decrease in GPX activity, a decrease in
cell antioxidant capacity, accumulation of lipid ROS, and
ultimately the occurrence of oxidative damage and ferroptosis. In addition, P53 can also inhibit system Xcuptake of cystine by downregulating the expression of
SLC7A11, thereby affecting the activity of GPX4, resulting
in a reduction in cell antioxidant capacity, accumulation
of lipid ROS, and ferroptosis10,11.
Inducing ferroptosis by suppressing GPX4
Among the many members of the GPX family, GPX4
plays a pivotal role in the occurrence of ferroptosis and is
the key regulator of its occurrence, mainly by inhibiting
the formation of lipid peroxides. GPX4 converts GSH into
oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduces the cytotoxic
lipid peroxides (L-OOH) to the corresponding alcohols
(L-OH). Inhibition of GPX4 activity can lead to the
accumulation of lipid peroxides, which is a marker of
ferroptosis. Yang et al.3 found that cells with downregulated GPX4 expression were more sensitive to ferroptosis, while the upregulation of GPX4 expression
Fig. 1 Ferroptosis has played important roles in multiple system diseases, such as nervous system diseases, heart diseases, liver diseases,
gastrointestinal diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, pancreatic diseases, and so on.

inhibits ferroptosis. RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer, directly
acts on GPX4 and inhibits its activity, thus reducing the
antioxidant capacity of cells and accumulating ROS,
leading to ferroptosis12. In addition, the compounds DPI7
and DPI10 also directly act on GPX4 and induce ferroptosis. Selenocysteine is one of the essential amino acids of
the GPX4 active group12. Selenocysteine tRNA is needed
to insert selenocysteine into GPX413. The mevalonate
(MVA) pathway can affect the synthesis of GPX4 by
regulating the maturation of selenocysteine tRNA,
thereby regulating the occurrence of ferroptosis. In MVA
pathway, IPP and COQ10 are two important products of
this pathway14. Therefore, inhibiting the MVA pathway
can downregulate the synthesis of selenocysteine tRNA,
thereby affecting GPX4 activity and inducing ferroptosis.
Ferroptosis mediated by mitochondrial VDACs
VDACs are transmembrane channels that transport
ions and metabolites and play an important regulatory
role in ferroptosis15. Yagoda et al.4 found that erastin acts
on VDACs, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and
resulting in a large amount of released oxides, eventually
leading to iron-mediated cell death.
P53-Mediated ferroptosis
The P53 gene is an important tumor suppressor gene.
P53-mediated cell cycle inhibition, aging, and apoptosis play
important roles in the occurrence and development of
tumors, but the role of P53 in ferroptosis is still unclear.
Recently, acetylation-deficient P53 mutants have been
found to promote ferroptosis. Jiang10 et al. found that the
activity of H1299 cells with silenced P53 genes remained
unchanged when treated with ROS. However, 90% of the
cells died when treated with ROS after P53 activation,
suggesting that activation of P53 reduces the antioxidant
capacity of these cells. After treatment with Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, the cell death rate decreased significantly,
and P53 also induced ferroptosis. Further studies have
found that P53 can inhibit system Xc- uptake of cystine by
downregulating the expression of SLC7A11, thereby
affecting the activity of GPX4 and resulting in the reduction
of antioxidant capacity, ROS accumulation, and ferroptosis11. In addition, the P53-SAT1-ALOX15 pathway is also
involved in the regulation of ferroptosis16. SAT1 is a transcriptional target of P53 and an important rate-limiting
enzyme for polyamine catabolism. Activation of SAT1
induces lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induced by ROS,
which is closely related to the expression level of arachidonate lipoxygenase 15 (ALOX-15). Other studies have
shown that the expression of P53 also inhibits ferroptosis in
some cells. Tarangelo A et al.17 found that stable wild-type
P53 decreased the activity of system Xc- but also reduced
the sensitivity of some cells to ferroptosis. Human HT-1080
fibroblasts are typical wild-type P53-expressing cells. When
treated with the P53 inducer nutlin3, Amy and colleagues
found that these cells were not sensitive to erastin-2-
induced ferroptosis. Further studies showed that nutlin-3
increases the P53 level in wild-type U-2OS, ACHN, Caki-1
and A549 cells, which could resist ferroptosis induced by
erastin-2. In addition, this process of reducing ferroptosis
sensitivity requires the involvement of CDKN1A (encoding
P21), a P53 transcription target that regulates GSH metabolism and intracellular GSH. These results indicate that
the P53-P21 axis can negatively regulate the occurrence of
ferroptosis in cancer cells. In addition, Xie et al.18 found that
the expression of P53 was involved in the inhibition of
ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, P53 may
regulate ferroptosis through a two-way pathway, but the
specific mechanism still needs further study.
Role of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) (previously
known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrial 2 (AIF-M2))
Two recent studies have reported the role of FSP1/AIFM2
in the occurrence of ferroptosis, revealing a new effective
way to regulate ferroptosis and reintroducing apoptosisinducing factor (AIF)19,20. AIF was proposed before the
concept of ferroptosis, and it has been involved in the study
of apoptosis. Susin et al.21 identified AIF as a mitochondrial

flavoprotein and a mitochondrial effector of apoptotic cell
death while looking for molecules that induce noncaspasedependent apoptosis. Recombinant AIF causes chromatin
condensation in isolated nuclei and large-scale fragmentation of DNA. It induces purified mitochondria to release the
apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c and caspase-9. As a
flavoprotein, AIF-M2 is thought to be a p53-responsive
gene and induces apoptosis by sequence similarity to
another initially postulated proapoptotic gene, apoptosisinducing factor mitochondria-associated 1 (AIFM-1)22. In a
recent study, Bersuker et al.19 used a synthetic lethal
CRISPR-Cas9 screen to confirmed that FSP1, formerly
known as AIFM2, was an effective ferroptosis-resistance
factor. Furthermore, Doll et al.20 also performed relevant
research on FSP1. An expression cloning method was used
to identify genes in human cancer cells that complement
the loss of GPX4. It was then found that the flavoprotein
AIFM2 was a previously unrecognized antiferroptotic gene,
namely, FSP1, which had a protective effect on GPX4
deletion-induced ferroptosis. FSP1 knockout cell lines were
significantly more sensitive to ferroptosis inducers and were
rescued by overexpression of FSP1. In addition, the overexpression of FSP1 did not induce apoptosis, and activation
of p53 did not increase FSP1 expression. Further studies
have shown that the myristoylation of FSP1 mediates the
recruitment of this protein to the plasma membrane, where
it performs its function as an oxidoreductase that reduces
COQ10 (also known as ubiquinone-10) and as a lipophilic
radical-trapping antioxidant that halts the propagation of
lipid peroxides. Doll et al.20 showed that FSP1 catalyzes the
regeneration of COQ10 by NAD(P)H, and the FSP1-
COQ10-NAD(P)H pathway is an independent parallel system that cooperates with GPX4 and glutathione to suppress
phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Moreover, this
also explains the effect of NAD(P)H in the MVA pathway
through the loss of ubiquinone convergence on FSP1 and
thereby predicts sensitivity to ferroptosis. In addition, the
expression of FSP1 was positively correlated with ferroptosis resistance in hundreds of tumor cell lines, and FSP1
mediates ferroptosis resistance in lung cancer cells in culture and in mouse tumor xenografts. In conclusion, this
study suggests that the discovery of FSP1 completes the
ferroptosis pathway. The expression of FSP1 is critical for
predicting the efficacy of ferroptosis-inducing drugs in
cancers and has also identified the potential of FSP1 inhibitors as strategies to overcome ferroptosis resistance in
many cancers.
Role of iron metabolism in ferroptosis
Iron is an important trace element in the body.
Abnormal distribution and content of iron in the body
can affect the normal physiological processes. Fe2+
formed by intestinal absorption or erythrocyte degradation can be oxidized by ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, which
binds to transferrin (TF) on the cell membrane to form
TF-Fe3+, which forms a complex through membrane
protein TF receptor 1 (TFR1) to endocytose this complex23. Fe3+ is then reduced to Fe2+ by sixtransmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3
(STEAP3), and Fe2+ is then stored in the unstable iron
pool (LIP) and ferritin, which is mediated by divalent
metal transporter 1 (DMT1) or Zinc-Iron regulatory
protein family 8/14 (ZIP8/14). Excess Fe2+ is oxidized to
Fe3+ by ferroportin (FPN)24. This recycling of internal
iron strictly controls iron homeostasis in cells. Silencing
TFRC, the gene encoding TFR 1, can inhibit erastininduced ferroptosis25, while heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
can accelerate erastin-induced ferroptosis by supplementing iron26. It was found that heat shock protein
beta-1 (HSPB1) can further reduce intracellular iron
concentrations by inhibiting TRF1 expression, and so
overexpressed HSPB1 can significantly inhibit ferroptosis27. In addition, ferritin is composed of ferritin light
chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). Inhibiting
the expression of iron response element binding protein 2
(IREB2), the main transcription factor of iron metabolism,
can significantly increase the expression of FTL and
FTH1, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis induced by erastin28.
Regulation of the lipid metabolism pathway
Iron-dependent lipid ROS accumulation is involved in
ferroptosis in all pathways. Lipid metabolism is closely
related to ferroptosis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
are sensitive to lipid peroxidation and are one of the
essential elements for ferroptosis29. Free PUFAs are the
substrate of the synthetic lipid signal transduction medium, but they must be esterified into membrane phospholipids and oxidized to transmit the ferroptosis signal.
Studies have shown that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
which contains arachidonic acid (AA) or its derivative
adrenaline, is the key phospholipid that induces ferroptosis in cells. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family
member 4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) participate in the biosynthesis
and remodeling of PE, activate PUFAs and affect the
transmembrane characteristics of PUFAs. Therefore,
reducing the expression of ACSL4 and LPCAT3 reduces
the accumulation of lipid peroxide substrates in cells, thus
inhibiting ferroptosis. Ultimately, PUFA-PE can play further oxidative roles under the catalysis of lipoxygenase
(LOX) and eventually induce ferroptosis in cells30.
Other pathways
The occurrence of ferroptosis can also be regulated by
sulfur transfer pathways and other pathways. Under oxidative stress, methionine can be converted into cystine
through the sulfur transfer pathway, and then GSH can be
synthesized to further exert its antioxidant effects31. In
Li et al. Cell Death and Disease (2020) 11:88 Page 5 of 13

addition, the p62-Keap1-NRF232, ATG5-ATG7-NCOA433,
and glutamine metabolic pathways25 can effectively regulate
the formation of intracellular iron ions and ROS and play a
regulatory role in ferroptosis (Fig. 2).
Role of ferroptosis in the occurrence and
development of related diseases
Ferroptosis and tumors
Pancreatic cancer
Eling et al.34 found that artesunate (ART) specifically
induced ROS production and activated ferroptosis in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines. In addition,
the combination of Cotylenin A (CN-A) and phenylethyl
isothiocyanate (PEITC) induces the production of ROS
and triggers ferroptosis, thus inhibiting the proliferation
of various pancreatic cancer cells (such as MIAPaCa-2
and PANC-1 cell lines). Recent studies have found that a
more effective combination of Piperlongumine (PL), CNA and sulfasalazine (a ferroptosis inducer) significantly
promotes ferroptosis in the pancreatic cancer cell lines
MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-135.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Sorafenib is widely used in the treatment of advanced
HCC, and inducing ferroptosis of HCC cells is an
important mechanism for the biological effects of
sorafenib. Loss of function of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein
is an important event in the development of liver cancer.
Louandre C et al. found that upon exposure to sorafenib,
the Rb-negative status of HCC cells promotes the
occurrence of ferroptosis36. Other studies have found that
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)–docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) nanoparticles can selectively kill human HCC cells
and inhibit the growth of rat HCC. After treatment with
LDL-DHA nanoparticles, rat and human HCC cells
underwent obvious lipid peroxidation, GSH depletion,
and GPX4 inactivation before cell death, which ultimately
proved to be ferroptosis37. In addition, Sigma 1 receptor
(S1R) is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes. Inhibition
of this receptor also promotes ferroptosis in HCC
cells38,39. Furthermore, there are many negative regulators
of ferroptosis in HCC, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-
related factor 2 (NRF2), metallothionein-1G (MT-1G),
CDGSH iron-sulfur domain 1 (CISD1) and P53. These
regulatory factors can inhibit ferroptosis in HCC cells in
different ways. The p62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway plays an
important role in preventing ferroptosis in HCC cells, and
the RAS/Raf/MEK pathway is an important target for the
treatment of HCC32,40. MT-1G promotes the development of sorafenib resistance by inhibiting ferroptosis, and
MT-1G knockdown increases GSH depletion and lipid
peroxidation41. CISD 1 is an iron-containing outer
Fig. 2 Regulatory pathways of ferroptosis. The figure shows the regulatory pathways of ferroptosis, which can be roughly divided into three
categories. The first one is regulated by GSH/GPX4 pathway, such as inhibition of system Xc-, sulfur transfer pathway, MVA pathway, glutamine
pathway, and p53 regulatory axis. Second, the regulation mechanism of iron metabolism, such as the regulation of ATG5-ATG7-NCOA4 pathway and
IREB2 related to ferritin metabolism, and the regulatory pathways of p62-Keap1-NRF2 and HSPB1 all have effects on iron. The third category is related
pathways around lipid metabolism, such as P53-SAT1-ALOX15, ACSL4, LPCAT3, etc., which have effects on lipid regulation and ferroptosis. In addition,
Erastin acts on mitochondria to induce ferroptosis. Also, recent studies have shown that the FSP1-CoQ10- NAD(P)H pathway exists as an independent
parallel system that works cooperatively with GPX4 and glutathione to inhibit phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.

mitochondrial membrane protein that has protective
effects on mitochondrial injury in the occurrence of ferroptosis in liver cancer cells42.
Gastric cancer (GC)
Hao et al.43 found that erastin can induce ferroptosis in
gastric GC cells and that cysteine dioxygenase type 1
(CDO1) plays a key regulatory role. CDO1 can absorb
cysteine competitively, thus restricting the process of
GSH synthesis and promoting ferroptosis. Inhibition of
CDO1 activity restores the level of GSH in cells, prevents
the production of ROS, reduces the level of lipid peroxidation, and ultimately inhibits the occurrence of
ferroptosis.
Colorectal cancer (CRC)
Xie et al.18 found that P53 inhibits erastin-induced
ferroptosis in CRC cells by blocking the activity of
dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4), which was different from
the previous role of P53 in promoting ferroptosis in other
cancer cells. P53 loss inhibits the nuclear accumulation of
DPP4 and thus facilitates plasma membrane-associated
DPP4-dependent lipid peroxidation, which eventually
leads to ferroptosis. In addition, cisplatin has been found
to induce ferroptosis and apoptosis in CRC cells, and GSH
deletion and GPX inactivation are important mechanisms
for this occurrence. Further studies have shown that the
combination of cisplatin and the ferroptosis inducer erastin enhances the antitumor effect of drugs, indicating
that ferroptosis has great potential in antitumor therapy,
thus opening a new manner for the in-depth application
of classical drugs44.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancerrelated death in women, while triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~15–18% of breast cancer.
TNBC currently lacks effective targeted treatment, usually
based on chemotherapy, with a poor prognosis. Cystine is
one of the most important amino acids in TNBC.
Therefore, inhibiting the activity of system Xc- reduces
cystine intake and leads to ferroptosis. However, the
application of DFO and Fer-1 prevents cell death45.
Another study found that the MUC1-C transmembrane
protein is highly expressed in TNBC, which is similar to
the xCT light chain of system Xc- and plays an important
role in maintaining GSH level and redox balance. MUC 1-
C forms a complex with xCT and the CD44 variants
(CD44v), interacting with xCT to control GSH levels.
Inhibition of activation of the MUC1-C/xCT signaling
pathway can induce ferroptosis in TNBC cells, thereby
killing tumor cells or reducing tumor cell self-renewal
ability46,47.
Lung cancer
In highly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas, the ironsulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1 is abundantly
expressed and maintains the expression level of the ironsulfur cluster. Suppression of NFS1 alone does not induce
ferroptosis, but when cells produce large amounts of ROS,
iron starvation induced by inhibition of NFS1 promotes
ferroptosis. Other studies have found that P53 is involved
in inducing ferroptosis in lung cancer A549 cells. When
erastin acts on lung cancer A549 cells, it upregulates and
activates P53, thereby transcriptionally activating its
downstream target genes (including P21 and bax), thereby
inhibiting SLC7A11 activity, inducing ROS accumulation
and eventually leading to ferroptosis48.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
ccRCC cells are highly sensitive to the depletion of
glutamine and cystine, which are required for GSH
synthesis. These cells rely heavily on the GSH/GPX
pathway to prevent lipid peroxidation and cell death. It
has been found that inhibition of GSH synthesis in ccRCC
can induce ferroptosis and inhibit the growth of tumors49.
Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs)
ACCs are highly malignant cancers, and mitotane is
routinely used in current treatment regimens. A study
found that significant increases in the expression of GPX4
and sensitivity to ferroptosis in ACCs, suggesting that
inducing ferroptosis may be a promising approach for the
treatment of ACCs. In addition, ferroptosis inducers may
be more effective and less toxic than mitotane in treating
ACC patients50.
Ovarian cancer
Exposure of ovarian cancer cells to high concentrations
of ART causes ROS-dependent DNA damage and cell
death, leading to G2/M phase arrest, a process often
associated with ferroptosis51. High-grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSOC) is the most common subtype of malignant ovarian tumors. In HGSOC cells, iron metabolism is
significantly interfered with, and therefore, iron uptake
and retention increase, TFR1 expression of iron intake
increases, iron efflux pump FPN expression is reduced
and ferritin is relatively increased. The above biological
processes can lead to excessive iron accumulation in the
cells, which provides a basis for the occurrence of
ferroptosis52.
Melanoma
In a study of melanoma, it was found that miR-137
negatively regulates ferroptosis by directly acting on the
glutamine transporter SLC1A5 in melanoma cells, while
knockdown of miR-137 promotes ferroptosis53. Other
studies have found that inhibiting mitochondrial complex
Li et al. Cell Death and Disease (2020) 11:88 Page 7 of 13
Official journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association

I triggers an increase in mitotic-dependent ROS levels,
which ultimately leads to ferroptosis in melanoma cells54.
In addition, ultrasmall (<10 nm in diameter) poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG)-coated silica nanoparticles induce ferroptosis in starving cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice55.
This provides a new direction for the treatment of melanoma and provides a cell culture system to study
ferroptosis.
Head and neck cancer (HNC)
In studies of HNC, two GPX 4 inhibitors, (1s, 3R)-RSL 3
and ML-162, were found to induce ferroptosis in HNC
cells to varying degrees. Additionally, ART can induce
ferroptosis in HNC cells, during which GSH depletion
and ROS accumulation occur. Inhibition of the NRF2-
ARE pathway abolishes the resistance to ART and GPX4
inhibitors, reversing the resistance of HNC cells to ferroptosis56,57. In addition, inhibition of the CISD2 gene in
HNC cells increases the accumulation of mitochondrial
iron and lipid ROS, thereby promoting the occurrence of
ferroptosis58.
Ferroptosis and neurological diseases
Neurodegenerative disorders
A large body of evidence indicates that many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of local iron in specific regions of the central nervous
system and/or the peripheral nervous system. This accumulation is often caused by the redistribution of cellular
iron and may lead to iron-catalyzed Fenton chemistry.
Studies have shown that iron accumulation and lipid
peroxidation are associated with the development of
various neurological diseases, accompanied by a decrease
in GSH and GPX4 levels. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the
most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized
by cognitive impairment, and iron levels in the hippocampus, which are severely impaired in AD patients, are
significantly elevated59. Abnormalities in iron homeostasis
in brain tissue can induce massive production of ROS in
brain cells, ultimately causing catastrophic oxidative
damage to sensitive subcellular structures60. In mice,
GPX4 knockdown leads to age-dependent neurodegenerative changes and neuronal loss, which can be exacerbated by dietary deficiency of vitamin E (a ferroptosis
inhibitor)61. Inhibiting ferroptosis in neurons can effectively improve the prognosis of AD. The main pathophysiological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra pars compacta, where iron is abundant62. DFO
alleviates oxidative stress injury and increases dopamine
activity, thereby improving motor neurological symptoms
and inhibiting the deterioration of motor function63. DFO
has a certain protective effect on neurons in early PD
patients. Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease, and the continued accumulation of iron and abnormalities in glutamate and GSH
levels are typical pathological features of HD9,64. The
plasma GSH content in HD patients is usually low, and
the GPX activity in erythrocytes decreases, which are
closely related to ferroptosis65. The use of Fer-1 and iron
chelators also has a good protective effect on neurons9,66.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and brainstem. A large amount of iron
accumulation in the spinal cord can be detected in the
lesion area of ALS67. Other studies have shown that the
level of lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes of ALS patients
increases and GSH level decreases, and the decrease in
GSH level, in turn, exacerbates the degeneration of ALS
motor neurons68. Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disease. The
amplification of GAA trinucleotides in the FRDA gene is
closely related to the accumulation of iron in mitochondria. The increased levels of lipid peroxide and ROS in
FRDA neurons and the decrease in GSH content increase
the sensitivity to oxidants, suggesting that FRDA may be
closely related to ferroptosis69. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is associated with oligodendrocyte damage. A
study found that Fer-1 inhibits the occurrence of ferroptosis by increasing the GSH level in oligodendrocytes,
thus providing an effective means for the treatment of
PVL9
. These findings provide promising ideas for the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
Stroke
Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 80% of
strokes. After severe ischemic and hypoxic brain injury,
iron deposition increases in the basal ganglia, thalami,
periventricular, and subcortical white matter areas70.
Studies have shown that in a mouse model of ischemic
stroke, the level of GSH in neurons is significantly
decreased, the degree of lipid peroxidation is enhanced,
and the activity of GPX is decreased71. In addition, the use
of ferroptosis inhibitors significantly improves the prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke72.
In the study of hemorrhagic stroke, N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) inhibits heme-induced ferroptosis in brain cells by
neutralizing toxic lipids produced by arachidonate–
dependent ALOX5 activity. Early application of NAC after
intracerebral hemorrhage can reduce neuronal mortality
and effectively improve the prognosis of patients73. Other
studies have found that the level of GPX4 in brain tissue
decreases significantly 24 h after cerebral hemorrhage,
while increasing the level of GPX4 significantly reduces
neuronal dysfunction, brain edema, blood-brain barrier
damage, oxidative stress and inflammatory damage after
cerebral hemorrhage, and the application of the ferroptosis
Li et al. Cell Death and Disease (2020) 11:88 Page 8 of 13
Official journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association

inhibitor Fer-1 also significantly reduces the extent of
secondary brain injury after cerebral hemorrhage74.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
The evolution of TBI is accompanied by biological processes, such as iron accumulation, disordered iron metabolism, upregulation of ferroptosis-related genes, decreased
GPX activity and ROS accumulation75. The application of
the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 significantly reduces iron
deposition, neuronal degeneration, and injury and improves
the prognosis of patients, thus providing an experimental
basis for TBI treatment targeting ferroptosis75.
Ferroptosis and acute kidney injury (AKI)
In 2014, two articles mentioned studies of kidney
damage in mice, the first involving ferroptosis in a mouse
model. In GPX4 knockout mice, the incidence and mortality in spontaneous AKI increased significantly76. In
another study, Linkermann et al.77 found that ferroptosis
was functionally relevant in vivo in acute tubular necrosis
and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and showed that a
ferroptosis inhibitor, a new third-generation ferrostatin
(termed 16–86), protected against this injury. The study
also showed that ferroptosis is independent of the
necroptosis-inhibiting complex in renal tubules, specifically Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase-8, which are important markers of spontaneous
necroptosis. This study first highlights the non-cellautonomous nature of ferroptosis. Similarly, in the
nephrotoxic folic acid-induced acute kidney injury (AKI)
mouse model, ferroptosis is the main death pathway of
renal tubular cells, and the application of Fer-1 can
effectively improve renal function78. In addition, HO-1
also plays an important role in inhibiting ferroptosis in
renal proximal tubule cells79. Therefore, the therapeutic
effect of AKI can be effectively improved by inhibiting the
occurrence of ferroptosis.
Ferroptosis and I/R injury
It has been found that ferroptosis inhibitors can effectively repair I/R-induced cell damage. Gao et al.25 found
that inhibiting ferroptosis by inhibiting glutamine metabolism could be used to treat tissue damage triggered by
I/R in the isolated hearts of wild-type mice. At the
beginning of reperfusion, the isolated hearts were treated
with DFO. Compared with heart functions in the control
group, the heart function of the DFO group was significantly enhanced. Moreover, the release of lactate
dehydrogenase was significantly inhibited by deferoxamine during perfusion. IR injury induced by heart
transplantation is a clinically significant form of sterile
inflammation. Li et al.80 explored the mechanism of
inflammatory responses after heart transplantation and
found that ferroptosis promoted the adhesion of
neutrophils to coronary endothelial cells through the
TLR4/Trif/type I IFN signaling pathway, thus inducing
neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium.
Moreover, Fer-1 effectively reduces the death of cardiomyocytes and blocks the neutrophil recruitment after
heart transplantation. This group also used a model of
coronary artery ligation-induced myocardial I/R injury, in
which inhibition of ferroptosis reduced infarct size and
improved cardiac function. Fang et al.81 demonstrated
that blocking ferroptosis reduces the severity of myocardial I/R injury in cardiomyopathy. This group also
studied mice with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy
and found that ferroptosis played an important role,
possibly because doxorubicin upregulates HO-1, releasing
free iron and leading to the generation of oxidized lipids
in the mitochondrial membrane. Other studies have
found that liproxstatin-1 can completely block lipid peroxidation and repair liver damage caused by I/R76.
Ferroptosis and other diseases
Studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to
the pathophysiological processes of more and more diseases. For example, ART treatment can significantly reduce
the degree of liver injury and inhibit the formation of
fibrotic scars in mice with liver fibrosis, in which the
morphological characteristics of ferroptosis appear in
hepatocytes82. Other studies have found that islets are
indeed susceptible to ferroptosis in vitro. The induction of
ferroptosis leads to impaired islet function, while ferroptosis
inhibitors restores islet function. This provides an experimental basis for human islet transplantation and the
treatment of type one diabetes83. In addition, ferroptosis has
been found to play a regulatory role in the progression of
the diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia84, age-related
macular degeneration (AMD)85, psoriasis86, and hemolytic
disorders87. In addition, the relationship between ferroptosis and inflammation is also a hot research topic. Necrotic
inflammation associated with ferroptosis has been observed
in the kidneys in an AKI model induced by crystal (oxalate)
and folic acid and in a GPX4 deletion mouse model88.
Studies have found that GPX4 activation inhibits the activation of the arachidonic acid (AA) and nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κ B) pathways in the lipid peroxidationmediated inflammatory response, thereby reducing ROS
levels in cells and inhibiting ferroptosis89. Therefore, GPX4
activation could be used as a new anti-inflammatory or
cytoprotective therapy (Fig. 3).
Issues and prospects
With the deepening of the research, ferroptosis has been
found in the pathophysiological processes of more and
more diseases, and it provides a new method for treating
these diseases. In addition, ferroptosis, as an independent
mode of cell death, can also play a role in diseases
Li et al. Cell Death and Disease (2020) 11:88 Page 9 of 13

together with other types of cell death, which provides the
possibility of joint application of existing treatment
schemes and helps to solve drug resistance issues in some
diseases. However, the study of ferroptosis is still in its
infancy, and many problems remain unsolved1
: P53 is an
important regulator of apoptosis, and a large number of
apoptotic factors are dependent on P53 activation to
regulate the occurrence of apoptosis. P53 also plays an
important role in the regulation of ferroptosis: P53 can
inhibit ferroptosis induced by system Xc- by downregulating the expression of SLC7A11, and it can also
inhibit ferroptosis through the P53-P21 axis under certain
circumstances. Other studies have shown that autophagy
also plays a role in the occurrence of ferroptosis10,11,17.
Activation of autophagy can cause changes in ferritin. In
the ATG5-ATG7-NCOA4 pathway, the process of
ferritin-associated autophagy that is mediated by NCOA4
can increase the content of unstable iron in cells, thus
promoting ferroptosis33. Therefore, there are some common points in the regulation of ferroptosis, apoptosis,
autophagy, and other cell death modes. What is the
relationship between these different types of cell death? Is
it synergy or antagonism? Whether these various manners
of cell death can be integrated into a complete regulatory
network still requires further exploration2
. Changes in
iron ions play an important role in the occurrence and
development of ferroptosis1
. Free intracellular Fe2 + can
produce hydroxyl radicals or peroxide radicals under the
action of the Fenton reaction, thus further oxidizing
lipids. However, other studies have found that another
important transition metal, copper, is involved in the
redox metabolism of the biological system and has similar
effects on glutamate-induced oxidation and erastinmediated ferroptosis in HT22 cells. Therefore, in addition to iron, under certain conditions, other metal ions
can also regulate the occurrence of ferroptosis90,91. This
poses a serious challenge to the original concept of ferroptosis. Is iron necessary to promote the production of
lipid peroxides, or can other substances take the place of
iron in ferroptosis? This still requires further in-depth
study3
. Upstream iron metabolism genes (such as FPN,
TFR1, and DMT1) can influence the occurrence and
development of ferroptosis25–28, but how does the
downstream pathway change? The specific molecular
mechanism is still unclear4
. Increasing evidence shows
that ferroptosis can be accompanied by inflammation, and
that cells can activate innate immune system factors
through ferroptosis stimulation and play a role in regulating inflammation damage, signal transduction, and
cell growth88,89. Some studies have found that GPX4
activation can be used as a new anti-inflammatory or
cytoprotective therapy89, but how can ferroptosis promote
the development of inflammation? When ferroptosis
occurs, how does the downregulated GSH/GPX4 regulate
the inflammatory process? These problems need to be
further explored.
At present, there are still no specific markers of ferroptosis, such as there are for apoptosis (caspase activation)
and autophagy (autophagy lysosome formation). Therefore,
the study of specific markers of ferroptosis is of great
importance. In addition to the classical pathways, are there
other ferroptosis regulatory pathways? How should basic
research results of ferroptosis be applied to clinical treatment? These are urgent problems to be solved.
Conclusion
In summary, the discovery of ferroptosis has opened
up a new platform in the field of disease research, and its
clinical significance in the occurrence, development, and
treatment of diseases has gradually emerged. At present,
research on ferroptosis is still in its infancy. It is of great
theoretical significance and practical value to explore
the mechanism of ferroptosis and its role in various
diseases and to propose effective and highly targeted
therapies. This is also the future direction of ferroptosis
research.
