Splanchnic vein thrombosis in
myeloproliferative neoplasms: treatment
algorithm 2018
Guido Finazzi1, Valerio De Stefano2,3 and Tiziano Barbui4
Abstract
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a leading cause of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). SVT is observed in all
MPNs and frequently affects young patients. Therapy should be addressed to three main goals: preventing thrombosis
recurrence, managing the underlying MPN, and supporting liver dysfunction. Life-long oral anticoagulation with
vitamin K antagonists is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic treatment. However, recurrences of SVT or other
thrombosis may occur in 15–20% of patients. Direct oral anticoagulants can represent an alternative and preliminary
data encourage comparative studies. Survival of patients with SVT in MPN is primarily influenced by the natural history
of the underlying neoplasms, rather than the SVT event. An aggressive management is recommended and a treatment
algorithm based on the different MPN subtypes is proposed. Hydroxyurea is the cytoreductive drug of choice in
polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, whereas ruxolitinib is indicated in intermediate and high-risk
patients with myelofibrosis and in PV patients resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. The management of SVT in MPNs
requires a multidisciplinary approach that may include a hematologist, a gastroenterologist, an interventional
radiologist, and a surgeon. In the case of clinical deterioration despite pharmacological therapy, patients with SVT
should be considered for invasive procedures or liver transplantation.
Introduction
Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) includes portal vein
thrombosis (PVT), mesenteric (MVT) and splenic vein
thrombosis, and the Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS)1
. BCS
is the least frequent manifestation of the SVT spectrum,
with an estimated incidence of about 0.5–1 case per
million people per year1
. The incidence of PVT and MVT
is reported to range between 0.7/100,000 and 2.7/100,000
person-years1
. SVT can be defined as “primary” or “secondary”, depending on the presence or absence of associated abdominal or systemic risk factors. Hematologic
disorders, autoimmune diseases, and the use of hormonal
therapy are the most common risk factors in BCS,
whereas liver cirrhosis, abdominal cancer, intraabdominal
inflammatory conditions, and surgery are the most common risk factors in PVT/MVT2–4
.
During the last several years, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have emerged as a leading systemic cause of
SVT5
. Results from the largest cohort studies report a
prevalence of MPNs of about 10% when all SVT patients are
included, and up to 50% in cohorts including patients with
BCS only2–4
. SVT is observed in all MPNs and affects
mainly young patients. In one of the largest studies of MPNassociated SVT, 181 cases were retrospectively recruited
from 23 European centers: polycythemia vera (PV), essential
thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
accounted for 37, 37, and 26% of cases, respectively; 65% of
the patients were women and median age at diagnosis was
48 years6
. A similar distribution of SVT in MPNs subtypes
was recently reported in a single center study of 84 consecutive cases: 35% were PV, 30% ET, and 35% PMF,
respectively;7 67% of the patients were women and median
age at diagnosis was 54 years. In a study of 538 MPN

patients younger than 40 years, SVT occurred in 26 cases
(4.8%) during a median follow-up of 7 years, representing
the most frequent incident thrombotic event8
.
SVT may represents the first clinical manifestation of
MPN, particularly when the JAK2V617F mutation is
present. The prevalence of JAK2V617F mutation in
patients with SVT ranges between 28% in non-malignant,
non-cirrhotic patients with PVT to 41% in patients with
BCS. JAK2V617F screening in patients with SVT without
overt MPN features identified MPN in about 15% of
cases9,10. These patients are included in the MPN,
unclassifiable (MPN-U) category of the current WHO
classification, among those MPN-like neoplasms that
cannot be clearly classified as one of the other subcategories of MPNs11,12.
Management of SVT in MPN is a clinical challenge
because of the frequent young age of the patients and the
severity of short-term and long-term outcomes if inadequately treated. Therapy should be addressed to three
main goals: (a) preventing recurrences of thrombosis;
(b) managing the underlying MPN; and (c) supporting
organ dysfunction, particularly of the liver (Fig. 1).
Antithrombotic treatment
Conventional anticoagulant therapy
In the acute phase, the antithrombotic treatment of
patients with SVT and MPNs does not differ from that of
patients without MPNs5
. They should be treated promptly
with full-dose low molecular or unfractionated heparin
followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA), maintaining PT
INR in the therapeutic range of 2.0–3.0. Notably, warfarin
monitoring can be difficult in patients with BCS and liver
failure, due to the reduced production of coagulation
factors, altering the baseline INR. The optimal duration of
VKA is unknown, but in general a life-long treatment is
suggested, considering the presence of a permanent risk
factors for thrombosis, such as the underlying MPN13,14.
In a multicentre prospective registry of SVT patients,
anticoagulant drugs are employed in almost the totality of
MPN patients3
, as recommended by the guidelines from
the American College of Chest Physicians15.
Safety and efficacy of long-term VKA therapy for MPN
patients with SVT have been evaluated in some studies. In
a retrospective cohort of 44 patients with PVT and MPN
(median follow-up 5.8 years), 21 (48%) received long-term
therapy: 9 with VKA, 6 with VKA plus aspirin, and 6
with aspirin. Recurrent thrombotic events occurred in
12 patients (27%), 9 in the absence of antithrombotic
prophylaxis and 3 during VKA treatment. During followup, 17 patients (39%) experienced at least one episode of
gastrointestinal bleeding16. A weak efficacy of VKA has
been reported in a series of 36 BCS patients who had
recurrent thrombosis after orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) in 42% of cases, with no difference in the mean
INR between patients who developed thrombosis and
patients who did not (2.73 vs. 2.70, p = 0.47)17. In the
aforementioned series of 181 patients with MPNs
and SVT, recurrent thrombotic events were recorded in
31 patients (17%), including SVT in 45% of the recurrent
events, during a median follow-up of 3.2 years. Reported
risk factors for SVT recurrence included history of
thrombosis, BCS, splenomegaly, and marked leukocytosis.
The rate of recurrences per 100 pt-years with or without
VKA was 3.7 (95% CI: 2.3–5.5) and 7.2 (95% CI: 3.1–14.3),
respectively, with only a trend in favor of anticoagulation
(p = 0.09)6
. More recently, the Mayo clinic experience
with 84 consecutive cases of SVT in MPN patients was
reported: 14 patients (16%) had recurrent vascular events,
including 8 (10%) with recurrent SVT. Post-SVT thrombosis-free survival and recurrence rate were not affected
by type of SVT or initial treatment strategy7
. Thus, several
studies failed to convincingly demonstrate the therapeutic
value of conventional systemic anticoagulation, showing a
non-trivial rate of event recurrence. Accordingly, it is
reasonable to consider alternative forms of anticoagulation, such as the use of low molecular weight
heparin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants.
Low molecular weight heparin
Current guidelines recommend LMWH for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism
(VTE)15,18, on the basis of their superior safety and efficacy compared to VKA, as demonstrated by the CLOT
and CATCH trials19,20. Given the neoplastic nature of
MPN, such an approach could be attractive also in these
patients. However, published evidence about efficacy and
safety of long-term administration of LMWH in MPN is
lacking, since, while the CLOT and CATCH trials did

include cases with hematologic malignancies, this comprised only ~10% of the population of patients in either
trial. In addition, at variance with most cancers, the MPN
disease activity persists for decades, so that continued lifelong treatment with daily s.c. heparin can be troublesome.
LMWH is the drug of choice for MPN patients with SVT
during pregnancy and puerperium.
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
Direct inhibitors of thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa
(rivaroxaban, apixaban) present practical advantages over
VKA, such as the administration in fixed doses without
need of systematic laboratory control and a minor interaction with food and drugs. Most importantly, clinical
trials and meta-analyses showed that DOACs are as
effective as VKA in preventing recurrent VTE and might
be associated with a lower incidence of major, particularly
cerebral, hemorrhages21. In clinical practice, the use of
DOACs is expanding also for the treatment of VTE in
cancer22,23 and in in atypical locations, such as SVT,
although the reported data are still limited.
The largest series hitherto published include 70 patients
with SVT from 17 centers. Thirty-six patients (38%) had
cirrhosis. DOACs used were rivaroxaban (83%), dabigatran (11%), and apixaban (6%). Patients were followed-up
for a median duration of 15 months (cirrhotic) and
26.5 months (non-cirrhotic). Adverse events occurred in
17% of patients and included one case of recurrent PVT
and five cases of bleeding. Treatment with DOACs was
stopped in three cases24. Another study compared three
groups of patients: (a) 63 patients with VTE in atypical
locations (AL, 26 with SVT) treated with DOACs (rivaroxaban and apixaban), (b) 23 patients with VTE in AL (22
with SVT) treated with enoxaparin, and (c) 352 patients
with VTE in typical locations treated with DOACs.
Recurrence rate for the VTE-AL group receiving DOAC
was 7.3 per 100 person-years, which was not different
when compared with those of the other groups. Major
bleeding rate in the VTE-AL group receiving DOACs was
7.2 per 100 person-years, not different compared with
those of the other groups25.
Patients with BCS and hepatic failure pose a number of
specific challenges regarding the choice of the optimal
DOAC, since dabigatran generally does not require dose
modification, but also has increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (therefore to be avoided in patients
with varices related to liver disease), apixaban is held only
for Child-Pugh class C, and rivaroxaban/edoxaban are
held for Child B and C.
These data suggest that DOACs are effective and safe in
patients with DVT in atypical locations, including SVT,
and provide a basis for performing randomized clinical
trials of DOACs vs. low molecular weight heparin or
VKA.
MPN subtype-adapted treatment algorithm
Various studies in MPN-associated SVT reported that
survival was primarily influenced by the expected natural
history of the underlying MPN, rather than the SVT event
per se. Hoekstra et al. reported that 12 of 44 patients
(27%) had progression of the underlying MPN after a
median follow-up of 5.8 years. Seventeen patients (39%)
died at a median age of 64 years. Death was directly
related to end-stage MPN in eight patients (47%) and to a
new thrombotic event in three case (18%)16. In the
aforementioned study from Mayo Clinic, 22 deaths and
3 leukemic transformations were recorded at a median
follow-up of 2.7 years7
. The cause of death was liver
failure in three individuals (all PMF), upper GI bleed in
one (PMF), leukemic transformation in one (PMF), and
thrombosis in one (ET), while it was felt to be unrelated to
SVT in 12 instances and unknown in 4. As expected, postSVT survival was significantly shorter in patients with
PMF, compared to those with PV or ET (HR 4.5, 95% CI:
1.9–10.9). Other significant risk factors for overall survival, in multivariable analysis, included older age (HR 5.0,
95% CI: 1.6–14.5) and abnormal cytogenetics (HR 3.9,
95% CI: 1.4–11.3). These observations emphasize the need
of an aggressive management of the underlying MPN in
patients with SVT.
Polycythemia vera
PV patients with SVT are classified at high risk of
thrombosis recurrence, also if they young of present with
only a moderate increase of hemoglobin or hematocrit
(“masked” PV)8
. Thus, cytoreductive drug therapy is
indicated, in addition to phlebotomy, with the goal to
maintain hematocrit below 45%26 and, possibly, platelet
count ≤400 × 109
/L and WBC count <10 × 109/L27.
According to current recommendations28, either hydroxyurea or rIFNα is the first-line cytoreductive therapy at
any age. Among the two, our preferred choice is hydroxyurea. Notably, HU may recognize additional antithrombotic mechanisms of action besides pan
myelosuppression, including qualitative changes in leukocytes, decreased expression of endothelial adhesion
molecules, and enhanced nitric oxide generation29. In one
of the few studies that addressed the issue of recurrent
thrombosis in PV and ET, cytoreduction with hydroxyurea in 77% of cases halved the risk of recurrence30.
However, in the specific setting of MPN-related SVT
cytoreductive treatment has not been proven to be
effective in reducing the rate of recurrence. In the European series of 181 SVT patients, in those receiving
cytoreduction 23 recurrent events were recorded over 537
pt-years (IR 4.2 per 100 pt-years) and in patients without
cytoreductive treatment 8 recurrent events were recorded
over 198 pt-years (IR 4.0 per 100 pt-years)6
. Similarly, no
benefit from cytoreduction in preventing recurrences was
Finazzi et al. Blood Cancer Journal (2018) 8:64 Page 3 of 6
Blood Cancer Journal

observed in the Mayo cohort7
. In another recent study of
597 MPN patients with transient ischemic attack or
ischemic stroke (IS), cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea in about 80% of cases was a strong protective
factor for recurrent IS (HR: 0.24), but not for venous
thrombosis31.
In PV patients resistant or intolerant to HU32, both
rINFα and ruxolitinib are appropriate second-line drug
therapies28,33–36.
Essential thrombocythemia
Current guidelines favor hydroxyurea as first-line therapy of ET patients in need of cytoreduction, including
those with SVT28. Anagrelide or rINFα are the recommended second-line therapy in patients resistant or
intolerant to hydroxyurea28,34,37–39. In a randomized
phase II trial of ruxolitinib vs. best available therapy
(BAT) in ET patients resistant or intolerant to HU, no
evidence of improvement in complete response and in the
rates of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation
were observed40. However, some disease-related symptoms improved in patients receiving ruxolitinib relative to
BAT, as reported also in another long-term, uncontrolled
phase II study41. Thus, at variance of PV, ruxolitinib is not
indicated in ET patients resistant or intolerant to HU,
with the possible exception of those severely symptomatic, particularly for pruritus42.
Primary myelofibrosis
Current prognostication systems in myelofibrosis are
based on the risk of mortality rather than of thrombosis43–45. Thus, the presence of SVT does not change the
risk classification of PMF patients and SVT can be
observed in all risk categories.
In asymptomatic patients with low or intermediate-1
risk disease according to IPSS/DIPPS/DIPSS plus classifications, there is no evidence to support the value of
disease-modifying therapy and observation alone is
recommended28. Some of these patients might require
palliative therapy for anemia, splenomegaly, or constitutional symptoms28. If cytoreductive treatment for the
reduction of leukocytosis or thrombocytosis is indicated,
the first-line drug of choice is hydroxyurea28. Ruxolitinib
is recommended as first-line approach in PMF patients
with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease, not candidates to
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT)28,46–49. This
drug is also indicate in PMF patients with intermediate-1
disease when splenomegaly or systemic symptoms in need
of treatment are present28,49,50.
Ruxolitinib has been specifically evaluated in 21 patients
with MPN-associated SVT in a phase 2 clinical trial51. The
majority of case were diagnosed with PMF (12), and the
others with PV (5 cases) and ET (4 cases). Eighteen
patients had spleno-portal-mesenteric thrombosis, two
had BCS, and one had both sites involved. Ruxolitinib was
well tolerated with hematological toxicities consistent
with those of patients without SVT. After 24 weeks of
treatment, spleen volume reduction >35% by MRI was
achieved by 29% of patients, MPN-related symptoms,
evaluated by dedicated questionnaires, improved significantly during treatment. Treatment with ruxolitinib
did not produce meaningful improvements in the status
of esophageal varices, but was associated with substantial
stabilization of varices grade at week 72, as observed in
85% of the patients; furthermore there was only one
bleeding episode. This compares favorably with a prospective study in non-cirrhotic, non-tumoral PVT, where
probability of worsening of existing esophageal varices at
1 year was 13%52. Overall, the trial showed that ruxolitinib
is safe in patients with MPN-associated SVT, and effective
in reducing spleen size and disease-related symptoms.
ASCT is recommended for all eligible PMF patients
with IPSS/DIPSS/DIPSS-plus high or intermediate-2 risk
and in selected cases with intermediate-1 risk28,53. A
careful evaluation of patient performance status and
additional comorbidities is critical in the assessment of
transplant candidacy. The impact of SVT has not been
specifically studied, but the presence of portal hypertension and severe splenomegaly may increase the risk of
graft failure and early post-transplant hepatotoxicity54.
However, despite these caveats, SVT does not represent
an absolute contraindication to ASCT in patients with
MPNs.
MPN, unclassifiable
The need for cytoreduction in patients with SVT carrying the JAK2V617F mutation who present with normal
blood counts and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for
MPN is uncertain5
. Approximately half of patients will
not develop an overt MPN during the follow-up9 and the
clinical course of most of these patients is indolent;55
accordingly, there is no evidence to prescribe cytoreductive regimens5
. An expert panel identified the
appropriateness of myeloproliferation-directed therapy in
patients with SVT-associated MPN as an unmet clinical
need and provided methodological suggestions to tackle
this issue56.
Liver function support
Invasive procedures
The management of SVT in MPNs requires a multidisciplinary approach that may include a hematologist
and/or a thrombosis expert, a gastroenterologist/hepatologist, and an interventional radiologist and/or a surgeon. In the case of clinical deterioration despite
anticoagulation, cytoreductive therapy and supportive
care, including sodium restriction, diuretic therapy and
paracentesis, patients with BCS should be considered for
Finazzi et al. Blood Cancer Journal (2018) 8:64 Page 4 of 6

invasive procedures, such as angioplasty with or without
stenting, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS), or surgical portosystemic shunt13.
In patients with short segment stenosis or occlusion of
the hepatic veins with significant patent segments, it is
desirable to overcome the obstruction between hepatic
vein remnants and the inferior vena cava by means of
balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. This
approach will re-establish hepatic venous outflow via the
physiological route. Use of thrombolysis may enhance the
success rate of these procedures. After failure of angioplasty or stenting, a surgical portosystemic shunt or TIPS
should be considered. The rationale for surgical portosystemic shunting is to convert the portal vein into an
outflow tract of the liver, so that patients with severe forms
of BCS might benefit from decompression of the liver13.
Liver transplantation
OLT should be considered as effective treatment for
rapidly progressive BCS after failure of conventional
treatment or portosystemic shunting, occurring in
10–20% of patients3
. In a retrospective cohort of 78 BCS
patients, there was no significant difference between the
MPN (n = 41) and the non-MPN (n = 37) groups with
regard to long-term survival. Twelve of the 41 MPN
patients (29%) died within the first 3 years after OLT, but
death was related to the hematologic disease only in one
case with recurrent BCS. Among survivors, no progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia was observed
during a mean follow-up time of 12.4 years (range 3–28.4
years)57, confirming the absence of MPN evolution
reported in a series of 17 BCS patients even at long-term
follow-up of up to 20 years after OLT58.
Conclusions
Similarly to the non-MPN patients with SVT, long-term
anticoagulation with VKA is recommended in patients
with MPN-related SVT. However, in this setting the
efficacy of treatment in preventing recurrences is not
clearly demonstrated and there is room to plan clinical
trials aimed to investigate alternative antithrombotic
strategies, such as DOACs.
Indication to cytoreductive treatment is adapted from
the guidelines concerning the different MPN subtypes,
but there is no strong evidence that is of benefit in preventing recurrent thrombosis after MPN-related SVT.
Preliminary results in preventing worsening of esophageal
varices have been reported in patients treated with ruxolitinib, but further investigations are needed in this field.
In conclusion, long-term treatment of MPN-related
SVT remains an unmet clinical need; to date, the indication to long-term anticoagulation and cytoreduction is
not specifically evidence-based, but derives from the
benefits observed either in the non-MPN patients with
SVT and in the MPN patients with thrombosis of other
sites.
