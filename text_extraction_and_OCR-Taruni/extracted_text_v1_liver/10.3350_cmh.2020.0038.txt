Phase II trial of SBRT for small HCC

Introduction
Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers at diagnosis.1,2 Moreover, the 
incidence of liver cancer worldwide is predicted to increase until 
2030, although viral hepatitis-related liver cancer rates are expected to decrease.3
 According to the current treatment guidelines for HCC, hepatic resection, liver transplantation, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are used as curative treatments for very 
early and early stage HCCs;1,4,5 however, these curative treatments 
cannot be applied in all patients with early stage HCCs considering the baseline liver function, availability of donor organs, and 
tumor location. Therefore, stereotactic body radiation therapy 
(SBRT) has been used as an alternative, non-invasive local ablative treatment in patients with very early or early stage HCCs for 
which these curative treatments cannot be applied.6-10 Owing to 
recent advances in radiotherapy techniques and radiosensitive 
characteristics of HCC, SBRT has shown excellent local tumor control rates as well as minimal treatment-related toxicity, especially 
for small (≤5 cm) HCCs that are not suitable for curative treatments.8,9,11-13 As a result of these promising outcomes, SBRT was 
regarded as an alternative treatment to thermal ablation for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A according to the 
recently updated practice guidance by the American Association 
for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD).5
Several prospective clinical trials have been conducted to assess 
the efficacy of SBRT in patients with HCC; however, the eligibility 
criteria of those studies varied, especially regarding the stage of 
HCC and tumor size.6,7,9,14,15 Considering the powerful ablative effect of SBRT in patients with HCC, a more focused prospective 
study is needed to support the clinical benefits of SBRT. Thus, we 
conducted a phase II clinical trial to assess the clinical outcomes 
of SBRT in patients with small (≤5 cm) HCCs that are not suitable 
for curative treatments.
Materials and Methods
Study outline and participants
This was a single-arm, phase II clinical trial conducted at Asan 
Background/Aims: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is used as an alternative ablative treatment in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not suitable for curative treatments. The purpose of this prospective study was to 
evaluate the long-term efficacy of SBRT for small (≤5 cm) HCCs. 
Methods: A phase II, single-arm clinical trial on SBRT for small HCCs was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. 
The planned SBRT dose was 45 Gy with a fraction size of 15-Gy over 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was 2-year 
local control rate. Radiologic responses were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST, version 1.1) and the modified RECIST criteria.
Results: Between 2013 and 2016, 50 patients (53 lesions) were enrolled, with a median follow-up period of 47.8 months 
(range, 2.9–70.6). Patients’ age ranged from 41 to 74 years, and 80% were male. Median tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, 
0.7–3.1). The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 100% and 97.1%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was 
77.6%. Six months after SBRT, radiologic responses were evident in 44 lesions (83%) according to the RECIST criteria and 
49 (92.4%) according to the modified RECIST criteria. None of the patients showed grade ≥3 adverse events.
Conclusions: SBRT showed excellent results as an ablative treatment for patients with small HCCs while showing 
minimal toxicities. SBRT can be a good alternative for both curative and salvage intents in patients with HCCs that are 
unsuitable for curative treatments. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:506-515)

Study Highlights
This phase II clinical trial on SBRT for small (≤5 cm) HCCs resulted in a 5-year local control rate of 97.1% and a 5-year overall survival rate of 77.6% while 
showing minimal treatment-related toxicity. Radiologic response was observed in about 90% of treated lesions at 6 months after SBRT completion. 
Considering that none of the tumors included in this study could be treated by surgery or percutaneous ablative therapies, SBRT can be a viable alternative for both curative and salvage intents in patients with HCCs that are unsuitable for curative treatments.

Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea, and registered at the 
Clinical Research Information Service (registration number: 
KCT0000625). Patients aged 20 years or older with a diagnosis of 
HCC were eligible. HCC was diagnosed by pathologic confirmation and/or typical findings on 4-phase dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent according to the AASLD criteria.16
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Asan Medical Center (2012-0768), and written informed 
consent was obtained from all patients prior to enrollment.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: primary or recurrent HCC 
with a Child-Pugh class A hepatic function; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1; HCCs 
with longest diameter of ≤5 cm, and ≤3 lesions with a sum of diameter ≤5 cm; not suitable for surgery because of liver cirrhosis, 
insufficient remnant liver for resection, or patient refusal to undergo surgery; not suitable for RFA due to the size (>3 cm in the 
longest diameter) or location (e.g., liver surface, near to the bile 
duct or large vessels, near the dome or pericardium) of HCC, undetectable HCC on ultrasonography, or bleeding tendency of patients; lesion non-visibility on hepatic angiogram for transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) or an incomplete response after TACE 
according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST); a sufficient distance (>2 cm) between HCC and 
radiosensitive organs such as the stomach, duodenum, esophagus, and large bowel; and evidence of an adequate residual functional liver volume (>700 mL).
Patients were excluded if they had macroscopic vascular invasions, extrahepatic metastasis, uncontrolled ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, transaminase level >200 IU/L, history of liver transplantation or radiotherapy, an active gastric or duodenal ulcer, 
other uncontrolled comorbidities, or malignant tumors.
Intervention
The simulation and target volume delineation for SBRT were 
identical to those used in our previous studies.10,17,18 All patients 
were immobilized with a vacuum cushion in the supine position. 
Four-dimensional (4D) CT scanning was performed using a 
16-slice CT system (GE LightSpeed RT 16; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The 4D-CT images, synchronized with the respiratory data, were sorted into 10 CT series according to the respiratory phase (Advantage 4D version 4.2; GE Healthcare). Patients’ 
respiratory data were analyzed using a Real-time Position Management gating system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, 
USA). Three gold seeds (CIVICO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA, 
USA) were implanted in the hepatic parenchyma around the tumor prior to CT simulation. The gold seeds were not implanted in 
patients who had surgical clips or compact iodized oil around the 
viable HCC after prior treatments, or those with uncontrollable 
bleeding tendencies.19
The gross tumor volume (GTV), as determined by dynamic enhanced CT or MRI, included an enhanced HCC at the end-expiratory phase of the 4D-CT image. The clinical target volume was 
equal to the GTV. The internal target volume (ITV) was determined as the sum of the individual GTVs as defined within the 
gated phases of respiration. The planning target volume (PTV) 
was added with a 0.5-cm margin from the ITV.10
SBRT planning was performed using a 3-dimensional radiotherapy planning system (Eclipse; Varian Medical Systems) that used 
the two arcs of volumetric-modulated arc therapy technique using 
a 10-MV flattening filter-free beam using a linear accelerator 
(TrueBeam STx; Varian Medical Systems).18 A total dose of 45 Gy 
was prescribed using 15 Gy per fraction over 3 consecutive days. 
The total dose was determined based on our prescription guidelines including the following: 1) the maximum dose allowed to 
700 mL of normal liver was estimated to be 15 Gy in three fractions and 2) the mean dose to normal liver did not exceed 13 Gy 
in three fractions. The dose constraints to adjacent critical normal 
organs were as follows: 1) 2 mL of the esophagus or large bowel 
were limited to a total dose of <21 Gy; 2) 2 mL of the stomach or 
duodenum were limited to <18 Gy; and 3) 2 mL of the spinal cord 
were limited to 18 Gy.10 The beam delivery was performed with an 
image-guidance and a respiratory-gated beam delivery technique 
using an On-Board Imager (Varian Medical Systems).
Outcomes and evaluation
The primary endpoint of this study was 2-year local control rate. 
Local control was defined as no evidence of tumor progression of 
the treated lesion. Local tumor progression was defined as recurrence within the PTV, intrahepatic recurrence was defined as recurrence within the liver outside the PTV, and extrahepatic metastasis was defined as recurrent disease at any site other than the 
liver. Secondary endpoints were radiologic response rates, recurrence-free survival, and overall patient survival.
Tumor measurements and response evaluation were conducted 
by a radiologist (SYK) with more than 10 years of experience in 
HCC imaging. Radiologic response was defined as the combined 
number of complete response and partial response and evaluated

by liver dynamic CT at 2-, 4-, and 6-months after SBRT completion according to both the RECIST version 1.1 and the modified 
RECIST criteria.20,21 After 6 months, regular follow-up examinations were performed at 3-month intervals. After completion of 
the 2-year study period, patients continued to receive treatment 
and were followed-up for disease status and survival until March 
31, 2019. Laboratory tests were performed at every visit, including blood counts, chemical profiles, prothrombin time, alpha-fetoprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonistsII levels. Adverse events were graded using the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE; version 4.03). Radiation-induced liver disease was also 
graded according to CTCAE or any decline in liver function using 
the worsening of Child-Pugh score ≥2 in the absence of progressive disease within 3 months after SBRT.
Statistical analysis
The primary data set for efficacy analyses comprised all enrolled 
patients (intention-to-treat analysis). For sample size calculation, 
we assumed that the 2-year local control rate would be >90%, in 
contrast to <75% reported in previous studies on SBRT.15,22 Considering a 10% of drop-out rate, according to the Simpson’s 
phase 2 single-stage design, a total of 50 patients was required 
in this study for a two-sided test with 5% significance level and

Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were estimated from 
the SBRT start date to the date of death, the last follow-up examination, or to the date of tumor recurrence. The probability of cumulative survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate 
the association of covariates with overall and recurrence-free survivals. Cox proportional hazards model with backward elimination 
was used to identify risk factors in the multivariate model. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 
21; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Study population
Between April 4, 2013 and August 19, 2016, 50 patients were 
included in the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig. 1). Given that each 
of three patients had two viable HCCs that were simultaneously 
treated with SBRT, a total of 53 lesions were included in this 
study. Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The study 
population was mostly males (80%), with a median age of 64 
years (range, 41–74). Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was 
the main cause of background liver disease. Median tumor size 
was 1.3 cm (range, 0.7–3.1) using either the RECIST or the modified RECIST measurements, and one patient had HCC with a segmental bile duct invasion prior to SBRT. The locations of the HCC 
lesions were as follows: subcapsular area (26, 49.1%), perivascular area (15, 28.3%), near the dome (10, 18.8%), and previous 
RFA margin (2, 3.8%). All patients received a planned dose of 45 
Gy in three fractions (prescription, 91–100% of isodose line) for 
target lesions. Only two patients (4%) were treatment-naïve, and 
all other patients had received various courses of locoregional 
therapies before receiving SBRT (median, 3 courses). However, 
additional locoregional treatments were not performed on recurrent or residual viable HCCs if SBRT was considered according to 
the study protocol.

Local control rates and radiologic response
At the completion of the 2-year study period, 44 patients (47 
lesions) completed the follow-up evaluations according to the 
study protocol (Fig. 1). During the follow-up period, local recurrence was observed in one (1.8%) out of the 53 lesions, resulting 
in 2- and 5-year local control rates of 100% and 97.1%, respectively (Fig. 2A; estimated local recurrence-free survival in Supplementary Fig. 1).
At 2 months after completion of SBRT, all lesions underwent response evaluation; radiologic responses were observed in 19 
(35.8%) and 24 (45.3%) lesions according to the RECIST and the 
modified RECIST criteria, respectively. At 4 months, 37 (69.8%) 
and 43 (81.1%) lesions showed responses according to the RECIST 
and the modified RECIST criteria, respectively. At the final response evaluation of 6 months after completion of SBRT, 44 
(83.0%) and 49 (92.4%) lesions had achieved radiologic responses according to the RECIST and the modified RECIST criteria, respectively (Table 2). A representative case is shown in Supplementary Figure 2.
Overall and recurrence-free survival rates 
The median follow-up period of participants was 47.8 months 
(range, 2.9–70.6). By the last follow-up, 40 patients were alive. 
The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.0% and 77.6%, 
respectively (Fig. 2B). Thirty-six patients were diagnosed as having tumor recurrences on follow-up imaging studies (CT, 26 patients; both CT and MRI, 10 patients). Among them, intrahepatic 
(i.e., outside the PTV) HCC recurrence was the main cause of failure (33 of 50 patients), and distant metastasis also developed in 
eight patients during follow-up. The rates of 5-year intrahepatic 
recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and recurrence-free survival were 32.0%, 83.9%, and 26.8%, respectively (Fig. 2C-E). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size 
was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.504; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.031–6.084; P=0.043) 
and recurrence-free survival rates (HR, 2.791; 95% CI, 1.604–
4.858; P<0.001) (Supplementary Tables 1, 2).
Treatment-related toxicity 
SBRT-related toxicities are summarized in Table 3. All patients 
received the planned SBRT without any interruptions due to intolerable side effects. Fatigue and anorexia were the most common 
acute toxicities, which were mostly mild (NCI-CTCAE grade 1) 
(Table 3).
Two patients (4%) experienced elevations in the Child-Pugh 
score to ≥2. Of these, one patient had a Child-Pugh score 8 hepatic function and also showed peritoneal seeding nodules at 
2 months after completion of SBRT; this patient died due to hepatic failure at 2.9 months after SBRT. Serious adverse events 
were reported in seven patients, including compression fracture in 
lumbar spine, variceal bleeding, cholangitis, fungal sinusitis, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and gallbladder stone (all n=1), all of 
which were regarded as unrelated to SBRT.
There were no gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding 
or perforation during follow-up. Five patients (10%) developed rib 
fractures, which did not require any specific treatment and improved spontaneously. Four patients (8%) developed grade 1 or 2 
biliary strictures, and six patients (12%) experienced grade 1 radiation pneumonitis in the right lower lung fields (Table 3).

Discussion
In this phase II clinical trial of patients with small (≤5 cm) HCCs, 
SBRT was associated with high rates of local tumor control (100% 
at 2 years and 97.1% at 5 years), radiologic response (92.4% at 6 
months by the modified RECIST criteria), and overall survival 
(77.6% at 5 years) while showing minimal treatment-related toxicity. One patient experienced hepatic failure 2 months after SBRT, 
the cause of which was unclear. These results show clinical benefits of using SBRT as an ablative treatment for small HCCs that are 
not amenable to hepatic resection, RFA, or even TACE.
Multiple prospective and retrospective studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of SBRT for HCC, with many showing promising outcomes. However, the indications for SBRT varied, 
with some trials including patients with portal vein tumor thrombus6,7,15 and others including patients with extrahepatic metastasis.15 Moreover, a wide range of tumor sizes, from 1.0 cm to 23.1 
cm, was included.6,7,9,14,15 Thus, it was difficult to draw a consistent 
conclusion on the use of SBRT for HCC. As SBRT can be used for 
various clinical purposes from curative to palliative aims at the 
physician’s discretion, the results of curative intent SBRT on patients with early stage HCCs should be analyzed if the ablative effect of SBRT is the primary endpoint. Therefore, we designed the 
current trial by including patients with liver-confined, small (≤5 
cm) HCCs without macroscopic vascular invasion. Similarly, Takeda 
et al.9
 conducted a phase II study on SBRT for early stage or small 
(≤4 cm) HCCs and reported favorable outcomes in terms of 3-year 
local control (96.3%) and 3-year liver-related cause-specific survival (72.5%). Other retrospective studies using ≤5–6 cm of maximum HCC tumor diameter as inclusion criteria also showed high 
local control rates.8,10-13,18
In this study, 2- and 5-year local control rates were as high as 
100% and 97.1%, respectively. Such high local control rates could 
be explained as follows. First, participants of this study had relatively smaller HCCs (range, 0.7–3.1 cm) than those of previous 
studies. With the exception of two patients, 48 (51 lesions) were 
enrolled with recurrent HCC after prior locoregional treatments. 
Hence, we decided to perform salvage therapies when typical recurrence was observed on regular follow-up images even if the lesion was small. As tumor size is one of the most important factors 
for local tumor control after SBRT,8,10,23-25 this may have led to the 
high local control rate in this study. Second, the established SBRT 
procedures and techniques at our institution, including 4D-CT, tumor localization on planning CT, respiratory-gated delivery, and a 
thorough image-guidance on each fraction, may have contributed 
to the improved clinical outcomes. We recently evaluated the targeting accuracy of our image-guided SBRT for HCC using post-radiotherapy MRI with hepatocyte-specific contrast agent and 
found that the set-up errors were less than 5 mm in cranio-caudal, right-left, and anterior-posterior directions with or without 
internal fiducial markers.19 This high local tumor control could not 
be observed in early phase follow-up images. The timing of treatment response was evaluated by an experienced abdominal radiologist at regular intervals (2-, 4-, 6-month after SBRT) according

Phase II trial of SBRT for small HCC
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0038
to the study protocol. Response rates were less than 50% at 
2 months; however, at 6 months after completion of SBRT, they 
were around 90% according to both the RECIST and modified RECIST criteria. This delayed response trend after SBRT is a potentially valuable finding that may aid decision-making processes for 
the management of HCC.
Although most of the enrolled patients had recurrent HCCs with 
a history of locoregional treatments, the overall survival rate in 
this study was as high as 77.6% at 5 years. The most likely reason 
for this promising result was that all patients had preserved liver 
functions according to the eligibility criteria. The main failure pattern was intrahepatic recurrence, with a cumulative intrahepatic 
recurrence of about 70%, which is similar to that of previous reports. Given that multicentric carcinogenesis in the context of 
chronic liver disease is considered as an important cause of intrahepatic recurrence, similar outcomes were observed after SBRT for 
solitary HCC or after RFA.9,26,27 Therefore, a regular follow-up and 
an active decision of salvage therapies are necessary to control 
recurrent HCCs after SBRT.
Based on the encouraging outcomes of SBRT for HCC, some 
studies have compared the outcomes of locoregional therapies 
(e.g., hepatectomy, RFA, and TACE) with those of SBRT.28-31 Of 
these, Hara et al. compared these two modalities in patients with 
small (≤3 cm) HCCs who received curative intent treatment and 
reported that the 3-year local recurrence rates in the SBRT and 
the RFA groups were 5.3% and 12.9% (P<0.01), respectively; 
these differences were more notable if the HCCs were attached to 
vessels (≤1 mm) (5.2% in the SBRT group, 25.5% in the RFA 
group; P<0.01).28 After propensity score matching, overall survival 
rates, cancer-specific mortality rates, and liver failure mortality 
rates were not significantly different between the two groups; 
and the authors concluded that SBRT was an acceptable alternative option for patients who were not candidates for RFA.28 Although these studies had retrospective designs, their results warrant the need for well-designed clinical trials to delineate the 
clinical benefits of using SBRT as an ablative treatment for patients with HCC, especially for those with early stage diseases.
This study has the following limitations. First, the number of enrolled patients was relatively small, and the number of events (local recurrence: 1, death: 10) that occurred during follow-up was 
not enough to perform statistical analysis. Therefore, it was difficult to find novel results on the use of SBRT for HCC, compared 
with the previous reports. Second, HBV infection was the main 
cause (82%) of background liver disease; thus, the results of this 
study should be further confirmed in patients with HCCs unassociated with HBV. Finally, most of the enrolled patients had recurrent HCCs with a history of prior locoregional treatments; thus, 
further studies on SBRT in treatment-naïve patients with small 
HCCs are needed to confirm the role of SBRT as a curative treatment option. Nevertheless, focusing on the ablative effect of SBRT 
in patients with liver-confined, small (≤5 cm) HCCs, presenting 
the trends of radiologic response rates after SBRT measured at 
regular intervals, and long-term follow-up data could be considered valuable to report our prospective trial.
In conclusion, this phase II clinical trial demonstrated that SBRT 
was well-tolerated and resulted in high local control rates and 
promising overall survival rates in patients with small (≤5 cm) 
HCCs. Considering that tumors included in this study could not be 
treated by curative treatment modalities, SBRT can be considered 
a good alternative treatment option when hepatic resection or 
RFA cannot be applied.
