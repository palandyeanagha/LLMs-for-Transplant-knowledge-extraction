Abstract
The intrahepatic immune environment is normally biased towards tolerance. Nonetheless, effective antiviral immune
responses can be induced against hepatotropic pathogens. To examine the immunological basis of this paradox we studied
the ability of hepatocellularly expressed hepatitis B virus (HBV) to activate immunologically naı¨ve HBV-specific CD8+ T cell
receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells after adoptive transfer to HBV transgenic mice. Intrahepatic priming triggered vigorous in
situ T cell proliferation but failed to induce interferon gamma production or cytolytic effector function. In contrast, the same
T cells differentiated into cytolytic effector T cells in HBV transgenic mice if Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) expression was
genetically ablated, suggesting that intrahepatic antigen presentation per se triggers negative regulatory signals that
prevent the functional differentiation of naı¨ve CD8+ T cells. Surprisingly, coadministration of an agonistic anti-CD40
antibody (aCD40) inhibited PD-1 induction and restored T cell effector function, thereby inhibiting viral gene expression and
causing a necroinflammatory liver disease. Importantly, the depletion of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) strongly diminished
the aCD40 mediated functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that activation of mDCs was
responsible for the functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in aCD40 treated animals. These results
demonstrate that antigen-specific, PD-1-mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion can be rescued by CD40-mediated mDCactivation.

Introduction
Rapid clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells in response to antigenic
challenge is a hallmark of adaptive immunity and a crucial
element of host defense. Activation and differentiation of T cells
are largely determined by their initial encounter with antigenpresenting cells (APCs), and the resultant responses range from full
activation and memory T cell differentiation to clonal exhaustion
or deletion, depending on the nature and abundance of inductive
signals that T cells decode from APCs during priming [1,2]. These
events generally occur in secondary lymphoid organs because
naı¨ve T cells are usually not primed in nonlymphoid tissues [2].
The liver is, however, an exception to this rule, due to the unique
architecture of the hepatic sinusoid which is characterized by a
discontinuous endothelium, the absence of a basement membrane,
and a very slow flow rate [3–5], allowing circulating T cells to
make prolonged direct contact with resident liver cells including
hepatocytes [6]. Furthermore, the liver is replete with diverse and
unique antigen presenting cell populations, including liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [7,8], hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs) [9], Kupffer cells [10,11], conventional and plasmacytoid
dendritic cells [12–14], all of which are capable of priming and/or
tolerizing naı¨ve T cells, at least in vitro. Thus, because of its unique
immunological environment, antigens expressed and/or processed
in the liver appear to be more accessible to T cells than those in
other nonlymphoid organs [4,15].
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic, enveloped,
double-stranded DNA virus that causes acute and chronic
hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma [16,17]. Similar to other
noncytopathic viruses, the clearance of HBV requires functional
virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses [18]. Using the HBV
transgenic mouse [19] as a model to study the impact of
intrahepatic antigen recognition by HBV-specific CD8+ T cells,
we have shown that adoptively transferred HBV-specific memory
CD8+ T cells rapidly secrete IFNc upon antigen recognition in the
liver, thereby inhibiting HBV replication [20]. Subsequently, PD-1
is upregulated in the intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and they stop
producing IFNc, start expressing granzyme B (GrB) and undergo
massive expansion [21] thereby mediating a necroinflammatory
liver disease and terminating viral gene expression whereupon the
intrahepatic CD8+ T cell population contracts, liver disease abates
and IFNc production returns [21].
While the foregoing studies illustrate the profound impact of
intrahepatic antigen recognition on the distribution, expansion
and effector functions of memory CD8+ T cells, they do not
address the response of immunologically naı¨ve CD8+ T cells to
antigen recognition in the liver. Indeed, the literature reveals
significant differences between naı¨ve and memory CD8+ T cells in
terms of the peptide:MHC complex concentration and costimulation required for activation and the development of their
proliferative and cytokine secretion potentials, cytolytic activity
and their migratory range [2,22]. While T cell priming to viruses

that do not infect conventional pAPCs is believed to occur in
lymphoid organs via cross-priming [1,2,23,24], the consequences
of naı¨ve T cell priming by hepatocellularly expressed viral antigen
are less well understood.
In the current study, we used transgenic mice whose CD8+ T
cells express T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for the HBV
nucleocapsid (COR) and envelope (ENV) proteins to study the
early intrahepatic immunological events that are likely to occur
during HBV infection. By analyzing the response of naı¨ve CORand ENV-specific TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells to hepatocellularly presented HBV antigens in vivo after adoptive transfer into
HBV transgenic mice whose hepatocytes produce all the HBV
gene products and secrete infectious HBV virions [19], and in
vitro after cocultivation with primary HBV transgenic mouse
hepatocytes, we show that HBV-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells are
primed in the liver by HBV+ hepatocytes and proliferate
vigorously in situ, but do not differentiate into functional effector
T cells unless PD-1 signaling is genetically ablated. Importantly,
when the same T cells are transferred into HBV transgenic mice
whose myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) were simultaneously
activated by agonistic antibodies against CD40 (aCD40), PD-1
induction is suppressed and the T cells differentiate normally,
inhibit HBV antigen expression, and cause liver disease. Collectively, these results indicate that CD40-mediated activation of
mDCs can rescue the effector functions of PD-1-inhibited naı¨ve
CD8+ T cells, apparently by suppressing the negative regulatory
signals that are triggered by antigen recognition in the liver. These
results imply that the balance achieved between these two
opposing forces may regulate the pathogenesis and outcome of
HBV and other hepatotropic virus infections.
Results
Generation of HBV COR93-specific and ENV28-specific
TCR transgenic mice
A Kb-restricted CD8+ CTL clone (BC10) that recognizes an
epitope located between residues 93–100 in the HBV core protein
(MGLKFRQL) (COR93) was generated from a Balb/c (H-2d
) by
C57BL/6 (H-2b
) F1 hybrid (CB6F1) mouse that was immunized
by standard DNA-prime/vaccinia boost immunization as previously described [21,25]. Importantly, when in vitro core peptideactivated BC10 T cells (16107
/mouse) were adoptively transferred
into HBV transgenic mice (lineage 1.3.32) that express all of the
HBV antigens and replicate HBV in the liver and kidney [19],
they inhibited HBV replication, and caused liver disease on day 1
after adoptive transfer (data not shown) as previously described
after adoptive transfer of polyclonal COR93-specific effector
memory CD8+ cells [21]. TCRa (Va13.1JaNEW06) and b
(Vb8.1Jb1.2) cDNA clones derived from BC10 were inserted into
TCR expression cassettes [26], and injected into fertilized
CByB6F2 eggs to generate BC10 TCR transgenic mice. Two
founders, BC10.1 and BC10.3 carrying both TCRa and b
transgenes were derived, and lineage BC10.3 was chosen for
further backcrossing based on its superior allelic exclusion rate
(data not shown). The BC10.3 TCR transgenic (TCRtg) mice
were backcrossed more than 10 times onto C57BL/6 (B6)
background, and then mated once with CD45.1 mice (H-2b
) so
that the TCR transgenic T cells could be easily followed by antiCD45.1 antibody staining. As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, .98%
of the splenic CD8+ T cells (33.5% of total spleen cells) in these
mice were COR93-specific and CD45.1 positive as determined by
staining with COR93-multimers and CD45.1 staining. As
expected, they were phenotypically characterized as CD442,
CD62Lhigh, CD252, CD692, (Figures 1C and 1D) and fewer than
2% of them produced IFNc or expressed Granzyme B (GrB) after
5 hours peptide stimulation in vitro (Figure 1E), indicating that
they were in fact naı¨ve T cells.
We also generated a lineage of transgenic mice whose CD8+ T
cells express TCRs specific for the well-described Ld
-restricted
ENV28 epitope [27,28]. The TCRs of these mice consist of
Va4.1JaNEW and Vb1.1Jb2.5 chains cloned from CD8+ ENV28-
specific CTL clone 6C2, whose functional properties have been
extensively characterized [20,27–29]. Lineage 6C2.36 was chosen
for further characterization and backcrossed onto the Balb/c
background for at least 6 generations and then mated once with
CD45.1 mice (H-2b
). As shown in Figure 1F, approximately 83%
of splenic CD8+ T cells (20% of total spleen cells) in lineage
6C2.36 are ENV28-specific and all of them were CD45.1 positive
(Figure 1G). Again, virtually all the ENV28-specific CD8+ T cells
were CD442, CD62Lhigh, CD252, CD692, (Figures 1H and 1I),
and they did not express IFNc or GrB after peptide stimulation
(Figure 1J), indicating that they are naı¨ve T cells.
Naı¨ve HBV-specific CD8+ T cells expand vigorously in the
liver but do not differentiate into effector T cells
To examine the response of HBV-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells to
hepatocellularly expressed HBV, we adoptively transferred 3–
56106 COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells from the spleen of
BC10.3 TCR transgenic donor mice into HBV transgenic lineage
1.3.32 recipient mice [19,20]. Groups of 3–4 mice were sacrificed
at various time points after adoptive transfer, and their intrahepatic, lymph nodal, and splenic lymphocytes were analyzed for the
total number of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells and the extent to
which they coexpress Granzyme B (GrB) and IFNc either directly
ex vivo or after in vitro stimulation by cognate COR93 peptide.
To determine the functional capabilities of the adoptively
transferred COR93-specific CD8+ TCR transgenic T cells during
a systemic infection in vivo, we also studied their response to
cognate HBcAg antigen produced by MHC-matched nontransgenic mice that had been infected 2 hours before adoptive transfer
with 26107 pfu of a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the
HBV nucleocapsid protein (cVac) [30].
As shown in Figure 2, COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were
detectable in the liver of HBV transgenic mice as early as 1 hour
after adoptive transfer, and they rapidly accumulated in the liver,
Author Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is responsible for more
than 500,000 deaths annually as a result of the immunemediated chronic liver damage it induces. The HBV specific
CD8+ T cell response contributes to the pathogenesis of
liver disease and viral clearance, and the failure to induce
and/or sustain a vigorous CD8+ T cell response results in
viral persistence and causes chronic necroinflammatory
liver disease. To understand how the HBV-specific CD8+ T
cell response is generated in response to intrahepatically
expressed HBV, we generated T cell receptor transgenic
mice whose CD8+ T cells are specific for HBV core or HBV
envelope antigens. We find that these T cells are primed in
the liver when they are adoptively transferred into HBV
transgenic mouse recipients whose livers produce infectious virus particles, and that they proliferate vigorously in
situ but do not differentiate into functional effector T cells
after antigen recognition. Functional differentiation is
suppressed by dominant negative regulatory signals,
including PD-1, unless they are suppressed by anti-CD40
activation of myeloid dendritic cells.

constituting more than 17% of total intrahepatic lymphocytes on
days 1.5 and 3 (Figure 2A white bars) and showing greater than a
20-fold increase in their absolute numbers between the 1 hour and
3 day time points (Figure 2B white bars). After rapid expansion,
the number of intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells
remained relatively stable up to day 10, after which they decreased
more than 10-fold by day 14 (Figure 2B) but still constituted a
large fraction of total intrahepatic CD8+ T cells on day 28
(Figure 2A). In contrast, the COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in the
lymph nodes and spleen expanded much less vigorously between
the 1 hour and 3 day time points than their counterparts in the
liver, although the absolute number of COR93-specific CD8+ T
cells was greater in the spleen than the liver at 1 hour and 4 hour
time points (Figure 2B). COR93 specific CD8+ T cells started
disappearing from the lymph nodes and spleen on day 14, and
became almost undetectable on day 28 (Figures 2A and 2B; gray
and black bars). In contrast, in cVac infected nontransgenic
C57BL/6 mice, the frequency of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells
was similar in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen (Figure 2F), and
fewer COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were detectable in the liver
than the spleen (Figure 2G) at all time points tested. These results
suggest that the COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were primed and
accumulated preferentially in the antigen expressing liver of HBV
transgenic mice rather than peripherally as in the cVac infected
nontransgenic mice.
Strikingly, despite vigorous expansion (Figures 2A and 2B), the
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in the liver, lymph nodes and spleen
of the HBV transgenic mice did not produce IFNc either directly
ex vivo (data not shown) or after 5 hours peptide stimulation
(Figure 2C) at any time point examined, and their ability to
express GrB was severely compromised as well (Figure 2D). In
contrast, the intrahepatic, lymph nodal and splenic COR93-
specific CD8+ T cells in the cVac infected nontransgenic recipients
were able to produce IFNc in response to 5 hours COR93-peptide
stimulation, and expressed GrB directly ex vivo (Figures 2H and
2I). These data suggest that adoptively transferred HBV-specific
naı¨ve T cells preferentially expand in the HBV transgenic liver,
but the expanding T cells are functionally impaired. Interestingly,
virtually all the intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in HBV
transgenic mice strongly expressed the co-inhibitory molecule PD1 on day 1.5 ex vivo and remained so until day 28 (Figure 2E),
while PD-1 expression was virtually absent in their counterparts in
cVac infected nontransgenic animals (Figure 2J), suggesting that
PD-1 signaling may have contributed to the functional impairment
of intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cell responses in HBV
transgenic mice.
To determine if the dysfunctional T cell responses in the HBV
transgenic liver reflect active suppression of functional differentiation by PD-1 signaling, the COR93-specific TCR transgene was
crossed for two generations onto a MHC class I matched PD-1
deficient background (kindly provided by Dr. Arlene Sharpe,
Harvard Medical School) [31], yielding PD-1 deficient COR93-
specific TCR transgenic animals. Equal numbers of PD-1 deficient
and wild type COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells were adoptively
transferred into HBV-transgenic mice, and analyzed for expansion, IFNc producing ability and Granzyme B (GrB) expression on
day 7 after adoptive transfer. The results were correlated with the
degree of liver damage and HBV gene expression monitored by
Figure 1. Expression and phenotype of HBV-specific CD8+ T
cells in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice. Spleen cells were
isolated from TCR transgenic mouse lineages BC10.3 and 6C2.36 and
the frequencies of Kb
-restricted COR93-specific and Ld-restricted ENV28-
specific CD8+ T cells were analyzed using peptide-pulsed Kb
-, and Ld-
dimers respectively (Figure 1A and Figure 1F). Splenic COR93- and
ENV28-specific CD8+ T cells from respective TCR transgenic mice were
gated by CD8+ and COR93-dimer and ENV28-dimer staining as shown in
Figure 1A and 1F, and analyzed for the expression of CD45.1, CD62L,
CD44, CD69, and CD25 (Figures 1B–1D and 1G–1I). Spleen cells from
BC10.3 and 6C2.36 TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with COR93
and ENV28 peptide for 5 hours in vitro and CD8+ T cells were analyzed
for the expression of IFNc and Granzyme B (GrB) by intracellular
cytokine staining (1E and 1J).

Northern Blot (NB) analysis, respectively. As shown in Figure 3A,
PD-1 deficient COR93-specific CD8+ T cells expanded much
more vigorously in the liver than wild type COR93-specific CD8+
T cells, and a larger fraction of PD-1 deficient T cells expressed
IFNc and Granzyme B (Figure 3B and C) and they induced a
more severe liver disease, monitored as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity (Figure 3D). Furthermore, HBV gene
expression was significantly reduced in the recipients of PD-1
deficient COR93-specific CD8+ T cells but not in the wild type T
cell recipients (Figure 3E), reflecting the superior cytolytic and
interferon gamma-producing activity of the PD-1 deficient cells.
Collectively, these results indicate that PD-1 signaling suppresses
the expansion and functional differentiation of HBV-specific
CD8+ T cells after antigen recognition in the liver.
Intrahepatic priming of HBV-Specific naı¨ve T cells after
adoptive transfer into HBV transgenic mice
Because the hepatocytes in HBV transgenic mice replicate HBV
at high level and release viral particles and subviral antigens into
the circulation [19], HBV derived antigen could be presented to
naı¨ve T cells either by the hepatocytes themselves or by
professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs) that acquire virus
particles and/or subviral antigens in the liver or in peripheral
lymphoid organs. Therefore, the expansion of dysfunctional HBVspecific CD8+ T cells in the liver could reflect T cell priming and
expansion in the liver, or the intrahepatic accumulation of T cells
that were previously primed in the lymph nodes. To distinguish
between these alternatives, we monitored the expression of
activation markers (CD69 and CD25) on HBV-specific CD8+ T
cells in the liver, lymph nodes and spleen at very early time points
(1 hour, 4 hours and day 1) after adoptive transfer into HBV
transgenic mice, and the results were compared with the
expression of these activation markers on the HBV-specific
CD8+ T cells in the cVac infected nontransgenic animals.
As shown in Figure 4A (white bars), within 1 hour after adoptive
transfer, approximately 85.0% of the intrahepatic COR93-specific
CD8+ T cells in the HBV transgenic mice expressed the very early
activation marker CD69, suggesting that nearly all the COR93-
specific T cells that entered the liver rapidly recognized antigen.
By 4 hours, virtually all the intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T
cells in the transgenic mice were CD69 positive, and a large
fraction of them also began to express CD25 (Figure 4B, white
bars), the IL-2a receptor that is required for high affinity binding
of IL-2 [32], suggesting that they were fully activated and prepared
to proliferate. In contrast, CD69 expression by COR93-specific
CD8+ T cells in the lymph nodes (gray bar) and spleen (black bars)
occurred later (Figure 4A) than their intrahepatic counterparts
(Figure 4A), and fewer nodal and splenic COR93-specific CD8+ T
cells expressed CD25 (Figure 4B, gray and black bars), suggesting
that naı¨ve HBV-specific CD8+ T cell activation primarily occurred
in the HBV-expressing liver and that these intrahepatically primed
T cells subsequently trafficked to the lymph nodes and spleen. In
contrast, COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in cVac infected nontransgenic recipients rapidly upregulated CD69 in the spleen and
the liver as early as 1 hour after adoptive transfer (Figure 4C).
Interestingly, CD25 expression in cVac infected nontransgenic
mice was mainly observed on the splenic COR93-specific CD8+ T
cells (Figure 4D), suggesting that the activation of COR93-specific
CD8+ T cells during systemic vaccinia infection is largely splenic.
None of these changes occurred in uninfected control nontransgenic recipients (data not shown), indicating that they were antigen
specific events. Collectively, these results suggest that hepatocellularly expressed HBV antigen primes naı¨ve T cells in the liver.
Next, groups of 4 HBV-transgenic mice received intraperitoneal
injections of either saline or anti-CD62L antibodies (aCD62L),
that are known to block naı¨ve T cell homing to the lymph nodes
[33–35], followed by naı¨ve COR93-specific CD8+ T cells 16 hours
later. The mice were sacrificed 1 hour after adoptive transfer and
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from the liver, lymph
nodes, and spleen and analyzed for CD69 expression. As shown in
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells (i.e. CD8+CD45.1+ cells), while Figure (B) and (G) show the absolute number of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells. Figures (C) and
(H) show the fraction of in vitro IFNc -producing COR93-specific CD8+ T cells, and Figures (D) and (I) show the fraction of ex vivo Granzyme B
expressing CD8+ T cells. Figures (E) and (J) show the fraction of PD-1 positive CD8+ T cells. The data represent mean 6 SD of three mice.

Figure 5A, aCD62L administration completely abrogated the
homing of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells to lymph nodes, but had
no impact on the intrahepatic accumulation of the T cells. Despite
the absence of T cell homing to the lymph nodes, COR93-specific
CD8+ T cells in the aCD62L treated HBV-transgenic mice were
fully activated in the liver, similar to those in saline treated
recipients (Figure 5B). These results confirm that intrahepatic T
cell activation and expansion do not reflect redistribution of T cells
that were activated in the lymph nodes.
Intrahepatic priming of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells is
primarily mediated by hepatocytes
Intrahepatic priming of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells could reflect
recognition of either endogenously synthesized hepatocellular
antigen or of antigen that is released by the hepatocytes and
internalized, processed and presented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), Kupffer cells, or dendritic cells that are capable of
cross-presentation [8,10,12,36]. In an attempt to identify the
antigen presenting cell population responsible for priming
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in the liver of HBV transgenic
mice, we adoptively transferred COR93-specific naı¨ve T cells into
MHC-matched HBV transgenic mice lineages 1.3.32 and MUPcore 50 (MC50) that produce a nonsecretable form of HBcAg, and
compared T cell accumulation and activation 1 hour later.
Lineage 1.3.32 replicates HBV and expresses HBcAg (which is
nonsecretable) in their hepatocytes and it also secretes viral
particles and HBeAg, a soluble viral protein that is highly crossreactive with HBcAg [16,19]. In contrast, lineage MC50 express
only HBcAg whose expression is restricted to hepatocytes [37],
reducing the likelihood of antigen presentation by professional
antigen presenting cells that acquire secreted viral particles or
subviral antigens. As shown in Figure 6, COR93-specific CD8+ T
cells accumulated similarly in liver, lymph nodes and spleen in
both HBV-transgenic mouse lineages (Figure 6A), and the fraction
of CD69 positive COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in the liver and
lymph nodes were comparable in these lineages (Figure 6B). Since
HBV core expression in MC50 transgenic mice is restricted to
hepatocytes, these results suggest that naı¨ve COR93-specific CD8+
T cells were primed by recognition of endogenously synthesized
hepatocellular HBcAg. To test this notion, COR93-specific naı¨ve
T cells were co-cultured overnight with hepatocytes, LSECs,
Kupffer cells, and dendritic cells that were isolated from the liver
of HBV transgenic mice lineage 1.3.32 and nontransgenic
controls, and then examined for CD69 expression. As shown in
Figure 7, approximately 25% of COR93-specific naı¨ve T cells
upregulated CD69 when they were cocultured with hepatocytes
isolated from HBV transgenic mice (Figure 7A and 7E), whereas
fewer than 5% (2.561.8%) did so when cocultured with transgenic
LSEC, (Figure 7B and 7E) and virtually no T cells expressed

hepatocytes nor LSECs isolated from nontransgenic mice stimulated COR93-specific CD8+ T cells to express CD69 unless they
were first pulsed with COR93-peptide (Figures 7E and 7J, white
bars) indicating the antigen specificity of the T cell response to the
HBV transgenic hepatocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that
intrahepatic priming of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells was
primarily mediated by endogenously synthesized antigen produced
by the HBV-transgenic hepatocytes.
Intrahepatic priming of functionally defective T cell
responses is independent of T cell antigen specificity
To determine if intrahepatic priming of functionally defective
CD8+ T cells is a general rule or restricted to COR93-specific
TCR transgenic T cells, we adoptively transferred naive ENV28-
specific T cells from CD45.1-6C2.36 TCRtg mice into MHCmatched HBV transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates.
Groups of 3 mice were sacrificed 4 hours, 3 days and 7 days after
adoptive transfer to examine the ENV28-specific CD8+ T cell
response in the liver (Figure 8; white bars), lymph nodes (Figure 8;
gray bars) and spleen (Figure 8, black bars). ENV28-specific naı¨ve
CD8+ T cells were rapidly activated in the liver of the HBV
transgenic mouse recipients (but not in nontransgenic recipients –
not shown) as early as 4 hours after adoptive transfer (Figure 8A),
suggesting that, like COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells,
adoptively transferred ENV28-specific CD8+ naı¨ve T cells are
primed in the liver. The intrahepatically primed ENV28-specific
CD8+ T cells expanded in the liver (Figure 8B), but did not express
IFNc or GrB (Figure 8C and 8D). These results recapitulate the
immunological events observed after adoptive transfer of COR93-
specific naı¨ve T cells into HBV transgenic mice illustrated in
Figures 2 and 4, indicating that intrahepatic T cell priming and
the expansion of functionally defective T cells occur irrespective of
the antigen specificity or MHC restriction of the T cells. Thus, T
cell hyporesponsiveness represents a general outcome induced by
intrahepatic T cell priming to endogenously synthesized hepatocellular antigen.
CD40-Activation of myeloid dendritic cells induces
functional differentiation of intrahepatically primed HBVspecific CD8+ T cells
Ample evidence suggests that the induction of functional CD8+
T cell responses requires the activation of professional antigen
presenting cells (pAPCs), which in turn provide secondary signals
to naı¨ve T cells [1,2,38]. Since the results shown in Figure 7
indicate that HBV-specific naı¨ve T cells were primed by
hepatocytes that are not known to express co-stimulatory
molecules [39], it is possible that the dysfunctional HBV-specific
T cell responses in the HBV transgenic liver reflected the absence
of a second signal.
To determine if the differentiation defect of intrahepatically
primed HBV-specific CD8+ T cells can be rescued by products of
the immune response to an exogenous pathogen, COR93-specific
naı¨ve T cells were adoptively transferred into HBV transgenic
mice that were either treated with saline (NaCl) or infected with
26107 of cVac 2 hours before transfer, and the results were
compared with their differentiation after transfer into nontransgenic recipients that had been infected with 26107 of cVac
2 hours before transfer. Three and seven days later, mice were
sacrificed, and intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were
analyzed for expansion, IFNc producing ability and Granzyme B
(GrB) expression. The results were correlated with the degree of
liver damage and HBV gene expression monitored by serum
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and Northern Blot (NB)
analysis, respectively. To monitor the impact of cVac infection per
se on liver disease and HBV gene expression, HBV transgenic
mice were infected with 26107 of cVac without receiving COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells, and they were sacrificed 3 and 7
days later. As expected, COR93-specific naı¨ve T cells expanded
vigorously in the HBV transgenic mouse liver but did not express
IFNc or Granzyme B (Figures 9A–9C; white bars). In contrast,
cVac infection of HBV transgenic mice triggered IFNc (Figure 9B;
black bar) and Granzyme B (Figure 9C; black bar) expression by a
small but significant fraction of the transferred intrahepatic
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells without significantly increasing
their expansion in the liver (Figure 9A; black bars). Note, however,
that the frequency of IFNc+ and Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells was
lower in cVac infected HBV transgenic mice (Figures 9B and 9C,
black bars) than in cVac infected nontransgenic recipients
(Figures 9B and 9C, blue bars), suggesting that their effector
functions were suppressed by continuous hepatocellular antigen
Figure 6. Intrahepatic accumulation and activation of COR93-
specific CD8+ T cells in HBV transgenic mice. 26107 of spleen cells
were isolated from BC10 TCR transgenic mice, and adoptively
transferred into groups of 3–4 lineage 1.3.32 HBV transgenic mice
and MUP-core 50 (MC50) transgenic mice. Lineage 1.3.32 replicates HBV
and expresses HBcAg in their hepatocytes and secretes virus particles
and HBeAg, a secreted viral protein that is highly cross-reactive with
HBcAg. Lineage MC50 expresses only HBcAg under the mouse major
urinary protein (MUP) promoter, and its expression is restricted to the
hepatocytes. 1 hour after adoptive transfer of naı¨ve COR93-specific
CD8+ BC10 T cells, the mice were sacrificed and organs were harvested
to analyze the frequency (A) and CD69 expression (B) of the transferred
T cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen. The data represent mean 6
SD of three mice.

recognition, similar to the response we have shown to occur when
HBV-specific memory CD8+ T cells recognize antigen in the HBV
transgenic mouse liver [21].
The COR93-specific CD8+ T cells induced only a modest
elevation of serum ALT activity in saline injected HBV transgenic
mice (Figure 9D), and they had little or no effect on HBV gene
expression (Figure 9E) in the liver. In contrast, the CD8+ T cellmediated liver disease was more severe (Figure 9D) and
intrahepatic HBV gene expression was strongly suppressed in
cVac infected HBV transgenic mice compared to saline treated
HBV transgenic controls (Figure 9E). As expected, cVac infection
per se did not induce liver disease (Figure 9D,; red bar), nor did it
suppress HBV gene expression (Figure 9E), suggesting that the
induction of liver disease and the suppression of HBV gene
expression in cVac infected HBV transgenic mice after COR93-
specific CD8+ T cell adoptive transfer were mediated by the T

purified from HBV transgenic mice lineage 1.3.32 and nontransgenic

cells. These results suggest that functional differentiation of HBVspecific CD8+ T cells in the HBV transgenic mouse liver is
sufficiently restored in the context of a systemic virus infection to
both cause hepatitis and inhibit viral gene expression.
Activation of professional antigen presenting (pAPC) cells is
believed to be essential for the induction of functional CD8+ T cell
responses after virus infections, and several studies have demonstrated that ligation of CD40 induces pAPC activation, resulting in
the induction of CD8+ T cell responses [40–42]. To examine
whether CD40 activation could induce functional differentiation
of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in this model, we adoptively
transferred naı¨ve COR93-specfic CD8+ T cells into HBV
transgenic mice and nontransgenic controls that had been injected
intravenously either with 100 mg/mouse of an agonistic anti-CD40
antibody (aCD40) [43,44] or with saline (NaCl) 16 hours before
transfer. Seven days later, the mice were sacrificed, and
intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were analyzed for
expansion, IFNc producing ability and Granzyme B (GrB)
expression. The results were correlated with the degree of liver
damage and HBV gene expression monitored by serum ALT
activity and Northern Blot analysis, respectively. As shown in
Figure 10A, by day 7, aCD40 treatment increased the intrahepatic
expansion of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in HBV transgenic
mice by 5 fold compared to the saline treated transgenic animals.
Furthermore, by day 7, approximately 40% of intrahepatic
COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in the aCD40 treated animals
produced IFNc in response to 5 hours in vitro peptide stimulation
(Figure 10B), and almost all the COR93-specific CD8+ T cells
expressed GrB directly ex vivo (Figure 10C), contrasting strikingly
to their counterparts in the saline treated animals. Interestingly the
induction of T cell effector functions coincided with PD-1
downregulation in intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells
(Figure 10D), suggesting that activation of CD40 signaling
counteracted the PD-1 mediated negative signaling. In contrast
to these observations, neither the expansion nor the functional
differentiation of the COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were enhanced
in aCD40 treated nontransgenic recipients (not shown). Importantly, aCD40 treated HBV transgenic recipients displayed higher
serum ALT activity (Figure 10E) and very strong suppression of
intrahepatic HBV gene expression (Figure 10F), after adoptive
transfer of naı¨ve COR93-specific CD8+ T cells compared to saline
treated animals. The induction of severe liver disease and the

the HBV core antigen (cVac), and one hour later, received 3–56106 of COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells. Groups of 3–4 nontransgenic mice were also
infected with 26107 pfu of cVac and then received 3–56106 of COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8 T cells. In addition, groups of 3–4 HBV transgenic mice were
infected with the same titer of cVac without receiving COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells. On days 3 and 7, transferred COR93-specific CD8+ T cells
were analyzed for expansion (A), IFNc production (B) and Granzyme B expression (C) in the liver of HBV transgenic mice treated with saline (white

transgenic mice were correlated with the degree of liver disease monitored by serum ALT activity (D) and HBV gene expression in the liver monitored

suppression of HBV gene expression by aCD40 treatment reflect
the vigorous expansion and functional differentiation of adoptively
transferred COR93-specific CD8+ T cells, since these changes
were not observed in aCD40 treated transgenic recipients that did
not receive naı¨ve COR93-specific CD8+ T cells (Figure 10E; gray
bars, and Figure 10F). These results suggest that CD40 activation
during intrahepatic T cell priming converts T cell hyporesponsiveness into immunity.
We then attempted to determine the role of professional antigen
presenting cells (pAPCs) in aCD40 induced functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. To do so, HBV-transgenic
mice were crossed with CD11c.DOG mice that express the human
diphtheria toxin (DTX) receptor on CD11c+ cells and thus allow
depletion of dendritic cells after DTX administration with no signs
of toxicity [45]. Groups of three CD11c.DOG-HBV transgenic
mice were treated with DTX or saline (NaCl) every other day in
combination with single administration of clodronate liposome
(CLL) that is known to induce apoptosis of macrophages and DCs
in vivo and in vitro [46,47], or control liposomes (NaCl-L),
yielding 4 different groups of mice (i.e. NaCl+NaCl-L,
DTX+NaCl-L, CLL+NaCl, and DTX+CLL.) On day 2 after
CLL or NaCl-L treatment, we analyzed the numbers of myeloid
dendritic cells (mDCs; F480+
CD11c+), lymphoid dendritic cells
(lymDCs: F4802CD11c+
), Kupffer cells (F480+CD11c2) and B
cells (B220+
) in the liver to determine the efficacy of pAPCs
depletion. As shown in Figures 11A and 11B, DTX and CLL
independently depleted mDCs in the liver and their effects were
additive. (Figure 11A), while intrahepatic lymDCs were depleted
only by DTX treatment (Figure 11B). Surprisingly, the number of
Kupffer cells paradoxically increased when mice were treated with
DTX or CLL alone and with both together (Figure 11C). This
might reflect that dendritic cell death stimulated proliferation and/
or migration of Kupffer cells. None of these treatments significantly reduced the number of intrahepatic B cells (Figure 11D). To
examine the impact of pAPC-depletion on aCD40 induced
functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells,
CD11c.DOG-HBV transgenic mice that were pre-treated with
DTX, CLL or DTX plus CLL, were injected with aCD40, and 1
day later, adoptively transferred with COR93-specific naı¨ve T
cells. The mice were sacrificed on day 7 after adoptive transfer,
and the intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells were analyzed
for expansion, IFNc producing ability and Granzyme B (GrB)
expression. The T cell responses were correlated with the degree
of liver damage monitored by serum ALT activity. As shown in
Figures 11E to 11G, expansion, IFNc producing ability, and GrB
expression of COR93-specific CD8+ T cells in aCD40 treated
CD11c.DOG transgenic mice were directly correlated with the
number of intrahepatic mDCs at the time of aCD40 administration, but not those of intrahepatic lymDCs, Kupffer cells, or B
cells, suggesting that mDCs are required for aCD40 induced
functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Taken
together, these results suggest that activation of mDCs through the
CD40 pathway can overcome PD-1-mediated suppression and
induce functional CD8+ T cell responses in response to
intrahepatically expressed HBV.
Discussion
The current study examines the impact of hepatocellular
antigen presentation on the expansion and functional differentiation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Our results revealed that
intrahepatic antigen presentation primes functionally defective
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, that the dysfunctional
CD8+ T cell response reflects active suppression of expansion and

functional differentiation by PD-1 signaling, and that such
suppression can be overridden by activating myeloid dendritic
cells (mDCs) through CD40 stimulation.
COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells were rapidly activated in
the liver after adoptive transfer into HBV transgenic mice as
indicated by more rapid expression of activation markers CD69
and CD25 by intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells than
their lymph nodal and splenic counterparts (Figures 4A and 4B).
Hepatocellular activation of the COR93-specific CD8+ T cells was
not due to hepatic migration of cells that had been activated in
lymphoid organs, because the naı¨ve T cells were equally activated
when T cell homing to lymph nodes was prevented by antiCD62L antibody (aCD62L) treatment (Figure 5) and when
HBcAg secretion was precluded (Figure 6). Rather, it reflected T
cell priming in the liver by recognition of endogenously
synthesized hepatocellular antigen (Figure 7). As a consequence
of hepatocellular antigen presentation, the COR93-specific CD8+
T cells upregulated CD69 and CD25 expression (Figure 4A and B)
and expanded vigorously (Figures 2A and 2B) but they were
functionally impaired as they did not express IFNc or Granzyme B

(DTX)+NaCl-L, NaCl+clodronate liposome (CLL) and DTX+CLL, and then sacrificed for the analysis of intrahepatic professional antigen presenting cell
(pAPC) population. DTX or saline (NaCl) was administered 1 and 3 days before sacrifice, while CLL or NaCl-L was administered 2 days before sacrifice.
The number of myeloid dendritic cells (F480+
CD11c+), lymphoid dendritic cells (F4802CD11c+), Kupffer cells (F480+CD11c2), and B cells (B220+) were
measured by FACS analysis. The percent of control group (NaCl+NaCl-L) in each group (n = 3) was expressed as a bar, and the absolute number of
each cell population in the control group (n = 3) was also depicted. (E)–(H); Groups of 3–4 CD11c-DOG HBV transgenic mice were treated with DTX,
CLL or DTX+CLL, and then received agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (aCD40). CD11c-DOG HBV-transgenic mice that were treated with NaCl, NaCl-L or
NaCl+NaCl-L served as controls for DTX, CLL, or DTX+CLL treated mice, respectively. DTX or NaCl was administered every other day beginning from 3
days before aCD40 administration. CLL or NaCl-L was administered once 2 days before aCD40 administration. On day 1 after aCD40 administration,
2–36106 of purified COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into each group. The mice were sacrificed on day 7 after adoptive
transfer of COR93-specific naı¨ve CD8+ T cells, and the absolute numbers of intrahepatic COR93-specific CD8+ T cells, IFNc-producing CD8+ T cells, and
Granzyme B positive CD8+ T cells, and ALT activity in DTX, CLL, and DTX+CLL treated mice (n = 3–4 for each group) were divided by the
corresponding numbers in their respective control group (n = 3–4). Numbers above each bar represent the control values for each condition.

(GrB) either directly ex vivo or after 5 hours in vitro peptide
stimulation (Figures 2C and 2D). Importantly, hepatocellular T
cell priming and the expansion of functionally defective T cells also
occurred when ENV28-specific naı¨ve T cells were transferred into
HBV-transgenic mice (Figure 8), indicating that hepatocellular T
cell priming induces functionally defective T cells responses
irrespective of antigen specificity and MHC restriction and
illustrating the generality of these observations. The dysfunctional
HBV-specific T cell responses likely reflected the suppression of
functional differentiation by PD-1 signaling (Figure 3), but such
suppression could be overcome by vaccinia virus infection
(Figure 9) or simultaneous activation of mDCs via the CD40
signaling pathway (Figures 10 and 11).
While various hepatic cell populations have been shown to
contribute to T cell priming in the liver [8,10,12,36,39], our data
suggest that HBV antigen-positive hepatocytes are responsible for
priming of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in our system. The
fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium permits circulating T cells
to make direct contact with underlying hepatocytes [6]. Indeed,
when hepatitis B envelope (ENV) specific effector CD8+ T cells
were adoptively transferred into hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic
mice that express the ENV protein in their hepatocytes, renal
tubular epithelium, and choroid plexus cells [48], the ENVspecific effector CD8+ T cells were selectively sequestered and
specifically activated in the liver where they caused a necroinflammatory disease [4,29] but not in the other tissues. Importantly,
whereas they failed to recognize antigen in the kidney or the CNS
when injected intravenously, the CTLs were highly cytopathic for
ENV-positive renal tubules and choroid plexus epithelial cells
when they were injected directly into those tissues [4]. Furthermore, a series of studies by Bertolino and colleagues suggest that
hepatocytes can prime alloantigen specific naı¨ve T cells [15,35,39],
suggesting that antigen expressed by hepatocytes is highly
accessible to circulating native T cells. In those studies, however,
the intrahepatic priming of alloantigen specific T cells by
hepatocytes was shown to induce rapid T cell deletion
[15,35,39], contrasting strikingly to the vigorous expansion of
HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses described in this study. The
basis for the difference is unclear, but it could reflect the different
TCR affinity of transgenic T cells and the level of cognate antigen
expression in the liver. Nonetheless, in Bertolino’s hands and ours,
intrahepatic antigen recognition fails to trigger CD8+ T cell
functional differentiation.
Strikingly, the intrahepatically activated HBV-specific CD8+ T
cells in the HBV transgenic mice did not secrete IFNc or display
cytotoxic activity (Figures 2C and 2D). Consequently, they did not
inhibit HBV replication (data not shown) or gene expression
(Figure 3E) or cause a necroinflammatory liver disease (Figure 3D).
The lack of effector functions was not due to intrinsic defects of
HBV-specific TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells or the large number
of adoptively transferred T cells, since the same transgenic CD8+
T cells differentiated into fully functional effector T cells in
nontransgenic recipients that were infected with recombinant
vaccinia viruses expressing the HBV core antigen (Figures 2F–2I).
Instead, our data suggest that the dysfunctional intrahepatic CD8+
T cell response reflects the impact of antigen-induced, PD-1-
mediated negative signaling. The intrahepatic HBV-specific CD8+
T cells upregulated PD-1 (Figure 2E) in HBV transgenic mice but
not in nontransgenic mice infected with cVac (Figure 2J).
Furthermore, PD-1 deficient COR93-specific naı¨ve T cells
expanded more vigorously than their PD-1 positive wild-type
counterparts, and they differentiated into cytotoxic effector T cells
in situ, caused severe liver damage, and inhibited HBV gene
expression in the liver (Figure 3). These results suggest that HBVspecific CD8+ T cells can be primed in the liver by recognition of
antigen expressed by hepatocytes but activation of their effector
functions is suppressed by PD-1 signaling, consistent with the
previous studies reported by us [21,49] and others [50,51].
Whether other negative signaling molecules such as CTLA-4 [52],
Tim3 [53–55], 2B4 [56,57], IL-10 [58,59] and TGFb [60,61] that
are known to suppress antiviral CD8+ T cell responses also
contributed to the suppression of functional differentiation after
intrahepatic priming remains to be determined. In chronic HBV
patients, the inhibitory molecule 2B4 and Tim-3 are highly coexpressed with PD-1 on HBV-specific CD8+ T cells [62,63].
Similarly, CTLA-4 is highly expressed on HBV-specific CD8+ T
cells that express high levels of pro-apoptotic molecule Bim [64].
Furthermore, in vitro blockade of CTLA-4 or Tim-3 signaling
appears to restore effector functions of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells
after in vitro peptide stimulation, and this effect was even
enhanced when combined with PD-1 blockade, suggesting that
HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in chronically infected
patients are suppressed by several non-redundant mechanisms
[62,64]. Importantly, our data suggest that such suppressive
mechanism(s) can be overcome by myeloid dendritic cell (mDC)
activation. HBV-specific CD8+ T cells differentiated into fully
functional effector T cells in recipient HBV transgenic mice that
were treated with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies (aCD40),
resulting in liver disease and the inhibition of HBV gene
expression (Figure 10). Importantly, mDCs are required for
aCD40 induced functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+
T cells (Figure 11). Collectively, these results suggest that
activation of mDCs via CD40 signaling was essential to rescue
HBV-specific CD8+ T cells from functional suppression through
PD-1 and perhaps other regulatory molecules.
Several studies with aCD40 established a model postulating that
the aCD40 activates pAPCs that then provide secondary signals to
naı¨ve CD8+ T cells upon antigen presentation [38,40,42].
According to this model, HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were
programmed to differentiate into functional effector T cells during
cross-priming by aCD40-activated pAPCs that acquired circulating HBV particles, subviral antigens or HBV expressing hepatocytes or hepatocyte fragments. However, our preliminary data
suggest that hepatic DCs isolated from aCD40 treated HBVtransgenic mice cannot stimulate COR93-specific native T cells to
express CD69 (data not shown), suggesting inefficient crosspriming by aCD40-activated pAPCs. Therefore, it is possible that
aCD40-activated pAPCs released cytokines such as IL-12 and
type I interferons that provide a third signal required for T cell
functional differentiation [1,65,66]. In line with this notion, Maini
and colleagues have recently showed that IL-12 potently augments
the capacity of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells to produce IFNc upon
in vitro stimulation by cognate antigen in association with downmodulation of PD-1 [67]. Additional studies are required to test
these hypotheses.
It remains to be determined if similar events occur during
natural HBV infection. Ample evidence suggests that HBVspecific CD8+ T cell responses are functionally impaired during
chronic HBV infections [51,68,69] and the functional impairment
is associated with PD-1 expression [68,70] by HBV-specific CD8+
T cells, similar to the transgenic T cells described in this study.
Therefore, the expansion of functionally defective CD8+ T cells by
hepatocellular priming may explain the weak CD8+ T cell
responses observed during chronic HBV infections. In contrast,
approximately 95% of adult onset acute HBV infection is
characterized by a vigorous HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response.
While our data indicate that activation of mDCs through the
CD40 pathway can induce functional HBV-specific CD8+ T cell
Rescuing CD8+ T Cells from Exhaustion

responses, it is currently unknown whether, and if so, how the
mDCs are activated during natural HBV infection. While CD40
ligand (CD40L) is expressed on a variety of cells including
platelets, mast cells, basophils, NK cells, and B cells, antigenspecific CD4+ T cells are primarily responsible for activating
CD40 expressing cells, particularly professional antigen presenting
cells (pAPCs), and CD4 T cell mediated CD40 activation appears
essential for cross-priming functional CD8+ T cell responses [40–
42]. Indeed, early priming of HBV-specific CD4+ T cells before or
during viral spread in HBV-infected chimpanzees appears to be
necessary to initiate a functionally efficient CD8+ T cell response,
and the depletion of CD4+ T cells before HBV infection precluded
functional T cell priming and caused persistent infection in
experimentally infected chimpanzees [70]. Experiments are
currently underway to determine whether fully functional CD8+
T cell responses can be induced in this transgenic mouse model by
providing HBV-specific T cell help.
In summary, the data described herein demonstrate that
endogenously synthesized hepatocellular antigen primes functionally defective HBV-specific CD8+ T cells via an instructional
process involving PD-1 signaling that actively suppresses expansion and functional differentiation of hepatocellularly primed T
cells. Importantly, such suppressive mechanisms can be overcome
by activating mDCs through the CD40 pathway. Collectively,
these results suggest that HBV specific CD8+ T cell responses are
regulated by the balance between PD-1 mediated inhibitory
signaling and stimulatory signals by activated DCs. More
experiments are required to determine whether DC activation
and/or PD-1 blockade may, individually or together, have
therapeutic potential to terminate chronic viral infections of the
liver and possibly other persistent viral infections as well.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All experiments involving mice were performed in the
AAALAC accredited vivarium (Vertebrate Animal Assurance
No. A3194-01) at The Scripps Research Institute. All animal
studies follow the guidelines in the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and are approved by The Scripps
Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #
08-0159).
Mice
HBV transgenic mouse lineage 1.3.32 (inbred C57BL/6, H-2b)
and lineage MC50 have been previously described [19,37].
Lineage 1.3.32 expresses all of the HBV antigens and replicates
HBV in the liver and kidney at high levels without any evidence of
cytopathology. Lineage MUP-core 50 (MC50) (inbred C57BL/6,
H-2b
) expresses the HBV core protein in hepatocyte under the
transcriptional control of the mouse major urinary protein (MUP)
promoter. In all experiments, the mice were matched for age (8
weeks), sex (male), and (for the 1.3.32 animals) serum HBeAg
levels in their serum before experimental manipulations. PD-1
deficient mice and CD11c.DOG mice (both inbred C57BL/6, H2b
), kindly provided by Drs. Arlene Sharpe and Gu¨nter
Ha¨mmerling, respectively, have been previously described
[31,45]. All experiments were approved by The Scripps Research
Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.
Peptide and recombinant vaccinia virus
Synthetic peptides corresponding to the previously described
[27,28,71] HBV envelope (ENV)-specific CTL epitope, ENV28
(Ld
; IPQSLDSWWTSL) and HBV nucleocapsid protein (COR)-
specific CTL epitope, COR93 (Kb
; MGLKFRQL) were purchased from Mimotope (Victoria, Australia). Recombinant vaccinia viruses that express the nucleocapsid protein (core) (subtype
ayw) of HBV (designated cVac) and the major envelope protein (S)
(subtype adw2) (HBs4) were kindly provided by H.J. Schlicht [30]
and B. Moss [72], respectively.
Generation of COR93-specific CD8+ T cell clone
A CD8+ CTL clone termed BC10, that is Kb-restricted and
specific for an epitope located between residues 93–100 in the
HBV core protein (MGLKFRQL) (COR93), was generated in
Balb/c (H-2d
) by C57BL/6 (H-2b) F1 hybrids (CB6F1) that were
immunized by standard DNA-prime/vaccinia boost immunization
to induce an HBcAg specific CD8+ T cells response as previously
described [21,25]. Fourteen days after the booster immunization,
mice were sacrificed and spleen cells were collected. 46106 spleen
cells were cocultured with 16105 of irradiated RBL5 cell
transfectants that express the HBV core protein (RBL5/c) in
complete RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Frederick, Md.) containing streptomycin (100 mg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml), 2-mercaptoethanol (561025 M), 10% fetal calf serum, and 2.5% EL-4
supernatant in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). The
RBL5/c cell line was a gift from Dr. Jorg Reiman [71]. Seven days
later, the spleen cells were restimulated with RBL5/c, and on day
14, they were cloned in 96-well round bottom plates (Costar) at 1
cell/well. After 2 to 3 weeks of repetitive stimulation, wells
containing growing cells were expanded and four H-2b restricted
CTL clones were established. A CTL clone, termed BC10, was
chosen for further characterization based on its superior cytolytic
activity against RBL5/c. The fine antigen specificity of BC10 was
confirmed by intracellular IFNc production in response to a
dominant, Kb restricted COR93-CTL epitope [71].
Generation of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice
TCR-a and -b cDNAs were synthesized from 20 ng of total
messenger RNA extracted from COR93-specific CD8+ T cell
clone BC10 and ENV28-specific CD8+ T cell clone 6C2 [27,29],
and amplified by PCR as described by Yoshida, et al [73]. The
PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector
(Promega. Madison, WI) and then sequenced. The sequence
analyses revealed that CTL clone BC10 expressed a TCR
composed of Va13.1JaNEW06 and Vb8.1Jb1.2, while the CTL
clone 6C2 expressed a TCR composed of Va4.1JaNEW and
Vb1.1Jb2.5 chains. Flanking primers were designed to amplify the
rearranged Va13.1JaNEW06 and Vb8.1Jb1.2 genomic DNA
based on genomic sequence from these TCR loci. PCR products
were sequenced again and then inserted into the TCR expression
cassettes pTa and pTb [26], kindly provided by Dr. Diane Mathis.
Prokaryotic DNA sequences were removed from both vectors and
injected into fertilized CByB6F2 eggs as previously described [19].
Founders were screened by PCR and analyzed for the specific
TCR expression on CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood by FACS
analysis. A founder, BC10.3, expressed TCR specific for COR93
epitope and was bred against C57BL/6 mice (H-2b
) for 6
generation and then against CD45.1 mice (C57BL/6 background;
H-2b
) for at least 6 more generations. A founder, 6C2.36,
expressed TCRs specific for ENV28 epitope and was bred against
Balb/c mice (H-2d
) for more than 6 generations before being
mated with CD45.1 mice to produce H-2bxd F1 hybrids.
Adoptive transfer and vaccinia virus infection
Spleen cells were isolated from TCR transgenic mice BC10.3
(CD45.1+
;H-2b) or 6C2.36xCD45.1 F1 hybrids (CD45.1+; H-2bxd)
as previously described. Spleen cells from BC10.3 were transferred
Rescuing CD8+ T Cells from Exhaustion
PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003490

into either lineage 1.3.32 mice that were homozygous for HBV, or
into MC50 mice heterozygous for the HBV core antigen, or into
nontransgenic C57BL/6 mice (H-2b
). In selected experiments, the
mice were either intravenously infected with 26107 of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the HBV core antigen (cVac) or
received saline as a control. Spleen cells from 6C2.36xCD45.1 F1
hybrids were transferred into HBV transgenic mice lineage
1.3.326Balb/c F1 hybrids (H-2bxd) and syngeneic nontransgenic
recipients. Groups of 3–4 mice were sacrificed at various time
points after adoptive transfer and their livers, lymph nodes, and
spleen were harvested for further analysis.
Anti-CD40 and anti-CD62L antibody treatment
The FGK45 hybridoma producing rat IgG2a mAb against
mouse CD40 (aCD40) was provided by Dr. A. Rolink (Basel
Institute for Immunology, Basel, Switzerland) [43]. CD40 was
purified from FGK45 culture supernatants as previously described
[44]. Mice were intravenously injected with 100 mg of CD40
16 hours before adoptive transfer of HBV-specific naı¨ve T cells.
The mice were sacrificed at different time points after injection,
and their livers were harvested for further analysis (see below). A
monoclonal anti-CD62L antibody (clone Mel-14) was purchased
from BD Bioscience, and mice were intraperitoneally administered
with 100 mg of anti-CD62L mAb (aCD62L; clone Mel14) in
200 ml of PBS at 16, and 4 hours before adoptive transfer. If
necessary, further doses of antibodies were administered on day 2
after adoptive transfer.
Diphtheria Toxin (DTX) and Clodronate Liposome
treatment
Diphtheria Toxin (DTX) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
dissolved in PBS, and intraperitoneally administered (200 ng/
mouse) every other day. Clodronate Liposome and control
Liposome were both purchased from Encapusula NanoSciences,
and intravenously injected once (200 ml/mouse).
Lymphmononuclear cell preparation
Spleen cells, lymph node cells, and intrahepatic lymphocytes
(IHL) were prepared as previously described [21,74]. Briefly,
spleen cells and lymph node cells were isolated by pressing through
a 70 mm cell strainer (Becton Dickinson) with the plunger of a 1-ml
syringe and were washed three times with PBS and used for
further analysis. For IHL isolation, livers were perfused with 10 ml
of PBS via the portal vein to remove circulating lymphocytes and
the liver cell suspension was pressed through a 70 mm cell strainer
and digested with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies), containing 0.02% (w/v) collagenase IV (Sigma) and 0.002%
(w/v) DNase I (Sigma), for 40 minutes at 37uC. Cells were washed
with RPMI 1640 and then overlaid on Percoll/Histopaque
solution consisting of 12% Percoll (Pharmacia) and 88%
Histopaque-1083 (Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation for
20 min at 15006 g, the IHLs were isolated at the interface. The
lymphmononuclear cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640
medium and used for further analysis
Isolation of primary hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal
endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic dendritic cells, and
Kupffer cells
The livers of HBV transgenic mice lineage 1.3.32 were perfused
slowly via the inferior vena cava with 25 ml of warm Liver
Perfusion Medium (Gibco-Life Technologies) at a rate of 5 ml/
minute, and then digested with 50–75 ml of warm Liver Digest
Medium (Gibco-Life Technologies) at a rate of 5 ml/min.
Following complete digestion of the liver (10–15 min.), the gall
bladder was removed and the liver carefully excised. Cells were
collected from the liver by disrupting the liver capsule and swirling
the tissue in a petri dish containing Liver Digest Medium. Liver
nonparenchymal cells (LNPCs) containing LSECs were separated
from hepatocytes by centrifuging the cell suspension at 1006g for
2 min at room temperature. For LSEC isolation, the supernatant
containing LNPCs was washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Cellgro),
and the cell pellet was resupended with BD IMag Buffer at a
concentration of 16107
/ml. The cell suspension was incubated
with biotinylated antibody specific for lymphatic vessel endotherial
hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) antibody (eBioscience) (20 ml for
every 16107 of LNPCs) for 15 min on ice, washed twice, and
resuspended in IMag buffer at a concentration of 26107/ml. The
cell suspension was then incubated with BD IMag Streptavidin
Particles Plus-DM (BD Bioscience) (50 ml for every 16107 of
LNPCs) for 30 min on ice, and washed twice, and resuspended in
IMag buffer at a concentration of 2 to 86107
. LYVE-1+ cells were
then positively selected using BD IMagnet (BD Bioscience)
following the manufactures instruction, and then stained with
PE-conjugated CD147, APC-conjugated CD31, and Alexa 700
conjugated CD45. The purity and viability of LSEC
(CD147+
CD31+CD452) cells [75,76] was routinely greater than
80% and 90%, respectively. For hepatocyte isolation, the pellet
from the initial centrifugation step were washed in DMEM
containing 10% FCS and centrifuged at 1006g for 2 min at room
temperature. This washing step was repeated until the supernatant
was no longer cloudy. Hepatocyte viability was routinely higher
than 80%. For intrahepatic Dendritic cell (DC) and Kupffer cell
(KC) isolation, intrahepatic lymphocytes (IHLs) were isolated as
described in the previous section, and DCs and Kupffer cells were
positively selected using biotinylated CD11c and CD11b and
streptavidin Magnetic Particles (BD Biosciences), following the
manufactures instruction. The purity of DCs and KCs were then
analyzed by staining with PE-conjugated CD11b, APC-conjugated
CD11c, PE-Cy7-conjugated F480, and FITC-conjugated Ly6G.
The purities of DCs (CD11c+
CD11b+Ly6G2) and KCs
(CD11b+
F480+CD11c2Ly6G2) were routinely greater than
50%, and their viabilities higher than 90%. All antibodies were
purchased from BD Bioscience and eBioscience.
Flowcytometric T cell analysis
Lymphmononuclear cells isolated from the liver, spleen,
peripheral blood and lymph nodes were incubated with a mixture
containing the COR93-dimer or ENV28-dimer, APC-, or Pacific
Blue-conjugated anti-mouse CD8+
, PE-Cy7 conjugated antimouse CD69, APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD25 or CD62L,
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD45.1, and PE-conjugated PD-1
or CTLA-4 (BD Bioscience) for 1 hour on ice. After washing, the
cells were incubated for 30 minutes with APC-conjugated antimouse IgG at 4uC to detect dimer positive cells. Dimer without
peptide was used as a control. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
was performed using PE- or APC-conjugated anti-mouse IFNc,
APC-conjugated anti-mouse Granzyme B (GrB) (Caltag) after
incubating for 5 hours at 37uC in the presence of brefeldin A
(BFA), as previously described [21,25,49]. All antibodies were
purchased from BD Bioscience and eBioscience.
Tissue DNA and RNA analyses
Total liver DNA and RNA were analyzed for HBV replicative
intermediates by Southern blot, and for HBV RNA by Northern
blot, exactly as previously described [19,20]. The relative
abundance of specific DNA and RNA molecules was determined
Rescuing CD8+ T Cells from Exhaustion

by phosphor imaging analysis, using the Optiquant image analysis
software (Packard).
Biochemical analyses
The extent of hepatocellular injury was monitored by measuring
sALT activity at multiple time points after treatment as previously
described [20].
Statistical analysis
Student t test was performed using Microsoft Excel. Data are
depicted as the mean 6 SD, and P values,0.05 were considered
significant: *P,0.05, **P,0.01, ***P,0.001.
