Abstract
Background: Few data are available regarding the epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in ICU patients. The
aim of this study was to examine epidemiology and economic outcomes (length of stay, hospital costs) among ICU
patients with IA who lack traditional risk factors for IA, such as cancer, transplants, neutropenia or HIV infection.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study using Premier Inc. Perspective™ US administrative hospital database (2005–
2008). Adults with ICU stays and aspergillosis (ICD-9 117.3 plus 484.6) who received initial antifungal therapy (AF) in
the ICU were included. Patients with traditional risk factors (cancer, transplant, neutropenia, HIV/AIDS) were
excluded. The relationship of antifungal therapy and co-morbidities to economic outcomes were examined using
Generalized linear models.
Results: From 6,424 aspergillosis patients in the database, 412 (6.4%) ICU patients with IA were identified. Mean age
was 63.9 years and 53% were male. Frequent co-morbidities included steroid use (77%), acute respiratory failure
(76%) and acute renal failure (41%). In-hospital mortality was 46%. The most frequently used AF was voriconazole
(71% received at least once). Mean length of stay (LOS) was 26.9 days and mean total hospital cost was $76,235.
Each 1 day lag before initiating AF therapy was associated with 1.28 days longer hospital stay and 3.5% increase in
costs (p < 0.0001 for both).
Conclusions: Invasive aspergillosis in ICU patients is associated with high mortality and hospital costs. Antifungal
timing impacts economic outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of timely diagnosis, appropriate
treatment, and consideration of Aspergillus as a potential etiology in ICU patients.

Background
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with neutropenia,
hematologic malignancy and organ transplants. Despite
improvements in diagnostic modalities and the antifungal armamentarium, including broad-spectrum azoles
and the echinocandin antifungals, mortality remains
high [1-3]. Because of advances in medical care, there
has been an expansion in the spectrum of patients at
risk for IA beyond the traditional risk groups. An emerging and understudied population is critically ill patients
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [4-6]. The
extended survival of ICU patients related to improvements
in supportive and intensive care, progress in the treatment
of respiratory failure, as well as treatment of bacterial
infections all may increase the risk of IA in the ICU population [7].
The incidence of IA among ICU patients is estimated to
be as high as 7%; however, the frequency of IA is difficult
to determine because of several important limitations of
IA diagnosis [5]. For example, classic radiographic signs
(“halo” or “air crescent”) of IA are not always present in
ICU patients, determination of Aspergillus colonization
versus infection is problematic, and many diagnostic studies have not yet been validated adequately in nonneutropenic patient populations [4,8]. Also lacking among
ICU patients with IA are studies evaluating antifungal
therapy and relationship to economic outcomes [9-11]. As
diagnostic methods for IA improve and patient survival is
extended related to improvements in supportive and

intensive care, an increased incidence of IA in ICU
patients should be expected.
A better understanding of IA, its treatment, and economic outcomes in ICU patients are needed. To date,
few cohorts of ICU patients with IA have been evaluated
thoroughly [4,5,10,12-14]. Herein, with use of a large administrative database we describe antifungal treatment
and clinical and economic outcomes of ICU patients
with aspergillosis.
Methods
Setting and design
This is a retrospective, observational analysis of multicenter ICU patient data evaluating clinical and economic
outcomes of patients with invasive aspergillosis.
Data collection
Data were derived from Premier’s Perspective™ Comparative Database, a hospital-based, service-level database that provides detailed patient-level resource
utilization, diagnoses and procedures from a nationally
representative group of > 600 US hospitals [11,15]. Inpatient data from the years 2005 through 2008 were
abstracted and included patient demographics, principal
and secondary diagnoses and procedures codes (according to the International Classification of Disease 9th revision, ICD-9), hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS),
cost and charge details, and mortality and discharge
status.
Study population
We included ICU patients with a diagnosis of invasive
aspergillosis who started antifungal therapy during their
ICU stay and received at least 5 days of antifungal therapy. A case of invasive aspergillosis was defined as a patient at least 18 years-of-age who received a primary or
secondary diagnosis code of “aspergillosis” (ICD-9 code
117.3x) plus “pneumonia in aspergillosis” (ICD-9 code
484.6) [16]. In order to focus only on the emerging
population of ICU patients, the following patient populations with “traditional” risk factors for IA were
excluded: Hematologic malignancy (200.xx – 208.xx);
AIDS/HIV (042); bone marrow transplants (41.00 –
41.09); heart transplant (37.51); kidney transplant
(55.6x); liver transplant (50.5x); intestine transplant
(46.97); lung transplant (33.5x); combined heart / lung
transplant (33.6); aplastic anemia (284.x); neutropenia
(288.0x); reticuloendothelial / immunity disorders (279.x,
except 279.4 , autoimmune disease not elsewhere classified). Patients having non-invasive asperillosis were also
excluded: allergic aspergillosis (sinusitis) (518.6); chronic
mycotic otitis externa (380.15). For patient comorbidity,
the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated
based on Deyo’s method using ICD-9 CM diagnosis codes
[17,18]. The Schematic for patient selection is demonstrated in Figure 1.
Antifungal therapy
Standardized charge codes, in billing records, were used
to identify the following antifungal drugs that were
administered during hospitalization: voriconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B. The first use of
an antifungal drug was identified as the ‘Index event’ and
reflected days from hospital admission. The length of
therapy (days) was computed for each patient. Antifungal therapies were further categorized and labeled as
“monotherapy” (defined as patients starting with only
one antifungal therapy within 3 days of the initial antifungal treatment) and “combination therapy” (defined as
patients starting with more than one antifungal therapy
within 3 days of the initial antifungal treatment).
Outcomes
The primary outcome, length of stay (LOS), for each
hospitalization was abstracted from the dataset, whereas
length of ICU stay and Mechanical Ventilation (MV)
were computed using the standardized charge codes
within billing records. Total patient costs were based on
the actual hospital cost to treat the patient and were
provided with the dataset. Costs incurred among different hospital departments were also generated using billing records.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and
clinical characteristics as well as for antifungal therapies
and resource utilization. To further assess the variation in
resource use among patients, multiple regression analyses
were performed to characterize the association of independent variables with (1) hospital LOS (defined as time
to discharge alive) and (2) hospital cost among survivors
and non-survivors. The term cost for the purposes of this
analysis refers to actual costs incurred by the provider or
hospital to administer treatment and patient care; potential patient copayments were not included. To avoid competing risks (impact of mortality on LOS), only patients
who survived at least 30 days were included in the regression analyses. Given that LOS and cost data were not normally distributed, generalized linear models (GLMs) were
used with Gamma distributions. Variables significant at
α = 0.05 level in the univariate analyses (Pearson correlations) and/or variables clinically relevant were included in
multivariable analyses. Independent variables in the primary models included initial antifungal therapy (excluding
fluconazole), mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure
diagnosis, hospital type (teaching vs nonteaching hospital),

insurance status, hospital location, severity of illness
(using APR-severity, extreme vs. major, and timing of antifungal therapy (i.e., AF index event).
For the primary model, timing of antifungal therapy was a
continuous variable, defined as number of days from date of
hospital admission to the start date of initial AF therapy. To
better ascertain delay in appropriate antifungal therapy, a second model was constructed that included fluconazole (versus
other antifungal agents) in addition to the variables above. For
this model, timing of antifungal therapy was defined based on
the receipt on aspergillus-active therapy. Here, a “delay” in
therapy meant that patients received initial therapy with fluconazole and then were switched to an aspergillus-active therapy. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2
(SAS Institute). All statistical tests were two-sided and performed using a 5% significance level (α = 0.05).
Results
Of 6,424 unique patient hospitalizations with aspergillosis abstracted from the dataset, after exclusion criteria
were applied, 412 (6.4%) ICU patients with IA were
identified and analyzed. The complete ICU population
during the four-year study period was 2,470,118 patients,
resulting in an IA prevalence of 0.017%. Patient characteristics and outcomes are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Mean
age at ICU admission was 63.9 years; 52.9% were male
and 67.7% white. Frequent underlying conditions were
acute respiratory failure (76.0%), acute renal failure
(41.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (36.9%)
and septicemia/septic shock (35.9%). Two-hundred
ninety-eight (72.3%) patients received mechanical ventilation at least one day. Mean hospital LOS was 26.9 days
and mean length of ICU stay was 15.8 days. In-hospital

mortality was 45.6%, with 33.1% dead before 30 days of
hospitalization. Average total cost per patient was $76,235,
and the majority of costs were related to room and board
(Figure 2).
Antifungal therapy
On average, antifungal therapy was initiated on day 9 of
the hospital stay, with a mean length of therapy 14.6 days
while in the hospital (Table 2). The mean number of antifungal drugs received per patient was 1.7 (range, 1–4).
Most patients (85.9%) received monotherapy. Overall, 292
(70.9%) patients received at least one dose of voriconazole;
161 (39.1%) caspofungin; 53 (12.9%) amphotericin B; 34
(8.3%) itraconazole and 22 (5.4%) micafungin or anidulafungin. Combination therapy was used in 58 (14.1%) of
412 patients and the most frequent combination was voriconazole plus caspofungin. Ninety-eight (27.7%) patients
received fluconazole before the addition or change to a
drug with Aspergillus activity. A summary of specific antifungal therapy can be found in Table 3.
Factors associated with hospital LOS or cost
The multivariable regression analyses of factors associated with LOS or cost can be found in Table 4. For the
primary model (excluding fluconazole) the only independent predictor of LOS identified was timing of initial
antifungal therapy: a one day delay in starting antiaspergillus antifungal therapy was associated with approximately 1.28 days longer LOS (p < 0.0001). With
regard to hospital cost, patients who received mechanical ventilation or who had acute renal failure incurred
85.4% and 43.7% more costs, respectively, when compared to those who did not (p < 0.001 for both). Severity
of illness (extreme versus major) using the APR measure, was associated with a 57% increase in hospital costs
(p < 0.05). The timing of initial antifungal therapy also
had a significant impact on hospital cost: a one day delay
in starting anti-aspergillus antifungal therapy was associated with approximately 4% higher total costs per day
(p < 0.0001).
For the sub-analysis of the model including fluconazole there was one notable difference in the results:
patients who received initial fluconazole (versus initial
voriconazole) on average had almost 6 days longer LOS
than patients who received initial voriconazole (p < 0.05)
and 33% increase in hospital costs (p < 0.05).
Discussion
This large US study is one of few to investigate economic
outcomes in patients with aspergillosis and provides an
understanding of the epidemiology of aspergillosis among
ICU patients given newly available antifungal treatment
strategies. Our findings, using 2005–2008 multi-center
administrative data, demonstrate that ICU patients with
aspergillosis have many co-morbidities, high mortality and
incur substantial hospital costs. The majority of costs per
patient were driven by hospital LOS (room and board).
Risk factors for developing aspergillosis in the ICU
population include high-dose corticosteroids and comorbidities such as renal failure, COPD, and diabetes
[4-7]. Among our patient population, 76% of the study
cohort received acute high dose corticosteroid therapy
during the inpatient stay. Many had respiratory failure;
with 72% requiring mechanical ventilation. Other frequent co-morbidities included acute renal failure, SIRS,
COPD and septicemia/shock. The frequency of comorbidities illustrate the broad spectrum of illnesses that
may be present in non-traditional IA hosts, and underscores the importance of consideration of aspergillosis in
critically ill patients.
Our study reported in-hospital mortality of 46%. Several studies reporting data from 1997–1999 described
higher mortality rates (75-80%) in ICU patients with IA
[9,19,20]. However, these studies pre-date the availability

studied in our analysis. Our study may reflect a recent
trend of decreasing mortality in patients with aspergillosis [11,21,22]. Kim and colleagues describe crude
in-hospital mortality of 36.7% reported for years 2005–
2006 in a broad national cohort of hospitalized patients
with IA [11]. This decreasing trend may have resulted
from numerous factors, including antifungal therapy,
more timely and accurate diagnostic approaches, earlier
initiation of therapy, or technological advances in ICU
care [21,22].
The 2008 Infectious Diseases Society of America
guidelines for the treatment of aspergillosis recommend
voriconazole as primary therapy [23]. Consistent with
those guidelines, among our cohort, voriconazole was
the most widely used antifungal, with 47% receiving it as
first-line monotherapy and 71% of the patients receiving
it during hospitalization. Caspofungin was second-most
common antifungal with Aspergillus activity employed,
used initially in 18% of patients. Use of combination
antifungal therapy for aspergillosis was not common,
administered in only 14% of patients, and is not recommended in recent guidelines [23]. Fluconazole, which
does not have Aspergillus activity, was used as the initial
antifungal in 28% of patients. We were unable to determine from these data if initial fluconazole was appropriate initial therapy (either as prophylaxis or treatment of
invasive candidiasis) for these patients. We suspect that

may have been attempted in some patients, with a change
to aspergillus-active therapy once the diagnosis of aspergillosis was suspected or confirmed.
Our study indicates a potential impact of antifungal
timing on economic outcomes. Multiple regression analyses revealed that delay of antifungal therapy resulted in
increased LOS and hospital costs: each 1 hospital day
lag of initial antifungal therapy was associated with a
1.28 day LOS increase and a 4% cost increase. However,
it is important to note that our definition of timing of
antifungal therapy was based on hospital admission date
to antifungal start date, as the precise timing of
diagnosis of IA could not be defined with these data.
These findings support the need for better, rapid diagnostic methods for IA in ICU patients and potentially
earlier institution of antifungal therapy. A high index of
suspicion of IA is warranted in critically ill patients.
Length of stay or costs were not impacted by initial voriconazole use (compared to echinocandins or other antifungal use) in our analyses. In contrast, Kim and
colleagues found that initial voriconazole, caspofungin,
or amphotericin B lipid complex were independently
associated with a reduced hospital LOS and costs [11].
An important difference was that Kim and colleagues

analyzed all hospitalized patients with aspergillosis, not
just ICU patients. Because of the severity of illness and
increased mortality among ICU patients, perhaps antifungal therapy, in relation to co-morbidities, may have
less of an impact on economic outcomes in critically ill
patients. In the sub-analysis, initial fluconazole use (versus initial voriconazole) was associated with increased
LOS; however, from these data it is unclear if this represents initial treatment of candidiasis or a true “delay” in
appropriate antifungal therapy for IA.
Our study has limitations typical for administrative
database analyses that must rely on diagnosis coding.
Diagnosis of IA is difficult, and diagnostic guidelines
have not yet been written for ICU patients without traditional risk factors. In addition, there are no clearly
defined ICD-9 codes to identify “invasive aspergillosis.”
As such, misclassification may have occurred in our cohort. Our case diagnosis included code 117.3 (aspergillosis) plus the 484.6 code (pneumonia with aspergillosis).
In addition, we excluded patients with non-invasive
codes such as allergic aspergillosis (sinusitis) 518.6 and
chronic mycotic otitis externa. While the database did
not provide clinical information about laboratory test
results, billing data revealed that approximately twothirds of the patients had a bronchoscopy, needle biopsy,
or Aspergillus serology, supporting the diagnosis of IA.
Nevertheless, as a recent validation study reported, specificity using ICD-9 codes for aspergillosis ranges from
28-88% [16].
Another limitation is the competing risk issue coming
from the high mortality risk in this ICU population, which
usually complicates the models constructed to evaluate
LOS. We attempted to reduce this confounding effect by
examining the outcomes separately (discharge alive and
discharge dead) and redefining the non-survivors as
patients who expired within 30 days of hospitalization to
minimize variance between survivors and non-survivors.
Given that the primary interest of this study was not to
identify predicting factors of ICU mortality, rather to
examine the impact of antifungal therapy on the outcome
of LOS/discharge alive, the problem of competing risk
should be less relevant in the GLM analyses among redefined survivors [24,25].
A sensitivity analysis (not shown) was performed with
use of Cox regression analysis and resulted in similar
findings. Additional limitations include the study’s retrospective, nonrandomized design; however, the use of observational data adds a unique and important aspect to
comparative effectiveness assessments beyond the clinical trial. Patients’ activity outside of the Premier group
of hospitals was not captured including costs charged
outside of the hospital billing system such as physicians’
fees; however, they are not likely to contribute significantly to overall costs.
Conclusion
This large, US retrospective analysis describes the epidemiology of ICU patients with aspergillosis, an emerging nontraditional group. Economic outcomes including LOS and
hospital costs are impacted by antifungal therapy and patient
co-morbidities. These findings underscore the importance
of awareness of potential aspergillosis, timely diagnosis and
appropriate, early treatment among ICU patients.
