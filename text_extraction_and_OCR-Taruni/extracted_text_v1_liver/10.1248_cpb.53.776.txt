The root of Stellera chamaejasme L. (Thymelaeaceae), a
toxic plant widely distributed in the north and southwest of
China, is used as “Langdu” in traditional Chinese medicine.
It has long been used for the treatment of scabies, tinea, stubborn skin ulcers, chronic tracheitis, and tuberculosis in
China.1) In recent years, “Langdu” is also being used for the
treatment of intestinal, gastric, and pulmonary cancers.2,3)
These clinical applications suggest S. chamaejasme roots
may contain antineoplastic and antifungal components. The
ethanol extract of S. chamaejasme roots was screened using
Pyricularia oryzae as the indicator organism and showed potent activity. Bioactivity-directed fractionation indicated that
the EtOAc fraction showed the most potent activity (Table 2).
Further fractionation and purification of the EtOAc extract
led to the isolation and characterization of two new C-3/C-3
biflavanones, chamaejasmenin D (1) and isochamaejasmenin
B (2), together with the five known biflavanones chamaejasmenin A (3),4) chamaejasmenin B (4),4) neochamaejasmin A
(5),5) sikokianin A (6)
6) and chamaejasmenin C (7)4) (Fig. 1).
1, 2 and 3 showed potent activity against P. oryzae. This
paper reports the structure elucidation of the new compounds, and antimitotic and antifungal activities of 1—7.
Results and Discussion
Chamaejasmenin D (1), obtained as white amorphous
powder, showed a [MH] peak at m/z 569.1449 (Calcd for
C32H25O10: 569.1448) in the negative HR-ESI-MS, corresponding to a molecular formula of C32H26O10. The EI-MS
gave two major fragments at m/z 299 ([MC15H11O5]
) and
271 ([MC17H15O5]
), indicating that the molecule was
composed with two units. The color development reaction
with HCl–Mg reagent showed a red color, indicating that 1 is
a flavonoid. The IR spectrum showed the presence of a 
hydroxyl group (3480 cm1
), conjugated carbonyl group
(1642 cm1
), and aromatic ring (1600, 1517 cm1). Its UV
spectrum showed a maximum absorption at 298 nm (log e
4.44) and a shoulder peak at 330 nm, which are characteristic
of an A-ring oxygen substituted flavanone.1)
The 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) contained signals of
two methoxyl protons [d 3.82 (3H, s), 3.84 (3H, s)], two protons of C2-H, C2-H [d 5.52 (1H, br s), 5.44 (1H, br s)], and
two protons of C3-H, C3-H [d 3.08 (1H, s), 2.99 (1H, s)] at
the C and C rings of biflavanone, and four hydroxyl protons
[d 8.42, 9.49, 11.56, 11.56]. The twelve aromatic proton signals [d 5.79—7.15] showed the presence of two sets of typical 5,7-dioxygenated A rings [d 5.79 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz), 5.89
(1H, d, J2.2 Hz), 5.93 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz ), 6.02 (1H, d,
J2.2 Hz)], and two sets of typical para-oxygenated B rings
[d 6.76 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz), 6.86 (2H, d, J8.6 Hz), 7.04 (2H,

Two new C-3/C-3 biflavanones, chamaejasmenin D (1) and isochamaejasmenin B (2), were isolated from the
roots of Stellera chamaejasme, together with five known biflavanones, chamaejasmenin A (3), chamaejasmenin B
(4), neochamaejasmin A (5), sikokianin A (6), and chamaejasmenin C (7). Their structures were elucidated by
spectroscopic methods, including 2D NMR techniques. Among these compounds, 1—3 demonstrated potent antimitotic and antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 6.25, 6.25, and
3.12 mg/ml, respectively.

d, J8.5 Hz), 7.15 (2H, d, J8.6 Hz)].1)
From the 13C-NMR data (Table 1), two carbonyls (d C
197.4, 197.0) and two methoxyl groups (d C 55.6, 56.2) were
observed. The C-2, C-2 (d C 81.4, 81.3) and C-3, C-3 (d C
47.5, 47.4) signals in 13C-NMR suggested 1 consisted of two
units of flavanones.4—6) Linkage of the B ring to the C ring
was established at C-2 by HMBC experiments, in which 2-H
[d 7.15 (1H, d, J8.6 Hz)] and 6-H [d 7.15 (1H, d,
J8.6 Hz)] correlated with C-2 (d C 81.4), 2-H (d 5.52) coupled with C-1 (d C 129.0). In the same way, linkage of the B
ring to C-2 of the C ring was deduced by the cross peaks of
2-H [d 7.04 (1H, d, J8.5 Hz)] and 6-H [d 7.04 (1H, d,
J8.5 Hz)] with C-2 (d C 81.3), and 2-H (d 5.44) with C-1
(d C 128.0). The presence of signals of 2-H [d 5.52 (1H,
br s)], 2-H [d 5.44 (1H, br s)], 6-H [d 5.89 (1H, d,
J2.2 Hz)], 6-H [d 5.79 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz)], 8-H [d 6.02
(1H, d, J2.2 Hz)], 8-H [d 5.93 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz)], 2,6-H
[d 7.15 (2H, d, J8.6 Hz)], 2,6-H [d 7.04 (2H, d,
J8.5 Hz)], 3,5-H [d 6.86 (2H, d, J8.6 Hz)], and 3,5-H
[d 6.76 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz)] suggested that the linkage of the
two flavanones was only at the C-3/C-3 positions, which was
confirmed by comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 1
with those of known C-3/C-3 biflavanones.4—6) The HMBC
correlations of one methoxyl group (d 3.82) with C-7 (d C
168.8) on the A ring, and another methoxyl group (d 3.84)
with C-4 (d C 160.3) on the B ring indicated that these two
methoxyl groups were connected to C-7 and C-4, respectively. The signals of C-10 (d C 104.0) and C-10
(d C 103.5) were determined by HMBC experiments, in
which protons at d 5.98 (6-H) and 6.02 (8-H) correlated with
C-10 (d C 104.0), and protons at d 5.79 (6-H) and 5.93 (8-
H) correlated with C-10 (d C 103.5), respectively. The stereochemistries at the C-2/C-3 and C-3/C-2 positions were determined as cis–cis by comparison of the J-values (0 and
0 Hz) of the corresponding protons with the known C-3/C-3
biflavanones.4—6) However, the chirality of C-3/C-3 remains
uncertain, like those biflavanones isolated from the same
plant in previous studies.1,4—6) The structure of 1 was established to be [3,3-Bi-4H-1-benzopyran]-4,4-dione, 2,2,3,
3-tetrahydro-5,5,7-trihydroxy-7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-(), and named chamaejasmenin D.
Isochamaejasmenin B (2), a brown amorphous powder,
had a molecular formula of C32H26O10 established by the negative HR-ESI-MS ([MH], m/z 569.1449 (Calcd for
C32H25O10: 569.1448)). The 1H-, 13C-NMR (Table 1), IR and
UV data suggested 2 to be a C-3/C-3 biflavanone like 1, and
its structure was highly symmetric, which was also indicated
by the EI-MS [m/z 570 (M), 285 (1/2 M)].
The signals of two methoxyl protons [d 3.82 (6H, s)], two
sets of typical 5,7-dioxygenated A rings [d 5.97 (2H, d, J
1.3 Hz), 5.82 (2H, d, J1.3 Hz)], and two sets of typical
para-oxygenated B rings [d 7.00 (4H, d, J8.6 Hz), d 7.22
(4H, d, J8.6 Hz)] in the 1H-NMR, together with the presence of two carbonyls (d C 196.0), two methoxyl groups (d C
55.6), and C-2, C-2 (d C 81.7) and C-3, C-3 (d C 48.3) signals in the 13C-NMR indicated that 2 was similar to the
known C-3/C-3 biflavanone chamaejasmenin B.4) Further,
the HMBC correlations of two methoxyl groups (d 3.82)
with C-4, C-4 (d C 161.4) on the B, B rings revealed that
these two methoxyl groups were also connected to C-4 and
C-4 as chamaejasmenin B, indicating that 2 and chamaejasmenin B had the same plane structure. Comparison of the
1
H-NMR spectral data of 2 with those of chamaejasmenin B
revealed that the chemical shift values and splitting patterns
of 2 agreed well with those of chamaejasmenin B, except that
the signals of 2,2-H [d 5.32 (2H, s)] and 3,3-H [d 2.98 (2H,

s)] in chamaejasmenin B were different from those of 2,2-H
[d 4.97 (2H, br s)] and 3,3-H [d 3.86 (2H, br s)] in 2, which
suggested that the stereochemistries of 2 and chamaejasmenin B were different.4,7—9) The [a]D
20 values of 2 and
chamaejasmenin B were 0° (c0.1, MeOH) and 150°
(c1.0, EtOH), respectively, indicating that 2 was the mesoform and chamaejasmine B was the d-form. There are four
chirality carbons at the C-2, C-3, C-2, and C-3 positions in
2 and chamaejasmenin B, respectively. The J-values (0 and
0 Hz) of 2,3-H and 2,3-H in 2 indicated that 2 has cis–cis
geometry at the C-2/C-3 and C-3/C-2 positions, same as
that of chamaejasmenin B. Therefore, the differences in their
stereochemistries should be only at the C-3/C-3 positions.
The stereochemistry of 2 at the C-3/C-3 position was exactly adverse to that of chamaejasmenin B (Fig. 1), which
had cis or trans geometry at the C-3/C-3 positions.4) However, the chirality of C-3/C-3 remains uncertain, like those
known biflavanones.1,4—6) In previous studies, the meso-form
and d- or l-form biflavanones as 2 and chamaejasmenin B
were commonly reported, such as isochamaejasmin (mesoform)7) and chamaejasmenin (l-form),8) isoneochamaejasmin
A (meso-form)9) and neochamaejasmin A (d-form)5) isolated
from the same plant. The structure of 2 was thus established
to be [3,3-Bi-4H-1-benzopyran]-4,4-dione, 2,2,3,3-tetrahydro-5,5,7,7-tetrahydroxy-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-
(meso), and named isochamaejasmenin B.
Compounds 3—7 were identified as chamaejasmenin A
(3),4) chamaejasmenin B (4),4) neochamaejasmin A (5),5)
sikokianin A (6),6) and chamaejasmenin C (7)
4) by comparison of their 1
H-, 13C-NMR, MS, and [a]D data with those reported previously.
Morphological deformations of mycelia or conidia of microorganisms, such as curling, swelling, hyperdivergence,
bead formation, and inhibition of germination, are often induced in the presence of bioactive substances.10) A new
screening bioassay detecting deformation of mycelia germinated from conidia of Pyricularia oryzae, a phytopathogenic
fungus, was developed for quantitative application in screening antimitotic and antifungal agents by Kobayashi et al.11)
This bioassay method is quick, easy to perform, and has been
efficiently used in the screening of antimitotic, antineoplastic, and antifungal agents,12) such as rhizoxin13) and fusarielin
A14) from fungal metabolites.
This bioassay method was also successfully applied to
screen for antineoplastic and antifungal agents from traditional Chinese medicines.15) In our study, the activities of extracts or compounds were screened using P. oryzae as the indicator organism in a 96-well micro-plate assay for inhibition
of hyphal growth or for deformation of conidia; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were calculated based
on weight per volume (mg/ml).11) The positive control, rhizoxin, had a MIC value of 1.25 mg/ml.
Compounds 1—7 were screened using P. oryzae as the indicator organism. Chamaejasmenin A (3), chamaejasmenin
D (1), and isochamaejasmenin B (2) demonstrated potent antimitotic and antifungal activity with MIC values of 3.12,
6.25, and 6.25 mg/ml, respectively, chamaejasmenin B (4),
neochamaejasmin A (5) and sikokianin A (6) showed weak
activity, and chamaejasmenin C (7) was inactive (Table 2).
Previous chemical and pharmacological studies on S.
chamaejasme indicated that the biflavanones from this plant
exhibited antibacterial and immunomodulating activity,1)
while some of the biflavanones also showed anti-HIV activity.16) In our study, the biflavanones isolated from S. chamaejasme root showed potent antimitotic and antifungal activity
against P. oryzae, which suggested that the biflavanones
might be the principal antimitotic and antifungal components
in S. chamaejasme.
Experimental
General Experimental Procedures Optical rotations were measured on
a P-1020 polarimeter (JASCO, Japan). UV spectra were obtained with a UV260 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). IR spectroscopic data were
recorded on a Avatar 360 E.S.R. FT-IR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet,
U.S.A.) with KBr pellets. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX-400
NMR, chemical shifts were reported with respect to acetone-d6 (d H 2.04, d C
206.0 ppm). EI-MS were recorded on an Agilent 5973N mass spectrometer.
HR-ESI-MS data were obtained on a Q-Tof Micro spectrometer (Micro
Mass, England). Column chromatography was performed with silica gel
(200—300 mesh, Yantai, China), silica gel H (10—40 mm, Yantai, China),
Lichroprep RP18 gel (40—63 mm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and
Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia). TLC analysis was run on GF254 precoated silica gel plates (10—40 mm, Yantai, China). An inverted microscope (37B,
Shanghai Sixth Optic Instrument Factory, Shanghai, China) was used for observing the shape of the mycelia that germinated from conidia.
Plant Material The roots of Stellera chamaejasme L. were collected in
Ganzi, Sichuan Province, China, in September of 2003. The identity of the
plant material was verified by Professor Daofeng Chen, and a voucher specimen (DFC-RXLD0309) is deposited in the Herbarium of Materia Medica,
Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University,
Shanghai, China.
Extraction and Isolation The roots (10 kg) of S. chamaejasme were
air-dried, ground, and extracted with 95% EtOH at room temperature. The
EtOH extract was evaporated in vacuo to yield a semisolid (1500 g), 1490 g
of which was suspended in H2O (5000 ml) and partitioned successively with
petroleum ether, CHCl3, EtOAc, n-BuOH to yield 120 g, 30 g, 430 g, and
125 g, respectively. Three hundred grams of the bioactive EtOAc extract was
subjected to column chromatography on Si gel eluted with CHCl3–MeOH
(99 : 1, 49 : 1, 19 : 1, 9 : 1, 4 : 1, 1 : 1) and MeOH to yield fractions 1—10.
Fraction 3 (1.77 g) was chromatographed over Si gel (petroleum ether–
EtOAc, 6.5 : 3.5) to give fractions 3a—e. Fraction 3a was crystallized repeatedly with petroleum ether–acetone to provide 7 (71 mg). Fraction 4 (7.82 g)
was purified by column chromatography over Si gel (petroleum ether–
EtOAc, 6.5 : 3.5) to afford fractions 4a—f. Fraction 4b was eluted with
CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (98 : 2 : 0.2) over Si gel, followed by purification with
RP18 (CH3CN–H2O, 3 : 2) to give 2 (12 mg) and 3 (21 mg). Fraction 4c was
chromatographed over Si gel eluting with CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (98 : 2 : 0.2)
to provide 1 (32 mg) and 4 (271 mg). Fraction 6 (9 g) was fractioned over Si
gel (CHCl3–MeOH–H2O, 95 : 5 : 0.2) to afford fractions 6a—f. Fraction 6c
was purified by column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20 (40% EtOH)
to give 6 (50 mg). Fraction 6f was isolated over Si gel with CHCl3–
MeOH–H2O (95 : 5 : 0.2) and purified successively with 50% MeOH over
Sephadex LH-20 to afford 5 (11 mg).

Pyricularia oryzae Bioassay The assay was performed by the method of
Kobayashi et al.11) P. oryzae was grown on a slant culture medium consisting
of yeast extract (0.2%), soluble starch (1%) and agar (2%) at 27 °C. The
conidia were collected after 12 to 14 d of inoculation by suspending in sterilized water. The suspension was filtered to separate conidia from mycelia.
The filtrate was added to a 2% solution of yeast extract, which was adjusted
778 Vol. 53, No. 7

to a final concentration of 0.02% with sterilized water. For quantitative estimation, an aliquot of the conidia suspension was taken on a microscope to
count the number of conidia before adding yeast extract. The suspension
was adjusted to 4104 conidia/ml by adding sterilized water. A 96-well
micro-plate was used for the bioassay. Rhizoxin was used as the positive
control. One column of the 96-well micro-plate was used for one test material with eight different concentrations. The assay plates were incubated at
27 °C for 16 h and the shape of the mycelia that germinated from conidia
was observed and compared with controls under an inverted microscope.
