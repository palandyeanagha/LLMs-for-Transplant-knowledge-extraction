Abstract
Background: Chronic liver disease (CLD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and can lead to hepatic
fibrosis. This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) in
the assessment of hepatic fibrosis.
Methods: A systematic search of databases was performed for publications on SWE during the period between 2010
and 2017. The identified studies were analyzed using Meta-disc 1.4 software to integrate and analyze the data.
Results: Eleven studies comprising 1560 patients were included for analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic
odds ratio were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.82–0.87), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76–0.82) and 30.81 (95% CI: 16.55–57.34), respectively for patients with a
Metavir-score of ≥ F2; 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84–0.91), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.87), 41.45 (95% CI:18.25–94.45), respectively for patients with
≥ F3; 0.88(95% CI: 0.83–0.91), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.92), 67.18 (95% CI:30.02–150.31), respectively for patients with ≥ F4. The areas
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the three groups were 0.9147, 0.9223 and 0.9520, respectively.
Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that SWE is highly accurate for detecting and staging hepatic fibrosis.

Background
Chronic liver disease (CLD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and can lead to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
CLD is a major health burden in the United States and
around the world. During the course of CLD, the death
and inflammation of hepatocytes can lead to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and abnormal distribution,
resulting in hepatic fibrosis and its complications. If not
treated timely, this would eventually develop into cirrhosis
[1]. The causes of this condition include the infection with
hepatitis viruses, compromised autoimmune response,
poisoning and metabolic damage. Effective treatment
methods for CLD are now available and can prevent progression of the hepatic fibrotic process or even result in
regression of fibrosis when administered in the early
stages of fibrosis [2]. Currently, percutaneous liver biopsy
is the standard of reference for clinical assessment of hepatic fibrosis [3, 4]. However, it is invasive and may cause
complications because of puncture, although the assessment is accurate [5]. A reliable noninvasive technique is
needed for detecting and staging fibrosis as well for as
evaluating treatment response [6]. In the recent years, several quantitative and noninvasive techniques have become
available for measurements of liver stiffness, such as realtime tissue elastography (RTE), transient elastography
(TE) (Fibroscan; Echosense, Paris, France), and real-time
shear wave elastography (SWE) (Aixplorer, Supersonic
Imagine, France) [7, 8]. Among them, SWE is a relatively
new imaging technique that allows an estimation of the
stiffness of the tissues in a quantitative way [9, 10]. It is
based on the assumption that tissues that have pathological changes tend to be harder and less elastic than the
surrounding healthy tissues. Estimation of the stiffness is
based on the fact that the propagation of mechanical
waves is greater in less elastic materials. The very quick
data acquisition enables the assessment of tissue elasticity
in real time as a colour map of stiffness superimposed

over a grey-scaled B-mode. Putting a region of interest
(ROI) in the area being investigated provides quantitative
information about tissue elasticity in kilopascals or meter
per second [11]. At present, SWE technology has been
widely and successfully used in diagnosis of various diseases
such as diseases in gland, vessel wall and superficial organ
[12, 13]. It is also used to detection of portal hypertension
in cirrhosis which can use to reflect the liver stiffness with
comparable or better success rate and accuracy as compared with TE [14] and can be used to diagnose patients
with or without clinical significant portal hypertension [15].
Although many studies, including meta-analysis [16],
have shown that liver elasticity measured by SWE is related to the pathological stage of fibrosis, the accuracy
and diagnostic thresholds based on SWE are still controversial and the quality criteria and optimal number of
measurements need to be defined [17]. Therefore, we
performed a meta-analysis to assess the overall performance of SWE in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis.
Methods
This study was performed according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses statement [18]. Because this meta-analysis did
not involve identifiable patient information, investigational review board approval was not necessary.
Literature search
A systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase,
Scopus, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,
Google Scholar, China knowledge Network (http://www.
cnki.net/), China Biology Medicine disc (http://www.
sinomed.ac.cn/zh/), VIP (http://qikan.cqvip.com) and
Wanfangd (http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn) databases
was performed for the 7-year period prior to May 2017.
An initial search strategy involving the following free
text words “hepatic fibrosis,” “elastography,” “liver cirrhosis,” “elasticity imaging techniques”, “fibroscan”, “liver
physiology,” “liver stiffness,” “liver elasticity,” “elasticity
imaging techniques/methods,” “ultrasonic elasticity imaging”, “sensitivity and specificity,” “reproducibility,” “repeatability,” and “reliability.” In addition, a manual
search of reference lists from primary studies was performed to locate any potential studies missed with electronic search strategies. The identified studies were then
screened independently by two observers to identify
studies that enable analysis of diagnostic odds ratio.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies those study
subjects were patients with liver fibrosis caused by various causes; (b) studies that used SWE to detect and
stage the severity of fibrosis; (c) studies that clearly
staged liver fibrosis based on the Metavir-score [19]. If 2
or more publications came from the same study, the
publications with larger sample size were included. The
exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) duplicate publication (based on the same primary study), (b) non-original
research (such as reviews) and (c) studies with less than
30 patients. The final list of studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed by all authors.
Data extraction and quality verification
The data were extracted by using a predefined form.
The following data were extracted: (a) author, journal,
and year of publication; (b) number of subjects; (c) cause
of disease; (d) average age and gender; (e) data related to
disease staging by SWE and liver biopsy and (f) data to
calculate the number of true positive, false positive, true
negative and false negative. Data quality was assessed by
using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic
Accuracy (QUADAS)-2 tool [20]. Disagreements were
resolved by discussion between the investigators.
Statistical analysis
Meta-DiSc 1.4 (http://www.hrc.es/investigacion/metadisc_en.
htm), a software for meta-analysis of test accuracy was used
to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio
(DOR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and to
analyze summary receiver operating characteristic curves
(SROC) and the area under curve (AUC) [21, 22]. Forrest
plots of sensitivities and specificities were constructed of the
accuracy of SWE assessment of fibrosis. ROC plots of DOR
was performed to determine threshold effect. χ2 –test and
Cochrane-Q were used to determine the heterogeneity of
DOR. If inconsistency (I2
) ≥ 25%, and P < 0.05, DOR was
considered heterogeneous, and random effect mode was
chosen. Otherwise, fixed effect mode was chosen.
Results
Study search
Two hundred and fifty-five Chinese paper and 388 English
paper were revealed in the preliminary search. Duplicate
articles were removed, and a list of 528 articles was collected in a single electronic library. After a detailed manual review, 11 articles met the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. A flow diagram according to PRISMA guidelines
of studies included is shown in Fig. 1. All studies included
in the meta-analysis fulfilled four or more of the seven categories of the QUADAS-2 tool [20]. Baseline characteristics of included studies are shown in Table 1. The 11
articles which reported SWE-based fibrosis assessment
were included for meta-analysis, were conducted in the
United States, Italy, China, Korea, Japan, France, Romania
and Turkey. There were 1560 patients aged between 12 to
82 years. The etiology of diseases was categorized as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and others.

The METAVIR scoring system was used to classify the
disease severity, which was between F2 and F4. Among
the studies, 11, 8 and 9 reported diagnostic value of SWE in
patients with ≥ F2, ≥ F3 and ≥ F4, respectively. It should be
mentioned that in the study conducted by Beland et al., the
liver stiffness was measured in kPa on an ultrasound machine and converted to m/s by using a conversion formula
[32] . The cut-off values of various etiologies are summarized in Table 2. Chronic viral liver diseases appeared to
have lower cutoff values as compared with non-viral liver
diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while
autoimmune liver disease had high cut-off value (Table 2).
Meta-analysis
Due to insufficient number of study (four out of 11 included
studies) and number of patients (56 patients), studies that reported patients at the hepatic fibrosis stage of F0 to F1 were
considered inappropriate for meta-analysis. I2 in ≥ F2, ≥ F3
and ≥ F4 groups were 73.0, 76.4 and 65.1% (Fig. 2), respectively, indicating that there were non-threshold effects in all
three groups and could be analyzed by as random effect
mode. The combined DOR of ≥ F2, ≥ F3 and ≥ F3 were
30.81 (95% CI: 16.55–57.34); 41.45 (95% CI: 18.25–94.45);
and 67.18 (95% CI: 30.03–150.31) (Fig. 2). The sensitivity
and specificity of DOR of ≥ F2, ≥ F3 and ≥ F3 groups were
0.85 (95% CI: 0.82–0.87) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76–0.82); 0.87
(95% CI: 0.84–0.91) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.87); and 0.88
(95% CI: 0.83–0.91) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.92), respectively. The AUC of DOR were 0.920, 0.922 and 0.952 in ≥ F2,
≥ F3 and ≥ F4 group, respectively (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Our study shows SWE has high sensitivity and specificity
to detecting and staging hepatic fibrosis in patients with ≥
F2 Metavir-score. The AUC of DOR in these patients are
all over 0.92, suggesting that it has higher diagnostic
values. There are several advantages of this method. Studies showed that it has excellent intraobserver and interobserver error, intraclass correlation coeffiients in three
different sections of the liver ranged from 0.86 to 0.98,
and the 95% confidence interval ranged from 0.71 to 0.99,
suggesting the technique is highly reproducible [23, 26].

An non-invasive procedure, it is very suitable for detecting
therapeutic outcome after operations, such as liver transplantation [33] and can be used for screening and subsequent management of liver diseases, particularly for
children [34]. Other advantages of this method include determining therapeutic response, and monitoring age-related
changes, including sarcopenia and clinical frailty syndrome.
For example, the therapeutic outcome of Entecavir for
chronic hepatitis B may be assessed using 2D-SWE to determine the change in stiffness of liver over a long term
period to better treatment management and prognosis [35].
By quantifying mechanical and elastic tissue properties,
SWE complements the diagnosis obtained at gray-scale (Bmode) US and power and color Doppler US [36].
The studies included in this analysis has high heterogeneity due to non-threshold effect. The main causes of heterogeneity were the etiology of liver fibrosis in the patients,
which might result from infection of various hepatitis virus
and fatty liver. Previous studies have shown that different
causes of liver fibrosis may lead to different elastic threshold value for F2 or cirrhosis in TE-based assessment of fibrosis [37]. For liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C, the liver
stiffness values were found to increase in parallel with degree of liver fibrosis when assessed with SWE and SWE
was more accurate than TE in assessing significant fibrosis
(≥ F2) [23]. SWE has the advantage of imaging liver stiffness in real time while guided by a B-mode image. Thus,
the region of measurement can be guided with both anatomical and tissue stiffness information.
In this study, we analyzed 11 studies that met with inclusion criteria and found that the AUC was over 90%
for fibrosis at F2, F3 and F4 stages, indicating that SWE
is accurate to assess fibrosis at different stage.
The earliest technique FibroScan (FibroScan; Echosens, Paris, France) used in clinical assessment of liver
elastic modulus is TE developed by Echosen. It is based
on the measurement of the propagation velocity of shear
waves in liver tissue and is noninvasive, quantitative and
real-time technique to assess the degree of liver fibrosis.
However, it is a one-dimensional imaging technology
and needs special mechanical vibrating device to generate shear wave, and cannot be used for patients with ascites, obesity and stenosed rib space stenosis [38]. It
cannot take two-dimensional images to avoid the nontarget structure in the liver [7, 39]. SWE is a newer elastic imaging technology which is a newer variant of RTE
[40]. Different from earlier technology, it uses shearwave and does not need to compress and decompress
the tissues to generate strain [41]. The shear waves are
generated using acoustic radiation force automatically
induced by the supersonic speed. This technique allows
the measurement of the propagation speed of shear
waves within tissues in meters per second (m/s) to locally quantify tissue stiffness (Young’s modulus) in kilopascals (KPa) and is less operator-dependent [42, 43].
2D SWE is based on ultra-fast ultrasound tracking technology and Young’s modulus formula to display elastic
images in real time and show the stiffness of the tissue
with different color. It can avoid the inference from the
structure of intrahepatic ducts to quantitatively assess
the elastic modulus of liver tissue to quantify the stiffness of liver tissue hardness value, thus effectively increasing the accuracy of assessment and having broad
clinical applications [44, 45]. On other side, RTE, also a
noninvasive diagnostic technique that examines the stiffness and hardness of tissue, is mainly used to assess
superficial tissues, such as neck, prostate, breast, and
thyroid, by testing the elasticity [46, 47].
Our analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity (88%)
and specificity (91%) of SWE in detecting and staging
early cirrhosis (F1) are similar to those of TE [37, 48],
acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) [49] and RTE
[50, 51], those sensitivity and specificity are 83 and 89%,
87 and 87%, 74 and 84%, respectively. ARFI is very similar to SWE, which targets an anatomic region to be interrogated for elastic properties with a Region-ofInterest (ROI) cursor [52]. However, for significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), the overall sensitivity and specificity of SWE
are greater than these of TE and RTE, and similar to
these of ARF. For TE and RTE, the combined sensitivity
is 79% and the combined specificity is 78 and 76%, respectively; while for ARFI [49], the combined sensitivity
and specificity are 74 and 83%. Clinically, the differentiation of nonadvanced (F0 and F1) and advanced (F2–F4)
fibrosis is particularly relevant in HCV hepatitis C virus,
where advanced fibrosis at the time of diagnosis has
been shown to correlate with long-term cirrhosis risk,
because once diagnosed as significant hepatic fibrosis
(F ≥ 2), these patients have high risks to develop cirrhosis
[53–55]. In this aspect, SWE may fill an important gap
[56]. In addition, ultrasonic elasticity technologies, such
as ARFI and TE, have some limitations and their measurements are affected by tissue inflammation and steatosis, which do not affect the SWE assessment of liver

fibrosis [9]. For example, TE is adequate for a diagnosis
of cirrhosis, but its accuracy for milder stages of fibrosis
is much less satisfactory. ARFI was not associated with
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), body mass index, Metavir grade, and liver steatosis. On other hand, TE was significantly correlated with the ALT value [57], but the
accuracy of ARFI was influenced by sex, interquartile
range interval, high alanine aminotransferases and high
aspartate aminotransferases levels [58].
There are a number of factors that would affect the
evaluation performance for the liver stiffness by SWE,
such as the number of measurements, liver volumes, patient’s conditions such as overweight or obesity or other
complications as well as the fibrosis stage and experience
of operators [25, 27]. It is generally agreed that three
measurements are sufficient to obtain consistent results
for assessing liver fibrosis [11]. However, more measurements help reducing unreliable measurements [10]. The
fibrosis stage, GGT and serum albumin are shown to
significantly influence the stiffness measurement [31], although use of different equipment and working methodologies in different studies make it difficult to compare
these influences [30]. The causes of chronic liver disease
are also important factor that influence the liver stiffness. For example, the cutoff points for ≥ F1 in patients
with chronic nonviral hepatitis (alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and chronic viral hepatitis (B)
were 6.5 kPa and 6.8 kPa, respectively [25, 27]. On other
hand, as shown in Table 2, fibrosis etiologies such as
HCV or HBV infections give similar SWE performances,
while nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune
liver disease generate high liver stiffness. Although included studies did not report the influence of liver viscosity on the results of SWE, Deffieux et al. reported a
correlated between viscosity and the degree of liver fibrosis, but not with steatosis or disease activity [59]. In
addition, older age and higher BMI were associated with
impossibility to obtain reliable measurements [25]. As
such, quality criteria for 2D-SWE is very important to
obtain reliable measurement. For example, Yoon et al.
used a value of less than 0.3 for standard deviation/mean
2D-SWE value to control the measurement quality [60].
Age appears an important factors affecting the measurement and children are found to have higher cutoff value
for liver fibrosis [24]. This, however, may be due to the
difference in the etiology of chronic liver disease between children and adult population.
The cutoff values for the diagnosis of fibrosis were reported in some of the included studies (Table 2). Although the values increase generally with increased
fibrosis stage, they are slightly different among the studies even the etiology is the same. For example, Zeng
et al. reported that cutoff (kPa) for F2. F3 and F4 fibrosis
stage were 7.2, 9.1 and 11.7 for chronic hepatitis Binduced liver fibrosis [31], while Guibal et al. found that
these values were 8.8, 11.5 and 18.1 [28]. For children,
the cut-off value could be even higher (10.6 kPa) [30]. It
is likely that the machines and methodologies used in
SWE would impact the cut-off value, as well as the site
of measurement [9]. Therefore, it is important to develop institute-specific standard for SWE-based diagnosis for liver fibrosis.
Limitations of our study included inhomogeneity
owing to causes of disease, small numbers of studies included. Studies with F0-F1 were not included due to insufficient data availability. In addition, not all subjects
underwent biochemical hepatic tests and viral marker
assessments for verification of etiology.
Conclusion
Our study has shown that SWE is accurate in diagnosing
significant, advanced fibrosis and early cirrhosis of the
liver. However, since liver fibrosis has various etiology
which may generate different liver stiffness as discussed
above, the diagnosis cutoff threshold need to be adjusted
case by case based on other information, such as laboratory assessment of the cause of the disease. Due to the
limited number of studies included in this study, there is
a need to further investigate the relationship between
tissue elasticity and liver fibrosis severity.
