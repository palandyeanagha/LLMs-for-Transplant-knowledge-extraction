Criteria for inclusion in the Health Technology Assessment journal
Reports are published in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme, and (2) they 
are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the reviewers and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search appraisal and synthesis methods (to 
minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review by others.
HTA programme
The HTA programme, part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), was set up in 1993. It produces high-quality research 
information on the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS. 
‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation 
and long-term care.
The journal is indexed in NHS Evidence via its abstracts included in MEDLINE and its Technology Assessment Reports inform National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. HTA research is also an important source of evidence for National Screening Committee (NSC) 
policy decisions.

Abstract
Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring (E-Entropy, Bispectral Index and 
Narcotrend): a systematic review and economic evaluation

Background: It is important that the level of general anaesthesia (GA) is appropriate for the individual 
patient undergoing surgery. If anaesthesia is deeper than required to keep a patient unconscious, there 
might be increased risk of anaesthetic-related morbidity, such as postoperative nausea, vomiting and 
cognitive dysfunction. This may also prolong recovery times, potentially increasing health-care costs. If 
anaesthesia is too light, patients may not be fully unconscious and could be at risk of 
intraoperative awareness.
Objective: The objective of this report is to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend technologies, each compared with standard clinical 
monitoring, to monitor the depth of anaesthesia in surgical patients undergoing GA.
Data sources: A search strategy was developed and run on a number of bibliographic electronic 
databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Health Technology Assessment 
(HTA) database. For the systematic review of patient outcomes, databases were searched from the 
beginning of 2009 to November 2011 for studies of BIS (and then updated in February 2012), and from 
1995 to November 2011 (and then updated in February 2012) for studies of E-Entropy and Narcotrend. 
For the systematic review of cost-effectiveness, searches were from database inception to November 2011 
(an update search was performed in February 2012).
Review methods: The systematic review of patient outcomes followed standard methodology for 
evidence synthesis. A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring compared with standard clinical observation. A simple decision tree was 
developed, which accounted for patients’ risk of experiencing short-term anaesthetic-related complications 
in addition to risk of experiencing intraoperative awareness.
Results: Twenty-two randomised controlled trials comparing BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend with standard 
clinical monitoring were included in the systematic review of patient outcomes, alongside evidence from a 
recent Cochrane review. Six trials of patients classified with risk factors for intraoperative awareness were 
combined in a fixed-effect meta-analysis. The overall pooled Peto’s odds ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence 
interval 0.25 to 0.81) in favour of BIS. However, there was statistically significant heterogeneity. The basecase cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for BIS compared with standard clinical monitoring ranged 
from £22,339 to £44,198 depending on patient subgroups (type of GA received; level of risk for 
awareness). For E-Entropy, base-case estimates ranged from £14,421 to £31,430. For Narcotrend, 
estimates varied from a cost per QALY of £8033 to Narcotrend dominating standard clinical monitoring.

Abstract

Limitations: The analysis was limited by lack of clinical effectiveness data, particularly for E-Entropy 
and Narcotrend.
Conclusions: The available evidence on the impact of the technologies on reducing the likelihood of 
intraoperative awareness is limited. However, there were reductions in general anaesthetic consumption 
and anaesthetic recovery times. The cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to be 
highly dependent on a number of factors, including probability of awareness.

Scientific summary
Background
It is important that the level of general anaesthesia (GA) is appropriate for the individual patient 
undergoing surgery. If anaesthesia is deeper than required to keep a patient unconscious, there might 
be increased risk of anaesthetic-related morbidity, such as postoperative nausea, vomiting and cognitive 
dysfunction. If anaesthesia is too light, patients may not be fully unconscious and could be at risk of 
intraoperative awareness. Intraoperative awareness is a relatively rare event with an incidence typically of 
around one to two patients per 1000. However, over time, awareness may cause depression, anxiety and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
During GA, patients are routinely monitored for signs of potential intraoperative awareness, including 
tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension, sweating, lacrimation (tear production), movement/grimacing 
and tachypnoea (rapid breathing). In patients receiving inhaled GA, end-tidal (exhaled) anaesthetic gas 
concentrations may be assessed to gauge depth of anaesthesia. However, clinical observation alone may 
not be a reliable surrogate marker of depth of anaesthesia. Technologies have been developed using 
electroencephalography (EEG) to measure and interpret electrical activity in the brain to provide a measure 
of unconsciousness. Most devices comprise a module that collects raw EEG data via sensors placed on the 
patient’s forehead and then processes and analyses these using a mathematical algorithm. The output is 
then displayed numerically on a monitor for use by the anaesthetist to judge depth of unconsciousness, 
and to alter anaesthetic dose accordingly. Three such devices prioritised for this report are Bispectral Index 
(BIS), E-Entropy and Narcotrend.
Objectives
The objective of this report is to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BIS, E-Entropy 
and Narcotrend technologies to monitor the depth of anaesthesia in surgical patients undergoing GA.
Methods
Systematic review of patient outcomes
A systematic review of patient outcomes associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring was conducted. 
A search strategy was developed and run on eight bibliographic electronic databases. Reference lists 
supplied by the device manufacturers were checked to identify potentially relevant studies. Eligibility 
criteria were applied to titles and abstracts and to full papers by two reviewers independently. Because of 
the relatively large volume of evidence for BIS, we included only trials that were supplemental to a recent 
Cochrane systematic review of BIS. Included studies were data extracted using a standard template. Risk 
of bias and markers of quality were assessed. The studies were synthesised narratively, with meta-analyses 
from the Cochrane review of BIS updated with supplemental studies where feasible and appropriate.
Systematic review of cost-effectiveness
A systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring 
compared with standard clinical monitoring was undertaken. Included studies were evaluated for their 
quality and for generalisability to the UK. Eligibility criteria were applied to titles and abstracts and to full 
papers by two reviewers independently, and the studies were synthesised narratively.

Economic evaluation
A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring compared with standard clinical observation. A simple decision tree was developed, which 
accounted for patients’ risk of experiencing short-term anaesthetic-related complications in addition to a 
risk of experiencing intraoperative awareness.
It was assumed that a proportion of patients who experience awareness will suffer psychological 
symptoms and that a proportion of those will develop PTSD and may seek treatment. A systematic review 
of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in PTSD was undertaken in order to estimate the quality-of-life 
decrement to be applied as the result of any psychological symptoms arising from an awareness episode. 
The costs of depth of anaesthesia monitoring consist of the capital costs associated with acquisition of the 
monitor and recurring costs associated with sensors that are attached to the patient. Equivalent annual 
costs for each monitor were calculated for an effective equipment life of 5 years. Unit costs of anaesthetic 
drugs were derived from the British National Formulary (BNF) and supplied from an NHS Trust. The 
baseline incidence of awareness in high-risk patients was calculated from the control arms of randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) in this group of patients. The summary values of the effectiveness of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring were taken from our systematic review of patient outcomes.
The model evaluates costs [UK sterling (pounds) using a 2011 price base] from the perspective of the NHS 
and Personal Social Services. Outcomes in the model are expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Both costs and outcomes are discounted using a 3.5% annual discount rate, in line with current guidance.
Results
Systematic review of patient outcomes
From a total of 776 bibliographic records, 22 RCTs comparing BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend with 
standard clinical monitoring were included in the systematic review of patient outcomes. Fifteen trials of 
BIS, seven trials of E-Entropy and four trials of Narcotrend all compared with standard clinical monitoring. 
(Note that some trials compared more than one of the three devices to standard clinical monitoring.) Some 
of the trials reported that in the EEG arm anaesthesia doses were titrated according to device values in 
conjunction with clinical signs. In other trials the use of clinical signs alongside EEG monitoring was not 
explicit. The Cochrane review of BIS included 31 RCTs. The trials included in both reviews span the period 
between 1997 and 2011 in terms of publication date.
In many cases, the risk of bias in the trials was unclear because of limitations in reporting of 
methodological details. The trials varied in terms of their sample sizes, from as low as 20 to over 6000 
patients, but, in general, sample sizes were relatively small (e.g. fewer than 200). Fifteen of the trials in 
this systematic review and all of the trials in the Cochrane BIS review were conducted in adult patients, 
of varying mean ages. Seven of the trials in this review were conducted with children. The trials were 
generally single-centre studies conducted in a range of locations including Europe, North America 
and Asia.
Six trials were conducted with patients classified as having one or more risk factors for intraoperative 
awareness (e.g. planned cardiac surgery, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage lung disease), all of which 
evaluated BIS monitoring. The trials tended to exclude patients with significant ill health or factors that 
may interfere with EEG recordings.
Explicit intraoperative awareness was assessed in 16 of the trials, but in most of these no episodes were 
recorded. However, awareness is a relatively rare event and the trials were not statistically powered to 
detect it. The six trials of patients classified with risk factors for intraoperative awareness, all of which 
evaluated BIS, were combined in a fixed-effect meta-analysis. The overall pooled Peto’s odds ratio (OR) was 
0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.81] in favour of BIS.

Caution is advised in the interpretation of this result as, overall, there was statistically significant 
heterogeneity (p=0.009; I
2=79%). Both the subgroup of trials, which included a trial of mixed inhaled 
and intravenous anaesthesia, and the subgroup, which included trials of total intravenous anaesthesia 
(TIVA), statistically favoured BIS monitoring. However, in the subgroup of trials that used only inhaled 
anaesthesia, the Peto’s OR was 1.79 (95% CI 0.63 to 5.11), favouring standard clinical monitoring, 
although not statistically significant.
Systematic review of cost-effectiveness
A total of 134 potentially relevant references were identified by the cost-effectiveness searches. Of these, 
one study comparing BIS with standard clinical monitoring met all of the inclusion criteria. The study 
reported cost per avoided intraoperative recall, with the incidence of recall with BIS reported as 0.04% 
compared with 0.18% for standard monitoring, resulting in a cost per avoided recall of US$4410. The 
authors of the study concluded that BIS monitoring did not appear cost-effective. However, the results and 
conclusions should be viewed with caution because of poor methodological and reporting quality.
Economic evaluation
For each technology we presented a base-case analysis for two modes of anaesthetic administration 
{TIVA and mixed anaesthesia [induction with intravenous (i.v.) anaesthesia and maintenance with inhaled 
anaesthesia or a combination of inhaled and i.v. anaesthetic]} and for two patient populations (those 
considered at high risk of intraoperative awareness and a general surgical population, at average risk of 
intraoperative awareness).
Bispectral Index compared with standard clinical monitoring
In cohorts of 10,000 patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BIS compared with standard clinical monitoring in this 
population was £22,339.
For the population of general surgical patients undergoing GA with TIVA, BIS monitoring was modelled 
as being associated with 3.8 cases (per 10,000 patients) of awareness, compared with 16 in patients 
receiving standard clinical monitoring. Given the lower baseline risk of awareness in this population, the 
QALY gain with BIS monitoring was lower (0.0003) than for high-risk patients. This resulted in a higher 
ICER (£34,565).
Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the same input parameters as for 
the population at high risk of awareness.
The baseline estimates of awareness, late psychological symptoms (LPS) and PTSD for high-risk patients 
undergoing mixed GA were the same as for high-risk patients undergoing TIVA. However, given that the 
OR of awareness with BIS monitoring was higher in this analysis, the estimated reduction in LPS and PTSD 
was lower. The ICER for BIS compared with standard clinical monitoring in this population was £29,634.
The baseline estimates of awareness, LPS and PTSD in the population of general surgical patients 
undergoing mixed GA were the same as for TIVA. Although a proportion of the higher cost associated 
with BIS monitoring was offset by reduction in anaesthetic consumption, the cost-saving for inhaled 
anaesthesia was lower than for TIVA. As a result the incremental cost was greater. Given the lower baseline 
risk of awareness in this population, the QALY gain with BIS monitoring was lower (0.0003) than for highrisk patients, resulting in a higher ICER (£49,198).
Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to a number of parameters, 
including the baseline incidence of awareness and the effectiveness of BIS in reducing awareness.

E-Entropy compared with standard clinical monitoring
In patients at high risk of awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, the modelled cost per patient with 
E-Entropy monitoring was higher than with standard clinical monitoring, although some of the additional 
cost was offset by reduced cost associated with psychological sequelae of awareness. The ICER for 
E-Entropy compared with standard clinical monitoring in this population was £14,421.
In the population of general surgical patients undergoing GA with TIVA, E-Entropy monitoring had a 
higher cost per patient than standard clinical monitoring. There was no reduction in anaesthetic drug 
costs to offset the additional costs of E-Entropy monitoring. Given the lower baseline risk of awareness 
in this population, the QALY gain was lower than for high-risk patients, which resulted in a higher ICER 
(£31,131–31,430).
In patients considered at high risk of awareness undergoing mixed GA, E-Entropy monitoring had higher 
costs and improved outcomes compared with standard clinical monitoring. However, the QALY gain 
was lower than for patients undergoing TIVA. The ICER for E-Entropy compared with standard clinical 
monitoring in this population was £19,367.
In the population of general surgical patients undergoing mixed GA, E-Entropy monitoring had higher 
costs than standard clinical monitoring. In contrast with the analysis for TIVA, the clinical trial used to 
estimate inhaled anaesthetic drug consumption reported a substantial decrease (29%), which resulted 
in approximately half of the additional cost of E-Entropy monitoring being offset by a reduction in 
anaesthetic drug costs. Despite the lower baseline risk of awareness, which resulted in a lower QALY gain 
with E-Entropy monitoring than for high-risk patients, the lower incremental cost resulted in an equivalent 
ICER (£19,000).
Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to a number of parameters, 
including the baseline incidence of awareness and the effectiveness of E-Entropy in reducing awareness.
Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring
In patients at high risk of awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, the modelled cost per patient with 
Narcotrend monitoring was higher than with standard clinical monitoring, although some of the 
additional cost was offset by reduced cost associated with psychological sequelae of awareness. The ICER 
for Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring in this population was £5681. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to a number of parameters, including the baseline 
incidence of awareness and the effectiveness in reducing awareness.
In the general surgical population undergoing GA with TIVA, and also undergoing mixed GA, Narcotrend 
monitoring had a lower cost per patient than standard clinical monitoring. The additional cost of 
monitoring was more than offset by reduction in anaesthetic drug consumption. Given the lower baseline 
risk of awareness in this population, the QALY gain was lower than for high-risk patients. Narcotrend 
dominated standard clinical monitoring. Narcotrend remained dominant in the majority of deterministic 
sensitivity analyses.
In patients at high risk of awareness undergoing mixed GA, Narcotrend monitoring had higher costs and 
improved outcomes than standard clinical monitoring, although the QALY gain (0.0005) was lower than 
for patients undergoing TIVA. The ICER for Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring in this 
population was £8033. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the same 
parameters as for high-risk patients undergoing TIVA.

Conclusions
In general, BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend technologies for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia are 
associated with reductions in general anaesthetic consumption, and decreased anaesthetic recovery 
times, compared with monitoring of clinical signs alone. However, these reductions may be considered 
clinically modest. The available evidence on the impact of the technologies on reducing the likelihood of 
intraoperative awareness is limited. Overall, BIS was associated with a statistically significant reduction 
in intraoperative awareness in patients classified as at higher risk, although there is uncertainty in effect 
estimates because of significant heterogeneity. Caution is advised because of uncertainties about the risk of 
bias of many of the included trials, and because many outcome measures were not statistically powered.
The cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to be highly dependent on the 
incidence of awareness, the HRQoL impact of psychological sequelae of awareness and the probability of 
developing psychological illness following awareness, as well as the effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring in reducing awareness. Cost-savings resulting from reduced use of anaesthetic drugs may 
offset some of the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. The cost of sensors attached to the 
patient appears to be a key factor in the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring.
This report makes the following research recommendations (in priority order):
1. RCTs of E-Entropy- and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia monitoring are needed, in high-risk patients, 
with adequate statistical power to detect explicit intraoperative awareness, and of sufficient length of 
follow-up to detect delayed cases of awareness.
2. RCTs of all three technologies should also evaluate the effects of anaesthesia overdosing, including 
short-term effects, such as nausea and vomiting, as well as longer-term impact on cognitive function.
3. RCTs of E-Entropy- and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia monitoring are also needed in children.

Chapter 1 Background and definition of the 
decision problem
Condition and aetiology
Background
When patients undergo surgical procedures under general anaesthesia (GA) it is important that the 
depth of anaesthesia provided by the anaesthetist is neither too light nor too deep. If the depth is too 
light, patients may not be fully unconscious and may be at risk of intraoperative awareness, which may 
lead to longer-term postoperative sequelae such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the depth of 
anaesthesia is deeper than the minimum needed to keep a patient unconscious, the patient may be at risk 
of anaesthetic-related morbidity, which can include postoperative nausea, vomiting and varying degrees 
of cognitive dysfunction. Provision of lighter anaesthesia is more likely to facilitate prompt recovery, and 
therefore potential health-care savings, but has to be balanced against the risks of inadequate analgesia 
and intraoperative awareness. A challenge facing the anaesthetist is to avoid under- or overdosing the 
anaesthetic, as the response to anaesthetic agents varies among individuals.
A primary concern with inadequate depth of anaesthesia is that a patient may experience intraoperative 
awareness, which the patient may recall postoperatively (explicit awareness) or may not subsequently 
recall (implicit awareness).1 Although implicit awareness can exist without conscious recall, it may 
(or may not) influence patients’ experience and behaviours after anaesthesia. Conscious recall may 
underestimate instances of awareness, as people are generally aware of more things intraoperatively than 
they remember.2,3 Some authors have used ‘wakefulness’ as a term to describe the ability of a patient to 
respond to a command during GA without recollection of this in the postoperative period.4 Examples of 
intraoperative events that have been classed as awareness by researchers but which were not recalled 
by patients when questioned after their surgery, include eye opening and gross motor responses during 
anaesthesia.2,3
Awareness symptoms and sequelae
Intraoperative awareness is commonly reported by patients as hearing noises or voices, a sensation of 
paralysis, anxiety, helplessness, panic and/or pain during their operation.5,6 Some patients may report 
intraoperative awareness when interviewed in the recovery room, but many patients do not recall 
intraoperative awareness until several weeks after surgery.7,8 Patients who experience intraoperative 
awareness may go on to experience problems including sleep disturbances, nightmares, flashbacks, 
anxiety during the day and/or fear about future anaesthetics,5,7,9 and may be diagnosed with PTSD.5,6,8,10
Some patients who have experienced symptoms following awareness will not seek treatment because 
the episode was so traumatic that they do not wish to discuss it, particularly if they have subsequently 
developed a phobia of medical personnel.
Studies that have followed up patients with intraoperative awareness for 2 years11 or 5 years8
 estimated 
that around half of the patients with intraoperative awareness experienced PTSD. In these patients, the 
PTSD was not detectable immediately after surgery, but commenced several weeks afterwards, and then 
persisted throughout the follow-up period. The findings from these studies highlight the importance 
of conducting long-term follow-up of patients who might be at risk of intraoperative awareness, and 
emphasise that interviews to detect intraoperative awareness within the first few days of surgery may not 
detect either intraoperative awareness or sequelae including PTSD.

Incidence of intraoperative awareness
Intraoperative awareness is a rare event, so large studies are needed in order to accurately estimate the 
incidence. Large studies (with sample size of at least 10,000 patients) have not been conducted in the 
UK. Large studies in other countries, which have all been based on adult populations, suggest that the 
incidence rate for intraoperative awareness and recall is typically one to two patients per 1000, although 
a considerably lower incidence of 0.07 per 1000 patients was found in the largest study14 which included 
over 87,000 patients, whereas a higher incidence of 4.1 per 1000 patients was found in a Chinese study15
(Table 1).
Differences in incidence estimates between these studies might be explained by variations in data collection 
methods, the frequency and timing of interviews, or the characteristics of the patient populations and 
surgical procedures included.14 The notably high incidence of intraoperative awareness in the Chinese study 
was considered by the authors to be possibly attributable to differences between Chinese and Western 
medical practices, including inappropriately light anaesthesia in the Chinese population.15
Risk factors for intraoperative awareness
Some groups of patients undergoing GA are at increased risk of intraoperative awareness because they 
cannot tolerate adequate doses of anaesthetic or because signs of inadequate anaesthesia are masked 
or because, owing to the nature of the patient’s condition and the surgery, higher doses of anaesthetic 
were considered to be risky.7,16 For example, patients undergoing procedures such as caesarean section 
were often given lower anaesthetic doses because of concerns over adverse fetal effects. However, most 
caesarean sections are now performed under regional anaesthesia (epidural or spinal) rather than under 
GA. Similarly, patients undergoing cardiac surgery were given lower doses because of concerns over 
adverse effects on their circulation. However, modern anaesthetic agents and improved treatment of 
haemodynamic effects have lessened the risks.17
Use of muscle relaxant drugs (e.g. to facilitate tracheal extubation) is an important risk factor for 
intraoperative awareness because it permits the use of less anaesthetic while at the same time preventing 
patients’ movement responses that could signal inadequacy of anaesthesia to the anaesthetist, potentially 
allowing anaesthetic insufficiency to remain uncorrected. Some patients who have received muscle 
relaxants (and are therefore paralysed) have reported feelings of impending doom and death while 
experiencing intraoperative awareness, and have suffered long-term psychological ill health. Around half of 
all operations under GA involve the use of muscle relaxants.
Other risk factors for intraoperative awareness that have been identified include a high American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (indicating worse illness);13,14 use of total intravenous 
anaesthesia (TIVA);18 history of depression;6 lack of benzodiazepine premedication;18 and emergency 
surgery performed at night.18

Impact of intraoperative awareness
Patients who experienced severe long-term psychological or psychiatric symptoms following intraoperative 
awareness have reported that the symptoms caused a definite impairment of their lives.11 For example, it 
may limit their ability to work, and have an adverse effect on relationships with family and friends. Patients 
with less severe symptoms of intraoperative awareness frequently experience a sense of dissatisfaction with 
their anaesthetic experience.12 Such patients may be at risk of avoiding certain health-care procedures if 
they feel anxious or if they mistrust health professionals as a result of their previous experience.
Aside from the cost of managing the sequelae of intraoperative awareness, the NHS could be at risk 
of professional liability claims from those who have experienced intraoperative awareness.19 However, 
the psychological trauma experienced by some people may be so great that they may be discouraged 
from reporting intraoperative awareness because they do not want to discuss it. The incidence of 
explicit awareness may therefore be underestimated. High-profile cases of intraoperative awareness 
in the media may influence public perceptions of the safety of anaesthetic procedures, which could 
influence how patients perceive information and services provided to them by the NHS. Some patients 
who have experienced intraoperative awareness have developed a fear of anaesthesia, which, in the 
event that further anaesthesia is required, could have implications for their acceptance or tolerance of 
subsequent care.
Measurement of intraoperative awareness
Basic signs of intraoperative awareness during anaesthesia include tachycardia (rapid heart rate), 
hypertension, sweating, lacrimation (tear production), movement/grimacing and tachypnoea 
(rapid breathing). Intermittent checking of these clinical signs has low sensitivity and specificity 
for detecting awareness.20,21 Cases of intraoperative awareness do not always involve changes in 
haemodynamic parameters.22
Tests of intraoperative awareness may seek to identify awareness in situ, often using verbal, tactile or 
noxious stimulation,1,2 and/or by interviewing the patient after surgery to establish whether or not they 
recall having been aware during the period of anaesthesia. During surgery the isolated forearm technique 
is one of the methods of detecting possible awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular 
blockade. A tourniquet is applied to the patient’s upper arm, and inflated above systolic blood pressure 
to isolate the patient’s forearm from the effects of the block. Movement of the arm, either spontaneously 
or to command, indicates wakefulness, although not necessarily explicit awareness. The isolated forearm 
technique has not been widely used in practice, though it has been used as a research tool in a number 
of studies.21,23
The most popular approach for postoperative assessment of awareness (as illustrated in Table 1) is to 
question patients using a version of the Brice interview.24 The Brice interview poses five questions: (1) What 
was the last thing you remembered happening before you went to sleep? (2) What was the first thing 
you remember happening on waking? (3) Did you dream or have any other experiences while you were 
asleep? (4) What was the worst thing about your operation? (5) What was the next worst? In addition to 
an interview to detect intraoperative awareness, some studies have used a second interview (sometimes 
referred to as a follow-up questionnaire) to characterise the awareness episodes in more detail.25,26 In some 
studies, independent expert verification of interview responses has been used to determine definite cases 
of awareness.27
Studies that report using modified versions of the Brice interview have to be interpreted with caution, 
as there may be considerable variation in the number of questions, their content and extent of overlap 
with the original Brice interview. None of the studies has looked into the psychometric properties of the 
interview questionnaires that it used, so their reliability and validity could be questionable. As noted above, 
not all cases of awareness would be detected if interviews are conducted immediately after surgery with a 
single interview,9
 as recall of intraoperative awareness has been reported up to 19 years after the event.5
Other issues to consider when interpreting postoperative interviews are: repeated questioning may induce

false memories,3,27 and three of the five Brice questions are about pre or post surgery or dreaming, which 
would not specifically reveal remembrance of an intraoperative awareness event.28 The interview approach 
to assessing awareness with recall has also been criticised because it cannot assess awareness without 
recall, even though this may include implicit memory (i.e. still impact on postoperative patient experience 
or behaviour).
As noted above, awareness without explicit recall can be assessed using specialist interview approaches,29
but these appear to be rarely used and have been restricted to experimental research settings. It is 
not known whether or not changes in behaviour as a result of implicit awareness are associated with 
longer-term morbidity.
Consequences of anaesthesia overdose
It is suggested that anaesthetists tend to provide higher doses of anaesthetic than may be necessary, 
in order to reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness.23 Potential consequences of anaesthesia 
overdose include prolonged recovery time (which in severe cases may lead to potentially life-threatening 
cardiovascular and respiratory collapse), vomiting, headaches, dizziness and, less commonly, short- or 
long-term cognitive dysfunction, particularly in elderly patients.30
Outcomes relevant to assessing the consequences of anaesthesia overdose include postoperative nausea 
and vomiting (PONV) assessed using patient questionnaires or rating scales; assessments of time to 
recovery from anaesthesia using various measures (e.g. the time to extubation, eye opening, purposeful 
movement, discharge from the operating theatre or the recovery room or time to attain a specified 
recovery score); consumption of general anaesthetic or other drugs (such as analgesics and antinausea 
agents); and assessment of cognitive or neurological function.
Description of technologies under assessment
The depth of anaesthesia and likelihood of awareness may be monitored using a number of different 
approaches. As mentioned, potential awareness may be identified by monitoring of basic clinical signs 
such as blood pressure and heart rate (for more information see Comparators). Other techniques which 
have been used, but are considered historical, include spontaneous and provoked lower oesophageal 
sphincter contractility, forehead galvanometry and saccadic eye movements.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the study of patient electrical brain activity to assess unconsciousness. 
During the last 15–20 years a number of EEG-based technologies have become commercially available for 
measuring depth of anaesthesia and for use in guiding anaesthetic management during surgery. Most 
comprise a module that collects raw EEG data via sensors placed on the patient’s forehead and then 
processes and analyses these using a mathematical algorithm. Raw EEG signals can be difficult to interpret; 
therefore, many modules convert the signal to a number displayed on a monitor to indicate to the 
anaesthetist the depth of unconsciousness (e.g. from 0 to 99). EEG can be distinguished as spontaneous 
or derived from middle latency evoked potentials (auditory and visual). Evoked potentials measure the EEG 
responses to repetitive auditory or visual stimuli, and measure the integrity of the neural pathways that 
bring information from the periphery to the cortex.21 A number of EEG-derived indexes have been devised 
based on different algorithms,23 including the Bispectral Index (BIS), E-Entropy, Narcotrend, Cerebral State 
Index, the Patient State Index and NeuroSENSE.
In practice, EEG devices can be used in conjunction with observation of clinical signs to titrate anaesthetic 
dose (see the section Comparators). Expert opinion suggests that anaesthetists primarily use clinical signs 
with EEG values as an additional source of information. If there is a difference between them then the 
anaesthetist will usually favour the clinical signs and their judgement.

After consultation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) with relevant 
stakeholders, three of the technologies currently available were prioritised for the current assessment: the 
BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend.
Bispectral Index (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA)
The BIS system, introduced in 1994, uses a sensor on the patient’s forehead to measure electrical activity 
in the brain before using proprietary algorithmic analysis to process the EEG data and calculate a number 
between 0 (absence of brain electrical activity) and 100 (wide awake). This provides a measure of cerebral 
electrical response to increasing doses of anaesthetic drugs. The target range of BIS values during GA is 
40–60, which indicates a low probability of consciousness.
Bispectral Index technology is compatible with a wide range of patient monitoring platforms through 
an interface for ‘BIS Ready’ systems [such as those manufactured by Mennen Medical Corporation, 
Feasterville-Trejose, PA, USA (e.g. VitaLogik series monitors); Philips Healthcare, Da Best, the Netherlands 
(e.g. IntelliVue series monitors); and Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA, USA (e.g. Infinity series 
monitors). This works via the BISx or BISx4 plug-in connector, which allows integration with existing 
anaesthesia systems.
E-Entropy module (GE Healthcare, Medical Diagnostics, Amersham, UK)
Entropy monitoring in anaesthesia has been studied over the last 10 years. E-Entropy (previously known 
as M-Entropy) is designed to aid the management of GA in patients by measuring the level of order or 
disorder in spontaneous brain and frontalis muscular activity. It uses a proprietary algorithm to process 
EEG and frontal electromyography data to produce two values that indicate the depth of anaesthesia. The 
first value, response entropy, is based on both EEG and frontal electromyography signals and provides 
an indication of the patient’s responses to external stimuli and may signal early awakening. The second 
value, state entropy, is a stable parameter based on EEG and may be used to assess the hypnotic effect 
of anaesthetic agents on the brain. Response entropy is always higher than or equal to the state entropy 
value. The response entropy–state entropy difference may be used as a secondary target value when 
monitoring depth of anaesthesia.
More ordered signals, with less variation in the wavelength and amplitude, over time, produce high 
values of entropy and may indicate that the patient is awake. Regular signals, with a constant wavelength 
and amplitude over time, produce low or zero entropy values, indicating a low probability of recall and 
suppression of brain electrical activity. The response entropy scale ranges from 0 (no brain activity) to 100 
(fully awake) and the state entropy scale ranges from 0 (no brain activity) to 91 (fully awake). The clinically 
relevant target range for entropy values is 40–60. Response entropy and state entropy values near 40 
indicate a low probability of consciousness.
E-Entropy is a plug-in module that is compatible with the Ohmeda S/5 Anaesthesia monitor and S/5 
Compact Anaesthesia monitor using software L-ANE03(A) and L-CANE03(A), and all subsequent software 
releases since 2003. The module will not work with software levels that are older than indicated. It is also 
compatible with GE Healthcare’s latest monitoring product range (CARESCAPE Monitors B850 and B650), 
but is incompatible with monitors made by other manufacturers.
Narcotrend monitor (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany)
The Narcotrend monitor automatically analyses the raw EEG using spectral analysis to produce a number 
of parameters. Multivariate statistical methods using proprietary pattern recognition algorithms are then 
applied to these parameters to provide an automatically classified EEG. The basis for the development 
of the automatic classification functions were visually classified EEG. The EEG visual classification scale 
is from stage A (awake) to stage F (very deep hypnosis), with stage E indicating the appropriate depth 
of anaesthesia for surgery. As a refinement to the A–F scale, an EEG index (100=awake, 0=very deep 
hypnosis) is also calculated.

Background and definition of the decision problem
6
The Narcotrend-Compact M is a stand-alone monitor that stores recorded EEG data on its hard disk and 
can send raw and processed EEG data in real time to other anaesthesia monitors. Data can also be saved 
to a USB flash drive for processing and evaluation of Narcotrend EEG recordings on a remote PC using the 
software NarcoWin. The Narcotrend algorithms are revised continually.
Subgroups of patients
Unsuitable patient populations include those undergoing specific surgical procedures in which the 
sensors would impede access to the surgical site, and therefore certain ENT, ophthalmic and neurosurgical 
procedures may be unsuitable for EEG monitoring. In neonates the immature EEG has resulted in 
inconsistent linkages between anaesthetic dosing and displayed BIS values, and an inability to demonstrate 
a titration potential for BIS-guided anaesthesia care. The manufacturer of BIS recommends that BIS 
values should be interpreted cautiously in patients with known neurological disorders and patients taking 
psychoactive medications. E-Entropy is validated only for patients over the age of 2 years; it is not for 
patients undergoing procedural or conscious sedation, and seizure activity may cause interference. In 
addition, E-Entropy readings may be inconsistent when monitoring patients with neurological disorders or 
patients on psychoactive medication. Limited information is available for subgroups of patients for whom 
Narcotrend may not be suitable, although Narcotrend values should be interpreted cautiously in patients 
with a history of central nervous system diseases.
Artefacts
All EEG monitoring is subject to contamination by artefacts generated either by the patient (e.g. by eye 
movements, muscle activity) or from external sources (poor skin contact, mains or power line interference, 
electrocautery). With the BIS system most artefacts present as elevated BIS values and the recommended 
strategy from the manufacturer for an unexpected elevated BIS value is prompt patient assessment, 
confirmation of anaesthetic dosing and delivery, and consideration of artefacts. Narcotrend is equipped 
with artefact detection algorithms to exclude segments contaminated with artefact from further analysis. 
If too many artefacts are detected, no classification result will be output and only raw EEG will be 
visible onscreen.
Current usage in the UK
Expert opinion suggests that there is low use of EEG in practice to monitor depth of anaesthesia. Current 
penetration of BIS technology in UK operating theatres is still relatively low but, as most anaesthetic 
monitors used in the UK could be compatible with the BIS module, BIS technology could be available in 
the majority of UK operating theatres. The manufacturers of E-Entropy in their submission to NICE estimate 
that nearly 45% of UK theatres would be ready and compatible with E-Entropy and ‘believe our theatre 
installed base to be around 60 to 65% of UK theatres’. No data are available on the provision or diffusion 
of Narcotrend in the UK. (Commercial-in-confidence information removed.)
Training
It appears that little additional training in the use of these technologies is needed. The manufacturer 
states that no specific additional training is required to use the BIS monitoring system (although expert 
clinical opinion disputes this). Instructions for use are provided with both the BIS device (stand-alone or 
module) as well as the BIS sensors and are regarded as sufficient guidance by the manufacturer for safe 
and effective use. Additional educational resources are provided by the manufacturer if necessary, such 
as simulation devices and online multimedia courses. For E-Entropy, 30 minutes of introductory training 
is suggested for health-care staff before use, with particular attention being paid to sensor application. A 
1-day visit from staff to give a lecture and to demonstrate the use of Narcotrend in the operating theatre is 
judged sufficient training by the manufacturer for the majority of Narcotrend users.

Comparators
A number of clinical signs that are routinely monitored during anaesthesia can be used to assess potential 
awareness. Prior to induction of anaesthesia a variety of monitoring devices may be attached to the 
patient, including a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels); a non-invasive blood pressure monitor; an 
electrocardiograph (to measure heart rate); and a capnograph (to measure inhaled and exhaled carbon 
dioxide concentration). Devices are also used to measure airway pressure and the patient’s temperature. 
Other markers of awareness that are monitored include movement, lacrimation and sweating.
End-tidal anaesthetic gas concentrations (ETACs) may be used to assess the concentration of volatile 
(inhaled) anaesthetic in a patient, expressed as a percentage. ETAC can be used to calculate the minimum 
alveolar concentration (MAC), which is the minimum concentration of anaesthetic agent in the lungs at 
one atmosphere pressure that is required to prevent movement in 50% of individuals when exposed to 
a standard painful stimulus. MAC provides a measure of the potency for comparison between different 
inhaled general anaesthetics (see Care pathways), and anaesthesia can be titrated to keep within a certain 
MAC range.
Of all the signs and variables, the key things to observe are ETAC (where inhaled anaesthetics have been 
used), blood pressure and heart rate. However, in practice, the combination of signs that are used is likely 
to vary.31
Care pathways
In UK health-care settings, GA is usually administered in an anaesthetic room32 (sometimes referred to as 
the induction room), following which the patient is transferred to the operating theatre. Monitoring of 
clinical signs always commences prior to administration of GA, and continues until surgery is complete 
and the patient is moved from the theatre to the recovery room (also referred to as the postanaesthesia 
care unit, PACU), or to intensive care or a high-dependency unit if applicable. Supplementary monitoring 
devices such as EEG-based technologies may also be attached during anaesthesia induction and continued 
until surgery is complete, anaesthesia has ceased and the patient has entered the recovery phase.
General anaesthetics are generally classified as intravenous (i.v.) or inhalational. Propofol is a commonly 
used i.v. anaesthetic and can be used for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia. Use of an i.v. 
anaesthetic for induction and maintenance is sometimes referred to as TIVA. Ketamine is also available 
for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, but is rarely used. Inhaled anaesthetics are classified as 
volatile agents or nitrous oxide. The latter is used for maintenance of anaesthesia in combination with i.v. 
or volatile agents, in a concentration of 50–66% in oxygen33 (it can also be used for analgesia). Volatile 
anaesthetics can be used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, and also following induction with 
an i.v. anaesthetic. Volatile agents include isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane. Isoflurane is the preferred 
inhalational anaesthetic for use in obstetrics.33 Desflurane is rapid acting and has about one-fifth of the 
potency of isoflurane. It is not recommended for induction of GA. Sevoflurane is also rapid acting, is more 
potent than desflurane and can be used for induction of anaesthesia. The MACs of desflurane, sevoflurane 
and isoflurane are 6.0, 1.8 and 1.2 for people of ages 30–60 years, and 5.2, 1.5 and 1.0 for people older 
than 65 years respectively.34 MAC would be higher in children and young adults.
Summary of the decision problem
As has been described, the purpose of anaesthesia monitoring is to ensure adequate sedation of the 
patient under GA. If anaesthesia is too deep the patient may be at risk of adverse effects, such as a 
prolonged recovery time. However, if anaesthesia is not deep enough patients may be more likely to 
experience awareness of their surroundings, and this may have short- and long-term psychological

effects, including depression and anxiety. Optimum anaesthetic dosing may also potentially lead to drug 
cost-savings.
Currently, anaesthetists generally use clinical observation of vital signs and other markers to assess 
unconsciousness and the possibility of awareness. However, clinical observation alone may not be a reliable 
surrogate marker of anaesthetic depth. As an alternative, technologies have been developed using EEG to 
measure and interpret patient electrical brain activity to provide a measure of unconsciousness. Three such 
technologies, prioritised for assessment, are BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend.
The aim of this report, therefore, is to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BIS, 
E-Entropy and Narcotrend to monitor the depth of anaesthesia in surgical patients undergoing GA.

Chapter 2 Assessment methods
Systematic review of patient outcomes
The purpose of this section is to describe the methods used in the systematic review of patient outcomes 
associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring. These methods were stated a priori in the published 
research protocol. An extract of the protocol outlining the methods is given in Appendix 1.
Identification of studies
A search strategy was developed for MEDLINE and pilot tested by an experienced information scientist. 
The MEDLINE strategy (see Appendix 2) was adapted where necessary to the specific vocabulary and rules 
of other electronic bibliographic databases. Searches were run in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE; 
Ovid EMBASE; Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD); The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews (CDSR); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects (DARE); and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database. For E-Entropy and 
Narcotrend the electronic searches were conducted from 1995 (around the time of the introduction of 
EEG technologies) to November 2011 (with an update search performed in February 2012).
Scoping searches indicated that the volume of evidence for BIS was relatively larger than for Narcotrend 
and E-Entropy and it would be beyond the resources available to include all of the BIS studies in the 
systematic review. During preliminary scoping searches we identified a recent Cochrane systematic review 
of BIS34 that had similar study eligibility criteria to our review (with the exception that it did not include 
studies of children). We therefore based our review of BIS on a Cochrane systematic review,34 which 
contained 31 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BIS. The most recent date of literature searching in 
the Cochrane review was May 2009. We therefore searched from the beginning of 2009 to November 
2011 for studies of BIS (and then updated in February 2012) (see Method of data synthesis for further 
information about how results from the Cochrane review are integrated into the current review). 
In addition to the searches of electronic bibliographic databases, the following sources were searched to 
identify potentially relevant studies:
z contact with experts in the field (identified by NICE as part of the consultation process)
z bibliographic lists of potentially relevant studies on BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend as supplied by the 
device manufacturers (via NICE)
z reference lists of included studies
z databases of research in progress, searched on 7 December 2011: UK Clinical Research Network 
(UKCRN); controlled-trials.com; ClinicalTrials.gov; NIHR-Clinical Research Network Portfolio; WHO ICTRP 
(International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). 
The titles and abstracts of studies identified from these searches were imported into a Reference Manager 
bibliographic database. All titles and abstracts in this database were assessed against the inclusion/
exclusion criteria (see Inclusion/exclusion criteria). Bibliographic records that clearly did not meet any of the 
inclusion criteria, or met at least one of the exclusion criteria, were excluded from further consideration. 
For each bibliographic record that met all of the inclusion criteria, or was of unclear relevance, a full-text 
version was obtained and assessed against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Full-text records that clearly did 
not meet all of the inclusion criteria were excluded from further consideration, and the reasons for their 
exclusion were noted.

Both the title and abstract selection step and the full-text selection step were conducted independently by 
two reviewers. After screening the bibliographic records, the reviewers compared their selection results. All 
initial differences in opinion were resolved through discussion, without needing to involve a third reviewer.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
The inclusion/exclusion criteria for this report were based on the scope of the appraisal set by NICE. Only 
articles published in the English language were included. Abstracts that had no corresponding full-text 
record (e.g. conference abstracts) were excluded unless they met two criteria: they were published in 2010 
or later; and they provided sufficient details to allow appraisal of the methodology and the assessment of 
results to be undertaken.
The inclusion/exclusion criteria were provided to each reviewer as a standard list against which each title/
abstract or full-text record could be readily assessed (see Appendix 3). In addition to the language and 
publication type restrictions, the following selection criteria were applied:
Population
Studies were included if they included patients who received GA for surgery, including adults and children 
(over the age of 2 years) in whom the technology is licensed. Studies involving patients receiving sedation 
in intensive care or high-dependency units, studies carried out in healthy volunteers and studies of nonsurgical anaesthesia were excluded.
Diagnostic technologies
The diagnostic technologies included were E-Entropy, BIS and Narcotrend.
Comparators
Comparators included standard clinical monitoring for monitoring delivery of anaesthesia, including one or 
more of the following clinical markers: end-tidal anaesthetic gas concentrations (for inhaled anaesthesia); 
pulse measurement; heart rhythm; blood pressure; lacrimation; and sweating.
Outcomes
Studies were included if at least one of the following outcomes was reported:
z probability of intraoperative awareness
z patient distress and other sequelae resulting from intraoperative awareness
z recovery status (e.g. Aldrete scoring system)
z time to emergence from anaesthesia
z time to extubation
z time to discharge from the recovery room
z consumption of anaesthetic agents
z morbidity and mortality including postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) from anaesthetic agents, 
pain-relieving drugs, antibiotics, antisickness drugs and muscle relaxants.
Study design
The review was limited to prospective controlled trials (once studies had been included in the systematic 
review, priority was given to RCTs unless no RCT evidence for relevant parameters was available in which 
case non-RCT data would be considered). Systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved 
in order to check their reference lists for potentially relevant studies but were not themselves evaluated 
(except for the Cochrane systematic review of BIS technologies,34 which was considered in more detail 
when conducting data synthesis: see Data extraction and critical appraisal methods).
Data extraction and critical appraisal methods
A standardised data extraction and quality appraisal template (see Appendix 5) was used to extract 
information on the relevant study characteristics for assessing the impact of the interventions on the

outcomes listed above (see Inclusion/exclusion criteria) and for assessing study quality. Study quality 
assessment criteria included: Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias criteria,35 as specified in the review 
protocol; methods of data analysis, including the statistical tests used and whether or not studies were 
powered statistically to detect differences in outcomes between intervention and comparator groups; 
participant attrition; generalisability of the studies; and conflict of interests. Criteria for the critical appraisal 
of non-randomised and observational studies were specified in the protocol but were not required, as all 
the included studies were RCTs (see Results of systematic review of patient outcomes).
The data extraction and critical appraisal template was completed for each study included in the systematic 
review by one reviewer and was checked by a second reviewer. All initial discrepancies between the 
reviewers were resolved by discussion, without needing to involve a third reviewer.
Method of data synthesis
Analyses of the three monitoring devices are presented in respective separate subsections of this 
report (see Results of systematic review of patient outcomes). For each device a narrative synthesis 
was conducted, with characteristics of the included trials, and their outcomes, described in the text 
and tabulated.
As stated, the analysis of BIS was based on trials included in an existing Cochrane review of BIS,34 and 
supplemented by trials identified and included in the current systematic review. For each BIS outcome 
measure we present a narrative synthesis of the studies identified in the current systematic review, in 
addition to the pooled meta-analysis estimates from the Cochrane review. Where possible, we have 
updated the Cochrane meta-analyses for BIS with trials identified in the current review. However, the 
Cochrane BIS review included only trials of adults, and it was not considered appropriate to combine trials 
of children identified in our searches with the existing adult trials. We used Cochrane Review Manager 
5.1.6 (The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) to conduct the 
meta-analyses.
Systematic review of cost-effectiveness
Identification of studies
A comprehensive search strategy was developed, tested and refined by an experienced information 
scientist to identify studies of the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. The MEDLINE 
search strategy is provided in Appendix 2.
A total of six electronic resources were searched. Searches were from database inception to November 
2011 (an update search was done in February 2012). The following electronic databases were searched: 
MEDLINE (Ovid); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (MEIP); EMBASE; The Cochrane 
Library including CENTRAL and CDSR; CRD including HTA database, DARE and National Health Service 
Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED); and EconLit. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were checked 
for any additional references, and the expert advisory group was contacted to identify additional published 
and unpublished studies.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Studies were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness through a two-stage 
process using predefined and explicit criteria. The full literature search results were independently screened 
by two reviewers to identify all citations that possibly met the inclusion criteria (Table 2).
Full papers of relevant studies were retrieved and assessed independently by two reviewers using a 
standardised eligibility form, using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria, except that only studies with 
standard treatment specified as ‘no depth of anaesthesia monitor’ were included. Studies reporting other 
outcomes (one or more of probability of intraoperative awareness, consumption of anaesthetic agents,

postoperative morbidity or mortality, HRQoL) were not included in the review, but were retained to inform 
the development and population of the decision-analytic model.
Data extraction and critical appraisal methods
Data were extracted by one reviewer using a standard data extraction form (see Appendix 6) and checked 
by a second reviewer. At each stage, any disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus.
The quality of the included economic evaluations was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist based on 
that proposed by Drummond and colleagues36 and Philips and colleagues37 (see Appendix 6).
Method of data synthesis
Studies of cost-effectiveness were synthesised through a narrative review with tabulation of results of 
included studies, where appropriate.
Economic evaluation
We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring, adopting the perspective of the UK NHS. 
Separate analyses are presented for each of the included technologies, compared with standard clinical 
monitoring – the included technologies are not compared with each other.
The scope issued by NICE identified a number of health outcomes, including morbidity and mortality from 
anaesthetic agents, pain-relieving drugs, antibiotics, antisickness drugs and muscle relaxants, as well as 
patient discomfort and sequelae resulting from intraoperative awareness. The model was developed to 
allow for the inclusion of these outcomes, if suitable data on baseline values and the effect of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring on these outcomes was identified in our systematic review of patient outcomes. 
Outcomes in the model are expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model evaluates costs 
from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Costs are expressed in UK sterling (pounds, 
£) at a 2011 price base. Both costs and outcomes are discounted using a 3.5% annual discount rate, in 
line with current guidance.38,39
Analytical methods

surgical population, additional potential benefits (in terms of reductions in anaesthetic dose and reduction 
in anaesthetic-related complications) that may be associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring are 
included in the base-case analysis, based on data from our systematic review of patient outcomes. Where 
data from the systematic review of patient outcomes were insufficiently robust, or where no evidence 
specific to the technology being considered was identified, data derived for other included technologies 
were used to populate the model.
Deterministic sensitivity analysis
Uncertainties around the probability, resource use and cost estimates, as well as effect parameters derived 
in the systematic review of patient outcomes, were investigated by applying ranges around the point 
estimates used in the base-case analysis. Where possible the ranges used in the deterministic sensitivity 
analyses were based on 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated for each input parameter. The method 
adopted was univariate sensitivity analysis – that is, varying one parameter at a time, leaving all other 
variables unchanged. This is to highlight the impact, if any, of each selected parameter alone on the 
cost-effectiveness results.
Scenario analysis
Scenario analysis was used to address uncertainty associated with the choice of data source adopted for 
parameter values in the base case and for variables omitted from the model.

Results of systematic review of patient outcomes
Quantity and quality of research available
In total, 776 bibliographic records were identified from electronic bibliographic databases and reference 
lists provided by the manufacturers of the BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend monitors (Figure 1).
Of these 776 records, 741 were excluded, based on information provided in the title and/or abstract. Fulltext publications were obtained and assessed for the remaining 35 records, of which 10 were found on 
further scrutiny to not meet the inclusion criteria. Reasons for excluding the 10 full-text records were that 
they were not RCTs (five publications), they included an inappropriate or unclear comparator group (four 
publications) and, in one case, the publication was retracted by the journal (see Appendix 4).
The remaining 25 full-text publications reported 25 studies, which were eligible for inclusion in the 
systematic review. Four of the 25 RCTs were identified by our update searches in February 2012, all

evaluating BIS. Because of finite time and resources we prioritised the largest of these for inclusion in 
the review (a trial of around 5000 patients, specifically designed to assess intraoperative awareness40). 
The other three were smaller trials (80 patients,41 40 patients,42 and 20 patients43 respectively) and their 
inclusion in the review was unlikely to change the findings. In summary, a total of 22 RCTs were included in 
this systematic review.
The 22 included studies were all RCTs that included study arms for at least one relevant technology (BIS, 
E-Entropy or Narcotrend) and a comparator that reflected standard clinical monitoring.
The 22 included studies were two- or three-arm RCTs that compared the following technologies against 
standard clinical monitoring:
z BIS alone: 11 studies40,44–53
z E-Entropy alone: five studies54–58
z Narcotrend alone: two studies59,60
z BIS and E-Entropy: two studies61,62
z BIS and Narcotrend: two studies.63,64
These 22 studies provide 15 comparisons of BIS against standard clinical monitoring, seven comparisons of 
E-Entropy against standard monitoring and four comparisons of Narcotrend against standard monitoring 
(Table 3).
The 15 comparisons of BIS against standard monitoring supplement the Cochrane review,34 which included 
31 RCTs of BIS against standard clinical practice.27,61,63–91
Note that only 11 of the 15 BIS studies in the current review are presented in the following BIS subsections 
for the following reasons:
z One of the trials of BIS and E-Entropy compared with standard clinical monitoring was included in the 
Cochrane BIS review,61 and therefore is described only within the E-Entropy subsections of this report 
(i.e. for the comparison of E-Entropy with standard clinical monitoring).
z Two of the trials of BIS and Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring were included in 
the Cochrane BIS review,63,64 and are therefore described only within the Narcotrend subsections of this 
report (i.e. for the comparison of Narcotrend with standard clinical monitoring).
z One of the BIS publications identified in the current systematic review (Leslie and colleagues50) is a 
long-term follow-up publication of one of the trials (the B-Aware trial by Myles and colleagues79) 
included in the Cochrane review.73 We report the long-term results of this trial in this report (see 
Assessment of outcomes: Bispectral Index) but details of the characteristics of the trial (including the 
risk of bias judgement) can be found in the Cochrane review itself.
Risk of bias in Bispectral Index trials
Table 4 reports a summary of the risk of bias judgements for the trials of BIS included in this systematic 
review (NB. The risk of bias judgements for the 31 RCTs in the Cochrane BIS review are not tabulated in this 
report, but are summarised in the text below).
In many cases the risk of bias in the trials was unclear because of limitations in reporting of 
methodological details. Uncertainty was greatest in relation to concealment of the random allocation 
process, where details were unclear in all but two trials. In the Cochrane systematic review of BIS, 12 of 
the 31 (39%) trials were considered to have adequately concealed random allocation, with most of the 
remainder judged as unclear.

Details of blinding of participants and trial personnel to trial arm were also generally unclear, as was the 
case of blinding of outcome assessors. In the Cochrane BIS review34 just over half of the studies were 
judged to be of a low risk of bias because of blinding of outcome assessors (17/31; 55%).
Random sequence generation was one of the domains where risk of bias was lowest. However, although 
all studies were reported to be randomised trials, in six trials (46%) the method of randomisation was 
not given. In the Cochrane systematic review of BIS34 just under half of the included studies (15/31; 48%) 
were judged to be of a low risk of bias because of adequate random sequence generation. Most of the 
remainder were unclear because of lack of details given in trial publications.
In general, there appeared to be low risk of bias in terms of selective reporting of outcomes, as could 
be judged from the details reported in the trial publications. This was also the case in the Cochrane BIS 
review.34 Bias associated with incomplete outcome data was judged low in around half of the trials (and in 
just under half in the Cochrane BIS review,34 15/31; 48%). In the remainder it was unclear, and in one trial 
it was judged to be high because of an imbalance in the percentage of patients excluded from the analysis 
between trial arms.62 In general, it was not considered that risk of other forms of bias were present. 
However, in one trial the risk was considered high because of the study being funded in part by the BIS 
module manufacturer.45

The trials varied in terms of their sample sizes, from as low as 20 patients to over 6000. There were seven 
(46%)45,46,48,52,53,59,62 that included fewer than 100 patients and five (33%)48,51,61,63,64 that had between 
101 and 200 patients. One trial included 921 patients,47 another included 530940 and another, the 
largest, included 6041 patients.44 In the Cochrane BIS review34 the majority of trials included fewer than 
100 patients (21/31; 68%). Seven trials (23%) included between 101 and 200 patients. Another study – 
the B-Unaware trial by Avidan and colleagues 2008 – included 1941 patients,27 and the largest included 
2463 patients.79 (NB. The Cochrane BIS review appears to count two publications relating to this single trial 
as two separate studies. One publication reports the main trial results,79 and a second publication focuses 
on recovery outcomes from the trial.74)
Six (55%)40,44,46,49,51,62 of the 11 BIS trials reported a statistical sample size calculation based on a nominated 
primary outcome, although one of these trials reported that the number of patients chosen was arbitrary 
rather than being based on a statistical calculation.49 The Cochrane BIS review34 did not comment on 
sample size power calculations in the studies included.
Six (55%)40,44,46,48,49,62 of the 11 BIS trials reported patient attrition. The attrition rate varied from 1.5%40
to 15% 49 of the total number of patients enrolled. Most of the studies reported the reasons for attrition, 
generally comprising exclusions from the analyses as a result of deviations from the study protocol. Given 
the nature of the procedure and the relatively short follow-up duration, loss to follow-up was rarely 
reported. In five (45%) studies it was reported by the authors that there was no attrition, or there did not 
appear to be any attrition.45,47,51–53 Whether or not an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis had been employed 
was rarely mentioned in the trial reports. Only two trials mentioned that patients had been analysed 
according to the procedure to which they had been randomised.44,46
Five of the BIS trials disclosed information about funding.40,44,45,49,51 Funding for two of these trials was 
provided by medical research funding organisations and/or hospital departmental grants.44,51 The other 
three trials reported varying financial associations with BIS manufacturers.40,44,49 The trial by Bannister 
and colleagues45 stated that Aspect Medical Systems supplied the BIS monitor, and that one author 
was employed by Aspect Medical Systems and another author was a paid consultant to Aspect Medical 
Systems. This funding therefore represents a conflict of interest. The trial by Kerssens and colleagues49
reported that Aspect Medical Systems did not financially support the study, but that the lead author had

received an educational grant in support of her salary from Aspect Medical Systems, and one co-author 
was a paid consultant to Aspect Medical Systems. In the trial by Zhang and colleagues,40 Aspect Medical 
Systems provided BIS electrodes, but no further detail on funding was given. None of the other BIS trials 
stated or appeared to have any major conflicts of interest. The Cochrane BIS review34 did not report 
funding details of the included trials, or whether or not any of the trials had conflicts of interests.
Risk of bias in E-Entropy trials
Table 5 reports a summary of the risk of bias judgements for the trials of E-Entropy included in this 
systematic review.
The risk of bias in the E-Entropy trials was unclear in many cases because of limitations in the reporting of 
methodological details. Uncertainty was greatest concerning allocation concealment and the blinding of 
participants and personnel, which were not adequately reported in any of the seven E-Entropy trials.
Risk of bias because of random sequence generation was considered low in four of the trials, in which 
sequences were generated either by computer56,57,61 or by drawing lots.62 Risk of bias because of random 
sequence generation was deemed unclear in the remaining three trials, which provided no information on 
the method of sequence generation.
The method of allocation concealment was considered to pose unclear risk of bias in all seven of the trials, 
either because no relevant information was reported58,61,62 or sealed envelopes were used for allocation 
codes, but it was not stated whether or not the envelopes were opaque.54–57
Anaesthetists who administered anaesthesia according to standard clinical monitoring were blinded 
to E-Entropy values. However, none of the studies unequivocally reported that study participants and 
personnel were blinded to the study groups. The risk of bias because of inadequate blinding in each of the 
E-Entropy studies was therefore judged to be unclear.
In three of the seven E-Entropy trials, the risk of attrition bias because of analysis of incomplete outcome 
data was considered low, as exclusions were a minor proportion of the sample size,54 or were generally 
balanced between groups with generally similar reasons given,61 or the analysis was conducted by ITT 
with no discernible attrition.56 Two trials were considered at high risk of attrition bias because the rate of 
attrition was ≥10% in at least one of the study arms, and not balanced across the arms.58,62 The remaining 
two trials were judged to have unclear risk of attrition bias because of incomplete outcome data, either 
because attrition was not reported at all55 or it was not reported separately by study arm.57

The risk of bias because of selective reporting of outcomes was judged to be low for six of the seven 
E-Entropy trials, as there was no indication within the primary publications that more outcomes had been 
measured than were subsequently reported (in general, there was concordance between the outcomes 
specified in the methods and results sections of the publications). In the remaining trial,57 risk of bias from 
selective reporting was considered unclear as several outcomes were reported narratively without any 
supporting quantitative data that could be checked by the reviewers.
One of the E-Entropy trials56 reported that no external funding was used, and one trial62 did not report 
whether or how the work was funded. Two trials were funded by non-commercial sponsors, which were 
a university54 and a national science organisation.58 The remaining three E-Entropy trials were supported 
by the E-Entropy device manufacturer (GE Healthcare; formerly Datex-Ohmeda), either through provision 
of equipment alone55,61 or through provision of equipment, funding and also technical support.57 The 
authors of this latter trial57 included a research engineer, research scientist and chief scientist of the device 
manufacturer and two medical advisors to the device manufacturer. These three trials that involved 
support from the device manufacturer could be at risk of bias because of conflict of interests. The study 
that involved the most extensive links with the manufacturer57 was deemed by the reviewers to be at high 
risk of bias because of a high likelihood of conflicting interests. In the four E-Entropy trials that were not 
supported by the E-Entropy device manufacturer, three did not refer to conflict of interests54,58,62 and one 
stated that no conflicts were disclosed.56
The seven E-Entropy studies were published during 2005 to 2010 and ranged in their total sample size 
from 50 to 335 patients.54–58,61,62 Five of the trials involved a two-arm comparison of E-Entropy against 
standard clinical monitoring.54–58 One trial involved a three-arm comparison of BIS, E-Entropy and 
standard clinical monitoring.61 The remaining trial was a three-arm comparison of E-Entropy, E-Entropy 
and BIS, and standard practice.62 The number of patients randomised per arm ranged from 25 to 40 in 
six trials.54–56,58,61,62 In the seventh (largest) trial, only the number per arm after attrition (160 patients) 
was reported.57
Only one of the E-Entropy trials did not report a sample size calculation.58 Three trials calculated 
the sample size needed to detect a specified percentage difference in anaesthetic consumption for 
sevoflurane54,61 or propofol.62 The remaining three trials calculated the sample size needed to detect 
differences in patient recovery from anaesthesia, namely the time to eye opening,55 time to awakening (not 
defined)56 or the time to response to a verbal command.57
Overall, the range of attrition in the trials was 0–11% of the total population per trial, or 0–17% of 
the population per study arm. Attrition appeared to be zero in one trial,56 and was not reported in one 
trial.55 Among the remaining five trials, reasons for attrition were clearly reported separately by study 
group in two trials;54,61 were reported only for aggregated data across study groups in one trial;57 were 
vaguely specified as resulting from ‘technical problems’ in one trial;54 and were not specified in the 
remaining trial.58
An analysis by ITT was explicitly reported in one trial and appears valid as no attrition was discernible 
in the study report.56 Another trial55 did not explicitly mention ITT analysis but appeared to have used 
an ITT approach, as it was stated that all patients were included in the final analysis, although attrition 
was not reported. A third trial54 analysed nearly all the randomised patients [only 1/40 per group (2.5%) 
were excluded], which may be considered close to an ITT approach. The remaining four trials57,58,61,62 did 
not follow the ITT principle as their analyses excluded from 4% to 17% of the randomised patients per 
study arm.

In many cases the risk of bias in the trials was unclear because of limitations in reporting of 
methodological details. Uncertainty was greatest in relation to concealment of the random allocation 
process and blinding of participants and personnel, where details were unclear in all four trials.59,60,63,64
Both the method of random sequence generation and blinding of outcome assessment were unclear in 
two trials,59,60 with low risk of bias for these domains in the other two trials.63,64 Risk of bias because of 
incomplete outcome data was low in all but one trial in which details were unclear.60
In general, there appeared to be low risk of bias in terms of selective reporting of outcomes, as could be 
judged from the details reported in the trial publications. Other sources of bias were reported for only 
one study where the paper was translated from Chinese to English prior to publication and it is unclear 
whether or not any checks were made to ensure fidelity of the published version to the original work.59
The trials were conducted between 2003 and 2010 and trial sizes ranged from 120 patients63,64 to 48 
patients60 and 40 patients.59 All but the smallest study reported the use of a sample size calculation. No 
attrition was reported for three trials59,63,64 and these studies conducted ITT analyses. The fourth trial60
reported attrition although not by study group, and analyses did not include all patients who started but 
it is unclear whether or not attrition happened pre or post randomisation. All four trials59,60,63,64 did not 
report any conflict of interest. Two studies63,64 stated that the study was solely supported by departmental 
funding, one59 did not report any details of the sponsor and the fourth60 reported that the study was 
supported by a pharmaceutical company and a university institutional research grant.
Characteristics of included studies: Bispectral Index
The following subsections describe the key characteristics of the BIS trials included in this systematic 
review. The characteristics of the 31 trials included in the Cochrane BIS review are summarised alongside.
Study populations
Five of the 11 BIS trials were conducted in children, with mean ages of between 4 and 6 years, and age 
ranges from 2 to 18 years.45,46,51–53 The remaining six studies were conducted in adults,40,44,47–49,62 with 
mean ages ranging across the studies from 43 to 64 years. One study was conducted to investigate POCD 
in an elderly population, defined as >60 years (no further age information given) (conference abstract).47
All of the trials included in the Cochrane BIS review34 studied adult patients (the review’s inclusion criteria 
specified adults over the age of 18 years).
All of the trials included mixed-sex populations. Generally, there was an even mix of males and females in 
the trials, though there was a higher percentage of males (i.e. >60%) in three studies.46,48,51 One study did 
not report the sex of the included patients.47
All but one of the studies reported patients’ weight.47 The majority of studies reported weight in kilograms, 
ranging from a mean of 68–91kg in the adult studies, and of 17–28kg in the children studies. In addition 
to reporting weight in kilograms, one trial also reported body mass index (BMI), which was between 28

and 30 kg/m2.
49 Another trial reported weight only in terms of BMI, with a mean of 30 kg/m2
, indicating 
an overweight/obese population.44 The Cochrane BIS review34 included one study of obese patients.
Racial origin was reported in only one trial, in which the population was predominantly (>80%) classified 
as white.44 The countries in which the trials were conducted included the USA,45,49,52,53 USA/Canada,44
China,40,47,51 Germany,62 Egypt48 and India.46 In the Cochrane BIS review34 the majority of studies were 
conducted in Europe or the USA. Seven of the trials were conducted in single centres,45,46,48,51–53,62 with 
one trial taking place in two centres,47 another taking place in three centres,44 one trial taking place in 
13 centres40 and a trial not reporting the number of centres.49
The type of surgery reported in the adult trials varied: open heart,44 major non-cardiac,47 major 
orthopaedic,49 orthopaedic,62 and elective moderate abdominal surgery.48 The surgical procedures in the 
trials of children included tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy,45 urogenital/urological surgery46,51 and 
dental rehabilitation.52,53
Only two of the trials reported patient risk factors for awareness.40,44 To be included in the trial by Avidan 
and colleagues44 patients had to be at high risk for intraoperative awareness, demonstrating one or 
more of the following risk factors: planned open heart surgery; aortic stenosis; pulmonary hypertension; 
use of opiates; use of benzodiazepines; use of anticonvulsant drugs; daily alcohol consumption; ASA 
status 4; end-stage lung disease; history of intraoperative awareness; history of, or anticipated, difficult 
intubation; cardiac ejection fraction of <40%; and marginal exercise tolerance. The trial by Zhang and 
colleagues40 included patients receiving TIVA, which they cited as a risk factor for intraoperative awareness. 
The Cochrane BIS review34 included four trials that were classified as including patients at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness.27,78,79,82
The eligibility criteria employed by the trials generally excluded patients with significant comorbidities, 
or factors that may interfere with EEG readings, including epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, 
treatment with opioids and antipsychotic medication, and illicit drug use. Two of the studies permitted 
inclusion of children with mild cerebral palsy without significant neurological deficit.52,53 The trials included 
in the Cochrane BIS review34 also generally excluded patients with the above factors. Some of these trials 
also excluded patients considered obese, or patients with diabetes or impaired renal or hepatic function.
The ASA physical status classification of the patients in the trials was generally between I and II, indicating 
that they were generally healthy, with only mild disease. In three of the trials the ASA status was not 
reported45,47,48 (although in one of these trials the inclusion criteria specified patients had to be within 
I–III48). In one trial the proportion of patients with ASA status I–II was 50%, and the remainder of patients 
were classified as III (severe systemic disease).49 There was one trial in which patients were predominantly 
classified as III–IV (IV being classified as a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat 
to life).44
Technologies
The trials varied in the level of detail given on the BIS module and monitors used. Two studies did not 
provide any information other than that a BIS module was used.44,47 Most commonly reported was the 
BIS Monitor Model A-2000 as mentioned in four trials.40,45,48,62 In one this was described as: ‘IP X 2’;46 in 
another ‘version XP, software version 4.0’;62 and in the third trial using Aspect Medical Systems ‘Software 
program Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Collect (v4.0)’ (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Norwood, MA, USA).48 One 
trial used BIS (version 3.3, Aspect Medical Systems) using an A-1050 EEG monitor,45 while another used 
BIS monitor (XP, algorithm 3.4; Aspect Medical Systems).49 A further two trials reported using BIS (Aspect 
Medical Systems), but gave no further information on the software version or the monitor used.52,53
Although most studies reported using Aspect Medical Systems BIS, one trial reported using the BIS 
monitor as manufactured by Phillips but using ‘Aspect Medical Systems’ XP platform technology’.51 Given 
the variability in reporting it is not clear how comparable the trials are in terms of the software and BIS 
algorithms used, which may have implications for the interpretation of the results of the trials.

All of the trials reported the target BIS values to be achieved during anaesthesia. In five trials the target 
was 40–60.40,44,45,47,51 In one of these trials the target was increased to 60–70 during last 15 minutes of 
surgery.45 In the remaining trials the target values were higher: 45–60;46 50 during maintenance (target 
value of 60 to facilitate rapid emergence from anaesthesia 15 minutes before expected end of surgery);62
50–60;48,49 55–65;53 and 60–70.52
Although all of the trials compared BIS against standard clinical monitoring, the monitored parameters 
varied. Only one trial measured ETAC in order to detect possible intraoperative awareness.44 Audible alarms 
sounded if the age-adjusted MAC fell outside of 0.7 to 1.3. The remaining nine trials used clinical signs to 
guide anaesthetic use. In general, a combination of signs were monitored in each trial, most commonly: 
blood pressure;46,48,49,52,62,94 heart rate;48,49,52,53,62 surgical stimulation;52,53 sweating;62 tear production;62
and movement.62
Two trials did not explicitly define which signs were monitored other than that they were clinical signs and 
haemodynamic changes.45,47 A further trial mentioned that the aim of standard clinical monitoring was to 
maintain haemodynamic stability while avoiding patient movement and achieving a rapid recovery.51
Some of the trials reported that clinical signs were also monitored in the BIS arm, suggesting that 
adjustment of anaesthesia was based on signs of inadequate anaesthesia as well as BIS values.48,52,53,62 For 
example, in one trial48 changes in anaesthesia were guided by the presence of clinical signs in relation to 
the BIS value. If the patient exhibited hypertension or tachycardia and the BIS was >60 then sevoflurane 
was increased. If BIS was in the target range of 50–60, then fentanyl was given. If BIS was <50 then 
sevoflurane was decreased and the patient checked for lack of analgesia. In the one trial that used ETAC 
as the comparator to BIS,44 it was stated that both forms of monitoring were used as part of structured 
protocols. It was not intended that these protocols would prescribe or restrict the use of anaesthetic 
agents. Practitioners were able to increase or decrease anaesthetic administration at their discretion if a 
patient’s condition was haemodynamically unstable. The protocols were designed to increase vigilance 
and to provide warnings that patients might be experiencing awareness. Some trials did not explicitly 
report whether or not clinical signs were monitored in the BIS arm, and it is possible that in these studies 
anaesthesia was adjusted based on BIS monitoring in conjunction with changes in clinical signs.
All trials reported that a BIS monitor was used in the standard clinical monitoring arm, but that the values 
were hidden from the anaesthetist, for example by placing it out of their line of sight, or using a curtain or 
cover, and also switching off any audible alarms.
The majority of trials did not explicitly report where or when monitoring commenced and ceased. 
Where details were provided, monitoring started prior to anaesthesia induction45,46 and in the operating 
theatre.46,51,62 Three studies reported cessation of monitoring: until patients achieved discharge criteria 
from the recovery room (Steward score of 6)46 and until discharge from the PACU.52,53
The training and experience of the anaesthetist in using BIS was rarely mentioned in the trials. The trial by 
Avidan and colleagues44 reported that summaries of BIS and ETAC protocols were given to the practitioners 
to provide education and to increase adherence. Furthermore, signs were affixed to anaesthesia machines 
to remind practitioners to check BIS/ETAC and consider patient awareness. One of the trials mentioned 
that the anaesthetist was experienced, but provided no further information.62
Anaesthetic agents and protocols
Five of the trials reported that an inhaled general anaesthetic was used for both induction and 
maintenance.44,45,51–53 In all but one of these trials sevoflurane was the inhaled anaesthetic used.53 Two 
of these trials also gave nitrous oxide in oxygen.45,51 In the fifth trial patients either received isoflurane, 
sevoflurane or desflurane.44 Three trials reported that both i.v. and inhalational general anaesthetic were 
used.47–49 In two of these propofol was used for induction of anaesthesia and sevoflurane was given for 
maintenance.48,49 The third trial implied that both propofol and an inhalational anaesthetic were given,

but did not provide any further detail.47 Three trials reported that propofol was given for both induction 
and maintenance of general anaesthesisa.40,46,62 One of these also used nitrous oxide in oxygen during the 
maintenance period.46
Only one trial stated that regional anaesthesia was used, although no information was provided on 
which agent was used.62 One trial mentioned that regional anaesthesia was used for postoperative pain 
management.49 In the remaining nine trials44–48,51–53,62 it was either reported that regional anaesthesia was 
not used or the use of regional anaesthesia was not stated.
Use of analgesia at various points during surgery was reported by seven of the trials, including 
fentanyl,49,51–53 fentanyl or morphine45,46 or remifentanil (during induction).62 One trial reported that 
analgesia was used at the discretion of the anaesthetist.40 In three trials the use of analgesia was not 
stated.44,47,48 Premedication with midazolam was used in seven trials.40,44–46,52,53,62 In two of these trials 
ketamine was also used as premedication.52,53
Muscle relaxants were used in seven of the trials, including atracurium,46,48 cisatracurium,63 vecuronium 
bromide49 and rocuronium bromide.52,53 One trial did not specify which agent was used.40
Duration of anaesthesia was reported by five of the BIS trials46,48,49,51,62 and ranged from a mean of 
40 minutes (paediatric urological surgery)51 to 126 minutes (major orthopaedic surgery in adults).49 In the 
trials featuring adults, duration of anaesthesia was, in general, between 100 and 120 minutes. Duration 
of surgery was reported by seven of the BIS trials,40,45,46,48,51–53 and ranged from around 30 minutes (in 
children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy)45 to 160 minutes (children undergoing dental 
surgery).52 Not all trials reported both duration of anaesthesia and duration of surgery.
Outcomes
Table 7 illustrates the distribution of outcomes reported by the trials included in this systematic review. The 
table also shows the frequency of the outcomes in this review, the Cochrane BIS review34 and the grand 
total for both reviews.
The most commonly reported outcome was anaesthetic consumption (n=30 trials), followed by recovery 
outcomes such as time to extubation (n=26 trials); time to eye opening (either spontaneously or in 
response to command) (n=22 trials); and time to discharge from the PACU. Intraoperative analgesic 
consumption was reported in 11 trials.
Adverse outcomes were less commonly reported, such as PONV (n=3 trials); and emergence delirium 
(n=1 trial59). One trial, by Leslie and colleagues,50 reported stroke, myocardial infarction, mortality for all 
surviving and available patients 30 days post operation. This is a long-term follow-up (median=4.1 years) 
publication of the B-Aware trial [NB. A publication of the short-term results of this trial by Myles and 
colleagues 200479 (primary outcome: intraoperative awareness) was included in the Cochrane BIS review34].
Six of the 11 BIS trials40,44,46,49,59,62 included in this systematic review specified a primary outcome measure. 
In two trials the primary outcome measure was anaesthetic consumption,46,62 and in another trial the 
primary outcome measure was time to first movement response.59 In the other three trials the primary 
outcome measure was intraoperative awareness.40,44,49
In the trial by Avidan and colleagues44 – which recruited patients classified as at high risk of intraoperative 
awareness – the incidence of definite intraoperative awareness was the primary outcome measure. The 
incidence of definite or possible awareness was a secondary outcome. Awareness was assessed by a 
modified Brice questionnaire (references cited), and assessments were made 72 hours after surgery and 
30 days after extubation. Patients who reported memories of the period between ‘going to sleep’ and 
‘waking up’ were contacted by a different evaluator, who asked additional structured questions. Responses 
to the questionnaire from patients who had reported memories were reviewed by three independent

experts, who determined whether the reported event involved definite awareness, possible awareness 
or no awareness. Where there was a difference in judgement over an awareness episode a fourth expert 
made the final determination. This study was designed specifically to evaluate the effects of BIS on 
intraoperative awareness, and to overcome methodological limitations of a previous single-centre trial by 
the same investigators (the B-Unaware trial27 – included in the Cochrane BIS review34) by including a study 
sample sufficiently large enough to detect a relatively rare outcome such as awareness.
The trial by Zhang and colleagues40 also reported incidence of confirmed awareness, or possible 
awareness, using a Brice questionnaire. Assessments were made on the first and fourth day following 
surgery. An independent evaluating committee was used to verify cases of awareness. The patients in this 
trial were noted to be at increased risk of intraoperative awareness after receiving TIVA.
The trial by Kerssens and colleagues49 measured explicit awareness, via a patient interview, as well as 
implicit awareness, via a word recognition test. This is the only trial identified by the current systematic 
review that measured implicit awareness. The underlying hypothesis was that intraoperative memory 
could occur either because of insufficient anaesthetic or stress-induced learning mechanisms during 
unconsciousness (i.e. intraoperative memory could be dependent on and/or independent of depth 
of anaesthesia). Six hours after surgery, patients were interviewed using questions similar to the Brice 
interview, consisting of five questions, with additional questions asked as necessary. Following the 
interview a recognition memory test was performed. During anaesthesia, sequences of pre-determined 
neutral words were played to patients through headphones. The postoperative memory test involved 
playing pre-determined combinations of words that had been used during anaesthesia, and distractor 
words, to patients though headphones. Patients were instructed to listen to each test sequence and select 
the word played during surgery, or to guess if necessary. The main analysis of this study was the effect of 
study group assignment on recognition memory test performance, but given the low incidence of explicit 
recall (awareness) the study was not powered to detect differences in explicit recall. An arbitrary sample 
size of 100 patients was chosen to assess recognition memory.
Intraoperative awareness was also reported as a non-primary outcome by three other BIS trials included 
in this systematic review.48,51,62 In these trials, awareness was one of a number of outcomes measured, 
and patients were not identified as being at particular risk. Awareness was assessed by a patient interview 
administered at various times up to 3 days post operation. In the trial by Ellerkmann and colleagues62
interviews took place on the first and third postoperative days, in the trial by Kamal and colleagues48
interviews took place on the first, second and third days postoperatively, and in the trial by Liao and 
colleagues51 the timing was not specified. Little detail of the interviews was given other than that ‘patients 
were questioned for recall of events, hearing vague sounds, feeling surgical instruments or dressing 
application, or dreaming’;48 or patients were asked ‘whether they could recall any event or dreaming 
during the intraoperative period’;51 or that a ‘standardised interview’ was used (reference cited).62
The Cochrane BIS review conducted a meta-analysis of explicit intraoperative awareness, which included 
four RCTs.27,78,79,82 The Cochrane review also included a further eight trials61,63,66,83,84,87–89 that reported 
explicit intraoperative awareness, but the review did not classify these as featuring patients at higher 
risk. They were not included in any meta-analysis and the impact on awareness was not commented 
on by the Cochrane review. The Cochrane BIS review did not report whether any of the included trials 
measured implicit awareness or assessed awareness during surgery using techniques such as the isolated 
forearm technique.
Assessment of outcomes: Bispectral Index
The following sections report the results of the BIS trials included in this systematic review. Tabulated data 
are from the studies identified by this review (i.e. supplemental to the trials in the Cochrane BIS review). 
Where appropriate we have updated the meta-analyses of the Cochrane BIS review with studies from the 
current review, presented graphically in forest plots. Where it was not appropriate to update the Cochrane 
BIS meta-analysis we have presented the results of the meta-analysis narratively.

Intraoperative awareness
Table 8 gives the results of the six trials included in this systematic review which measured the impact of 
BIS monitoring on explicit intraoperative awareness, as assessed by patient interview.
No cases of awareness were reported at all in three trials,48,51,62 and a very low number of cases were 
reported in a fourth trial.49 As stated earlier, these trials were not specifically designed to detect the effect 
of depth of anaesthesia monitoring on awareness, and therefore are unlikely to have sufficiently large 
enough sample sizes for relatively rare awareness events. In the trial by Avidan and colleagues,44 which 
included patients classified at higher risk for intraoperative awareness and was statistically powered for this 
outcome, there was a higher percentage of both definite awareness, and of definite or possible awareness 
cases, in the group who received BIS monitoring than the group who had standard clinical monitoring. 
However, these differences were not statistically significant. Avidan and colleagues44 also reported patient 
distress and sequelae resulting from intraoperative awareness, as a post hoc secondary outcome. Distress 
was measured using the Michigan Awareness Classification tool (reference supplied) and was characterised 
by reports of fear, anxiety, suffocation, sense of doom or sense of impending death. There was a higher 
percentage of distress reported in the BIS-monitored group, but no statistically significant difference 
between groups.
In contrast to Avidan and colleagues,44 Zhang and colleagues40 reported a significantly lower incidence 
of confirmed intraoperative awareness in patients monitored by BIS than in those who received standard 
clinical monitoring. Incidence of possible awareness was also lower for BIS-monitored patients, although 
not statistically significant. The incidence of confirmed or possible awareness was significantly lower for 
BIS-monitored patients.
Intraoperative awareness was the primary outcome measure in the Cochrane BIS review.34 However, as 
stated earlier, the review reported awareness outcomes only for trials in its set which were conducted with 
patients considered to be at higher risk of awareness (n=4).27,78,79,82 The Cochrane review combined these

four trials in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, and we have updated this meta-analysis to include the two trials 
from our study set that featured higher risk patients.40,44 Figure 2 reports the results of this meta-analysis.
The meta-analysis included three subgroup analyses: trials that used inhaled GA only; trials that used a 
mixture of inhaled and i.v. anaesthesia; and trials that used TIVA. The original overall pooled Peto’s odds 
ratio (OR) from the Cochrane review was 0.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.84], indicating 
a statistically significant difference between groups favouring BIS. The addition of the trials by Avidan 
and colleagues44 and Zhang and colleagues40 increased the OR to 0.45 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.81). Caution 
is advised in the interpretation of this result as, overall, there was statistically significant heterogeneity 
(p=0.009; I
2=79%). In the subgroup of trials that used only inhaled anaesthesia the Peto’s OR was 1.79 
(95% CI 0.63 to 5.11) in favour of standard clinical monitoring. This is in contrast with the other two 
subgroups, which favoured BIS monitoring.
Explicit intraoperative awareness was an outcome measured in a further eight trials included in the 
Cochrane BIS review. However, as stated earlier, the review did not report the results of these trials for 
this outcome. We examined these studies (data not formally extracted) and note that no patients in any 
of these eight trials reported experiencing intraoperative awareness. It is unlikely that these studies were 
adequately statistically powered to detect awareness.
The trial by Kersens and colleagues49 was the only study to report implicit awareness, that is awareness 
that the patient does not necessarily recall experiencing. The probability of postoperatively selecting a 
word presented during anaesthesia (target) was higher in the BIS monitoring group (mean 0.371±0.132) 
than in the standard clinical monitoring group (mean 0.323±0.132). The probability of postoperatively 
selecting a word not presented during anaesthesia (distractor) was lower in the BIS monitoring group 
(mean 0.315±0.117) than in the standard clinical monitoring group (mean 0.338±0.119). It was not 
reported whether or not differences between study groups were statistically significant. Intragroup and 
overall differences between postoperative target and distractor word recall suggest that BIS-monitored 
patients were more likely to select words presented during anaesthesia than words not presented during 
anaesthesia, but standard clinical monitoring patients performed no better than chance in word selection 
(within-group difference in probability of selecting target word or distraction word: BIS: p=0.001; 
standard clinical monitoring: p≥0.05).
Anaesthetic consumption
Table 9 reports the impact of BIS monitoring on intraoperative general anaesthetic requirement.
Six of the 11 BIS trials included in this systematic review reported this outcome measure,45–47,49,51,62 two 
of which reported it to be the primary outcome.46,62 Three of the trials reported volatile anaesthetic 
consumption, all of which were for sevoflurane. Two of these three trials were conducted in children.45,51
The mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (%) during maintenance of GA in each of these three trials 
was statistically significantly lower in the BIS-monitored group than in the standard clinical monitoring 
group. The other three trials46,47,62 reported i.v. anaesthetic consumption, all of which used propofol. 
One of these trials was conducted with children.46 In two of the three trials the maintenance dose was 
higher in BIS-monitored patients than standard clinical monitoring, but with no statistically significant 
differences between groups.46,62 The third trial was reported in a conference abstract, and limited results 
are given, except that there was a 25.3% reduction in propofol consumption compared with standard 
clinical monitoring.47
The Cochrane BIS review34 conducted random-effects meta-analyses for anaesthetic consumption, 
producing separate meta-analyses for volatile anaesthetic consumption and for propofol consumption. 
We have updated these meta-analyses with studies included in our systematic review. Figure 3 shows the 
results of the meta-analysis of volatile anaesthetic consumption (sevoflurane).

As stated, two of the three studies measuring sevoflurane consumption in our systematic review were 
conducted in children. The Cochrane BIS review34 only included studies of adults, therefore we have only 
updated their meta-analysis with the one study of adults from our set (Kerssens and colleagues49). The 
original mean difference in MAC equivalents from the Cochrane review for sevoflurane consumption was 
–0.16 (–0.29 to –0.04), indicating a statistically significant difference in favour of BIS. Updating the metaanalysis with the trial by Kerssens and colleagues49 reduced the mean difference slightly to –0.15 (95% 
CI –0.25 to –0.06), but remained statistically significant. However, caution is advised because of a high 
degree of unexplained statistical heterogeneity (p<0.00001; I
2=85%).
Figure 4 shows the results of the meta-analysis of propofol consumption.
As stated, one of the three studies measuring propofol consumption in our systematic review was 
conducted in children.46 As the Cochrane BIS review34 only included studies of adults, therefore we have 
updated their meta-analysis with one of the two studies of adults from our set.62 (NB. The other adult 
study47 was only reported in a conference abstract and the results were not reported in a format amenable 
to meta-analysis.) The original mean difference propofol consumption (mg/kg/minute) in the Cochrane 
review was –1.44 (–1.95 to –0.93), indicating a statistically significant difference in favour of BIS. Updating 
the meta-analysis with the trial by Ellerkmann and colleagues62 reduced the mean difference slightly to 
–1.30 (95% CI –1.83 to –0.76), but remained statistically significant. Again, caution is required because of 
highly significant unexplained statistical heterogeneity (p<0.00001; I
2=80%).

Outcomes related to postanaesthesia care unit stay
Five of the 11 BIS trials45,46,48,52,53 in our systematic review reported this outcome, of which four were 
conducted with children.45,46,52,53 In none of the trials was use of PACU a primary outcome. All of the 
studies appear to have reported the time to discharge from the PACU. However, it was not always clear 
exactly when the time to discharge began (e.g. from the end of skin closure, termination of anaesthetic 
or from admittance to the PACU). Bannister and colleagues45 reported time from end of surgery to PACU 
discharge, whereas Kamal and colleagues48 and both the trials by Messieha and colleagues52,53 stated 
measuring the end of general anaesthetic to PACU discharge (although in one of these trials48 data do 
not appear to be reported for that outcome). Bhardwaj and colleagues46 did not provide any detail on 
timing. Detail of discharge criteria varied between the trials. Bannister and colleagues45and Kamal and 
colleagues48 both used the Aldrete scoring system (score of >9), whereas Bhardwaj and colleagues46 used 
the Steward recovery scoring system (eligibility=score of 6). Messieha and colleagues52,53 did not report 
use of discharge criteria.
Table 10 shows the results of the trials relating to stay in the PACU.
In all trials, time to discharge from the PACU was statistically significantly greater in the standard 
clinical monitoring group than in the BIS monitoring group, with mean differences in the range of 
6.7–30 minutes. One trial did not report data for this outcome, mentioning that time to discharge was 
comparable between groups. There was also a statistically significant difference in the one trial that 
measured time to arrival at the PACU, with reduction of 4.7 minutes for BIS monitoring.48 The two trials 
that reported duration of stay in the PACU both reported statistically significant differences in favour of 
BIS.52,53
Eligibility for discharge from the PACU unit was one of the secondary outcomes from the Cochrane BIS 
review.34 The review meta-analysed the outcome ‘PACU’ stay, including data from 12 trials. Examination of 
characteristics of the trials included in this meta-analysis, as summarised in the Cochrane review, show that 
some of the trials reported time to arrival in the PACU, time to discharge from the PACU and length of stay 
in the PACU. These all appear to have been included in the same meta-analysis, and there is no discussion

about how timings may differ according to these different outcomes. Given this lack of clarity, and the 
fact that the Cochrane review included only trials of adults, we decided not to update this meta-analysis 
with data from trials identified in the current review. The pooled random-effects mean difference reported 
in the Cochrane review was –7.63 minutes (95% CI –12.50 to –2.76 minutes) in favour of BIS. However, 
caution is advised for the reasons given above, as well as a high degree of statistical heterogeneity 
(p<0.00001; I
2=82%). The results of the meta-analysis are similar to the results of the trials included in 
the current review (i.e. showing a benefit for BIS monitoring).
Time to recovery from anaesthesia
The trials included in the current systematic review reported a variety of outcomes relating to recovery from 
anaesthesia, including time to tracheal extubation, time to eye opening and movement responses.
Table 11 reports the time to tracheal extubation following surgery.
Five of the 11 BIS trials included in the current systematic review measured time to extubation, of which 
four were conducted with children.45,46,52,53 None of these studies considered this to be a statistically 
powered primary outcome measure. Timing was reported to have begun from end of surgery in three 
studies,45,52,53 and from termination of anaesthetic in two studies.46,48 Extubation times were shorter for 
BIS-monitored patients than for those receiving standard clinical monitoring by as much as 5 minutes or 
as little as 0.5 minutes. Differences between groups were reported to be statistically significant in two 
trials,45,53 but not in two other trials.48,52 One trial did not report numerical data, stating that times were 
comparable between groups.46
A sixth study, conducted with children, reported time to laryngeal mask airway removal following surgery 
as an outcome.51 The mean time [standard deviation (SD)] in minutes was 1.8 (1.6) in the BIS-monitored

significant differences between groups.
Time to extubation was one of the secondary outcomes from the Cochrane BIS review.34 The review metaanalysed data from 21 trials. Given that four of the five trials45,46,52,53 in the current systematic review were 
conducted in children and the Cochrane review was restricted to trials of adults, we have not updated 
their meta-analysis. The overall random-effects mean difference in time to extubation was –2.87 minutes 
(95% CI –3.74 to –1.99 minutes), indicating a statistically significant difference in favour of BIS. Caution is 
advised as there was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity (p<0.00001; I
2=79%).

Three trials included in the current systematic review reported time to eye opening, two of which were 
conducted with children.46,51 Timing was reported to have begun immediately after the last surgical stitch 
in two studies48,51 and from the end of surgery in one trial.46 Times were shorter in BIS-monitored patients, 
although by modest duration (up to 1 minute) and there were no statistically significant differences 
between groups. One trial provided only narrative results, reporting comparable times between groups.
Time to eye opening was one of the secondary outcomes from the Cochrane BIS review.34 The review 
meta-analysed data from 19 trials. Given that two of the three trials in the current systematic review were 
conducted in children and the Cochrane review was restricted to trials of adults, we have not updated 
their meta-analysis. The overall random-effects mean difference in time to extubation was –2.14 minutes 
(95% CI –2.99 to –1.29 minutes), indicating a statistically significant difference in favour of BIS. Caution 
is advised as there was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity (p<0.00001; I
2=83%). The results of 
the meta-analysis are more conclusive than those of the relatively smaller number of trials included in the 
current review.

reduction in time to first spontaneous movement of 2.5 minutes. This trial51 also reported a shorter time to 
phonation (making a vocal sound) of 4.5 minutes, but this was not statistically significant. Bhardwaj and 
colleagues46 reported time to response to commands, commenting that this was comparable in the two 
groups but not reporting any numerical data.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting
Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported by only one of the trials included in the current 
systematic review, the trial by Liao and colleagues.51 There was no difference between patients in the 
BIS and standard clinical monitoring groups in terms of nausea [n=5 (10%); n=6 (11%), respectively, 
p=0.95] or vomiting [n=2 (4%); n=3 (6%), respectively, p=0.88]. Postoperative nausea and vomiting 
was not reported by the Cochrane BIS review.34
Emergence delirium
Liao and colleagues51 also reported the incidence of emergence delirium, as measured by the Paediatric 
Anaesthetic Emergence Delirium (PAED) instrument (noted to be valid and reliable by the authors, 
reference cited). Assessment took place by a trained observer in the PACU every 5 minutes after awakening 
for 30 minutes. The highest score during this period was used in the final PAED score. (NB. A description 
of the instrument and what the scores mean is not given.) There was no statistically significant difference 
between BIS and standard clinical practice monitored patients [median (interquartile range) score 18 
(14–16); 15 (13–15), respectively, p=0.94].
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction
The only trial to report postoperative cognitive dysfunction was that of Chan and colleagues, who studied 
an elderly patient population.47 Cognitive dysfunction was assessed by a battery of eight neuropsychology 
tests before and at 1 and 3 weeks after surgery (no information on the tests reported). POCD was 
confirmed when two or more test parameters or the combined z-value >1.96 (no further information 
given). There was no statistically significant difference between BIS and standard clinical monitoring in 
rates of dysfunction at 1 week post surgery [146 (32.5%); 177 (39.1%), respectively, p=0.07]. However, 
the difference between groups become significant at 3 months post surgery [36 (8.1%); 54 (12%), 
respectively, p=0.03; OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.4)]. Caution is advised as this trial47 was reported in a 
conference abstract therefore detail of its characteristics are lacking, prohibiting a thorough appraisal of 
its methodological quality. As the abstract was published in 2010 a full publication potentially may be 
available in the near future.
Mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke
One trial, by Leslie and colleagues,50 reported stroke, myocardial infarction and mortality for all surviving 
and available patients 30 days post operation (Table 14). This is a long-term follow-up (median=4.1 years) 
publication of the B-Aware trial79 in patients classified at higher risk of intraoperative awareness because 
of factors such as type of surgery (e.g. high-risk cardiac surgery), health status (e.g. cardiovascular 
impairment) and lifestyle (e.g. heavy alcohol intake). [NB. A publication of the short-term results of this 
trial by Myles and colleagues79 (primary outcome: intraoperative awareness) was included in the Cochrane 
BIS review.34 Results of this trial are presented earlier in this report.]

Summary of Bispectral Index assessment
z Six trials included in this systematic review measured the impact of BIS monitoring on explicit 
intraoperative awareness. Four of these trials reported few or no cases of awareness; however, they 
were not statistically powered to detect this outcome. The other two trials were powered to detect 
awareness and we added them to the meta-analysis from the Cochrane BIS review (restricted to 
patients considered to be at higher risk of awareness). The pooled Peto’s OR was 0.45 (95% CI 0.25 to 
0.81), in favour of BIS. However, there was statistically significant heterogeneity and a non-significant 
difference in the subgroup of trials in which only inhaled GA was used.
z Three trials included in this systematic review reported changes in sevoflurane consumption, all of 
which were statistically significantly lower with BIS monitoring. We updated the Cochrane metaanalysis with one of these trials, producing a pooled mean difference of –0.15 (95% CI –0.25 to 
–0.06) MAC equivalents in favour of BIS (with unexplained statistically significant heterogeneity).
z Three trials included in this systematic review reported changes in propofol consumption. In two of 
these the maintenance dose was higher in BIS-monitored patients than standard clinical monitoring, 
but not statistically significant. In the third trial propofol consumption was lower for BIS. We 
updated the Cochrane meta-analysis with one of these trials, producing a pooled mean difference 
of –1.33mg/kg/minute (95% CI –1.82 to –0.84mg/kg/minute), in favour of BIS (with unexplained 
statistically significant heterogeneity).
z Five trials included in this systematic review reported time to discharge from the PACU, all of which 
appeared to be secondary outcomes. In all trials time to discharge was statistically significantly shorter 
in BIS-monitored patients, with mean differences in the range of 6.7–30 minutes. The Cochrane 
BIS review did a meta-analysis of the outcome ‘PACU stay’ (including time to arrival in the PACU, 
time to discharge from the PACU, and length of stay in the PACU). The pooled mean difference was 
–7.63 minutes (95% CI –12.50 to –2.76 minutes) in favour of BIS (with unexplained statistically 
significant heterogeneity).
z Five trials included in this systematic review measured time to tracheal extubation, as a secondary 
outcome. Extubation times were shorter for BIS-monitored patients compared with standard 
clinical monitoring by as much as 5 minutes, and as little as 0.5 minutes, but not always 
statistically significant. The pooled mean difference in the Cochrane review for this outcome was 
–2.87 minutes (95% CI –3.74 to –1.99 minutes) in favour of BIS (with unexplained statistically 
significant heterogeneity).
z Three trials included in the current systematic review reported time to eye opening as a secondary 
outcome. Times were shorter in BIS-monitored patients, although by modest duration (up to 
1 minute), and there were no statistically significant differences between groups. The pooled 
mean difference in the Cochrane review for this outcome was –2.14 minutes (95% CI –2.99 to 
–1.29 minutes), indicating a statistically significant difference in favour of BIS (with unexplained 
statistically significant heterogeneity).
z Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported by only one trial. Incidence of nausea and vomiting 
was low (around 10% or less) and there was no statistically significant difference between groups.
z Only one trial reported the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. There was no statistically 
significant difference between groups in rates of dysfunction at 1 week post surgery. By 3 months 
post surgery, incidence had fallen to around 8–12%, with a significant difference in favour of BIS. This 
study was reported only as a conference abstract and it is not clear whether or not this outcome was 
adequately statistically powered.
z Longer-term postoperative outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction and mortality were reported by 
only one trial (median of 4.1 years post operation), as secondary outcomes. Mortality was lower in BISmonitored patients, although not statistically significant. Incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction 
was similar between groups.
z In summary, BIS monitoring was associated with overall lower rates of explicit intraoperative awareness 
(limited to patients classified at higher risk of awareness, and non-significant effects in the subgroup

of patients receiving only inhaled anaesthesia), lower general anaesthetic consumption and shorter 
recovery times (e.g. PACU discharge, time to extubation, time to eye opening). Generally, there 
was little difference between BIS and standard clinical monitoring in complications arising from 
excessive anaesthetic dose (e.g. nausea, vomiting and cognitive dysfunction). Caution is advised in the 
interpretation of the results as not all outcomes appeared to be adequately statistically powered, and 
there was significant heterogeneity. There was much variation between the trials in terms of patient 
characteristics and surgical procedures.
Characteristics of included studies: E-Entropy
Study populations
Two of the seven E-entropy trials were conducted with children, with median age 4–6 years (range 
3–12 years).54,56 The remaining five trials were in adults, with the mean age of patients ranging from 
33 years55 to 69 years.58 The trials varied in their sex composition. One trial was entirely on adult women,55
whereas another trial was almost entirely on young boys (the trial included 12% girls in one study arm 
only).56 One trial included more elderly men than women (men–women ratio approximately 4:1),58
whereas another trial included more middle-aged women than men (male–female ratio approximately 
1:3). The remaining three E-Entropy trials included a more even balance of males and females.54,61,62 In 
all seven trials the mean body weight of patients appeared to be within the normal range, with mean 
weights ranging from 16kg to 22kg in the child studies and from 65kg to 82kg in the adult studies. One 
trial was conducted at six centres in three countries (Finland, Sweden and Norway).57 The remaining trials 
appeared to be single-centre studies (not explicitly stated in two trials) that were each carried out in one 
country: Germany,55,62 France,61 India,56 South Korea54 and Taiwan.58 None of the E-Entropy trials reported 
the ethnicity of their participants.
Four of the E-Entropy trials were in patients undergoing a mix of abdominal, urological, gynaecological 
and/or orthopaedic surgical procedures,56,61,62 which also included breast and thyroid surgery in one trial.57
One trial specifically involved children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.54 Another trial was 
carried out specifically in women undergoing laparoscopic gynaecological procedures.55 The remaining 
trial focused on total knee replacement surgery.58 Only one of the E-Entropy trials was clearly limited to day 
surgery patients.56 None of the seven trials identified any specific risk factors for intraoperative awareness 
among their populations and none reported whether or not patients had any comorbidities that affect 
EEG monitoring. However, all the E-Entropy trials stated that they excluded patients with any history of 
cerebrovascular and/or neurological disorders. The ASA grade of patients was I–II in four of the trials,54–56,58
and I-III in the remaining three trials.57,61,62 The proportion of grade III patients varied by study groups 
within these three trials, ranging 1–3%,57 11–15%61 and 3–26%.62
Technologies
Four of the seven E-Entropy trials reported that they used the E-Entropy module manufactured by GE 
Healthcare,55,57,61,62 and six of the trials reported that they used the S/5TM monitor (Datex-Ohmeda).54–58,61
Very little other information about the modules and monitors was provided: only one trial mentioned the 
version of the S/5 monitor used (Avance),56 and none of the studies stated the version of the E-Entropy 
algorithm software used.
The target E-Entropy values during anaesthesia maintenance were mostly in the range 40–65. Four trials 
specified target ranges for state entropy, which were either 40–6054,55 or 45–65.56,57 A further trial specified 
a specific state entropy target of 50.62 The remaining two trials specified target ranges for both state 
entropy and response entropy, which were 35–4558 and 40–60.61 Four of the trials that specified target 
values for state entropy permitted an increase in the state entropy value during the last 15 minutes of 
surgery. During this period, the target values were specified as 60,62 65–70,56 ‘ideally 65, but not >70’57
and ‘>60 acceptable’.55 In addition to the target values of state and response entropy, three trials also 
specified target values of the difference between response entropy and state entropy: these were <10 in 
two trials55,57 and 5–10 in the remaining trial.58

Two of the seven E-Entropy trials reported that E-Entropy monitoring for anaesthesia delivery was done 
in conjunction with monitoring haemodynamic changes. One of these trials specified that heart rate and 
blood pressure were to be kept within ±20% of their baseline (preoperative visit) values.57 The second trial 
stated that E-Entropy was used to guide anaesthesia unless (unspecified) haemodynamic changes of 30% 
persisted for >5 minutes.
In addition to titrating anaesthesia to maintain the specified target entropy values, two trials specified 
corrective action if target values were exceeded. One trial specified intermittent provision of a sufentanil 
bolus if the response entropy–state entropy difference exceeded 10 for >2 minutes.61 The other trial 
specified administration of a propofol bolus if the state entropy value increased suddenly above 65.
In all seven of the E-Entropy trials, the E-Entropy monitoring was initiated in the operating theatre. Two 
trials stated57 or implied58 that E-Entropy monitoring was started before anaesthesia induction, and two 
trials stated that E-Entropy monitoring began after anaesthesia induction.55,56 The remaining three trials did 
not report whether E-Entropy monitoring commenced before or after anaesthesia induction.
Comparators
Standard clinical monitoring was based on blood pressure and heart rate in three trials.54,57,61 As well as 
blood pressure and heart rate, a further two trials also monitored sweating, lacrimation or movement,62 or 
coughing, chewing, grimacing or purposeful movement.55 The remaining trials monitored heart rate, mean 
arterial pressure and lacrimation, and either movement in response to surgical stimulation,56 or sweating, 
flushing or wrinkling of frontal facial muscles, together with monitoring the end-tidal anaesthetic 
concentration.58 Quantitative thresholds for the clinical parameters that were used to guide anaesthesia 
titration were specified in five of the seven E-Entropy trials.54–58
In addition to titrating anaesthesia according to the clinical parameters, in one trial58 the ETAC was 
adjusted to maintain mean arterial pressure and heart rate fluctuations to within ±30% of the baseline 
values. In another trial, i.v. fentanyl was given if clinical parameters were not stabilised after increasing the 
anaesthetic concentration to 1.3 MAC.56
Anaesthetic agents and protocols
Three of the seven trials used i.v. propofol for anaesthesia induction.55,61,62 One trial used i.v. propofol 
with alfentanil analgesic for induction.57 A further trial employed propofol if patients had an i.v. line, but 
otherwise used inhaled sevoflurane for induction.56 The remaining two trials both used inhaled sevoflurane 
for induction in all their patients.54,58
For maintenance of anaesthesia, three trials used inhaled sevoflurane,54,58,61 and one trial used inhaled 
isoflurane.56 The remaining trials used i.v. delivery of propofol,62 propofol and remifentanil,55 or propofol 
and alfentanil analgesic.57
Overall, two trials used the same inhaled agent (sevoflurane) for both induction and maintenance;54,58
three trials used i.v. agents (all included propofol) for both induction and maintenance;55,57,62 and two trials 
used an i.v. anaesthetic for induction followed by an inhaled anaesthetic for maintenance.56,61
Regional anaesthesia was only clearly reported in one of the E-Entropy trials, in which a caudal block was 
placed with bupivacaine.56 Two trials stated that regional anaesthesia was not used.58,61 One trial referred 
to regional anaesthesia in the publication abstract but did not provide details.62 The remaining three trials 
did not refer to regional anaesthesia.
One of the E-Entropy trials stated that analgesics were not used during induction or maintenance of 
anaesthesia, although ketorolac was used after anaesthetic cessation.54 One trial used i.v. sufentanil 
during induction and maintenance, with morphine during the last 15 minutes of surgery, followed by 
paracetamol, nefopam or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs postoperatively.61 Two trials used fentanyl

during anaesthesia maintenance. Of these, one also used fentanyl and lidocaine during induction,58
whereas the other used fentanyl postoperatively, according to the patient’s pain score.56 One trial used 
piritramide during the last 15 minutes of surgery only.55 The remaining two trials did not refer to analgesia 
either during induction, maintenance or post surgery.57,62
Premedication was reported in five of the E-Entropy trials. The agents used were oral hydroxyzine,61 oral 
midazolam alone,62 oral midazolam with a benzodiazepine,55 i.v. midazolam54 and oral diazepam (in five of 
six study centres).57 The remaining two trials did not specify whether or not premedication was used.
All of the E-Entropy studies except one56 used muscle relaxants. The muscle relaxants were 
atracurium,58,61,62 rocuronium54,55 or were not specified a priori but were chosen at the anaesthetist’s 
discretion when needed.57
In five trials anaesthesia was administered in the operating theatre.56–58,61,62 The two remaining trials did 
not report where anaesthetics were administered.
The mean duration of anaesthesia was reported in six studies and ranged from 64.3 minutes for 
tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy procedures in children54 to 190.8 minutes for general surgical procedures 
in adults.61 The remaining study reported median duration of anaesthesia which was 68–72 minutes 
(range 32–180 minutes) for lower abdominal or urological surgical procedures in children.56
Duration of the surgery itself was reported less precisely than the duration of anaesthesia. Surgical duration 
was described as a minimum of 1 hour,55,61 approximately 1.5 hours,58 a mean of 41.4–48.1 minutes,54 or 
a median of 29–30 minutes (range 15–95 minutes)56 or was not reported.57,62
The training and experience of the anaesthetists in E-Entropy module use was reported in four of the 
seven E-Entropy trials.55,57,61,62 One trial stated that anaesthetists were allowed to accustom themselves 
to the use of E-Entropy monitoring for 3 weeks, and all participants had substantial previous experience 
with EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors.57 In the remaining three trials the descriptions provided 
for training or experience were only superficial: ‘more than 3 months of routine use’;61 ‘experienced 
anaesthesiologist’;62 and ‘anaesthesia was supervised by an experienced staff anaesthetist’.55
Outcomes
Anaesthetic consumption was the primary outcome in four of the seven E-Entropy studies 
(Table 15).54,58,61,62 The method of assessing anaesthetic consumption was by weighing the vaporiser,61
measuring the end-tidal concentration,54 using data from the S/5 anaesthetic delivery system58 or was not 
reported.62 In the remaining three trials the primary outcomes were time to eye opening55,56 and time to 
response to a verbal command,57 after cessation of anaesthesia.
The most frequently reported outcomes overall for which quantitative results were reported were: 
anaesthetic consumption (a primary outcome in four trials54,58,61,62 and a secondary outcome in three 
trials55–57); entropy values (a secondary outcome in all seven trials); time to eye opening (a primary outcome 
in two trials55,56 and a secondary outcome in four trials54,57,61,62); intraoperative awareness (a secondary 
outcome in all except one trial56); haemodynamic profiles (a secondary outcome in all except one trial62); 
time to extubation (a secondary outcome in three trials54,57,61); and postoperative pain (a secondary 
outcome in two trials55,56). Other outcomes that were reported quantitatively in one trial each were 
postoperative pain, analgesia consumption, PONV, time to recovery based on Aldrete or Steward scores, 
time spent with adverse haemodynamic profiles, probability of emergence and (in a study with children) 
parental satisfaction. Some of the trials provided only a narrative report of outcomes. These outcomes 
were not extracted from the primary trials as no estimates of effect or variance could be determined. For 
example, two trials57,58 stated narratively that pain scores, analgesic use and incidence of PONV did not 
differ between E-Entropy and clinical practice groups but no quantitative results were reported for these 
outcomes and so these are not included in Table 15.

Three of the six trials that measured intraoperative awareness employed versions of standard patient 
questionnaires published by Brice and colleagues24 (two studies57,61) or Nordström and colleagues96 (one 
study62). The three remaining trials stated only that intraoperative recall was assessed by independent 
nurses;54 patients were questioned about memory and awareness;55 or the level of awareness was 
assessed.58 Four trials reported the timing of the intraoperative awareness assessments, which were 
24 hours after surgery,55 on the first postoperative day,62 in the PACU and on the first day post surgery,57
or on the first and third days post surgery.61 The remaining two trials did not specify the timing of the 
awareness outcome assessments. No further details of the methods for assessing intraoperative awareness 
were reported.
Length of follow-up was relatively short in all the trials, being 1 day post surgery (for intraoperative 
awareness) in three trials,54,55,57 3 days post surgery (for intraoperative awareness) in three trials,58,61,62 and 
only 2 hours post surgery (for pain assessment) in the remaining trial.56 The duration of follow-up would 
not have been adequate for detecting delayed onset of awareness recall, which may occur more than 
1 week post surgery.
Assessment of outcomes: E-Entropy
Intraoperative awareness
Only one case of intraoperative awareness was reported in the six trials that measured this outcome 
(Table 16). This was experienced by an adult woman in the standard clinical practice group of the trial by 
Gruenewald and colleagues.55 It should be noted that the sample sizes of these studies may have been too 
small to detect rare events such as intraoperative awareness.
Anaesthetic consumption
Four trials that assessed volatile anaesthetic consumption either as the primary outcome for 
sevoflurane54,58,61 or a secondary outcome for isoflurane,56 all demonstrated statistically significant 
reductions in the E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia group compared with the standard clinical monitoring 
group (Table 17). In the trial by Aime and colleagues,61 the rates of sevoflurane consumption, but not the 
total amount consumed, were significantly lower in the E-Entropy group. In this trial61 the difference in 
sevoflurane consumption rates between groups was more pronounced when the consumption rate was 
normalised to patients’ body weight.
Three trials that assessed consumption of i.v. anaesthetics55,57,62 showed mixed results (Table 17). Propofol 
consumption in the E-Entropy group was statistically significantly lower than in the standard clinical 
practice group in two trials that assessed anaesthetic consumption as secondary outcomes,55,57 but not in

a trial that assessed anaesthetic consumption as the primary outcome.62 Remifentanil consumption was 
significantly higher in the E-Entropy group in one trial that assessed this as a secondary outcome,55 but did 
not differ between groups in the trial that assessed this as the primary outcome.62 Alfentanil consumption, 
assessed as a secondary outcome in one trial, did not differ significantly between the study groups.57
The trials that assessed anaesthetic consumption measured outcomes in different ways, expressed their 
outcomes in different units (total consumption or rates) and, as noted above, differed in the patient 
populations that they included. These differences would preclude the meaningful pooling of the 
anaesthetic consumption outcomes that were reported (Table 17).
Time to recovery from anaesthesia
Results are summarised in Table 18 for the trials that reported time to eye opening;54–57,61,62
extubation;54,57,61 spontaneous breathing;57 recovery of orientation;54,57 response to commands;57 recovery 
defined by Aldrete score;54 and recovery defined by modified Steward score.56
Time to eye opening was significantly shorter, by approximately 2–4 minutes, in the E-Entropy group 
than in the standard clinical practice group in two of six trials.56,57 One of these assessed this as a primary 
outcome in children56 and the other assessed it as a secondary outcome in adults.57 In the remaining four 
trials54,55,61,62 (one of which specified this as a primary outcome55) the time to eye opening did not differ 
between the study groups (Table 18).
Time to extubation (a secondary outcome) was shorter, by approximately 3–4 minutes, in the E-Entropy 
group than in the standard clinical monitoring group in all three trials that assessed this outcome.54,57,61
The differences were stated as statistically significant in two of the trials54,57 but statistical significance was 
not reported in the remaining trial61 (see Table 18).
The times to spontaneous breathing (a secondary outcome);57 recovery of orientation (a secondary 
outcome);54,57 response to commands (a primary outcome);57 and recovery defined by an Aldrete score of 
at least 9 (a secondary outcome)54 were each significantly shorter in the E-Entropy group than the standard 
clinical practice group in the two trials54,57 that reported these outcomes (see Table 18). However, the time 
to recovery as defined by reaching a Steward score of 6 (a secondary outcome) did not differ between the 
study groups in one trial that assessed this outcome.56
Outcomes related to postanaesthesia care unit stay
The time from discharge from the operating room to the PACU was shorter by approximately 3–4 minutes 
in the E-Entropy group than the standard clinical practice group in the two trials that monitored these 
outcomes56,57 (Table 19). The differences in both trials were statistically significant, although only 
marginally so in one of the trials.56
The time to discharge from the PACU was shorter in the E-Entropy group than the standard clinical 
monitoring in the only trial that assessed this outcome,57 although the difference was not statistically 
significant. The time from which discharge from the PACU was measured was not reported, however, 
which makes interpretation of this outcome unclear57 (see Table 19).
Postoperative pain
Two trials reported postoperative pain, using different rating scales (Table 20). Pain was assessed as a score 
on a 0–10 scale55 or using the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Score (CHEOPS).56 Pain scores 
were significantly lower in the E-Entropy group than standard clinical practice for the adult population.55
In the paediatric population, the CHEOPS scores were significantly lower in the E-Entropy group at 60, 90 
and 120 minutes after arrival in the PACU but not at 30 minutes after arrival.56

Analgesic consumption
Only one E-Entropy trial assessed analgesic consumption.61 Consumption of sufentanil was slightly lower in 
the E-Entropy group than the standard clinical monitoring group during both induction and maintenance 
of anaesthesia, but the differences were not statistically significant (Table 21).
Postoperative nausea and vomiting
One trial that assessed PONV after arrival in the recovery room55 reported similar frequencies in the 
E-Entropy and standard clinical monitoring that did not differ significantly (Table 22).
In addition to the outcomes reported above, the E-Entropy trials reported that the following outcomes did 
not differ between E-Entropy and standard clinical practice groups (data not extracted): patient satisfaction 
scores;55 parent satisfaction scores for children at 24 hours post surgery;55 time spent by patients with 
adverse haemodynamic profiles;61 and treatment for haemodynamic events.61

Summary of E-Entropy assessment
z Six trials monitored intraoperative awareness in adults and children receiving different volatile and i.v. 
anaesthetics. Only one case of awareness occurred, in the standard clinical practice group of one trial. 
However, sample sizes were relatively small in these trials.
z Four trials monitored consumption of volatile anaesthetic (three monitored sevoflurane as a primary 
outcome, one monitored isoflurane as a secondary outcome). Consumption was significantly lower in 
the E-Entropy monitoring than standard clinical practice groups of all trials, with the proviso that in 
one of these trials the difference in sevoflurane consumption was statistically significant for rates of 
consumption but not for total anaesthetic dose.
z Three trials that monitored consumption of i.v. anaesthetic yielded mixed results. Trials that monitored 
consumption of propofol, remifentanil and alfentanil as primary outcomes found no statistically 
significant differences between the study groups. However, significantly lower consumption of 
propofol and remifentanil in the E-Entropy group was reported in trials that assessed these as 
secondary outcomes.
z Time to eye opening was significantly shorter in the E-Entropy group than the standard clinical practice 
group in two of six trials, one of which assessed this as a primary outcome, but did not differ in the 
remaining four trials.
z Time to extubation (a secondary outcome) was shorter in the E-Entropy group than the standard 
practice group in all three trials that assessed this outcome. The differences were stated as statistically 
significant in two of the trials but statistical significance was not reported in the remaining trial.
z The times to spontaneous breathing (a secondary outcome), recovery of orientation (a secondary 
outcome), response to commands (a primary outcome) and recovery defined by an Aldrete score of 
at least 9 (a secondary outcome) were each significantly shorter in the E-Entropy group than in the 
standard clinical practice group. Except for time to orientation (two trials), these outcomes were 
reported by only one trial each. The time to recovery as defined by reaching a Steward score of 6 (a 
secondary outcome) did not differ between the study groups in one trial that assessed this outcome.
z The limited evidence available (from two trials which assessed secondary outcomes only) suggests 
that E-Entropy monitoring favours shorter time to discharge to and from the PACU, but it is unclear 
whether or not the time gains are clinically important.
z No firm conclusions can be drawn about effects of E-Entropy monitoring on postoperative pain 
because the only two trials that assessed this used different rating scales, and the effect of E-Entropy 
monitoring on pain scores was temporally variable in one of the trials. Analgesic consumption and 
frequency of PONV were assessed in one trial each and did not differ between the E-Entropy and 
standard clinical practice groups. Postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and analgesic consumption 
were assessed only as secondary outcomes in these trials.
z In summary, compared with standard clinical monitoring, E-Entropy monitoring favoured: lower 
consumption of volatile anaesthetics and some, but not all, i.v. anaesthetics; and shorter times to 
recovery and discharge to and from the PACU, assessed by various measures. E-Entropy monitoring 
had no consistent impact on other outcomes that were monitored, including intraoperative 
awareness, but the small sample sizes in the trials may not have provided adequate statistical power 
to detect meaningful differences in rare events. Pooled effect estimates would not be estimable 
reliably for these outcomes, because of the uniqueness of the individual studies (which included 
different populations in terms of age, sex and ethnicity, undergoing different surgical procedures) and 
differences between the trials in the way that outcomes were assessed and reported. Also, the majority 
of the outcomes were secondary and may not have been adequately powered statistically to detect 
clinically relevant differences between the E-Entropy and standard clinical practice groups.
Characteristics of included studies: Narcotrend
Study populations
In all trials of Narcotrend, the study population was adults (mean age 40–50 years) and 33–50% of 
participants were males for the three studies reporting sex. Mean weight ranged from 60kg to about

84kg. All studies appeared to be single-centred studies with three conducted in Germany and one in 
China.59 Ethnicity of participants was not reported in any study.
The type of surgery was minor orthopaedic surgery,63,64 microwave coagulation for liver cancer,59 and all 
kinds of elective surgery, including surgery for ‘malignoma’ and peripheral vascular surgery.60 No trial 
reported risk factors for awareness. Comorbidities were reported in two trials:59,60 hypertension was 
reported in both of these and one trial60 also reported cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes type II, asthma and 
miscellaneous comorbidities. Three trials included the number of participants with ASA grade I, II or III, 
with most grade II and fewest grade III; the fourth trial59 reported only that participants were ASA grade II 
or III.
Technologies
The Narcotrend monitor with software version 2.0 AF was used in three trials,60,63,64 whereas in the fourth 
trial59 no details of the software version are reported. Two trials report using the MonitorTechnik (Germany) 
with Blue Sensor (Denmark).59,60
The Narcotrend target value during maintenance anaesthesia was D0 and then adjusted to C1 15 minutes 
before the expected end of surgery in two studies,63,64 and D2–E0 during maintenance adjusted to D0–D1
10 minutes before the end of surgery in one study.59 In the fourth study60 the Narcotrend target value was 
D2–E0 with no further details given. The two studies59,60 using Narcotrend target values of D2–E0 therefore 
used deeper levels of anaesthesia and hypnosis than the other two studies. Monitoring started in the 
operating theatre in two studies,63,64 in the computed tomography department where surgery took place 
in one study59 and was not reported in the fourth study.60
Only one trial59 explicitly stated that observational indices of electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate and 
mean arterial blood pressure were continuously monitored alongside Narcotrend scores. The other three 
studies did not explicitly state whether or not standard clinical monitoring took place in addition to 
Narcotrend. However, as signs of inadequate anaesthesia were based on vital signs and clinical parameters 
it can be assumed that it did. For example, signs of inadequate anaesthesia were hypertension, tachycardia 
or patient movement, eye opening, swallowing, grimacing, lacrimation and sweating.63,64 Vital clinical 
parameters of heart rate, pulse oximetry readings, rectal temperature and end-expiratory carbon dioxide 
were continuously measured in the fourth study.60
Comparators
Standard clinical continuous monitoring included heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, oxygen saturation and end-tidal concentrations of carbon dioxide63,64 plus end-tidal desflurane64 and 
heart rate, pulse oximetry readings, rectal temperature and end-expiratory carbon dioxide.60 In one study59
heart rate, blood pressure and body movement were used for monitoring.
Anaesthetic agents and protocols
Three studies used total i.v. anaesthesia: two60,63 used propofol–remifentanil for induction and 
maintenance anaesthesia; one used propofol–fentanyl induction and propofol anaesthesia maintenance.59
The fourth study used desflurane–remifentanil anaesthesia.64 Regional anaesthesia was not reported in 
any of the studies. Premedication was used in three studies in the form of midazolam60,64 and diazepam.63
Analgesia included metamizol with sodium chloride,63,64 fentanyl59 and novaminsulfone, piritramide or 
morphine.60 Muscle relaxants used included atracurium,64 cisatracurium63 and rocuronium.60
Mean duration of anaesthesia ranged from 113 to 125 minutes,64 from 108 to 127 minutes,63 from 88 
to 91 minutes59 and from 105 to 111 minutes60 in the four trials, with no significant differences between 
groups within each study. Duration of surgery was not reported in any study. Three studies60,63,64 reported 
that all patients were anaesthetised by the same experienced anaesthesiologist, one of which mentions 
specific experience in Narcotrend.63 No details are given for the length of experience/training of the 
anaesthetist in the fourth study.59

Outcomes
The primary outcome (statistically powered) specified in three trials was time to eye opening63,64 and time 
to extubation60 (Table 23). Time to tracheal extubation was also an outcome in two other studies.63,64
All four studies59,60,63,64 report anaesthetic consumption and intraoperative awareness. Other reported 
outcomes include time to arousal time59 (defined as the time between cessation of drugs and the patient 
being able to open their eyes on command) and time to recovery of orientation (defined as the time 
between a patient opening their eyes on command and the restoration of orientation).59 Two studies63,64
report time to discharge to the PACU and two report PONV.59,60
Assessment of outcomes: Narcotrend
Intraoperative awareness
No patients in any of the trials of Narcotrend reported intraoperative awareness as explicit memory during 
anaesthesia, although two patients (8%) receiving Narcotrend anaesthetic monitoring recalled dreaming 
during anaesthesia.60
Anaesthetic consumption
Three studies report consumption of propofol; two59,63 found a statistically significant reduction in the 
group receiving Narcotrend monitoring compared with standard clinical monitoring, whereas the third60
found no difference in consumption between groups (Table 24).
Three studies reported remifentanil consumption and all found no statistically significant difference 
between Narcotrend and standard clinical monitoring.60,63,64
Desflurane consumption per patient was not different between the Narcotrend monitoring group and 
standard anaesthetic practice, although desflurane consumption per patient per minute was statistically 
significantly lower in the Narcotrend group.64
Time to arrival at postanaesthetia care unit
Two studies reported time to arrival at PACU and found statistically significantly shorter times in the 
Narcotrend monitoring group compared with the standard care monitoring group63,64 (Table 25).

Time to eye opening
Time to eye opening was the primary outcome in two trials and results between the studies differ 
(Table 26). One trial64 reported no statistically significant difference between Narcotrend monitoring and 
standard clinical monitoring, whereas the other trial63 reported a statistically significant reduction in time 
to eye opening of 5.9 minutes in the Narcotrend group compared with standard care.
Time to extubation
Time to tracheal extubation was the primary outcome in one study60 and no difference was found 
between monitoring of anaesthesia by Narcotrend and standard clinical monitoring (Table 27). In contrast,

Analgesic consumption
Two studies59,60 reported consumption of pain-relieving drugs and found no statistically significant 
differences between Narcotrend and standard care monitoring groups.
Summary of Narcotrend assessment
z Four trials59,60,63,64 monitored intraoperative awareness in adults receiving different volatile and i.v. 
anaesthetics; no patients reported explicit memory during anaesthesia although two patients receiving 
Narcotrend monitoring recalled dreaming during anaesthesia.
z Three studies59,60,63 that measured consumption of propofol reported different results; significantly 
lower consumption was found in the Narcotrend group in two studies, whereas no difference was 
reported between groups in the third study.
z Three studies60,63,64 found no significant difference between groups in remifentanil or 
desflurane consumption.
z Two studies63,64 reported time to arrival at PACU and found statistically significantly shorter times in the 
Narcotrend group compared with standard care.
z Time to eye opening was the primary outcome in two studies63,64 which yielded conflicting results; one 
reported a significantly lower time in the Narcotrend group than with standard care and the other 
reported no difference between groups.
z Time to extubation was the primary outcome in one study60 which found no difference between 
groups; two other studies63,64 that reported this measure as a secondary outcome found significantly 
shorter time to extubation with Narcotrend monitoring than with standard care.
z Time to arousal and duration of orientation recovery were reported to be shorter with Narcotrend 
monitoring compared with standard care in the one study59 reporting these outcomes.
z Results suggest that there are no differences between groups in PONV after surgery or analgesic 
consumption from the two studies that report these outcomes.
z In summary, Narcotrend monitoring compared with standard practice during minor orthopaedic 
surgery resulted in shorter recovery times (eye opening, arrival at PACU and time to extubation) and 
reduced propofol consumption. It was also associated with lower doses of propofol and shorter 
recovery during TIVA with propofol and fentanyl in liver cancer microwave coagulation. Narcotrendassisted propofol–remifentanil anaesthesia did not reduce propofol or remifentanil consumption or 
time to extubation compared with standard clinical assessment in patients undergoing a range of 
elective surgery. The majority of the outcomes reported in the studies of Narcotrend were secondary 
and may not have been adequately powered statistically to detect clinically relevant differences. Also, 
the trial results are applicable to the specific patient groups included in the studies for the type of 
anaesthesia used and are not generalisable beyond this.
Results of systematic review of cost-effectiveness
The aim of this section is to assess the current state of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring compared with standard clinical monitoring through a systematic review of the 
literature. The methods used for the search strategy are described in Identification of studies, and inclusion 
criteria are shown in Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included studies were evaluated for their quality and 
for generalisability to the UK. This section concludes a statement on the current state of evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring and a discussion of key issues arising from included 
studies. The full data extraction forms for included studies are shown in Appendix 6.
Quantity and quality of research available
A total of 134 potentially relevant references were identified in the cost-effectiveness searches. Of these, 
the full text of 14 papers was retrieved and one study97 met all of the a priori inclusion criteria. A summary

of the selection process and the reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure 5 – a list of excluded studies 
can be found in Appendix 7.
The excluded studies were predominantly cost analyses, completed as part of BIS trials, which reported the 
difference in drug cost between the BIS and control arms. An update search, conducted in February 2012, 
identified six possible studies. These were all excluded on the basis of title and abstract as either not being 
full economic evaluations or did not include the specified interventions and comparators. The included 
study was simple calculation models of BIS monitoring compared with standard treatment. The completed 
checklist for quality assessment of the included study is shown in Table 29.
Characteristics and results of included studies
The included study was a simple calculation model of BIS monitoring compared with standard treatment. 
Characteristics of the study are shown in Table 30 and a full data extraction form can be found in 
Appendix 6.
The included study employed a relevant comparator and similar patient group to the UK NHS. However, 
the study was of poor quality, with limited information reported on the methods, and sources used for the 
model parameters. Assumptions were not justified. The study did not include health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) or investigate uncertainty through sensitivity analyses.
Abenstein97 used a simple calculation model to compare GA with BIS monitoring to GA for high- and 
general-risk patients. The cost per avoided intraoperative recall is:

The cost per patient of BIS monitoring consisted of the cost of the sensors (US$17 each) and the cost of 
the monitor. The monitor was assumed to cost US$9000 and have a lifespan of 7 years, and be used by 
four patients per day for 300 days per year (US$1.07 per patient). The incidence of intraoperative recall 
for patients of general risk was taken from a prospective study by Ekman and colleagues98 who reported a 
recall rate of 0.04% (GA with BIS) compared with 0.18% (GA). The cost per avoided intraoperative recall 
was US$11,294. Abenstein97 estimated the cost per avoided intraoperative recall for high-risk patients to 
be US$4410 per avoided intraoperative recall. They used estimates of the incidence of intraoperative recall

which gave a reduction in incidence of intraoperative recall from 0.59% to 0.18%. The authors concluded 
that the general use of BIS monitoring does not seem warranted and appears not to be cost-effective. 
Summary
One cost-effectiveness analysis97 was included in this systematic review, which compared BIS with standard 
clinical monitoring, using a simple calculation model. The study concluded that addition of BIS to GA was 
not cost-effective. However, the results and conclusions should be viewed with caution because of the 
poor methodological and reporting quality.
Model structure, model parameterisation and results of 
economic evaluation
Description of decision-analytic model
Overview
A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring, in accordance with the scope of the appraisal 
issued by NICE. Separate analyses are presented for each of the three included technologies (the included 
technologies are not compared with each other).
The model was structured to include outcomes identified in the scope issued by NICE for this appraisal, 
where suitable data on the relative effectiveness of included technologies was identified in our systematic 
review of patient outcomes (see Results of systematic review of patient outcomes). The model evaluates 
costs (UK pounds using a 2011 price base) from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. 
Outcomes in the model are expressed as QALY. Both costs and outcomes are discounted using a 3.5% 
annual discount rate, in line with current guidance.38,39
Modelling approach and model structure
The model developed for this assessment was a simple decision tree, which accounted for patients’ risk of 
experiencing short-term anaesthetic-related complications (such as PONV) and more serious complications 
that may be associated with risk of morbidity or mortality. These were included, in addition to a risk of 
experiencing intraoperative awareness, see Figure 6.
Each of the short-term anaesthetic-related complications could be associated with additional treatment 
costs (such as antiemetic medication for patients experiencing PONV, whereas for patients experiencing 
POCD there may be in-hospital costs of managing the condition, additional days of hospital stay and, 
for longer-term cases, additional costs of managing the condition following discharge). No direct costconsequences for intraoperative awareness are included in the model. However, it is assumed that a 
proportion of patients who experience awareness will suffer psychological symptoms arising from the 
awareness episode and that a proportion of those will develop PTSD and may seek treatment.
We assumed that monitoring of basic clinical signs, including blood pressure and heart rate (mandatory 
worldwide), would be common components to standard clinical monitoring and to depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring using EEG devices (as discussed in Description of technologies under assessment) and, 
therefore, these have not been costed in the model. The key cost components identified for the standard 
clinical monitoring branch of the model are the costs of anaesthesia, costs of anaesthesia-related 
complications and costs of managing long-term sequelae of intraoperative awareness, with baseline 
levels (unit costs, estimated baseline consumption of anaesthetics and estimated baseline incidence of 
anaesthesia-related complications/intraoperative awareness) defined at the root node of the tree. The 
effects of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitoring (using the included technologies) compared with

standard clinical monitoring, which have been identified and assessed in the systematic review of patient 
outcomes, are applied to the baseline estimates, at the depth of anaesthesia monitoring node. These are 
applied as proportionate changes or OR/relative risks.
No quality-of-life (QoL) impact (utility loss) is included in the model for short-term anaesthesia-related 
complications (such as PONV) as these are expected to be of limited duration. Similarly, the model does 
not include an estimate of the QoL impact (utility loss) for an intraoperative awareness episode. The most 
significant quality-of-life QoL impact of any intraoperative awareness experience is assumed to be captured 
by estimating the incidence of psychological symptoms arising as a result of the awareness episode 
(including cases of PTSD).
As indicated, data population of the model required the estimation of baseline risks for a number of 
parameters in addition to the effectiveness estimates drawn from the systematic review of patient 
outcomes. The following section identifies the model parameters and the data sources used in the model.
Model parameters
Cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring
The costs of depth of anaesthesia monitoring consist of the capital costs associated with acquisition 
of the module and recurring costs associated with sensors which are attached to the patient. Table 31 
summarises the costs supplied by manufacturers for each of the modules included in the assessment.
Equivalent annual costs for each module (assuming a 5-year useful life for the equipment and a discount 
rate of 3.5%) are presented in Table 32.
The annual throughput of patients for each module is assumed to be 1000 patients per year (equivalent to 
four patients per day for a working year of 250 days) if used for patients at average risk of intraoperative 
awareness, based on discussion with clinical experts. We assumed that throughput would be halved if 
depth of anaesthesia monitoring was limited only to patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness 
(equivalent to two patients per day for a working year of 250 days) – the impact of assumptions regarding 
patient throughput on the unit costs for DoA modules is tested in scenario analyses.

Additional costs
The manufacturers’ submissions to NICE indicate minimal additional power consumption associated with 
the modules. Therefore no additional costs were added to account for this.
The need for additional training for staff to operate the monitor appears to vary by model, according to 
the industry submissions. Narcotrend models require a day for the delivery of a lecture and training in the 
operating theatre or intensive care unit (ICU). The technical part of the training (handling the Narcotrend 
device, electrode placing) requires <1 hour. The manufacturer of the E-Entropy model states that a 
30-minute introductory training session is required in placement of the sensors, whereas no additional 
training is required for the use of a BIS monitor. This is not currently accounted for in the model.
The Narcotrend device included in this assessment is a stand-alone monitor [although the manufacturer’s 
submission states that it can also send data in real time to other anaesthesia monitors (makes and 
coverage not specified)], whereas BIS and E-Entropy are modules designed to operate with other 
anaesthesia monitors. BIS is compatible with a range of monitoring platforms.
(Commercial-in-confidence information has been removed.) E-Entropy is compatible with GE Healthcare’s 
most recent monitor range (CARESCAPE Monitors B850 and B650), but not older software levels (in 
GE Healthcare monitors) or with monitors produced by other manufacturers. The manufacturer’s 
submission estimates that 45% of all UK operating theatres would be compatible with E-Entropy – for the 
remaining 55% significant investment in new monitoring equipment may be required for compatibility. 
Costs based on Table 31 would not be representative for facilities requiring such investment in new 
monitoring equipment.
The manufacturers did not supply any information on maintenance costs or costs of maintenance 
contracts for any of the depth of anaesthesia modules. As a result, the base case excludes any costs for 
recurrent maintenance. The potential impact of maintenance costs are examined in scenario analyses using

assumptions regarding maintenance costs (annual maintenance costs estimated at 10% and 20% of the 
module acquisition cost).
Summary of unit costs for depth of anaesthesia modules
Unit costs for DoA modules include acquisition costs for the module (annualised, assuming a 5-year 
effective life, and converted to an average cost per patient using assumptions on patient throughput) and 
recurring costs arising from the single-use sensors attached to the patient.
Unit costs included in the base case do not include estimates of the cost of formal training or 
familiarisation with equipment or maintenance costs.
Anaesthetic dose
Baseline value
We undertook targeted searches for studies reporting costs of anaesthetics or estimates of anaesthetic 
consumption against duration of anaesthesia. Elliott and colleagues99 reported a national survey 
of anaesthetic practice for paediatric and adult day surgery in UK and undertook a prospective RCT 
comparing the cost-effectiveness of anaesthetic regimens in adults (general, orthopaedic and gynaecology 
patients) and paediatric cases (general plus ear, nose and throat patients). They reported total costs 
(broken down by variable, semi-fixed and fixed components) for four anaesthetic regimens. The included 
regimens were TIVA (propofol induction, propofol maintenance), i.v./inhalational anaesthesia (propofol 
induction, isoflurane/N2O maintenance or propofol induction, sevoflurane/N2O maintenance) and total 
inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflurane induction, sevoflurane/N2O maintenance).
A total of 1063 adult patients remained in the study until hospital discharge (265 propofol/propofol, 267 
propofol/isoflurane, 280 propofol/sevoflurane, 251 sevoflurane/sevoflurane). The mean total and variable 
costs reported for the RCTs are shown in Table 33.
Variable costs included for each anaesthetic regimen in the trial were reported as being primarily drug 
costs (including anaesthetic agent use), but also included other items such as disposable equipment and 
therefore may not be the best basis for estimating savings that may be realised by reducing anaesthetic use 
associated with DoA monitoring.
Baseline consumption of inhaled anaesthetic agents in the economic model was estimated using an 
equation reported by Chernin,100 based on a formula originally presented by Dion.101
Cost per MAC unit time=(concentration×FGF× duration×MW×cost/ml)/(2412×D) (2)
where concentration is the concentration (%) of gas delivered, FGF is the fresh gas flow rate in 
litres/minute, duration is duration of inhaled anaesthetic delivery in minutes, MW is molecular weight in 
grams, D is density in grams/ml and 2412 is a factor to account for the molar volume of a gas at 21°C. 
If duration is set to 60 minutes, the above formula would estimate the cost per MAC hour for a given 
inhaled anaesthetic agent. Table 34 presents the required values for calculating the cost per MAC hour of 
isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane at fresh gas flow rates of 2l/minute for maintenance of anaesthesia.

Consumption of i.v. anaesthetic (e.g. propofol) will be based on reported total consumption in included 
trials. Where this is not reported consumption will be estimated based on normalised rates (mg/kg/hour or 
mg/kg/hour where appropriate), average patient weight and duration of anaesthesia.
Change in anaesthetic consumption associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring
The summary values reproduced in Table 35 below are taken from the systematic review of patient 
outcomes reported earlier in Results of systematic review of patient outcomes.
Consumption of anaesthetic drugs used in TIVA, for the comparison of E-Entropy and standard clinical 
monitoring, is based on data reported in two clinical trials55,62 that were modelled separately, as we 
considered them unsuitable for pooling, given substantial differences in the patient populations.
Unit cost of anaesthetic agents
Unit costs for propofol are taken from the British National Formulary (BNF33). Unit costs for volatile inhaled 
anaesthetic gases are not available in the BNF. As a result, these costs have been provided by University 
Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. The unit costs reported for inhaled anaesthetic gases are 
based on currently quoted wholesale prices and do not reflect any discounts that may be available to NHS 
purchasers (Table 36).
Estimated baseline (standard clinical monitoring) cost of anaesthetic agents 
adopted in the model
Table 37 presents a summary of estimated baseline costs, change in anaesthetic consumption and cost 
of anaesthetic associated with use of DoA monitoring, based on assumptions presented in Tables 34 and 
Table 36.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting
Our systematic review of patient outcomes identified limited evidence of the impact of DoA monitoring 
on the risk of PONV. A baseline risk of PONV (30%)102–104 for standard clinical monitoring and DoA 
monitoring has been included in the model. The sensitivity of the results to the potential impact of depth 
of anaesthesia monitoring on the risk of PONV is explored in a scenario analysis using data from a metaanalysis on the effectiveness of BIS on a range of outcomes including PONV by Liu.105 We assumed that 
all treatments (such as prophylaxis against PONV) were the same for each monitoring group, and that all 
patients experiencing PONV were treated using 4mg ondansetron by intramuscular or slow i.v. injection 
(unit cost=£5.39; BNF33).

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction
Baseline value
Our systematic review of patient outcomes identified limited evidence of the impact of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring on the risk of POCD. One study, conducted in an elderly population (>60 years 
old) available as an abstract, reported a reduction in POCD for BIS-monitored patients at 7 days 
and 3 months, although the difference at 7 days was reported to not be statistically significant. 
There is disagreement over the true incidence of POCD, with some authors arguing that this may be

underestimated because of loss to follow-up for the most severe cases,106 whereas others argue that 
it may be overestimated by identifying as POCD what was a pre-existing cognitive decline. Duration 
of POCD was estimated using data reported for the International Study of Post-Operative Cognitive 
Dysfunction (ISPOCD).107 This study recruited people over the age of 60 years who were presenting for 
major abdominal, non-cardiac thoracic or orthopaedic surgery under GA. Subjects with Mini Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score of <23 at baseline were excluded. Incidence of POCD at 1 week after surgery 
was 25.8% and was present in 9.9% of subjects at 3 months. This compared with 3.4% at 1 week and 
2.8% at 3 months in non-surgical controls. Longer-term follow-up of subjects in the ISPOCD study,108
between 1 and 2 years, reported cognitive dysfunction in 10.4% of patients and 10.6% of controls, 
although there was considerable attrition of the cohort (336 of the original 1218 subjects followed up 
between 1 and 2 years). For this assessment we have assumed that the excess (22.4% at 1 week and 7.1% 
at 3 months) represents cognitive dysfunction attributable to undergoing GA, which will then gradually 
reduce to zero (at 18 months). Using these proportions (22.4% at 1 week, 7.1% at 3 months and zero 
at 18 months), we used the area under the curve to estimate the mean duration of POCD at 29.65 days 
for patients over the age of 60 years. We estimated the proportion of surgical patients experiencing 
POCD using data on the proportion of patients undergoing any procedure available from Health Episode 
Statistics (HES) online,109 which reported that 45% of patients were age 60 years and above.
Change in postoperative cognitive dysfunction associated with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring
Odds ratios for POCD at 7 days and at 3 months were estimated using data tabulated in the abstract by 
Chan and colleagues47 (Table 38).
The ORs were applied to the baseline proportions with cognitive dysfunction at 7 days and 3 months, and 
mean duration of POCD associated with BIS monitoring was estimated at 21.10 days.
Quality of life impact of postoperative cognitive dysfunction associated with 
depth of anaesthesia monitoring
The QoL impact of POCD was based on the utility decrement reported by Jonsson and colleagues110 for 
the difference between a MMSE evaluation score of > (no dysfunction), which had a utility of 0.69, and a 
MMSE evaluation score of between 21 and 25 (indicating mild cognitive impairment), which had a utility 
of 0.64.
Intraoperative awareness
Baseline value
Awareness (defined as postoperative recollection of events occurring during GA) has generally been 
described as a rare occurrence, with an incidence of 0.1–0.2% in the general surgical population. 
Although still rare, the risk of awareness has historically been greater (up to 1%) in particular types of 
surgery (cardiac surgery, caesarean section and trauma surgery).79,111,112
We conducted targeted searches for studies reporting incidence of intraoperative awareness in general 
surgical populations and in those populations identified as being at greater risk of awareness. Table 39 
reports the studies identified by the searches, the study populations as well as the methods used to 
assess and measure awareness. The majority of studies reported using the Brice interview24 or modified

versions of the Brice interview administered on at least two occasions (with the first interview in the PACU). 
Three comparatively large studies (sample sizes between 10,000 and 20,000 patients) in general surgical 
populations estimated similar incidences and are commonly cited in support of the previously quoted 
incidence of 0.1–0.2%. However, two more recent studies have suggested wildly divergent incidence 
in the general surgical population (from 0.007% up to 0.99%). Although the authors of the study18
indicating the highest incidence in a general surgical population reported lower values when excluding 
high-risk cases (emergency surgery, intraoperative hypotension-shock and caesarean section) and those 
patients who (in subsequent interviews) denied experiencing awareness, the reported incidence remained 
substantially in excess of the assumed risk for the general surgical population and closer to that assumed 
for high-risk patients.
A pooled estimate from all these studies gives a cumulative incidence of awareness of 0.21% (95% 
CI 0.06% to 0.45%) assuming random effects [Cochran’s Q=212.55 (df=5); p<0.0001; I
2=97.6% 
for fixed-effect model; see Appendix 9 for details]. Excluding the two outlying studies (Pollard and 
colleagues14 and Errando and colleagues18) yields a slightly lower estimate, with narrower CI (0.16%; 
95% CI 0.10% to 0.23%) assuming random effects [Cochran’s Q=7.85 (df=3); p=0.0493; I
2=61.8% 
for fixed-effect model].
The incidence of awareness in high-risk patients has been calculated from the standard clinical monitoring 
arms of RCTs in this group of patients from our systematic review of patient outcomes (Results of 
systematic review of patient outcomes). Pooling these estimates gives a cumulative incidence of awareness 
of 0.45% (95% CI 0.06% to 1.19%) assuming random effects [Cochran’s Q=19.97 (df=4); p=0.0005; 
I
2=80.0% for fixed-effect model; see Appendix 9 for details].
In the model we apply the pooled estimates of 0.16% (95% CI 0.10% to 0.23%) for risk of awareness in 
the base case for general surgical patients and 0.45% (95% CI 0.06% to 1.19%) for high-risk patients. The 
lowest incidence (0.007%), reported by Pollard and colleagues,14 and highest incidence (0.99%), reported 
by Errando and colleagues,18 are used in scenario analyses for general surgical patients. A high value of 1% 
is used in scenario analyses for high-risk patients.
Change in incidence of intraoperative awareness associated with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring
The summary values reproduced in Table 40 are taken from the systematic review of patient outcomes 
reported earlier in Results of systematic review of patient outcomes. There are no entries for E-Entropy and 
Narcotrend in this table as insufficient data were identified in the systematic review of patient outcomes 
to derive robust results. As a result the relevant OR derived for BIS were used in the model to estimate the 
impact on intraoperative awareness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring with E-Entropy and Narcotrend.

In addition, the systematic review did not identify any robust data on the effect of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness in patients considered at average risk of 
awareness. Consequently, the relevant OR derived for high-risk patients were used in the model to estimate 
the impact on intraoperative awareness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring for general surgical patients 
considered at average risk of awareness.
Sequelae of intraoperative awareness
Incidence of psychological sequelae A targeted search for studies reporting symptoms of patients 
who had reported awareness during surgery was undertaken in order to understand the health-related 
consequences of intraoperative awareness.
Eight studies were identified5,7,8,10,11,19,114,115 (Table 41). These suggested that the patients who had 
experienced intraoperative awareness fall into three groups: those who do not experience any sequelae, 
those who experience ‘late psychological symptoms’ and those who go on to suffer from PTSD. Late 
psychological symptoms (LPS) comprise anxiety, chronic fear, nightmares, flashbacks, indifference, 
loneliness and a lack of confidence in future life. Anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks appeared to be the 
predominant symptoms in the study by Samuelsson and colleagues115 in patients with an LPS duration 
of <2 months; those experiencing symptoms for a longer duration reported nightmares and flashbacks 
alone. A diagnosis of PTSD is made if all six criteria of the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS) are 
positive. These include symptoms of re-experiencing trauma, avoidance, hyper-arousal, significant distress 
and the duration of symptoms lasting longer than 1 month.8
Just two of the studies had a prospective design.8,115 The study by Samuelsson and colleagues115 reported 
46 awareness cases in a cohort of 2681 interviewed after surgery. This is therefore the strongest evidence 
for development of PTSD and LPS that was identified in the targeted search. Leslie and colleagues,8
although reporting a small cohort, were the only authors among those identified to report time to onset 
and duration of symptoms. However, some cases of PTSD reported were ongoing, and it is unclear how 
this may impact on the duration results. The two prospective studies were used to inform the baseline data 
inputs, for the states of LPS and PTSD, into the model, as presented in Table 42 below. The six remaining 
studies were small, with limited usefulness for understanding the prevalence of psychological symptoms 
associated with awareness, because of retrospective design, participant recruitment methods or low 
recruitment levels.5,7,10,11,19,114
Duration of post-traumatic stress disorder Leslie and colleagues8 reported a median duration of 
4.7 years (range 4.4 to 5.6 years) for patients experiencing symptoms of PTSD. No further information 
on the distribution is provided so it unclear how well the median approximates to the mean duration of 
symptoms, as these cases of PTSD reported were ongoing, and it is unclear how this may impact on the 
duration results. Targeted searches did not identify any other studies reporting duration of PTSD symptoms 
associated with intraoperative awareness. One study was identified which reported duration of PTSD 
(median duration and survival curves) in a non-institutionalised, civilian population aged 15–54 years, 
conducted in the USA.118 These data were from the National Comorbidity Survey (a survey designed to 
study the distribution, correlates and consequences of psychiatric disorder in the USA) and included 
5877 respondents from 48 states. Response rates to part 2 of the survey, which included components 
related to PTSD, were between 98.1% (for those screening positive for any lifetime diagnosis in part 1 
of the survey) and 99% (for a random subsample of those not screening positive in part 1 of the 
survey). The median duration of symptoms for respondents who had ever sought professional treatment 
(n=266) was 36 months and for those who had not sought professional treatment (n=193) was 
64 months. We estimated the mean duration of PTSD symptoms for the population who had not sought 
professional treatment, by fitting a regression (assuming a Weibull distribution for the survival function; 
see Appendix 10 for details) to the reported survival curves. The mean duration of PTSD symptoms derived 
in this analysis was 152 months (12.7 years) (Figure 7).

Quality of life impact of psychological sequelae A review of the HRQoL of patients with PTSD was 
undertaken in order to explore the differences in scores between PTSD patients and those who had also 
experienced trauma, but had not gone on to develop PTSD. These scores were used to inform those in the 
model for patients experiencing awareness and developing psychological symptoms.
Methods
A systematic search was undertaken in order to identify studies reporting utility values associated with 
PTSD. The details of the search strategy are documented in Appendix 11. A total of 334 studies were 
initially identified by the search. The abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers and 21 full 
papers were retrieved (Figure 8). These were assessed against the inclusion criteria detailed in Table 43.
Characteristics of the included studies
Two papers119,120 met the inclusion criteria for the review. The study design and population baseline 
characteristics are shown in Table 44.

The two included studies119,120 were both undertaken in patients with PTSD. This population is diverse 
and there are a range of types of trauma that can trigger the disorder, such as domestic abuse, natural 
disaster or serious illness.122–124 Freed and colleagues interviewed veterans with PTSD,120 whereas Doctor 
and colleagues125 interviewed a sample of patients taking part in a trial of treatments for chronic PTSD 
at baseline.
The two studies119,120 were considerably different in size, with the Freed study120 having approximately four 
times as many respondents. The two studies reported differing populations in respect to both age and 
sex, which may have contributed to the differing results. In the study by Freed and colleagues,120 female 
patients constituted 21% of the sample, and the average age was 60 years. In the Doctor and colleagues 
study125 the sample was on average younger, with a mean age of 37, and 76% of the respondents 
were female.

In addition, the two studies generated the results using different valuation tools and methods. Neither 
of the included studies was based on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire, 
as prescribed by the NICE reference case.38 Doctor and colleagues119 asked respondents to respond using 
standard gamble (SG), visual analogue scale (VAS), and time trade-off (TTO) techniques, the last of which 
is recommended as an alternative.38 Freed and colleagues126 used the Short Form questionnaire-36 items 
(SF-36) responses from a previous study127 and converted these to preference weighted health scores 
(PWHSs) using the formula developed by Brazier and colleagues.121

Both studies included the results of statistical models generated in order to identify predictors for 
worsening or improvement of utility scores.119,120
Quality of the included studies Doctor and colleagues119 clearly reported inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for patients entering the trial, which appeared appropriate. The methods employed to elicit utility scores 
were clearly described, although the description of TTO does not appear to be correct, which could 
undermine the results. Freed and colleagues120 have based their analysis on the results of a previous 
study, the sources for the analysis are clearly stated, and the interview methods and scales employed are 
adequately described. The sample is of British veterans, which is relevant to the UK, but the generalisability 
of the HRQoL of veterans to different patient populations is unclear. Freed and colleagues120 have also 
carried out ordinary least squares regressions (OLS) in order to allow researchers to adjust the estimates 
of patients’ PWHS. The methods for these were adequately described, but contradictory results are 
reported: the PWHS is reported to increase if a patient has both a PTSD diagnosis and increasing severity 
of symptoms on the PTSD checklist (PCL). These contradictions are not fully considered or explained, and 
therefore limit the usefulness of the regression results in estimating HRQoL in patients with PTSD.
Results
The mean utility scores reported in each of the included studies are presented in Table 45.
The scores for veterans in the Freed study120 with PTSD is lower than that of veterans without PTSD, with a 
difference of 0.11, suggesting that PTSD does negatively impact on HRQoL.
Doctor and colleagues119 report three separate scores according to the valuation method. The scores for 
TTO and VAS are similar (0.66 and 0.64 respectively), whereas the score for SG appears high at 0.87. The 
authors argue that the mixed-effect model employed has accounted for possible bias in SG methods (SG 
requires the participants to state the probability that they would accept a treatment that has a certain 
probability of conferring full health, with the concomitant probability of immediate death). However, they 
also state that the TTO method has a lower risk of bias, although justification for this is not reported.119
TTO is also recommended by NICE where EQ-5D scores are unavailable.38 The study does not provide a raw 
comparable score for a group without PTSD using these methods, and therefore it is not possible to draw 
conclusions as to the decrement in utility resulting from developing PTSD from this paper.
Studies reporting Short Form questionnaire-36 items scores
A further six studies122–124,129–131 that did not meet our inclusion criteria, but which reported the eight 
subscales of the SF-36, were identified. A preference-based utility score can be estimated from studies that 
report scores for the eight subscales of the SF-36.128 Preference-based health-related utilities from these 
results have been estimated by SHTAC in order to assess the robustness of the estimates in the study by 
Freed and colleagues.120 These were converted using the algorithm published by Ara and Brazier,128 and are 
reported in Table 46.
Scores derived using the SF-36 do not meet the NICE reference case,38 which recommends the EQ-5D, and 
that values generated from the Short Form questionnaire-6 Dimensions (SF-6D) 132 be employed in the

sensitivity analysis. The studies reporting the SF-36 scores were carried out in diverse groups, with differing 
traumatic triggers for PTSD. Furthermore, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of this table 
as these studies have not been fully data extracted or quality assessed. However, the scores consistently 
indicate similar differences in HRQoL between groups of patients who have similar experiences who go 
on to develop PTSD, and those who do not, and the differences are consistent with those reported by 
Freed and colleagues.120 On average across these papers the difference is 0.10. These results lend weight 
to the estimates of decrement in utility as a result of PTSD, and may also be useful for sensitivity analysis. 
However, the results for the utility scores in patients with and without PTSD are generally higher than those 
reported by Freed and colleagues,120 with the exception of those reported by Shiner and colleagues130 also 
elicited from veterans.
Summary
z Two papers met the inclusion criteria for this review of utility scores in PTSD. Six other papers reporting 
SF-36 scores for people with PTSD were also retained.
z Neither of the studies meeting the inclusion criteria (reporting a utility value based on a generic, 
preference-based measure) was based on the EQ-5D.
z One study reported a utility score for patients with PTSD based on TTO.119 However, no score for 
patients without PTSD was reported, and therefore no difference in these can be derived.
z The second study reported scores for patients both with and without PTSD, but these were based on 
the SF-36 and converted to a utility score.120
z Therefore the evidence base for HRQoL in patients with PTSD is limited.
z Six further studies provide SF-36 scores, which have been transformed into utility values. These can 
provide context and values for sensitivity analysis.
Post-traumatic stress disorder costs The costs of treating PTSD have been estimated based on 
assumptions contained in the national cost impact report133 associated with NICE Clinical Guideline no. 
26133 on the management of PTSD in adults and children in primary and secondary care.134 The costing 
report acknowledged that there has been little systematic collection of information about PTSD, on services 
provided to people with PTSD or on uptake of these services. This limited the feasibility of developing 
a comprehensive bottom-up costing model and resulted in the costing being based on a series of 
assumptions – developed and validated through discussion with members of the Guideline Development 
Group (GDG) and key clinical practitioners in the NHS. These assumptions, in terms of uptake and services 
available, are summarised in Figure 9 and are discussed below.
Data from the adult psychiatric morbidity survey,135 which reported that 24% respondents assessed as 
having a neurotic disorder were receiving treatment of some kind at the time of interview, were used as 
the basis for estimating the current proportion of people with PTSD who seek treatment. On the basis

of additional data from the same survey, 62.5% of these were assumed to be receiving pharmacological 
therapy alone, 16.7% were receiving counselling or therapy alone and 20.8% were receiving both. It 
was assumed that, following implementation of the guideline, the proportion receiving treatment would 
increase by 10%, to 34%. Moreover, the guideline proposed a substantially different care pathway with 
significantly fewer patients expected to receive medication (with a recommendation that drug treatments 
not be offered routinely as first line, but to provide trauma-focused psychological treatment to more 
patients with PTSD symptoms). We estimated an average cost for management of PTSD using the 
assumptions regarding take-up of treatment options (70% of patients accept psychological treatment, 
and 30% initially accept pharmacological treatment) and severity (30% patients have mild symptoms and 
are initially managed through watchful waiting, and 20% have severe symptoms and are offered traumafocused psychological treatment within the first month after the traumatic event). Table 47 summarises the 
unit costs, assumptions regarding the proportion of patients receiving each treatment and the overall cost 
estimated for PTSD.
The NICE guideline133 does not include any estimates for inpatient care for people with PTSD. Targeted 
searches did not identify any UK studies of health service use, in particular use of secondary services 
and inpatient care for people with PTSD. One US study identified by the searches reported healthcare utilisation, derived from electronic medical records, for civilian primary care patients, including a 
proportion who had current PTSD.136 This study reported an incidence rate ratio of 2.22 (adjusted for age, 
sex, income, substance dependence, depression and comorbidity) for hospitalisation in subjects with PTSD 
compared with those without PTSD. Unadjusted mean number of hospitalisations among the PTSD group 
was 0.43 compared with 0.18 in those without PTSD. No further details are reported on the reason for 
hospitalisation or length of stay. In the absence of data specific to the UK for people with PTSD, we have 
assumed, based on the mean values reported in this study, an excess hospitalisation probability of 0.25 
per year among people with PTSD. We derived a crude estimate of the average cost of hospitalisation 
(£2590), based on 2010–11 NHS Reference Costs,137 by summing the total costs reported for elective and 
non-elective inpatient HRG data and dividing by the total activity under these headings. On this basis we 
estimated an additional £7576 for hospitalisations among people with PTSD over the average duration of 
symptoms of 12.7 years.
The total cost associated with PTSD was £9104 (undiscounted) or £6128 (discounted at 3.5%).

Summary of model inputs The following tables contain a summary of the input parameters in the model, 
the base-case value and a brief overview of how the data were derived including a source, where relevant. 
Table 48 provides a summary of the cost per patient of each depth of anaesthesia technology, including 
an estimated cost per patient of the depth-monitoring device as well as the cost of consumables (singleuse sensors attached to the patient). Table 49 provides a summary of the baseline cost of anaesthetic 
drug calculated for standard clinical monitoring in each comparison and the proportionate reduction 
in consumption associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring. We have assumed that the reduction 
in consumption of anaesthetic will be realised only for the general surgical population and not in the 
population at high risk of awareness, as the raised risk of awareness may be an indication that this group 
of patients are already at a risk of being underdosed.
Table 50 provides a summary of model inputs related to awareness including the baseline risks for patients 
considered at high risk of awareness and a general surgical population, the risk reduction associated with 
depth of anaesthesia monitoring and a list of assumptions underlying the estimation of the cost and 
outcomes associated with the psychological sequelae of intraoperative awareness.
Table 51 provides a summary of model inputs relating to anaesthetic complications (PONV and POCD 
in the model), including the baseline risks and the risk reduction associated with depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring for POCD.
Model results
The model results are presented in separate subsections for BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend respectively. 
Analyses are presented by mode of administration [TIVA and mixed anaesthesia (induction with i.v. 
anaesthetic and maintenance with inhaled anaesthetic)], with separate analyses reported for patients 
considered at high risk of awareness and for a general surgical population. No analysis is presented for 
inhaled GA only. Although trials using this mode of anaesthesia delivery were included in the systematic 
review of patient outcomes, these did not report any information on anaesthetic drug consumption on 
which to base a reliable costing.

Bispectral Index compared with standard clinical monitoring
Base case
Total intravenous anaesthesia The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for patients considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with BIS are 
presented in Table 52.
Bispectral Index monitoring was modelled as being associated with 10.8 cases of awareness, compared 
with 45 cases for patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This 
resulted in a reduction of 11.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 3.5), which included a reduction of six cases of 
PTSD (from 8.0 to 1.9).
The cost of standard clinical monitoring during anaesthesia in high-risk patients was lower than for BIS, 
with a cost difference of £15.17. The increased cost for BIS monitoring is primarily the result of the sensors 
attached to the patient (88% of the cost per patient cost) rather than the module. There is no reduction 
in anaesthetic costs associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring in this group of patients, although 
a small amount of the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring is offset by reduced costs 
associated with psychological sequelae of awareness (Table 53).
The comparatively high cost of sensors for use with BIS suggests that it is unlikely to generate sufficient 
savings to offset fully the additional costs of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. This analysis suggests that

the cost-effectiveness of BIS is likely to be highly dependent on the extent to which it delivers improved 
patient outcomes (such as reduction in episodes of awareness (and the psychological sequelae) or 
POCD). A threshold analysis showed that, for patients considered at high risk of intraoperative awareness 
undergoing GA with TIVA, BIS monitoring would be cost-effective (at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY 
gained) where the OR for awareness (BIS vs standard clinical monitoring) was <0.458.
The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for a general surgical population undergoing GA with TIVA, comparing 
standard clinical monitoring with monitoring by BIS are presented in Table 54.
Although the cost of standard clinical monitoring in this group of patients was slightly lower than for the 
subgroup of patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness, the incremental cost of BIS monitoring is 
lower. This is attributable to the potential to offset a reduction in consumption of anaesthetic against the 
additional costs of depth of anaesthesia monitoring (Table 55). Propofol consumption for maintenance of 
anaesthesia was estimated as being 19.3% lower in the BIS-monitored group, compared with standard 
clinical monitoring. Given the lower probability of intraoperative awareness in this group of patients, the 
QALY losses for standard clinical monitoring and BIS monitoring [resulting from psychological sequelae 
of awareness (LPS and PTSD)] are lower than for the high-risk group. The QALY gain of 0.0003 was lower 
than in the high-risk group and results in an increased ICER of £34,565 per QALY gained.
Mixed anaesthesia [induction with intravenous anaesthetic (propofol) and maintenance with inhaled 
anaesthetic (sevoflurane)] The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for patients considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness undergoing GA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with monitoring by BIS, 
are presented in Table 56.
Bispectral Index monitoring was modelled as being associated with 20.3 cases of awareness, compared 
with 45 cases among patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This 
resulted in a reduction of 8.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 6.6), which included a reduction of 4.4 cases of 
PTSD (from 8.0 to 3.6).
The cost of BSI during anaesthesia in high-risk patients was higher than for standard clinical monitoring, 
with an incremental cost of £15.52. As discussed previously, the majority of the cost increase with BIS

monitoring is attributable to the sensors attached to the patient rather than the depth-monitoring module. 
As with TIVA in high-risk patients, there is no reduction in anaesthetic costs associated with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring and limited scope to offset the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring 
by reduction in costs associated with psychological sequelae of awareness (Table 57).
Bispectral Index monitoring in a general surgical population undergoing mixed anaesthesia was modelled 
as being associated with 7.2 cases of awareness, compared with 16 cases among patients receiving 
standard clinical monitoring. This resulted in a reduction of three cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 2.33), which 
included a reduction of 1.5 cases of PTSD (from 2.8 to 1.3). The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for this 
population undergoing mixed GA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with monitoring by BIS, are 
presented in Table 58.
Costs of standard clinical monitoring and BIS monitoring in this group of patients are both lower than for 
the subgroup of patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness. The cost difference is lower, because 
of the potential to offset a reduction in consumption of anaesthetic against the additional costs of depth 
of anaesthesia monitoring (Table 59). Sevoflurane consumption for maintenance of anaesthesia was 
estimated as being 20.2% lower in the BIS-monitored group, compared with standard clinical monitoring. 
Given the lower probability of intraoperative awareness in this group of patients, the QALY losses for 
standard clinical monitoring and BIS monitoring are lower than for the high-risk group. The effectiveness 
of BIS monitoring at reducing intraoperative awareness was also assumed to be lower with inhaled 
anaesthesia (Peto’s OR 0.45) compared with TIVA (Peto’s OR 0.24). The QALY gain of 0.0003 was lower 
than in the high-risk group and results in an increased ICER of £49,198 per QALY gained.

Deterministic sensitivity analysis
Total intravenous anaesthesia One-way sensitivity analyses of key parameters were undertaken in both 
the general surgical population, and the high-risk surgical population undergoing GA with TIVA. The 
results are shown in Tables 60 and 61.
The changes in the probability of awareness in the patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness 
receiving TIVA resulted in a substantially altered ICER from the base case: £8196 per QALY gained and 
£84,305 per QALY gained respectively. The ICER was also sensitive to decreased effectiveness of the BIS 
module, changes in the probability of LPS, the duration of PTSD at 9.6 years, changes in the probability of 
PTSD, the lower PTSD decrement and the lower unit cost of sensors. Changes in the duration of LPS, or the 
LPS QoL decrement, had little impact on the ICER.
These results suggest that the ICER for the general surgical population is relatively robust to changes in the 
duration of LPS, changes in the QoL decrement applied to LPS, and to the probability of patients seeking 
treatment for PTSD and the duration of PTSD symptoms.
The ICER appears sensitive to the lower probability of awareness, the relative risk of awareness with BIS 
modules, the decrease in probability of developing LPS, the decreased probability of developing PTSD and 
changes in the QoL decrement applied to PTSD.

Mixed anaesthesia One-way sensitivity analyses of key parameters were undertaken in both the general 
surgical population and the high-risk surgical population undergoing mixed GA. The results are shown in 
Tables 62 and 63.
The ICER was sensitive to several key parameters in high-risk patients undergoing mixed anaesthesia. The 
largest variation is seen where the probability of awareness is decreased to 0.0006 and 0.0119, resulting 
in an ICER of £11,819 and £94,710 per QALY gained respectively. Changes in the relative risk of awareness 
with the BIS module, probability of developing LPS or PTSD, the duration of PTSD and a decreased PTSD 
QoL decrement all lead to large variations in the ICER, ranging from £22,610 to £62,482 per QALY gained.
The ICER is again sensitive to several key parameters in a general surgical population undergoing mixed 
anaesthesia. In this group, an increase in the probability of LPS resulted in the largest variation, to £67,196 
per QALY gained. The ICER was again driven by probability of awareness, the relative risk of awareness

a Changing the probability of LPS also changes the probability of PTSD, as PTSD is calculated as proportion of the

this parameter is therefore a combination of the effect of LPS (overall) and PTSD combined.

Scenario analysis
Inclusion of anaesthesia-related complication (postoperative nausea and vomiting) The systematic 
review of patient outcomes did not identify any robust data which reported an estimate of the effect of BIS 
monitoring on risk of PONV. We developed a scenario analysis using data from the meta-analysis by Liu105
to investigate the potential impact of including this outcome on the cost-effectiveness results.

For this scenario analysis we used the baseline (control group) risk of PONV as the estimated risk for 
standard clinical monitoring and applied the OR derived in the meta-analysis (0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 
0.99) and the lower limit of the 95% CI to estimate risk for BIS-monitored patients. We assumed that 
all treatments (such as prophylaxis against PONV) were the same for each treatment group, and that all 
patients experiencing PONV were treated using 4mg ondansetron by intramuscular or slow i.v. injection 
(unit cost=£5.39; BNF33).
Tables 64 and 65 report the results of the scenario analysis for patients at high risk of intraoperative 
awareness and a general surgical population, respectively, undergoing GA with TIVA. The incremental 
costs for BIS monitoring are reduced, from the value reported for the base-case analyses (Tables 52

largely unchanged.

Inclusion of the impact of PONV with BIS monitoring into the base-case analysis is unlikely to substantially 
affect decisions based on cost-effectiveness criteria.

Scenario analyses for probability of intraoperative awareness for patients at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and for the general surgical population Our review of published studies of 
the incidence of intraoperative awareness identified substantial uncertainty over the estimated values. We 
used pooled values across identified studies in the base-case analysis. However, the value adopted for ‘high 
risk’ is lower than that commonly quoted as indicating high risk, and the pooled estimate adopted for a 
general surgical population excluded two outlying studies (one high and one low extreme value).
For this scenario analysis we replace the base-case estimate for probability of awareness in the high-risk 
population (0.45%) with a value of 1.0% reported for certain types of surgery (cardiac surgery, caesarean 
section and trauma surgery).79,111,112 The effect of this is to approximately double the QALY loss for each 
group, resulting in a doubling of the QALY gain associated with BIS monitoring, while incremental costs 
are largely unchanged. The effect of this is to reduce the ICER by about half (Table 68).
In the general surgical population, we replaced the base-case estimate for probability of awareness 
(0.16%) with the incidences reported in the two outlying studies (Tables 69 and 70). The results from 
these two scenarios contrast sharply. At the highest reported incidence of awareness – equivalent to 
that frequently cited for ‘high-risk’ populations – the QALY loss for each group increases approximately 
2.5-fold, resulting in a three- to fourfold increase in the QALY gain associated with BIS monitoring. 
The incremental costs are slightly reduced, compared with the base case, and the resulting ICERs are 
substantially reduced. In the case of the lowest reported probability of awareness, the QALY gain from BIS 
monitoring is negligible resulting in high-value ICER.
Impact of assumptions on number of patients per device-year In order to apportion the capital cost 
of the depth of anaesthesia monitoring modules, we required an estimate of the number of patients in 
whom the monitor module was used in each year (patients per device-year), throughout its assumed 
5-year effective life. The estimate used for the general surgical population was 1000 patients per year 
(equivalent to four patients per day over 250 working days per year) was based on discussion with clinical 
experts. This scenario analysis investigates the impact of this assumption on the estimated incremental cost 
associated with BIS monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring, and the resulting effect on 
the ICER. Tables 71 and 72 report the incremental cost and ICER for BIS, compared with standard clinical 
monitoring, at four selected values for the number of patients per device-year: the base-case value of 100 
and also for a low value of 10 and a high value of 1500 (six patients per day over 250 working days per 
year). This suggests that the assumed number of patients per device-year only has a substantial impact on 
incremental cost (hence on the ICER) at comparatively low volumes.

Impact of utility decrement for PTSD The QoL decrement applied in the base-case analysis was based 
on Freed and colleagues’120 paper on veterans with PTSD. In order to investigate the impact of a sparse 
evidence base on HRQoL in a group of patients with PTSD, a scenario analysis was undertaken. The utility 
decrement was adjusted to 0.50 and 0.75 in high-risk and general surgical groups receiving either TIVA or 
mixed anaesthesia (Table 73).
The ICER was sensitive to these alternative scenarios in high-risk patients, both receiving TIVA and mixed 
anaesthesia. Where the PTSD decrement was increased to –0.5 in TIVA and mixed anaesthesia the ICER 
reduced to £6431 per QALY gained and £8928 per QALY gained respectively. Where the PTSD decrement 
was increased further, the ICER decreased again to £4379 and £6116 per QALY gained in the TIVA and 
mixed anaesthesia groups respectively.
The scenario analyses using alternative PTSD decrements in the general surgical population reflect 
the results in the high-risk population: there is a substantial reduction in the ICER where these are 
increased (Table 74).

E-Entropy monitoring was modelled as being associated with 10.8 cases of awareness, compared with 45 
cases in patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This resulted in a 
reduction of 11.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 3.5), which included a reduction of six cases of PTSD (from 
8.0 to 1.9).
The cost of standard clinical monitoring during anaesthesia in high-risk patients was lower than for 
E-Entropy monitoring, with the incremental cost being £9.79. The breakdown of total cost for standard 
clinical monitoring and E-Entropy is reported in Table 76; the costs of anaesthetic drug use outlined in this 
table apply to the Ellerkmann and colleagues study only.62 As no reduction in drug costs is expected in the 
population at high risk of awareness, the cost assumption (for anaesthetic drugs) has no impact on the 
ICER. The increased cost for E-Entropy monitoring is partially offset by the reduction in costs of patients 
with PTSD.
As a result of the psychological sequelae of awareness, including LPS, PTSD and POCD, patients in both 
groups incurred a slight QALY loss. This was lower in the E-Entropy-monitored patients, with a difference 
of 0.0007 QALY, resulting in an ICER of £14,421 per QALY gained.
In a general surgical population (not just those at high risk of intraoperative awareness) undergoing GA 
with TIVA, E-Entropy monitoring was modelled as being associated with 3.8 cases of awareness, compared 
with 16 cases for patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This 
resulted in a reduction of four cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 1.3), which included a reduction of 2.1 cases 
of PTSD (from 2.8 to 0.7). The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for this population, comparing standard 
clinical monitoring with monitoring by E-Entropy are presented in Table 77 (based on anaesthetic 
drug consumption from the RCT by Ellerkmann and colleagues62) and in Table 78 (based on 
anaesthetic drug consumption from the RCT by Gruenewald and colleagues55).
Applying the costs of anaesthetic drugs from both the Ellerkmann and colleagues62 and Gruenewald and 
colleagues55 RCTs results in increased costs with E-Entropy. Both RCTs reported slightly lower costs for 
anaesthetic drug use in the standard clinical monitoring group than with the E-Entropy group. Again, 
costs for PTSD were slightly lower in the E-Entropy group as a result of lower incidence of awareness 
(Table 79).
The QALY loss incurred by patients undergoing E-Entropy monitoring was slightly less than that of patients 
in the standard clinical monitoring group, giving an incremental QALY gain of 0.0003. This resulted in an 
ICER of £31,131 per QALY gained where the anaesthetic consumption from the Ellerkmann and colleagues

RCT62 were applied, and £31,430 where anaesthetic consumption from Gruenewald and colleagues55
were applied.
Mixed anaesthesia [induction with intravenous anaesthetic (propofol and sufentanil) and 
maintenance with intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic (sufentanil and sevoflurane)] The costs, 
QALY and ICER modelled for patients considered at high risk of intraoperative awareness undergoing 
mixed anaesthesia, comparing standard clinical monitoring with monitoring by E-Entropy are presented in 
Table 80.
E-Entropy monitoring was modelled as being associated with 20.3 cases of awareness, compared with 45 
cases among patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This resulted in 
a reduction of 8.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 6.6), which included a reduction of 4.4 cases of PTSD (from 
8.0 to 3.6).
The costs of anaesthetic drugs in each group were the same, as shown in the breakdown of total cost in 
Table 81. Sufentanil costs are not included as it is not available in the UK and therefore the costs are not 
available in the BNF. Given the reduced incidence of awareness, and consequent reduction in cases of

PTSD, costs for PTSD were lower in the group undergoing E-Entropy monitoring. The incremental cost of 
E-Entropy monitoring was £10.14.
Again, each group incurred a QALY loss as a result of psychological sequelae such as LPS and PTSD, which 
resulted in an incremental QALY gain for E-Entropy patients of 0.0005. This yielded an ICER of £19,367 per 
QALY gained.
In a general surgical population E-Entropy monitoring was modelled as being associated with 7.2 cases of 
awareness, compared with 16 cases in patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 
patients. This resulted in a reduction of three cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 2.3), which included a reduction of 
1.5 cases of PTSD (from 2.8 to 1.3). The costs, QALYs and ICER modelled for this population undergoing 
GA with both i.v. and inhaled anaesthetic, comparing standard clinical monitoring with monitoring by 
E-Entropy, are presented in Table 82.
In a general surgical population undergoing mixed anaesthesia with sufentanil and sevoflurane, the costs 
of E-Entropy monitoring were higher, with an incremental cost of £4.99 (Table 83). Costs of anaesthetic 
drugs were lower in the E-Entropy arm, as were costs associated with PTSD, offsetting a proportion of the 
additional costs associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring.
The general surgical population accrued a slightly lower incremental QALY gain of 0.0003, which resulted 
in an ICER of £19,000 per QALY gained.
Deterministic sensitivity analysis
Total intravenous anaesthesia One-way sensitivity analyses of key parameters were undertaken in both 
the general surgical population and the high-risk surgical population undergoing general anaesthetic using 
TIVA. The results for the high-risk surgical population are shown in Table 84. Here the anaesthetic drug 
costs are based on Ellerkmann and colleagues’ study.62 As there is no expected reduction in drug use in this 
high-risk population, this assumption has no overall impact: anaesthetic drug costs are the same for both 
standard clinical monitoring and E-Entropy and therefore cancel out in the calculation of incremental cost 
and in the ICER.

The ICER resulting from the one-way sensitivity analysis in a high-risk population receiving TIVA ranged 
from £4834 to £56,429 per QALY gained. The ICER was insensitive to decreases in the LPS QoL decrement, 
and to the unit costs of sensors, but a decrease in the PTSD decrement pushed the ICER up to £21,801 
per QALY gained from the base case of £14,421. The ICER appears driven by changes in the effectiveness 
of the E-Entropy module: where the relative risk of awareness is increased to 0.6, the ICER increases to 
£25,169 per QALY gained. Similarly, the ICER was very sensitive to changes in the probability of awareness. 
A decrease in this probability to 0.0006 increases the ICER substantially to £56,429 per QALY gained. 
Conversely, an increase in this probability to 0.0119 decreased the ICER to £4834 per QALY gained.
The results for the one-way sensitivity analyses in the general surgical population are shown in 
Table 85 (anaesthetic drug costs based on usage reported by Ellerkmann and colleagues62) and Table 86 
(anaesthetic drug costs based on usage reported by Gruenewald and colleagues55).

The one-way sensitivity analysis results in the general surgical population undergoing TIVA, and using costs 
applied from Ellerkmann and colleagues62 (Table 85) reflects those in the high-risk population. Again, the 
results are generally insensitive to changes in the duration of LPS, and the LPS QoL decrement. The greatest 
changes in ICERs were again generated as a result of changes in the probability of awareness (£23,936 
per QALY gained, and £41,419 per QALY gained), a reduction in effectiveness of the E-Entropy module 
(£45,292 per QALY gained,) and the probability of LPS and a reduction in the PTSD QoL decrement.
Again, the one-way sensitivity analysis in the general surgical population receiving TIVA and applying costs 
from Gruenewald and colleagues55 (Table 86) reflect the results in the high-risk group. Whereas the ICER

appears relatively insensitive to the changes in LPS QoL and LPS duration, the key parameters driving the

The results of the one-way sensitivity analysis in high-risk patients receiving mixed anaesthesia reflect 
those in patients receiving TIVA. The ICER in a high-risk surgical group receiving mixed anaesthesia is very 
sensitive to both increase and decrease in the probability of awareness (Table 87), resulting in ICER of 
£7290 per QALY gained and £63,483 per QALY gained respectively. The ICER was also sensitive to increase 
in the relative risk of awareness with the E-Entropy module, giving £41,635 per QALY gained. Again, 
the ICER was sensitive to changes in the probability of LPS, a decrease in the probability of PTSD, and a 
decrease in the PTSD QoL decrement, while being insensitive to the LPS decrement and duration.
In the general surgical population the largest variation in the ICER from the base case of £19,000 per 
QALY gained was driven by proportional decreases in sevoflurane, resulting in ICER of £6494 per QALY 
gained and £31,567 per QALY gained. The remaining results reflect the sensitivity in other patient groups 
undergoing TIVA and mixed anaesthesia, but to a lesser extent. The decrease and increase in probability of 
awareness yielded ICERs of £14,881 per QALY gained and £24,521 per QALY gained respectively. Again, 
the ICER is sensitive to a decrease in the effectiveness of the E-Entropy module, which results in an ICER of

for PTSD and the changes in the unit costs of sensors appear to drive the results in this group of patients.
Scenario analysis
Inclusion of anaesthesia-related complication (postoperative nausea and vomiting) The systematic 
review of patient outcomes did not identify any robust data that reported an estimate of the effect of 
E-Entropy monitoring on risk of PONV. We developed a scenario analysis using data from a meta-analysis 
by Liu,105 on the effectiveness of BIS on a range of outcomes including PONV, to investigate the potential 
impact of including this outcome on the cost-effectiveness results.

For this scenario analysis we assumed a baseline PONV risk of 30%,102–104 for standard clinical monitoring 
and applied the OR derived in the meta-analysis (0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99) to estimate risk for E-Entropy 
monitored patients. We assumed that all treatments (such as prophylaxis against PONV) were the same for 
each treatment group, and that all patients experiencing PONV were treated using 4mg ondansetron by 
intramuscular or slow i.v. injection (unit cost=£5.39, BNF33).
Tables 89 and 90 report the results of this scenario analysis for high-risk patients and general surgical 
patients, respectively, undergoing GA with TIVA.

The base-case ICER of £14,421 per QALY gained was insensitive to both changes in OR of PONV with 
E-Entropy monitoring. An OR of 0.77 applied to the baseline risk resulted in an ICER of £14,010 per QALY 
gained, whereas an OR of 0.56 resulted in an ICER of £13,576 per QALY gained.
Again, changes in the OR of PONV as a result of E-Entropy monitoring make little difference to the ICER 
in a general surgical population undergoing TIVA. The base-case ICER of £31,131 applying Ellerkmann 
and colleagues’ anaesthetic consumption estimates, became £29,324 and £30,250 per QALY gained 
with ORs applied to the baseline risk of 0.56 and 0.77 respectively. Applying Gruenewald and colleagues’ 
anaesthetic consumption estimates resulted in ICERs of £30,550 per QALY gained (OR 0.77) and £29,624 
per QALY gained (OR 0.56).
Tables 91 and 92 report the results of this scenario analysis for patients at high risk and for patients at 
average risk of intraoperative awareness, respectively, undergoing GA with mixed anaesthesia (induction 
with i.v. anaesthetic and maintenance with i.v. and inhaled anaesthetic).
Where the OR for PONV was changed to 0.77 and 0.56 in a high-risk population receiving mixed 
anaesthesia, the ICER reduced slightly, but was generally insensitive to the changes, which resulted in ICER 
of £18,833 and £18,271 per QALY gained respectively.

The changes in OR for PONV to 0.77 and 0.56 again resulted in a slightly larger reduction in the ICER in 
this scenario (in a general surgical population receiving mixed anaesthesia), to £17,934 per QALY gained 
and £16,813 per QALY gained respectively.
Scenario analyses for probability of intraoperative awareness for patients at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and for the general surgical population Our review of published studies of 
the incidence of intraoperative awareness identified substantial uncertainty over the estimated values. We 
used pooled values across identified studies in the base-case analysis. However, the value adopted for ‘high 
risk’ is lower than the 1% incidence cited in the publication reporting one of the included trials44 (based on 
incidences reported by Phillips and colleagues,138 Ranta and colleagues112 and Myles and colleagues79), and 
the pooled estimate adopted for a general surgical population excluded two outlying studies (one high 
and one low extreme value).
For this scenario analysis we replace the base-case estimate for probability of awareness in high-risk 
population (0.45%) with the higher value of 1% (Table 93). The effect of this is to reduce the ICER to 
£6059 per QALY gained for TIVA and to £8882 for mixed anaesthesia.
For the general surgical population, we replaced the base-case estimate for probability of awareness 
(0.16%) with the extreme high and low values reported in the literature (0.99% and 0.007%, Tables 94 
and 95).
The ICER was sensitive to changes in the probability of awareness, where the outlying values were 
adopted. In each case (where anaesthetic consumption estimates were applied from either Ellerkmann and 
colleagues62 or Gruenewald and colleagues55), these range from approximately £5600 per QALY gained to 
approximately £80,000 per QALY gained respectively.
In threshold analyses we found that depth of anaesthesia monitoring with E-Entropy for patients 
undergoing GA with TIVA was cost-effective if the probability of awareness was >0.192–0.194%, at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring with E-Entropy 
was cost-effective if the probability of awareness was >0.315–0.318%, at a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of £20,000 per QALY gained. We report a range of values for the probability of awareness, as the exact 
values depend on which study the anaesthetic drug consumption is based (Ellerkmann and colleagues62 or 
Gruenewald and colleagues55).
The ICER is sensitive to a scenario where the outlying probabilities of awareness are applied in a general 
population undergoing mixed anaesthesia. Where the lower probability of 0.007 is applied, the ICER 
increases to £42,599 per QALY gained. Where the probability is set at 0.99%, the ICER decreases 
considerably to £3286.
In threshold analyses we found that depth of anaesthesia monitoring with E-Entropy for patients 
undergoing mixed GA was cost-effective if the probability of awareness was >0.098%, at a willingness-topay threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. The required probability, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000 per QALY gained, is 0.196%.
Impact of assumptions on number of patients per device-year In order to apportion the capital cost of 
the depth of anaesthesia monitoring modules we required an estimate of the number of patients/cases in 
which the monitor module was used in each year (patients per device-year), throughout its assumed 5-year 
effective life. The estimate used for the general surgical population was 1000 patients per year (equivalent 
to four patients per day over 250 working days per year), based on discussion with clinical experts. This 
scenario analysis investigates the impact of this assumption on the estimated incremental cost associated 
with E-Entropy monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring, and the resulting effect on 
the ICER. Table 96 reports the incremental cost and ICER for E-Entropy compared with standard clinical 
monitoring at four selected values for the number of patients per device-year: the base-case value of 500

year) and 1500 (six patients per day over 250 working days per year). This suggests that the assumed 
number of patients per device-year only has a substantial impact on incremental cost (hence on the ICER) 
at very low volumes.
Impact of alternative assumptions on the utility decrement for PTSD The QoL decrement applied in 
the base case was based on Freed and colleagues’120 paper on veterans with PTSD. In order to investigate 
the impact of a sparse evidence base on HRQoL in a group of patients with PTSD, a scenario analyses was 
undertaken. The utility decrement was adjusted to 0.50 and 0.75 in high-risk and general surgical groups 
receiving either TIVA or mixed anaesthesia (Tables 97 and 98).
The ICER was sensitive to these alternative scenarios in high-risk patients, both receiving TIVA and mixed 
anaesthesia. Where the PTSD decrement was increased to 0.5 in TIVA and mixed anaesthesia, the ICER 
reduced to £4152 per QALY gained and £5835 per QALY gained respectively. Where the PTSD decrement 
was increased further, the ICER decreased again to £2827 and £3997 per QALY gained in the TIVA and 
mixed anaesthesia groups respectively.
The scenario analyses using alternative PTSD decrements in the general population reflect the results in the 
high-risk population: there is a substantial reduction in the ICER where these are decreased.
Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring
Base case
Total intravenous anaesthesia The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for patients considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring by Narcotrend are presented in Table 99.
Narcotrend monitoring was modelled as being associated with 10.8 cases of awareness, compared with 
45 cases among patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in a cohort of 10,000 patients. This results 
in a reduction of 11.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 3.5), which includes a reduction of six cases of PTSD 
(from 8.0 to 1.9).

The cost of standard clinical monitoring during anaesthesia in high-risk patients was lower than for 
Narcotrend depth of anaesthesia monitoring, with the incremental cost being £3.86. The increased cost 
for Narcotrend monitoring is largely the result of the additional costs of the depth monitor (80% of the 
per patient cost) rather than the sensors attached to the patients (20% of the per patient cost). There is no 
reduction in anaesthetic costs associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring, for this group of patients, 
although some of the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring is offset by reduced costs 
associated with psychological sequelae of awareness (Table 100).
Patients in both groups incurred a slight QALY loss, resulting from psychological sequelae of awareness 
(LPS and PTSD) and from POCD in older patients. This was lower in the Narcotrend-monitored patients, 
with a difference of 0.0007 QALY, resulting in an ICER of £5681 per QALY gained.
The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for a general surgical population (not just those at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness) undergoing GA with TIVA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring by Narcotrend are presented in Table 101.
In the general surgical population, Narcotrend monitoring was modelled as being associated with 3.8 
cases of awareness, compared with 16 cases in patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts 
of 10,000 patients. This results in a reduction of four cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 1.3), which includes a 
reduction of 2.1 cases of PTSD (from 2.8 to 0.7).
In this patient population, depth of anaesthesia monitoring with Narcotrend is associated with lower costs 
than for standard clinical monitoring (see Table 101). This results from reduction in the use of anaesthetic 
drugs (and to a lesser extent with lower PTSD-related costs, because of the lower incidence of awareness), 
which offset the additional costs associated with depth of anaesthesia monitoring (Table 102).
Given the lower probability of intraoperative awareness in this group of patients, the QALY losses for 
both standard clinical monitoring and Narcotrend monitoring, resulting from psychological sequelae of 
awareness (LPS and PTSD), are lower than for the high-risk group. The QALY loss arising from the LPS and 
PTSD following awareness and from POCD are lower for patients monitored with Narcotrend compared 
with those receiving standard clinical monitoring. As better outcomes are modelled as being achieved at 
lower costs, Narcotrend dominates standard clinical monitoring for this population.

Mixed anaesthesia [induction with intravenous anaesthetic (remifentanil) and maintenance with 
intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic (remifentanil and desflurane)] The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for 
patients considered at high risk of intraoperative awareness undergoing mixed anaesthesia, comparing 
standard clinical monitoring with depth of anaesthesia monitoring by Narcotrend are presented in 
Table 103.
Narcotrend monitoring is modelled as being associated with 20.3 cases of awareness, compared with 45 
cases among patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This results in a 
reduction of 8.1 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 6.6), which includes a reduction of 4.4 cases of PTSD (from 8.0 
to 3.6).
In a high-risk population receiving mixed anaesthesia, Narcotrend monitoring resulted in an incremental 
cost of £4.21. The increased costs in the Narcotrend group are associated with the depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring costs. Anaesthetic drug costs are the same in each group, but again the monitoring costs 
incurred by the Narcotrend group are, to an extent, offset by reduced costs associated with PTSD (see 
Table 104).
The reduced QALY loss in high-risk patients undergoing monitoring with Narcotrend compared with 
patients undergoing standard monitoring occurred as a result of the lower probability of awareness in this 
group, with a difference of 0.0005 QALY. This resulted in an ICER of £8033 per QALY gained.

The costs, QALY and ICER modelled for a general surgical population (not just those at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness) undergoing mixed GA, comparing standard clinical monitoring with depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring by Narcotrend are presented in Table 105.
Narcotrend monitoring was modelled as being associated with 7.2 cases of awareness, compared with 16 
cases among patients receiving standard clinical monitoring, in cohorts of 10,000 patients. This results in 
a reduction of three cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 2.3), which includes a reduction of 1.5 cases of PTSD (from 
2.8 to 1.3).
Narcotrend monitoring is associated with lower costs than for standard clinical monitoring in this patient 
population (Table 106). This arises from the relatively small additional cost of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring with Narcotrend (the sensors are available at a low cost, whereas the capital cost of the 
monitor is spread across a relatively large patient throughput) and from savings because of a reduction in 
the use of anaesthetic drugs (and to a lesser extent with lower PTSD-related costs, because of the lower 
incidence of awareness).
As better outcomes are modelled as being achieved at lower costs, Narcotrend dominates standard clinical 
monitoring for this population.

Deterministic sensitivity analysis
Total intravenous anaesthesia One-way sensitivity analyses of key parameters were undertaken in both 
the general surgical population and the high-risk surgical population undergoing general anaesthetic using 
TIVA. The results are shown in Tables 107 and 108.
The one-way sensitivity analysis of key parameters in the high-risk surgical group receiving TIVA resulted in 
ICER ranging from £1123 to £25,656 per QALY gained. However, the ICER appears robust to the majority 
of changes in parameters in this group. The ICER also increases where the probability of awareness, of LPS, 
and the PTSD decrements are reduced, and the relative risk of awareness increases.
The one-way sensitivity analysis of key parameters demonstrated that the ICER in the general surgical 
population is robust where these parameters are varied. In each case Narcotrend dominates standard

The results of the one way-sensitivity analysis in high-risk patients undergoing mixed anaesthesia 
range from £2290 to £29,010 per QALY gained. The ICER appears least sensitive to changes in the LPS 
decrement and most affected by the changes in probability of awareness to 0.0119 and 0.006, resulting 
in the lowest and highest ICERs of £2290 and £29,010 per QALY gained respectively. The results are also 
sensitive to the estimated effect of monitoring on the incidence of awareness, the proportion of patients 
with LPS who develop PTSD and to the size of utility decrement for PTSD.
The one-way sensitivity analysis suggests that the results in the general surgical population are generally 
robust to variation in key input parameters. The exception is the proportional change in use of desflurane. 
The upper limit of the 95% CI is close to zero, indicating only limited savings in cost of anaesthetic gas to 
offset against the cost of Narcotrend monitoring, resulting in a positive incremental cost.

Scenario analysis
Inclusion of anaesthesia-related complication (postoperative nausea and vomiting) The systematic 
review of patient outcomes did not identify any robust data that reported an estimate of the effect of 
Narcotrend monitoring on risk of PONV. We developed a scenario analysis using data from a meta-analysis 
by Liu,105 on the effectiveness of BIS on a range of outcomes including PONV, to investigate the potential 
impact of including this outcome on the cost-effectiveness results.

For this scenario analysis we assumed a baseline PONV risk of 30%,102–104 for standard clinical monitoring 
and applied the OR derived in the meta-analysis (0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99) to estimate risk for 
Narcotrend-monitored patients. We assumed that all treatments (such as prophylaxis against PONV) were 
the same for each treatment group, and that all patients experiencing PONV were treated using 4mg 
ondansetron by intramuscular or slow i.v. injection (unit cost=£5.39; BNF33).
Tables 111 and 112 report the results of this scenario analysis for high-risk patients and general surgical 
patients, respectively, undergoing GA with TIVA.
Variation in the OR of PONV applied in the model does not have an impact on the ICER, either in the case 
of the high-risk population (Table 111) or in the general surgical population (Table 112) undergoing TIVA.
Tables 113 and 114 report the results of this scenario analysis for patients at high risk and for patients at 
average risk of intraoperative awareness, respectively, undergoing GA with mixed anaesthesia (induction 
with i.v. anaesthetic and maintenance with i.v. and inhaled anaesthetic).
Where the variations in the OR of PONV are applied to the high-risk patients undergoing mixed 
anaesthesia there is a slight reduction in the ICER. An OR of 0.77 results in an ICER of £7499 per QALY 
gained and an OR of 0.56 yields an ICER of £6937 per QALY gained in this group.
In the case of the general risk group receiving mixed anaesthesia, the ICER is robust to the variation in risk 
of PONV, and Narcotrend continues to dominate.

Scenario analyses for probability of intraoperative awareness for patients at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and for the general surgical population Our review of published studies of 
the incidence of intraoperative awareness identified substantial uncertainty over the estimated values. We 
used pooled values across identified studies in the base-case analysis. However, the value adopted for ‘high 
risk’ is lower than the 1% incidence cited in the publication reporting one of the included trials44 (based on 
incidences reported by Phillips and colleagues,138 Ranta and colleagues112 and Myles and colleagues79), and 
the pooled estimate adopted for a general surgical population excluded two outlying studies (one high 
and one low extreme value).
For this scenario analysis we replace the base-case estimate for probability of awareness in high-risk 
population (0.45%) with the higher value of 1% (Table 115).
The ICERs decrease substantially in the high-risk population receiving either TIVA or mixed anaesthesia, 
where the probability of awareness is set to 1%, from £8033 to £3047 per QALY gained in the group 
receiving mixed, and from £5681 to £1705 in the group receiving TIVA.
In the general surgical population, we replace the base-case estimate for probability of awareness (0.16%) 
with the extreme high and low values reported in the literature (0.99% and 0.007%, Tables 116 and 117).
Where the outlying probabilities are applied the ICER is robust and Narcotrend continues to dominate in 
TIVA and mixed anaesthesia patients.
Impact of assumptions on number of patients per device-year In order to apportion the capital cost of 
the depth of anaesthesia monitoring modules, we required an estimate of the number of patients/cases in

which the monitor module was used in each year (patients per device-year), throughout its assumed 5-year 
effective life. The estimate used for the general surgical population was 1000 patients per year (equivalent 
to four patients per day over 250 working days per year), which was based on discussion with clinical 
experts. This scenario analysis investigates the impact of this assumption on the estimated incremental cost 
associated with Narcotrend monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring, and the resulting 
effect on the ICER. Table 118 reports the incremental cost and ICER for Narcotrend compared with

patients per day over 250 working days per year). This suggests that the assumed number of patients per 
device-year only has a substantial impact on incremental cost (hence on the ICER) at very low throughput.
Impact of alternative assumptions on the utility decrement for post-traumatic stress disorder The 
QoL decrement applied in the base case was based on Freed and colleagues’120 paper on veterans with 
PTSD. In order to investigate the impact of a sparse evidence base on HRQoL in a group of patients with 
PTSD, a scenario analysis was undertaken. The utility decrement was adjusted to 0.50 and 0.75 in high-risk 
and general surgical groups receiving either TIVA (Table 119) or mixed anaesthesia (Table 120).
The ICER is substantially reduced in the high-risk surgical population where higher decrements for PTSD 
QoL are applied (see Table 119). These are reduced to £1636 and £1114 per QALY gained for a 0.5 and 
0.75 decrement, respectively, in the group undergoing TIVA. The ICER is reduced to £2420 and £1658 for 
a 0.5 and 0.75 decrement in the group undergoing mixed anaesthesia.
Where the alternative values for PTSD decrement are applied for the general surgical population in both 
the TIVA and mixed anaesthesia groups, Narcotrend continues to dominate (see Table 120).
Cost-effectiveness summary
We have presented modelled cost-effectiveness analyses for BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend compared with 
standard clinical monitoring, for two modes of anaesthetic administration. There is substantial uncertainty 
associated with the analysis, given the weakness of the evidence base for the majority of outcomes 
included in the model. No robust evidence was identified on the effectiveness of E-Entropy or Narcotrend 
in avoiding intraoperative awareness or POCD and, in the absence of such evidence, we have assumed 
that the effect estimates derived for BIS can be applied. However, even in the case of BIS the evidence 
base is currently severely lacking. There is also limited evidence on the baseline incidence of anaesthetic 
complications included in the model. There is more evidence on the benefit in terms of reduced 
anaesthetic drug consumption, although for some technologies the evidence is inconclusive.
Overall the economic evaluation indicates that, for general surgical patients, some of the additional costs 
of depth of anaesthesia monitoring may be offset by reduction in consumption of anaesthetic drugs. 
However, the size of these savings may not fully offset the additional cost. Given the comparative rarity 
of awareness, cost-savings through the avoidance of PTSD are unlikely to offset the additional costs. 
However, avoidance of the psychological sequelae of awareness yields gains in outcome that, depending

on the utility losses associated with these conditions, may be acceptable in cost-effectiveness terms. The 
economic analysis suggests that, other than at comparatively low patient volumes, the acquisition cost of 
the DoA modules may be less significant in determining cost-effectiveness than the cost of consumables – 
in particular the sensors attached to the patient. Other key determinants of the cost-effectiveness of depth 
of anaesthesia monitoring appear to be the baseline risk of awareness and, unsurprisingly, the effect size in 
terms of avoiding awareness.

F
ew of the trials included in this report reported whether or not anaesthetists had received training in use 
of the EEG devices. In their evidence submissions to NICE, the manufacturers of the three EEG devices 
assessed suggested varying lengths of training necessary, from 30 minutes’ instruction in placing of the 
sensors for the E-Entropy module, to a whole day of lecture and training for Narcotrend in the operating 
theatre. The manufacturer of BIS suggests no additional training is necessary, but that a modest amount 
of additional training further enhances safe and effective use. Expert clinical opinion suggests that it is 
relatively straightforward to learn how to attach sensors and interpret the device values, but also that 
some training may be of benefit. In terms of cost implications, training would be provided for free by the 
manufacturer in the operating theatre, and/or anaesthetists would be able to access education materials 
including online multimedia courses. The main cost would therefore be for the operating theatre and the 
anaesthetist’s time. Once a device has been installed and any initial training given, anaesthetists would 
need a period of time to become accustomed to using the device in practice.
The long-term impact of intraoperative awareness can have a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of patients. Psychological symptoms7
 such as disturbed sleep, phobias, depression, anxiety and 
PTSD may limit daily activities including their ability to work, resulting in periods of sickness absence 
and with consequent financial implications for employers. In extreme cases patients may have to cease 
working altogether and therefore their financial livelihood will be significantly impaired, and they may 
become reliant on welfare services. There may also be knock-on effects on patients’ families and friends, 
for example, to provide social, emotional and practical support. Strain may be placed on marriages and 
partnerships, leading to separation in more severe cases. Patients may seek treatment for their symptoms 
which will involve primary and community care services (e.g. to provide counselling and/or medication) 
and in some cases secondary care (e.g. psychiatric supervision).

Chapter 5 Discussion
Statement of principal findings
Systematic review of patient outcomes
The eligible evidence base for BIS-guided anaesthesia (11 RCTs, plus 31 RCTs included in the Cochrane BIS 
review34) is larger than that for entropy-guided or Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia (seven and four RCTs 
respectively). A notable feature of the primary studies within each of the BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend 
technologies is that very few RCTs were methodologically similar to one another, which in most cases 
precluded the pooling of outcomes across studies.
Explicit intraoperative awareness
The effect estimate for intraoperative awareness in the Cochrane BIS review34 was updated using data 
from two recent large RCTs. One of these was the BAG-RECALL RCT by Avidan and colleagues,44 which 
compared BIS monitoring with monitoring of end-tidal anaesthetic agent concentration. The trial, which 
took place across three centres in the USA and Canada, randomised at least 3020 patients per study 
group, and patients received only inhaled GA. The RCT by Zhang and colleagues40 also recruited large 
numbers of patients (around 5000) but was conducted in China across 13 centres, and patients received 
TIVA, rather than inhaled anaesthesia. BIS-guided TIVA was compared against routine TIVA (no further 
details given). Both trials were statistically powered to detect explicit intraoperative awareness in patients 
considered to be at higher risk. The trials reported contrasting findings, with Avidan and colleagues44
noting a higher but non-statistically significant incidence of definite awareness in BIS-monitored patients, 
and Zhang and colleagues40 finding a statistically significantly lower incidence of confirmed awareness in 
patients monitored with BIS.
When both of these trials were added to the Cochrane meta-analysis the pooled Peto’s OR remained 
statistically significant 0.45 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.81), favouring BIS, though with significant heterogeneity. 
We classified the trials into subgroups based on the type of GA used (inhaled only; mixed inhaled and 
i.v.; total i.v.). The pooled Peto’s OR for the subgroups of mixed inhaled and i.v. GA, and TIVA were 
both consistent with the overall pooled OR (i.e. statistically significant in favour of BIS). In contrast, the 
pooled estimate for the trials of inhaled GA, including the BAG-RECALL RCT44 and another large RCT (the 
B-Unaware trial27), favoured standard clinical monitoring although the confidence intervals overlapped 
with 1 indicating potential advantage to both BIS and to standard clinical monitoring. Importantly the 
BAG-RECALL RCT44 was designed to overcome some of the methodological limitations of the B-Unaware 
trial,27 such as use of a larger sample of patients, more than one centre, and use of only major risk factors 
for awareness. It is not fully clear why the results of this trial were contrary to expectation. Notably these 
trials compared a structured BIS protocol with a structured ETAC protocol, comprising target anaesthetic 
concentration-linked audible alarms, staff education and checklists. The comparators reported in the other 
trials in the meta-analysis did not report use of structured protocols.
The remaining trials that reported intraoperative awareness either assessed this as a main outcome 
(one RCT on BIS49) or as a secondary outcome (three RCTs on BIS,48,51,62 six of the seven RCTs on 
entropy,54,55,57,58,61,62 and all four of the RCTs on Narcotrend59,60,63,64). Although the RCT by Kerssens and 
colleagues49 specified that intraoperative awareness was the main outcome, the authors reported that the 
study was not powered statistically for this outcome. None of the remaining studies reported whether or 
not it was powered statistically for detecting a clinically meaningful difference in intraoperative awareness. 
In these RCTs the sample sizes ranged from 10 to 160 patients per study group, which most likely would 
be insufficient for detecting clinically meaningful differences in intraoperative awareness, given the low 
incidence of this event (see Table 1 in Incidence of intraoperative awareness). Only two of these RCTs 
reported cases of intraoperative awareness, both in adult populations, but did not test differences between

the study groups statistically. Kerssens and colleagues49 reported that incidence rates in BIS-guided and 
standard clinical monitoring groups were 2.9% (2/67) and 1.6% (1/61) respectively. Gruenewald and 
colleagues55 reported that incidence rates of intraoperative awareness in entropy-guided and standard 
clinical practice groups were 0% (0/37) and 2.9% (1/35) respectively. These incidence rates are relatively 
high compared with those estimated from much larger studies (see Table 1), although in the Gruenewald 
study awareness was experienced by only one patient.55
The case of awareness reported by Gruenewald and colleagues55 might have happened outside of the 
period of GA, as patients were asked if they had any memory or awareness during different stages of 
their procedure, including in the ward, induction room, during surgery or extubation, or in the recovery 
room.55 The reason for the relatively high incidence of awareness observed in the Kerssens study49 is not 
clear. Although Kerssens and colleagues49 did not specify that their patients were at risk of awareness, 
the patients did appear to be relatively old (early 60s), possibly overweight or obese, and half of them 
had notable illness (ASA physical score grade III). The awareness assessment conducted by Kerssens and 
colleagues49 involved asking patients five questions that were very similar to those of the Brice interview. 
Both of these RCTs49,55 stated that their outcome assessors were blinded to the study group. Assessment 
of awareness in these RCTs took place 6 hours49 or 24 hours55 after surgery, without any longer-term 
follow-up. In fact, only the large trial by Avidan and colleagues44 conducted follow-up assessments longer 
than 3 days after surgery (30 days after extubation); all other trials that assessed intraoperative awareness 
conducted follow-up assessments only 1 day or less post surgery,54,57,59,60 3 days post surgery48,58,61–64 or did 
not state when follow-up occurred.51 As occurrences of intraoperative awareness may take time to develop 
(see Incidence of intraoperative awareness), these follow-up periods may have been too short for detecting 
all cases of awareness.
Weighing up the strengths and limitations of the studies, an appropriate conclusion would be that, in 
patients considered to be at increased risk of awareness, BIS monitoring is associated with a reduced 
likelihood of explicit intraoperative awareness. However, this may not be applicable where inhaled GA 
is solely used. There is no evidence that EEG device-titrated anaesthesia significantly affects incidence of 
explicit intraoperative awareness in surgical patients not considered to be at increased risk, primarily as 
trials large enough to detect awareness have not been conducted.
Implicit intraoperative awareness
Implicit awareness (i.e. awareness that the patient does not necessarily recall experiencing) was reported 
only in one BIS trial, as a secondary outcome.49 The assessment involved presenting patients audibly with 
words during anaesthesia then conducting specialist word recall tests after recovery from anaesthesia. 
The results showed that only patients in the BIS group selected target words more often than distractor 
words, and that patients in the BIS group selected target words more often than in the standard clinical 
monitoring group. Although appearing to indicate implicit intraoperative awareness, these findings would 
only have clinical relevance if the patients were followed up and found to have related clinical sequelae. 
Such follow-up has not been done and, in general, the possible longer-term implications for patients of 
implicit intraoperative awareness are not well understood.
Sequelae and long-term consequences of intraoperative awareness
None of the trials reported longer-term detrimental impacts of awareness such as PTSD. The BAG RECALL 
trial by Avidan and colleagues44 reported patient distress and sequelae associated with awareness as 
a post hoc secondary outcome, based on the Michigan Awareness Classification Instrument, in which 
distress related to intraoperative awareness includes reports of fear, anxiety, suffocation, a sense of doom 
or a sense of impending death. Avidan and colleagues44 found a higher percentage of distress in the 
BIS-monitored group (0.28% compared with 0.04%), but no statistically significant difference between the 
groups. No other trials included in the systematic review assessed patients’ distress, anxiety or depression.

Anaesthetic consumption
The RCTs that reported anaesthesia consumption as an outcome can be summarised in various ways, as 
they differed in their populations (adults or children) anaesthesia (volatile or i.v.), sample sizes, and the 
methods used to measure anaesthetic consumption. The specific details of the outcomes summarised in 
the table can be obtained from Table 9 (BIS), Table 17 (E-Entropy) and Table 24 (Narcotrend) in Results of 
systematic review of patient outcomes of this report.
Anaesthetic consumption was a statistically powered outcome in four RCTs: for sevoflurane in adults,61
propofol in adults,62 sevoflurane in children54 and propofol in children.46 The outcomes were powered to 
detect either a 20% reduction in anaesthetic consumption46,54,62 or a 50% reduction.61A further RCT on 
adults specified sevoflurane as the main outcome but the outcome was not powered statistically.58 The 
statistically powered RCT reported significant reductions of sevoflurane consumption under entropy-guided 
anaesthesia relative to standard clinical monitoring (i.e. favouring the E-Entropy group) in both adults61
and children,54 but no difference in propofol consumption between BIS, E-Entropy and standard clinical 
monitoring groups in adults.62 However, the last trial62 has high risk of bias because of an imbalance in the 
patient attrition between the study groups (see Quantity and quality of research available). The one trial 
that was powered to detect clinically relevant differences in propofol consumption in children46 did not 
report a statistical comparison between the study groups, but in this trial, by Bhardwaj and colleagues,46
the propofol consumption rate was higher in the BIS-guided than the standard clinical monitoring group 
(see Table 9). Overall, the findings from the statistically powered RCT indicate that E-Entropy-guided 
and BIS-guided anaesthesia reduce the consumption of sevoflurane but not propofol in both adults and 
children, although it should be noted that the methods used to assess anaesthesia consumption differed 
between the studies. None of the trials of Narcotrend were statistically powered to detect differences in 
anaesthetic consumption.
The remaining trials were not specifically powered to detect differences in anaesthetic consumption but 
their findings for sevoflurane consumption are similar to those of the powered trials. Three RCTs that 
assessed sevoflurane consumption in adults found that consumption was significantly lower in the BISguided group45,49 or E-Entropy-guided group58 than under standard clinical monitoring. Two RCTs that 
assessed sevoflurane in children also found consumption to be lower in the BIS group51 or E-Entropy 
group.54 In contrast with the statistically powered trials, most of the trials that assessed consumption of 
propofol as a secondary outcome, which were all on adult populations, reported significant differences 
in consumption in favour of the EEG-guided anaesthesia group. These differences were reported for 
E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia55,139 and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia,59,60,63 whereas one RCT on BISguided anaesthesia reported a reduced propofol consumption in the BIS group but without an indication 
of statistical significance.47
Two RCTs assessed the consumption of other anaesthetics as secondary outcomes. These were desflurane 
consumption in adults64 and isoflurane consumption in children.56 These trials found that EEG-guided 
anaesthesia significantly reduced consumption, either using Narcotrend monitoring in adults64 or E-Entropy 
monitoring in children.56
It was possible to update effect estimates for anaesthetic consumption in the Cochrane review34 for volatile 
anaesthesia (sevoflurane) using data from a RCT by Kerssens and colleagues,49 and for TIVA (propofol) 
using data from a RCT by Ellerkmann and colleagues.62 For both types of anaesthesia, the updated effect 
estimate (mean difference) remained statistically significantly different from zero and in favour of the BIS 
group. However, heterogeneity was statistically significant even when using a random-effects model.
Time to recovery from anaesthesia
Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed in several different ways. The most frequent measurements 
reported were time to eye opening (11 RCTs) and time to extubation (11 RCTs).

Other recovery outcomes that were assessed included time to arrival in the PACU (five RCTs); duration of 
stay in the PACU (two RCTs); time to discharge from the PACU (five RCTs); time to response to commands 
(three RCTs) time to recovery of orientation (three RCTs); time to first movement response (two RCTs); 
time to recovery based on recovery scores (two RCTs); time to spontaneous breathing (one RCT); time to 
laryngeal mask airway removal (one RCT); and time to phonation (one RCT). ‘PACU stay’ was an outcome 
in the Cochrane review34 but does not appear to distinguish between PACU admissions, stay and discharge 
times. For this reason the Cochrane review meta-analysis was not updated with data from the RCTs 
identified in the current review.
Time to eye opening
Four of the 11 RCTs that assessed this outcome were powered statistically to detect a difference between 
the study groups of 1.5 minutes,64 3 minutes55,63 or 5 minutes.56 Two of these powered trials detected a 
statistically significant difference in time to eye opening56,63 and two did not.55,64 Among the remaining 
seven RCTs46,48,51,54,57,61,62 that were not specifically powered for this outcome, one57 detected a significant 
difference between the study groups in time to eye opening and six46,48,51,54,61,62 did not. In the three 
RCTs56,57,63 that reported significant effects, the time to eye opening was consistently shorter in the 
EEG group than the standard clinical monitoring group. The significant reductions did not show any 
clear pattern with regard to whether the population (adults/children), EEG device used (BIS, E-Entropy, 
Narcotrend) or type of anaesthesia (volatile, total i.v. or mixed) could be explanatory variables. It is unclear 
whether or not these differences would impact on the comparability of the findings (and they do not 
appear to have been considered in the Cochrane review34). The statistically significant reductions in time 
to eye opening ranged from 2.72 to 5.9 minutes. It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about 
the clinical significance of these reductions (e.g. their implications for health services) because the majority 
of the RCTs did not detect significant reductions in time to eye opening; one of the four trials that did 
report a significant effect is at high risk of bias because of the authors’ conflict of interests57 (see Quantity 
and quality of research available); and the pooled effect estimate from the Cochrane review,34 although 
statistically significant, has high heterogeneity in the random-effects model used.
Time to extubation
One of the 11 RCTs that assessed this outcome was powered statistically to detect a specific difference (of 
3 minutes) between the study groups, but did not detect a significant effect of Narcotrend monitoring 
on time to extubation.60 Among the remaining 10 RCTs, six reported a significant reduction in the time 
to extubation, which, in all cases, favoured the EEG group relative to standard clinical monitoring. The 
reductions in time to extubation in these six trials ranged from 1.4 minutes to 6 minutes, with the largest 
reductions being for Narcotrend-guided total i.v. anaesthesia in adults (6 minutes),63 BIS-guided volatile 
anaesthesia in children (5 minutes)53 and BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia in adults (4.2 minutes).45
In general, the same cautions in interpreting these results apply as noted above for the time to eye 
opening. Taking these limitations into consideration, there appears to be an overall favourable effect of 
EEG-guided anaesthetic monitoring on time to extubation but no clear pattern that would identify possible 
explanatory variables (such as the importance of population, EEG monitor or type of anaesthesia). It is 
unlikely that a saving of 6 minutes (the best achieved) in the time to extubation would have importance for 
patients or for service provision, given that it represents <10% of the total time patients were undergoing 
surgical procedures.
Outcomes related to postanaesthesia care unit stay
None of the RCTs that assessed outcomes related to PACU stay was specifically powered statistically to 
detect differences in these outcomes.
All five RCTs that reported the time to arrival at the PACU found that the arrival time was significantly 
shorter under EEG-guided anaesthesia than following standard clinical monitoring.48,56,57,63,64 Together, 
these RCTs represented both adults and children, different types of anaesthesia, and different EEG

monitoring devices. The time savings ranged from 1.4 minutes to 5.8 minutes, with the largest 
differences being for Narcotrend-guided TIVA in adults (5.8 minutes),63 BIS-guided mixed anaesthesia in 
adults (4.7 minutes)48 and E-Entropy-guided mixed anaesthesia in children (4.0 minutes).56 A difficulty 
in comparing these studies is that the starting point for measuring the time of arrival at the PACU was 
variable and sometimes unclear.
The two RCTs that reported the duration of stay in the PACU both examined BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia 
in children and both reported significant reductions in the duration of stay in the BIS-guided anaesthesia 
group compared with standard clinical monitoring.52,53 In these RCTs the time savings in PACU stay ranged 
from 16 minutes53 to 26 minutes.52 These RCTs, which were both by Messieha and colleagues,52,53 were 
similar and studied children undergoing complete dental rehabilitation. A notable difference is that in 
one RCT the target BIS value was 55–65,53 whereas in the other RCT the target BIS value was 65–70.52
Although the higher BIS values in the latter trial would represent lighter depth of anaesthesia, both of 
these trials supplemented their BIS-guided anaesthesia with monitoring of clinical signs, which makes it 
difficult to determine whether or not the differences between the trials in PACU stay relate directly to the 
use of different target BIS values.
Three of the five RCTs that reported time to PACU discharge found significant differences between EEGguided anaesthesia and standard clinical monitoring.45,48,52 These trials were all on BIS-guided anaesthesia, 
and included volatile anaesthesia in adults,45 mixed anaesthesia in adults48 or volatile anaesthesia in 
children.52 In all cases the time to discharge was shorter in the BIS-guided group, with the time saved 
ranging from 6.7 minutes to 30 minutes. The trials that reported the longest time savings, of 30 minutes52
and 24.7 minutes,48 both measured time to discharge from the end of GA. These reductions in discharge 
times are relatively large compared with the total durations of surgery in these trials, which were 
approximately 91 minutes (adults)48 and 139 minutes (children),52 suggesting possible benefits for patient 
throughput or PACU bed occupancy, as well as indicating improved clinical recovery of patients.
As noted above, the ‘PACU stay’ outcome in the Cochrane review34 seems to combine different aspects 
of time to PACU arrival, stay and/or discharge so may be difficult to interpret precisely. The outcome is 
consistent with the overall results of the individual RCTs included in the current systematic review, which 
indicate that EEG-guided anaesthesia reduces time to PACU admission, stay and discharge. However, 
although the pooled effect estimate in the Cochrane review is statistically significant, it has high statistical 
heterogeneity in the random-effects model used.
Time to response to commands
One RCT was powered statistically to detect a 20% difference in the time to response to verbal 
commands.57 This trial and a further RCT59 reported statistically significant reductions in time to response 
in E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia57 and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia59 compared with standard clinical 
practice. Both these trials were on adults receiving TIVA. The third RCT, on children receiving TIVA, did not 
provide quantitative data but stated that the study groups were comparable.46 The reductions in time to 
response to commands were 4.1 minutes (median) for time to hand squeezing on command (start time 
not reported)57 and 4.6 minutes (mean) for time from end of anaesthetic to eye opening on command 
(also referred to as ‘arousal time’).59
Time to recovery of orientation
The three RCTs measuring this outcome all reported statistically significant reductions in time to orientation 
in E-Entropy-guided54,57 or Narcotrend-guided59 anaesthesia compared with standard clinical practice. The 
reported time savings were 4.8 minutes (median) in E-Entropy-guided TIVA in adults,57 5.1 minutes (mean) 
in E-Entropy-guided volatile anaesthesia in children54 and 5.6 minutes (mean) in Narcotrend-guided TIVA 
in adults.59 However, these RCTs were not specifically powered for this outcome; none of them defined 
orientation, and only one defined the time period to orientation [stated as the time between opening eyes 
on command and (undefined) orientation59].

Time to first movement response
Both of the RCTs measuring this outcome examined BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia, in adults45 or 
children.51 The latter RCT was powered statistically to detect a 30% reduction in the time to first movement 
response. Both the trials reported statistically significant reductions in time to first movement in the 
BIS-guided anaesthesia group compared with standard clinical monitoring. The mean time savings were 
2.8 minutes45 and 2.5 minutes.51
Time to achieve specified recovery scores
Both of the RCTs measuring this outcome evaluated E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia in children who received 
either volatile anaesthetic (sevoflurane)54 or mixed anaesthetic (comprising propofol or sevoflurane for 
induction and isoflurane for maintenance).56 One trial defined time to complete recovery as the time to 
reach a score of ≥9 on a modified Aldrete scale.54 In the other trial time to recovery was defined as the 
time to reach a score of 6 on a modified Steward scale.56 Time to recovery was significantly shorter, by a 
mean of 4.5 minutes, in the E-Entropy-guided than the standard clinical practice group in one trial (Aldrete 
score),54 but did not differ significantly in the other trial.56
Time to spontaneous breathing
This RCT57 evaluated BIS-guided TIVA in adults and found a significantly shorter time to spontaneous 
breathing in the E-Entropy-guided than the standard clinical practice group. The median time difference 
was 2.33 minutes. Limitations to interpretation are: the RCT was not powered specifically for this outcome; 
the time to spontaneous breathing was not formally defined.
Time to laryngeal mask airway removal and time to phonation
This RCT51 evaluated BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia in children. The times from the last surgical suture 
to removal of the laryngeal mask airway and to phonation did not differ significantly between the BIS 
and standard clinical practice groups. A potential limitation to interpretation is that this trial was not 
specifically powered to detect differences in these outcomes.
Adverse effects of anaesthesia
Few of the trials reported anaesthesia-related adverse effects outcomes. The most frequently reported 
adverse outcomes were PONV (four RCTs), postoperative pain (two RCTs), POCD in elderly patients (one 
RCT) and emergence delirium in children (one RCT). These adverse effects are particularly relevant to 
situations in which overdosing of anaesthesia occurs. They were all reported as secondary outcomes (i.e. 
they were not specifically powered statistically) in the RCTs.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting
The four RCTs reporting this outcome evaluated BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia in children,51 entropyguided TIVA in adults55 and Narcotrend-guided TIVA in adults.59,60 In two trials PONV occurred but did not 
differ significantly in frequency between standard clinical monitoring and the BIS group51 or E-Entropy 
group.55 In the third trial no cases of PONV occurred in either the Narcotrend or standard monitoring 
practice groups.59 The remaining RCT reported PONV scores based on a VAS (no details provided) rather 
than frequency of occurrence, and found significantly higher (better) scores (indicating less frequent 
PONV) in the Narcotrend group compared with standard clinical practice.60 However, this difference was 
significant only 10 minutes after the end of surgery and not at 30 or 90 minutes post surgery.
Postoperative pain
The two RCTs that assessed postoperative pain evaluated E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia, either in adults 
under TIVA55 or in children under mixed anaesthesia.56 Pain was assessed as a score on a 0–10 scale55 or 
using the CHEOPS.56 Pain scores were significantly lower in the E-Entropy group than standard clinical 
monitoring for the adult population.55 In the paediatric population, the CHEOPS scores were significantly 
lower in the E-Entropy group at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after arrival in the PACU but not at 30 minutes 
after arrival.56

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction
The RCT that assessed this outcome evaluated BIS-guided i.v. anaesthesia in elderly patients.47 At 1 week 
post surgery, the incidence of POCD was 32.5% in the E-Entropy group and 39.1% in the standard clinical 
monitoring group. At 3 months post surgery the incidences were 8.1% and 12.0% respectively. Only the 
3-month results were statistically significant. Interpretation is limited because the RCT is reported only in a 
conference abstract, which provides very limited information about the study.
Emergence delirium 
The RCT that assessed this outcome was a study of BIS-guided volatile anaesthesia in children.51 In this 
trial, emergence delirium was assessed using the PAED Instrument. The highest PAED scores recorded 
during the first 30 minutes after awakening were compared between the study groups and did not 
differ significantly.
Economic evaluation
Systematic review of published economic evaluations
Systematic searches identified 134 potentially relevant references. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they 
were full economic evaluations, including an assessment of any depth of anaesthesia monitoring device, 
conducted in patients receiving general anaesthetic for surgery. One study met all of the a priori inclusion 
criteria. This was a cost-effectiveness study reporting outcomes as cost of preventing an episode of 
awareness in all patients97 using data drawn from a prospective study by Ekman and colleagues98 and from 
the RCT reported by Myles and colleagues79 and Avidan and colleagues.27 The analysis was limited only to 
the cost of the BIS and sensors to be attached to the patient, whereas outcomes were limited to cases of 
awareness. Based on an estimated incidence of awareness of 0.04% with BIS and 0.18% with standard 
clinical monitoring the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring was estimated as US$4410 
per case avoided. The authors of the study concluded that the use of BIS monitoring was unlikely to be 
cost-effective. However, the results and conclusions should be viewed with caution because of weaknesses 
in methodology and poor reporting quality.
De novo economic evaluation
We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring compared with standard clinical monitoring. The model incorporated evidence on outcomes 
from the systematic review of patient outcomes (change in anaesthetic drug consumption, change in 
incidence of awareness and POCD) combined with data identified through targeted searches (incidence of 
long-term psychological sequelae of awareness, duration and cost of PTSD, QOL impact of LPS and PTSD, 
duration of POCD). Outcomes in the model are expressed as QALY. The model evaluates costs from the 
perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Costs are expressed in UK sterling (pounds, £) at a 
2011 price base. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using ICER for each technology, compared with standard 
clinical monitoring. Separate analyses are presented for each of the included technologies, compared with 
standard clinical monitoring – the included technologies are not compared with each other as this was not 
within the scope of the appraisal issued by NICE.
Bispectral Index compared with standard clinical monitoring
We presented a base-case analysis for two modes of anaesthetic administration [TIVA and mixed 
anaesthesia (induction with i.v. anaesthesia and maintenance with inhaled anaesthesia or a combination 
of inhaled and i.v. anaesthetic)] and for two patient populations (those considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and a general surgical population, at average risk of intraoperative awareness).
For patients undergoing GA with TIVA, we used the OR of awareness with BIS monitoring (0.24), 
compared with standard clinical monitoring, reported in the meta-analysis in our systematic review of 
patient outcomes (see Results of systematic review of patient outcomes) and baseline awareness risks 
identified and pooled in this assessment (0.45% in patients at high risk of intraoperative awareness and

0.16% for a general surgical population, at average risk of intraoperative awareness) to estimate the risk 
reduction for awareness and its psychological sequelae associated with BIS monitoring. All of the trials 
included in the meta-analysis were conducted in patients at high risk of awareness. In the absence of any 
evidence on the effectiveness of BIS on the incidence of awareness in the general surgical population, we 
applied the same OR reported in the meta-analysis to both groups of patients.
Anaesthetic drug costs were based on reported consumption in trials included in the meta-analysis 
reported in the systematic review of patient outcomes (see Results of systematic review of patient 
outcomes). None of the trials included in the meta-analysis of drug consumption were conducted in 
patients at high risk of awareness, as these did not report anaesthetic drug consumption. In the model we 
assumed that the clinical characteristics of high-risk patients mean that anaesthetists will be particularly 
cautious regarding the dose of anaesthetic drugs and that the higher risk of awareness is associated with a 
tendency to underdose patients. As a result, we assumed that the potential reduction in anaesthetic dose, 
through the use of depth of anaesthesia monitoring, would not apply in this group of patients.
In cohorts of 10,000 patients, at high risk of intraoperative awarenes GA with TIVA, BIS monitoring was 
modelled as being associated with 10.8 cases of awareness, compared with 45 in patients receiving 
standard clinical monitoring. This resulted in a reduction of 11 cases of LPS (from 14.7 to 3.5), which 
included a reduction of six cases of PTSD (from 8.0 to 1.9). The modelled cost per patient was higher with 
BIS monitoring than for standard clinical monitoring, although some of the additional cost was offset 
by reduced costs associated with psychological sequelae of awareness. The majority of the additional 
cost of BIS monitoring was attributable to the sensors attached to the patient (88% of additional cost, 
per patient). By reducing the incidence of awareness and longer-term effects of POCD, BIS monitoring 
was associated with improved outcomes. The ICER, for BIS compared with standard clinical monitoring 
in this population was £22,339. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to 
the baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness of BIS in reducing awareness, probability of LPS, QoL 
decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of sensors. Scenario 
analyses were undertaken to address the question of variables omitted from the base case and to explore 
the impact of key baseline assumptions. These indicate that the cost-effectiveness results were largely 
insensitive to including an effect of BIS on PONV and to assumptions regarding patient throughput (except 
at comparatively low volumes, below 500 cases per year per module), whereas they were highly sensitive 
to assumptions regarding the baseline risk of awareness and the QoL decrement for PTSD.
For the population of general surgical patients undergoing GA with TIVA, BIS monitoring was modelled 
as being associated with 3.8 cases (per 10,000 patients) of awareness, compared with 16 in patients 
receiving standard clinical monitoring. This resulted in a reduction of four cases of LPS (from 5.2 to 1.3), 
which included a reduction of two cases of PTSD (from 2.8 to 0.7). Although the modelled cost per 
patient was higher with BIS than with standard clinical monitoring, a larger proportion was offset by 
reductions in other costs (primarily anaesthetic drug costs) than was the case for patients at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness (where no saving in anaesthetic drug costs was included). As with the analysis 
for high-risk patients, the majority of the additional cost of BIS monitoring was attributable to the sensors 
attached to the patient, rather than the monitor module itself. Given the lower baseline risk of awareness 
in this population, the QALY gain with BIS monitoring was lower (0.0003) than for high-risk patients. 
This resulted in a higher ICER (£34,565) despite the lower incremental cost estimated for this population, 
arising from reduced anaesthetic consumption. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER 
was sensitive to the same input parameters as for the population at high risk of awareness. In the majority 
of cases the ICER remained above £30,000 per QALY gained – the most favourable ICER was associated 
with a reduction in the cost of sensors. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those 
undertaken for high-risk patients. In particular, more favourable ICERs were associated with a higher 
baseline incidence of awareness and with a higher utility decrement for PTSD.
For patients undergoing mixed GA (induction with i.v. and maintenance including inhaled anaesthetic), 
we used the pooled OR of awareness with BIS monitoring, compared with standard clinical monitoring,

calculated in the meta-analysis reported in the systematic review of patient outcomes (0.45) and baseline 
awareness risks identified and pooled in this review to estimate the risk reduction for awareness and its 
psychological sequelae associated with BIS monitoring.
The baseline estimates of awareness, LPS and PTSD were the same as for high-risk patients undergoing 
TIVA (45, 14.7 and 8 per 10,000 patients respectively). However, given that the OR of awareness with BIS 
monitoring was higher in this analysis, the estimated reduction in LPS and PTSD was lower. In this patient 
population BIS monitoring was associated with 20.3 cases of awareness, 6.6 cases of LPS, including 3.6 
cases of PTSD. BIS monitoring had higher costs and improved outcomes compared with standard clinical 
monitoring. However, the QALY gain (0.0005) was lower than for patients undergoing TIVA. The ICER, for 
BIS compared with standard clinical monitoring in this population was £29,634. Deterministic sensitivity 
analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness of BIS 
in reducing awareness, probability of LPS, QoL decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who 
have PTSD and the cost of sensors. The highest incidence of awareness (1.19%), largest effect size (0.25, 
lower 95% confidence limit for OR of awareness with BIS vs standard clinical care), longest duration of 
LPS (1 year), highest probability of LPS (0.48), longest duration of PTSD (21.6 years), highest probability of 
PTSD (0.239), greatest utility reduction associated with PTSD (–0.134), largest proportion of PTSD patients 
being treated (100%) and lowest cost of sensors (£10.875, 75% of base-case value) tested in the sensitivity 
analysis resulted in ICERs below £30,000 per QALY gained, although the majority remained above £20,000 
per QALY gained. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those for high-risk patients 
undergoing TIVA.
The baseline estimates of awareness, LPS and PTSD in the population of general surgical patients 
undergoing mixed GA were the same as for TIVA (16, 5.2 and 2.8 per 10,000 patients respectively), 
whereas BIS monitoring in this patient population was modelled as being associated with 7.2, 2.3 and 1.3 
cases respectively. Although a proportion of the higher cost associated with BIS monitoring was offset by 
reduction in anaesthetic consumption, the cost-saving for inhaled anaesthesia was lower than for TIVA. As 
a result the incremental cost was greater (£12.91 compared with £10.98). Given the lower baseline risk 
of awareness in this population, the QALY gain with BIS monitoring was lower (0.0003) than for high-risk 
patients, resulting in a higher ICER (£49,198). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER 
was sensitive to the same input parameters as for the population at high risk of awareness. However, in 
all cases the ICER remained above conventional thresholds – the most favourable ICER was associated 
with a reduction in the cost of sensors. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were also similar to those 
undertaken for high-risk patients.
E-Entropy compared with standard clinical monitoring
A base-case analysis was presented for two modes of anaesthetic administration [TIVA and mixed 
anaesthesia (induction with i.v. anaesthesia and maintenance with inhaled anaesthesia or a combination 
of inhaled and i.v. anaesthetic)] and for two patient populations (those considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and a general surgical population, at average risk of intraoperative awareness).
Insufficient evidence was identified to estimate the effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring with 
E-Entropy on the incidence of intraoperative awareness or on POCD. In the absence of evidence specific to 
E-Entropy we have applied the effectiveness estimates derived for BIS, described above. This meant that 
the modelled clinical effectiveness of E-Entropy was identical to that reported for BIS – this is an untested 
assumption and must be considered a weakness in the evidence base for E-Entropy. Anaesthetic drug costs 
were based on consumption reported in the included trials, and were valued using current unit costs.
In patients considered at high risk of awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, the modelled cost per patient 
with E-Entropy monitoring was higher than with standard clinical monitoring, although some of the 
additional cost was offset by reduced cost associated with psychological sequelae of awareness. The 
additional cost of E-Entropy monitoring was approximately two-thirds that of BIS monitoring, with the 
majority being attributable to the sensors attached to the patient (80% of additional cost per patient).

E-Entropy monitoring was associated with improved outcomes, based on applying clinical effectiveness 
evidence reported for BIS. The ICER for E-Entropy compared with standard clinical monitoring in this 
population was £14,421. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the 
baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness of E-Entropy in reducing awareness, probability of LPS, 
QoL decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of sensors. The 
least favourable ICERs were for low baseline incidence of awareness, lower effectiveness on incidence 
of awareness and a lower probability of patients with awareness developing LPS. Scenario analyses, 
undertaken to consider variables omitted from the base case and to explore the impact of key baseline 
assumptions, indicated that the cost-effectiveness results were highly sensitive to assumptions regarding 
the baseline risk of awareness and the QoL decrement for PTSD, whereas they were largely insensitive to 
including an effect of E-Entropy on PONV and to assumptions regarding patient throughput (except at 
comparatively low volumes, <500 cases per year per module).
In the population of general surgical patients undergoing GA with TIVA, E-Entropy monitoring had 
a higher cost per patient than standard clinical monitoring. Anaesthetic drug costs derived from two 
clinical trials were modelled separately, as we considered them unsuitable for pooling, given substantial 
differences in the patient populations (one trial in orthopaedic surgery and the other in elective 
gynaecological laparoscopy). Neither of the trials showed an overall reduction in anaesthetic drug 
consumption and as a result there was no reduction in anaesthetic drug costs to offset the additional 
costs of E-Entropy monitoring. As with the analysis for high-risk patients, the majority of the additional 
cost of monitoring was attributable to the sensors attached to the patient. Given the lower baseline risk 
of awareness in this population, the QALY gain was lower than for high-risk patients, which resulted in 
a higher ICER (£31,131–31,430). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive 
to the baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness in reducing awareness, probability of LPS, QoL 
decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of sensors. The lower 
limit of anaesthetic drug consumption, the highest incidence of awareness, largest effect size, greatest 
probability of LPS, longest duration of PTSD, greatest probability of PTSD and lowest cost of sensors tested 
in the sensitivity analysis resulted in an ICER of <£30,000 per QALY gained, although they remained above 
£20,000 per QALY gained. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those undertaken for 
high-risk patients.
As noted above, in the absence of evidence specific to E-Entropy, we have applied the effectiveness 
estimates derived for BIS in this analysis. For patients undergoing mixed GA (induction with i.v. and 
maintenance including inhaled anaesthetic), the pooled OR of awareness with BIS monitoring, compared 
with standard clinical monitoring, (0.45) was higher than for TIVA, resulting in a smaller reduction in cases 
of awareness, LPS and PTSD.
In patients considered at high risk of awareness undergoing mixed GA, E-Entropy monitoring had higher 
costs and improved outcomes compared with standard clinical monitoring. However, the QALY gain 
(0.0005) was lower than for patients undergoing TIVA. The ICER for E-Entropy compared with standard 
clinical monitoring in this population was £19,367. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the 
ICER was sensitive to the baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness in reducing awareness, probability 
of LPS, QoL decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of 
sensors. The least favourable ICERs were found with a low incidence of awareness (lower limit of 95% 
CI), lesser effect size (upper limit of 95% CI for OR of awareness with monitoring vs standard clinical 
care) and greater probability of LPS (0.48). The majority of the ICERs remained at <£20,000 per QALY 
gained. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those undertaken for high-risk patients 
undergoing TIVA.
In the population of general surgical patients undergoing mixed GA, E-Entropy monitoring had higher 
costs than standard clinical monitoring. In contrast with the analysis for TIVA, the clinical trial used to 
estimate inhaled anaesthetic drug consumption reported a substantial decrease (29%), which resulted 
in approximately half of the additional cost of E-Entropy monitoring being offset by a reduction in

anaesthetic drug costs. Despite the lower baseline risk of awareness, which resulted in a lower QALY gain 
with E-Entropy monitoring than for high-risk patients, the lower incremental cost resulted in an equivalent 
ICER (£19,000). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the same input 
parameters as for the population at high risk of awareness. The least favourable ICERs were found with a 
low reduction in anaesthetic drug consumption (lower limit of 95% CI) and lesser effect size (upper limit of 
95% CI for OR of awareness with monitoring vs standard clinical care). The majority of the ICERs remained 
below £20,000 per QALY gained. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were also similar to those 
undertaken for high-risk patients.
Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring
We presented a base-case analysis for two modes of anaesthetic administration [TIVA and mixed 
anaesthesia (induction with i.v. anaesthesia and maintenance with inhaled anaesthesia or a combination 
of inhaled and i.v. anaesthetic)] and for two patient populations (those considered at high risk of 
intraoperative awareness and a general surgical population, at average risk of intraoperative awareness).
Anaesthetic drug costs were based on consumption reported in the included trials, and were valued 
using current unit costs. Insufficient evidence was identified to estimate the effectiveness of depth of 
anaesthesia monitoring with Narcotrend on the incidence of intraoperative awareness or on POCD. In 
the absence of evidence specific to Narcotrend, we have applied the effectiveness estimates derived for 
BIS, described above. This means that the modelled clinical effectiveness of Narcotrend is identical to that 
reported for BIS – this is an untested assumption and must be considered a weakness in the evidence base 
for Narcotrend.
In patients considered at high risk of awareness undergoing GA with TIVA, the modelled cost per patient 
with Narcotrend monitoring was higher than with standard clinical monitoring, although some of the 
additional cost was offset by reduced cost associated with psychological sequelae of awareness. The 
additional cost of Narcotrend monitoring was approximately half that of E-Entropy monitoring, and 
approximately one-quarter that of BIS – primarily because of differences in the cost of the sensors attached 
to the patient. In contrast with BIS and E-Entropy, the majority of the additional cost of Narcotrend 
monitoring was attributable to the monitor (90% of additional cost per patient) rather than the sensors. 
Narcotrend monitoring was associated with improved outcomes, based on applying clinical effectiveness 
evidence reported for BIS. The ICER for Narcotrend compared with standard clinical monitoring in this 
population was £5681. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER was sensitive to the 
baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness in reducing awareness, probability of LPS, QoL decrement 
for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of sensors. The least favourable 
ICER was for low baseline incidence of awareness. Scenario analyses, undertaken to consider variables 
omitted from the base case and to explore the impact of key baseline assumptions, indicated that the 
cost-effectiveness results were highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the baseline risk of awareness 
and the QoL decrement for PTSD, whereas they were largely insensitive to including an effect of E-Entropy 
on PONV.
In the general surgical population undergoing GA with TIVA Narcotrend monitoring had a lower cost per 
patient than standard clinical monitoring. The additional cost of monitoring was reduced to £2.84 per 
patient (£2.28 per patient for the monitor and £0.56 for the sensors attached to the patient). This was 
more than offset by reduction in anaesthetic drug consumption. Given the lower baseline risk of awareness 
in this population, the QALY gain was lower than for high-risk patients. However, given that Narcotrend 
was associated with improved outcomes and reduced costs it dominated standard clinical monitoring. 
Narcotrend remained dominant in all the deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions from the scenario 
analyses were similar to those undertaken for high-risk patients.
As noted above, in the absence of evidence specific to Narcotrend, we have applied the effectiveness 
estimates derived for BIS in this analysis. For patients undergoing mixed GA (induction with i.v. and 
maintenance including inhaled anaesthetic), the pooled OR of awareness with BIS monitoring compared

with standard clinical monitoring (0.45) is higher than for TIVA, resulting in a smaller reduction in cases of 
awareness, LPS and PTSD.
In patients considered at high risk of awareness undergoing mixed GA, Narcotrend monitoring had higher 
costs and improved outcomes compared with standard clinical monitoring, although the QALY gain 
(0.0005) was lower than for patients undergoing TIVA. The ICER for Narcotrend compared with standard 
clinical monitoring in this population was £8033. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICER 
was sensitive to the baseline incidence of awareness, effectiveness in reducing awareness, probability 
of LPS, QoL decrement for PTSD, the proportion of people with LPS who have PTSD and the cost of 
sensors. The least favourable ICERs were found with a low incidence of awareness (lower limit of 95% 
CI) and lesser effect size (upper limit of 95% CI for OR of awareness with monitoring vs standard clinical 
care). Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those undertaken for high-risk patients 
undergoing TIVA.
In the population of general surgical patients undergoing mixed GA, Narcotrend monitoring had higher 
costs than standard clinical monitoring. Although the proportionate reduction in consumption of inhaled 
anaesthetic (desflurane) was lower than the reduction in i.v. anaesthetic (propofol) for TIVA, the reduction 
in cost of anaesthetic (£4.26) was sufficient to offset the additional cost of Narcotrend monitoring 
(£2.84). Given the lower baseline risk of awareness in this population, the QALY gain was lower than for 
high-risk patients. However, as Narcotrend was associated with improved outcomes and reduced costs, it 
dominated standard clinical monitoring. Narcotrend remained dominant in the majority of deterministic 
sensitivity analyses. At the upper limit of the 95% CI for proportional change in desflurane use, the 
reduction in cost of anaesthetic was insufficient to offset the additional cost of Narcotrend monitoring and 
the resulting ICER was £2534. Conclusions from the scenario analyses were similar to those undertaken for 
high-risk patients.
Strengths and limitations of the assessment
The current evidence synthesis followed an accepted standard procedure for conducting a systematic 
review of the evidence, based on a published protocol, so as to minimise bias and, where possible, 
provide the most precise estimates of effects for relevant outcomes. The work was carried out by a team 
experienced in health technology appraisal, independent of any vested interest.
We know of only two other relevant systematic reviews in this topic area, both of which focused on the 
effects of BIS-guided depth of anaesthetic monitoring. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported by 
Liu (2004)105 investigated the use of BIS-guided anaesthetic delivery in ambulatory anaesthesia. Eleven RCTs 
were included and BIS-guided anaesthesia was found to significantly reduce anaesthetic consumption, 
PONV and time spent in the recovery room (PACU). However, the benefits did not reduce the time spent in 
the ambulatory surgery unit overall. More recently, a more comprehensive Cochrane systematic review and 
meta-analysis of the use of BIS monitoring to improve anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery, not 
limited to ambulatory anaesthesia, was conducted by Punjasawadwong and colleagues.34 As noted above, 
our current systematic review complements this Cochrane review for BIS studies and, where possible, we 
have updated meta-analyses in the Cochrane review using data from new RCTs that we have identified. 
For pragmatic reasons (to keep the work manageable with the available resources), we did not duplicate 
the searches of the Cochrane review or re-extract data for those RCTs already included in it, but instead 
systematically sought and appraised new RCTs about BIS-guided anaesthesia that have been published 
since the search dates of the Cochrane review. The Cochrane review was limited to RCTs on adults but, 
as specified in the protocol, we have included in our systematic review RCTs on children as well as adults. 
In practice, we found new evidence to update the Cochrane review meta-analysis for three outcomes 
(intraoperative awareness, consumption of volatile anaesthetic and consumption of i.v. anaesthetic), 
although for anaesthetic consumption the precision of the existing effect estimates was not necessarily 
improved because of significant statistical heterogeneity. A disadvantage of our pragmatic approach is

that we have not presented full details of those BIS trials included in the Cochrane review, although these 
can be ascertained from the Cochrane review itself. Although Cochrane reviews are generally conducted 
to high standards, there appear to be some limitations in the publication by Punjasawadwong and 
colleagues,34 which we have noted above when interpreting specific outcomes. For instance, a metaanalysis relating to ‘PACU stay’ appears to have combined several outcomes concerning the time to PACU 
arrival, stay and discharge, which would be more informative if analysed separately.
As no systematic reviews of E-Entropy-guided anaesthesia or Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia appear 
to have been published, for these technologies we conducted more extensive searches to locate all 
relevant RCTs, on both adults and children, which were then screened for relevance and, where they 
met the inclusion criteria, were subjected to full systematic review. The current work represents the most 
comprehensive systematic review of BIS-, E-Entropy- and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia that has been 
conducted to date.
A notable limitation to our assessment of patient outcomes is that the quality of reporting in the primary 
studies was often limited, which gives rise to numerous uncertainties in the interpretation of the primary 
evidence (see Uncertainties). As discussed above, the studies were diverse in their methodological 
characteristics, which limited opportunities to pool their data in meta-analyses. The primary studies also 
predominantly reported secondary outcomes, which were often based on relatively small sample sizes, 
with unknown statistical validity.
We undertook a comprehensive search for studies that would be potentially relevant to the assessment of 
cost-effectiveness, by identifying full economic evaluations of any depth of anaesthesia monitoring device 
compared with standard clinical monitoring. One published study was identified, which reported ICER as 
the incremental cost of BIS monitoring per case of intraoperative recall avoided. We did not identify any 
published economic evaluations that reported outcomes in terms of QALY or similar units, nor did we 
identify any studies that explicitly compared the additional costs of depth of anaesthesia monitoring with 
potential savings in anaesthetic drug use. We developed a de novo decision-analytic model to provide 
an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring, compared with standard 
clinical monitoring, incorporating patient outcomes (in terms of avoided cases of PTSD and POCD) as QALY 
and anaesthetic drug use. The model provided a means to synthesise data from the systematic review 
of patient outcomes (in terms of the effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring on intraoperative 
awareness, POCD and anaesthetic drug use). This was supplemented by information identified using 
targeted searches (on the baseline incidence of intraoperative awareness in high-risk and general surgical 
populations, proportion of patients who experience POCD, the proportion of patients experiencing 
intraoperative awareness who develop long-term psychological illness, the duration, cost and the QoL 
impact of those conditions).
In the model, GA exposes patients to a risk of intraoperative awareness that is defined either as high or 
average (the latter corresponding to the risk of awareness in the general surgical population), and to 
POCD, which have consequences for QoL. In patients experiencing long-term psychological illness as a 
consequence of an awareness episode, there are also associated health-care costs. Other costs considered 
in the model are costs of anaesthetic drugs, as well as the cost of the depth of anaesthesia monitors. 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed by estimating ICER for each mode of anaesthesia and each technology. We 
undertook a range of sensitivity analyses and scenario analysis to identify the key determinants of the costeffectiveness results as well as the impact of key assumptions and of variables missing from the analysis.
Evidence to populate the model was limited. In particular no evidence on the effectiveness of E-Entropy 
and Narcotrend on the incidence of intraoperative awareness was identified. In the case of BIS, where such 
evidence was identified it was limited to patients considered at high risk of awareness. We have assumed 
in the model that the effectiveness evidence in high-risk patients can be applied to the general surgical 
population (at average risk of awareness) and that the effectiveness evidence for BIS can be applied to 
both E-Entropy and Narcotrend. These are untested assumptions and must be considered a weakness in

the cost-effectiveness evidence base. Whereas more evidence is available on the baseline risk of awareness, 
there was considerable inconsistency in the estimated incidence in studies identified in our targeted 
searches. As a result we used pooled values (excluding outliers) in the base-case analyses, with the outlying 
values adopted in scenario analyses.
Evidence on the effectiveness of any depth of anaesthesia monitoring on POCD is also limited to BIS, 
with the only published study being available only in abstract form. As with the evidence on effectiveness 
with respect to awareness, we have assumed that evidence for BIS can also be applied to E-Entropy and 
Narcotrend – again this is an untested assumption. Evidence on the incidence of POCD was also limited 
and is subject to considerable uncertainty (primarily concerning the extent to which pre-existing, but 
unrecognised, cognitive dysfunction may be incorrectly identified as a postoperative complication). The 
best evidence we could identify that reported POCD in patients who had been assessed preoperatively 
compared with a matched group of non-surgical controls is over 10 years old, and it is not clear whether 
or not this will reflect incidence of POCD in current practice.
Although we were able to identify some evidence on the incidence of PTSD in patients who experienced 
awareness during GA, we did not identify any studies reporting overall QoL impact, health state utilities or 
mean duration of symptoms in PTSD sufferers with awareness as the trigger. The evidence base for people 
with PTSD relates to a range of trauma exposures (including military service and other wartime exposures, 
natural disaster, domestic abuse), and it is not clear whether or not this can be applied directly to people 
who have developed psychological illness following intraoperative awareness.
We adopted a modelling approach that did not explicitly identify patients exposed to overdose or 
underdose of anaesthetics, although this may allow a clearer assessment of the potential benefits of 
depth of anaesthesia monitoring. Intraoperative awareness may be identified as being particularly closely 
associated with anaesthetic underdose, whereas POCD and PONV may be more closely associated with 
overdose. The potential for savings in terms of anaesthetic drug use may also primarily arise in this latter 
group. Although it may have been preferable to adopt this more explicit structure, we did not identify data 
to support this approach. We have therefore adopted a more simple model structure, although we have 
implicitly incorporated some of these assumptions into our model.
The scope of the appraisal issued by NICE required the three depth of anaesthesia monitoring devices to 
be compared with standard clinical monitoring, rather than with each other. A direct comparison of the 
cost-effectiveness of the three technologies was therefore not conducted. However, such a comparison 
would not be feasible as there is limited direct trial evidence comparing the technologies with each other, 
and an indirect comparison would not be possible because of the lack of outcome data on intraoperative 
awareness for E-Entropy and Narcotrend. Indeed, because of the lack of awareness data, one of the 
assumptions we have had to make is that all three technologies would be similar in terms of preventing 
awareness, based on the data available for BIS.
Uncertainties
One of the biggest uncertainties in the evidence base assessed in this report is the impact of EEG 
monitoring on intraoperative awareness, and other significant adverse effects such as POCD. The lack of 
outcome data from RCTs on awareness was particularly the case for E-Entropy and Narcotrend. Likewise, 
the only RCT data available for POCD was for BIS and was available only in a conference abstract. In 
situations where evidence for specific outcomes from RCTs is lacking, it is pragmatic to use data from 
other types of study design, including non-experimental studies (e.g. cohort studies). However, we did 
not identify any such studies of BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend in our literature searches that reported on 
intraoperative awareness or POCD.

The nature of standard clinical monitoring varied across the included trials, with some trials giving more 
information than others. For example, in one study59 it is reported that ‘in the clinical group, the depth 
of anaesthesia was primarily evaluated by clinical indices including heart rate, blood pressure and body 
movement’ (our emphasis) so it is not known what other methods may have been used. Also patients in 
the EEG arm of some of the trials were potentially assessed on the basis of standard clinical monitoring 
with the EEG reading used as an adjunct to other physiological parameters in assessing the effects of 
anaesthetic agents; however, this was not always explicitly stated in the trials. The BAG-RECALL trial by 
Avidan and colleagues44 used ‘structured protocols’ to remind anaesthesiologists that patients may be 
aware, but not necessarily to prescribe changes in anaesthetic. As patients can have their anaesthesia 
adjusted on the basis of standard clinical monitoring or EEG monitoring or both, the effect is not solely 
as a result of the technology being considered (BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend) in the intervention arm of 
most of the studies.
Details of the technologies used in the trials are also often limited and confusing. It is not always clear 
or specified as to which monitor has been used or which version of the software has been used. There 
also seems to be some confusion between monitor version and software version in the reporting of the 
trials, and also between the terms ‘monitor’ and ‘module’. For example, the trials of Narcotrend report 
Narcotrend Monitor version 2.0 AF,60 Narcotrend monitor (software version 2.0 AF)63,64 and Narcotrend 
monitor (MonitorTechnik, Germany).59 This also happens in the studies reported in Cochrane review of 
BIS.34 Anaesthesia monitors assess a range of parameters such as EEG, ECG, respiration, temperature, 
anaesthetic gases, and can be used for viewing and processing information (e.g. Datex-Ohmeda S/5 
monitor); an EEG monitor with BIS, monitors the state of the brain by data acquisition of EEG and BIS 
is the processed EEG variable. However, device manufacturers also use the terms monitor and module 
interchangeably. This is probably because some monitors incorporate processing modules. For example, 
the A-2000 EEG monitor with BIS was upgraded to the A-3000 EEG monitor, which incorporated a BIS 
module and is known as a BIS monitor.
It therefore appears that the technologies considered are continually evolving, and different versions 
of the software have been used to interpret EEG readings in the different trials. It is not clear exactly 
what alterations have been made to the algorithms and how these influence the trial results as the 
algorithms are proprietary and not completely published. However, it is suggested by the manufacturer 
of BIS that update versions of the module have focused on artefact detection and removal, rather than 
fundamental changes to the algorithm. In the Narcotrend industry submission to NICE, one trial showed 
that Narcotrend does not differentiate reliably between conscious and unconscious patients. The reason 
given to explain these results is that both these studies were carried out using older versions of the 
algorithm and that the studies had methodological flaws. Whatever the reasons are for these results, this 
does emphasise the potential lack of consistency between the different versions and need for care when 
interpreting results from studies using different software versions.
There is also inconsistency in EEG values used in the trials, both overall and at different time points during 
surgery, making comparison across trials difficult. In the BIS trials there was notable variation in target 
values from 40 to 70. E-Entropy values during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 
60 for response entropy and 40–65 for state entropy, but in some trials higher values were permitted near 
the end of surgery, and the response entropy–state entropy difference was also used as a target value in 
some trials. Narcotrend values ranged from D0
 to C1, D2 to E0 adjusted to D0 to D1 and D2 to E0, which 
means that the level of anaesthesia varied across trials within the same technology.
Outcomes were also defined differently in the different studies, which may affect results. For example, 
the starting point for the recovery process can be the last stitch performed during surgery or the end of 
application of dressings.

Discussion
136
Other issues to consider when interpreting results are investigator bias (subtle unconscious or conscious 
influence of investigator on results which can overestimate results) and ‘learning contamination bias’ 
(the unintended improvement of standard clinical monitoring occurring with the introduction of a new 
monitoring device which can reduce the difference in results). Not many of the included studies discussed 
these aspects or reported experience of the anaesthetist. Ellerkmann and colleagues62 used experienced 
anaesthesiologists and suggest that results may have been different had they used less experienced staff. 
Kreuer and colleagues63 discount learning contamination bias in the standard clinical monitoring group of 
their trials as the anaesthesiologist was also experienced in use of Narcotrend/BIS.
Additional factors for consideration include inter-individual variability and sex differences in response to 
anaesthesia which complicate interpretation of results. For example in one trial, with comparable amounts 
of propofol, women in the standard clinical monitoring group had significantly shorter recovery times 
than men; in EEG-monitored groups (BIS and Narcotrend) propofol consumption was lower for men.63
Also effects differ between i.v. anaesthesia and volatile anaesthetics and also depend on the specific drug 
used. For example, more rapid recovery can be expected with desflurane/remifentanil (which is washed out 
quicker) compared with propofol, so comparisons across trials using different anaesthetic agents are not 
valid. In addition, as anaesthesia is the interaction between hypnosis and sedation, the relative proportion 
of the drugs used to achieve these elements of anaesthesia may have an impact on EEG monitoring. Also, 
different approaches were used in the trials to manage inadequate anaesthesia, such as narcotics (fentanyl, 
sufentanil, alfentanil), which could impact on results.
Taking into account the above issues such as the methodology of the trials, the lack of clarity of reporting, 
the differences in patient characteristics and differences in technologies and anaesthesia used, brings 
into question the overall generalisability of the results and makes interpretation of results problematic, 
especially as some of the observed differences are minimal and may not be judged as clinically significant.

Chapter 6 Conclusions
I
n general, BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend technologies for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia are 
associated with reductions in general anaesthetic consumption and decreased anaesthetic recovery 
times, compared with monitoring of clinical signs alone. However, these reductions may be considered 
clinically modest. The available evidence on the impact of the technologies on reducing the likelihood of 
intraoperative awareness is limited. Overall, BIS was associated with a statistically significant reduction 
in intraoperative awareness in patients classified as at higher risk, although there is uncertainty in effect 
estimates because of significant heterogeneity. Caution is advised because of uncertainties about the risk of 
bias of many of the included trials, and because many outcome measures were not statistically powered.
The cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to be highly dependent on the 
incidence of awareness, the HRQoL impact of psychological sequelae of awareness, the probability of 
developing psychological illness following awareness as well as the effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia 
monitoring in reducing awareness. Cost-savings, resulting from reduced use of anaesthetic drugs may 
offset some of the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. The cost of sensors attached to the 
patient appears to be a key factor in the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring.
Implications for service provision
The main implications for service provision will be the installation of the EEG module, any training 
required, and follow-up module maintenance. Module installation is unlikely to be particularly disruptive, 
although a separate compatible monitor may also be required, depending on which module is being 
introduced. As discussed earlier, training in use of the modules is not likely to be extensive.
Suggested research priorities
The following research recommendations are listed in order of perceived priority.
1. There is a lack of RCTs of E-Entropy-guided and Narcotrend-guided anaesthesia monitoring to detect 
explicit intraoperative awareness, specifically in high-risk patients. Given that incidence of awareness 
will be higher in this group, it may be more feasible to mount a trial than in the general surgical 
population, notwithstanding an adequate a priori statistical power calculation (although see below). 
Future trials should incorporate adequate length of follow-up to detect delayed cases of awareness. 
Cases of awareness may emerge after the first postoperative week, but in nearly all of the currently 
available RCTs of BIS, E-Entropy and Narcotrend, intraoperative awareness was assessed only within 
1–3 days post surgery. It should be noted that in the RCTs we reviewed, the timing of follow-up was 
not always clearly specified and/or it was not clear to which outcomes the specified follow-up periods 
applied. Clear reporting of these crucial aspects of the RCT should be strongly encouraged. Future RCTs 
should also evaluate the effects of anaesthesia overdosing, including short-term effects such as nausea 
and vomiting, as well as longer-term impact on cognitive function.
2. There were no trials of the use of Narcotrend in children, and only two paediatric studies of E-Entropy 
in our systematic review. Future evaluation of these technologies would be warranted in these groups.
3. Further evidence on the incidence of intraoperative awareness is needed. The Royal College of 
Anaesthetists ran the National Audit Project (NAP) 5 to estimate the incidence of awareness in all 
UK hospitals (1 June 2012 until 31 May 2013). This may provide useful data for future economic 
modelling of depth of anaesthesia technologies in the UK.
4. Our literature searches identified three ongoing RCTs that would meet the inclusion criteria of 
our systematic review (see Appendix 12), all of which are investigating anaesthesia depth titrated

according to BIS values. A further recent RCT (accepted for publication), which is similar to our 
inclusion criteria, is the Michigan Awareness Control Study, comparing BIS-guided and MAC-guided 
electronic alerts for the prevention of awareness under GA.140 The target sample size was 15,000 
patients in each group (aged >18 years) at both low and high risk for awareness, and a total of 
21,601 patients were enrolled at the time of interim analysis. The primary outcome measure was 
intraoperative awareness, with explicit recall measured at 28–30 days post anaesthesia. Modified ITT 
interim analysis found no statistically significant difference between BIS- and MAC-guided alerts in 
incidence of definite awareness, and the trial was therefore terminated because of futility. Post hoc 
power analysis showed that around 30,000 patients in each group would be required to detect a 
difference between the two interventions.141 This calls into question the feasibility of future RCTs of 
depth of anaesthesia monitoring, particularly in the general surgical population.

Appendix 1 Report methods for synthesis 
of evidence of clinical effectiveness and costeffectiveness as described in the research protocol
Report methods for assessing the outcomes arising from the 
use of the interventions
The systematic review of clinical effectiveness will adhere to standard methodology as outlined in the CRD 
guidance for undertaking reviews in health care.
Population
The relevant study population for this assessment is patients receiving GA for surgery, including adults and 
children in whom the technology is licensed. Elderly and obese patients undergoing GA will be included as 
sub-groups for this evaluation where data allow.
Studies of patients receiving sedation in settings such as intensive care or high-dependency units are not 
relevant to this assessment. Studies of anaesthesia monitoring in healthy volunteers, or in non-surgical 
anaesthesia will not be included. Studies in which only regional or local anaesthesia are given will not 
be included.
Interventions
z E-Entropy.
z BIS.
z Narcotrend.
Comparators
The comparator in this assessment is standard clinical observation, including one or more of the following 
clinical markers: end-tidal anaesthetic gas concentrations (for inhaled anaesthesia); pulse measurement; 
heart rhythm; blood pressure; lacrimation; and sweating.
Outcomes
Studies will be included if they report one or more of the following outcomes:
z probability of intraoperative awareness
z patient distress and other sequelae resulting from intraoperative awareness
z recovery status (e.g. Aldrete scoring system)
z time to emergence from anaesthesia
z time to extubation (if appropriate)
z time to discharge from the recovery room
z consumption of anaesthetic agents
z morbidity and mortality including postoperative cognitive dysfunction from anaesthetic agents, painrelieving drugs, antibiotics, antisickness drugs and muscle relaxants
z HRQoL.
Data on these indirect outcomes are likely to be used to estimate QALYs as final health outcomes.

Study design
We will prioritise RCTs for inclusion in the systematic review of clinical effectiveness. Where RCTs of 
technologies are not identified we will consider non-RCTs and controlled observational studies for 
inclusion, providing they include relevant outcomes.
Systematic reviews will be retrieved only to check their reference lists for potentially relevant studies. 
However, to ensure the workload is manageable within available time and resources we may include 
the aforementioned Cochrane systematic review of BIS which included 31 RCTs (Punjasawadwong and 
colleagues34). The Cochrane review had similar inclusion criteria to the current review and was last updated 
in May 2009. Rather than search for and review all studies of BIS, it is proposed that we summarise the 
findings of the Cochrane review and supplement it by reviewing any relevant studies published since 
May 2009.
Search strategy
A comprehensive search strategy will be devised, tested and applied to a number of electronic databases 
by an experienced Information Scientist (see Appendix 1 for the MEDLINE strategy). Electronic databases to 
be searched include: MEDLINE (Ovid); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid); EMBASE 
(Ovid); The Cochrane Library (CDSR; CENTRAL); DARE; HTA; NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED); 
and EconLit.
Databases will be searched from 1995 to the present day (for BIS the search will be from May 2009 to 
the present day, supplementing the Cochrane systematic review). In addition, contact will be made with 
experts in the field to identify any relevant studies. Reference lists of included studies will be checked for 
any potentially relevant studies. Research in progress will be identified from the following databases: 
Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; NIHR-Clinical Research Network Portfolio; WHO ICTRP 
(International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). 
Studies published in the last two years as abstracts or conference proceedings will be included only if 
sufficient details are presented to allow appraisal of the methodology and the assessment of results to 
be undertaken.
Only articles published in the English language will be included.
For the cost-effectiveness assessment, searches for other evidence to inform cost-effectiveness modelling 
will be conducted as required and may include a wider range of study types.
The titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy will be assessed for potential eligibility 
using the inclusion/exclusion criteria detailed above. Full papers of studies that appear potentially relevant 
will be requested for further assessment. These will be screened by one reviewer and checked by a second, 
and a final decision regarding inclusion will be agreed. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion, 
with involvement of a third reviewer where necessary.
Data extraction strategy
All included studies will undergo data extraction using a structured piloted template. Each study will be 
extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second for accuracy. Any disagreements between reviewers 
will be resolved by consensus or if necessary by arbitration by a third reviewer.
Quality assessment strategy
The methodological quality of all included studies will be appraised by one reviewer, and checked by a 
second. Any disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by consensus or if necessary by arbitration 
by a third reviewer.

RCTs will be appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias criteria. Any non-randomised and 
observational studies included will be appraised using criteria developed by Spitzer and colleagues (1990).
Methods of analysis/synthesis
Studies will be synthesised through a narrative review with tabulation of results of included studies. 
Quantitative synthesis of results will be contingent on the data available. Meta-analysis using Cochrane 
Review Manager (revman) software will be considered where appropriate (e.g. if there are several high 
quality studies of the same design) and sources of heterogeneity will be investigated.
Report methods for synthesising evidence of cost-effectiveness
Review of published cost-effectiveness studies
The methods detailed above will be used to systematically review the cost-effectiveness literature. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to that of the systematic review of clinical effectiveness, with the 
exception of study design and outcomes. Studies will be included if they are full economic evaluations, 
assessing both costs and consequences, of the specified technologies (e.g. reporting cost per patient, 
cost per episode of intraoperative awareness or cost per QALY). The quality of the included economic 
evaluations will be assessed using a critical appraisal checklist based upon that proposed by Drummond 
and colleagues (2005) and Philips and colleagues (2006). The data from these studies will be tabulated 
and discussed in a narrative review.
Where presented, HRQoL data will be extracted from studies included in both the systematic review of 
clinical effectiveness and the systematic review of cost-effectiveness. In addition, a targeted literature 
search will be conducted specifically for publications reporting HRQoL or health state utility for adults with 
episodes of intraoperative awareness. Where available, QoL data will be used in our economic model.
Evaluation of costs and cost-effectiveness
A comparison of the costs and consequences of depth of anaesthesia monitoring will be made using 
decision-analytic models. The structure of the models will be informed by the systematic review of costeffectiveness and other systematic searches of the literature and, where necessary, using guidelines and 
expert opinion. The model will be constructed according to standard modelling guidelines (Phillips and 
colleagues (2006) and a full explanation of our methods for formulating model structure and deriving 
parameter values will be given in the assessment report. The perspective will be that of the NHS and 
Personal Social Services (PSS). The outcome will be reported as cost per patient, cost per intraoperative 
awareness avoided and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, where possible.
The decision tree model will include the costs of the anaesthesia-monitoring device (including the module, 
the sensors, and, if applicable, the monitors), and any savings associated with reduced use of anaesthesia, 
fewer side effects and improved recovery time from the anaesthesia. We will aim to assess the HRQoL 
impact of episodes of intraoperative awareness. If good HRQoL data are available the model will include 
health benefits in terms of QALYs. In the case where insufficient published HRQoL data are available it will 
be necessary to elicit HRQoL values from clinical experts or to conduct threshold analyses using a range of 
estimates. The time horizon will be a patient’s lifetime (or shorter if appropriate) in order to reflect longterm health gains. Both costs and benefits will be discounted at 3.5%.
Parameter values will be obtained from the relevant research literature, including our own systematic 
review of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Sources for parameters will be stated clearly. Resource use will 
be specified and valued from the perspective of the NHS and PSS. Costs will be derived from primary 
data from previous studies, and national and local NHS unit costs. If insufficient data are retrieved from 
published sources, costs may be obtained from individual NHS Trusts or groups of Trusts.

Uncertainty will be explored through both one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken if both the data and 
modelling approach permit this. The outputs of any probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be presented using 
plots of the cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
The model will be validated by checking the model structure, calculations and data inputs for technical 
correctness. The structure will be reviewed by clinical experts for appropriateness for the clinical and 
diagnostic pathways. The robustness of the model to changes in input values will be tested using 
sensitivity analyses.

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Percentage of time passed (induction, maintenance, recovery and total) with bradycardia (<75% of baseline values), 
normal range of heart rate, tachycardia (>125% of baseline values), hypotension (<75% of baseline values), normal range 
of mean arterial blood pressure, and hypertension (>125% of baseline values) were similar among groups (data not 
extracted)
Results demonstrate that BIS and spectral entropy guidance for the titration of sevoflurane results in a reduction of 29% in 
sevoflurane consumption
Sevoflurane consumption was statistically significantly different between study arms only when normalised for patient 
weight and duration of anaesthesia
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: random using a randomisation list performed with computer-generated random numbers
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: analysis excluded those who became ineligible post randomisation
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: reported to be similar in demographics except that patients in the 
E-Entropy-guided group (group 2) were statistically significantly heavier (p=0.04). More males were included in the 
E-Entropy-guided group
Method of data analysis: chi-squared test for nominal data. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni’s test for multiple 
comparisons used for numerical data
Sample size/power analysis: previous open study from the authors’ institution in the same surgical population showed that 
sevoflurane consumption was 0.16±0.10 g/kg/hour. Applying an a priori power analysis, at least 34 patients had to be 
enrolled in each treatment group to detect a reduction of 50% in the sevoflurane consumption with a risk α of 0.05 and 
a statistical power of 0.9. The authors included 60 patients in the standard practice group and 40 in the BIS and spectral 
E-Entropy-guided groups
Attrition/dropout: six patients excluded from group 3 (one not extubated at the end of surgery due to hypothermia, three 
required intraoperative propofol administration, and missing data in two cases), six patients excluded from group 1 (three 
not extubated at the end of surgery because of hypothermia, two required intraoperative propofol administration, and 
monitor data were lost in one case), and three from group 2 (all were not extubated at the end of surgery because of 
hypothermia, two required intraoperative propofol administration)
General comments
Generalisability: general surgical population receiving an inhaled maintenance anaesthetic, not specifically identified as at 
increased risk for intraoperative awareness
Intercentre variability: NA
Conflict of interests: none declared. Some of the monitoring equipment used was provided by GE Healthcare

z Definite or possible 
awareness (pre-specified 
secondary outcome)
z Distressing experience 
of awareness (post hoc 
secondary outcome)
Length of follow-up: up to 
30 days post extubation
Methods of assessing 
outcomes: awareness assessed 
by modified Brice questionnaire 
(references cited). Assessments 
made 72 hours after surgery, 
and 30 days after extubation. 
Patients who reported 
memories of the period 
between ‘going to sleep’ and 
‘waking up’ were contacted by 
a different evaluator, who asked 
additional structured questions. 
Three experts independently 
reviewed responses to the 
questionnaire from patients 
who had reported memories 
and determined whether the 
reported event involved definite 
awareness, possible awareness 
or no awareness. Experts 
assigned each event of definite 
or possible awareness to one of 
the categories of the Michigan 
Awareness Classification 
Instrument. In the event of 
divergence of opinion a fourth 
expert reviewer who reviews 
cases for the Anaesthesia 
Awareness Registry of the ASA, 
made the final determination

Additional results/comments
In total, 49 patients, including patients from all three enrolment sites, reported having memories of the period between 
‘going to sleep’ and ‘waking up’ at the end of surgery
Experts determined that nine patients had definite intraoperative awareness (incidence 0.16%, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30), and 
27 patients had definite or possible awareness (incidence 0.47%, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68)
A classification of awareness events is given, according to the Michigan Awareness Classification (data not extracted)
Patients who experienced awareness compared with patients who did not, met a median of one additional inclusion 
criterion and had a median of one additional pre-existing medical condition
A total of five of the nine patients who experienced possible awareness did not have either BIS values of >60 or ETAC 
values of <0.7 age-adjusted MAC
Overall, during the maintenance of anaesthesia the BIS was <60, a median of 94.0% of the time (interquartile range, 
93.6–100), and the ETAC was >0.7 age-adjusted MAC, a median of 84.8% of the time (interquartile range, 67.2–95.3)
In both groups the median length of stay in the hospital was 7.0 days, and the median length of stay in the ICU was 
2.1 days
There were no important differences between the groups in the doses of sedative, hypnotic, opioid analgesic or 
neuromuscular-blocking drugs administered
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: 6100 pre-randomisation designations were generated electronically n blocks of 100, 
divided equally between the groups
Allocation concealment: labels indicating BIS group or ETAC group were sealed in opaque, numbered envelopes
Blinding: the anaesthesia practitioners were aware of the patients’ group assignments, but the patients, the postoperative 
interviewers, the expert reviewers and the statisticians were not
Analysis by ITT: a modified ITT analysis was performed, which included all patients who underwent randomisation and 
who were assessed for intraoperative awareness. All the patients were treated with the protocol to which they had been 
randomly assigned
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: Statistically significant differences were found for two variables: use of 
anticonvulsant drugs (slightly higher in group 1); cardiac ejection fraction <40% (slightly higher in group 2)
Method of data analysis: Fisher’s exact test for primary and secondary analysis. Chi-squared test, Fisher’s exact test, 
unpaired Mann–Whitney U-test or unpaired Student’s t-test used for other comparisons
Sample size/power analysis: it is estimated that with 6000 patients the study would have 87% power to detect a clinically 
significant reduction of 0.4 percentage points in the incidence of definite awareness with the BIS protocol, compared with 
the ETAC protocol (from 0.5% in the ETAC group to 0.1% in the BIS group), at a one-tailed alpha level of 0.05 with the use 
of Fisher’s exact test
Attrition/dropout: of the 3021 patients randomised to group 1, 114 (3.8%) were excluded post randomisation. Of the 
remaining 2907 patients, 46 (1.6%) were lost to follow-up and 2861 were assessed for intraoperative awareness. Of the 
3020 patients randomised to group 2, 118 (3.9%) were excluded. Of the remaining 2902, 50 (1.7%) were lost to followup and 2852 were assessed for intraoperative awareness. Reasons given for exclusions and loss to follow-up in both 
groups were similar (primarily death before awakening). 5713 (98.3%) completed at least one postoperative interview and 
were included in the primary outcome analysis. 5413 (93.2%) completed the postoperative interviews at both times (within 
72 hours after surgery and at 30 days after extubation)
General comments
Generalisability: surgical population classified at high risk of intraoperative awareness receiving inhaled anaesthesia. 
Not applicable to the general surgical population, and those receiving i.v. anaesthesia. BIS and ETAC were used as part 
of structured protocols. It was not the intention of the protocols to prescribe or restrict the use of anaesthetic agents. 
Practitioners could decrease anaesthetic administration at their discretion if a patient’s condition was haemodynamically 
unstable. The protocols were designed to increase vigilance and to provide warnings that patients might be aware
Intercentre variability: median BIS and ETAC values were similar between the three study sites
Conflict of interests: states that no potential conflict of interest was reported

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Mean propofol infusion rates at various time intervals during the course of surgery were similar in the two groups
The number of patients requiring additional opioids was similar in both groups (two patients in group 1 compared with 
three patients in group 2)
Mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure were not statistically different between the groups during the duration of 
surgery
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: computer-generated randomisation table
Allocation concealment: randomisation to the two groups was performed by opening a sealed envelope
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: all patients received their allocated intervention. Only one patient was excluded from the analysis (group 2) 
because the child received lower propofol infusion rate owing to wrong dose calculation. Note that table 1 which provides 
demographic data and study outcomes lists there being 25 patients in each group
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: authors state that the two study groups were comparable in terms of 
demographic variables (age, weight, sex)
Method of data analysis: age, weight, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and duration of anaesthesia, surgery and 
propofol infusion were compared between groups using Student’s t-test, whereas the BIS values were compared between 
groups using Mann–Whitney U-test
Sample size/power analysis: calculated that 22 patients required in each study group to detect a 20% difference in 
propofol consumption [average requirement of propofol 150µg/kg/minute (SD 30) with an alpha error of 0.05 and power 
of 90%]. To compensate for any exclusion 25 patients were studied in each group
Attrition/dropout: as above, one patient was excluded from the analysis from group 2
General comments
Generalisability: authors state that they used the three-sensor device for BIS monitoring and that it does not use the new 
XP technology. The newer version became available later in the study but was not used as the algorithm in the newer 
device may be different and may affect results. Results of this study may therefore not be applicable to newer versions of 
BIS monitors
Intercentre variability: NA
Conflict of interests: reported as ‘Nil’
Other: the authors note that the Steward score for anaesthetic recovery has never been formally validated for the paediatric 
patient population, although is widely accepted as a tool in paediatric anaesthesia research

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Only an abstract is available, hence, the information reported is limited
Reported ETAC and target plasma propofol concentration outcomes which would correspond, respectively, to inhaled and 
i.v. anaesthesia; unclear how the patients received these different types of anaesthesia, as no subgroups were specified
Methodological comments:
Allocation to treatment groups: random assignment. No further details given
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: not discernible as the number randomised and the analysis methods were not reported
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: stated patient characteristics and surgical details similar between groups, 
but no data provided for any variables
Method of data analysis: NR
Sample size/power analysis: NR
Attrition/dropout: NR. The starting number of patients (921) is 20 more than the total sample size indicated for outcomes 
data (449+452=901); unclear whether or not this difference reflects attrition pre or post randomisation
General comments
Generalisability: elderly Chinese patients (>60 years) undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under GA, but limited 
information on the types of anaesthesia (appears to include both inhaled and i.v.); unclear population characteristics (sex, 
weight, comorbidities not reported); unclear surgical procedures (no information reported); and unclear which groups 
some outcomes were reported for. Not reported whether or not population was at high risk of intraoperative awareness

using the S/5 Collect software 
program (GE Healthcare) 
on a computer hard drive 
for off-line analysis. The 
average end-tidal sevoflurane 
concentration, entropy 
values and haemodynamic 
parameters during anaesthetic 
maintenance were calculated 
using data collected from 
the application of the gag 
retractor to the end of surgery
Patients were interviewed 
about intraoperative recall 
in the PACU and on the first 
postoperative day by an 
independent nurse
Time to the various recovery 
parameters was measured 
following discontinuation 
of sevoflurane. Complete 
recovery was defined as 
a score of 9 or more on a 
modified Aldrete score

vs group 3 p=0.045
Aldrete scores similar 1 minute after extubation
Various E-Entropy and BIS values reported for all three groups; differences between groups not significant
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: randomised by drawing lots from a closed box
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: no
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: no differences between groups in age, weight and height by analysis of 
variance; not reported for sex and ASA status
Method of data analysis: normally distributed data compared with between-group analysis of variance and Tukey’s HSD 
(honestly significant difference) post hoc test if global analysis of variance result was significant; a covariance analysis of 
variance was performed for ‘recovery time’ and the covariate ‘duration of anaesthesia’. Data not normally distributed 
compared using Kruskal-Wallis analysis
Sample size/power analysis: calculated that at least 25 patients had to be investigated in each group to detect a reduction 
of 20% in propofol consumption with a standard deviation of 20% in propofol consumption in each group with a type I 
error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.86
Attrition/dropout: patients excluded from analysis because of insufficient regional anaesthesia or EEG data loss were group 
1=5, group 2=3, group 3=3
General comments
Generalisability: to separate hypnotic and analgesic components of anaesthesia, all patients received regional anaesthesia 
catheters for intra- and postoperative pain control prior to investigation (i.e. pain perception completely blocked), which 
could limit generalisability. Also more than one type of surgery was included and more than one regional anaesthesia 
technique that might contribute to different levels of analgesia. Authors state that similar results may not have been 
obtained with less experienced anaesthetists. Results applicable to adult patients receiving i.v. GA (and regional 
anaesthesia) assumed not to have significant morbidities

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Patients in group 2 had significantly more hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia and somatic responses 
(purposeful movements) compared with those in group 1 (47 vs 27 total events, respectively; p<0.01). However, the 
incidence of purposeful movement alone (15 vs 18 total events respectively) did not differ significantly (p≥0.05) between 
group 2 and group 1
In addition to the emergence data above, cumulative probability of non-emergence was reported in a Kaplan–Meier 
survival analysis graph (data not extracted)
Median [interquartile] (range) patient satisfaction score 24 hours post surgery: group 1: 93 [80–100] (50–100); group 2: 
90 [80–100] (50–100); difference not statistically significant (p≥0.05)
Three patients in group 2 and one patient in group 1 had EEG-derived variables that were considered out of range after 
skin incision (no further explanation provided)
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: randomisation to group 1 or group 2 was done by opening a sealed envelope. Sequence 
generation method and nature of the envelope contents not reported
Allocation concealment: sealed envelope used, not stated whether or not opaque
Blinding: Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale, PONV, pain, and recall questions were completed by 
patient interview by an anaesthesiologist who was blinded to the treatment groups. Postoperative care was supervised by a 
recovery room nurse blinded to treatment groups. However, stated that entropy and standard practice guidance could not 
be performed in a blinded fashion
Analysis by ITT: stated that all patients were included into the final analysis
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: patients in group 1 had mean age 5 years older than group 2; group 1 had 
a slightly higher ratio of ASA class 1 to class 2 (i.e. slightly less severe illness rating) than group 2. Height (not extracted) 
and weight were similar in the two groups. Ethnicity not reported. Stated that there were no significant differences in 
patients’ characteristics (p-values not reported)
Method of data analysis: t-tests for normally distributed data; Mann–Whitney U-tests for non-normally distributed data; 
repeated measures analysis of variance ‘as appropriate’ (no further details given). Distribution of emergence times by study 
group compared using Kaplan–Meier log-rank survival analysis (calculating the cumulative probability of patients remaining 
unconscious after discontinuation of the anaesthetic drugs)
Sample size/power analysis: sample size of 34 based on a previous study by Kreuer et al.,
63 assuming a difference in 
emergence (eye-opening) of 3 minutes, an error of 0.05 and 90% power. Study was powered for time to eye-opening; 
stated that there were too few subjects to show a significant effect on intraoperative awareness, given the low incidence 
rate
Attrition/dropout: NR
General comments
Generalisability: women-only study, mid-30s age group, with ASA score <3. Population does not appear to be at high risk 
of intraoperative awareness
Intercentre variability: NA; appears to be a single centre
Conflict of interests: none explicitly reported, but the M-Entropy module and electrodes were provided by the module 
manufacturer
NA, not applicable; NR, not reported.

was played to patients through 
headphones (rationale of the 
word selection and language 
characteristics reported). Word 
presentation typically started 
15 minutes after induction 
and lasted approximately 
42 minutes. The memory test 
involved playing predetermined 
combinations of words 
that had been used during

words, to patients though 
headphones. Patients were 
instructed to listen to each 
test sequence and select the 
word played during surgery,

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
End-tidal desflurane concentration reported to be significantly smaller with BIS and Narcotrend compared with standard 
practice (graph only)
Mean arterial blood pressure at various times points during anaesthesia similar between groups
Vasopressor was necessary in 19 BIS patients, in 19 Narcotrend patients and in 17 standard practice patients
Five patients in each group needed 0.5mg atropine for treatment of bradycardia
Mean BIS values in the Narcotrend group were higher than those in the BIS group and standard care group (but not 
statistically significantly so at all time points)
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: randomised by drawing lots from a closed box
Allocation concealment: no details reported
Blinding: for standard practice group attending anaesthesiologist blinded to EEG readings; in EEG groups either only BIS 
or only Narcotrend monitor uncovered. Recovery times recorded by blinded investigator. No details reported for desflurane 
consumption or interview for intraoperative recall
Analysis by ITT: yes
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: groups reported to be similar at baseline (no statistically significant 
differences reported)
Method of data analysis: chi-squared test or one-way analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple 
comparisons as appropriate; all tests two-tailed with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Recovery time to opening 
of eyes also compared using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
Sample size/power analysis: 35 patients had to be enrolled in each treatment group to provide 80% power to detect a 
difference of 1.5 minutes at an a=0.05
Attrition/dropout: none

Additional results/comments
Mean arterial blood pressure at various times points during anaesthesia similar between groups
Vasopressor was necessary in significantly more patients (n=27) with standard practice than in Narcotrend (n=14) or in 
the BIS group (n=17) (p<0.05). The mean drug amount was also significantly higher in the standard practice group
Five patients in each group needed 0.5mg atropine for treatment of bradycardia
Recovery times were significantly shorter in women than men in the standard practice group with comparable amounts of 
propofol
Propofol consumption was significantly lower for men than women in the BIS group
BIS values comparable for patients in Narcotrend and BIS groups; significantly lower BIS values were observed in standard 
practice group vs BIS or Narcotrend group at various time points of anaesthesia
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: randomised by drawing lots from closed box
Allocation concealment: no details reported
Blinding: for standard practice group attending anaesthesiologist blinded to EEG readings; in EEG groups either only BIS or 
only Narcotrend monitor uncovered. Recovery times and propofol consumption recorded by a blinded investigator

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Stated there were no differences in heart rate or blood pressure between the two groups preoperation, at anaesthesia 
induction, at the beginning of surgery, at the end of surgery, or at anaesthesia emergence (p>0.05) (data reported in 
charts, not extracted by reviewer)

Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: not explicitly stated, but it appears that there were no withdrawals and that the outcomes data were 
reported for all randomised patients
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: sex was not reported. Stated there was no significant difference between 
the two groups in terms of age, body weight, hypertension (p>0.05)

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Baseline data were reported for the number (%) of patients in each group who underwent the following types of surgery: 
herniorrhaphy; circumcision; herniorrhaphy and circumcision; orchiopexy; hydrocelectomy; varicocele ligation (p-values for 
three-group comparisons of these variables all >0.7; data not extracted). Baseline data were also reported for the BMI-forage percentile (three-group comparison, p=0.52) and Induction Compliance Checklist score (three-group comparison, 
p=0.96) (data not extracted)
Mean arterial pressure did not differ significantly between the groups at baseline (p≥0.05), but was significantly higher in 
group 1 than group 2 during and at the end of surgery (p<0.01) (reported in a graph; data not extracted)
Mean heart rate and mean respiratory rate did not differ significantly between the groups at any time point (p≥0.05) (data 
not reported)
Mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (%) was reported in a graph for six time points from start of induction to end 
of surgery and was significantly higher (p<0.01) in group 1 than group 2 at four times: at the start of surgery; 5 minutes 
after incision; 10 minutes after incision; and at the end of surgery (data not extracted)
The number (%) of patients who moved during surgery was 11 (21) in group 1 and 10 (19) in group 2 (p=0.94 for threegroup comparison)
The number (%) of patients whose parents gave a satisfaction score of very good, good, acceptable or bad was reported 
and did not differ significantly between the groups (p=1.00 for each rating class; there were no bad experiences reported) 
(data not extracted)
Stated there were no adverse respiratory events in any of the groups
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: patients were allocated randomly to three groups after induction of anaesthesia, using a 
computer-generated randomisation table
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: two anaesthesiologists were involved in the study, a third investigator assessed the patient during the emergence 
and recovery period, and a nurse of the Anaesthesia Department assessed intraoperative recall at a follow-up interview. 
Stated that both anaesthesiologists were blinded to the anaesthetic technique and all three investigators were blinded 
to the grouping of the patient. However, the methods used to achieve blinding were not reported, and it was not stated 
whether or not the nurse who assessed intraoperative recall was blinded to the patient group
Analysis by ITT: not reported, but there appears to have been no attrition; all randomised patients would appear to have 
been analysed
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: groups appear comparable for age, weight, ASA health status, types of 
surgery being undertaken and haemodynamic parameters; no statistically significant differences were reported at baseline
Method of data analysis: group comparisons of continuous variables were made by one-way analysis of variance for 
normally distributed variables or by Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test for non-normally distributed variables. Where differences 
were significant, post hoc comparisons between groups were by Bonferroni correction (normally distributed variables) or 
by Mann–Whitney U-test (non-normally distributed variables). Categorical data were analysed by chi-squared or Fisher’s 
exact test as appropriate
Sample size/power analysis: stated that an a priori power analysis was based on a previous study (Bannister et al.45) which 
suggested that a sample size of 44 patients for each group should be adequate to achieve a 30% or greater reduction in 
the time to first movement response with a power of 0.9 (a=0.05)
Attrition/dropout: none reported, but sample sizes for postoperative outcomes suggest there were no dropouts
General comments
Generalisability: pre-pubertal predominantly male, probably Chinese, paediatric outpatient population with ASA health 
status <3, who received GA with sevoflurane. Not identified as being at high risk of intraoperative awareness
Intercentre variability: NA (appears to be one centre)
Conflict of interests: NR
NA, not applicable; NR, not reported.

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Baseline data for patients’ height, type of operation (peripheral/abdominal/thorax), and Apfel score (risk of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting) were reported; p-values for inter-group differences were all >0.05
Four patients in group 1 (17%) and five patients in group 2 (25%) required surgery because of ‘malignoma’, but none 
received preoperative radiation or chemotherapy
Changes in the anaesthetic regimen (titration of dose up or down) were reported for propofol and remifentanil (data not 
extracted); differences between the study groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05)
Average temperature during anaesthesia was reported and was identical in both study groups
Stated that all patients except one were extubated earlier in group 1
Other drugs used during anaesthesia:
Theoadrenaline plus cafedrine (Akrinor) (doses reported), n (%): group 1, 14 (58%); group 2, 12 (60%)
Atropine 0.5mg during induction, n (%): group 1, 2 (8); group 2, 0 (0)
Dopamine 1–5mg/kg/minute to maintain mean arterial pressure >80mmHg (peripheral vascular surgery patients)
only), n (%): group 1, 4 (17); group 2, 2 (10)
Nitroglycerin spray (antihypertensive), n (%): group 1, 1 (4); group 2, 0 (0)
Urapidil 20mg (antihypertensive), n (%): group 1, 1 (4); group 2, 0 (0)
Clonidine 75–150µg during extubation, n (%): group 1, 2 (8); group 2, 2 (10)
Variances of diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly larger in group 2 (p≤0.034 for both 
parameters combined), but the combined difference was not significant when age-corrected data were analysed
Comorbidities requiring perioperative medication:
Arterial hypertension, n (%): group 1, 6 (25); group 2, 4 (20)
Cardiac arrhythmia, n (%): group 1, 3 (13); group 2, 2 (10)

Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: stated random allocation but no details provided
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: NR
Analysis by ITT: unclear. Analysis does not include all the patients who started but it is unclear whether or not attrition 
happened pre or post randomisation
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: groups were similar for the reported variables of sex, height, weight, ASA 
physical status, type of operation and risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (Apfel score). However, patients were 
slightly younger in group 1 (p=0.041) (data given above) and no information on ethnicity was provided
Method of data analysis: normality of distribution was tested for all variables using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Intergroup 
comparisons for propofol concentrations and visual analogue scores were tested by repeated-measures analysis of variance 
or non-parametric statistics. Intergroup comparisons for time of anaesthesia, doses of anaesthetics and times to extubation 
were tested by Mann–Whitney U-test. Effects of patients’ characteristics were tested by analysis of variance and a posteriori 
Scheffé test. EEG parameters were adjusted for patient characteristics
Sample size/power analysis: To achieve a power of at least 80%, standard deviations of the mean difference in time to 
extubation reported by Kreuer et al.63 were utilised for comparisons between BIS, NCT and standard clinical practice. Given 
a=5%, and d=1.0, the required sample size was estimated using a power table to be 13 subjects per group
Attrition/dropout: stated that out of 48 patients, the data for 44 patients were included in the final analyses. Reasons for 
four withdrawals were reported, but it was not stated the withdrawals occurred pre or post randomisation nor how they 
were distributed among the two study groups

Generalisability: appears to be a German adult population, predominantly of ASA grade II, but some grade I and III, with 
cardiovascular comorbidities, undergoing various elective surgical procedures, and receiving propofol and remifentanil GA. 
Ethnicity not reported. No explicit risk factors for intraoperative awareness identifiable
Intercentre variability: NA (appears to be a single-centre study)
Conflict of interests: none reported

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Surgical procedures (n, group 1/group 2) were: herniotomy (9/3), urethroplasty (6/8), orchidopexy (6/7), urethural fistula 
closure/cystoscopy (4/6), not reported (0/1)
Mean state entropy and response entropy values were higher in group 1 than group 2 throughout the procedure; 
however, the difference was statistically significant only at the moment the child awoke (pre awakening) (p=0.03) and at 
1 minute post awakening (p=0.01)
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: allocation to groups was according to computer-generated random numbers in a sealed 
envelope (not stated whether or not opaque)
Allocation concealment: an anaesthesiologist not involved in the anaesthetic management of the patient opened the 
envelope and either obscured or kept the entropy values visible on the monitor (not stated how data were obscured)
Blinding: stated only that the anaesthesiologist in group 2 was blinded to state and response entropy values (method of 
blinding not stated). Times to awakening and recovery were assessed by a resident anaesthesiologist who was blinded to 
the treatment allocation (i.e. unaware to which study group a patient belonged)
Analysis by ITT: stated that the data were analysed by intention to treat (data from all 50 randomised patients were 
analysed)
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: age and weight were not statistically significantly different in the two 
groups. Group 2 included two girls, otherwise all participants were boys. Ethnicity was not reported. The surgical 
procedures performed, and the duration of surgery and anaesthesia were comparable between the two groups
Method of data analysis: Baseline data compared between study groups using chi-squared test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
as appropriate. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal isoflurane concentration, state entropy and response entropy 
were compared between groups over time using a generalised estimating equation as the observations were correlated
Sample size/power analysis: stated that a pilot study on 15 patients in a ‘conventional’ group gave a recovery time 
(assumed by reviewers to refer to time to awakening) of 7±4 minutes. Anticipating a 5-minute difference in recovery time 
between the study groups, with an error of 0.05 and 90% power, a sample size of 15 in each group was calculated
Attrition/dropout: none reported (all patients included in analysis)
General comments
Generalisability: predominantly (88–100%) male; children of mean age 4–5 years (range 2–12 years); of presumably Indian 
ethnicity (not stated); with ASA health status grade I-II; undergoing lower abdominal or urological day care surgery with 
induction under i.v. propofol or inhaled sevoflurane, followed by maintenance under inhaled isoflurane. No specific risk 
factors for intraoperative awareness identified
Intercentre variability: NA (one centre)
Conflict of interests: stated none
NA, not applicable.
a Mean estimated from graph by reviewer (95% CI was reported but has not been extracted by the reviewer as it was 
not stated to which group(s) or difference the CI applies).
b As reported: CI does not include the stated mean difference (interpretation unclear).

parameters (Entropy 
module of S/5 Anaesthesia 
Monitor with S/5 Collect 
software [GE Healthcare

Target device/index value: 
State entropy between 
45 and 65 until last 
15 minutes of anaesthesia 
then ideally 65 (not 
exceeding 70) during last 
15 minutes. Response–
state entropy difference 
(response entropy–state 
entropy) <10. Heart rate 
and blood pressure to 
be kept within ±20% 
of baseline (preoperative 
visit) values
Commencement of 
monitoring: in operating 
room while patient was 
awake, before induction 
of anaesthesia
Group 2: control: 
haemodynamic 
parameters only (heart 
rate and blood pressure to 
be kept within ±20% of 
baseline values; entropy 
values recorded on a 
laptop computer but not 
displayed)
Length of experience/
training of anaesthetist: 
anaesthetists were 
allowed to accustom 
themselves to the use of 
entropy monitoring for 
3 weeks. All participants 
in the current study had 
substantial previous 
experience with 
electroencephalogrambased depth of 
anaesthesia monitors
Total numbers involved: 335 
randomised (number randomised per 
group not reported). Numbers after 
attrition: group 1, 160; group 2, 160
Premedication used: oral diazepam 
0.1–0.5mg/kg 60 minutes before 
induction, except at Norwegian study 
site (where no premedication was 
used)
General anaesthetic used:
Induction: alfentanil bolus ≤30µg/kg 
and propofol bolus 1.0–2.5mg/kg
Maintenance: continuous infusions 
of alfentanil ≤30µg/kg/hour and 
propofol ≤9mg/kg/hour. Lungs were 
normoventilated with a mixture of 
O2
 (35–50%) and N2O (50–65%). In 
group 1, propofol was titrated to 
maintain the target state entropy; 
alfentanil or propofol boluses were 
permitted if state entropy suddenly 
increased; and alfentanil infusion 
was adjusted if the response 
entropy–state entropy difference 
>10 or if haemodynamic parameters 
exceeded ±20% of baseline values. 
In group 2, propofol and alfentanil 
were given to maintain heart rate 
and blood pressure within ±20% 
of baseline values; propofol and 
alfentanil infusions were also adjusted 
depending on signs of unnecessarily 
deep or inadequate anaesthesia
Recovery: infusions were closed down 
and N2
O was discontinued after skin 
closure
Regional anaesthesia used: NR 
(implied that patients who underwent 
shoulder operations may have 
received inter-scalene plexus blocks 
post operatively)
Muscle relaxants used: according 
to the anaesthetist’s choice, when 
considered appropriate
Antinausea drugs used: none reported
Type of surgery: different types 
of gynaecological, abdominal, 
urological, orthopaedic, breast, 
thyroid and inguinal hernia operations

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Stated that the aim in all patients was to provide smooth, haemodynamically stable anaesthesia with the shortest possible 
emergence time and without intraoperative awareness
The initial eight to nine patients at each study site (total 50 patients) were assigned to a historical control group and their
data were used to establish standard clinical practice of the participating anaesthetists before entropy monitoring started. 
The purpose of the historical control group was to get all of the study sites adjusted to the research protocol rather than to 
compare practices with and without central nervous system monitoring
Stated there were only minor differences between group 2 and the historical control group, with no differences statistically 
significant except higher values in the historical control group for: blood pressure at 1 minute after intubation (p=0.037); 
propofol consumption during the last 15 minutes (p=0.001); and alfentanil consumption during the last 15 minutes 
(p=0.02)
Both group 1 and group 2 had more women than men because many of the participating centres included mainly 
gynaecological surgery patients in this study (patient numbers not reported by surgery type)
Stated that the incidence of untoward intraoperative reactions (movement or increased muscle tension, tearing, coughing, 
frowning, eye-opening, and episodes of hypertension, tachycardia or bradycardia) did not differ between study groups (no 
quantitative data reported)
Stated haemodynamic data were similar between groups; heart rates and blood pressures did not differ between groups 
until skin closure, where the entropy group had higher heart rate (mean±SD: 63±11 vs 60±10beats/minute; p=0.029) 
and blood pressure (83±10 vs 79±12mmHg; p=0.008) (no other haemodynamic data reported)
Stated that recovery in the PACU was similar between groups. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the 
nurse’s estimation of time needed in the PACU, the nurse’s estimation of the patient’s need for care, the nurse’s estimation 
of the patient’s general recovery, and the patient’s satisfaction with the anaesthesia, and the actual time spent in the PACU 
were similar between the two study groups (no quantitative data reported)
Cumulative percentages of patients not responding to verbal command, not yet discharged from the PACU, and not 
oriented to time and place after anaesthesia as a function of time were presented graphically (data not extracted by 
reviewer). Each of these outcomes was significantly smaller in group 1 than in group 2 (p<0.001)
Stated that similar haemodynamic profiles in group 1 and group 2 are to be expected because haemodynamic responses 
guided the alfentanil dose in the study protocol in both groups, not only in group 2
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: random assignment according to computer-generated random numbers
Allocation concealment: each study site was provided with a sufficient number of closed randomisation envelopes (not 
stated whether or not opaque). With sequential coding, the subjects were treated in blocks of 10 (five patients per group). 
The envelopes were opened in the operating room immediately before the induction of anaesthesia
Blinding: not reported, other than entropy values recorded for patients in group 2 were not displayed
Analysis by ITT: no; 15 patients excluded after randomisation were omitted from the analysis
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: ethnicity was not reported but age, sex, weight, and ASA health status 
did not differ significantly between group 1 and group 2. Height (data not extracted) also did not differ significantly 
between groups. (Note that baseline data were reported only for patients included in the analysis, not the full randomised 
population)
Method of data analysis: data normality was tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and visual estimation of histograms. 
Unpaired t-test was used to test differences in haemodynamic variables, age, weight, height and the duration of 
anaesthesia. Mann–Whitney U-test was used to test differences in all other variables. Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed 
to test differences in cumulative recovery as a function of time after anaesthesia
Sample size/power analysis: sample size estimate was based a priori on time to awakening after propofol anaesthesia 
in another study (which specifically focused on clonidine premedication effects on awakening time) (reference cited). 
A minimum of 147 patients in each group was calculated to detect a 20% difference in patients’ responses to a verbal 
command with a power of 0.8 and an a of 0.05
Attrition/dropout: 385 patients were initially recruited, of which 50 were used as historical controls to determine preexisting anaesthesia practice. Stated that 17/385 patients were excluded, of which two were from the historical control 
group. The remaining 335 patients were randomised. The final analysis was on 320 patients (160 per group), with 15 
patients excluded after randomisation. Reasons for exclusion were reported [most exclusions (14/17) were a result of ‘lack 
of registered data’] but the origin of the excluded patients (historical control group, group 1 or group 2 was not reported)

General comments
Generalisability: adult population (mean age mid-40s), 72–76% female, assumed Scandinavian, with ASA health status 
predominantly I/II, undergoing varied types of surgery under inhaled GA with alfentanil and propofol. Population noted 
not to be at particular risk of intraoperative awareness
Intercentre variability: not reported. Stated that there may have been differences in the recovery protocols between study 
sites but the study protocol did not override the hospital policy for discharge from PACU to ward
Conflict of interests: study supported by the device manufacturer (formerly Datex-Ohmeda, then GE Healthcare, Finland); 
authors included a research engineer, research scientist and chief scientist of GE Healthcare and two medical advisors to GE 
Healthcare. One author was an employee of VTT Information Technology, Finland
a Reported that for propofol the significant difference (p<0.001) applied both during the whole operation and 
especially during the last 15 minutes, but not stated to which of these time periods the numeric data refer.

Blinding: study described as single blind but no details
Analysis by ITT: no (not all randomised patients analysed)
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: stated no statistically significant differences in age, sex, ASA physical status, 
height, and weight
Method of data analysis: for nominal data, statistical analysis performed using chi-squared test. Age, sex, weight, height, 
duration of anaesthesia, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, consumption of sevoflurane statistically compared using 
independent sample t-test. RE and SE values were compared using Mann–Whitney U-test. Incidence of treatment of 
intraoperative adverse events (hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia) compared using Wilcoxon’s ranked-sum test. A 
p-value <0.05 was considered significant
Sample size/power analysis: NR
Attrition/dropout: three patients from group 2 not included in results because of missing data (reasons not stated)
General comments
Generalisability: opioids only briefly given during induction phase but not sustained during the operative period. This 
approach might result in a higher incidence of increased blood pressure in both groups compared with other studies. The 
ranges of RE and SE were set arbitrarily and different results in consumption of sevoflurane, intraoperative haemodynamics 
and need for antihypertensive drugs could result with other entropy values. Results applicable to Chinese elderly adults, 
ASA status I/II undergoing total knee replacement surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia with the stated entropy values. No 
specific risk factors for intraoperative awareness identified

Additional results/comments (e.g. early response factors, QoL)
Anaesthesia history differed significantly between study groups at baseline (p=0.017). The proportion with anaesthesia 
history was 18.1% in group 1 and 15.5% in group 2
BIS values were obtained for only six of the total 19 confirmed awareness cases (attributed to poor data collecting and 
recording). Of these, five cases showed light anaesthesia (BIS >60), with most (four) of these light anaesthesia cases 
occurring in group 2. BIS data from one patient with intraoperative awareness in group 1 indicated that BIS exceeded the 
target value (BIS>60 for 21 minutes, with a maximum BIS value of 75), giving light anaesthesia
Anaesthetic consumption was not specified as an outcome but the authors mention that intraoperative records showed 
that in some patients with awareness insufficient anaesthetic had been applied
Methodological comments
Allocation to treatment groups: carried out at each individual centre through computer-generated random numbers. 
Details not specified
Allocation concealment: NR
Blinding: anaesthetist was blinded to BIS values in group 2 (monitor screen was covered); stated that interviewers and 
patients were blinded to the group allocation (details not specified)
Analysis by ITT: not an ITT analysis: number randomised unclear and analyses excluded attrition
Comparability of treatment groups at baseline: the groups differed statistically significantly in terms of patients’ ASA status 
(a higher proportion with worse grades in group 1); anaesthesia history (a higher proportion in group 1 had previous 
anaesthesia); and the type of surgery received (details above). These variables were tested in univariate analyses (details 
not specified) to exclude a confounding effect on intraoperative awareness (p>0.05). The groups were otherwise well 
balanced for age, weight, sex, type of airway (tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask), proportion with a difficult airway and 
proportion with stable/unstable circulation status
Method of data analysis: independent-samples t-tests for intergroup comparisons and also chi-squared tests (no other 
details given)
Sample size/power analysis: stated (without citing a source) that the required sample size in each group was from 2000 to 
2800 to achieve 90% power at 5% two-sided type I error. To allow for missing data, 5000–6000 patients were recruited
Attrition/dropout: number randomised not reported. Stated that outcome data were collected from 5309 patients but 
only 5228 (i.e. 81 fewer) were analysed. Reasons for attrition were lack of information on group allocation (n=54; not 
reported separately by group; stated that this attrition was without awareness cases); age <18 years (n=11 in group 
1; n=10 in group 2); failure to participate in either of the postoperative interviews (n=2 in group 1; n=2 in group 2); 
postoperative death (n=1; group not specified); and surgery cancelled after anaesthesia induction (n=1; group not 
specified)
General comments
Generalisability: Chinese adult population receiving TIVA for a wide range of surgical procedures in 13 centres; no specific 
risk factors for intraoperative awareness identified
Intercentre variability: NR
Conflict of interests: device manufacturer (Aspect Medical Systems) provided BIS electrodes
NR, not reported.
a Reported percentage differs slightly from actual value (<1%).
b The reported percentages imply that the data are based on fewer patients than were allocated to the study groups 
(approximately 2650–2654 patients in group 1 and approximately 2224–2241 patients in group 2) (back-calculated 
numbers are approximate because of rounding errors).

Cost per awareness episode avoided
Provide a summary of the clinical outcome/benefits estimated for each intervention/strategy assessed in 
the evaluation.
See above section on intervention costs
Provide a summary of the costs estimated for each intervention/strategy assessed in the evaluation.
Cost of monitor estimated by assuming 7 years use, monitor will be used on four patients per day, 
300 days per year, i.e. US$1.07 per patient
Thus cost of BIS monitoring is US$18.07 per patient
Synthesis of costs and benefits – are the costs and outcomes reported together (e.g. as cost-effectiveness 
ratios)? If so, provide a summary of the results.
The associated cost of preventing each episode of awareness is US$11,294 for all patients. The 
associated cost of preventing each episode of awareness is US$4410 for high-risk patients.
Give results of any statistical analysis of the results of the evaluation.
None
Was any sensitivity analysis performed – if yes, what type(s) (i.e. deterministic (one-way, two-way, etc. 
or probabilistic).
No
What scenarios were tested in the sensitivity analysis? How do these relate to structural uncertainty (testing 
assumptions over model structure such as relationships between health states), methodological uncertainty 
(such as choices of discount rate or inclusion of indirect costs) or parameter uncertainty (assumptions over 
values of parameters in the model, such as costs, QoL or disease progression rates)?
None
Give a summary of the results of the sensitivity analysis – did they differ substantially from the base-case 
analysis. If so, what were the suggested causes?

Appendix 8 Pooled intravenous anaesthetic 
consumption for Narcotrend randomised controlled 
trials
T
he mean normalised consumption for propofol and for remifentanil reported in two trials (one in 
patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery63 and one in all kinds of elective surgery60) using 
Narcotrend depth of anaesthesia monitoring were pooled. Table 121 reports the normalised propofol 
consumption (mg/kg/hour) and mean difference in each of the included trials. Pooled estimates for the 
mean difference are reported in Table 122 (Figure 10 presents a forest plot for the analysis).
Table 123 reports the normalised remifentanil consumption (μg/kg/hour) and mean difference in each of 
the included trials. Pooled estimates for the mean difference are reported in Table 124 (Figure 11 presents 
a forest plot for the analysis).

Appendix 9 Derivation of the pooled estimates of 
cumulative incidence of awareness used in the model
T able 39 in Model parameters of this report presents the cumulative incidence of awareness in studies identified by our targeted searches, for general surgical populations and for patients deemed as being 
at high risk of awareness. The proportion of patients identified as experiencing awareness in each study 
were pooled by first transforming the proportions to the Freeman–Tukey variant of the arcsine square root 
transformed proportion, which is suitable for calculating fixed or random-effect summaries. The pooled 
proportion is calculated as the back-transform of the weighted mean of the transformed proportions, 
using inverse arcsine variance weights for the fixed-effect model and DerSimonian–Laird weights for the 
random-effects model.
Figure 12 shows the forest plot for all identified studies in general surgical populations. A pooled estimate 
from all these studies gives a cumulative incidence of awareness of 0.21% (95% CI 0.06% to 0.45%) 
assuming random effects [Cochran’s Q=212.55 (df=5), p<0.0001, I
2=97.6% for fixed-effect model].
Excluding the two outlying studies (Pollard and colleagues14 and Errando and colleagues18) yields a slightly 
lower estimate of 0.16% [95% CI 0.10% to 0.23%] assuming random effects [Cochran’s Q=7.85 (df=3), 
p=0.0493, I
2=61.8% for fixed-effect model] (Figure 13).
Figure 14 shows the forest plot for studies in high-risk surgical populations. A pooled estimate from all 
these studies gives a cumulative incidence of awareness of 0.45% (95% CI 0.06% to 1.19%) assuming 
random effects [Cochran’s Q=19.97 (df=4), p=0.0005, I
2=80.0% for fixed-effect model].

Appendix 10 Survival modelling methodology
T
he survival model adopted for this report, to derive the mean duration of PTSD from published survival 
curves, was developed using linear regression to estimate the parameters of a linear transformation of 
the observed Kaplan–Meier estimates for duration of PTSD symptoms in identified studies. A parametric 
survival function (Weibull) was estimated and assessed for goodness of fit to the observed data by 
visual inspection.
For a Weibull distribution the survival function is given by
S(t) = exp −λt
γ
( ) (3)
with scale parameter l and shape g. Taking the log of both sides gives
log(S(t)) = −λt
γ (4)
Taking the log of both sides again, gives
log(−log(S(t))) = log(λ) +γ log(t) (5)
which is a linear function and can be fit using least squares methods to provide estimates of log(l) and g.
General method for extracting data from published curves
Figures presenting Kaplan–Meier estimates for duration of PTSD symptoms in identified studies were 
scanned from the original publications and imported into Enguage software (http://digitizer.sourceforge.
net). The process of extracting data from a chart usually begins with the user identifying key reference 
points on the chart (e.g. indicating the location of the origin and points along the x- and y-axes). 
Enguage software will indicate what appear to be data points in the imported image or the user can 
select individual data points to be extracted using the mouse. Points along the curve were selected at 
approximately 3-month intervals and the raw data (without any interpolation) were extracted to a text file 
and imported in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).
The following table reports the parameter estimates for linear regression for the Weibull survival function.
log(l) g
Weibull –2.82786 0.61006
The mean duration of symptoms can be estimated using the following equation:150
(1/l)
(1/g)
×Γ[1+(1/g)] (6)
where Γ is the mathematical gamma function. Therefore, mean duration of PTSD symptoms is estimated 
as (1/exp(–2.82786)(1/0.61006) x Γ[1+(1/0.61006)]=151.80 months, or 12.7 years.
