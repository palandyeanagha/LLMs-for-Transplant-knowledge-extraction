Imaging and Pathological Features 
of Idiopathic Portal Hypertension 
and Diferential Diagnosis from 
Liver Cirrhosis
Zhen-LongZhao1, YingWei1, Tai-LingWang2, Li-Li Peng1, Yan Li1 & Ming-AnYu1*
Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) mimics liver cirrhosis in many aspects, and no efcient imaging 
method to diferentiate the two diseases has been reported to date. In this study, the imaging and 
pathological characteristics were analysed for both IPH and cirrhosis. From January 2015 to March 
2019, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and 
pathological results from 16 IPH and 16 liver cirrhosis patients, as well as imaging results of 16 normal 
patients as a control group, were retrospectively reviewed. The age of the patients was 39±20 years. 
There was a signifcant diference in the mean lumen diameter, wall thickness and ratio of thickness to 
diameter between the IPH and liver cirrhosis patients in the main and sagittal portal veins (P<0.05), 
as well as in the lumen diameter and ratio of thickness to diameter between the IPH and liver cirrhosis 
patients in the Segment 3 (S3) portal vein (P<0.05). In IPH patients, the main imaging changes 
were portal vein wall thickening, stenosis or occlusion, a low enhancement area along the portal 
vein in the delay phase in contrast-enhanced imaging, and a non-homogeneous change in T1WI. The 
corresponding pathological changes included interlobular vein thickening, stenosis, occlusion, portal 
area fbrosis, and atrophy or apoptosis of hepatocytes. The main imaging characteristic of liver cirrhosis 
was a nodular change in T1WI, and the related pathological change was pseudolobule formation. The 
imaging characteristics of IPH include thickening of the portal vein vascular wall, stenosis of the portal 
vein lumen and the absence of difuse cirrhosis-like nodules. These imaging features have a defnite 
pathological basis and could help make diferential diagnoses between IPH and cirrhosis.
Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a relatively rare disorder characterized by portal hypertension without 
cirrhosis. Te cause of IPH is complicated. Te most common cause is certain kinds of drugs, such as thiopurine1–3
 and arsenical salts4,5, and other causes include a series of autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis6,7
, noninfectious hepatitis7,8 and rheumatoid arthritis9. Similar to cirrhosis, IPH can also lead to hepatic 
failure, splenomegaly, variceal bleeding and ascites10, making it difcult to diferentiate IPH from cirrhosis. Liver 
biopsy has been the only way to diagnose IPH until now. A recent study showed that only a few special imaging 
examinations could possibly diferentiate IPH from cirrhosis. Te spleen/liver stifness ratio measured by acoustic 
radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography can diferentiate between IPH and cirrhosis11. Delayed periportal 
enhancement on the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be a characteristic of IPH12. Te heterogeneous 
increase in arterial perfusion in the periphery of the liver on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) 
imaging may be an important feature of idiopathic portal hypertension. Te accumulation of Tc-99m galactosyl 
human serum albumin (GSA) was decreased in the periphery of the liver in single photon emission CT (SPECT) 
images, which may be one of the signs of IPH13. However, ARFI elastography lacks a unifed parameter standard, 
and the other methods are associated with radiation and require a contrast agent. Because the treatment of IPH 
is completely diferent from that of cirrhosis, it is important to diferentiate IPH from cirrhosis. Based on the 
respective characteristics of IPH and liver cirrhosis in regard to pathological changes, the imaging features may 
be diferent. In the present study, the imaging characteristics, including those of magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), CT and ultrasound, of IPH verifed by pathology were retrospectively analysed and further compared

with IPH pathology. Te diferential diagnosis between IPH and cirrhosis based on pathology and imaging was 
summarized.
Results
Te baseline characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1. Te average age of IPH patients was 39±20 
years, and 8 male patients and 8 female patients were included. Tree patients underwent splenectomy. Te 
underlying causes of IPH included autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis vulgaris (1 patient), the use of the 
Chinese herbal medicines Sedum aizoon (1 patient) and Stellera chamaejasme (1 patient), the use of oxaliplatin 
(2 patients), and eating snacks with food additives such as spicy strips (1 patient). No possible IPH-related causes 
were investigated in the other patients. Fifeen patients had splenomegaly. Te average spleen pachydiameter was 
5.4 cm ±1.2 cm, and the length was 15.1 cm ±3.2 cm. Two patients had high aspartate aminotransferase levels 
(41U/L and 41.8U/L). Tree patients had low platelet counts (46×109
/L, 58×109/L and 92×109/L); MR examinations were performed in twelve patients, CT was performed in thirteen patients, and ultrasound was performed 
in all sixteen patients.
Te clinical diagnoses of the 16 liver cirrhosis patients recruited as the cirrhosis group included alcoholic 
cirrhosis (4 patients), viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis (6 patients), primary biliary cirrhosis (4 patients) and 
congenital hepatic fbrosis (2 patients). Tree patients underwent splenectomy. Te Child-Pugh classifcation 
of the patients was class A for 14 patients and class B for 2 patients. Te average spleen pachydiameter was 
5.2 cm±1.3 cm, and the length was 15.2 cm±3.3 cm. Tere were no signifcant diferences in spleen pachydiameter or length between the IPH group and the cirrhosis group. Te detailed imaging evaluation of the liver and 
spleen is shown in Table 2.
The imaging changes in the liver parenchyma. Difuse nodular changes on T1WI were shown in 63% 
(10/16) of the patients in the cirrhosis group but were not displayed in patients in either the healthy control group 
or the IPH group (Fig. 1). However, a non-homogeneous change was shown in the T1WI image in the IPH group, 
which was diferent from the homogeneous change in the healthy control group. No signifcant diferences were 
found in T2WI or difusion weighted imaging (DWI) images among the three groups.
Imaging changes in the portal area. Te parameters of the main, sagittal and Segment 3 (S3) branches of 
the portal vein were compared among IPH patients, cirrhosis patients and healthy people. Te lumen diameters 
of the main, sagittal and S3 branches of the portal vein in the IPH group and the healthy group were smaller than 
those in the cirrhosis group (P<0.05). Te vessel walls of the main and sagittal portal veins in the IPH group

were thicker than those in the cirrhosis group (Figs. 2 and 3) and the healthy group (P<0.05). Te ratio of wall 
thickness to lumen diameter of the main and sagittal portal veins in the IPH group was greater than that in the 
cirrhosis group and the healthy group (P<0.05). Te detailed results are shown in Table 3.
A low enhancement area along the portal vein in the delay phase is shown in contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) 
(Figs. 2e and 3e) and contrast-enhanced CT images (Fig. 2c) of IPH patients. Tis sign was not observed in the 
ceMRI (Figs. 2f and 3f) and CT (Fig. 2d) images of cirrhosis patients.
Pathological changes in IPH and cirrhosis. Obvious fbrosis in the portal area was found in all pathological results of IPH patients (Fig. 4a), but this sign was absent in cirrhosis patients (Fig. 4b). An apparent increase 
in the amount of collagen fbres, particularly around blood vessels in the portal area, was shown in the livers 
of IPH patients (Fig. 5a), and the increase in collagen fbres was mostly distributed in the portal area (Fig. 5c). 
However, the collagen fbres were mostly distributed in the septa around the liver pseudolobules (Fig. 5b,d) 
beyond the portal area in cirrhosis patients. Interlobular vein occlusion was reported in 9 out of 16 IPH patients 
(Fig. 4c), dilation was reported in 10 patients, and wall thickening was reported in 6 patients. In contrast, most 
of the interlobular vein in cirrhosis patients showed no wall thickening or occlusion (Fig. 4d). In IPH cases, the 
liver cells showed atrophy or apoptosis (Fig. 4e) around the Glisson’s sheath, but necrosis was not found. In contrast, necrosis (75%), oedema and fatty degeneration (93.8%) of liver cells were observed in most of the cirrhosis 
patients (Fig. 4f). Te results of pathological characteristics are shown in Table 4.
Diferences between IPH and liver cirrhosis based on imaging and pathology. In IPH patients, 
the main imaging changes were portal vein wall thickening, stenosis or occlusion, a low enhancement area along 
the portal vein in the delay phase in contrast-enhanced imaging, and a non-homogeneous change in T1WI imaging. Te pathological changes included portal vein wall thickening, stenosis, occlusion, portal area fbrosis, and 
atrophy or apoptosis of hepatocytes.
Te main imaging characteristic of liver cirrhosis was difuse nodular change in T1WI MR imaging, and the 
related pathological change was pseudolobule formation. No imaging or pathological changes were shown in the 
portal vein in liver cirrhosis patients except for lumen dilation in some cases.
Te specifc fndings related to portal hypertension in the IPH group included portal vein wall thickening 
and a low enhancement area along the portal vein in the delay phase ceMRI and contrast-enhanced CT. Other 
fndings, such as portal vein lumen changes, splenomegaly and portal-systemic collaterals, were non-specifc and 
could not diferentiate IPH from liver cirrhosis.
Discussion
Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) mimics liver cirrhosis in many aspects. Te imaging examinations showed 
hepatic atrophy, splenomegaly and ascites in both diseases. Te common clinical manifestations included abnormal liver-function tests, hypersplenism and varicosis14. Some patients presented anaemia and thrombocytopenia 
due to hypersplenism. To date, there are no efective imaging methods to diferentiate between the two diseases. 
Terefore, IPH is easily misdiagnosed as liver cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is considered necessary to clarify the cause 
of portal hypertension10. However, liver biopsy is seldom performed on patients with liver cirrhosis and IPH 
because the patients ofen have hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia, and it is dangerous to perform the biopsy 
due to the high risk of haemorrhage. Te treatment of these two diseases is diferent, and efective treatment 
requires a correct diagnosis. Terefore, it is important to fnd an efcient imaging method to diferentiate between 
the two diseases. According to the results in the present study, there are obvious diferences in both the parenchyma and portal area on imaging between IPH and liver cirrhosis. Te difuse nodular change in T1WI is a 
typical characteristic of liver cirrhosis. However, the imaging changes associated with IPH were mainly observed 
in the portal area. Te imaging changes in IPH patients included wall thickening and an increased ratio of thickness to diameter in diferent sections of the portal vein, which were diferent from the imaging changes observed

in cirrhosis patients and healthy people. Te pathological results showed that portal vein wall thickening and 
obvious fbrosis in the portal area were common in IPH patients. In ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT and MR 
images, the thickened vascular wall was rough and lowly enhanced, which is in accordance with the pathological 
changes. However, the vascular wall ofen remains smooth and is ofen too thin to be identifed in CT and MR 
images in liver cirrhosis patients and healthy people.
Recent studies have shown that IPH is associated with many autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis15, systemic lupus erythaematosus16 and rheumatoid arthritis9
. Tese results, combined with our own, indicate 
that IPH may be secondary to infammation of connective tissue and vasculitis. Te change in the portal area 
could be clearly demonstrated by pathological and imaging results in the present study. In addition, the low 
enhancement rough border around the portal vein in the delay phase in ceMRI and contrast-enhanced CT may 
be relevant to chronic infammation and fbrosis of the portal area. As secondary changes, atrophy and apoptosis 
of liver cells induced by ischaemia were characteristic of IPH patients and ere displayed as heterogeneous changes 
in T1WI. Portal hypertension in IPH patients may result from fbrosis of the portal area and vessel wall thickening. Portal vein thrombosis was not found in our study by liver biopsy but has been reported in some studies17,18. 
Te specifc changes in IPH patients may not include portal vein thrombosis, and portal vein thrombosis may not 
be a specifc sign of IPH. Te changes in the portal vein vessel wall and its surrounding area caused by diferent 
factors may be the initiating factor and a specifc characteristic of IPH.
Te pathological basis of cirrhosis is the death of hepatocytes, extracellular matrix deposition, and vascular 
reorganization, in which hepatocytes and perisinusoidal stellate cells play the most important roles. Te main 
pathological characteristic of liver cirrhosis is pseudolobule formation, which includes fbrous septa in the form 
of delicate bands or broad scars around lobules and parenchymal nodules encircled by fbrous bands. Te above 
pathological changes could be in accordance with the nodular changes observed in T1WI images. However, there 
were no obvious changes in the portal area, as demonstrated by the pathological and imaging results in the present study. Portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis results from increased resistance to portal fow at the level 
of the sinusoids and compression of central veins by perivenular fbrosis and expanded parenchymal nodules. 
Terefore, pseudolobule formation and nodular changes in T1WI are the main features of cirrhosis.
IPH has been a disease of undetermined aetiology until now. However, the main pathological and imaging 
changes concentrated on Glisson’s sheath in this study, so the main cause of IPH may be the damage of Glisson’s 
sheath and the portal venous system. Terefore, it is important that the interstitial part of the liver be focused on 
in both pathological examinations and imaging examinations.
In our experience, both ultrasound and MR can be used as good imaging methods to diferentiate cirrhosis 
from IPH. Ultrasound has high spatial resolution and is convenient to observe the vascular wall and measure the

diameter of the lumen. MR has high sof tissue resolution, and the thickened vascular wall can be observed clearly 
with a routine scan and contrast-enhanced T1WI. In addition, the non-homogeneous change and the absence of 
difuse hepatic cirrhosis nodules in IPH patients can be clearly observed in the T1WI sequence.
Our research has certain limitations. Te retrospective design creates a risk for selection bias. Te absence 
of a validation control weakens the results of the study. Te healthy people did not have pathological results for 
comparison. Te number of cases was small, and more data on portal vein measurements are needed.
The imaging characteristics of idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) include the absence of diffuse 
cirrhosis-like nodules, thickening of the portal vein vascular wall and stenosis of the portal vein lumen. Tese

imaging features have a defnite pathological basis and could help make diferential diagnoses between IPH and 
cirrhosis. Te interstitial changes in the liver should be concentrated on by radiologists.
Methods
Our retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital (China-Japan Friendship 
Hospital Institutional Review Board), and informed consent was waived by the institutional review board 
(China-Japan Friendship Hospital Institutional Review Board). Te patients consented to the publishing of their 
anonymous examination results and radiological images. All methods were performed in accordance with the 
relevant guidelines and regulations.
Patients. From January 2015 to March 2019, the ultrasound, CT and MR images as well as pathological 
results from 16 IPH patients were retrospectively reviewed. Idiopathic portal hypertension in the present study 
was characterized by portal hypertension; the absence of cirrhosis, as documented histologically in an appropriate 
liver specimen; and the absence of obstruction of the extrahepatic portal vein or hepatic venous outfow tract, 
sarcoidosis, schistosomiasis, congenital hepatic fbrosis, and other causes of cirrhosis. All patients had at least one 
clinical sign of portal hypertension (splenomegaly or hypersplenism, non-malignant ascites, minimally increased 
hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal-systemic collaterals). Te patients did not have chronic liver diseases 
causing cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, and they did not have congenital liver fbrosis, sarcoidosis 
or schistosomiasis, which cause non-cirrhotic portal hypertension19. Te patients had patent portal and hepatic 
veins in Doppler ultrasound or CT scanning. Te patients were diagnosed with IPH by pathological examination 
at China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Sixteen sex-matched liver cirrhosis patients with similar spleen pachydiameters (±0.5 cm) were recruited as the cirrhosis group for diferential diagnosis. Sixteen age- and sex-matched 
healthy people were recruited as a healthy control group for imaging characteristics and liver parameters.
Procedure of imaging and pathological examination. All IPH patients underwent contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound and MRI and/or CT. Te ultrasound examination was performed in our department. Te lumen 
diameter and wall thickness of the main, sagittal and S3 portions of the portal vein were measured in ultrasound 
images. Because the vessel wall is difcult to distinguish from the sof tissue around the vessel in liver, the wall

thickness was measured as the thickest part of sof tissue around the vessel. S3 was chosen because it is horizontal relative to the ultrasound beam and is clearer than the vertical vessels. Te pachydiameter and length of 
the spleen were measured with ultrasound. Tree doctors experienced in ultrasound diagnosis performed the 
measurements, and the average of three measurements was used as the result. Te doctors did not know the histological diagnosis of the patients during the measurement. Te MR examinations were performed with a 1.5T 
or 3T scanner, and the sequence included T1WI (T1 weighted imaging), T2WI (T2 weighted imaging), fsT2WI 
(fat-saturated T2WI), DWI (difusion weighted imaging) and contrast-enhanced T1WI (including artery phase, 
portal vein phase and delay phase). Te contrast-enhanced CT included a routine scan, artery phase, portal 
vein phase and delay phase. Te slice thickness of the CT and MRI was 3–5mm. Tree experienced radiologists 
reviewed the CT and MRI images and performed the measurements. Liver biopsy was performed in all IPH and 
liver cirrhosis patients. Te histology of liver specimens was studied using H&E, Reticulin+Masson, D-PAS and 
cytokeratin 7 immunohistochemical staining. Te “portal area fbrosis “ is reported if over 50% of the number of

Te imaging characteristics, including liver parenchyma and portal area, of IPH patients were frst evaluated
