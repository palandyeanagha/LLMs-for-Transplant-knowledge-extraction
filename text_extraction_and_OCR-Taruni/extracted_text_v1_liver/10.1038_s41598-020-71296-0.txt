The Japanese diagnostic guidelines for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) were proposed in 2014. This study 
aimed to determine the trends and characteristics of AIH based on a Japanese nationwide survey. Data 
for 796 patients who were newly diagnosed with AIH from 2014 to 2017 were collected from January 
to March, 2019 from 54 hospitals throughout Japan. Clinical characteristics, including treatment, 
were compared with those reported in a prior 2015 survey. The population had a median age of 
63 years at diagnosis, and the male to female ratio was 1:5.3. The numbers of women was signifcantly 
lower in this survey than in the 2015 survey. Moreover, the incidence of AIH with histological acute 
hepatitis increased signifcantly from 11.0 to 21.7%. The changes in the laboratory fndings, such as in 
transaminase and immunoglobulin G levels and antinuclear antibody titers, as well as in prednisolone 
treatment, refected an increasing incidence of acute AIH. The clinical characteristics of AIH changed 
rapidly, in parallel with the increasing incidence of acute AIH. The elucidation and diagnosis of AIH 
with acute hepatitis are important in the management of AIH.
Although autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with an acute presentation is difcult to diagnose based on a scoring 
system because of low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, its clinical and 
histological characteristics have been gradually elucidated by several reports1–18. AIH with an acute presentation 
includes two types: (1) the acute exacerbation phase, in which patients present with the clinical features of acute 
hepatitis, with histological evidence of chronic hepatitis; and (2) the acute hepatitis phase, in which patients 
present with histological features of acute hepatitis11.
Regular nationwide surveys of AIH have been conducted since 1975 in Japan1,2,19–21. Te 2015 survey reported 
the trends in 1682 patients who were diagnosed with AIH from 2009 to 20132
. Te proportion of AIH cases with 
acute hepatitis (11.7%) in 2015 was similar to that in 2009 (10.9%); notably, 1,056 patients were diagnosed with 
AIH from 2006 to 20081

Te accumulation of fndings of AIH with an acute presentation1–18 and its novel diagnostic guidelines22 may 
have afected the actual characteristics of AIH in Japan afer the previous 2015 survey. Te aim of this study 
was to elucidate the recent trends in AIH in Japan by comparing the results of the 2015 survey to a 2018 survey.
Results
Characteristics of patients with AIH. Te survey population had a median age at diagnosis of 63 years, 
and the male-to-female ratio was 1:5.3. Compared with the 2015 survey, the 2018 survey had a signifcantly 
lower proportion of women (Table 1). Te distribution of age at diagnosis had a single peak in the 60 s in both 
surveys.
Of the 760 patients, 147 (19.3%) had a history of alcohol intake and 56 (38.1%) drank<20 g of ethanol per 
day. Of the 780 patients, 115 (14.7%) had a history of medications associated with the development of AIH; the 
major kinds of drugs were calcium channel blockers (13/115, 11.3%), angiotensin II receptor blockers (12/115, 
10.4%), and herbal medicines (10/115, 8.7%). Only 6 of 687 patients with AIH (0.9%) had a family history of 
AIH. No patients developed AIH with biological and checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
Laboratory fndings. Te levels of aminotransferases and total bilirubin were signifcantly higher in the 
2018 survey than in the 2015 survey (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, compared with the patients in the 2015 survey, 
those in the 2018 survey had: signifcantly increased proportions of cases with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels>1,000 U/L and total bilirubin>10 mg/dL; signifcantly lower IgG levels, but a signifcantly higher proportion of cases with IgG concentration of 1–1.5 g/dL; and, of 674 cases, a signifcantly decreased proportion had 
serum ANA positivity (86.2% vs. 93.8%, p<0.001) and an ANA titer of 1:80, but a signifcantly increased proportion had an ANA titer≤1:40. Most patients positive for liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody were also 
positive for ANA or anti-smooth muscle antibody. Only one patient (0.5%) in the 2018 survey and two patients 
(0.5%) in the 2015 survey were positive for LKM antibody alone; they were classifed as having type 2 AIH. On 
the other hand, 692 patients (88.5%) in the 2018 survey and 1,357 (97.1%) in the 2015 survey were classifed as 
having type 1 AIH. No patients had other autoantibodies, such as antibodies against soluble liver antigen/liver 
pancreas or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.
Liver histological fndings. Of the 723 patients whose data on histological assessment of the liver were 
available, 70.0% were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis and 21.7% were diagnosed with acute hepatitis; the latter 
was signifcantly more frequent in the 2018 survey than in the 2015 survey (21.7% vs. 11.0%, p<0.001) (Table 1). 
Te frequency of acute hepatitis was also signifcantly increased, from 13.8% in 2015 to 23.7% in 2018, in the 28 
facilities that completed both surveys (Supplemental Table 2). With regard to basic histological characteristics of 
the cases in the 2018 survey, compared with those in the 2015 survey, interface hepatitis and plasma cell infltration were signifcantly more pronounced; the number of cases that had no fbrosis was higher, despite the similar 
frequency of centrilobular necrosis; emperipolesis was signifcantly increased; and hepatocyte rosette formation 
was decreased.
Diagnosis and severity of AIH. Most patients were diagnosed within 6 months from estimated onset in 
both surveys (2018: 79.0%, 2015: 77.2%; p=0.361). In the 2018 survey, 80.4% had typical cases, based on the 
Japanese guidelines; whereas defnite cases were seen in 48.8%, based on the revised score, and 45.7%, based on 
the simplifed score (Table 2). Te severity of AIH was mild in 38.5%, moderate in 43.6%, and severe in 17.9%. Of 
the items evaluating severity, clinical laboratory tests had relatively high frequencies of abnormalities, whereas 
clinical signs had low frequencies of abnormalities.
Comorbidity. Other autoimmune diseases were present in 194 of 787 patients (24.7%) with AIH, and this 
frequency was similar to that in the 2015 survey (24.9%) (Table 3). In the 194 AIH patients with other autoimmune diseases, the most frequent was chronic thyroiditis (8.3%), followed by Sjögren’s syndrome (6.6%), rheumatoid arthritis (2.7%), and primary biliary cholangitis (2.4%). Te order by frequency was exactly the same as 
in the previous 2015 survey. However, the frequency of malignancy increased signifcantly from 6.4% in 2015 to 
10.3% in the present survey (p=0.001). In patients with malignancy, the most frequent complication was gastric 
cancer (1.8%), followed by colon cancer (1.7%) and breast cancer (1.7%).
Treatment. Tere were 665 of 778 patients (85.5%) who were treated with prednisolone; of these, 409 
(63.0%) were treated with a combination of prednisolone and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and 204 (31.8%) 
were treated with prednisolone alone (Table 3). Furthermore, 122 patients (19.1%) were treated with steroid 
pulse therapy. Compared with the 2015 survey, the 2018 survey had signifcantly higher frequencies of prednisolone treatment (85.5% vs. 80.9%; p=0.008), including pulse (19.1% vs. 13.3%; p=0.002). Te initial dose of 
prednisolone was higher in the 2018 survey than in the 2015 survey (40 mg vs. 30 mg, p<0.001). Initial dosages 
of 31–50 mg daily were signifcantly increased, while those of≤30 mg daily were signifcantly decreased (Fig. 2). 
Te 2018 and 2015 surveys had similar efcacy rates of prednisolone (97.8% vs. 97.6%, respectively; p=0.923) 
and rates of relapse during prednisolone treatment (23.2% vs. 24.7%, respectively; p=0.520). Eighty patients 
(12.3%) were treated with azathioprine. Of the 113 patients who did not receive prednisolone treatment, 81 
(71.7%) were treated with UDCA alone and 18 (15.9%) were followed up without treatment. Te rate of biochemical remission afer 6 months of therapy was 58.4% in the 2018 survey. Te rate was signifcantly higher 
in patients receiving prednisolone alone than in those receiving UDCA alone (68.4% vs. 32.7%, respectively; 
p<0.001).

Outcome. During the 3-year survey period, 9 patients (1.1%) died of liver-related causes and 1 patient (0.1%) 
received a liver transplant. Te male-to-female ratio was 1:2.3, and the mean age at diagnosis was 63.2 years in 
these 10 patients.
Discussion
Te prevalence of acute AIH has not been reported in countries other than Japan. Te Japanese nationwide survey in 2009 was the frst to report that 95 of 871 (10.9%) patients with AIH had acute hepatitis1
; this frequency 
remained steady at 11.7% in the 2015 survey2
, but it increased signifcantly to 21.7% in the 2018 survey. To the 
best of our knowledge, this evidence of an increasing trend of acute AIH was the frst to be reported worldwide.
In the present survey, the high prevalence of acute AIH may have afected the AIH characteristics found. Te 
high number of cases that showed no fbrosis on histology was likely directly refective of the high prevalence of 
AIH with acute hepatitis. On the other hand, the increased incidence of acute hepatitis was refected more in the 
laboratory fndings than in the histological fndings. In addition to the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT, and total bilirubin, a low IgG level and a low ANA titer were found as characteristics of acute 
AIH in the previous survey14,16. Te changes in prednisolone treatment, such as the initial dose or frequency of 
pulse therapy, may have refected the increasing incidence of acute hepatitis. Te reason could be that, in the 
2015 survey of AIH patients, the initial dosage of prednisolone was higher and pulse therapy was more frequent 
in patients with acute hepatitis than in those with chronic hepatitis2
.
Te precise reason for the increasing incidence of acute AIH has not been elucidated, although some factors 
can be considered. First, the Japanese diagnosis and treatment guidelines that were proposed in 201422 may have 
led to increased diagnosis of AIH, including acute presentation. In fact, in the present survey, the frequency of 
typical cases, as defned by the Japanese guidelines, was higher than that of defnite cases, as defned by the revised 
or simplifed criteria of the IAIHG. Second, in 2015 in Japan, AIH was designated an intractable disease that can 
be treated with free drugs. However, fulminant hepatitis was excluded from this list of designated intractable 
diseases. Tis system change may have increased the diagnosis of acute liver failure as AIH. Tird, the biases of 
the specifc hospitals and clinics that completed the present survey may have afected the results. However, the 
present results showed a trend of increasing incidence of AIH with acute hepatitis, regardless of the facilities.
In the present survey, there were some changes that cannot be attributed to the increasing incidence of acute 
hepatitis. Te signifcant increase in the incidence of malignancy can refect the increasing trend in the general

population23. Moreover, the present study included relatively fewer women, although the male-to-female ratio 
of 1:5.3 in the present study was the same as the 1:4.3 ratio in a recent epidemiological study in Japan24.
Although the strengths of the present study were the large sample size and the new trend in AIH, there are 
several limitations. First, the number of subjects in the 2018 survey was lower than in the 2015 survey, because 
it was more detailed and took more time. However, the 2018 survey provided new information, such as severity 
and treatment responses. Furthermore, the trend of acute hepatitis was confrmed in the facilities that completed 
both the 2015 and 2018 surveys. Te second limitation of the present study was the defnition of acute hepatitis, 
which was based on histological fndings by each pathologist. Terefore, acute hepatitis cases in the present 
survey may have included acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis, because the histological defnition of acute 
hepatitis has not been elucidated. On the other hand, previous nationwide surveys in Japan have reported the 
prevalence of acute hepatitis using the same defnition; thus, use of the same defnition of acute hepatitis would 
allow a comparison of its prevalence. Although the two phenotypes of acute presentation in the Japanese guidelines are not largely diferent from the concepts in the European Association for the Study of the Liver clinical 
practice guidelines24, validation of the defnition in other cohorts, not only in Japan but also in other countries, 
is needed. Tird, ANA is measured mostly by indirect immunofuorescence (IF) methods using human epithelial 
(HEp-2) cells in Japan. Te high correlation between measurement using frozen liver tissue and that using HEp-2 
cells is confrmed; therefore, indirect IF methods using HEp-2 cells are recommended in Japan. Fourth, patients 
without liver histology were included if they satisfed the revised or simplifed criteria. Terefore, patients with 
drug-induced liver injury or drug-induced AIH-like injury may have been included in the present study. Fifh,

the prognosis of patients having AIH with acute hepatitis cannot be determined from this survey, because the 
subjects were newly diagnosed from 2014 to 2017. Development of internationally uniform diagnostic methods 
and future surveys of acute AIH will address these limitations.
In conclusion, AIH with acute hepatitis in Japan was shown to have an increasing incidence and changing 
characteristics. Te present nationwide survey suggests the need for new strategies for the accurate diagnosis 
and elucidation of the mechanisms in acute AIH.
Methods
Participants. A total of 138 hospitals (not including pediatric centers) that had hepatology specialists were 
asked to complete questionnaires about patients who were newly diagnosed with AIH from 2014 to 2017. Of 
the 138 hospitals, 54 returned the questionnaires from 923 AIH patients. Afer excluding patients who had 
been diagnosed with AIH before 2014 and did not satisfy the revised26 or simplifed criteria27 of AIH, a total of 
796 patients were enrolled in this study. Of the 1687 patients in the previous nationwide survey in 2015, 1,410 
who satisfed the revised or simplifed criteria of AIH were also included in this study. Te Ethics Committee of 
Fukushima Medical University (Fukushima Medical University protocol number: 29182) approved this study 
protocol, which waived the need for written, informed consent because this was an observational study. Instead 
of written, informed consent, information about this study was released, and participants were given the right to 
opt out. Tis survey was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Questionnaire
Te questionnaire included items about age at diagnosis; sex; medical and family history; alcohol and history of 
medication associated with the development of AIH; laboratory and liver histological fndings; diagnosis based 
on the revised and simplifed diagnostic scores, as proposed by the International AIH Study Group (IAIHG)26,27; 
diagnosis and severity grading based on the Japanese guidelines22; clinical symptoms; imaging fndings; presence 
of other autoimmune or malignant diseases; treatments; and outcomes. Te autoantibodies were tested by the 
methods used in each hospital, such as indirect IF or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Severity grading 
was classifed into mild, moderate, and severe based on a combination of clinical signs (hepatic encephalopathy, 
reduction or disappearance of hepatic dullness), clinical laboratory tests (AST/ALT>200 U/L, bilirubin>5 mg/
dL, prothrombin time < 60%), and imaging tests (hepatic atrophy, heterogeneous liver parenchyma pattern) 
(Supplemental Table 1). Steroid pulse therapy was defned as high-dose i.v. corticosteroids (>125 mg methylprednisolone/body/day). Similar to a previous survey5
, in addition to liver histological diagnoses such as acute 
hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, the present survey graded basic histology as interface hepatitis; portal 
infammation; plasma cell infltration; lobular necrosis or infammation (0, absent; 1, mild; or 2, moderate to 
severe); fbrosis (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; or 4, cirrhosis); bile duct injury; hepatocyte rosette 
formation; centrilobular necrosis; emperipolesis; and fatty change (0, absent; 1, present). Acute hepatitis was 
defned based on histological diagnosis by the pathologists in each hospital. Biochemical remission was defned 
as normalization of transaminase (<30 U/L) and IgG (<1,700 mg/dL) levels.

Statistical analysis. Te data are presented as medians for continuous variables and as percentages for 
categorical variables. Diferences between the two groups (2018 survey and 2015 survey) were analyzed using the 
Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the χ2
 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. To 
account for possible bias among the participating hospitals and clinics in the comparison of histological diagnoses, only the 28 facilities that completed both the 2015 and 2018 surveys were analyzed. Statistical analyses were 
performed with SPSS ver. 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A p value of<0.05 was considered signifcant.
