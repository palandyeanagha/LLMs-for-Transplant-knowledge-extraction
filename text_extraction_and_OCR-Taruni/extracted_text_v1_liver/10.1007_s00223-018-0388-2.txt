Abstract
Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are associated with poor health outcomes in older people. Relationships between muscle and 
bone have typically been reported at a functional or macroscopic level. The aims of this study were to describe the relationships between muscle morphology and bone health among participants of the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS). 105 
older men, mean age 72.5 (SD 2.5) years, were recruited into the HSS. Whole body lean mass as well as appendicular lean 
mass, lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were obtained through 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. Percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis was performed successfully in 99 
participants. Image analysis was used to determine the muscle morphology variables of slow-twitch (type I) and fast-twitch 
(type II) myofibre area, myofibre density, capillary and satellite cell (SC) density. There were strong relationships between 
whole and appendicular lean body mass in relation to femoral neck BMC and BMD (r≥0.43, p<0.001). Type II fibre area 
was associated with both femoral neck BMC (r=0.27, p=0.01) and BMD (r=0.26, p=0.01) with relationships robust to 
adjustment for age and height. In unadjusted analysis, SC density was associated with whole body area (r=0.30, p=0.011) 
and both BMC (r=0.26, p=0.031) and area (r=0.29, p=0.017) of the femoral neck. We have demonstrated associations 
between BMC and changes in muscle at a cellular level predominantly involving type II myofibres. Interventions targeted 
at improving muscle mass, function and quality may improve overall musculoskeletal health. Larger studies that include 
women are needed to explore these relationships further.

Introduction
Sarcopenia is associated with disability, impaired quality 
of life and mortality in older people [1]. Health sequelae 
associated with sarcopenia include physical frailty, type 
II diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis [2–4]. The combination of mobility disability and osteoporosis increases the 
risk of falls and subsequent fracture that are also independently associated with significant morbidity, chronic disability, need for long-term care, high health care costs and 
mortality [5, 6]. Several pathophysiological mechanisms 
contribute to the development of sarcopenia including 
muscle denervation, mitochondrial dysfunction, declines 
in neurohormonal drive, inflammation, impaired satellite 
cell (SC) function and/or number, physical inactivity and 
undernutrition [4, 7, 8]. The changes contribute to an unfavourable decline in muscle mass, quality and consequently 
muscle function. Muscle mass is determined by myofibre 
size and number. At a cellular level, sarcopenia appears to 
be associated with a global loss of both type I, slow-twitch 
and type II, fast-twitch myofibres with a preferential loss 
and atrophy of type II fibres [9–11].
Osteoporosis is common in both genders and with 
increasing age. It is characterised by abnormalities of both 
trabecular and cortical bone, demonstrated on DXA scan 
as lower bone mineral density (BMD) as well as content 
(BMC). This leads to a progressive decline in the ability of bone to resist deformation from low energy trauma 
[5]. Bone and skeletal muscle share the same mesenchymal origin and respond to similar trophic cues from hormones, growth factors and inflammatory mediators [12, 
13]. For example, bone mass is influenced by mechanical 
loading produced not only by gravity but by body mass 
and skeletal muscle contraction. As a consequence, dysfunction of one tissue can affect the other and changes in 
bone mass will follow declines in body weight, muscular 
mass and strength [14, 15]. Several studies have examined the association between low skeletal muscle mass, 
sarcopenia and osteoporosis [3, 14, 16, 17]. For example, 
in a study of women who had sustained a hip fracture, 
DiMonaco et al. showed that a low appendicular lean mass 
index (aLMi: aLM/height2
) was significantly associated 
with osteoporosis [18]. In a further study of both men 
and women, the same authors found a high prevalence of 
low aLMi, previously referred to as sarcopenia, post hip 
fracture [19]. Analysis of approximately 2000 communitydwelling older men by Yu et al. showed that a diagnosis 
of sarcopenia (using the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People [AWGS] diagnostic algorithm) was 
independently associated with increased fracture risk over 
a 12-year follow-up and this risk substantially increased 
with a simultaneous diagnosis of osteoporosis [20]. Men 
are known to have higher morbidity and mortality rates 
from osteoporotic-related fracture associated, in part, with 
low treatment rates and a higher likelihood of not receiving treatment [21].
Few studies have explored cellular changes in muscle and 
their association with measures of bone health such as BMD 
or BMC. One study in a murine model of senile osteoporosis 
showed that cross-sectional areas of both type I and type 
II fibres were lower in soleus muscle [22]. In a study of 
older women aged 60–85 with osteoporosis undergoing hip 
arthroplasty, morphology analysis revealed preferential type 
II fibre atrophy that was highly correlated with BMD [23]. 
To our knowledge, there are no population-based studies of 
muscle morphology and bone health in older men. Our aims 
for this study were to explore the relationship between muscle morphology and bone health as assessed by dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) among healthy communitydwelling older men aged 68–77 years participating in the 
Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS).
Methods
Study Participants
The Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS) was designed 
to investigate life course influences on muscle morphology, 
mass and strength in community-dwelling older people. 
We recruited 105 healthy community-dwelling older men 
aged between 68 and 77 years who previously participated 
in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS) [24]. Participants 
were characterised in terms of their physical performance, 
body composition, muscle morphological parameters and 
sarcopenia status. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and study 
methods have been previously described in detail [25]. The 
Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee approved the 
study (approval number 07/Q0204/68) and each participant 
gave written informed consent. Investigations on participants 
were conducted in accordance with the principles expressed 
in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Anthropometry, Bone Health, Body Composition 
and Physical Performance Measurements
Height in centimetres (cm) and weight in kilograms (kg) 
were measured once. Body composition was assessed by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Discovery, software version 12.5) and was performed on all participants to quantify area, BMC and BMD relating to the whole 
body, total lumbar spine and total femoral neck, as well as 
total lean mass (kg) and appendicular lean mass (aLM) (kg). 
Isometric grip strength (kg) was measured three times in 
each hand using a Jamar handheld hydraulic dynamometer

(Promedics, UK) and the highest reading of six was used for 
analysis [26]. A validated battery of tests was used to assess 
lower limb muscular function that included: five timed chair 
rises, a 6-m timed up-and-go test and customary walking 
speed over 3 ms [27–29]. Both the DXA machine and Jamar 
dynamometer were calibrated at regular intervals throughout 
the study.
Muscle Biopsy
Percutaneous muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were 
conducted after an overnight fast under local anaesthetic 
using a Weil-Blakesley conchotome [30]. Of the 105 men, 
102 were eligible for the procedure; three were ineligible as 
they were taking medication that might influence subsequent 
wound healing (n=2) or predispose to haematoma formation (n=1) and biopsies from a further three participants 
were not suitable for analysis [31]. Therefore, 99 had muscle 
biopsies that successfully yielded sufficient tissue for morphological analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
The protocol and primary antibodies used for histochemical analysis on muscle tissue have been previously 
described [31]. The following morphological parameters 
were obtained: type I and II myofibre density (fibres/mm2) 
and myofibre cross-sectional areas (CSA) (µm2) (Fig. 1a). 
Fast fibre proportions were expressed as a percentage of 
total fibres. The total number of muscle fibres and capillaries was quantified from a given tissue area. Within this 
area, capillary density (capillaries per mm2) and capillary: fibre ratio were derived (Fig. 1b). Satellite cells (SCs) 
were identified in separate tissue sections that were counterstained with haematoxylin to differentiate myonuclei 
(Fig. 1c, d). SCs were quantified as follows: SC density 
[cells/mm2] and SC to fibre ratio. Muscle morphology 
parameters were analysed in all samples by an observer 
who was blinded to the participants’ anthropometry, body 
composition and sarcopenia status.

Statistical Analysis
Normality was checked through visual inspection of histograms. Skewed distributions were log-transformed or 
square-root transformed (if included zero). Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square 
of height (m).
Participant characteristics were described using summary 
statistics. The associations between muscle morphology, 
lean mass parameters and bone outcomes were examined 
using Pearson correlations. Partial correlations (adjusting 
for age and height) were examined for relationships with 
significant (p≤0.05) Pearson correlations. The analysis sample consisted of the 99 participants who underwent muscle 
biopsy. All analyses were conducted using Stata release 14 
(STATA Corp, College Station, Texas, USA).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Participant characteristics as well as statistics for the bone 
parameters and fibre morphology of the 99 HSS men are 
presented in Table 1. Mean (SD) age was 72.4 (2.4) years. 
The participants had mean weight, BMI, total lean mass and 
aLM values of 82.7 (12.6) kg 27.2 (3.6) kg/m2, 56.4 (6.5) kg 
and 24.1 (3.1) kg, respectively.
Relationships Between Lean Mass Measures 
and Bone Outcomes
Total lean and aLM were strongly associated (p<0.01) with 
area, BMC and BMD at the whole body, lumbar spine and 
femoral neck in unadjusted analyses (Table 2). Unadjusted 
associations between lean mass and aLM, in relation to 
femoral neck BMC and BMD are presented in Fig. 2. After 
adjustment for age and height, aLM was not associated with 
lumbar spine area or BMC, or femoral neck area; lean mass 
was not associated with lumbar spine area; but the other 
associations remained significant (p<0.05) (Table 3).
Relationships Between Muscle Morphology 
Parameters and Bone Outcomes
Slow fibre area was associated with femoral neck BMC in 
the unadjusted analysis but this was not robust to adjustment 
for age and height (Tables 2, 3). Fast fibre area was associated with femoral neck BMC and BMD in the unadjusted 
analysis (Fig. 3) and after adjustment for age and height. 
In unadjusted analysis only, the number of SCs per fibre 
and SC density were both associated with whole body and 
femoral neck area; satellite cell density was also associated 
with femoral neck BMC (Fig. 4). All associations described 
above were positive (0<r<1).
Discussion
In this unique study of a cohort of community-dwelling 
healthy older men, we identified significant relationships 
between whole body and appendicular lean mass and femoral neck BMC and BMD. Fast-twitch (type II) myofibre 
area was positively associated with femoral neck BMC and 
BMD. Satellite cell density and SC per fibre were positively 
associated with femoral neck BMC. The study of muscle 
tissue has immense benefits not only providing opportunity 
for molecular analysis, i.e. gene expression, but also allows 
the study of myofibre composition to assess the muscle size/
strength relationship. This allows inferences to be made on

how cell and molecular changes exert influence at the macroscopic/functional level.
Muscle and bone are and highly coupled from early 
embryonic development through adolescence, adulthood and 
involution in both structure and physical function [32]. Muscles and bones become larger and stronger from growth and 
undergo adaptive modelling not only in response to gravitational- and activity-based loading but also in response to 
nutrition, vitamins and essential nutrients such as vitamin 
D and calcium. These effects occur through mechanical and 
functional interactions mediated by bidirectional cross-talk 
between myokines and osteokines crucial to the bone–muscle secretome [33].
We have previously reported that muscle size is associated with bone size and strength measured by peripheral 
quantitative computerised tomography (pQCT) in women 
and men [34]. These findings support the mechanostat 
hypothesis which suggests that changes in bone mass with 
ageing generally follow the age-related change in muscular mass as well as strength [35, 36]. The results from our 
current study are in broad agreement with several previous 
reports describing the associations between lean mass and 
BMD. For example, in a study of older men and women 
aged 60–92 by Kirchengast and Huber, lean mass correlated 
significantly with whole body and femoral neck BMD in 
men. Furthermore, sarcopenic men (defined as those with 
low aLMI) were more likely to have osteopenia and osteoporosis than women [37]. Similarly, in another study of 679 
older men aged 40–79, low aLM and aLMi was associated 
significantly with lower areal BMD. Again, men with sarcopenia (defined as low aLMi) were more likely to have 
osteoporosis [38]. In further support of our findings, a study 
of 198 men aged 60 and over by Pereira et al. concluded 
that low lean mass, low aLMi as well as sarcopenia (using 
the EWGSOP diagnostic algorithm) predicted lower BMD 
[39]. In a cross-sectional study of older men and women 
aged 73–93 years, Visser et al. showed that muscle mass was 
positively associated with total body, upper and lower limb 
BMD in men [40]. The relationships between lean mass and 
BMD at the lumbar spine and the hip have also been seen

in older post-menopausal women [18, 40–43]. The clinical consequences of low lean mass on bone have also been 
explored previously. For example, men who sustained hip 
fracture were more likely to be sarcopenic as defined by low 
aLMi [19, 44].
Muscle mass is a function of fibre number and area. 
Myofibre cross-sectional areas are maintained by the myonuclear domain; the cytoplasmic area directly influenced 
by a myonucleus [45]. Since myofibres are syncytial, it

of the myonuclei will depend on a host of systemic, local 
and paracrine cues as well as renewal by satellite cells 
after myofibrillar damage. We speculate that an increase 
in type II, fast-twitch, myofibre area is consistent with an 
attainment and maintenance of greater lean mass. This is 
reflected in the positive associations we see with femoral 
neck BMC and BMD. However, we did not observe any 
associations between type I or type II fibre area and either 
whole body or lumbar spine BMC or BMD. The exact 
reasons for this are unclear. However, in support of our 
findings, a study of older women aged 65–85 undergoing hip arthroplasty showed that there was a preferential 
type II fibre atrophy in skeletal muscle obtained from the 
vastus lateralis as well as a significant negative correlation 
between increased proportion of type II fibre atrophy and 
BMD [23]. Furthermore, in a mouse model (SAMP 6 phenotype) of senile osteoporosis, soleus muscle type I and 
type II fibres exhibited significant atrophy [22]. Satellite 
cells are quiescent unipotent stem cells that have the ability to differentiate into myogenic cell lineage in response 
to muscle injury [46, 47]. We suggest that our findings of a 
positive correlation between SC density and femoral neck 
BMC reflect the positive correlation between Type II fibre 
area and femoral neck BMC.
To our knowledge we are the first to report the association between type II fibres, satellite cell density and BMD 
or BMC at the femoral neck in men. Our study has several 
limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the sample size was modest which influences statistical power. 
Second, histological techniques used to quantify the morphology parameters were open to observer error although 
consistent and rigorous methods were applied throughout 
the study in order to limit this possibility. Finally, the histological parameters measured may not accurately reflect 
the morphological changes occurring in muscle. We suggest that longitudinal studies would be helpful to more 
fully characterise the morphological changes that occur 
over time in the muscle of people with sarcopenia, osteopenia and osteoporosis.
Our study has a number of strengths. First, we have 
shown that it is feasible to obtain tissue from communitydwelling older men in the context of an epidemiological 
birth cohort. The advantage of this is that morphological 
data can be combined with the extensive phenotypic data 
that have already been collected. Second, the histology 
methods employed were based on tested protocols and can 
be applied to future studies that also include women. Our 
study shows that quantification of several morphological 
variables is possible using these methods.

Conclusions
We have shown that there are significant relationships 
between muscle mass and bone mineral density and content. At a cellular level these relationships appear to arise 
from morphological changes that predominantly affect 
type II myofibres. Although, future studies would need 
to include women, our results suggest that attaining and 
maintaining higher total lean as well as appendicular muscle mass may prevent a decline in BMD and progression to 
osteoporosis. Identifying people with coexistent of sarcopenia and osteoporosis may be clinically important. These 
people represent an especially vulnerable group who are at 
high risk of falls, fractures and further morbidity and are 
therefore in need of interventions that combine pharmacological therapy, nutrition and physical activity to maintain 
muscle as well as bone strength and function.
