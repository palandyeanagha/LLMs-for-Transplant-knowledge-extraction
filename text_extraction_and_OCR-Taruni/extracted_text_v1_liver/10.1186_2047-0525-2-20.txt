Abstract
Background: The impact of intraoperative transfusion on postoperative mortality in lung transplant recipients is still
elusive.
Methods: Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to investigate the influence of red blood cells (RBCs)
and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on mortality in 134 consecutive lung transplants recipients from September 2003
until December 2008.
Results: Intraoperative transfusion of RBCs and FFP was associated with a significant increase in mortality with odds
ratios (ORs) of 1.10 (1.03 to 1.16, P = 0.02) and 1.09 (1.02 to 1.15, P = 0.03), respectively. For more than four
intraoperatively transfused RBCs multivariate analysis showed a hazard ratio for mortality of 3.8 (1.40 to 10.31,
P = 0.003). Furthermore, non-survivors showed a significant increase in renal replacement therapy (RRT) (36.6%
versus 6.9%, P <0.0001), primary graft dysfunction (PGD) (39.3% versus 5.9%, P <0.0001), postoperative need of
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (26.9% versus 3.1%, P = 0.0019), sepsis (24.2% versus 4.0%,
P = 0.0004), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (26.9% versus 3.1%, P <0.0001), infections (18.1% versus
0.9%, P = 0.0004), retransplantation (12.1% versus 6.9%, P = 0.039) and readmission to the ICU (33.3% versus 12.8%,
P = 0.024).
Conclusions: Intraoperative transfusion is associated with a strong negative influence on outcome in lung
transplant recipients.

Background
Liberal transfusion practice has been shown to exert
negative influences on morbidity and mortality in different groups of patients due to increased incidence in viral
and bacterial infections, activation of inflammatory and
coagulation pathways, and immunologic reactions related to transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) [1]. After
lung transplantation the grafts are vulnerable for dysfunction because of denervation, postischemic condition,
absent perfusion of bronchial arteries and lacking of
lymphatic drainage system. In this context, transfusionrelated acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusionassociated circulatory overload (TACO) are more
common than infectious complications, and increase
morbidity and mortality [2]. Transfusion of fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) may also be associated with adverse effects
as transfusion of FFP has been independently associated
with a higher risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) in trauma [3] and critically ill patients
[4]. Recently, we demonstrated that intraoperative transfusion of more than 7 units of RBCs in liver transplant
recipients was associated with increased mortality [5]. In
lung transplant recipients, however, we still lack clear
data on the influence of transfusion practice on outcome. To date, there is only one report demonstrating

reduced survival after platelet transfusion in lung transplant recipients [6].
The present retrospective study was designed to investigate the influence of intraoperative transfusion of RBCs
and FFPs on mortality in lung transplant recipients.
Methods
Following approval by the local Ethics Committee of the
Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, (KEK 4), which waived
the need for written informed consent for this retrospective analysis, we included a total of 134 consecutive
lung transplant recipients who were treated at the ICU,
University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. The
study period was 75 months, from September 2003 until
December 2008.
Pretransplant recipient data
For baseline characteristics, we collected age, gender,
height and weight. The underlying disease and the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was
documented. Furthermore, we assessed whether the patients were admitted to transplantation from home, normal ward or an ICU.
Intraoperative data
The number of transfused units of RBCs, FFP, platelet
concentrates, fibrinogen and the use of extracorporeal
circulation (ECC) during the operation were recorded.
The management of coagulation and transfusions practice was done according to internal guidelines. In fact a
hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL and a coagulation
management aiming at functional fibrinogen levels as
assessed by thromboelastometry were used [7].
ICU data
The following data were collected: length of stay (LOS) in
the ICU, ventilation days, occurrence of renal replacement
therapy (RRT) and of primary graft dysfunction (PGD),
postoperative use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), occurrence of sepsis and MODS, frequency of readmission to the ICU, and need of retransplantation.
Indications for ECMO were exactly as described previously
[8] and for RRT the occurrence of risk, injury, failure, loss,
end-stage renal disease (RIFLE) class 2 (injury), as we use
routinely in our transplant programme [5,9].
Analyzing protocol
All of the data were extracted from the patients’ charts.
Endpoint of the observational period and for analysis
was 31 December 2008. The patients were divided into
survivors (S) and non-survivors (NS).
First, baseline and clinical data were analyzed and
compared. Then, intraoperative and ICU data were analyzed and compared between the two groups.
Survival was analyzed in terms of ICU mortality and
cumulative survival over the entire observation period.
In addition, we performed subgroup analyses assessing
cumulative survival comparing the patients that received
more than four RBCs to the ones with less RBCs transfused. Finally, a multivariate analysis was done to examine whether transfusing RBCs or FFPs are independent
risk factors for mortality.
Statistical analysis
Univariate analysis was done with chi-square test for
nominal data; unpaired data analysis for continuous variables was performed by means of Mann–Whitney test
or logistic regression. For multivariate analysis we used a
Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent
risk factors for mortality. Calculation of cumulative survival overall and for the subgroups was done by Kaplan–
Meier analysis with log rank testing. Data are expressed
as mean ± SD; different data expression is stated in the
text. All calculations were done with StatView 4.5
(Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA, USA). Statistical significance was accepted with P <0.05 (two-sided tests).

between survivors and non-survivors (P = 0.16). Concomitant lung disease was similar in all patients, without
any statistically significant difference between the two
groups (P = 0.65) (Table 2). While 104 patients were admitted from home (82 survivors, 22 non-survivors), 22
were admitted from the normal wards (14 survivors, 8
non-survivors) and 8 patients from the ICU (6 survivors,
2 non-survivors), there was no difference between the
two groups (P = 0.41). Mean donor age was 42.5 ± 14.2
years (42.1 ± 14.1 years in the survivors versus 43.8 ±
15.1 years in the non-survivors group, P = 0.57). Taken
together, there were no statistically significant differences between survivors and non-survivors.
Intraoperative transfusion and use of intraoperative
extracorporeal circuit
Intraoperative transfusion of RBCs and FFP was associated with a significant increase in mortality with odds
ratios (ORs) of 1.10 (1.03 to 1.16, P = 0.02) and 1.09
(1.02 to 1.15, P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences regarding transfusion of platelets
(P = 0.48) and application of fibrinogen (P = 0.90).
Overall, there was no difference in the use of extracorporeal circuit between the groups (P = 0.31). Details
are given in the Tables 3 and 4.
ICU journey
In non-survivors, LOS in the ICU (P = 0.0007) and ventilation days (P = 0.011) were significantly prolonged compared
to survivors. Furthermore, non-survivors had significantly
higher incidence of RRT (P <0.0001), PGD (P <0.0001),
postoperative ECMO (P = 0.002), sepsis (P <0.0001),
MODS (P <0.0001), retransplantation (P = 0.040) and readmission to the ICU (P = 0.024). Details are shown in
Table 5.
Mortality rate
Overall ICU mortality was 8.9% (12 out of 134 patients).
Overall cumulative 1-year survival was 86% and cumulative 3-year survival was 72.8%. There was a significantly
decreased cumulative 1-year survival in the group with
transfusion of more than four RBCs (survival 81.2%
versus 87.6%, P = 0.042). For details see Figure 1.
Multivariate analysis
Risk factors for mortality
The Cox proportional hazards model for mortality identified transfusion of more than four RBCs (P = 0.003),
sepsis in the ICU (P = 0.045), PGD (P = 0.0004) and
RRT in the ICU (P = 0.015) as independent risk factors
for mortality. In contrast, use of cardiopulmonary bypass
intraoperatively (P = 0.35), pre-existing PH (P = 0.36),
transfusion of more than five FFPs (P = 0.78), age >60
years (P = 0.10), RRT 6 months after transplantation
(P = 0.39), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.09) and more
than 9 days of ventilation in the ICU (P = 0.12) were
not discriminated as risk factors for mortality. Details
are given in Table 6.
Discussion
The main finding of this study is that intraoperative
transfusions of RBCs were associated with increased
mortality in lung transplant recipients.
There is a growing body of evidence that the number
of intraoperative transfusions alters outcome in different patient populations. Gajic et al. demonstrated that
8% of transfused critically ill patients developed acute
lung injury within 6 hours after transfusion [4]. In another study, Christie et al. showed that increased
amounts of soluble receptors for advanced glycation
end products (a marker for lung epithelial injury) as a
consequence of transfusion was clearly associated with
PGD in lung transplant recipients [10]. Furthermore,

intraoperative transfusion of platelets was associated
with worse outcome after lung transplantation [6]. To
date, we are still lacking literature regarding the impact of
transfusions on long-term outcome in lung transplant recipients. In liver transplant recipients, however, Massicotte
et al. prospectively demonstrated that transfusion was associated with worse outcome [11].
Interestingly, in our study population there were no
baseline differences between the groups; in particular, there
was no influence of underlying diagnosis, intraoperative
cardiopulmonary bypass use or pre-existing PH to transfusion rates, which could explain these findings. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude such a difference because of the
small sample size, in which the analysis might fail revealing
relevant differences between survivors and non-survivors.
But, taken together, in this context our study supports the
hypothesis that intraoperative transfusion might have negative impact on outcome in lung transplantation recipients.
As a consequence, avoiding intraoperative transfusion of at
least RBCs as much as feasible might be a beneficial strategy to improve survival in such patients.
A limitation of that suggestion and of this study is
clearly the retrospective design. Other limitations are
that we did not systematically measure comorbidities in
our population and therefore we cannot exclude such an
influence on the transfusion requirement. Therefore, a
prospective approach in an equal design as Massicotte
used in liver transplantation adapted to lung transplants
would be important to strengthen or rule out the conclusions drawn from this retrospective setting. Furthermore, the sample size of the study is only moderate and
therefore our results must be interpreted very carefully.
However, as long as we lack data of a larger sample size
or of prospective trials, we recommend being careful
with intraoperative transfusion in lung transplantation.
Conclusions
Intraoperative transfusion of RBCs appears to be an independent risk factor for worsened outcome in lung
transplant recipients. Therefore, transfusions should be
reduced and be avoided as much as possible, at least as
long as we lack results of further prospective data.
