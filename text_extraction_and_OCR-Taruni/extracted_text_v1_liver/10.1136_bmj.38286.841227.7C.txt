Incidence of hepatitis C virus and HIV among new
injecting drug users in London: prospective cohort study

In England, the low prevalence of HIV among injecting
drug users during the 1990s was attributed in part to the
introduction of harm reduction interventions in the late
1980s. Also, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus in the late
1990s was thought to be relatively low compared with
other countries, at around 40% overall and 15% among
those who had been injecting drugs for less than six
years.1 We carried out a prospective cohort study of new
injecting drug users in London to estimate the incidence
of hepatitis C virus and HIV.
Participants, methods, and results
In 2001, we recruited from community settings mainly
in London, but also in Brighton, 428 injecting drug
users who were aged below 30 years or had been injecting for six years or fewer. All had injected in the previous
four weeks and could provide addresses for follow up.
They completed interviewer administered questionnaires and provided oral fluid specimens and optionally
dried capillary blood spots for testing for antibodies to
hepatitis C virus and HIV using published methods.2 3
They were followed up 12 months later. We calculated
incidence using standard person time methods.
Most of the participants (91%) were recruited in
London. The mean (SD) age was 27.4 (5.3) years, and
29% of the participants were women. Three fifths
(61%) of the sample at baseline had been injecting for
less than four years, and the median frequency of
injecting was 2.5 times a day. Most (71%) mainly
injected opiates, although just over half (53%) had
injected cocaine or crack in the previous year.
Participants reported high levels of injecting risk
behaviour, with 24% at baseline reporting injecting in
the previous four weeks with needles and syringes used
by someone else, and 53% sharing injecting paraphernalia. The baseline prevalence of antibody to hepatitis
C virus was 44% and of antibody to HIV was 4% (table).
The overall follow up rate was 70%, and we found
no difference between those followed up and those lost
to follow up for sociodemographic characteristics or
injecting risk behaviour. The incidence of antibody to
hepatitis C virus was 41.8 cases per 100 person years
and of antibody to HIV was 3.4 cases per 100 person
years (see table).
Comment
The incidence of hepatitis C virus in England is high
and of HIV higher than expected. These findings are
corroborated by ongoing surveillance data, and
suggest that transmission may have recently increased.1
Injecting drug users in London have a higher
incidence of hepatitis C virus than those in many cities
worldwide, and an incidence of HIV comparable to
that among men who have sex with men attending
clinics for sexually transmitted infection in London.4
Possible explanations for the rising incidence
include changes in patterns of injecting drug use, with
greater injection of crack and injecting risk behaviour in
newer injecting drug users than in those injecting in the
early to mid-1990s. In addition there may have been
increases in the size of the population of injecting drug
users over and above any increase in protective
interventions. Recent estimates suggest that current

syringe distribution in London provides one new needle
per injecting drug user every two days and that fewer
than one in four are in drug treatment at any one time.5
Specific targets to prevent bloodborne viruses among
injecting drug users have been absent from the UK government’s drug strategy in the past five years, and there
has been little targeted health education or prevention
campaigns. Increasing the coverage of syringe exchange
and provision of drug treatment is only part of the solution. Innovative strategies are required, specific to hepatitis C virus and to HIV, to change behaviour and to
deliver health education messages and harm reduction
strategies early enough to make a difference.

Averting a change to the date of the royal succession
I will be 90 years old in 2005 and have a very clear memory of an
episode which took place at my home in Mansfield in 1926 when
I was 11. My father, H L Flint, was a general practitioner but was
much involved with cardiology. We understood (rightly or
wrongly) that he was the first person in the Midlands able to take
electrocardiographs. One fair-sized room in our house was his
surgery. (Panel patients had a scruffy place in the town.) The
electrocardiograph took up nearly the whole length of one wall.
The patient sat with both feet and arms in saline baths and was
wired up to the machine. Moreover, wires were run through our
house and garden, over a high wall, through a neighbour’s
garden, and so to the General Hospital, which stood high above
us, to enable hospital patients to be wired up there, too.
At that time, the then Prince of Wales kept his hunters at
Melton Mowbray (about 35 miles away). His vet was worried
about the health of the Prince’s favourite hunter, “Tarzan.” He had
heard of my father and asked whether it would be possible to take
an ECG of Tarzan. After consideration my father decided to have
a try. In due course, the horse arrived with the vet, groom, and an
equerry, in a large horsebox. When this was arranged, my mother
promptly decided to go and stay with her mother, so we still have
the details in a letter I wrote, telling my mother all about it.
My father had invited the entourage to stay to lunch, but they
refused politely. The horse was taken into the garden and, with
considerable trouble, made to stand with all four feet in saline
and wired up. Several ECGs were taken. All this had taken longer
than expected, so my father reissued the invitation to lunch,
which was accepted. This annoyed me very much because there
wasn’t enough cauliflower cheese to go round, so I was banished
to the kitchen for plain bread and cheese.
On examining the recording my father found that Tarzan had
“heart block.” The Prince was informed that he must never ride
the horse again. Two weeks later the horse dropped dead while
galloping around its field.
My father was a very cautious man. In those days, any medical
man who advertised was liable to be struck off the register.
Needless to say, the local press got wind of the affair and
photographers waited outside for ages and took photos of Tarzan
with me included, but fortunately without my father.
My two brothers were much younger than I, so never appeared
from the nursery, where they watched the proceedings through
the window. One brother, now a retired consultant physician, told
me that when he started medical school electrocardiographs of
this size were still in use.
It is interesting to speculate that, had this ECG not been taken,
the Prince of Wales might have suffered a fatal accident while
riding Tarzan to hounds, and the affair with Mrs Simpson and the
resulting abdication would never have taken place.
